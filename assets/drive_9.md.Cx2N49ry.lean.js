The most common symbolic use of the skull is as a representation of death, mortality and the unachievable nature of immortality. Humans can often recognize the buried fragments of an only partially revealed cranium even when other bones may look like shards of stone. The human brain has a specific region for recognizing faces,(University of Wales, Bangor) \\"New function identified for an area of the brain\\" and is so attuned to finding them that it can see faces in a few dots and lines or punctuation marks; the human brain cannot separate the image of the human skull from the familiar human face. Because of this, both the death and the now-past life of the skull are symbolized. Hindu temples and depiction of some Hindu deities have displayed association with skulls. Moreover, a human skull with its large eye sockets displays a degree of neoteny, which humans often find visually appealing‚Äîyet a skull is also obviously dead, and to some can even seem to look sad due to the downward facing slope on the ends of the eye sockets. A skull with the lower jaw intact may also appear to be grinning or laughing due to the exposed teeth. As such, human skulls often have a greater visual appeal than the other bones of the human skeleton, and can fascinate even as they repel. Our present society predominantly associates skulls with death and evil. Unicode reserves character U+1F480 (üíÄ) for a human skull pictogram. Examples The skull that is often engraved or carved on the head of early New England tombstones might be merely a symbol of mortality, but the skull is also often backed by an angelic pair of wings,Tony Taylor, \\"The Mystery of Graveyard Art & Symbols\\" lofting mortality beyond its own death. All is Vanity by C. Allan Gilbert, 1873-1929 One of the best-known examples of skull symbolism occurs in Shakespeare's Hamlet, where the title character recognizes the skull of an old friend: \\"Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio; a fellow of infinite jest...\\" Hamlet is inspired to utter a bitter soliloquy of despair and rough ironic humor. Compare Hamlet's words \\"Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know not how oft\\" to Talmudic sources: \\"...Rabi Ishmael [the High Priest]... put [the severed head of a martyr] in his lap... and cried: oh sacred mouth!...who buried you in ashes...!\\". The skull was a symbol of melancholy for Shakespeare's contemporaries.See Albrecht D√ºrer's Melencolia. Skull art is found in depictions of some Hindu Gods. Lord Shiva has been depicted as carrying skull. Goddess Chamunda is described as wearing a garland of severed heads or skulls (Mundamala). Kedareshwara Temple, Hoysaleswara Temple, Chennakeshava Temple, Lakshminarayana Temple are some of the Hindu temples that include sculptures of skulls and Goddess Chamunda. The temple of Kali is veneered with skulls, but the goddess Kali offers life through the welter of blood. In Elizabethan England, the Death's-Head Skull, usually a depiction without the lower jawbone, was emblematic of bawds, rakes, sexual adventurers and prostitutes; the term Death's-Head was actually parlance for these rakes, and most of them wore half-skull rings to advertise their station, either professionally or otherwise. The original Rings were wide silver objects, with a half-skull decoration not much wider than the rest of the band; This allowed it to be rotated around the finger to hide the skull in polite company, and to reposition it in the presence of likely conquests. Sugar skull given for the Day of the Dead, made with chocolate and amaranthSkulls and skeletons are the main symbol of the Mexican holiday, Day of the Dead. Venetian painters of the 16th century elaborated moral allegories for their patrons, and memento mori was a common theme. The theme carried by an inscription on a rustic tomb, \\"Et in Arcadia ego\\"\\"I too [am] in Arcadia\\", if it is Death that is speakingis made famous by two paintings by Nicholas Poussin, but the motto made its pictorial debut in Guercino's version, 1618-22 (in the Galleria Barberini, Rome): in it, two awestruck young shepherds come upon an inscribed plinth, in which the inscription ET IN ARCADIA EGO gains force from the prominent presence of a wormy skull in the foreground. Next to Mary Magdalene's dressing-mirror, in a convention of Baroque painting , the Skull has quite different connotations and reminds the viewer that the Magdalene has become a symbol for repentance. In C. Allan Gilbert's much- reproduced lithograph of a lovely Gibson Girl seated at her fashionable toilette, an observer can witness its transformation into an alternate image. A ghostly echo of the worldly Magdalene's repentance motif lurks behind this turn-of-the-20th century icon. The skull becomes an icon itself when its painted representation becomes a substitute for the real thing. Simon Schama chronicled the ambivalence of the Dutch to their own worldly success during the Dutch Golden Age of the first half of the 17th century in The Embarrassment of Riches. The possibly frivolous and merely decorative nature of the still life genre was avoided by Pieter Claesz in his Vanitas (illustration, below right): Skull, opened case-watch, overturned emptied wineglasses, snuffed candle, book: \\"Lo, the wine of life runs out, the spirit is snuffed, oh Man, for all your learning, time yet runs on: Vanity!\\" The visual cues of the hurry and violence of life are contrasted with eternity in this somber, still and utterly silent painting. Vanitas, by Pieter Claesz, 1630 (Mauritzhuis, The Hague) When the skull appears in Nazi SS insignia, the death's-head (Totenkopf) represents loyalty unto death. However, when tattooed on the forearm its apotropaic power helps an outlaw biker cheat death.Margo DeMello, Bodies of Inscription: A Cultural History of the Modern Tattoo Community, (Duke University Press) 2000, ch. \\"Creation of Meaning\\" explores the semiotics of modern tattooing. The skull and crossbones signify \\"Poison\\" when they appear on a glass bottle containing a white powder, or any container in general. But it is not the same emblem when it flies high above the deck as the Jolly Roger: there the pirate death's-head epitomizes the pirates' ruthlessness and despair; their usage of death imagery might be paralleled with their occupation challenging the natural order of things.\\"In Virginia in 1720 one of the six pirates facing the gallows \\"called for a Bottle of Wine, and taking a Glass of it, he drank Damnation to the Governour and Confusion to the Colony\\", which the Rest pledg'd\\". (Marcus Rediker, \\"Under the Banner of King Death\\": The Social World of Anglo-American Pirates, 1716 to 1726\\" The William and Mary Quarterly, Third Series, 38.2 (April 1981:203-227) p. 219. \\"Pirates also affirmed their unity symbolically\\", Marcus Rediker asserts, remarking the skeleton or skull symbol with bleeding heart and hourglass on the black pirate ensign, and asserting \\"it triad of interlocking symbols‚Äî death, violence, limited time‚Äîsimultaneously pointed to meaningful parts of the seaman's experience, and eloquently bespoke the pirates' own consciousness of themselves as preyed upon in turn. Pirates seized the symbol of mortality from ship captains who used the skull 'as a marginal sign in their logs to indicate the record of a death'\\"Rediker 1981:221, and 223, quoting S. Charles Hill, \\"Episodes of piracy in Eastern waters\\", Indian Antiquary 49 (1920:37). Today, humans typically note the skull and crossbones sign as the almost universal symbol for toxicity. The skull of Adam at the foot of the Cross: detail from a Crucifixion by Fra Angelico, 1435 When a skull was worn as a trophy on the belt of the Lombard king Alboin, it was a constant grim triumph over his old enemy, and he drank from it. In the same way a skull is a warning when it decorates the palisade of a city, or deteriorates on a pike at a Traitor's Gate. The Skull Tower, with the embedded skulls of Serbian rebels, was built in 1809 on the highway near Ni≈°, Serbia, as a stark political warning from the Ottoman government. In this case the skulls are the statement: that the current owner had the power to kill the former. \\"Drinking out of a skull the blood of slain (sacrificial) enemies is mentioned by Ammianus and Livy,MacCulloch is referring to Livy xxiii.24, of events of 216 BCE: \\"Postumius died there fighting with all his might not to be captured alive. The Gauls stripped him of all his spoils and the Boii took his severed head in a procession to the holiest of their temples.There it was cleaned and the bare skull was adorned with gold, as is their custom. It was used thereafter as a sacred vessel on special occasions and as a ritual drinking- cup by their priests and temple officials.\\" and Solinus describes the Irish custom of bathing the face in the blood of the slain and drinking it.\\"J.A.

Head hunters of the Amazon: Seven Years of Exploration and Adventure, New York: Garden City 1925 p. 273-283 or in New Guinea. The late medieval and Early Renaissance Northern and Italian painters place the skull where it lies at the foot of the Cross at Golgotha (Aramaic for the place of the skull). But for them it has become quite specifically the skull of Adam. The Serpent crawling through the eyes of a skull is a familiar image that survives in contemporary Goth subculture. The serpent is a chthonic god of knowledge and of immortality, because he sloughs off his skin. The serpent guards the Tree in the Greek Garden of the Hesperides and, later, a Tree in the Garden of Eden. The serpent in the skull is always making its way through the socket that was the eye: knowledge persists beyond death, the emblem says, and the serpent has the secret. Symbolism of chance (Fortuna's wheel) divine justice (right angle and plumb-bob) and mortality in a Pompeiian mosaic The skull speaks. It says \\"Et in Arcadia ego\\" or simply \\"Vanitas.\\" In a first-century mosaic tabletop from a Pompeiian triclinium (now in Naples), the skull is crowned with a carpenter's square and plumb-bob, which dangles before its empty eyesockets (Death as the great leveller), while below is an image of the ephemeral and changeable nature of life: a butterfly atop a wheela table for a philosopher's symposium.

In Mesoamerican architecture, stacks of skulls (real or sculpted) represented the result of human sacrifices. The skull speaks in the catacombs of the Capuchin brothers beneath the church of Santa Maria della Concezione in Rome,The Crypt: Church of the Immaculate. Official site of the Capuchins where disassembled bones and teeth and skulls of the departed Capuchins have been rearranged to form a rich Baroque architecture of the human condition, in a series of anterooms and subterranean chapels with the inscription, set in bones: :Noi eravamo quello che voi siete, e quello che noi siamo voi sarete. :\\"We were what you are; and what we are, you will be.\\" An old Yoruba folktaleWilliam R. Bascom: If√° Divination: Communication Between Gods and Men in West Africa (Indiana) tells of a man who encountered a skull mounted on a post by the wayside. To his astonishment, the skull spoke. The man asked the skull why it was mounted there. The skull said that it was mounted there for talking. The man then went to the king, and told the king of the marvel he had found, a talking skull. The king and the man returned to the place where the skull was mounted; the skull remained silent. The king then commanded that the man be beheaded, and ordered that his head be mounted in place of the skull. In Vajrayana Buddhist iconography, skull symbolism is often used in depictions of wrathful deities and of dakinis. In some Korean life replacement narratives, a person discovers an abandoned skull and worships it. The skull later gives advice on how to cheat the gods of death and prevent an early death. In fashion Alexander McQueen is credited with popularizing a fashion trend with stylized skulls, starting with skull-decorated bags and scarves. The trend is extant by the early 2010s.

It was formed shortly after the 2000 federal election as the Western Independence Party of British Columbia with an explicit western separatist platform; it later renamed itself as the Western Refederation Party of British Columbia before adopting its final name. After the name change, the party slightly changed its focus; it hoped to force changes to the way that British Columbia is governed within Canada. BC Refederation believed in the collective wisdom of the people of BC and believed that nothing initiated by the citizens should be restricted including being allowed a provincial referendum on political independence from Canada for British Columbia if desired by the public. The BC Refederation Party argued that there are three constitutional flaws in Canada. The first, that there exists no confederation document approved democratically. The second, that there exists no democratically achieved constitutional documents federally or provincially and the third, that there is no constitutional basis for the federal government's rights to collect income tax. 2005 election As the Western Refederation Party of British Columbia, RefedBC nominated four candidates in the 2005 provincial election, who won a total of 653 votes (0.039% of the popular vote across the province): *Bruce Ryder won 275 votes (0.90% of the total) in Nanaimo-Parksville, *Linden Robert Shaw won 168 votes (0.69%) in Nanaimo *Allen McIntyre won 149 votes (0.62%) in Powell River- Sunshine Coast, and *Mel Garden won 61 votes (0.21%) in Comox Valley. 2009 election In the 2009 provincial election the party ran a total of 22 candidates who managed to achieve 3,748 total votes. 2017 election It nominated three candidates in the 2017 provincial election, none of whom was elected.\\"BC Liberals cut to minority with Greens holding balance of power\\", The Globe and Mail, 10 May 2017 Leaders John Twigg, 2007 * Mike Summers, 2008‚Äì2010 * Ingrid Voigt, 2010‚Äì2011 Party program The goals of the BC Refederation Party were contained in a three-step plan. #Enact direct democracy to immediately empower the citizens of BC to control politicians and the political process. #Create a citizen designed and ratified written constitution that will entrench the rights of citizens and clearly define the rights of citizens over government. #Regain areas of former provincial control from the federal government.

He is regarded by Sunnis as a renowned scholar, and was a contemporary of the Abbasid caliphs Al-Mansur, Al-Hadi, Al-Mahdi and Harun al-Rashid. He was imprisoned several times; finally dying in Baghdad in the Sindi ibn Shahak prison. Ali al-Rida, the eighth Imam, and Fatemah al- Ma'sumah were among his children. Birth and early life Musa al-Kadhim was born during the conflict between the Abbasids and Umayyads, and was four years old when As-Saffah, the first Abbasid Caliph, took the throne. His mother, Hamidah, was a former slave from either Berbery or Andalusia. Al-Kadhim was brought up in a large family, with nine sisters and six brothers. According to Twelver Shiites, his oldest brother Ismail predeceased his father Ja'far al- Sadiq, who held the position of Imam and Musa was chosen by divine order and decree of his father as the next Imam. According to some sources, al-Kadhim was religiously minded as a child. Muhammad Baqir Majlisi relates an incident where Ab≈´ ·∏§anƒ´fa called on Ja'far al-Sadiq to ask his advice. While there, he encountered al-Kadhim, who was then five years old. Hanifa asked al-Kadhim the question meant for his father, saying: \\"Boy, from whom does disobedience (issue)? Does it issue from Allah or from the servant?\\" Al-Kadhim answered, saying: \\"Either it issues from God and not from the servant at all, so God does not punish the servant for what he does not do; or it issues from the servant and God, and God is a stronger partner. Therefore, the stronger partner has no right to punish the weak for a sin in which they are equal; or it issues from the servant and not from God. So if He wills to pardon (him), (He will pardon him), and if He wills to punish (him), (He will punish him); and God is He whose help is sought.\\" Upon hearing this, Hanifa left, saying that the answer had been good enough for him. Al-Kadhimiya Mosque, in Kadhimiya In another incident, Ab≈´ ·∏§anƒ´fa complained to al-Sadiq, saying: \\"I have seen your son, Musa, pray while the people were passing (walking) before him. He did not prevent them from that.\\" The Imam ordered his son to be brought before him, and asked him whether it was true. Al-Khadhim replied \\"Yes, father, the One to Whom I pray is nearer to me than them; Allah, the Great and Almighty, says: We are nearer to him than the jugular vein.\\" On hearing this response, the Imam rose, hugged his son, and said; \\"May my father and mother be your ransom, O he in whom secrets have been deposited!\\" Imamate Musa al-Kadhim was said to be a gentle and tolerant man. He was called al-Kadhim because he was kind, forgiving and generous toward the people who treated him in a bad manner or were unfriendly towards him. Ibn Khallikan said \\"that when a man had spoken ill of him he sent him a purse of money.\\" One such incident concerned a man who cursed al-Kadhim's grandfather, Imam Ali. The Imam's followers intended to kill the man, but al-Kadhim prevented them. He went to the man's farm in the outskirts of Medina. He approached him, but the man shouted at him not to walk on his plants. The Imam paid no attention and when he reached him, sat beside him and treated him kindly, asking how much had the man paid to sow his land. \\"One hundred dinars,\\" said the man. \\"How much do you hope to acquire from it?\\" asked the Imam. \\"I do not know the unknown,\\" said the man. \\"I only asked you about what you hope it would bring you,\\" insisted the Imam. The man answered \\"two hundred dinars\\", and the Imam gave him three hundred dinars, saying \\"This three hundred dinars is for you and your plants are as they are.\\" The Imam then headed for the mosque of the prophet, where he saw that the man was already sitting there. When he saw the Imam, the man stood up and called out the verse: \\"Allah knows best where to put his (prophetic) mission.\\" His companions were surprised at this change, but the man recited to them the noble deeds of the Imam and invoked Allah for him. Hence, the Imam turned to his companions and said: \\"Which was better ‚Äì what you wanted or what I wanted? I have put right his attitude to the extent you have now become acquainted with.\\" Musa al-Kadhim was also called Abdu' al- Salih (the Holy Servant) because his interests lay in religious rather than political matters. He was known to distribute money to the town of Medina despite his family being poor. The Shiite Imams frequently had to deal with persecution, and sometimes resorted to the practice of taqiyya, a form of religious dissimulation, for protection. When Jafar al-Sadiq was poisoned, the Caliph Al-Mansur wanted to end the imamah, and so he wrote to the governor of Medina to behead the person that al-Sadiq had named as his successor in his last testament. When he read the testament, however, the governor of Medina saw that the Imam had chosen four people rather than one: the caliph himself, the governor of Medina, the Imam's older son Abdullah al-Aftah, and Musa, his younger son. As a result, Mansur was unable to end the imamate. However, unlike his father who had been able to teach freely in Medina, Musa al-Kadhim lived with tight restrictions set by Abbasid caliphs, such as al-Mansur and Harun al-Rashid. Musa al-Kadhim never accepted Harun's government, because he believed al- Rashid sought to destroy Islam by erasing the truth and effacing justice. Therefore, he forbade his Shi'ites from cooperating with Harun, excluding those who through their jobs could help the believers and save them from oppression.Sharif al-Qarashi2 2000, p. 393 Caliph Harun al-Rashid, an opponent of the Imam, said that al-Kadhim had the qualities of a true Imam, and that he was better suited to inherit the Caliphate from Muhammad than al- Rashid. When his son al-Ma'mun asked him why he magnified the Imam, he said that Musa al-Kadhim was \\"the Imam of the people, the proof of Allah's mercy to His creation and His caliph among His servants\\". \\"I am\\", Harun said, \\"outwardly the Imam of the masses by force and through oppression, while Musa ibn Ja'far is the Imam in truth.\\" However, he said that he would not deliver the Caliphate to the Imam: \\"by Allah, if you yourself attempt to take such caliphate from me, I shall take it away from you even if that means gouging your eyes, for power is blind.\\" He advised his son to get true knowledge from the Imam, saying: \\"This (Musa al-Kadhim) is the inheritor of the knowledge of the Prophets ... If you desire sound knowledge, you will find it with this.\\" Afterwards when al-Ma'mun inherited the Caliphate from al-Rashid, he insisted on giving it to Musa al-Kadhim's son, Ali al-Ridha, the eighth Shiite Imam, arguing that he found \\"no person on the face of earth more learned than this man.\\" =Division= After the death of al-Kadhim's father, Ja'far al-Sadiq, the sixth Imam the majority of Shiites followed Musa al-Kadhim, while another group followed Isma'il, al-Sadiq's older son. Imam Jafar al-Sadiq tried hard to clarify that his son Musa will be the next Imam after his death because the Shi'a maintain that the infallibility of the Imam is a basic rule in the Imamate. ‚ÄúThe theologians have defined the Imamate, saying: \\"Surely the Imamate is a grace from Allah, Who grants it to the most perfect and best of His servants to Him‚ÄùSharif al-Qarashi p. 98 This latter group separated afterwards from the majority of Shiites and became known as Ismailis. Smaller groups accepted either Abdullah al-Aftah or Muhammad, other sons of Ja'far al- Sadiq, as the Imam. Finally, another group considered Ja'far al-Sadiq to be the last Imam. After the death of Musa al-Kadhim, the majority followed his son, Ali al-Ridha, while the rest believed that al-Kadhim was the last Imam. This latter group became known as the Waqifiyah. Theological disputes =With Harun al-Rashid = One of the stories about the Imam concerns an incident where Harun al-Rashid and the Imam were together before the tomb of Muhammad in Medina, when, to show his family ties to Muhammad, al-Rashid had said, \\"Salutation unto thee, O Prophet of God, unto thee who art my cousin!\\" In response, the Imam said, \\"Salutation unto thee, o my dear father!\\" which made al-Rashid furious. \\"Abul-Hasan, such glory as thine is truly to be vaunted of\\" said al-Rashid. Later, al-Rashid found the opportunity to question him, asking why he had permitted people to ascribe him to Muhammad and to call him: \\"O Sons of Allah's Apostle\\", while he was actually the son of Ali, and that one is ascribed to his father, and that Fatimah, his mother, was a container, and that Muhammad was his grandfather on the side of his mother. The Imam replied, asking \\"If the Prophet was raised from the dead and proposed to your daughter, would you respond to him?\\" \\"Rather I would through that pride myself on the Arabs, the non-Arabs, and Quraysh,\\" answered al-Rashid. \\"But he would not propose (to my daughter) and I would not marry (her) to him,\\" said the Imam, \\"because he begot me and did not beget you.\\" Al-Rashid, however, was not satisfied with this answer, insisting that \\"the progeny belongs to the male and not to the female\\", and that the Imams were Muhammad's daughter's children. The Imam quoted from the Quran, stating that in the Quran, God had said: \\"and of his descendants, David and Solomon, Job, Joseph, Moses and Aaron; and thus do We reward those who do good. And Zechariah and John the Baptist, and Jesus and Elias: All in the company of the righteous\\" \\"Who is Jesus's father, O Commander of the faithful?\\" asked the Imam. \\"Jesus had no father,\\" said al-Rashid. The Imam argued that God had ascribed Jesus to the descendants of the prophets through Mary; \\"similarly, we have been ascribed to the descendants of the Prophet through our mother Fatimah,\\" said the Imam. Nevertheless, al-Rashid asked the Imam to give him more evidence and proof, so he put forward another quote from the Quran, reciting the verse: \\"But whoever disputes with you in this matter after what has come to you of knowledge, then say: Come, let us call our sons and your sons and our women and your women and ourselves and yourselves, then let us be earnest in prayer, and pray for the curse of Allah on the liars.\\" Then he said: \\"None claims that the Prophet made someone enter under the cloak when he challenged the Christians to a contest of prayer to God (mubahala) except Ali, Fatimah, al- Hasan, and al-Husayn. Therefore the explanation of the verse is: Our sons are al-Hasan and al-Husayn; our women is Fatimah; ourselves is Ali.\\" =With Bishr al-Hafi= Another incident concerns Bishr al-Hafi, who led a Bacchic life. Once in the midst of the noise, music, alcoholic drink and frivolity, Musa al- Kadhim happened to pass by his house in Baghdad. Al-Kadhim saw a slave girl coming out of the house carrying some sweepings. He turned to the slave and asked her: \\"Is the owner of this house free or a servant?\\" \\"He is free,\\" she replied. \\"You are right,\\" responded Musa al-Kadhim, \\"if he was a servant, he would fear his Lord.\\" The slave girl came into the house while al-Hafi was still at the wine table: \\"What delayed you?\\" asked al-Hafi. She informed him of what had happened between her and the Imam. It is said that al-Hafi rushed to the door barefooted but the Imam had already left, so he left in search of the Imam, and when he found him, asked him to repeat his words. Al-Hafi was so taken aback by the Imam's words that he fell on the ground and began to cry. \\"No, I am a slave, I am a slave.\\" From then on, he would walk without shoes and people would call him Bishr al-Hafi (The barefooted one). When asked why he did not wear shoes, he would say that he was guided while he was barefoot, so he would remain in that condition till death. =With a monk= A final incident concerned Al-Abbas (born Hilal al-Shami), who said to Musa al-Kadhim that people admired those who ate simple food, wore coarse clothes, and showed reverence. For that reason, the Imam reminded him of Joseph, who had been a prophet; however, Joseph had worn silk mantles decorated with gold, and sat on the thrones of the Pharaohs. \\"The people were in no need of his clothes, but they were in need of his justice,\\" said the Imam. \\"An Imam is required to be just and fair; when he says something, he says the truth; when he promises something, he fulfills his promise; when he passes a judgement, he judges equitably. Allah has not forbidden wearing a particular type of clothes or eating a particular type of food earned through a lawful way; rather He has forbidden the unlawful, little or much.\\" Then he recited the verse: \\"Say: Who has forbidden the beautiful (gifts) of Allah which He has produced for His servants, and the agreeable things of the sustenance.\\" Imprisonments and death =First imprisonment= Musa al-Kadhim was imprisoned multiple times during his lifetime. The first time, Caliph al-Mahdi had him arrested and brought to Baghdad. According to Ibn Khallikan, \\"This Caliph had a dream in which Ali ibn Abu Talib appeared to him and said, 'O Muhammad, were ye ready therefore, if ye had been put in authority, to commit evil in the earth, and to violate the ties of blood? Al-Fadl ibn al-Rabi' says: \\"He sent for me at night and that put me in great dread. I went to him and found him chanting the above verse and no man had a finer voice than he. He said to me, 'Bring me Musa ibn Ja'far.' I did so and he embraced him, seated him by his side and said to him, 'Abul-Hasan, I have just seen in a dream the Commander of the Faithful, Ali ibn Abu Talib, and he has recited to me such and such a verse; give me the assurance that you will not revolt against me or against any of my children.' He answered, 'By Allah, I am incapable of revolting.' 'You say the truth!' replied the Caliph, 'give him three thousand pieces of gold and restore him to his family in Medina.' I arranged the affair of his departure that very night, lest some obstacle might turn up, and before morning the man was on his journey.\\" =Second imprisonment= Al-Kadhim's second imprisonment was a result of his argument with al-Rashid over descent from Muhammad. Al- Khuzai, the head of the palace guards, narrated a dream the Caliph supposedly had, which made him release the Imam: \\"A messenger came to me from al-Rashid,\\" he said, \\"at an hour in which I never before received his visits; he pulled me from the place where I was and would not even allow me to change my clothes. This put me in great fear. When I arrived at the palace, I found the Caliph sitting up in his bed. I saluted him, but he kept silent for some time; so my mind was much troubled and my fears greatly augmented. At length he said, 'Do you know why I sent for you at such an hour?' I answered, 'By Allah, I do not, Commander of the Faithful.' 'Know,' said he, 'that I just had a dream in which it seemed to me as if an Abyssinian came to me with a javelin in his hand and said to me: \\"Let Musa ibn Ja'far be set at liberty this very hour, otherwise I shall slay thee with this javelin.\\" Do you therefore go and get him set free.' I replied, 'Commander of the Faithful, shall I then liberate Musa the son of Ja'far?' 'Yes,' said he, 'go and set Musa ibn Ja'far at liberty. Give him thirty thousand dirhems and say to him in my name, if you would like to remain with us you will obtain from me whatever you desire, but if you prefer going to Medina you have permission to do so.' I went to the prison and found the Imam waiting for me. 'Whilst I was asleep,' he said, 'behold the Apostle of God came to me and said, O Musa, thou hast been imprisoned unjustly; so recite the words I am going to repeat to thee, for assuredly thou shalt not pass all this night in prison. =Final imprisonment= Wooden box of the shrine of Imam Musa al-Kadhim, made 6th century AH, Iraq Museum in Baghdad Al-Fakhri states the reason for his final imprisonment was that \\"there were some of the relatives of Musa ibn Ja'far who were envious of him and carried false reports about him to al-Rashid, saying, 'The people are paying him the Khums, or one- fifth of their property, on accepting the Imamah, and he is about to come forth against you.' They brought this report to al-Rashid so frequently that it made him anxious and agitated. In that year al-Rashid went on the pilgrimage, and when he arrived in Medina, he arrested Musa ibn Ja'far, and brought him to Baghdad in a litter, and imprisoned him under the care of al- Sindi ibn Sha'hik.\\" Al-Fakhri adds \\"Al-Rashid was at Rakka when he sent orders that the Imam should be put to death. They then brought a number of reputable men to Karkh to act as coroners and to testify publicly that he had died a natural death. He, then, was buried in the cemetery of Quraish on the south side of Baghdad.\\" The implication made by the Shi'a is that he was poisoned. It was narrated that he was tortured for many years during each stay in prison. The most severe imprisonment was under Sindhi. It was narrated that he used to put him in a grave-like jail, where it would be difficult to distinguish night from day. It is narrated that Imam Musa Kadhim used to put his nose near the door in hopes of breathing but Sindhi would slam the door violently, injuring him severely. He was then eventually poisoned by dates and was forced to eat them by Sindhi. The place he was buried was a cemetery, but soon this place became the focus of pilgrimage to the grave of the Imam. A town grew around the graveyard. The name of the town became Kadhimiya (the town of the Imam Kadhim). A reputed school of theology was founded in this town; the school is still a source of learning for many students from all over the world. Selected sayings \\"Allah has two proofs over men: outward proof and inward one. As for the outward proof, it is the messengers, the prophets, and the Imams. As for the inward proof, it is reason.\\" * \\"Little work from a scholar is doubly accepted; much work from the men of low desire and ignorance is refused.\\" * \\"Try hard that your time may be four hours: one hour is for supplicating Allah, one hour for the affairs of the livelihood, one hour for associating with the brothers (friends) and the reliable ones who let you know your defects and who are inwardly loyal to you, and one hour for that you are alone with yourselves (and) for non-forbidden things. Through this hour you have power over the three hours.\\" * \\"Tell yourselves of neither poverty nor a long lifetime, for whoever tells himself of poverty becomes miserly. Whoever tells himself of a long lifetime becomes greedy.\\" * The generous and polite is under the protection of Allah; He does not leave him until He makes him enter the Garden. Allah sends out none as a prophet except the generous. * \\"Misfortune is one for the patient and two for the impatient.\\" * \\"Silence is among the doors to wisdom; it brings about love and is a proof of all good things.\\" * \\"Good neighbor is not refraining from harm, but good neighbor is showing patience toward harm.\\" * \\"O Hisham, the Commander of the faithful, peace be on him, has said: 'Allah is not served through a thing better than reason. Man's reason is not perfect unless it has various qualities: unbelief and evil from him are safe. Reason and good from him are hoped. The surplus of his money is spent. The surplus of his speech is prevented. His share of the world is only daily bread. ... Abasement along with Allah is more beloved to him than exaltedness along with other than Him. Humbleness is more beloved to him than high rank. He regards as much the little good from other than him and as little his own good. He sees all men better than him, and that he is the most wicked of them in his soul.\\" * When Harun al-Rashid, threw him into the dark cells of prisons, he thanked Allah, saying: \\"O Allah, you know that I used to ask You to give me free time to worship You. O Allah, You have done that. To You be praise.\\" * \\"How base is the world for people, unless God give them joy; and how great is this life, if God is not angry with them.\\" Commemoration The Festival of Imam Musa al Kadhim is a Twelver Shia Muslim festival dedicated to the memory of the Imam Musa al-Kadhim.

It was selected as a national anthem at the time of the Federation of Malaya's independence from the UK in 1957. The tune was originally used as the regional anthem of Perak, which was adopted from a popular French melody titled \\"La Rosalie\\" composed by the lyricist Pierre-Jean de B√©ranger. Some of the musical renditions were modified several times in 1992, 2003 and 2006.  History  = Competition and invited composers = Pierre-Jean de B√©ranger, the creator of a popular French melody titled \\"La Rosalie\\", from which this song was adopted. At the time of independence, each of the eleven states that made up the Federation of Malaya had their own regional anthem, but there was no national anthem for the Federation as a state. Tunku Abdul Rahman, at the time the Chief Minister and Minister for Home Affairs, organised and presided over a committee for the purpose of choosing a suitable national anthem. On his suggestion, a worldwide competition was launched. 514 entries were received from all over the world. None were deemed suitable. Next the committee decided to invite selected composers of international repute to submit compositions for consideration. The composers chosen were Benjamin Britten (who later described his submission to be a \\"curious and I'm afraid rather unsuccessful job\\"), Sir William Walton who had recently composed the march for Queen Elizabeth II's coronation, the U.S. opera composer Gian Carlo Menotti and Zubir Said, who later composed Majulah Singapura, the national anthem of Singapore. They were all turned down too. = Use of Perak State Anthem melody = Sultan Abdullah of Perak, who adopted Pierre's \\"La Rosalie\\" as the Perak Royal Anthem during his exile on Seychelles for abetting murder. The Committee then turned to the Perak State Anthem. On 5 August 1957, it was selected on account of the \\"traditional flavour\\" of its melody. New lyrics for the national anthem were written jointly by the Panel of Judges‚Äî with the Tunku himself playing the leading role. At the time this melody was, while still the State Anthem of Perak, Allah Lanjutkan Usia Sultan. The song had been very popular on the island of Mah√© in the Seychelles, where the Sultan of Perak had formerly been living in exile. Some rumours claimed that he heard it at a public band concert on the island, a song to a popular French melody claimed to have been composed by the lyricist Pierre-Jean de B√©ranger (1780‚Äì1857), who was born and died in Paris. But there is no evidence for this since he was a lyricist who use tunes by other for his song and the title is not listed in the four published volumes of his songs or the volume of tune he used for his songs. It is also claimed that when Sultan Idris Murshidul‚Äôadzam Shah, who was the Ruler of the State of Perak from 1887 to 1916, represented the Malay Rulers of the Federated Malay States at the Coronation of King Edward VII in 1901, his protocol officer was asked what his state anthem was. Realising that his state did not in fact possess an anthem, he, in order not to appear backward in front of his hosts, proceeded to hum the aforementioned tune. The song was later introduced into an Indonesian Bangsawan (Opera), which was performing in Singapore around 1940. In no time at all, the melody became extremely popular and was given the name \\"Terang Bulan\\". Aside from its dignity and prestige as the Perak State Anthem, the song became a Malayan \\"evergreen\\", playing at parties, in cabarets and sung by almost everybody in the 1920s and 1930s. (Today, of course, since independence, it is not played as a popular melody, and any such use is proscribed by statute.) The anthem was given a new quick march beat in 1992, which proved unpopular. Some Malaysians have gone as far as to say that the altered tempo resembled circus music, and was the subject of much derision. =Proposed renaming= In July 2003, it was reported in the Malaysian press that the anthem would be rearranged for the second time after that and the title and lyric would be changed from Negaraku to Malaysiaku (meaning \\"My Malaysia\\"). There was a public outcry of dismay and the change of name was scrapped, but the anthem was re-arranged and returned to the pre-1992 pace by composer Wah Idris.  Lyrics  Original Malay lyrics Literal English lyrics { class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"background:none;\\" Negaraku, Tanah tumpahnya darahku, Rakyat hidup, Bersatu dan maju!

With divine blessings of peace and joy, Long may our King, reign sublime! }  Other songs with same melody  Three gramophone record versions have been released in the following titles bearing the similar tune of the Malaysian anthem: 1930s \\"Mamula Moon\\" was pressed on Parlophone Records (Catalogue Ref: F.2211) in the 1930s, performed by British Band Legend, Geraldo and His Orchestra, with vocals by Danny Vaughn. This love song was performed using jazz instruments on a foxtrot dance beat. 1940s \\"I Shall Return\\" was recorded by Anne Shelton in the late 1940s, by Pickwick Music Ltd, published on Decca 78rpm record (Catalogue Ref. F.10037/DR.17340). 1950s The song was also recorded by the Sydney Latin band leader Paul Lombard (also known as Paul Lombard and His Orchestra), as \\"Malayan Moon\\" in 1952 with lyrics sung by Joan Wilton (in English) and Geoff Brooke (in Malay), released by Columbia Records in Sydney as D0-3460. The significance of this piece of recording, which is only playable on gramophones running at 78 rpm speed, is that the background music is conducted so similarly to the Malayan style of music background, setting the originality and authentic Malayan atmosphere to the tune. The song was performed by non-natives (Australians) singing in both English and Malay. The lyrics present a love story setting between the two lovers. The other side of the record is the song \\"Planting Rice\\", also performed by Paul Lombard accompanied by a vocal chorus by Joan Wilton. This piece of music was copyrighted by Southern Music Co. of Sydney. \\"Negaraku\\" as a song derived from Hawaiian origins, which was later used as the Perak anthem, but not yet as anthem for the whole of Malaya during that time.

Controversies  = Modified into a rap song = In 2007, a YouTube video featuring a parody of the Negaraku anthem caused controversy in Malaysia. The video, named Negarakuku, features Namewee, a Malaysian student studying in Taiwan, who weaves the Negaraku into a Chinese language rap. The Flag of Malaysia was featured at the backdrop. This controversial video caused outrage among most members of the Malaysian cabinet. The song criticises the government and pejoratively speaks about the Malays, the primary ethnic group of Malaysia. The title of the video \\"Negarakuku\\" may mean \\"My Negaraku\\", as the suffix -ku implies first-person possession in the Malay language. However, a more plausible explanation is that \\"kuku\\", sounding similar to English \\"cuckoo\\", means \\"crazy\\" in slang usage. Thus in this sense, \\"Negara kuku\\" means \\"crazy country\\", which is possibly the intended meaning given the content of the video. \\"Kuku\\" is also a Malaysian Chinese slang term for penis, which, combined with the \\"crazy\\" meaning, is used as an insult. = Terang Bulan adaptation allegation by Indonesian recording company = In 2009, an Indonesian state-owned recording company named Lokananta had brought in allegations that \\"Negaraku\\" imitated an older Indonesian folk song titled \\"Terang Boelan\\". However, \\"Terang Boelan\\" itself is a song adapted from a much older French song titled \\"La Rosalie\\". The allegation is considered to be politically motivated due to certain conflicts that were brought up between the two countries such as Indonesia's defeat in the 1963‚Äì66 confrontation and the ownership dispute of the Ligitan and Sipadan islands. = Lyrics modification into another language = In 2019, students and teacher Chinese vernacular school in Seremban, Negeri Sembilan was caught on video singing Negaraku in Chinese language. The video was uploaded to YouTube and went viral which caused public outcry. Another case of lyrics modification of Negaraku also happened days after the Chinese language version went viral, when students of religious school sung the national anthem in Arabic and uploaded on the internet. Royal Malaysian Police later issued investigation of both incident of anthem singing in another language as its violated the National Anthem Act of 1968. Education director- general Amin Senin stated that the conduct was meant to improve the understanding of the meaning and purpose of Negaraku.https://en.syok.my/news/negaraku-in-chinese- arabichttps://www.nst.com.my/news/nation/2019/12/545730/cops-now- investigating-negaraku-arabic See also Allah Lanjutkan Usia Sultan * Terang Bulan References History of the Negaraku with further comments =Citations= =Other= M.

This is a particularly interesting date, for it helps in establishing the authenticity and historicity of Lord Rama and the events of Ramayana.  Celebrations  Chinawal village temple, Maharashtra The day is the ninth and last day of Chaitra Navaratri (not to be confused with the autumn Navratri). It celebrates the arrival of Vishnu's 7th avatar, god Rama. It is marked by the faithfuls with puja (devotional worship) such as bhajan and kirtan, by fasting and reading passages about Rama's life. Special cities in the Ramayana legends about Rama's life observe major celebrations. These include Ayodhya (Uttar Pradesh), Rameswaram (Tamil Nadu), Bhadrachalam (Telangana) and Sitamarhi (Bihar). Some locations organize Rath-yatras (chariot processions), while some celebrate it as the wedding anniversary festival (Kalyanotsavam) of Rama and Sita. While the festival is named after Rama, the festival typically includes reverence for Sita, Lakshmana and Hanumana given their importance in Rama's story. Some Vaishnava Hindus observe the festival in Hindu temples, some observe it within their homes. Surya, the Hindu sun god, is a part of the worship and ceremonies in some communities. Some Vaishnava communities observe all nine days of Chaitra Navaratri remembering Rama, and reading the Ramayana, with some temples organizing special discussion sessions in the evening. Charitable events to help those in need and community meals are organized by temples and Vaishnava organizations, and for many Hindus it is an occasion for moral reflection. In Karnataka, Sri Ramanavami is celebrated by the local Mandalis (organizations) at some places even on footpaths, dispersing free panaka (jaggery and crushed muskmelon juice) and some food. Additionally, in Bengaluru, Karnataka, the Sree Ramaseva Mandali, R.C.T (R.) Chamrajpet, organizes India's most prestigious, month-long classical music festival. The uniqueness of this 80 years old musical extravaganza is that celebrated Indian classical musicians, irrespective of their religion, from both genres ‚Äì Carnatic and Hindustani ‚Äì descend down to offer their musical rendition to Lord Sri Rama and the assembled audience. Bhadrachalam temple in Telangana is one of the major Rama Navami celebration sites. In eastern Indian states such as Odisha, Jharkhand, and West Bengal, the Jagannath temples and regional Vaishnava community observe Rama Navami, and treat it as the day when preparations begin for their annual Jagannath Ratha Yatra in summer.Logs for Trinity‚Äôs chariots arrive in Odisha‚Äôs Puri town, Odisha Sun Times (24 January 2016)All set for grand Ram Navami Shobhayatra, The Hitavada (15 Apr 2016) Devotees associated with ISKCON fast through the daylight hours.

Significance  The Significance of the Festival is indicates the victory of goodness on evil and establishment of the Dharma to beat the Adharma. Ram Navami festival celebration starts with the Jal (water) offering in the early morning to the God Sun (A Deity) to get blessings from him. People also beliefs that the God Sun as an ancestor of the Lord Rama. Outside India Rama Navami is one of the Hindu festivals that is celebrated by the Indian Hindu diaspora with roots in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. The descendants of Indian indentured servants/slaves who were forced to leave India by engineering a famine in these places by the then British rule, and then promised for job were shipped to colonial South Africa before 1910 to work in British owned plantations and mines, thereafter lived through the South African Apartheid regime, continued to celebrate Ram Navami by reciting Ramayana, and by singing bhajans of Tyagaraja and Bhadrachala Ramdas. The tradition continues in contemporary times in the Hindu temples of Durban every year.Paula Richman (2008), Ways of Celebrating Ram's Birth: Ramayana Week in Durban, South Africa, Religions Of South Asia, Volume 2 Issue 2, pages 109‚Äì133 Similarly in Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, Jamaica, other Caribbean countries, Mauritius, Malaysia, Singapore, and many other countries Hindu descendants of colonial era indentured workers/slaves forced by the British government from India have continued to observe Ram Navami along with their other traditional festivals. It is also celebrated by Hindus in Fiji, and those Fiji Hindus who have re-migrated elsewhere. = Why Is Ram Navami Celebrated = Rama Navami is one of the Hindu festivals that is celebrated by the Indian Hindu diaspora with roots in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. Ram Navami celebrates the birth of the seventh incarnation of Lord Vishnu. Lord Ram appeared in Ayodhya as the son of King Dasharath and Queen Kaushalya in the Raghu Kula (Solar Dynasty). He was born on the ninth day of Chaitra month in the noon. This day coincides with the ninth day of Chaitra Navratri, on which is the day when the fasting concludes. As per the Gregorian calendar, the festival falls in the month of March or April. The celebration of Ram Navami is done with devotion and joy. The house is decorated and Deity idols are beautifully decorated with flowers, clothes and jewels. The celebrations include fasting, singing of devotional songs, visiting temple and recitation of hymns from Ram Charitmanas. In some places, the celebrations start from the first day of Chaitra Navratri until Navami. While Ram Lila- a theatrical enactment of Ramayana, recitation of Ramayan, chariot procession of Ram, Sita and Laxman idols is done, discourse on Ramayana by story-tellers and satsangs are organized at few places.

It was the first hypertext system to run on readily available commercial hardware and OS. It is also possibly the first computer-based system to have had an \\"undo\\" feature for quickly correcting small editing or navigational mistakes.  Features  FRESS was a continuation of work done on van Dam's previous hypertext system, HES, developed the previous year. FRESS ran on an IBM 360-series mainframe running VM/CMS. It improved on HES's capabilities in many ways, inspired by Douglas Engelbart's NLS. FRESS implemented one of the first virtual terminal interfaces, in order to provide device-independence. It could run on various terminals from dumb typewriters up to the Imlac PDS-1 graphical minicomputer. On the PDS-1, it supported multi-window WYSIWYG editing and graphics display. The PDS-1 used a light pen, not a mouse, and the light pen could be \\"clicked\\" using a foot-pedal. FRESS allowed multiple users to collaborate on as set of documents, which could be of arbitrary size, and (unlike prior systems) were not laid out in lines until the moment of display. FRESS users could insert a marker at any location within a text document and link the marked selection to any other point either in the same document or a different document. This was much like the World Wide Web of today, but without the need for the anchor hyperlinks that HTML requires. Links were also bi-directional, unlike in today's web. FRESS had two types of links: tags and \\"jumps\\". Tags were links to information such as references or footnotes, while \\"jumps\\" were links that could take the user through many separate but related documents. FRESS also had the ability to assign keywords to links or text blocks to assist with navigation. Keywords could be used to select which sections to display or print, which links would be available to the user, and so on. Multiple \\"spaces\\" were also automatically maintained, including an automatic table of contents and indexes to keywords, document structures, and so on. Users could view a visualization of the \\"structure space\\" of the texts and cross-reference links, and could directly rearrange the structure space, and automatically update the links to match. FRESS was essentially a text-based system and editing links was a fairly complex task unless you had access to the PDS-1 terminal, in which case you could select each end with the lightpen and create a link with a couple of keystrokes. FRESS provided no method for knowing where the user was within a collection of documents.  Usage  FRESS was used as educational technology for several classes at Brown, probably being the first hypertext system used in education. Most notably it was used for teaching an introduction to poetry in 1975 and 1976. In those days it was difficult to convince faculty in the humanities that computers could be useful in their teaching or work, or to convince the people funding the computer center that writing was an appropriate use of the expensive computers of the time. But English Professor Robert Scholes and two teaching assistants worked with the FRESS team to run a small experiment funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities. They saw hypertext as an attractive new way to present poetry, which is often highly reflexive and full of allusions and references to other works. They also wanted to help students directly interact with the course material, and engage with other students and instructors to collectively add meaning to it. There was only a single Imlac terminal, which students signed up for time on, so only 12 students per course could use FRESS. The students in the section which read and commented on the material via FRESS wrote about three times as much as students in control groups, and seemed to benefit from the use of the system, but given the small number of students in the study, the uncertainty in the results is high. A short film was made to document the project, which was rediscovered and shown as part of NEH's 50th anniversary celebration. FRESS was for many years the word processor of choice at Brown and a small number of other sites. It was used for typesetting many books, including those by Roderick Chisholm, Robert Coover and Rosmarie Waldrop. For example, in the Preface to Person and Object Chisholm writes \\"The book would not have been completed without the epoch-making File Retrieval and Editing System...\\" Through the diligent work of Alan Hecht, FRESS survived a major OS upgrade around 1978. Around the same time Jonathan Prusky wrote thorough user documentation for the system as well, in The FRESS Resource Manual. Although support had to be withdrawn a few years later for lack of resources and while rarely used, FRESS still runs on the current Brown mainframe. For the ACM Hypertext '89 conference, David Durand reverse-engineered the PDS-1 terminal and created an emulator on Apple Macintosh. He and Steven DeRose, the last FRESS project director, recovered the old poetry class databases and gave live demos on this and a few later occasions.Steven DeRose and Andries van Dam. \\"Document structure and markup in the FRESS hypertext system\\" (sometimes cited as \\"The Lost Books of Hypertext\\").

It is located in the university's campus in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, US. The school offers degrees from the undergraduate through doctoral levels, in addition to executive education programs. The Tepper School of Business, originally known as the Graduate School of Industrial Administration (GSIA), was founded in 1949 by William Larimer Mellon. In March 2004, the school received a record $55 million gift from alumnus David Tepper and was renamed the \\"David A. Tepper School of Business at Carnegie Mellon\\". A number of Nobel Prize‚Äìwinning economists have been affiliated with the school, including Herbert A. Simon, Franco Modigliani, Merton Miller, Robert Lucas, Edward Prescott, Finn Kydland, Oliver Williamson, Dale Mortensen, and Lars Peter Hansen. History In 1946, economist George Bach was hired by the Carnegie Institute of Technology (predecessor of Carnegie Mellon University) to restart the school's economics department. Bach had previously been working at the Federal Reserve during World War II. He added William W. Cooper from the field of Operations Research (which had increased its visibility during the war) and Herbert A. Simon, a political scientist who was to direct the undergraduate business program. The beginnings of the Cold War were applying pressure on the academic community to increase US managerial ability, and when William Larimer Mellon gave a $6 million grant to found a school of industrial administration, Bach became the first dean, bringing along the entire economics department.Mintzburg, Henry. \\"Managers Not MBAs: A hard look at the soft practice of managing and management development\\", Berrett-Koehler Publishers, Inc., San Francisco, California, 2004. Under Bach's leadership, in 1958, the school's Management Game was the first to use computer simulations for experiential learning of business roles; such simulations have subsequently been adopted by other institutions. In 1989, the school's Financial Analysis and Security Trading Center (FAST) was the first educational institution to successfully replicate the live international data feeds and sophisticated software of Wall Street trading firms. Prior to the founding of the Tepper School, management education typically used the case method approach popularized at the Harvard Business School, based upon examples from successful companies and microeconomic theory. Although the Tepper school did not entirely abandon those traditional models and theories, it has focused on management science, or decision making based on quantitative models and an analytical approach. In the 1950s and 1960s, the Tepper School of Business led the intellectual movement known as the Carnegie School, a freshwater economics approach which emphasized behavioral, decision-making, and quantitative methods. As an example, the school has produced nine Nobel Prize winners in Economics: Robert Lucas, Jr., Merton Miller, Franco Modigliani, Herbert A. Simon, Oliver E. Williamson, Edward Prescott, Finn Kydland, Dale Mortensen, and Lars Peter Hansen. Lucas was awarded the prize for developing and applying the theory of rational expectations, an econometric hypothesis that directly challenged Keynesian orthodoxy. Modigliani's prize recognized his life-cycle hypothesis, which attempts to explain the level of saving in the economy. Modigliani proposed that consumers would aim for a stable level of income throughout their lifetime, for example by saving during their working years and spending during their retirement. Miller's prize was awarded in recognition of his contributions to corporate finance. The results of his research‚Äîin collaboration with Franco Modigliani‚Äîare now taught in every business school in the country. Simon's prize was given for his development of the idea of bounded rationality in economics, described as \\"pioneering research into the decision-making process within economic organizations\\". In 2004, Kydland and Prescott received the Nobel Prize for \\"their contributions to dynamic macroeconomics: the time consistency of economic policy and the driving forces behind business cycles\\". On March 19, 2003, David Tepper, founder of hedge fund Appaloosa Management announced that he would make a single donation of $55,000,000 to Carnegie Mellon University's Graduate School of Industrial Administration. This donation was made after he had been encouraged by Kenneth Dunn, his former professor (who became dean of the school). Tepper accepted the suggestion but made the contribution a ‚Äúnaming gift‚Äù and suggested that the school's name be changed to the David A. Tepper School of Business. Further, in November 2013, Carnegie Mellon announced a $67 million gift from Tepper to develop the Tepper Quadrangle on the north campus. The Tepper Quad includes a new Tepper School facility across the street from the Heinz College as well as other university- wide buildings and a welcome center which serves as a public gateway to the university. The Tepper Quad was dedicated on September 13, 2018. David A. Tepper '82, benefactor of the School Two other colleges: the School of Computer Science and the Heinz College were spin-offs by the business school's faculty. Undergraduate Programs The Tepper Quad building, the principal teaching facility at the Tepper School of Business. =Undergraduate Business= The school offers a traditional four-year undergraduate degree in business administration. The program's coursework places an emphasis on quantitative decision making and analytical problem solving. The structure of the undergraduate program is distinctly different from the Master of Business Administration (MBA) program, emphasizing breadth of academic experience over focused professionally oriented courses. Students major in business administration and choose one or two of the following concentration areas to specialize in: In addition to the major in business administration, Tepper requires students to either minor or second major in other programs of the university. In August 2017, Tepper School of Business updated its overload policy. Students will not receive an automatic approval for overloading their course schedule. Rather, students will need to complete a petition to receive an overload approval; the petition is reviewed by the UBA program. Students must have a cumulative QPA of 3.5 through the prior semester or at the end of the fall semester to petition for overload. A course overload is any schedule with more than 50 units in a semester. Students can receive no more than 7 units for a total of 57 units. This change to the Overload Policy impacts Tepper students beginning in Spring 2018. For the academic year ending in May 2007, there were 475 total students enrolled in the undergraduate program. =Undergraduate Economics= The Undergraduate Economics Program is jointly administered by the Tepper School and the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences. It has been designed to prepare students for careers as economic analysts in either the private or public sector, for advanced professional studies in business, law and public policy, as well as for entry into PhD programs in Economics, Finance, and related fields. View of Hamerschlag Hall at Carnegie Mellon University MBA programs The school's primary MBA degree (previously named MSIA) is a two-year, full-time program, during which most students complete an internship in the summer between the first and second year of study. Students have the option of waiving the summer internship and taking classes, which allows full-time students to complete their studies in 16 months. Working professionals in the Pittsburgh area may also complete the MBA degree in the evening as members of the flex-time program. The mini-semester system is half the length of a traditional academic semester, with four mini-semesters per academic year. Each is 7.5 weeks long, and students typically take 5 different courses each mini-semester. This system, which was pioneered by the Tepper School, allows students to take more than 32 different courses while enrolled in the MBA program. The Tepper School prefers this structure as students can gain exposure to a greater breadth of topics, as well as several electives. The MBA curriculum is designed to increase in complexity and application throughout students' time at the Tepper School. The first year builds a fundamental skill set in the core disciplines, including Finance, Operations, Marketing, Strategy, Organizational Behavior and Technology. Year two advances the theories and analytical framework developed in the first year to provide breadth and depth in areas that support corporate strategy and general management as students complete three to four concentrations in specific functional areas. In lieu of selecting three to four general management concentrations, second year students may complete courses in satisfaction of specialized MBA Tracks. The Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship at Tepper holds an annual Venture Competition every spring in three tracks: Technology, Life Sciences, and Sustainable Technology. Teams from many universities and countries compete for cash prizes and venture startup assistance. Entrepreneurship education was pioneered at the school in the 1970s, under the leadership of Dr. Jack Thorne. The Management Game was first introduced by Carnegie Mellon in 1958 and has been adopted by many other business schools as an effective business simulation model. Tepper students work with an external board of directors to manage a multinational corporation, guiding the organization through a wide range of issues including global expansion, labor negotiations, operations, market share, shifting economies and financial performance. The Barco Law Building: Home of the University of Pittsburgh School of Law. The JD/MBA program is the only Tepper School joint degree taught partially outside of Carnegie Mellon. They also have a Capstone project, which is like a culmination of all the students work at Tepper. It is akin to a final year project where the students work with various firms on real world problems. The General Management MBA Track, the core track serves as an umbrella academic option due to the flexibility associated with multiple concentrations. The General Management MBA Track complements the eight other Tepper MBA Tracks: Analytical Marketing Strategy, Biotechnology, Entrepreneurship in Organizations, Global Enterprise Management, Management of Innovation & Product Development, Technology Leadership, Operations Research, and Investment Strategy. Tepper also offers the following joint and dual MBA degrees: For the academic year ending in May 2007, there were 302 total students enrolled in the full-time MBA program. MS Computational Finance A tour group inspects the premises. The MSCF degree is primary granted through a sixteen-month full-time program. The school also offers a thirty-three month part-time degree program and four non- degree certificate programs. Certificate students focus on one \\"stream\\" of the MSCF degree curriculum: Mathematics, Statistics or Financial Computing. The curriculum consists of courses in finance, traditional finance theories of equity and bond portfolio management, the stochastic calculus models on which derivative trading is based, the application of these models in both fixed income markets and equity markets, computational methods including Monte Carlo simulation and finite difference approximations of partial differential equations, and statistical methodologies including regression and time series, culminating with courses on statistical arbitrage, risk management and dynamic asset management. Early in the program, students are taught C++, which enables them to build the computational financial models necessary for their finance courses. The program's capstone is a sophisticated financial computing course. Twenty full-time faculty instruct 40 full-time students in Pittsburgh and 51 full and part-time students in the financial district of New York City. The primary method of instruction for the New York campus is live, interactive video. Lectures are recorded and made immediately available to students via the internet. Faculty teach twice every seven weeks in New York at which times the students are invited to join the professor for lunch after class.  MS Business Analytics  The Tepper School of Business‚Äô online Master of Science in Business Analytics (MSBA) degree is granted through an eighteen-month, mostly online program. Similar to the Tepper School's MBA program, the MSBA curriculum follows a mini-semester system; a mini is the same time requirement as a half-semester. The online format delivers a blend of synchronous learning and asynchronous learning, including weekly live video sessions, recorded video and presentations as well as reading assignments. The first portion of the MSBA program consists of two foundation courses in statistics and programming; these courses are offered in a self-study, pass/fail format. Once students pass these courses, they can move through the rest of the core coursework, which includes courses in machine learning and data mining, optimization, data management, business communication, as well as specific business domains such as analytical marketing, finance, supply chain analytics, and people analytics. To earn their MSBA, students must complete a total of 108 units of coursework, culminating in a capstone project that extends across two minis. The capstone takes the form of a business analytics project, in which students work with a large business data set to develop descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytical models and report their findings to company leaders at project completion. Many of the faculty who teach the online MSBA program also teach on campus at the Tepper School of Business or at CMU's School of Computer Science. Doctoral Program The doctoral degree is organized around a preliminary set of courses in the core disciplines of Economics, Organizational Behavior and Theory, and Operations Research. The foundational knowledge and methodologies that students in the doctoral program learn form the basis for further study and research either in one of the core disciplines, or in one or more of the remaining functional areas of business: Accounting, Financial Economics, Business Technologies, Marketing, or Operations Management. The school also offers PhD degrees jointly with other colleges in the University: *Algorithms, Combinatorics, and Optimization (joint with Mathematics and Computer Science)The Hunt Library at Carnegie Mellon University is the primary source of hardcopy research material for students and faculty at the Tepper School *Behavioral Economics (joint with the Department of Social and Decision Sciences) *Behavioral Marketing and Decision Research (joint with the Department of Social and Decision Sciences) *Economics and Public Policy (joint with the Heinz College) All doctoral candidates receive full tuition, plus a stipend package for five years, through the William Larimer Mellon Fund. Executive Education Tepper Executive Education offers both open enrollment and custom programs for executive leadership training. International study Global Study Abroad The International Management MBA Track features an eight-week global experience in which students travel to Western and Eastern Europe to study emerging, transitional and competitive economies. During study abroad, students experience real-world aspects of classroom work through manufacturing tours, presentations at financial institutions, meetings with government and non- governmental organizations as well as the experience of living in an international setting. This program operates in partnership with the WHU-Otto Beisheim School of Management. Undergraduate business students are also encouraged to explore opportunities to learn about different cultures in which to live and work. Each year students travel abroad as part of a capstone educational experience. Research centers and initiatives From its outset, academic research has been one of the primary focuses of the Tepper School. When speaking of the school's founders, one author stated \\"Research was their fundamental engine of progress\\".Robert E. Gleeson and Steven Schlossman, \\"George Leland Bach and the Rebirth of Graduate Management Education in the United States, 1945-1975.\\" Selections: The Magazine of the Graduate Management Admission Council, 11, No. 3 (Spring 1995), 14. The Tepper School has established 16 different research centers to continue the emphasis on research established at the school's founding. *Accelerate Leadership Center *Tepper Blockchain Initiative *The Carnegie Mellon Electricity Industry Center *Center for Behavioral and Decision Research *Center for Organizational Learning, Innovation and Knowledge *Green Design Institute *PNC Center for Financial Services Innovation *Swartz Center for Entrepreneurship Alexander Henderson Award The Alexander Henderson Award is presented to the student at the Tepper School of Business at Carnegie Mellon University who displays the best work in the field of economic theory. A large proportion of the winners of the award has later made contributions to economics that have changed the practice of the field. Since its inception, four recipients have already been awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics. Among the deceased award winners are John Muth, known as \\"the father of the rational expectations revolution\\"; Albert Ando, among the very pioneers of overlapping-generations models; and Jan Mossin who derived the Capital Asset Pricing Model. Rankings The ranking of MBA programs has been discussed in articles and on academic Web sites. One study found that objectively ranking MBA programs by a combination of graduates' starting salaries and average student Graduate Management Admissions Test (GMAT) score can reasonably duplicate the top 20 list of the national publications. The study concluded that a truly objective ranking would be individualized to the needs of each prospective student.

The Mills Brothers were the first African-American artists to have their own show on national network radio, on CBS in 1930, and they also made appearances in film.Blackpast.org: Mills Brothers, and the first to have a #1 hit on the Billboard singles chart, with Paper Doll in 1943. They were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 1998. Early years The Mills Brothers were born into a family of nine in Piqua, Ohio, United States. The quartet consisted of Donald (lead tenor vocals, April 29, 1915 ‚Äì November 13, 1999)), Herbert (tenor vocals, April 2, 1912 ‚Äì April 12, 1989)), Harry (baritone vocals, August 9, 1913 ‚Äì June 28, 1982), and John Jr. (guitar, double bass, vocals; October 19, 1910 ‚Äì January 23, 1936). Their father, John Hutchinson Mills (February 11, 1882 ‚Äì December 8, 1967), was a barber with his own shop and a barbershop quartet. He was the son of William Hutchinson Mills and Cecilia Simms who lived in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania.The Mills Brothers ‚Äì Pennsylvania Historical Markers on, Waymarking.com, November 5, 2006; retrieved April 10, 2012. As the boys grew older, they began singing in the choir of the Cyrene African Methodist Episcopal Church and in the Park Avenue Baptist Church in Piqua. After lessons at the Spring Street Grammar School, they gathered in front of their father's barbershop or on the corner to perform. They entered an amateur contest at May's Opera House but while on stage Harry realized he had lost his kazoo. He improvised by cupping his hand over his mouth and mimicking the sound of trumpet. The brothers liked the idea and worked it into their act. John, the bass vocalist, would imitate the tuba. Harry, a baritone, imitated the trumpet, Herbert became the second trumpet, and Donald the trombone. John accompanied the four-part harmony on ukulele and then guitar. They practiced imitating orchestras they heard on the radio. Rise to stardom I Ain't Got Nobody (1932) In 1928, after playing May's Opera House in Piqua between Rin Tin Tin features, the brothers accompanied the Harold Greenameyer Band to Cincinnati for an audition with radio station WLW. The station did not hire the band, but did hire the Mills brothers. With the help of Seger Ellis, a WLW Cincinnati DJ, they became local radio stars, and got their major break when Duke Ellington and his Orchestra played a date in Cincinnati. When the youngsters sang for Duke, he called Tommy Rockwell at Okeh Records, who signed them and brought the group to New York City. In September 1930, Ralph Wonders urged broadcasting executive William S. Paley, at CBS Radio in New York, to turn on his office speaker and listen to an audition of four young men. For the audition they were \\"The Mills Brothers,\\" but they had been known by many other names. They were billed as \\"The Steamboat Four\\" when they sang for Sohio. They had been called the \\"Four Boys and a Guitar\\" on their Sunday shows. When Paley heard their performance, he immediately went downstairs and put them on the air. The next day, the Mills Brothers signed a three-year contract and became the first African-Americans to have a network show on radio. Their first recording for Brunswick Records, a cover of the Original Dixieland Jass Band standard \\"Tiger Rag\\", became a nationwide best-seller and a no. 1 hit on the charts in a version with lyrics by Harry DaCosta. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA. Other hits followed ‚Äì \\"Goodbye Blues\\", their theme song, \\"Nobody's Sweetheart\\", \\"Ole Rockin' Chair\\", \\"Lazy River\\", \\"How'm I Doin'\\", and others. They remained on Brunswick until late 1934, when they signed with Decca, where they stayed well into the 1950s. On all of their Brunswick records, as well as the early Deccas, the label stated, \\"No musical instruments or mechanical devices used on this recording other than one guitar\\". Dinah, 1932 They were a hit on CBS in 1930‚Äì1931, particularly when they co-starred on the popular The Fleischmann's Yeast Hour hosted by Rudy Vallee. From 1932 to 1933 they had a radio series in which they were billed as the \\"Four Boys and a Guitar.\\" Before their show announcers explained to listeners that the only instrument was a guitar, as the vocal effects made many listeners think they were brass instruments. The brothers were sponsored by Standard Oil, Procter & Gamble, Crisco, and Crosley Radio. They began appearing in films. Their first, The Big Broadcast (Paramount Pictures, 1932) was an all-star radio revue that included Bing Crosby, Cab Calloway, and the Boswell Sisters. They also made three \\"bouncing ball\\" cartoon shorts for the Fleischer Brothers. Between 1933‚Äì1935, the Brothers starred with Crosby for Woodbury Soap in Bing Crosby Entertains, making 27 appearances in all on the CBS radio show. They also recorded their classics \\"Lazy Bones\\", \\"Sweet Sue\\", \\"Lulu's Back In Town\\", \\"Bye-Bye Blackbird\\", \\"Sleepy Head\\", and \\"Shoe Shine Boy\\". Their film appearances included Twenty Million Sweethearts (Warner Brothers, 1934), Operator 13 (MGM, 1934) and Broadway Gondolier (Warner Brothers, 1935). In 1934, The Mills Brothers became the first African- Americans to give a command performance before British royalty. They performed at the Regal Theatre for a special audience: King George V and Queen Mary. While performing in England, John Jr. became ill. He died in the beginning of 1936. Their father, John Sr. replaced John Jr. as the bass and tuba. At this time, Bernard Addison joined the Brothers as their guitar player. War years Through 1939 the group enjoyed remarkable success in Europe. Herbert recalled, > We left England for the last time just three days before war was declared on > Germany and the only boat we could get was to Australia. We were overseas > from then on except for two months in 1940 and then we went back to South > America. We didn't get back until 1941. In the meantime the Ink Spots were > coming up, and people had sort of forgotten us. In the period between John Jr.'s death and their return to the States, they re-recorded \\"Lazy River\\". It was followed by \\"Someday You'll Want Me to Want You\\", \\"Swing Is the Thing\\", \\"Long About Midnight\\", \\"Organ Grinder's Swing\\", and \\"The Song is Ended\\". They honored Duke Ellington with a swing version of his \\"Caravan,\\" and then produced a series of classic recordings; \\"South of the Border\\", which they performed in a tour of South America, along with \\"Ain't Misbehavin'\\", \\"It Don't Mean a Thing\\", \\"Jeepers Creepers\\", \\"Three Little Fishies\\", and \\"Basin Street Blues\\". During this era, there was also a brief time when the group performed with a non‚Äëfamily singer. Gene Smith served as a stand-in for one year when Harry was drafted into the Army. Although Smith's solo singing did not particularly resemble the group's usual sound, he was able to harmonize well until the fourth brother's return. Smith is noticeable in a number of the Mills Brothers' film appearances. Returning to the States, the Brothers were anxious for a hit and recorded \\"I'll be Around\\" in 1943. Donald Mills chose \\"Paper Doll\\" as the B-side of the record. \\"I'll Be Around\\" became a hit, then a disk jockey turned the record over. \\"Paper Doll\\", recorded in fifteen minutes, sold six million copies and became the group's biggest hit. Postwar years The rise of rock and roll did little to decrease the Mills Brothers popularity. \\"Glow Worm\\" jumped to number two on the pop charts in 1952. \\"Opus One\\", an updated version to the Tommy Dorsey hit, was soon on the charts as well, followed by \\"You're Nobody till Somebody Loves You\\", \\"The Jones Boy\\", \\"Yellow Bird\\", \\"Standing on the Corner\\", and \\"If I Had My Way\\". The track also peaked at No. 10 in the UK Singles Chart in January 1953. It was the fifth million selling record for the Mills Brothers. In 1956, John Sr., when he was 68, stopped touring with the group. As a trio, the Mills Brothers were frequent guests on television talk shows and variety shows. After leaving Decca for Dot Records, they had a hit in 1958 with a cover version of \\"Get a Job\\" by The Silhouettes. They reached the charts with \\"Yellow Bird\\" two years before Arthur Lyman's version was a Top Ten hit. \\"Cab Driver\\", written by Carson Parks and recorded in 1968, was their last hit (No. 23 Pop, No. 3 Easy Listening). Later years The Mills Brothers' fiftieth anniversary in show business was celebrated in 1976 with a tribute at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles, hosted by Bing Crosby. At the time, Harry was now almost blind because of diabetes. As a trio, Herbert, Harry and Donald continued performing on the oldies circuit until Harry's death in 1982. Herbert and Donald continued until Herbert's death in 1989. Then, Donald began performing with his son, John II. In 1998 the Recording Academy recognized the Mills family's contributions to popular music when it presented Donald, as the sole surviving member, with a Grammy Award for Lifetime Achievement. After Donald's death of pneumonia on November 13, 1999, John II became the next family member to tour under the name \\"The Mills Brothers\\" with Elmer Hopper, who had previously sung lead with Paul Robi's Platters. They were at times joined by John II's eldest brother, Don Mills, Jr. Image:WIKI_MILLS_BROTHERS_1.jpg The Mills Brothers in concert, March 2005 Image:WIKI_MILLS_BROTHERS_2.jpg John Mills, son, grandson and nephew of the original group‚Äôs members Image:WIKI_MILLS_BROTHERS_3.jpg Elmer Hopper, who spent 21 years with The Platters On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed The Mills Brothers among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.

He was the son of Pepin of Landen and the brother of saints Begga and Gertrude of Nivelles.  Life  Bavo was born near Li√®ge, to a Frankish noble family that gave him the name Allowin.Butler, Alban, The Lives of the Saints, Vol. X,1866 His father was Pippin of Landen, the Mayor of the Palace of Austrasia, and his mother Itta of Metz. A wild, young aristocrat of Brabant, he contracted a beneficial marriage, and had a daughter. He was a soldier who led an undisciplined and disorderly life. Shortly after the death of his wife, Bavo decided to reform after hearing a sermon preached by Saint Amand on the emptiness of material things. On returning to his house he distributed his wealth to the poor, and then received the tonsure from Amand.Hinds, Allen Banks ‚ÄúSaint Bavon‚Äù. A Garner of Saints, 1900. CatholicSaints.Info. 17 April 2017 For some time thereafter, Bavo joined Amand in the latter's missionary travels throughout France and Flanders. On one occasion, Bavo met a man whom he had sold into slavery years before. Wishing to atone for his earlier deed, Bavo had the man lead him by a chain to the town jail. Bavo built an abbey on his grounds and became a monk. He distributed his belongings to the poor and lived as a recluse, first in a hollow tree and later in a cell in the forest by the Abbey. He died at the Abbey in Ghent, in what is today Belgium.  Veneration  Bavo is the patron saint of Ghent, Zellik, and Lauwe in Belgium, and Haarlem in the Netherlands. His feast in the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church is October 1. He is most often shown in Christian art as a knight with a sword and falcon. The most popular scene is the moment of his conversion, which has many stories attached to it. Because he is so often shown with a falcon, he came to be considered the patron saint of falconry. In medieval Ghent, taxes were paid on Bavo's feast day, and it is for this reason he is often shown holding a purse or money bag. According to Rodulfus Glaber, the city of Bamberg is named after him, with Bamberg meaning \\"Mount of Bavo\\".  Legacy  Several churches are dedicated to him, including: * Saint Bavo Cathedral, in GhentSaint-Bavo's Cathedral - Ghent * Sint-Bavokerk and Cathedral of Saint Bavo, both in Haarlem * Sint-Bavokerk in Heemstede, Lauwe, and Zellik * Saint Bavo Church and School, in Mishawaka, IndianaSt. Bavo's Catholic Church, Mishawaka, Indiana * Sint-Bavokerk in Wilrijk His picture is also part of the Coat of Arms of the Antwerp suburb Wilrijk.

Christopher Brown II is the current president of Kentucky State University in Frankfort, Kentucky and past president of Alcorn State University.  About M. Christopher Brown II  M. Christopher Brown II is the 18th president of Kentucky State University, the second oldest state-supported institution of higher learning in Kentucky. He previously served as president of the nation‚Äôs first historically black land-grant institution, Alcorn State University, and was the inaugural Executive Vice President and Provost of the Southern University System and Southern University flagship campus. He held the same position at Fisk University, where he was also a professor. Prior to this appointment, he served as dean of the College of Education at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, vice president for Programs and Administration at the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education, director of Social Justice and Professional Development for the American Educational Research Association, as well as executive director and chief research scientist of the Frederick D. Patterson Research Institute of the United Negro College Fund. Brown has held faculty appointments at Pennsylvania State University, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and the University of Missouri- Kansas City.  Alcorn State University Presidency  Brown was named president of Alcorn State University in November 2010. In three years with the university, Brown was regarded for efforts to increase enrollment at the historically black college, which grew to more than 4,000 for the first time in the school's history in 2011.http://www.aplu.org/document.doc?id=4667 In October 2012, months after Alcorn was named 'HBCU of the Year' by the Center for HBCU Media Advocacy, Brown accepted a unanimous four-year extension of his contract from the Mississippi Institutions of Higher Learning Board of Trustees. In September 2012, Brown hired Jay Hopson as the first white head football coach in the history of Alcorn State, and the Southwestern Athletic Conference. In 2014, Hopson and the Braves won the school's first SWAC conference football championship in 20 years. In 2013, under Brown's leadership, Alcorn State University unveiled a statue of civil rights activist and ASU alumnus Medgar Evers, the largest of its kind in the world. That same year, Brown was named HBCU Male President of the Year by the Center for HBCU Media Advocacy. Brown resigned from Alcorn State University in 2013 following allegations of improper procurement practices for campus event contracts and facility renovations by the Mississippi Institutions of Higher Learning. State higher education and law enforcement officials never published direct connections of wrongdoing to Brown‚Äôs authorization of contracts, and did not file charges against or require reimbursement from any current or former employees.

Founded in 1958 (with classes beginning in fall 1960), the school integrates education with biblical faith and service to God and humanity. The college is physically located on two separate campuses totalling 267 acres (1.1 km¬≤). OVU offers bachelor's degrees in more than 30 different subject areas. Although it is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission, the university is currently on probation. History In 1956 several alumni of Harding University formed a committee to establish a Christian college in the West Virginia area. A foundation was formed to solicit funds for the future college.OVU History On September 14, 1960, the Ohio Valley College opened with classes being offered at South Parkersburg Church of Christ. In 1963 the South Campus opened with an administrative and classroom building on 133 acres (538,000 m¬≤) between Parkersburg and Vienna which had been purchased in 1958. Two dormitories were opened that same year. An additional dormitory and library were built in 1966. Three years later an auditorium and student center opened. A cafeteria and student center opened in the 1979-80 school year. An athletic complex was built in 1992. In 1994 the college doubled its campus size with the purchase of 134 acres (542,000 m¬≤) and a four storied building from the Roman Catholic Diocese of Wheeling-Charleston, West Virginia. This separate campus became the North Campus. The new campus contained two auditoriums, several classrooms, cafeteria, dining and conference rooms, dormitory with 225 beds, a chapel, and two athletic fields. The school renovated the North Campus facility and constructed two new dormitories with a connecting lobby in 2003. In 2005 the college changed its name to Ohio Valley University. Student life All full- time students must attend daily Chapel services, and first-year dormitory residents follow a curfew system. Ohio Valley University does not have national fraternities and sororities. Instead, the school has localized social clubs (co-ed at OVU). There are currently four social clubs - Delta, Kappa, Alpha, and Zeta. Clubs compete in intramural activities, service projects and Expressionsa musical concert held annually in the Spring. A full-service cafeteria is located in the campus's Stotts Administrative Building. The university offers opportunities in several performing groups. These groups include the OVU Singers, which is composed of approximately 32 singers. This group performs at congregations, youth rallies, and other venues. The Ambassadors is a dramatic group which travels around to youth rallies, camps, and other church related events. The OVU Jazz Ensemble is an integrated group of students and community members composed of woodwind, brass, and string ensembles and groups of a variety of instrumentation. The Ensemble performs at two on campus concerts a year and frequently give performances for the community. Express is the college's contemporary Christian a cappella performing group. This group performs at over 200 events per year. Academics OVU stresses a Christian world view throughout its educational endeavors, and all students must complete an instructional Bible component each semester. The institution has 35 different degree tracks and 33 minor concentrations within the Colleges of Business, Biblical Education, Education, and Arts and Sciences. In recent years, OVU has put significant effort into becoming a 21st Century center of academic innovation and excellence, and to that end has a number of unique programs in place, with more planned. Among the highlights are the Integrated Marketing and Communications degree program, which came online in 2018. Energy is a major focus at OVU, in part as an outgrowth of the growing oil and gas industry in West Virginia and southeastern Ohio. OVU is also affiliated with the ACE Educational Foundation, which has led efforts to construct a 90-100 megawatt clean coal gasification plant in Vienna, West Virginia by 2020. In addition to becoming a major revenue generator for the local community, the plant is expected to serve as a location where undergraduates can learn strong business practices and learn how a functioning power plant operates. Part of the effort includes making practical use of excess carbon dioxide in an on-site aquaculture greenhouse through a partnership with ECSIA. In June 2020, the Higher Learning Commission placed the university on probation for failure to comply with the accreditation standard related to adequate finances. The commission will reevaluate if the institution has demonstrated if it is compliance with the criteria for accreditation and if probation can be removed in June 2022. https://www.hlcommission.org/download/_PublicDisclosureNotices/Public%20Disclosure%20Notice%20-%20Ohio%20Valley%20University%206.30.20.pdf Athletics The school's sports teams are known as the Fighting Scots and compete in the Great Midwest Athletic Conference (G-MAC). The school is the smallest member of the NCAA's Division II. All athletic teams compete in the GMAC conference. Since moving to NCAA Division II in 2000, the Fighting Scots have captured four conference championships (Men's Golf 2003, 2009; Women's Golf 2010; Baseball 2006). The OVU women's volleyball team reached the G-MAC championship in 2014 and was defeated in the final game by reigning champion, Cedarville University. Men's and Women's soccer teams also made conference tournament appearances in 2017 and 2018 under coach Luis Rincon. During the 2018-19 school year, the school brought back the Cheerleading program. The OVU Cheerleading Squad cheers for Men's and Women's Basketball games. The WVIAC announced its dissolution following the 2012‚Äì13 school year, and during the initial stages of this process, OVU found a new conference home in the Great Midwest Athletic Conference (G-MAC) in the fall of 2013. The Scots, along with Alderson-Broaddus, Davis & Elkins, and Salem International will all enter the G-MAC. =Men's= Baseball * Basketball * Cross Country * Golf * Wrestling * Soccer * Track and Field =Women's= Basketball * Cross Country * Golf * Soccer * Softball * Volleyball * Track and Field References External linksOfficial website Educational institutions established in 1958 Private universities and colleges in West Virginia Schools in Wood County, West Virginia Universities and colleges affiliated with the Churches of Christ 1958 establishments in West Virginia ","title":"Ohio Valley University"},{"id":"30876715","text":"Unburnt hydrocarbons (UHCs) are the hydrocarbons emitted after petroleum is burned in an engine.

GNOME Videos uses the Clutter and GTK+ toolkits. It is officially included in GNOME starting from version 2.10 (released in March 2005), but de facto it was already included in most GNOME environments. Totem utilizes the GStreamer framework for playback, though until version 2.27.1, it could alternatively be configured to use the Xine libraries instead of GStreamer. GNOME Videos is free and open-source software subject to the requirements of the GNU General Public License. Features Until recently there were two distinct versions of Totem, though the difference was not visible at the user interface level. One of them was based on GStreamer, which is a plugin-based multimedia framework. This version has superior extensibility and supports a larger variety of media formats. The other one was based on xine, which is a regular multimedia library. At the time the latter had better encrypted DVD playback support, DVD navigation support and could play some files the GStreamer version couldn't handle. Due to enhancements in GStreamer including the ability to play back encrypted DVDs, the Totem development team dropped support for the xine backend. Totem is closely integrated with the GNOME desktop environment and its file manager, GNOME Files. This includes generating thumbnails of video files when browsing in GNOME Files and a video plugin for Netscape-compatible browsers (e.g. Firefox and GNOME Web). Thanks to a large number of plugins developed for GStreamer, Totem is able to play all mainstream media formats, both open and proprietary ones. It also understands numerous playlist formats, including SHOUTcast, M3U, XML Shareable Playlist Format (XSPF), SMIL, Windows Media Player playlists and RealAudio playlists. Playlists are easily manageable using drag-and-drop features. Full-screen video playback is supported on nearly all X configurations, including multi-head Xinerama setups, and on displays connected to the TV-Out. Brightness, contrast and saturation of the video can be dynamically adjusted during playback. 4.0, 4.1, 5.0, 5.1 and stereophonic sound is supported. On computers with an infrared port, Totem can be remotely controlled via LIRC. Stills can be easily captured without resorting to external programs. There is also a plugin for telestrator-like functionality using Gromit. The loading of external SubRip subtitles, both automatic and manual (via the command-line), is also supported. The player was known as Totem. With the release of version 3.5.90, the name was changed to Videos. The name 'Totem', remained in 'de facto' use (the executable, for example, still uses the Totem name, as does its package in Debian). GNOME 3.12 revamped the user interface radically and added support for direct playback from online video channels such as Guardian and Apple trailers. A screenshot of the player's old interface, used up to version 3.10 = Video acceleration = Whether GNOME Videos can offload computations for video decoding to SIP blocks such as PureVideo, UVD, QuickSync Video, TI Ducati through interfaces, like e.g. VDPAU, VAAPI, Distributed Codec Engine or DXVA depends entirely on the back-end.

Founded in the early 1970s by Stephen Marks who also serves as chairman and chief executive, it is based in London and its parent French Connection Group PLC is listed on the London Stock Exchange. French Connection distributes its clothing and accessories through its own stores in the UK, US and Canada and through franchise and wholesale arrangements globally. The company became notorious for the use of the \\"fcuk\\" initialism in its advertising campaigns in the early 2000s. Other brands currently within the group include Great Plains, Toast and YMC. Former brands include Nicole Farhi. Brand history Stephen Marks, who started out in business in 1969 as the Stephen Marks brand, established French Connection in 1972 ‚Äì a year after the film of the same name was released. Initially designed as a mid-market women's brand, he has said the name came about because he managed to acquire a large shipment of Indian cheesecloth shirts ‚Äì via a French contact ‚Äì that could be resold in the UK at a large profit. The business expanded into menswear in 1976.Simon Mills, 'The man from FCUK', MailOnline, undated. Retrieved 2013-02-06. In 1978, Nicole Farhi joined French Connection as a designer. In 1983, her eponymous higher- end label was launched by the French Connection parent group and this was not sold until 2010. After Marks floated the French Connection brand on the London Stock Exchange in 1984, he was listed as the 15th richest man in Britain, but by the late 1980s the company was in trouble. He took control of the direction of French Connection again in 1991. In 2017, French Connection appointed two new independent directors, after facing pressure from investors. In February 2017, Sports Direct bought Schroders' 11% stake in French Connection. =FCUK branding controversy= French Connection store in Covent Garden, London French Connection began using the branding \\"fcuk\\" (usually written in lowercase) in advertising after 1991 when Marks regained control. Reportedly, the first use of the initialism was on faxes sent between Hong Kong and London offices, headed \\"FCHK to FCUK\\". Marks said in a subsequent interview that the faxes were not intended to be rude. The advertising campaign came about after he was so impressed by a bra advert featuring Eva Herzigov√° that he contacted the advertising executive behind it, Trevor Beattie, even though the company did not have a budget for an advertising campaign at the time. It was Beattie who spotted the marketing potential of the initialism and a campaign was launched around it. Being deliberately similar to the taboo word \\"fuck\\", French Connection's use of \\"fcuk\\" caused widespread controversy. In addition, there was heavy criticism that French Connection and other advertisers are \\"free to put up offensive posters, gain huge impact from them, and then - when they are ordered down (often after the campaign has run its course) - to notch up even more publicity\\".Time called on FCUK posters, BBC News, 2001-04-04. Retrieved on 2007-07-15 Following a number of complaints about advertising campaigns using the initialism, the UK's Advertising Standards Authority requested that the company submit all poster campaigns for approval before running them.

Injecting fertilizer  Although CULTAN fertilization is only done for nitrogen application, injection irrigation can also be used for other types of fertilizers. The most common way to inject fertilizer into the ground, regardless of chemical type, is through the drip method. The drip method involves an irrigation pump and a chemical injection pump.

If farming on a large scale, an engine (such as a tractor) is needed to move the system across the field.  Advantages  According to a study from the Czech Republic, injecting nitrogen into the soil leads for a higher dry matter content of the plant.Kozlovsky, O. ‚ÄúInfluence of nitrogen fertilizer injection (CULTAN) on yield, yield components formation and quality of winter wheat grain‚Äù Dry matter content is important because the nutrients found in plants are found in the ‚Äòdry‚Äô section, not the water that is also in the plant. CULTAN fertilization, like all forms of injection fertilization, allows for a more precise application and a more uniform distribution of the fertilizer. These methods allow the spread of nitrogen regardless of the condition of the field (wet, muddy) and reduce soil compaction caused by tractors moving along the field. Soil compaction can eventually lead to erosion. Labor is also significantly reduced when compared to convention, surface fertilization.  Disadvantages  Research has shown that average total yield is lower in crops that have been injected with nitrogen. The equipment used to inject fertilizer into the ground is more expensive than the typical spraying equipment, so injection is mostly used on smaller produce operations.

The most common symptoms include painful mouth sores, genital sores, inflammation of parts of the eye, and arthritis. The sores typically last a few days. Less commonly there may be inflammation of the brain or spinal cord, blood clots, aneurysms, or blindness. Often the symptoms come and go. The cause is unknown. It is believed to be partly genetic. Beh√ßet's is not contagious. Diagnosis is based on at least three episodes of mouth sores in a year together with at least two of the following: genital sores, eye inflammation, skin sores, a positive skin prick test. There is no cure. Treatments may include immunosuppressive medication such as corticosteroids and lifestyle changes. Lidocaine mouthwash may help with the pain. Colchicine may decrease the frequency of attacks. The condition often improves with the passage of time. While rare in the United States and Europe, it is more common in the Middle East and Asia. In Turkey, for example, about 2 per 1,000 are affected. Onset is usually in a person's 20s or 40s. The disease was initially described by Turkish dermatologist Hulusi Beh√ßet in 1937.  Signs and symptoms  = Skin and mucosa = Nearly all people with Beh√ßet's disease present with some form of painful ulcerations inside the mouth. They are a form of aphthous ulcers or non-scarring oral lesions. The oral lesions are similar to those found in inflammatory bowel disease and can be relapsing. Painful genital ulcerations usually develop around the anus, vulva, or scrotum and cause scarring in 75 percent of the patients. Additionally, patients may present with erythema nodosum, cutaneous pustular vasculitis, and lesions similar to pyoderma gangrenosum. = Eyes = Funduscopic photo left eye centered on the optic disc A person with hypopyon which can be seen in anterior uveitis in a person with Beh√ßet's disease Inflammatory eye disease can develop early in the disease course and lead to permanent vision loss in 20 percent of cases. Ocular involvement can be in the form of posterior uveitis, anterior uveitis, or retinal vasculitis. Anterior uveitis presents with painful eyes, conjuctival redness, hypopyon, and decreased visual acuity, while posterior uveitis presents with painless decreased visual acuity and visual field floaters. A rare form of ocular (eye) involvement in this syndrome is retinal vasculitis which presents with painless decrease of vision with the possibility of floaters or visual field defects. Optic nerve involvement in Beh√ßet's disease is rare, typically presenting as progressive optic atrophy and visual loss. However, cases of acute optic neuropathy (specifically anterior ischemic optic neuropathy) have also been reported to occur. Optic nerve atrophy has been identified as the most common cause of visual impairment. Beh√ßet's disease may result in primary or secondary optic nerve involvement. Papilledema as a result of dural sinus thrombosis and atrophy resulting from retinal disease, have been characterized as secondary causes of optic nerve atrophy in Beh√ßet's disease. Signs and symptoms of acute optic neuropathy include painless loss of vision which may affect either one or both eyes, reduced visual acuity, reduced color vision, relative afferent pupillary defect, central scotoma, swollen optic disc, macular edema, or retrobulbar pain. When these symptoms occur with concurrent mucocutaneous ulcerations, they raise suspicion of acute optic neuropathy in Beh√ßet's Disease. Progressive optic atrophy may result in decreased visual acuity or color vision. Intracranial hypertension with papilledema may be present. Episcleritis may occur, which causes eye redness and mild pain, without a significant impact on vision. = Bowels = GI manifestations include abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea with or without blood, and they often involve the ileocecal valve. Many patients with BD often complain about abdominal tenderness, bloating, and generic abdominal discomfort that closely mimics irritable bowel syndrome. = Lungs = Lung involvement is typically in the form of hemoptysis, pleuritis, cough, or fever, and in severe cases can be life-threatening if the outlet pulmonary artery develops an aneurysm which ruptures causing severe vascular collapse and death from bleeding in the lungs. Nodules, consolidations, cavities and ground glass lesions are common in patients with pulmonary involvement.Hatemi G, Seyahi E, Fresko I, Hamuryudan V (2012) Beh√ßet's syndrome: a critical digest of the recent literature. Clin Exp Rheumatol Pulmonary artery thrombosis may occur. = Joints = Arthritis is seen in up to half of people, and is usually a non- erosive poly or oligoarthritis primarily of the large joints of the lower extremities. = Brain = CNS involvement most often occurs as a chronic meningoencephalitis. Lesions tend to occur in the brainstem, the basal ganglia and deep hemispheric white matter and may resemble those of MS. Brainstem atrophy is seen in chronic cases. Neurological involvements range from aseptic meningitis to vascular thrombosis such as dural sinus thrombosis and organic brain syndrome manifesting with confusion, seizures, and memory loss. Sudden hearing loss (Sensorineural) is often associated with it. They often appear late in the progression of the disease but are associated with a poor prognosis. = Heart = Pericarditis is a frequent cardiac manifestation. Chronic aortic regurgitation due to aortic root disease may also be seen. = Blood vessels = Blood vessel problems are observed in 7‚Äì29% of people with arterial lesions representing 15% of vascular lesions. Arterial lesions pose a greater risk. Most common arterial lesions are occlusions or stenosis and aneurysms or pseudoaneurysms.  Cause  The cause is not well-defined, but it is primarily characterized by auto-inflammation of the blood vessels. Although sometimes erroneously referred to as a diagnosis of exclusion, the diagnosis can sometimes be reached by pathologic examination of the affected areas. The primary mechanism of the damage is autoimmune, which by definition is an overactive immune system that targets the patient's own body. The involvement of a subset of T cells (Th17) seems to be important. The primary cause is not well known. In fact, no one knows yet why the immune system starts to behave this way in Beh√ßet's disease. There does however seem to be a genetic component involved, as first degree relatives of the affected patients are often affected in more than the expected proportion for the general population. Research suggests that previous infections may provoke the autoimmune responses present in Beh√ßet's disease. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are present in some bacteria and serve as a \\"danger signal\\" to the immune system. However, some HSPs share a similarity in bacteria and humans. The anti-HSP60 and anti-HSP65 antibodies that target HSPs produced by Streptococci (including S. sanguinis and S. pyogenes) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis can also target human HSPs, leading to immune responses linked to uveitis and various symptoms shown in parenchymal neuro-Beh√ßet's disease. An association with the GIMAP (\\"GTPase of the immunity-associated protein\\") family of genes on the long arm of chromosome 7 (7q36.1) has been reported. The genes implicated were GIMAP1, GIMAP2 and GIMAP4.  Pathophysiology  HLA-B51 is strongly associated with Beh√ßet's disease Beh√ßet's disease is considered more prevalent in the areas surrounding the old silk trading routes in the Middle East and in Central Asia. Thus, it is sometimes known as Silk Road disease. However, this disease is not restricted to people from these regions. A large number of serological studies show a linkage between the disease and HLA-B51. HLA-B51 is more frequently found from the Middle East to South Eastern Siberia, but the incidence of B51 in some studies was 3 fold higher than the normal population. However, B51 tends not to be found in disease when a certain SUMO4 gene variant is involved, and symptoms appear to be milder when HLA-B27 is present. At the current time, a similar infectious origin has not yet been confirmed that leads to Beh√ßet's disease, but certain strains of S. sanguinis has been found to have a homologous antigenicity. Vasculitis resulting in occlusion of the vessels supplying the optic nerve may be the cause of acute optic neuropathy and progressive optic atrophy in Beh√ßet's disease. Histological evaluation in a reported case of acute optic neuropathy demonstrated substitution of the axonal portion of the optic nerve with fibrous astrocytes without retinal changes. CNS involvement in Beh√ßet's disease may lead to intracranial hypertension most commonly due to dural venous sinus thrombosis and subsequent secondary optic atrophy.  Diagnosis  There is no specific pathological testing or technique available for the diagnosis of the disease, although the International Study Group criteria for the disease are highly sensitive and specific, involving clinical criteria and a pathergy test. Beh√ßet's disease has a high degree of resemblance to diseases that cause mucocutaneous lesions such as Herpes simplex labialis, and therefore clinical suspicion should be maintained until all the common causes of oral lesions are ruled out from the differential diagnosis. Visual acuity, or color vision loss with concurrent mucocutaneous lesions or systemic Beh√ßet's disease symptoms should raise suspicion of optic nerve involvement in Beh√ßet's disease and prompt a work-up for Beh√ßet's disease if not previously diagnosed in addition to an ocular work-up. Diagnosis of Beh√ßet's disease is based on clinical findings including oral and genital ulcers, skin lesions such as erythema nodosum, acne, or folliculitis, ocular inflammatory findings and a pathergy reaction. Inflammatory markers such ESR, and CRP may be elevated. A complete ophthalmic examination may include a slit lamp examination, optical coherence tomography to detect nerve loss, visual field examinations, fundoscopic examination to assess optic disc atrophy and retinal disease, fundoscopic angiography, and visual evoked potentials, which may demonstrate increased latency. Optic nerve enhancement may be identified on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in some patients with acute optic neuropathy. However, a normal study does not rule out optic neuropathy. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis may demonstrate elevated protein level with or without pleocytosis. Imaging including angiography may be indicated to identify dural venous sinus thrombosis as a cause of intracranial hypertension and optic atrophy. = Diagnostic guidelines = Magnetic resonance venogram demonstrating occlusion of the left sigmoid and transverse sinuses According to the International Study Group guidelines, for a patient to be diagnosed with Beh√ßet's disease, the patient must have oral (aphthous) ulcers (any shape, size, or number at least 3 times in any 12 months period) along with 2 out of the following 4 \\"hallmark\\" symptoms: * eye inflammation (iritis, uveitis, retinal vasculitis, cells in the vitreous) * genital ulcers (including anal ulcers and spots in the genital region and swollen testicles or epididymitis in men) * pathergy reaction (papule >2 mm dia. 24‚Äì48 hrs or more after needle-prick). The pathergy test has a specificity of 95 percent to 100 percent, but the results are often negative in American and European patients * skin lesions (papulo-pustules, folliculitis, erythema nodosum, acne in post-adolescents not on corticosteroids) Despite the inclusive criteria set forth by the International Study Group, there are cases where not all the criteria can be met and therefore a diagnosis cannot readily be made. There is however a set of clinical findings that a physician can rely upon in making a tentative diagnosis of the disease; essentially Beh√ßet's disease does not always follow the International Study Group guidelines and so a high degree of suspicion for a patient who presents having any number of the following findings is necessary: * arthritis/arthralgia * cardio-vascular problems of an inflammatory origin * changes of personality, psychoses * deep vein thrombosis * epididymitis * extreme exhaustion - chronic fatigue * inflammatory problems in chest and lungs * mouth ulcers * nervous system symptoms * problems with hearing or balance * stomach or bowel inflammation * superficial thrombophlebitis * any other members of the family with a diagnosis of Beh√ßet's disease.  Treatment  Current treatment is aimed at easing the symptoms, reducing inflammation, and controlling the immune system. The quality of the evidence for treating the oral ulcers associated with Beh√ßet's disease, however, is poor. High-dose corticosteroid therapy is often used for severe disease manifestations.CMDT (Current Medical Diagnosis & Treatment) 2007, Chapter 20, page 872 Anti-TNF therapy such as infliximab has shown promise in treating the uveitis associated with the disease. Another Anti-TNF agent, etanercept, may be useful in people with mainly skin and mucosal symptoms. Apremilast may also be used to treat oral ulcers associated with Beh√ßet's disease. Interferon alpha-2a may also be an effective alternative treatment, particularly for the genital and oral ulcers as well as ocular lesions. Azathioprine, when used in combination with interferon alpha-2b also shows promise, and colchicine can be useful for treating some genital ulcers, erythema nodosum, and arthritis. Benzathine‚Äêpenicillin may also reduce new arthritic attacks. Thalidomide has also been used due to its immune-modifying effect. Dapsone and rebamipide have been shown, in small studies, to have beneficial results for mucocutaneous lesions. Given its rarity, the optimal treatment for acute optic neuropathy in Beh√ßet's disease has not been established. Early identification and treatment are essential. Response to ciclosporin, periocular triamcinolone, and IV methylprednisone followed by oral prednisone has been reported although relapses leading to irreversible visual loss may occur even with treatment. Immunosuppressants such as interferon-alpha and tumour necrosis factor antagonists may improve though not completely reverse symptoms of ocular Beh√ßet's disease, which may progress over time despite treatment. When symptoms are limited to the anterior chamber of the eye prognosis is improved. Posterior involvement, particularly optic nerve involvement, is a poor prognostic indicator. Secondary optic nerve atrophy is frequently irreversible. Lumbar puncture or surgical treatment may be required to prevent optic atrophy in cases of intracranial hypertension refractory to treatment with immunomodulators and steroids. IVIG could be a treatment for severe or complicated cases. = Surgery = Surgical treatment of arterial manifestations of BD bears many pitfalls since the obliterative endarteritis of vasa vasorum causes thickening of the medial layer and splitting of elastin fibers. Therefore, anastomotic pseudoaneurysms are likely to form, as well as pseudoaneurysms at the site of the puncture in case of angiography or endovascular treatment; furthermore, early graft occlusion may occur. For these reasons, invasive treatment should not be performed in the acute and active phases of the disease when inflammation is at its peak. The evaluation of disease's activity is usually based on relapsing symptoms, ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate), and serum levels of CRP (C‚Äêreactive protein). Endovascular treatment can be an effective and safe alternative to open surgery, with less postoperative complications, faster recovery time, and reduced need for intensive care, while offering patency rates and procedural success rates comparable with those of surgery. This notwithstanding, long‚Äêterm results of endovascular treatment in BD are still to be determined.  Epidemiology  The syndrome is rare in the United States, Africa and South America, but is common in the Middle East and Asia, suggesting a possible cause endemic to those tropical areas. A theory suggested that past exposure to lethal infectious agents might have fixed the genetic susceptibility factors to Beh√ßet's disease in those area. An estimated 15,000 to 20,000 Americans have been diagnosed with this disease. In the UK, it is estimated to have about 1 case for every 100,000 people. Globally, males are affected more frequently than females. In an epidemiologic study, 56 percent of patients with Beh√ßet's disease developed ocular involvement at a mean age of 30. Ocular involvement was the first manifestation of Beh√ßet's disease in 8.6 percent of patients. Ocular Beh√ßet's disease with involvement of the optic nerve is rarely reported. Among patients with ocular Beh√ßet's disease funduscopic findings of optic atrophy, and optic disc paleness have been identified with a frequency of 17.9 percent and 7.4 percent, respectively. Other fundoscopic findings include vascular sheathing (23.7%), retinal hemorrhage (9%), macular edema (11.3%), branch retinal vein occlusion (5.8%), and retinal edema (6.6%). However, optic atrophy was the most significant cause of visual impairment identified in 54 percent of patients with ocular Beh√ßet's disease and permanent visual impairment. The prevalence of this disease increases from North to South. It follows a more severe course in patients with an early age of onset particularly in patients with eye and gastrointestinal involvement.  Pregnancy  With Beh√ßet's disease as a pre-existing disease in pregnancy or acquired, the pregnancy does not have an adverse effect on the course of Beh√ßet's disease and may possibly ameliorate its course. Still, there is a substantial variability in clinical course between patients and even for different pregnancies in the same patient. Also, the other way around, Beh√ßet's disease confers an increased risk of pregnancy complications, miscarriage and Cesarean section. Beh√ßet's can cause male infertility, either as a result of the condition itself or of a side effect of concomitant medication such as Colchicine, which is known to lower sperm count.Beh√ßet's disease ‚Äì Treatment from National Health Service. Page last reviewed: 22 August 2012  History  The first modern formal description of the symptoms was made by H.Planner and F.Remenovsky and published in 1922 in the Archiv f√ºr Dermatologie und Syphilis. Beh√ßet's disease is named after Hulusi Beh√ßet (1889‚Äì1948), the Turkish dermatologist and scientist who first recognized the three main symptoms of the syndrome in one of his patients in 1924 and reported his research on the disease in Journal of Skin and Venereal Diseases in 1936. Reproduced in The name (Morbus Beh√ßet) was formally adopted at the International Congress of Dermatology in Geneva in September 1947. Symptoms of this disease may have been described by Hippocrates in the 5th century BC, in his Epidemion (book 3, case 7). Some sources use the term \\"Adamantiades's syndrome\\" or \\"Adamantiades‚ÄìBeh√ßet syndrome\\", for the work done by Benediktos Adamantiades.B. Adamandiades. Sur un cas d'iritis √† hypopyon r√©cidivant. Annales d'oculistique, Paris, 1931, 168: 271‚Äì278. However, the current World Health Organization/ICD-10 standard is \\"Beh√ßet's disease\\". In 1991, Saudi Arabian medical researchers described neuro-Beh√ßet's disease, a neurological involvement in Beh√ßet's disease, considered one of the most devastating manifestations of the disease. The mechanism can be immune-mediated or thrombotic. The term dates back to at least 1990.

As a result, the plant exhibits a reaction of phototropism directional growth (2.) toward the light stimulus. thumbnailAuxin distribution controls phototropism. 1\\\\. Sunlight strikes the plant from directly above. Auxin (pink dots) encourages growth straight up. 2, 3, 4. Sunlight strikes the plant at an angle. Auxin is concentrated on one side, encouraging growth at an angle from the preceding stem. Daisies (Bellis perennis) facing the sun after opening in the morning, and they follow the sun through the day The Thale Cress (Arabidopsis thaliana) is regulated by blue to UV light. Phycomyces, a fungus, also exhibit phototropism Example on a Phalaenopsis Example on Azuki beans Ravenalas growing between two buildings in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo. The plane (here perpendicular to the north-south axis) of these two plants is orientated to maximize daylight absorption. Phototropism is the growth of an organism in response to a light stimulus. Phototropism is most often observed in plants, but can also occur in other organisms such as fungi. The cells on the plant that are farthest from the light have a chemical called auxin that reacts when phototropism occurs. This causes the plant to have elongated cells on the furthest side from the light. Phototropism is one of the many plant tropisms or movements which respond to external stimuli. Growth towards a light source is called positive phototropism, while growth away from light is called negative phototropism (skototropism). Most plant shoots exhibit positive phototropism, and rearrange their chloroplasts in the leaves to maximize photosynthetic energy and promote growth.Goyal, A., Szarzynska, B., Fankhauser C. (2012). Phototropism: at the crossroads of light-signaling pathways. Cell 1-9. Some vine shoot tips exhibit negative phototropism, which allows them to grow towards dark, solid objects and climb them. The combination of phototropism and gravitropism allow plants to grow in the correct direction.Liscum, E. (2002). Phototropism: Mechanisms and Outcomes. Arabidopsis Book 1-21. Mechanism There are several signaling molecules that help the plant determine where the light source is coming from which helps the plant, and this activates several genes, which change the hormone gradients allowing the plant to grow towards the light. The very tip of the plant is known as the coleoptile, which is necessary in light sensing. The middle portion of the coleoptile is the area where the shoot curvature occurs. The Cholodny‚ÄìWent hypothesis, developed in the early 20th century, predicts that in the presence of asymmetric light, auxin will move towards the shaded side and promote elongation of the cells on that side to cause the plant to curve towards the light source. Auxins activate proton pumps, decreasing the pH in the cells on the dark side of the plant. This acidification of the cell wall region activates enzymes known as expansins which disrupt hydrogen bonds in the cell wall structure, making the cell walls less rigid. In addition, increased proton pump activity leads to more solutes entering the plant cells on the dark side of the plant, which increases the osmotic gradient between the symplast and apoplast of these plant cells. Water then enters the cells along its osmotic gradient, leading to an increase in turgor pressure. The decrease in cell wall strength and increased turgor pressure above a yield threshold causes cells to swell, exerting the mechanical pressure that drives phototropic movement. A second group of genes, PIN genes, have been found to play a major role in phototropism. They are auxin transporters, so it is thought that they are responsible for the polarization of auxin. Specifically PIN3 has been identified as the primary auxin carrier. It is possible that phototropins receive light and inhibit the activity of PINOID kinase (PID), which then promotes the activity of PIN3. This activation of PIN3 leads to asymmetric distribution of auxin, which then leads to asymmetric elongation of cells in the stem. pin3 mutants had shorter hypocotyls and roots than the wild-type, and the same phenotype was seen in plants grown with auxin efflux inhibitors. Using anti-PIN3 immunogold labeling, movement of the PIN3 protein was observed. PIN3 is normally localized to the surface of hypocotyl and stem, but is also internalized in the presence of Brefeldin A (BFA), an exocytosis inhibitor. This mechanism allows PIN3 to be repositioned in response to an environmental stimulus. PIN3 and PIN7 proteins were thought to play a role in pulse-induced phototropism. The curvature responses in the \\"pin3\\" mutant were reduced significantly, but only slightly reduced in \\"pin7\\" mutants. There is some redundancy among \\"PIN1\\", \\"PIN3\\", and \\"PIN7\\", but it is thought that PIN3 plays a greater role in pulse-induced phototropism. There are phototropins that are highly expressed in the upper region of coleoptiles. There are two main phototropism they are phot1 and phot2. phot2 single mutants have phototropic responses like that of the wild-type, but phot1 phot2 double mutants do not show any phototropic responses. The amounts of PHOT1 and PHOT2 present are different depending on the age of the plant and the intensity of the light. There is a high amount of PHOT2 present in mature Arabidopsis leaves and this was also seen in rice orthologs. The expression of PHOT1 and PHOT2 changes depending on the presence of blue or red light. There was a downregulation of PHOT1 mRNA in the presence of light, but upregulation of PHOT2 transcript. The levels of mRNA and protein present in the plant were dependent upon the age of the plant. This suggests that the phototropin expression levels change with the maturation of the leaves. Mature leaves contain chloroplasts that are essential in photosynthesis. Chloroplast rearrangement occurs in different light environments to maximize photosynthesis. There are several genes involved in plant phototropism including the NPH1 and NPL1 gene. They are both involved in chloroplast rearrangement. The nph1 and npl1 double mutants were found to have reduced phototropic responses. In fact, the two genes are both redundant in determining the curvature of the stem. Recent studies reveal that multiple AGC kinases, except for PHOT1 and PHOT2, are involved in plant phototropism. Firstly, PINOID, exhibiting a light-inducible expression pattern, determines the subcellular relocation of PIN3 during phototropic responses via a direct phosphorylation. Secondly, D6PK and its D6PKL homologs modulates the auxin transport activity of PIN3, likely through phosphorylation as well. Third, upstream of D6PK/D6PKLs, PDK1.1 and PDK1.2 acts an essential activator for these AGC kinases. Interestingly, different AGC kinases might participate in different steps during the progression of a phototropic response. D6PK/D6PKLs exhibit an ability to phosphorylate more phosphosites than PINOID. =Five models of auxin distribution in phototropism= In 2012, Sakai and Haga outlined how different auxin concentrations could be arising on shaded and lighted side of the stem, giving birth to phototropic response. Five models in respect to stem phototropism have been proposed, using Arabidopsis thaliana as the study plant. Five models showing how auxin is transported in the plant Arabidopsis. ;First model In the first model incoming light deactivates auxin on the light side of the plant allowing the shaded part to continue growing and eventually bend the plant over towards the light. ;Second model In the second model light inhibits auxin biosynthesis on the light side of the plant, thus decreasing the concentration of auxin relative to the unaffected side. ;Third model In the third model there is a horizontal flow of auxin from both the light and dark side of the plant. Incoming light causes more auxin to flow from the exposed side to the shaded side, increasing the concentration of auxin on the shaded side and thus more growth occurring. ;Fourth model In the fourth model it shows the plant receiving light to inhibit auxin basipetal down to the exposed side, causing the auxin to only flow down the shaded side. ;Fifth model Model five encompasses elements of both model 3 and 4. The main auxin flow in this model comes from the top of the plant vertically down towards the base of the plant with some of the auxin travelling horizontally from the main auxin flow to both sides of the plant. Receiving light inhibits the horizontal auxin flow from the main vertical auxin flow to the irradiated exposed side. And according to the study by Sakai and Haga, the observed asymmetric auxin distribution and subsequent phototropic response in hypocotyls seems most consistent with this fifth scenario. Effects of wavelength Phototropism in plants such as Arabidopsis thaliana is directed by blue light receptors called phototropins. Other photosensitive receptors in plants include phytochromes that sense red light and cryptochromes that sense blue light. Different organs of the plant may exhibit different phototropic reactions to different wavelengths of light. Stem tips exhibit positive phototropic reactions to blue light, while root tips exhibit negative phototropic reactions to blue light. Both root tips and most stem tips exhibit positive phototropism to red light. Cryptochromes are photoreceptors that absorb blue/ UV-A light, and they help control the circadian rhythm in plants and timing of flowering. Phytochromes are photoreceptors that sense red/far-red light, but they also absorb blue light; they can control flowering in adult plants and the germination of seeds, among other things. The combination of responses from phytochromes and cryptochromes allow the plant to respond to various kinds of light.McCoshum, S., Kiss, J.Z. (2011). Green light affects blue-light based phototropism in hypocotyls of Arabidopsis thaliana. Torrey Botanical Society 138(4), 409-417. Together phytochromes and cryptochromes inhibit gravitropism in hypocotyls and contribute to phototropism.

It is the seat of the diocese of Ghent, is named for Saint Bavo of Ghent, and contains the well-known Ghent Altarpiece. History Cathedral from J van Eyck Square. The building is built on the site of the former Chapel of St. John the Baptist, primarily of wooden construction that was consecrated in 942 by Transmarus, Bishop of Tournai and Noyon. Traces of a later Romanesque structure can be found in the cathedral's crypt. Construction of the Gothic church began around 1274. In the subsequent period from the 14th through 16th centuries, nearly continuous expansion projects in the Gothic style were executed on the structure. A new choir, radiating chapels, expansions of the transepts, a chapter house, nave aisles and a single-tower western section were all added. In 1539, as a result of the rebellion against Charles V, who was baptized in the church, the old Abbey of St. Bavo was dissolved. Its abbot and monks went on to become canons in a Chapter that was attached to what then became the Church of Saint Bavo. When the Diocese of Ghent was founded in 1559, the church became its cathedral. Construction was considered complete on June 7, 1569. In the summer of 1566, bands of Calvinist iconoclasts visited Catholic churches in the Netherlands, shattering stained- glass windows, smashing statues, and destroying paintings and other artworks they perceived as idolatrous. However, the altarpiece by the Van Eycks was saved.  Interior  The Ghent Altarpiece, a 15th-century painting by Hubert and Jan van Eyck. =Ghent Altarpiece= The cathedral is noted for the Ghent Altarpiece, originally in its Joost Vijd chapel. It is formally known as: The Adoration of the Mystic Lamb by Hubert and Jan van Eyck. This work is considered Van Eyck's masterpiece and one of the most important works of the early Northern Renaissance, as well as one of the greatest artistic masterpieces of Belgium. =Other religious art= The cathedral is home to works of other artists of note. It holds the painting Saint Bavo enters the Convent at Ghent by Peter Paul Rubens. There are also works by or after Lucas de Heere, one of which is a View of Gent. Frans Pourbus the Elder painted 14 panels representing the History of Saint Andrew (1572) and a Triptych of Viglius Aytta (1571). Caspar de Crayer is represented by paintings of St Macarius of Gent, The Beheading of Saint John the Baptist and The Martyrdom of Saint Barbara. The church also holds works by Antoon van den Heuvel including the Christ and the Adulterous Woman and the Resurrection of Christ. There are also works by Lucas van Uden and Jan van Cleef.De Inventaris van het Bouwkundig Erfgoed, Sint-Baafskathedraal (ID: 25743) at Inventaris onroerend erfgoed Local Ghent painter Petrus Norbertus van Reysschoot painted a series of 11 grisailles which decorate the choir of the cathedral, above the stalls. Five of these panels represent scenes from the Old Testament while the other six episodes from the New Testament. These paintings were placed in the cathedral between 1789 and 1791.Victor van der Haeghen, Reysschoot, Pierre- Norbert Van in: Biographie nationale de Belgique, Volume 19, p. 235-238 File:St. Bavos Cathedral Ghent.jpgInterior of the roman Crypt, with frescos of religious figures visible.

Organs  The cathedral has four organs for use at liturgical celebrations. Most famous is the main organ in the Upper church, the biggest organ in the Benelux. In 1935 Mgr Coppieters commanded that the Klais organ from the world exhibition would be put inside the cathedral. The organ case dates from the 18th century and the complete organ has more than 6000 pipes inside. It has 5 manuals.  Choir  High Choir of the Cathedral, in the upper church. The most impressive part is the high choir with stalls for the members of the Chapter of Saint-Bavon. The episcopal throne is located on the right side with the episcopal arms visible. Highlights of the interior decoration of the choir include the Baroque high altar (1702‚Äì1782), in white, black, and red flamed marble, and the tomb monuments of Ghent bishops, including that of Antonius Triest, in white and black marble (1652‚Äì1654), a major work of Jer√¥me Duquesnoy (II). On the right side is the gallery with painted crests of the members of the Order of the Golden Fleece. In the choir is the 1559 painting The Queen of Sheba visits King Solomon by the Flemish artist Lucas de Heere. This allegorical work depicts King Solomon as Philip II of Spain, recognizable by his facial features, receiving gifts from the Queen of Sheba, an allegory of the Low Countries, representing that country donating its riches to the Spanish king in thanks for his prudent government.  Nave  In the nave we find an impressive rococo pulpit (1741‚Äì1745), made in oak, gilded wood and white and black marble by Laurent Delvaux, with wrought iron fence by J. Arens, There are also chairs designed by the contemporary designer Maarten Van Severen. The main altar is placed between the nave and the Choir.  Treasury and crypt  In the Chapel of the Holiest an important Calvary Triptych is on display. This 15th-century work is attributed to Justus van Gent. Finally, there is a valuable collection of important liturgical plates, reliquaries, and liturgical vessels dating from the 15th century onward. Among the important reliquaries are the head of Saint John the Baptist and of Saint Macarius. The important collection of hand-embroidered and brocaded liturgical ornaments is widely known as one of the most important of the country, some of which are put on display.  Chapter of Saint-Bavo  Karel Justinus Calewaert as Canon of St Bavo. Constant van Crombrugghe as Canon of Ghent. Still today the chapter is housed inside the cathedral, since its foundation. Members have been important prelates and members of noble houses. Today Jozef De Kesel is one of the honorary canons. The chapters of Haarlem and Ghent are united in friendship. Weekly the canons sing Mass with the bishop. * Maximilian van de Woestyne de Becelaere, died 1699: nephew of the Marquess of Becelaere * Jacques Ignace van Parys, died 1702: grandson of Rubens. * Constant van Crombrugghe * Fran√ßois III Maria Rubens, died 1720: great grandson of Rubens. * Petrus Joseph Triest, founder of the Brothers of Charity * Thomas-Philip d'Alsace, Cardinal * Antoon Stillemans, before he was ordained bishop * Gustaaf Joos, before he was created cardinal * Jozef De Kesel, honorary Canon * Lode Aerts, before he was ordained bishop  Burials  Cornelius Jansen (1510‚Äì1576), first Bishop of Ghent (1565‚Äì1576) * Pieter Damant (1530-1609), third Bishop of Ghent (1589-1609) * Karl vanden Bosch, Bishop of Ghent * Karel Justinus Calewaert, (1893‚Äì1963): 27th Bishop of Ghent (1948‚Äì1963) * Prince Ferdinand de Lobkowitz (1726‚Äì1795) Bishop of Ghent, 1779‚Äì1795 * Philippus Erardus van der Noot, baroque tomb by Jan Boeksent. * Jan de Smet, Bishop of Ghent * Jan-Frans van de Velde (1779‚Äì1838), 20th Bishop of Ghent. * Gerard van Eersel (died 1778), Bishop of Ghent * Ignace Schetz de Grobbendonk (1625‚Äì1680), 11th Bishop of Ghent (1679‚Äì1680) * Michelle of Valois, Duchess of Burgundy  See also  Bishop of Ghent * List of Gothic Cathedrals in Europe  References   External links  Saint Bavo's Cathedral Roman Catholic cathedrals in Belgium Roman Catholic churches in Ghent 942 establishments Gothic architecture in Belgium Romanesque architecture in Belgium Churches in East Flanders Burial sites of the Pippinids 10th-century establishments in Belgium Tourism in Belgium ","title":"St Bavo's Cathedral, Ghent"},{"id":"30876744","text":"Luciano Cipriani (born March 8, 1981 in C√≥rdoba, Argentina) is an Argentine footballer currently playing for Estudiantes de Buenos Aires) of the Primera B Metropolitana in Argentina.

Established in 1902 as Sanjiang Normal School, it underwent a number of name changes until it was renamed Nanjing University in 1950. It merged with the University of Nanking in 1952. In addition to its membership in the C9 League, Nanjing University has been designated a Class A institution in the Double First Class University plan, a government initiative to cultivate an elite group of Chinese universities into \\"world-class\\" institutions. The university is perennially ranked one of the best research universities in China, and one of China's most selective universities. It is ranked among the top universities worldwide in major global university rankings. Regarding research output, the Nature Index 2017 ranks Nanjing University number 2 in China, number 3 in Asia Pacific and number 12 in the world. NJU has two main campuses: the Xianlin campus in the northeast of Nanjing, and the Gulou campus in the city center of Nanjing.  History  = History = ÂçóÈõçÁ•≠ÈÖí ÊπõËã•Ê∞¥ (Zhan Ruoshui, former 'president') Nanjing, situated in the lower part of the Yangtze, has historically been the capital of various kingdoms and dynasties, with the reputation as the center of education. In 258 CE, the Kingdom of Wu under the reign of Emperor Jing of Wu, founded a Confucian learning institute for the purpose of learning Six Arts. In the first year of Jianwu reign (317), Taihsueh (Â§™Â≠∏) campus was built in today's Fuzimiao () area on the banks of Qinhuai River, and Nanking Imperial University began recruiting students from common families instead of only from noble families.Nanking Taihsueh campus was initially located in north of Qinhuai River, twenty years later the campus in south of Qinhuai was constructed, and thus the school was on both banks of the river. Like its forerunner Chengjun () and succeeding Shang Hsiang () founded by Yu (, 21st century BCE) in Chungyuan, the earliest recorded imperial higher learning institutions and their successors, it was the Kingdom's central university, which after Han dynasty excellent students from local schools could be selected to attend to pursue further education. In 470 during the Former Song dynasty, the Imperial Central University (Zongmingguan) became a comprehensive institution combining higher education and research, with five divisions: Literature, History, Confucian Study, Xuan Study and Yin Yang Study. The campus of School of Literature and School of History were located in today's Nanjing University Gulou campus, west to Gulou () mountain, and the campus was moved to today's Chaotian Palace () area at the time when Wang Jian () was university president and the areas of study were narrowed, with a heavy focus on Confucian classics. In the period the faculty members included such scholars and scientists as Zu Chongzhi (), Ge Hong (), Wang Xizhi (), and students included such figures as Xiao Daocheng, Emperor Gao of Southern Qi who studied at School of Confucian Studies, and Zhong Rong, a founding scholar of poetics who graduated from division of literature. After the fall of Chen dynasty, the school was closed and later replaced by Nanking Academy (or Jiangzhou Academy, Jiangzhou Zhouxue) in Sui dynasty. In 937 when campus of the imperial national university was again in Fuzimiao area, Li Shandao, a scholar of the university, established another national school Lushan National Academy outside the capital city Nanking which is called Bailudong Shuyuan (White Deer Grotto Academy), a famous academy that hosted many renowned scholars including Zhu Xi, Lu Jiuyuan and Wang Yangming. In 1382 the Imperial University ( Kuotzuchien or Guozijian) moved campus from Nanking Fuzimiao area to south of Qintian Mountain () and Xuanwu Lake (the area around Nanjing University campus before 1952. In 1952 Nanjing University moved to Gulou and its engineering school was split and formed several independent colleges including Nanjing Institute of Technology, which at its peak spanning 10 Li and hosting near 10,000 students, and around there were institutes including Qintian Jian (Imperial Astronomy Institute) and Taiyi Yuan (Imperial Medical Institute). In 1403 Peking Guozijian (Beijing Guozijian, Imperial University of Peking) was established. The Imperial University of Nanking () developed and flourished in the period, consisting of six schools: three basic level colleges (Chengyi, ChongChih, Guangye), two middle level schools (Hsiudao, Chenghsin) and one advanced level school (Shuaihsing), altogether 4 years to complete according to the system, one and a half years for both of the former two levels and one year for the latter level, to achieve 8 credit points a year and then upon graduation Chushen (qualification, diploma) would be awarded, with subjects including Confucian classics, history, literature, mathematics, law, calligraphy, equestrianism and archery, etc.According to the system, it takes 4 years to complete the three stage study. However, actually many took more years to complete, and some even spent more than ten years, partly due to the substantial subsidies provided to the university including to its students by government, but later with the scale expanding the subsidies were often delayed, as indicated in the Report of Nanking Imperial University by the president Chao Yonghsian (Ë∂ôÁî®Ë≥¢Ôºö„ÄäÂçó‰∫¨Â§™Â≠∏Ê¢ùÈô≥Áñè„Äã). Yongle Encyclopedia was completed at Imperial Nanking University in 1408 after five years compilation, 9169 scholars selected from nationwide took part in it, thereinto 2180 were student scholars of the university. The publishing house of the imperial university of Nanking had been a publishing centre for several hundred years. Wu Cheng'en, Tang Hsiantzu and Zheng Chenggong studied there during the Ming dynasty. Each time when Nanking became a non-capital city, the Nanking Imperial University was changed to be regional Nanking Academy. The Imperial Nanking University was changed to Nanking Academy (, Jiangning Fuxue) in 1650 after Qing dynasty replaced Ming dynasty, and in 1865 after Taiping Rebellion the academy was relocated to Chaotian Palace. The ancient school history was recognized during ROC. In 1954 the school authority controlled by CPC decided to set the year starting to establish the modern new type school Sanjiang Normal College as the school's new founding year.The university since controlled by Communist Party of China (CPC) which established People's Republic of China (PRC) has not officially recognized the ancient history of the university, however, since reform era in many occasions it recognizes, for instance, Nanyong, one of the school names used in Ming dynasty which was also used by the school after the dynasty, is still often used, e.g., Nanjing University history record is often called Nanyong history record, the series of selected academic works in humanity by Nanjing University scholars in Republic of China (ROC) era republished by Nanjing University Publishing House is called Nanyong Academic Classics, the concert performed by Nanjing University Guqin Society is called Nanyong Qin Concert. = Late Qing and Republic of China = Paifang of \\"Tao is Universal Through All Times\\" (), at the former campus site Chaotian Palace In 1902, Sanjiang Normal College () under the new educational system, using Japanese modern higher institutions of learning as references, was beginning to be established to replace the traditional Chinese school Nanking Academy, and was opened in the next year, with campus constructed south to Qintian Mountain. The name was changed to Liangjiang Normal College () in 1906, and the new president Li Ruiqing () established the first faculty of modern art in China. In 1915 after the Republic of China replaced Qing dynasty, the Nanking Higher Normal School () was founded to replace Liangjiang Higher Normal School which was closed three years before due to Xinhai Revolution, Jiang Qian () was appointed as the president.Jiang Qian was appointed as the president of Nanking Higher Normal School in July 1914, to establish the school in the campus of the closed Liangjiang Higher Normal School, and the charger of keeping of Liangjiang Higher Normal School became a member of the preparatory committee of Nanking Higher Normal School. Nanking Higher Normal School opened in September 1915. The school established the China's first faculty of modern gymnastics (physical education) in 1916. In 1920 the school consisted of five colleges: Liberal Arts, Agriculture, Engineering, Commerce and Education. The \\"China Science Society\\" (), a major science organization in the modern history of China, founded its headquarter in the school in 1918. Its members established \\"Academia Sinica\\" () which was later moved to Taiwan and known as the \\"Chinese Academy of Sciences\\" () in mainland China. Numerous Chinese modern science pioneers, most of whom studied in America and some European countries such as Britain, France, and Germany, converged there to found many fields of science in China. It became the Chinese cradle of modern science. Among 81 academicians of \\"Academia Sinica\\" elected for the first time in 1948, five entered or graduated from the university in 1920. More than half of the leading Chinese scientists whose works were published in scientific journals in the early period of Chinese modern science were graduates or academics of Nanjing University. Kuo Ping-wen (Guo Bingwen, ), an influential university president, was appointed in 1919 after Jiang Qian. The school meeting passed The Audit Law for Women Students () on December 7, 1919, as result of efforts of the educationist T'ao Hsing-chih (Tao Xingzhi, ), as well as the president Guo Bingwen, and the professors including Liu Boming (), Luh Chih-wei (Lu Zhiwei, ), Yang Hsingfo (Yang Xingfo, ), etc., and then decided to formally recruit female students. The school became the first higher learning institution in China to recruit coeducational students. It enrolled eight women students in the first year 1920, and in addition, more than 50 female auditing students were admitted. In 1921 the National Southeastern University () was founded, and in 1923 Nanking Higher Normal School was merged into it. In the autumn of 1921, the Faculty of Business established in 1917 was moved to Shanghai to establish the first business school conferring degrees in China. The university consisted of five colleges (or schools) at the time: Liberal Arts (including departments of Chinese literature, foreign literature, history, philosophy, psychology, mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, geoscience, and the Department of Politics, Law and Economics), Education, Agriculture, Engineering, and Commerce (or Business, including departments of general commerce, business administration, accounting, finance, economics, international trade, etc.), and soon later the College of Liberal Arts was divided to be College of Humanities and College of Sciences. The earliest modern scientific research laboratories and groups in China were established at the university. It integrated teaching and research, with status of university's independence and academic freedom, and was regarded as the earliest Chinese modern university. The university along with its affiliated primary school and middle school served as a pioneer and model which laid the foundations for the establishment of modern educational system (, Renhs√º Hs√ºehchih, 1922) in China, and in addition, its experimental kindergarten (Gulou Kindergarten) founded in 1923 was later also adopted as the model for Chinese kindergartens (Kindergarten Courses Standards by Ministration of Education, 1932), including its teaching system, teaching materials, teaching methods and teaching tools. In October 1921, \\"Hsuehheng Society\\" (or Xueheng Society, ) was founded in the university which was the focus of the \\"Hsuehheng School\\" included the scholars Liu Yizheng (), Liu Boming (Âäâ‰ºØÊòé), Mei Guangdi (), Wu Mi () and Hu Hsien-Hsu (Hu Xiansu, ). They reinvigorated Confucian culture and humanism and published the monthly \\"Critical Review\\" (Xueheng, in Chinese) in January 1922. It enabled Nanjing University to become a center of Confucian thought and humanistic scholarship. During this period, Nanjing University was known as the foremost \\"Oriental Education Centre\\" and recognized as an academic and cultural exchange centre for east and west. Many scholars visited and instructed there, including the American educationist Paul Monroe, W. H. Kilpatrick, E. L. Thorndike, philosopher John Dewey, British philosopher Bertrand Russell, German philosopher Hans Driesch and the Indian (also Bengali) poet Rabindranath Tagore. The university became the capital national university after Nanking was made the capital by Nationalist Government, initially renamed National Dyisyi Chungshan University (or called National Nanking Chungshan University) in June 1927 when National Southeastern University merged eight public schools in Jiangsu province, and was renamed Jiangsu University in February 1928, and in May 1928, it was renamed National Central University ().The university was called the capital national university after Nanking was made the capital city again in 1927, and in the June National Southeastern University merged eight public schools in Jiangsu province: the national Hohai Technology University and Shanghai Commerce University and the provincial Jiangsu Law and Politics University, Jiangsu Medical University, Nanking Agricultural School, Nanking Technical Specialized School, Soochow Technical Specialized School and Shanghai Commercial Specialized School, and was renamed National Dyisyi Chungshan University (Disi Zhongshan University, the Fourth Chungshan University or the Fourth Zhongshan University. Dyisyi or Disi, meaning the fourth, indicates that the city was the fourth major city captured by the Northern Expeditionary Army and with a national university under Nationalist Government. Chungshan of the time, or Zhongshan as the spelling now in mainland China, is another name of Sun Yat- sen.) which was also called National Nanking Chungshan University (or Nanjing Zhongshan University) due to its location. The students movement against the renaming broke out after it was renamed Jiangsu University by the government in February 1928, and the students requested that the school be renamed National Nanking University. Then there emerged the proposal (by Woo Chih-hui, who was soon later selected as the university president and did not take up the post and was appointed the first president of Academia Sinica) to rename National Capital University and the proposal (by Ma Yinbing, who was at the time responsible for Nanking municipal construction) to rename National Central University which gained wide support and was accepted by the university students. And in May 1928, the school was renamed National Central University (National Chungyang University or Zhongyang University, Kuoli Chungyang Tahsueh, ÂúãÁ´ã‰∏≠Â§ÆÂ§ßÂ≠∏). At the time there were eight colleges (or schools): Humanity, Social Science, Natural Science, Engineering, Education, Commerce, Agriculture, and Medicine. The College of Commerce moved to Shanghai in 1921 and College of Medicine established in Shanghai in 1927 were split from the university in 1932.The university's commerce college became National Shanghai Commerce College and then Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, and medical college became National Shanghai Medical College and then Shanghai Medical University which later merged with Fudan University. In 1935 College of Medicine was again established, in Nanjing. During the Anti- Japanese War between 1937 and 1945, the university moved to Chongqing, while the College of Medicine and Department of Animal Husbandry & Veterinary Medicine of College of Agriculture moved to Chengdu. The Chinese Association of Natural Science () was originated at the university in 1927 and adopted the name next year, which was the second largest scientific organization in China in 1949, after China Science Society. China Association of Scientific Workers () was founded in the university in 1944.China Association of Scientific Workers was initiated by China Science Society along with Chinese Association of Natural Science and other specialized associations including Chinese Agricultural Association and China Engineering Society in 1944 in the Republic of China. China Association of Scientific Workers, together with corresponding associations of other states including British Association of Scientific Workers, founded World Federation of Scientific Workers in London in 1946 after World War II. China Science Society and the associations were merged to be the China Association for Science and Technology () in 1958 in Beijing. The Natural Science Forum was initiated by the university faculties in 1939, which was later renamed Jiusan Forum (Sept. 3rd Forum) and became Jiusan Society in 1945, an organization for intellectual groups in China. In the united college entrance examinations beginning in 1937, about two-thirds of students put the university as the first choice. It became the first Chinese university enrolling blind college student, when enrolled Luo Fuxin () in 1942. = People's Republic of China = In 1949, during the late time of Chinese Civil War, the central government of the Republic of China retreated from Nanking and the National Central University was renamed National Nanking University (National Nanjing University, ) after Nanking was controlled by CPC army, before the establishment of People's Republic of China. In 1952, many colleges and departments, mainly colleges of education (or teacher, normal, including art and physical education departments), engineering, agriculture, and medicine, were split from Nanjing University, and many new independent schools were formed, including Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing Institute of Technology which was located at former Nanjing University site and later renamed Southeast University, etc.The split schools and departments of Nanjing University formed independent schools in 1952 include today's Nanjing Normal University, Southeast University, Hohai University, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing Forestry University, etc., and the schools share the source and were independently established after that time include the Fourth Military Medical University, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing University of Technology, Jiangsu University, Jiangnan University, Changzhou University, etc.. At the same time, University of Nanking (), a private university established in 1888 and sponsored by American churches, was merged into Nanjing University (), which lost its \\"national\\" appellation in 1950 to reflect the reality that all universities in the PRC would be public, and Nanjing University moved campus to the site of University of Nanking where was west to Gulou Mountain and was also once the site of imperial Nanjing University in ancient times. A separate National Central University was reinstated in Taiwan by its old alumni association in 1962. Nanjing University Student Activities Center, Xianlin Campus During the period of communist society including the period of Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the school suffered heavily. In 1976, Nanjing University faculty members and students launched Anti Cultural Revolution Force Movement which was called \\"Nanjing Incident\\" by the authorities of the time, spreading countrywide. In 1978, Hu Fuming, a faculty member of Nanjing University in philosophy, wrote the historic article entitled \\"Practice is the Sole Criterion for Testing Truth\\", and after being published it led to the nationwide \\"Debate on Standards for Judging the Truth\\", and thus in certain degree liberated thought and promoted the ending of Cultural Revolution and the coming of reform era. = After the Reform and new development = Many faculties have been reestablished or newly founded since the Reform after 1978, e.g., law reestablished in 1981, medical school in 1987, environmental department newly founded in 1984. Some departments were divided into two or more departments, e.g., the Chinese language and literature department divided into departments of language & linguistics, literature, philology and drama arts, or some new faculties came out of older faculties, e.g., computer came out of mathematics, urban planning came out of geography, in many case formed integratively, i.e., formed based on parts of two or more faculties, e.g., parts of faculties of physics and chemistry integratively formed material faculty. In around 1990 the university consisted of schools (colleges) of Humanities, Sciences, Technological Sciences, Medicine, Business, etc.. Then many departments became schools, e.g., mathematics, physics, chemistry, or grouped into new schools, e.g., architecture and urban planning. The size of university significantly expanded during the years. In 2009, Xianlin Campus opened to undergraduates, replacing Pukou Campus which was in use since 1993, and Pukou Campus became the campus of NJU Jinling College, an independent private college directed by NJU. The Xianlin campus now is a main campus along with Gulou campus.  Faculties  Old Great Hall () More than 1500 years ago, ancient University of Nanjing founded the earliest faculties of literature, history, etc.. In modern times, Nanjing University established Chinese first faculties of art, gymnastics, biology, psychology, business management, etc.. Its faculties, departments and schools have been changed and evolved timely. For example, in 1921, the university consisted of 5 schools: liberal arts, education, agriculture, engineering and business, in 1928 the school of liberal arts had become three schools, and the university consisted of 8 schools: humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, education, agriculture, engineering, business and medicine, and now, many former departments of humanities, natural sciences and social sciences have become schools. The system of academic degree or diploma has also been changed. In the early years of ROC the university adopted the system similar to western especially American universities and began to award bachelor's degree. The university founded China's first modern laboratories in physics, chemistry, etc.. In 1922, the university professors founded The Biology Research Institute of Science Society of China, the first modern scientific research institute in China, integrated with the university's biology department. With the aid of Rockefeller Foundation, Science Centre was constructed in 1924 and completed three years later. In 1926 the university passed The General Regulation of Graduate Institute. China's first doctor's degree was awarded by the school of medicine of the university in 1931. Soon the educational system was changed. In the early 1980s after a period of transformation, universities in mainland China resumed to award doctor's degrees, and graduate and undergraduate education were integrated into departments and schools. Nanjing University is the first in mainland China to award doctor's degrees in such fields as Chinese studies, world history, computer science. It is distinguished in many fields including Chinese Language and Literature, and natural sciences. Its faculty, including part-time faculty, includes more than twenty Nobel Laureates engaged in teaching. The university is a Double First Class University Plan university in 15 academic disciplines. = Schools and departments = Main Entrance of the Gulou Campus Nanjing University Current schools and departments * School of Liberal Arts (School of Literature, or College of Literature)  Chinese Language and Linguistics; Literature; Philology; Drama Arts * School of History  Chinese History; World History; Archaeology * Department of Philosophy; Religion * School of Foreign Studies  English; Russian; Japanese; French; German; Spanish; Korean; International Business * School of Government  Politics; Government Administration; Labor, Personnel and Social Security; Diplomacy and International Affairs * School of Law * School of Social and Behavioral Sciences  Sociology; Social Work and Social Policy; Psychology; Anthropology (institute) * School of Business (NUBS)  School of Management: Business Administration; Human Resource; Accounting; Marketing & Electronic Commerce  School of Economics: Economics; Industrial Economics; International Economics & Trading; Finance * Department of Information Management * School of Journalism and Communication * Department of Mathematics * School of Physics  Physics; Modern Physics; Photoelectricity Science; Acoustic Science and Engineering * School of Astronomy and Space Science  Astronomy; Space Science * School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering  Chemistry; Chemical Engineering; Polymer * School of Geoscience  School of Atmosphere Science: Meteorology; Atmosphere Physics  School of Earth Science and Engineering: Earth Science; Water Science; Geology Engineering and Information Technology  School of Geography and Ocean Science: Natural Geography; Land, Resources and Tourism; Earth Information Science; Coast and Ocean Science * School of Life Sciences  Biology; Biochemistry * School of Medicine  Clinical Medicine; Dentistry; Basic Medical Science; Laboratory Medicine; Public Health and Medicine (institute) * School of Environment * School of Architecture and Planning Architecture; Urban Planning and Design * School of Electronics Science and Engineering  Electronic Engineering; Micro-electronics and Optoelectronics; Informational Electronics; Communication Engineering * Department of Computer Science and Technology; Software Institute * College of Engineering and Applied Sciences  Materials; Energy; Quantum Electronics and Optical Engineering; Biomedical Engineering Overlooking Xianlin campus from a nearby metro station * Institute of Education (Graduate School of Education) * Institute for Gymnastics * Institute of Arts * Institute for Advanced Studies in the Humanities and Social Science * School for Basic Sciences Education * International School * School for Overseas Students Education * Jinling College(First-class applied college) * Johns Hopkins University-Nanjing University Center for Chinese and American Studies (Hopkins-Nanjing Center) * Other research and education institutes in areas such as African Studies, Judaic Studies, Agriculture, Engineering Management, etc.  Campus  The Gulou campus in autumn Duxia Library in Nanjing University, Xianlin Campus, built in 2007 Nanjing University has three main campuses: Gulou, Xianlin and Pukou campus. The distance between Gulou and Xianlin campus is about 18 kilometers. Gulou Campus is located in Gulou District, at the center of Nanjing City. The main campus itself is divided into two sections by Hankou Road: North Garden, Bei Yuan, is where teaching and research take place; and South Garden, Nan Yuan, serves as the living area for both students and academic staff. Pukou Campus is situated in the suburban Pukou District, by the northern side of Nanjing New & High-Tech Industry Development Zone, and became part of Nanjing University in 1993. Once Pukou campus hosted undergraduate freshmen, sophomore and junior students. In 2009, the Pukou campus became the campus hosted the undergraduate students in Nanjing University Jinling College, which was founded by Nanjing University in 1998. Nanjing University Biomedical Research Institute is also located in Pukou. Xianlin Campus is located in the northeast of Nanjing, in the Xianlin Universities Town, south of Yangtse River and Qixia Mountain, east of Purple Mountain, and west of Baohua Mountain. The campus is home to undergraduate students and parts of graduate students. It was opened in September 2009. There is the stop of Nanjing University Xianlin Campus on Line 2 of Nanjing Subway, which enables Xianlin and Gulou campus to be connected through subway. In Gulou campus, there are several museums including Nanjing University Museum, Museum of Art and Archaeology, Museum of Earth Science. There is Sun Yat-sen House. It's said that Sun Yat-sen, the first president (provisional president) of the Republic of China, lived there. There are also Pearl Buck House, John Rabe House, etc.. Gulou campus is now becoming mainly for professional graduate campus. The location of Nanjing University has changed for several times, with historical campuses mainly in Fuzimiao (on the bank of Qinhuai River), Gulou, Chaotiangong and Sipailou (south of Qintian Mountain) areas. In addition, during Anti-Japanese War, its main campus moved to Shapingba, Chungking, with two auxiliary campuses, one in Bohsi, Chungking, and one in Hwahsiba, Chengdu, in some sense combined with Chongqing University and Western China University (now medical school of Sichuan University) respectively. It also deserves to mention that before the war, with the rapid development of the university, a new campus planned to cover an area of 8000 mu (about ) south to Niushou Mountain in the southern suburb area of Nanjing had been built for near a year. After the war, it moved back to Nanjing, making former campus Sipailou as main campus, and the new campus Dingjiaqiao was built for agriculture and medical schools. Nanjing University relocated in Gulou six years after moving back, and then near sixty years later Xianlin campus emerged. Today's Nanjing University Gulou campus is the location of Imperial University of Nanjing during Former Song dynasty in more than 1500 years ago when it was in the west of the city, and now it's in the centre of the city.  Culture  = Motto = Officially translated into English as \\"Sincerity with Aspiration, Perseverance and Integrity\\". Another version is \\"Be Honest and Intelligent, Study Hard and Act Sincerely.\\"() The first half of this motto was the motto during the National Central University time, and the last half was quoted from the classic literature work Book of Rites. It was voted to be the motto by university students in 2002, and the then university president supported it and wrote an article to interpret it. The translation does not fully express the meaning of the Chinese words of the motto. Motto counterparts between Chinese and English literally: Cheng (ËØö, Sincerity, Honesty, Integrity), Pu (Ê®∏, Simplicity, Austerity, naturally being oneself), Xiong (ÈõÑ, Sturdiness, Majesty, being vigorous and keeping ideal and ambition, being firm and persistent with fortitude), Wei (ÂÅâ, Greatness, having great ideal and ambition, with great mind comprehending, containing and improving world), Li Xue (ÂãµÂ≠∏, Endeavor to Learn), Dun Xing (Êï¶Ë°å, Urge to Act, Act Sincerely). The term Dun Xing comes from the context in Book of Rites: Having broad knowledge and strong learning ability and being modest, acting in sincerity and benignity and not slack, that is a gentleman (gentleperson) (ÂçöËÅûÂº∑Ë≠òËÄåËÆì Êï¶ÂñÑË°åËÄå‰∏çÊÄ† Ë¨Ç‰πãÂêõÂ≠ê). = Song = The university song, recovered in 2002, was created in 1916. It is the first school song in the modern history of Nanjing University, with the lyrics written by Jiang Qian and melody composed by Li Shutong ().School song of Nanjing University = Anniversary = The present school anniversary is on May 20 every year, which was set by the school authority in 1954 in some sense due to some ideological reasons of the time, with the starting year being 1902 when relaunching the school as a modern higher learning institution, and the day May 20 in memory of the movement of anti-hunger and anti-war initiated by the university in that day of 1947. In recent years, the date May 20 has another new meaning: in Chinese Nanjing pronunciation, 5.20, sounds like I Love You (Wu Ai Ni). It shows students' love for their Alma Mater.  Recent status  = Recent developments and present status = The School of Modern Engineering and Applied Sciences was established in 2009, replacing former School of Technological Sciences. NU received a RMB 400 million endowment gift from enterpriser Yang Xiu on the anniversary day in 2012, 300 million was designated for the establishment of engineering school and the rest for history study development fund. The Engineering Building covering floor space of 6000 sqm was started to construct in Xianlin campus in 2014. = Rankings = According to Nature Index released in January 2018, the ranking of high-quality natural sciences research by Nature Publishing Group, Nanjing University is ranked No.3 in China, No.4 in Asia Pacific, No.14 in the world among all institutions (including CAS in China, CNRS in France and other national organizations), and ranked No.2 in China, No.3 in Asia Pacific, and No.10 in the world among universities.

The survival function is also known as the survivor function or reliability function. The term reliability function is common in engineering while the term survival function is used in a broader range of applications, including human mortality. Another name for the survival function is the complementary cumulative distribution function. Definition Let T be a continuous random variable with cumulative distribution function F(t) on the interval [0,‚àû). Its survival function or reliability function is: :S(t) = P(\\\\\\\\{T > t\\\\\\\\}) = \\\\int_t^{\\\\infty} f(u)\\\\,du = 1-F(t).  Examples of survival functions  The graphs below show examples of hypothetical survival functions. The x-axis is time. The y-axis is the proportion of subjects surviving. The graphs show the probability that a subject will survive beyond time t. Four survival functions For example, for survival function 1, the probability of surviving longer than t = 2 months is 0.37. That is, 37% of subjects survive more than 2 months. Survival function 1 For survival function 2, the probability of surviving longer than t = 2 months is 0.97. That is, 97% of subjects survive more than 2 months. Survival function 2 Median survival may be determined from the survival function. For example, for survival function 2, 50% of the subjects survive 3.72 months. Median survival is thus 3.72 months. Survival function median survival In some cases, median survival cannot be determined from the graph. For example, for survival function 4, more than 50% of the subjects survive longer than the observation period of 10 months. Median survival greater than 10 months The survival function is one of several ways to describe and display survival data. Another useful way to display data is a graph showing the distribution of survival times of subjects. Olkin, page 426, gives the following example of survival data. The number of hours between successive failures of an air-conditioning system were recorded. The time between successive failures are 1, 3, 5, 7, 11, 11, 11, 12, 14, 14, 14, 16, 16, 20, 21, 23, 42, 47, 52, 62, 71, 71, 87, 90, 95, 120, 120, 225, 246, and 261 hours. The mean time between failures is 59.6. This mean value will be used shortly to fit a theoretical curve to the data. The figure below shows the distribution of the time between failures. The blue tick marks beneath the graph are the actual hours between successive failures. Distribution of AC failure times The distribution of failure times is over-laid with a curve representing an exponential distribution. For this example, the exponential distribution approximates the distribution of failure times. The exponential curve is a theoretical distribution fitted to the actual failure times. This particular exponential curve is specified by the parameter lambda, Œª= 1/(mean time between failures) = 1/59.6 = 0.0168. The distribution of failure times is called the probability density function (pdf), if time can take any positive value. In equations, the pdf is specified as f(t). If time can only take discrete values (such as 1 day, 2 days, and so on), the distribution of failure times is called the probability mass function (pmf). Most survival analysis methods assume that time can take any positive value, and f(t) is the pdf. If the time between observed air conditioner failures is approximated using the exponential function, then the exponential curve gives the probability density function, f(t), for air conditioner failure times. Another useful way to display the survival data is a graph showing the cumulative failures up to each time point. These data may be displayed as either the cumulative number or the cumulative proportion of failures up to each time. The graph below shows the cumulative probability (or proportion) of failures at each time for the air conditioning system. The stairstep line in black shows the cumulative proportion of failures. For each step there is a blue tick at the bottom of the graph indicating an observed failure time. The smooth red line represents the exponential curve fitted to the observed data. CDF for AC failures A graph of the cumulative probability of failures up to each time point is called the cumulative distribution function, or CDF. In survival analysis, the cumulative distribution function gives the probability that the survival time is less than or equal to a specific time, t. Let T be survival time, which is any positive number. A particular time is designated by the lower case letter t. The cumulative distribution function of T is the function :F(t) = \\\\operatorname{P}(T\\\\leq t), where the right-hand side represents the probability that the random variable T is less than or equal to t. If time can take on any positive value, then the cumulative distribution function F(t) is the integral of the probability density function f(t). For the air conditioning example, the graph of the CDF below illustrates that the probability that the time to failure is less than or equal to 100 hours is 0.81, as estimated using the exponential curve fit to the data. AC Time to failure LT 100 hours An alternative to graphing the probability that the failure time is less than or equal to 100 hours is to graph the probability that the failure time is greater than 100 hours. The probability that the failure time is greater than 100 hours must be 1 minus the probability that the failure time is less than or equal to 100 hours, because total probability must sum to 1. This gives P(failure time > 100 hours) = 1 - P(failure time < 100 hours) = 1 ‚Äì 0.81 = 0.19. This relationship generalizes to all failure times: P(T > t) = 1 - P(T < t) = 1 ‚Äì cumulative distribution function. This relationship is shown on the graphs below. The graph on the left is the cumulative distribution function, which is P(T < t). The graph on the right is P(T > t) = 1 - P(T < t). The graph on the right is the survival function, S(t). The fact that the S(t) = 1 ‚Äì CDF is the reason that another name for the survival function is the complementary cumulative distribution function. Survival function is 1 - CDF Parametric survival functions In some cases, such as the air conditioner example, the distribution of survival times may be approximated well by a function such as the exponential distribution. Several distributions are commonly used in survival analysis, including the exponential, Weibull, gamma, normal, log-normal, and log-logistic. These distributions are defined by parameters. The normal (Gaussian) distribution, for example, is defined by the two parameters mean and standard deviation. Survival functions that are defined by parameters are said to be parametric. In the four survival function graphs shown above, the shape of the survival function is defined by a particular probability distribution: survival function 1 is defined by an exponential distribution, 2 is defined by a Weibull distribution, 3 is defined by a log-logistic distribution, and 4 is defined by another Weibull distribution. =Exponential survival function= For an exponential survival distribution, the probability of failure is the same in every time interval, no matter the age of the individual or device. This fact leads to the \\"memoryless\\" property of the exponential survival distribution: the age of a subject has no effect on the probability of failure in the next time interval. The exponential may be a good model for the lifetime of a system where parts are replaced as they fail. It may also be useful for modeling survival of living organisms over short intervals. It is not likely to be a good model of the complete lifespan of a living organism. As Efron and Hastie (p. 134) note, \\"If human lifetimes were exponential there wouldn't be old or young people, just lucky or unlucky ones\\". =Weibull survival function= A key assumption of the exponential survival function is that the hazard rate is constant. In an example given above, the proportion of men dying each year was constant at 10%, meaning that the hazard rate was constant. The assumption of constant hazard may not be appropriate. For example, among most living organisms, the risk of death is greater in old age than in middle age ‚Äì that is, the hazard rate increases with time. For some diseases, such as breast cancer, the risk of recurrence is lower after 5 years ‚Äì that is, the hazard rate decreases with time. The Weibull distribution extends the exponential distribution to allow constant, increasing, or decreasing hazard rates. = Other parametric survival functions= There are several other parametric survival functions that may provide a better fit to a particular data set, including normal, lognormal, log-logistic, and gamma. The choice of parametric distribution for a particular application can be made using graphical methods or using formal tests of fit. These distributions and tests are described in textbooks on survival analysis. Lawless has extensive coverage of parametric models. Parametric survival functions are commonly used in manufacturing applications, in part because they enable estimation of the survival function beyond the observation period. However, appropriate use of parametric functions requires that data are well modeled by the chosen distribution. If an appropriate distribution is not available, or cannot be specified before a clinical trial or experiment, then non-parametric survival functions offer a useful alternative. Non-parametric survival functions A parametric model of survival may not be possible or desirable. In these situations, the most common method to model the survival function is the non- parametric Kaplan‚ÄìMeier estimator. Properties Every survival function S(t) is monotonically decreasing, i.e. S(u) \\\\le S(t) for all u > t. It is a property of a random variable that maps a set of events, usually associated with mortality or failure of some system, onto time. The time, t = 0, represents some origin, typically the beginning of a study or the start of operation of some system. S(0) is commonly unity but can be less to represent the probability that the system fails immediately upon operation. Since the CDF is a right-continuous function, the survival function S(t) = 1-F(t) is also right-continuous.

It is a left tributary of the Danube. In part of its course it forms Romania's border with Moldova and Ukraine. Characteristics The Prut originates on the eastern slope of Mount Hoverla, in the Carpathian Mountains in Ukraine (Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast). At first, the river flows to the north. Near Yaremche it turns to the northeast, and near Kolomyia to the south-east. Having reached the border between Moldova and Romania, it turns even more to the south-east, and then to the south. It eventually joins the Danube near Giurgiule»ôti, east of Gala»õi and west of Reni. Between 1918 and 1939, the river was partly in Poland and partly in Greater Romania (Romanian: Rom√¢nia Mare). Prior to World War I, it served as a border between Romania and the Russian Empire. After World War II, the river once again demarcated a border, this time between Romania and the Soviet Union. Nowadays, for a length of 31 km, it forms the border between Romania and Ukraine, and for 711 km, it forms the border between Romania and Moldova. It has a hydrographic basin of 27,540 km2,Danube River Basin District, Part A - Roof Report, IPCDR, p 12 of which 10,990 km2 are in Romania and 7,790 km2 in Moldova. The largest city along its banks is Chernivtsi, Ukraine. The St√¢nca-Coste»ôti Dam, operated jointly by Moldova and Romania, is built on the Prut. There is also a Hydro-Electric Station in Sniatyn, (Ukraine). Ships travel from the river's mouth to the port city of Leova (southern Moldova). The lowermost part of the basin is strongly marshy. The average discharge at its mouth is . The average discharge at the city of Leova is 69.2 m¬≥/s. The slope of the river varies from 100 m / km (near the source) to 0.05 m / km (near the mouth). In the upper reaches (to Delyatyn) it has a mountainous character, with a steep right bank, sometimes the cross-sectional profile of the channel has the form of a ridge. Near the city of Yaremche is the waterfall of Probiy. About the name The Prut was known in Antiquity as the Pyretus (Ancient Greek Œ†œÖœÅŒµœÑœåœÇ), or Scythian Porata (possibly),Herodotus, translated by Thomas Gaisford and edited by Peter Edmund Laurent, The Nine Books of the History of Herodotus, Henry Slatter 1846, p. 299 Hierasus (·ºπŒµœÅŒ±œÉœåœÇ) or Gerasius.Peter Heather, The Goths, Blackwell Publishing, 1998, p. 100 Herodotus lists the Prut, under the name of Porata or Pyretus, as being among the five rivers flowing through the Scythian country which swell the Danube.See Herodotus 4.48. In the second volume of the Ottoman-Bulgarian chronicles of Iman \\"Jagfar Tarihi\\" (1680) the Prut River is referred to as Burat. And in the Byzantine treatise of Constantine Porphyrogennetos \\"On the management of the empire\\" it is mentioned as the Brut river (Chap. 38) or as Burat (Chapter 42).

During the Russo-Turkish War of 1710‚Äì1711, on 19 July 1711 Russian forces initially divided among Peter the Great's army on the west bank and Boris Sheremetev's army on the east bank of the Pruth and allied with Dimitrie Cantemir, the ruler of Moldova, met with the Ottoman army led by Grand Vizier Baltaci Mehmed Pasha. The Turks and Crimean Tatars attacked first against Sheremetev, who then retreated to the other side to join Peter the Great. Afterwards the Russian army set up a defensive camp between StƒÉnile»ôti and the river, which was then completely surrounded by the Ottoman army. Negotiations started on 21 July 1711 and the Treaty of the Prut was signed on 23 July 1711. After this treaty, Dimitrie Cantemir had to go in exile at Moscow. This treaty means the end of local dynasties of kings and inauguration of Greek rulers from the Fanar Qunarter of Istanbul (Phanariotes). A bit more than a century later, in 1821, the Greek Nationalist leader Alexander Ypsilantis crossed the Prut river at Sculeni, with the intention of touching off a rebellion in the Danubian Principalities. Though the Wallachian uprising ultimately failed - due especially to irreconcilable differences between Ypsilantis and his Wallachian ally Tudor Vladimirescu - it did touch off the Greek War of Independence, leading to the Kingdom of Greece gaining independence ten years later. In the Principalities it led to the end of the aforementioned Greek Phanariote rule, and indirectly to increasing self-government and eventually to the independence of Romania several decades later. In Greek history, Ypsilantis' crossing of the Prut is an important historical event, commemorated in a famous painting displayed at Athens.

A cue stick (or simply cue, more specifically billiards cue, pool cue, or snooker cue), is an item of sporting equipment essential to the games of pool, snooker and carom billiards. It is used to strike a ball, usually the . Cues are tapered sticks, typically about 57‚Äì59 inches (about 1.5 m) long and usually between 16 and 21 ounces (450‚Äì600 g), with professionals gravitating toward a 19-ounce (540 g) average. Cues for carom tend toward the shorter range, though cue length is primarily a factor of player height and arm length. Most cues are made of wood, but occasionally the wood is covered or bonded with other materials including graphite, carbon fiber or fiberglass. An obsolete term for a cue, used from the 16th to early 19th centuries, is billiard stick.  History  Michael Phelan's 1859 book, The Game of Billiards The forerunner of the cue was the , an implement similar to a light-weight golf club, with a foot that was generally used to shove rather than strike the cue ball. When the ball was against a , use of the mace was difficult (the foot would not fit under the edge of the cushion to strike the ball squarely), and by 1670 experienced players often used the tail or butt end of the mace instead. The term \\"cue\\" comes from queue, the French word for \\"tail\\", in reference to this practice, a style of shooting that eventually led to the development of separate, footless cue sticks by about 1800, used initially as adjuncts to the mace, which remained in use until well into the 19th century. In public billiard rooms only skilled players were allowed to use the cue, because the fragile cloth could be torn by novices. The introduction of the cue, and the new game possibilities it engendered, led to the development of cushions with more rebound, initially stuffed with linen or cotton flocking, but eventually replaced by rubber. The idea of the cue initially was to try to strike the cue-ball as centrally as possible to avoid a . The concept of on the cue ball was discovered before cue-tips had been invented; e.g. striking the bottom of the cue ball to make it go backwards upon contact with an . Fran√ßois Mingaud was studying the game of billiards while being held in Paris as a political prisoner, and experimented with a leather cue tip. In 1807, he was released and demonstrated his invention. Mingaud is also credited with the discovery that by raising the cue vertically, to the position adopted by the mace, he could perform what is now known as a shot. In pre-tip days, it was common for players to twist the ends of their cue into a plaster wall or ceiling so that a chalk-like deposit would form on the end to reduce the chance of a miscue, thus giving rise to the modern . The first systematic marketing of chalk was by John Carr, a marker in John Bartley's billiard rooms in Bath. Between Carr and Bartley, it was discovered how \\"\\" () could be used to the advantage of players, and Carr began selling chalk in small boxes. He called it \\"twisting powder\\", and the magical impression this gave the public enabled him to sell it for a higher price than if they realized it was simply chalk in a small box. \\"\\", an American term for sidespin, derives from the British discovery of sidespin's effects, as \\"mass√©\\" comes from the French word for \\"mace\\".  Types  Pool and snooker cues average around in length and are of three major types. The simplest type is a one-piece cue; these are generally stocked in pool halls for communal use. They have a uniform taper, meaning they decrease in diameter evenly from the end or butt to the tip. A second type is the two-piece cue, divided in the middle for ease of transport, usually in a cue case or pouch. A third variety is another two-piece cue, but with a joint located three- quarters down the cue (usually 12 or 16 inches away from the butt), known as a \\"three-quarter two-piece\\", used by snooker players. = Pool = A typical two piece cue for pocket billiards is usually made mostly of hard or rock maple, with a fiberglass or phenolic resin , usually long, and steel and . Pool cues average around long, are commonly available in weights, with being the most common, and usually have a diameter in the range of 12 to 14 mm. A conical , with the gradually shrinking in diameter from joint to ferrule, is favored by some, but the \\"pro\\" taper is increasingly popular, straight for most of the length of the shaft from ferrule back, flaring to joint diameter only in the last to of the shaft. While there are many custom cuemakers, a very large number of quality pool cues are manufactured in bulk. In recent years, modern materials such as fiberglass, carbon fiber, aluminum, etc., have been used more and more for shafts and butts. A trend toward experimentation has also developed with rubber, memory foam and other soft . = Carom = Carom billiards cues tend to be shorter and lighter than pool cues, with a shorter ferrule, a thicker and joint, a wooden joint pin (ideally) and collarless wood-to-wood joint, a conical taper, and a smaller tip diameter. Typical dimensions are long, in weight, with an 11‚Äì12 mm diameter tip. The specialization makes the cue stiffer, for handling the heavier billiard balls and acting to reduce . The wood used in carom cues can vary widely, and most quality carom cues are handmade. = Snooker = Snooker cue with two detachable extensions At , a cue designed for snooker is usually shorter than the typical 59 inch pool cue and has detachable butt for making the cue longer or more.See online and offline retailers. Virtually all modern snooker cues are 56.5 to 59 inches, with a 57 inch length accounting for about 90% of the market (of major manufacturers, only one defaults to 58 inches). Weights range from 15 to 19 ounces (0.48‚Äì54‚Äìkg) High-end cues are almost always compatible with one or more butt extension types, and often include one. Many snooker cues are jointed, usually with brass fittings, or even of the way back toward the butt , providing an unusually long shaft, rather than at the half-way point, where pool and carom cues are jointed. This necessitates an extra long cue case. Some models are jointed in two places, with the long shaft having a smooth and subtle wood-to-wood joint. Snooker cue tips are usually 8.5 ‚Äì 10.5 mm in diameter to provide more accuracy and finesse with snooker balls, which are smaller than pool and carom varieties. Snooker butts are usually flat on one side so that the cue may be laid flat on the table and slid along the baize under a to strike the cushion-ward side of the when it is to the cushion (such a shot is not legal in pool or carom games under most rulesets). This tactile flat part of the butt also helps the player develop a very specific way of holding the cue, consistent on every shot for a very uniform (snooker, in the case of many if not most shots, requires much more precision than pool). Snooker cue weights vary between 16 and 18 oz. While a lighter cue is usually for beginners to develop correct technique when starting out, some professional snooker players use lighter cues (15 ‚Äì 16 1/2 oz.), Joe Davis, John Spencer, Terry Griffiths, Mark Williams and Paul Hunter, to name a few. The balance point of a cue is usually 16 to 18 inches from the butt end. Minimum length for a snooker cue The official rules of both snooker and billiards state that \\"A cue shall be not less than 3 ft (914 mm) in length and shall show no change from the traditional tapered shape and form, with a tip, used to strike the cue-ball, secured to the thinner end.\\" This rule was introduced following an incident on 14 November 1938 when Alec Brown was playing Tom Newman at Thurston's Hall in the 1938/1939 Daily Mail Gold Cup. In the third frame, Brown potted a red, after which the cue ball was left amidst several reds, with only a narrow way through to the black, the only colour not snookered, and which was near its spot. Playing this with conventional equipment would have been awkward. To the surprise of spectators, Brown produced a small fountain pen-sized cue from his vest pocket, chalked it, and played the stroke. Newman protested at this. The referee, Charles Chambers, then inspected the implement, a strip of ebony about five inches long, with one end having a cue tip. Chambers decided to award a foul, and awarded Newman seven points. In response to questions, the referee quoted the rule that said all strokes must be made with the tip of the cue, so he did not regard the \\"fountain-pen cue\\" as a valid cue. Eight days later, the Billiards Association and Control Council, which owned the rules, met and decided to introduce a new rule, which has been developed into today's version: \\"A billiards cue, as recognised by the Billiards and Control Council, shall not be less than three feet in length, and shall show no substantial departure from the traditional and generally accepted shape and form.\\" = Speciality = Manufacturers also provide a variety of specialty cues tailored to specific shots. Pool break cues have tips made from very hard leather (sometimes layered) or phenolic resin to ensure that the full force of the stroke is transferred to the cue ball during the , and to avoid excessive wear-and-tear on the tips and ferrules of players' main shooting cues. Phenolic-tipped break cues often have a merged phenolic ferrule-tip, instead of two separate pieces. Jump cues are shorter, lighter (12 ounces and less) cues that make performing a legal easier, and also often have a very hard tip. Some standard-sized break cues include a two-piece butt allowing a player to remove the lower, heavier half of the butt to produce a jump cue; these are usually referred to as jump‚Äìbreak or break‚Äìjump cues. The uncommon mass√© cue is short and heavy, with a wider tip to aid in making . Practitioners of artistic billiards and artistic pool sometimes have twenty or more cues, each specifically tailored to a particular trick shot. Other specialty cues have multiple sections, between which weights can be added. Another specialization is the butt extension, which can be slipped over or screwed into the normal butt, to lengthen the cue and reduce dependency on the . A high quality two-piece cue with a nearly invisible wood- to-wood , so that it looks like a cheap one-piece , is called a '. Such a cue may be used by a hustler to temporarily fool unsuspecting gamblers into thinking that he or she is a novice.  Shaft  Shafts are made with various tapers, the two most common being the pro taper and the European taper. The pro taper has the same diameter from the tip to 30‚Äì35 cm (12‚Äì14 inches) toward the joint, at which point it begins to widen. The European taper widens continually and smoothly from the ferrule toward the joint. Despite their names, the continually sloping European taper is found in most North American bar and house cues, and not all professional players prefer a straight pro taper on their custom, two-piece models. = Tip = Dime- and nickel-radius cue tips (left to right, respectively) Billiard chalk Layered (laminated) tip Cue tip shaper Leather tips of varying curvature and degrees of hardness are glued to (or in some cases screwed into) the ferrule. The de facto standard curvatures for a pool tip are dime- and nickel-radius, determined by shaping a tip so that when one puts a nickel or dime to it, they have the same curvature. The tip end of the cue will vary in diameter but is typically in the 9 to 14 millimeter range with 12‚Äì13 mm for pool cues, and 9‚Äì10 mm for Snooker cues being most common. Rounder (i.e., smaller radius) tips impart to the cue ball more easily since the point of contact between the tip and the ball requires less distance from the center hit to impart the same amount of spin, due to the increased tangential contact. Tips for break and jump cues are usually nickel radius or even flatter, and sometimes made of harder materials such as phenolic resin; the shots are forceful, and usually require less spin. A leather tip naturally compresses and hardens with subsequent shots. Without proper care, the surface of the tip can develop an undesired smoothness or glossiness which can significantly reduce the desired friction between the tip and the cue ball. Cue chalk is applied to the tip of the cue, ideally after every other shot or so, to help achieve the desired friction and minimize the chance of a . This is especially important when the cue tip does not hit the cue ball in its center and thereby imparts spin to the cue ball. There are different grades of hardness for tips, ranging from very soft to very hard. Softer tips (major brands include Elk Master and Blue Diamond) hold chalk better, but tend to degrade faster from abrasion (from chalk and scuffers), shaping (from cue tip shapers/tackers/picks), and mushrooming (the sides of the tip bulge out from long normal use or from hard hits that compact the tip in all directions). Harder tips (major brands include Blue Diamond Plus, Triangle and Le Professional or \\"Le Pro\\") maintain their shape much better, but because of their hardness, chalk tends to not hold as well as it does on softer tips. The hardness of a leather tip is determined from its compression and tanning during the manufacturing process. All cue tips once were of a one-piece construction, as are many today (including LePro and Triangle). More recently some tips are made of layers that are laminated together (major brands include Kamui, Moori and Talisman). Harder tips and laminated tips hold their shape better than softer tips and one-piece tips. Laminated tips generally cost more than one-piece tips due to their more extensive manufacturing process. A potential problem with layered tips is delamination, where a layer begins to separate from another or the tip completely comes apart. This is not common and usually results from improper installation, misuse of tip tools, or high impact mass√© shots. One-piece tips are not subject to this problem, but they do tend to mushroom more easily. These days there are synthetic, '-leather or even rubber cue tips available that have similar playing characteristics to animal-hide tips. Often these are less affected by moisture and humidity than leather tips, tend less to bulge and mis-shapen, and are suitable substitutes for the average player. = Ferrule = The end of the shaft has a cuff known as the ferrule, which is used to hold the cue tip in place and to bear the brunt of impact with the cue ball so that the less resilient shaft wood does not split. Ferrules are no longer made of ivory, but, rather, are now made of carbon fiber, or a plastic such as melamine resin, or phenolic resin, which are extremely durable, high- impact materials that are resistant to cracking, chipping, and breaking. Brass ferrules are sometimes used, especially for snooker cues.  Joint  The heavy, lower piece of the cue is the cue butt, and the smaller, narrower end is the shaft. The two cue pieces are attached at the joint; normally a screw rising from butt end's joint (male) is threaded into a receptacle on the shaft (female), or vice versa. The joints are made of various materials, most frequently a plastic, brass, stainless steel, or wood outer layer, but some custom cues are made of bone, antlers, or other more expensive materials that are less common, but serve the same effect. Most snooker cues have brass-to- brass joints. The internal male and female connection points are almost always brass or steel because they respond less to temperature changes and thus expand and contract less than other materials, preserving the life of the cue. Joints have different sizes as well as different male and female ends on the shaft and butts of the cues. Traditional designs employ a fully threaded connection, while newer versions (marketed under such names as Uni-loc, Accu- loc, Speed-loc, and Tru-loc) employ half-threaded \\"quick pin release\\" connections that allow players to assemble and disassemble their cues faster.  Butt  The bulk of the weight of the cue is usually distributed in the cue butt portion. Whether the weight be 16 oz. or 22 oz., the weight change is mainly in the butt (usually in the core, under the wrap). Butts have varying constructions, from three-piece to one-piece, as well as other custom versions that people have developed. These translate into different \\"feels\\" because of the distribution of weight as well as the balance point of the cue. Traditionally, players want the balance point of a cue near the top end of the wrap or around 7 inches from where they grip the butt. Some brands, and most custom cuemakers offer weights, usually metal discs of 1 to 2 ounces, that can be added at one or more places to adjust the balance and total weight and feel of the cue. The cue butt is often inlaid with exotic woods such as cocobolo and bocote as well as other materials such as ebony and mother of pearl. Usually parts of the butt are sectioned off with decorative rings. The use of various types of wraps on the cue butt, such as Irish linen or leather, provide a player with a better grip as well as absorbing moisture. Low-priced cues usually feature a nylon wrap which is considered not as good a \\"feel\\" as Irish Linen. Fiberglass and Graphite cues usually have a \\"Veltex\\" grip that is made of fiberglass/graphite, but is smoother and not glossy. Some people also prefer a cue with no wrap, and thus just a glossed finish on wood. Sometimes these no-wrap cues are more decorated because of the increased area for design and imagination. The butts of less expensive cues are usually spliced hardwood and a plastic covering while more high-end cues use solid rosewood or ebony. Snooker cues might be just the wood, waxed or oiled (bees wax, linseed oil). = Bumper = The final part a cue is the bumper, made of rubber (pool) or leather (snooker). Though often considered less important than other parts of a cue, this part is essential for protecting a cue. The bumper protects the cue when it rests on the ground or accidentally hits a wall, table, etc. Without the bumper, such impacts might crack the butt over an extended period of time. The \\"feel\\" of the cue (see below) is also an issue ‚Äì without the bumper, the resonance of the cue hitting the cue ball may vibrate differently than in a cue with a properly attached, tight bumper. Though small, the bumper also adds some weight on the end of the cue, preserving a balance that also impacts the feel of a cue.  Materials and design  Longoni cues A cue can be either hand- or machine-spliced. The choice of materials used in the construction of the cue butt and the artistry of the design can lead to cues of great beauty and high price. Good quality pool cues are customarily made from straight-grained hard rock maple wood, especially the shaft. Snooker cues, by contrast, are almost always made of ash wood, although one might come across one with a maple shaft. Maple is stiffer than ash, and cheaper. Cues are not always for play, some are purely collectible and can reach prices of tens of thousands of dollars for the materials they are made of and their exquisite craftsmanship. A good cue needn't be expensive. These \\"collector\\" cues have fine workmanship and use top quality materials. They are designed with ornate inlays in varying types of wood, precious metals and stones, all in a multitude of styles and sometimes displaying works of art. The inlays are stained, translucent, transparent or painted. These cues are also valued because of how well they perform. Competitors of custom cue makers and mass- production manufacturers usually try to make cues look like they are made of expensive materials by using overlays and decals. Although these lower the cost of the cues, they do not degrade the cues' effectiveness in game play. Another mark of quality is the precision with which inlays are set. High quality inlays fit perfectly with no gaps; they are symmetrical on all sides, as well as cut cleanly so that all edges and points are sharp, not rounded. The use of machines has aided much in the production of high quality inlays and other ornaments. = Notable makers = There have been a number of cue makers over the years; among them are George Balabushka, Herman Rambow, John Parris (Church Vale, London), Hunt & O'Byrne (Butler's Wharf, London), Palmer, Longoni, Samsara, Southwest, Szamboti, and Tascarella, whose cues are often very valuable to collectors.

At the Second Congress of the RSDLP in London (1903), Vladimir Lenin and Julius Martov, the two main leaders, confronted each other in an ideological split over party tactics (Martov argued for a large party of activists, whilst Lenin wanted a small group of professional revolutionaries with a large fringe group of sympathisers). Frunze at the age of 18 sided with Lenin's majority, the so- called Bolsheviks (\\"majoritarians\\"), as opposed to Martov's minority, the Mensheviks (or \\"minoritarians\\"). Two years after the Second Congress, Frunze became an important leader in the 1905 Revolution. He led striking textile workers in Shuya and Ivanovo. Following the end of the movement, Frunze was arrested in 1907 and sentenced to death; he was imprisoned and spent several months on death row awaiting his execution.–¢—Ä–∏—É–º—Ñ –∏ –¢—Ä–∞–≥–µ–¥–∏—è - –ò. –í. –°—Ç–∞–ª–∏–Ω: –ø–æ–ª–∏—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π –ø–æ—Ä—Ç—Ä–µ—Ç.

During the February Revolution of 1917, Frunze headed the Minsk civilian militia before his election as president of the Byelorussian Soviet. He later went to Moscow and led an armed force of workers to aid in the struggle for control of the city. Russian Civil War B√©la Kun, Alfred Rosmer , Leon Trotsky, Mikhail Frunze and Sergey Gusev. Kharkiv Ukraine 1920. After the October Revolution of 1917, Frunze was appointed in 1918 as Military Commissar for the Ivanovo-Voznesensk Province. In the course of the Russian Civil War of 1917-1922, he was appointed as head of the Southern Army Group of the (March 1919). After Frunze's troops defeated Admiral Alexander Kolchak and the White Army in Omsk, Leon Trotsky (the head of the Red Army) gave overall command of the Eastern Front to him (19 July 1919). Frunze drove out Basmachi insurgents and White Army troops from his native Turkestan. He captured Khiva in February and Bukhara in September 1920. In November 1920, Frunze's army took the Crimea and managed to push White general Pyotr Wrangel and his troops out of Russia. As commander of the southern front, Frunze also led the destruction of Nestor Makhno's anarchist movement in Ukraine and the nationalist movement of Symon Petliura. In December 1921, Frunze visited Ankara, during Turkish War of Independence, as an ambassador of the Ukrainian SSR, and established Turkish‚ÄìSoviet relations. Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk valued him as an ally and a friend, to the extent that he placed a statue of Frunze as a part of the Republic Monument at the Taksim Square, in Istanbul.

In 1921, Frunze was elected to the Central Committee of the Russian Bolshevik Party. On 2 June 1924 he became candidate member of the Politburo and in January 1925, became the Chairman of the Revolutionary Military Council. Frunze's support of Grigory Zinoviev brought him into conflict with Joseph Stalin, one of Zinoviev's chief opponents.

It reverted to its former name in 1991, after dissolution of the Soviet Union. Frunze is still commemorated in the city: his equestrian statue stands in front of the main railway station. A street and a museum in the centre of the city are named after him. In addition, the museum contains his childhood home, a cottage that was installed inside a larger modern structure. Shuya is home to another memorial museum dedicated to Frunze. Multiple villages in Russia were named for him. Streets in many Russian cities are named after him. The Frunze Military Academy in Moscow, one of the most respected in the former Soviet Union, was named in his honour. The Soviet 2nd Rifle Division was formerly known as 2nd Belarusian Red Banner Rifle Division in the name of M.V. Frunze. There are stations named Frunzenskaya in his honour on the Moscow Metro, Saint Petersburg Metro and Minsk Metro, and a stone carving of his likeness stands at one end of the station. The Nemyshlyanskyi District of Kharkiv, Ukraine, was formerly named Frunzensky District. In 2016 it was renamed to its current name to comply with decommunization laws. Kharkiv renamed 5 metro stations and four districts, RBC Ukraine (18 May 2016) After his death, the first name for boys Frunzik (roughly \\"Little Frunze\\") became quite popular in the Caucusus and Soviet Turkestan. The most notable of these is probably Frunzik Mkrtchyan.http://kino.ukr.net/persons/543/ The Russian battleship Poltava was renamed Frunze in his honour in January 1926, as was the second Kirov-class nuclear battlecruiser (now the \\"Admiral Lazarev\\") in 1981. General Frunze is also honoured with a place right behind Ataturk, in the Monument of the Republic, located at the heart of Taksim Square, in Istanbul, Turkey. Literary depictions Boris Pilnyak's story \\"The Tale of the Unextinguished Moon\\" was based on Frunze's death. His death also forms the central element of the first two chapters of Vasily Aksyonov's novel Generations of Winter. Marxist activist Tariq Ali featured Frunze in his 2017 biography of Vladimir Lenin, The Dilemmas of Lenin. Ali portrays Frunze as a significant figure in developing the military tactics of the Red Army during the civil war. He emphasizes Frunze's concept of Marxist military tactics, which strongly influenced Soviet military organization.

During his early career, he often led trade caravans to Syria. He had been among the main leaders of Meccan opposition to Muhammad, the prophet of Islam and member of the Quraysh, commanding the Meccans at the battles of Uhud and the Trench in 625 and 627. However, when Muhammad entered Mecca in 630, Abu Sufyan was among the first to submit and was given a stake in the nascent Muslim state, playing a role at the Battle of Hunayn and the subsequent destruction of the polytheistic sanctuary of al-Lat in Ta'if. After Muhammad's death, he may have been appointed the governor of Najran by Caliph Abu Bakr () for an unspecified period. Abu Sufyan later played a supporting role in the Muslim army at the Battle of Yarmouk against the Byzantines in Syria. His sons Yazid and later Mu'awiya were given command roles in that province and the latter went on to establish the Umayyad Caliphate in 661. Life = Early career = Abu Sufyan's given name was Sakhr and he was born in 565 to father Harb ibn Umayya, a leader of the Quraysh tribe of Mecca,Watt 1960, p. 151. and mother Safiyya bint Hazn ibn Bujayr. The family belonged to the Banu Abd Shams clan of the Quraysh, the brother clan of the Banu Hashim, to which the Islamic prophet Muhammad belonged. Abu Sufyan was among the leaders of the Qurayshi opposition to Muhammad in the years preceding the Hijrah (emigration of Muhammad and his followers from Mecca to Medina in 622). A prominent financier and merchant, Abu Sufyan engaged in trade in Syria, often heading Meccan caravans to the region. He owned land in the vicinity of Damascus.Madelung 1997, p. 45.Donner 1981, p. 96. = Opposition to Islam = In 624, a caravan Abu Sufyan was leading back to Mecca from Syria faced an assault by Muhammad, prompting him to send for aid. In response, a 1,000-strong Meccan army led by Abu Jahl was dispatched. In the ensuing confrontation, Abu Sufyan, \\"by skillful and vigorous leadership eluded the Muslims\\", according to the historian W. Montgomery Watt. However, under Abu Jahl's command, the Meccans pursued a direct confrontation with the Muslims, which resulted in the rout of the Quraysh at the Battle of Badr. Abu Jahl and the father of Abu Sufyan's wife, Utbah ibn Rabi'ah, were slain. Abu Sufyan's son Hanzala was also killed and another son, Amr, was taken captive, but released. In the aftermath, Abu Sufyan was charged with avenging Meccan losses, the command he held likely being hereditary. He inflicted significant losses on the Muslims at the Battle of Uhud in 625, but the Quraysh were generally unsatisfied with the battle's results. Two years later, he led the attempted siege of Medina, but was defeated by the Muslim defenders at the Battle of the Trench. His morale may have taken a blow from this failure, as Meccan command in the war with Muhammad passed to his Qurayshi rivals, Safwan ibn Umayya, Ikrima ibn Abi Jahl and Suhayl ibn Amr. = Conversion to Islam = Though he did not participate in the truce negotiations at Hudaybiyya in 628, he held peace talks with Muhammad in Medina when the Quraysh broke the truce. Information about the results of these talks is unclear, but Watt surmises that Abu Sufyan and Muhammad entered into an understanding of sorts. When Muhammad conquered Mecca in 630, Abu Sufyan played a key role in the city's surrender, being among the first Qurayshi leaders to submit and guaranteeing protection for his partisans. He fought alongside the Muslims at the Battle of Hunayn against the Banu Thaqif of Ta'if, traditional rivals of Mecca, and the latter's tribal backers from the Hawazin confederation. During this battle, which ended in a decisive Muslim victory, he lost an eye, and was rewarded a relatively high percentage of the spoils for his valor. Because of his past trade relations with Ta'if, where he also owned property and had kinsmen, Abu Sufyan played a leading role in the dismantlement of the pagan sanctuary of al-Lat in the city. Later life and death Abu Sufyan was appointed the governor of Najran, in southern Arabia, either by Muhammad or more likely, by the first caliph, Abu Bakr (). He initially opposed the latter's succession of Muhammad as leader of the nascent Muslim state. Abu Sufyan, seeing no hope that a member of the Banu Abd Shams could attain the role, aimed to keep the leadership in the hands of his next closest kinsmen, the Banu Hashim, specifically Ali ibn Abi Talib, a cousin, son-in-law and early supporter of Muhammad.Madelung 1997, p. 40. According to the historian Wilferd Madelung, Abu Sufyan, by dint of his chieftainship of the Banu Abd Shams and the generosity he had received from Muhammad, was duty-bound by a tribal code of honor to offer Ali such support, as doing otherwise \\"would have been shameful\\". Ali, however, refused his support, citing Abu Sufyan's late conversion to Islam and the potential backlash from the Muslim community should he accept his backing.Madelung 1997, pp. 40‚Äì41. Western historians generally dismiss this episode as propaganda by the Muslim traditional sources, which were traditionally hostile to the Umayyads,Madelung 1997, p. 41. the branch of the Banu Abd Shams to which Abu Sufyan belonged and which ultimately became the ruling family of the Caliphate in 661 until 750. Abu Bakr ordered the Muslim conquest of the Levant, in which he gave the Banu Abd Shams a stake, despite their early opposition to him, which he sought to allay. Abu Sufyan's son Yazid was ultimately appointed to a leading command role in the conquest. Abu Sufyan was present at the Battle of Yarmouk, which resulted in a decisive Muslim victory against the Byzantines in Syria. His advanced age at the time renders it unlikely that he actively participated in the battle. According to an account cited by Sayf ibn Umar, he observed the battle alongside unspecified Arab sheikhs (chieftains), and accounts cited by al-Tabari further note that he \\"exhorted\\" the Muslim troops.Donner 1981, p. 362. His son Yazid held a command role in the battle and later died in a plague in Palestine in 639. Another of his sons, Mu'awiya, was appointed the governor of Syria by Caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab (). Umar's successor, Uthman ibn Affan (), shared descent with Abu Sufyan from Umayya ibn Abd Shams and was known to show special favor to his kinsmen. To that end, he symbolically honored Abu Sufyan, along with al-Hakam ibn Abi al-As and al-Walid ibn Uqba of the Umayyad line of the Banu Abd Shams, and al-Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib of the Banu Hashim, by allowing them to sit on his throne in Medina.Madelung 1997, p. 109.

In 1643, owing to his friendship with the head French minister Cardinal Jules Mazarin, he became Secretary of State for Military Affairs (known as 'Secretary of State for War' during that era), and was known as being an efficient administrator. He was active in the troubles associated with the aristocratic Fronde uprising, remaining loyal to Cardinal Mazarin and to the state.; In 1677 he was made Chancellor of France. One of his major contributions as chancellor included his transformation of the royal army into a considerably larger, more professional force that helped impose the absolute rule of Louis XIV, helping to ensure France's dominance of Europe. As Chancellor, he also reestablished, in April 1679, the teaching of Civil Law at the University of Paris after Pope Honorius III had prohibited it on 11 May 1219.Luc-Normand Tellier, Face aux Colbert: les Le Tellier, Vauban, Turgot et l'av√®nement du lib√©ralisme, PUQ, 1987, p. 310.

TDCC datasheet 7,65 Parabellum and also known as .30 Luger and 7.65mm Luger) is a pistol cartridge that was introduced in 1898 by German arms manufacturer Deutsche Waffen- und Munitionsfabriken (DWM) for their new Pistol Parabellum. The primary developers of the pistol cartridge were firearms designers Georg Luger and Hugo Borchardt, who developed the round from the earlier 7.65√ó25mm Borchardt while working at DWM. Development In 1897, the C-93 Borchardt pistol was submitted for testing to the Swiss Military Trials Committee. The committee found the Borchardt too heavy and unwieldy to serve as a military sidearm. Georg Luger was asked by DWM to improve upon the Borchardt pistol. He developed the 7.65√ó21mm Parabellum cartridge from the 7.65√ó25mm Borchardt. By shortening the cartridge case, Luger was able to design a narrower grip, and the toggle action required a shorter stroke than in the original Borchardt design. A transitional Borchardt-Luger model in the new caliber was submitted to the Swiss commission in 1898. After further improvements, the final result became the DWM Pistole-Parabellum (\\"Luger pistol\\"). The loading for the new cartridge was standardized and mass production began in 1900‚Äì1901 in DWM's factory in Karlsruhe, Germany. Around 1903, a separate load was developed for Parabellum carbines, with about 20% more powder (increased from the standard 0.32‚Äì0.35 g to 0.40 g) and a blackened cartridge case. This carbine load was manufactured until sometime after World War I. History and usage Swiss Army 7.65mm Parabellum last batch Swiss Parabellum Model 1900 service pistol Since its introduction, 7.65√ó21mm Parabellum ammunition has been manufactured in several countries for both domestic use and for export, including Germany, Switzerland, Finland, France, Portugal, Brazil, the United Kingdom, and the United States. With the adoption of the Luger Parabellum Model 1900 pistol in 1900, the 7.65mm Luger became the standard pistol cartridge of the Swiss Army. The Swiss Modell 06/29 pistol served the Swiss Army until well after the adoption of a SIG P210 in 1948/9, and remained in limited service until the late 1960s. The SIG P210 was also manufactured in this caliber, but only for civilian use; Swiss military issues of the P210 were chambered in 9√ó19mm Parabellum. The 7.65mm Parabellum was replaced by the German Army with the 9√ó19mm Parabellum cartridge. This involved simply expanding the bottleneck of the 7.65mm Luger cartridge to accept a 9mm bullet. Due to the almost identical case width, rim width, and overall length of the cartridges, most 7.65mm Parabellum firearms can be converted to 9mm Parabellum, and vice versa, with only a change of barrel. Around 1900, Brazilian armed forces adopted the round for use in German-made Parabellum pistols (partially replacing the Simson Nagant-style revolver) and, later, in some Schmeisser MP-28 II submachine guns made in Belgium under license. It remained in limited use by some police forces up through the 1970s, such as the former Guanabara State Police (based in Rio de Janeiro). The Luger pistol in 7.65mm was adopted by the Finnish in 1923 with the designation Parabellum Pistooli 23, abbreviated m/23. About 8,000 pistols were delivered, but few survived the war. Many of these pistols were rebarreled to 9mm, and a limited quantity remained in storage until 1980 for arming noncombat personnel. The Finnish Lahti L-35 pistol, a 1929 design introduced in 1935 to replace the Luger pistol, was also originally chambered in 7.65mm Parabellum before it, too, was switched over to the 9mm Parabellum. In addition to the Luger Parabellum and the SIG P210, several other handguns have been manufactured in this caliber, mainly for commercial sale in countries that restrict civilian use of contemporary military calibers such as 9mm Parabellum. Examples include the Astra A-80, Benelli B80, Beretta M952, Beretta 92, Browning Hi-Power, Colt Commander, Mamba, some models of the Ruger P series, the SIG Sauer P220, and Walther P38 and P38K. A handful of submachine guns have been manufactured in this caliber, notably the SIG Bergmann 1920 (the licensed Swiss version of the Bergmann MP-18/1), the Swiss Furrer submachine gun, and its double-barreled aerial counterpart the Flieger- Doppelpistole 1919, the M/Neuhausen MKMS, the Austrian MP34, and the Suomi M-26.

In mathematics, the Riemann sphere, named after Bernhard Riemann,B. Riemann: Theorie der Abel'sche Funktionen, J. Math. (Crelle) 1857; Werke 88-144. The name is due to Neumann C :Vorlesungen √ºber Riemanns Theorie der Abelsche Integrale, Leipzig 1865 (Teubner) is a model of the extended complex plane, the complex plane plus a point at infinity. This extended plane represents the extended complex numbers, that is, the complex numbers plus a value ‚àû for infinity. With the Riemann model, the point \\"‚àû\\" is near to very large numbers, just as the point \\"0\\" is near to very small numbers. The extended complex numbers are useful in complex analysis because they allow for division by zero in some circumstances, in a way that makes expressions such as \\\\tfrac{1}{0}=\\\\infty well-behaved. For example, any rational function on the complex plane can be extended to a holomorphic function on the Riemann sphere, with the poles of the rational function mapping to infinity. More generally, any meromorphic function can be thought of as a holomorphic function whose codomain is the Riemann sphere. In geometry, the Riemann sphere is the prototypical example of a Riemann surface, and is one of the simplest complex manifolds. In projective geometry, the sphere can be thought of as the complex projective line P1(C), the projective space of all complex lines in C2. As with any compact Riemann surface, the sphere may also be viewed as a projective algebraic curve, making it a fundamental example in algebraic geometry. It also finds utility in other disciplines that depend on analysis and geometry, such as the Bloch sphere of quantum mechanics and in other branches of physics. The extended complex plane is also called closed complex plane. Extended complex numbers The extended complex numbers consist of the complex numbers C together with ‚àû. The set of extended complex numbers may be written as C ‚à™ {‚àû}, and is often denoted by adding some decoration to the letter C, such as :\\\\hat{\\\\mathbb{C}},\\\\quad\\\\overline{\\\\mathbb{C}},\\\\quad\\\\text{or}\\\\quad\\\\mathbb{C}_\\\\infty. Geometrically, the set of extended complex numbers is referred to as the Riemann sphere (or extended complex plane). =Arithmetic operations= Addition of complex numbers may be extended by defining, for z ‚àà C, :z + \\\\infty = \\\\infty for any complex number z, and multiplication may be defined by :z \\\\times \\\\infty = \\\\infty for all nonzero complex numbers z, with ‚àû √ó ‚àû = ‚àû. Note that ‚àû ‚Äì ‚àû and 0 √ó ‚àû are left undefined. Unlike the complex numbers, the extended complex numbers do not form a field, since ‚àû does not have a multiplicative inverse. Nonetheless, it is customary to define division on C ‚à™ {‚àû} by :\\\\frac{z}{0} = \\\\infty\\\\quad\\\\text{and}\\\\quad \\\\frac{z}{\\\\infty} = 0 for all nonzero complex numbers z, with = ‚àû and = 0\\\\. The quotients and are left undefined. =Rational functions= Any rational function (in other words, f(z) is the ratio of polynomial functions g(z) and h(z) of z with complex coefficients, such that g(z) and h(z) have no common factor) can be extended to a continuous function on the Riemann sphere. Specifically, if z0 is a complex number such that the denominator h(z0) is zero but the numerator g(z0) is nonzero, then f(z0) can be defined as ‚àû. Moreover, f(‚àû) can be defined as the limit of f(z) as , which may be finite or infinite. The set of complex rational functions ‚Äî whose mathematical symbol is C(z) ‚Äî form all possible holomorphic functions from the Riemann sphere to itself, when it is viewed as a Riemann surface, except for the constant function taking the value ‚àû everywhere. The functions of C(z) form an algebraic field, known as the field of rational functions on the sphere. For example, given the function :f(z) = \\\\frac{6z^2 + 1}{2z^2 - 50} we may define , since the denominator is zero at , and since as . Using these definitions, f becomes a continuous function from the Riemann sphere to itself. As a complex manifold As a one-dimensional complex manifold, the Riemann sphere can be described by two charts, both with domain equal to the complex number plane C. Let Œ∂ be a complex number in one copy of C, and let Œæ be a complex number in another copy of C. Identify each nonzero complex number Œ∂ of the first C with the nonzero complex number of the second C. Then the map :f(z) = \\\\frac{1}{z} is called the transition map between the two copies of C ‚Äî the so-called charts ‚Äî glueing them together. Since the transition maps are holomorphic, they define a complex manifold, called the Riemann sphere. As a complex manifold of 1 complex dimension (i.e., 2 real dimensions), this is also called a Riemann surface. Intuitively, the transition maps indicate how to glue two planes together to form the Riemann sphere. The planes are glued in an \\"inside-out\\" manner, so that they overlap almost everywhere, with each plane contributing just one point (its origin) missing from the other plane. In other words, (almost) every point in the Riemann sphere has both a Œ∂ value and a Œæ value, and the two values are related by . The point where should then have Œ∂-value \\"\\"; in this sense, the origin of the Œæ-chart plays the role of \\"‚àû\\" in the Œ∂-chart. Symmetrically, the origin of the Œ∂-chart plays the role of ‚àû in the Œæ-chart. Topologically, the resulting space is the one-point compactification of a plane into the sphere. However, the Riemann sphere is not merely a topological sphere. It is a sphere with a well-defined complex structure, so that around every point on the sphere there is a neighborhood that can be biholomorphically identified with C. On the other hand, the uniformization theorem, a central result in the classification of Riemann surfaces, states that every simply-connected Riemann surface is biholomorphic to the complex plane, the hyperbolic plane, or the Riemann sphere. Of these, the Riemann sphere is the only one that is a closed surface (a compact surface without boundary). Hence the two-dimensional sphere admits a unique complex structure turning it into a one-dimensional complex manifold. As the complex projective line The Riemann sphere can also be defined as the complex projective line. The points of the complex projective line are equivalence classes established by the following relation on points from C2 \\\\ {(0,0)}: :If for some Œª ‚â† 0, w = Œªu and z = Œªv, then (w,z) \\\\thicksim (u,v). In this case the equivalence class is written [w, z] using projective coordinates. Given any point [w, z] in the complex projective line, one of w and z must be non-zero, say w ‚â† 0. Then by the equivalence relation, :[w, z] \\\\thicksim \\\\left[1, \\\\tfrac{z}{w} \\\\right] which is in a chart for the Riemann sphere manifold.William Mark Goldman (1999) Complex Hyperbolic Geometry, page 1, Clarendon Press This treatment of the Riemann sphere connects most readily to projective geometry. For example, any line (or smooth conic) in the complex projective plane is biholomorphic to the complex projective line. It is also convenient for studying the sphere's automorphisms, later in this article. As a sphere Stereographic projection of a complex number A onto a point Œ± of the Riemann sphere The Riemann sphere can be visualized as the unit sphere x2 + y2 + z2 = 1 in the three-dimensional real space R3. To this end, consider the stereographic projection from the unit sphere minus the point (0, 0, 1) onto the plane z = 0, which we identify with the complex plane by . In Cartesian coordinates and spherical coordinates on the sphere (with Œ∏ the zenith and œÜ the azimuth), the projection is :\\\\zeta = \\\\frac{x + i y}{1 - z} = \\\\cot\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\theta\\\\right) \\\\; e^{i \\\\phi}. Similarly, stereographic projection from onto the plane , identified with another copy of the complex plane by , is written :\\\\xi = \\\\frac{x - i y}{1 + z} = \\\\tan\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\theta\\\\right) \\\\; e^{-i \\\\phi}. In order to cover the unit sphere, one needs the two stereographic projections: the first will cover the whole sphere except the point and the second except the point . Hence, one needs two complex planes, one for each projection, which can be intuitively seen as glued back- to-back at . Note that the two complex planes are identified differently with the plane . An orientation-reversal is necessary to maintain consistent orientation on the sphere, and in particular complex conjugation causes the transition maps to be holomorphic. The transition maps between Œ∂-coordinates and Œæ-coordinates are obtained by composing one projection with the inverse of the other. They turn out to be and , as described above. Thus the unit sphere is diffeomorphic to the Riemann sphere. Under this diffeomorphism, the unit circle in the Œ∂-chart, the unit circle in the Œæ-chart, and the equator of the unit sphere are all identified. The unit disk is identified with the southern hemisphere , while the unit disk is identified with the northern hemisphere . Metric A Riemann surface does not come equipped with any particular Riemannian metric. The Riemann surface's conformal structure does, however, determine a class of metrics: all those whose subordinate conformal structure is the given one. In more detail: The complex structure of the Riemann surface does uniquely determine a metric up to conformal equivalence. (Two metrics are said to be conformally equivalent if they differ by multiplication by a positive smooth function.) Conversely, any metric on an oriented surface uniquely determines a complex structure, which depends on the metric only up to conformal equivalence. Complex structures on an oriented surface are therefore in one-to-one correspondence with conformal classes of metrics on that surface. Within a given conformal class, one can use conformal symmetry to find a representative metric with convenient properties. In particular, there is always a complete metric with constant curvature in any given conformal class. In the case of the Riemann sphere, the Gauss‚ÄìBonnet theorem implies that a constant-curvature metric must have positive curvature K. It follows that the metric must be isometric to the sphere of radius in R3 via stereographic projection. In the Œ∂-chart on the Riemann sphere, the metric with is given by :ds^2 = \\\\left(\\\\frac{2}{1+\\\\zeta^2}\\\\right)^2\\\\,d\\\\zeta^2 = \\\\frac{4}{\\\\left(1 + \\\\zeta \\\\bar \\\\zeta\\\\right)^2}\\\\,d\\\\zeta \\\\,d\\\\bar \\\\zeta. In real coordinates , the formula is :ds^2 = \\\\frac{4}{\\\\left(1 + u^2 + v^2\\\\right)^2} \\\\left(du^2 + dv^2\\\\right). Up to a constant factor, this metric agrees with the standard Fubini‚ÄìStudy metric on complex projective space (of which the Riemann sphere is an example). Up to scaling, this is the only metric on the sphere whose group of orientation-preserving isometries is 3-dimensional (and none is more than 3-dimensional); that group is called SO(3). In this sense, this is by far the most symmetric metric on the sphere. (The group of all isometries, known as O(3), is also 3-dimensional, but unlike SO(3) is not a connected space.) Conversely, let S denote the sphere (as an abstract smooth or topological manifold). By the uniformization theorem there exists a unique complex structure on S, up to conformal equivalence. It follows that any metric on S is conformally equivalent to the round metric. All such metrics determine the same conformal geometry. The round metric is therefore not intrinsic to the Riemann sphere, since \\"roundness\\" is not an invariant of conformal geometry. The Riemann sphere is only a conformal manifold, not a Riemannian manifold. However, if one needs to do Riemannian geometry on the Riemann sphere, the round metric is a natural choice (with any fixed radius, though radius = 1 is the simplest and most common choice). That is because only a round metric on the Riemann sphere has its isometry group be a 3-dimensional group. (Namely, the group known as SO(3), a continuous (\\"Lie\\") group that is topologically the 3-dimensional projective space P3.) Automorphisms A M√∂bius transformation acting on the sphere, and on the plane by stereographic projection The study of any mathematical object is aided by an understanding of its group of automorphisms, meaning the maps from the object to itself that preserve the essential structure of the object. In the case of the Riemann sphere, an automorphism is an invertible biholomorphic map from the Riemann sphere to itself. It turns out that the only such maps are the M√∂bius transformations. These are functions of the form :f(\\\\zeta) = \\\\frac{a \\\\zeta + b}{c \\\\zeta + d}, where a, b, c, and d are complex numbers such that . Examples of M√∂bius transformations include dilations, rotations, translations, and complex inversion. In fact, any M√∂bius transformation can be written as a composition of these. The M√∂bius transformations are homographies on the complex projective line. In projective coordinates, the transformation f can be written :[\\\\zeta,\\\\ 1] \\\\begin{pmatrix} a & c \\\\\\\\\\\\ b & d \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\ = \\\\ [a\\\\zeta + b,\\\\ c\\\\zeta + d] \\\\ = \\\\ \\\\left[ \\\\tfrac{a\\\\zeta + b}{c\\\\zeta + d},\\\\ 1 \\\\right] \\\\ = \\\\ [f(\\\\zeta),\\\\ 1]. Thus the M√∂bius transformations can be described as complex matrices with nonzero determinant. Since they act on projective coordinates, two matrices yield the same M√∂bius transformation if and only if they differ by a nonzero factor. The group of M√∂bius transformations is the projective linear group . If one endows the Riemann sphere with the Fubini‚ÄìStudy metric, then not all M√∂bius transformations are isometries; for example, the dilations and translations are not. The isometries form a proper subgroup of , namely PSU(2). This subgroup is isomorphic to the rotation group SO(3), which is the group of symmetries of the unit sphere in R3 (which, when restricted to the sphere, become the isometries of the sphere). Applications In complex analysis, a meromorphic function on the complex plane (or on any Riemann surface, for that matter) is a ratio of two holomorphic functions f and g. As a map to the complex numbers, it is undefined wherever g is zero. However, it induces a holomorphic map to the complex projective line that is well-defined even where . This construction is helpful in the study of holomorphic and meromorphic functions. For example, on a compact Riemann surface there are no non-constant holomorphic maps to the complex numbers, but holomorphic maps to the complex projective line are abundant. The Riemann sphere has many uses in physics. In quantum mechanics, points on the complex projective line are natural values for photon polarization states, spin states of massive particles of spin , and 2-state particles in general (see also Quantum bit and Bloch sphere). The Riemann sphere has been suggested as a relativistic model for the celestial sphere. In string theory, the worldsheets of strings are Riemann surfaces, and the Riemann sphere, being the simplest Riemann surface, plays a significant role. It is also important in twistor theory.

Geography  Badagry is situated on the south-west coast of Nigeria, bordered by the Gulf of Guinea to the south, it is 43 miles southeast of Lagos and 32 miles west of Seme, a border town in Benin Republic. Like Lagos Island, it is on the bank of inland lagoons, a system of creeks, waterways that are navigable to Lagos and Porto Novo. The distance between the lagoon and the ocean varies along the coast, in Badagry, the distance is about a mile. The depth of the lagoon varies according to the season, from highs of 3 meters to lows of a meter. The lagoons have a diverse fish population that includes bonga, croaker, longfin pompano, tilapia and catfish. The lagoon consists of brackish and freshwater with seasonal variability, west of Badagry, Yewa River provides water inflow to the lagoon. History There is a traditional Yoruba narrative that the first settlement within the area was an Awori group originally from Ile-Ife who lived at a nearby settlement. Robin Law, a scholar on West African history, notes an origin that sprouted out of a resettlement for displaced peoples of varied ethnic groups mostly Ogu/Ewe people and Oyo Yorubas. Another source links the people living at a settlement called Gberefu as the Ewe's of Oyo, an island along the Atlantic coast. One of the recorded notable events in the history of the town was the acquisition of land by a European trader who was locally known as Yovo Huntokonu. Many sources identify the European to be a Dutch trader called Hendrik Hertogh. Huntokonu, who came from the west, settled in the area after fleeing the wrath of an African chief. He reached the settlement called Apa under the Obaship of Alapa and he was given a farmland to use for trading. =1736‚Äì1840= Huntokonu set up a trading post on the gifted land ca 1736, and it was after Huntokonu's settlement that Badagry emerged as a slave port, serving principally as an outlet for Oyo and displacing Apa politically and commercially. During this period, political refugees fleeing aggression from king Agaja Trudo migrated to Badagry. Agaja who was seeking an outlet to the sea was warring across the coast and the resulting war caused an influx of people living along the coast of Weme, Ouidah, Allada, Jaki, and Popos to settle in Badagry. These group came to be known as Ogu. Each migrant group were affiliated with eight heterogeneous quarters and newly arrived immigrants settled in wards related to their state of origin. Badagry's wards were headed by commercial and political autonomous chiefs thereby creating a fragmented political structure. This flexibility was advantageous for trade but also caused internal instability. Slave trading was not as prominent in Badagry than it was in Bonny, Angola, Ouidah, and Calabar; in 1865, slaves transported out of Badagri were 800, while at Porto Novo, the figure was 1,200, and at Ouidah, up to 5,000 slaves were transported. The peak period of the slave trade in the city state was between 1736 and 1789, but the trade continued into the early nineteenth century, with Portueguese or Brazilian traders taking over from the Dutch. The rise of Badagry on the coast led to hostilities with Ouidah, which combined with Oyo and Lagos to sack the town in 1784. After the destruction, Jiwa, a political refugee from Porto-Novo took over the reins of most of the political structures between 1784 and 1788. In ca 1821, Oba Adele was exiled to Badagry , he proved to be a source of leadership, and was able to make Badagry a politically independent state. The founding of Abeokuta also proved beneficial to Badagry as the former made use of Badagry as an outlet for trading. IAdele was involved with the famous trader, Madam Tinubu and sided with Egba's in their conflict with Ota and Ijebu. Among Adele's followers from Lagos were Muslims, mostly servants from the Northern region, these group introduced Islam to the Ogu people in the city-state. After the British abolished the slave trade, notable trader Francisco F√©lix de Sousa migrated to Badagry around 1807. Trade in ivory, cloth and palm oil were also important economic activities of residents. Thomas Hutton established a presence in Badagri in 1838, other British traders followed in subsequent years. Unlike in the interior, Badagry's soil was not suitable for commercial agriculture, but farms were set up in areas surrounding the town. The palm oil trade was of considerable value to Badagry and was an illegal trade in slaves directed by Brazilians. The influence of anti-slave trade raids and cession of Badagry to Britain put a stop to the trade. =1840‚Äì1900= Badagri's location as a coastal town with links northwards to Abeokuta and Oyo made it a port of entry for emigrants from Sierra Leone and missionaries. Around 1837, a settled Sierra-Leonean emigrant of the Methodist faith wrote a letter requesting a catechist in Badagry. The Methodist already had a missionary party in the Gold Coast, and some members were sent to Badagry. this party was led by Thomas Birch Freeman and Charles DeGraft. The Methodist missionaries first preached under an Agia tree and later erected a make- shift bamboo Church. In 1845, a CMS missionary party arrived Badagry. In the party were Revs, Townsend, Crowther and Gollmer, two teachers from Sierra Leone, some carpenters and wives of the party members. The intention of the part was to keep on moving to Abeokuta but as a result of the death of Sodeke, a chief in Abeokuta, they were delayed at Badagry. The party stayed in Badagry for a year and a half, building a mission house with two levels. However, Christian proselytism in the first half of the nineteenth was not successful in Badagry partly as a result of a civil between 1851- 1854 and also as a result of the Lagos becoming a colony. In the years between the founding of the colony of Lagos and colony of Nigeria, Badagry lost influence to Lagos. In 1863, wary of French influence in Porto-Novo, colonial Lagos signed a treaty of cession with Badagry chiefs. The Congress of Berlin in 1884‚Äì1885, led to the displacement of the Gbe ethnolinguistic groups in the area, with especially the Badagry-Ogu ethnic group falling under the British rule, and marginalized through being removed from the rest of the ethnoliguistic group. = Quarters = The city-state of Badagry was divided into eights wards with each having a traditional head. These are Ijegba (Akran), Asago (Bala), Ganho (Agoloto), Posuko (Possu), Boeko (Mobee), Ahoviko (Wawu), Ahwanjigo (Jengen), and Wharakoh.  Twentieth century  Between 1953 and 1965, Badagry was a divisional headquarters for an area composed of Badagry, Amuwo-Odofin, Ojo and Ajeromi-Ifelodun. When Lagos State was created in 1967, it became one of the five administrative zones of the state.  Culture  A number of festivals are celebrated in Badagry, these are the Ajido Zangbeto cult, Igunnuko festival and Badagry diaspora and heritage festivals. The native language of Badagry is Ogu,a dialect of Aja and similar to the Fon language, an Aja sub-group that is spoken in Porto-Novo. Ancient Bagary had a traditional religion close to vodou and various traditional places of worship. Shrines were located in different quarters of the town including Nabruku at Ijegba, Vlekete at Posuko and Mathe at Adariko. In modern Badagry, adherents of Islam and Christianity populate the town.  Economy  The major economic activities in Badagry include, fishing, trading and tourism. Badagry's closeness to the sea and its historical past with the Trans-Atlantic slave trade and missionaries attracts tourists to the town. A pre-fabricated house built by Thomas Birch Freeman is considered by some as the first storey building in Nigeria while Freeman's Methodist Church is the first settlement of Christian missions in Nigeria.

The FSIS draws its authority from the Federal Meat Inspection Act of 1906, the Poultry Products Inspection Act of 1957 and the Egg Products Inspection Act of 1970. The FSIS also acts as a national health department and is responsible for the safety of public food-related establishments as well as business investigation. Food products under the jurisdiction of the FSIS, and thus subject to inspection, are those that contain more than 3% meat or 2% poultry products, with several exceptions, and egg products (liquid, frozen or dried). Shell eggs, meat and poultry products not under the jurisdiction of the FSIS are under the jurisdiction of the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FSIS is led by the Under Secretary of Agriculture for Food Safety.  Overview  More than 7,800 FSIS inspection program personnel are assigned to about 6,200 Federal slaughter, food processing, and import establishments in the United States. They verify the processing of tens of billions of pounds of meat and poultry, and billions of pounds of egg products. At slaughter establishments, inspectors perform antemortem inspections to prevent slaughter of diseased animals. Then, postmortem examinations are performed to identify diseased carcasses not evident antemortem. Regulations for rapid chilling, adequate trimming and sanitary washing are enforced to reduce microbial contamination. Samples are collected for residue testing to ensure antibiotic, pesticide and other residues are below regulatory limits. For cattle, tissue samples are tested for the presence of bovine spongiform encephalopathy. In processing plants, procedures and formulations are monitored to ensure that FSIS requirements and standards of identity are met. Inspectors in egg plants primarily monitor pasteurization. In all plants, sanitation, net weight and accurate labeling (including nutrition information) regulations are enforced. FSIS also is responsible for products presented for import inspection at ports and borders, from countries that FSIS has determined to have inspection systems equivalent to Federal inspection systems. Everyone in the food chain, from farmer through consumer, has a responsibility in keeping the food supply safe. Meat, poultry, and processed egg products can be contaminated with bacteria at any point during production, distribution, and consumption. FDA works closely with other federal agencies that have some role in the regulation of meat, poultry, and processed egg products along the farm-to-table continuum. FSIS is a large, independent agency that functions separately from the FDA and participates in business oversight.' FSIS is under the direction of the Department of Agriculture while the FDA is under the direction of the Department of Health and Human Services. The two agencies share responsibilities on various topics concerning food safety, but have different methods of enforcement and supervision of food producers. For example, both FSIS and the FDA have the authority to regulate food labeling. In March 2014, FSIS implemented a new regulatory requirement for labeling; 9 CFR Part 412. At times, FSIS requires a food producer to obtain pre-market approval of their intended label before the product is entered into the stream of commerce21 U.S.C. 607(d) and 21 U.S.C. 457(c) (for products under their jurisdiction. If product is covered by a standard of identity and meets the established standard, then pre-market approval is not necessary. The FDA does not require that a food producer, in their jurisdiction, obtain pre-market approval of their label.P.L. 75-717 FSIS takes a preemptive role in food labeling where the FDA takes a reactive role in food labeling. The FSIS also has authority in inspection and monitoring of food-related establishments, while the FDA has no jurisdiction regarding restaurants and food businesses. FSIS derives its authority from the Federal Meat Inspection Act of 1906,59th Congress Session I 34 Stat. 669 the Poultry Products Inspection Act of 1957,P.L. 85-172 and the Egg Products Inspection Act of 1970.P.L. 91-597 Proposed Amendment: H.R. 3798 FSIS inspects meat and poultry products to ensure that there is no misbrandedThe Federal Meat Inspection Act defines \\"Misbranded\\" #if the product's labeling is false or misleading in any particular way; #if it is offered for sale under the name of another food; #If it is an imitation of another food, unless it is labeled as such; #if its container is misleading; #unless it bears a label with the name of the manufacturer, distributor, and net quantity of contents; #if its labeling is not prominent and conspicuous; #if it purports to be a food with a standard of identity without conforming to the standard; #if it misrepresents itself as a food with standard of fill; #if it does not bear a common or usual name (provided it is not covered by a standard of identity) and declare ingredients by common or usual name; #if it purports to be a food for special dietary use without conforming to FDA regulations on such products; #if it contains artificial flavoring, artificial coloring, or chemical preservatives that are not declared (with exceptions); and #if it fails to bear an inspection legend and establishment number. or adulteratedThe Federal Meat Inspection Act of 1906 defines \\"Adultered\\" #if any substance has been mixed and packed with it so as to reduce or lower or injuriously affect its quality or strength; #if any substance has been substituted wholly or in part for the article; #if any valuable constituent of the article has been wholly or in part abstracted; #if it be mixed, colored, powdered, coated or stained in a manner whereby damage or inferiority is concealed; #if it contain any added poisonous or other added deleterious ingredient which may render such article injurious to health; #if it consists in whole or in part of a filthy, decomposed, or putrid animal or vegetable substance, or any portion of an animal unfit for food, whether manufactured or not, or if it is the product of a diseased animal, or one that has died otherwise than by slaughter. products being put into the stream of commerce.  Recalls  Recalls are voluntary actions by manufacturers, distributors or importers to protect the public by removing from commerce products that are adulterated or misbranded. The majority of recalls in recent years have been due to undeclared allergens on product labels. As soon as FSIS learns that a meat or poultry product under its jurisdiction may be unsafe or mislabeled is in commerce, the agency forms a team to determine whether a recall is needed. The Recall Committee is composed of FSIS representatives from various areas of expertise. The committee evaluates all the information available and makes a recommendation to the establishment whose product is in question, including the parameters of the recall. After a recall is issued, FSIS conducts effectiveness checks to ensure that the company‚Äôs customers (or consignees) have received notice of the recall and are making every effort to retrieve and destroy the recalled product or return it to the recalling firm. FSIS personnel verify that the recalling firm has been diligent and successful in notifying and advising their consignees of the need to retrieve and control recalled product, and that the consignees have responded accordingly. FSIS has formal agreements with many state governments that allow those states to participate in effectiveness checks, thus improving the speed and effectiveness of recalls. When a product is recalled, FSIS issues a recall release to the media in the affected area, sends it to public health partners and stakeholders and posts it on the FSIS Web site. In certain situations where a recall is not warranted, but there is still a risk to public health, FSIS may issue a public health alert. PHAs have been issued when a product was not considered adulterated, but illnesses were involved; when illnesses were associated with a meat or poultry product, but a source of contamination was not identified; or a product is no longer available in commerce, but may be held or in use by consumers. The FSIS also acts as an investigation organization involved in food-related businesses if suspicions regarding consumer safety or criminal abuse arise. During an investigation, the FSIS will dispatch an investigator that will attempt to detect any criminal or violations regarding the USDA regulations. If evidence of consumer abuse or infractions regarding the USDA health regulations, the FSIS will close the business until the establishment has restored itself to the acceptable level for any USDA approved business. If major criminal activity or heavy violation of the USDA regulations is found, the FSIS has the authority to shut down the business to protect consumer safety and public health. In extreme cases, where egregious acts of disregard for the regulatory requirements has been extensively identified and documented, establishment owners and operators have been tried, convicted and jailed for their actions or lack thereof.  History The FSIS's parent organization, the U.S. Department of Agriculture was founded in 1862 by President Abraham Lincoln. Harvey W. Wiley, M.D, who was appointed to the position of chief chemist at the USDA in 1883 devoted his career to the struggle against foodborne illnesses, by among other things campaigning for the Pure Food and Drug Act. It would however take until 1905, the technologically enabled rapid growth of the meat industry and the publication of The Jungle, which detailed the meat industry and its working conditions, for the act to pass. The Pure Food and Drug Act‚Äôs main purpose lay in the banning of foreign and interstate traffic of adulterated and mislabelled food and its direction of the U.S. Bureau of Chemistry to inspect food products and refer offenders to the prosecution. It also constituted a major step towards the creation of the Food and Drug Administration. The Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA), which prohibited the sale of adulterated or misbranded meat and meat products and laid out that the slaughter of animals with the purpose of meat produce had to take place under certain sanitary conditions, was passed on the same day. The USDA's Bureau of Chemistry and its Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI) were assigned the tasks of enforcing the Pure Food and Drug Act and the FMIA, respectively. Which meant that the BAI performed meat inspection services. The USDA‚Äôs Bureau of Chemistry, would later be reorganized and renamed Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which now belongs to the Department of Health and Human Services. In the post-World War 2 period, the invention and commercialization of the refrigerator led to a modernization of the meat industry. The Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 expanded the scope of USDA-inspections by allowing for the inspections of exotic and game animals as well as the inspection and certification of agricultural products. As the consumer demands for poultry products grew in the post-World War 2 period, the Poultry Products Inspection Act was passed, ensuring, just like the FMIA did for meat products, that poultry products shipped in interstate commerce would be continuously inspected. Subsequent to continuous amendments to the existing regulations in the 1950s and 1960s, which tried to deal with concerns about the rising complexity in meat production, chemical contaminations and animal welfare, federal meat and poultry inspections were merged into one program. With the passing of the Egg Products Inspections Act of 1970, the inspections of eggs and egg products was added to the USDA‚Äôs responsibilities. Today the FSIS is responsible for the inspection of pasteurized liquid, frozen, or dried egg products, while the FDA undertakes to ensure shell egg safety. Following the reorganization of the USDA‚Äôs agricultural research service, the Food Safety and Quality Service was created in 1977 to assume responsibility of meat and poultry grading as well as inspections. Only four years later it was reorganized and renamed to the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) under which the agency is still known today. The FSIS would undergo a major chance in philosophy, following a major outbreak of E. coli in 1993: It changed from relying largely on organoleptic (sight, touch & smell) controls to a more scientific approach with a focus on the prevention and reduction of microbial pathogens on raw products that can cause illness. Underlining this decision, the FHIS issued the Hazard analysis and critical control points (HACCP) rule, which details a systematic approach to food safety from biological, chemical and physical hazards. It also illustrates the role of public and private sector with regards to food safety: While the industry is accountable for producing safe food, the government is responsible for setting appropriate food safety standards, maintaining vigorous inspection oversight, and maintaining a strong regulatory enforcement program to deal with noncompliance. In more recent times, the FSIS built on the foundation of HACCP by intensifying efforts to combat food-borne pathogens, by for example testing for Listeria monocytogenes tightening the restriction combating Salmonella. During the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, 145 field employees tested positive for COVID-19, and three died. One of the three FSIS inspectors based in New York City visited plants while potentially infected, and later died. This was despite the FDA postponing most foreign facility inspections and all domestic routine surveillance facility inspections on March 18.

The current king, Carl XVI Gustaf, is Prince Gustaf Adolf's son. The prince was killed on 26 January 1947 in an airplane crash at Kastrup Airport, Copenhagen, Denmark. Early life Gustaf Adolf wears the Swedish royal christening gown at his christening in 1906. He is held by his great-grandfather with his grandfather and father standing behind. Gustaf Adolf was born in Stockholm on 22 April 1906 as the eldest son of the then Prince Gustaf Adolf and his first wife Princess Margaret. He was known by his last given name, Edmund, in the family.

He served as president of the Swedish Olympic Committee from 1933 until his death in 1947. Gustaf Adolf joined the Boy Scouts, and as an adult became a Scoutmaster. He earned his Wood Badge beads at Gilwell Park in England. When the Svenska Scoutr√•det formed he served as its first president or Chief Scout.John S. Wilson (1959), Scouting Round the World. First edition, Blandford Press. p. 94, 95, 99, 102, 106, 110, 115, 124, 127, 136, 140, 141, 185 He led the Swedish contingents at the 5th World Scout Jamboree in 1937 and at the World Scout Moot in 1939. He served on the World Scout Committee from May 1937 until his death. From 1932, Prince Gustaf Adolf was chairman of the Swedish Scout Council and from 1937 honorary chairman of the International Scout Committee. Since 1933, the prince was also chairman of the Central Board of the Swedish Sports Confederation, the Swedish Central Association for Sports Promotion (Centralf√∂reningen f√∂r idrottens fr√§mjande) and the Swedish Olympic Committee. Prince Gustaf Adolf was chairman of the Royal Swedish Aero Club from 1937 and the Royal Automobile Club from 1939. He was first honorary member of the Swedish Central Federation for Voluntary Military Training (Centralf√∂rbundet f√∂r Bef√§lsutbildning), of the Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala, of the Royal Swedish Academy of War Sciences, of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music, of the Royal Swedish Society of Naval Sciences and honorary member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. He was also honorary chairman of the Central Organization of the Swedish Women‚Äôs Auxiliary Veterinary Corps (Centralstyrelsen f√∂r Svenska bl√• stj√§rnan). Politics and World War II Prince Gustaf Adolf, Hermann G√∂ring and the prince's grandfather King Gustaf V of Sweden in Berlin 1939 Some recent journalists and historians portray Gustaf Adolf as sympathetic towards the Nazi movement in Germany in the 1930s, a highly debated and criticised opinion. As an official representative of Sweden, Gustaf Adolf met with many Nazi leaders, including Adolf Hitler and Hermann G√∂ring (the latter had lived in Sweden and had many friends among the Swedish upper class). His father-in-law, Charles Edward, the deposed Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, was one of the few members of any of the former German princely houses who was a Nazi supporter,Die Zeit, 2001 but this does not mean Gustaf Adolf was. As the prince very rarely spoke of political matters and left no written evidence of any political sympathies of any kind, the subject remains very much a matter of speculation. According to journalist and author Staffan Skott in his book Alla dessa Bernadottar (All these Bernadottes), letters and diary entries by influential Swedes of decidedly anti-Nazi persuasion disprove the rumors. Such documents include those of the diplomat Sven Grafstr√∂m and of the wife of the cabinet minister Gustav M√∂ller, as well as of the stepson of Hermann G√∂ring, who said that a visit by the prince to G√∂ring's home was a complete failure and that G√∂ring and Gustaf Adolf did not get along well. The newspaper Expressen said that \\"plausible witnesses who were also strongly pro-democracy\\" had denied the rumors. The Swedish Royal Court made a statement denying any knowledge of Nazi sympathies. Gustaf Adolf expressed his support for Finland during the Continuation War of 1941‚Äì1944, and would even have liked to participate as a voluntary soldier in the Winter War of 1939‚Äì1940, but the King's disapproval prevented this from happening. Some leading Swedish politicians were adverse to the possibility of seeing Gustaf Adolf inherit the throne, and one prominent Social Democrat publicly uttered that the prince was \\"a person who must never be King\\".Per Svensson in Han som aldrig fick bli kung Norstedts 2006 p. 281 Marriage and family Gustaf Adolf as painted by Bianca Wallin in 1939 On 19/20 October 1932 in Coburg, he married his second cousin, Princess Sibylla of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, daughter of Charles Edward, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. The religious ceremony took place the second day at St. Moritz Church. They had five children: *Princess Margaretha, Mrs. Ambler (born 31 October 1934) she married John Ambler on 30 June 1964 and is his widow. They had three children. *Princess Birgitta of Sweden (born 19 January 1937) she married Prince Johann Georg of Hohenzollern on 25 May 1961 and is his widow. They had three children. *Princess D√©sir√©e, Baroness Silfverschi√∂ld (born 2 June 1938) she married Baron Niclas Silfverschi√∂ld on 5 June 1964 and is his widow. They had three children. *Princess Christina, Mrs. Magnuson (born 3 August 1943) she married Tord Magnuson on 15 June 1974. They have three sons. *Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden (born 30 April 1946) he married Silvia Sommerlath on 19 June 1976. They have three children. Death Gustaf Adolf's and Sibylla's grave on Karlsborg Island in Solna, Sweden. Prince Gustaf Adolf was killed in an airplane crash in the afternoon of 26 January 1947 at Kastrup Airport, Copenhagen, Denmark. The prince, along with two companions, was returning to Stockholm from a hunting trip and visit to Princess Juliana and Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands. The delayed KLM flight from Amsterdam had landed at Copenhagen for a routine stop before continuing to Stockholm. Soon after the Douglas DC-3 aircraft took off, it climbed to an altitude of about 50 meters (150 ft), stalled, and plummeted nose-first to the ground, where it exploded on impact. All 22 people aboard the plane (16 passengers and six crew members) were killed. Also aboard the ill-fated flight was American singer and actress Grace Moore. An investigation found that, short of time, the plane's captain had failed to perform the final pre-flight check list properly and took off not realizing that a gust lock on an elevator was still in place. At the time of his death, Prince Gustaf Adolf had been second in line to the Swedish throne behind his father, the Crown Prince, who in 1950 became King Gustaf VI Adolf. The younger Gustaf Adolf was succeeded as second in line by his only son, Carl Gustaf (at the time only 9 months old), who would later succeed his grandfather in 1973 as King Carl XVI Gustaf.

Its population is c. 13,200.  History  The village lies under Rocca Guglielma, a medieval fortification perched on an inaccessible spur. Its name derives from the pons curvus, \\"curved bridge\\", that may still be seen spanning the Liri in the center of the town that grew around the bridgehead in the course of the Middle Ages. The curve of the bridge was intended to divert timbers that might strike its piers during floods. The folk etymology of corvo, \\"crow\\", symbol of the \\"black monks\\", the Benedictines of the abbey of Monte Cassino, within whose secular territory, the Terra Sancti Benedicti, Pontecorvo lay, is displayed in the town's modern coat-of-arms, which represents a crow surmounting a curved bridge. In Roman times the agricultural region was governed from Aquinum, the modern Aquino. Some Roman remains have been retrieved from a villa site at Sant'Oliva. The medieval commune dates from 860, when Rodoaldo, the Lombard gastaldo of Aquino, erected the first version of the walled fortification on the rocca, intended to guard the bridgehead from Saracen intruders coming up the Liri. The castle's chapel seems to have been dedicated to Saint Bartholomew; on the ruins of the Lombard castello was erected the earliest Cathedral of San Bartolomeo of which the campanile was a rebuilding of the castellan's tower. Two medieval quarters developed, Civit√† within the walls and Pastine in the meadows between the city walls and the river. The little bridgehead settlement formed part of the County of Capua; there in 866 Louis II, Holy Roman Emperor, set up camp at Pontecorvo in campaigns against the Saracens. In 960 Atenulf succeeded in attaching Pontecorvo to his gastaldate of Aquino; at his death his lands were divided into a county of Aquino and a county of Pontecorvo. In 1065 the Normans conquered the region and attached Pontecorvo to the Norman county of Gaeta, but the abbot of Monte Cassino purchased it in 1105, and maintained a precarious hold on it for over four centuries. The first communal statute, among the earliest in the Kingdom of Naples, was granted in 1190, signalling a new era of civic self-confidence in a period in which Pontecorvo was briefly conquered and ruled by Roger II of Sicily, was claimed by the papacy, and was sacked by Charles of Anjou. During the Western Schism, Pontecorvo allied with antipope Clement VII in opposition to the local power of Monte Cassino. Flag of the Republic of Pontecorvo, 1820 Although just within the territory of the Kingdom of Naples, the town was an exclave of the Papal States from 1463, when the comune placed itself under papal jurisdiction, until it was captured by the French army in the Napoleonic Wars. After having been proclaimed King of Italy in 1805, Napoleon created the Principality of Pontecorvo, a principality for his General Jean Baptiste Bernadotte, who would become King Charles XIV & III John of Sweden and Norway. The principality was nominally sovereign, but the Prince did have to take an oath to the King. It was short-lived, however, and in 1815 the town was ceded back to the Papal States. In 1820 the 'Republic' of Pontecorvo seceded from the Papal States, but Papal rule was restored in March 1821. In 1860 it joined Benevento, the other southern Italian papal enclave, in being united with the new Kingdom of Italy.

He is known for the Herbrand‚ÄìRibet theorem and Ribet's theorem, which were key ingredients in the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, as well as for his service as President of the American Mathematical Society from 2017 to 2019. He is currently a professor of mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley. Early life and education  Kenneth Ribet was born in Brooklyn, New York to parents David Ribet and Pearl Ribet on June 28, 1948. As a student at Far Rockaway High School, Ribet was on a competitive mathematics team, but his first field of study was chemistry.Chapey, Dr. Geraldine. \\"Chatting with Chapey: Weber and Ribet Honored\\", The Wave, October 21, 2005. Accessed September 28, 2018. \\"Speaking of successful professionals, Kenneth Ribet is a world renowned scholar.... He is a proud graduate of P.S. 114, J.H.S. 210 and Far Rockaway High School.\\" Ribet earned his bachelor's degree and master's degree from Brown University in 1969. In 1973, Ribet received Ph.D. from Harvard University under the supervision of John Tate. Career After receiving his doctoral degree, Ribet taught at Princeton University for three years before spending two years doing research in Paris. In 1978, Ribet joined the Department of Mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley, where he served three separate terms as supervisor of the department's graduate program, supervisor of the department's undergraduate program, and supervisor of the department's development. Ribet has served as an editor for several mathematics journals, a book series editor for the Cambridge University Press, and a book series editor for Springer. He also served on the United States National Committee for Mathematics, representing the United States at the International Mathematical Union, and was the Chair of the Mathematics section of the National Academy of Sciences. From February 1, 2017 to January 31, 2019, Ribet was President of the American Mathematical Society. Research Ribet's contributions in number theory and algebraic geometry were described by Benedict Gross and Barry Mazur as being \\"key to our understanding of the connections between the theory of modular forms and the ‚Ñì-adic representations of the absolute Galois group of the field of rational numbers.\\" Ribet is credited with paving the way towards Andrew Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. In 1986, Ribet proved that the epsilon conjecture formulated by Jean- Pierre Serre was true, and thereby proved that Fermat's Last Theorem would follow from the Taniyama‚ÄìShimura conjecture. Crucially it also followed that the full conjecture was not needed, but a special case, that of semistable elliptic curves, sufficed. An earlier theorem of Ribet's, the Herbrand‚ÄìRibet theorem, is the converse to Herbrand's theorem on the divisibility properties of Bernoulli numbers and is also related to Fermat's Last Theorem. Awards and honors Ribet received the Fermat Prize in 1989 jointly with Abbas Bahri. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1997 and the National Academy of Sciences in 2000. In 2012, he became a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society.List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society, retrieved 2013-07-07. In 2017, Ribet received the Brouwer Medal. In 1988, Ribet was inducted as a vigneron d'honneur by the Jurade de Saint- √âmilion. In 1998, Ribet received an honorary doctorate from Brown University.

They are particularly associated with May Day celebrations, mummers' plays and the Morris dance in England. Types of hobby horse Hobby horses may be constructed in several different ways. The types most frequently found in the United Kingdom have been categorised as follows:Cawte, EC, Ritual Animal Disguise, pp8‚Äì9, London, DS Brewer for the Folklore Society (1978) * Tourney horses are meant to look like a person riding a small horse that is wearing a long cloth coat or caparison (as seen in medieval illustrations of jousting knights at a tourney or tournament). A circular or oval frame is suspended around their waist, or chest, with a skirt draped over it hanging down to the ground. The frame has a carved wooden head, often with snapping jaws (operated by pulling a string) attached to it at one end, and a tail at the other. The \\"rider\\" may wear a cape or other flowing costume to help cover the frame. In the most elaborate versions, fake legs, meant to be those of the rider, hang down the sides of the skirt, though this seems to be a fairly recent development.Cawte, EC, Ritual Animal Disguise, p187, London, DS Brewer for the Folklore Society (1978) * Sieve horses are a simpler version of the tourney horse. Known only in Lincolnshire, they are made from a farm sieve frame, with head and tail attached, suspended from the performer's shoulders. The performer wears a horse blanket (the kind that includes a headpiece with holes for the eyes and ears) that covers them and the sieve. * Mast horses are meant to represent the horse (or other animal) itself. They have a head made of wood, or sometimes an actual horse's skull is used; it usually has hinged jaws that can be made to snap. The head is attached to a stick about 1 m (3 ft) long. The person acting the creature is covered by a cloth attached to the back of its head; he (or, rarely, she) bends over forwards or crouches, holding the head in front of their own and resting the other end of the stick on the ground. A tail may be attached to the back of the cloth. When the cloth is long enough, such as the sheet used by the Welsh Mari Lwyd, the performer can also stand up, lifting the head in front of their face or above their head. Not all hobby horses fit into these categories, even within the UK. The famous May Day horses at Padstow and Minehead are large constructions, suspended at shoulder level, with only the performer's head emerging; they wear tall, pointed hats and their faces are masked. The Padstow horses have circular frames, with fairly small, snapping-jawed heads on long, straight necks;Cawte, EC, Ritual Animal Disguise, p157‚Äì158, London, DS Brewer for the Folklore Society (1978) the Minehead horses are more boat-shaped, with pointed ends and, since about 1880, have had no heads, though they have long, trailing tails, about 2.2 m (7 ft) long.Cawte, EC, Ritual Animal Disguise, p169, London, DS Brewer for the Folklore Society (1978) In the South of France, in Belgium (the Ommegang de Termonde) and elsewhere, large hobby horses are carried by multiple performers; their hollow frameworks are constructed in various ways. The Danse du Baiar at Esqui√®ze the dancers wear √† wooden horse head in their breasts when dancing. In Indonesia, flat silhouettes of horses are suspended between the dancers' legs (see individual entries, below). Customs =Britain= May Day hobby horses =Padstow= The Old 'Oss capturing a young woman during the May Day festival at Padstow, Cornwall The most famous traditional British hobby horses are probably those of the May Day 'Obby 'Oss festival in Padstow, Cornwall. They are made from a circular framework, tightly covered with shiny black material, carried on the shoulders of a dancer whose face is hidden by a grotesque mask attached to a tall, pointed hat. A skirt (made from the same material) hangs down from the edge of the frame to around knee-height. There is a small, wooden, horse's head with snapping jaws, attached to a long, straight neck, with a long mane, which sticks out from the front of the frame. On the opposite side there is a small tail of horsehair. There are two rival horses and their fiercely loyal bands of supporters at Padstow: the Old 'Oss is decorated with white and red, and its supporters wear red scarves to show their allegiance; the Blue Ribbon 'Oss (or \\"Peace 'Oss\\") is decorated with white and blue and its supporters follow suit . A \\"Teaser\\" waving a padded club dances in front of each 'Oss, accompanied, as they dance through the narrow streets, by a lively band of melodeons, accordions and drums playing Padstow's traditional May Song. The 'Osses sometimes capture young women beneath the skirt of the hobby horse; often they emerge smeared with black.Hole, Christina (1978). A Dictionary of British Folk Customs, pp199‚Äì201, Paladin Granada, Children sometimes make \\"Colt\\" 'Osses and hold their own May Day parades. =Minehead= Minehead Hobby Horse At Minehead in Somerset there are three rival hobby horses, the Original Sailor's Horse, the Traditional Sailor's Horse and the Town Horse. They appear on May Eve (called \\"Show Night\\"), on May Day morning (when they salute the sunrise at a crossroads on the outskirts of town), 2 May and 3 May (when a ceremony called \\"The Bootie\\" takes place in the evening at part of town called Cher) . Each horse is made of a boat-shaped wooden frame, pointed and built up at each end, which is carried on the dancer's shoulders. As at Padstow, his face is hidden by a mask attached to a tall, pointed hat. The top surface of the horse is covered with ribbons and strips of fabric. A long fabric skirt, painted with rows of multicoloured roundels, hangs down to the ground all round. A long tail is attached to the back of the frame. Each horse is accompanied by a small group of musicians and attendants. The Town Horse is accompanied by \\"Gullivers\\", dressed similarly to the horse but without the large frame; as at Padstow, smaller, children's horses have sometimes been constructed . The horses' visits are (or were) believed to bring good luck. In the past there was also a similar hobby horse based at the nearby village of Dunster, which would sometimes visit Minehead . The Minehead horse has also visited Dunster Castle on May Day. Hunting the Earl of Rone At Combe Martin in Devon a custom called \\"The Hunting of the Earl of Rone\\" took place on Ascension Day until 1837, when it was banned. It was revived in 1974 and now takes place over the four days of Spring Bank Holiday. A fool and a hobby horse, accompanied by grenadiers, search the village for the Earl, who is finally captured, mounted onto a (real) donkey and paraded through the village. He is frequently shot at by the soldiers, falls from his mount, and is revived by the hobby horse and the fool, and returned to his mount. Finally, on reaching the beach, the Earl is executed and thrown into the sea. Hole, Christina (1978).

C.248-1976) . A painting from c.1620, now in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, shows Morris dancers by the Thames at Richmond; their party includes a hobby horse. Some historical English Morris dance \\"sides\\" (teams) had hobby horses associated with them, but the popularity of such animals with morris sides today probably dates from the early years of the morris revival, when Ilmington Morris created a tourney horse, ridden by Sam Bennett for many years. Some modern revival sides have extended their animal repertoire in various imaginative and appropriate ways, e.g. Pig Dyke Molly molly dancers, who wear black and white costumes and makeup, have a hobby zebra. A hobby horse takes part in the ancient Abbots Bromley Horn Dance. The old original horse (see gallery, above) has been replaced by a more realistic carving in recent years. Other customs including hobby horses =Hodening or Hoodening= A custom which took place at, or in the lead-up to, Christmas in eastern Kent, involving a group of ploughmen or other farmworkers leading a Hooden Horse (a horse's head made of wood, set on a short pole, with snapping jaws (sometimes set with nails for teeth) operated by a person hidden under a piece of sacking or a stable-blanket to represent the animal's body). The custom, described as \\"only just extinct\\" by folklorist Violet Alford in 1952, has since been revived in various places.Hole, Christina (1978). A Dictionary of British Folk Customs, pp148‚Äì150, Paladin Granada, Alford, Violet (1952). Introduction to English Folklore, p57, Bell (no ISBN) =Laare Vane= A New Year custom from the Isle of Man, involving a white-painted wooden horse's head with red- painted snapping jaws, with a white sheet attached. Draped in the sheet, a man would carry the head, racing unexpectedly into the room and chase any girls present out of the house, followed by the rest of the company. When the Laare Vane (white mare) caught a girl she would take his place under the sheet to carry the horse back into the house, sitting away from the others while a kind of sword-dance was performed with sticks by six male dancers to the tune \\"Mylecharane's March\\" played on the fiddle. As the climax of the dance the fiddler would enter the circle of dancers and be imprisoned by their intertwined sticks; the dancers then, with wild cries, \\"cut off his head\\" and he fell to the ground. The \\"dead\\" fiddler was then blindfolded and led to the Laare Vane, and knelt with his head in her lap. Another person would question the fiddler about events in the coming year (particularly who would become Valentines) and his replies were believed to be true predictions.Douglas, Mona (ed.

Gaining access to the house was a challenge; the Mari Lwyd party and those in the house took turns to improvise verses of a song. If the household failed to come up with a final verse the Mari was allowed to enter; if not, it was turned away. The custom has been revived in recent years.Hole, Christina (1978). A Dictionary of British Folk Customs, pp185‚Äì187, Paladin Granada, =Old Horse, 'Owd 'Oss or Poor Old Hoss= In parts of Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire and around Sheffield there existed, into the early 20th century (and until 1970 at Dore) a Christmas and New Year custom of going from house to house performing a short play or dramatised song called The Old Horse, T'Owd 'Oss or Poor Old Horse. The horse was of the \\"mast\\" type, constructed in a similar way to the Wild Horse of the Soul-cakers and the hooden horses of Kent. The earliest record is from 1840, at Ashford- in-the-Water, Derbyshire.Cawte, EC, Ritual Animal Disguise, p123, London, DS Brewer for the Folklore Society (1978) This type of performance still continues at Richmond, Yorkshire, at Christmas. Three men dressed in hunting pink lead a horse \\"made from the stuffed skin of a horse's head on a pole\\" and the man who plays it hidden under a horse-blanket. The men sing the Poor Old Horse song and the horse snapped its jaws at the end of each verse. The custom as now performed in Richmond Market Place around midday on Christmas Eve involves the horse's \\"death and resurrection\\" (he crouches down and then rises up when a hunting horn is blown).Calendar Customs website: Poor Old Hoss =Penglas or Penglaz= The name of this creature from Cornwall translates as \\"grey head\\". It was a \\"hooden\\" or \\"mast\\" type of horse, either carved from wood or made from a horse's skull, like the Welsh Mari Lwyd, and accompanied the Christmas Guisers. Its body was a horse's hide or horse cloth. Sometimes it was led or ridden by Old Penglaze, a man with a blackened face who carried a staff. The animal has been revived in Penzance in recent years as Penglaz the Penzance 'Obby 'Oss and now appears on \\"Mazey Eve\\" and 23 June (St John's Eve) as part of a modern Midsummer festival, instead of around midwinter. =Plough Monday mummers= In Lincolnshire and Nottinghamshire and some other parts of the East Midlands of England, mummers' plays were performed, on or around Plough Monday in early January, by teams known variously as Plough Stots, Plough Jags, Plough Jacks, Plough Bullocks or Plough Witches. In North Lincolnshire, large teams of elaborately costumed mummers, often having some of the characters duplicated, paraded through the village streets, sometimes splitting up into smaller groups to enter houses and perform extracts from their traditional play. Photographs of teams from Scunthorpe, Burringham, Scotter, Burton-upon-Stather and elsewhere showed double gangs with two hobby horses. They were of the sieve type, made by hanging the wooden frame of a large sieve, with a small wooden horse's head and horsehair tail attached, around the performer's waist, However, in an unusual variation, the \\"rider\\" was then disguised by wearing a horse-cloth which covered his head and body to the knees, so that he appeared to be a horse riding a horse. =Salisbury Giant and Hob-Nob= The Salisbury Giant, a 12 ft-tall (3.5m) figure sometimes said to represent Saint Christopher, is a processional figure unique in Britain. The current figure's wooden frame was rebuilt c.1850 although it is probable that he existed in the 15th century. It rarely appears nowadays, being kept in the Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum, along with its companion Hob-Nob, a tourney-type hobby horse, a mischievous character which used to clear the way for the Giant in the processions that were held by the Tailor's Guild on Midsummer's Eve.Salisbury & South Wiltshire Museum websiteCawte, EC, Ritual Animal Disguise, p30, London, DS Brewer for the Folklore Society (1978) Hob-Nob's rider's face and body were disguised with a substantial veil. The first clear mention of the hobby horse is in 1572 (along with a \\"mayde Marrians Coate\\") in the records of the Tailors' Guild (who, in 1873, finally sold both hobby-horse and Giant to the Museum). The processions, which also involved morris dancers until around 1911, continued sporadically on various occasions into the mid 20th century.Cawte, EC, Ritual Animal Disguise, pp29‚Äì35, London, DS Brewer for the Folklore Society (1978) =Soul-caking or Souling= Some regional variants of the mummers play, performed around All Souls' Day in Cheshire, included a non-speaking character called the \\"Wild Horse\\", made from a horse's skull mounted on a short pole. The horse was played by a man, hidden under a cloth attached to the pole, who bent forward to rest the pole on the ground. He could usually snap the horse's jaws loudly to frighten onlookers.Hole, Christina (1978). A Dictionary of British Folk Customs, pp284‚Äì285, Paladin Granada, =Winster Hobby Horses= The three Winster hobby horses and other performers, c. 1870 A possibly unique custom involving three hobby horses is known only from a photograph taken at Winster Hall, Derbyshire, in about 1870.Cawte, EC, Ritual Animal Disguise, p122, London, DS Brewer for the Folklore Society (1978) (The picture appears to have been taken in winter, as the climbing plants on the wall are leafless.) Eight or nine performers are involved; all (bar one?) have facial disguise. The performers are grouped around a mast horse (possibly 'Snap Dragon'; see below) with a shiny black head made from a painted skull set on a short pole. Behind it are two men in threatening postures, one is waving a long stick like the handle of a brush or rake, the other probably a besom broom (blurred). Two more men wearing military-looking jackets, buttoned to the neck, and white trousers stand astride small hobbyhorses of an apparently unique design: a cylindrical body, \\"about three inches diameter and two feet long\\", held between the rider's legs (supported at the front by a cord or narrow strap around the rider's neck), with a flat, curved wooden neck and a small, stylised head with snapping jaws (apart from their mouths, the horses look almost like simple rocking horses with the legs removed). The horsemen are masked in light-coloured cloth. Another character wears a rather voluminous, tattered, long, dark dress; busily brushing the ground with a besom broom, \\"she\\" is reminiscent of the character Besom Bet who appears in some mummers plays. The last two characters are playing rough music on bladder fiddles. The performance may have been arranged by Llewellynn Jewitt, who lived at the hall between 1868 and 1880. In 1931, Stanley Evans (\\"Folk Dancing in Derbyshire\\", Derbyshire Countryside, vol 1, no 2, April 1931, p29) suggested the performers may have been performing a mumming play. Cawte dismissed this suggestion: \\"if so it is a most unusual one, there is no sign of the combatants, the pair of horses is of an unusual design, and the mast horse seems to be the centre of attention.\\"Cawte, EC, Ritual Animal Disguise, p121, London, DS Brewer for the Folklore Society (1978) In his field notes, made in 1908, folklorist Cecil Sharp referred to a hobby horse \\"without a curtain\\" being connected with the morris dance at Winster; he also mentions a \\"Snap Dragon\\" made from \\"a real horse's head\\" (skull?) dug up for the purpose, but does not say whether it was associated with the morris. It seems he did not see them himself and his account published in 1924, long after his visit to Winster, is confusing. In 1966, Winster morris dancers stated that there had never been a hobby horse associated with their morris, but that there had been a separate horse ceremony involving a skull that was reburied each year.Cawte, EC, Ritual Animal Disguise, pp120‚Äì123, London, DS Brewer for the Folklore Society (1978) In notes published after his death, Llewellynn Jewitt noted how, in 1867, a dozen or so groups of traditional performers (several groups of guisers, the Wensley mummers, 'The Hobby Horse' and the 'Snap Dragon') called at Winster Hall in just four days between Christmas and New Year. He noted that, on 27 December, \\"In the evening the Winster 'Snap Dragon' and 'Hobby Horse' conjoined came to us ‚Äî ten men, one as Snap Dragon, two with Hobby Horses, two devils, etc., etc. We had them in the kitchen and gave them money.\\"Hall, Samuel Carter, The Life and Death of Llewellynn Jewitt: With Fragmentary Memoirs of Some of his Famous Literary and Artistic Friends (1889) Online text, p.226 The photograph may well show one such \\"conjoined\\" team. Related customs =Derby Tup= Originally created in the same way as a mast horse or hooden horse, the Derby Tup (ram) represented a male sheep. It took part in a dramatised version of the Derby Ram folksong, which was performed in northern Derbyshire and around Sheffield during the Christmas season by teams of boys. It is \\"killed\\" by a butcher and its \\"blood\\" is collected in a large bowl. In some versions it is brought back to life by a quack doctor, like a character in the Mummers play. =Europe= Austria =Sankt Lorenzen im Lesachtal, Carinthia= The Fasnacht (carnival) procession in Sankt Lorenzen im Lesachtal, south-west Austria, features a large band of musicians, some in fancy dress, and is led by a large, rather frisky hobby horse. It has a hollow body, covered by a long white sheet that almost reaches the ground, with a long neck and head apparently made of cardboard or papier-m√¢ch√©; it is carried by two people who are hidden beneath the sheet. The horse has a few coloured ribbons attached to its mane, bridle and tail. Its reins are held by a man dressed in a red jacket, and it is closely followed by a boy (who occasionally prods it with a wooden hay-fork) and a blacksmith in an apron (who carries a bag containing a hammer). Other stock characters in the parade include four masked, smartly dressed \\"old men\\" with walking sticks. From time to time the horse falls to the ground and is then \\"shod\\" (the smith hammers the shoe soles of one or other of the carriers, who kick out, wildly). The man who leads it sometimes breathes into its mouth or nostrils. It then revives and continues through the village.Sankt Lorenzen im Lesachtal, Carinthia (A): Film by Michele Trentini, made 16 February 2010 Carnival King of Europe (website of Museo degli Usi e Costumi della Gente Trentina, San Michele all'Adige - Italy) (accessed 20 Nov 2012) At Ezpeize the formal dancing is suddenly interrupted by a wild invasion. An unruly gang of rustically dressed characters, wearing masks or facial disguise, rushes into the dancing area in pairs, with loud cries. Some wave clubs. Some have furry tails. There is a doctor and a nurse, in white coats with a red cross on the back. They all race around the dancing space in an anti-clockwise direction and then fall to the ground in a writhing heap.Carnaval de Espes: Film by Michele Trentini, 25 January 2009 Carnival King of Europe (website of Museo degli Usi e Costumi della Gente Trentina, San Michele all'Adige - Italy) (accessed 20 November 2012) =Carnaval de Lantz, Spain= A more rustic-looking horse of similar basic construction is part of the celebrations of the Carnaval de Lantz, Spain. Called the zaldiko, it forms an essential part of the carnival procession, together with the ziripot, a strange character in an enormous straw-stuffed costume. =Parade of Giants and Big-heads, Pamplona, Spain= Pamplona's giants and big-heads, with the 6 zaldiko (far left) Dressed in red trimmed with yellow, six tourney horses (xaldiko or zaldiko) take part in the Comparsa de gigantes y cabezudos in Pamplona (Iru√±a) in Navarre (Nafarra). More realistic than the other Basque examples, they replicate the whole upper part of a horse's body from head to tail, with a skirt attached below. Each \\"rider\\" wears a pointed cap with a tassel and used to wield an inflated bladder on a stick; now, like the tricorned big-heads called Kilikis who parade with them, they carry a phallic verga made of foam-rubber which they use to belabour the onlookers. Belgium =Lume√ßon, Ducasse de Mons= A 19th century illustration of the Mons dragon with hobby horses Also known as the \\"Doudou\\", the Ducasse de Mons is a festival that takes place on Trinity Sunday in the town of Mons and consists of two parts. The first is a procession with the shrine of Saint Waltrude. The second part, called the Lume√ßon, depicts the combat of St George and the Dragon and features a large processional dragon with an enormously long, stiff tail. Saint George's attempts to kill the dragon with his lance all fail, so he then dispatches it with a pistol! An illustration from the 19th century clearly shows the dragon with three hobby-horses of the \\"tourney\\" type, but modern photographs and descriptions of the event show these animals are made of cow-hide and look more like dogs; they are known as Chinchins or Chins-Chins (a corruption of chien, dog) and their role is to aid St. George.French Wikip√©dia article The festival has been recognised by UNESCO since 2005 as one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity under the general heading of \\"Processional Giants and Dragons in Belgium and France\\".UNESCO Intangible History website Czech Republic =Killing the Mare, Shrovetide= The finale to the Shrovetide processions in the town of Hlinsko, in the Czech Republic, and six nearby villages (including Hamry, Blatno, Studnice and Vortov√°), in the Hlinecko region of eastern Bohemia, is a ritual called \\"Killing the Mare. Accompanied by a brass band, men and boys wearing colourful costumes representing traditional characters spend a whole day going from door to door, visiting every household in their community (except those known to be in mourning). Details differ slightly from place to place, but there are usually two or three hobby-horses (of the tourney type). Other characters include the Straw Men, dressed in costumes made of rice-straw, with blacked faces, and tall, pointed straw hats; they embrace women and roll with them on the ground, which is said to confer fertility. Housewives gather straw from the Straw Men's skirts as a good luck charm, taking it home to feed their geese and chickens. With the \\"Little Wife\\" (a man dressed as a woman) and the \\"dotted man\\", four dancers representing Turks perform a ritual dance in front of each house, to ensure wealth for the family and a good harvest. They must lift their legs as high as possible to ensure tall crops of flax. They wave handkerchieves, as in the English morris dance but originally wielded sabres instead. At the end of the day the men perform a ritual called \\"Killing the Mare\\". One of the group's hobby horses, is judged and then \\"killed\\" for its alleged sins. It is then \\"brought back to life\\" (with alcohol) and a dance ensues, involving the onlookers. This custom has survived despite being banned in the 18th and 19th centuries by the Catholic Church and in the 20th by the Socialist government. It has now been recognised by UNESCO as an element of mankind's Intangible Cultural Heritage.A film on the UNESCO website; many of the above details were taken from the film's narration France Several hobby-horse customs exist in the Languedoc area of southwest France, which is a stronghold for \\"totem\\" animals, with many towns and villages having their own particular creature; most appear at carnival time and/or their local patronal festivals, saint's days and other festivities.French Wikip√©dia: Animaux tot√©miques de l'H√©rault =Le Poulain de P√©zenas= The Poulain from P√©zenas (visiting Steenvoorde, in northeast France, for the Festival of Giants in 2006) At P√©zenas there is a huge creature called Le Poulain or Lo Polin (Occitan for \\"the colt\\"), carried by nine men and led by another, accompanied by a band of musicians. The Poulain has a realistically carved wooden head, with a snapping jaws and an extending neck that can reach up to first-floor windows; money or other offerings put into its mouth tumble down inside its neck. Its semi- cylindrical body is covered with a dark blue cloth, now decorated with stars and the coat of arms of P√©zenas. Below the frame it has a tricolor skirt.Bastian, Jean-Marie, \\"Le Poulain, P√©zenas\\", pp9‚Äì10 & 22, Cercle de Collectionneurs de P√©zenas, May 2009 The Poulain carries two effigies on its back, one male, one female, called Estieinou and Estieinette (or Estieineta). Although the first written reference to the Poulain is from 1615, the creature is supposed to commemorate a visit to the town in 1226 by Louis VIII, during which the king's favourite mare fell ill. She had to be left behind in P√©zenas while Louis continued with the Albigensian Crusade. On his return he was astonished to find that not only was his mare now fully recovered, but she had also given birth to a fine colt, which was duly presented to him, adorned with ribbons. In return he decreed that the town should construct a wooden colt to be used to celebrate all its public festivities (this legend was first recorded in 1701).Bastian, Jean-Marie, \\"Le Poulain, P√©zenas\\", pp2‚Äì4, Cercle de Collectionneurs de P√©zenas, May 2009 Its early appearances were on the public feast days of Saint Blaise (3 February), Saint John the Baptist (24 June) and the Feast of the Assumption (15 Aug). As a symbol of power, it also appeared at times when the town's pr√©v√¥t distributed bread to the poor (the last such was in 1911), as well as visits by royalty or other dignitaries. The Poulain was burned in 1789, during the French Revolution, because of its royal associations, but was revived in 1803. Since then it has appeared at Mardi Gras and other festive occasions. Its framework, once a weighty construction of chestnut, has been made of aluminium since 1989.Bastian, Jean-Marie, \\"Le Poulain, P√©zenas\\", pp6‚Äì8, Cercle de Collectionneurs de P√©zenas, May 2009 Originally the Poulain had no riders; Estieinou and Estieinette (sometimes spelled Esti√©non and Esti√©neta in the French manner) are meant to recall another royal occasion when Louis XIII visited the town in 1622; the Mar√©chal de Bassompierre, following the King, was crossing the river Peyne on horseback. He saw a peasant-woman having difficulty making the crossing on foot and gallantly offered her a seat on his horse. Their merry arrival in the town caused great amusement and so the two effigies were made to remember the event.Bastian, Jean-Marie, \\"Le Poulain, P√©zenas\\", pp2-3, Cercle de Collectionneurs de P√©zenas, May 2009 There have been smaller, junior Poulains in P√©zenas, made by or for children; the P√©zenas fadas also have a full-sized version of their own. There have also been similar creatures or imitations elsewhere, some of which still continue. There is a very lively Poulain at Saint-Thib√©ry and others are (or have been) known at Adissan, Alignan-du-Vent, Florensac, Montblanc and Vias (where it is linked to a local legend of a medieval famine and is known as lo Pouli de la Fabo ‚Äì the colt of the bean). They have also been recorded at Agde, Caux, Montagnac, Castelnau, Valros and Nizas, all in the Languedoc. An outlier in the Ari√®ge, at St Pierre de Soulan, was instigated by a former inhabitant of P√©zenas.Bastian, Jean-Marie, \\"Le Poulain, P√©zenas\\", p32, Cercle de Collectionneurs de P√©zenas, May 2009 =Lou chivalet or le chevalet= Hobby horses of the tourney type, with a frame suspended around the dancer's waist, can also appear at various festivities in the Languedoc. An illustration of the chivalet dance, and its traditional tune, and an old photograph of an animal of this type, are on show in the folk museum at Agde. It is particularly associated with Florensac, where it is called le chevalet, and is considered the town's totem.Bessan in French Wikip√©dia The Chevalet of Cournonterral in the H√©rault died out around 1980 but was revived in March 2011 as part of the annual carnival.Official video of the revival Chivalet on 5 March 2011 =L'√¢ne de Bessan= The √Çne de Bessan The Donkey or Ass of Bessan is another of the Languedoc's \\"totem\\" animals. Much smaller than the Poulain, it is made from a frame covered in cloth and decorated with crepe paper flowers and painted motifs. Under its skirt it is carried by four men, led by another who dresses in white, with a tricolor sash, and cracks a whip. The √Çne dances from side to side and backwards and forwards to traditional tunes played nowadays on various instruments, although until the 1970s it was only the traditional hautbois (a type of oboe) and drums. Sometimes the beast bucks its hindquarters into the air, supported only by the leader and the first dancer, who twirls around; the other three stand ready to catch the frame as it descends. The √Çne is brought out to open the feast of St Laurent, appearing first at 5pm on the Saturday closest to the saint's day, accompanied by firecrackers and bells, then again on the Sunday morning when it goes to a Mass to be blessed, before its final dance. There is also an √Çne at Gignac. Le Cheval-Bayard de Clermont-l'H√©rault was revived in 1988, after more than a century and a half. The town's original cheval-bayard was burned in 1815; known as the Bayard (baiard in Occitan), meaning a bay horse, its origins have been traced back to the 9th century. =Other \\"totem\\" animals of the H√©rault= Perhaps the best-known is the Chameau (Camel) of B√©ziers, which dates from 1613, two years earlier than the Poulain of P√©zenas. There is a large and impressive Boeuf (Bull) at M√®ze, with a huge mouth; it is said to date back to at least 1229. Lo Picart, at Saint-Jean-de-Fos, is a ferocious ram; it has existed since at least 1683. Montagnac has a goat. Sometimes the choice of animal is based on a play on words: Loupian has, unsurprisingly, a wolf (Loup). (One of the most recent, and possibly the most bizarre, \\"totems\\" is Le Porquet of Pinet, a caterpillar, created in the early 1970s.) =Provence, Lei Chivaux Frus= Several \\"frisky horses\\", tourney hobby horses, accompany the traditional group Les Tambourinaires de Sant-Sumian, from Brignoles, a folklore revival group founded in 1942.Sant-Sumian websiteFolklore Var-Provence Their performances are faithfully based on authentic traditions, such as the Chivau Frusc cited by author Frederic Mistral at Aix-en-ProvenceRuiz, Juana Casta√±o, Las fiestas en la obra de Frederi Mistral, University of Murcia, 1987, pp156-158, and folklorist Violet Alford, principally at Brignoles but also \\"all over southern Provence\\".Alford, Violet, \\"Some Other Hobby Horses\\", Folklore, 78, 3, Autumn 1967, pp207‚Äì211 Germany =Odenwald: Christmas Bock, Esel and Schimmelreiter= Various creatures used to appear in the Odenwald around Christmas,Waldweihnachten website (in German) including straw bearsWaldweihnachten: Strohnickelgestalten (in German) and bock figures(variations of which can also be found in Sweden and other parts of Scandiniavia around Midwinter and Christmas time perhaps having links to the Germanic God Thor and perhaps even older fertility rights). The bock (the name can be translated as \\"goat\\", \\"buck\\", \\"ram\\" or \\"stag\\") was made in a similar way to a mast horse, but using a long, two- or three-pronged hayfork that formed from its horns, covered in a white sheet, partly stuffed to form a head with a face painted onto it; these were sometimes held up outside windows to frighten the householder. Sometimes two people stood under the sheet to form a longer-bodied creature.Waldweihnachten: Bockgestalten (in German) Weihnachtsesels (Christmas donkeys) were made in a similar way, usually with two people bending over under a darker coloured blanket, rather like a pantomime horse.Waldweihnachten: Eselgestalten (in German) The schimmelreiter was a more elaborate construction, made from two (or more) large sieves or riddles fastened in an upright position in front of and behind the \\"rider\\" at chest level. The front sieve had a stuffed fabric head and neck attached. The whole was covered with a sheet with a small hole in the centre to allow just the rider's head to show.Waldweihnachten: Schimmelreiter (in German) Ireland =L√°ir Bh√°n= The teams of Irish mummers known as Wrenboys who perform on Saint Stephen's Day (26 December) in pubs and private houses have been known to include a white hobby horse (L√°ir Bh√°n ‚Äì c.f. Laare Vane, above) of the tourney type, and this has survived into the present century, at Dunquin in County Kerry for example.Dreoil√≠n Dh√∫n Chaoin / Dunquin Wren 2006 At Ballycotton, in Co. Cork, a L√°ir bh√°n led a procession of horn- blowing youths at Halloween who collected money \\"in the name of Muck Olla\\" (a legendary giant boar).Hole, Christina (1978). A Dictionary of British Folk Customs, p133, Paladin Granada, The Lajkonik Poland A painting of the Lajkonik celebrations from 1818 by Micha≈Ç Stachowicz =Lajkonik= :: The city of Krak√≥w has a hobby- horse called the Lajkonik which traditionally appears on the first Thursday after the religious feast of Corpus Christi and parades through the streets, collecting money, accompanied by musicians and costumed followers, some in traditional Polish costume, others in oriental dress, who carry horsetail insignia. The colourful costume of the Lajkonik represents a bearded Tatar warrior, who carries a golden mace and is mounted on a white horse. To be touched by the mace is said to bring good luck. The custom is said to have been carried on for 700 years, and various stories are told to explain its origins. The hobby horse has become an unofficial symbol of Krak√≥w, and versions often appear as tourist attraction in the Market Square.Lajkonik The mulassa (mule) of Tarragona, Spain Spain The mule of Sant Feliu de Llobregat, Catalonia, Spain =Carnaval de Lantz= Zaldiko, a Basque hobby horse in Lantz, Spain A Basque hobby horse at Alava, Spain, in 1994 The Basque country on the borders of France and Spain has a strong dance tradition. Several dances are linked to seasonal festivals. The zamaltzain, a hobby horse of the \\"tourney\\" type, with a small wooden head and a short, lacy skirt, takes part in some dances and processions in Zuberoa (La Soule, the easternmost part of the Basque country) in places such as Ezpeize, Maule, Urdi√±arbe, Barkoxe, Altza, Altz√ºr√ºk√º and Atarratze.Truffaut, Thierry, La Danse Basque, Lauburu, Bidart, 1981 The \\"rider\\" wears elaborate costume of red or black including a koha, a tall, beribboned hat, which always has a mirror on the front. \\"Zamaltzain\\" means muleteer or mule-keeper.Online Basque dictionary The dance in which the \\"mules\\" take part is danced by two teams, one dressed in red, the other in black, and is said by some scholars (such as Eug√®ne Goyh√©n√®che of the University of Pau) to represent an attack on a village by the men of another. =Catalonia= Els cavallets (the little horses) at Olot, Catalonia There are many festivals in the Catalonia region of north-east Spain which involve processions with giants and outsize animals; some also involve hobby horses (of the \\"tourney\\" type, but with a more-or-less realistic head and body, nowadays often constructed from fibreglass). Larger figures of mules are also found in several places, carried by two performers whose legs are visible beneath a skirt hanging from the animal's hollow body. In addition, dragons of various sorts are also popular, as are bulls, eagles and lions; many have fireworks attached to them, or set off around them. =Fiesta de Santa Tecla, Tarragona= The Santa Tecla Festival takes place at Tarragona from 15‚Äì24 September and includes the saint's day, 23 September. A number of animals, real and mythical, are impersonated in the parades that form a major part of the festivities. Among them is a larger- than-life Mulassa (mule) carried by two dancers who are hidden under its skirts, apart from their legs. The other creatures that take part are the √†liga (eagle), bou (bull), cucafera (coco, a mythical monster), drac de Sant Roc (dragon of Saint Roch), lle√≥ (lion), and v√≠bria (a female wyvern with prominent breasts). Several of these have fireworks attached to their extremities, or are showered with sparks by their attendants, and are a spectacular sight. =Parade of Giants and Big-heads, Pamplona= :See: Basque country (above) =Asia= Indonesia =Kuda Kepang, Kuda Lumping or Jaran Kepang= Image:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Een Javaanse danser op een stokpaard in trance etend als een paard TMnr 10004823.jpgKuda Kepang dancer in a trance, eating straw, like a horse (1928) File:COLLECTIE_TROPENMUSEUM_Eerste_bedrijf_uit_een_dansvoorstelling_waarin_een_draak_met_vier_ruiters_wordt_opgevoerd_TMnr_10004817.jpgFour Kuda Kepang hobby horses with Reog Ponogoro (tiger masked dancers), East Java File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Stokpaard van gevlochten bamboe TMnr 15-922c.jpgA black kuda kepang of woven bamboo from Yogyakarta File:Malang dans.jpgModern Malay folk dance display (2005) File:Kuda Lumping in Cemoro dyk.JPGFemale Kuda Lumping dancer in Cemoro village, Temanggung (2011) Modern Kuda Lumping (or Jaran Kepang) procession in Yogyakarta (2008) Kuda Kepang (woven bamboo horses, also known as Kuda Lumping or Jaran Kepang) originate in the state of Johor and performances are often given at weddings by Malayan men of Javanese origin in Singapore and elsewhere.

The mischievous horse was not intended to be malevolent, but its appearance and antics often frightened those it visited or encountered.O'Brien, Andrea, \\"The Hobby Horse\\", in Intangible Cultural Heritage Update, Dec 2009, p2, Heritage Foundation of Newfoundland and Labrador, St John's, Canada Mummering was dying out but has enjoyed a recent revival, and the first Mummers Festival (held in St John's in December 2009) even had workshops on making hobby horses.Intangible Cultural Heritage Update, Dec 2009, pp3 & 5, Heritage Foundation of Newfoundland and Labrador, St John's, CanadaSquarey, Melissa, \\"Hobby Horse Workshops\\" in Intangible Cultural Heritage Update, Dec 2010, p2, Heritage Foundation of Newfoundland and Labrador, St John's, Canada  Etymology  The word hobby is glossed by the OED as \\"a small or middle-sized horse; an ambling or pacing horse; a pony.\\" The word is attested in English from the 14th century, as Middle English hobyn. Old French had hobin or haubby, whence Modern French aubin and Italian ubino. But the Old French term is apparently adopted from English rather than vice versa. OED connects it to \\"the by-name Hobin, Hobby\\", a variant of Robin\\" (compare the abbreviation Hob for Robert). This appears to have been a name customarily given to a cart-horse, as attested by White Kennett in his Parochial Antiquities (1695), who stated that \\"Our ploughmen to some one of their cart-horses generally give the name of Hobin, the very word which Phil. Comines uses, Hist. VI. vii.\\" Another familiar form of the same Christian name, Dobbin has also become a generic name for a cart-horse. Samuel Johnson, Dictionary of the English Language, 1755, glosses \\"A strong, active horse, of a middle size, said to have been originally from Ireland; an ambling nag.\\" Hoblers or Hovellers were men who kept a light nag that they may give instant information of threatened invasion. (Old French, hober, to move up and down; our hobby, q.v.) In medi√¶val times their duties were to reconnoitre, to carry intelligence, to harass stragglers, to act as spies, to intercept convoys, and to pursue fugitives. Henry Spelman (d. 1641) derived the word from \\"hobby\\". The Border horses, called hobblers or hobbies, were small and active, and trained to cross the most difficult and boggy country, \\"and to get over where our footmen could scarce dare to follow.\\" - George MacDonald Fraser, The Steel Bonnets, The Story of the Anglo-Scottish Border Reivers.

Molecular cloning is a set of experimental methods in molecular biology that are used to assemble recombinant DNA molecules and to direct their replication within host organisms. The use of the word cloning refers to the fact that the method involves the replication of one molecule to produce a population of cells with identical DNA molecules. Molecular cloning generally uses DNA sequences from two different organisms: the species that is the source of the DNA to be cloned, and the species that will serve as the living host for replication of the recombinant DNA. Molecular cloning methods are central to many contemporary areas of modern biology and medicine. In a conventional molecular cloning experiment, the DNA to be cloned is obtained from an organism of interest, then treated with enzymes in the test tube to generate smaller DNA fragments. Subsequently, these fragments are then combined with vector DNA to generate recombinant DNA molecules. The recombinant DNA is then introduced into a host organism (typically an easy-to-grow, benign, laboratory strain of E. coli bacteria). This will generate a population of organisms in which recombinant DNA molecules are replicated along with the host DNA. Because they contain foreign DNA fragments, these are transgenic or genetically modified microorganisms (GMO). This process takes advantage of the fact that a single bacterial cell can be induced to take up and replicate a single recombinant DNA molecule. This single cell can then be expanded exponentially to generate a large amount of bacteria, each of which contain copies of the original recombinant molecule. Thus, both the resulting bacterial population, and the recombinant DNA molecule, are commonly referred to as \\"clones\\". Strictly speaking, recombinant DNA refers to DNA molecules, while molecular cloning refers to the experimental methods used to assemble them. The idea arose that different DNA sequences could be inserted into a plasmid and that these foreign sequences would be carried into bacteria and digested as part of the plasmid. That is, these plasmids could serve as cloning vectors to carry genes. Virtually any DNA sequence can be cloned and amplified, but there are some factors that might limit the success of the process. Examples of the DNA sequences that are difficult to clone are inverted repeats, origins of replication, centromeres and telomeres. Another characteristic that limits chances of success is large size of DNA sequence. Inserts larger than 10kbp have very limited success, but bacteriophages such as bacteriophage Œª can be modified to successfully insert a sequence up to 40 kbp. History Prior to the 1970s, the understanding of genetics and molecular biology was severely hampered by an inability to isolate and study individual genes from complex organisms. This changed dramatically with the advent of molecular cloning methods. Microbiologists, seeking to understand the molecular mechanisms through which bacteria restricted the growth of bacteriophage, isolated restriction endonucleases, enzymes that could cleave DNA molecules only when specific DNA sequences were encountered. They showed that restriction enzymes cleaved chromosome-length DNA molecules at specific locations, and that specific sections of the larger molecule could be purified by size fractionation. Using a second enzyme, DNA ligase, fragments generated by restriction enzymes could be joined in new combinations, termed recombinant DNA. By recombining DNA segments of interest with vector DNA, such as bacteriophage or plasmids, which naturally replicate inside bacteria, large quantities of purified recombinant DNA molecules could be produced in bacterial cultures. The first recombinant DNA molecules were generated and studied in 1972. Overview Molecular cloning takes advantage of the fact that the chemical structure of DNA is fundamentally the same in all living organisms. Therefore, if any segment of DNA from any organism is inserted into a DNA segment containing the molecular sequences required for DNA replication, and the resulting recombinant DNA is introduced into the organism from which the replication sequences were obtained, then the foreign DNA will be replicated along with the host cell's DNA in the transgenic organism. Molecular cloning is similar to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in that it permits the replication of DNA sequence. The fundamental difference between the two methods is that molecular cloning involves replication of the DNA in a living microorganism, while PCR replicates DNA in an in vitro solution, free of living cells. Steps The overall goal of molecular cloning is to take a gene of interest from one plasmid and insert it into another plasmid This is done by performing PCR, digestive reaction, ligation reaction, and transformation. In standard molecular cloning experiments, the cloning of any DNA fragment essentially involves seven steps: (1) Choice of host organism and cloning vector, (2) Preparation of vector DNA, (3) Preparation of DNA to be cloned, (4) Creation of recombinant DNA, (5) Introduction of recombinant DNA into host organism, (6) Selection of organisms containing recombinant DNA, (7) Screening for clones with desired DNA inserts and biological properties. Although the detailed planning of the cloning can be done in any text editor, together with online utilities for e.g. PCR primer design, dedicated software exist for the purpose. Software for the purpose include for example ApE (open source), DNAStrider (open source), Serial Cloner (gratis) and Collagene (open source). Notably, the growing capacity and fidelity of DNA synthesis platforms allows for increasingly intricate designs in molecular engineering. These projects may include very long strands of novel DNA sequence and/or test entire libraries simultaneously, as opposed to of individual sequences. These shifts introduce complexity that require design to move away from the flat nucleotide-based representation and towards a higher level of abstraction. Examples of such tools are GenoCAD, Teselagen (free for academia) or GeneticConstructor (free for academics). =Choice of host organism and cloning vector= Diagram of a commonly used cloning plasmid; pBR322. It's a circular piece of DNA 4361 bases long. Two antibiotic resistance genes are present, conferring resistance to ampicillin and tetracycline, and an origin of replication that the host uses to replicate the DNA. Although a very large number of host organisms and molecular cloning vectors are in use, the great majority of molecular cloning experiments begin with a laboratory strain of the bacterium E. coli (Escherichia coli) and a plasmid cloning vector. E. coli and plasmid vectors are in common use because they are technically sophisticated, versatile, widely available, and offer rapid growth of recombinant organisms with minimal equipment. If the DNA to be cloned is exceptionally large (hundreds of thousands to millions of base pairs), then a bacterial artificial chromosome or yeast artificial chromosome vector is often chosen. Specialized applications may call for specialized host-vector systems. For example, if the experimentalists wish to harvest a particular protein from the recombinant organism, then an expression vector is chosen that contains appropriate signals for transcription and translation in the desired host organism. Alternatively, if replication of the DNA in different species is desired (for example, transfer of DNA from bacteria to plants), then a multiple host range vector (also termed shuttle vector) may be selected. In practice, however, specialized molecular cloning experiments usually begin with cloning into a bacterial plasmid, followed by subcloning into a specialized vector. Whatever combination of host and vector are used, the vector almost always contains four DNA segments that are critically important to its function and experimental utility: * DNA replication origin is necessary for the vector (and its linked recombinant sequences) to replicate inside the host organism * one or more unique restriction endonuclease recognition sites to serves as sites where foreign DNA may be introduced * a selectable genetic marker gene that can be used to enable the survival of cells that have taken up vector sequences * a tag gene that can be used to screen for cells containing the foreign DNA Cleavage of a DNA sequence containing the BamHI restriction site. The DNA is cleaved at the palindromic sequence to produce 'sticky ends'. =Preparation of vector DNA= The cloning vector is treated with a restriction endonuclease to cleave the DNA at the site where foreign DNA will be inserted. The restriction enzyme is chosen to generate a configuration at the cleavage site that is compatible with the ends of the foreign DNA (see DNA end). Typically, this is done by cleaving the vector DNA and foreign DNA with the same restriction enzyme, for example EcoRI. Most modern vectors contain a variety of convenient cleavage sites that are unique within the vector molecule (so that the vector can only be cleaved at a single site) and are located within a gene (frequently beta- galactosidase) whose inactivation can be used to distinguish recombinant from non-recombinant organisms at a later step in the process. To improve the ratio of recombinant to non-recombinant organisms, the cleaved vector may be treated with an enzyme (alkaline phosphatase) that dephosphorylates the vector ends. Vector molecules with dephosphorylated ends are unable to replicate, and replication can only be restored if foreign DNA is integrated into the cleavage site. =Preparation of DNA to be cloned= DNA for cloning is most commonly produced using PCR. Template DNA is mixed with bases (the building blocks of DNA), primers (short pieces of complementary single stranded DNA) and a DNA polymerase enzyme that builds the DNA chain. The mix goes through cycles of heating and cooling to produce large quantities of copied DNA. For cloning of genomic DNA, the DNA to be cloned is extracted from the organism of interest. Virtually any tissue source can be used (even tissues from extinct animals), as long as the DNA is not extensively degraded. The DNA is then purified using simple methods to remove contaminating proteins (extraction with phenol), RNA (ribonuclease) and smaller molecules (precipitation and/or chromatography). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods are often used for amplification of specific DNA or RNA (RT-PCR) sequences prior to molecular cloning. DNA for cloning experiments may also be obtained from RNA using reverse transcriptase (complementary DNA or cDNA cloning), or in the form of synthetic DNA (artificial gene synthesis). cDNA cloning is usually used to obtain clones representative of the mRNA population of the cells of interest, while synthetic DNA is used to obtain any precise sequence defined by the designer. Such a designed sequence may be required when moving genes across genetic codes (for example, from the mitochrondria to the nucleus) or simply for increasing expression via codon optimization. The purified DNA is then treated with a restriction enzyme to generate fragments with ends capable of being linked to those of the vector. If necessary, short double-stranded segments of DNA (linkers) containing desired restriction sites may be added to create end structures that are compatible with the vector. =Creation of recombinant DNA with DNA ligase= The creation of recombinant DNA is in many ways the simplest step of the molecular cloning process. DNA prepared from the vector and foreign source are simply mixed together at appropriate concentrations and exposed to an enzyme (DNA ligase) that covalently links the ends together. This joining reaction is often termed ligation. The resulting DNA mixture containing randomly joined ends is then ready for introduction into the host organism. DNA ligase only recognizes and acts on the ends of linear DNA molecules, usually resulting in a complex mixture of DNA molecules with randomly joined ends. The desired products (vector DNA covalently linked to foreign DNA) will be present, but other sequences (e.g. foreign DNA linked to itself, vector DNA linked to itself and higher-order combinations of vector and foreign DNA) are also usually present. This complex mixture is sorted out in subsequent steps of the cloning process, after the DNA mixture is introduced into cells. =Introduction of recombinant DNA into host organism= The DNA mixture, previously manipulated in vitro, is moved back into a living cell, referred to as the host organism. The methods used to get DNA into cells are varied, and the name applied to this step in the molecular cloning process will often depend upon the experimental method that is chosen (e.g. transformation, transduction, transfection, electroporation). When microorganisms are able to take up and replicate DNA from their local environment, the process is termed transformation, and cells that are in a physiological state such that they can take up DNA are said to be competent. In mammalian cell culture, the analogous process of introducing DNA into cells is commonly termed transfection. Both transformation and transfection usually require preparation of the cells through a special growth regime and chemical treatment process that will vary with the specific species and cell types that are used. Electroporation uses high voltage electrical pulses to translocate DNA across the cell membrane (and cell wall, if present). In contrast, transduction involves the packaging of DNA into virus-derived particles, and using these virus-like particles to introduce the encapsulated DNA into the cell through a process resembling viral infection. Although electroporation and transduction are highly specialized methods, they may be the most efficient methods to move DNA into cells. =Selection of organisms containing vector sequences= Whichever method is used, the introduction of recombinant DNA into the chosen host organism is usually a low efficiency process; that is, only a small fraction of the cells will actually take up DNA. Experimental scientists deal with this issue through a step of artificial genetic selection, in which cells that have not taken up DNA are selectively killed, and only those cells that can actively replicate DNA containing the selectable marker gene encoded by the vector are able to survive. When bacterial cells are used as host organisms, the selectable marker is usually a gene that confers resistance to an antibiotic that would otherwise kill the cells, typically ampicillin. Cells harboring the plasmid will survive when exposed to the antibiotic, while those that have failed to take up plasmid sequences will die. When mammalian cells (e.g. human or mouse cells) are used, a similar strategy is used, except that the marker gene (in this case typically encoded as part of the kanMX cassette) confers resistance to the antibiotic Geneticin. =Screening for clones with desired DNA inserts and biological properties= Modern bacterial cloning vectors (e.g. pUC19 and later derivatives including the pGEM vectors) use the blue-white screening system to distinguish colonies (clones) of transgenic cells from those that contain the parental vector (i.e. vector DNA with no recombinant sequence inserted). In these vectors, foreign DNA is inserted into a sequence that encodes an essential part of beta- galactosidase, an enzyme whose activity results in formation of a blue-colored colony on the culture medium that is used for this work. Insertion of the foreign DNA into the beta-galactosidase coding sequence disables the function of the enzyme so that colonies containing transformed DNA remain colorless (white). Therefore, experimentalists are easily able to identify and conduct further studies on transgenic bacterial clones, while ignoring those that do not contain recombinant DNA. The total population of individual clones obtained in a molecular cloning experiment is often termed a DNA library. Libraries may be highly complex (as when cloning complete genomic DNA from an organism) or relatively simple (as when moving a previously cloned DNA fragment into a different plasmid), but it is almost always necessary to examine a number of different clones to be sure that the desired DNA construct is obtained. This may be accomplished through a very wide range of experimental methods, including the use of nucleic acid hybridizations, antibody probes, polymerase chain reaction, restriction fragment analysis and/or DNA sequencing. Applications Molecular cloning provides scientists with an essentially unlimited quantity of any individual DNA segments derived from any genome. This material can be used for a wide range of purposes, including those in both basic and applied biological science. A few of the more important applications are summarized here. =Genome organization and gene expression= Molecular cloning has led directly to the elucidation of the complete DNA sequence of the genomes of a very large number of species and to an exploration of genetic diversity within individual species, work that has been done mostly by determining the DNA sequence of large numbers of randomly cloned fragments of the genome, and assembling the overlapping sequences. At the level of individual genes, molecular clones are used to generate probes that are used for examining how genes are expressed, and how that expression is related to other processes in biology, including the metabolic environment, extracellular signals, development, learning, senescence and cell death. Cloned genes can also provide tools to examine the biological function and importance of individual genes, by allowing investigators to inactivate the genes, or make more subtle mutations using regional mutagenesis or site-directed mutagenesis. Genes cloned into expression vectors for functional cloning provide a means to screen for genes on the basis of the expressed protein's function. =Production of recombinant proteins= Obtaining the molecular clone of a gene can lead to the development of organisms that produce the protein product of the cloned genes, termed a recombinant protein. In practice, it is frequently more difficult to develop an organism that produces an active form of the recombinant protein in desirable quantities than it is to clone the gene. This is because the molecular signals for gene expression are complex and variable, and because protein folding, stability and transport can be very challenging. Many useful proteins are currently available as recombinant products. These include(1) medically useful proteins whose administration can correct a defective or poorly expressed gene (e.g. recombinant factor VIII, a blood-clotting factor deficient in some forms of hemophilia, and recombinant insulin, used to treat some forms of diabetes), (2) proteins that can be administered to assist in a life-threatening emergency (e.g. tissue plasminogen activator, used to treat strokes), (3) recombinant subunit vaccines, in which a purified protein can be used to immunize patients against infectious diseases, without exposing them to the infectious agent itself (e.g. hepatitis B vaccine), and (4) recombinant proteins as standard material for diagnostic laboratory tests. =Transgenic organisms= Once characterized and manipulated to provide signals for appropriate expression, cloned genes may be inserted into organisms, generating transgenic organisms, also termed genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Although most GMOs are generated for purposes of basic biological research (see for example, transgenic mouse), a number of GMOs have been developed for commercial use, ranging from animals and plants that produce pharmaceuticals or other compounds (pharming), herbicide-resistant crop plants, and fluorescent tropical fish (GloFish) for home entertainment. =Gene therapy= Gene therapy involves supplying a functional gene to cells lacking that function, with the aim of correcting a genetic disorder or acquired disease. Gene therapy can be broadly divided into two categories. The first is alteration of germ cells, that is, sperm or eggs, which results in a permanent genetic change for the whole organism and subsequent generations. This ‚Äúgerm line gene therapy‚Äù is considered by many to be unethical in human beings. The second type of gene therapy, ‚Äúsomatic cell gene therapy‚Äù, is analogous to an organ transplant. In this case, one or more specific tissues are targeted by direct treatment or by removal of the tissue, addition of the therapeutic gene or genes in the laboratory, and return of the treated cells to the patient. Clinical trials of somatic cell gene therapy began in the late 1990s, mostly for the treatment of cancers and blood, liver, and lung disorders. Despite a great deal of publicity and promises, the history of human gene therapy has been characterized by relatively limited success. The effect of introducing a gene into cells often promotes only partial and/or transient relief from the symptoms of the disease being treated. Some gene therapy trial patients have suffered adverse consequences of the treatment itself, including deaths. In some cases, the adverse effects result from disruption of essential genes within the patient's genome by insertional inactivation. In others, viral vectors used for gene therapy have been contaminated with infectious virus. Nevertheless, gene therapy is still held to be a promising future area of medicine, and is an area where there is a significant level of research and development activity.

He studied at the Coll√®ge des Quatre-Nations, and afterwards served the French administration as an official in the Seine department. His parents had planned for him a career as medical doctor, a project frustrated by the events of the French Revolution, a fact that inspired in Charles-Jean Bonnin a deep interest for political issues. His true vocation was born early during his youth, thanks to the works of Montesquieu, Mably, Bacon, F√©nelon and Cornelius, to whom he professed great admiration. He met Auguste Comte in 1829, becoming his friend until his death. Amongst many references to him during his lifetime, the work of M. Lemonier stands out. It is entitled Notice Historique,M. Lemonier 'Historical Record', and heads the work named Pens√©es, 'Thoughts', of C.J.B. Bonnin. This document was promoted by Bonnin and, maybe, was reviewed by him also. Inside of the French administration files some references to him can be found, like his possible membership to franc-masonry. Also, by these files we know that he spent thirteenth months in prison due to certain passages of his book √âtudes L√©gislatives, 'Legislative Studies', where he criticized Catholicism.

Georges Langrod rightly claimed that \\"the science of administration, in the modern sense of the expression, was born in France in the nineteenth century. Its pioneer was Charles-Jean Bonnin, author of 'Principles of Public Administration', whose first edition dates back to 1808. Likewise, Jacques Chevallier and D√°niele Loschak have commented that \\"he can be considered the true founder of French administrative science.\\" Nevertheless, Charles-Jean Bonnin is more than that, much more: he is the founder of the worldwide science of Public Administration.

Burton Jablin, as Vice President of Programming, set the tone and oversaw the production of the early series. About 90 percent of the channel's programming consisted of original productions at launch, with ten percent licensed and rerun from Canadian channels, PBS, and other sources. Using local Scripps cable franchises (since divested), the Federal Communications Commission \\"must carry\\" provisions of Scripps medium-market television stations, and other small television operators to gain cable carriage, the channel launched on December 30, 1994. The major programming themes, unchanged since the beginning, were home building and remodeling, landscaping and gardening, decorating and design, and crafts and hobbies. HGTV logo used from December 30, 1994 to March 1, 2010. During its development, the channel was originally named the Home, Lawn, and Garden Channel. The name was later shortened and a logo was developed. The logo was amended in 2010, with this version debuting on March 1 of that year. The square with the \\"G\\" in it was removed, the roof was increased in size and the \\"HGTV\\" letters are now set in Gotham Black (from the original mixture of Futura and Times New Roman), with the other Gotham fonts being used around the network. The network debuted with a skeletal staff, but with gradual acceptance by other cable operators, it now reaches 94 million households in the United States and has either partner networks, or network interests, internationally elsewhere. It is now referred to simply as \\"HGTV\\"; the full name of the channel is de-emphasized. In July 2008, the E.W. Scripps Company spun off the channel and the other Scripps cable channels and web-based properties into a separate company, Scripps Networks Interactive; E.W. Scripps broadcast television and newspaper properties remain as part of the original company. In December 2011, the channel began broadcasting all of its programming in 16:9 aspect ratio format on its primary standard definition channel. This results in the appearance of black bars on the top and bottom of the screen on 4:3 aspect ratio televisions; its high-definition channel displays the channel's programming in its native aspect ratio. On March 6, 2018, Discovery Communications completed its merger with Scripps Networks Interactive and assumed control of HGTV, Food Network and Travel Channel. Programming At the February 23‚Äì25, 2018, Capital Remodel and Garden Show at the Dulles Expo Center, (l to r) Chris Lambton and Peyton Lambton HGTV's current programming focuses primarily on home-buying, renovation, and reality shows following the business of house flipping. SNI CEO Ken Lowe stated of the programming strategy that \\"We're not going to surprise you. We're not going to throw you a curve ball. It's not easy to create content that people are passionate about and somewhat addicted to that is somewhat repetitive.\\" As of 2016, HGTV has invested at least $400 million annually on original programming. An annual promotion held by the network is the HGTV Dream Home, a sweepstakes which awards a custom-built house as its grand prize. = High definition = The 1080i high definition simulcast feed of HGTV launched on March 31, 2008. Originally, the HD channel did not simulcast the standard definition feed of HGTV. Instead, the HD channel featured programming separate from the standard channel. The standard definition feed of the channel began to carry the full 16:9 aspect ratio downgraded from the HD feed in a letterboxed format in early 2013. Carrier disputes =Cablevision= On December 31, 2009, Scripps Networks Interactive removed the Food Network and HGTV from New York City-area cable provider Cablevision, on the day that its carriage contract was set to expire. After months of negotiations, an agreement between Scripps and Cablevision was not reached, prompting the removal of the two channels. On January 21, 2010, Cablevision and Scripps reached a deal and the channels were restored to Cablevision's systems in the New York City area on the same day and by the next day in other areas. =AT&T; U-verse= On November 5, 2010, AT&T; U-verse dropped the DIY Network, Cooking Channel, Food Network, Great American Country and HGTV, due to a carriage dispute with Scripps Networks.\\"AT&T;'s U-verse Drops Food Network, HGTV and Other Scrippy-s Networks\\", Chicago Tribune.

November 7, 2010.\\"AT&T; U-verse, Scripps Reconnect on Carriage Contract\\". Multichannel News. November 7, 2010.  Controversies  On June 13, 2012, representatives for HGTV admitted that scenes featured in the original series House Hunters are mostly re-creations of prior events. In many cases, the final decision and purchase were made prior to filming. In some cases, homes visited were not even on the market. In May 2014, HGTV decided not to premiere the Benham Brothers' series Flip It Forward (which was created for the channel), due to a controversy regarding the Brothers' beliefs concerning homosexuality and anti-abortion. International = Canada = In 1997, Atlantis Communications and Scripps Networks launched a Canadian version of HGTV as a Category B specialty channel. Through a series of acquisitions over the years, Corus Entertainment became Scripps Networks' partner in the network. The Canadian version features much of the same programming as the U.S. channel, as well as domestically-produced programs, and some similar programming acquired from other broadcasters. Some of HGTV Canada's programs have also been picked up by the U.S. channel, with Property Brothers in particular having been among HGTV's most popular programs in the United States. The American channel has also had significant success with the Canadian-produced series Love It or List It, which was originally produced for W Network (a corporate sister to the Canadian HGTV network). =Singapore= On 6 March 2014, HGTV launched in Singapore via Starhub TV, but on 31 August 2018, it (and other Discovery Network channels) ceased transmission. It was launched on Singtel TV Platform on 28 September 2018 on Channel 250. =Sri Lanka= HGTV is available in Sri Lanka via Dialog TV = Australia = On 1 February 2015, HGTV launched in Australia on Australian IPTV service Fetch TV.

Keene used the term to refer to people who continued to believe in a paranormal event or phenomenon even after it had been proven to have been staged.Keene, Lamar M. (1976). The Psychic Mafia. St. Martin's Press; New YorkKeene and Spragett, p.151 Keene considered it to be a cognitive disorder, and regarded it as being a key factor in the success of many psychic mediums. The term \\"true believer\\" was used earlier by Eric Hoffer in his 1951 book The True Believer to describe the psychological roots of fanatical groups. Psychology In an article published in Skeptical Inquirer, psychologist Matthew J. Sharps and his colleagues analyze and dissect the psychology of True Believers and their behavior after the predicted apocalypse fails to happen. Using the 2012 Mayan apocalypse prophecy as example, and citing several other similar cases, Sharps contributes four psychological factors that compel these people to continue their belief (or even stronger belief) despite the conflicted reality. *Subclinical dissociative tendencies: While not suffering from mental illness, people with subclinical dissociative tendencies have a higher inclination to experience disconnection with immediate physical reality and propensity to see highly improbable things with enhanced credulity. Such subclinical dissociation is usually associated with paranormal thinking. *Cognitive dissonance: The more one invests in a belief, the more value one will place in this belief and, as a consequence, be more resistant to facts, evidence or reality that contradict this belief. Some of the True Believers in the Keech case in the example below had left their spouses, jobs and given up their possessions to prepare to board the alien spacecraft. When the world did not end, cognitive dissonance- reducing activity (belief disconfirmation response) provided an enhancement of their beliefs and outlet for their heavy investment and discomfort in front of reality. *Gestalt processing: In the continuum in human information processing, people with Gestalt processing will consider a concept without detailed analysis (as opposed to feature-intensive thinking) and accept the idea as a whole relatively uncritically. Sharps suggests a relationship between dissociative tendencies and gestalt processing. People who incline to believe paranormal activities will be more likely to credulously entertain the ancient Mayan prophecies whose details most people know little about. *Availability heuristic: Under the mental shortcut of availability heuristic, people place more importance and give more weight to a belief when examples related to the idea are more readily recalled, most often because they are recent information and latest news. The information of Mayan prophecies has been abundantly available, especially in the media, before the expected apocalyptic date. People's judgments tend to bias toward this latest news, particularly those with dissociative tendency toward supernatural and favor gestalt processing. Examples =M. Lamar Keene and \\"Raoul\\"= In his book The Psychic Mafia, Keene told of his partner, a psychic medium named \\"Raoul\\" in the book. Some in their congregation still believed that Raoul was genuine even after he openly admitted that he was a fake. Keene wrote \\"I knew how easy it was to make people believe a lie, but I didn't expect the same people, confronted with the lie, would choose it over the truth. ... No amount of logic can shatter a faith consciously based on a lie.\\"Keene and Spraggett, pp.141‚Äì151 =Jos√© Alvarez and \\"Carlos\\"= According to The Skeptic's Dictionary, an example of this syndrome is evidenced by an event in 1988 when stage magician James Randi, at the request of an Australian news program, coached stage performer Jos√© Alvarez to pretend he was channelling a two- thousand-year-old spirit named \\"Carlos\\". Even after it was revealed to be a fictional character created by Randi and Alvarez, many people continued to believe that \\"Carlos\\" was real. Randi commented: \\"no amount of evidence, no matter how good it is or how much there is of it, is ever going to convince the true believer to the contrary.\\"ABC News (1998-10-06) \\"The Power of Belief: How Our Beliefs Can Impact Our Minds\\", ABC News (2007-06-04) =Marian Keech and \\"Clarion\\"= In the book When Prophecy Fails, Festinger and his colleagues observed a fringe group led by \\"Marian Keech\\" (researchers' pseudonym) who believed that the world would be destroyed on December 21, 1954 and the true believers would be rescued by aliens on a spaceship to a fictional planet, Clarion. When nothing happened, the group believed that their devotion convinced God to spare the world and they became even more feverish in proselytizing their belief. This is one of the first cases that led Festinger to form the theory of cognitive dissonance. =Harold Camping's 2011 end times prediction= American Christian radio host Harold Camping claimed that the Rapture and Judgment Day would take place on May 21, 2011, and that the end of the world would take place five months later on October 21, 2011, based on adding the 153 fish of John 20 to May 21. Camping, who was then president of the Family Radio Christian network, claimed the Bible as his source and said May 21 would be the date of the Rapture and the day of judgment \\"beyond the shadow of a doubt\\". Camping suggested that it would occur at 6 pm local time, with the Rapture sweeping the globe time zone by time zone, while some of his supporters claimed that around 200 million people (approximately 3% of the world's population) would be \\"raptured\\". Camping had previously claimed that the Rapture would occur in September 1994. Following the failure of the prediction, media attention shifted to the response from Camping and his followers. On May 23, Camping amended that May 21 had been a \\"spiritual\\" day of judgment, and that the physical Rapture would occur on October 21, 2011, simultaneously with the destruction of the universe by God.Radio host says Rapture actually coming in October ‚Äì Globe and Mail. May 23, 2011. Retrieved May 23, 2011. However, on October 16, Camping admitted to an interviewer that he did not know when the end would come.

Career break After a four-year absence since the release of the Saint Vox album, a message from Villalon was posted on her fansite, \\"Jade Valerie Nation,\\" in January 2015 saying, \\"First and foremost I've been focusing on family. I've been spending much needed and missed time with my loved ones. I also got married to someone wonderful and I had a gorgeous baby girl. I feel really lucky and grateful for this chapter in my life and I'm taking the time to enjoy it and learn from it. \\"Many artists take a few years to regroup between albums but I had never done that. I had been recording, writing, touring and promoting albums for 11 years straight! \\"I have really missed making albums for myself but after all the drama that ensued after Geo and I parted ways with our business manager (HS) I felt like I owed it to the fans who love and buy my albums to take some space and make something great for them. \\"I've had the privilege to spend the last years also doing a lot of writing for other recording artists and TV shows in Los Angeles and mainly in Nashville. It's been awesome to make music in other genre's that I love especially country. \\"I know some strange demo's got leaked and some snippets from small shows so it was confusing to figure out what I have been up to. People have asked me why I haven't put things on youtube or posted them, and the reason is normally you keep that kind of stuff confidential for the artists or projects that you are working with. I've also been performing and trying new stuff out ( I dare you to find it on youtube! hint country ) and basically just being an artist. \\"Geo and I have remained close friends, and obviously we have a long history. We have also been collaborating for some of his artists and others, as you are now hearing on Symphobia. We will still do music together in the future for me, for others, for anything because we both love making music. \\"So yes I am still here, still singing, still writing, and still listening and reading what you have to say! Don't worry I am not done yet! Thanks for all the years of support you given me. I don't ever take it for granted, and there isn't a day that goes by that I don't think of the fans who brought me to where I am today.\\" Return to Sweetbox In 2020, GEO and Jade both came back to Sweetbox, joined by new member, Saint Viv.

He was CEO of Procter & Gamble India and later managing director, Procter & Gamble Worldwide (Strategic Planning). At age 50, he took early retirement to become a full- time writer. He is a regular columnist for The Times of India and five Indian language newspapers in Hindi, Telugu, Marathi, Tamil, and Gujarati.The five Indian language newspapers are Dainik Bhaskar (Hindi), Eenadu (Telugu), Lokmat (Marathi), Hindu (Tamil), Divya Bhaskar (Gujarati).

Early life  Gurcharan Das was born in Lyallpur, British India (now Faisalabad, Pakistan) in a middle-class family. His father was an engineer with the government of Punjab. The family lived in Lahore at the time of the partition of India in August 1947 when they had to flee for their lives. They arrived as refugees in Shimla, and this is where the young boy grew up. His father was a passionate mystic and mediated for many hours a day and the boy was raised in an atmosphere charged with Bhakti mysticism. His partially autobiographical novel, A Fine Family, sheds some light on his early life.A Fine Family, Penguin Books India: Delhi, 1990. In 1952, the family moved to Bhakra Nangal; in 1953, to Delhi, where he went to Modern School. In 1955, his father was transferred to Washington DC, to represent India in talks with Pakistan on the sharing of the waters of the rivers of the Punjab, mediated by the World Bank. He went to high school in Washington D.C. In 1959, he won a scholarship to Harvard University.The Washington Post, 'Boy on Visit from India Stays to Excel at School, 3 June 1959. He graduated from Harvard in 1963 with honours in Philosophy, Politics, and Economics. He wrote his senior thesis under the political philosopher, John Rawls, who had a great influence on his life. Harvard later elected him to Phi Beta Kappa for \\"high attainments in liberal scholarship.\\"  Corporate career  Instead of accepting a fellowship to do a doctorate in philosophy at the University of Oxford, Gurcharan Das returned home to India. Just before coming back, Das wrote in a letter to his mother that he \\"just could not imagine living the rest of my life at that stratosphere of abstract thought.\\"Letter of Gurcharan Das to his mother dated August 1963. While waiting to decide what he wanted to do with his life, he got a job as a trainee in a company that made Vick Vaporub. He soon discovered that he liked the rough and tumble of the business life \\"and like the man who came to dinner, I stayed on.\\"The Statesman, New Delhi, 22 July 1970.

At the end of 1994, after a 30-year career in six countries, he took early retirement to become a full-time writer. Before leaving he wrote, 'Local Memoirs of a Global Manager in Harvard Business Review.Harvard Business Review, March‚ÄìApril 1993  Literary career and books  Gurcharan Das began his writing career as a \\"weekend writer\\". In his twenties, he wrote three plays, which were published together as an anthology, titled Three English Plays, by Oxford University Press in 2001 and later re-published as Three Plays by Penguin India in 2011. At age 23, he wrote his first play, Larins Sahib, which won the Sultan Padamsee Prize in 1968.The Times of India, 24 November 1968 It was produced by the Theatre Group in Bombay in 1969, published by Oxford University Press in the UK in 1970, and later presented at the Edinburgh Festival in 1991.Indian Express, 'Edinburgh Bound', 8 October 1991 A historical play about the British in India, it is set during the confused period after the death of Ranjit Singh in the Punjab with a focus on an unusual Englishman in India named Henry Lawrence. His second play, Mira‚Äîa \\"rite of Krishna for five actor-dancers\\" ‚Äì explores what it means for a human being to become a saint through the story of Mirabai, the sixteen- century Rajput princess-poet. It premiered at the La Mama Theatre in 1970 to much critical acclaim. Clive Barnes of the New York Times wrote, \\"Remarkable in the way it combines Indian legend with the sophistication of Western total theater‚Ä¶Mira has the quality of a dream ritual.\\"Clive Barnes, 'Mira': La Mama's India Play', The New York Times, 3 June 1970. It was produced in Bombay by Alaque Padmsee and was called \\"a major artistic achievement of immense merit and supreme significance to the re-blossoming of theatre in India\\" The Times of India, Bombay, 'Mira; Major Artistic Achievement', 8 March 1972. He wrote a third play also in his twenties. 9 Jakhoo Hill is set in the autumn of 1962 in Shimla. \\"During the autumn of discontent of a once-wealthy family [9 Jakhoo Hill] broods over better days‚Ä¶on the hold that mothers have over their sons‚Ä¶a family coming down in the world‚Ä¶remnants of the Raj, disillusionment with politics. Sixties? The script is here and now.\\"India Today, Gurcharan Das' 9 Jakhoo Hill, 19 March 2001 It has been performed in major Indian cities. In the midst of a corporate career in his thirties, Gurcharan Das also wrote a novel, A Fine Family, which follows the stories of several generations of a Punjabi family, beginning with the Partition. It was published by Penguin in 1990. The Hindu called it \\"a worthy addition to the body of fiction that deals with the anguish and bitter memories of one of the most sorrowful disasters in recorded history,\\"K.C. Nambiar, The Hindu, Trauma of Partition and Emergency, 24 July 1990 and India Today said, \\"The canvas is broad and the scope enormous. But Das' success lies in making people ordinary without making them dull‚Ä¶A Fine Family shines because of its simplicity.\\"Salil Tripathi, India Today, 15 March 1990 Gurcharan Das turned to non-fiction when he became a full-time writer in 1995 and began to write a regular column in the Times of India. He travelled for four months in 1995 and out these travels emerged a 20-page cover essay, 'A Million Reformers' about how the reforms were changing India.'The cover essay appeared in Business World in its 27 December 1995 ‚Äì 7 January 1996 issue. From this essay grew his first major non-fiction work, India Unbound, the story of the economic and social transformation of India from Independence to the global information age.First published in English by Penguin Random House in 2000, India Unbound was also published in the US by Knopf and in the UK by Profile Books in 2002. The book has been translated into many languages. Amartya Sen called it, \\"a wonderful book‚Ä¶a great mixture of memoir, economic analysis, social investigation, political scrutiny and managerial outlook thrown into an understanding of India.\\"Talk at the Nehru Centre, London, 7 May 2002. The New York Times wrote, \\"Something tremendous is happening in India, and Das, with his keen eye and often elegant prose, has his finger firmly on the pulse of the transformation.\\"The New York Times, book review on India Unbound, 25 March 2001. The book has been published in many languages and filmed by BBC,BBC Television: India Business Report: The Road Ahead, 9 March 2003, 11 am and 10 pm India Unbound was followed in 2002 by a book of essays, The Elephant Paradigm: India wrestles with change. It recounted the \\"story of an ancient civilization's reawakening to the spirit and potential of its youth\\", arguing that \\"India may not roar like the Asian tigers, it will advance like a wise elephant, moving steadily but surely.\\"Gurcharan Das, The Elephant Paradigm: India Wrestles with Change, 2002, Penguin India A decade later, Gurcharan Das returned to the theme of India's rise, confessing wryly that 'India grows at night when the government sleeps'. In India Grows at Night: A liberal case for a strong state, he argued that India's is a story of private success and public failure and it is rising despite the state. In this book, which was rated as one of the best books of 2013 by London's Financial Times, he offers significant governance reforms so that 'India can grow during the day.' 'Books of the Year', Financial Times, London, 29 November 2013, 27 June 2013. Prosperity had, indeed, begun to spread in India, as India Unbound predicted, but so had corruption and Gurcharan Das turned to the ancient epic, Mahabharata, to understand role of dharma or 'doing the right thing' in our lives in The Difficulty of Being Good: On the subtle art of dharma.Published by Allen Lane through Penguin India, Delhi 2009; Oxford University Press, New York 2009 \\"It is one of the best things I have read about the contribution of great literature to ethical thought,\\" said Martha Nussbaum. Having written about artha and dharma, Gurcharan Das turned to the third aim of life in Kama: The Riddle of Desire, and discovered that if dharma is 'our duty to others', kama is a 'duty to ourselves'.Gurcharan Das, Kama: The Riddle of Desire, first published in Allen Lane by Penguin Random House India, Delhi, 2018. The dilemma often is whether to betray the other or oneself. This fictional memoir narrates a philosophical journey \\"creating a sense of enchantment, using memory as a device to summon the many forms of desire that play upon the mind [thus] entering an imagined world of beauty.\\"Geeta Doctor, in The Hindu, 11 November 2018. Gurcharan Das is also general editor of a fifteen-volume series, The Story of Indian Business (Penguin), which \\"mines great ideas in business and economics that have shaped commerce in the bazaars and high seas of the Indian Ocean. Leading scholars examine historical texts, inscriptions and records and interpret them in a lively, sharp authoritative manner. Beginning with the ancient Arthashastra: The Science of Wealth, it narrates tales of trade over two thousand years, including the story of The East India Company: The World's Most Powerful Corporation, and The Marwaris.\\"The Story Of Indian Business, edited by Gurcharan Das, various authors, Penguin Random House India, Delhi, 2012 ‚Äì 2018  Reviews  Reviews related to the non-fiction and fiction books of Gurcharan Das.

The village occupies the entirety of Aguni Island. As of 2013, the village had an estimated population of 772 and a population density of 100 persons per km¬≤. The total area is . Geography Interior of Aguni Island Aguni is located in the East China Sea. The village sits northwest of Naha, Okinawa, the prefectural capital of Okinawa on Okinawa Island. Aguni Island spans from north to south and from east to west. Aguni is a low-lying island with its highest point only reaching . Aguni faces Tonaki and the Kerama Islands to the south and Kume Island to the southwest. The town consists of three districts: Hama, Higashi, and Nishi. History Aguni was settled from earliest period in the history of the Ryukyu Islands. The island has remains of both shell middens and gusuku castle remains. Aguni appears in the earliest written record as Awaguni, and was placed under the administration of Kume Island. Aguni was home to merchants and mariners in the sailing period of the Ryukyu Kingdom. After the end of the Ryukyu Kingdom, and the abolition of the han system in Japan in 1879, Aguni became part of Okinawa Prefecture. In 1880 the population of Aguni stood at 3,099 residents, and reached 4,966 by 1903. The island saw discontent and violent protest by peasants between 1880 and 1881, which were ultimately suppressed by the authorities on Kume Island. The Village of Aguni was formally established in 1908 Aguni was invaded by the United States as part of the Battle of Okinawa during World War II. The island, along with the Kerama Islands, was overtaken by Allied forces after aerial and naval bombardment on March 23, 1945. Civil administration of the village ended after the American invasion. 30 leaders from the village were appointed to keep order on the island. The mayor of Aguni was reappointed in 1946 by the American administration, and mayoral and village council elections resumed in 1948. The population of Aguni decreased rapidly after World War II, due to both an aging population and the emigration of residents from the island. The village had 960 residents in 2000, and at present has fallen to 772. Government Aguni is administered from the village hall in the Higashi district. The Uruma City Council consists of 7 members who serve a four-year term, and are led by a chairperson (Fumio Tamayose) and vice-chairperson (Masanori Miyasato) of the council. Transportation Aguni Airport =Air= Aguni is connected to Okinawa Island via Aguni Airport. The airport was constructed in 1978 after the reversion of Okinawa Prefecture to Japan. Aguni can be reached from Naha in only 20 minutes. =Ferry= Aguni is connected to the main island of Okinawa by ferry between the Port of Aguni and the Port of Tomari in Naha. The Port of Aguni came under the administration of Okinawa Prefecture in 1972 after the reversion of the prefecture to Japan. Ferry service between Aguni and Naha takes approximately two hours.

Longer delays were intended to disrupt salvage and other activities, to spread terror in areas where there could still be live bombs and to attack bomb disposal workers. Such bombs were used widely by British, American, and German forces during World War II. One use was to hamper and delay reconstruction and repair of bombed airfields. Towards the end of the war both British and German bombs became de facto mines, with a secondary fuze mechanism activated by light tilting or magnets to kill those trying to disarm them.

The previous Lancer Evolution series were homologated for the Group A class, and their competitiveness against World Rally Cars from other manufacturers was therefore limited. WRC The Lancer Evolution WRC is powered by the same 1996 cc 4G63 engine that has been used in its sports and rally cars since the 1980s, in this iteration producing at 5500 rpm and at 3500 rpm. The car debuted at the 2001 Rallye Sanremo, after a relatively short development (Ralliart could not introduce the Lancer WRC later because of a contract they made with the FIA in 1999, which allowed them to run the old specification Lancers). The model was based on the then-new eighth generation Cedia model, of which the road-going Evolution VII is based on. The WRC rules allowed more freedom in most areas of the car, therefore the engineers were able to make changes to the car they couldn't do to the older Group A Lancers. These changes included modifications to the engine and its surroundings (lighter internal parts, more rearward tilt to optimize the front weight distribution, new turbo and new exhaust system), but the most significant change was made to the suspensions: now both the front and rear suspensions were MacPhersons, and also bigger wheel arches were implanted, allowing more suspension travel. However, the drivetrain remained the same as before, and when Tommi M√§kinen left the team at the end of 2001, the new drivers couldn't get on with this special transmission, which required an aggressive left-foot braking approach. The original Evo WRC (sometimes referred to as Step1) was replaced with the Step2 from 2002 Finland onwards. WRC2/Step2 The Lancer Evolution WRC2 (also called the Step2) is also powered by the 4G63, also producing at 5500 rpm and at 3500 rpm. It is mated to a 6-speed INVECS-type sequential transmission via a triple-plate carbon clutch and distributes power to all four wheels via front-, centre- and rear- active differentials. The car's suspension is independent, with MacPherson struts and coil springs at each corner. The brakes are vented discs clamped by 6-piston calipers at the front, and 4-piston calipers at the rear. The car debuted at the 2002 Rally Finland. Changes to the Evo WRC included better weight distribution and lower centre of gravity, different front airdam to increase airflow to the radiators, a new intercooler, new exhaust manifold and a single-scroll turbocharger, and new engine parts (lightened crankshaft, flywheel and other rotating parts). The suspension was also updated to offer more travel and rigidity, and slight changes were also made to the transmission (to suit more the very different driving style of McRae and Delecour). Mitsubishi pulled out of the WRC at the end of 2002, but in 2003 they used this car for developmental purposes on some WRC events, with McRae clinching a 6th place at the 2003 Rally New Zealand. WRC04 In 2004, Mitsubishi returned to the WRC with the Lancer WRC04, featuring over 6000 changes compared to the Step2 used in 2002 and 2003. The car continued with the 4G63 engine, mounted to a 5-speed semi-automatic transmission (at the start of the season, Mitsubishi used a completely passive transmission before switching to active differentials) and a new all-wheel drive system co-developed by Ricardo Consulting Engineers and Mitsubishi Motors Motorsports (MMSP). The bodywork was subjected to extensive aerodynamic testing at the Lola Cars wind tunnel (this resulted in the completely new front air dam, the new wheel arches and the interesting, shopping trolley handle-like rear spoiler). The front brakes were upgraded to 8-piston calipers clamping discs. The car suffered from frustrating mechanical and electrical glitches (in New Zealand, both cars retired on the start line of the first stage due to electrical issues). Mitsubishi did not complete a full 2004 season, since they continued to develop and test the car outside the WRC, but with little result in 2004; however, the car had some good moments and seemed to be promising after more development. The lead Lancer WRC04 in the 2004 World Rally Championship was driven by ex-Peugeot driver Gilles Panizzi, with his brother Herv√© as co-driver. The other pairings were Gianluigi Galli with Guido D'Amore, Daniel Sol√° with Xavier Amigo, and Kristian Sohlberg with Kaj Lindstrom. WRC05 The Lancer WRC05 saw no significant changes, but the car's width was increased by due to a change in the WRC regulations. The engine remained the same, but the ECU and the turbo wastegate were updated. Aerodynamic alterations to the bodywork were introduced to improve stability and to accommodate the new, wider track, while suspension links and driveshafts were lengthened. Steering-mounted gearshift paddles were also introduced, and longer ratios were adopted for first, third and fourth gears. The car showed great promise, since Panizzi took 3rd place in Monte Carlo, and ex-Peugeot man Rovanpera was fast on gravel events, eventually clinching a 2nd place at the last round in Australia, but soon after that Mitsubishi pulled out of the WRC, and only returned through Ralliart UK, who took over the cars and supported private and semi-works entries in 2006 and 2007. At 2006 Rally Sweden, local driver Daniel Carlsson made podium with a 3rd place in the V√§rmland forests, in such an entry. Daniel battled for seconds, just into finish line, with team mate Gigi Galli, who settled for fourth spot. To maintain some competitiveness for customer uses of the car, MML Sports (formerly Ralliart UK) made some development to the car, including an updated suspension, transmission and other, minor changes. This resulted in the car (sometimes called the WRC07) being faster than the WRC05 by a massive 0.5sec/km.

By both traffic and land area, it is the largest airport in Hokkaid≈ç. It is adjacent to Chitose Air Base, a Japan Air Self-Defense Force base which houses F-15 Eagle fighter jets, the Japanese Air Force One government aircraft and a number of smaller emergency response aircraft and helicopters. Chitose and New Chitose have separate runways but are interconnected by taxiways, and aircraft at either facility can enter the other by ground if permitted; the runways at Chitose are occasionally used to relieve runway closures at New Chitose due to winter weather. JASDF provides air traffic control for both facilities. As of 2018, New Chitose Airport was the fifth-busiest airport in Japan, and ranked 64th in the world in terms of passengers carried. The Sapporo‚ÄìTokyo Haneda route is the second busiest air route in the world, with 9.7 million passengers carried in 2018. History New Chitose opened in July 1988 to replace the adjacent Chitose Airport, a joint-use facility which had served passenger flights since 1963 http://www.new-chitose- airport.jp/en/business/airport/passengers/since_opening.html. The airport's IATA airport code was originally SPK. This code was later adopted as a city code to refer to both New Chitose and the smaller Okadama Airport in central Sapporo, which handles commuter flights within Hokkaido. New Chitose became Japan's first 24-hour airport in 1994. Services between 10 PM and 7 AM are currently limited to six flights per day due to noise alleviation concerns. Four of these slots are currently used by passenger flights to Tokyo while the other two are used by cargo flights. New Chitose previously had long-haul service to Amsterdam (KLM, 1997‚Äì2002), Cairns (Qantas, 1992‚Äì1998 and 2004‚Äì2007) and Honolulu (JALWays, 1992‚Äì2003, Hawaiian Airlines since 2012). Service to Europe resumed when Finnair launched a new weekly flight to Helsinki from 15th December 2019. International services are mainly for transporting tourists from the rest of Asia and for sightseeing and skiing. The area surrounding gates 0 through 2, on the north end of the main terminal, was a sterile area for international flights until the international terminal opened for service on March 26, 2010. The airport was upgraded with additional private aircraft handling facilities for the 34th G8 summit, held in Hokkaido in 2008. Due to the airport's sharing of air traffic control with Chitose Air Base, daytime civil operations are limited to 32 takeoffs and landings per hour, and operations by certain foreign aircraft (including Chinese and Russian aircraft) are prohibited on Mondays and Thursdays. These restrictions were scheduled to be eased in March 2017. A 2nd terminal is being built roughly doubling the existing terminal and capacity, scheduled to be complete by August 2019.

This property is usually abbreviated as i.i.d. or iid or IID. Herein, i.i.d. is used, because it is the most prevalent. In machine learning theory, i.i.d. assumption is often made for training datasets to imply that all samples stem from the same generative process and that the generative process is assumed to have no memory of past generated samples. Introduction In statistics, it is commonly assumed that observations in a sample are effectively i.i.d.. The assumption (or requirement) that observations be i.i.d. tends to simplify the underlying mathematics of many statistical methods (see mathematical statistics and statistical theory). In practical applications of statistical modeling, however, the assumption may or may not be realistic. (¬ß8). To partially test how realistic the assumption is on a given data set, the correlation can be computed, lag plots drawn or turning point test performed. The generalization of exchangeable random variables is often sufficient and more easily met. The i.i.d. assumption is important in the classical form of the central limit theorem, which states that the probability distribution of the sum (or average) of i.i.d. variables with finite variance approaches a normal distribution. Often the i.i.d. assumption arises in the context of sequences of random variables. Then \\"independent and identically distributed\\" implies that an element in the sequence is independent of the random variables that came before it. In this way, an i.i.d. sequence is different from a Markov sequence, where the probability distribution for the nth random variable is a function of the previous random variable in the sequence (for a first order Markov sequence). An i.i.d. sequence does not imply the probabilities for all elements of the sample space or event space must be the same. For example, repeated throws of loaded dice will produce a sequence that is i.i.d., despite the outcomes being biased. Definition =Definition for two random variables= Suppose that the random variables X and Y are defined to assume values in I \\\\subseteq \\\\mathbb{R}. Let F_X(x) = \\\\operatorname{P}(X\\\\leq x) and F_Y(y) = \\\\operatorname{P}(Y\\\\leq y) be the cumulative distribution functions of X and Y, respectively, and denote their joint cumulative distribution function by F_{X,Y}(x,y) = \\\\operatorname{P}(X\\\\leq x \\\\land Y\\\\leq y). Two random variables X and Y are identically distributed if and only if F_X(x)=F_Y(x) \\\\, \\\\forall x \\\\in I. Two random variables X and Y are independent if and only if F_{X,Y}(x,y) = F_{X}(x) \\\\cdot F_{Y}(y) \\\\, \\\\forall x,y \\\\in I. (See further .) Two random variables X and Y are i.i.d. if they are independent and identically distributed, i.e. if and only if =Definition for more than two random variables= The definition extends naturally to more than two random variables. We say that n random variables X_1,\\\\ldots,X_n are i.i.d. if they are independent (see further Independence (probability theory)#More than two random variables) and identically distributed, i.e. if and only if where F_{X_1,\\\\ldots,X_n}(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n) = \\\\operatorname{P}(X_1\\\\leq x_1 \\\\land \\\\ldots \\\\land X_n\\\\leq x_n) denotes the joint cumulative distribution function of X_1,\\\\ldots,X_n. Examples The following are examples or applications of i.i.d. random variables: * A sequence of outcomes of spins of a fair or unfair roulette wheel is i.i.d. One implication of this is that if the roulette ball lands on \\"red\\", for example, 20 times in a row, the next spin is no more or less likely to be \\"black\\" than on any other spin (see the Gambler's fallacy). * A sequence of fair or loaded dice rolls is i.i.d. * A sequence of fair or unfair coin flips is i.i.d. * In signal processing and image processing the notion of transformation to i.i.d. implies two specifications, the \\"i.d.\\" (i.d. = identically distributed) part and the \\"i.\\" (i. = independent) part:  (i.d.) the signal level must be balanced on the time axis;  (i.) the signal spectrum must be flattened, i.e. transformed by filtering (such as deconvolution) to a white noise signal (i.e. a signal where all frequencies are equally present). The following examples data samples do not satisfy i.i.d. assumption: * A medical dataset where multiple samples are taken from multiple patients, it is very likely that samples from same patients may be correlated. * Samples drawn from time dependent processes, for example, year- wise census data. Generalizations Many results that were first proven under the assumption that the random variables are i.i.d. have been shown to be true even under a weaker distributional assumption. =Exchangeable random variables= The most general notion which shares the main properties of i.i.d. variables are exchangeable random variables, introduced by Bruno de Finetti. Exchangeability means that while variables may not be independent, future ones behave like past ones ‚Äì formally, any value of a finite sequence is as likely as any permutation of those values ‚Äì the joint probability distribution is invariant under the symmetric group. This provides a useful generalization ‚Äì for example, sampling without replacement is not independent, but is exchangeable. =L√©vy process= In stochastic calculus, i.i.d. variables are thought of as a discrete time L√©vy process: each variable gives how much one changes from one time to another. For example, a sequence of Bernoulli trials is interpreted as the Bernoulli process. One may generalize this to include continuous time L√©vy processes, and many L√©vy processes can be seen as limits of i.i.d. variables‚Äîfor instance, the Wiener process is the limit of the Bernoulli process.

The title comes from the poem \\"Harlem\\" (also known as \\"A Dream Deferred\\") by Langston Hughes. The story tells of a black family's experiences in south Chicago, as they attempt to improve their financial circumstances with an insurance payout following the death of the father. The New York Drama Critics' Circle named it the best play of 1959, and in recent years publications such as The Independent and Time Out have listed it among the best plays ever written.  Plot Walter and Ruth Younger, their son Travis, along with Walter's mother Lena (Mama) and Walter's sister Beneatha, live in poverty in a dilapidated two-bedroom apartment on Chicago's south side. Walter is barely making a living as a limousine driver. Though Ruth is content with their lot, Walter is not and desperately wishes to become wealthy. His plan is to invest in a liquor store in partnership with Willy and Bobo, his street- smart acquaintances. At the beginning of the play, Walter and Beneatha's father has recently died, and Mama (Lena) is waiting for a life insurance check for $10,000. Walter has a sense of entitlement to the money, but Mama has religious objections to alcohol, and Beneatha has to remind him it is Mama's call how to spend it. Eventually, Mama puts some of the money down on a new house, choosing an all-white neighborhood over a black one for the practical reason that it happens to be much cheaper. Later she relents and gives the rest of the money to Walter to invest with the provision that he reserve $3,000 for Beneatha's education. Walter gives all of the money to Willy, who absconds with it, depriving Walter and Beneatha of their dreams, though not the Youngers of their new home. Meanwhile, Karl Lindner, a white representative of the neighborhood they plan to move to, makes a generous offer to buy them out. He wishes to avoid neighborhood tensions over the interracial population, which to the three women's horror Walter prepares to accept as a solution to their financial setback. Lena says that while money was something they try to work for, they should never take it if it was a person's way of telling them they weren't fit to walk the same earth as they. Meanwhile, Beneatha's character and direction in life are being defined for us by two different men: her wealthy and educated boyfriend George Murchison, and Joseph Asagai. Neither man is actively involved in the Youngers' financial ups and downs. George represents the \\"fully assimilated black man\\" who denies his African heritage with a \\"smarter than thou\\" attitude, which Beneatha finds disgusting, while dismissively mocking Walter's lack of money and education. Joseph patiently teaches Beneatha about her African heritage; he gives her thoughtfully useful gifts from Africa while pointing out she is unwittingly assimilating herself into white ways. She straightens her hair, for example, which he characterizes as \\"mutilation\\". When Beneatha becomes distraught at the loss of the money, she is scolded by Joseph for her materialism. She eventually accepts his point of view that things will get better with a lot of effort, along with his proposal of marriage and his invitation to move with him to Nigeria to practice medicine. Walter is oblivious to the stark contrast between George and Joseph: his pursuit of wealth can be attained only by liberating himself from Joseph's culture, to which he attributes his poverty, and by rising to George's level, wherein he sees his salvation. Walter redeems himself and black pride at the end by changing his mind and not accepting the buyout offer, stating that the family is proud of who they are and will try to be good neighbors. The play closes with the family leaving for their new home but uncertain future. The character Mrs. Johnson and a few scenes were cut from the Broadway performance and in reproductions due to time constraints. Mrs. Johnson is the Younger family's nosy and loud neighbor. She cannot understand how the family can consider moving to a white neighborhood and jokes that she will probably read in the newspaper in a month that they have been killed in a bombing. Her lines are employed as comic relief, but Hansberry also uses this scene to mock those who are too scared to stand up for their rights. In the introduction by Robert B. Nemiroff, he writes that the scene is included in print because it draws attention away from a seemingly happy ending to a more violent reality inspired by Hansberry's own experiences. Litigation Experiences in this play echo a lawsuit (Hansberry v. Lee, 311 U.S. 32 (1940)), to which the playwright Lorraine Hansberry's family was a party when they fought to have their day in court because a previous class action about racially motivated restrictive covenants (Burke v. Kleiman, 277 Ill. App. 519 (1934)) had been similar to their situation. This case was heard prior to the passage of the Fair Housing Act (Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968), which prohibited discrimination in housing and created the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity. The Hansberry family won their right to be heard as a matter of due process of law in relation to the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Supreme Court held that the Hansberry defendants were not bound by the Burke decision because the class of defendants in the respective cases had conflicting goals, and thus could not be considered to be the same class. The plaintiff in the first action in 1934 was Olive Ida Burke, who brought the suit on behalf of a property owners' association to enforce racial restrictions. Her husband, James Burke, later sold a house to Carl Hansberry (Lorraine's father) when he changed his mind about the validity of the covenant. Mr. Burke's decision may have been motivated by the changing demographics of the neighborhood, but it was also influenced by the Depression. The demand for houses was so low among white buyers that Mr. Hansberry may have been the only prospective purchaser available.Kamp, Allen R. \\"The History Behind Hansberry v. Lee,\\" 20 U.S. Davis L. Rev. 481 (1987). Lorraine reflects upon the litigation in her book To Be Young, Gifted, and Black: > \\"Twenty-five years ago, [my father] spent a small personal fortune, his > considerable talents, and many years of his life fighting, in association > with NAACP attorneys, Chicago‚Äôs ‚Äòrestrictive covenants‚Äô in one of this > nation's ugliest ghettos. That fight also required our family to occupy > disputed property in a hellishly hostile ‚Äòwhite neighborhood‚Äô in which > literally howling mobs surrounded our house. ... My memories of this > ‚Äòcorrect‚Äô way of fighting white supremacy in America include being spat at, > cursed and pummeled in the daily trek to and from school. And I also > remember my desperate and courageous mother, patrolling our household all > night with a loaded German Luger (pistol), doggedly guarding her four > children, while my father fought the respectable part of the battle in the > Washington court.\\" The Hansberry house, a red-brick three-flat at 6140 S. Rhodes in Washington Park that they bought in 1937, was given landmark status by the Chicago City Council's Committee on Historical Landmarks Preservation in 2010. Production and reception Scene from the play. alt=Scene from the play. Ruby Dee as Ruth, Claudia McNeil as Lena, Glynn Turman as Travis, Sidney Poitier as Walter, and John Fiedler as Karl Lindner. With a cast in which all but one character is black, A Raisin in the Sun was considered a risky investment, and it took over a year for producer Philip Rose to raise enough money to launch it. There was disagreement with how it should be played, with focus on the mother or focus on the son. When the play hit New York, Poitier played it with the focus on the son and found not only his calling but also an audience enthralled. After touring to positive reviews, the play premiered on Broadway at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre on March 11, 1959. It transferred to the Belasco Theatre on October 19, 1959, and closed on June 25, 1960, after 530 total performances. Directed by Lloyd Richards, the cast comprised: *Sidney Poitier ‚Äì Walter Lee Younger *Ruby Dee ‚Äì Ruth Younger *Ivan Dixon ‚Äì Joseph Asagai *Lonne Elder III ‚Äì Bobo *John Fiedler ‚Äì Karl Lindner *Louis Gossett ‚Äì George Murchison *Claudia McNeil ‚Äì Lena Younger *Diana Sands ‚Äì Beneatha Younger *Glynn Turman ‚Äì Travis Younger *Ed Hall ‚Äì moving man *Douglas Turner ‚Äì moving man Ossie Davis later took over as Walter Lee Younger, and Frances Williams as Lena Younger. Waiting for the curtain to rise on opening night, Hansberry and producer Rose did not expect the play to be a success, for it had already received mixed reviews from a preview audience the night before. Though it won popular and critical acclaim, reviewers argued about whether the play was \\"universal\\" or particular to black experience. It was then produced on tour. A Raisin in the Sun was the first play written by a black woman to be produced on Broadway, as well as the first with a black director, Mr. Richards.Corley, Cheryl, \\"'A Raisin in the Sun', Present at the Creation\\" , National Public Radio, March 11, 2002. Hansberry noted that her play introduced details of black life to the overwhelmingly white Broadway audiences, while director Richards observed that it was the first play to which large numbers of black people were drawn. Frank Rich, writing in The New York Times in 1983, stated that A Raisin in the Sun \\"changed American theater forever\\". In 2016, Claire Brennan wrote in The Guardian that \\"The power and craft of the writing make A Raisin in the Sun as moving today as it was then.\\" Review of a revival in Sheffield, England.

Thermal ionization is used to make simple ion sources, for mass spectrometry and for generating ion beams. Thermal ionization has seen extensive use in determining atomic weights, in addition to being used in many geological/nuclear applications. Physics Surface ionization effect in a vaporized cesium atom at 1500 K, calculated using a grand canonical ensemble. Y-axis: average number of electrons on the atom; the atom is neutral when it has 55 electrons. X-axis: energy variable (equal to the surface work function) dependent on electron chemical potential and electrostatic potential . The likelihood of ionization is a function of the filament temperature, the work function of the filament substrate and the ionization energy of the element. This is summarised in the Saha-Langmuir equation: :\\\\frac{n_+}{n_0} = \\\\frac{g_+}{g_0} \\\\exp \\\\Bigg(\\\\frac{W-\\\\Delta E_I}{kT}\\\\Bigg) where ::\\\\frac{n_+}{n_0} = ratio of ion number density to neutral number density ::\\\\frac{g_+}{g_0} = ratio of statistical weights (degeneracy) of ionic (g_+) and neutral (g_0) states ::e = electron charge ::W = work function of surface ::\\\\Delta E_I = ionization energy of desorbed element ::k = Boltzmann's constant ::T = surface temperature Negative ionization can also occur for elements with a large electron affinity \\\\Delta E_A against a surface of low work function. Thermal ionization mass spectrometry One application of thermal ionization is thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS). In thermal ionization mass spectrometry, a chemically purified material is placed onto a filament which is then heated to high temperatures to cause some of the material to be ionized as it is thermally desorbed (boiled off) the hot filament. Filaments are generally flat pieces of metal around 1-2mm wide, 0.1mm thick, bent into an upside-down U shape and attached to two contacts that supply a current. This method is widely used in radiometric dating, where the sample is ionized under vacuum. The ions being produced at the filament are focussed into an ion beam and then passed through a magnetic field to separate them by mass. The relative abundances of different isotopes can then be measured, yielding isotope ratios. When these isotope ratios are measured by TIMS, mass-dependent fractionation occurs as species are emitted by the hot filament. Fractionation occurs due to the excitation of the sample and therefore must be corrected for accurate measurement of the isotope ratio.Dickin, A.P., 2005. Radiogenic Isotope Geology 2nd ed. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. pp. 21-22 There are several advantages of the TIMS method. It has a simple design, is less expensive than other mass spectrometers, and produces stable ion emissions. It requires a stable power supply, and is suitable for species with a low ionization energy, such as strontium and lead. The disadvantages of this method stem from the maximum temperature achieved in thermal ionization. The hot filament reaches a temperature of less than 2500 ¬∞C, leading to the inability to create atomic ions of species with a high ionization energy, such as osmium and tungsten. Although the TIMS method can create molecular ions instead in this case, species with high ionization energy can be analyzed more effectively with MC-ICP-MS.

Richard, Duke of York, and his allies, the Neville earls of Salisbury and Warwick, defeated a royal army commanded by Edmund Beaufort, Duke of Somerset, who was killed. With King Henry VI captured, a subsequent parliament appointed Richard of York Lord Protector. Background The incapacitation of Henry VI by mental illness in 1454 had led to the recall to court of Richard of York, his closest adult relative. Back in 1447, York had been assigned as Lieutenant of Ireland, basically in exile away from England, while his long time rival, Edmund Beaufort, Duke of Somerset, and favorite of the king, had been given the charge of the Lieutenancy of France. After Somerset's own failure in France, York unexpectedly returned to London with significant support not only from the nobility, most of whom saw the incompetence of Somerset's efforts in France, but also from the public. He presented himself as a champion of the law and urged the King to have Somerset tried and held accountable for his failures. He also wished to be recognised as heir presumptive to the English throne while Henry VI was childless. York formed an armed force to force the issue in 1452, and after meeting with the council of war and the King, who desperately wanted to avoid a conflict, York's demands were agreed on. York disbanded his army as a result, but was soon arrested and held prisoner for three months. An execution was avoided as the King was nervous about arousing trouble; the Duke of York was very popular and known as a man of honour. York was only released after he agreed to swear an oath at St. Paul's Cathedral that he would never again take up arms against the King. After the English army led by Sir John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, was routed in the Battle of Castillion, Henry VI suffered a complete mental breakdown and was unable to perform his royal duties. Somerset had attempted to take control of the country and sought to make himself Lord Protector. However, Somerset underestimated the Duke of York's influence and popularity, as many nobles on the council (including York's closest allies, his brother-in-law Richard Neville, Earl of Salisbury and Salisbury's son Richard, Earl of Warwick) were on York's side. And so York was given the appointment to govern England as Lord Protector and First Councillor of the realm while the king remained unfit. He used this position to move against his chief rival and express the bitterness which had accumulated over the years, and thus the Duke of Somerset was imprisoned. It was during this 14 months that the sides were clearly forming. There was conflict beyond that between the Dukes of York and Somerset; in fact, the two richest and most prominent families from the north, the Percys and Nevilles, were having their own conflicts. The Percys were, and still are to this day, the Earls of Northumberland; the Nevilles possessed both Salisbury and Warwick (received through the right of their wives) and they were one of the richest families in all England. The Nevilles were also related to the Duke of York by marriage, as the Duchess of York was Cecily Neville, the sister of the Earl of Salisbury. Much of the fighting was over land and money, but both were clearly choosing sides, the Percys for Somerset and the Nevilles for York. By Christmas of 1454, King Henry had recovered from his illness, removing the basis for York's authority. Somerset was released and restored to his former position of power. Having reconvened the court at Westminster by mid-April 1455, Henry and a select council of nobles decided to hold a great council at Leicester. York and his closest allies anticipated that Somerset would bring charges against them at this assembly. They gathered an armed retinue and marched to stop the royal party from reaching Leicester, intercepting them at St Albans. Fighting The Lancastrian army of 2,000 troops arrived at St Albans first, with Humphrey Stafford, Duke of Buckingham, in command, and proceeded to defend it by placing troops along the Tonman Ditch and at the bars in Sopwell Lane and Shropshire Lane. The reassignment of Buckingham from Somerset as Commander of the Army had been a last minute decision by Henry VI, whether by fear of Somerset's past failures, or of animosity of the Duke of York. The 7,000-strong Yorkist army arrived and camped in Keyfield to the east. Lengthy negotiations ensued with heralds moving back and forth between the rival commanders.Bertram Percy Wolffe, Henry VI, (St. Edmundsbury Press, 2001), 292. After a few hours, it was believed in the Yorkist camp that King Henry VI knew nothing of the letters of negotiation. The Duke of York had made his intentions clear: he wanted Somerset punished and then executed. In a message to Henry VI he states: This was dangerous territory that York was playing on, as he was demanding much from the King and setting the rules himself. The very act of displaying such an aggressive front to the King was treasonous, but his popularity kept York confident and supported. In a fit of uncharacteristic regency, Henry refused, replying: Map of the battle The battle superimposed over a modern street map After several hours, Richard, despairing of a peaceful solution, decided to attack. Although his army might have been unwilling to attack King Henry, the Royal Standard was not visibleSadler (2011), p.7 and might even have been negligently propped against a wall by the royal standard-bearer, the Earl of Wiltshire.Sadler (2011), p.9 The bulk of Henry's forces were surprised by the suddenness of Richard's attack; most of the army was expecting a peaceful resolution similar to the one at Blackheath in 1452. However, two Yorkist frontal assaults down the narrow streets against the barricades near St Peter's Church, which were commanded by Lord Clifford, made no headway and resulted in heavy casualties for the Yorkists. The entire battle did not last longer than a half-hour and was due mostly to the element of surprise that Warwick placed charging into the town when the Lancastrians were unprepared. Warwick led a reserve force through an unguarded part of the town's defenses, through back lanes and gardens. Suddenly the earl appeared in the market square where the main body of Henry's troops were talking and resting. There is evidence they were not yet expecting to be involved in the fighting, as many were not even wearing their helmets. Warwick charged instantly with his force, routing the Lancastrians. Somerset, knowing very well that York would never let him live, had sought refuge at the Castle Inn. When the Yorkists surrounded the building, Somerset decided to try and fight his way out. He charged onto the main street, over the bodies of the defenders, and killed four men before being struck down. The Earl of Northumberland was killed trying to get to the refuge at Castle Inn. Lord Clifford of Skipton, an ally of Percy's, was hacked to death in the main street. On the earl's orders, his archers then shot at the men surrounding the king, killing several and injuring the king and the Duke of Buckingham. The Lancastrians manning the barricades realized the Yorkists had outflanked them and, fearing an attack from behind, abandoned their positions and fled the town. Result The first battle of St Albans was relatively minor in military terms, with fewer than sixty killed from approximately 5,000 combatants . But politically this was a complete victory for York and the Nevilles: York had captured the king and restored himself to complete power, while Somerset and the Nevilles' northern rivals Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland and Lord Clifford all fell during the rout. Among the wounded were Buckingham, Thomas de Courtenay, Earl of Devon, Jasper Tudor (half-brother of the king), and Somerset's son Henry Beaufort, Earl of Dorset. The sudden attack by and bravery of the 26-year-old Earl of Warwick began his famous military career and would lead to his reputation as \\"the Kingmaker\\". The next day, York escorted King Henry back to London; York was appointed as Protector of England by the Parliament a few months later. In literature A 2005 procession at the site of the battle Shakespeare's historic play Henry VI, Part 2 ends with the conclusion of this battle. Trinity (known in the US as Margaret of Anjou), the second book of the Wars of the Roses series by Conn Iggulden, dramatises this battle as a moment of indecision for Richard of York but a powerful victory for the Neville faction in the Neville-Percy feud.

It took place at St Albans in Hertfordshire, the first battle having been fought in 1455. The army of the Yorkist faction under the Earl of Warwick attempted to bar the road to London north of the town. The rival Lancastrian army used a wide outflanking manoeuvre to take Warwick by surprise, cut him off from London, and drive his army from the field. The victors also released the feeble King Henry VI, who had been Warwick's prisoner, from his captivity. However, they ultimately failed to take advantage of their victory. Background The Wars of the Roses were fought between the supporters of two branches of the Plantagenet dynasty: the House of Lancaster, represented by the mentally unstable King Henry VI, and those of the rival House of York. Richard of York quarrelled with several of Henry's court during the late 1440s and early 1450s. He was respected as a soldier and administrator, and was believed by his own supporters to have a better claim to the throne than Henry. York and his friends finally openly rebelled in 1455. At the First Battle of St Albans, York gained a victory, but this did not resolve the causes of the conflict. After several attempts at reconciliation, fighting resumed in 1459. At the Battle of Northampton in 1460, Richard of York's nephew, the Earl of Warwick, defeated a Lancastrian army and captured King Henry, who had taken no part. York returned to London from exile in Ireland and attempted to claim the throne, but his supporters were not prepared to go so far. Instead, an agreement was reached, the Act of Accord, by which York or his heirs were to become king after Henry's death. This agreement disinherited Henry's young son, Edward of Westminster. Henry's wife, Margaret of Anjou, refused to accept the Act of Accord and took Edward to Scotland to gain support there. York's rivals and enemies meanwhile raised an army in the north of England. York and his brother-in-law, the Earl of Salisbury (Warwick's father), led an army to the north late in 1460 to counter these threats, but they drastically underestimated the Lancastrian forces. At the Battle of Wakefield, the Yorkist army was destroyed and York, Salisbury and York's second son, Edmund, Earl of Rutland, were killed in the fighting or were executed after the battle. Campaign The victorious Lancastrian army began advancing south towards London. It was led by comparatively young nobles such as the Duke of Somerset, the Earl of Northumberland, and Lord Clifford, whose fathers had been killed by York and Warwick at the First Battle of St Albans. The army contained substantial contingents from the West Country and the Scottish Borders, and largely subsisted on plunder as they marched south. The death of Richard of York left his eighteen-year-old son Edward, Earl of March, as the Yorkist claimant for the throne. He led one Yorkist army in the Welsh Marches, while Warwick led another in London and the south east. Naturally, they intended to combine their forces to face Margaret's army, but Edward was delayed by the need to confront another Lancastrian army from Wales led by Jasper Tudor and his father, Owen Tudor. On 2 February, Edward defeated Tudor's army at the Battle of Mortimer's Cross. Warwick, with the captive King Henry in his train, meanwhile moved to block Queen Margaret's army's route to London. He took up position north of St Albans astride the main road from the north (the ancient Roman road known as Watling Street), where he set up several fixed defences, including cannon and obstacles such as caltrops and pavises studded with spikes.Michael Hicks, The Wars of the Roses: 1455-1485, (Osprey, 2003), 37. Part of his defences used the ancient Belgic earthwork known as Beech Bottom Dyke. Warwick's forces were divided into three \\"Battles\\",\\"battaglia\\" in Rome were an ancestor. In English Civil War \\"battalia\\" or battle lines led to the formation in British Army as 'battalion'. as was customary at the time. He himself led the Main Battle in the centre. The Duke of Norfolk led the Forward (or Vaward) Battle on the right and Warwick's brother John Neville commanded the Rear Battle on the left. Although strong, Warwick's lines faced north only. Margaret knew of Warwick's dispositions, probably through Sir Henry Lovelace, the steward of Warwick's own household. Lovelace had been captured by the Lancastrians at Wakefield but had been spared from execution and released, and he believed he had been offered the vacant Earldom of Kent as reward for betraying Warwick.Anthony Goodman, The Wars of the Roses, (Dorset Press:New York 1981), 127. Late on 16 February, Margaret's army swerved sharply west and captured the town of Dunstable. About 200 local people under the town butcher tried to resist them, but were easily dispersed. Warwick's \\"scourers\\" (scouts and patrols and foraging parties) failed to detect this move. Battle Map of the battle From Dunstable, Margaret's forces moved south-east at night, towards St Albans. The leading Lancastrian forces attacked the town shortly after dawn. Storming up the hill past the Abbey, they were confronted by Yorkist archers in the town centre who shot at them from the house windows. This first attack was repulsed. As they regrouped at the ford across the River Ver, the Lancastrian commanders sought another route into the town. This was found and a second attack was launched along the line of Folly Lane and Catherine Street. This second attack met with no opposition and the Yorkist archers in the town were now outflanked. They continued to fight house to house however, and were not finally overcome for several hours.S. G. Shaw (1815) History of Verulam and St. Alban's Pages 65-70 Having gained the town itself, the Lancastrians turned north towards John Neville's Rear Battle, positioned on Bernards Heath. In the damp conditions,Although a number of secondary sources refer to the snow, recent research has shown that there is no reference to snow in any of the primary sources. It is now believed that this mention of snow came about from confusion with Towton, six weeks later, when snowy weather is clearly attested. See Burley et al, p73 many of the Yorkists' cannon and handguns failed to fire as their powder was dampened. Warwick found it difficult to extricate his other units from their fortifications and turn them about to face the Lancastrians, so that the Yorkist battles straggled into action one by one instead of in coordinated fashion. The Rear Battle, attempting to reinforce the defenders of the town, was engaged and dispersed. It has been suggested that the Kentish contingent in the Yorkist army under Lovelace defected at this point, causing further confusion in the Yorkist ranks,Warner (1975), p.83 although later historians suggest that Lovelace's role as 'a scapegoat'Gillingham, J. (London: 1983 repr) The Wars of the Roses London: 1983 repr. p. 126 was created by Warwick as a face-saving excuse to mask his own 'total mismanagement' of the battle. Certainly, Lovelace was not attainted after the battle of Towton. By late afternoon, the Lancastrians were attacking north-east out of St Albans to engage the Yorkist Main and Vaward battles under Warwick and Norfolk. As dusk set in (which would have been in the very early evening at this time of year and in the poor weather), Warwick realised that his men were outnumbered and increasingly demoralised, and withdrew with his remaining forces (about 4,000 men) to Chipping Norton in Oxfordshire. One annalist estimated the total dead at 2,000 men. An anonymous chronicler gave the exact figure of 1,916. Aftermath As the Yorkists retreated, they left behind the bemused King Henry, who is supposed to have spent the battle sitting under a tree, singing. Two knights (the elderly Lord Bonville and Sir Thomas Kyriell, a veteran leader of the Hundred Years' War) had sworn to let him come to no harm, and remained with him throughout. The next morning Margaret asked her son, the seven-year-old Edward of Westminster, how, not whether, the two, both Knights of the Garter, were to die. Edward, thus prompted, sent them to be beheaded.Ralph A Griffiths, The Reign of King Henry VI University of California Press, 1981. p. 872. John Neville had been captured but was spared execution, as the Duke of Somerset feared that his own younger brother who was in Yorkist hands might be executed in reprisal.Rowse (1966), p.143 Henry knighted the young Prince Edward, who in turn knighted thirty Lancastrian leaders. One was Andrew Trollope, an experienced captain who had deserted the Yorkists at the Battle of Ludford Bridge in 1459 and who was reckoned by many to have planned the Lancastrian victories at Wakefield and St Albans. At St Albans, he had injured his foot stepping on one of Warwick's caltrops, but he nevertheless claimed to have killed fifteen Yorkists.Sir William Tailboys (1416 - 1464) is also mentioned as having been knighted by Henry VI after the battle.John A. Wagner Encyclopedia of the Wars of the Roses, 263 Although Margaret and her army could now march unopposed on to London, they did not do so. The Lancastrian army's reputation for pillage caused the Londoners to bar the gates. This in turn caused Margaret to hesitate, as did the news of Edward of March's victory at Mortimer's Cross. The Lancastrians fell back through Dunstable, losing many Scots and Borderers who deserted and returned home with the plunder they had already gathered. Edward of March and Warwick entered London on 2 March, and Edward was quickly proclaimed King Edward IV of England. Within a few weeks he had confirmed his hold on the throne with a decisive victory at the Battle of Towton. Perhaps the most significant person to be killed at the battle of St Albans, at least in terms of its dynastic results, was John Grey of Groby, whose widow, Elizabeth Woodville, married Edward IV in 1464.Charles Ross, Edward IV, (University of California Press, 1974), 85. 550th anniversary commemoration To commemorate the 550th anniversary year of the battle, the Battlefields Trust hosted a conference on the battle on 26‚Äì27 February 2011, close to the battle site. The conference featured authentic combat recreations by the Medieval Siege Society and a guided tour of the battlefield, and culminated in a Requiem Mass for the fallen at St Saviour's Church, conducted by Father Peter Wadsworth.

It is customarily used to dress tagliatelle al rag√π and to prepare lasagne alla bolognese. Genuine rag√π alla bolognese is a slowly cooked sauce, and its preparation involves several techniques, including sweating, saut√©ing and braising. Ingredients include a characteristic soffritto of onion, celery and carrot, different types of minced or finely chopped beef, often alongside small amounts of fatty pork. White wine, milk, and a small amount of tomato concentrate or tomatoes are added, and the dish is then gently simmered at length to produce a thick sauce. Outside Italy, the phrase \\"Bolognese sauce\\" often refers to a tomato-based sauce to which minced beef (or pork) has been added; such sauces typically bear less resemblance to rag√π alla bolognese being more similar in fact to the rag√π alla napoletana from the tomato-rich south of the country. Although in Italy rag√π alla bolognese is not used with spaghetti, so-called \\"spaghetti bolognese\\" has become a popular dish in many other parts of the world. Origin and history The origins of the Bolognese rag√π are related to those of the French rago√ªt, a stew of ingredients reduced to small pieces, which became popular in the 18th century. The earliest documented recipe for a rag√π served with pasta comes from late 18th century Imola, near Bologna, from Alberto Alvisi, cook of the local Cardinal Barnaba Chiaramonti, later Pope Pius VII. In 1891 Pellegrino Artusi published a recipe for a rag√π characterized as bolognese in his cookbook. Artusi's recipe, which he called Maccheroni alla bolognese, is thought to derive from the mid 19th century when he spent considerable time in Bologna (maccheroni being a generic term for pasta, both dried and fresh). The sauce called for predominantly lean veal filet along with pancetta, butter, onion, and carrot. The meats and vegetables were to be finely minced, cooked with butter until the meats browned, then covered and cooked with broth. No tomato sauce was foreseen. Artusi commented that the taste could be made even more pleasant by adding small pieces of dried mushroom, a few slices of truffle, or chicken liver cooked with the meat and diced. As a final touch, he also suggested adding half a glass of cream to the sauce when it was completely done to make it taste even smoother. Artusi recommended serving this sauce with a medium size pasta (\\"horse teeth\\") made from durum wheat. The pasta was to be made fresh, cooked until it was firm, and then flavored with the sauce and Parmigiano cheese. Evolution and variations Tagliatelle al rag√π as served in Bologna. In the century-plus since Artusi recorded and subsequently published his recipe for Maccheroni alla bolognese, what is now rag√π alla bolognese has evolved with the cuisine of the region. Most notable is the preferred choice of pasta, which today is widely recognized as fresh tagliatelle. Another reflection of the evolution of the cuisine since its inception, is the addition of tomato, either as a puree or as a concentrated paste, to the common mix of ingredients. Similarly, both wine and milk appear today in the list of ingredients in many of the contemporary recipes, and beef has mostly displaced veal as the dominant meat. In 1982, the Italian Academy of Cuisine (Accademia Italiana della Cucina), an organization dedicated to preserving the culinary heritage of Italy, recorded and deposited a recipe for \\"classic Bolognese rag√π\\" with the Bologna Chamber of Commerce (La Camera di Commercio di Bologna). A version of the academy's recipe for American kitchens was also published. The academy's recipe confines the ingredients to beef cut from the plate section (cartella di manzo), fresh unsmoked pancetta (pancetta di maiale distesa), onions, carrot, celery, passata (or tomato pur√©e), meat broth, dry white wine, milk, salt and pepper. Nowadays, there are many variations of the recipe even among native Italian chefs,Hazan, Marcella Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking, Knopf, and the repertoire has been further broadened by some American chefs known for their expertise in Italian cuisine.Bertolli, Paul, Cooking by Hand, Potter, Rag√π alla bolognese is a complex sauce which involves various cooking techniques, including sweating, saut√©ing and braising. As such, it lends itself well to interpretation and adaptation by professional chefs and home cooks alike. Common sources of differences include which meats to use (beef, pork or veal) and their relative quantities, the possible inclusion of either cured meats or offal, which fats are used in the saut√© phases (rendered pork fat, butter, olive or vegetable oil), what form of tomato is employed (fresh, canned or paste), the makeup of the cooking liquids (wine, milk, tomato juices, or broth) and their specific sequence of addition. The numerous variations among recipes for rag√π alla bolognese have led many to search for the definitive, authentic recipe. Some have suggested the recipe registered by the Accademia Italiana della Cucina in 1982 as the \\"most authentic\\". A pot of rag√π bolognese. However, this would be inconsistent with the academy's own beliefs and statements about remaining faithful to tradition in documenting and preserving Italy's culinary heritage. ; retrieved 2 March 2012Accademia Italian dell Cucina, La Cucina ‚Äì The Regional Cooking of Italy, Rizzoli, 2009, (English translation of La Cucina del Bel Paese) The Milan-born chef Mario Caramella stated, \\"In Italy, there are several traditional recipes of tagliatelle al rag√π alla bolognese with more or less slight variations\\". According to UK cookbook author and food writer Felicity Cloake, \\"The fact is that there is no definitive recipe for a bolognese meat sauce, but to be worthy of the name, it should respect the traditions of the area\\", a view that is consistent with that often expressed by the Italian Academy of Cuisine. The many variations tend to be based on a common theme. For instance, garlic is absent from all of the recipes mentioned above, as are herbs other than the parsimonious use of bay leaves by some. Seasoning is limited to salt, pepper and the occasional pinch of nutmeg. In all of the recipes, meats dominate as the principal ingredient, while tomatoes, in one form or another, are only an auxiliary ingredient. Traditional service and use In Bologna rag√π alla bolognese is traditionally paired and served with tagliatelle made with eggs and northern Italy's soft wheat flour. Acceptable alternatives to fresh tagliatelle include other broad flat pasta shapes, such as pappardelle or fettuccine, and tube shapes, such as rigatoni and penne.Hazan, Giuliano, The Classic Pasta Cookbook, Dorling Kindersley, While the combination of the rag√π with fresh tagliatelle remains the most traditional and authentic in the Bolognese cuisine, some - such as Piero Valdiserra - have argued in favour of capitalizing on its already internationally widespread combination with spaghetti, even by attempting to portray it as not entirely foreign to local tradition. Rag√π alla bolognese along with b√©chamel is also used to prepare traditional baked lasagna in Bolognese style. =International Day of Italian Cuisines 2010= Gruppo Virtuale Cuochi Italiani (GVCI), an international organization and network of culinary professionals dedicated to authentic Italian cuisine, annually organizes and promotes an \\"International Day of Italian Cuisines\\" (IDIC). In 2010 tagliatelle al ragu alla bolognese was the official dish for IDIC. The event, held on 17 January 2010, included participation by 450 professional chefs in 50 countries who prepared the signature dish according to \\"an authentic\\" recipe provided by chef Mario Caramella.http://www.itchefs- gvci.com/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=585&Itemid;=975, retrieved 2 March 2012 Media coverage was broad internationally, but reports often incorrectly identified the recipe followed as that of l'Accademia Italiana della Cucina, and some included stock photographs of spaghetti Bolognese. Spaghetti bolognese Spaghetti bolognese with thyme and basil. Spaghetti bolognese (sometimes called spaghetti alla bolognese, or colloquially 'spag bol', spaghetti with meat sauce, or just spaghetti) is a pasta dish that is popular outside Italy, but not part of traditional Bolognese or even Italian cuisine. The dish is generally perceived as inauthentic when encountered by Italians abroad. It consists of spaghetti served with a sauce made from tomatoes, minced beef, garlic, wine and herbs; sometimes minced beef can be replaced by other minced meats. In this sense the sauce is actually more similar to Neapolitan rag√π from the south of Italy than the northern Bolognese version of rag√π. It is often served with grated Parmesan on top, but local cheeses, such as grated cheddar are also often used. It may be served with a larger proportion of sauce to pasta than is common in genuine Italian spaghetti dishes. The sauce may be laid on top of the pasta (rather than being mixed in, in the Italian manner) or even served separately from it, leaving diners to mix it in themselves. The origins of the dish are unclear, but it may have evolved in the context of early twentieth century emigration of southern Italians to the Americas (particularly the United States) as a sort of fusion influenced by the tomato-rich style of Neapolitan rag√π or it may have developed in immigrant restaurants in Britain in the post war era. In countries where it is common, the sauce is often used for lasagna in place of rag√π alla bolognese as in Bologna and elsewhere in Italy.

Its design aims to provide back support, sense the user's motion, and send a signal to motors which manage the gears. The exoskeleton supports the shoulder, waist and thigh, and assists movement for lifting and holding heavy items, while lowering back stress. A powered exoskeleton differs from a passive exoskeleton in the fact that a passive exoskeleton is not powered by a system of electric motors, pneumatics, levers, hydraulics, or a combination of technologies. However, similar to a powered exoskeleton, it does give mechanical benefits to the user. History The earliest-known exoskeleton-like device was an apparatus for assisting movement developed in 1890 by Russian engineer Nicholas Yagn. It used energy stored in compressed gas bags to assist in movement, although it was passive and required human power.Yagin, Nicholas. \\"Apparatus for Facilitating Walking\\". filed February 11, 1890 and issued November 18, 1890. In 1917, United States inventor Leslie C. Kelley developed what he called a pedometer, which operated on steam power with artificial ligaments acting in parallel to the wearer's movements.Kelley, C. Leslie. \\"Pedomotor\\". filed April 24, 1917 and issued July 1, 1919. This system was able to supplement human power with external power. In the 1960s, the first true 'mobile machines' integrated with human movements began to appear. A suit called Hardiman was co-developed by General Electric and the US Armed Forces. The suit was powered by hydraulics and electricity and amplified the wearer's strength by a factor of 25, so that lifting would feel like lifting . A feature called force feedback enabled the wearer to feel the forces and objects being manipulated.The exhibit \\"future soldier\\", designed by the United States Army The Hardiman had major limitations, including its weight. It was also designed as a master-slave system: the operator was in a master suit surrounded by the exterior slave suit, which performed work in response to the operator's movements. The response time for the slave suit was slow compared to a suit constructed of a single layer, and bugs caused \\"violent and uncontrollable motion by the machine\\" when moving both legs simultaneously. Hardiman's slow walking speed of 0.76 metres per second (2.5 ft/s or just under 2 mph) further limited practical uses, and the project was not successful. At about the same time, early active exoskeletons and humanoid robots were developed at the Mihajlo Pupin Institute in Yugoslavia by a team led by Prof. Miomir Vukobratoviƒá. Legged locomotion systems were developed first, with the goal of assisting in the rehabilitation of paraplegics. In the course of developing active exoskeletons, the Institute also developed theory to aid in the analysis and control of the human gait. Some of this work informed the development of modern high-performance humanoid robots. In 1972, an active exoskeleton for rehabilitation of paraplegics that was pneumatically powered and electronically programmed was tested at Belgrade Orthopedic Clinic. Exoskeleton being developed by DARPA In 1985, an engineer at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) proposed an exoskeleton called Pitman, a powered suit of armor for infantrymen. The design included brain- scanning sensors in the helmet and was considered too futuristic; it was never built. In 1986, an exoskeleton called the Lifesuit was designed by Monty Reed, a US Army Ranger who had broken his back in a parachute accident. While recovering in the hospital, he read Robert Heinlein's science fiction novel Starship Troopers, and Heinlein's description of mobile infantry power suits inspired Reed to design a supportive exoskeleton. In 2001, Reed began working full-time on the project, and in 2005 he wore the 12th prototype in the Saint Patrick's Day Dash foot race in Seattle, Washington. Reed claims to have set the speed record for walking in robot suits by completing the race at an average speed of . The Lifesuit prototype 14 can walk on a full charge and lift for the wearer. Applications Steve Jurvetson with a Hybrid Assistive Limb powered exoskeleton suit, commercially available in Japan =Medical= Powered exoskeletons can improve the quality of life of individuals who have lost the use of their legs by enabling system-assisted walking. Exoskeletons‚Äîthat may be called \\"step rehabilitation robots\\"‚Äîmay also help with the rehabilitation from stroke, spinal cord injury or during aging. Several prototype exoskeletons are under development. The Ekso GT, made by Ekso Bionics, is the first exoskeleton to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for stroke patients. The German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence has developed two general purpose powered exoskeletons, CAPIO and VI-Bot. These are primarily being used for teleoperation. Exoskeleton technology is also being developed to enhance precision during surgery, and to help nurses move and carry heavy patients. =Military= Developing a full-body suit that meets the needs of soldiers has proven challenging. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) launched the Warrior Web program in September 2011 and has developed and funded several prototypes, including a \\"soft exosuit\\" developed by Harvard University's Wyss Institute. In 2019, the US Army's TALOS exoskeleton project was put on hold. A variety of \\"slimmed-down\\" exoskeletons have been developed for use on the battlefield, aimed at decreasing fatigue and increasing productivity. For example, Lockheed Martin's ONYX suit aims to support soldiers in performing tasks that are \\"knee-intensive\\", such as crossing difficult terrain. Leia Stirling's group has identified that exoskeletons can reduce a soldier's response times. =Civilian= Exoskeletons are being developed to help firefighters and other rescue workers to climb stairs carrying heavy equipment. =Industry= Passive exoskeleton technology is increasingly being used in the automotive industry, with the goal of reducing worker injury (especially in the shoulders and spine) and reducing errors due to fatigue. They are also being examined for use in logistics. These systems can be divided into two categories: * exoskeletons for upper-limb for assisting shoulder flexion-extension movements; * exoskeletons for lumbar support for assisting manual lifting tasks. For broadest application, industrial exoskeletons must be lightweight, comfortable, safe, and minimally disruptive to the environment. For some applications, single-joint exoskeletons (i.e. intended to assist only the limb involved in specific tasks) are more appropriate than full-body powered suits. Full-body powered exoskeletons have been developed to assist with heavy loads in the industrial setting, and for specialized applications such as nuclear power plant maintenance. The biomechanical efficacy of exoskeletons in industrial applications is however still largely unknown. Companies have to conduct a risk assessment for workplaces at which exoskeletons are to be used. The Institute for Occupational Safety and Health of the German Social Accident Insurance has developed a draft risk assessment for exoskeletons and their use. The safety assessment is based on diverse experience including machine safety, personal protective equipment and risk analysis of physical stresses at work. The exoskeletons available on the market often fail to give adequate consideration to safety aspects, in some cases despite claims to the contrary by their manufacturers. Products =Powered=Japet Exoskeleton is a powered lower-back exoskeleton for work and industry based on established passive braces.

In Feb 2020, their knee specific exoskeleton called Belk also received a CE approval. *Roam Robotics produces a soft exoskeleton for skiers and snowboarders. *Wandercraft produces Atalante, the first powered exoskeleton to allow users to walk hands-free, unlike most powered medical exoskeleton that require the simultaneous use of crutches. =Projects on hold/abandoned = Lockheed Martin's Human Universal Load Carrier (HULC) was abandoned after tests showed that wearing the suit caused users to expend significantly more energy during controlled treadmill walks. * Sarcos/Raytheon XOS Exoskeleton arms and legs were originally designed for use in the military. In 2019, the project was reported to be on hold. * The Berkeley Lower Extremity Exoskeleton (BLEEX) consisted of mechanical metal leg braces, a power unit, and a backpack-like frame to carry a heavy load. The technology developed for BLEEX led to SuitX's Phoenix. *A project from Ghent University, WALL-X was shown in 2013 to reduce the metabolic cost of normal walking. This result was achieved by optimizing the controls based on the study of the biomechanics of the human-exoskeleton interaction. Limitations and design issues Mobility aids are frequently abandoned for lack of usability. Major measures of usability include whether the device reduces the energy consumed during motion, and whether it is safe to use. Some design issues faced by engineers are listed below. =Power supply= One of the biggest problems facing engineers and designers of powered exoskeletons is the power supply. This is a particular issue if the exoskeleton is intended to be worn \\"in the field\\", i.e. outside a context in which the exoskeleton can be tethered to a power source. Batteries require frequent replacement or recharging, and may risk explosion due to thermal runaway. Internal combustion engine power supplies offer high energy output, but problems include exhaust fumes, heat and inability to modulate power smoothly. Hydrogen cells have been used in some prototypes but also suffer from several problems. =Skeleton= Early exoskeletons used inexpensive and easy-to-mold materials, such as steel and aluminium. However, steel is heavy and the powered exoskeleton must work harder to overcome its own weight, reducing efficiency. Aluminium alloys are lightweight, but fail through fatigue quickly. Fiberglass, carbon fiber and carbon nanotubes have considerably higher strength per weight. \\"Soft\\" exoskeletons that attach motors and control devices to flexible clothing are also under development. =Actuators= Pneumatic air muscle Joint actuators also face the challenge of being lightweight, yet powerful. Technologies used include pneumatic activators, hydraulic cylinders, and electronic servomotors. Elastic actuators are being investigated to simulate control of stiffness in human limbs and provide touch perception. The air muscle, braided pneumatic actuator or McKibben air muscle, is also used to enhance tactile feedback. =Joint flexibility= The flexibility of human anatomy is a design issue for traditional \\"hard\\" robots. Several human joints such as the hips and shoulders are ball and socket joints, with the center of rotation inside the body. Since no two individuals are exactly alike, fully mimicking the degrees of freedom of a joint is not possible. Instead, the exoskeleton joint is commonly modeled as a series of hinges with one degree of freedom for each of the dominant rotations. Spinal flexibility is another challenge since the spine is effectively a stack of limited-motion ball joints. There is no simple combination of external single-axis hinges that can easily match the full range of motion of the human spine. Because accurate alignment is challenging, devices often include the ability to compensate for misalignment with additional degrees of freedom. Soft exoskeletons bend with the body and address some of these issues. =Power control and modulation= A successful exoskeleton should assist its user, for example by reducing the energy required to perform a task. Individual variations in the nature, range and force of movements make it difficult for a standardized device to provide the appropriate amount of assistance at the right time. Algorithms to tune control parameters to automatically optimize the energy cost of walking are under development. Direct feedback between the human nervous system and motorized prosthetics (\\"neuro-embodied design\\") has also been implemented in a few high- profile cases. =Adaptation to user size variations= Humans exhibit a wide range of physical size differences in both skeletal bone lengths and limb and torso girth, so exoskeletons must either be adaptable or fitted to individual users. In military applications, it may be possible to address this by requiring the user to be of an approved physical size in order to be issued an exoskeleton. Physical body size restrictions already occur in the military for jobs such as aircraft pilots, due to the problems of fitting seats and controls to very large and very small people. For soft exoskeletons, this is less of a problem. Health and safety While exoskeletons can reduce the stress of manual labor, they may also pose dangers. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has called for research to address the potential dangers and benefits of the technology, noting potential new risk factors for workers such as lack of mobility to avoid a falling object, and potential falls due to a shift in center of gravity. As of 2018, the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration was not preparing any safety standards for exoskeletons. The International Organization for Standardization published a safety standard in 2014, and ASTM International was working on standards to be released beginning in 2019.

In other words it is the weakest topology such that all elements of the predual are continuous (when considered as functions on B(H)). Relation with the weak (operator) topology The ultraweak topology is similar to the weak operator topology. For example, on any norm-bounded set the weak operator and ultraweak topologies are the same, and in particular the unit ball is compact in both topologies. The ultraweak topology is stronger than the weak operator topology. One problem with the weak operator topology is that the dual of B(H) with the weak operator topology is \\"too small\\". The ultraweak topology fixes this problem: the dual is the full predual B*(H) of all trace class operators. In general the ultraweak topology is more useful than the weak operator topology, but it is more complicated to define, and the weak operator topology is often more apparently convenient. The ultraweak topology can be obtained from the weak operator topology as follows. If H1 is a separable infinite dimensional Hilbert space then B(H) can be embedded in B(H‚äóH1) by tensoring with the identity map on H1. Then the restriction of the weak operator topology on B(H‚äóH1) is the ultraweak topology of B(H).

It is thought to be possible to achieve non-rocket spacelaunch with this technology. It consists of a long tube (barrel) filled with a mixture of combustible gases with a frangible diaphragm at either end to contain the gases. The projectile is fired by another means (e.g., a light-gas gun or railgun) supersonically through the first diaphragm into the tube. Then the projectile burns the gases as fuel, because it is shaped like a ramjet or scramjet core, and accelerates under jet propulsion. Other physics come into play at higher velocities. Description In a normal ramjet, air is compressed between a spike-shaped centerbody and an outer cowling, fuel is added and burned, and high speed exhaust gases are expanded supersonically out of the nozzle to generate thrust. In a ram accelerator, a projectile having a shape similar to the ramjet centerbody is fired, (often from a conventional gun), into the accelerator barrel, causing compression between the projectile and the barrel's walls. The barrel contains a pre-mixed gaseous fuel-air mixture. As the ram accelerator projectile compresses the fuel-air mixture, it is ignited and the combustion is stabilized at the base of the projectile. The resulting pressure differential generates a prodigious amount of thrust that can accelerate projectiles to in- tube Mach numbers greater than 8. Thus, if propellant mixtures with a speed of sound of 1000 m/s (e.g. fuel-rich H2-O2 mixtures) are used, muzzle velocities in excess of 8000 m/s are possible. To span a wide range in a typical ram accelerator system, multiple stages with propellants with different sound speeds are used to maintain high performance. Membranes or diaphragms that are easily punctured by the projectile are used to isolate the propellant stages. Each section is filled with a different fuel-air mixture chosen so that later sections have higher speeds of sound. As such, the ram can be maintained at optimal speeds of Mach 3-5 (relative to the mixture that it travels through) during its entire acceleration period. Ram accelerators optimized to use supersonic combustion modes can generate even higher velocities (Mach 6-8) due to the ability to combust fuel that is still moving at supersonic speed.  Testing  Scramjet projectiles were tested in the HARP project in the 1960s. Advantages The chief advantage of a ram accelerator over a conventional gun is its scalability. In a normal gun, maximum pressure is exerted at the time of the charge ignition. As the projectile moves further down the barrel, the amount of acceleration upon the projectile decreases as the gas behind it expands, eventually reaching amounts trivial enough that a longer barrel is no longer justified (see internal ballistics). With a ram accelerator, the projectile is propelled primarily by the pressure generated by the reaction of the propellant gases burning just behind the projectile. This leads to constant pressure being put both on the gun and the projectile itself. Consequently, far longer barrels are possible than conventional guns, while still delivering a strong constant acceleration to the projectile. Uses Ram accelerators have been proposed as a cheap method to get payloads into space. Impulsive launched projectiles need some means to circularize their trajectory for orbit insertion, so rockets, such as those designed in the 1960s in Project HARP, are typically incorporated into the projectiles. With multi-stage rocket projectiles the launch cost was estimated at US$500 per kilogram in 2004. There are also envisions of the technology for military applications, such as ultra-long range striking and intercepting capabilities against stationary and on-the-move threats. The fact that the projectile accelerates and travels at very high velocities makes it a perfect alternative to anti-ship warfare, giving it abilities to evade defense systems. Only systems such as railguns could have such striking abilities against high alert threats. Such projectiles could even be integrated into railguns themselves to allow even higher acceleration at a cheaper cost and effectiveness against a wide variety of targets. Technologies related to a ram accelerator for direct space launch applications are: two-stage gas guns (SHARP), multiple sidewall injection gas guns (JVL), railguns, and coilguns. Ram accelerators are currently used primarily for research into supersonic combustion. As of July 2007, the Ballistic Flight Group has been promoting commercial investment into the ram accelerator technology. The scram cannon science fiction weapon was inspired by ram accelerators.

It is a type of two-component sensory transduction pathway which helps bacteria react to their environment.  Protein components  The uhp system is composed of UhpA, UhpB, UhpC, and UhpT. UhpB and UhpC are both transmembrane proteins which form a complex with each other. UhpA is a signal protein found in the cytoplasm. UhpT is a transporter protein which facilitates the uptake of phosphorylated hexose molecules into the cell.  Functionality  The Uhp system uptakes phosphorylated hexose sugars into bacteria. The system is triggered by phosphorylated hexose sugars on the outside of the cell. UhpC binds to the phosphorylated hexose, which allows the phosphorylation of UhpB on one of its cytoplasmic histidines.

The party was founded in 1938 by dissidents from the Puerto Rican Liberal Party and the Unionist Party and originally promoted policies on the center-left.Government / Brief history of elections in Puerto Rico. Encyclopedia Puerto Rico. Fundaci√≥n Puertorrique√±a de las Humanidades. Retrieved 29 February 2012. In recent years, however, its leaders have described the party as centrist. As one of the long-standing parties on the island, the PPD has played a significant role in the history of Puerto Rico. In the early 1950s, for example, the party held a majority in the delegation convened to draft the Constitution of Puerto Rico. Once the constitution was ratified, the document was proclaimed by the party's leader and co-founder, Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n‚Äîwho, in doing so, became the first Puerto Rican governor elected by the people of Puerto Rico. The party ruled all branches of the Puerto Rican government afterward for 36 of the past years, while establishing many of the institutions that permeate Puerto Rican society today. Today, the party is one of the two major parties in Puerto Rico with significant political strength. In the executive branch, the party's last governor was Alejandro Garc√≠a Padilla who governed the island from 2013‚Äì2017. It also holds minorities in the legislative and judicial branches by holding minorities in the Senate, in the House, and in the Supreme Court. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, however, is from the PPD; a circumstance that allows the party to designate political appointees in the judicial branch since the Chief Justice is also constitutionally the chief judicial administrator. Finally, in the municipal landscape, the party holds more than half of the seats of mayors. Ideologically, the PPD differs from the other parties active in the island. Historically, for example, the party's opponent has been the New Progressive Party (PNP in Spanish). Both parties have ruled the island unopposed for years after the Puerto Rican constitution was ratified in 1952. Members of the party are referred to in different terms depending on their faction. In general, those affiliated to the party are commonly called populares (English: \\"populars\\") and mostly affiliate with the Democratic Party of the United States. Internally, members aligned with the delegation that drafted the constitution compose the largest faction and are referred to as 'conservatives'. A smaller 'liberal' faction is referred to as the soberanistas, and advocates for Puerto Rico to enter a compact of free association with the United States rather than remain an unincorporated territory under the United States.  History  Building with Partido Popular Democratico in Puerta de Tierra, San Juan = Foundation = Dissidents expelled from the Liberal Party of Puerto Rico (then led by Antonio R. Barcel√≥), founded the PPD in 1938. Many of them were part of the old socialist movement of Puerto Rico. The dissident faction, initially calling themselves the Partido Liberal, Neto, Aut√©ntico y Completo (\\"Clear, Net, Authentic, and Complete Liberal Party\\") (PPD), was led by Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n. In 1937, the debate had concerned the differences between the moderate demands of autonomy leading to gradual independence by the Liberal Party faction led by Barcelo, and the desire for more radical demands of immediate independence and social reform by Mu√±oz and his followers. = 1940s = In 1940, the highest elective political office in Puerto Rican was as president of its Senate. At the time, the governor was appointed by the president of the United States; no native- born Puerto Ricans were appointed to the post until 1946, when Jes√∫s T. Pi√±eroone of the original founders of the PPDwas appointed by U.S. President Harry S. Truman. In the 1940 election, the Popular Democratic Party of Puerto Rico (PPD) finished in a dead heat with the Liberal Party. Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n of the PPD brokered an alliance with minor Puerto Rican factions so as to secure his position as Senate president; such coalition-building was fundamental to the multi-party society. The elections in 1944 and 1948 resulted in greater victory margins for the PPD; nearly all the legislative posts and mayoral races in Puerto Rico were won by PPD candidates. On May 21, 1948, a member of the PPD introduced a bill before the Puerto Rican Senate which would restrain the rights of the independence and nationalist movements on the archipelago. The Senate, which at the time was controlled by the PPD and presided by Mu√±oz Mar√≠n, approved the bill. This bill, which resembled the anti-communist Smith Act passed in the United States in 1940, became known as the Ley de la Mordaza (Gag Law, technically \\"Law 53 of 1948\\") when the U.S.-appointed governor of Puerto Rico, Pi√±ero, signed it into law on June 10, 1948. Under this new law it became a crime to print, publish, sell, or exhibit any material intended to paralyze or destroy the insular government; or to organize any society, group or assembly of people with a similar destructive intent. It made it illegal to sing a patriotic song, and reinforced the 1898 law that had made it illegal to display the Flag of Puerto Rico, with anyone found guilty of disobeying the law in any way being subject to a sentence of up to ten years imprisonment, a fine of up to US$10,000 (), or both, for each offence. According to Dr. Leopoldo Figueroa, a non-PPD member of the Puerto Rico House of Representatives, the law was repressive and violated the First Amendment of the US Constitution which guarantees Freedom of Speech. He pointed out that the law was a violation of the civil rights of the people of Puerto Rico. Numerous Nationalists were arrested under the law, and Figeroa defended 15 of them. He also defended a man in a case taken to the US Supreme Court, to challenge the \\"Gag Law\\" on the basis of the government's not having had sufficient evidence to arrest the suspect. The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the law. Once Jes√∫s T. Pi√±ero stepped down as the last U.S.-appointed governor, the governor's office became an elected position. In 1949, under the leadership of Mu√±oz Mar√≠n, the PPD won the first gubernatorial elections in Puerto Rico, and Mu√±oz became the first elected governor of the island. He served for what is the longest rule by any of the nearly 200 governors (starting with Juan Ponce de Le√≥n in 1508) in Puerto Rican history, being re-elected three times, and serving a total of four 4-year terms, or 16 years. = 1950s = During the 1950s, Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n was twice re-elected (1952, 1956) as Puerto Rico's governor. In 1952 he assumed the responsibility of pushing forward the drafting of a constitution to create the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. The constitution was passed by the legislature and overwhelmingly approved by the people with an 82% vote. On July 25, 1952, the new constitution went into effect. Munoz pushed his political-financial platform, called Operation Bootstrap (Operaci√≥n Manos a la Obra), in which he stimulated Puerto Rico's economy to develop industry. Teodoro Moscoso was in charge of the project. = 1960s = Mu√±oz Mar√≠n was re-elected in 1960, his fourth consecutive term. In 1964, Mu√±oz Mar√≠n chose not to run for a fifth term. Roberto S√°nchez Vilella, representing the PPD, became the second governor to be democratically elected in Puerto Rico. The party remained in control of the governor's office until 1968. By the time of the 1968 election, personal and irreconcilable differences had developed between S√°nchez Vilella and PPD party president Mu√±oz Mar√≠n. Mu√±oz Mar√≠n opposed S√°nchez Vilella's attempt to run for reelection. At a PPD party assembly, Munoz nominated Luis Negr√≥n L√≥pez as his candidate for governor, ruining any chance that S√°nchez Vilella would be considered in the party's primary process. S√°nchez Vilella left to create a new party called the People's Party (Partido del Pueblo, PP). The PP's motto was \\"Que el pueblo decida\\", (Let the people decide). The motto was obviously directed at Mu√±oz Mar√≠n, who denied S√°nchez Vilella a chance to compete in a party primary. With S√°nchez Vilella and Negr√≥n L√≥pez competing as candidates for differentbut nearly identicalparties, the electorate split their votes. Luis A. Ferr√© of the New Progressive Party (Partido Nuevo Progresista, PNP), which advocates for statehood, won the gubernatorial election with a plurality of votes among the three major parties. This was the first defeat of the PPD in a general election since its founding. = 1970s = By 1972 the PPD had a young and fresh leader in former senate president Rafael Hern√°ndez Col√≥n. After the 1968 electoral defeat, Mu√±oz Mar√≠n left the island and went into \\"exile\\" in Italy to stay away from local politics and let the PPD find its new direction without him. Mu√±oz Mar√≠n did not return to Puerto Rico until the PPD had selected Hern√°ndez Col√≥n as its new leader and candidate for governor. Mu√±oz Mar√≠n introduced him before 300,000 people in Hato Rey at a party meeting. In the 1972 general election, Hern√°ndez Col√≥n defeated Ferr√© by a wide margin, and his party won in all but 4 municipalities. In 1976, Carlos Romero Barcel√≥, mayor of San Juan and the PNP candidate, defeated Hern√°ndez Col√≥n. = 1980s = In 1980, Rafael Hern√°ndez Col√≥n ran again as the PPD gubernatorial candidate. Controversy arose when PPD followers alleged that there were irregularities during the vote count. The power went out during the night while results were being counted. PPD supporters said that, before the power went out, the vote count was favoring Hern√°ndez Col√≥n, but when the power was restored, results started favoring Romero Barcel√≥. The Populares alleged fraud and Hernandez Col√≥n said, \\"Populares, a defender esos votos a las trincheras de la lucha.\\" (Populares, let's fight for those votes in the trenches). After the recount, Romero Barcel√≥ of the PNP won by 3,000 votes. The PPD won almost every other part of the election. In 1984, Hern√°ndez Col√≥n was elected again as governor, defeating his long-time political rival Romero Barcel√≥ of the PNP. His second term was marked by his successful fight to keep federal Law 936 (U.S.C. TITLE 26, Subtitle A, CHAPTER 1, Subchapter N, PART III, Subpart D, ¬ß 936, \\"Puerto Rico and Possession Tax Credit\\") in force. The PDP had helped establish the law, which gave tax breaks to American companies operating in Puerto Rico in order to encourage new businesses. In 1988, Hern√°ndez Col√≥n was re-elected by a comfortable margin, defeating Corrada del R√≠o of the PNP. The two candidates conducted a formal debate on issues. That same year H√©ctor Luis Acevedo, the PPD mayoral candidate for San Juan, won the San Juan mayoral race by only 49 votes. In 1988, Santos Ortiz, a.k.a. \\"El Negro\\", mayor of Cabo Rojo, left the PPD. He ran for mayor in the next election as an independent, and was the first person not affiliated with Munoz Marin and any of the three major parties in Puerto Rico to win an elected position. = 1990s = Sila Calder√≥n In 1992, after Hern√°ndez Col√≥n decided not to run for governor again, the PPD elected Victoria Mu√±oz Mendoza, daughter of Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n, as its candidate. The first woman in Puerto Rican history to run for governor, she lost the election to Pedro Rossell√≥. In 1996, H√©ctor Luis Acevedo ran for governor from the PPD, but lost to Rosell√≥. That year, the PPD won San Juan mayoralty with its candidate, Sila Mar√≠a Calder√≥n.  Plebiscites on political status  The opposition party, PNP, led two campaigns for Puerto Rican statehood in 1993 and 1998. Locally enacted plebiscites were held to consult the Puerto Rican people on the issue of future political status of the island in relation to the United States. In 1993 the PPD campaigned in favor of the status quo Commonwealth, while the PNP opposition campaigned for full statehood. Voters supported continuation of the Commonwealth option, which received 48% of the votes. In 1998, the PNP Governor Pedro Rossell√≥ carried out a non-binding plebiscite on political status, in which voters were asked to choose from one of four political status options (statehood, free association, commonwealth, or independence) or a fifth one, \\"none of the above\\". The Popular Democratic Party led a campaign to boycott the plebiscite, calling on the electorate to vote for the \\"none of the above\\" option. The boycott was successful, as the \\"none of the above\\" choice garnered more votes than any of the other options. Among the four alternatives, the statehood option won the most votes. Rossell√≥ argued before the US Congress that statehood had won the plebiscite. He considered votes for the \\"none of the above\\" option to be invalid. = 2000s = In 2000, Sila Mar√≠a Calder√≥n regained the governor's seat for the PPD, defeating PNP's candidate Carlos Ignacio Pesquera, and Puerto Rican Independence Party (PIP) candidate Ruben Berrios. After Calder√≥n announced that she would not be running for governor in 2004, An√≠bal Acevedo Vil√° emerged as the new candidate. He was the current Resident Commissioner and a former PPD president. Acevedo Vil√° was victorious in the 2004 elections against a former governor, Pedro Rossell√≥. He was the fifth governor from the Popular Democratic Party. On March 27, 2008 governor Acevedo Vila had been indicted with 24 federal counts ranging from conspiracy to wire fraud relating to the governor's campaign finances when he was acting as Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico in the US Congress.KIRK SEMPLE, \\"Puerto Rican Governor Faces 19 Counts\\", New York Times, 27 March 2008Indictment - United States of America v. Anibal Acevedo Vil√°, et al., UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO, The United States Department of Justice However, 15 of these charges were quickly dismissed on revision by the judge. On March 20, 2009, a federal grand jury decided there was not sufficient basis to try Acevedo Vila on the remaining charges and he was released. In November 2008 Acevedo Vil√° ran for re-election against the PNP gubernatorial candidate, Luis Fortu√±o, but was defeated. The PPD selected H√©ctor Ferrer R√≠os as the next president of the party. = 2010s = On the elections held on November 6, 2012, the party regained the top offices: Alejandro Garc√≠a Padilla was elected governor and Carmen \\"Yul√≠n\\" Cruz was elected as Mayor of San Juan. The party also took control of the House Of Representatives and Senate of Puerto Rico. On the elections held on November 8, 2016, the party lost governorship, the House of Representatives and Senate of Puerto Rico. The Popular Democratic Party retained a majority of the mayoralty races in the island, with a total of 45 out of 78 municipalities. The New Progressive Party (PNP) won a total of 33.  Political ideals  The PPD political platform calls for a free associated state, autonomous, Puerto Rico that maintains a voluntary relationship with the federal government of United States in areas of mutual benefit, such as national defense, like any other state. Two notable areas of discontent with the current political arrangement are the taxation system and the empowerment of the courts. Currently, custom duties and the authority to enter into treaties with foreign nations remain within the control of the federal government of the United States. In the legal realm, decisions of the Puerto Rico Supreme Court can be overruled by higher courts in the United States. PPD supporters charge that this is unsatisfactory arrangement given that Puerto Ricans are not allowed to exercise their democratic right to vote for the person that appoints those judges - the President of the United States. Puerto Ricans are also not allowed to exercise their democratic right to elect Senatorial representation into the US Senate, the authority within the US of government that is empowered to approving appointees into the federal court system. Furthermore, Puerto Rican court decisions must be made consistent with the laws of the United States and in alignment with the Constitution of the United States.Public Law 600, Art. 3, 81st Congress of the United States of America, July 3, 1950 The PPD objectives have trended towards gaining further autonomy and greater local control over the foreign relations of the Commonwealth. The PPD supports Puerto Rico taking on more of the character of an autonomous territory rather than becoming a state of the American Union. Puerto Ricans, for example, pride themselves in having their own Olympics representation, having an identity with Spanish as their mother tongue, and sharing an appreciation for their own unique cultural identity. At its 2007 convention, the PPD approved a new philosophy and set of ideals for the party. The new philosophy commits the party to defending a political status for the island that is based in the irrevocable right of the people of Puerto Rico to form a sovereign country. This shift in philosophy caused a stir among party detractors, since the PPD was not known for being that liberal before. Its conservative stance had been represented by its unshakable defense of the commonwealth status quo. In January 2010, the \\"governing board\\" of the party approved a resolution presented by the current party president H√©ctor Ferrer, among others, rejecting the free association concept to develop the commonwealth status based on the current free association compacts of the United States with the pacific jurisdictions; the resolution indicate that this free associations compacts does not recognize the indissoluble link between the U.S. and Puerto Rico of the United States Citizenship. Other members of the party reject the resolution indicating that is not in agreement with the official position adopted by the party \\"general assembly\\" on the 2007 convention. They indicated that the \\"government board\\" could not revoke the decisions of the party \\"general assembly\\" and just the \\"general assembly\\" itself as the party's top organ could revoke the 2007 decisions. = Support for discussion of Puerto Rico status within U.N. General Assembly = On January 8, 2007 Governor An√≠bal Acevedo Vil√° stated that he intends to garner support to have the political status of Puerto Rico considered before the General Assembly of the United Nations (UN). He also expressed that he expected such support to come from both inside and outside of Puerto Rico as well as from within and beyond the PPD.Vargas, Yaisha. \\"Government looks for allies to go to UN\\". Associated Press (AP); January 8, 2007. The Associated Press reported that Governor Acevedo Vil√° announced that \\"We have started negotiations with other sectors of Puerto Rico, to see in what way we can accelerate that issue and achieve more allies at the UN\\".  Party logo and song  The PPD used as a logo the silhouette of a rural farm worker, jibaro, wearing a traditional straw hat (), with the words \\"pan, tierra, libertad\\" (bread, land, freedom). The party logo was designed by Antonio Colorado, Sr., one of Mu√±oz's party staff members and an eventual cabinet member. In 2016, the logo was updated to include a woman and the words \\"pan, tierra, libertad' were substituted with \\"unidad, trabajo, prosperidad\\" (\\"unity, work, prosperity\\") The PPD is unique in Puerto Rican politics in having adopted an anthem. \\"Jalda Arriba\\" was written by Johnny Rodriguez, a famous Puerto Rican singer, composer and club owner. He dedicated the song to former governor Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n. The song also became strongly associated with the PPD because of this. Rodriguez was the elder brother of Tito Rodr√≠guez, one of Puerto Rico's most famous international singers. =Jalda Arriba= >  Leadership  = Party presidents = = Gubernatorial nominees = = > Other major leaders =  See also  ;Ideology * Liberalism * Liberalism > worldwide * Liberal democracy * Contributions to liberal theory * Autonomy * > Associated Republic * Commonwealth * Sovereignty ;Politics * List of > political parties in Puerto Rico * Politics of Puerto Rico  Notes   > References   External links  1938 establishments in Puerto > Rico Political parties established in 1938 Political > parties in Puerto Rico Social liberal parties ","title":"Popular Democratic Party (Puerto Rico)"},{"id":"30876946","text":"The Rise of Endymion is a 1997 science fiction novel by American writer Dan Simmons. It is the fourth and final novel in his Hyperion Cantos fictional universe. It won the Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel, and was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1998. Plot =Premise= The Rise of Endymion is set more than 275 years after the fall of the Hegemony of Man, an interstellar organization connected by farcaster portals. At the time of this novel, the Roman Catholic Church has formed the Pax, an administrative entity that formalizes the Church's control and implements a theocracy. The Church and the Pax have secretly been collaborating with representatives of the TechnoCore. The Core provides the Church with cruciforms, which allow humans to be resurrected and gain functional immortality. However, the TechnoCore fears that Aenea, daughter of a human being and a TechnoCore intelligence, will destroy their hold on 31st-century society. The world Hyperion has been assimilated into the Pax. However, other worlds resist Pax control, with independence movements springing up on worlds with different religious and philosophical traditions. =Summary= Raul is still imprisoned and writing his memoirs of his time with Aenea. On Pacem, Lenar Hoyt (now known as Pope Urban XVI) announces a new Crusade against the Ousters. Father de Soya finds the murder of Ouster children unconscionable, and he mutinies. On Old Earth, Aenea becomes a teacher, instructing others about \\"the Void which Binds\\". When she is sixteen, Aenea tells Raul to leave Earth and retrieve the Consul's ship. On God's Grove, three cyborgs retrieve Radamanth Nemes. The four almost catch up with Raul, but they are intercepted by the Shrike. Raul finds the Consul's ship. Travel to T'ien Shan creates a 5-year time debt, and Aenea is 21 when she and Raul reunite. On the Buddhist planet T'ien Shan, Raul becomes Aenea's lover. Aenea reveals that many people on the planets she has visited have taken communion from her. People who take this communion undergo several changes due to the virus she carries, including gaining the ability to access the Void which Binds and losing the ability to carry a cruciform. Aenea tells Raul that during their separation, she married someone and had a child; they lived together for two years. Raul is heartbroken. Aenea transfers the Consul's ship away from T'ien Shan through freecasting, using the Void to travel without a portal. They travel to an Ouster Dyson Sphere. There Raul meets Het Masteen and Fedmahn Kassad, two of the Hyperion pilgrims who had died in alternate timelines. Raul learns the truth about the cruciforms. The resurrection uses energy from The Void, causing irreparable damage to the Void. The Core murders humans whenever they need more neural processing power. Pax troops arrive in the Biosphere, committing genocide on an unprecedented level. Aenea, Raul, many other humans, and the Shrike escape on a treeship captained by Het Masteen. Aenea freecasts to many star systems, dropping off passengers who will continue spreading her communion. The ship is destroyed, and the Shrike returns Masteen to his original timeline. On Pacem, Aenea confronts Urban; she and Raul are arrested. Raul is placed in the Schr√∂dinger cat box, from which he has been narrating the previous two books. Aenea is tortured by Nemes. Lourdusamy rebels against the Core and burns Aenea to death. Raul completes his memoirs and escapes the cat box by freecasting. At the moment of her death, Aenea's thoughts were broadcast to most of humanity through the Void, creating a widespread rebellion against the Pax and the TechnoCore. Raul travels to Earth, where he meets Aenea. Raul discovers that he is the man with whom Aenea had a child. They will have two years together before she returns to the past. Aenea tells Raul that these two years can be an eternity for them.  Characters  Aenea, often described as a messiah, is a young woman who is the daughter of a human, Brawne Lamia, and an artificial intelligence persona of John Keats. She becomes a teacher and a semi-religious figure. She becomes a martyr and catalyst for the destruction of the Pax. * Raul Endymion. Previously a nomadic shepherd on Hyperion, he was enlisted into Aenea's service by Martin Silenus. Endymion becomes Aenea's love interest. * Father Captain Federico de Soya. De Soya is a Pax Fleet officer and Catholic priest who had attempted to capture Aenea in the novel Endymion. After saving her life, de Soya was exiled to MadredeDios and stripped of his command, but is called back into service at the beginning of this novel. He mutinies again after witnessing atrocities committed by the Pax Fleet and renounces the cruciform. * A. Bettik, an android. Born several hundred years before the Fall of the Farcasters in the 29th century, Bettik was a laborer on Hyperion for centuries. He then worked for Martin Silenus. Befriended by Raul, he has accompanied Aenea on their journey. At the conclusion he is revealed to be an observer from an otherwise undescribed advanced alien race which also utilizes The Void Which Binds. = Church and Pax figures = Cardinal Simon Augustino Lourdusamy, a prelate and the Vatican's Secretary of State, is the effective head of the Catholic Church and the dominant force behind Pope Urban XVI. Lourdusamy masterminds the search for Aenea and plans the crusade against the Ousters with Urban's approval. * Father Lenar Hoyt. A central character in Hyperion, Hoyt was one of the last pilgrims to Hyperion and wears both his cruciform and that of Father Paul Dur√©. Hoyt has served as Pope multiple times after the Fall of the Farcasters, and reigns as Urban XVI at the time of the novel. * Cardinal John Domenico Mustafa. The Grand Inquisitor of the Holy Office, he is among the most powerful Cardinals and is not a close ally of Lourdusamy's faction. He personally investigates the Shrike's massacres on Mars and is the Church's direct representative throughout the search for Aenea on T'ien Shan. He confronts TechnoCore forces twice during the novel; he is wounded by Nemes the first time and murdered by Albedo the next. * Kenzo Isozaki is the CEO of the Pax Mercantilus, a Church-recognized super-corporation, and considered to be almost as powerful as Cardinal Lourdusamy. He schemes against the Church leadership throughout the novel and is subsequently relegated to the titular command of an anti-Ouster crusade. At the end of the novel, Isozaki takes control of Pacem, driving out TechnoCore forces, and establishes a provisional democracy on the planet. * Admiral Marget Wu. The temporary commander of Pax Fleet, Wu plays a supporting role in the novel and is murdered by the Nemes clones on T'ien Shan. * Rhadamanth Nemes, the Core-created robot who acts as a guard for the Vatican and who hunts Aenea. She has three siblings: Scylla, Gyges, and Briareus. Reception and Awards The novel's critical reception was moderately positive. The New York Times referred to the entire series as \\"one of the finest achievements of modern science fiction\\" and praised the novel's epic scope, worldbuilding, and serious exploration of the relationship between science and religion. Publishers Weekly praised its action sequences, but criticized its overly complex plot and Aenea's unclear explanation of her purpose. Other reviews criticized it for having too much exposition and too little plot, while acknowledging the author's creativity. The novel won the 1998 Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel and was nominated for the 1998 Hugo Award for Best Novel.

Her sisters included , , and . She was built by the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel, laid down in early 1906 and launched in August of that year. She was completed in April 1908. N√ºrnberg was armed with ten guns, eight SK L/55 guns, and two submerged torpedo tubes. Her top speed was . N√ºrnberg served with the fleet briefly, before being deployed overseas in 1910. She was assigned to the East Asia Squadron. At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, she was returning to the German naval base at Tsingtao from Mexican waters. She rejoined the rest of the Squadron, commanded by Vice Admiral Maximilian von Spee, which steamed across the Pacific Ocean and encountered a British squadron commanded by Rear Admiral Christopher Cradock. In the ensuing Battle of Coronel on 1 November, the British squadron was defeated; N√ºrnberg finished off the British cruiser . A month later, the Germans attempted to raid the British base in the Falkland Islands; a powerful British squadron that included a pair of battlecruisers was in port, commanded by Vice Admiral Doveton Sturdee. Sturdee's ships chased down and destroyed four of the five German cruisers; sank N√ºrnberg, with heavy loss of life. Design Line-drawing of the K√∂nigsberg class The K√∂nigsberg -class ships were designed to serve both as fleet scouts in home waters and in Germany's colonial empire. This was a result of budgetary constraints that prevented the Kaiserliche Marine from building more specialized cruisers suitable for both roles.Gardiner & Gray, pp. 142, 157 N√ºrnberg was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of forward. She displaced at full load. Her propulsion system consisted of two 3-cylinder triple expansion engines powered by eleven coal- fired Marine-type water-tube boilers. These provided a top speed of and a range of approximately at . N√ºrnberg had a crew of 14 officers and 308 enlisted men.Gr√∂ner, p. 104 The ship was armed with a main battery of ten SK L/40 guns in single pedestal mounts. Two were placed side by side forward on the forecastle, six were located amidships, three on either side, and two were side by side aft.Gardiner & Gray, p. 157 The guns had a maximum elevation of 30 degrees, which allowed them to engage targets out to .Gardiner & Gray, p. 140 They were supplied with 1,500 rounds of ammunition, for 150 shells per gun. The ship was also equipped with eight SK guns with 4,000 rounds of ammunition. She was also equipped with a pair of torpedo tubes with five torpedoes submerged in the hull on the broadside. The ship was protected by an armored deck that was thick amidships. The conning tower had thick sides. Service history N√ºrnberg was ordered under the contract name \\"Ersatz \\" and was laid down at the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel on 16 January 1906. At her launching on 28 August 1906, the mayor of her namesake, Dr. Georg von Schuh, christened N√ºrnberg, after which fitting-out work commenced. She was commissioned into the High Seas Fleet on 10 April 1908.Gr√∂ner, pp. 104‚Äì105Hildebrand, R√∂hr, & Steinmetz, p. 168 After serving briefly with the fleet in German waters, N√ºrnberg was sent overseas in 1910.Gr√∂ner, p. 105 She was assigned to the Kaiserliche Marine's East Asia Station at Tsingtao as part of Admiral Count Maximilian von Spee's East Asia Squadron. During the Mexican revolution she was positioned off the west coast of Mexico. After being relieved by , N√ºrnberg returned to her home base at Tsingtao.Gray, p. 184 In the summer of 1914, N√ºrnberg was steaming across the Pacific to relieve Leipzig on the Mexico station.Halpern, p. 71 With the outbreak of World War I, Spee planned a return of his squadron to Germany, sailing through the Pacific, rounding Cape Horn, and then forcing his way north through the Atlantic. On 6 August 1914, N√ºrnberg rendezvoused with the core of the East Asia Squadron, the armored cruisers and , in Ponape. Spee decided the best place to concentrate his forces was Pagan Island in the northern Marianas Islands, a German possession in the central Pacific. All available colliers, supply ships, and passenger liners were ordered to meet the East Asia Squadron there.Hough, pp. 3‚Äì4 On 11 August, Spee arrived in Pagan; he was joined by several supply ships, as well as Emden and the auxiliary cruiser Prinz Eitel Friedrich.Hough, p. 5 The four cruisers then departed the central Pacific, bound for Chile. On 13 August the captain of the Emden, Commodore Karl von M√ºller, persuaded Spee to detach his ship for commerce raiding.Herwig, pp. 155‚Äì156 The ships again coaled after their arrival at Enewetak Atoll in the Marshall Islands on 20 August.Hough, p. 33 On 6 September Spee detached N√ºrnberg, along with the tender Titania, to cut the British cable system at Fanning Island. The cruiser flew a French ensign to deceive the defenders, and succeeded in destroying the station on 7 September. N√ºrnberg then rejoined the fleet at Christmas Island.Gray, p. 185 later that day. In order to keep the German high command informed of his activities, Spee sent N√ºrnberg on 8 September to Honolulu to send word through neutral countries.Strachan, p. 471 Spee chose the ship because the British were aware she had left Mexican waters, and so her presence in Hawaii would not betray the movements of the entire East Asia Squadron.Bennett, pp. 71-72 She was also ordered to contact German agents to instruct them to prepare coal stocks in South America for the squadron's use.Halpern, p. 88 N√ºrnberg brought back news of the Allied conquest of the German colony at Samoa. On 14 September, Spee decided to use his two armored cruisers to raid the British base at Apia; he sent N√ºrnberg to escort the squadron's colliers to the rendezvous location. At the Battle of Papeete on 22 September, N√ºrnberg and the rest of the East Asia Squadron bombarded the colony.Strachan, p. 472 During the bombardment, the French gunboat Z√©l√©e was sunk by gunfire from the German ships. Fear of mines in the harbor prevented von Spee from seizing the coal that lay in the harbor.Halpern, p. 89 By 12 October, the squadron had reached Easter Island. There they were joined by Dresden and Leipzig, which had sailed from American waters. After a week in the area, the ships departed for Chile.Hawkins, p. 34 =Battle of Coronel= N√ºrnberg, Scharnhorst, and Gneisenau in Valparaiso with the Chilean Navy after the battle; N√ºrnberg is the third ship in the line in the distance To oppose the German squadron off the coast of South America, the British had scant resources; under the command of Rear Admiral Christopher Cradock were the armored cruisers and , the light cruiser , and the auxiliary cruiser . This flotilla was reinforced by the elderly pre-dreadnought battleship and the armored cruiser , the latter, however, did not arrive until after the Battle of Coronel.Herwig, p. 156 Canopus was left behind by Cradock, who likely felt that her slow speed would prevent him from bringing the German ships to battle.Halpern, p. 92 On the evening of 26 October, the East Asia Squadron steamed out of Mas a Fuera, Chile, and headed eastward. Spee learned that Glasgow had been spotted in Coronel on the 31st, and so turned towards the port. He arrived on the afternoon of 1 November, and to his surprise, encountered Good Hope, Monmouth, and Otranto as well as Glasgow. Canopus was still some behind, with the British colliers.Halpern, pp. 92‚Äì93 At 17:00, Glasgow spotted the Germans; Cradock formed a line with Good Hope in the lead, followed by Monmouth, Glasgow, and Otranto in the rear. Spee decided to hold off on engaging the British until the sun had set more, at which point the British ships would be silhouetted by the sun. N√ºrnberg was some distance behind the rest of the German squadron, and joined the ensuing action later;Halpern, p. 93 she had been delayed from searches of neutral steamers.Bennett, p. 89 Arriving late to the battle, N√ºrnberg found the drifting and finished her off with gunfire at a range of around .Bennett, p. 94 On 3 November, N√ºrnberg, Scharnhorst, and Gneisenau steamed into Valparaiso, Chile to resupply their coal and other supplies. They were limited to 24 hours per international law, which also allowed only three warships in any neutral port at a time; the other two cruisers, Leipzig and Dresden, had to return to Mas a Fuera. After regrouping at Mas a Fuera, Spee had decided to raid British shipping routes in the South Atlantic. On 21 November, the East Asia Squadron put into St. Quentin Bay to coal; the crews piled up coal on the ships' decks to allow them to steam all the way to the Port of Santa Elena, where Spee had arranged for colliers out of Montevideo to meet them on 5 December.Bennett, p. 103 =Battle of the Falkland Islands= Map showing the movements of the British and German ships during the battle In the aftermath of the Battle of Coronel, Spee decided to attack the British base at Port Stanley in the Falkland Islands. N√ºrnberg and Gneisenau were to raid the harbor, destroy the wireless station, and burn the coal stocks, while the rest of the squadron screened for British warships.Halpern, p. 97 Spee was under the incorrect impression that the Falkland Islands were undefended. The British had detached a pair of battlecruisers, and , and four cruisers, under the command of Vice Admiral Doveton Sturdee, to track down Spee's squadron and defeat it in return for Coronel.Halpern, pp. 98‚Äì99 When N√ºrnberg and Gneisenau approached the islands early on 8 December, the old battleship Canopus opened fire and drove them off. The Germans were surprised to see the warships in the harbor, and Spee decided to retreat.Halpern, p. 98 The East Asia Squadron steamed away at in a single file line; N√ºrnberg was the second ship in the line, between Gneisenau and Scharnhorst.Bennett, p. 115 Sturdee ordered his ships to raise steam and pursue the Germans. His battlecruisers caught up and opened fire at 12:50; Spee decided that he could hold off the battlecruisers with Scharnhorst and Gneisenau to allow the three light cruisers time to escape. In response, Sturdee sent his light cruisers to chase down N√ºrnberg, Dresden, and Leipzig.Halpern, p. 99 chased N√ºrnberg down; at 17:00, N√ºrnberg opened fire at extreme range, approximately . Kent was unable to reply until the range fell to , at which time she began firing salvos rapidly. N√ºrnberg turned to port in order to bring her entire broadside into action, which was mimicked by Kent.Bennett, p. 124 The two ships steered on converging courses, and the distance between the two cruisers dropped to . By that time, Kents shells were raining down on N√ºrnberg and were causing major damage. A serious fire broke out forward at 18:02, and by 18:35, she was dead in the water and had ceased firing. Kent temporarily ceased fire, but after noticing N√ºrnberg was still flying her battle ensigns, resumed combat. After five more minutes of shelling, N√ºrnberg struck her colors, and Kents crew prepared to lower lifeboats to pick up survivors.Bennett, p. 125 Only twelve men were picked up before the ship capsized and sank at 19:26, and five of them died after being rescued. Among the dead was one of Spee's sons, Otto von Spee. In total, 327 officers and men were killed in the battle. In the course of the engagement, N√ºrnberg had hit Kent thirty-eight times, but did not cause significant damage. One shell struck one of Kents casemate guns and ignited the propellant charges inside, but the magazine was flooded before the fire could destroy the ship. The sinking was commemorated in a painting entitled The Last Man by Hans Bohrdt, which depicted a German sailor waving the Imperial ensign as N√ºrnberg slipped beneath the waves.Hildebrand, R√∂hr, & Steinmetz, p. 169  Notes  Memorial to Captain Karl von Sch√∂nberg, the commander of N√ºrnberg and killed during the battle Footnotes Citations References     * External links K√∂nigsberg-class cruisers (1905) Ships built in Kiel 1906 ships World War I cruisers of Germany World War I shipwrecks in the Atlantic Ocean Shipwrecks of the Falkland Islands Maritime incidents in 1914 ","title":"SMS N√ºrnberg (1906)"},{"id":"30876953","text":"Ahead of Their Time is a live album by The Mothers of Invention.

For hundreds of years, mining in the Forest of Dean Coalfield has been regulated through a system of freemining, in which individuals who qualify are granted leases to mine specified areas, known as gales. The Coal Industry Nationalisation Act 1946 exempted the Forest of Dean because of its unique form of ownership and history, allowing the unique privilege to continue intact. The last of the big gales closed in 1965 and today only a handful of small collieries are still operating.Clearwell Caves website Geology and hydrology The Forest of Dean Coalfield formed during Upper Carboniferous times, when the area was a nearshore-intertidal environment of semi-marine estuaries and swamps. The area today is a raised basin plateau of Paleozoic rocks folded in the Variscan Orogeny. It occurs in a raised asymmetrical syncline with a steeper eastern limb that surfaces in the area of Staple Edge and the Soudley Valley producing the steeply dipping strata. An unusual feature of the Forest of Dean Coalfield is that its edges are almost entirely exposed at the surface.Gloucester Geology Trust website Geological cross section (west to east), showing the major structural features of the Forest of Dean Mining in the coalfield has always been hampered by the excessive amount of water encountered underground - trapped by the basin-shaped strata. Water drains into the basin by general percolation and, more directly, via surface watercourses. For much of their length, streams in the area run over impervious clay deposits, but, where valleys cut through the rim of the basin, carboniferous limestone and sandstone are exposed, allowing water to penetrate underground via swallow holes, cracks, and fissures. Water also enters the basin through geological faults. In an attempt to reduce the pumping requirement, many mine owners 'waterproofed' the beds of watercourses with conduits or channels, wherever water loss was thought likely to occur. These artificial drainage features can be seen, at some point or other, on almost every watercourse within the mining area.Swallow Holes and Mine Drainage in The Forest of Dean, C.R.Bowen. Freemining The 'Freeminer Brass' \\\\- a symbol of the freeminers' authority above the Crown For hundreds of years, mining in the Forest of Dean Coalfield has been regulated through a system of freemining; where individuals, if they qualify, can lease a specified area in which to mine. Freeminers were instrumental in recapturing Berwick upon Tweed several times (1296, 1305, and 1315) and it is thought that freemining rights were granted by Edward I as a reward for their endeavours. The Free Miner's Mine Law Court sat at the Speech House from 1682 and the earliest known existing copy of Dean Miners' Laws and Privilege's, known locally as the Book of Dennis, dates from 1610, but the copy contains references to much earlier origins. Towards the end of the 18th century, as the Industrial Revolution took hold, increasing demand for coal and iron led to conflicting mining interests and the court became bogged down with disputes. Deep coal and iron reserves could not be mined without substantial investment and the Crown became determined to introduce the free market into the Forest. The Mine Law Court was outlawed in 1777 and all its documents were confiscated by Crown Officials. A Royal Commission was appointed in 1831 to inquire into the nature of the mineral interests and freemining customs in the Forest of Dean, leading to the passing of the Dean Forest Mines Act 1838,Dean Forest (Mines) Act, 1838 which forms the basis of freemining law. It confirmed the freeminers' exclusive right to the minerals of the Forest of Dean, but also allowed freeminers to sell their gales to a non-freeminers; further opening up the Forest to outside industrialists.Clearwell Caves website As of 2010 the gender requirement has been recognised as archaic, and women are allowed to become freeminers.www.guardian.co.uk Exploitation of the coalfield The Roll of Honour sculpture at New Fancy, commemorating miners who were killed or injured in the mines and quarries of the Forest of Dean Coal mining, on a small scale, began before Roman times.The Mines of the Forest of Dean, Tony Oldham The small mines were widespread but as iron mining was of greater importance, mining coal was possibly a by-product. Edward Terringham, a Gentleman of the Bedchamber in the court of Charles I was granted a monopoly to mine coal in the Forest, infringing the rights of freeminers and leading to widespread and sometimes violent confrontation. To improve production and enable year-round working, Terringham built a drainage sough and brought in labour from Staffordshire. He abandoned the lease to Sir John Winter for an annuity in 1640. Disafforestation took place but Winter was deprived of his rights during the Protectorate and after the Restoration gave up the lease. At this time the coal, which amounted to about 25,000 tons in 1680, was shipped out of the area via the River Wye. The coalfield was not exploited to any great degree until the Industrial Revolution, when coke-fired ironworks were built in the Forest.www.lightmoor.co.uk Initially, it proved impossible to produce coke from local coal that was ideal for smeltingHistorical Metallurgy Society website which was a major factor in the failure of three early furnaces within a decade of them opening. Around 1820 Moses Teague, whilst borrowing the cupola furnace at Darkhill Ironworks, discovered a way to make good iron from local coke, greatly advancing the iron and coal industries of the Forest of Dean. By the mid-19th century, there were more than 300 gales or coal workings and it was said there were more men working below ground than there were working above.BBC Gloucestershire The Coal Industry Nationalisation Act, of 1946 exempted the Forest of Dean, due to its unique form of ownership and history, allowing freemining privileges to continue intact. Some large colliery gales were subsequently compulsorily purchased by the National Coal Board (NCB), but remained under the freemining system and a royalty was paid to the freeminers by the NCB as a share of the minerals extracted. In 1945 half the male population of the Forest were employed in coal mining. The last of the NCB gales closed in 1965, but freemining continues to be an important aspect of Forest of Dean culture and there are probably still around 150 freeminers, although only a handful of collieries are still operating.Clearwell Caves website Collieries Foxes Bridge Colliery, ca. 1900 The collieries or gales, most of which were small, were given \\"imaginative\\" somewhat unusual names, such as Strip and At It, Gentleman Colliers or Rain Proof. They took coal from seams or delfs named Rocky, Lowery, and Starkey. Child labour was used extensively underground to drag loads of coal up to 1942 when it was made illegal. In 1904 some gales were amalgamated into seven groups in order to mine on a larger scale from deeper seams and the output reached one million tons annually. Output declined after World War II and the last big pit closed in 1965 and the area was subject to opencast working. Coal is still mined on a very small scale. *Arthur and Edward near Lydbrook was also known as Waterloo. (NCB) The pit had a Cornish pumping engine until the early 1860s. In 1949 the pit was flooded by an inrush of water from the old East Slade Pit but one miner knew a way out through old workings and led his four colleagues to safety at Pludds Colliery. *Bilson produced 4,482 tons of coal in 1880. *Cannop (NCB) *Crump Meadow produced 75,173 tons of coal in 1880. It had a Cornish engine house for pumping water and another for winding. It was sunk in 1824 and had a 105-year life span. *Eastern United (NCB) *East Slade close to Ruardean Woodside closed in 1910. *Flour Mill *Foxes Bridge produced 126,978 tons of coal in 1880. It was operated by Henry Crawshay and Company and closed in 1930. Lightmoor Colliery's engine house *Lightmoor produced 60 tons of coal in 1880. The colliery belonged to Henry Crayshaw and Company and had lasted for a century when it closed in 1940. Its shaft which reached the Brazilly seam at 936 feet intersected 18 coal seams, but not all were workable. *New Fancy produced 8,382 tons of coal in 1880. It worked the Coleford High Delf seam and closed in 1944. *Norchard (NCB) *Northern United (NCB) owned by Henry Crawshay and Company opened in 1933 and closed in 1965.

It is best known for its campaigns in World War II under the command of General George S. Patton. Third Army is headquartered at Shaw Air Force Base, South Carolina with a forward element at Camp Arifjan, Kuwait. It serves as the echelon above corps for the Army component of CENTCOM, US Central Command, whose area of responsibility (AOR) includes Southwest Asia, some 20 countries of the world, in Africa, Asia, and the Persian Gulf. Activation and World War I The Third United States Army was first activated as a formation during the First World War on 7 November 1918, at Chaumont, France, when the General Headquarters of the American Expeditionary Forces issued General Order 198 organizing the Third Army and announcing its headquarters staff. On the 15th, Major General Joseph T. Dickman assumed command and issued Third Army General Order No. 1. The third Army consisted of three corps (III, Maj. Gen. John L. Hines; IV, Maj. Gen. Charles Muir; and VII, Maj. Gen. William G. Hahn) and seven divisions. =First mission= On 15 November 1918, Major General Dickman was given the mission to move quickly and by any means into Central Germany on occupation duties. He was to disarm and disband German forces as ordered by General John J. Pershing, commander of the American Expeditionary Forces. The march into Germany for occupation duty was begun on 17 November 1918. By 15 December the Third Army Headquarters at Mayen opened at Coblenz. Two days later, on 17 December 1918, the Coblenz bridgehead, consisting of a pontoon bridge and three railroad bridges across the Rhine, had been established. Third Army troops had encountered no hostile act of any sort. In the occupied area, both food and coal supplies were sufficient. The crossing of the Rhine by the front line divisions was effected in good time and without confusion. Troops, upon crossing the Rhine and reaching their assigned areas, were billeted preparatory to occupying selected positions for defense. The strength of the Third Army as of 19 December, the date the bridgehead occupation was completed, was 9,638 officers and 221,070 enlisted men. =Third Army advance= \\"This old castle perched on a hilltop above the Moselle River and the town of Cochem, Germany, is headquarters of the U.S. Fourth Army Corps. In foreground is Cpl. James C. Sulzer, Fourth Army Corps, Photo Unit. January 9, 1919.\\" On 12 December, Field Order No. 11 issued, directed the Third Army to occupy the northern sector of the Coblenz bridgehead, with the advance elements to cross the Rhine river at seven o'clock, 13 December. The northern (left) boundary remained unchanged. The southern (right) boundary was as has been previously mentioned. Before the advance, the 1st Division passed to the command of the III Corps. With three divisions, the 1st, 2d, and 32d, the III Corps occupied the American sector of the Coblenz bridgehead, the movement of the troops into position beginning at the scheduled hour, 13 December. The four bridges available for crossing the river within the Coblenz bridgehead were the pontoon bridge and railroad bridge at Coblenz, the railroad bridges at Engers and Remagen. On 13 December the advance began with the American khaki crossing the Rhine into advanced positions. On the same day the 42d Division passed to the command of the IV Corps, which, in support of the III Corps, continued its march to occupy the Kreise of Mayen, Ahrweiler, Adenau, and Cochem. The VII Corps occupied under the same order that portion of the Regierungsbezirk of Trier within army limits. On 15 December, Third Army Headquarters at Mayen opened at Coblenz: III Corps Headquarters at Polch opened at Neuwied and IV Corps Headquarters remained at Cochem, with the VII Corps at Grevenmacher. In crossing the Rhine on the shortened front‚Äîfrom Rolandseck to Rhens on the west bank‚Äîthe Third Army encountered no hostile act of any sort. In the occupied area both food and coal supplies were sufficient. By the night of 14 December, Third Army troops had occupied their positions on the perimeter of the Coblenz bridgehead.\\"Crossing the Rhine,\\" History of the American Third Army, 14 November 1918 to 2 July 1919, Third Army, A.E.F., 2 July 1919. =Army of Occupation= During January 1919, the Third Army was engaged in training and preparing the troops under its command for any contingency. A letter of instruction was circulated to lower commanders prescribing a plan of action in case hostilities were resumed. Installations were set up throughout the Army area to facilitate command. In February, military schools were opened through the Third Army area; a quartermaster depot was organized; 2,000 officers and enlisted men left to take courses in British and French universities; better leave facilities were created; and plans for sending American divisions to the United States were made. On 4 February, the military control of the Stadtkreis of Trier was transferred from GHQ to the Third Army. In March, routine duties of occupation and training were carried on; an Army horse show was held; Army, corps, and divisional educational centers were established in the Third Army Zone; the Coblenz port commander took over the duties of the Coblenz regulating officer; and the 42d Division was released from IV Corps and was placed in Army Reserve. In April, the exodus of American divisions from Third Army to the United States began. During the month, motor transport parks were established; an Army motor show was held; the Army area was reorganized; and the centralization of military property was initiated in anticipation of returning it to the United States. On 20 April 1919, Third Army command changed from Maj. Gen. Dickman to Lt. Gen. Hunter Liggett. =Prepare to advance= On 14 May 1919, Marshal Ferdinand Foch, General-in-Chief of the Allied Armies, submitted plans of operations to the Third Army commander to be used in the event that Germany should refuse to sign the peace treaty. On 20 May, Marshal Foch directed allied commanders to dispatch troops toward Weimar and Berlin in the event the peace treaty was not signed. On 22 May, the Third Army issued its plan of advance, effective 30 May, in view of the impending emergency. On 27 May, Foch informed Pershing that the Supreme War Council desired allied armies be made ready immediately to resume active operations against the Germans. On 1 June, the advance GHQ, AEF, at Trier was discontinued. On 16 June, Foch notified Pershing that allied armies must be ready after 20 June to resume offensive operations and that preliminary movements were to begin 17 June. On 19 June, Pershing notified Foch that beginning 23 June the Third Army would occupy the towns of Limburg, Westerburg, Hachenburg, and Altenkirchen, and that III Corps would seize the railroad connecting these towns. On 23 June, the Germans signified their intention to sign the peace treaty and contemplated operations were suspended. On 30 June, Foch and Pershing conferred about the American troops to be left on the Rhine. =A separate peace= On 1 July, General Pershing notified the War Department that upon Germany's compliance with military conditions imposed upon her (probably within three months after German ratification of the treaty), the American forces in Europe would be reduced to a single regiment of infantry supplemented by necessary auxiliaries. Accordingly, the Third Army was disbanded on 2 July 1919. Its headquarters and all personnel (numbering about 6,800 men) and units under it were thereafter designated American Forces in Germany. This force would remain in Germany for over three years. This was due, at least in part, to the fact that the United States, having rejected the Treaty of Versailles, was therefore still \\"de jure\\" at war with Germany. This situation remained unresolved until the summer of 1921 when a separate peace treaty was signed. Reactivation and the interwar period The Third Army was reactivated on 9 August 1932, in a reorganization of field forces in the United States, as one of four field armies activated to control the units of the U.S. Army that were stationed on home soil. Until the buildup of American forces prior to its entry into World War II, the Third Army remained largely a paper army. It held training exercises periodically, but these were almost never adequate. World War II American flag over Festung Ehrenbreitstein after the occupation of Koblenz by the 3rd Army, 1945 As a result of mobilization the Third Army took on the role of training some of the huge numbers of recruits that the draft was bringing into the United States Armed Forces. Lieutenant General Walter Krueger, later to gain fame for his command of Sixth Army during operations in the Pacific, commanded Third Army from May 1941 until February 1943. Under his leadership, the basis of the Army's later success as a combat formation was laid. Krueger was succeeded by Lieutenant General Courtney Hodges who led the Army for the rest of 1943. The news that many had expected came in December 1943 and the Third Army was shipped from the United States to the United Kingdom. Third Army did not take part in the initial stages of Operation Overlord. However, when it did take the field, it was led by George S. Patton. When Third Army was moved to France, it was just after formations under the command of Omar Bradley had achieved the breakout from Normandy. Third Army followed up on that success and began a great dash across France, ultimately out-running its supply lines and halting it near the German border. After a period of consolidation, Third Army was ready to go on the offensive again. However, the Germans then launched their last great offensive of the war ‚Äì the Battle of the Bulge. This battle was an attempt to repeat the decisive breakthrough of 1940. However, in 1944, the Germans were doomed to failure. Their own logistical problems surfaced, and they ground to a halt. Nevertheless, they had broken the U.S. front, and it took a great effort to reduce the resulting salient. In one of the great moves of the war, Patton heeded the advice of his Intelligence Officer, Oscar Koch, and planned to aid First Army if required. When the German offensive commenced, Patton was prepared to turn Third Army's axis of advance ninety degrees and advance north to the southern flank of the German forces. The German salient was reduced by the end of January 1945, and the remainder of the process of closing up to the Rhine could be completed. Some vicious fighting took place, but by April there was but one great natural barrier between Third Army and the heart of Germany. Unlike in 1918, the crossing of the Rhine was opposed. However, the bridgehead was won, and Third Army embarked on another great eastward dash. It reached Austria and in May liberated the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camps complex. Its forces ended up in Czechoslovakia, the furthest east of any American units. The Third Army After Action of May 1945 states that the Third Army captured 765,483 prisoners of war, with an additional 515,205 of the enemy already held in corps and divisional level POW cages processed between 9 May and 13 May 1945, for a total of 1,280,688 POWs, and that, additionally, Third Army forces killed 144,500 enemy soldiers and wounded 386,200, for a total of 1,811,388 in enemy losses.U.S. Third Army After Action Report, May 1945, Headquarters, Third U.S. Army, 1 August 1944 ‚Äì 9 May 1945 VOL. I (Operations) [unclassified] Fuller's review of Third Army records differs only in the number of enemy killed and wounded, stating that between 1 August 1944 and 9 May 1945, 47,500 of the enemy were killed, 115,700 wounded, and 1,280,688 captured. Fuller's combined total of enemy losses is 1,443,888 enemy killed, wounded, or captured by the Third Army. The Third Army suffered 16,596 killed, 96,241 wounded, and 26,809 missing in action for a total of 139,646 casualties according to the aforementioned After Action Report of May 1945.U.S. Third Army After Action Report, May 1945, Headquarters, Third U.S. Army, 1 August 1944 ‚Äì 9 May 1945 VOL. I (Operations) [unclassified] According to Fuller, the Third Army lost 27,104 killed and 86,267 wounded. There were 18,957 injuries of all kinds and 28,237 men listed as missing in action. Including 127 men captured by the enemy, total casualties of the Third Army were 160,692 in 281 continuous days of operations. Fuller points out that the ratio of German troop deaths to American deaths in the Third Army operating area was 1.75:1. =German occupation= In the immediate postwar occupation, Army G-2 briefly hosted the Fedden Mission.Christopher, John. The Race for Hitler's X-Planes (The Mill, Gloucestershire: History Press, 2013), pp. 28, 123. Third Army remained in Germany until recalled to the United States again in 1947. When back in the United States, its duties were much the same as those of the 1930s, acting as a command and training force for units in the United States. The Korean War saw a repeat of the earlier World War II training duties. The Third Army remained responsible for this aspect of U.S. Armed Forces operations until 1974, when a new major headquarters, that of Forces Command, or FORSCOM was activated to replace Third Army. Third Army was thus inactivated, and it remained so for the better part of a decade. ARCENT On 3 December 1982, a special ceremony was held at Fort McPherson to mark the return to Active Army status of Headquarters, Third U.S. Army under the command of Lieutenant General M. Collier Ross. Guests at the event included former Third Army Commanders, General (Retired) Herbert B. Powell and Lieutenant General (Retired) Louis W. Truman. The new headquarters was established at Fort McPherson, and its new mission was to serve as the Army component in a unified command, the United States Central Command, which has responsibility over a vast overseas area covering parts of Africa, Asia, and the Persian Gulf. For its part, Third Army could draw upon a reservoir of Army units, and became responsible for planning, exercising, and rapidly deploying these units in crisis situations. Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm It was not until 1990 that Third Army returned to combat. Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in August 1990, and American forces were immediately dispatched to Saudi Arabia to protect the Saudi oil fields. Since Saudi Arabia came within the CENTCOM area, Third Army was sent to command the Army units in theatre. At first, XVIII Corps made up the forces assigned to Third Army; enough men to ensure that the Iraqis could not invade Saudi Arabia. However, in November 1990, massive reinforcements were announced in the form of VII Corps from Germany. This deployment marked the largest use of armored formations by the U.S. since World War II, and thus it was fitting that Patton's old command, Third Army, should have control of the battle. By the opening of hostilities, XVIII Corps had three American and one French division and VII Corps four American and one British division under command, thus giving Third Army a total of nine divisions, plus the armored cavalry regiments attached to both corps. Third Army, commanded by Lieutenant General John J. Yeosock, was the main striking force in Operation Desert Storm. Its units were on the left flank of the attacking force and swept into southern Iraq. They then turned east and engaged the Iraqi Republican Guard in fierce combat. Much of that force was destroyed. In terms of its immediate aims, the Persian Gulf War was a stunning success. The Iraqis were ejected from Kuwait and their forces were thoroughly mauled. During the crisis, the 22nd Support Command served as the primary Logistics and Combat Service Support organization for ARCENT during the Operation Desert Shield, Operation Desert Storm and Operation Desert Farewell portions of the operation. The Command was activated as the ARCENT SUPCOM (Provisional) on 19 August 1990, but had been in operation since 10 August 1990. The ARCENT SUPCOM (PROV) was redesignated the 22nd Support Command on 16 December 1990.Thomas D. Dinackus, Order of Battle: Allied Ground Forces of Operation Desert Storm, Hellgate Press/PSI Research, 2000, Part 2, Chart 2, p. 2-6 During the conflict, the commander was Major General, and then Lieutenant General William 'Gus' Pagonis. When the Command was disestablished following Operation Desert Farewell, it was succeeded by the 1st Area Support Group. Supporting allies Third Army/ARCENT remained engaged in the Middle East after the end of the Persian Gulf War with various operations to enforce the cease fire. =Operation Vigilant Warrior= In October 1994, ARCENT was again called upon to command, control, and deploy U.S. Army forces to Kuwait during Operation Vigilant Warrior. The operation was initiated in response to Saddam Hussein's saber rattling and posturing of Iraqi military forces along the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border. This act of aggression threatened to upset the delicate balance of peace in the region. ARCENT's rapid generation and deployment of a formidable Army force clearly demonstrated U.S. resolve and commitment to its friends and allies in the region. =Operation Vigilant Sentinel= Less than one year later, Saddam Hussein would again deploy Iraqi forces close to its border with Kuwait. In August, Third Army/ARCENT provided command and control for a rapid deployment of a heavy brigade task force. Once more, Iraqi threats were met while ARCENT simultaneously conducted a major training exercise in Egypt, \\"BRIGHT STAR 95,\\" involving military forces from 6 other nations. This contingency operation validated critical procedures for deployment, particularly the off-loading of equipment from floating prepositioning ships and its distribution to arriving soldiers. The deployment of a \\"Fly-Away Package\\" of key contingency staff also validated procedures for a rapidly deployed command and control group able to conduct combat operations immediately upon arrival. The operation was described by Third Army as having convinced Hussein to withdraw his forces from the Kuwaiti border. =Operation Desert Strike= In September 1996, it was alleged that Iraq violated United Nations sanctions by deploying forces north of the 36th Parallel and attacking ethnic Kurds in Northern Iraq. In response to Hussein's refusal to withdraw his forces, the U.S. launched cruise missile strikes against selected military targets inside Iraq. A heavy brigade task force, 2nd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division, was deployed to Kuwait under the command of Third Army/ARCENT as follow on forces to an already deployed Task Force (Task Force Headhunter, 1/9th and 1/12th Cavalry) to deter potential retaliatory attacks on Kuwait. The Brigade Task Force was supported by elements of the United States Marines, British Royal Marines and the Kuwaiti Liberation Brigade. Hussein soon capitulated, withdrawing his military forces south of the 36th Parallel. =Operation Desert Thunder I= When Saddam Hussein blocked United Nations weapons inspections, tested the resolve of coalition commitment by violating the no-fly zone, and publicly threatened to mimic earlier Soviet successes by shooting down U2 reconnaissance over-flights in the Fall of 1997, CENTCOM responded with a land, sea, and air strike force of more than 35,000 U.S. and coalition forces. In support of this powerful multi-service, multinational ground force, General Anthony C. Zinni, Commander-in-Chief, CENTCOM, established a permanent Coalition/ Joint Task Force (C/JTF), headquartered at Camp Doha, Kuwait, and commanded by Lieutenant General Tommy R. Franks, Commanding General, Third Army/ARCENT. In addition to the U.S. and coalition forces already in Kuwait, a brigade task force from 3d Infantry Division, Fort Stewart, Georgia, rapidly deployed to Kuwait. Departing from Hunter Army Airfield, the brigade task force deployed 4,000 personnel and 2,900 short tons of equipment on 120 aircraft. Within 15 hours of landing at Kuwait City International Airport, the unit had drawn prepositioned equipment and was in battle positions in the desert. On 28 February, Combined Joint Task Force Kuwait (C/JTF-K) was prepared to defend Kuwait with a ground force strength of more than 9,000 personnel. Argentina, Australia, Canada, Czech Republic, Hungary, New Zealand, Poland, Romania, the United Kingdom, and Kuwait rounded out the C/JTF by providing liaison teams, aircraft support, special operations elements, chemical/biological defense, base defense units, MASH units, and medical personnel. Added to forces on the ground was equipment for two more brigades (one Army and one Marine) afloat in the Persian Gulf with the Maritime Preposition Force. These ships were poised to link up with soldiers and Marines who would draw their equipment and begin combat operations if required. Attack air provided by Navy, Air Force, and Coalition assets rounded out this formidable force. This was the largest multinational force assembled in Southwest Asia since the conclusion of the Persian Gulf War. According to the Third Army, the demonstrated capability to quickly deploy combat forces from around the world deterred Iraqi aggression and helped reinstate compliance with the UN Weapons Inspection Program. In November 1998, when the work of the UN inspectors was again interrupted, Third Army quickly returned to the Persian Gulf to convince Saddam that the United States stood ready to enforce the terms of the cease-fire. =Operation Desert Thunder II= As Saddam Hussein violated United Nations sanctions and threatened regional stability, the United States began deploying to Kuwait and preparing for combat operations. Combined/Joint Task Force-Kuwait, in place since Desert Thunder I, played a key role in the rapid deployment, reception, staging, onward movement, and integration of forces. Units deploying to Kuwait included advance parties from the 3d Infantry Division and the 32d Army Air and Missile Defense Command (AAMDC), personnel from the Theater Support Command (TSC), Air Support Operations Center (ASOC), and Marine forces. In addition, the redeployment of the Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) in the Persian Gulf was placed on hold and a second MEU was ordered to the Persian Gulf as reinforcement. While forces were deploying to the Persian Gulf region, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan flew to Baghdad to meet with Saddam Hussein. Following negotiations, Saddam Hussein agreed to allow uninterrupted resumption of United Nations weapons inspections. In mid-Nov, as the crisis defused, there were 2,300 personnel deployed to Kuwait in support of C/JTF- Kuwait. =Operation Desert Fox = When Iraqi aircraft began challenging the established no-fly zones, and Iraqi air defense systems fired on allied aircraft in December 1998, US and UK forces responded with a massive display of firepower. Allied air force and navy aircraft, and cruise missiles engaged command and control, communications, and selected Republican Guards targets on the morning of 16 December. These concentrated attacks against Iraqi targets continued until the early morning of 19 December. During the campaign, Third Army again deployed forces to defend Kuwait, and to reassure allies in the Persian Gulf region. By late December, C/JTF-Kuwait consisted of approximately 6,000 personnel, including the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit. Operation Iraqi Freedom Third Army was deployed to attack Iraq again in early 2003. The forces it had under its command for Operation Iraqi Freedom were much smaller in numbers than those it had commanded twelve years before. It had V Corps as its main striking force, with only two complete divisions and an airborne brigade under that command. There was also I Marine Expeditionary Force, controlling a further two divisions and a brigade. However, numbers were made up for by the advances in technology, which rendered this a powerful force. It took six weeks to defeat Iraq, along with 3rd Infantry Division, the heavy mech/armor component of XVIII Airborne Corps. The aftermath of the campaign saw Third Army headquartered in Baghdad, directing its third occupation within one hundred years. Current role As a result of July 2011 BRAC relocations, Third U.S. Army is headquartered at Shaw Air Force Base, South Carolina with a forward element at Camp Arifjan, Kuwait. Administratively called ARCENT again, it continues to serve as the Army Component Command for CENTCOM, and the forward element is serving as the Coalition Forces Land Component Command (CFLCC). It provides support and services to theater ARFOR commands, as well as directed Army support to other services. Previously, in Saudi Arabia, its bases include King Abdul Aziz Air Base, King Fahad Air Base, King Khalid Air Base, Eskan Village Air Base and Riyadh Air Base. The Army moved all its bases and equipment to Al Udeid Air Base, Qatar in 2003. Focusing primarily on the Middle East, Central Command and Third Army's area of responsibility (AOR) is a large and complex region. It stretches from the Central Asian States to the Horn of Africa. The AOR encompasses an area of approximately consisting of 27 countries populated by over 650 million people speaking 12 major languages and representing seven major religions. Within this strategically important region lay the historical crossroads of three continents, the majority of the world's oil and natural gas reserves, and the primary maritime link between Europe and Asia. Resources, differing geography, religious influences, and historical conflict have shaped this region for centuries and continue to do so today. In keeping with US national security strategy, Third Army supports U.S. Central Command through a theater security cooperation strategy that encompasses the four fundamentals of the National Military Strategy. Third Army maintains a continued forward presence, conducts joint and coalition exercises throughout the region, provides humanitarian assistance when needed, develops close partnerships with responsible nations, assists in demining efforts, and provides support to other military service components.

She has won eleven BAFTA TV Awards.  Early life and education  Shindler was born in Rochdale, England, the daughter of school teacher Gaye Shindler (n√©e Kenton) and solicitor Geoffrey Shindler. She grew up in the Whitefield area of Greater Manchester. Shindler attended Bury Grammar School from 1979 to 1987. She graduated with a bachelor's degree from Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, reading history at the University of Cambridge.  Career  Shindler first started out working as a sales manager in the sales department at Royal Court Theatre, which she chose because it was the home of new writing. She eventually started working as a script reader there but realised after a couple of years that she was more interested in the process of writing and working with writers in television versus theatre. Shindler then got a job at the BBC as a trainee script editor. Part of the responsibilities of that job in the early days was reading scripts that had been accumulating in the basement of the BBC for over 10 years. Shindler says that it was educational and she got a reputation as a hard worker from clearing this huge backlog. Shindler worked at Granada Television, for whom she first came to prominence as a script editor on the drama series Cracker (1993). She then went on to work as assistant producer on the BBC's Our Friends in the North (1996) and producer on Hillsborough, a dramatised account of the 1989 football stadium disaster. All three starred actor Christopher Eccleston, who subsequently featured in several dramas for Shindler's Red Production Company. In 1998, Shindler formed Red Production Company ‚Äì named after the nickname of Shindler's favourite football team, Manchester United ‚Äì in Manchester. Its first project, with Shindler producing, was writer Russell T Davies' gay drama serial Queer as Folk. Queer as Folk gave Red a reputation as producers of noteworthy drama, and they followed this up with subsequent series for Channel 4 such as Love in the 21st Century (1999) and Queer as Folk 2 (2000). Red has since produced dramas for BBC One, BBC Two, and ITV including Clocking Off (2000‚Äì03), Flesh and Blood (2002), Bob and Rose (2001) and The Second Coming (2003). In addition to the ITV series, Scott & Bailey, Shindler produced the award-winning Happy Valley, which is set in the Calder Valley and environs and stars Sarah Lancashire. Sally Wainwright credits Shindler with bringing Last Tango in Halifax to BBC TV. Other productions produced by Shindler at Red are 2016's The Five and 2017's Trust Me. In December 2013, it was announced that Shindler had sold a majority stake Red Production Company to the French media company StudioCanal. In 2016, Shindler went into business with author Harlan Coben (The Five) to form the U.S.-based production company, Final Twist Productions. Shindler is Co-CEO with Coben. StudioCanal will provide distribution services.  Personal life  Shindler lives and works in Manchester, England. Shindler is married to writer Matt Greenhalgh, with whom she has two daughters and a son.

F. Martin & Company. The model was manufactured from 1933 to 1942, and in a second production series since 1968. Martin originally made the guitar's sides and backs of Brazilian rosewood. Martins are ranked among the highest-quality, as well as among the most expensive guitars, and the D-45, regarded as one of the first \\"luxury guitars\\", was listed in 2011 as the most valuable production- model guitar. History =First series, until 1943= The first D-45 was a dreadnought guitar based on the Martin D-28 with luxury ornamentation (the \\"45\\" designation), made especially for Gene Autry who, in 1933, ordered \\"the biggest, fanciest Martin he could.\\"Johnston pp. 82‚Äì83. This guitar is now encased in glass in the Gene Autry Museum of the American West in Los Angeles, California.Boak p. 7. The next year, Martin made one for Jackie \\"Kid\\" Moore, a \\"12-year-old singing cowboy from Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\\"Soros. These first two had a 12-fret neck; most others (except for the 6th, made in 1937) made afterward had a 14-fret neck. Two more were made in 1936 and two again in 1937; the D-45 wasn't catalogued until 1938.Gruhn p. 421. Other versions included a D-45S (with a special neck, 1939) and a D-45L (left handed, 1940). The D-45 was the top model of the dreadnought line,Bacon p. 12. which also included the D-28 and D-18 models, priced much lower. In 1942, as a result of World War II, Martin officially ceased production of the D-45 (as well as other Martin models such as the archtops),Gruhn p. 450. though they made half a dozen units in February 1943.Johnston p. 90. This first series of D-45's consisted of only 91 instruments. =Second series, from 1968= The luxurious D-45 resembled the less ornate D-28 model enough to entice entrepreneurial guitar builders and craftsmen to modify the latter to look like the former by adding a pearl border and changing the stamps on the neck block, so they could sell them as the more expensive model. One of those craftsmen was Mike Longworth, a banjo player from Tennessee, who Martin hired specifically to bring the D-45 back. The new D-45, released in 1968, cost $1,200 and was the most expensive flat-top steel-string guitar made in the United States at the time. By 1969, Martin sold twice as many D-45s as during the entire 1933‚Äì1942 run; customers included David Crosby and Jimi Hendrix. In 1971, a 12-string model was made,Johnston p. 116‚Äì17. and in 1973, another one. Longworth also designed a more affordable model, the D-41, making sure that the pearl inlays were done in such a way that the guitar could not be modified to look like a D-45. Since 1968, Martin has produced a number of special versions, including the C.F. Martin Sr. Commemorative D-45 (200 guitars in 1996) and the C.F. Martin Sr. Deluxe D-45 (91 guitars in 1996).

He has also played in MLB for the San Diego Padres and the Boston Red Sox. He is a three-time All-Star. Through his philanthropic ventures, he is a regular finalist for the Heart and Hustle award and is considered by many to be one of the most respected players in MLB. Rizzo was selected by the Boston Red Sox in the sixth round of the 2007 MLB draft and became a top minor league prospect in the Red Sox organization. He was traded to the San Diego Padres after the 2010 season along with three other prospects in exchange for All-Star first baseman Adri√°n Gonz√°lez. He made his MLB debut in 2011 with San Diego. After being traded to the Cubs in 2012, he developed into an All-Star player, appearing in the All-Star Game three consecutive times, from 2014 through 2016, and winning the Silver Slugger Award, Gold Glove Award, Roberto Clemente Award, and won a World Series championship with the Cubs in 2016. Professional career =Boston Red Sox= Rizzo was a sixth-round draft choice out of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida in the 2007 Major League Baseball draft by the Red Sox. He was heading for Florida Atlantic University before he was drafted and signed, with a $325,000 signing bonus. Rizzo played in the Red Sox organization with the Gulf Coast League Red Sox, Greenville Drive, Salem Red Sox and the Portland Sea Dogs. Rizzo hit 12 home runs in 2009. In 2010, he hit a combined .260 with an on-base percentage (OBP) of .334 and a slugging percentage (SLG) of .480 along with 42 doubles, 25 home runs and 100 RBIs between stops at High-A Salem and Double-A Portland. Rizzo credited the easing of his swing and making better use of his legs for his power surge. San Diego Padres in 2011 =San Diego Padres= On December 6, 2010, Rizzo was traded along with Casey Kelly, Reymond Fuentes, and Eric Patterson to the Padres for three-time All-Star first baseman Adri√°n Gonz√°lez. Rizzo was considered the third best prospect (Kelly was #1) and the best power-hitting prospect in the Red Sox organization. Kevin Boles, Rizzo's manager at Salem, also previously managed Gonz√°lez in the minors. Boles said, \\"Rizzo reminds me a lot of Adri√°n Gonz√°lez ... Rizzo is a bigger kid and has a little more power, Adrian is a little more of a contact hitter, but they had very similar styles of play ... We thought very highly of Anthony Rizzo. He's going to be a heck of a player.\\" Padres General Manager Jed Hoyer expected either Rizzo or Kyle Blanks to eventually be the Padres major league starting first baseman. The Padres invited Rizzo as a non-roster player to their major league camp for 2011 Spring training. He started the 2011 season in Triple-A with the Tucson Padres. In his first 15 games, Rizzo hit .452 with six home runs and 24 RBIs. In May 2011, The San Diego Union-Tribune wrote that Rizzo's debut in the Major Leagues might be delayed by the Padres despite the club's hitting deficiencies due to cost considerations created by the \\"Super Two\\" exception for salary arbitration eligibility. The team cited Rizzo's lack of experience above Double-A and his limited exposure to left-handed pitching as benefits of his continuing to play in Tucson. Rizzo was called up to the majors after hitting .365 with an OPS of 1.159 along with 16 home runs and 63 RBI in 200 at-bats over 52 games in Tucson. The San Diego Union-Tribune called Rizzo \\"the most celebrated Padres call-up\\" since Roberto Alomar debuted with the team in 1988. Rizzo's promotion was prompted by the Padres' inadequate offensive production and fielding play of veterans at first base. In his debut on June 9, 2011, against the Washington Nationals, Rizzo struck out in his first at-bat, but then proceeded to hit a triple and score a run, helping the Padres to a 7‚Äì3 victory. He hit his first home run on June 11 against John Lannan. After three games he was 3-for-7 with a double, triple and a home run, while he demonstrated patience in drawing four walks for a .667 on-base percentage (OBP). On July 21, 2011 Rizzo was demoted back to Triple-A, and Blanks was promoted. Rizzo had struggled with only a .143 batting average and 1 home run, striking out 36 times in 98 at-bats. Hoyer said Rizzo \\"worked hard, never made excuses, and endeared himself to his teammates\\" during his initial stint in the majors. Rizzo was recalled to the majors on September 4 after finishing the season at Tucson batting .331 with 26 homers and 101 RBI in 93 games. He finished his first season in San Diego hitting only .141 with 46 strikeouts in 128 at-bats. Hoyer believed Rizzo would be the starting first baseman for the Padres in 2012 with Jes√∫s Guzm√°n as the second option. However, Yonder Alonso moved ahead of Rizzo on the team's depth chart after he was acquired by the Padres in December 2011 in a trade for Mat Latos. =Chicago Cubs= Chicago Cubs in 2012 On January 6, 2012, the Padres traded Rizzo and right-handed starting pitcher Zach Cates to the Chicago Cubs in exchange for right-handed starting pitcher Andrew Cashner and outfielder Kyung-Min Na. The deal was negotiated by Jed Hoyer, the Cubs' general manager. Hoyer had also drafted Rizzo while working as an assistant general manager for the Red Sox, and later acquired Rizzo while he was the Padres' general manager. He blamed himself for calling up Rizzo to the majors too early in San Diego. 2012 Rizzo started the 2012 season with the Triple-A Iowa Cubs. He again excelled in the minor leagues, batting .342 average with 23 home runs and 62 RBIs before being recalled by the Cubs on June 26. Similar to his call- up in San Diego, he was expected to help a struggling offense. He became the first player in Cubs history to have three game-winning RBIs in his first five games with the team. He hit seven homers in July, the most by a Cubs rookie in a calendar month since Mel Hall hit nine in August 1983. He also led National League (NL) rookies that month in homers, hits (32), RBIs (17), and total bases (55). He ranked second among NL rookies in runs scored (14), and he was third with a .330 batting average, .375 on-base percentage and .567 slugging percentage. He was named the league's July Rookie of the Month. 2013 On May 12, 2013, Rizzo agreed to a 7-year, $41 million deal. The deal included two club options that could extend the contract to 9 years and $73 million. He was named as the Cubs finalist for the national Heart and Hustle Award, and he was also named the Cubs finalist for the Roberto Clemente Award. Rizzo placed 2nd for the Gold Glove award for first basemen. Despite having an off year in 2013, Rizzo showed good power, belting 23 homers and 40 doubles in 606 at bats with a .233 batting average.Anthony Rizzo Statistics and History Baseball- Reference.com 2014 Rizzo had his fifth multi-homer game on May 30, and his second career walk-off home run on June 6.

Rizzo was one of six finalists for the Marvin Miller Man of the Year Award and was the Cubs nominee for the Roberto Clemente Award. After an extremely slow start in the postseason, Rizzo broke out of his slump in the NLCS. He was an integral part of the last three victories over the Los Angeles Dodgers and led the Cubs to their first World Series appearance since 1945. In the 2016 World Series, Rizzo scored 7 runs and had 5 RBIs, and helped the Cubs win their first World Series title since 1908. He also won the Esurance MLB Award for \\"Best Social Media Personality\\" and for \\"Best Play: Defense\\". Rizzo's defense saved 11 runs for the Cubs which led all MLB first basemen and he was recipient of his first Fielding Bible Award. He also won the fan vote for the Platinum Glove Award.

In the next seven games the Cubs went 5‚Äì2 and Rizzo hit 4 home runs (3 to lead off a game). By June 20, Rizzo had reached base in the first inning in his first seven games as a leadoff hitter and became the first player to reach safely to start the first inning in his first seven career leadoff appearances in over half a century of Major League baseball. He had 12 hits in 28 at bats with 10 RBIs and hit .430 during the streak. Rizzo finished second behind the Nationals Ryan Zimmerman in a tight race for starting NL first baseman in the 2017 All-Star Game. On September 2, Rizzo became the fourth Cubs players to hit at least 30 home runs, 30 doubles, and 100 RBIs in three or more seasons; the others were Hack Wilson, Billy Williams, and Sammy Sosa. For the season, he batted .273/.392/.507 with 32 home runs and 109 RBIs. He led the majors in hit by pitch, with 24. Rizzo had a disappointing postseason.

The greatest award you can win. It will go front and center in front of anything I've ever done.\\" 2018 On April 10, 2018, Rizzo was placed on the disabled list for the first time in his MLB career, due to a back issue. Prior to a May 23 game against the Cleveland Indians, Rizzo ranked fourth in Cubs franchise history with 17 HRs during interleague play.

The book examines the current state of higher education in the United States. The book and its findings received extensive national media coverage and sparked a debate about what undergraduate students learn once they get into college. The research draws on transcript data, the Collegiate Learning Assessment, and survey responses from more than 2,300 undergraduates at twenty-four institutions in their first semester and again at the end of their second year. The analysis reveals that 45 percent of these students demonstrated no significant improvement in a range of skills‚Äîincluding critical thinking, complex reasoning, and writing‚Äîduring their first two years of college.

The agency provided companies with an integrated approach to marketing to ethnic-specific audiences. The agency offered full-service marketing, advertising, media planning and buying, digital, events and promotions, and public relations for blue-chip clients including Verizon Wireless, Walmart, Chrysler Group LLC, U.S. Navy, Jeep, and OneMain Financial. In 2016, amidst the lawsuits against the company, both the Detroit and New York offices were closed. History GlobalHue was founded in 1988 by Don Coleman as Don Coleman Associates in Southfield, Michigan. In 1997, the firm transitioned to become Don Coleman Advertising, a firm specializing in marketing to African Americans. In 1999, True North Communications acquired a 49% stake in Don Coleman Advertising. Interpublic Group‚Äôs purchase of True North in 2001 brought along the minority interest in Don Coleman Advertising. In 2002, the firm acquired Hispanic agency Montemayor y Asociados and Asian-American agency Innovasia Communications to become GlobalHue, covering the three main U.S. ethnic segments. In 2003, GlobalHue CEO Coleman initiated a buyback from IPG to become the independent multicultural agency GlobalHue. In 2009, GlobalHue‚Äôs capitalized billings were $833.7 million. In 2009, GlobalHue was named ‚ÄúMulticultural Advertising Agency of the Decade‚Äù by Advertising Week. In 2010, Black Enterprise magazine named GlobalHue the BE 100 Advertising Agency of the Year, which was also awarded in 1998 and 2003. Total Market In 2009, as multicultural marketing was becoming increasingly mainstream, GlobalHue enlarged its focus to a category it calls ‚Äútotal market,‚Äù encompassing population segments of mixed ethnicities that are united on the basis of affinities, values and culture. Its ad campaigns for Chrysler Jeep, MGM Grand Detroit and the Bermuda Department of Tourism took this ‚Äútotal market‚Äù approach. Research In 2009, GlobalHue conducted a large survey of U.S. consumers and created a report on the findings. ‚ÄúMulticultural Nation: Convergence and Divergence in the New America‚Äù presented insights for marketing to a complex ethnic and cultural consumer population. The report confirmed that prevalent assumptions about segments, both Non-Hispanic Whites and ethnic, are becoming irrelevant and even risky for brand success in the diversified consumer market. Campaigns ;MGM Grand Detroit casino In the 2009 ‚ÄúTouch the Lion‚Äù campaign for MGM Grand Detroit casino, GlobalHue created billboards depicting golden female eyes flashing devilishly against a dark background and the casino lion logo. The ‚Äúdemon‚Äù eyes drew protest from the Detroit religious community, which in turn attracted media attention. The casino posted the biggest single-day ‚Äúcoin-in‚Äù in its history - $25.9 million ‚Äì after the campaign. The golden eyes theme was also used in print advertising. In 2010, the casino was the most profitable within the 12-casino MGM group and the largest Detroit area casino in gross revenue with 41.2 percent of the total gaming revenue. ;Bermuda Department of Tourism For the Bermuda Department of Tourism‚Äôs ‚ÄúFeel the Love‚Äù campaign for the total market, GlobalHue rebranded the island vacation destination as a weekend and short vacation option for a youthful, upscale ‚Äúurbane traveler‚Äù from major East coast cities, rather than day trippers on cruises. Before the campaign, visitors per year between 1990 and 2005 averaged 531,988. For three years during the campaign, the number of visitors averaged 620,215, representing a 16.6% increase over the previous 15 years. Mar 16, 2009: Don Coleman's GlobalHue is accused of ripping off the government of Bermuda by overbilling its $13 million tourism advertising contract. In a report by Bermuda auditor general Larry Dennis, GlobalHue is accused of: Overbilling the account by $1.8 million. http://www.cbsnews.com/news/globalhue-accused-of- overbilling-bermuda-account-agency-plays-race-card/. ;Chrysler 300C sedan The 2008 Chrysler 300C sedan campaign titled ‚ÄúThe Artist Inside You‚Äù was targeted at African American business people and entrepreneurs encompassing TV, print, radio and digital, featuring 300C cars as customized works of art. The campaign aired in January and February, the worst period in the automotive sales year. It was also challenged by poor public perceptions of American car quality and high regard for imports. In spite of that, the 300C had 1,100 dealer orders in nine days and sold out in record time. The strategy placed the vehicle at the center of custom car culture and its intersection with urban influencers. Through partnership with DUB magazine, a hip hop car culture brand, GlobalHue aligned the 300C with urban recording artists including Snoop Dogg and Sean Paul and sports stars such as Steve Smith and Corey Maggette, placing the vehicle in music videos, magazines, custom wheel ads, MTV Cribs, custom car shows and everywhere urban culture and custom cars came together. A key moment of the campaign occurred when the rapper 50 Cent called the Chairman of Chrysler to place an order and the recording of the call was leaked. This increased the 300C's status as an urban icon, superseding overall Chrysler brand awareness. Late in the model lifecycle, GlobalHue produced a more public and traditional campaign that acknowledged the car‚Äôs urban icon status. ;Verizon Wireless GlobalHue helped Verizon connect with African-Americans through a grassroots Gospel competition for print and television titled ‚ÄúHow Sweet the Sound‚Äù. The campaign drew on the community‚Äôs affinity for church participation. ;Walmart Walmart‚Äôs ad campaign supporting Black History Month in 2009 for TV, radio and digital with ‚ÄúGrandma‚Äôs Hands‚Äù drove positive awareness of the brand among African Americans; as a result, corporate sponsorship of year-long Black History initiatives is a permanent part of the brand‚Äôs marketing.\\"GlobalHue Video, 'The Heart', Celebrates Black History Month\\" (Video has been made private). YouTube.com. ;Chrysler Jeep(R) In 2009 GlobalHue was awarded the global Jeep(R) brand account by Chrysler Group. GlobalHue created a three-part phased campaign titled ‚ÄúI live. I ride. I am. Jeep.‚Äù which positioned Jeep as \\"a new way of working, playing and living always on your own terms.\\" The campaign included outdoor and transit, broadcast, print, digital and retail ads, and sought to expand the brand's appeal to a younger, more diverse and urban customer base. In the year of the campaign, Jeep posted double-digit sales growth and became the Chrysler Group's top selling brand. ;Jeep Compass GlobalHue's 2011 Jeep Compass campaign, titled \\"Bloodline\\", launched in February. \\"Bloodline\\" showcased the Jeep Compass in urban and off-road settings, and features the bloodlines of father-daughter athletes Muhammad and Laila Ali and father-son actors James and Scott Caan. Critics had not considered previous incarnations of the Compass as fully part of Jeep's \\"military and off-road heritage\\"; the new model received an updated available four-wheel drive powertrain and Jeep's \\"Trail Rated badge\\". The campaign declared the Compass's Jeep lineage. ;US Census 2010 For the 2010 US Census, GlobalHue was awarded the information campaign for Americans of Hispanic, Portuguese, African, African-Caribbean and African American ethnicity. Census‚Äô goal of 90 percent compliance was challenged by skepticism and distrust within these populations. With a message of strong community empowerment, use of non- traditional formats (such as lunch trucks, local restaurant menus, Webisodes mimicking popular telenovela), and a focus on clarifying the government commitment to confidentiality, GlobalHue‚Äôs strategy for the campaign ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs In Your Hands‚Äù helped this Census become one of the most successful ever conducted. The Hispanic campaign included an actual mural painted in Spanish Harlem, used as the basis of print and TV ads, referring to the historic means of communication in Hispanic societies. One TV spot for the Hispanic market, ‚ÄúCommunidad,‚Äù tested well, and was used in the general audience market. Midway through the campaign, 95 percent of Hispanics stated that their families intended to be counted.\\"The census asks you to make your voice count\\". latinminds.wordpress.com. February 2, 2012. Honors 2010 AdWeekMedia Multicultural Agency of the Decade Black Enterprise 100 Company of the Year Award Legal Troubles Don Coleman's GlobalHue is accused of ripping off the government of Bermuda by overbilling its $13 million tourism advertising contract. In a report by Bermuda auditor general Larry Dennis (pictured), GlobalHue is accused of: - Overbilling the account by $1.8 million. - Prebilling the government in violation of its own rules. - Not keeping invoices and billing records. - Not returning discounts and credits to the client. - Using a media buyer, Cornerstone, that charged commissions of up to 181 percent (Cornerstone's average commission charged was 51 percent, the report says, and the average media industry commissions tend to be about 15 percent.) Top executives of Coleman‚Äôs GlobalHue firm filed a class action lawsuit in Manhattan federal court claiming they have not been paid in months. The lawsuit claims the company‚Äôs employees, including its executive creative director and the former head of the Wal-Mart account, saw their last paychecks on March 15. Coleman ‚Äúrepeatedly assured employees that they would be paid for the work that they performed,‚Äù the lawsuit said. But the money never came through ‚Äî even as Coleman continues to assign them work, they said. One former employee told The Post that the first sign of trouble came in December when the company failed to make good on one of two monthly paychecks. At the time, the company blamed the problem on the bank. Eventually, Coleman held a staff meeting in New York where he confessed to ‚Äúfinancial challenges,‚Äù this person said. The 6‚Äô 2‚Äù linebacker explained that he was in the process of working with investors who would provide enough funding to make sure it never happened again, this person said. ‚ÄúWe were strung along for months and months,‚Äù this person said. The ad agency lost several big accounts this year including UB Bancorp, Autozone and AARP. FIAT Chrysler stopped working with GobalHue last year after five years. Separately, Coleman is being pursued in Manhattan federal court for $1.24 million by a real estate company that says GlobalHue broke its lease for two floors of office space at 123 Williams Street downtown. Coleman is also being sued in Manhattan federal court by Leonard Howard, who says he was ordered to drive Coleman‚Äôs daughter Kelli Coleman around town from morning to night without overtime. Howard said he was ordered to wait for Kelli Coleman while she ‚Äúspent long evenings in various clubs in New York City,‚Äù and then to pick her up the next day at 8 am to take her to the gym. He, too, stopped getting paid in March, he said.

Two cars are parked along the street in front. The Greenstone Building on Franklin Avenue downtown houses offices of 16 different federal government agencies. Before its completion in 2005, on time and under budget, those offices had been scattered in different locations. In 2007 it was certified LEED Gold by the Canadian Green Building Council for its environmental sustainability; among other features it generates some of its own electricity through building-integrated photovoltaics. It was the first building in the Canadian North to receive LEED certification of any level. =Mackenzie Place= Mackenzie Place, known locally as the High Rise, is a 17-storey building located in Hay River on the south side of Great Slave Lake.

An estimated height of is given for the building that was completed in 1975 and was until the building of Centre Square ‚Äì Northern Heights in 1996 the tallest building for 40 years. Unlike Yellowknife there are no other buildings in Hay River of any height so it dominates the skyline and is visible from away. =Northwest Territories Legislative Building= Northwest Territories Legislative Building The Northwest Territories Legislative Building is the home of the Government of the Northwest Territories.

Early life Blagoveshchensky was the son of a priest. He graduated from Alexander Nevsky religious school and from the St. Petersburg Theological Seminary, where he befriended the future writer Nikolai Pomyalovsky. After the death of Pomyalovsky, Blagoveshchensky was involved in preserving Pomyalovsky's heritage, writing the first biography of the writer, which is commonly included in editions of Pomyalovsky's collected works. Career After graduating from the seminary, Blagoveshchensky was apprenticed to the Archimandrite Porfiry, a famous archaeologist and orientalist, and went with him to Mount Athos and Jerusalem, where he stayed for nearly two years (1858-1859), recording his travelling experiences in notes and drawings. The first printed works of Blagoveshchensky were stories written in the wake of the journey: From the Memoirs of a Season at Jerusalem, In Thessaly and November. Upon his return to Russia in 1862, he began working for the journal Time edited by Fyodor Dostoyevsky and his brother Mikhail. Blagoveshchensky became known through his essays about clerical life: Athos, 1864 and Among the Pilgrims, 1871. His collection of essays Athos was printed in the magazine Russian Word, of which Blagoveshchensky became editor in 1864. In 1866 the magazine was banned, and Blagoveshchensky became the editor of the Women's Herald, along with Alexander Sheller, and later edited the journal The Week. At this time he published in Russian Word the novel Before the Dawn, which depicted the life of a raznochintsy democrat. Censors conceded they've made a grave mistake by letting part I (At the Graveyard, –ù–∞ –ø–æ–≥–æ—Å—Ç–µ, 1865) slip though. So, Part II (In the Capital, –í —Å—Ç–æ–ª–∏—Ü–µ, 1866) was promptly banned (for \\"graphically depicting the inner life of a religious sect\\") and the magazine received a 6 months suspension. Later life In 1869, Blagoveshchensky was stricken by paralysis. After partially recovering, he went on with his literary work, publishing his Essays from Working Life in the journal Notes of the Fatherland. Later, while being treated for his paralytic condition at the Caucasian Mineral Waters, he made friends with Count Loris-Melikov, at the invitation of whom he stayed in Vladikavkaz. Loris-Melikov gave Blagoveshchensky the post of Secretary of the Terek Statistical Committee. During his last years he was engaged in writing descriptions and collecting statistics relating to the Terek region. In 1880-1889 he edited Terskiye Vedomosti, a Terek-based newspaper. He died in Vladikavkaz in 1889. =English translations=A Visit to an Iron Foundry, from In the Depths, Raduga Publishers, Moscow, 1987.

Lee, American Big Bands (Hal Leonard Corporation, 2005) p50 was an American composer and big band musician. \\"That Lucky Old Sun\\", one of his better known works, was covered by many well-known artists. He often worked with Haven Gillespie and toured the nation with his group, \\"Beasley Smith and His Orchestra\\". Beasley Smith was born in McEwen, Tennessee. His parents were teachers. The family moved to Nashville when he was in elementary school. While in high school at Hume-Fogg in downtown Nashville, he formed an instrumental duo with fellow piano prodigy Francis Craig. They were later roommates at Vanderbilt University. Smith left college after two years to become a musician. He formed his first band around 1922, and by 1925 the Beasley Smith Orchestra was entertaining regularly at the Andrew Jackson Hotel in downtown Nashville. From 1927-1933, the group toured nationally. On October 5, 1925, both Smith and Craig performed with their bands during the opening-day broadcasts of radio station WSM. Wearying of the road, Smith accepted the job of music director at WSM in 1933. He starred on such radio shows as Mr. Smith Goes to Town, Sunday Down South and Tin Pan Valley. Lead vocalists who worked with Smith's band during his heyday included Snooky Lanson, Dottie Dillard, Kitty Kallen, and Dinah Shore. When Nashville started to become a recording center in the 1940s, Smith and Owen Bradley were key figures in assembling musicians for studio sessions. Smith began to blossom as a songwriter in the 1940s. He and Owen Bradley co-wrote \\"Night Train to Memphis\\" with Marvin Hughes. Roy Acuff sang the original version in 1942, and the upbeat song has been recorded consistently ever since. Beasley Smith and Francis Craig co-wrote \\"Beg Your Pardon,\\" and it became the 1948 follow-up hit to \\"Near You\\" for Craig's band. \\"That Lucky Old Sun\\" (1949), co-written with Haven Gillespie was a million- seller for Frankie Laine and is now considered a pop-music standard. In 1953, Smith left WSM to become the A&R; director and musical arranger for Dot Records. He and Dot founder, Randy Wood, also incorporated the Randy-Smith Music Publishing Company. Beasley Smith had written more than 100 songs by the time of his death in Nashville, Tennessee in 1968. In 1983, Beasley Smith was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame.

Highway 193 travels northwesterly towards the community of Story, reaching the community at just under 4 miles where it intersects the eastern terminus of Wyoming Highway 194. Leaving the eastern edge of Story, WYO 193 heads north to the unincorporated community of Banner where it reaches its northern terminus at U.S. Route 87 and its unsignedWyoming @ AARoads.com - Wyoming Highway 344 concurrent designation of Wyoming Highway 344. History In the late 1990s, a short section of US 87/WYO 344 between Interstate 90 north of Buffalo and Sheridan, at the Massacre Hill Historic Site, had been permanently closed due to recurring landslides. According to the Wyoming Department of Transportation, the stretch of roadway has ongoing and costly maintenance problems, with the most recent landslides closing the roadway as of the Spring of 1998. Because repairing the roadway could potentially damage the historic site, WYDOT recommends that through traffic use either Interstate 90 or Wyoming 193 as an alternate route. As a result of the landslide on US 87, Wyoming petitioned the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (or AASHTO) to reroute US 87 over Highway 193 in the late 1990s, however was denied. Consequently, a detour for US 87 follows WYO 193 since it is unlikely that US 87 will be reconstructed at its current location.Wyoming @ AARoads.com - Wyoming Routes 100-199  Major intersections  See also * References  External links Wyoming State Routes 100-199 *U.S. Route 87 *WYO 193 - US 87 to WYO 194 *WYO 193 - WYO 194 to US 87 Transportation in Johnson County, Wyoming Transportation in Sheridan County, Wyoming 193 ","title":"Wyoming Highway 193"},{"id":"30877508","text":"Julian High School may refer to: * Julian High School (Chicago), Chicago, Illinois * Julian High School (California), Julian, California ","title":"Julian High School"},{"id":"30877517","text":"Mildred Lewis \\"Miss Millie\\" Rutherford (July 16, 1851 ‚Äì August 15, 1928) was a prominent educator and author from Athens, Georgia. She served the Lucy Cobb Institute, as its head and in other capacities, for over forty years, and oversaw the addition of the Seney-Stovall Chapel to the school. Heavily involved in many organizations, she became the historian general of the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC), and a speech given for the UDC was the first by a woman to be recorded in the Congressional Record. She was a prolific non-fiction writer. Also known for her oratory, Rutherford was distinctive in dressing as a southern belle for her speeches. She held strong pro-Confederacy, proslavery views and opposed women's suffrage. Biography =Family background= Mildred Rutherford was born July 16, 1851, in Athens, Georgia;Case, 2009, 273. she was the daughter of Laura Cobb Rutherford (Howell and Thomas's sister) and Williams Rutherford, a professor of mathematics at the University of Georgia.Case, 2009, 275. Mildred Rutherford was the granddaughter of John Addison Cobb, whose involvement in agriculture (he owned a plantation with 209 slaves by 1840), the Georgia Railroad, and real estate made him \\"one of the area's wealthiest men\\". She was the niece of John's sons Howell Cobb, who served six terms as a Democratic Congressman and Speaker of the House for two years, and the lawyer Thomas R. R. Cobb, one of the founders of the University of Georgia School of Lawhe \\"codified Georgia's state laws\\", \\"wrote the wartime state constitution of 1861\\", and was a prominent proslavery propagandist; T. R. R. Cobb founded Lucy Cobb Institute in response to a letter that Laura Rutherford had sent anonymously to the local paper. =Education and career= Rutherford entered the Lucy Cobb Institute at the age of eight \\"in the school's first session\\". She was graduated from there at the age of sixteenRutherford, \\"Life Sketch of Miss Mildred Rutherford\\", 1923, 105-107. in 1868.Case, 2009, 276. Educator After teaching in Atlanta for eight years, Rutherford served as the principal of the Lucy Cobb Institute in Athens from 1880 to 1895Georgia Writers' Project, 1940, 155.Knight, 1913, 437-38. and lived in a house directly across the street until it burned c. 1926,Reap, 1982, 62. continuing to serve the school in various capacities for over forty years (including several years again at its head \\"with the title of 'president' signaling the school's college-level ambitions\\").Case, 2009, 281. According to Sarah Case, > Rutherford took over a struggling institution and rebuilt it into one of the > most prestigious schools for young women in Georgia. She immediately went to > work improving its academic standards, beautifying the physical plant, and > increasing enrollment. In agreeing to head the school, Rutherford had > insisted that the all-male board of directors cede to her its control of the > budget and power to hire and fire staff.Case, 2009, 276-277. She decided the students needed a chapel and had them write seeking funding for one. In 1881, Nellie Stovall wrote \\"a beautiful and girlish letter\\"Blandin, 1909, 149-152. to George I. Seney, who responded with $10,000 in funding (and a challenge to the town for an additional $4,000)Case, 2009, 277. for the structure, an octagonal red brick building called the Seney- Stovall Chapel.Jones, 1889, 110-112. Case further describes Lucy Cobb under Rutherford's direction: > Rutherford's deep concern with propriety and feminine modesty should not > obscure the fact that the school prepared women for more than traditional > domestic roles. Lucy Cobb recognized that many of its alumnae would seek > employment, and by teaching students marketable, and at the same time, > respectable, skills, as well as genteel decorum and dress, Lucy Cobb created > a new image of elite white single womanhood that combined aspects of the new > woman and the southern belle, what I call the \\"new belle.\\" As early as 1885, > a Lucy Cobb commencement speaker argued that women ought to be allowed into > more professions.Case, 2009, 279. Orator and historian Rutherford was an accomplished public speakershe ofttimes dressed as a southern belle when oratingwho addressed a great number of local organizations, including the YMCA, the Ladies Memorial Association (for which she served as president),Thomas, 2009, 125-126. and the Athens chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC), and in November 1912 addressed the national assembly of the UDC as their historian general.Hale, 2009, 173-201. She \\"became perhaps the best-known amateur historian in the early twentieth century for her extensive writings and speeches, her historical journal, published from 1923 to 1927, and her promotion of historical work among the UDC as that organization's Historian General from 1911 to 1916\\".Hale, 1998, 61-62. She gave \\"the first speech by a woman to be printed in the Congressional Record\\" in 1916 at a UDC convention.Thomas, 2009, 130. Death and legacy In 1927 Rutherford became seriously ill. Late on Christmas night, as she convalesced, her house suffered a devastating fire, consuming many of her personal papers and belongings, including \\"most of her private collection of Confederate artifacts\\".Case, 2009, 289. She died on August 15, 1928, and was interred in Oconee Hill Cemetery, in East Hill, one of the two original sections of the cemetery.Marshall, 2009, 231-232. Her great niece Mildred Seydell was named in her honor and became a well-known journalist, one of the first in Georgia, and a nationally syndicated columnist. Rutherford has a student dormitory named after her at the University of Georgia. Views Mildred Rutherford, circa, 1897 Rutherford was Baptist with a strong faith and expressed a \\"deep preoccupation with propriety and morality\\" in her textbooks, criticizing \\"authors who openly portrayed sexuality or themselves lived in ways Rutherford found immoral\\".Case, 2009, 278. She lauded the works of Southern writers and female writers. According to University of Georgia historian Ann E. Marshall, she was a \\"tireless advocate of the 'Lost Cause' version of southern history\\" (referring to the Lost Cause of the Confederacy). Goals of her writing included \\"establishing the South's contribution to United States history, legitimizing secession, and idealizing the antebellum plantation\\",Case, 2009, 283. and she defended American slavery, thinking its only problem was the burden it put upon the white slaveholders. She viewed \\"true history\\"the way she saw, defined, and proselytized itas a potential common ground between North and South, and also believed it to be a potent political weapon in support of the causes she espoused.Case, 2002, 599. She was willing to alter the historical record to make her point‚Äîin a speech in Dallas in 1916 she claimed that \\"the negroes in the South were never called slaves. That term came in with the abolition crusade,\\" even though her own state of Georgia used the word \\"slaves\\" in its official Declaration of Causes of Secession. In 1914, she joined the Georgia Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage and became a \\"vocal opponent\\" of women's suffrage and the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which was ratified on August 18, 1920.McRae, 1998, 801-828. She viewed suffrage as \\"not a step toward equality, but rather a way of robbing women of the only power they truly heldthat of feminine influence and persuasion within their families. Rutherford never reconciled this view with the fact that she herself was one of Georgia's most publicly active and well-known women of her time\\".Case, 2009, 285. Her opposition was \\"formidable\\": Dolly Blount Lamar and Rutherford headed the organization, and in 1919 this \\"conservative state\\" became the nation's first to reject the amendment. Case asserts that while \\"Rutherford reserved her strongest resistance for the suffrage amendment,\\" she \\"opposed all constitutional amendments, including prohibition, despite her anti-alcohol sentiments, on the basis of limiting federal power\\".

The Russian Post, 2010. Irina Bugrimova (March 13, 1910 ‚Äì February 20, 2001) was the first female lion tamer in the Soviet Union. Called a \\"circus legend\\" by sources such as the BBC, Bugrimova was the first woman in Russia and the then-Soviet Union to work with lions, tigers, and ligers in a variety of performing acts, and trained more than 70 big cats during her career. Biography Irina Nikolajewna Bugrimova was born in Kharkiv, Russian Empire (now Ukraine) on March 13, 1910. The daughter of a veterinarian and a ballet dancer, she excelled in athletics as a child, including as a champion speed skater. She eventually parlayed her talent into a career as a motorcyclist and gymnast at circuses, among other things. She died in Moscow. Animal training In 1929, Bugrimova transferred to the Moscow State Circus, and it was there she met the animal trainers Nikolaj Gladilstchikow and Boris Eder, who taught her the practice. She made her debut ten years later in 1939, and designed many of her own tricks, such as lions tightrope walking, acts involving motorcycles, and a giant swing which she would leap from with a cat. In one stunt, a lion would run in front of her motorcycle as if in fear, while another would jump onto the back of her seat to ride along. She flirted with danger by swinging on a giant swing with a lion. At the end of the routine the two jumped off the swing together and she fed the animal a piece of meat with her teeth. Her act ended with the lions laying down as she cavorted on a carpet of cats. Later she worked with the Circus Humberto in Czechoslovakia and the East German Circus. Bugrimova performed in circuses well into her 60s, and was decorated several times by the Soviet state. Today there is also an avenue named in her honor in her hometown of Kharkiv, in front of the city's circus.

A differential transfers engine torque to the wheels. Torque vectoring technology provides the differential with the ability to vary the torque to each wheel. This method of power transfer has recently become popular in all- wheel drive vehicles. Some newer front-wheel drive vehicles also have a basic torque vectoring differential. As technology in the automotive industry improves, more vehicles are equipped with torque vectoring differentials. This allows for the wheels to grip the road for better launch and handling. History The phrase \\"Torque Vectoring\\" was first used by Ricardo in 2006 SAE 2006-01-0818 in relation to their driveline technologies. The torque vectoring idea builds on the basic principles of a standard differential. A torque vectoring differential performs basic differential tasks while also transmitting torque independently between wheels. This torque transferring ability improves handling and traction in almost any situation. Torque vectoring differentials were originally used in racing. Mitsubishi rally cars were some of the earliest to use the technology. The technology has slowly developed and is now being implemented in a small variety of production vehicles. The most common use of torque vectoring in automobiles today is in all-wheel drive vehicles. Functional description The idea and implementation of torque vectoring are both complex. The main goal of torque vectoring is to independently vary torque to each wheel. Differentials generally consist of only mechanical components. A torque vectoring differential requires an electronic monitoring system in addition to standard mechanical components. This electronic system tells the differential when and how to vary the torque. Due to the number of wheels that receive power, a front or rear wheel drive differential is less complex than an all-wheel drive differential. The impact of torque distribution is the generation of yaw moment arising from longitudinal forces and changes to the lateral resistance generated by each tyre. Applying more longitudinal force reduces the lateral resistance that can be generated. The specific driving condition dictates what the trade-off should be to either damp or excite yaw acceleration. The function is independent of technology and could be achieved by driveline devices for a conventional powertrain, or with electrical torque sources. Then comes the practical element of integration with brake stability functions for both fun and safety. =Front/rear wheel drive= Torque vectoring differentials on front or rear wheel drive vehicles are less complex, yet share many of the same benefits as all-wheel drive differentials. The differential only varies torque between two wheels. The electronic monitoring system only monitors two wheels, making it less complex. A front-wheel drive differential must take into account several factors. It must monitor rotational and steering angle of the wheels. As these factors vary during driving, different forces are exerted on the wheels. The differential monitors these forces, and adjusts torque accordingly. Many front-wheel drive differentials can increase or decrease torque transmitted to a certain wheel. This ability improves a vehicle's capability to maintain traction in poor weather conditions. When one wheel begins to slip, the differential can reduce the torque to that wheel, effectively braking the wheel. The differential also increases torque to the opposite wheel, helping balance the power output and keep the vehicle stable. A rear-wheel drive torque vectoring differential works similarly to a front-wheel drive differential. =All-wheel drive= Most torque vectoring differentials are on all-wheel drive vehicles. A basic torque vectoring differential varies torque between the front and rear wheels. This means that, under normal driving conditions, the front wheels receive a set percentage of the engine torque, and the rear wheels receive the rest. If needed, the differential can transfer more torque between the front and rear wheels to improve vehicle performance. For example, a vehicle might have a standard torque distribution of 90% to the front wheels and 10% to the rear. When necessary, the differential changes the distribution to 50/50. This new distribution spreads the torque more evenly between all four wheels. Having more even torque distribution increases the vehicle's traction. There are more advanced torque vectoring differentials as well. These differentials build on basic torque transfer between front and rear wheels. They add the capability to transfer torque between individual wheels. This provides an even more effective method of improving handling characteristics. The differential monitors each wheel independently, and distributes available torque to match current conditions. =Electric vehicles= In an electric vehicle all-wheel drive can be implemented with two independent electric motors, one for each axle. In this case the torque vectoring between the front and rear axles is just a matter of electronically controlling the power distribution between the two motors, which can be done on a millisecond scale. Torque vectoring is even more effective if it is actuated through two electric motor drives located on the same axle, as this configuration can be used for shaping the vehicle understeer characteristic and improving the transient response of the vehicle.Goggia, T., Sorniotti, A., De Novellis, L., Ferrara, A., Gruber, P., Theunissen, J., Steenbeke, D., Knauder, B., Zehetner, J.

The detailed control system of the torque vectoring is described in the doctoral thesis of Dr.-Ing. Michael Graf.Graf M.

Energy efficiency can be used as a criterion for allocating the torques among the individual wheels.De Novellis, L., Sorniotti, A., Gruber, P.

Once, Bunjil asked him to come and live with him, but Balayang replied that Bunjil's country was too dry and that Bunjil ought to come and live with him instead. This upset Bunjil, who sent his two helpers, Djurt-djurt the nankeen kestrel and Thara the quail hawk, after Balayang. They set fire to the bat's country and Balayang and his family were scorched and turned permanently black. Because of his black colouring, Balayang was associated with Crow, and thus belonged to the moiety in opposition to Eaglehawk. Another story credits him with creating or finding Crow women (and thus marriage partners for the Eaglehawk moiety). One day Balayang was amusing himself by thumping the surface of the water, causing it to thicken into mud. Something stirred underneath the mud and, probing with a branch, he found two women. He called one Kunnawarra (\\"black swan\\") and the other Kururuk (\\"native companion\\"). He took them to Bunjil, who gave them as wives to the men he had created.

He arrived in the colony in 1636 with the rest of his family, which included his elder brother Michel Leneuf, and together they, alongside their in-laws the Legardeurs, were the first of the French nobility to permanently settle in New France. He married Marguerite, the sister of Pierre Legardeur de Repentigny, while in France, and they were the parents of several children, including the future Governor of Acadia, Michel Leneuf de La Valli√®re et de Beaubassin. Biography He acquired and was granted several fiefs, and became one of the principal landholders and businessman in Canada, alongside his elder brother Michel. They both were two of the twelve co- founders and directors of the Communaut√© des Habitants, which was a fur company that attempted to succeed the Company of One Hundred Associates in 1645, but reverted back under direct control of the Crown after two years.

The settlement act ended a lawsuit by the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe to recover 800 acres of their 1666 reservation in Ledyard, Connecticut. The state sold this property in 1855 without gaining ratification by the Senate. In a federal land claims suit, the Mashantucket Pequot charged that the sale was in violation of the Nonintercourse Act that regulates commerce between Native Americans and non-Indians.W. Pequot Tribe of Indians v. Holdridge Enters., Inc., No. H76-cv-193 (D. Conn.). The settlement act appropriated $900,000 to buy the disputed lands and transferred those lands and the state reservation in trust to the Department of Interior of the federal government. The settlement act permits the state of Connecticut to exercise civil and criminal, but not regulatory, jurisdiction over the lands. Gaining federal recognition and sovereign control of their land enabled the Mashantucket Pequot to develop gaming on their reservation, specifically, the Foxwoods Resort Casino. It is the largest casino in the world by revenue and floor space, and by 2007 was the most profitable. It has struggled financially in the second decade of the 21st century., 2001, at 16-17.

The English colonists divided surviving captives, assigning them to their allies, the Mohegan and Narragansett tribes., 2001, at 25-40. In 1651, John Winthrop the Younger persuaded the Connecticut Colony to create a 500-acre reservation for the Pequot in Noank, removing them from their previous places of residence., 2001, at 41. In 1666, the Connecticut General Assembly voted to create a 2,000-acre reservation for the \\"western\\" Pequot (the group previously in the custody of the Mohegan) in Ledyard, Connecticut; the eastern Pequot were given 280 acres in present-day North Stonington, Connecticut., 2001, at 41-42; , 2004, at 37. By 1790 (the year that Congress passed the first Nonintercourse Act), the Ledyard reservation had been reduced to 1,000 acres, due to sales by white supervisors., 2004, at 37. In 1855, Connecticut sold 800 of the remaining acres at $10/acre, putting the money into a state-administered trust account for the Pequot people., 2001, at 51; , 2004, at 37. In the 1970s, David Crosby of Pine Tree Legal Assistance, a non- profit law firm that was litigating Joint Tribal Council of the Passamaquoddy Tribe v.

As advised by Crosby, in 1974 the Pequot established a non- profit corporationWestern Pequot Indians of Connecticut, Inc., 2004, at 25. In April 1975, Crosby finished his research and presented his findings to the Pequot. Litigation The Western Pequot of Connecticut filed suit in May 1976 in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut., 2004, at 38. The case was assigned to Judge Mosher Joseph Blumenfeld., 2004, at 52. The named plaintiffs were the Western Pequot Tribe and its leader Richard \\"Skip\\" Hayward; among the named defendants were Holdridge Enterprises and its president, David Holdridge. The 800-acre claim included an estimated 12 to 35 private landowner defendants., 2001, at 82; , 2004, at 52. The state of Connecticut was sued, and declined requests from the defendants to become involved in the litigation., 2004, at 42. One of the lawyers for the defendants was Jackson King, a partner at Brown, Jacobson, Jewett & Laudone. King became involved in the case after being contacted by one of the named defendants, who had served with him on a local land conservation commission, contacted him. King had finished first in his class at University of Connecticut School of Law, and was well regarded., 2004, at 39. Federal recognition ;HUD The Pequot pursued federal recognition in parallel with their land claims litigation. They applied to the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to participate in HUD's Indian housing assistance program., 2004, at 44. In March 1976, Connecticut Governor Ella Grasso certified to HUD that the Pequots were \\"an autonomous unit or government\\" for the purposes of the revenue-sharing program., 2004, at 45. At this time, the tribe had 32 members. ;BIA On January 15, 1979, the Pequot filed a preliminary petition for federal tribal recognition with the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA)., 2004, at 49. Historian Jack Campisi, who had previously worked as an expert witness with attorney Tom Tureen (known for his role in Joint Tribal Council of the Passamaquoddy Tribe v. Morton (1975) and other Nonintercourse Act claims), prepared the petition. The Pequot did not submit a full recognition application to the BIA until mid-1983. Settlement Act Senator Lowell P. Weicker, Jr.,(R-CT), who introduced the Settlement Act, later as governor opposed development of the Foxwoods Casino and Resort. Following Congressional passage of the Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act in 1980, attorney Tom Tureen turned his attention to the Mashantucket Pequot case., 2001, at 85. In October 1981, Tureen approached King (the defendants' lawyer) regarding a federally legislated settlement., 2004, at 53. Tureen proposed that the state of Connecticut turn over the reservation to the federal government, and that the federal government pay the property owners fair market value to include their land in the federal reservation., 2004, at 60. As part of the deal, the state would retain civil and criminal, but not regulatory, authority of the reservation. The state approved the settlement in June 1982. The federal settlement bill included a $900,000 appropriation, the appraisal value of the 800 acres, which the Pequot would use to buy the land from the landowner defendants. The legislation also provided that the landowners would not have to pay capital gains tax as long as they reinvested the money in real estate., 2004, at 61. Senator Lowell P. Weicker, Jr. (R-CT) delivered the draft bill to the Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs. Peter Taylor, the committee's general counsel, noticed that the bill did not limit the amount or location of the lands that the Pequot could buy with the settlement funds. Tureen and King prepared a map in accordance with Taylor's wishes., 2004, at 62-63. Senator William Cohen (R-ME), the chairman of the committee, began hearings on July 14, 1982., 2004, at 63. William Coldiron, the solicitor general of the Department of the Interior, testified against the bill, which he viewed as circumventing the BIA's recognition process and as costing too much money. Cohen criticized Coldiron for lacking enough knowledge about the Pequot., 2004, at 64. Representative Sam Gejdenson (D-CT) also supported the bill., 2004, at 65. The House passed the bill, H.R. 6612, on October 1, 1982, and the Senate passed a different version on December 21., 2004, at 69. The compromise version was passed by the Senate on February 24, 1982 by voice vote, and by the House on March 22. However, President Ronald Reagan vetoed the bill, opining that the state should pay more of the cost and that the Pequot may not meet the BIA's definition of a tribe., 2001, at 87; , 2004, at 69. Tureen, King, Hayward, and Sandy Cadwalader of the Indian Rights Association began lobbying for a veto override., 2004, at 70. Once 67 Senators had committed to voting for the billenough to have been the first veto override of Reagan's presidencya compromise was proposed whereby Connecticut would contribute $200,000 toward road improvements (which became known as \\"the veto road\\")., 2001, at 88; , 2004, at 71. At a new set of hearings in July 1983, Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs John W. Fritz declared that the administration would not object to the new bill., 2004, at 71. Reagan signed the new bill, S. 1499, into law on October 18, 1983., 2004, at 72. Since 1983, the Mashuntucket Pequots have appeared on every list of federally recognized tribes published by the Department of the Interior in the Federal Register.75 Fed. Reg. 60,810 (2010); 74 Fed.

Aftermath The Mohegan Sun was developed by the Mohegan Nation, after winning a similar settlement of an aboriginal title lawsuit and gaining federal recognition in 1994.For an account of the Pequot involvement in the Mohegan settlement, see , 2001, at 216-29. =Bingo= On April 30, 1984, the Pequot corporate body voted 12-1, with two abstentions, to approve construction of a high-stakes bingo operation on their reservation., 2004, at 76. Barry Margolin, Tureen's law partner, took the lead in representing the Pequot in this matter., 2004, at 78. After Connecticut's chief state criminal attorney wrote the tribe a letter threatening to shut down the bingo operation if opened as planned, the Pequot filed for a federal preliminary injunction. Judge Peter C. Dorsey (who, as a magistrate, had ruled favorably for the Pequot in their land claim) granted the injunction., 2001, at 107; , 2004, at 79, 88, 106. Dorsey granted a permanent injunction on January 9, 1986, holding that Connecticut's bingo laws did not apply to the reservation.Mashantucket Pequot Tribe v. McGuigan, 626 F. Supp. 245 (D. Conn. 1986). The bingo hall opened on July 5, 1986., 2004, at 88. =Cabazon Band and the IGRA= The Supreme Court's ruling in California v. Cabazon Band of Mission Indians (1987), which upheld the right of the tribe to develop a gaming casino on their reservation, was a catalyst to the Pequot's ambition to upgrade their bingo hall and develop a gaming casino., 2004, at 101. In the wake of the Supreme Court decision, Congress passed the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) on October 17, 1988. Tureen and Margolin concluded that the IGRA required Connecticut to negotiate a tribal- state compact with the Pequot in good faith because of a state statute that permitted non-profits, with a state license, to hold \\"Las Vegas nights\\" twice a year., 2004, at 102-04. The state statute in question had been lobbied for by Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) in 1987., 2001, at 123-26. At the request of Governor William O'Neill, acting state attorney general Clarine Riddle prepared a memorandum highlighting the differences between high school students playing casino games for monopoly money and a full-scale, for-profit casino. O'Neill denied the Pequot's request., 2001, at 126-28. =Development of Foxwoods= When the state failed to negotiate, on November 3, 1989, the tribe sued the state under a provision of the IGRA that permitted such suits if state did not negotiate in good faith within 180 days., 2004, at 104-06. (This part of IGRA was subsequently declared unconstitutional by the US Supreme Court in Seminole Tribe v. Florida (1996.) The case was docketed again before Judge Dorsey., 2004, at 106. Dorsey granted the tribe summary judgment in May 1990, ordering the state to resume negotiations and conclude a compact within 60 days.Mashantucket Pequot Tribe v. Connecticut, 737 F. Supp. 169 (D.Conn. 1990), aff'd, 913 F.2d 1024 (2d Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 975 (1991). The Second Circuit upheld Dorsey's ruling on September 4, 1990. The compact was forwarded to Secretary of Interior Manuel Lujan, Jr. on October 1990 for his approval., 2004, at 108. On April 22, 1991, the Supreme Court declined to grant certiorari to the state's appeal from the Second Circuit's ruling. Former Senator Weicker replaced O'Neil as governor in January 1991. Weicker was opposed to gambling, and was advised that repealing the \\"Las Vegas night\\" statute was the only way to avoid a Pequot casino., 2004, at 109-12. Moreover, Weicker would have had to repeal the law before Secretary Lujan gave final approval to the compact., 2004, at 115. The Mashantucket Pequot retained lobbyists, reached out to charity groups that used the \\"Las Vegas night\\" statute, and brought in Native American Rights Fund executive director John Echohawk to defeat Weicker's proposed bill., 2004, at 115-17. Weicker's bill prevailed by 18-17 with one absent in the Connecticut Senate., 2004, at 117. However, the House rejected the bill by more than 20 votes., 2004, at 117-20. Secretary Lujan approved the compact on May 31, 1991.56 Fed. Reg. 24,996 (1991). The Pequot signed a financing agreement with Malaysian partners on February 25, 1991 for the construction of Foxwoods Resort Casino., 2001, at 141-64; , 2004, at 126-27. Foxwoods opened on February 12, 1992., 2004, at 131. That year, even though slot machines had yet to be installed, the 245-member Pequot tribe earned $148 million in revenue and $51 million in profit from Foxwoods., 2004, at 132. Threatened with the possibility of competition from non-Indian gambling, the Pequot offered the state a share of slot machine revenue in October 1992 (the issue of slot machines had been left for the courts in the original compact). A provision of the agreement provided that if slot machine gambling were to be legalized in the state, the revenue sharing would cease., 2001, at 165-81; , 2004, at 135. On January 13, 1993, the tribe and state announced a deal that would give the state 25% of gross slot machine revenue, guaranteeing at least $100M/year., 2004, at 140. By 1998, Foxwoods was generating $1 billion in revenue and $152 million in net income for the tribe., 2004, at 191. =Reservation expansion= Starting in 1993, the Pequot began negotiations to purchase additional lands and convey those lands to the Department of Interior in trust under the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934. Local towns sued the tribes to prevent this., 2004, at 141-47, 219-20. In 1996 and 1998, the Interior Department, under Secretary Bruce Babbitt, approved the tribe's request to put and , respectively, into trust.63 Fed. Reg. 33,945 (1998); 61 Fed. Reg. 33,764 (1996).

In 1770 he was appointed parish clerk of St. Martin's, which office he held until his death. He early turned his attention to the study of local history and antiquities, and in 1777, at the age of thirty-seven, published his first work, The Memoirs of the Town and County of Leicester, which was issued at Leicester in six duodecimo volumes. In 1789 he brought out a quarto volume of Select Views in Leicestershire, from Original Drawings, containing historical and descriptive accounts of castles, religious houses, and seats in that county, and in the following year a Supplementary Volume to the Leicestershire Views, containing a Series of Excursions to the Villages and Places of Note in that County.

She has worked with different populations with her strong belief in using art as a form of language.Silver, R. (2001). Art as language: Access to thoughts and feelings through stimulus drawings. Philadelphia: Psychology Press. She has created tests to screen for cognitive and emotional disturbances in children with hearing impairments, stroke patients and individuals with learning disabilities and those with emotional issues such as aggression and depression. Through her work in the field, Silver has contributed over eighty published works, including journal articles, books and other publications, and she has presented at over seventy conferences and universities. A collection of her journal articles is archived with the American Art Therapy Association, The National Museum of Women in the Arts and with the Smithsonian Institution. Two traveling exhibits, held by the Smithsonian Institution, circulated her work with artwork from both children and adults with hearing impairments - \\"Shout In Silence\\" - and adult stroke patients - \\"Art As Language\\". Silver has been an honorary member of the American Art Therapy Association (AATA) since 1983, and has earned awards for her research in the field in 1976, 1989, 1992 and 1996. Silver is an honorary lifetime member of AATA and has been further honored by AATA creating an award in her name, the Rawley Silver Award for Excellence. This award is given to one student every year that has been accepted into an art therapy program and has at least a 3.5 grade point average. Silver finds passion and appreciation with the use of art in art therapy within her assessments and in her own artwork. She urges that a passion for art does not have to lose its importance while pursuing a career path as an art therapist.Silver, R. (2002). Three Art Assessments. New York: Brunner-Routledge. Her artwork creations consist of portraits including poetic verses as well as nature related paintings. Some of these were exhibited at the George Washington University Art Therapy Gallery during summer 2014.Silver, R. (1998). Retrieved October 5, 2010, from Rawley Silver, ed.d., art-bc: www.rawleysilver.com Life and work Silver graduated from Cornell University in 1939 with a bachelor's degree in philosophy and studio art. She went on to study at the School of Social Work at Smith College from 1940 to 1941. Silver worked as a medical social worker and volunteered to work in a school that had no art teacher. In 1962, she attended the Teachers College of Columbia University, where she received her Doctorate of Education and Masters‚Äô of Arts degree in fine arts and fine arts education in 1966. During this time, Silver began working with individuals with disabilities, especially children with auditory disorders. Silver discovered at this time that communication is a problem not only for those persons who have language disorders, but also for those who work with them. Temporarily deaf herself during a period in her life, she was able to personally understand that difficulty in the communication. Due to this barrier, she began utilizing stimulating drawings in her work with patients.Silver, R. (1978). Developing cognitive and creative skills through art. Baltimore: University Park Press. Due to this barrier, she began utilizing stimulating drawings in her work with patients. In her book, Art as Language, Silver stated one could use drawings to bypass language problems and assess cognitive skills. She went on to conduct research projects on this subject, supported by the U.S. Office of Education and the National Institute of Education, among others. Silver Drawing Assessments During her work in the field, Silver created two assessments: the Silver Drawing Test and Draw a Story. Her assessments use stimulus drawings to bypass language disorders in assessing cognitive skills, and to provide access to emotions and attitudes. The Silver Drawing Test, which measures perceptions essential to mathematics and reading, has three subtests: drawing from imagination, drawing from observation and predictive drawing.Silver, R. (2002). Three Art Assessments. New York: Brunner-Routledge. The Drawing from Imagination test in the Silver Drawing Test is similar to Silvers‚Äô assessment, Draw a Story. The Silver Drawing Test and Draw a Story assessments provide quantitative findings of reliability, validity, normative data and outcome studies that assess changes in cognitive skills or emotional states following remedial programs. In addition, they provide case studies and drawing responses by children, adolescents and adults in clinical and non- clinical populations. The assessments use stimulus drawings to elicit responses. Responses are scored on 5-point rating scales that range from low to high levels of Ability to Select, Combine, and Represent, and from strongly negative to strongly positive Emotional Content, Self-Image, and when appropriate, Use of Humor. The findings, by mental health professionals and educators not only in the USA but also in Europe, Asia and South America, include age, gender and cultural difference and similarities. The three subtests of the Silver Drawing Test assess the three concepts said to be fundamental in reading and mathematics: Drawing from Imagination assesses concepts of class inclusion; Predictive Drawing, concepts of sequential order; and Drawing from Observation, concepts of space. The Draw A Story assessment is used to screen for masked depression that may lead to suicide, and reactive or predatory aggression that may lead to violence in schools. Predictive Drawing assesses clients' grasp of the concepts of sequential order, horizontality and verticality. In this test, there are three separate tests. One, which measures sequential order, shows an ice cream float in a clear glass and six empty glasses. The client is directed to draw lines in the empty glasses to show how the glasses would appear if the float were drunk with a straw. The next one, which measures horizontality, shows two empty bottles. One is upright, and the other tilted to the side. The client draws lines in the bottles to show where water would be with the bottles filled up halfway. The last test, which measures verticality, presents the clients with a drawing of a house sitting on top of a mountain. Clients draw the way the house would look if it moved to the spot marked with an ‚ÄúX‚Äù on the slope. Once these are finished, the assessment is complete. The Draw a Story test, used most often on children and adolescents, is used to screen for depression by looking at negative and positive themes to responses. The client chooses two pictures from two forms that contain stimulus drawings, and imagine a story between them. They are then directed to draw a story between them.

The earliest human presence on the site, which was situated on the edge of a coastal lagoon, with easy access to the sea and numerous natural resources, dates back to the Neolithic, between the 7th and 5th millennia BC. At a later date, a settlement of the final Neolithic period continued into the Bronze Age; occupation at the site is attested for the Protoapennine, Apennine, and Subapennine phases of the Italian Bronze Age. During the Bronze Age, a significant settlement arose that had contacts with the civilizations of the Aegean; these contacts are most visible during the Subapennine phase, when fragments of Mycenaean ceramics are found at the site. From the beginning of the Protoapennine phase, there is evidence for the extraction of purple dye from murex shells and for pressing of olives to extract olive oil. The purple dye production, starting around 1800 BC, is the earliest yet attested in Italy. This dye production increased through the 14th century BC, but sharply dropped off by the 12th century in the Subapennine phase. Some areas near the fortifications and on the shore of the lagoon were dedicated both to the processing and storage of cereals and to the extraction of purple dye; these activities were later moved within the settlement. The site was defended by dry stone fortification walls. The site is currently under periodic excavation by a team from Sapienza University of Rome, under the direction of Alberto Cazzella.

It is a dialect of Standard ML, augmented with support for lazy evaluation, concurrency (multithreading and distributed computing via remote procedure calls) and constraint programming. Overview Alice extends Standard ML in a number of ways that distinguish it from its predecessor. Alice provides concurrency features as part of the base language through the use of a future type that represents a value being provided by an independent thread of execution. A thread that uses a future value will block on an attempt to access the value until the thread performing it has completed the computation. A related concept is also provided termed a promise, allowing a thread to provide a future value that it will compute to another thread. Future and promise typed variables are used to implement data-flow synchronizing. Like the Haskell functional language, Alice provides facilities to allow a lazy evaluation strategy in programs, unlike the traditional eager evaluation strategy of Standard ML. While Haskell uses the lazy model by default, Alice uses an eager evaluation model by default, needing an explicit programming statement for a computation to evaluate lazily. The Alice implementation from Saarland University uses the Simple Extensible Abstract Machine (SEAM) virtual machine. It is free software, and features just-in-time compilation to bytecode and native code for the x86 architecture. Early versions of Alice ran on the Mozart Programming System (Oz) virtual machine (VM), allowing interfacing between Alice and Oz code. Alice's remote procedure calling depends on the virtual machine, because it may send code to be computed from one computer to another. Example Alice extends Standard ML with several primitives for lazy evaluation and concurrency. For example, threads may be created using the \`spawn\` keyword. Consider the naive algorithm for computing the Fibonacci numbers: fun fib 0 = 0  fib 1 = 1  fib n = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2); For large values of \`n\`, \`fib n\` will take a long time to compute. This computation can be performed in a separate thread by val x = spawn fib n; The variable \`x\` is now bound to a so-called future. When an operation requires the value of \`x\`, it blocks until the thread is done with the computation. To exploit parallelism one could even define fib as follows: fun fib 0 = 0  fib 1 = 1  fib n = spawn fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);  See also  Oz (programming language) References  External links  * Multiple publications about Alice ML and its concepts ML programming language family Logic programming languages Functional logic programming languages Programming languages created in 2000 ","title":"Alice (programming language)"},{"id":"30877979","text":"Coffee bean storage is a broad term describing the packaging and preservation of coffee beans throughout the process from harvesting to brewing. Although the term is applicable to many phases of this process, it is typically applied to ideal home storage for maximum consumer coffee enjoyment. Green coffee After the cherries are put through the pulper and the seeds have been soaked, they are set out to sun-dry for a period of one week. The beans are periodically raked to ensure even drying. Once dried, the beans will form a thin, paper-like shell called parchment. Once formed, the parchment will increase the beans‚Äô storage life considerably.Les Drent, \\"Coffee Farming in Kona, Hawaii\\", \\"Coffee Times\\", retrieved 2/2011 When the beans are ready, the parchment is removed, and the beans are graded and sorted according size, weight and defects. The sorted beans are then stored in 60 or 70 kg sacks called sisal bags that help the beans retain moisture for a longer period of time.Douwe Egberts, \\"Coffee Development - From Bean to Cup\\" , \\"Hollandbymail.com\\", retrieved 2/2011 The storage time cannot exceed one year for the beans to be considered a current crop. If the green coffee remains in storage for longer than a year, it is considered old crop, and is less valuable because of its drier state. Roast coffee Once a coffee bean is roasted, it is either packaged immediately for sale, or ground and then packaged for sale. Packages used are typically either an airtight plastic container or vacuum-sealed wrapping, or a folded-over bag with a pressure relief valve. Each type of package has its own advantages. The airtight containers allow maximum freshness of the bean and prolong its shelf life, whilst the valve allows excess carbon dioxide, and other gases to escape. The carbon dioxide, as much as 10 L/kg of coffee for dark-roasted coffee, is not released because it is harmful to the flavour‚Äîquite the contrary, it protects the beans against oxidation, but excess pressure could damage the container. Reported experience is that a few days of carbon dioxide release is needed between roasting and brewing for best results. There is also informed opinion that storage of freshly roasted beans in a can pressurized with nitrogen gas, with excess pressure buildup vented via a relief valve, provides optimal storage for extended periods, while promoting a beneficial aging effect related to distribution of natural oils by the pressure. Home storage Once bought, the method of storage used depends on the type coffee purchased. Green beans store the best in cooled airtight containers, and can easily last in this state for a year without losing flavor.Sean Paajanen, \\"Proper Coffee Storage\\", \\"About.com\\", retrieved 2/2011Lindsey Goodwin, \\"Coffee Storage‚ÄîAirtight Coffee Storage Methods\\", \\"About.com\\", retrieved 30/1/2015 Roasted whole beans are best stored in airtight containers out of the light. The best material choices for the container are ceramic, or opaque glass. Plastic and metal may alter the flavor of the coffee bean. In addition, for the first week of storage, containers should be opened or vented by a relief valve to release the carbon dioxide gas that will be produced by the roasted beans to prevent the gas from changing the quality of the coffee. Whole bean roasted coffee stored in this manner will last for about two weeks. The advisability of freezing roasted beans is controversial.Lindsey Goodwin, \\"Should I Store Coffee in the Freezer?\\", \\"About.com\\", retrieved 30/1/2015 Those advocating freezing believe that the flavour can then last for one to two months. If beans are frozen, leaving them frozen until brewing best preserves the flavour of the coffee. Frozen beans will grind the same as unfrozen beans, but refreezing beans alters the quality of the coffee. Coffee grounds are stored in metal containers that are non-reactive https://coffeforus.com/store-coffee-beans/ airtight ceramic or glass containers, like roasted beans. Due to increased total surface area of coffee grounds, the grounds go stale in days, rather than weeks. In addition, freezing has no effect in increasing the storage life of coffee grounds.

Professional life =Modelling career= It was also at the age of fourteen that Kemp began her career as a model. She appeared in numerous TV commercials as well as a promotional video made by the Beach Boys during their first tour of Australia in 1964. Kemp was later discovered by the publishers of the Australasian Post, an enduring and popular illustrated magazine, on which she appeared as a cover girl on no fewer than 27 occasions. In 1967, she was photographed alongside an American sailor on board a visiting destroyer, the USS Epperson.\\"A Snap for His Album\\", Sydney Morning Herald, 7 May 1967, p 3.

Her first film appearance was in The Games (1970), starring Ryan O'Neal, which was filmed in Sydney. After moving to London in 1970, Kemp gained more offers. In April of that year, it was reported that she had been signed to appear in the new James Bond film, Diamonds Are Forever, opposite Sean Connery and Jill St. John.\\"Now he's back to bondage\\", Australian Women's Weekly, 28 April 1971, p 5. By her own account, Kemp also \\"amassed dozens of TV commercials\\" during this period, notably spots for Revlon and Lamb's Navy Rum. In January 1972, it was reported by UPI that Kemp had been cast in a supporting role in the forthcoming sequel to The Abominable Dr. Phibes, which had starred Vincent Price in the title role and Virginia North as his silent assistant, Vulnavia. As the latter character had been killed off at the end of the first film, the draft screenplay for the sequel intended to introduce an entirely new character as Phibe's assistant. This was revised when the film studio, AIP, insisted that the name Vulnavia be retained. North had since become pregnant and was therefore unable to reprise her role, which prompted the casting of Kemp as a replacement.Bruce G Hallenbeck, Comedy- Horror Films: A Chronological History, 1914-2008, p 96. Kemp recalls that she was originally given a 10-year contract, as the producers were hoping to develop a Dr. Phibes franchise, with at least four subsequent films being proposed. This series did not eventuate. During this time, Kemp also made several TV appearances, including the special Mike & Bernie's Show (1972), a semi-fictitious autobiography of comedian brothers Mike and Bernie Winters, who played themselves.\\"A LIfe Story with a Big Difference\\", Sydney Morning Herald, 3 July 1972, p 12 . At the time of her marriage in August 1973 (see below), Kemp was reported to be hosting her own TV programme in London.\\"Sydney beauty queen to wed business chief\\", Sydney Morning Herald, 5 August 1973, p 3. Notwithstanding the failure of the proposed Dr. Phibes franchise, she went on take small roles in several other films, including Rollerball (1975) and The Great Muppet Caper (1981), in which she appeared as a model. In April 1981, Kemp announced her intention to return to Australia permanently, due to the \\"depressing state of the British film industry\\". She was quoted as saying: \\"The trouble is, in England I can make about one film a year, which I can hardly live on. The Australian movie and television business is really booming, so there will be no problem getting parts. I know most actresses try their luck in America, but I couldn't face that place.\\"\\"Valli Kemp plans to return to Australian Acting\\", Sydney Morning Herald, 27 April 1981, p 8. She later admitted to the Australian press that \\"comedy is what I like best, and I'd love to do some television work, maybe co-hosting a show.\\"\\"Valli home, minus Pet\\", Sydney Morning Herald, 14 February 1982, p 24. =Art and fashion design career= Shortly after moving to London, Kemp revived her earlier interest in painting. Her works during this period included a semi-abstract self-portrait, which was to be exhibited in a London disctecque.\\"Valli Kemp\\", Sydney Morning Herald, 3 March 1971, p 2.? Kemp's talent for the visual arts received an unexpected boost while filming Dr. Phibes Rises Again in 1972, when her co-star Vincent Price, an art collector and art critic of some distinction, expressed interest in seeing her work. After doing so, he was sufficiently impressed to arrange for her to hold an exhibition in London, where she sold thirty paintings in two hours. She went on to become, as she put it, \\"an artist to the British show biz families\\". Amongst her celebrity clients were singer Des O'Connor, comedians Mike & Bernie Winters, musical entrepreneur Gordon Mills and TV presenter Michael Parkinson. After returning to Australia in 1982, Kemp rented a house in the Sydney beachside suburb of Bondi and began working as a fashion designer. As she later told the press, \\"modelling and acting was a means of getting some money, but I think I'll get more designing ‚Äì it's a daily job.\\"\\"They told tempo\\", Sydney Morning Herald, 23 September 1984, p 70. In September 1984, she held her first fashion parade at Pronto, a popular restaurant and bar in the exclusive suburb of Double Bay. Kemp continues to work as an artist and art teacher in Newcastle, north of Sydney. Personal life While living in London in 1971, Kemp was reported to be romantically involved with pop singer Jonathan King.\\"He's Number One in Spectacles\\", Sydney Morning Herald, 8 August 1971, p 2. In August 1973, Kemp married Robert Winsor, 32-year-old businessman who owned a point-of-sale companyAnother Side of Robert Winsor, ABC Mallorca, 25 November 2016 and who had been introduced to her only a few months earlier by actor Richard Johnson. Kemp herself had reportedly proposed to Winsor during a voyage on a friend's yacht on the Mediterranean. She had an engagement ring specially made to her own design ‚Äì a ruby in a heart-shaped setting, surrounded by diamonds. The couple wed at the Registry Office at Totteridge, near London, where Winsor was in the process of erecting a large house. The marriage lasted only 18 months, reportedly due to the stresses of Kemp's acting commitments.\\"Andy's girl is Valli's pal\\", Sydney Morning Herald, 10 October 1982, p 2. The couple divorced in 1975, but remained friends. After Kemp returned to Australia permanently in 1985, she remarried and had three children.

Construction, acquisition, and commissioning Eastern Chief was built as the commercial cargo ship SS Yoshida Maru No. 3 and completed in December 1917 by the Uraga Dock Company in Uraga, Japan. Soon after completion she was sent to the United States, where she was placed under the control of the United States Shipping Board, which renamed her SS Eastern Chief. On 10 September 1918, the U.S. Navys 6th Naval District inspected her at Charleston, South Carolina, for possible naval service during World War I, and the Shipping Board transferred her to the Navy on 25 September 1918 at the Charleston Navy Yard in Charleston. The Navy assigned her the naval registry identification number 3390 and commissioned her on 27 September 1918 as USS Eastern Chief (ID-3390) with Lieutenant Commander A. P. Jensen, USNRF, in command. Operational history Assigned to the Naval Overseas Transportation Service, Eastern Chief departed Hampton Roads, Virginia, on 9 October 1918. After stopping at Sydney, Nova Scotia, Canada, for repairs, she arrived at La Pallice, France, on 26 November 1918 to discharge her cargo and load ordnance and engineering stores. She departed La Pallice on 14 December 1918 and arrived at Norfolk, Virginia, on 8 January 1919. On 9 February 1919, Eastern Chief was again underway for La Pallice. During her transatlantic crossing, she went to the aid of the disabled U.S. Navy cargo ship on 15 February 1919, standing by West Haven until a tug came to assist. Eastern Chief helped tow West Haven to Bermuda, then resumed course for La Pallice, which she finally reached on 23 February 1919. She then steamed to Antwerp, Belgium, where she finished offloading her cargo. She departed Antwerp on 3 May 1919 bound for Norfolk, where she arrived on 23 May 1919. Decommissioning and disposal Eastern Chief was decommissioned on 29 May 1919. The Navy transferred her back to the U.S. Shipping Board the same day.

His work combined Roman Catholic worship with traditional African-American music. He wrote several books on music and spirituality as well.  Biography  Clarence Rivers was born in Selma, Alabama, but his family moved to Cincinnati, Ohio when he was young. It was there that he began his study for the priesthood. He did graduate work at Xavier and Yale Universities, as well as the Catholic University of America and L‚ÄôInstitut Catholique de Paris. The first African- American to be ordained in the Archdiocese of Cincinnati,National Catholic Reporter, January 7, 2005 it was his music that made him famous, beginning with his \\"An American Mass Program,\\" which combined Gregorian Chant with the melodic patterns and rhythms of traditional Negro Spirituals.http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Fr.+Clarence+Rivers,+liturgy+pioneer,+dead+at+73.-a0127432639 It was used at the first official American Mass in English after the Second Vatican Council in 1963 (which had opened the door in canon law for vernacular Mass rather than Latin). His most beloved hymn was \\"God is Love.\\" He first sang the song at the National Liturgical Conference in 1964 and received a 10-minute standing ovation. He received his doctorate in African-American Culture and Catholic Liturgy from the Union Institute in 1978. He received the Berakah Award in 2002, and died unexpectedly in 2004 at the age of 73.  Legacy  Rivers was passionate about the drama of public worship, as well as the music that was the \\"soul\\" of worship. He was equally devoted to African American culture and was known for his lavish vestments and distinctive jewelry. In addition to being a gifted composer, he had an acclaimed vocal style. But it was his personal faith and belief in the liturgy as a place where one encountered God that motivated all of his work.

The dining car originally opened during the 1940s in Little Ferry, New Jersey, as the Silver Dollar Diner. After multiple commercials were filmed in the diner for Bounty paper towels with a fictional character named Rosie the Waitress, the diner was renamed Rosie's. Previously offered to the Smithsonian Institution, the restaurant was sold in the 1990s to a Michigan artist who had the building moved to its current location next to another diner. A third diner was later moved to the site from Fulton, New York. A series of replicas were built as part of a chain of restaurants in the Denver area. History =Origins= The restaurant was originally the Silver Dollar Diner in Little Ferry, New Jersey; it was built in 1946 by the Paramount Dining Car Company. The diner was located on U.S. Route 46 when it first opened in the 1940s. Rosie's was owned by Ralph Corrado Jr. and his father before him. Corrado renamed the restaurant after the waitress character from the commercials in 1970. =Bounty commercials= Two other commercials were previously filmed in the building, one for Sanka and another for Pepsi in the earlier days of the restaurant. However, the series of TV commercials that made the diner famous were for Bounty paper towels. They were filmed at the diner during the 1970s when it was known as the Farmland Diner (local Little Ferry residents affectionately referred to it as \\"The Greasy Spoon\\"). Clumsy patrons would knock over beverages, and Rosie the Waitress, played by Nancy Walker, would clean up the mess using Bounty paper towels, pronouncing the product the \\"quicker picker-upper\\". Two decades after the first commercials were filmed, Walker was still cleaning up after her television customers, but in a studio instead of in the diner. Other companies like Ethan Allen Furniture and Sony used the New Jersey diner location for their advertisements. After 45 years and countless commercials in Little Ferry, Corrado placed the restaurant for sale. =Move to Michigan= Corrado sold the land under the diner to the auto glass repair shop next door. The business did not want the diner, leaving it up to Corrado to sell the building. His offer to place \\"the most famous diner in America\\" in the Smithsonian Institution was rejected. Jerry Berta is an artist that produces ceramic replicas of classic diners, with the original Rosie's as one of his inspirations. He owned one diner, a 1947 Jerry O‚ÄôMahoney Dining Car, located on the site in Michigan when he found out that the New Jersey diner was for sale. Berta bought Rosie's and moved it to Michigan at its current location. The purchase price at the time was $10,000 for the building. Work crews sawed the diner in half the week after it closed in 1990 in New Jersey to load it on flatbed trucks for the move to Michigan. The restaurant opened in its new location on July 5, 1991. =Expansion under Berta= The vintage two-diner collection expanded to three when Berta purchased the former Garden of Eatin' diner (a 1952 Silk City) and moved it from Fulton, New York to the Michigan site in 1994. A fourth (reproduction) diner was also built on site as an addition. Known collectively as Dinerland USA, the location featured the Diner Store art gallery (in the Mahoney car), Rosie's Diner (the primary restaurant), and a 3 1/2 acre food-themed mini-golf course designed by Berta, where guests could putt around a big burger and slice of pie. Butko, Brian and Sarah. Roadside Attractions. Pages 92-94. =Development under the Roests= Jonelle and Randy Roest purchased the diner in January 2006. They reopened the Silk City car as a sports bar. The Mahoney car was opened seasonally as an ice cream shop. The mini-golf course was not reopened. While under the Roests' ownership, the location received TV coverage on Food Network's Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives in 2006, and Travel Channel's Diner Paradise. =Closure= Rosie's Diner closed on October 2, 2011. The property was sold through online auction to Aaron Koehn of nearby Koehn Chevrolet, with a winning bid of $125,000. In September 2014, he offered tours of the buildings as part of a car show that attracted an estimated 3,000 people.https://www.mlive.com/news/grand- rapids/index.ssf/2015/08/original_owner_of_iconic_rosie.html Revitalization efforts An effort to revitalize interest in Rosie's Diner was led by a Michigan photographer, Dana Kenneth Johnson, through a well-publicized Facebook post on March 2, 2017.

ISSUE Project Room is an art and performance center, presenting projects by more than 200 emerging and established artists each year. History and programming ISSUE Project Room began in 2003 with a special concert curated by ISSUE's late founder Suzanne Fiol and musician Marc Ribot honoring the work of Frantz Casseus, the father of Haitian Classical music. It started out in a garage space in the East Village of Manhattan, as a \\"project room\\" to feature experimental performances presented by Fiol's photography agency, Issue Management. Performances by Debbie Harry and the Jazz Passengers, Elliott Sharp, Anthony Coleman and dozens of others soon followed. Responding to the needs of artists in the community, Suzanne committed herself to developing ISSUE into a year-round performance space where artists could present their most challenging new work. By 2005, ISSUE was presenting 100 arts events annually featuring pioneering artists from all disciplines. It had outgrown its Lower East Side location, and moved to a unique space in Brooklyn: a two- story silo in the post-industrial margin of the Gowanus Canal. At the Silo, ISSUE's programming expanded to include site-specific works that incorporated a custom-designed 16-channel hemispherical speaker system created by sound artist Stephan Moore. Success in the space, both critical and programmatic, was tremendous, but after two years its rent was doubled and ISSUE was forced to move on. In 2007, ISSUE moved to the Old American Can Factory, where it continued to thrive ‚Äî emerging as one of Brooklyn's leading cultural catalysts and bringing 10,000 people to the Gowanus area of Brooklyn each year. By 2008, ISSUE was supporting new work by more than 200 innovative arts each year, and entered and won a competition for a twenty-year rent-free lease to the 4,800 sq. ft. theater located at 22 Boerum Place‚Äî on the ground floor of the historic Beaux-Arts McKim, Mead & White ‚Äú110 Livingston Street‚Äù building in downtown Brooklyn, to create a \\"Carnegie Hall for the avant-garde\\".

It operates under the Presbyterian Church U.S.A. denomination under the Synod of the Trinity and the Presbytery of Washington. The church has historically maintained a strong relationship with the neighboring Washington & Jefferson College. The church was founded through the 1960 merger of the Second Presbyterian Church, which was itself a daughter work of the First Presbyterian Church 1793, and the Third Presbyterian Church. Congregational history =Second Presbyterian Church= George P. Hays was an early and influential minister On March 12, 1861, the Presbytery of Washington organized the Second Presbyterian Church because the First Presbyterian Church of Washington had outgrown its facilities. The split, which saw 36 members leave the First Presbyterian Church to join the Second, was reportedly \\"attended with expressions of the best Christian feeling\\" between the congregations. Because of the American Civil War, the two congregations continued to worship together until 1864. The Second Presbyterian Church leased a church building from a Methodist Protestant building on Beau Street. In 1870, George P. Hays became \\"stated supply\\", while also serving as President of the neighboring Washington & Jefferson College. He focused on preaching and left the administration of the church in the capable hands of the members. Hays served until 1881, when he moved to take a pastorate in Colorado. The congregation stayed in that building for 14 years before beginning a construction project in 1884, with a fund of $25,000. The new building at 65 East Beau Street was dedicated on March 6, 1887, with Hays returning to give the sermon. The building featured a Johnson Pipe Organ and a 450-seat auditorium with a groined ceiling and bowled floor and an adjacent lecture room. The church outgrew that building by 1929 and constructed a new Gothic Revival style building on East Beau Street, the building that now houses the Church of the Covenant. Judge John Addison McIvaine was a prominent church member. The church was home to three important revivals in its history. The church had a historically strong tie with the college, as a number of its men attended Wednesday evening prayer meetings and 75 to 100 attending Sunday service. Many of these students eventually joined the ministry or became missionaries. =Third Presbyterian Church and merger= On March 24, 1891, the Presbytery of Washington organized the Third Presbyterian Church, composed of members of the First and Second Presbyterian Church. The new church constructed a facility on Jefferson Avenue. In 1959, the Third Presbyterian Church's efforts to construct a new building were frustrated, which necessitated its merger with the Second Presbyterian Church. A merger of the two church was agreed to by both congregations and the Church of the Covenant was formally established on September 11, 1960.

Most conclusions drawn in surveys and carefully controlled experiments are arguments by example and generalization. Studies that analyze past speeches also draw conclusions by taking specific examples of communication and inferring generalizations from them. Arguments from example may be difficult to recognize because they can look like mere illustration. For example: :Taxonomists use Latin words to classify various animals into such categories as kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species. Thus, some species of bear are Ursus americanus (American black bear), Ursus arctos (brown bear), and Ursus maritimus (polar bear). Though the above paragraph contains a common conclusion indicator word (\\"thus\\"), it nevertheless is merely illustrating a fact of taxonomy. However, this could be made into an argument. :Taxonomists use Latin words to classify various animals so that scientists who speak different languages can communicate discoveries more easily.

The Greek biologist might then respond that she has noted a similar characteristic in œÄŒøŒªŒπŒ∫ŒÆ Œ±œÅŒ∫ŒøœçŒ¥Œ±.

Art is life is art: the life and work of Don Jones [Motion picture]. United States. Don Jones almost drowned at the age of four, but was rescued and resuscitated by his older brother. Jones first started drawing after his near-drowning. He credits art with helping him overcome the traumatic experience. For 16 years, he repeatedly drew and painted boats and different forms of water. He mastered visual representation of water surfaces by that time, which helped him to process the drowning incident by re-enacting it through his art.Schardt, S. (March 2010). Sydney Schardt interviewing Don Jones. The artist interview (TAI). Retrieved from http://www.theartistinterview.com . As a teenager, Jones taught himself to paint, starting with oils. He realized during the art process that it was different from the art curriculum he learned in school. Don felt release. At the age of 18, Jones registered for World War II draft as a \\"conscientious observer.\\" He also enrolled at Marietta College to study theology and medicine, but quit after the first year. At 19, recognised as a conscientious objector, he became a member of the Civilian Public Service Corps, and volunteered to work in the Marlboro Psychiatric Hospital for the following three years. Jones worked alone in the wards with the chronically mentally ill, eight hours a day, six days a week. In Bruce Moon‚Äôs film, Art is Life is Art, Jones said the Marlboro State Hospital was where he recognized how art positively affected patients. He called the state hospital his \\"university of psychiatry\\". Jones had a theme for art therapists to remember: ‚Äúopenness creates openness.‚Äù His drowning experience as a child taught him that phrase, and the time at the state hospital reinforced it. The thought behind this expression is‚Äîif a person opens himself emotionally to others, the safer those people will feel with him. Jones found work as a commercial artist after World War II and settled into Rossville, Kansas with his wife, Eleanor (nee Illston), and children; David, Amy, Evan, Anne, Matthew and Peter. In this community, he served as a pastor, artist, mentor and friend to many people. Always an artist before any other role, Don did not leave a blank wall unpainted in Rossville. He formed a group to help paint murals at the high school and community center, continued his own series of paintings, and taught a night class. Some of his students had connections to the Menninger Clinic in Topeka, Kansas, and Don soon received a call from Karl Menninger. Dr. Menninger wanted to show his paintings. Jones said to exhibit his paintings, Menninger had to hire him on staff. Don had his way, and was hired in 1951 to join the adjunctive staff at the world-famous psychiatric facility. It was at the Menninger clinic where Don Jones developed a drawing assessment that used mental imagery. Called the \\"Don Jones Assessment\\",Rubin, J.A. (2005). Artful therapy (p. 199). Hoboken, N.J.: John Wiley & Sons. it combined guided imagery and drawing while patients remained in a relaxed state. Subjects imagined a journey, and stopped at four important points. At each point, they were asked how they would proceed, and drew a picture of the imagery. Each invented situation was cautiously designed to embody a different kind of universally stressful problem. Structured questions followed the exercises. The \\"Don Jones Assessment\\" was found to be useful in both assessing and treating individuals. Menninger hired Margaret Naumburg by Jones' suggestion, and helped to establish a new concept of \\"process vs. content\\" at the hospital. Jones‚Äô view was to pay attention each patient's art process, while Naumburg's position was to psychoanalyze the content or result of every art piece. In his 16 years at Menninger, Jones also trained Robert \\"Bob\\" Ault, which led to Ault's hiring at the foundation in 1960. Jones and Ault started to consider the art process as a diagnostic tool. Together, they pioneered to develop some of the first clinical internship training programs in the United States, and acted on the Steering Committee that established the American Art Therapy Association.Rubin, J.A.

It was not until 1969 when the American Art Therapy Association became nationally known; this formation recognized art therapy as a professional field.Malchiodi, C.A. (2007). The art therapy sourcebook (pp. 4- 5, 38). New York: McGraw-Hill. By this time, Jones worked as the director of the adjunctive therapies department in Harding Hospital for two years. Located in Worthington, Ohio, the hospital developed and acted upon the idea that every possible experience could be therapeutic. In 1974, Bruce Moon was hired onto the staff after a one-year clinical apprenticeship. Don Jones became his mentor, and continues to be today. To Moon, Jones is a father, a legend and a friend. As an art therapist, Jones relied on the arts and the self. In order to be of help to another, it is important to know oneself. He stressed that in order to be an art therapist, one needs to be an artist. Being away from studio for too long caused burnout of an art therapist, Jones described. Unlike other mental health professionals, Jones was insistent that the patients' or clients' work is theirs to keep. They are the artists.Moon, B.L. (2000). Ethical issues in art therapy (pp. 77, 86, 107). Springfield: Charles C Thomas. Even in retirement, Don Jones was still an active painter in his art studio. He continued to assist the Worthington Area Art League that started in his basement 35 years ago, supervised students and consulted with various treatment programs. Jones died in January 2015.

It is endemic to Liberty County, Florida, where it is known from about ten populations.USFWS. Conradina glabra Five-year Review. July 2009.Conradina glabra. The Nature Conservancy. It is found only in a small area and it is threatened by habitat destruction. It is a federally listed endangered species. Habitat This plant is limited to the sandhills and forest habitat of northern Liberty County in the Florida Panhandle, where it grows among oaks and longleaf pines (Pinus palustris). It had previously been reported from Santa Rosa County, as well, but these specimens proved to be Conradina canescens. Several of the remaining populations are within the bounds of Torreya State Park. Characteristics This is an aromatic shrub growing to a maximum height of 80 centimeters to one meter. The branches are lined with linear, needlelike, mint-scented leaves up to 1.5 centimeters long. The inflorescence is two or three flowers borne in the leaf axils, each flower between 1 and 2 centimeters in length. The double-lipped flower is pale lavender in color with darker purple spotting on the lower lip. The plant reproduces sexually by seed and vegetatively by sprouting from its base. Endangered status This species is mainly threatened by the loss and degradation of its habitat. The land on which it grows has been drastically altered by the conversion of land to agriculture, particularly silviculture. Starting in the 1950s large strips of the native pine forests in the area were removed and replaced with plantations of slash pine (Pinus elliottii). The rare plant can sometimes be found on the margins of these plantations. It is not certain how abundant the shrub was before the habitat was altered because it was not even discovered until the silviculture operations had begun.

It stars Rajesh and Sudha Chandran in lead roles, with S. Ve. Shekher, Manorama, Radha Ravi, Ramya Krishnan in supporting roles. The movie has music composed by Ben Surender. Plot K. Natraj (Rajesh) is an orphaned but successful architect who lives with his aunt and cousin. One day in the temple, he chances upon Sivakami (Sudha Chandran), a very pious girl who is very much devoted to the Mother Goddess. Natraj falls for her and eventually expresses his wish to marry her. She doubted that he will marry her at first because she lost one leg in an accident. But Natraj still wanted to marry her and they eventually tie the knot. However, Natraj's aunt Rajamma and her son, his cousin Balu do not like Sivakami and often look down on her because of her handicap, and their hatred for her increases even more when Natraj entrusts the key of the money safe to her. Balu is in a habit of visiting Bhama, a temptress who, along with her \\"uncle\\", Alavanda (Radha Ravi), often swindles money from Balu. When Sivakami gets pregnant, Balu, along with his mother try and abort the baby fearing that Sivakami may control them of money once the baby is born by secretly spiking her drinks with a special drug which will abort the baby, and they succeed twice. But Natraj and Sivakami did not know of their plot and thought that the abortion naturally happened. Disheartened, they accept it as fate. One day when they were going out. Sivakami notices a temple tower in a distance. After some inquiry, they find out that it is an old temple, known as \\"Kolakara Kaliamman Kovil\\" meaning temple of killer Goddess, named so because of many mysterious murders that has been happening in that temple for the past ten years. One of the murders were shown in the beginning of the movie, where a married couple takes shelter in the temple during rain and the husband is lying dead under the trident of the Goddess the next morning, and the wife dies along with husband while mourning for him. Many other murders happened similarly. Nobody went to the temple after that. Sivakami wanted to go to the temple, and they enter the temple, which was very dilapidated. She was mesmerized by the temple deity, the Goddess Kali. She cleaned the temple premises and, along with her husband, worshiped the Goddess and asked Her to grant them a baby, promising that they will perform penance and renovate the temple in return. One day Rajamma makes Sivakami grind rice to make a \\"Maavilakku\\" (a special lamp made of flour, used for worship of the Goddess), despite knowing that she is handicapped, and goes to the temple with the flour for the vilakku without Sivakami, also knowing that Sivakami goes to the temple every Friday. Unhappy that she was not able to see the maavilakku ceremony, she prays to the Mother Goddess to forgive her. The Goddess (Ramya Krishnan) appears in front of her house in the guise of a lady, gives her some flour as blessing and leaves the house. After that, things start happening to the advantage of Sivakami through the grace of the Goddess. She gets pregnant again and this time Rajamma and Balu's efforts were in vain to abort the baby. Eventually Sivakami gives birth to a beautiful baby girl. Since young, the girl, named Devi, has behaved in many ways like the Mother Goddess. Rajamma and Balu try to kill Devi many times, but she kills all the assassins hired by Balu, including one who is revealed to have committed all the mysterious murders associated with the Kali temple. This assassin's killing is a dramatic one where the Goddess herself kills him. He lies dead under the trident of the Goddess Kali, similar to all the murders that has been done by him. \\"Nalvaakku\\" Nagamma (Manorama), is a woman who pretends to talk to the Mother Goddess by trunk calls through a lime phone, trying to solve people's problems by taking money from them as call bills, and earns a living though that. Raju(S. Ve. Shekher), comes to her asking for help to identify what his father wanted to tell him before he died. Using his father's words, Manorama gets him married to her daughter, a fat Renuka. These scenes provide comic relief. As per their prayer, Sivakami and Natraj renovate the old Kali temple and in this festival, the Goddess reforms Rajamma by burning her Saree and then saving her by making the women fit a Veppillai (Neem) robe around her. Balu took his mother's new behavior as the last straw and hires some poachers to release a leopard to kill Devi. But the leopard envisions Devi as the Mother Goddess and becomes tamed by Devi. It then bites Balu, causing him to lose his right leg. Balu also comes to know that Bhama was a cheater and that Alavanda was her boyfriend in the guise of an old man. He confronts them but gets beaten up in return. Cheated and depressed, Balu reforms himself. Only his sister-in-law, Sivakami actually cared for him and he begins to respect her. One day, Devi gets bitten by a snake and the doctors say that she may not recover. Sivakami goes to the Kali temple and prays for her daughter's life. Devi comes to life, much to the family's happiness. Sivakami asks Devi to go to the Goddess and thank her. Devi goes and merges with the idol of Kali. A divine light appears and then the Goddess reveals that it was Her who incarnated as Sivakami's daughter to restore righteousness. She blesses all of them and disappears.

The name Yeelirrie is taken from the local sheep station. There are proposals to mine other uranium deposits in the Wiluna area: the Lake Maitland, Centipede, Millipede and Lake Way uranium projects. History The Yeelirrie uranium deposit was discovered in mid-1971 by WMC Resources. WMC reached an agreement with Esso and the German Urangesellschaft Australia Pty Ltd in 1978 to co- finance the project, which was then scheduled for production by 1984. Work on the mine development was underway by 1980 and trial mining was carried out. A pilot processing plant was established at Kalgoorlie in late 1980 and detailed metallurgical studies were undertaken from 1980 to 1982. A feasibility study for production at the rate of of U3O8 per year was completed in August 1982. There was also potential for 1,000 tonnes per year of vanadium oxide by- product. The succession of the Australian Labor Party to the federal government and that party's \\"Three mine policy\\" put a stop to the project by 1983. Yeelirrie was placed in care and maintenance. Site rehabilitation was completed in 2003.Yeelirrie Project Overview BHP Billiton website, published: June 2009, accessed: 17 February 2011 The project was acquired by BHP Billiton in 2005 when it acquired WMC. BHP reactivated the project after the strongest uranium market in over 25 years and a 2008 change in government policy. The company planned to start mining at Yeelirrie by 2014, producing approximately of uranium oxide per week. The mine was expected to have a life of 20‚Äì40 years. Ore would be treated on site and then transported by road to Kalgoorlie, from where it would be railed to either South Australia or the Northern Territory, where there are established facilities to store and export uranium oxides. BHP scaled back the production of the proposed mine in early 2010, from per annum to of U3O8, in part because a proposed additional acid heap leach circuit was deemed uneconomic due to high acid consumption. The project came under criticism at BHP's 2010 annual general meeting from local Aboriginal groups regarding their concerns which included the employment of indigenous residents near BHP‚Äôs mines in WA, and the need for reassurance from BHP that there would be minimal impact on the surrounding land at the planned mine. The local Wongutha people considered Yeelirrie as a \\"place of death\\", and that needed to be explored in heritage surveys. In February 2011, an environmental impact survey found a total of 143 species from 70 genera were recorded, most of which were widespread and common in the region. The survey also discovered 3 new previously unknown species. One of these species, now known as Atriplex yeelirrie, was declared threatened and has a highly restricted distribution, only found in two known locations, approximately 30 km apart. The north western population (of an estimated 84,510 indivduals) is located on ground that coincides with the central part of the proposed open pit mine. The south western population comprises of an estimated 190,656 individuals and was unimpacted by planned developments. In August 2012, BHP sold the project to Canadian mining company Cameco for US$430 million. At that time Yeelirrie had a measured and indicated mineral resource of 63,000 tonnes (139 million pounds) of U3O8, with an average grade of 0.13% U3O8, and an inferred resource of 2,300 tonnes (5 million pounds) at 0.10% U3O8. On the 31st of December 2018 Cameco announced measured and indicated mineral resources of 58,100 tonnes (128.1 million pounds) of U3O8, with an average grade of 0.15% U3O8. The Yeelirrie uranium project was granted environmental approval by the Western Australia Minister of Environment in January 2017. An application to invalidate the decision was lodged by the Environmental Defenders Office on behalf of the traditional owners of the land and the Conservation Council of Western Australia. It did not challenge the merits of the environmental assessment, but rather disputed the Environmental Protection Act 1986 (EPA) procedure and the ability of the Minister of Environment to make approval decisions. However this was rejected in February 2018. There was also an appeal to the Western Australia Court of Appeal seeking to overturn this ruling. This was heard on March 5, 2019, but ultimately dismissed.

One of the chief leaders of the republican Vladaya Uprising organised by deserted Bulgarian Army troops in 1918 against the government, from 1919 to 1923 Daskalov was a prominent member of the BAPU governments which were in power in Bulgaria in the early post-World War I period. A staunch opponent of the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organisation (IMRO), Daskalov survived an assassination attempt orchestrated by the organisation before he was assassinated in another IMRO attempt while residing in Prague, Czechoslovakia. Early years and Vladaya Uprising Rayko Daskalov was born in the village of Byala Cherkva (today a small town), located near Veliko Tarnovo in the central north of the Principality of Bulgaria. He finished the High School of Commerce in Svishtov and in 1907 left for Berlin, the capital of the German Empire. There, he successfully defended a doctorate in finance or economics at the Humboldt University in 1911. Influenced by early agrarian leader and his fellow-villager Tsanko Tserkovski, Daskalov had become a BAPU supporter as a youth. He joined the party in 1911 and by 1914 he had established himself as one of its more active figures. Daskalov fought as a volunteer in the ranks of the Bulgarian Army during the Balkan Wars of 1912‚Äì1913, and his brother Petko died on the front. In 1915, Daskalov and other BAPU members were sentenced to jail for their alleged involvement in the Declusiere Affair, a British‚ÄìFrench attempt to force Bulgaria into the Entente of World War I. In prison, Daskalov met Georgi Dimitrov and befriended agrarian leader and future Prime Minister Aleksandar Stamboliyski. After Entente forces had breached Bulgaria's defensive line at Dobro Pole on 18 September 1918, the retreating and deserting Bulgarian troops organised an uprising (known as the Vladaya Uprising) against the current government and Tsar Ferdinand of Bulgaria. The rebelling soldiers reached Kyustendil and Radomir and threatened the capital Sofia. In an attempt to stop the uprising, Daskalov and Stamboliyski were promptly released from captivity and envoyed to the insurgents. It was hoped that due to their popularity, the agrarian leaders would be able to persuade the insurgents into obedience. Instead of attempting to peacefully end the uprising, Daskalov, soon supported by Stamboliyski, put himself in charge of the rebelling troops. On 27 September, he proclaimed that the monarchist government of Bulgaria was to be overthrown and established the so-called Radomir Republic, with Stamboliyski as its president and himself as commander- in-chief. However, the government managed to rally loyalist troops and quickly crushed the uprising. The end of the rebellion was signalled by the capture of Radomir on 2 October, only five days after Daskalov's proclamation. Severely wounded in the arm in the skirmishes, Daskalov managed to escape to Thessaloniki, Greece by surrendering to the advancing Entente forces. As Bulgaria's involvement in the war ended soon thereafter in an armistice, he was pardoned and allowed to return to the country. In office and assassination After BAPU won the 1919 elections, Rayko Daskalov was a permanent presence in the party's governments from October 1919 to February 1923, with Stamboliyski as Prime Minister. As a prominent member of the BAPU cabinet, Daskalov was behind several of the government's major reforms, including the large-scale land reform and the introduction of the controversial mandatory labour service. He also suggested the establishment of BAPU's paramilitary force, the Orange Guard, which he personally commanded. Daskalov was successively in charge of several ministries during BAPU's time in power: the Ministry of Agriculture and State Properties (1919‚Äì1920), the Ministry of Finance (interim, 1920), the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Labour (1920‚Äì1922) and the Ministry of Internal Affairs and National Health (1922‚Äì1923). He was also elected to parliament for three consecutive National Assembly terms, from 1919 to 1923. Politically, Daskalov belonged to the radical leftist wing of BAPU. He was a major opponent of the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organisation (IMRO), an autonomist organisation in the region of Macedonia which took a stand against the terms of the Treaty of Neuilly that imposed Yugoslav and Greek rule over most of the region. In 1922‚Äì1923, Daskalov was at the helm of major repressions against IMRO's activity in Pirin Macedonia, the northeastern part of the region allotted by the treaty to Bulgaria. On 15 December 1922, he was targeted by an IMRO- organised assassination attempt in Sofia. IMRO member (komitadji) Asen Daskalov threw a bomb at Rayko Daskalov's car in front of the National Assembly building in Sofia, though the politician was not injured. In February 1923, Daskalov was released from his duties as government minister and in May he was sent to Prague, the capital of Czechoslovakia, as Bulgarian minister plenipotentiary to that country. On 9 June, with Daskalov in Prague, a military-supported coup d'√©tat overthrew Stamboliyski and put in charge a Democratic Alliance government under right-wing politician Aleksandar Tsankov. Daskalov attempted to gather international support for the overthrown government and even founded a BAPU government in exile, though his efforts were of little practical effect. On 26 August 1923, Daskalov was fatally shot on Holeƒçek Street in the Sm√≠chov district of Prague by another IMRO associate, Yordan Tsitsonkov, under orders from IMRO leader Todor Aleksandrov. The assassin was arrested and shortly thereafter released, after the jury found him not guilty. Tsitsonkov's attorney was the known Czech nationalist Jan Renner. Tsitsonkov was retried in October 1924 and sentenced to 20 years in jail under Yugoslav pressure. Tsitsonkov was initially imprisoned in the T√°bor prison but was moved to the prison in Kartouzy after a rumour spread that he was planning to escape. He committed suicide there by hanging in January 1926. Personal life and commemoration On 9 February 1919, Rayko Daskalov married Nevena, an agrarian sympathiser from an affluent Sofia family. Aleksandar Stamboliyski was his best man at the wedding. The couple had two children, Stefan and Svetla. The daughter, Svetla Daskalova, would follow in her father's footsteps as a BAPU politician and would become a long-time Minister of Justice (1966‚Äì1990) during the communist rule of Bulgaria. Daskalov was initially interred in Prague's Ol≈°any Cemetery; his burial ceremony was booed by anti-agrarian Bulgarian students in the city. In 1946, his remains were transferred back to Bulgaria and he was reburied in the Borisova Gradina in Sofia. A bilingual Czech‚ÄìBulgarian commemorative plaque in Sm√≠chov, Prague, marks the site of Daskalov's assassination; the plaque describes Daskalov as a \\"great Slav and a fighter for freedom, democracy and republicanism\\".

Life Faldo is said to have been educated at Cambridge University,He is not found in Venn, Alumni Cantabrigienses and to have been a chaplain in the army, so that he held no benefice when the Act of Uniformity 1662 became law. In 1673 he is described as a nonconforming minister at Barnet, and in 1684 was chosen pastor of the congregation at Plasterers' Hall, Addle Street, Aldermanbury, London. Here he remained till his death. Faldo was a congregationalist in the latter part of his life. He died on 7 February 1690, of the stone, and was buried at Bunhill Fields, where there was a Latin inscription upon his tomb. His funeral sermon was preached by the Rev. John Quick, and afterwards published.

Background Muhammad Saif-ur-Rehman Khan was born in 1982, in Islamabad, Pakistan, where he spent most of his early life. After completing his A-levels from the University College of Islamabad (UCI), he went on to complete a bachelor's degree from the University of Punjab in Lahore. He is said to have frequently toured the United Kingdom (where he took part in amateur fashion modelling) and the United States. Saif's college principal at UCI, Catalina Alliende, a Chilean national who also happened to be the honorary consul of Chile in Islamabad, encouraged him to travel to Chile to learn the Spanish language at the eFronteras institute in Santiago and also to study tourism and hospitality. Upon his arrival, he enrolled in language courses and rented a room in a boarding house. InnocentSaif On May 11, 2010, a U.S. official confirmed that Saif's name was on a terror watch list. However, there were no allegations leveled against him. Saif-ur-Rehman Khan was also not found to have any links with any illicit group. In May 2010, in an interview to media the Pakistani ambassador in Santiago, Chile stated that \\"Saif ur Rehman may have been framed\\". All suspicions were put to rest by the court in Santiago Chile that acquitted him and prosecutors dropped all charges against him. All along, Saif ur Rehman and his family claimed that the entire fiasco may have been a result of a \\"misunderstanding\\" stemming from mistaken identity. Biography On May 7, 2010, Saif was approached by three Americans while attending services at a mosque. Earlier that day, he had received a call from the U.S. Embassy in Santiago requesting that he come to the embassy for an identity check (it was later learnt that the purpose of the call-up was for letting him know his U.S. visa had been revoked). After informing the local Pakistani embassy, Saif proceeded towards the American embassy on May 10. When he was scanned while entering, traces of TNT and tetryl were found in the documents and cell phone which he submitted at the reception. Some reports said residue was found on his body, but it was later determined that nothing had been found on his body, clothes and hands. While he was locked in the embassy building, hours before his official detention, Chilean police searched his apartment, finding no sign of any explosive residues. However, a second search later on the same day uncovered traces of tetryl on several items of clothing, a small suitcase and a laptop. The Chilean interior minister, Rodrigo Hinzpeter, declared the Pakistani student a \\"terrorist\\" before the investigations concluded. The controversial Chilean anti-terrorism law, which allows some bypass of due process, was invoked. The courts overturned this application of the law, thus releasing Khan after five days of detention.Court rejects the arguments of the Chilean government against Pakistani student Release Upon his release,Chilevision CHV interviewCNN Chile Muhammad Saif-ur-Rehman Khan gave a press conference where he pleaded his innocence.Pakistani man: Chile detention is 'misunderstanding,' Paquistan√≠: ‚ÄúDetenci√≥n es un gran malentendido‚Äù The investigations continued and prosecutors repeatedly requested more time from the courts.

After a career in theatre and a series of small film roles, Menichelli was launched as a film star when Giovanni Pastrone gave her the lead role in The Fire (1916). Over the next nine years, Menichelli made a series of films, often trading on her image as a diva and on her passionate, decadent eroticism. Menichelli became a global star, and one of the most appreciated actresses in Italian cinema, before her retirement in 1924, aged 34. Since her death, restorations of Menichelli's surviving films have been shown at important film festivals, and her filmography has been re-assembled and re-evaluated by film historians. Biography =Early life= Giuseppa Iolanda Menichelli was born on 10 January 1890 in Castroreale, a small village in the province of Messina, Sicily. Her parents, Cesare and Francesca Malvica, were both touring theatre actors, who performed in Sicilian language. The Menichellis were part of a dynasty of performers, which included Nicola Menichelli, an important eighteenth century comedian. Her older sister Lilla, younger sister Dora and brother Alfredo all became actors. Pina Menichelli was educated at the Sacre Cuore Catholic School in Bologna. Being part of a family of touring actors, Menichelli started acting as child. Her first important role was in 1907 in a theatre company run by Irma Gramatica and Flavio And√≤, which toured Argentina in 1908. Menichelli married and took up residence in Buenos Aires in 1909. =Start of film career= After her return to Italy in 1912, Menichelli acted in around thirty-five films made by Cines of Rome in 1913‚Äì1915. Menichelli initially had parts in action-adventure films (Le mani ignote, Zuma and Il banchiere), before gaining supporting roles in several films based around famous actresses, such as Hesperia (Olga Mambelli), Soava Gallone and Gianna Terribili-Gonzales. Menichelli received positive reviews for her performances in In Contrasto (1913), Il siero del dottor Kean (1913) and La barca nuziale (1913). Menichelli played Cleopatra in Cajus Julius Caesar (1914), but all her scenes were cut from the final film. In the Napoleonic war epic Scuola d'eroi (1914), Menichelli had a cameo as a drummer girl. Legend has it that her performance struck Giovanni Pastrone, the director of Cabiria, who cut a frame from the film reel and ordered that the unknown actress be brought to Itala Films of Turin. However, reviews of her last films at Cines suggest that Menichelli was well on her way to film stardom before her move to Itala Films. Menichelli had graduated to starring roles in feature films, and her performances were generally positively reviewed, earning her favourable comparisons with Lyda Borelli and Francesca Bertini, the two most famous Italian film actresses of the time. One reviewer noted Menichelli's, \\"uncommon talent,\\" in Alla Deriva (1915). Commenting on La casa di nessuno (1915), another reviewer remarked, \\"The public like Menichelli, and that's enough. I could say that I like her too.\\" =Screen breakthrough: Il Fuoco and Tigre Reale= Original poster for Il Fuoco (1916). In 1915, Giovanni Pastrone decided to launch Menichelli as a film star, and gave her the lead role in Il Fuoco (The Fire), which was a global popular and critical success. This acclaim catapulted Menichelli into the ranks of the lavishly-paid cinema divas, such as Francesca Bertini and Lyda Borelli. The film bore no formal relation to Gabriele d'Annunzio's novel of the same name, and was developed from a screenplay by Febo Mari, Menichelli's co-star. However, the film was full of d'Annunzian themes of violent passion, power and decadence. The film is divided into three parts: La Favilla (the spark), La Vampa (the flame/blaze) and Il Cenere (the ashes), which correspond with the three phases of the relationship between Menichelli's aristocratic poet and Mari's impoverished painter. The original poster for Il Fuoco depicts a key moment in the film. Menichelli's character knocks over an oil lamp, and asks Mari's character to choose between love and all-consuming passion, and he chooses the latter. Menichelli's feathered hat, long capes and fierce gestures make her seem like an owl and reinforce one of the film's motifs; the link between the femme fatale and birds of prey. Menichelli earned the nickname 'Our Lady of Spasms' for her abrupt gestures in this film. Menichelli in Tigre Reale (1916). In 1916, Menichelli's status as a screen diva was cemented by Tigre Reale (Royal Tiger), directed by Giovanni Pastrone. The screenplay was loosely adapted from a novel by Giovanni Verga, who refused to have his name appear on the poster or in the film's credits. The plot concerns a diplomat, La Ferlita (Alberto Nepoti), who falls in love with the Russian Countess Natka (Menichelli). Natka frequently encourages then rejects La Ferlita, and their love story is broken up by a long flashback to Natka's previous relationship with a young revolutionary called Dolski (Febo Mari). Amid some beautiful snow scenes, Countess Natka's chance encounter with Dolski leads to a passionate romance. Exiled to Siberia, Dolski betrays Natka and kills himself when Natka finds him. After telling La Ferlita the story, Natka then disappears for several months, and La Ferlita is unable to find her. When the countess and the diplomat eventually meet, they are locked in a room in a huge theatre and hotel, which goes up in flames. The impressive scenes of the fire were made with the help of expert cinematographer Segundo de Chomon. The film's structure demonstrates Pastrone's secure grasp of cinematic form. Pastrone made excellent use of extended flashbacks and highlighted the parallels in the narrative with an effective system of montage. Tigre Reale was a huge commercial success. In Il Fuoco and Tigre Reale, Menichelli impressed cinema audiences with her, \\"...erotic charge, seductive glances and provocative body movements,\\" and established herself as the femme fatale of Italian silent cinema. Both Il Fuoco and Tigre Reale are perfect examples of what Aldo Bernardini defined as, \\"tailcoat cinema.\\" Both films allowed audiences a passport into the exciting lives of the upper-classes; an imaginary world of luxury where it was possible to transgress Italian society's strict moral codes. More widely, both films have also been mentioned as classics of the diva genre, although Menichelli's acting style was very different from the more theatrical styles of Francesca Bertini and Lyda Borelli. While Bertini rejected close-ups in the early part of her career, Menichelli managed to express a lot of emotion in them. Unlike Bertini, Menichelli did not claim to be the 'creator' of her character, and worked under the orders of her directors. =Career at Itala Films= Only a brief fragment of Gemma di Sant'Eremo (1916) has survived, making any judgement of the film or Menichelli's performance difficult. The film was a success in Spain, France and Central America.In Italy, the film's ending was changed on the orders of the Italian censors, and the film was a commercial failure. A similar fate also awaited L'Olocausto, which had been made by Itala in 1915, and was only released in Italy in 1919, having been cut from 1400 to 955m. The film was a commercial failure in Italy. However L'Olocausto was released uncensored in Britain, France and Germany, and was a commercial success. In 1918, La moglie di Claudio (Claudio's wife) was banned from cinemas by the Italian censorship board because Menichelli was \\"troppo...affascinante!\\" (too...fascinating!) in the film. Una Sventella (1918) was released to moderate reviews. In 1919, Menichelli starred in Il padrone delle ferriere (The boss of the ironworks) alongside Amleto Novelli, one of the most famous Italian actors of the period. The film was a huge commercial and critical success. =Move to Rinascimento Film= In 1919, Menichelli broke down in tears when she asked Giovanni Pastrone for his permission to leave Itala Films. During her four years at Itala Films, Menichelli's career had reached great heights, and her salary had increased from 12,000 lira per year to 300,000 lira per year. Menichelli moved to Rinascimento Film of Rome, which had been founded specifically for her by Baron Carlo D'Amato, and made a total of thirteen films there between 1919 and 1923. Despite the deepening crisis in the Italian film industry during these years, Menichelli's films continued to do well commercially because of her enduring popularity in certain countries, such as Mexico, and Rinascimento Film's calculated appeal to export markets, which included adapting foreign texts and putting foreign co-stars alongside Menichelli. An unconscious Pina Menichelli at the start of Storia di una donna In 1920, Menichelli starred in La Storia di Una Donna (The Story of a Woman), her first production at Rinascimento Film. Highly unusually for the time, the story of the protagonist is told through an extended flashback. An unconscious woman with gunshot wounds is brought into the city hospital. After conversing with her doctor, a detective finds the woman's diary, which is then used to tell the story of her life. At the end of the film, the unknown woman dies, having never regained consciousness, and the detective sets off to arrest her killer. The sets and interiors, extravagant in Menichelli's earlier films, were reduced to a bare minimum, and the film used low-key lighting in a similar way to the German Expressionists, creating large areas of shadow within the set. In 1922, Rinascimento Film decided to adapt a play by English author Arthur Wing Pi√±ero called The Second Wife. Menichelli travelled to London to shoot the exterior scenes. The resulting film, La Seconda Moglie (1922), was praised by English and Italian critics alike. In 1923, the final year of her career, Menichelli starred in two light-hearted romantic comedies, La Dama di chez Maxim and Occupati D'Aemilia. Her co-star in both films was French actor Marcel L√©vesque, best known for his comic roles in Louis Feuillade's serial films Les Vampires (1915) and Judex (1917). This marked a change from her usual serious roles, and both films were very popular with the public. =Retirement= Menichelli retired from the silent screen in 1924. Personal life and family During a theatrical tour of Argentina in 1909, Pina Menichelli married an Italo-Argentine, Libero Pica, and the couple had three children. One child, a boy, was born in 1909 and died shortly afterwards. The second, a son called Manolo, was born in 1910. The couple separated when Menichelli was pregnant with their third child, a daughter called Cesarina, who was born in Milan in 1912. The fact that Menichelli was a 'separated woman' was well-known to the Italian public. This contrasts with the likes of Emilio Ghione, one of the most famous Italian male film stars of the 1910s, who managed to hide his separated wife from public view. On the death of her first husband, who had always refused to annul their marriage, Menichelli married Baron Carlo D'Amato, founder of Rinascimento Film, in 1924. Menichelli retired from public life and refused all contact with film historians. Menichelli also destroyed all the documents and photographs relating to her film career which were in her possession. Menichelli died in Milan on 29 August 1984.

It uses the applique technique. Small pieces of zari ribbon are applied onto the fabric with the edges sewn down to create elaborate patterns. Gota embroidery is used extensively in South Asian wedding and formal clothes.  Overview  Bridal gagra with gota patti embroidery Gota is a gold or silver ribbon and lace from Lucknow. Various other coloured ribbons of varying width, woven in a satin or twill weave may also be referred to as gota. It is used along with kinari work. The dresses with gota work are used for special occasions or religious occasions. Gota is crafted using an appliqu√© technique with a strip of gold or silver or various other coloured ribbons of different widths woven in a satin or twill weave. It involves placing woven gold cloth onto fabrics such as georgette or bandhini to create different surface textures. Originally real gold and silver metals were used to embroider, but these were eventually replaced by copper coated with silver as the genuine way of making it was very expensive. Nowadays there are even more inexpensive options available. The copper has been replaced by polyester film which is further metalized and coated to suit requirements. This is known as plastic gota and is highly durable as it has a good resistance to moisture and does not tarnish as opposed to metal based gota. The process is lengthy and time-consuming. The first step is to trace the design on the fabric. This is done by placing a tracing paper with the design on it on the fabric and spreading a paste of chalk powder over it. Depending on the design, the gota is cut and folded into various shapes. It is then appliqu√©d by hemming or back-stitching it on the fabric. Attractive patterns are specific to the region, and each motif has its own distinguishing name. The motifs are usually inspired by nature and may consist of flowers, leaves and birds or animals such as peacocks, parrots and elephants. Gota creates a rich and heavy look but is light to wear. In Rajasthan, outfits with gota work are worn at auspicious functions. It is generally done on dupattas, turban edges and ghagras.

It is about a man named Pierce Mundy (Everett Silas) who has low ambitions and no plans. He settles for working at his parent's dry cleaners in South Central Los Angeles after being fired from his previous job. Pierce wastes his days fooling around with his childhood friend, Soldier (Ronnie Bell), who has been recently released from prison. When his brother Wendell (Monte Easter) plans on marrying someone of a higher social class, Sonia (Gaye Shannon-Burnett), his disdain for her prevents him from making the morally right decision. Plot The movie opens with a man playing the harmonica and singing the blues. Pierce is then seen walking down the street when he gets called by a woman to see her sister's baby. Pierce says that he doesn't have time because he has to go to visit Soldier's mother, but goes in anyway. At the house, Pierce asks who the father is and the woman says that he could be the father if he wants. Angered by the comment, Pierce leaves the house and continues his way to Soldier's place. At the house, Soldier's mother Mrs. Richardson asks Pierce if Soldier will ever act his age and wants Pierce to keep him out of trouble. Pierce says that Soldier wrote him a letter that said he would never go back to jail and even asked for a job. Mrs. Richardson asks about his brother's wedding and Pierce tells her he doesn't like the fianc√©e because she's rich. Pierce leaves saying that he has to work at his mother's shop. At the shop, Mr. Bitterfield comes in asking if Pierce's mother, Mrs. Mundy, can mend the rip in his church-going pants. When Pierce goes in the back to consult his mother, she says to tell Mr. Bitterfield that they can fix them but to instead throw them in the trash and, when Mr. Bitterfield comes to pick them up, to give him a pair from the unclaimed box. Pierce then gets into a wrestling match with his father. Meanwhile, a man comes into the store asking for a job. Mrs. Mundy replies saying there are two grown men in the back that can help her. Turning around to see Pierce and his father still wrestling, the man leaves, as do Pierce's parents. Back at home, Pierce's mother informs him that his brother and his fianc√©e are coming over. Pierce says he does not want to go to the wedding, complaining that Sonia is always bragging about how her family is rich and privileged. She warns Pierce that he has to behave so Sonia can see that he is civilized. She then tells him to go over to the neighborhood elders, Big Momma and Big Daddy, to see if they need anything and to pick up a pot. Once there, Big Daddy gets mad at Pierce for being rude and not saying anything. Pierce explains that he has to get back to the house before Wendell gets there. Pierce and Sonia get into an argument because Pierce thinks that Sonia had nothing to worry about all her life because she attended charm school. Sonia retaliates saying that she had to worry about things such as grades and if people liked her. Sonia also says that charm school taught young girls how to be ladies. They walk into the living room, where Wendell was telling his secretary of the wedding count. Upon hearing that, Pierce's mother then turns and asks Pierce when he's going to have a secretary. She says that she put them in church so that when they settled down she would have done her job, implying that Pierce has not yet accomplished anything Pierce tells his mother that it is not his fault. This upsets his mother as she tells him that it is because of the sacrifices of her and his. The next day, a man comes in looking for the clothes that he had brought in two months ago. They have trouble finding it because they man does not remember what he put his name as. They allow the man to go back and look for it, but Mrs. Mundy states that if he was a good man they would not have to keep track of all his aliases. Angela comes into the store all dressed up asking Pierce if he would go to prom with her in a couple of years. Seeing Pierce's disinterest, she leaves saying that she's going over to Smokey Robinson's tonight and that she should go get dressed. Pierce's mother tells him that he needs to go over to Big Momma and Daddy's house because Haddie wants to go out. As Pierce leaves, he and his father get into another wrestling match. With Soldier close to returning home, Pierce goes to a liquor store and asks his friend if he would be willing to give Soldier a job. The friend says that he would give Pierce a job, but he will not give one to Soldier. Having been rejected, Pierce then goes to ask his friend, Bob, telling him that Soldier is getting out of jail. Bob states that it is too bad because a person like Soldier should just stay in jail until he rots. Hearing this, Pierce leaves without even asking and picks up Soldier to take him home. When Mrs. Richardson sees Soldier she starts crying and Pierce consoles her saying that he is here to stay. Pierce hangs out with Soldier saying that Soldier is with a different girl every time he sees him. They goof around and hang out for the day. While hanging out in an alley, Soldier asks about his friend Lonneil and Pierce tells him that he was killed during an attempt to rob a liquor store. Pierce then says that they are the only two left. The next day Angela comes back and tells Pierce about how she was at Smokey Robinson's last night. She also tells him she does not like guys that are too cute. Pierce's mom interrupts, telling him that he has to go take care of Big Daddy and give him a bath. A man then attempts to rob the shop but backs out when he realized that Mrs. Mundy was on to what he was trying to do. Soldier asks Pierce about his girlfriend, Barbara, and if they had sex or not. Someone hiding in the bushes then leaps out and tries to shoot them but there are no bullets in the gun. They end up chasing the man, but Pierce lets him go. Pierce's mother begs him not to embarrass the family during dinner with the Richardson's. She says that she didn't raise heathens, but Pierce still states that he does not like Sonia because she has never worked for anything in her life. During dinner, Mr. Richardson asks Pierce what his job is. Pierce says that he went to school but did not like that everyone was doing the same thing. He tells him how he used to drive heavy machinery and delivered explosives. He states that he likes to work with his hands and that he's not smart enough to become a lawyer. Pierce's mother then says that it would have been nice to have a doctor and a lawyer in the family, but Pierce remarks that they are all crooks. Mr. Richardson says that the real corruption is in politics. Pierce states that the higher up you go, the lower the people you find. When Pierce's mother asks Sonia about her trial, Pierce yells at her saying that letting her client go free was wrong because he had killed people. This ends the dinner and they leave with Pierce's mother saying how ashamed of him she is. While Pierce is working at the store, Soldier walks in with a girl and asks Pierce to let him have sex with the girl in the back. Pierce's mother goes to church but comes back because she forgot her prayer book. She ends up walking in on them having sex and freaks out because they also did it on her prayer book. The girl then runs away in embarrassment. The next day, Soldier is waiting in a car for Pierce with another girl and sends Angela to go tell Pierce to hurry up. Angela ends up not telling Pierce that they are waiting and they leave without him. While Pierce is taking care of Big Momma and Big Daddy, Big Daddy asks Pierce if his friends are saved and believe in God, especially Soldier. That night Soldier gets into a car accident and dies. When Pierce finds out the next day, he runs to Soldier's house where his parents are grieving and the funeral is set for Saturday. Soldier's mom tells Pierce that he was like a son to her. Pierce then feels like it is his job to find pallbearers. In doing so, he realizes that the funeral is the same day as his brother's wedding. He rushes home to ask his brother and Sonia to change they date, but they refuse because he had never been nice to Sonia. Pierce's father then talks to him and tells them that maybe they can change the date of the funeral. With new hope, Pierce goes back to Soldier's house to ask. Once there, Soldier's dad tells him about the stress of the last few days and all the relatives that have flown in for Soldier's funeral. Hearing this, Pierce abandons the idea of asking them to change the date of the funeral and is now left conflicted. As both the wedding and the funeral are starting, Pierce shows up late and tells his mother that he has to go to the funeral. He tells his mother that someone else has to be the best man, but she gets angry and tells him to go sit down. However, Pierce ends up getting a car and drives to Soldier's funeral only to be late and miss it. The movie ends with Pierce sitting at the parking lot of the mortuary with the wedding rings and missing both events.  Characters  Pierce Mundy (Everett Silas) - main character who is a man with no ambitions and spends his days working at his parent's dry cleaners in South Central Los Angeles. When he is not working, he is either taking care of the neighborhood elders or wasting time with his childhood friend, Soldier. When the time comes for Pierce to make a crucial decision in his life, he is not morally able to choose the right decision and ends up disappointing his family. Wendell Mundy (Monte Easter) - Pierce's brother who is also a lawyer moving up in the social class order. He is about to marry an upper-middle class woman who Pierce despises because she is wealthier than their family. Mrs. Mundy (Jessie Holms) - Pierce's mother who dominates the household and manages the dry cleaners store. She is always nagging Pierce to get an education and become successful like his brother. She is very proud of her son, Wendell, and is constantly trying to get Pierce to be just like him. Mr. Mundy (Dennis Kemper) - Pierce's father who is very passive and has no major responsibilities in his life. Similar to Pierce, he acts like a child wrestling and fighting with Pierce. He has no influence over his family and cannot even help Pierce make the right decision in life. Soldier Richardson (Ronnie Bell) - Pierce's childhood friend who is constantly in and out of prison. He does not have a job and spends his days fooling around and sleeping with multiple women. He influences Pierce to make the wrong decisions in life and gets them in trouble. Mrs. Richardson (Sally Easter) - Soldier's mother who looks to Pierce to try to help Soldier become a better person. She sees Pierce as her own son and hopes he can lead Soldier to make the right decisions. Sonia Dubois (Gaye Shannon-Burnett) - Wendell's fianc√© who Pierce hates because he thinks that she never had to work for anything in her entire life. She and Pierce constantly get into argument about the subject and refuses to change her wedding date because Pierce had never been nice to her. Mr. and Mrs. Dubois (Sy Richardson and Frances E, Nealy )- Sonia's parents who are very wealthy and despised by Pierce. Angela (Angela Burnett) - neighborhood girl that has a crush on Pierce and is always trying to talk to him. History Charles Burnett calls this movie a tragicomedy based on the lives of the people who live in South Central Los Angeles. In a place where crime and violence are such a big part of everyday life and most people are stuck in their life, Burnett shows the life of an average person through the life of Pierce. He spends his days either wasting time with his friends or working a dead end job at his parent's dry cleaners with no thoughts of ever leaving. Burnett also depicts a typical household of dominant mothers and passive father as seen in Pierce's parents. Burnett's tragicomedy shows the life of African-American living in the working class communities as funny and loving, though impoverished. As a statement in the New York Times states \\"[Burnett is] making art out of materials and inspirations that lie close to hand. And the result is a film that is so firmly and organically rooted in a specific time and place that it seems to contain worlds.‚Äù Black Independent Film My Brother's Wedding is a black independent film rather than a blaxploitation film. Black independent films focus on many aspects of African American life rather than just the negative side. However, because they are seen as independent, many of these films never receive the publicity they deserve. This was the case with My Brother's Wedding which was not publicly released due to mixed reviews from the original audience. Even though Burnett tried to make his films as personal and as meaningful as possible, many of his works are hard to find on a regular basis. The lack of popularized black films can be attributed to the fact that Hollywood has been designed to crush the independent film industry. Another challenge for the black independent film industry is the fact that independent film industries are rarely located in African American neighborhoods. Many are instead located in white neighborhoods that usually prefer Hollywood productions. Production Charles Burnett was never allowed to finish editing the movie before it was sent to a New York film festival for screening by the producers. Films festivals are often successful venues to introduce films in the hopes of being picked up by a distribution companies. The rough-cut version of the film screened at the festival initially received a mixed review in The New York Times. This scared off distributors who believed it would be unsuccessful and the film was therefore never released to wider public audiences. Armond White, a film critic, noted that this was ‚Äúa catastrophic blow to the development of American popular culture.‚Äù Almost twenty five years later when Milestone Films picked up the rights to the film, they allowed Burnett to finally finish editing the film and release it the way he always intended it to be. Release =Box office= My Brother's Wedding generated $4,294 in revenue during its first weekend on September 16, 2007. The film was screened in only one theater in the U.S. The film went on to earn gross revenue of $8,217. =Critical reception= Upon release of the re-edited film, it received mostly positive reviews. Slant Magazine called this film timeless and necessary even though it did not hold up well as a film. The Village Voice stated it was \\"A treasure that demands to be unearthed in all its funny-sad tenderness.\\" Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader said \\"If a better film has been made about black ghetto life, I haven't seen it.\\" References External links  * 1983 films 1980s comedy-drama films African-American films American films American independent films English-language films Films directed by Charles Burnett (director) 1983 comedy films 1983 drama films ","title":"My Brother's Wedding"},{"id":"30879036","text":"Nyceryx draudti is a moth of the family Sphingidae.

His film The Railroad Porter, released in 1912, is credited as being the world's first film with an entirely black cast and director.The Railroad Porter at IMDb. The film is also credited with being the first black newsreel, featuring images of a YMCA parade.Gaines, Jane M. Fire and Desire: Mixed-Race Movies in the Silent Era. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2001, p. 95. Foster's company produced four films that were silent shorts.  Biography  He was born in Chicago, Illinois in 1884. William Foster started his career as a sports writer for the Chicago Defender, a local African-American newspaper, writing under the name Juli Jones. The Defender had recently been established in 1905 by Robert Sengstacke Abbott and by the First World War, it became the nation's \\"most influential Black weekly newspaper.\\"Chicago Defender. Foster periodically wrote for other newspapers as well, still under the penname Juli Jones, including an article for the Indianapolis Freeman published in 1913, in which he \\"sketches out the public disclosure on the representation of blacks in white-produced films, a disclosure that would define the terms of the debate for the rest of the century\\". In addition to being a writer, Foster was a press agent for vaudeville stars such as Bert Williams and George Walker (vaudeville) and also worked as a booking agent and business manager for Chicago's Pekin Theater, which at the time was a well known vaudeville house.Mark A. Reid, Redefining Black Film. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1993, p. 7. With these connections, he had his foot in the door of the theater industry for years before he started his own film company. In 1910 he founded the Foster Photoplay Company, which is credited as the first African-American independent film company.Berry, Torriano and Venise T. Berry. The 50 Most Influential Black Films: A Celebration of African American Talent, Determination, and Creativity. New York: Citadel Press, 2001, 11. Foster stated that ‚ÄúIt [the film industry] is the Negro businessman's only international chance to make money and put his race right with the world.\\"Gaines, Jane M. Fire and Desire: Mixed-Race Movies in the Silent Era. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2001, 94. His goal was not only business success but also to show that African Americans could improve their image and standing all over the world. From the start Foster intended to leave his mark on the film industry and make an impact on the culture of his time and the culture of the future. In the words of film critic Thomas R. Cripps, Foster was ‚Äúa clever hustler from Chicago, he had been a press agent for the [Bert] Williams and [George] Walker revues and [Bob] Cole and Johnson's A Trip to Coontown [circa 1898], a sportswriter for the [Chicago] Defender, an occasional actor under the name of Juli Jones, and finally a purveyor of sheet music and Haitian coffee. He may have made the first black movie, The Railroad Porter, an imitation of Keystone comic chases completed perhaps three years before The Birth of a Nation [February 8, 1915].\\"Reid, Mark A. Black Lenses, Black Voices: African American Film Now. Lanham: Rowman and Littlefield Publishers, Inc., 2005, p. 7. He died in Chicago, Illinois on 15 April 1940. The Foster Photoplay Company The movie industry was still fairly new to the media world and offered potential for all sorts of people to get involved. William Foster took hold of this growing industry and quickly made his mark in it. He established the Foster Photoplay Company in 1910 and its films portrayed African Americans ‚Äúin slapstick humor where a character might first slip, get his head stuck in a barrel, and then be spanked by another Black person wielding a wooden plank\\".Algernon Rhines, Jesse. Black Film, White Money. New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 1996, 14. Slapstick comedy, in which the humor derived from characters making a complete fool of themselves, was a comedic genre typical at the time of silent films. The Foster Photoplay Company helped set up the tradition of black comedies and also established Foster‚Äôs place in the film industry. The short films he produced and directed showcased all-black casts, with a positive look on the black culture and the African-American community as a whole, with a view to correcting the negative images prevalent in Hollywood. After The Railroad Porter was released, Foster used his connections from his days working as a press agent at the Pekin Theater to get African-American film stars to play in his short films. More black production companies started in Chicago prior to the coming of sound than in any other city.Reid, Redefining Black Film (1993), p. 12. In 1914, Foster went on a tour to the south to promote his three films released in 1913: The Fall Guy, The Butler, and The Grafter and the Maid. Along with those releases, The Railroad Porter was also promoted by the leading lady, Lottie Grady, who would sing in front of the audiences while the film reels were changed between the shorts.Reid, Redefining Black Film (1993), p. 8. Foster's company produced films from 1910 to 1913, but eventually folded, due to distribution problems. In 1915, however, the Lincoln Motion Picture Company came into being, building on Foster's groundwork to produce various films including The Realization of a Negro's Ambition in 1916 and The Trooper of Company K in 1917. Films Four films were produced by the Foster Photoplay Company, the most notable being The Railroad Porter; produced in 1912, and Foster's most financially successful movie. The movie premiered in Chicago at the States and Grand Theater and was an instant success. A synopsis from September 25, 1913, from the New York Age states that the film \\"dealt with a young wife, who thinking her husband had gone out on 'his run,' invited a fashionably dressed chap, who was a waiter at one of the colored cafes on State Street, to dine. However, the husband did not go out, and, upon returning home found wifey sitting at the table serving the waiter all the delicacies of the season. Mr. Husband proceeds to get his revolver, which he uses carelessly, running the unwelcome visitor back to his home. Then the waiter gets his revolver and returns the compliment‚Ä¶ no one is hurt‚Ä¶ and all ends happily.\\" The movie was one of the first to represent blacks in a positive manner. Also, it has been said to be one of the first films to showcase a chase sequence. In 1913 Foster produced three more silent shorts: The Fall Guy was another slapstick comedy like The Railroad Porter, The Butler was a detective story, and The Grafter and the Maid was Foster's only melodrama. He worked to produce comedies that would appeal to a wide range of viewers, but his use of an all-black cast, director, producer and crew was significant. Film before Foster In the late 19th century, blacks were portrayed in white films, even sometimes as soldiers, as in Edison‚Äôs films The Colored Troops Disembarking and shortly after The Ninth Negro Cavalry Watering Horses. Films such as these were stopped being produced abruptly and the comedic and degrading depiction of African Americans became dominant in the white film industry. In 1898, the film A Trip to Coontown was made by Bob Cole. It was the first musical in New York written, performed and directed by blacks, and it played on the stereotypes of minstrel theatre.John Kenrick, \\"History of the Musical Stage, The 1890s: Part I ‚Äì Early Black Musicals\\". This film was one of the first that showed that African Americans too could produce entertaining films about blacks, but ones that did not degrade them altogether. These films, along with those of Foster years later, showed that African Americans were starting to fight back against harmful racial stereotypes. The NAACP began to get involved in the 1910s by criticizing films such as The Nigger from 1914 and The Birth of a Nation in 1915 for depicting blacks in a degrading manner.Rhines, Black Film, White Money (1996), p. 15. Racial stereotypes in film When Foster began making films, racial stereotypes of blacks flooded the industry. In the early 20th century, blackface was still being used to represent blacks in film. Blackface involved white actors covering their faces completely with a black substance-like make- up. The actors drew on huge, pretentious red lips to make the face even more over the top. This technique emphasized the racial stereotypes that existed and was most prominent starting in the mid-19th century. Minstrel shows showcased blackface actors at the expense of the African-American community. The shows made fun of blacks and impersonated them by making them look like buffoons and imbeciles, using stereotypical characters such as the mammy figure ‚Äì a dark-skinned, large female who watched over the white children ‚Äì Sambo, a young male who is lazy and always lounging around; and Uncle Tom, a docile and loved family member who works on the plantation. Early minstrelsy involved a white man painted with a blackface, but as time progressed and blacks became a part of the film world, blacks started to impersonate themselves with blackface. Minstrelsy remains a controversial issue; some see it as a racist, while others see it as tradition. It is a form of entertainment prevalent for more than one hundred years, and still exists in world culture today. Films such as Spike Lee's Bamboozled (2000), about a black television executive who decides to make a minstrel show and is appalled by its success, still convey the same stereotypes that Foster was trying to convey nearly one hundred years earlier. Foster tried to break down these stereotypes. Entering an industry that had never had much positive African- American influence before, he ignited a spark in the African-American community for decades to come. Race films Foster was also in the forefront of race films ‚Äì films that were made with an all-black cast, featuring black people and black lifestyle, for a black audience, and shown to segregated African-American viewers. The history of race films began with Foster in 1910 and the comedic shorts produced by the Foster Photoplay Company. \\"These independent productions provided black viewers with images of African-American experience that were conspicuously absent from Hollywood films, including black romance, urban migration, social upheaval, racial violence, alcoholism and color prejudice within the black community\\".Golus, Carrie. \\"Doc films screening pre-1950s 'race films' that students will be discussing in seminar\\", Chicago Chronicle. The University of Chicago, January 10, 2002. Web January 28, 2011. The genres range from comedies and western shows, to dramas and horror flicks. These race films were samong the most successful independent films due to their appeal to the African-American community. They were entertaining and provided an atmosphere entirely produced and featured by African Americans. The Foster Photoplay Company helped to introduce the idea of race films that enabled African Americans to depict their own image in the way they wanted. \\"Race films by maverick African-American directors such as Oscar Micheaux and Spencer Williams laid the groundwork for later black filmmaking, from the commercial successes of 1970s 'blaxploitation' films to the stylistic references and social commentary of Charles Burnett, Julie Dash and Spike Lee,‚Äù said Jacqueline Stewart, Professor in English, Cinema and Media studies, and African and African-American studies. This filmmaking and inspiration all of which started from William Foster and his few silent, short race flicks. The end of Foster Film Once the Foster Photoplay Company went under after 1913, even with all its success, Foster relocated. At one point he even sent reels of his films overseas to the men fighting in World War I, so they could see what he was trying to do back home in the States to help the fight for racial equality. During the 1920s, he moved to Los Angeles to produce musical shorts of black entertainers for Pathe Studios, and then tried to establish a second incarnation of his film production company. However, around this same time, silent films were beginning to be overshadowed by the introduction of sound in the movie industry, and Foster's second shot at the Foster Photoplay Company went out of business before it even produced its first film. Legacy Foster influenced many African Americans to break into the realm of film, and after his company diminished many others followed in his direction. Within a few years George Johnson opened the Lincoln Motion Picture Company; shortly afterwards, other companies such as the Ebony Film Corp. started producing race films. By the 1920s, more than thirty film production companies had been set up to produce films about blacks and their lives. The Lincoln Motion Picture Company was known for making melodramatic films that always portrayed a black hero who prevailed and raised the image of his culture and people. Films of this nature would decades later come to be known as Blaxplotation films. Nonetheless, a few decades after Foster's heyday, major motion picture corporations started to feature blacks on film. While these films were nothing like those of the independently run film corporations such as Foster's, whose focus was primarily on uplifting the black image, they represented the expansion of African-American influence in the industry that \\"race films\\" such as those produced by Foster pioneered.

The Beria townsite was surveyed and gazetted in 1905. Later in 1936 a new townsite was gazetted immediately to the south to allow an increased buffer area with the Lancefield mine plant.Western Australian Government Gazette, file 3797/05, 21 December 1936, p.2073 The Indigenous Australian word for the area is Tinbeeringtharra but the name Beria, another Indigenous Australian word meaning large open field was suggested by the surveyor John Rowe as a more suitable alternative. Gold was discovered in the area just north of the later townsite by prospectors Lemon, Hungerford, Elmes and Clement in 1897. Lemon named the mining claim Lancefield after his hometown in Victoria. The manager of the Mount Malcolm mine at Murrin Murrin, W. Thomas Horton, became interested in the find and formed a syndicate in 1898. A battery was erected close to the reef and production began in January 1899. In less than two years, the battery treated 16,000 tonnes of ore and recovered 7,200 ounces of gold. The Lancefield Goldmining Company, based in London, took over the mine in 1904 with Herbert Hoover as one of the directors. By 1905 the mine had produced 54,909 ounces of gold. The mine then experienced problems when sulphide ores containing arsenic and copper were found and the entire plant had to be shut down and reorganised to a dry crushing and roasting plant. Roasters were installed to roast the ore with each requiring 2,000 tons of wood to roast 7,000 tons of ore. A tramway was constructed between the mine and Laverton by the Kalgoorlie and Boulder Firewood company in 1908, to collect and deliver wood from surrounding areas to feed the roasters and boilers, and for underground mine support. The plant was in liquidation by 1913 and was eventually bought in 1914 by the Kalgoorlie and Boulder Firewood company, who changed the name to the Beria Consuls Mines. The mine changed ownership again in 1915 to the Lancefield company, run by George Ridgway, Dick Hamilton and Frank A. Moss. The tramway was no longer operating and was removed by 1916. The Lancefield company operated the mine until 1940. By the 1950s the mine had produced over 552,000 ounces of gold and 52,000 ounces of silver. The main stack of the mine was demolished in 1984.

Jagabandhu Bidyadhara Mohapatra Bhramarbara Rai popularly known as \\"Bakshi Jagabandhu ()\\" or \\"Paika Bakshi\\" was the commander (Bakshi) of the forces of the king of Khordha. He is one of the earliest freedom fighters of India. The great Paika rebellion in 1817 was under his leadership.The BJB College in Bhubaneswar has been named after this great personality. Life Jagabandhu Bidyadhara had got the title of Bakshi in inheritance from his ancestors which represents the rank of the commander of the forces of the King of Khurda. It was the rank second only to the king. His family was provided with Jagirs (grants of lands and other requisites) and the estate of ‚ÄòKilla Roranga‚Äô for generations by the King of Khurda. The Paika Rebellion It was the first rebellion of the Paika (soldiers of Odisha) with the support of common people against the British Rule. The land revenue policy of the British was the primary cause of the rebellion in 1817. The rent-free land tenures provided to the soldiers for their military service on a hereditary basis were taken away in the settlement by Major Fletcher as their service were not required anymore. This policy resulted in the deprivation of Bakshi Jagabandhu from his estates and forced him to depend on the voluntary contributions from the people of Khurda. This policy also affected the zamindars as well as ryots. Another important cause for that great event was the raise in salt price. As a result, Bakshi Jagabandhu led the tribals of Banapur and Ghumsur and bravely marched towards Khurda to fight against colonial power. The rebellion received extensive support from the common people. Even the Kandhas of Banapur became successful in their revolutionary activities. The rebellion was expanded throughout the state and continued for a quite long time. However, the fewer paika were unable to defend the well equipped British counterpart and receded back to the jungles. In this operation bands of paika were hunted down and many were brutally murdered.

It was composed of two parts, the Home Office Drugs Inspectorate (HODI) and the Drug Legislation Enforcement Unit. The latter section issued the required licences and gave permission to make, possess and deliver controlled drugs, and also licenced the import and export of the same. The Inspectorate's inspectors inspect manufacturers and suppliers. The inspectors were not pharmacists or doctors and their experience was built up 'on the job' or by reference to previous cases. They could inspect general practitioner's surgeries, but only when they were notified that a problem may exist. The inspectors had an important role in the early days of drug abuse, when some doctors were accused of over-prescribing drugs of dependence. Some inspectors, for instance, Henry Bryan \\"Bing\\" Spear, were of historical importance. Bing Spear was employed by the Home Office Drugs Branch from 1952‚Äì1986 and was its Chief Inspector from 1977. He was unusual for the time (maybe even today) for a civil servant in that he had an informal approach to both the addicts and the doctors who treated them.

The film was based on the play of the same title by Arnold Ridley. It was produced by Michael Balcon for Gainsborough Pictures in a co-production with the German firm Felsom Film. Plot A criminal referred to by the press as \\"The Wrecker\\" is orchestrating accidents on Britain's railways. One such accident occurs on the (fictional) United Coast Lines Railway, whose train is carrying Roger Doyle (Joseph Striker), who has retired from Cricket to work on the railway. Roger survives, and reports the accident to his uncle, Sir Gerald Bartlett (Winter Hall), the managing director of the railway, and his assistant, the sly Ambrose Barney (Carlyle Blackwell). Unbeknownst to them, Ambrose is The Wrecker, and is also the head of the Kyle Motor-Coach Company, whose buses are introduced on services where The Wrecker has struck, hoping to frighten passengers off of the trains and onto buses. When Sir Gerald becomes suspicious of Ambrose following yet another accident, he is shot dead. After receiving a tip-off from one of Ambrose's employees, Roger and bumbling detective Ramesses Ratchett (Leonard Thompson) foil another planned accident, much to the delight of the press. Ambrose, enraged at being foiled, plans another accident, but his conversation is recorded onto a wax cylinder by Roger and his girlfriend, Mary Shelton (Benita Hume), Sir Gerald's secretary who had been on the train that Roger had saved from disaster. On hearing the wax cylinder that exposes his crimes, Ambrose shoots the phonograph, destroying the cylinder, and flees from Roger and Mary, only to find himself on the very train that is to be wrecked. Ambrose holds Roger at gunpoint, but is attacked from behind by Mary and subdued, and the train is brought to a safe halt. With Ambrose defeated, Roger and Mary profess their love for each other, disappearing in a cloud of steam as the train reverses away. Cast Production The film was shot as a silent, with a soundtrack was later added. The crash scene was filmed at Herriard on the Basingstoke and Alton Light Railway. A set of SECR coaches and a SECR F1 Class locomotive No. A148 were released on an incline to collide into a Foden steam lorry. The impact, which destroyed the locomotive and the lorry, was recorded by 22 cameras and has been described as \\"the most spectacular rail crash in cinema history.\\" Restoration The film has been restored, with a new musical score by the composer Neil Brand. On 26 November 2009 it was launched at a special screening at the Watercress Line, a heritage railway close to where the filming took place.

Written by Steven Bullard to cover overseas emergency relief operations between 1918 and 2006, including Papua New Guinea, Sumatra, Pakistan, Iran, and various Pacific nations. Development and publication In 2002 the Australian War Memorial (AWM) engaged Professor David Horner to investigate the feasibility of developing an official history of Australian peacekeeping activities. The Howard Government subsequently approved this project in 2004, and appointed Horner to be the official historian. However, it did not allocate any funding for the series. An arrangement was eventually negotiated whereby the Department of Defence paid Horner's salary, and the AWM and Australian Research Council also contributed funds to cover other costs. Volume II, entitled Australia and the 'New World Order': From Peacekeeping to Peace Enforcement, 1988‚Äì1991, was the first work in the series to be published and was released in February 2011. The book was officially launched by Foreign Minister and former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd on 11 April. Volume III, The Good International Citizen: Australian Peacekeeping in Asia, Africa and Europe 1991‚Äì1993, was published in 2014 and launched by Minister for Defence David Johnston on 2 July that year. The completion of the series has been delayed, with Horner attributing this to a shortage of funding. By 2014 all the funding for the project had been spent, and Volume V, The Good Neighbour: Australian Peace Support Operations in the Pacific Islands 1980‚Äì2006, had been awaiting clearance by government agencies since 2011. Volume VI, In Their Time of Need: Australian Overseas Emergency Relief Operations, was completed in 2015. During 2015 the Department of Defence provided additional funding for the project after being encouraged to do so by Prime Minister Tony Abbott. After this money became available work on the two remaining volumes resumed, and they are scheduled to be published during 2016. Volume V was published in July 2016. From an early stage in the project Horner sought to have an additional volume added to the series covering Australia's involvement in peacekeeping operations in East Timor, as well as the War in Afghanistan and Iraq War. The AWM eventually commissioned a study into the feasibility of an official history of these engagements in 2011, which Horner completed in 2012. However, efforts to gain government approval for the project were delayed by the two changes in the prime ministership during 2013. A separate series was eventually authorised by the Abbott Government in April 2015, and $12.8 million was allocated to the AWM for the Official History of Australian Operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, and Australian Peacekeeping Operations in East Timor as part of the 2015‚Äì16 federal budget.

It is one of the Air Force's original units, dating back to the service's formation in 1921, when it was established at RAAF Point Cook, Victoria. By the early 1930s, the school comprised training, fighter, and seaplane components. It was re-formed several times in the ensuing years, initially as No. 1 Service Flying Training School (No. 1 SFTS) in 1940, under the wartime Empire Air Training Scheme. After graduating nearly 3,000 pilots, No. 1 SFTS was disbanded in late 1944, when there was no further requirement to train Australian aircrew for service in Europe. The school was re- established in 1946 as No. 1 FTS at RAAF Station Uranquinty, New South Wales, and transferred to Point Cook the following year. Under a restructure of flying training to cope with the demands of the Korean War and Malayan Emergency, No. 1 FTS was re-formed in 1952 as No. 1 Applied Flying Training School (No. 1 AFTS); it moved to RAAF Base Pearce, Western Australia, in 1958. For much of this period the school was also responsible for training the RAAF's air traffic controllers. Its pilot trainees included Army, Navy, and foreign students as well as RAAF personnel. The RAAF's reorganisation of aircrew training in the early 1950s had led to the formation at Uranquinty of No. 1 Basic Flying Training School (No. 1 BFTS), which transferred to Point Cook in 1958. In 1969, No. 1 AFTS was re-formed as No. 2 Flying Training School and No. 1 BFTS was re-formed as No. 1 FTS. Rationalisation of RAAF flying training resulted in the disbandment of No. 1 FTS in 1993. The school re-formed at RAAF Base East Sale in 2019, flying the Pilatus PC-21 and conducting ab initio flight training. History =Early years= alt=Manned single-engined military biplane parked on airfield No. 1 Flying Training School (No. 1 FTS) was the first unit to be formally established as part of the new Australian Air Force on 31 March 1921 (the term \\"Royal\\" was added in August that year). No. 1 FTS was formed from the remnants of Australia's original military flying unit, Central Flying School, at RAAF Point Cook, Victoria.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, p. 41Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, p. 29 Squadron Leader William Anderson, who was also in charge of the Point Cook base, was No. 1 FTS's first commanding officer. The school's initial complement of staff was twelve officers and 67 airmen. In December 1921, the Australian Air Board prepared to form its first five squadrons and allocate aircraft to each, as well as to the nascent flying school. The plan was for No. 1 FTS to receive twelve Avro 504Ks and four Sopwith Pups, and the squadrons a total of eight Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5s, eight Airco DH.9s, and three Fairey IIIs.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, p. 42 Funding problems forced the Air Force to disband the newly raised squadrons on 1 July 1922 and re-form them as flights in a composite squadron under No. 1 FTS.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, p. 43 The same month, Flight Lieutenant Frank McNamara, VC, took command of the school. The inaugural flying course commenced in January 1923. Basic instruction took place on the Avro 504Ks, and more advanced or specialised training on the school's other aircraft. Fourteen students commenced the year-long course, and twelve graduated.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 34‚Äì35 As well as flying, they studied aeronautics, communications, navigation, armament and general military subjects.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, p. 199 Squadron Leader Anderson resumed command of No. 1 FTS in 1925; the following year he handed over to Wing Commander Adrian Cole, who led the unit until 1929. The first Citizen Air Force (active reserve) pilots' course ran from December 1925 to March 1926, 26 of 30 students completing the training. Although 24 accidents occurred, there were no fatalities, leading Cole to remark at the graduation ceremony that the students were either made of India rubber or had learned how to crash \\"moderately safely\\".Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, p. 37Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, pp. 234‚Äì238 However, the 1926 Permanent Air Force (PAF) cadet course was marred by three fatal accidents.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, p. 207 The following year, 29 students graduated‚Äîthirteen PAF, nine reserve, and seven destined for exchange with the Royal Air Force (RAF).Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force, p. 28 In June 1928, the school's Avro 504Ks were replaced by de Havilland DH.60 Cirrus Moths; these were augmented by Gipsy Moths commencing in 1930.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, p. 173 A cadet prepares for a solo training flight in a Westland Wapiti at No. 1 FTS, Point Cook, 1938 Squadron Leader McNamara resumed command of No. 1 FTS in October 1930. By then, two sub-units had been raised at Point Cook under the school's auspices: \\"Fighter Squadron\\", operating Bristol Bulldogs; and \\"Seaplane Squadron\\", operating Supermarine Southamptons, among other types.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, pp. 186‚Äì187 As of February 1934, No. 1 FTS was organised into Training Squadron, operating Moths and Westland Wapitis, Fighter Squadron and Seaplane Squadron. Fighter and Seaplane Squadrons were formally established as units that month,RAAF Historical Section, Fighter Units, pp. 146‚Äì147RAAF Historical Section, Maritime and Transport Units, pp. 187‚Äì190 but remained under the control of the flying school and were \\"really little more than flights\\", according to the official history of the pre-war RAAF.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, pp. 127‚Äì128 As well as participating in training exercises, Fighter Squadron was often employed for aerobatic displays and flag-waving duties.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, pp. 104, 405 One of No. 1 FTS's leading instructors during the early 1930s, Flight Lieutenant Frederick Scherger, was also a flight commander in Fighter Squadron.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, pp. 188‚Äì189, 202‚Äì203 Seaplane Squadron undertook naval co- operation and survey tasks, as well as seaplane training.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, pp. 186‚Äì187, 380‚Äì381 Fighter Squadron was dissolved in December 1935 when its Bulldogs were transferred to No. 1 Squadron at RAAF Laverton, while Seaplane Squadron continued to function until June 1939, when it was separated to form the nucleus of No. 10 Squadron. In 1932, No. 1 FTS started running two courses each year, the first commencing in January and the second in July; it also ceased graduating non-commissioned officers as pilots, and thus took on a character resembling the other armed services' cadet colleges, the Royal Australian Naval College and the Royal Military College, Duntroon.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, pp. 200‚Äì201 The roughly 1,200 applications for each flying course competed for around twelve places.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, p. 205 Wing Commander Hippolyte De La Rue became commanding officer in early 1933.Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, p. 271 The following year, No. 1 FTS commenced regular courses in signals, photography, air observation, and aircraft maintenance.Coulthard- Clark, The Third Brother, p. 198 In April 1936, the school took delivery of its first Avro Cadets, procured as an intermediate trainer to bridge the gap between the Gipsy Moth employed for elementary flying instruction and the Wapiti used for advanced training.Wilson, Military Aircraft of Australia, p. 22 De La Rue was succeeded by Wing Commander Frank Lukis in January 1938. By this time the school was training up to 96 new pilots per year, a small percentage of whom were slated for secondment to the RAF on short-service commissions.Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force, p. 44 Link Trainer simulators were introduced in March 1939. =World War II= alt=Man in dark military uniform in the arms of a female civilian, among a crowd of other civilian and military people RAAF flying training was heavily reorganised soon after the outbreak of World War II, in response to Australia's participation in the Empire Air Training Scheme (EATS). Several elementary flying training schools were formed, to provide basic flight instruction to cadets, while more advanced pilot instruction was to take place at service flying training schools.Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 72‚Äì73Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force, p. 97 On 1 May 1940, No. 1 FTS was re-formed at Point Cook as No. 1 Service Flying Training School (No. 1 SFTS). Its inaugural commanding officer was Group Captain John Summers, who led Fighter Squadron in the early 1930s and had taken over No. 1 FTS in December 1939.RAAF Historical Section, Training Units, pp. 100‚Äì101Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, p. 104 The school's Instructors' Training Squadron was detached to become the nucleus of a re-formed Central Flying School, which relocated to Camden, New South Wales, in June. Courses at the service flying training schools consisted of two streams, intermediate and advanced; the total duration varied during the war as demand for aircrew fluctuated. Initially running for sixteen weeks, the course was cut to ten weeks (which included 75 hours flying time) in October 1940. A year later it was raised to twelve weeks (including 100 hours flying time), and again to sixteen weeks two months later. It continued to increase after this, peaking at 28 weeks in June 1944.Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force, p. 109 No. 1 SFTS came under the control of Southern Area Command, headquartered in Melbourne.Ashworth, How Not to Run an Air Force!, p. 34 The school's complement of 52 aircraft included Wapitis, Cadets, Avro Ansons, Hawker Demons, and a de Havilland Tiger Moth. Group Captain John McCauley served as commanding officer from October 1940 until July 1941, when he handed over to Wing Commander Roy King, who went on to take charge of Station Headquarters Point Cook in October. As of July, No. 1 SFTS was operating more than 100 aircraft, including Gipsy Moths, de Havilland DH.89 Dragon Rapides, Douglas C-47 Dakotas, CAC Wirraways and Airspeed Oxfords, the last two being the mainstays. In August 1941, control of all training units in Victoria passed from Southern Area Command to the newly formed No. 1 Training Group.Ashworth, How Not to Run an Air Force!, p. 46 By September, the school had an establishment of 100 officers and over 2,000 airmen, including 300 cadets. It was organised into Intermediate Training Squadron, Advanced Training Squadron, Maintenance Wing, Armament School, and Signal School. Wing Commander Charles Read held command of No. 1 SFTS from October 1943 until its disbandment on 15 September 1944, by which time almost 3,000 pilots had graduated. Among these were Nicky Barr, who became one of Australia's leading fighter aces in North Africa, and Bill Newton, awarded the Victoria Cross for bombing raids in New Guinea.Weate, Bill Newton VC, pp. 19‚Äì22 The RAAF had ordered the school's closure in August 1944 as part of a general reduction in aircrew training, after being informed by the British Air Ministry that it no longer required EATS graduates for the war in Europe. Significant reserves of trained Commonwealth aircrew had been built up in the UK early in 1944 prior to the invasion of Normandy, but lower-than-anticipated casualties had resulted in an over-supply that by 30 June numbered 3,000 Australians.Herington, Air Power Over Europe, pp. 283‚Äì285 =Cold War= alt=Piston-engined military monoplane parked at an airfield On 1 March 1946, No. 5 Service Flying Training School at RAAF Station Uranquinty, New South Wales, was re-formed as No. 1 FTS, under Southern Area Command. Its complement of aircraft included one Anson, two Tiger Moths, and 55 Wirraways, though the unit was mainly responsible for the maintenance of equipment and little flying was undertaken apart from refresher courses for pilots posting to the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan. By 1 September 1947, No. 1 FTS had transferred to Point Cook, initially as \\"Flying Training School\\", under Wing Commander Read. The RAAF's first post-war flying training course at the school consisted of 42 students and commenced in February 1948, finishing in August the following year.Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 145‚Äì146 Flight grading took place after six months of general military training, at which point students were selected to be trainee pilots or navigators; the former remained at No. 1 FTS, while the latter transferred to the School of Air Navigation at RAAF Base East Sale, Victoria. Unlike some other air forces, which placed students into specialised aircraft roles after basic training, the RAAF's philosophy was to give all pilots essentially the same training from induction to graduation, so they would be able to convert more easily from one aircraft type to another as operational requirements evolved.Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 147‚Äì148 In September 1949, Read handed over to Squadron Leader Glen Cooper, who commanded the school until August 1951. In response to demands for more aircrew to fulfil Australia's commitments to the Korean War and Malayan Emergency, flying training underwent major changes in 1951‚Äì52, the syllabus at No. 1 FTS being split among three separately located units.Stephens, Going Solo, p. 149 No. 1 Initial Flying Training School (No. 1 IFTS) was raised at RAAF Station Archerfield, Queensland, to impart students with general aeronautical and military knowledge, after which they received their flight grading during twelve hours on Tiger Moths. Graduate pilots of No. 1 IFTS went on to the newly formed No. 1 Basic Flying Training School (No. 1 BFTS) at Uranquinty, where they underwent a further 90 hours of aerial instruction that included instrument, formation and night flying, first on Tiger Moths and then on Wirraways. Successful students finally transferred to No. 1 FTS, which was renamed No. 1 Applied Flying Training School (No. 1 AFTS) in March 1952. There they undertook 100 flying hours of advanced weapons and combat training on Wirraways, before graduating as sergeant pilots.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 199‚Äì200 RAAF College, formed at Point Cook in 1947, was to be the Air Force's primary source of commissioned officers.Stephens, Going Solo, p. 151 The Tiger Moths and Wirraways of No. 1 BFTS were subsequently replaced by the CAC Winjeel, first delivered in 1955. alt=Single-engined military jet with twin tailbooms in flight By the time it was re-formed as No. 1 AFTS, the flying school at Point Cook had also been made responsible for training the RAAF's air traffic controllers; this role was transferred to Central Flying School at East Sale in December 1956.Stephens, Going Solo, p. 150 Southern Area Command was re-formed as Training Command in September 1953.Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 73‚Äì75 On 28 May 1958, No. 1 AFTS relocated to RAAF Base Pearce, Western Australia, where its Wirraways were replaced by de Havilland Vampire jet trainers, which required a runway longer than that at Point Cook.RAAF Historical Section, Training Units, p. 40 The school's place at Point Cook was taken by No. 1 BFTS, which transferred from Uranquinty on 19 December. By this time the RAAF had decided to commission all pilots and navigators, who would be selected for these roles upon induction into the service; navigators therefore went straight to the School of Air Navigation at East Sale, without attending flying training school. On 31 December 1958, the Flying Training Squadron of RAAF College was disbanded, and the flight instruction component of the four-year cadet course became the responsibility of No. 1 BFTS (for basic training) and No. 1 AFTS (for advanced training). Previously, the cadets had used FTS aircraft under RAAF College instructors, but from 1959 their flight training was fully integrated with the FTS system.Frost, RAAF College & Academy, p. 41 The demand for trained aircrew, which had lessened in the mid-1950s, rose again the following decade as a result of the RAAF embarking on a major re-equipment program, and Australia's increasing involvement in the Vietnam War. The RAAF also had an ongoing commitment to providing flying training to students from the Australian Army and Royal Australian Navy. By adding instructors and increasing the ratio of pupils to instructors, the number of Air Force graduates was progressively raised from 38 in 1963, to 100 in 1968.Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 151, 156‚Äì157 Also in 1968, Macchi MB-326H jet trainers began replacing the Vampires of No. 1 AFTS. The introduction of the Macchi led to a brief flirtation with \\"all- through\\" jet training in the Air Force, consisting of 210 hours on this one type of aircraft. The experiment was dropped after two courses as being, in the words of the official historian of the post-war RAAF, \\"an expensive way of finding out that some pupils lacked the aptitude to become military pilots\\"; by 1971 students were receiving 60 hours of basic training on Winjeels at Point Cook, and the Maachi course at Pearce was reduced to 150 hours.Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 153‚Äì154 On 31 December 1968, No. 1 AFTS was disbanded at Pearce, re-forming on 1 January 1969 as No. 2 Flying Training School . At the same time, No. 1 BFTS was disbanded at Point Cook and re-formed as No. 1 FTS. CT-4 trainers lined up for auction at alt=Single-engined military monoplanes with open canopies parked on an airfield The Winjeels of No. 1 FTS were replaced by CT-4A Airtrainers in late 1975. The first CT-4 pilots' course of 34 students included six from the Royal Australian Navy and three from Malaysia. By 1977, the school was organised into Air Training, Ground Training and Maintenance Squadrons. As well as maintaining its own aircraft, it was responsible for technical support of other units at Point Cook. The Queen's Colour was presented to No. 1 FTS by the Governor-General, Sir Zelman Cowen, in 1981. In November 1989, one of the school's CT-4s re-created the first trans-Australia flight that had taken place 70 years before, when Captain Henry Wrigley and Sergeant Arthur \\"Spud\\" Murphy flew a Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2 biplane from Point Cook to Darwin, Northern Territory, between 16 November and 12 December 1919.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, p. 26 A review of undergraduate flying training, commissioned by the Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Ray Funnell, and aimed at reducing failure rates and improving cost-effectiveness, saw the retirement of the CT-4s in December 1992, followed by the closure of No. 1 FTS. The last RAAF flying course completed on 12 June 1992, and the last Army pilots' course in December. The school was disbanded on 31 January 1993, bringing to an end almost 80 years of military flying training at Point Cook, Australia's oldest military air base.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 309‚Äì310 The occasion was marked by a parading of the Queen's Colour and a flypast by six CT-4s in front of the new CAS, Air Marshal Barry Gration. This was followed by a service at the RAAF Chapel of the Holy Trinity overflown by four Winjeels and a Tiger Moth, and later an all-ranks dining-in night. Concurrent with the phase-out of training at No. 1 FTS, British Aerospace was contracted to conduct flight grading at its base in Tamworth, New South Wales. Subsequent all-through flight training on the Pilatus PC-9 took place at No. 2 FTS, Pearce. In 1998, British Aerospace was granted a contract to supply tri-service basic flying instruction at the newly formed Australian Defence Force Basic Flying Training School (ADFBFTS) in Tamworth, the first course commencing in January 1999 on CT-4B Airtrainers, and No. 2 FTS again became responsible for advanced flying training only. ADFBFTS thus became, according to the school's head of training, \\"the No. 1 Flying Training School you have when you don't have a No. 1 Flying Training School\\". =Reactivation= Following the disbandment of the ADFBFTS, No. 1 FTS was re-formed in January 2019 at RAAF Base East Sale to conduct basic flying training on the Pilatus PC-21. The school commenced its first course since reactivation on 14 January, and ten students graduated on 12 July. The re-formed No. 1 FTS came under the control of Air Academy, part of Air Force Training Group.

Skate4Cancer is a foundation created by Rob Dyer after losing many of his loved ones to cancer. The main idea behind Skate4Cancer is that the cure is knowledge. They show you how to prevent cancer so that you can catch it early and hopefully become cancer free as soon as possible. In 2004, Dyer skated over 8000 km from his hometown of Newmarket, Ontario to Los Angeles, California. Just four months prior to his skate, Rob lost his paternal grandmother to stomach cancer. Before he knew it, his maternal grandmother died from brain cancer. After losing two of the most important women in his life, his world was turned upside down when he lost his mother, Wendy, to brain cancer. That wasn't it, right before he set out on his skate, he lost his best friend to stomach cancer. There were many obstacles but Rob and the S4C team finished the skate in 5 months. In 2008, Rob decided he would do yet another cross country skate, this time focusing on Canada. He left Vancouver, BC in June and within 4 days he was already at the Rocky Mountains. They finished their second skate on a late November night in Halifax, NS. Rob and the team traveled to New Zealand and Australia in early 2010. They quickly covered New Zealand, and then made their way to Australia for the second leg of their skate. Almost in Adelaide, Rob was hit by a car while skating one afternoon. He managed to get up and walk a bit to get cell phone service so he could call the van to come pick him up. He immediately went to the doctor, who discovered Rob had a groin injury that would take 4 to 6 weeks to heal. Rob decided to return to Canada, and planned to finish the skate in the following year. Rob ended up skating a total of 3667 km before returning home. Dyer and the team are set to start a France skate on June 21, 2011. In 2011, with help from West49, Skate4Cancer/DreamLoveCure were able to raise over $100,000. through the sales of S4C T-shirts, for Wellspring.ca to help families dealing with cancer. Skate4Cancer has toured with bands such as RocketRocketShip, The Deftones, City and color, Alexisonfire, Silverstein, The Devil Wears Prada, Shad and have also had a booth set up at Warped Tour for the past few years and have a booth at this year's SCENE fest. They stock up on fliers about self breast exams, quitting smoking and other ways to prevent cancer. In 2009 Ashley Kirilow shaved her head and eyebrows and plucked her eyelashes, to masquerade as a cancer sufferer in need of funds on her Facebook page. In 2009, Ashley Kirilow, a woman who shaved her head, plucked her eyebrows and starved herself to appear as a chemotherapy patient, convinced Rob and the team to fly her to Disney World to spend time with her hero, Rob Dyer. Many newspapers showed a collage of a flattering, pre-hoax image of Kirilow, next to an image of a bald Kirilow, with plucked eyebrows and eyelashes, showing the lengths to which a determined hoaxster would go, to seek sympathy. Skate4Cancer sent out a statement saying \\"For your peace of mind, Skate4Cancer has no formal or informal affiliation to Change For A Cure. There have been no jointly held events or fundraising initiatives. Skate4Cancer's involvement with Ms. Kirilow was based solely on fulfilling what the organization believed to be a legitimate final wish from a terminally ill individual. \\" The Cure is Knowledge tour - Established an interactive campaign which encourages healthy living and an active lifestyle focused on cancer prevention while remaining attainable and relevant to the youth demographic. - Revolutionized philanthropy in the music touring industry by collaborating with major festivals and international tours including Warped Tour, NXNE, All Time Low, SHAD and Lights.

Location The theme comprised most of the late antique Roman province of Cappadocia Secunda and parts of Cappadocia Prima. By the early 10th century, it was bounded to the northwest by the Bucellarian Theme, roughly along the line of the Lake Tatta and Mocissus; the Armeniac Theme and later Charsianon to the north, across the river Halys, and to the northeast near Caesarea and the fortress of Rodentos; to the south by the Taurus Mountains and the border with the Caliphate's lands and the Thughur frontier zone in Cilicia; and to the east with the Anatolic Theme, the boundary stretching across Lycaonia from the area of Heraclea Cybistra to Tatta..; , Chapter 2 . History Lying directly north of the Cilician Gates, the Arabs' major invasion route into Asia Minor, the region of Cappadocia suffered greatly from their repeated raids, with its towns and fortresses regularly sacked and the country widely devastated and depopulated.. The cities of Tyana, Heraclea Cybistra and Faustinopolis had all been razed by the Arabs in the early 9th century, and although Cybistra was rebuilt, the populations of the other two cities fled to the fortresses of Nigde and Loulon respectively., Chapter 4.2 . Initially, the later theme was a tourma (division) of the Anatolic Theme. To counter the Arab threat, it was detached as a separate frontier march (a kleisoura) and eventually raised to a full theme. It is first attested as such in 830... According to the Muslim geographers Ibn Khordadbeh and Ibn al-Faqih, the province was heavily fortified with over twenty towns and fortresses, and had a garrison of 4,000 men in the 9th century.; . The theme was also the site of no less than three imperial aplekta, large camps that served as assembly points for the thematic armies during campaigns: Koloneia, Caesarea, and Bathys Ryax., Chapter 4.1 . Its strategos, whose seat was probably the fortress of Koron (modern √á√∂mlek√ßi), and perhaps Tyana at a later stage, drew an annual salary of 20 pounds of gold, and usually held the rank of protospatharios, with a few rising as far as patrikios.., Chapter 3 . The Arab raids remained frequent in the 9th century, and an Arab army occupied Loulon, one of the key fortresses guarding the northern exit of the Cilician Gates, in 833‚Äì879. From the great Byzantine victory at the Battle of Lalakaon in 863, and the destruction of the Paulician state at Tephrike in 872 (or 878) onwards the security situation improved considerably, but the area remained a target of Arab raids. In 897, an Arab raid even sacked the thematic capital, Koron., Chapter 4.2 and Chapter 5 . Under Emperor Leo VI the Wise (r. 886‚Äì912), some of its eastern territory, the bandon of Nyssa, in which Caesarea lay, as well as the tourma of Kase were given to the Charsianon theme. In turn, the theme of Cappadocia was expanded to the northwest to the area of the Salt Lake with territory from the Anatolic and Bucellarian themes, forming the seven banda of the new tourma of Kommata.; , Chapter 4.3 . The fall of Melitene in 934 and the conquests of John Kourkouas removed the immediate threat to the theme. In the 10th century, the depopulated region was settled by Armenians and Syriac Christians. Cappadocia as a whole also became a major power base of the Anatolian military aristocracy ‚Äì in particular the Phokas and Maleinos clans ‚Äì whose extensive estates, large wealth and military prestige posed a serious challenge to the central imperial government and led to successive revolts in the second half of the 10th century. The magnates' power was broken through the confiscation of their estates under Emperor Basil II (r. 976‚Äì1025). Extensive Armenian settlement occurred in the first half of the 11th century, and the first Seljuk raids in the area began c. 1050 and intensified over the next two decades. After the Battle of Manzikert in 1071, most of Cappadocia was lost to the Seljuks.

First announced at Mobile World Congress on February 15, 2011 as a successor to the HTC Desire, it was released on March 8, 2011. The unit shipped with Android (operating system) 2.3.3 (Gingerbread) with HTC Sense 2.1; upgrades were released to Android 2.3.5 with HTC Sense 3.0, and to Android 4.0.4 (Ice Cream Sandwich) with HTC Sense 3.6.  Hardware  The HTC Desire S bears similar internal hardware to its predecessor (HTC Desire). One of the most prominent hardware improvement in the HTC Desire S is the 33% increase in RAM and 100% increase in internal storage capacity. Connectivity in the phone has also seen a noticeable upgrade featuring 14.4 Mbit/s HSDPA and wireless 802.11 b/g/n. The Desire S features an aluminium unibody case and touch-sensitive keys replace the HTC Desire's navigational buttons. The trackball has also been removed. The display is much the same as the HTC Desire: a diagonal 480√ó800px (252 ppi) Super LCD overlaid with Gorilla Glass. A front-facing VGA camera is included on the phone in addition to the 5-megapixel rear camera that was also included on the original HTC Desire. A hardware design flaw or defective eMMC chip in some devices can render the phone unusable (bricked) and require SAT if the battery is removed if the device is on. Updating several applications from market at once can cause the device to not respond, forcing the user to remove the battery to reboot; this is the most usual cause of this problem to appear. The phone's maximum Wi-Fi speed is 72 Mbit/s when using 802.11n.  Software  The device originally shipped with Android 2.3 and included HTC Sense 2.1. It was later upgraded to Android 2.3.5 with HTC Sense 3.0. The new update added HTC Watch to the list of applications, amongst other features, as well as a new design of the lock screen, and the ability to add icons and widgets onto the lock screen. HTC released an update to Android 4.0 and HTC Sense 3.6 in August 2012 through their developer website.

Founded by Richard Edward Norman, the studio produced silent films featuring all- African-American casts from 1920 to 1928. The only surviving studio from the period of early filmmaking in Jacksonville, its facilities are now the Norman Studios Silent Film Museum. One of the most prominent studios creating films for black audiences in the silent era, Norman's films featured all-black casts with protagonists in positive roles. During its run it produced eight feature length films and numerous shorts; its only surviving film, The Flying Ace, has been restored by the Library of Congress. The studio transitioned to distribution and promotion after the rise of talking pictures made its technology obsolete, and eventually closed. In the 21st century, the studio's facilities were restored and re-purposed as a museum. On October 31, 2016, the location was designated a National Historic Landmark. History =Early history= During the early 20th century, the emerging film industry that was traditionally located in New York built a new home in Northeast Florida so they could continue filming during the winter. Jacksonville, home to over thirty silent film studios from 1908 ‚Äì 1922, became known as the \\"Winter Film Capital of the World\\". Eagle Film Studios, which would later become Norman Studios, was built in 1916. The five buildings composing the studio went bankrupt in the following years. =Richard Norman= Richard E. Norman Born in Middleburg, Florida in 1891, Richard Edward Norman started his film career in the Midwest making movies for white audiences in the 1910s. His early work was a series of \\"home talent\\" films, in which he would travel to various towns with stock footage and a basic script; after recruiting local celebrities for minor roles, they would film a small portion of footage (approximately 200 feet of new material) over the course 40 of a few days. These films included The Wrecker and Sleepy Sam the Sleuth, and after they were processed at Norman's laboratory in Chicago, they would be screened and any funds raised would be split between Norman and the town. This led to his filming other events and productions throughout the Midwest, including the play \\"Pro Patria\\" at the University of Illinois‚ÄîUrbana Chamapign. His first silent film with an all black cast was The Green-Eyed Monster (1919), adapted from his earlier home talent film The Wrecker set in the railroad industry, The expanded film included a dramatic story of greed and jealousy with a comedic subplot, and drew on many early racial stereotypes. This initial version of the film received widely mixed reviews. Norman decided to split the film into a drama and a comedy, Green-Eyed Monster and Love Bug, respectively, and the films did significantly better. Norman moved to Jacksonville during the height of the film industry and bought the studio in 1920 at the age of 29. It may be that Norman occupied the studios before purchasing them. The success of the film brought attention to the studio from other African-American actors hoping to star in later films. =Race films= During the time, films with an African- American cast and shown specifically to African-American audiences were known as \\"race films\\". Norman Studios produced several of these films during the 1920s. Richard Norman's reason to produce race films was not solely a business decision. Although the studio was indeed filling a niche, Norman was also motivated by the state of race relations at the time. The untapped black filmgoer market and the plethora of talented performers unable to get work in mainstream films lead to the production of race films by Norman Studios. Poster for Black Gold (1928 film) Later films produced by Norman Studios include: Green-Eyed Monster (1919), a railroad drama; The Love Bug (1919), a comedy; The Bull-Dogger (1921), a western; The Crimson Skull (1922), another western; Regeneration (1923), an action adventure set on an island after a shipwreck; The Flying Ace (1926), Norman's most famous film; and Black Gold (1928), a drama set around the oil business. The Bull Dogger (1921) The Bull-Dogger was Norman's first Western film. Like many of his contemporaries, including Oscar Micheaux, Norman saw the West as the next film frontier. This was especially important for films featuring black actors, as the West was seen as a land of opportunity free from segregation and oppression. Shot in Boley, Oklahoma (a town billed as an exclusively black town), The Bull Dogger features cowboy Bill Picket, Anita Bush, and Norman's favorite one-legged actor, Steve \\"Peg\\" Reynolds. The plot is thin and the storyline is secondary to the action and adventure of the black cowboys. The Crimson Skull (1922) Although Norman had planned to film three Westerns, he only produced two. The Crimson Skull was filmed at the same time as The Bull Dogger, and again features Pickett, Bush, and Peg. Edited, produced, and released in 1922, The Crimson Skull tells the story of a town beset by bandits, led by the infamous 'Skull' (an actor in a skeleton costume). Bob, the ranch hand, must rescue the ranch owner's daughter, Anita (played by Bush), and Peg from the clutches of the outlaws. After Bob infiltrates the gang to free them both, he must stand trail via \\"The Crimson Skull,\\" wherein dripping blood reveals his fate. The bandits are captured and Bob is rewarded with both a financial reward and the hand of Anita. Regeneration (1923) Norman turned to the seas and created Regeneration with Violet Daniels (Stella Mayo) as the orphaned, only child of a widowed sea captain. Jack Roper (M.C. Maxwell), the owner of the Anna Belle fishing schooner and first mate to Violet's father, sets sail with Violet, following a mysterious map for their course. After the pair are forced from the ship and stranded on an island, which they name 'Regeneration,' the pair live out a Robinson Crusoe-esque story, where they best their enemy, find buried treasure, and are safely rescued. This film was an instant hit that benefited from Norman's unique promotional methods. In particular, Norman encouraged theaters to fill their lobbies with sand to draw potential customers in. The Flying Ace (1926) Norman Studios poster for The Flying Ace (1926) The only film from Norman Studios to be restored and kept in the Library of Congress, The Flying Ace was dubbed \\"the greatest airplane thriller ever filmed.\\" It was filmed entirely on the ground, but used camera tricks to imply movement and altitude for the stationary airplanes. The film was inspired by aviators like Bessie Coleman who sent a letter to Norman Studios expressing a wish to create a film based on her life. The plot of the film revolves around a former World War I fighter pilot returning home to his previous job of a railroad company detective. Once back, he has to solve a case involving stolen money and a missing employee in order to catch the thieves. The film is the only one from the period known to have survived. The Library of Congress keeps a copy of the film as it is deemed culturally significant. Nowadays, The Flying Ace is screened occasionally across the nation. Norman created a prop plane for the film. Creative use of the camera created upside down sequences. African Americans were not allowed to serve as pilots in the United States armed forces at the time. Black Gold (1928) For Norman's last feature film, he created a film about oil drilling in the American West based on the story of John Crisp, a black leaseholder who found oil on his Oklahoma property. In the film, Mart Ashton, a rancher, looks to invest in oil wells on his property. His driller secretly conspires with the Ohio Company to take over his well. When Ashton is framed for robbery and thrown into jail, his foreman, Ace, and the bank president's daughter, Alice, team up with Peg to exonerate Ashton. When they are successful, Ace and Alice start their future together. =Studio's decline= Norman Studios' run as a producer of race films came to the advent of talking films. Richard Norman invested and developed a system to sync audio to the moving images. Units were sold to theaters in the nation, but a new method of putting sound-on-film debuted making Norman's system obsolete. Filmmakers were already steadily making an exodus to southern California which emerged as a new hub for films. In 1917, John W. Martin was elected mayor of Jacksonville on an anti-film campaign intending to curb the wild excesses of the film industry. Filmmakers did not help their cause by filming car chases on the streets on Sundays, pulling alarms to film fire trucks, or accidentally inciting riots. By the 1930s, the film industry had moved on from Jacksonville while Norman Studios became a distributor of films and then Richard Norman began exhibiting films in the 1940s. =Gloria Norman School of Dance= Gloria Norman, the wife of Richard Norman, began teaching dance in 1935 on the second floor of the main production and film printing building. Richard, who was still in the film business by producing industrial films for the Pure Oil Co. and distributing Joe Louis fight films, felt the sounds of dancing were too loud. A dance floor was built in the set building which is now used as the site for the Circle of Faith Ministries and is the sole building of the original five not owned by Jacksonville currently. After Gloria sold the studio in 1976, the building became the location for a variety of companies such as plumbing and telephone answering services. Revitalization =Rediscovery= Only when Ann Burt, a local resident, discovered that the dilapidated buildings were actually an important movie studio in another time were efforts made to turn the former site of Norman Studios into a museum. As a member of Old Arlington Inc, an Arlington area preservationist group, Burt was able to bring together others to save the site. =Norman Studios Silent Film Museum= Three years after the movement began, the city of Jacksonville bought four of the original five buildings for $260,000 in April 2002. The structures acquired were the main production and processing building, a small cottage for costume changes, a storage shed, and a building that holds the original power generators for the cameras and lights. It was not until February 2004 that the city received a grant from the state of Florida to help preserve and restore the aging complex. Their $140,000 grant was used for emergency roofing, security lighting, a security system, and the largest chunk was paid to Kenneth Smith Architects to redesign the complex into its future life as the Norman Studios Silent Film Museum. Restoration of the exterior of the property completed in about 2008, while more fundraising has been done to try to purchase the fifth building from the Circle of Faith Ministries. Currently, Jacksonville is beginning the process to transfer the Norman Studios Silent Film Museum to the National Park Service. The move will allow the federal government to pay for the preservation and restoration of the studio as well as the operation of the buildings.

Early life Richard Negri was born on 27 June 1927 in Stamford Hill, London to parents of Italian origin: Riccardo Negri and Teresa Manattini. The family moved to Chingford in Essex where he was educated. He served in the Royal Navy as a radio engineer at the end of the Second World War and afterwards studied Art under David Bomberg at Borough Polytechnic (later to become part of South Bank University). In 1951 he attended the Old Vic Theatre School to study theatre design. The director of the school, Michel Saint Denis, was especially influential on Negri's thinking and development as a theatre designer as was the designer Margaret (Percy) Harris (of the renowned all female design group Motley), the design tutor at the school. Career After leaving the Old Vic he spent a year designing for the Oldham Coliseum before founding the Piccolo Theatre company with director Frank Dunlop (a contemporary at the Old Vic Theatre School) in Chorlton-cum- Hardy, Manchester (which only survived for a year) and designing the productions. In 1957, at the Royal Court 'Nekrassov' by Jean-Paul Sartre directed by George Devine with Robert Helpmann heading a distinguished cast including Ronald Barker, Roddy McMillan, James Villiers, Bernard Kay and Harry H. Corbett. He also designed Chekhov's 'Platonov' directed by George Devine and John Blatchley at the Royal Court in 1960 with Rex Harrison as well as James Bolam, Peter Bowles, Ronald Barker, Rachel Roberts and Graham Crowden. Also, Peter Shaffer's double bill 'The Private Eye' and 'The Public Ear' with Maggie Smith and Kenneth Williams at the Globe, in the West End directed by Peter Wood. Shakespeare's 'King Richard II' at London's Old Vic in 1959, directed by Val May with Maggie Smith as the Queen to John Justin's King Richard. George Baker, John Woodvine and Joss Ackland were also in the cast. 'Lady at the Wheel' a musical comedy directed by Wendy Toye in 1958, costumes by Motley and lighting by Richard Pilbrow with Bernard Cribbins at the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith. 'Masterpiece' in 1961, a play by Larry Ward and Gordon Russell, directed by Harry Kaplan, lighting by Richard Pilbrow at the Royalty Theatre. Anton Walbrook and Margaret Johnston headed a strong cast that included Peter Sallis, Patrick Magee, Robert Eddison and Arnold Marl√©. At the Bristol Old Vic he designed a production of Joseph O'Conor's early play, 'The Iron Harp'. With Peter O'Toole in the lead role (alongside O'Conor) the play also gave a first important role to Richard Harris. Negri also had a six-month spell as a television designer and his work at that time included designs for Ibsen's 'John Gabriel Borkman', which marked Laurence Olivier's television debut in the title role and 'Hay Fever' with Edith Evans and Maggie Smith, both directed by Casper Wrede. Also: 'The Living Room' with Dorothy Tutin, Ring Round The Moon' with Yvonne Arnaud, 'Touch of the Sun' with Michael Redgrave all directed by Lionel Harris. Working with director Peter Wood, Negri also designed 'Sunday out of Season' with Alec McCowan and Maggie Smith. In 1959 he started to design for the 59 Theatre Company, based at the Lyric Theatre. The company was run by Michael Elliott and Casper Wrede, a friend from the Old Vic and, although short-lived, the company achieved considerable success with productions of Brand (designed by Negri), Little Eyolf and Danton's Death. When Wrede and Elliott went on to run a season of plays at the Old Vic in 1961 Negri joined them as designer. In 1962 Negri began teaching as a part-time lecturer at Wimbledon School of Art in the Theatre Department teaching on the theatre design course; by the end of 1963 he had become Head of Department on Peter Bucknell's (former head of the Theatre Department) promotion to Principal. The formation of the 69 Theatre Company by Wrede, Elliott, and Braham Murray in Manchester led to Negri designing many of the productions at the University Theatre including Peer Gynt and The Tempest. Based upon the success of the Company the group started to look for a permanent theatre in Manchester and eventually a new theatre was built inside the disused Royal Exchange with Negri as the designer of the theatre and one of the founding artistic directors.The Royal Exchange Theatre Company Words & Pictures 1976‚Äì1998Braham Murray Autobiography The design incorporated the ideas of the founding group; Wrede, Elliott, Murray, the actor James Maxwell and Negri himself. According to Murray, Negri's design was based upon a beehive and meant that no one would be seated more than thirty feet from the stage. \\"The audience would be suspended between the world of the gods in the outer hall and the stage where the actors who entered from that world would act out their drama.\\" The architects, Levitt Bernstein Associates, observed \\"the beginning for us was a small paper and wire model sitting in the middle of a table with Richard Negri striding round it talking about the form of a rose. How, we wondered, would we ever bring this man down to earth? Fortunately we never did.\\" The theatre opened on 15 September 1976 and Negri remained as an artistic director until 1983. He directed a number of productions in addition to his design work. He had resigned from Wimbledon in 1974 to concentrate all his efforts on the Royal Exchange but returned in 1982 to continue his lecturing. He finally retired in 1988.

The publication of the ‚ÄòLives‚Äô involved Fell in such pecuniary difficulties that when he was required to give a statement of his accounts of the clergy property, for which he was the administrator in London, he was found to owe 12,72l pounds.

Background The Violin Sonata in A was written in 1886, when C√©sar Franck was 63, as a wedding present for the 28-year-old violinist Eug√®ne Ysa√øe. Twenty-eight years earlier, in 1858, Franck had promised a violin sonata for Cosima von B√ºlow. This never appeared; it has been speculated that whatever work Franck had done on that piece was put aside, and eventually ended up in the sonata he wrote for Ysa√øe in 1886. Franck was not present when Ysa√øe married, but on the morning of the wedding, on 26 September 1886 in Arlon, their mutual friend Charles Bordes presented the work as Franck's gift to Ysa√øe and his bride Louise Bourdeau de Courtrai. After a hurried rehearsal, Ysa√øe and Bordes' sister-in-law, the pianist Marie- L√©ontine Bordes-P√®ne, played the Sonata to the other wedding guests.Classical Archives The Sonata was given its first public concert performance on 16 December of that year,Colorado Public Radio at the Mus√©e Moderne de Peinture (Museum of Modern Painting) in Brussels.Jason Sundram's Web Palette Ysa√øe and Bordes-P√®ne were again the performers. The Sonata was the final item in a long program which started at 3pm. When the time arrived for the Sonata, dusk had fallen and the gallery was bathed in gloom, but the museum authorities permitted no artificial light whatsoever. Initially, it seemed the Sonata would have to be abandoned, but Ysa√øe and Bordes-P√®ne decided to continue regardless. They had to play the last three movements from memory in virtual darkness. When the violinist Armand Parent remarked that Ysa√øe had played the first movement faster than the composer intended, Franck replied that Ysa√øe had made the right decision, saying \\"from now on there will be no other way to play it\\". Vincent d'Indy, who was present, recorded these details of the event.Gramophone, February 1938 Ysa√øe kept the Violin Sonata in his repertoire for the next 40 years of his life, with a variety of pianists, like Th√©o Ysa√øe, Ernest Chausson, Ferruccio Busoni, Vincent d'Indy, Raoul Pugno, Camille Decreus, Arthur De Greef, Leopold Godowsky, Yves Nat, and many others. His championing of the Sonata contributed to the public recognition of Franck as a major composer. This recognition was quite belated; Franck died within four years of the Sonata's public premi√®re, and did not have his first unqualified public success until the last year of his life (on 19 April 1890, at the Salle Pleyel, where his String Quartet in D was premiered).Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 5th ed, 1954, ed. Eric Blom, Franck, C√©sar, vol. III, p. 467 The Sonata in A regularly appears on concert programs and on recordings, and is in the core repertoire of all major violinists. Jascha Heifetz played it at his final recital in 1972.Violinist.com The piece is further notable for the difficulty of its piano part, when compared with most of the chamber repertoire. Its technical problems include frequent extreme extended figures‚Äîthe composer himself having possessed huge hands‚Äîand virtuoso runs and leaps, particularly in the second movement (though some passages can be facilitated by employing a spare hand to cover some notes). Structure The work is cyclic in nature, all the movements sharing common thematic threads. Themes from one movement reappear in subsequent movements, but usually transformed. Franck had adapted this technique from Franz Liszt‚Äîhis friend, and Cosima von B√ºlow's father.Wolfgang David.com Vincent d'Indy described the Sonata as \\"the first and purest model of the cyclical use of themes in sonata form\\", and referred to it as \\"this true musical monument\\". The movements alternate between slow and fast. * I. Allegretto ben moderato,  This gentle and sweetly reflective rocking theme, introduced by the violin after a short introduction by the piano, is the thematic core of the entire work. Franck originally intended it as a slow movement, but Ysa√øe preferred a slightly quicker tempo, and convinced Franck to mark it Allegretto. * II. Allegro  This turbulent movement is sometimes considered the real opening movement, with the Allegretto ben moderato serving as a long introduction. * III. Ben moderato: Recitativo-Fantasia  This is improvisatory in nature, and free in both structure and expression. * IV. Allegretto poco mosso  The main melody is heard in canonic imitation between the instruments, and recurs in a rondo- like manner to a triumphant and soaring conclusion. James Harding described the movement as \\"a magnificent example of canonic writing, simple, majestic and irresistible in its ample, beautifully wrought proportions\\". Transcriptions The Violin Sonata in A exists in versions for cello; viola; double bass; flute; oboe; clarinet; alto saxophone; tuba; organ with choir; violin and strings; and violin and orchestra (recorded by Leonid Kogan). A version for piano duet by the pianist and composer Alfred Cortot has been recorded several times. Cortot also made a (for pianists even more challenging) version for solo piano, which has been played occasionally. The setting for cello and piano was the only alternative version sanctioned by Franck. This was created by the renowned cellist Jules Delsart. After thorough historical study based on reliable documents, Delsart's transcription for cello (the piano part remains the same as in the violin sonata) was published by G. Henle Verlag as an Urtext edition. Based on oral history (Pablo Casals) and written document (letter written by Antoine Ysaye, Eug√®ne Ysa√øe's son), it has often been speculated that the work was first conceived as a sonata for cello and piano, and only later reset for violin and piano when the commission from Eug√®ne Ysa√øe arrived.

Fell was a member of one of the numerous Lancashire families bearing his surname. The first mention of him is in 1656 as suffering much from the magistrates in Essex, and in the same year he went as a missionary to the West Indies, where he remained about a year. After his return to England he was engaged as a travelling preacher, and is referred to by his contemporaries as having been eloquent and successful. In 1659 he was seriously ill-treated by some soldiers near Westminster Hall, and in 1660 Richard Hubberthorne, the quaker, represented to Charles II that at Thetford, Norfolk, Fell had been hauled out of a meeting, and, after being whipped, turned out of the town, and passed as a vagabond from parish to parish to Lancashire. In a letter to Margaret Fell (Swarthmore MSS.) Fell states that he was imprisoned for some time at Thetford. He was in London during the rising of the Fifth-monarchy men in this year, and was knocked down by the soldiers as a rioter, and Fox (Journal, p. 314, ed. 1765) says he would have been killed but for the interposition of the Duke of York. In 1661 he was ‚Äòmoved,‚Äô in company with John Stubbs, to promulgate his views in ‚Äòforeign parts, especially to Prester John's country and China.‚Äô As no shipmasters would carry them, the quakers got a warrant from the king, which the East India Company found means to avoid. They then went to Holland, and, being unable to obtain shipping there, proceeded to Alexandria. The English consul banished them from the place as nuisances, and they were compelled to return to England. After spending some time in religious journeys, he again visited the West Indies, and a letter in the Shackleton collection states that in 1672 he was living in Barbados, that he was married, in debt, and much depressed. Nothing more is known of his life. Fell was a man of highly devotional spirit, and full of benevolence and courage. His few and brief writings show him to have received an education above the average; their style is good, and the language well chosen.

Early life and education The details of Azoury's birth are uncertain. According to one source, Azoury was born around 1873 in the village of Azour. He studied in Paris at l‚ÄôEcole des sciences politiques and later studied at the Ottoman civil service school in Constantinople. In 1898, Azoury began administration work in Jerusalem, serving as an Ottoman official for several years. Activities after Jerusalem In May 1904, following a conflict with his brother-in-law and Jerusalem's Mutasarrif Kazim Bey, Azoury went to Cairo and condemned the mutasarrif in the newspaper al-Ikhlas. Azoury moved to Paris and allegedly founded the ‚ÄúLigue de la Patrie arabe‚Äù; as of December 1904 and January 1905, this organization included only Azoury and another person. Later, Azoury was sentenced to death ‚Äúin absentia‚Ä¶‚Äôfor having left his post without permission and having proceeded to Paris where he [had] devoted himself to acts compromising the existence of the [Ottoman] Empire.‚Äô‚Äù In December 1904 and January 1905, Azoury‚Äôs Ligue released two manifestos, both titled ‚ÄúThe Arab Countries for the Arabs‚Äù and published in Arabic and French. The Ligue directed its first manifesto to ‚ÄúAll the Citizens of the Arab Homeland Subjected to the Turks‚Äù; the second manifesto addressed the ‚ÄúEnlightened and Humanitarian Nations of Europe and North America.‚Äù These manifestos preceded Azoury's most well-known text, Le r√©veil de la nation arabe. Le r√©veil de la nation arabe In January 1905, soon after the Ligue issued its manifestos, Azoury published Le r√©veil de la nation arabe dans l‚ÄôAsie turque‚Äîor, more commonly, Le r√©veil de la nation arabe (The Awakening of the Arab Nation). Le r√©veil de la nation arabe, Azoury's most significant work, has been termed ‚Äúa minor classic in Arab nationalist literature.‚Äù =Key ideas and influences= Le r√©veil included a comprehensive discussion of the relationships between the Ottoman Empire and the world powers. Most significantly, Azoury openly urged the Arab provinces to sever their ties with the Ottoman Empire. In addition to the text's nationalistic nature, Le r√©veil exhibited anti-Zionist sentiment and decried Zionist aspirations in Palestine. Azoury envisaged ‚Äúthat Zionist and Arab nationalist aspirations were likely to come seriously into conflict,‚Äù writing that \\"two important phenomena are emerging at this moment in Asiatic Turkey. They are the awakening of the Arab Nation and the latent effort by Jews to reconstitute on a very large scale the ancient Kingdom of Israel... They are destined to fight each other continually until one of them wins.\\"Middle East Perspectives: Personal Recollections (1947 - 1967). A Mardelli Bassil. P. 354 He also criticized what he viewed as French anti- clerical actions in Jerusalem and Lebanon. Some assert that the text was likely heavily influenced by Azoury's career in the service of the Ottoman Empire. Azoury had firsthand experience of corrupt administrators as well as the flawed system that could not stem the arrival of Jewish immigrants or their acquisition of land. =Reception and criticism= Azoury largely wrote Le r√©veil for French readers; in fact, the book was written in French. The book apparently was not initially influential among Arabs, but it did spark dialogue in Europe and especially in France. European officials considered Le r√©veil an important text for gaining insight to the region, and the book is credited with encouraging European aspirations regarding the Ottoman Empire by ‚Äú[claiming] that the Arab provinces were ripe for revolt, and that a movement already existed that needed only the assent of Europe to bring about the final confrontation.‚Äù Yet, Azoury admitted later ‚Äúthat the book sought not to describe Arab discontent so much as to create it.‚Äù The work is criticized as being a falsely nationalistic text, intended to pander to Europe rather than to rouse Arab nationalistic sentiment. One year after Le r√©veil‚Äôs publication, Farid Kassab‚Äîan Arab from Beirut who was attending school in Paris‚Äîcriticized Azoury‚Äôs work, writing a pamphlet that supported the Ottoman Empire and Jewish settlement in Palestine while rejecting Azoury‚Äôs idea of an Arab nation. Later life In April 1907, while still in Paris, Azoury published the first monthly issue of l‚ÄôIndependence arabe. In order to secure funding for the publication, Azoury offered to place his knowledge of North Africa, the various pan-Islamic committees, and the regional political ‚Äúweb‚Äù at the service of France. Azoury was investigated at this point by uneasy French authorities, but he was largely dismissed as posing no danger. During their investigation, French authorities found no definitive evidence supporting the existence of Azoury's Ligue de la patrie arabe‚Äîfor which, along with a similarly dubious Arab national committee, Azoury claimed to speak.

Normally a warrant officer class 2 in the British Army, selection for this post was the culmination of many years of experience with modern radio communications systems. During their careers it was possible to be trained in several evolving systems for example the movement from Larkspur and Clansman to the more recent Bowman radio communication equipment. Their duties included training personnel by the development and execution of in-house and in-theatre courses, keeping their signal sergeants up-to-date with amendments to policies and equipment, equipment husbandry, equipment procurement and high level custodian protection of electronic and paper codes. They had to produce communications electronic instructions containing relevant daily frequencies and associated information for radio operators. Generally the SMS would be housed in the regimental training wing and was given numerous other roles to fulfil by the unit training officer. The SMS normally had a secondary roll as a troop sergeant major. A sergeant major signals wore a warrant officer's crown on his sleeve. A typical career ladder would be: basic training followed by a basic radio communicators course of approximately 3 weeks duration. Progress to an advanced level of about 4 ‚Äì 6 weeks duration followed after roughly 3 or more years field experience. The soldier would also have to attend a junior cadre course, which built on basic soldiering skills and was a necessary step for selection for their first promotion. As they were competing for their second promotion the soldier would be selected to attend an assistant regimental instructor's course of approximately 6‚Äì8 weeks duration. This would supply individual companies (or similar sub-units) with experienced training staff. The assistant regimental instructor's course was a pre-requisite to selection for their third promotion to the signal sergeant's post but not as a pre- requisite for promotion to sergeant which was justified by the completion of the Education for Promotion Certificate. They would also have to attend the crew commander's course which was a more thorough cadre and be selected for further promotion by selection from other competing corporals (or equivalent). This was based on a scoring system derived from the confidential report forms that were annually completed since promotion to corporal. Once a sergeant was employed as a signals sergeant for approximately 4 years he/she could gain further promotion by selection from other competing signal sergeants. This was based on a scoring system derived from the confidential report forms that were annually completed since promotion to sergeant. They would also have to pass the Education for Promotion Certificate Level 2. Promotion to the role of SMS could be while still as a sergeant awaiting further promotion (but having been informed of that promotion). This may have been because of an inhibiting factor such as an outgoing SMS still in his post but awaiting to be posted elsewhere. In most cases where this happened the sergeant could be given a local (unpaid) promotion. Once the outgoing SMS had left the sergeant would be promoted to either staff sergeant or warrant officer. Providing a SMS gave a good account of his duties and he was a staff sergeant, his subsequent promotion to warrant officer class II would generally follow at the next promotions board. A SMS could then be selected for further promotions to company sergeant major, battery sergeant major, regimental quartermaster sergeant, regimental sergeant major or regimental sergeant major instructor.

In 2010 media described his \\"Pencil Vs Camera\\" art. He is an accomplished illustrator and photographer, He is also the creator of other original art series such as \\"Digital Circlism\\" and \\"Flesh and Acrylic\\".{[cn}} He was born in 1983 in Ivory Coast and currently lives and works in Belgium. Ben has a degree in Journalism and is a self-taught person in drawing, photography and music. His creations have been featured in newspapers, magazines and major publications worldwide and since 2010 his works have begun to populate art galleries and museums in Europe, Asia and Russia. Heine permanently stopped doing political art in 2009. A documentary about his work was released in 2012. Heine started producing and composing music in 2012 and plays drums and the piano. He owns a music studio since 2013. His first music album \\"Sound Spiral\\" was released in November 2015. Early life and education  Ben was born in 1983 in Abidjan, Ivory Coast. where he spent the first seven years of his life, with his parents and three sisters. His family relocated in Brussels, Belgium, in 1990. His father was a commercial engineer and his mother a choreographer and a dance teacher. Heine started drawing at 11 years of age. At that time, his curiosity for visual art was his keenest interest. Between 1988 and 2006, Heine undertook studies in different countries, including Ivory Coast, Belgium, the UK and the Netherlands. He attended primary school at Notre Dame de La Trinit√© in Brussels. As a student, Heine easily became frustrated and bored, often becoming difficult to manage in school. It wasn't until he attended secondary education at \\"Coll√®ge Saint Vincent\\" in Belgium that he evolved into a more disciplined student. As a teenager, he explored drawing, painting and writing poetry to music and athletics. In 2007, Ben earned a degree in Journalism, started at Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles and completed at IHECS and Utrecht University of Applied Sciences. Ben also conducted studies in Art History, Sculpture, and Painting at Hastings College of Arts and Technology and at the Acad√©mie Royale des Beaux Arts de Bruxelles. Throughout his academic training, he learned music instruments including drums, djembe and piano. His studies and love for communication lead him to learn six different languages, French, English, Dutch, Polish, Spanish and Russian. Between 2007 until the end of 2009, Heine worked in different fields to make a living, as a copywriter in a communication agency in Belgium and later as a language teacher and coach in different schools around Brussels. He also worked as a cashier in a supermarket. Despite these jobs, Ben's priority always remained in his creative projects and he was drawing and painting every night. 2010 was an important year for Heine, when he started working on the artworks of his major series, Pencil Vs Camera and Digital Circlism. From 2010 until today, Heine exhibited his artworks in major art fairs, museums and art galleries around the world. Since 2011, he also continued to develop his musical style.  Art  = Pencil vs camera = Ben Heine at Brussels Accessible Art Fair The artworks in this series usually show a hand-drawn 2D sketch held and photographed by the artist in a specific location. They combine photography and drawing to infuse ordinary scenes with new surreal, visionary, or romanticized narratives. The inclusion of hand-held penciled sketches over a portion of the original photos allows Heine to enhance reality and open doors to an imaginary world. Heine brought some innovations to the concept in 2012 adding colors and black paper. Between 2010 and 2016, Heine's creations have been seen by the people through the exhibitions and news articles in major media outlets. Heine's first Pencil Vs Camera's images quickly gained popularity online and received positive criticisms from specialized and influential art sites along with news reports and international opportunities for the artist. Some of primary and secondary public schools that are teaching Heine's Pencil Vs Camera concept are \\"International School of Beijing\\", \\"ColegioMenor in Quito\\", \\"Dover College\\", \\"Ecole Lamartine\\", \\"Ecole de Scorb√©- Clairvaux\\", \\"Ecole Renaudeau\\", \\"Coll√®ge La Bruy√®re Sainte Isabelle\\" and others. Since 2012, many other creators and artists have borrowed from Heine's innovations to create various forms of similar 3D artworks. =Flesh and Acrylic= Flesh and Acrylic live performance at Brussels Natural Science Museum This series started in 2011, Heine creates abstract acrylic paintings on large wooden panels. In the finished work it is at first difficult to tell where the human figure ends and the background \\"canvas\\" begins, both blending together into one surreal abstract vision. He takes pictures of the final composition so that they can be printed and exhibited later on. Heine made his first \\"Flesh and Acrylic\\" project with model Caroline Madison in 2011 for a documentary filmed by Italian director Davide Gentile. Between 2012 and 2015, Heine made several Flesh and Acrylic live performances. = Digital circlism = Ben Heine during an exhibition of Digital circlism This is the name Heine has given to a whole new creative technique he has developed in 2010. It is a mix between Pop Art and Pointillism. In this project, Heine usually makes portraits of celebrities/cultural icons with digital tools using flat circles on a black background. Each circle has a single color and a single tone. Trends Hunter said about Digital Circlism: \\"Through the use of graphic software and a whole lot of creativity, Ben Heine is able to create iconic faces from history and pop culture by drawing circles of various sizes and colors. In order to give them a dynamic and 3-dimensional appearance\\". The artist stated he has been making portraits for over 15 years but it wasn't very long ago that he started developing this original technique. \\"As I've been working with digital tools recently, this came quite naturally, and I'm a big fan of Pop Art and Pointillism. Digital Circlism is a modern mix of them\\". = Influences = Heine says he is influenced by Belgian Surrealism, German Expressionism, American Pop Art, and Social Realism. Abduzeezo says about Heine: \\"His galleries are filled with great stuff and he can walk beautifully between several art directions, creating amazing pieces in any way he goes\\". = Political works = Traditionally trained in journalism and communications at IHECS Journalism School, Heine tried his hand at political cartoons because he wanted to connect his interest in art with his studies in Journalism. This brief encounter was far less charitable to him than he had hoped. His political activism, at the cusp of his youth, unleashed a string of criticism and threats. In the end, Heine felt it was perhaps wiser to walk away from political cartoons in 2009. At IHECS, international politics professor Paul Delmotte gave Heine pro-Palestinian information throughout his studies. In 2006, at the end of his scholarship and just after the Muhammad cartoon contest controversy, Heine made a master's final assignment, which included a detailed investigation about the \\"Limits of Freedom of Expression in Political Cartooning\\". At that time, Heine was also member of many cartoonists and activists associations. These organizations and particularly \\"Iran Cartoon\\" requested that he participates in a competition calling for provocative Holocaust-related images sponsored by the Iranian newspaper Hamshahri as an answer to the Muhammad cartoon contest. Heine's participation in this contest lead to controversy. Due to the pro-Palestinian nature of several of his older political art, he received some criticisms for his views on the Middle Eastern political situation and specifically for some images about Israel and Zionism. Because of this, Heine decided to completely stop creating political cartoons in 2009 and to focus on his own art. He also asked all websites that published his political images to permanently remove them because he said these drawings lacked nuance and intelligence and they kept generating confusion about his evolution as a non-political artist. He also said he made such mistakes because he was too young and didn't have objective information. Heine wrote an open letter in 2010 to beg pardon to the Jewish Community, to express his regrets and apologize for the mess and pain this event had generated. He made clear he was against revisionism, anti-Semitism and xenophobia. He also explained the academic context in which he was, how cartoon organizations had manipulated his drawings, how he lost control of the situation and how much this issue had caused him troubles. Since 2009, Heine has firmly distanced himself from all activists‚Äô organizations. Music Heine started creating electronic music, writing songs, singing and composing in 2011. He bought a professional creative studio in Belgium since 2012. In 2013, Heine's music track \\"Fly With You\\" was added in the collective album \\"Mesh 1.0\\" released by DMS in the UK. From 2013 to 2014, he worked on improving his knowledge in music theory and piano practice. In 2014, Heine started to collaborate with other musicians and singers including pianist Thibault Crols and Saxophonist St√©phane Pigeon. In 2015, Heine music was played publicly for the first time at Moscow Planetarium, at the National Museum of Arkhangelsk and in 2016 at Tyumen Fine Art Museum in the frame of his itinerant solo exhibition in Russia. Ben Heine's first album \\"Sound Spiral\\" was released in 2015. In March 2016, his music tracks \\"Warsaw\\", \\"I'm a Clown\\", \\"Amour\\" and \\"It's Just a Play\\" were selected by \\"Wix Music\\" and played at the SXSW music festival.

He is a brown-and-white tabby, believed to have been born in January 2007. By July 2016, when Theresa May became prime minister, he had developed a reputation of being \\"violent\\" in his interactions with other local mousers, especially the Foreign Office's much younger cat Palmerston. Early life Larry at the door of 10 Downing Street, his official residence and workplace Larry is a rescued stray cat from the Battersea Dogs and Cats Home who was chosen by Downing Street staff.Glen Oglaza \\"The Cat's Whiskers\\" , Sky News, 15 February 2011. Larry was intended to be a pet for the children of David and Samantha Cameron, and was described by Downing Street sources as a \\"good ratter\\" and as having \\"a high chase-drive and hunting instinct\\". In 2012, Battersea Dogs and Cats Home revealed that Larry's popularity had resulted in a surge of 15% more people adopting cats. Soon after he was taken in at Downing Street, a story ran in the press claiming that Larry was a lost cat and that the original owner had started a campaign to retrieve him. However, the story was later revealed to be a hoax, and no such owner nor campaign existed. Career =Official duties= The Downing Street website describes Larry's duties as \\"greeting guests to the house, inspecting security defences, and testing antique furniture for napping quality\\". It says he is \\"contemplating a solution to the mouse occupancy of the house\\" and has told Downing Street that such a solution is still in the \\"tactical planning stage\\". Unlike his predecessors since 1929, Larry's upkeep is funded by the staff of 10 Downing Street. Fund-raising events to pay for his food are believed to have included a quiz night for Downing Street staff held in the state rooms. =Work as Chief Mouser= He made his first known kill ‚Äì a mouse ‚Äì on 22 April 2011. On 28 August 2012, Larry made his first public killing, dropping his prey on the lawn in front of Number 10. In October 2013, Larry caught four mice in two weeks and one staff member rescued a mouse from his clutches. In July 2015, George Osborne and Cabinet Office Minister Matt Hancock cornered a mouse in the Chancellor of the Exchequer's office, trapping it in a brown paper sandwich bag. The press joked that the Chancellor of the Exchequer might take over the Chief Mouser position. David Cameron explained during his final Prime Minister's Questions in 2016 that Larry is a civil servant and not personal property, so would not leave Downing Street after a change of premier. The Labour Party has confirmed that in the event of a Labour government, Larry would remain as Chief Mouser. As of January 2020, Larry has retained his position with the Boris Johnson administration. =Territorial changes= Larry (left) lies on the window of 10 Downing Street, during the visit of U.S. President Donald Trump In 2011, Larry was banned from the Prime Minister's quarters in 10 Downing Street as his fur was ruining the Prime Minister's fresh suits. Former Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg has described an internal Downing Street security door which requires microphone contact for access as being increasingly \\"not for security, but to keep the cats out from one end of the building to another\\". In February 2013, a cat-proof barrier was erected to prevent Larry and his neighbour Freya from getting into the Foreign Office, after complaints from staff members with allergies. Foreign Secretary, William Hague later asked that the barrier be taken down. In December 2015, former Home Secretary, David Blunkett suggested that Larry should be asked to increase his responsibilities to include the Palace of Westminster, which at the time was being overrun by rodents. Relationships with politicians Larry with Prime Minister David Cameron and U.S. President Barack Obama David Cameron has said that Larry is a \\"bit nervous\\" around men, speculating that, since Larry was a rescue cat, this may be due to negative experiences in his past. Cameron mentioned that Barack Obama is an apparent exception to this fear: he said, \\"Funnily enough he liked Obama. Obama gave him a stroke and he was all right with Obama.\\" In September 2013, tensions were reportedly growing between Cameron and Larry. It was reported that Cameron objected to cat hair on his suit, and the smell of cat food had to be disguised by air freshener when Downing Street had visitors. The Camerons were said not to like Larry, amid suggestions that the pet was a public relations prop. Cameron posted to Twitter saying that he and Larry got on \\"purr-fectly well\\". Nevertheless, bookmakers Ladbrokes made Cameron the odds-on (1/2) favourite to leave Downing Street first, with Larry as the 6/4 outsider. The Daily Telegraph suggested that Cameron never really liked cats but that spin doctors believed Larry could make the PM appear more friendly. When leaving office in 2016, Cameron spoke of his \\"sadness\\" that he could not take Larry with him. When Theresa May became Prime Minister in 2016, there were concerns that Larry was stressed and could be missing the Cameron family. In August 2016, Sir Alistair Graham, former chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, responded to controversy over favouritism in Cameron's Dissolution Honours List by joking that he was \\"surprised Larry the cat didn't get one\\". In June 2019, in what was described in the press as a photobombing, Larry was visible on the window ledge outside Number 10 as Theresa May and her husband Philip May posed with U.S. President Donald Trump and his wife Melania Trump at the start of Trump's state visit to the United Kingdom; he later sheltered from the rain under Trump's armoured Cadillac and could not be coaxed out, leading Jon Sopel of the BBC to tweet: \\"BREAKING: anti-Trump demonstrators fail to stop @realDonaldTrump motorcade, but @Number10cat does\\". Relationships with other animals In June 2012, Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne was reunited with his long lost cat Freya, who moved into 11 Downing Street. Freya and Larry were reported to have rapidly established cordial relations, although the two cats had been seen fighting. Freya was reported to be the more dominant cat and more effective mouser, reportedly because her days as a stray had \\"hardened\\" her. In November 2014, Freya left Downing Street, leaving Larry with the sole mousing responsibility. In 2014, Osborne brought in a pet dog, Lola. Aides announced that Lola got on well with both Larry and Freya. In April 2016, a new feline neighbour, Palmerston, moved into the Foreign Office. Although known for getting along from time to time, the two cats have fought on numerous occasions. The Leader of the House commented that he hoped that Palmerston and Larry would establish a \\"modus vivendi\\". In July of that year, Palmerston entered Number 10 and had to be forcibly evicted by security staff. In September 2016, Lord Blencathra submitted a question in the House of Lords of why the government did not pay for Larry's veterinary bill for an injury picked up in a fight against Palmerston, and whether the government would refund civil servants who paid for Larry's care. Baroness Chisholm of Owlpen, the government‚Äôs spokesman in the Lords, said: \\"The costs were met by staff through voluntary staff donations due to their affection for Larry.\\" On 1 August 2016, according to the political photographer Steve Beck, Larry had his \\"most brutal fight yet\\" with Palmerston on the steps of Number 10. During the fight Larry lost his collar, whilst Palmerston suffered from several deep scratches and a badly cut ear. In August 2016, it emerged the Cabinet Office were considering also appointing another Chief Mouser to deal with their mouse problem. The Chief Whip, Gavin Williamson, said that the cat would be called Cromwell. In September 2019, a new dog, Dilyn, came to stay at Downing Street. Battersea Dogs & Cats Home offered to negotiate a deal with Larry. Criticism Larry has been criticized for both his temperament and job performance. Within a month of his arrival at Downing Street, anonymous sources described Larry as having \\"a distinct lack of killer instinct.\\" Later that year, it was revealed that Larry spent more time sleeping than hunting for mice, and shared the company of a female cat, Maisie. At one point in 2011, mice were so endemic in Downing Street that the Prime Minister resorted to throwing a fork at one during a Cabinet dinner. Larry was almost fired from his position in 2012 when he failed to react to a mouse spotted in David Cameron's study. His lack of killer instinct also earned him the nickname \\"Lazy Larry\\" by the tabloid press. In September 2012, Freya was appointed to share the role of Chief Mouser to the Cabinet Office. Awards and recognition Larry was honoured with a blue plaque at Battersea Dogs and Cats Home in October 2012.  In popular culture  A book, written in character as Larry, Larry Diaries: Downing Street ‚Äì the First 100 Days by former Guardian journalist James Robinson was published in 2011. A picture gallery to celebrate Larry's first two years in office was produced by The Daily Telegraph. In 2012, Larry was visible on the Google Street View of Number 10, asleep next to the door. Larry's exploits and observations on life at Number 10 became the subject of a weekly cartoon in The Sunday Express drawn by cartoonist Ted Harrison.

Malda district was formed in 1813 with \\"some portion of outlying areas of Purnia, Dinajpur and Rajshahi districts\\". A separate treasury was established in 1832 and a full-fledged Magistrate and Collector was posted in 1859. Malda district was part of Rajshahi Division till 1876, when it was transferred to Bhagalpur Division, and again transferred in 1905 to Rajshahi Division. With the partition of Bengal in 1947, the Radcliffe Line placed Malda district in India, except the Nawabganj subdivision, which was placed in East Pakistan.

Old Malda and Gazole CD Blocks form the Mahananda-Tangon interfluves area. Barind soils permit little percolation and most of the monsoon runoff accumulates in the large natural bils (ponds) in the ravines formed by the courses of the Tangon and Punarbhaba rivers, covering the lowlands. Old Malda CD Block is bounded by Gazole CD Block in the north, Habibpur CD Block in the east, Bholahat Upazila of Chapai Nawabganj District, Bangladesh, on the south, and English Bazar CD Block and Ratua II CD Block on the west.Google maps Old Malda CD Block has an area of 228.00 km2.

The decadal growth rate for West Bengal in 2001-11 was 13.93%. The decadal growth rate for West Bengal was 13.93 in 2001-2011, 17.77% in 1991-2001. 24.73% in 1981-1991 and 23.17% in 1971-1981. Malda district has the second highest decadal population growth rate, for the decade 2001-2011, in West Bengal with a figure of 21.2% which is much higher than the state average (13.8%). Uttar Dinajpur district has the highest decadal growth rate in the state with 23.2%.

The Barind tract was opened for refugee resettlement in the aftermath of the partition. Population density in the district has intensified from 162 persons per km2 in 1901 to 881 in 2001 (i.e., around five times), which is highest amongst the districts of North Bengal. However, unlike the densely populated southern regions of West Bengal, urbanisation remains low in Malda district. North Bengal in general, and Malda in particular, has been witness to large scale population movement from other states in India and other districts of West Bengal, as well as from outside the country. The District Human Development Report for Malda notes, \\"Malda district has been a principal recipient of the human migration waves of the 20th century.\\" There are reports of Bangladeshi infiltrators coming through the international border. Only a small portion of the border with Bangladesh has been fenced and it is popularly referred to as a porous border. =Literacy= As per the 2011 census, the total number of literates in Old Malda CD Block was 80,614 (59.61% of the population over 6 years) out of which males numbered 45,278 (65.35% of the male population over 6 years) and females numbered 35,336 (53.66% of the female population over 6 years).

Information about mother-tongue is available only at the district level and above. There is a discrepancy in the data for religion in Malda district. According to Table C1: Population by religious community in 2011, Malda district was a Muslim-majority district in 2011, but it did not present any progressive picture from earlier years. The 2011 District Census Handbook: Maldah presents a different progressive picture, which we are presenting below. Incidentally, both are part of the official census operations. According to the 2011 District Census Handbook: Maldah, during 2011 census, majority of the population of the district were Hindus constituting 51.3% of the population and up from 49.3% in 2001, followed by Muslims with 48.0%, down from 49.7% in 2001. The proportion of the Hindu population of the district had a decreasing trend from 56.7% in 1971 to 49.3% in 2001 then the trend took a reverse turn and increased in 2011. On the other hand, the Muslim population has increased from 46.2% in 1961 to 49.7% in 2001 but in 2011 census it shrunk to 48.0%. Only 0.3% population were Christians. As per 2014 District Statistical Handbook: Malda (quoting census figures), in the 2001 census, Hindus numbered 93,521 and formed 71.25% of the population in Old Malda CD Block. Muslims numbered 34,605 and formed 26.36% of the population. Christians numbered 801 and formed 0.61% of the population. Others numbered 2,838 and formed 1.78% of the population. The Census Commission published another set of data for 2011 census with basic fundamental differences. Those who are interested may view the reference. We are not sure which one is right. It is up to the Census Commission to clarify. Rural poverty As per the Human Development Report for Malda district, published in 2006, the percentage of rural families in BPL category in Old Malda CD Block was 39.2%. Official surveys have found households living in absolute poverty in Malda district to be around 39%. According to the report, \\"An overwhelmingly large segment of the rural workforce depends on agriculture as its main source of livelihood, the extent of landlessness in Malda has traditionally been high because of the high densities of human settlement in the district‚Ä¶ Although land reforms were implemented in Malda district from the time they were launched in other parts of West Bengal, their progress has been uneven across the Malda blocks‚Ä¶ because of the overall paucity of land, the extent of ceiling-surplus land available for redistribution has never been large‚Ä¶ The high levels of rural poverty that exist in nearly all blocks in Malda district closely reflect the livelihood crisis‚Ä¶ \\" Economy =Livelihood= In Old Malda CD Block in 2011, amongst the class of total workers, cultivators numbered 10,182 and formed 19.46%, agricultural labourers numbered 23,991 and formed 38.01%, household industry workers numbered 2,473 and formed 3.92% and other workers numbered 24,379 and formed 38.62%.

The decadal growth of population in English Bazar PS covering English Bazar CD Block in 1991-2001 was 25.38%. The decadal growth of population in English Bazar PS in 1981-91 was 33.48% and in 1971-81 was 30.85%. The decadal growth rate of population in Malda district was as follows: 30.33% in 1951-61, 31.98% in 1961-71, 26.00% in 1971-81, 29.78% in 1981-91, 24.78% in 1991-2001 and 21.22% in 2001-11. The decadal growth rate for West Bengal in 2001-11 was 13.93%. The decadal growth rate for West Bengal was 13.93 in 2001-2011, 17.77% in 1991-2001. 24.73% in 1981-1991 and 23.17% in 1971-1981. Malda district has the second highest decadal population growth rate, for the decade 2001-2011, in West Bengal with a figure of 21.2% which is much higher than the state average (13.8%). Uttar Dinajpur district has the highest decadal growth rate in the state with 23.2%. Decadal growth rate of population is higher than that of neighbouring Murshidabad district, which has the next highest growth rate. Population density in the district has intensified from 162 persons per km2 in 1901 to 881 in 2001 (i.e., around five times), which is highest amongst the districts of North Bengal. However, unlike the densely populated southern regions of West Bengal, urbanisation remains low in Malda district. North Bengal in general, and Malda in particular, has been witness to large scale population movement from other states in India and other districts of West Bengal, as well as from outside the country. The District Human Development Report for Malda notes, \\"Malda district has been a principal recipient of the human migration waves of the 20th century.\\" The decadal growth rate of population in neighbouring Chapai Nawabganj District in Bangladesh was 15.59% for the decade 2001-2011, down from 21.67% in the decade 1991-2001. There are reports of Bangladeshi infiltrators coming through the international border. Only a small portion of the border with Bangladesh has been fenced and it is popularly referred to as a porous border. =Literacy= As per the 2011 census, the total number of literates in English Bazar CD Block was 148,061 (63.03% of the population over 6 years) out of which males numbered 80,848 (66.96% of the male population over 6 years) and females numbered 67,213 (58.88% of the female population over 6 years). The gender disparity (the difference between female and male literacy rates) was 8.08%. See also ‚Äì List of West Bengal districts ranked by literacy rate =Language and religion= In 2001, Bengali was the mother tongue of 88.1% of the population of Malda district followed by Santali (4.5%) Khortha/Khotta (4.4%), Hindi (1.2%), Bhojpuri (0.4%), Telugu (0.3%), Kurukh/ Oraon (0.2%) and Koda/ Kora (0.1%). While the percentage of population reporting Bengali as a mother tongue has increased from 83.6 in 1961 Census to 88.1 in 2001 Census, the percentage of population reporting Santali as mother tongue has decreased from 7.2 in 1961 Census to 4.5 in 2001 Census. Information about mother-tongue is available only at the district level and above. There is a discrepancy in the data for religion in Malda district. According to Table C1: Population by religious community in 2011, Malda district was a Muslim-majority district in 2011, but it did not present any progressive picture from earlier years. The 2011 District Census Handbook: Maldah presents a different progressive picture, which we are presenting below. Incidentally, both are part of the official census operations. According to the 2011 District Census Handbook: Maldah, during 2011 census, majority of the population of the district were Hindus constituting 51.3% of the population and up from 49.3% in 2001, followed by Muslims with 48.0%, down from 49.7% in 2001. The proportion of the Hindu population of the district had a decreasing trend from 56.7% in 1971 to 49.3% in 2001 then the trend took a reverse turn and increased in 2011. On the other hand, the Muslim population has increased from 46.2% in 1961 to 49.7% in 2001 but in 2011 census it shrunk to 48.0%. Only 0.3% population were Christians. As per 2014 District Statistical Handbook: Malda (quoting census figures), in the 2001 census, Hindus numbered 114,101 and formed 50.43% of the population in English Bazar CD Block. Muslims numbered 112,029 and formed 49.53% of the population. Christians numbered 52 and formed 0.02% of the population. Others numbered 54 and formed 0.02% of the population. The Census Commission published another set of data for 2011 census with basic fundamental differences. Those who are interested may view the reference. We are not sure which one is right. It is up to the Census Commission to clarify. Rural poverty As per the Human Development Report for Malda district, published in 2006, the percentage of rural families in BPL category in English Bazar CD Block was 40.0%. Official surveys have found households living in absolute poverty in Malda district to be around 39%. According to the report, \\"An overwhelmingly large segment of the rural workforce depends on agriculture as its main source of livelihood, the extent of landlessness in Malda has traditionally been high because of the high densities of human settlement in the district‚Ä¶ Although land reforms were implemented in Malda district from the time they were launched in other parts of West Bengal, their progress has been uneven across the Malda blocks‚Ä¶ because of the overall paucity of land, the extent of ceiling-surplus land available for redistribution has never been large‚Ä¶ The high levels of rural poverty that exist in nearly all blocks in Malda district closely reflect the livelihood crisis‚Ä¶ \\" Economy =Livelihood= In English Bazar CD Block in 2011, amongst the class of total workers, cultivators numbered 7,635 and formed 7.73%, agricultural labourers numbered 23,502 and formed 23.80%, household industry workers numbered 12,311 and formed 12.47% and other workers numbered 55,296 and formed 56.00%.

Although written in 1922 it was not produced until 24 August 1926, when it was premiered at the St Martin's Theatre. The play is Coward's only venture into Ruritanian romance. It was well received, and ran for 136 performances. The play has not been revived in the West End. Background and first production In 1922 Coward was a rising playwright, but he had yet to become famous.Hoare, Philip. \\"Coward, Sir No√´l Peirce, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004. Retrieved 7 April 2019 He wrote The Queen Was in the Parlour in the spring of 1922 while staying in St Mary in the Marsh in Kent, and between its creation and its first production, four years later, it was given the title Nadya, and later Souvenir before the final title was adopted.Coward, p. 141; and Mander and Mitchenson, p. 71 By 1926 The Vortex (1924) and Hay Fever (1925) had made Coward's name, and the producer Basil Dean staged The Queen Was in the Parlour, directing it himself.Mander and Mitchenson, p. 71 The play opened at the St Martin's Theatre on 14 August 1926,\\"St. Martin's Theatre\\", The Times, 25 August 1926, p. 8 and transferred to the Duke of York's Theatre on 4 October, running in total for 136 performances.Mander and Mitchenson, p. 65 Original castNadya ‚Äì Madge Titheradge *Sabien Pastal ‚Äì Francis Lister *Zana ‚Äì Freda Godfrey *General Krish ‚Äì C.

Disney Roebuck *Prince Keri of Zalgar ‚Äì Herbert Marshall *Grand Duchess Emilie ‚ÄìLady Tree Synopsis =Act I= Scene 1: Nadya's flat in Paris. 5.00 a.m. Nadya, the young widow of Archduke Alexander of Krayia, enters with her fianc√©, Sabien. They are both tired of partying and agree to get married and settle down. Standing in the early sunlight they drink champagne to their future happiness, but as they do so the sun goes behind a cloud. Scene 2: The same. A few hours later. After Sabien has gone home, General Krish arrives from Krayia with the news that the king has been assassinated and that Nadya, being next in succession, must return to Krayia as its queen. Nadya is horrified, but the general convinces her that it is her duty, as the country is dangerously unstable, with revolution in the air, and her presence may calm matters. She sadly writes Sabien a farewell letter. =Act II= The private apartments of the queen. One year later, in the afternoon. Nadya is to marry Prince Keri of Zalgar. A shot is heard: someone has tried to shoot Nadya as she arrives in her carriage, but the assassin's aim was deflected by a man in the crowd. Nadya and Keri meet for the first time, and amicably agree that the interests of state oblige them to marry, although each has had to give up a true love to do so. The shrewd old Grand Duchess Emilie, who has seen off three husbands, arrives for tea with the royal couple and General Krish, and quickly sees how matters rest. At Krish's suggestion Nadya grants a private audience to the man in the crowd who saved her life. It turns out to be Sabien. He tells her that he cannot bear to see her marry another man, and will shoot himself. He pleads with her to spend one final night with him, to which after a show of reluctance, she agrees. =Act III= Scene 1: The same as Act II. In the evening.  Sabien arrives and is concealed in an adjoining room by Nadya's loyal maid, Zana. Keri and Nadya enter and talk, agreeing that they will be friends \\"come weal, come woe\\". After he leaves, Nadya and Sabien dine together, Scene 2: The same. A few hours later It is four in the morning. Krish and Keri are in the queen's ante-room, keeping watch for civil unrest and insurrection. As a dangerous crowd gathers outside the palace, Nadya enters from the bedroom. She goes on the balcony and tells the mob to shoot her if they have the courage. Keri joins her and suggests that the crowd would be better off at home in bed, which makes them laugh and defuses the situation. After the crowd has dispersed, Nadya turns to Keri and begs his forgiveness. He is puzzled, but quickly understands matters when a shot is heard in Nadya's bedroom. He falls to one knee and kisses Nadya's hand. :Source: Mander and Mitchenson.Mander and Mitchenson, pp. 66‚Äì69 Revivals and adaptations The Queen Was in the Parlour was revived at the Malvern Festival in 1932, by a company including Kate Cutler and the young James Mason. Mander and Mitchenson's Theatrical Companion to No√´l Coward (2000) notes that there has never been a major London or New York revival.Mander and Mitchenson, p. 73 The play has been adapted for film twice. An Anglo-German version under the original title, was filmed in 1927, starring Lili Damita and Paul Richter. It was premiered at the Avenue Pavilion, London February 1928.Mander and Mitchenson, p. 72 In 1933 an American film version, Tonight Is Ours starred Claudette Colbert and Fredric March.Mander and Mitchenson, pp. 72‚Äì73 Critical reception The press expressed mild surprise that Coward, who had gained fame for his daringly controversial The Vortex, should turn to Ruritanian romance, but the reviews were generally friendly. The Times said \\"[T[his is Mr. Coward in romantic vein, and little else matters so long as the romance goes with a swing. This it does indeed.\\" In The Daily Mail, Alan Parsons wrote, \\"It is all strong stuff, some of it witty stuff, some of it hot stuff, but Mr. Coward shows that he can construct what is known as a 'a well-made play' with the best of the Victorians.Quoted in Mander and Mitchenson, p. 69 In The Observer, St John Ervine wrote: :Mr. Coward gives us both his best and his worst in generous measure. There are passages and even scenes in this play so poverty-stricken and dull that one has difficulty in believing that anybody wrote them. They are followed by passages and scenes so swiftly sincere and dramatic that one is certain that nobody but Mr. Coward could have written them. He tells a story here, and tells it very well, but he still shows signs of too great facility.Ervine, St John. \\"At the Play\\", The Observer, 29 August 1926, p. 9 Looking back in the 1950s, Coward wrote: :It was my one and only expedition into Ruritania and I enjoyed it very much. Ruritania is a dangerous country where romantic clich√©s lurk in every throne-room, but at that time I was young and eager and valiantly oblivious of them. ... on the whole, I didn't make a bad job of it. The first act in Paris is a little forced and over-hectic, but the second and third acts contain some good moments. ... The whole play was illuminated by the magic of Madge Titheradge's acting. Her restrained emotion in the farewell supper scene ... and her stillness and dignity at the end of the play I shall always remember with loving gratitude.Quoted in Mander and Mitchenson, pp. 71‚Äì72 References  Sources  * 1922 plays 1926 plays Plays by No√´l Coward British plays West End plays British plays adapted into films ","title":"The Queen Was in the Parlour"},{"id":"30880236","text":"Johannes Jacobus Beijnes 1814-1888 Johannes Jacobus, or J.J.

Biography Omnibus built for the Amsterdam Omnibus Maatschappij in 1883 He was the son of J.J. Beijnes the elder who had a carriage shop behind the St. Bavochurch on the Riviervischmarkt in Haarlem. Both he and his brother went to work for his father, though young A.J. became an independent smith in the Grote Houtstraat at number 179.\\"Beijnes : een eeuw van arbeid : 1838 - 1 november - 1938\\"; by Henri Asselberghs with color plates by Herman Heijenbroek and drawings by Herman Moerkerk; Impressum Haarlem : Spaarnestad, 1938 In 1853 both companies were merged, and in 1858 the company's name was changed to Fabriek van Rijtuigen en Spoorwagens J.J. Beijnes when they moved premises to what is now Stationsplein, Haarlem in order to serve their largest customer, the Hollandsche IJzeren Spoorweg- Maatschappij (HIJSM). To service the trains on the rails between Haarlem and Amsterdam, the HIJSM took on the services of the Fabriek van Rijtuigen en Spoorwagens J.J. Beijnes in Haarlem as sole supplier. The locomotive engines were imported, but all of the train cars were built by Beijnes. The company grew so fast, that in 1891, the HIJSM, aided by the social activist Daniel de Clercq, began the Haarlem society called De Ambachtsschool to unify various city efforts to start a vocational school in Haarlem, in order to satisfy their need for workers in the booming train car business.Deugd boven geweld, Een geschiedenis van Haarlem, 1245-1995, edited by Gineke van der Ree- Scholtens, 1995, , p555 The J.J. Beijnes carriage factory was in operation for 125 years from 1838‚Äì1963, and it built and serviced horse carriages (omnibusses), trams, and trains, based at Stationsplein, Haarlem, Netherlands. Today that land is used as a bus station across from the Haarlem railway station, and all that remains is a sports hall and parking garage with the name Beijnes.

Meusebach moved to the property in 1869, after a tornado destroyed his family home in Comal County. John O. Meusebach was born in Dillenburg, Duchy of Nassau, with a background in botany, and educated and trained as a lawyer. As Commissioner- General of the Adelsverein, he founded the city of Fredericksburg, and opened up the Fisher‚ÄìMiller Land Grant territory to settlement when he brokered the Meusebach‚ÄìComanche Treaty. He later served as Texas State Senator District 22. His Loyal Valley homesite was designated a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark in 1969, Marker number 11288. New Braunfels tornado On September 12, 1869 a tornado destroyed the Meusebach home in New Braunfels. Meusebach, whose foot had been pinned beneath a heavy beam, was the only member of his family to be injured. The foot injury remained with him the rest of his life. Loyal Valley After the 1869 tornado, Meusebach purchased seven hundred acres north of Fredericksburg and southeast of Mason, on U.S. Highway 87 to right-of-way at the intersection of US 87 and RR 2242. He named the area Loyal Valley to reflect his sentiments about the Union during the Civil War. A trip to Fredericksburg was half a day's ride, and a trip to New Braunfels took about two days. Ferdinand Lindheimer was a frequent visitor who exchanged botanical specimens with Meusebach for evaluation.King (1967) p.162,163 Charles Henry Nimitz, grandfather of Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz, made a special visit to the Loyal Valley residence. Nimitz later gave an interview about the visit to the Fredericksburg newspaper Das Wochenblatt, detailing the orchards and gardens Meusebach had cultivated.King (1967) p.169-170 His wife Agnes and children stayed in New Braunfels until 1875, to benefit from the New Braunfels school system. At Loyal Valley, he built a native limestone home. Outside his home beneath a privacy trellis, he built a Roman style bathtub out of limestone and cement. On his acreage he indulged in his love of horticulture by maintaining an orchard, ornamental shrubs and a personal rose garden. Meusebach opened a mercantile establishment that evolved into a stage stop and the area's community gathering place, where he survived a gunshot wound to the leg, inflicted by trouble makers during the Mason County Hoo Doo War.TexFiles Meusebach was appointed justice of the peace, notary public and served as the community‚Äôs second postmaster in 1873. The family's home was destroyed by fire in 1886, and Meusebach built a new one.King (1967) p.163-169 Death Meusebach died on May 27, 1897, on his property in Loyal Valley, and is buried in the family cemetery in Cherry Spring.

The G√ºrtel case is an ongoing political corruption scandal in Spain, which implicates officers of the People's Party (PP), Spain's major conservative party, some of whom have been forced to resign or have been suspended. G√ºrtel is one of the largest corruption scandals in recent Spanish history, and there are related scandals, such as the B√°rcenas case, which have received media attention in their own right. The case came to public attention in early 2009, but for the most part the suspects were not put on trial until October 2016. The investigative operation was given the name G√ºrtel in a cryptic reference to one of the principal suspects, Francisco Correa S√°nchez (correa as a Spanish word means belt in English, G√ºrtel in German). Correa is a businessman who cultivated links with PP officers. The Spanish police began to investigate his activities in 2007 after a whistle-blower, Ana Garrido Ramos, provided information regarding alleged corruption in the Madrid region. The accusations include bribery, money laundering and tax evasion. They implicate a circle of businessmen led by Correa and politicians from the People's Party, although some of the evidence refers to participants by initials and nicknames such as \\"Luis el Cabron\\". The alleged illicit activities relate to party funding and the awarding of contracts by local/regional governments in Valencia,Zafra, Ignacio (13 July 2011), \\"Camps' defense changes tack in attempt to shelve trial.\\" El Pa√≠s (English edition) the Community of Madrid and elsewhere.

Garz√≥n had five suspects, including Correa, detained in February 2009. Garz√≥n was suspended as a judge in 2010 pending his own trial on a charge of exceeding his authority with regard to a case unrelated to G√ºrtel (his investigation into Francoist crimes against humanity). This particular suspension was eventually overturned, but it was still in force when, in 2011, Garz√≥n was given another suspension, this time pending trial for having violated lawyer-client privilege in the G√ºrtel case. (He had recorded conversations between detained suspects and their lawyers). \\"Garz√≥n defiende en Valencia las escuchas del caso G√ºrtel.\\" El MundoZuber, Helene (2102), \\"Prosecuting the Prosecutor.\\" Spiegel International (Spiegel Online) The case was reassigned to Judge .

Correa's legal team appealed, saying that the amount was not based on an objective assessment of their client's wealth, as Correa's access to some accounts had been blocked and there was uncertainty about how much wealth he held abroad. Correa was released on bail in June 2012 by which time Pedreira, who was suffering from Parkinson's disease, had been replaced by the third judge to handle the case Pablo Ruz. Ruz reduced the sum required to 200,000 euros, a reduction reflecting not only the accused's perceived ability to pay, but also the length of time he had been held on remand, which was approaching the maximum possible under Spanish law. \\"Francisco Correa sale de prisi√≥n tras pagar 200.000 ‚Ç¨ de fianza\\" 20minutos. Retrieved 5 December 2013. The investigation took a long time for various reasons including the number of suspects and delays in receiving information from foreign banks.

El Pais However, Ruz had been taken off the case by the time the first part came to trial in 2016. =G√ºrtel in Valencia= A case involving the Valencian branch of the alleged network went to court relatively quickly. It was known in the press as the \\"suitgate\\" affair, as it involved allegations regarding suits supposedly given to prominent Valencian politician Francisco Camps. After a partial dismissal in 2009, the Supreme Court of Spain ordered it to be reopened.Paul Mitchell (1 September 2010), \\"Spain: Popular Party embroiled in corruption scandal.\\", World Socialist Web Site In 2011, Camps resigned as Valencian premier and leader of the Valencian Partido Popular in order to avoid standing trial while in office. \\"Francisco Camps dimite\\" El Mundo, 20 July 2011 Camps was found not guilty in 2012, \\"Camps y Costa, no culpables.\\" El Pais, 25 January 2012. and the verdict was upheld on appeal.

This admission became for the inquiry into \\"associations\\" of the provinces of Castell√≥n, Valencia and Alicante. =2018 verdict= On 24 May 2018, several Spanish politicians and business- people, including Correa, his lieutenant Pablo Crespo, and former Spanish treasurer Luis B√°rcenas, were convicted in the G√ºrtel case. Correa was sentenced to 51 years in prison while Crespo was jailed for 37 years and six months. B√°rcenas, a close ally of Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, received a 33-year sentence and a fine of ‚Ç¨44m. B√°rcenas's wife, Rosal√≠a Iglesias, was jailed for 15 years, and Correa's ex-wife, Carmen Rodr√≠guez Quijano, for 14 years and eight months. It was also ruled that the ruling People's Party had taken part in the kickback scheme since 1989. Of the 37 individuals charged, 29 were convicted while 8 were acquitted. Following this, on 1 June, Prime Minister Rajoy was ousted by a vote of no confidence. Media coverage Caricature of √Ålvaro P√©rez, known as El Bigotes (the mustache). He was one of the people convicted in relation to activities in Valencia. Prior to 2013, reactions to G√ºrtel often divided on party political lines, with the more conservative media downplaying the significance of the allegations. Spain's highest-circulation daily newspaper, centre-left El Pa√≠s, which traditionally supports the PSOE, won a major press award (an Ortega y Gasset Award) in 2010 for investigative journalism relating to G√ºrtel.REPORTAJE: XXVII Premios Ortega y Gasset P√∫blico, a newspaper with a more left-wing stance than El Pa√≠s, also gave much coverage to the case.The print edition of Publico folded in 2012, but it is still available on-line at www.publico.es. In 2013 the picture became more complicated, as the Barcenas case started dividing the electorate of the People's Party. While the conservative ABC kept toeing the party line, the centre-right El Mundo carried some of the major revelations about the case. Corruption and transparency in Spain It has been argued that the underlying problem is not a party political one, but rather a system which does not require transparency in the award of contracts.(21 April 2010) The G√ºrtel scandal: The missing debate, Reflections on Spain Spain occupied the 40th place in Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index of 2013 (having dropped from 30th place). In 2016 Spain's first anti-corruption commission began work.Can Spain‚Äôs first anti- graft commission restore voter confidence? B√°rcenas papers January 2013 saw major revelations regarding the activities of Luis B√°rcenas, the former treasurer of the Partido Popular. The Spanish justice system released information from the Swiss authorities regarding his financial dealings in Switzerland, and the press reported on alleged slush funds run for the benefit of the Partido Popular. The allegations of illegal party funding came initially from El Mundo, Spain's leading center-right newspaper which is normally close to the Partido Popular. It alleged that secret donations had been used for under-the-table payments (\\"backhanders\\") to party officials.EFE, \\"Spain‚Äôs Ruling Party to Probe Swiss Bank Account Scandal.\\" in Latin American Herald Tribune Citing sources within the Partido Popular, the newspaper appeared to clear its current leadership, saying that the reported payments were made between 1989 and 2009.

On 31 January, El Pa√≠s published facsimiles of handwritten accounts, allegedly from Barcenas' hand and detailing slush funds, which report a total of 250,000 euros illegally paid to former prime minister Mariano Rajoy.\\"Spain corruption scandal turns up heat on PM Rajoy.\\" Reuters, 31 January 2013Castro, Irene.\\"Mariano Rajoy incumpli√≥ la ley si cobr√≥ del PP mientras era ministro.\\" eldiario.es The alleged funds came mostly from private building construction companies, like FCC and OHL; this, if the allegations are confirmed, would raise additional questions on Spain's building boom. While the PP filed a defamation lawsuit against El Pa√≠s (which it subsequently dropped), it took no action against El Mundo. Attorney General Eduardo Torres-Dulce ordered the anti-corruption prosecutor to investigate any possible links between the alleged payments handed out to Popular Party (PP) officials and case filings in the G√ºrtel case. In 2014 El Pa√≠s commented that it is hard to draw a clear line between the two cases, G√ºrtel and Barcenas. However, the cases are being processed separately by the Spanish courts.

He is also known for his attempts at founding settlements near Banjarmasin on the island of Borneo and the Cocos-Keeling Islands.  Malacca  The son of a London watchmaker of the same name and his wife Janet,Familysearch Alexander joined a trading company in Portugal around 1800, moved to Calcutta, and settled as a merchant in Malacca in 1807. Among the places he traded to was Banjarmasin, on the southern coast of Borneo. Banjarmasin had a Dutch trading post, but it was abandoned in 1809 due to British naval hostilities. The Sultan, seeking a replacement for the Dutch, and having developed a good relationship with Hare, asked him to establish a British trading post. But Hare was cautious and waited until his own interests converged with the rising star of Stamford Raffles of the British East India Company (EIC) before acting. Hare had first met Stamford Raffles when the later stopped in Malacca in 1807 and 1808 on sick-leave from Penang. A few years later, when Dutch control briefly passed to Britain (1811‚Äì16) and the EIC, Raffles, as the newly appointed Lieutenant Governor of Java, acting on Hare's request made him Resident of Banjarmasin and Commissioner of the Island of Borneo.  Banjarmasin  Eventually arriving in Banjarmasin in 1812, Hare negotiated a treaty with the Sultan on behalf of the Company. The Sultan also granted him 1,400 square miles of land for his own use. This grant stretched along the coast from the mouth of the Barito River to Tanjong Selatan and inland to the north up to the Sungei Matapura. This was mostly marshland mixed with areas of grassland and some forest. A number of villages sheltered on or near the coast. Although it was technically against EIC policy for its employees to accept large gifts of land, Raffles acquiesced in order to reward Hare for his services in expanding British influence in the region. Hare established his estate as an independent polity, Maluka, which issued its own coinage, possessed its own flag and levied custom duties. Being mostly absent from his estate, Hare hired John Clunies Ross first as a ship captain in 1813 and in 1816 as overseer of the settlement. Ross was instructed to clear land for rice, sugar, coffee and pepper and build a new trading boat. He was also to build a salt works and defensive posts to ward off pirates. The signing of the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814, part of the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars, was the beginning of the end for Hare's dream of an independent state. Although both Raffles and his successor as Lieutenant General, John Fendall, resisted Dutch requests for the Borneo colonies to be returned as they considered them deserted by the Dutch rather than conquered by the British and hence not falling under the terms of the treaty, this was not the position of the EIC as a whole. In January of 1817 a Dutch representative signed a treaty giving them control of much territory around Banjarmasin in return for supporting the Sultan against his local and regional enemies. It is likely that Hare could have kept his estate despite this change of authority, but he antagonized the Dutch, making them feel that he was interested in using the estate as a springboard for further British intrusions on what they saw as their political and economic interests in the region. As a result in 1818 the new Dutch government declared that Hare had no legal right to the property (the Sultan having conveniently lost the earlier treaty he had signed with Hare), ordering the local Dutch contingent to take control of the land, by force if necessary. This was done in July 1818. Hare's activity in Banjarmasin came under great scrutiny with the EIC concerned about his use of company funds for the development of his personal estate. There were also allegations that people had been forcibly relocated to the colony as a source of labour. A Commission of Inquiry, formed in 1816, investigated both charges, finding a great deal to complain about in terms of Hare's accounting. The Inquiry also faulted him with being aware that a number of females had been kidnapped and brought to the colony. However, the more series charge, alleged by William Boggie, that he had enslaved over three thousand people was found to be unsupportable. William Boggie had his own grievances with Raffles, recorded in a letter written by his advocate James Simpson in 1834, and likely raised the issue as a means to discredit him  Raffles was widely known to detest the practice of slavery and if one of his appointees was found to be engaging in the practice on a massive scale it would have been extremely embarrassing. De man die vrouwen verzamelde; Een koloniale geschiedenis van de Kokos-eilanden by Joop van den Berg (‚Äòs-Gravenhage 1998) What is certain is that Hare faced a labour shortage that unless overcome would have made the development of his colony impossible. To overcome this obstacle, in 1812 he asked Raffles to have convicts from Java transported to Banjarmasin as part of their sentences as well as to encourage destitute individuals to migrate. The latter group was to be provided with assistance. Both could take their families, if they wished. However, the majority of both groups were single males and so, in order to rectify the imbalance, the authorities were enjoined to encourage female migration by offering a sum of money or release from debt.  Batavia and Bencoolen  Hare left the colony two years before the Dutch takeover, moving to his estates at Pangielpingan and Kampong Mangis, near Batavia on the island of Java. He tried to resume trading with Malacca, but was harassed by the Dutch authorities who detained and seized several of his ships in 1817 and 1818. His movements were also restricted. Finally, in March 1819, he was banned from residing in the colony, although he was given a number of months in which to wrap up his affairs. He transferred the estates on Java to his son, also named Alexander, and in December embarked on a series of trips, first to the island of Lombok, to meet his brother John and transfer to a larger ship, and then to the EIC fort at Bencoolen (modern day Bengkulu) on the island of Sumatra. His plan was to settle at Capetown, South Africa while the ship continued onward to England, but to do so it needed to be registered. Here he ran into difficulties because, like many other wealthy Europeans in the East Indies at the time, he had adopted the local custom of acquiring slaves and concubines. In Hare's case this amounted to sixty adults and thirty children. The magistrate at Bencoolen freed these people although they were persuaded to stay with Hare.  Capetown, South Africa  Arriving at Capetown at the end of June he bought a farm outside of the town and settled down to a more sedentary life. However, the fact that he lived with a large number of concubines appears to have dampened his popularity within colonial society and may have been in large part responsible for his next move. In 1826 he landed on Pulo Selma, one of the uninhabited Cocos-Keeling Islands, where he proceeded to build a settlement. Later he moved to Pulo Beras and also established small outposts on many of the other islands. It appears that his long-term goal at this point was not a permanent residency, but rather a short-term base from which he could negotiate a return to his estates on Java. Unfortunately, it was a task harder than he first thought and in the meantime his former employee, John Clunies Ross, developed his own designs on the Islands, wanting to build them up as a way-station to the Indies, an idea inimical to Hare's notion of a good life. A state of conflict developed, resolving only when Hare abandoned his settlement in early 1831. It is likely that this final move in Hare's life was precipitated by dissolving of his family business interests in London  his source of funds dried up. It also meant that he could not take most of his followers and concubines, these individuals came under the control of Ross. Hare sailed to Bencoolen where he established his residence, but died in November 1834.  Hare's family and literary influence  Alexander Hare had three brothers: David (b.1777), became a jeweller in Batavia, while John (b.1782) and Joseph (b.1784) Familysearch were traders in colonial goods in London. The English censuses of 1851 and 1861 show Fatimah, Joseph's niece born in the East Indies, living in his London house: as she appears to have been born in 1837 she was presumably David's daughter.Census via Familysearch She married James Graham at St Peter's, Pimlico 22 May 1862 and died at London 1874.

A possible partition would be the division of Kosovo along ethnic lines, such as separating Serb-dominated North Kosovo, and possibly some enclaves in the south, from the rest of Albanian-dominated Kosovo. A partition was proposed several times, even before the 2008 Kosovo declaration of independence, although the question has most recently been raised after the 2011‚Äì13 North Kosovo crisis. History =1990s: proposals from last days of Socialist Yugoslavia to period of Kosovo War= Serbian politician Dobrica ƒÜosiƒá initially proposed the \\"delineanation with the Croats and the Albanians\\" in 1990, stating that \\"Kosovo can not be preserved. It is realistic to delineate, while retaining the coal [mines] and sanctities\\", according to Bora Joviƒá. Branislav Krstiƒá proposed partition in 1992, worked on further variants in 1993, and finally submitted a draft to the government in 1994. His 1992 proposal included giving autonomy based on the Vance‚ÄìOwen plan, while Serb and Montenegrin areas be integrated into the state. In 1996, Aleksandar Despiƒá expressed his thoughts on that Kosovo should be divided. During the Kosovo War in 1998, Du≈°an Batakoviƒá was the organizer of the proposal of \\"cantonization\\". In 1999 that proposal was submitted to the French government. It was not accepted by the international community. That year, Bernard Kushner proposed the creation of Serb safety zones. On April 30, 1999, Margaret Thatcher, the former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (1979‚Äì90), gave a speech in which she strongly opposed a partition.MEMORANDUM TO: OPINION LEADERS - April 30, 1999 , at the site of Project for the New American Century =Proposals in aftermath of Kosovo War= Vice-President of the Serbian government Neboj≈°a ƒåoviƒá proposed on 18 May 2001 that two entities, a Serbian and an Albanian, be established on Kosovo and Metohija. The Serbian entity would be under the protection of the Yugoslav Army and police, while the Albanian entity would have the highest grade of autonomy and stay under the protection of international powers. In 2002, Serbian Prime Minister Zoran ƒêinƒëiƒá stated that \\"Serbia has neither the mechanism nor the resources to reintegrate Kosovo into its legal system, or to create a form in which it will be under its sovereignty. The division of the province, therefore, is nothing else than an attempt to rescue what can still be saved.\\" The policy of partitioning Kosovo and unification of Republika Srpska with Serbia was seen as offering \\"long-term security and stability for the region\\", according to Aleksandar Jokic (2003). In 2004, Anatol Lieven of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace stated that the \\"Partition of Kosovo is the most realistic solution, but the Albanians' insisting on independence will lead to a new conflict.\\" ƒåedomir Antiƒá of G17 Plus said that the \\"Partition of Kosmet is not an ideal solution, but it is the maximum that can be obtained at this time.\\" Albanologist Miranda Vickers said that the partition of Kosovo would be the best solution. In 2005, part of the Serbia-Kosovo negotiation was the Serbian side's call for the establishment of Serb municipalities and constitutional and legal protection of Serbs. UN Special Representative (UNOSEK) Jessen- Petersen and Kosovo speaker Daci reiterated the ruling out of partition. Contact Groups' German representative Michael Scheffer also stressed that there should be no division. CIA Deputy Chief of the Balkan Task Force Steven Meyer stated that \\"The Government of Serbia should not forget about a division of Kosovo, which no one in the international community would support, nor dismiss as a solution. Changing borders has never been the Holy Scripture of the EU and the UN.\\" Charles A. Kupchan of the Council on Foreign Relations said that \\"Giving northern Kosovo, Pristina will be freed from futile attempts to establish rule over a province intending to maintain ties with Belgrade.\\" Serbian intellectual Desimir To≈°iƒá said that he supported the option of partition, \\"but that now there is very little chance, because Serbia will never return to Serbia in the state of 1912, 1918 or 1945.\\" In 2006, Sanda Ra≈°koviƒá-Iviƒá, President of the Coordination Centre for Kosovo and Metohija, said that \\"If both sides, both Serbs and Albanians, face the fact that for both living in cohabitation is impossible, and if the international community is faces the same fact, then a kind of partition of Kosovo would represent a solution for both sides.\\" Slobodan Samard≈æiƒá, adviser to the Serbian PM, said that a long-term solution would be partition, \\"given the fact that the Albanians so far clearly do not want to live with the Serbs.\\" In 2007, political analyst Andrey Piontkovsky said that \\"Serbia needs to stand up for the partition of Kosovo with the argument that there are no international forces that can keep Kosovo Serbs safe in an independent Kosovo.\\" Law professor Timothy William Waters said that \\"The division is possible and it is possible that this is the right thing to do.\\" Erhard Busek said that \\"the partition of Kosovo is perhaps the least bad solution\\". Ivor Roberts, the former British Ambassador to Yugoslavia, supports the partition of Kosovo, stating that \\"the Partition of Kosovo will please neither side, but the equality of pain is more likely to lead to stability than present Western plans which will undoubtedly destabilise Serbia, and through Serbia the whole region.\\" =Proposals in aftermath of Kosovo's declaration of independence= On 17 February 2008, the Assembly of Kosovo, boycotted by its Serb representatives, declared independence. In 2010, US diplomats warned that European 'vacillation and weakness' could entrench Serbian control over the northern part of the territory. \\"Failure to act soon means losing northern Kosovo and will reopen the Pandora's box of ethnic conflict that defined the 1990s,\\" then US ambassador, Christopher Dell, wrote this year. \\"The time is right to end the years of drift on the north and to alter the dynamic of a hardening partition between the north and the rest of Kosovo.‚Ä¶ The current situation is untenable and deteriorating. The aim is to stop the rot.\\" Former EU Kosovo Envoy Wolfgang Ischinger, in August 2011, stated regarding the partition of Kosovo that in his opinion \\"such ideas are absolutely unacceptable\\". He added that without a solution of the conflict, a Serbian European Union membership \\"will not happen, it must not happen.\\" In September 2011, James Ker-Lindsay, senior research fellow at the London School of Economics and Political Science, stated that the partition of Kosovo is a logical solution. In an interview for \\"Politika\\", he stated that Belgrade, in the next few months, might have a chance to fight for the division of Kosovo and the establishment of large autonomy for Serbs in North Kosovo. In May 2011, Serbian Interior Minister Ivica Daƒçiƒá proposed the partition of Kosovo as a solution to the Kosovo dispute. He stated, \\"This is my opinion, although neither Belgrade nor Pri≈°tina like it. However, I am a realistic politician and I don‚Äôt see any other solution.... I think that the only realistic solution is that places where Serbs live stay in Serbia and that the other part where the Albanians live secedes. This is the only realistic way that can lead us to a quick solution.... Other solutions are a waste of time and years and decades would go in an attempt to solve those small issues\\". Former Yugoslav President Dobrica ƒÜosiƒá stated, \\"I have been talking and writing about Kosovo and Metohija in vain for 40 years now, proposing a democratic, just, compromise and permanent partition. This is the only way to overcome centuries-long antagonism between Albanians and Serbs... [and] stop the great Albanian expansion and create conditions for normal life of both peoples\\". In October 2011, former Austrian Vice-Chancellor Erhard Busek proposed partition and stated: \\"I agree that the dialogue is the only path, in scope of which issues which seem to be impossible at the moment should also be discussed, such as the division of Kosovo... I do not see why the international community would not agree on the division if Belgrade and Pri≈°tina reached an agreement on the issue. All details of such resolution of the Kosovo stalemate could be agreed at some kind of 'Kosovo Dayton', with the international community as the guarantor of the accord.\\" Macedonian president, Gjorge Ivanov, supported the continuation of the Belgrade-Pristina negotiations and said that Macedonia is against the partition of Kosovo, as that may destabilize the region. Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha stated in November 2011: \\"Dividing Kosovo is an absurd idea and respecting the borders of Kosovo is of essential interest for all the countries in the region.\\" In January 2012 Montenegrin President Milo ƒêukanoviƒá said he did not support the idea to partition Kosovo because it could \\"open the door for similar solutions in other countries in the region\\". In 14‚Äì15 February 2012, a referendum on accepting the institutions of the Republic of Kosovo was held in the Serb-dominated regions of north Kosovo. The result saw 99.74% of voters reject the Republic of Kosovo's institutions. The Community of Serb Municipalities is planned to be established according to the Brussels Agreement (2013) (see section), but it has since been paused due to opposition on the Albanian side. In October 2014, Interior Minister Ivica Daƒçiƒá said that the partition would be one of the better solutions and in the interest of both Serbs and Albanians. Steven Meyer, former CIA director and expert on the Balkans, believes that Kosovo should be divided along ethnic lines. Drawing the line Hypothetical partition, with North Kosovo ceded to Serbia. The partition of Kosovo along the line of the Ibar River has long been proposed. Following the 2008 independence declaration, the Serbian government formally proposed partition in a proposal to the UN, seeking Serb-majority North Kosovo to be controlled by Kosovo Serb border customs, judiciary and police services, albeit under UNMIK administration. North of the river is a predominantly ethnic Serb majority area, whereas south of the river is a predominantly ethnic Albanian area,BBC, Could Balkan break-up continue?, 22.02.08 with several Kosovo Serb enclaves. In 2008, the Assembly of the Community of Municipalities was established, a \\"rival\\" government based in North Kosovo, loyal to Belgrade. At that time the rest of Kosovo was administrated by the UNMIK and government of the Republic of Kosovo. Miroslav Marjanoviƒá, a top intelligence agent during the 1990s and Kosovo War, in 2016 made public classified information regarding the Kosovo War, among which were DST telegrams from 1998 about the Kosovo Liberation Army and the evaluation that France and Germany were closer to agreeing on a partition of Kosovo into a Serbian and an Albanian part, with the Albanians receiving status similar to that of Republika Srpska. Among documents were also maps depicting the potential partition. Community of Serb Municipalities The 2013 Brussels Agreement between the governments of Kosovo and Serbia agreed to create the Community of Serb Municipalities in Kosovo. Its assembly will have no legislative authority and the judicial authorities will be integrated and operate within the Kosovo legal framework. The association was expected to be formed in 2015, but opposition riots and a petition signed by over 203,000 citizens slowed it down. The Constitutional Court of Kosovo ruled that the formation of the Association was in compliance with the constitution of Kosovo, but that certain aspects of its proposed implementation were not.

Johnston House, because Chickasaw Governor Douglas Hancock Johnston and his descendants resided in the mansion from 1898 to 1971\\"Chickasaw Nation White House\\" Profile at Travelok.com when the building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. At the time of its construction, the house was on the north edge of the community of Emet, Oklahoma, where Johnston operated a store, but its formal street address is now 6379 E. Mansion Dr., Milburn, Oklahoma On July 21, 1902, Johnston Murray, the son of Oklahoma Governor William H. Murray, was born at the mansion. William H. Murray had married Mary Alice Hearrell, one of Johnston's nieces, and their son, Johnston Murray, would go on to become the 14th Oklahoma Governor. Julie Chisholm, a granddaughter of Jesse Chisholm and a niece of the Johnstons, was also married in the mansion.\\"White House of the Chickasaws Nomination Form #71000662\\", National Register of Historic Places, 1971 The house is now a historic house museum owned by the Chickasaw Nation and has been restored to a 1900 appearance. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 5, 1971, under Criteria A and C. At that time, the house was still owned by descendants of the Governor. Construction The house design was a gingerbread style, commonly used in Victorian architecture during the late 19th century. The center section of the house had four rooms. From south to north these were: * Parlor room (aka music room); * Sitting room (aka library); * State dining room; * Kitchen. Two-room wings flanked the center. The one on the west was separated from the sitting room by an open breezeway. This wing comprised Governor Johnston\\"s bedroom and office. General construction lumber was obtained locally, but most of the finishing lumber was transported by wagon from Denison, Texas. The two ornate fireplaces inside the house had mantles and facings made of cherry mahogany, which were brought from Chattanooga, Tennessee. The porch that originally encircled the house used imported walnut for the ornamental woodwork. The house is well-preserved. Only a few changes have been made to the original design. Around 1903 or 1904, the breezeway was removed and replaced with a stairway that led to the attic area, where a bedroom and bathroom had been added. Indoor bathrooms were added later, and lighting changed from the original coal-oil lamps (both hanging and standing).

Research activities The Institute's research activities are focussed on the central task of providing for the health and performance of the persons involved (pilot, crew, passenger, astronaut, motorist, resident etc.) Furthermore, from a medical point of view the development of countermeasures to protect humans from the effects of weightlessness, like the loss of bone and muscle mass, is one of our main tasks to enable long-term stays of humans in space. At the same time, when conducting research under microgravity conditions, basic functions of the human body are examined by eliminating the interfering influence of gravity in a system-physiological approach. In the field of psychology, the selection of qualified personnel (pilots, astronauts, air traffic controllers) and the development of suitable scientific instruments for the selection procedure are another main task of the Institute. Finally, we also deal with the problem of adaptation of life to extreme environments and take part in projects that are concerned with the search for life in space. Core tasks and working groups =Medical Operations= Medical Operations is an interdisciplinary field covering aviation, space and travel medicine. Work carried out here includes the study of the physical, physiological, psychological, ergonomic and medical characteristics of air and space travel. The department is also responsible for the health and well-being of flight personnel and passengers and regularly carries out medical examinations on those groups. =Biomedical Science Support Center= This division integrates all activities in ME that provide support for ME internal as well as for external scientists in the field of gravity-relevant applications in the biomedical sciences. The profile reaches from scientific and administrational support when planning experiments in microgravity over concrete experiment preparation and operational support for accepted flight experiments and corresponding ground experiments up to data management. This expertise is also applied in projects of related fields like telemedicine and ground systems for satellite communications. =Flight Physiology= The research activities of the flight physiology division focus on \\"workload of aviation personnel\\", \\"effects of aircraft noise on humans\\" and within the field of \\"performance and environment\\" on basic and special questions about effects of external stressors on humans (e.g. jet-lag, sleep- deprivation, decompression problems in space). =Aviation and Space Psychology= The Institute's Department of Aviation and Space Psychology is located in Hamburg and is largely responsible for personnel selection and certain areas of behavioural training for operation staff (pilots, air traffic controllers and astronauts). In April 2002 the Departments' Quality management system was ISO 9001 certified. As the first Q-System worldwide, this certificate covers all stages of psychological diagnostics. =Radiation Biology= The Radiation Biology Department is concerned with aviation and space relevant questions regarding the effects of radiation on humans and the biosphere. These include, amongst radiation health and protection issues for astronauts and aircraft crews, monitoring the biological consequences of environmental radiation and genotoxic conditions by biological dosimetry and biosensors and bioassays, the assessment of habitability of other planets with special consideration of possible Mars mission scenarios. =Space Physiology= The research of space physiology focusses on the influence of weightlessness, nutrition, physical inactivity, unloading, and aging processes on human health. The investigations are performed in an integrative approach - from the cell to the whole organism - on ground and in space. =Transport Safety= The working group Transport Safety uses competences and technological innovations from aviation and space research to develop new solutions for problems of road and rail transport.

It is located east-northeast of Beaverlodge, Alberta. It was closed in 1988. It was operated as part of the Pinetree Line network controlled by NORAD. History As a result of the Cold War and with the expansion of a North American continental air defence system, The site at Saskatoon Mountain was selected as a site for a United States Air Force (USAF) radar station, one of the many that would make up the Pinetree Line of Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) radar sites. Construction on the base began in 1952 and was completed by 1953. The base was manned by members of the USAF's Air Defense Command (ADC) 919th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron, being known as Saskatoon Mountain Air Station. In February 1953, operations began at the unit's permanent home. The station was equipped with AN/FPS-3C, AN/FPS-502, AN/FPS-20A; AN/TPS-502, and AN/FPS-6B radars. As a GCI base, the 915th's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. These interceptors were based at Larson Air Force Base in Washington. The Ground Air Transmitting Receiving (GATR) Site for communications was located at , approximately 1,1 mile southwest from the main site. Normally the GATR site was connected by a pair of buried telephone cables, with a backup connection of dual telephone cables overhead. The Coordinate Data Transmitting Set (CDTS) (AN/FST-2) at the main site converted each radar return into a digital word which was transmitted by the GATR via microwave to the Control center. In the early 1960s, the USAF relinquished control of the base to the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF). This was part of an arrangement with the United States that came as a result of the cancellation of the Avro Arrow. Canada would lease 66 F-101 Voodoo fighters and take over operation of 12 Pinetree radar bases. Upon hand-over on 1 April 1963, the operating unit was re-designated 57 Aircraft Control & Warning Squadron and the base, RCAF Station Saskatoon Mountain. Radars at the station were also upgraded to the following equipment: * Search Radars: AN/FPS-3C, AN/FPS-502, AN/FPS-20A * Height Radars: AN/TPS-502, AN/FPS-6B On 1 May 1964 radar operations at 57 Squadron were automated by the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, and the station became a long-range radar site. It would no longer guide interceptors but only look for enemy aircraft, feeding data to the Spokane Air Defense Sector SAGE DC-15 Direction Center of the 25th NORAD Region at Larson AFB, Washington. In November 1963, 57 AC&W; Squadron, RCAF Station Saskatoon Mountain became 57 Radar Squadron, RCAF Station Beaverlodge. The station had a rather majestic postal address of Trumpeter, Alberta. As a result of the unification of the Canadian Forces in 1968, the new Canadian Forces organization absorbed the RCAF, RCN and the Canadian Army. 57 Radar Squadron, RCAF Station Beaverlodge, became simply Canadian Forces Station (CFS) Beaverlodge in 1966. Also in 1966, the facilities at Larson AFB were closed, and control of the station was switched to the SAGE Direction Center at McChord AFB, Washington (DC-12). The station was administratively accountable to Canadian Forces Air Defence Command, and its successor Fighter Group. In August 1984, Beaverlodge became part of the Canada West ROCC. The station carried on its assigned duties until operations ceased on 1 April 1988. Today, the facilities of the radar station have been removed, and the land is now a cleared grassy site with little or no evidence of its military past.

It is a very small, single-dome, stone building and the interior is decorated with frescoes dating back to the 13th and 14th centuries. Dedication The inscription on the bottom of the arch indicates that the temple was dedicated by Lavrentios, monk and abbot of St. Andronikos Monastery, to ‚ÄúSt. Themonianos‚Äù, a local saint. The inscription reads (in Greek): :‚ÄúŒ†ŒëŒùŒ£ŒïŒ†Œ§ŒüŒ£ ŒùŒëŒüŒ£ Œ§ŒüŒ• ŒüŒ£ŒôŒüŒ• Œ†ŒëŒ§Œ°ŒüŒ£ ŒòŒïŒúŒüŒùŒôŒëŒùŒüŒ• ŒîŒôŒë Œ£Œ•ŒùŒîŒ°ŒüŒúŒóŒ£ ŒöŒëŒô ŒïŒö Œ†ŒüŒõŒõŒüŒ• Œ†ŒüŒòŒüŒ• ŒõŒëŒ•Œ°ŒïŒùŒ§ŒôŒüŒ• ŒôŒïŒ°ŒüŒúŒüŒùŒëŒßŒüŒ• ŒöŒëŒô ŒöŒëŒòŒóŒìŒüŒ•ŒúŒïŒùŒüŒ• Œ§ŒóŒ£ Œ£ŒïŒíŒëŒ£ŒúŒôŒëŒ£ ŒúŒüŒùŒóŒ£ Œ§ŒüŒ• ŒïŒù ŒëŒìŒôŒüŒôŒ£ Œ†ŒëŒ§Œ°ŒüŒ£ ŒóŒúŒ©Œù ŒëŒùŒîŒ°ŒüŒùŒôŒöŒüŒ•.‚Äù The name St. Themonianos mentioned in the inscription is almost certainly a corruption on the name of St. Euphemianos, a local 12th-century saint who led an ascetic life in a cave near the village of Lefkoniko in the plain of Masaoria, and was one of \\"three hundred\\" Palestinian refugees who fled to Cyprus during the Arab persecutions against the Christians.http://noctoc- noctoc.blogspot.com/2009/11/saint-ephimianos-and-his-church-in.html Other variations on the name include Phenianos (Œ¶Œ∑ŒΩŒπŒ±ŒΩœåœÇ), Thymianos (ŒòœÖŒºŒπŒ±ŒΩœåœÇ), or Thomianos (ŒòœâŒºŒπŒ±ŒΩœåœÇ). The church itself was colloquially known to the local villagers as St. Phenianos (ŒÜŒπœÇ Œ¶Œ∑ŒΩŒπŒ±ŒΩœåœÇ). Technically, the Church of St. Euphemianos is a chapel, due to its diminutive size and the fact that it was not the main church of Lysi, there was no priest assigned to it, and services were only held there on special occasions. Before the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974, thousands would visit the church on the Saint‚Äôs feast day on November 14. Dome and Byzantine frescoes The dome of the church is decorated with a fresco showing Christ Pantocrator, the 'All sovereign'. Surrounding the figure of Christ is a double row of angels moving towards the Hetoimasia or empty throne prepared by God the Father for the Second Coming of Christ. The throne is guarded by the Archangel Michael and Archangel Gabriel and two seraphim. The Virgin Mary leads one line of angels to the throne, while John the Baptist leads the other. In the apse, the Virgin is depicted as flanked by the two archangels with a medallion on her breast of the infant Christ, symbolizing the Incarnation of Christ. The frescoes within the church were maintained in good condition and in 1972 maintenance was undertaken by the Department of Antiquities of Cyprus.http://www.mcw.gov.cy/mcw/da/da.nsf/All/AC88DB54A8592DABC2257273003AC138?OpenDocument Following the 1974 Turkish invasion the frescos were removed, sometime between 1974 and the spring of 1983. The dome fresco with Christ Pantokrator and an apse depicting the Virgin Mary were cut into 38 pieces, and shipped to Germany by Aydƒ±n Dikmen, the Turkish art dealer and notorious smuggler, who claimed they originated from an abandoned church in southern Turkey, and prepared to sell them into the European art market.According to the report given in the Archaeological Institute of America, Dikmen was also responsible for removing frescos and mosaics from other churches for sale in the western art market. Report on line at http://www.archaeology.org/9803/newsbriefs/cyprus.html The Department of Antiquities of Cyprus was able to show that the murals were forcibly removed from the church of St. Euphemianos and following lengthy negotiations, it was agreed that ownership of the murals belongs to the Orthodox Church of Cyprus. The 38 fresco fragments were bought by the Houston- based Menil Foundation on behalf of the Greek Orthodox Church of Cyprus, the rightful owner of the frescoes. The Menil Foundation then funded a careful restoration of the paintings. A February 1992 agreement signed by the Church of Cyprus and the Menil Foundation specified that the Menil Foundation will take care of the frescoes and cover the ongoing costs of conservation in exchange for the right to present the frescoes for a period of twenty years, concluding in February 2012.https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903703604576587072924927678 The Foundation opened the Byzantine Fresco Chapel in 1997, a purpose-built home for the frescoes designed by architect Fran√ßois de Menil. The Byzantine Fresco Chapel also serves as the space for exhibition of the frescoes which are the only intact Byzantine frescoes of this size and importance to be found anywhere in the entire western hemisphere. On September 23, 2011 the Church of Cyprus and The Menil foundation announced that they had reached an agreement for the repatriation of the frescoes to Cyprus upon the expiration of the loan agreement in February 2012.

He is said to have been a native of Hungerford, in Berkshire, England. Dissenting minister Fancourt wrote that one of 'the four London ministers' was his tutor, and another his predecessor at the place from which he removed to Salisbury. This probably indicates that he was trained for the ministry by Benjamin Robinson at Hungerford, and succeeded Jeremiah Smith as pastor at Andover. Robinson and Smith were two of the four ministers who led the subscribing party at the Salters' Hall conference of 1719. From 1718 to 1730 Fancourt was minister and tutor in Salisbury. On the occasion of the controversy which arose in consequence of the proceedings at the Salters' Hall conference of London ministers in February 1719, he wrote two tracts on the side of the dogmatists. Some years later he involved himself in a controversy about free-will and predestination, and left Salisbury for London. While the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography states that he left because of theological controversy, an autobiographical letter claims that he only left because of financial pressure. The circulating library in Crane Court After leaving Salisbury Fancourt went to London and there established what was said, about forty years afterwards, to have been the first circulating library. A library conducted by him, in which the subscription was a guinea per annum, was dissolved at Michaelmas 1745, and he then carried out a new plan. This plan is described in the 'Alphabetical Catalogue of Books and Pamphlets belonging to the Circulating Library in Crane Court' (Fleet Street), 2 vols. 8vo, 1748, which he issued in parts between 1746 and 1748. According to this scheme for 'The Gentlemen and Ladies' Growing and Circulating Library,‚Äô anyone might become a proprietor by an initial payment of a guinea and a quarterly payment of a shilling. The proprietors were to choose trustees in whom the library was to be vested, Fancourt himself being appointed librarian during good behaviour. Each proprietor was to be allowed to take out one volume and one pamphlet at a time. 'He may keep them a reasonable time according to their bigness; but if they are not wanted by others he may keep them as long as he has a mind.' The library contained two or three thousand bound volumes and about the same number of pamphlets; from a third to a half of the books and pamphlets consisted of theology and ecclesiastical history and controversy, and only about a tenth of it was 'light' literature. The house in Crane Court in which it was placed was close to the quarters of the Royal Society, and either it or the house next to it was eventually taken by that society for an enlargement of its own library. Dr. Cromwell Mortimer, second secretary to the society, was a persistent enemy of the circulating library till his death in 1752. At some period later than 1755 Fancourt left Crane Court, and, after several changes, moved his library to 'the corner of one of the streets in the Strand,‚Äô where his various schemes finally broke down. The library was taken by his creditors, and he retired to Hoxton Square, where he was supported by some of the dissenting ministers, till he died at the age of ninety, on 8 June 1768. In the Crane Court library catalogue he offered for twelve guineas to teach 'any one of a common capacity and diligence' to read, write, and speak Latin with fluency in a year, by giving them five or six hours' tuition a week. Works The following is a list of Fancourt's various writings, which are all, except the ninth and the last, enumerated with long titles and extracts in the Crane Court Catalogue (vol. i. pamphlets, pp. 11, 24, 27, 166‚Äì70): *1.

She was renamed HMS Ferret in 1813 and sold in 1820. Privateer Rapid Rapid, of Portland, Maine, had two commanders, Captain W. Crabtree and Captain Joseph Weeks, during her career as a privateer. Rapid captured one ship, the Experience, and two brigs. The Experiences cargo was valued at US$250,000. The owners of one brig ransomed her and Rapid sent the other, St. Andrews, of eight guns and sailing in ballast, into Portland.Maclay (1900), p.219. Another report has Rapid capturing a barque St Andrews, of eight guns, that she sent into Portland.Coggeshall (1855), p.58. The ransomed vessel may have been the schooner Mary, of St Thomas, which Rapid ransomed as Rapid could not spare the men for a prize crew.Coggeshall (1855), p.96-7. Rapid apparently also captured the brig Pursuit, sailing from Poole to St. Andrews and the brig Tay, sailing from Dundee for Pictou, New Brunswick. Rapid sent both into Portland.Coggeshall (1855), p.45. Lastly, Rapid captured and burnt the British New Providence privateer Searcher, of one gun and twenty men.Coggeshall (1855), p.95. Capture On 17 October 1812, Maidstone and Spartan, part of the squadron under Sir John Borlase Warren, were in company when Maidstone captured Rapid on the Saint George's Bank. Rapid was armed with 14 cannon ‚Äì twelve carronades of various sizes and two long 6-pounder guns ‚Äì but her crew had thrown eight of her cannons overboard to lighten her during the nine-hour chase. She had a crew of 84 men and was three days out of Portland. Her backers had provisioned her for a three-month cruise, first off the Azores, Madeira and the Cape Verde Islands, and then off Cayenne and Bermuda. British service The British commissioned her in Halifax in November 1812 as HMS Nova Scotia under Lieutenant Bartholomew Kent, who sailed her to Britain. She was fitted at Plymouth between 7 July and 30 September 1813 and renamed Ferret. She was commissioned again in June or July of that year under Commander William Ramsden. In May 1814 Ferret was at St Helena under Commander James Stirling. Stirling commissioned Ferret rapidly on Napoleon's return to France from Elba, and received praise for the speed with which he accomplished the task.Marshall (1833), Vol 4, Part 1, pp.274-5. On 19 July 1815, Ferret was in company with , , , , and when they captured the French vessels Fortune, Papillon, Marie Graty, Marie Victorine, Cannoniere, and Printemis. The attack took place at Korejou Bay, near Brest on the coast of Brittany, and during the action Ferret was able to prevent the escape of a French man-of-war brig that she forced ashore. The action cost Ferret one man. Apparently, this cutting out expedition was the last of the war.Lee (1893), Vol. 35, p.403. Ferret then sailed to St Helena again on 15 August 1815 as part of the squadron under that was taking Napoleon Bonaparte into exile. On her way home she encountered the Spanish brigantine Dolores. At the time, Ferrets armament consisted of only eight carronades, while Dolores had a long 32-pounder gun on a pivot, four long 9-pounder guns, and two 12-pounder carronades.Marshall (1835), Vol. 4, Part 2, p.140. Ferret was therefore outranged. Doloress initial fire killed two men in Ferret. In the subsequent action, which lasted some three hours, Ferret lost another three men wounded, two of whom died later from their wounds, before she came alongside Dolores, at which point the Spaniard struck. Dolores was carrying 275 slaves, so Ferret took her to Sierra Leone for the vessel and cargo to be condemned for violating the British prohibition on the slave trade. This gave rise to a suit in which the Court found that Rear Admiral Sir George Cockburn was entitled to the flag officer's share of the prize money.Dodson et al. (1928), pp.413-9. Fate The Admiralty placed Ferret in ordinary at Plymouth in June 1816. She was fitted for sea again March‚ÄìApril 1817 under Lieutenant William Pitman. At some point in the year she may have come under the command of W. Ramsden, though she was under Pitman's command in 1818. Ferret was sold at Plymouth on 13 January 1820 to a Mr. Rundle for ‚Ç§460.

Most train services are operated by Trenitalia. Each of these companies is a subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), Italy's state-owned rail company. Some train services are operated by MetroCampania NordEst (MCNE),:it:MetroCampania NordEst which is owned by the Consorzio UnicoCampania group.:it:Consorzio UnicoCampania Location Aversa railway station is situated at Piazza Giuseppe Mazzini, at the eastern edge of the town centre. History The station was opened on 7 May 1867, upon the inauguration of the Naples‚ÄìCaserta section of the Naples‚ÄìFoggia railway. Train services The station is served by the following services (incomplete): *Intercity services Rome - Naples - Salerno - Lamezia Terme - Messina - Palermo *Intercity services Rome - Naples - Salerno - Lamezia Terme - Messina - Siracusa *Intercity services Rome - Naples - Salerno - Lamezia Terme - Reggio di Calabria *Intercity services Rome - Naples - Salerno - Taranto *Intercity services Turin - Genoa - La Spezia - Pisa - Livorno - Rome - Naples - Salerno *Night train (Intercity Notte) Rome - Naples - Messina - Siracusa *Night train (Intercity Notte) Turin - Genoa - La Spezia - Pisa - Livorno - Rome - Naples - Salerno *Regional services (Treno Regionale) Rome - Pomezia - Latina - Formia - Minturno - Naples Features View of the station yard, June 2007. The passenger building is a rectangular, two-level structure. It hosts several services, including ticketing, a bar, and the office of the railway police. In the station yard, there are seven tracks used for passenger services. The tracks are equipped with platforms, which are connected with each other by a pedestrian underpass. Management To systematize the objective parameters of all Italian railway stations, and better manage the various types of interventions (upgrading, automation, and restyling), RFI has created a classification system allocating every one of its stations to one of four categories - platinum, gold, silver, bronze. The categories take into account such factors as the number of visitors, the services offered to the railway companies, the importance of the urban context. Aversa railway station is classified gold under this system. By 2016, it will have been upgraded, as part of the PEGASUS project (Italian: Programma Evoluto per la Gestione di Aree di Stazioni Ubicate nel Sud Italia) (English: Advanced Program for Management of Areas of Stations located in South Italy), which was launched in 2004 and aimed at the improvement and enhancement of 101 stations located in southern regions. Passenger and train movements The station is one of the busiest in Campania. Its passenger flow is high and remains constant throughout the year. Many types of trains stop at the station, including regional, express, InterCity and InterCity Night trains. The station handles 156 trains per day as per the official timetable in force since December 13, 2009. There are numerous daily connections to Naples and Caserta, and Rome. Eurostar Italia High Speed With the inauguration of the Rome‚ÄìNaples high-speed railway on 19 December 2005, and more specifically the section between Roma Salon and Gricignano di Aversa it was necessary to divert the Eurostar Italia high-speed trains onto the traditional line to reach the capital of Campania inbound and outbound. In more recent times, since the completion of the remaining 18 km separating Gricignano di Aversa from Napoli Centrale on December 13, 2009, it has no longer been necessary for the Eurostar Italia high speed trains to pass through the station.

It is known from the holotype UMMP 10336 is composed of a skull, lower jaws and partial postcranium and from the associated paratype UMMP 14366, nearly complete skull, recovered from the 'Pre-Tecovas Horizon' in the Dockum Group. It was first named by Case in 1929 and the type species is Brachysuchus megalodon. Its closest relative was Angistorhinus. However, its rostral crest was much smaller than that of Angistorhinus, and the rostrum as a whole is shorter and thicker.  Features  The lower jaws of Brachysuchus are expanded at the tip to form a large bulge, holding the creature's largest tusks. The surface of this part of the bone has a wrinkled look, with many blood vessels running through it. In the lower jaw, there are three tusks in each side of this protuberance. Behind this part the jaws have fused together for a little under half their length before diverging after thirty-one of forty-six post- protuberance teeth. While some of the tusks at the tip are missing, most of the rest of the teeth in the jaw are still present. There are new tusks forming in the sockets, indicating that Brachysuchus regrew teeth all its life. There is a large foramen between the dentary, the angular and the prearticular that passes right through the jaw (visible on the picture). The teeth themselves are asymmetrical in cross-section, with the outer side more convex than the inner side. This asymmetry increases from front to back. They are long and conical, and those from the ninth to twenty-ninth have flutings on the sides. From the thirtieth to the forty-ninth, they have no flutings but are crenulated and broaden antero-posteriorly. This suggests that these teeth were better for slicing prey than the previous tusks and conical teeth, which would have impaled and injured it. In parts of the jaws the fused section in the middle rises so high that the teeth could only grip prey and could probably have done little damage. The prearticular is fused with the articular. The skull is around 125 cm long, with a distinctive hooked tip. It is much shorter and broader than that of many phytosaurs such as Leptosuchus or Angistorhinus. The eye sockets are narrow and long, and the fenestrae are smaller and less rounded than Angistorhinus. It has a comparatively small rostral crest. There are several rough surfaces at the posterior end denoting probable muscle attachments, which show that it had very powerful jaw muscles and a strong bite. Overall Brachysuchus was approximately eight metres long, much bigger than most contemporary phytosaurs. It had extremely heavy jaws and a relatively short fused region, giving it a wider bite. There is also evidence of heavily developed jaw muscles. This, as well as the cutting teeth mentioned earlier, indicates that Brachysuchus preyed on different animals to its thinner-jawed relatives. Instead of using its jaws to catch fish, it was able to attack and feed off the heavily armoured stegocephalians that roamed the surrounding area, and would probably have eaten other phytosaurs if food was scarce. The slightly deformed tip of one specimen's lower jaw suggests that it used a lot of force to break through its prey's armour.

Fusion tables can be used for gathering, visualising and sharing data tables. Data are stored in multiple tables that Internet users can view and download. The web service provided means for visualizing data with pie charts, bar charts, lineplots, scatterplots, timelines, network graphs, HTML-formatted card-layouts, and geographical maps. Data are exported in a comma-separated values file format. Visualizations could be embedded in other websites, and updated realtime as data in the table changed. From the Fusion Tables website: > Google Fusion Tables is a service for data management, integration and > collaboration. You can easily upload data sets from CSV, KML and > spreadsheets, and visualize the data using a variety of tools. Users can > merge data from multiple tables and conduct detailed discussions about the > data (on rows, columns and even cells). You can easily visualize large data > sets on Google Maps and embed visualizations on other web pages. Developers > can use our API to build applications over Fusion Tables. Google closed Fusion Tables on December 3, 2019.  Features  Fusion Tables accepted a data file structured as a simple database table, typically a .csv but also other delimiters. It also imported KML, reading each KML placemark or geospatial object into its own row. Fusion Tables files were private, unlisted or public, as specified by the user and followed the convention established by other Google Docs apps. Files were then listed and searchable in the user's Google Drive. The size of uploaded data set was limited to 250 MB per file with a total limit of 1 GB per user. An API allowed data to be ingested automatically. Visualizations were also embeddable into other web pages to support static or live-updating data within publications. = Structured Data Search, Publication and Reuse =  search  The 'New file' flow also supported searching on existing published tables, encouraging people to reuse and build on existing data before creating new data or making a new copy of the same data. The 'live update' nature of a re-used table could be an advantage to the user where data sets might be receive corrections or be regularly updated.  'fusion'  The 'fusion' in the name Fusion Tables came from the ability to create a 'file' that is really just a view on a join of two or more other files. For example, to publish a map about election results in Illinois, one could upload a table with election results, and then create another file that joins this table with a KML of US electoral districts. Because it was a virtual join rather than a copy, changes to either of the base tables would be reflected in the joined table. The join would extract the districts relevant to the Illinois elections, and the result would be easy to put on a map and embed in a news article or other website. Columns from different tables were displayed with a different background color, to help keep track. Multiple tables could be joined using the same key column. Edits to the data needed to happen to the original underlying table, not in the joined table.  reuse  Fusion Tables encouraged read-only reuse of publicly published data sets, or other data sets shared with the user. Although the user could not edit the read-only data set, the user could create visualizations and filtered views on the data in new tabs in the UI. These views would not affect the original file for the file owner or anyone else, but would appear whenever the user who created them opened the file. These tabs were indicated with a dotted line outline.  editing  The UI supported adding rows and editing data, which was also possible programmatically through the Fusion Tables API. = Data Visualizations = During import, Fusion Tables automatically detected various data types in the data, and generated a few appropriate visualizations. All tables saw a row view and a card view; those with many types of location data saw a map visualization automatically created as well. Data types supported within the table view included standard strings, numbers but also images and KML.  Maps  Types of location data automatically detected included: latitude/longitude information in one or two columns, KML place descriptions, and some types of placenames, and addresses, which were sent to the Google Maps Geocoding API in order to put them on the map. The results of geocoding were not available in the table; only on the map. Fusion Tables was tightly integrated with the Google Maps geocoding service, as well as the Google Maps API, which supported an experimental FusionTablesLayer. Fusion Tables supported KML descriptions of geographic points, lines and polygons as a datatype within the tables. By providing a way to ingest, manage, merge and style larger quantities of data, Fusion Tables facilitated a blossoming of geographic story-telling. Many data journalists used these features to visualize information acquired through a Freedom of Information Act request as part of their published news stories.  Card View  An HTML subset templating language supported customizable card layout and map infowindows displaying static and data field content. Incorporating a call to the Google Chart API could dynamically render a chart based on the data within a single row in the card or infowindow.  Other visualizations  Table view (rows & columns), standard pie charts, scatter plots and line graphs, timeline, chloropleth map, network graph, and motion chart. = Filtering = Simple filtering tools provided automatic summaries of values in data columns, and allowed the visualized data to be filtered with checkboxes. = Publishing and Customizing = By supporting simple queries, embeddable HTML snippets for visualizations, and a simple HTML templating language for customizing layouts, Fusion Tables straddled the point-n-click world and the production software engineering world with a 'scriptable' functionality that allowed many data owners with limited software development time or expertise to develop highly custom, expressive websites and tools with their data. See examples. Maps created in Fusion Tables could be exported to KML and viewed in Google Earth, making Fusion Tables an important authoring tool for many of the non-profits and NGOs working closely with Google Earth Outreach to spread information about their work.  History & Impact  Fusion Tables was inspired by the challenges of managing scientific data collections in multi-organization collaborations, such as the DNA barcoding collaboration between University of Pennsylvania ecologist Dan Janzen, the International Barcode of Life, and the University of Guelph. The website launched as part of Google Labs in June 2009, announced by Alon Halevy and Rebecca Shapley. The service was further described in a scientific paper in 2010. = Maps Visualization = Following positive feedback about Fusion Tables' integration with the Intensity map in the Google Visualization API, the team worked closely with the Google Maps team to add support in Feb 2010 for KML point, line and polygon objects as a native datatype in the tables, visualized on top of Google Maps' basemap. Additionally, some smarts were applied to detect data columns that described locations (like addresses) and to send them to Google's Geocoding service so they could be rendered on the map. Shortly thereafter in May 2010, the FusionTablesLayer was offered as an experimental feature of the Google Maps API. The integration of Fusion Tables with Google Maps through the FusionTablesLayer was Google's first foray into server-side rendering of users' data onto Google Maps tiles. Prior to the FusionTablesLayer, map pins were rendered on top of basemap tiles in the browser client. By creating many objects for the client to track, this could make maps slow, and effectively limited Google Maps to showing approximately 200 user data points. The FusionTablesLayer demonstrated fast, server-side rendering of large and complex user data onto the Google Maps base map. The Fusion Tables SQL API supported sending filter queries to the FusionTablesLayer to dynamically adjust the data shown on the map. These maps could be embedded in another webpage with a simple snippet of HTML code. The open-sourced FusionTablesLayer Wizard point-n-click tool helped people create the snippets, and later the snippet was also available easily in the Fusion Tables UI. In May 2011, Fusion Tables added the ability to style (change the color or visual presentation of) data on the map, as well as default and simple HTML customizable infobubbles (shown when an item on the map is clicked) through both the web app and the APIs. Fusion Tables offered a readily accessible solution for working with data on a map that previously required clunky and expensive desktop software. It met many simple GIS use cases. Fusion Tables was presented as part of the Geo track at Google IO in May 2011: Managing and Visualizing your geospatial data with Fusion Tables. = Adoption = In October 2010, FusionTables demonstrated reliability under heavy traffic spikes when hosting the map visualization of the Iraqi War Deaths data set embedded in a news article from The Guardian. Shortly after the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan, crisis responders used Fusion Tables to reflect road status and shelters with close-to-realtime updates. Google's Crisis Response team continued to use Fusion Tables as a key tool for creating and updating relevant maps after a crisis. In the 2011, as Google Labs was closed, Fusion Tables 'graduated' into the list of default features in Google Docs, under the title \\"Tables (beta)\\". In April 2012, Fusion Tables created its own 'labs' track with several experimental features, including a new version of the user interface, a network graph visualization, and a preview of the revised Fusion Tables API, which officially launched in June 2012. Merging tables continued to be a key, if difficult to discover, part of Fusion Tables. Merging tables was, for example, a great way to use publicly available authoritative KML boundaries for places many people might have data about, such as counties or electoral districts. In August 2012, Fusion Tables launched integration with Table Search, another Google Research project from Alon Halevy. = Presentations & Trainings = Fusion Tables was described in talks at the NICAR conference in 2011 and 2013.

Example: A stone thrown into the air at an angle. Curvilinear motion describes the motion of a moving particle that conforms to a known or fixed curve. The study of such motion involves the use of two co-ordinate systems, the first being planar motion and the latter being cylindrical motion.  Planar motion  In planar motion, the velocity and acceleration components of the particle are always tangential and normal to the fixed curve. The velocity is always tangential to the curve and the acceleration can be broken up into both a tangential and normal component.  Cylindrical components  With cylindrical co-ordinates which are described as √Æ and j, the motion is best described in polar form with components that resemble polar vectors. As with planar motion, the velocity is always tangential to the curve, but in this form acceleration consist of different intermediate components that can now run along the radius and its normal vector. This type of co-ordinate system is best used when the motion is restricted to the plane upon which it travels.

The name is derived from the Greek , referring to the disc-shaped sporangia (spore-forming organs). The genus was first described by Hao in 1989 based on fossil specimens from the Posongchong Formation, Wenshan district, Yunnan, China. Description The leafless sporophyte of D. longistipa consisted of creeping stems (axes) up to in diameter with many K- or H-shaped branches as well as upturned or trailing stems, slightly smaller in diameter, which also branched. All stems had irregularly arranged multicellular spines up to long with expanded tips. The stems which did not bear sporangia had coiled (circinnate) tips. Fertile stems bore disc-shaped sporangia laterally on stalks up to 5 mm long, forming open spikes. The sporangia, which were about in diameter, had spines like the stems, and split (dehisced) along their margin to release the trilete spores, which were in diameter. Vascular tissue was present in the stems, with tracheids having annular, spiral thickenings., p. 254 D. longistipa somewhat resembles Sawdonia, but differs in branching pattern and in the arrangement of the sporangia, including their long stalks. Phylogeny The evolutionary relationship between spines in early plants and the small leaves ('lycophylls') of later lycoposids (club-mosses and allies) has been much discussed. Hao considered that the spines of Discalis could be precursors of lycophylls. Boyce regarded the occurrence of the spines of Discalis on sporangia as evidence that they were not related to lycophylls in this way., p. 491 A cladogram published in 2004 by Crane et al. places Discalis in a paraphyletic stem group of broadly defined \\"zosterophylls\\", basal to the lycopsids (living and extinct clubmosses and relatives). Hao and Xue in 2013 used the absence of terminal sporangia to place the genus in the paraphyletic order Gosslingiales, in the family Discaliaceae. The Gosslingiales are considered to be zosterophylls with indeterminate growth and fertile branches generally showing circinate vernation (initially curled up).

Reception In Seven Days has been praised by music critics. Reviewing the United States premiere, Mark Swed of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"Full of the life of our own times yet so rooted in the past that it feels like family, Ades' music operates on so many different parts of the brain at once that it overpowers critical faculties. Brightly bopping scores tickle the pleasure centers. Ingenious counterpoint stimulates the logic-leaning synapses of the left brain. Musical fantasy and illogic mess with the right brain. By this point, who has a enough gray matter left for anything else?\\" He added, \\"In Seven Days occupies a more mature space than the earlier works. But the freshness has not grown stale.\\" Anthony Tommasini of The New York Times called the piece \\"terrific\\" and observed, \\"As the creation saga unfolds, the music is at once reverent and playful. Galumphing basses and low brass evoke the creatures of the land, while twittering flutes and crazed piccolo announce the creatures of the sky. Long episodes evolve in arcs of brilliant piano writing where restless, filigreed, spiraling figures cascade down the keyboard.\\" He added: George Hall of The Guardian opined, \\"Ad√®s possesses the gift of producing striking and immediate ideas that are nevertheless subtly ambiguous in their impact. Here, the Copland-like simplicity of the opening gestures forms a platform for successive processes of variation, development and contrast that eventually return to their starting point.\\" Joshua Kosman of the San Francisco Chronicle called it \\"a vividly evocative musical-visual creation\\" and wrote, \\"Thursday's performance by the San Francisco Symphony [...] came as yet another demonstration of the sheer breadth and grandeur of Ad√®s' creative gift. In Seven Days is both dramatic and reflective, by turns ingratiatingly accessible and dauntingly abstruse. It seems to want to embrace the whole world ‚Äî a fitting goal for the creation story ‚Äî and yet it remains winningly approachable.\\" The music was similarly praised by Andy Gill of The Independent, Ivan Hewett of The Daily Telegraph, and Richard Whitehouse of Gramophone. Conversely, Niels Swinkels of the San Francisco Classical Voice criticized the piece, remarking, \\"Unfortunately, all I heard was one banal idea morphing into the next, vague references to symphonic rock or to movie soundtracks, endless, rippling motion up and down unimaginative scale progressions...\\" He added, \\"It is perfectly possible that Ad√®s's reputation has influenced my expectations too far, and I will certainly explore his music further.

Reaching an expressive plateau, the piece recalls its start via a descent that gives the stratospheric violin-writing a definite harmonic context, before the climactic final section attempts more overt tonal closure.\\" Mark Swed of the Los Angeles Times observed, \\"Like America, this journey begins with another weird swirl  this one, though, more music of the spheres. After a section of vigorous, brash dance music, Tevot settles down into long, calming, Mahlerian peace seeking, awed slow music of haunting beauty.\\" He added, \\"Ades doesn't hold back in his music. When it's raw, it's raw. When it's cooked, it gets four stars.\\" Conversely, Ivan Hewett of The Daily Telegraph was critical of the work, writing, \\"I was staggered and appalled at the piece's unstoppable energy, as pitiless as a lava flow, and waited for the high, still chorale on violins at the piece's core, hoping this time I would be moved by it. But it seemed ice-cold as ever, and the grandeur of the ending a mite Hollywood-ish.

It is located east-northeast of Winnipeg, Manitoba. It was closed in 1986. It was operated as part of the Pinetree Line network controlled by NORAD. History As a result of the Cold War and with the expansion of a North American continental air defence system, The site at Beausejour was selected as a site for a United States Air Force (USAF) radar station, one of the many that would make up the Pinetree Line of Ground- Control Intercept (GCI) radar sites. Construction on the base began in 1952 and was completed late that year. The base was manned by members of the USAF's Air Defense Command (ADC) 916th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron, being known as Beausejour Air Station. In December 1952, operations began at the unit's permanent home. The station was equipped with AN/FPS-3C, AN/FPS-502, AN/FPS-20A; AN/TPS-502, AN/FPS-6B and AN/FPS-507 radars. As a GCI base, the 915th's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. These interceptors were based at Duluth, Minnesota under the 31st Air Division. In the early 1960s, the USAF relinquished control of the base to the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF). This was part of an arrangement with the United States that came as a result of the cancellation of the Avro Arrow. Canada would lease 66 F-101 Voodoo fighters and take over operation of 12 Pinetree radar bases. Upon hand-over on 1 October 1961, the operating unit was re-designated 48 Aircraft Control & Warning Squadron and the base became RCAF Station Beausejour. It was also upgraded with the following radars: * Search Radars: AN/FPS-3C, AN/FPS-502, AN/FPS-20A, AN/FPS-93A * Height Radars: AN/TPS-502, AN/FPS-6B, AN/FPS-507 Radar operations at 48 Squadron were automated on 1 May 1963 by the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, and the station became a long- range radar site. It would no longer guide interceptors but only look for enemy aircraft, feeding data to the Grand Forks Air Defense Sector SAGE DC-11 Direction Center of the 31st NORAD Region. It was later switched to the Duluth Air Defense Sector SAGE DC-10 Direction Center of the 29th NORAD Region. Also that year, the military address was changed to Muskwa. As a result of the unification of the Canadian Forces in 1968, the new Canadian Forces organization absorbed the RCAF, RCN and the Canadian Army. 48 Radar Squadron, RCAF Station Beausejour, became simply Canadian Forces Station (CFS) Beausejour in 1966. This also avoided confusion between the station and the town of the same name. In August 1984, the station became part of Canada West ROCC. In January 1985 the word came out that CFS Beausejour's days were numbered. The last day for this prairie radar sentinel was 31 July 1986. The former station then became the Manitoba Regional Correctional Centre, later renamed the Milner Ridge Correctional Centre. Most of the buildings and radar towers remained, with the former gatehouse converted into a staff lounge when a new gatehouse was built.

The monastery was host to a theological seminary and was the residence of Armenian Catholicos. Khor Virap's notability as a monastery and pilgrimage site is attributed to the fact that Gregory the Illuminator was initially imprisoned here for about 14 years by King Tiridates III of Armenia. Saint Gregory subsequently became the king's religious mentor, and they led the proselytizing activity in the country. In the year 301, Armenia was the first country in the world to be declared a Christian nation.Noble, pp. 176‚Äì A chapel was initially built in 642 at the site of Khor Virap by Nerses III the Builder as a mark of veneration to Saint Gregory. Over the centuries, it was repeatedly rebuilt. In 1662, the larger chapel known as the \\"St. Astvatsatsin\\" (Holy Mother of God) was built around the ruins of the old chapel, the monastery, the refectory and the cells of the monks. Now, regular church services are held in this church. It is one of the most visited pilgrimage sites in Armenia. Etymology The place of imprisonment \\"virap nerk'in\\" came to be known as the Virap or khor (deep), 'virap' meaning the \\"Bottom most pit\\". Geography Fenced border with Turkey. Khor Virap is located on a hillock in Pokr Vedi; the village is from the main highway. Yerevan, the capital and largest city of Armenia, is to the north. It is situated about away from the closed Turkish-Armenian border (sealed by barbed wire fencing) and defended by Russian military establishments that guard the troubled border zone. The monastery is surrounded by green pasture lands and vineyards within the Ararat plain and is in view of Mount Ararat. The Arax (or Arakas) River flows close by, and the monastery is across from Aralƒ±k, Turkey. History King Artashes I, founder of the Artashesid dynasty, established his Armenian capital at Artashat (also known as Artaxtisata) around 180 BC. It is believed that Hannibal, the Carthaginian General who was persecuted by Rome, was also instrumental in establishing Artashat. Artashat remained the capital of the dynasty till the reign of King Khosrov III (330‚Äì339) when it was moved to Dvin. Subsequently, Artashat was destroyed by the Persian King Shapur II. Artashat is close to the hillock of Khor Virap. Until its chapel was built, Khor Virap was used as royal prison. Baptism of Tiridates III by St. Gregory. When King Tiridates III ruled over Armenia, his assistant was the Christian Grigor (Gregory) Lusavorich who preached the Christian religion. However, Tiridates, a follower of pagan religion, was not pleased with having an advisor with a different religion, and he subjected Gregory to severe torture. When news reached the king that Gregory's father Anak the Parthian was responsible for the murder of the king's father, the king ordered that Gregory's hands and legs be tied and that he be thrown into the Khor Virap to die in the dark dungeon located in Artashat. In addition, Gregory's refusal to offer sacrifice to the goddess Anahita provoked the king to torture him and condemn him to imprisonment in the Khor Virap. He was then forgotten and the King waged wars and persecution among Christian minorities. However, Gregory did not die during his 13 years of imprisonment. His survival was attributed to a Christian widow from the local town who, under the influence of strange dream vision, regularly fed Gregory by dropping a loaf of freshly baked bread into the pit. During this period, the Roman Emperor Diocletian wanted to marry a beautiful girl, and sent agents to search for the most beautiful woman. They found a girl named Rhipsime in Rome, who was under the tutelage of Abbess Gayane in a Christian nunnery. When Rhipsime heard about the king's marriage proposal, she fled to Armenia to avoid the marriage. A search was launched to locate the girl and punish the people who had helped her escape, and eventually Tiridates located Rhipsime and forcibly brought her to his palace. After unsuccessfully trying to woo her, he ordered that she be dragged into his presence by putting a collar around her neck in hopes to persuade Rhipsime to agree to marry him. However, what ensued was the persecution and murder of Rhipsime, Gaiane and many Christians. Tiridates went mad and is \\"said to have behaved like a wild boar while torments fell on his household and demons possessed the people of the city.\\"Holding2006,p.13 It was then that Tiridates's sister, Khosrovidhukt, had a vision in the night, where an angel told her about the prisoner Gregory in the city of Artashat who could end the torments with the words \\"when he comes he will teach you the remedies for all your ills\\". People did not place much reliance on this vision, as most thought that Gregory had died within days of his being cast into the pit. But Khosrovidhukt had the same dream repeatedly, eventually threatened that if the dream's instructions were not followed, there would be dire consequences. Prince Awtay was deputed to get Gregory from Kirat Virap. He went to the pit and shouted to Gregory, saying \\"Gregory, if you are somewhere down there, come out. The God whom you worship has commanded that you be brought out\\". Gregory was brought out in a miserable state. He was taken to the king, who had gone mad \\"foraging among the pigs at Valarshapar\\", tearing his own skin. Gregory cured the king and brought him back to his senses. Gregory knew of all the atrocities committed, and saw the bodies of the martyrs who were later cremated. The king, accompanied by his court, approached Gregory, seeking forgiveness for all the sins they committed. Henceforth, Gregory started preaching Christianity to the king, his court, and his army. King Tiridates, who had embraced Christianity as his religion following the miraculous cure effected by Gregory's divine intervention, proclaimed Christianity as the state religion of Armenia in 301 AD. Gregory became the Bishop of Caesarea and remained in service of the King until about 314 AD. Another version attributed to Tiridates's conversion to Christianity is that it was a strategic move to create national unity to checkmate the hegemony of Zoroastrian Persians and pagan Rome, and since then, the Christian Church has acted as a strong influence in Armenia.Noble, p. 133  Architecture  Church of the Holy Mother of God (Surb Astvatzatzin) ;Church The Nerses chapel, built in the 7th century around the famous pit, was of white limestone. Though plain in appearance, a monastery was built around a large enclosure that surrounds the ruins of the old chapel. This church, known as the Church of the Holy Mother of God (Surb Astvatzatzin), has a twelve- sided tholobate and dome and is dedicated to S. Astvatsatsin. The altar pulpit is well decorated. Though most Armenian churches have an east‚Äìwest orientation, placing the altar at the east end, St. Gevorg Chapel is oriented northwest‚Äìsoutheast. ;Pit The pit where Gregory was imprisoned is southwest of the main church, underneath St. Gevorg Chapel which is a small basilica replete with a semicircular apse. Of the two pits inside the chapel, Grigor's is the farther one, deep and wide. The pit is approached through two unmarked holes. A small chamber, winding stairway, and a ladder lead to a small enclosure in the pit. To the right of the altar in the dungeon is the main room. A long ladder from here descends to a large cell of fairly good size, which was Grigor Lusavorich's prison cell. The climb down the well is to a depth of . The pit is well lit but the climb down the metal ladder requires sturdy shoes. It is also extremely humid down the pit in the summer months so be cautious and don't bring candles down as this adds to the heat.Noble, p. 166 Grounds and surroundings The monastery and the surrounding vineyards The 17th century church built around the pit is a simple structure surrounding a large courtyard which looks like a fort complex. Archaeological sites were excavated starting in 1970 in the thirteen hills (maximum height ) around Khor Virap and up to the valley of the river. Excavations in hills 1 and 4, and sections of hills 5, 7 and 8 and of the neck of the land between Hills 1 and 2 are in progress. Some archaeological excavations have also been carried out outside the walls of the church at the site of Artashat, the capital of the Tiridat dynasty.Noble, p. 176 In addition to ancient coins and potshards, excavations have unearthed well preserved mud-brick fortifications on the northern slope of the third hill from the northeast. Culture ;Celebration The anniversary of the deliverance of Gregory is also celebrated in the Illuminator's cathedral built in Yerevan. On New Year's Day, light is brought from Khor Virap as a religious celebration. In a recent event, Catholicos Garegin II climbed down the same deep prison pit where the first Catholicos Grigor had passed many agonizing years, and came out of the pit by holding a lighted candle as symbol of the light that illuminated Armenians several centuries ago. As a pilgrimage centre, people visit Khor Virap for baptism or subsequent to a wedding to perform a matagh animal sacrifice.Noble, p. 178 ;Tourism The monastery attracts a very large number of tourists, and there are a number of souvenir kiosks here. Of interest for visitors is the releasing of doves from Khor Virap, with the hope they will fly to Mount Ararat. In the mid-1990s, young volunteers for the Canadian Youth Mission to Armenia, CYMA, helped renovate/restore the cathedral. Notable visitors Early European visitors to Khor Virap included Joseph Pitton de Tournefort (c. 1700), James Bryce (1876), H. F. B. Lynch (1893). Pope Francis also visited the monastery in 2016.

This area is a breeding ground for a great many amphibians, including the endangered Western Leopard Toad, the Arum Lily Frog, the Cape River Frog and the Clicking Stream Frog.

About 50 bird species have been recorded here, though some are no longer seen in the area.

His parents, Varghese Puthupparampil and Accamma Karipaparambil had an ancestral lineage of illustrious people. Their family history starts from Nilakal (Chayal), one of the seven churches founded by the Apostle, St. Thomas. Nilakal was a flourishing trade-centre where merchants from China, Arabia, Palestine, Rome and Greece used to come to purchase the hill produce, the spices, ivory and sandal. St. Thomas preached the gospel and formed the early Christian Community. After staying for a year, he proceeded to Mylapore where he was martyred in 73AD.  The Puthupparampil family  The Puthupparampil family had in its lineage Kathanars (Priests) and Aassans (Teachers) who worked much for the growth of the Church. They were the founding fathers of the formal education in the area. Two of the Aassans were also poets and authors. Most of the family members were engaged in the cultivation. When the families expanded, they moved to other places and built chapels or churches there. The Karipaparambil family ventured into agriculture and politics and their major source of income was rubber plantation. About ten from the family were elected members of Legislative Assembly with the notable being Accamma Cherian. With these noble parental traditions Michael grew up in a vibrant Catholic milieu. His elder brother, Joseph was a teacher in St. Ephrem's English School. His elder sister Veronica joined the sisters of Mary Immaculate in Jabalpur and became the superior of their convent in Nagpur. His younger sister Raechel joined the Carmelites (CSST) and was the Headmistress of their Mt. Carmel High School Kottayam and she merited the National Award for best teachers. Michael had 3 elder sisters other than them. Michael was very active in the schools he studied and he even started the sodality of our Lady in the School and was its leader. After completing his studies he took up teaching in St. Dominic's School Kanjirappally. He was a good reader of books, the life of St. Francis touched him and in this saintly character he found all his ideals realized. He resigned his job in the school and joined the Capuchins in Quilon (Kollam). Michael had his religious vestition on 2 March 1939 with the new name, John Berchmans. His religious profession was on 3 March 1940 and priestly ordination on 30 March 1946 in Amalashram, Trichy, Tamil Nadu. From 1947 to 1951 he was in St. Antony Friary, Kollam. He used to join the Mission Band to preach retreats in the parishes. Being a scholarly reader and practical man, his sermons were alive with thoughts and anecdotes and were much appreciated. His next scene of ministry was in Bharananganam (1952‚Äì1956) where he was sent with a specific mission to start the first Ashram in a Syro-Malabar Rite diocese. He contacted the Bishop, the parish priests and the laity and with their co-operation and support of the Friars, had the Assisi Ashram built. He was appointed and the first Guardian (superior) of the new community. As a guardian, he was a source of inspiration and encouragement to the newly assigned young priests. He was open and eager to listen to their pastoral experiences and offer them positive strokes. He appreciated their individual initiation of the apostolate and once expressed to them his great desire to have a Capuchin Retreat House. When the ecclesiastical Tribunal Court was formed for the Cause of St. Alphorns, he was selected as an official member by the Bishop. His serene approach and ready availability attracted many youths to Ashram Many came to him to get his timely advice or spiritual direction. From 1956 to 1963, he was the Director of the Capuchin students in Kollam. All of them especially the ones from Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu States experience Fr. Berchmans as a bond of unity and affection. His former students who occupied key position in the Order speak and write about his availability, his listening virtue, his encouraging appreciation, his never belittling talk and his sense of humour. He was quick to notice and speak about the good qualities of others and ignore the uncharitable criticism about them. On 13 April 1963, the Indian Capuchins were canonically formed into one Capuchin Province. The Capuchins in India and their superiors in Rome elected Fr. Berchmans, as their best choice to be the First Indian Capuchin Provincial. He moved to shanty Ashram, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, the then headquarters. From there, he travelled to the distant parts of India and abroad to visit the friars and guide the affairs of the Order. His service as a Provincial was so successful that the Friars elected him for a second term from 1966. He sent the first missionaries to Andhra Pradesh to implant the Order there. It grew up into the present Capuchin Vice Province with several mission centres including a Major Seminary affiliated to the University in Rome. He met the foreign Capuchin Bishops in North India and made plans to take over gradually their missions. In view of the formation houses and special services, he sent talented friars abroad for higher studies and some were sent to Indonesia, Ethiopia, and Africa as formatters. In his foresight he appointed Vocation promoters in five States. The immediate result was 125 candidates in the next year. The Province was on a steady growth in his term in office. Considering this rapid growth and expansion of the Province, it was divided in 1972 into 4 autonomous units of administration. Fr. Berchmans remained in Assisi Ashram belonging to the newly named St. Joseph Province. Bishops, priests and religious found him a wise Counsellor. From 1976 to 1980 he was in the Portiuncula Ashram, Kattappana since the climate of the place was conducive to his health. Here too he was sought after by the clergy and the laity for their spiritual needs. With the help of the friars, he opened a good library and a reading room for the people. His gracious availability helped the participants of the Retreats and Seminars conducted there. Sultan Bathery (1981‚Äì1985) was his next field of presence and ministries. The Capuchin candidates trained there found in him a great guide and a noble example. Cyril Mar Basilisk, who became the Archbishop of Trivandrum and the President of CBCI, used to meet him for spiritual guidance. In his words:\\" Fr. Berchmans‚Äôs deep faith, spiritual fervour and religious life inspired us all. His devotion to St. Francis and his preferential love for the poor were evident in his life. I used to seek his spiritual advice and holy prayers. His life style did influence me\\". In 1985 he joined the community in Assisi Ashram, Bharananganam. In spite of his weak health he helped for the local ministries of confession and counselling. A man of prayer, he spent long time in the chapel. The Doctors of nearby I.H.M. Hospital were treating him for his ailments. Due to his chest pains he was admitted on 12 March in 1987 in the Caritas Hospital, Kottayam. He was treated in the I.C.U. for 3 days and was moved to the ward as he was much better. On the 16th morning, his condition worsened. Consciously he received the sacrament of the sick. \\"Jesus my God, my Redeemer\\" was his last words as he slept in the Lord at 10:50 A.M. The body was taken to the Assisi Ashram, Bharananganam. On 17 March 1987, the funeral ceremonies began at 2:30 P.M. The Congregation included a large number of clergy, nuns and laity. Jacob Acharuparambil, Bishop of Trivandrum, a former Capuchin Definitor, spoke during the Holy Mass. He concluded thus \\"Our dearest Father Berchmans, you were always a friend to us. You were in high positions, yet you remained a humble brother to us all. You faced many painful experiences but you never caused pain to us. Each one of us you believed and trusted each one of us received you unique love. We are now bidding tearful farewell...\\" After 8 years, a new Cemetery was built nearer to the Friary Chapel. The remains of the buried in the Old Cemetery were being transferred to the new site. Only few bones remained of the seven deceased friars. The Coffin with the body of Fr. Berchmans was found intact. Br. Jovinus and Fr. Gratian who saw and touched the body were amazed at the incorruptible state of their confrere. The same Coffin was carried to the new place and interned. Devotees light candles there and claim to be receiving favours through his intercessions. Assisi Ashram celebrated the Golden Jubilee of its foundation in 2002. On the occasion, a large painted portrait of Fr. Berchmans was installed the Malayalam book titled \\"Fr. Berchamans the lover of God and Man‚Äô was released. The book describes his life and activities and testimonies from 30 writers who had personal experiences for the saintly Father John Berchmans who was a true lover of God and a humble lover of God‚Äôs people.

Founded in 1842 in Richmond, Virginia the firm now has over more than 60 attorneys and 6 offices in North Carolina & Virginia. They have offices in Richmond, Christiansburg, Fredericksburg, Williamsburg, and McLean in Virginia; and in Durham, North Carolina. History The Sands Anderson PC law firm traces its beginning to the law practice of Alexander Hamilton Sands (1828‚Äì1887). On May 23, 1842, Mr. Sands moved to Richmond, Virginia to work in the law office of his brother William G. Sands, who not only practiced law but was the Clerk of the Superior Court of Law and Chancery of the City of Richmond. On May 8, 1851, Mr. Sands married Ella Virginia Goddin, a daughter of Wellington and Eliza P. Goddin. They had thirteen children, one of whom was also named Alexander H. Sands. Their fourth child, Conway Robinson Sands (1860‚Äì1920) was also a lawyer who maintained an office in the Travellers Building and served as a Virginia Senator from 1883‚Äì1884 and 1893-1898. According to the Richmond Directory of 1860, Mr. Sands was a partner of John Howard in the Richmond law firm of Howard and Sands with offices in the Goddin building (owned by his father-in-law). In the early 1880s, Mr. Sands practiced law with his son Conway in a firm known as Sands & Sands, and he continued the practice of law up until shortly before his death on December 22, 1887. In the early twentieth century, Mr. Sands' son Alexander began practicing law with his brother Conway in a firm known as Sands & Sands. After Conway stopped practicing, Alex Sands formed the firm of Sands and Lightfoot, which later became Sands, Williams and Lightfoot. At one point, he served as Commonwealth's Attorney of the City of Richmond, in addition to conducting his private practice, and he worked as a criminal defense lawyer after he resigned as Commonwealth's Attorney. When Alex Sands' son, also Alexander H. Sands, graduated from law school in the 1930s he joined his father's practice, forming the firm of Sands & Sands. When the younger Sands joined the Navy at the beginning of World War II, Edward A. Marks, Jr. left Christian and Barton to join the elder Sands. When the younger Sands returned from the War, the firm of Sands, Marks & Sands was formed. That firm grew and became Sands, Marks, Sands, Henning & Sydnor. In 1960, the younger Mr. Sands was appointed to the bench of the Law and Equity Court of the City of Richmond, and A. Scott Anderson and J. Calvitt Clarke, Jr. left Bowles, Anderson, Boyd, Clarke & Herrod. Eventually Messrs. Anderson and Clarke joined Mr. Marks and the elder Sands to form Sands, Anderson, Marks & Clarke, whose offices were initially in the American Building. In June 1962, Frank B. Miller, III joined Sands, Anderson, Marks & Clarke as an associate. In 1967 the elder Sands, who practiced law into his 90s, died. Also in 1967, the firm moved its offices to the Fidelity Building (now One Capitol Square) at Ninth and Main Streets. Cal Clarke went on the federal bench in Norfolk on January 1, 1975, and the firm became Sands, Anderson & Marks for a short while before becoming Sands, Anderson, Marks & Miller.

History This method of classical (non-mechanical) abseiling was developed by South African mountaineering instructor/guide, Andrew Friedemann in 2000 whilst facilitating a Mountain Leader course in Mooi River - South Africa. The classical abseil taught on the course was deemed to be too onerous and an alternate was investigated with a group of students which would remove the issues of rope burn, lack of sufficient control and toppling over backwards which is a common problem with the standard classical abseil. Later on that same year, the method was demonstrated to the UIAA International Training Standards Working group seminar in Chamonix - France, and was dubbed the South African Abseil by those representatives present as none of the countries taking part had seen the method before. Method of wrapping the rope for the Classical Abseil Application All forms of classical abseiling are generally for emergency use only. Modern abseil equipment and techniques have largely made the classical abseil obsolete, however where the right mechanical equipment is not available and a descent of steep terrain by rope is necessary, such as in an emergency situation, the classical methods are still used with caution. Walking parties are generally now the most common users of classical abseils when negotiating steep terrain, as they do not normally carry mechanical devices but often do carry rope. Classical abseils work by wrapping a rope around the body to create friction allowing the abseiler to descend in a controlled manner. Once the abseiler reaches the ground, the doubled rope is retrieved by pulling down on one side allowing the rope to slip around the anchor. =Advantages of the South Africa Abseil= Friction is generated over a larger surface area so it is less painful and has more control. * The ropes run around and cross over the back just below the armpits so supporting the abseiler upright and there is less tendency to topple over backwards. * One hand can be left completely free unlike the classical abseil where both hands must be used to prevent toppling backwards.

Roger's seat, Bredwardine Castle, is estimated to have been a strong and formidable fortress, located on the banks of the Wye river in Herefordshire, two miles north of Moccas Court. Bredwardine Castle is thought to have furnished much of the material for the building of Moccas Court. Lineage The 15th century Vaughan family, gentry of Bredwardine, Tretower and Hergest, were prominent in eastern Wales and the Herefordshire borderland. * According to later pedigrees, an English soldier named Walter Sais, settled near Tretower, moved to Bredwardine after marrying Sir Walter Bredwardine's daughter named Florence. * An elder son, Roger Hen (the elder) (also known as Rhoger Fawr, Roger the Great), married a daughter of Sir Walter Devereux of Weobley * Their son, Roger Vaughan, is the subject of this article. The Vaughans' pedigree often traces descent through Walter Sais (also Seys) to Moreiddig Warwyn. While the Vaughan coat of arms, three boys‚Äô heads with a snake entwined about their necks, originated with Moreiddig Warwyn, Vaughan family ancestry cannot be relied upon with confidence prior to the mid 14th century. Marriage Vaughan married Gwladys ferch Dafydd Gam, daughter of Dafydd Gam, with whom he later fought in the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. =Issue= In contrast to Gwladys and Roger's allegiance to the House of Lancaster, their three sons were staunch Yorkists during the Wars of the Roses. The brothers would fight with their Herbert half-brothers during the Battle of Edgecote Moor in 1469. Beyond their political pursuits, the Bredwardine and Hergest Vaughans supported Welsh poets. They took residence at the main Vaughan holdings of Bredwardine, Hergest, and Tretower, respectively. Tretower Court. A 15th century manor house, rebuilt close to Tretower Castle by Sir Roger Vaughan. * Watkin (Walter) Vaughan (d. 1456) of Bredwardine, Esquire, married Elinor, daughter of Sir Henry Wogan, On Easter 1456, Watkin was murdered at home, Bredwardine Castle for which half-brother William Herbert and Walter Devereux forcibly ensured prosecution of execution of the culprits at Hereford. * Thomas Vaughan (c.1400‚Äì1469) of Hergest, Esquire, married Ellen Gethin, daughter of Cadwgan ap Dafydd. From the mid-1440s, Thomas had interests in the Stafford lordships of Huntington, Brecon and Hay. September 1461, supporting the three Vaughan brother's allegiance to Yorkist rule, Edward IV appointed Thomas receiver of Brecon, Hay, and Huntington during the minority of Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham. In 1469, Thomas died at the Battle of Edgecote and was entombed at St Mary's Church, Kington, near Hergest. * Sir Roger Vaughan (d. 1471) of Tretower Court married twice. Once to Denise, daughter of Thomas ap Philip Vychan, of Talgarth and secondly to Lady Margaret, daughter of Lord James Audley, another of the heroes of Agincourt. Roger fought with his father and grandfather at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415. Roger was knighted for his activities supporting the Yorkist regime. In May 1471 Roger was captured by Jasper Tudor and beheaded at Chepstow. * Elizabeth Vaughan married gentleman Morgan ap Jenkin. * Blanch Vaughan married wealthy Englishman John Milwater, commissioned by Edward IV to accompany Blanch's half-brother, William Herbert, to the siege of Harlech Castle. There are other children attributed to this union: John Vaughan of Dursley, William Vaughan of Clifford and three more daughters not specifically identified. Battle of Agincourt Battle of Agincourt Roger, his father-in- law Dafydd Gam and his recently married son, Roger, had been part of the Welsh contingent that fought with Henry V of England, popularly designated Harry of Monmouth, at the Battle of Agincourt on 25 October 1415. Henry's forces faced formidable odds: illness and impediments in the form of destroyed bridges, well-guarded river crossings, fortification and greatly hindered access to cattle as a means of food by the French. Henry's extremely loyal troops pushed on in spite of illness, starvation and fatigue. Upon hearing that his army would be outnumbered, Henry sent Roger's father-in-law Dafydd Gam to observe the size and motion of the French troops. Observing that they would be significantly outnumbered, and not wanting to daunt Henry or his kinmen, Dafydd's response upon his return was that there were \\"enough to be killed, enough to be taken prisoners and enough to be run away.\\" Sixteen French knights who had taken a solemn oath to do what was necessary to seize Henry V, succeeding in unhorsing the king, who risked certain death at the hands of the knights. Dayfdd called to his Brecon kinsmen, including both Roger Vaughans, William ap Thomas and William Lloyd. They managed to bring down each of the sixteen knights. Henry V's valiant fight and his own exposure to danger in order to protect his injured brother, Humphrey of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Gloucester, inspired and emboldened the English who met the French forces decidedly, killing or capturing their leaders, resulting in confusion and flight. While Henry V would meet with success in this battle, Dafydd, the elder Roger Vaughan and William Lloyd were mortally wounded. Legends appeared in the 16th century claiming that upon saving the life of Henry V at the expense of their own lives, both men were knighted by the king on the battlefield before they died. However, there is no contemporary validation that the legends are true.

The Fotoplayer is a type of player piano specifically developed to provide music and sound effects for silent movies. History Before movies had sound, it was discovered that playing background music during a film could aid in developing a particular mood for a certain scene. Initially, small theatres would use player pianos to produce music automatically from piano rolls. After some time, some of these pianos were extended in size with pipe organs and sound effects inserted into large cabinets connected to the sides of the piano. The user of this new contraption, which became known as the photoplayer, could then create multiple sounds to match the actions on screen. Between 8,000 and 12,000 of these musical instruments were made between 1910 and 1928, with the American Fotoplayer Company's Fotoplayer being one of the most popular brands. When sound films were first created in the late 1920s, the Fotoplayer became unnecessary. The American Fotoplayer Company ceased production of their product in 1925. Of the thousands of American Fotoplayers made, fewer than 50 survive today, and of those only 12 are known to still be playable. Operation The appeal of the Fotoplayer to theatre owners was the fact that it took no major musical skill to operate. The Fotoplayer would play the piano and pipe organ mechanically using an electric motor, an air pump, and piano rolls while the user of the Fotoplayer would follow the onscreen action while pulling cords, pushing buttons, and pressing pedals to produce relatable sounds to what was occurring onscreen. These actions could create sounds such as a steamboat whistle, a bird chirp, wind, thunder, a telephone bell, as well as many others. On Fotoplayers specifically, most effects were created using leather cords, with wooden handles on the ends, directly connected to the effects. For example, the steamboat whistle sound effect was created using a household bellows with a whistle at the end. Pulling the cord compressed the bellows, delivering a gust of air into the whistle. Creating a drum roll on the other hand was a bit more complicated. A clockwork device was needed to time the strikes of the drum which required constant winding.

Biography  Colin was born in Paris in 1798. He was a pupil of Girodet and close friend of Eug√®ne Delacroix, Achille Dev√©ria, and others. He and Delacroix shared a studio during the 1820s and even lithographed each other‚Äôs works. His religious and historical paintings are characterised by a style based on a careful study of the old masters, while his genre pieces are vigorous and lifelike. Among the latter may be noticed his French Fish-Market (1832) in the Alte Nationalgalerie in Berlin, and his Gipsies Resting. Among the former may be named Christopher Columbus, Flight into Egypt, and Assumption of the Virgin. He also illustrated scenes for literary works, such as Shakespeare's Othello and Macbeth. Colin had four children with two wives: Ana√Øs, H√©lo√Øse, Laure, Isabelle, and Paul, all of whom followed in his footsteps as painters. He gradually modified his style during his long career, making it acceptable to salon juries who rejected several early works from the 1820s because of the very painterly qualities we admire today. He died in 1875.

The hill fort is situated approximately east from the village of Brockley. The hill fort is shaped a lot like a \\"D\\", and is approximately 50 metres (160 ft) by 50 metres (160 ft) wide. Background Hill forts developed in the Late Bronze and Early Iron Age, roughly the start of the first millennium BC. The reason for their emergence in Britain, and their purpose, has been a subject of debate. It has been argued that they could have been military sites constructed in response to invasion from continental Europe, sites built by invaders, or a military reaction to social tensions caused by an increasing population and consequent pressure on agriculture. The dominant view since the 1960s has been that the increasing use of iron led to social changes in Britain. Deposits of iron ore were located in different places to the tin and copper ore necessary to make bronze, and as a result trading patterns shifted and the old elites lost their economic and social status. Power passed into the hands of a new group of people. Archaeologist Barry Cunliffe believes that population increase still played a role and has stated \\"[the forts] provided defensive possibilities for the community at those times when the stress [of an increasing population] burst out into open warfare. But I wouldn't see them as having been built because there was a state of war. They would be functional as defensive strongholds when there were tensions and undoubtedly some of them were attacked and destroyed, but this was not the only, or even the most significant, factor in their construction\\".

It is located south-southwest of Prince George, British Columbia. It was closed in 1988. It was operated as part of the Pinetree Line network controlled by NORAD. History As a result of the Cold War and with the expansion of a North American continental air defence system, The site at Baldy Hughes was selected as a site for a United States Air Force (USAF) radar station, one of the many that would make up the Pinetree Line of Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) radar sites. Construction on the base began in 1952 and was completed in 1953. The base was manned by members of the USAF's Air Defense Command (ADC) 918th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron, being known as Baldy Hughes Air Station. In June 1953, operations began at the unit's permanent home. The station was equipped with AN/FPS-3C, AN/FPS-502, AN/FPS-20A; AN/TPS-502, and AN/FPS-6B radars. As a GCI base, the 918th's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. These interceptors were based at the 25th Air Division at McChord Air Force Base in Washington. In the early 1960s, the USAF relinquished control of the base to the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF). This was part of an arrangement with the United States that came as a result of the cancellation of the Avro Arrow. Canada would lease 66 F-101 Voodoo fighters and take over operation of 12 Pinetree radar bases. Upon hand- over on 1 March 1963, the operating unit Became No. 54 Aircraft Control & Warning Squadron and the base became RCAF Station Baldy Hughes. Radar operations at 54 Squadron were automated on 1 June 1966 by the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, and the station became a long-range radar site. It would no longer guide interceptors but only look for enemy aircraft, feeding data to the Seattle Air Defense Sector SAGE DC-12 Direction Center of the 25th NORAD Region at McChord AFB, Washington. Radars at the station were also upgraded to the following equipment: * Search Radars: AN/FPS-3C, AN/FPS-6B * Height Radars: AN/FPS-502, AN/FPS-20A, AN/FPS-27, AN/FPS-26 As a result of the unification of the Canadian Forces in 1968, the new Canadian Forces organization absorbed the RCAF, RCN and the Canadian Army. 48 Radar Squadron, RCAF Station Baldy Hughes, became simply Canadian Forces Station (CFS) Baldy Hughes in 1967. The station began reporting to the Canada West ROCC in 1983. It was closed in 1988. Today the former station is The Baldy Hughes Addiction Treatment Centre.

It provides a graphical notation used for conceptual modeling similar to that of entity-relationship modeling, with extensions for working with temporal data. The modeling technique involves four modeling constructs: the anchor, attribute, tie and knot, each capturing different aspects of the domain being modeled. (Preprint available here) The resulting models can be translated to physical database designs using formalized rules. When such a translation is done the tables in the relational database will mostly be in the sixth normal form. Philosophy and history Anchor modeling was created in order to take advantage of the benefits from a high degree of normalization while avoiding its drawbacks. Advantages such as being able to non-destructively evolve the model, avoid null values, and keep the information free from redundancies are gained. Performance issues due to extra joins are largely avoided thanks to a feature in modern database engines called 'join elimination' or 'table elimination'. In order to handle changes in the information content anchor modeling emulates aspects of a temporal database in the resulting relational database schema. The earliest installations using anchor modeling were made in Sweden with the first dating back to 2004, when a data warehouse for an insurance company was built using the technique. In 2007 the technique was being used in a few data warehouses and one OLTP system, and it was presented internationally by Lars R√∂nnb√§ck at the 2007 Transforming Data with Intelligence] (TDWI) conference in Amsterdam.6th TDWI European Conference - TDWI homepage This stirred enough interest for the technique to warrant a more formal description. Since then research concerning anchor modeling is being done in a collaboration between the creators Olle Regardt and Lars R√∂nnb√§ck and a team at the Department of Computer and Systems Sciences, Stockholm University. The first paper, in which anchor modeling is formalized, was presented at the 28th International Conference on Conceptual Modeling and won the best paper award. A commercial web site provides material on anchor modeling which is free to use under a Creative Commons license. An online modeling tool is also available, which is free to use and is open source. Basic notions Anchor modeling has four basic modeling concepts: anchors, attributes, ties, and knots. Anchors are used to model entities and events, attributes are used to model properties of anchors, ties model the relationships between anchors, and knots are used to model shared properties, such as states. Attributes and ties can be historized when changes in the information they model need to be kept. An example model showing the different graphical symbols for all the concepts can be seen below. The symbols resemble those used in entity‚Äìrelationship modeling, with a couple of extensions. A double outline on an attribute or tie indicates that a history of changes is kept and the knot symbol (an outlined square with rounded edges) is also available. Anchor Modeling Example Temporal aspects Anchor modeling handles two types of informational evolution, structural changes and content changes. Changes to the structure of information is represented through extensions. The high degree of normalization makes it possible to non-destructively add the necessary modeling concepts needed to capture a change, in such a way that every previous schema always remains as a subset of the current schema. Since the existing schema is not touched, this gives the benefit of being able to evolve the database in a highly iterative manner and without causing any downtime. Changes in the content of information is done by emulating similar features of a temporal database in a relational database. In anchor modeling, pieces of information can be tied to points in time or to intervals of time (both open and closed). The time points when events occur are modeled using attributes, e g the birth dates of persons or the time of a purchase. The intervals of time in which a value is valid are captured through the historization of attributes and ties, e g the changes of hair color of a person or the period of time during which a person was married. In a relational database this is achieved by adding a single column, with a data type granular enough to capture the speed of the changes, to the table corresponding to the historized attribute or tie. This adds a slight complexity as more than one row in the table have to be examined in order to know if an interval is closed or not. Points or intervals of time not directly related to the domain being modeled, such as the points of time information entered the database, are handled through the use of metadata in anchor modeling, rather than any of the above-mentioned constructs. If information about such changes to the database needs to be kept bitemporal anchor modeling can be used, where in addition to updates, also delete statements become non- destructive. Relational representation In anchor modeling there is a one- to-one mapping between the symbols used in the conceptual model and tables in the relational database. Every anchor, attribute, tie, and knot have a corresponding table in the database with an unambiguously defined structure. A conceptual model can thereby be translated to a relational database schema using simple automated rules, and vice versa. This is different from many other modeling techniques in which there are complex and sometimes subjective translation steps between the conceptual, logical, and physical levels. Anchor tables contain a single column in which identities are stored. An identity is assumed to be the only property of an entity that is always present and immutable. As identities are rarely available from the domain being modeled, they are instead technically generated, e g from an incrementing number sequence. An example of an anchor for the identities of the nephews of Donald Duck is a set of 1-tuples: \`{‚ü®#42‚ü©, ‚ü®#43‚ü©, ‚ü®#44‚ü©}\` Knots can be thought of as the combination of an anchor and a single attribute. Knot tables contain two columns, one for an identity and one for a value. Due to storing identities and values together, knots cannot be historized. Their usefulness comes from being able to reduce storage requirements and improve performance, since tables referencing knots can store a short value rather than a long string. An example of a knot for genders is a set of 2-tuples: \`{‚ü®#1, 'Male'‚ü©, ‚ü®#2, 'Female'‚ü©}\` Static attribute tables contain two columns, one for the identity of the entity to which the value belongs and one for the actual property value. Historized attribute tables have an extra column for storing the starting point of a time interval. In a knotted attribute table, the value column is an identity that references a knot table. An example of a static attribute for their names is a set of 2-tuples: \`{‚ü®#42, 'Huey'‚ü©, ‚ü®#43, 'Dewey'‚ü©, ‚ü®#44, 'Louie'‚ü©}\` An example of a knotted static attribute for their genders is a set of 2-tuples: \`{‚ü®#42, #1‚ü©, ‚ü®#43, #1‚ü©, ‚ü®#44, #1‚ü©}\` An example of a historized attribute for the (changing) colors of their outfits is a set of 3-tuples: \`{‚ü®#44, 'Orange', 1938-04-15‚ü©, ‚ü®#44, 'Green', 1939-04-28‚ü©, ‚ü®#44, 'Blue', 1940-12-13‚ü©}\` Static tie tables relate two or more anchors to each other, and contain two or more columns for storing the identities. Historized tie tables have an extra column for storing the starting point of a time interval. Knotted tie tables have an additional column for each referenced knot. An example of a static tie for the sibling relationship is a set of 2-tuples: \`{‚ü®#42, #43‚ü©, ‚ü®#42, #44‚ü©, ‚ü®#43, #42‚ü©, ‚ü®#43, #44‚ü©, ‚ü®#44, #42‚ü©, ‚ü®#44, #43‚ü©}\` The resulting tables will all be in sixth normal form except for ties in which not all columns are part of the primary key.

Life Zofia Lissa was born in Lviv and studied piano and music theory at the Polish Music Society in Lviv. She continued her studies in musicology with Adolf Chybi≈Ñski at Jan Kazimierz University in Lvov (1924‚Äì1929), where she also studied philosophy with Kazimierz Twardowski and Roman Ingarden and attended lectures on psychology and art history. In 1929 she received a Ph.D., writing her dissertation on Harmonies of Alexander Scriabin. After completing her studies, she taught music theory at the Lviv Conservatory, Karol Szymanowski's music school and the Fr√©d√©ric Chopin music school in Lviv, and also conducted research on the musicality of children and adolescents at the Institute of Psychology in Lviv. She wrote the first Polish work on film music, Music and Video in 1937. After the annexation of Lviv to the Soviet Union at the outbreak of World War II, she worked in Radio Lviv, and in 1940 served as dean of the faculty in music theory at the Lviv Conservatory. In 1941, after the Nazi attack on the Lwow, she was relocated to Namangan, Uzbekistan, where she worked as a music teacher. In 1943 she was one of the first to join the Union of Polish Patriots. While in Moscow, she organized radio concerts, wrote reviews of Polish music concerts and published song books and sheet music including Songbook of Polish Children in the USSR (1944), a Polish Soldier Songbook (1944) and Songs and Games for the Polish Kindergarten in the USSR (1945). After the war she remained in Moscow, where she was offered the position of cultural attach√© at the Polish embassy. In 1947 Lissa returned to Warsaw and took a position as deputy director of the Department of Music at the Ministry of Culture and the Arts, where she addressed research activities and music culture. In 1947, she received an appointment at the Adam Mickiewicz University in Pozna≈Ñ. In 1948 she organized the Department of Musicology at the University of Warsaw and from 1958-75 served as its director. In 1951 she received the title of associate professor and in 1957 full professor at the university. Under her leadership the Institute was active in sponsoring meetings and conferences, including a Prokofiewowska Session (1959), the first international congress on Chopin (1960) and a session dedicated to the work of Karol Szymanowski (1962). Lissa initiated the organization of the Musica Antiqua Europae Orientalis Festival in Bydgoszcz (1963) and the accompanying international musicological congress, which she chaired. In 1966 with Jerome Feicht, she organized a documentation center and initiated an inventory of early Polish music which resulted in the issue of the series Antiquitates Musicae in Polonia. During her studies, she became involved with left-wing circles and actively participated in the ideological debate on the aesthetics and methodology of Marxist approaches to musicology. She was a board member (1947‚Äì1948) and Vice President (1949‚Äì1954) of the Polish Composers' Union, and through her initiative, the Polish Composers' Union admitted musicologists. She was a member of the presidium of the International Musicological Society (1965‚Äì1977) and in 1955 was a corresponding member of the Academy of Arts, Berlin, in 1963 the S√§chsische Akademie der Wissenschaften in Leipzig, and in 1972 the Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur in Mainz. Her research interests included the history and music theory, history and aesthetics of music, the methodology of history and music theory and history of contemporary Polish music. Her works are in large part testimony to the era in which they were generated, and controversial because methodological approach was based on Marxist ideology. Zofia Lissa introduced a new approach into Polish musicological literature, considering musical styles in their mutual relationships and emphasizing the social functions of music. A bibliography of her work includes nearly 600 items, including several books, dozens of monographs and hundreds of articles, many of which have been translated into foreign languages. She died in Warsaw. Honors and awards For her work, Lissa was honored with the Award of the Polish Composers Union (1950), Order of Polonia Restituta, Knight's Cross (1952), the Second Degree State Prize (1953), Prize from the Committee for Radio and Television (1966), Silver Medal at the Venice Biennale (1969), Award of the Ministry of Higher Education (1965 and 1977), Grade II (1971 and 1976) and the International Music Council Award (1979).

It is close to Matthiessen State Park and adjacent to Starved Rock State Park. History Remains found on Plum Island date to around 2000 BC. The large number of human remains of the island have led to it being called \\"Massacre Island\\"; another former name is Wooded Island. In 1950, the park acquired a state charter to use the island as an airstrip known as Starved Rock Airpark. A cable car shuttled visitors from the park to the island, where they could go on a plane ride for a fee. Severe flooding destroyed the cable car infrastructure in 1970. Plane rides stopped being offered in 1975, with the airstrip finally closing just before 1980. When purchased in 2002, it had been slated by developers for development of fifty high-priced homes, and fully half of the island would have been bulldozed, destroying both bald eagle habitat and Native American burial sites.http://www.illinois.gov/PressReleases/ShowPressRelease.cfm?SubjectID=1&RecNum;=2875 Victory Rally to celebrate saving Plum Island from developers March 28, 2004 access date 2011-02-12 Audubon Society and its supporters successfully prevented Plum Island from being developed into a resort area and upscale condominiums.

Governor (later Governor) Pat Quinn. Funds to purchase the island were provided by a grant from the Illinois Clean Energy Community Foundation. The Trust For Public Land also assisted with the purchase by negotiating with the developers and other legal aspects. After acquiring the island, the Illinois Audubon Society gained the support of Living Lands and Waters, a river cleanup group led by Chad Pregracke.

ATO is an element of Search engine optimization, where the subject is discussed in greater detail. According to Search Engine Journal, ‚ÄúAdWords text ads are small and in some ways unassuming ‚Äì when you think about testing landing pages it‚Äôs obvious that there are elements that could make a big impact, but it‚Äôs sometimes less intuitive that ad text tests can and often do have an equally big impact on results.Search Engine Journal - Ad Text Optimization ‚Äì What to Test (and When)? Dec 2010‚Äù Work method PPC Ads are triggered to appear on search engine pages when Users search with keywords which match those selected by the PPC Advertiser. When PPC Ads are clicked on they take the User through to a designated page on the advertiser‚Äôs website and a fee is paid to the search engine for the click. At the heart of Ad Text Optimization (ATO) lies a specialist type of direct response copywriting which can be augmented by an Ad Text Optimization (ATO) algorithm that measures the response effectiveness of Ad Text copy. For Users the benefit of ATO is to make PPC Ads more relevant to their searches. For advertisers ATO is delivers more clicks, leading to more sales and increased Return On Investment (ROI), and search engines benefit by offering their user customers more efficient search experiences. ATO and Quality Score Many search engines, Google being the most notable example, reward more efficient PPC ads with higher Quality Scores, which are measured by higher CTRs. The higher the Quality Score of a PPC ad the lower the bid price the advertiser has to pay each time a User clicks on the relevant Keywords that triggers the PPC ad appearing. Higher Quality Scores combined with your CPC bid equals high Ad Rank (Ad Rank = CPC Bid * Quality Score), which result in PPC ads appearing higher up in the Users search results. ATO can play a key role in increasing a PPC ad‚Äôs Quality Score, and Google publishes its overview of ATO on its elearning centre, saying that ‚Äúad text plays a crucial role in determining the success of your AdWords advertising.Google eLearning Centre 2011‚Äù ATO and SEO ATO in PPC advertising is viewed by many in marketing as the equivalent of SEO (Search Engine Optimization) for natural search in that they both improve the visibility of websites. ATO and Advertising Recently in the UK, PPC Ads have come under the scrutiny of the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). This has been commentated on by many in the marketing and advertising fraternity as evidence that PPC Ads now constitute an established part of the marketing mix. According to the UK‚Äôs Internet Advertising Bureau (IAB), search is now a significant advertising medium in its own right with the paid search market worth almost ¬£2.15 billion in 2009 representing 60.7% of online advertising spend in the UK.Internet Advertising Bureau - Internet marketing news 2009 PPC Ads make up the lion‚Äôs share of this market and some argue that its future growth will in part be fuelled by ATO becoming an ever more integral part of the writing of PPC Ads.

It contains eleven Vic Chesnutt covers. It is Volume Two of the Nomad Series.  Album development  Vic Chesnutt died at age 45 on December 25, 2009, and Demons is the Junkies tribute album to him. The band had previously shown their respect for Chesnutt by including him in their twentieth anniversary celebration of The Trinity Session when they redid the album as Trinity Revisited, which included Chesnutt as one of the musicians, including taking the lead on one song, \\"Postcard Blues\\". He had also previously toured with the Cowboy Junkies several times, starting with the tour supporting Lay It Down. Michael Timmins stated about this album \\"One of the hopes of this album is that it inspires people to seek out the originals and keep his music alive. We had intended to do an album where he would write the songs, and we would be the band. Now we're trying to fulfill a bit of that desire.\\" Chesnutt and the Junkies were planning on doing a collaborative album together, but Chesnutt died shortly before they could start recording. The Junkies then mined his previous work to showcase Chesnutt's personal demons that he laid out in his very honest song writing. The album may also be exorcising some of the Cowboy Junkies' demons as well. The Junkies turn an album born out of the death of their friend into an assertion of life. According to Michael Timmins, they approached the recording of the album with the same spirit that they felt Vic Chesnutt approached his. They let accidents happen, investing the \\"songs with the same spirit and the adventure with which they were written, at the same time investing them with our own Northern spin\\". Fifteen years earlier, the band had tried to cover one of Chestnutt's song, \\"West of Rome\\", but scrapped the project when they could not capture the sound they needed to give the song what it required. After Chestnutt's death, in the middle of their Nomad project, the Junkies were kicking around ideas of cover songs, and it occurred to them that Chestnutt was who they wanted to cover. The band did not want to just recreate Chestnutt's songs, but bring something to them. Margo got deep into the songs and figured out how to represent Chestnutt's voice. Michael Timmins believes that having fifteen more years to mature and gain insight allowed the band to grasp Chestnutt's work.

The company was notable for staging the first performance of Vivienne Westwood's Active Resistance to Propaganda manifesto at the Bloomsbury Ballroom on Friday 4 December 2009. The performance starred Vivienne Westwood and Michelle Ryan. As the company was based above the nightclub and Russian restaurant at 91 Jermyn Street, both owned by David West, the company was named in online conspiracy theories related to the poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko. This escalated following the unlawful killing of David West although the two incidents were found to be unconnected. In 2010 Forbidden London organised Raef Bjayou's 007 party for UK TV show Party Wars at Amika nightclub in High Street Kensington. Raef came second in the show. In 2011 Forbidden London was nominated for Best Entertainment by Spear's for their Design for Living Awards 2011. In August 2011 Forbidden London announced 1000 job opportunities for young people in London. On 23 October 2017, the 60th anniversary of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, it was announced on the Forbidden London Facebook page that the brand would relaunch.

Freshly slaughtered animals are on the left, day-old animals on the right. Meat hanging is the culinary process of dry- aging meat to develop its flavor and tenderness. It is applied both to beef and to game. Hanging game Traditionally, game meat was hung until \\"high\\" or \\"gamey\\", that is, approaching a state of decomposition.Oxford English Dictionary, 3rd edition, s.v. high adj. A.II.12d, gamey 1a Dry-aging beef For dry-aged beef, the meat is hung in a room kept between 33-37 degrees Fahrenheit (1-3 degrees Celsius), with relative humidity of around 85%. If the room is too hot, the meat will spoil, and if it is too cold, the meat freezes and dry aging stops. Good ventilation prevents bacteria from developing on the meat. The meat is checked on regularly. Meat hanging allows processes to continue in the meat that would normally cease in dead animals. For example, the muscles in the meat continue to use the hemoglobin that is stored in the soft tissue of the animal. This normal biological process creates lactic acid. Contrary to popular belief, animals are not completely derived of bodily fluid during slaughter as soft tissue retains some amount of fluid. This can be well observed by cooking a steak and observing \\"blood\\" on the plate. Since the blood is no longer being circulated through the body, the lactic acid starts to break down the muscle and connective tissues around it. The process takes at a minimum eleven days. The longer the meat is hung, the better the flavor will be, but also the higher the chance that the meat will spoil. Most companies limit hanging to 20-30 days. Up to 10-15% of the water content may evaporate. As the meat ages, its color goes from red to purple, and the texture becomes firmer. =Popularity= In the 1960s, the cheaper wet-aging process largely displaced dry aging as the meat is 15-25% more expensive than wet-aged beef: dry hanging rooms are expensive; meat weight is reduced through evaporation; and some proportion of meat spoils. Dry aging became more popular in the 1980s, and dry aged beef continues to be sold in high-end restaurants around the world.

Figures shown in the spending request do not reflect the actual appropriations for Fiscal Year 2012, which must be authorized by the Legislature. Overview The budget crisis of the 2011 Oklahoma state budget caused the Oklahoma State Treasurer's Office to estimate that the 2012 budget would see a $600 million budget shortfall. Following the December 2010 meeting of the Oklahoma State Board of Equalization, the Board certified that the 2012 budget would see a shortfall of $400 million from 2011 levels. Governor of Oklahoma Mary Fallin's proposed budget relies upon a combination of agency budget reductions, increased tax enforcement, agency consolidations, and government modernization to overcome the budget shortfall. Most agencies are budgeted to receive a 5% across the board cuts, but public safety, healthcare, and education will see smaller cuts of only 3%. If the governor's budget plan is realized, the $400 million deficit will result in a $100 million surplus.

A full listing of membership options and benefits is available on the NVFC web site.  Health and Safety  The health and safety of the nation's volunteer fire and emergency service personnel is a top priority for the NVFC. Each year, first responders are killed or injured due to factors that may have been prevented with the proper safety and health precautions. The NVFC promotes and implements initiatives to keep first responders healthy and safe. The NVFC Health and Safety Committee developed the Volunteer Firefighter Health and Safety Priorities in 2009 to guide departments on key issues that will keep members safe and eliminate cases of preventable injury and death. These Priorities are set forth in a series of B.E.S.T. practices divided into four main focus areas: Behavior, Equipment, Standards and Codes, and Training. In 2010, the NVFC was named one of three recipients of the Congressional Fire Services Institute's Paul S. Sarbanes Fire Safety Leadership Award in recognition of its efforts to improve the health and safety of first responders through the development and promotion of the B.E.S.T. practices.Congressional Fire Services Institute. \\"Fire Service Safety Leadership Award to be Presented to Three Organizations\\".

Heart-Healthy Firefighter Program  Heart attack is the leading cause of on-duty firefighter fatalities each year.U.S. Fire Administration. Firefighter Casualty Reports. Accessed February 14, 2011. The NVFC launched the Heart-Healthy Firefighter Program in 2003 to counter this trend by providing tools, resources, and information to keep first responders healthy and better prepared for the rigors of emergency response. The Heart-Healthy Firefighter Program, which is supported by federal grants, is the nation's only heart attack awareness and prevention campaign targeted at all firefighters and emergency services personnel, both volunteer and career. According to the United States Fire Administration's (USFA) report Firefighter Fatalities in the United States in 2009, 90 firefighters died in the line of duty in 2009.U.S. Fire Administration. \\"Firefighter Fatalities in the United States in 2009.\\" Accessed February 14, 2010.

Heart attack continues to be the number one cause of line- of-duty death for firefighters. The Heart-Healthy Firefighter Program works to reduce the number of firefighter deaths from heart-related illnesses, including heart attack and stroke. This is accomplished by promoting a healthier lifestyle and by providing firefighters with the tools and information to become heart-healthy. The Program includes an interactive trade show exhibit with free health screenings, an extensive web site, health and wellness workshops, webinars, an online fitness challenge, a monthly electronic newsletter, the Heart-Healthy Firefighter Resource Guide, the Heart-Healthy Firefighter Cookbook, and other resources and outreach efforts.  National Firefighter Health Week  In order to create awareness of important health issues in the emergency services and encourage first responders to take action, the NVFC, through its Heart-Healthy Firefighter Program, launched National Firefighter Health Week in August 2007. National Firefighter Health Week is an annual week-long initiative held the third week in August to educate the fire and emergency services community and the public about heart health as well as a variety of other health and wellness issues that affect first responders.  EMS/Rescue Section  In 2010, the NVFC Board of Directors created an EMS/Rescue Section to better serve the needs of the volunteer emergency medical and rescue services. While the emergency medical and rescue services have always been an integral part of the NVFC's mission and initiatives, the EMS/R Section is intended to provide an even stronger voice to EMS and rescue personnel both within the organization and on a national level. The mission of the EMS/R Section is to provide volunteers in an EMS or rescue delivery system with information, education, services, and representation to enhance their professionalism. The EMS/R Section is made up of NVFC members but has its own leadership elected annually by Section members. The Section can make recommendations to the full NVFC Board of Directors, and the Section Chair sits on the NVFC Executive Committee.  National Junior Firefighter Program  Statistics show that the volunteer fire service is an aging population.National Volunteer Fire Council. \\"Latest U.S. Fire Department Profile Shows Aging Trend in Firefighters Serving Small Communities.\\" Accessed February 14, 2011. In addition, volunteer departments are facing challenges retaining and recruiting members at a time when call volume has more than doubled in the past two decades.National Fire Protection Association. Fire Department Calls. Accessed February 14, 2011. Departments across the country are struggling to attract younger members to join their ranks and ensure the future of the fire service. Junior firefighter programs are a great way for departments to gain the interest of potential first responders while they are young and help build the next generation of fire and emergency service leaders. There are thousands of local junior firefighter programs nationwide. The NVFC's National Junior Firefighter Program provides an umbrella program where departments and youth alike can find the resources, tools, and information they need to help develop, grow, enhance, promote, and participate in these local programs. The goal of the National Junior Firefighter Program is to get more youth involved in the fire and emergency services, thus fostering a lifelong connection with the emergency services where they can continue to serve as first responders or community supporters of the fire service throughout their adulthood. Junior firefighter programs also instill life-enhancing skills and values such as leadership, teamwork, responsibility, and community service in the youth who participate.  Fire Corps  Fire Corps is a federally funded, grassroots effort to connect community members with their local fire/EMS department. Launched in December 2004, Fire Corps is one of five programs under the Department of Homeland Security's Citizen Corps initiative. It is administered on a national level by the NVFC, in partnership with other national fire service organizations that make up the Fire Corps National Advisory Committee. Fire Corps is also supported by the U.S. Fire Administration and is funded through the Department of Homeland Security and Citizen Corps. Fire Corps increases the capacity of volunteer, career, and combination fire and EMS departments by engaging the talents and skills of community volunteers in non-emergency roles such as fire safety and prevention education, administrative tasks, fundraising, public relations, vehicle and equipment maintenance, or whatever the department needs. This frees up department members to focus on training and emergency response, as well as increases the services the department can offer. In return, community members gain a better understanding of the fire and emergency services and become better prepared to handle their own emergencies as well as those of their neighbors.  1-800-FIRE-LINE  1-800-FIRE-LINE is a national recruitment campaign that enables community members to call toll- free from anywhere in the country to learn about both local emergency and non- emergency (Fire Corps) volunteer opportunities in the fire and emergency services. The campaign is managed on the national level by the NVFC through Fire Corps. Calls made to 1-800-FIRE-LINE are routed by area code to either the state association in the state from which the person calls or to the Fire Corps national office.

It sits on 742 acres of mountainous lands near Mount Davis, the highest peak in Pennsylvania, and includes 125 acre Deer Valley Lake. Deer Valley operates 10 months out of the year and offers summer camp experience to families and various organizations from all around the country.  History  The land that Deer Valley currently occupies belonged to the family of Howard G. Peck from about the time of the Revolutionary War. In the year of 1931 Curtis Howe \\"Doc\\" Springer came from Florida to open a health resort. He purchased and constructed his resort on the Peck property. The \\"health resort\\" was said to be a place where one could get an abortion, back when it used to be illegal, creating lots of camp folklore. ‚ÄúHaven of Rest‚Äù was a free resort, running solely on donations. Springer was forced to close the resort in 1937 when the cost of construction resulted in money problems. The land was reverted to Howard Peck. Soon after, Captain Colon B. Harris rented the land and the winter resort ‚ÄúSki Trains‚Äù was born. This resort became well known throughout the late 1930s among the neighboring states. But in the year 1938 Harris left to take a job in Washington DC, and due to the poor health of Howard Peck, resulted in the sale of the Deer Valley property to The Independent Order of Odd Fellows (I.O.O.F.). The I.O.O.F had plans to open a vacation spot for families but due to disagreements forfeited the land back to Howard Peck. During this time a group of six men purchased the land. They named the new company ‚ÄúDeer Valley Inc‚Äù and went about constructing a large 125-acre lake on the property. Deer Valley Inc. tried to sell the property to the Boy Scouts but was unsuccessful. The Director of Camping Services for the Pittsburgh YMCA Thomas Reid Alexander was then introduced to the property by his son, Thomas Reid Alexander Jr. On December 30, 1952 the YMCA of Pittsburgh purchased the property and is still the current owner. Thomas Reid Alexander Sr, his Wife Gladys, their children Molly and Thomas ran the camp at Deer Valley, until Thomas Reid Alexander's death in 1966. In 1957 Deer Valley YMCA Family Camp opened for the first season of family camp. This first summer the camp served 838 campers, during an eight-week season. In 1972 the camp underwent construction to winterize the facilities to become a year-round experience and now operates 10 months out of the year.  Campers  Since 1993 the camp has been running at full capacity and has a 93% return rate of campers. The campers range in age with family members of all ages. It is very common for the families who camp at Deer Valley to have deep roots there and some have as much as four generations of family camping tradition!  Staff  The camp is currently directed year round by Dave Riether whose family also lives at Deer Valley year round. The summer staff is generally college-aged adults and the majority of these young adults were campers themselves at Deer Valley growing up. The camp also employs staff from other countries through their international program. They also have a volunteer program available to high school aged students, known as the Rising Leaders Program. Within the program, students going into their junior year of high school can work as SALTs (Service and Leadership Training), and students going into their senior year can work as CLIPpers (Camp Leadership Instructional Program).  Currently  The camp currently has around forty cabins, two shower houses, a program lodge which includes a very popular snackbar and a craftshop, waterfront, campfire circle, dining hall, a horse barn, zip line, high ropes course, an archery and pellets range, a multipurpose hall, and many sports fields and facilities. Families generally camp for seven-day sessions in the summer, as well as Memorial Day weekend. Deer Valley was most recently featured on the news program The Today Show in the summer of 2010.

One of the tales is of the White Lady. On her wedding day way back when, tradition kept it so that the groom could not see the bride until the ceremony. She was making her journey to the church separate, when her carriage got into an awful accident, resulting in her death. Her fianc√© waited at the church, but his bride never showed. This made him depressed beyond belief, and he hung himself in the Peck family rabbit hutch. In that rabbit hutch, they say that the rope would swing back and forth, until it was taken apart. The wood was used in places around camp, heavily within the waterfront, where they say the canoes will all point to the rabbit hutch if taken down at night. To this day, there are reportings of the White Lady proving herself to be a good spirit. For example, a young boy got lost deep in the woods at camp and was found at the top of a tall tree. There was absolutely no possible way that the boy could have gotten up there himself, and when he was brought down he told of a \\"White Lady\\" saving him from a bear. Tom Storm It was a cool Autumn weekend at camp. Deer Valley was hosting a group of Indian Princesses and their dads. Amidst it all, a car slinked into camp. Whoever was in charge at the time went over to the car to investigate. The driver said that he was a bounty hunter, and spoke of an escapee from a local prison by the name of Tom Storm. He told of the fact that Tom Storm was considered dangerous as well as a known child molester. He emphasized that there was no real reason to disturb the whole camp, but that he wanted to check all of the facilities out.

Southern Africa has a transition to semi-tropical or temperate climates (green), and more desert or semi-arid regions, centered on Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa. A map of Africa showing the ecological break around the Sahara Desert The climate of Africa is a range of climates such as the equatorial climate, the tropical wet and dry climate, the tropical monsoon climate, the semi-arid climate (semi-desert and steppe), the desert climate (hyper-arid and arid), and the subtropical highland climate. Temperate climates are rare across the continent except at very high elevations and along the fringes. In fact, the climate of Africa is more variable by rainfall amount than by temperatures, which are consistently high. African deserts are the sunniest and the driest parts of the continent, owing to the prevailing presence of the subtropical ridge with subsiding, hot, dry air masses. Africa holds many heat-related records: the continent has the hottest extended region year-round, the areas with the hottest summer climate, the highest sunshine duration, and more. Owing to Africa's position across equatorial and subtropical latitudes in both the northern and southern hemisphere, several different climate types can be found within it. The continent mainly lies within the intertropical zone between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn, hence its interesting density of humidity. Precipitation intensity is always high, and it is a hot continent. Warm and hot climates prevail all over Africa, but mostly the northern part is marked by aridity and high temperatures. Only the northernmost and the southernmost fringes of the continent have a Mediterranean climate. The equator runs through the middle of Africa, as do the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn, making Africa the most tropical continent. The already hot and dry climate that straddles the equator, makes it the most vulnerable continent to climate change.  Temperatures  Monthly mean and minimum outdoor and indoor temperatures throughout Africa Globally, heating of the earth near the equator leads to large amounts of upward motion and convection along the monsoon trough or Intertropical Convergence Zone. The divergence over the near- equatorial trough leads to air rising and moving away from the equator aloft. As it moves towards the Mid-Latitudes, the air cools and sinks, which leads to subsidence near the 30th parallel of both hemispheres. This circulation is known as the Hadley cell and leads to the formation of the subtropical ridge.Dr. Owen E. Thompson (1996). Hadley Circulation Cell. Channel Video Productions.

Temperatures are hottest within the Sahara regions of Algeria and Mali, and coolest across the south and at elevation within the topography across the eastern and northwest sections of the continent. The hottest average temperature on Earth is at Dallol, Ethiopia, which averages a temperature of throughout the year. The hottest temperature recorded within Africa, which was also the world record, was at 'Aziziya, Libya on September 13, 1922.

The jet exhibits both barotropic and baroclinic instability, which produces synoptic-scale, westward-propagating disturbances in the jet known as African easterly waves, or tropical waves. A small number of mesoscale storm systems embedded in these waves develop into tropical cyclones after they move from west Africa into the tropical Atlantic, mainly during August and September. When the jet lies south of normal during the peak months of the Atlantic hurricane season, tropical cyclone formation is suppressed. Precipitation Mean precipitation map Great parts of North Africa and Southern Africa as well as the whole Horn of Africa mainly have a hot desert climate, or a hot semi-arid climate for the wetter locations. The Sahara Desert in North Africa is the largest hot desert in the world and is one of the hottest, driest and sunniest places on Earth. Located just south of the Sahara is a narrow semi-desert steppe (a semi-arid region) called the Sahel, while Africa's most southern areas contain both savanna plains, and its central portion contains very dense jungle (rainforest) regions. The equatorial region near the Intertropical Convergence Zone is the wettest portion of the continent. Annually, the rain belt across the continent moves northward into Sub-Saharan Africa by August, then passes back southward into south-central Africa by March.

El Nino results in drier-than-normal conditions in Southern Africa from December to February, and wetter-than-normal conditions in equatorial East Africa over the same period. In Madagascar, trade winds bring moisture up the eastern slopes of the island, which is deposited as rainfall, and bring drier downsloped winds to areas south and west, leaving the western sections of the island in a rain shadow. This leads to significantly more rainfall over northeast sections of Madagascar than its southwestern portions. Southern Africa receives most of its rainfall from summer convective storms and with extratropical cyclones moving through the Westerlies. Once a decade, tropical cyclones lead to excessive rainfall across the region.

It is commonly found in northeastern United States and southeastern Canada and elsewhere in North America. This species, that grows about 5 to 15 centimeters in length, is doubted to be fatally toxic. It normally grows between the rainy months of June and August. Taxonomy First described in 1902 by George Francis Atkinson under the name Amanitopsis albocreata, the species was transferred to Amanita in 1941 by Jean-Edouard Gilbert. Description Cap: The lengths of the cap can vary from 2 centimeters to 5 or 8 centimeters. It can appear convex or shield-shaped. The cap's disc has been seen colored white to pale yellow, with easily removed flaky patches or warts of whitish volva remnants. The center can be tan or creamy yellow in color. Akin to its relative Amanita frostiana, the cap feels smooth and sticky when moist. * Gills: Gills can be free or slightly adnate. They are about 3 - 10.5 millimeters broad, with a minutely flocculose edge. The short gills are truncate to excavate-truncate with or without an attenuate \\"tooth\\" at the juncture with the flesh of the cap. They are cream to pale cream in color. * Stem/ Stipe: The stem, or stipe, measures 80 - 120 x 6 - 8 millimeters. It lacks a ring but consists of a volva. The notable bulb (dimensions 15 - 22 x 12 - 20 millimeters) bears a distinct white collar as do some species with annulate stems, like other Amanita species Amanita multisquamosa, Amanita velatipes and Amanita pantherina. * Spores and microscopic features: The spores measure (7.3-) 7.7 - 9.5 (-11.6) x 6.6 - 8.4 (-9.4) ¬µm and are globose to subglobose or occasionally broadly ellipsoid and inamyloid. Clamps are rare at bases of basidia. * Flesh: This mushroom has thin and sticky flesh under the cap. Distribution and habitat  This fungus is found in the hardwood-hemlock (Tsuga) forest of the northeastern U.S.. and southeastern Canada and of boreal forest at least as far north as the Island of Newfoundland. Commonly it is found in coniferous and deciduous forests or open lush green grasslands. Toxicity The species is considered inedible and possibly poisonous.

Unlike Gravity's Rainbow or Against the Day, neither of which numbers the episodes in the book, the episodes in Mason & Dixon correspond to chapters and are numbered consecutively from the beginning of the book. One: Latitudes and Departures =Episode 1= The Reverend Wicks Cherrycoke, at the Philadelphia home of his sister Elizabeth LeSpark, earns his room and board by telling stories to his niece and nephews. The novel opens during the winter of 1786 as the Reverend, by request from his nephews, embarks on his first story set in America, which begins with his recollection of the first meeting of Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon as told to him by the two men. =Episode 2= A brief episode in which respective letters of introduction are exchanged between Mason and Dixon. =Episode 3= In the naval town of Portsmouth, England in 1761, Mason & Dixon meet for the first time. After brief discussions of their respective background, the two retire to an ale house for libations before their departure on the frigate Seahorse to observe the Transit of Venus from Sumatra as ordered by the Royal Society. Over the course of the evening they encounter for the first time the Learned English Dog and Fender-Belly Bodine, a soon-to-be-shipmate on board the Seahorse. Talk is made over the threat of possible French naval aggression against the relatively undersized frigate. =Episode 4= The Reverend recounts the departure of the Seahorse from Portsmouth and its passage through the English Channel. In open sea, off the coast of France, the Seahorse is pursued and attacked by the French warship l'Grand. After a pitched battle, during which Mason and Dixon remain below decks and the Reverend acts as a surgeon's apprentice, the French unexpectedly and inexplicably break off the attack. The Seahorse, with more than thirty casualties and broken masts, limps back to Plymouth for repairs. =Episode 5= Drinking and paranoia dominate an on-shore discussion between Mason and Dixon. At a loss to explain how they survived the attack and why the French broke off the assault on the outgunned Seahorse, the pair consider reasons for the assault, including the possibility that they themselves were the target. They draft a letter to the Royal Society with their concerns and receive a swift, threatening reply reiterating their original orders. =Episode 6= Ordered once more to Bencoolen, despite its being currently occupied by French forces, Mason, Dixon, and the Reverend find themselves aboard the newly repaired Seahorse, now escorted by a second frigate as far as the open sea. During the passage to Tenerife, and eventually the southern latitudes, Mason marks the second anniversary of his wife's death, and the passengers and crew endure shipboard boredom and isolation. =Episode 7= The Seahorse arrives for a stay in Cape Town where Mason and Dixon are greeted by a member of the local constabulary who warns them against spreading political notions amongst the colony's slaves. Taking their meals at the Vroom household, Mason is the reluctant target of advances from the host's beautiful daughters. Their efforts are guided by their mother, who wishes Mason to become so inflamed with desire that he will consent to sex with the slave Austra and impregnate her, producing a fair-skinned offspring for the slave market. Appalled by the notion, Mason struggles to contain himself and begins to see the colony as a hellish nightmare world. Dixon, however, takes a more libertarian view of the colony and the gap between their perceptions leads the two paranoid astronomers to question how they came to be paired together in the first place. =Episode 8= In a short episode occupied with the sensual, the two astronomers began to seek better food from outside the Vroom house. A tour of various cook-tents and cuisines ends in a marketplace meeting with the Reverend Cherrycoke. Clergy not being welcome in the areas to which she sails, the Reverend informs them over freshly picked mangoes that the Seahorse has proceeded east, leaving the men to observe the Transit of Venus from the Cape. =Episode 9= The rainy season begins with a storm lasting three days. With their father Cornelius trapped out of town by the weather, his daughters renew their flirtatious assault on Mason. They pursue him and Dixon to an observatory constructed by the Seahorse crew before their departure. Trapped inside the observatory by another storm, Mason and Dixon offer a short explanation of the reasons for observing the Transit from different areas of the globe. =Episode 10= The opening of the episode returns to Philadelphia where the Reverend, using an orrery, lectures on the Transit of Venus and the solar parallax. In Cape Town, the skies clear long enough for Mason and Dixon to take their observations. A strange lassitude descends on the colony for several weeks after the event but normal routines are soon restored, even as the Vroom daughters find new objects for their attentions. After several months, Mason and Dixon depart Cape Town aboard the Mercury. The Reverend closes the episode by musing whether something other than philosophical or scientific desire drives astronomers worldwide to their observations. =Episode 11= While the Reverend sails on to India, the Mercury makes port at the island of St. Helena, depicted as a surreal and desolate location. During an evening stroll that takes them within viewing distance of the island's gallows, Mason and Dixon encounter the Lady Florinda, with whom Mason had a brief tryst after the death of his wife. A flashback depicts their meeting a year before at the hanging of Lord Ferrers in London before the episode closes with the introduction of Florinda's fiance. =Episode 12= The two astronomers spend time with Nevil Maskelyne, who is on the island to make observations but suffers from faulty equipment. Despite political and personal differences, they belatedly celebrate Maskelyne's twenty-ninth birthday. Dixon is ordered to return alone to Cape Town, while Mason comes to terms with his orders to remain on St. Helena. Two clocks, one having been with Maskelyne during the transit, the other with Mason and Dixon, discuss the differences between the two locations and the particular behaviors of the titular heroes. The episode closes with Dixon departing for the Cape with the clock previously kept by Maskelyne, leaving behind Mason and the other clock. =Episode 13= Lunar connections and allusions pervade the episode. With Dixon away to the Cape, Mason turns his attention to his new assignment‚Äîassisting Maskelyne in his attempts to establish observations of the lunar distance as the preferred means of obtaining longitude at sea. He is unnerved by Maskelyne's account of his former assistant and the erratic and paranoid behavior of the lunatic astronomer. Maskelyne is wary of political enemies at home and conspiracies on the island concerning his appointment and the benefits of being related to Clive of India, a prominent figure in the East India trade. Mason's own paranoia and melancholy wax as he remains on the island, but he manages to maintain enough perspective to falsify a flattering interpretation of the Maskelyne's horoscope during one night of drinking at Maskelyne's favorite bar, The Moon. =Episode 14= The episode plays upon relativity, simultaneity, and conjunction. Upon a high ridge of St. Helena, Mason wanders as he wonders whether Dixon has landed safely on the Cape and what he might be about at that minute. Dixon, it turns out, is spending a large amount of time avoiding the consequences of the Vroom daughters' fascination with Mason, who, rumors in town have it, became involved with all of the daughters, the mother, and a slave during his stay on the Cape. Dixon is able to stop Cornelius Vroom from shooting him as a substitute for Mason, and the two spend an evening at The World's End, Vroom's local watering hole. There, Dixon makes first-hand observations on the debauchery that pervades the Dutch of the Cape and glimpses the consequences for the colony's black populace. He carries a drunken Cornelius home and is warned by the daughter Gret to hide the clock he has brought with him because of the contemporary fascination and paranoia regarding the rigors of time and the workings of mechanical clocks. =Episode 15= The first of three episodes that veers between Mason's time on the island working with the frustrated, and possibly mad Maskelyne, and his recounting of events to Dixon upon their joint return to England. Mason and Maskelyne, whose obsession with his faulty instruments only grows, visit the haunting Windward side of the island for observations. Maskelyne tells Mason how a soldier he saved from throwing himself off a nearby cliff now harbors hope that Maskelyne's connections to Clive will get him out of further service on the god forsaken island. Amidst unceasing wind, Mason suspects the soldier is in fact a ghost, and the ghost of Mason's late wife Rebekah visits him for the first time. =Episode 16= Mason tells Dixon how he first met his wife Rebekah at a cheese-rolling festival in Randwick, but his narrative is briefly interrupted by the Reverend's audience who protest contradictions with historical records. Back on the island, Rebekah's visitations continue and Mason soon learns for certain that Dieter, the soldier, too is a ghost and Maskelyne's private specter. He flees to the coast and purchases transport back to town aboard a dhow. =Episode 17= Arriving back in James Town, Mason is diverted by Florinda's now ex-fiance, Mournival, who conducts Mason on a tour of his new enterprise, a Museum dedicated to Jenkins' Ear. Presented with the ear itself, said to have magical properties of fulfilling wishes whispered into it, Mason begins to ask for the return of his wife but instead wishes a safe voyage to St. Helena for Dixon. For his part, Dixon later reveals that while still in Cape Town he fancied hearing Mason's wish in the voice of the wind shortly before his departure. The two ponder the possibilities and reflect on Maskeylne's possible madness as they make the return trip to England. =Episode 18= Upon their return to England in June, the two astronomers part ways, with Dixon going north to his family and Mason procrastinating against a visit to his. Shortly after making his way home, however, Mason's mentor and benefactor James Bradley falls ill and dies, occasioning Mason to reflect on his beginnings in astronomy and the real circumstances of his courtship with Rebekah. =Episode 19= The death of Bradley is the topic of discussion at a local pub called \\"The George\\" and provides a segue into talk about the 1752 conversion of England to the Gregorian calendar and the resulting \\"missing\\" eleven days. Much is made over how days might be done away with and the temporal effect on those who were alive at the time. The discussion grows heated and scientific by turns and introduces a new territory to the book with the revelation that Macclesfield recruited a cadre of \\"Asiatick Pygmies\\" to colonize the missing time and preserve temporal flow. The pygmies, Mason states, now live perpetually in the past, eleven days behind the rest of British society and may occasionally be glimpsed moving as ghosts in the present. =Episode 20= Mason visits his father's house and we are introduced for the first time to his two sons. Mason also meets Delicia Quall, a neighbor-woman who believes Mason should give up astronomy, stay in England with his sons, stop grieving for Rebekah, and marry her. Mason's father, a baker, is also present and we learn of his initial opposition to Mason's career in star-gazing. The younger Mason reveals that his next destination is likely to be America. =Episode 21= Mason recalls to himself his early days with Rebekah, his proposal to her, and his elation that she does not disapprove of his profession. He answers his sons' questions about America and his purpose there. Then, in the summer of 1763, he returns to London to begin preparations for his journey and has another brief encounter with Maskelyne, now returned from St. Helena and soon bound for the West Indies. =Episode 22= The episode opens in the Hurworth home of William Emerson, Dixon's longtime mentor and former instructor. After a brief interruption from the Reverend Cherrycoke's audience discussing the magic and commercial prospects in America, Dixon is introduced to Father Christopher Maire, a Jesuit priest and acquaintance of Emerson. Dixon's early apprenticeship to Emerson is recounted, including Emerson's disappointment that Dixon would choose an earth-bound profession such as surveying, before Maire and Emerson appeal to him to accept the commission in America and to agree to regular contact with the Jesuits regarding the progress of the mission. Dixon is reluctant to become associated with the Jesuits, fearing retaliation, but agrees to consider the idea as the episode closes and all three make their way to Emerson's local pub, The Cudgel and Throck. =Episode 23= At Emerson's local pub, with Maire disguising his Jesuit connections under civilian clothes, the trio discusses a variety of topics including China, Feng Shui, ley lines, and a network of ancient tunnels that lies beneath County Durham. Dixon and Emerson recount various expeditions into the tunnels and offer explanations to their use and meaning. Maire's admission that he has spent time in Italy heightens suspicion of his identity but he quickly deflects it by offering to cook the first pizza in England, a ghastly concoction of tough bread, ketchup brought back from the Cape by Dixon, and stilton cheese. =Episode 24= In a reflection of Mason's recollections in Episode 21, Dixon revisits the early days of his father's courtship and relationship with his mother, Mary. He also dwells on the death of his father several years before and the impact it had on his personal and professional trajectory. While journeying down the Thames River, where he will meet Mason to sign the contract that will send them to America, Dixon and the boat's crew encounter a heavy fog that mystically, but briefly, transports them to the hostile shores of Delaware. =Episode 25= After a year and a half apart, Mason & Dixon meet again in London in 1763. Over ale, Dixon conveys his sympathy for the loss of Bradley and Mason reveals that Bradley had been en route to Plymouth to see them off on their ill-fated first journey aboard the Seahorse. The two consider the prospect of danger in America and wonder whether the work they performed since sending the Royal Society their letter of concern after the attack by the l'Grand in some way smoothed over any doubts about their fitness. The two men indulge in paranoid discussion regarding the reasons Bradley may have wanted to see them, hidden purposes for their new undertaking, as well as the various interests that attach importance to their previous and current endeavors. Two: America =Episode 26= The intrepid duo arrive in America and are promptly greeted by the sights, smells, and sounds thereof. The Rev'd Cherrycoke's audience interrupts to discuss the variety of evangelical religions that have sprung up under the ministrations of one MacClenaghan and its reflections on the musical influences of the day. The episode concludes with a demonstration of new musical themes upon a clavier and its effect upon revolutionary impulses. =Episode 27= Visiting an apothecary in Philadelphia, the two men meet Benjamin Franklin, who invites them to a coffee-house, a veritable hot-bed of insurrection and revolutionary talk. There, Dr. Franklin introduces them to Molly and Dolly (women of questionable reputation) and proceeds to quiz Mason on Dixon's association with the Jesuits and Dixon on Mason's association with Bradley and the East India Company. The episode concludes with Franklin ushering the two men into a carriage that will convey them to Virginia and a meeting with one Colonel Washington. =Episode 28= At Mt. Vernon, the two men enjoy a late afternoon drink, snacks, and some marijuana with George Washington. The discussion ranges between Judaism, Chief Pontiac, the demarcation of western lines by the French and British, and the telluric plates left by one Celeron de Bienville in his efforts to claim territory. Upon their return to Philadelphia, they engage Dr. Franklin anew and he speculates on their shared goals and the Sino- Jesuit connection that Franklin and others believe is intent on creating a communications network across the continent. =Episode 29= A brief episode that finds Mason indulging in paranoid worry over the Commissioners of the Boundary Line, their roots in secret organizations, and the size of bugs in America. The episode concludes in an ale-house where Dr. Franklin, in the guise of Poor Richard entertains the crowd with an electric dazzle before rushing outside to capture the power of a fresh thunderstorm. =Episode 30= In late December 1763, the astronomers complete the first of their tasks as assigned by the Commissioners: establish the southernmost limit of the city of Philadelphia. Erecting an observatory near Cedar Street they mark the line of the city, and the latitude they will follow west, as 15 miles south of the city. Dixon, in yet another coffee house, falls into conversation with Dolly over Mason's and Molly's shared melancholic personalities, and a series of puzzling measurements that seem to suggest Pennsylvania is moving by degrees each year. =Episode 31= The duo awake one morning and find the city abuzz with news of the Paxton Boys' massacre of Native Americans at Lancaster, not far from Philadelphia. Reminded of the violence on the Cape, and spooked by the militant attitude of the local citizenry, the two men wonder aloud how they might avoid both Paxtons and Indians during their journey west. The Reverend Cherrycoke and his audience debate the original meaning of 'liberty' and the barbaric treatment of Indians by both the British and Americans before the episode returns to find a highly caffeinated Mason & Dixon discussing the origins of violence in America. Dixon likens the current situation of hide- and-seek from various forces to his own childhood reminiscences of the Jacobite networks in Durham. =Episode 32= A brief opening featuring the Reverend's audience is followed by a lengthy episode centering once more on time and time-keeping devices. Dixon reveals that before their departure from England he was given a chronometer watch by Emerson, the major feature of which is the perpetual motion of its inner workings and the consequent lack of need to wind it. The peculiarities of the watch lead to discussions on the Principia Mathematica and the doctrine of motion. Charged with preserving the timepiece by Emerson, Dixon is dismayed when it is swallowed whole by the obsessed R.C., a surveyor linked to a tangent on Mason & Dixon's line. Emerson, informed of the news via a letter which Mason suggests may release Dixon from his obligations, celebrates wildly. =Episode 33= The episode covers a full year of work by the astronomers, opening in January 1764 with the reverberations of the massacre and the attack on Fort Pitt still being felt. Mason & Dixon make their base of operations south of the city near the house of John Harland. There, they erect a new base of observation and proceed to mark off the Tangent Line. The work occasions a discussion of the history of the boundary dispute and various mathematical and political attempts to set the line. =Episode 34= Mason & Dixon make separate journeys to the site of the Lancaster massacre and endure the specter of racial violence and the suspicion of the locals. =Episode 35= The Reverend's audience once more raises objections to his story based on historical facts, while the Rev'd himself maintains that history is preserved not in universal acceptance of one story but in the propagation of different interpretations by novelists, playwrights, and poets. Thus armed, the good Rev'd sets the scene for his reunion with the astronomers in a Philadelphia watering hole known as The India Queen. There, the Reverend encounters locals much concerned with religion since the revelation experienced by one of their members who now wanders the west in an attempt to convert others to his vision. =Episode 36= During a nor'easter, Mason & Dixon seek refuge in The India Queen and discover the presence of Reverend Cherrycoke, who now bears a commission as chaplain of the expedition. Decidedly nonplussed by this revelation, the duo welcome his company and proceed to spend the night at the inn drinking, talking, and observing the variety of clientele brought in by the storm while they enjoy the food of its exiled French Chef, Armand Allegre. The next morning, before the assembled guests, Allegre embarks on a recollection of his story, dubbed the Iliad of Inconvenience. =Episode 37= Allegre recounts his long apprenticeship to one of the great chefs in Paris, culminating in his own fame throughout France for his various preparations of duck. His fame brings him to the attention of the Mechanical Duck, the invention of one Jacques de Vaucanson. By reasons not entirely understood, the Duck attains consciousness and an exponential leap in its physical abilities far beyond human ingenuity. Thus imbued, it now holds Allegre responsible for the death of all fellow ducks prepared for the dining room table and demands as payment that he assist the Duck by rescuing another of Vauscanon's automaton, a counterpart duck. Ever-persecuted by the Duck, Allegre flees to America. =Episode 38= Back in the India Queen, Allegre's story is challenged by a Mr. Dimdown, but the potential duel is interrupted by the Duck when Dimdown's sword is flung from his hand by an invisible force. A discussion on the Duck's continued ascent beyond the simple physics of its design and Allegre's wonder at the foods in America eventually turns to serious discussion of Christian rituals of communion versus heathen beliefs about cannibalism. Dimdown and Allegre reconcile over comparisons between the layers of pastry and the layered Damascus steel of Dimdown's blade. =Episode 39= Still trapped by the snow, Mason & Dixon open the episode in a quarrel over Mason's melancholy and its best remedy. While Dixon grows fat eating the baked goods of his amorous object, Mason steadfastly refuses to enjoy sensual delights. When a break in the weather permits their departure, the two ride in separate directions: Mason to the north, and Dixon to the south. Dixon journeys to Virginia where Thomas Jefferson offers a brief history on Virginia's own border. =Episode 40= Six years after Rebekah's passing, Mason journeys north into Manhattan and eventually Long Island where he is nearly attacked by a gang of thieves. He pretends briefly to be French rather than British and ends up avoiding unpleasantness by helping to fix the band's telescope. During the course of his work he and the gang discuss actual slavery versus the virtual slavery of contemporary wage-labor, the lack of colonial representation in the House of Commons, and how the British image of America contrasts with the reality. Leaving the group and headed towards Philadelphia again, Mason begins to sense for the first time how public sentiment in the colonies is shaping the future of the world. =Episode 41= The Reverend's brother-in-law, LeSpark, reveals that he briefly encountered the astronomers in the private ridotto of the iron-monger, slave-holder, and inveterate gambler Lord Lepton. Lepton, who fled England to escape his gambling debts, entertains the surveyors at his private castle in the Pennsylvania country side. With concubines purchased from the Canadian convent the Widows of Christ, Lepton's debauched party takes on a hellish air that unnerves the surveyors and makes them anxious to flee. =Episode 42= Dixon proposes to steal one of Lepton's iron bath tubs as compensation for the twenty pounds he believes were unfairly taken from him during a night of gambling. Using magnetic principles taught to him by Emerson, he and Mason attempt to steal the tub but are distracted first by one of Lepton's servants who reminds them of a previous acquaintance and then by the appearance of a pentacle that unpleasantly connects Lepton to the massacre at Lancaster. They make a hasty departure, having taken on new party members, including an electric ray they presently begin to use as a compass. =Episode 43= After several months of surveying, Mason & Dixon return to Newark. They retrieve their correspondence from the previous months and Mason learns that Maskelyne has been appointed Astronomer Royal, replacing Mason's departed mentor, Bradley. In typical fashion, Dixon consoles Mason who, despite his common background, had hoped his association with Bradley and the work done on the Transit might make him a candidate for the post. =Episode 44= The episode's epigraph quotes the Reverend on the properties of ley lines and recalls Dixon's own scholarship on the topic under Emerson's guidance as the crew speculates on the effects of placing crystal markers exactly upon these mystical points. Several ax-men, many of Swedish origin, are added to the crew and in April the surveyors begin to move west, dividing north and south and even a house as they go. =Episode 45= The Mechanical Duck continues to follow Allegre and the rest of the crew as they survey west. Allegre proposes that the Duck's obsession with him is tied to its paradoxical evolution, in which it both ascends beyond the realm of limited physical ability and is simultaneously bound to more earthly motivations. Mason inevitably and perhaps subconsciously links the Duck's passage from one world to the next, and Vaucanson's efforts to understand the resulting change, to his own feelings on Rebekah's passing. =Episode 46= A morning revue of the crew occasions an opportunity for Mason & Dixon to hear various grievances and offer solutions. One common complaint is the extortion practiced by the prostitutes following the camp. The episode is extended by negotiations between the camp pimp, Nathanael McLean, and the head girl, Mrs. Eggslap. =Episode 47= A heavy thunderstorm is the backdrop for the first half of the episode, which features the standard bickering between Mason & Dixon and some notes on the drawing of Arcs and Tangents on the line. Ordered to extend the Tangent and Meridian, the crew passes into dairy country and young Nathanael in particular is smitten by one of the plethora of fair milk- maids. =Episode 48= The surveyors continue to draw their line, moving back eastward at the opening of the section but always near the Susquehanna River which serves as a boundary of more than one type. In their efforts to close off the Tangent line they discover some anomalies in previous measurements as well as legal inconsistencies that leave a small \\"Wedge\\" of ambiguous territory neither in Maryland or Pennsylvania, creating yet another of the novel's uncharted alternate domains. Two \\"Chain-men\\", Darby and Cope, attract some attention for impersonating Mason & Dixon in order to seduce the locals. The chapter closes with the discovery of their subterfuge, Squire Haligast warning that the party will soon encounter \\"China-men,\\" and the delivery of a package from Maskelyne telling of geographical interferences with measurements that forces Mason to recall the windward side of St. Helena. =Episode 49= As they cross the Susquehanna and the colonist population begins to thin, the camp's retinue grows increasingly large and lengthens behind them. The near- Eden of unspoiled country, mystical and mesmerizing, prompts reflection and some paranoia over the future on the part of the duo. Acknowledging their obligations and the compulsory nature of their work, the two wonder whether they are not being used, each favoring their usual conspiracy: religion and the Jesuits for Mason, commerce and the East India Co. for Dixon. They draw near the Redzinger farm and discover that Peter, the wandering apostle, has returned, claiming Christ has abandoned him. The Reverend and his audience close the episode with speculation on the mathematical shape of heaven and hell. =Episode 50= As fall approaches, Mason and Dixon adopt a habit of exploring local roads for taverns and inns at the end of each day's surveying. The episode's main action takes place in one such locale, The Rabbi of Prague, whose denizens consist of Kabbalistic individuals and whose habits and bearings resemble, among others, those of Popeye and Mr. Spock. Passing the evening in their company, Dixon learns of a local golem created by Native Americans and of theories that the American continent was \\"discovered\\" as a result of God's retreat at the dawn of the Enlightenment. =Episode 51= An opening that features the two main characters playing practical jokes on one another is followed by a night of heavy rain and fearful talk of Indian attack and The Black Dog, the latest fearsome-fantastic rumored to stalk the wilderness and a possible stand-in for Cerberus. On September 21, the first day of autumn, Mason & Dixon pass over South Mountain on their way toward Antietam Creek. There, they tour a cave system with spectacular formations and some ancient and undecipherable writings that produce profoundly different reactions in the polar temperaments of the surveyors. =Episode 52= With the summer of surveying drawing to a close, the camp passes over the west branch of Conococheague Creek, a territory claimed by the Black Boys and echoing with their deeds. Turning back East for the winter, the crew pass near the site of General Braddock's defeat some years earlier. The scenery and passing of the seasons moves their thoughts to the past, causing Mason and Dixon to wonder on the relation between this defeat and the treatment of British weavers rebelling against wage reduction by James Wolfe, hero of Quebec. The episode closes during winter and New Year with sledding, drinking, and discussions of altitude and unbounded space. =Episode 53= An apparent captivity narrative begins, telling of how an unidentified colonial American woman is taken from her farmstead by nonviolent Indians across the Susquehanna River and north to a Jesuit college in Quebec. There, she begins training to become a Widow of Christ, encounters the intricacies of Jesuit telegraphy, and meets a Chinese Feng-shui master. =Episode 54= The captivity narrative continues, and is revealed as a hijacking of the story by potentially amorous young cousins who thus far have listened to Cherrycoke's tale, but now combine it with passages from The Ghastly Fop, a pulp series. The American Woman and the Chinese Feng-shui master escape the Widows of Christ (and the pages of The Ghastly Fop), and join up with the party of Mason & Dixon, where Mason sees an uncanny resemblance between the woman and his departed wife, Rebekah. A discussion of metempsychosis ensues. Mason then has strange dreams of Rebekah, and decides the American Woman is not so like her after all. =Episode 55= Captain Zhang the Chinese Feng-shui master, convinced the party is being tracked by Jesuits, ignites discussion within the company of various conspiracy theories concerning the line. Included are the possibilities that they are being used by Jesuits to rid the earth of Feng-shui (the line being a terrible example of it, according to Zhang), or guided, perhaps magnetically, to secret ore deposits cherished by the Indians and required for the manufacture of ammunition. Captain Zhang's paranoia turns maniacal; he becomes convinced he himself is in fact the Jesuit spy until debunked by the other members of the party. Meanwhile, the amorous cousins part unrequited, she having fallen asleep, and Cherrycoke resumes control. =Episode 56= Mason tells Dixon how he visited the missing eleven days that were canceled when England adopted the Gregorian calendar in 1752. He found himself \\"alone in the material World\\", without any people, and visited Oxford, finding the city completely empty. He perused the Bodleian Library, and felt that other entities, possibly intelligent, were searching the volumes there. =Episode 57= Early 1766. Mason & Dixon again depart in opposite directions for a winter break, this time Dixon heading north to New York, where he runs into the same gang Mason previously encountered there, though they are now somewhat transformed by revolutionary sentiment. Dimdown, similarly transformed, re- enters and Dixon marvels at the breadth of the movement and the possibility of insurrection, discussing grievances against the crown before engaging in a friendly debate over the quality of American versus British beer. =Episode 58= Mason travels south to Virginia, where he revisits with George Washington in a billiard hall and, much like Dixon in New York, discovers conversation monopolized by pre-revolutionary indignation. Mason is then questioned by Nathanael McLean, a former member of his party turned slothful student, about the repercussions, karmic or otherwise, of the line. =Episode 59= The surveyors return to camp in spring from their respective winter destinations to find it in disarray. An episode involving Captain Shelby, a member of their party, performing a shotgun wedding, including details of the preceding fighting and ensuing partying, is related to them. =Episode 60= Shelby, also a surveyor and possibly unstable, accompanies the party westward and questions Dixon about the line. Dixon and Zhang then converse and arrive at the subject of dragons, whence Dixon relates the long tale of the Lambton Worm, conquered by a returning crusader who, following the battle, broke the oath he swore with God in order to achieve victory‚Äîan act that left his family cursed for nine generations. The party discuss and interpret the tale, and Shelby suggests, perhaps menacingly, that the surveyors accompany him to a \\"serpent mound\\" whose design can only be appreciated from far above, alluding to Dixon's past with Emerson and the ley-lines. =Episode 61= Shelby takes Mason & Dixon to investigate the \\"serpent mound\\", which turns out to be a perfect cone, designed and constructed much in the manner of a Leyden Jar. Shelby insists it is of both Welsh and Native American origin, and that cryptic markings scratched into its side are warnings to the surveyors, who discover their compasses malfunction while in its vicinity. Back in camp with Zhang, they discuss Jesuit machinations and their possible connection to extraterrestrials, in conjunction with a debate over hollow-earth theories. The chapter ends with a humorous episode in which either Death or The Devil, following the party as a \\"third surveyor\\", tries to hire a lawyer. =Episode 62= Stig, an axman in the party, is exposed as spy working on behalf of a group Dixon dubs \\"Swedish Jacobites\\", who Stig claims descended from the far north and were the first to arrive at Philadelphia, where they lived in peace with the natives, irking the Americans with their claim to the land and thus somehow leading to the boundary dispute and the line. All this is thrown into relief by Stig's own admission he may not even be Swedish, that he may be a mercenary, and that he believes an armed attack against Philadelphia an imminent possibility. Meanwhile, the party continues west; Dixon, in discussion with Mason and Zhang, notes the only true difference between the individual colonies, and the expedition is confronted by bushmen. =Episode 63= A brief episode involving Zepho Bark, owner of a farmhouse near the line, who, upon the emergence of the full moon, becomes a were-beaver‚Äîleading him to enter into a moonlit tree-felling contest with Stig the axman. Zepho takes a massive lead, only to lose his beaver form mid-contest as a result of a lunar eclipse the astronomers had forgotten was taking place. Gamblers betting on Zepho suggest a lawsuit should be brought against them, could it be proven they knew it would happen. Zhang tells them he knows of just such an incident, and begins to relate the story. =Episode 64= Zhang tells the story of Hsi and Ho, ancient Chinese astronomers, who are forced to flee when they fail to predict an eclipse, embarrassing their master the emperor who should have intimate knowledge of all \\"divine\\" occurrences. They escape via flying apparatus, bickering all the while, and crash into the estate of a wealthy lord with a \\"harem\\" of nubile daughters, who hires them so he can have foreknowledge of celestial events and gain an advantage in business and war. In one version of the story their neglect of their profession leads him to banish them to the desert; in another it leads to his death and their appropriation of his lands, wealth, and daughters. =Episode 65= The surveyors run the line, while Zhang questions the effect of the lost 11 days on the Chinese calendar, and whether it has created inconsistencies and error among all historical time-keeping, leading to discourse on the correct dating of the birth of Christ. =Episode 66= The story carries into 1767, the surveyor's \\"last year upon the line\\". First Stig is bizarrely interrogated, and they hear ghosts in the wind, before stumbling upon a barn-raising party where characters including Armand and The Duck resurface. Later they arrive in Cumberland, where they meet Thomas Cresap and his family, hear stories of Cresap's exploits, and discover the town to be essentially lawless and somewhat reminiscent of the wild west, complete with lone sheriff. Mason attempts to converse with a dog, who understands his questions but chooses to ignore him. =Episode 67= The party is joined by a delegation of Indians, who partake in further discussion between the surveyors and Zhang regarding Jesuit methods of forming boundaries. The party is informed by the Indians they will soon reach a mystical \\"Warrior-Path\\" they will not be allowed to cross, heralding the end of their journey. The Indians then regale them with tales of an area to the west filled with giant produce and containing a marijuana plant so large its branches support settlements, perhaps as a coded effort to sell the surveyors some of that latter substance. Eventually they are taken there, and discover huge tomatoes and beets, which they reason cannot be God's work and must be the legacy of departed giants. =Episode 68= The surveyors release most of the party, keeping their retinue of Indians and a few others, and continue west with the line, taking a ferry across the Youghiogheny river-lake. The stygian captain of the ferry discusses with them the ghost-fish in the river, his personal tragedies, America's propensity for war, and, to the dismay of the surveyors, points out and makes personal use of the correlation between war and business. The party then ponders what awaits them on the other side. =Episode 69= The Duck, its powers augmented by the negative energy of the line and obsessed with a decoy the party have created and placed upon it, becomes a permanent resident of it. Dixon meanwhile becomes obsessed with infinite westward expansion, and the party approaches the Monongahela River. Meanwhile, two \\"axmen\\" are killed by a falling tree. A wide variety of Indian nations take an interest in the party as it passes through their lands, where the surveyors eventually travel upon the \\"Warrior-Path\\" amid feuding war-parties. Lastly, Mason & Dixon share a dream of pursuing their path further west. =Episode 70= The surveyors finish the line, and deciding to take their chances, leave the party and cross the \\"Warrior-Path\\" in the dead of night to ride to the river, all the while suffering from various ailments and delusions, as well as paranoia they will encounter a similar fate to Edward Braddock. They reach the river and are discovered there by Indians familiar to them, who are returning from scalping Lord Lepton, proving it by displaying his rifle, complete with its menacing and possibly satanic insignia. The party then commences the return journey, heading east amid hardship and difficult weather. =Episode 71= Back in Delaware, the surveyors argue over the significance of the line and its planography while tavern-crawling. They then stay the following year in America, busy with the degree of latitude, chaining a Meridian Line through boggy terrain. Meanwhile, it is intimated that Dixon might prefer to remain in America, and they reflect on their voyages, the commonality of slavery in all their destinations, and the voyage home and what may await them there. =Episode 72= The surveyors complete the meridian line and venture to Baltimore, where Dixon interferes with a slave-driver, first berating him in a tavern before beating him in the street, liberating his slaves, and escaping with Mason, who admires him for his action. They ride north, converse with Zhang, and reach New York, from where they will depart the colonies. Mason is visited again by Rebekah, who presses him upon his duty to her. In New York they are unable to find previous acquaintances, are accosted by a cryptic stranger upon the docks, and set sail. =Episode 73= In an episode conceived in the form of an Italian Opera, an alternate, imaginary version of the surveyors' final days in America is relayed where they continue west past the Ohio River, cross the Mississippi, encounter a variety of carnivalesque inhabitants of the interior, and become the first to discover Uranus. Again Dixon wishes to remain, but Mason sees the \\"new\\" planet as a ticket to acceptance and a life of ease, so they return east, making all those they met and passed while going west uneasy. In the end Dixon imagines continuing east with the line, and drawing it straight across the Atlantic. Three: Last Transit =Episode 74= Mason & Dixon return to London, where they decline, for various possible reasons, to accept another assignment together. Dixon is sent to the North Cape, Norway to observe the return Transit of Venus, while Mason is sent to Ireland to do the same. There, he is conscripted into helping deal with a peat-flow, given to temperamental behavior, and visited again by Rebekah. Upon his return to London he argues with Maskelyne, who assures him their office is no longer what it once was, and accepts another assignment to travel to Scotland. =Episode 75= Mason visits Dixon, who is now home from his assignment, on his way North to Scotland. The two friends fish and drink, admitting finally the strength of their relationship without quite putting it into words. Dixon relates to Mason his trip to the North Cape, and claims to have visited the civilization inside the earth, entering through the north pole, one of many openings to a massive hollow chamber with upside-down seas. The episode then concludes with Mason promising to visit again‚ÄîDixon being unable to travel, having come down with a case of gout. =Episode 76= Mason meets Samuel Johnson at an inn on the border of Scotland (a meeting dismissed as fictitious by Cherrycoke's audience), and the two discuss Scotland and America, as well as men like Cherrycoke, and Johnson's biographer, James Boswell, who are always \\"scribbling things down\\". The brief episode ends with a vision of Mason's later life. =Episode 77= Mason visits Dixon who is recently married and suffering from gout. Dixon laments that the recent death of his mother and the political turbulence in America have forced him to abandon his hopes of emigration, deciding instead to profit from the United Kingdom's growing coal dependency. Mason, himself remarried, confesses that his newborn son unpleasantly resembles his father who has himself remarried a Mary. The Learned English Dog makes another appearance, though he refrains from speech except to declare that he will next visit when the two surveyors are together once again. The two men share a dream of a performance where, in Mason's version, he attempts to introduce Dixon to Bradley, whilst Dixon envisions a duet based on their adventures. =Episode 78= Upon hearing of Dixon's death, Mason and his son Doctor Isaac make a pilgrimage to his grave reminiscent of the journeys the two surveyors previously embarked upon together. The Learned English Dog fails to make a bodily appearance. However, a cat lurks around Dixon's grave with a keen interest in the two Masons. Slipping into senility, Mason finally lets Maskelyne have it, as the two engage in a heated squabble over astrology and the events after Bradley's passing. Mason, now settled in America, is visited by the elderly Benjamin Franklin who is accosted by rantings of Mason's in regards to hidden messages in Bradley's contentious observations. Mason's second wife Mary prays for her husband and returns to England with their younger children, while Doctor Isaac and William, Rebekah's sons, stay in America and see out their father's final days. The story ends as the two brothers reminisce on how they as boys always wished for the day their father would take them to America.

It was originally broadcast on BBC Three on 27 October 2008, and repeated on frontline channel BBC One the following day. The episode was written by head writer Neil Cross; with additional writing by Ben Richards; and directed by Colm McCarthy. The episode is considered the second of a two-part story, following preceding episode \\"New Allegiances\\". In the episode, Sir Harry Pearce (Peter Firth) is determined to carry out his revenge on London's FSB head of operations Arkady Kachimov (Stuart Wilson), who in the previous episode purposely withheld intelligence that caused the death of Adam Carter. However, the MI5 team discover he is overseeing a cyber attack in progress, and returned officer Lucas North (Richard Armitage) may be involved. In the end, MI5 stop the attack, and Harry kills Kachimov. \\"Split Loyalties\\" include four deleted scenes, which were not included in the final episode, but placed in the series' official website. The episode attracted over five million viewers after its broadcast, as well as receiving generally positive reviews from television critics. Plot Eight hours following the death of Adam Carter, Ros Myers (Hermione Norris) and Sir Harry Pearce (Peter Firth) discuss how they are to get back at FSB head of operations in London Arkady Kachimov (Stuart Wilson). Afterwards, Ros returns to her hotel room, and destroys it in a fit of rage. The next morning, Harry asks Richard Dolby (Robert East) to go after Kachimov, but is refused. However, Harry decides to disobey and go after Kachimov anyway, and promotes Ros to chief of Section D, a position previously held by Adam. Harry calls Lucas North (Richard Armitage) to meet with him for information on Kachimov. Before Lucas arrives, he calls Kachimov to warn him Harry is coming after him. Later, Lucas is appointed a handler from the FSB, and is shocked to find it is his ex-wife, Elizabeta Starkova (Paloma Baeza). Meanwhile, Malcolm Wynn-Jones (Hugh Simon) discovers a communication burst coming from the North Sea, believing a Russian submarine is entering British waters unannounced to carry out a mission. After learning that Alexander Beletsky (Georg Nikoloff), a man with connections to Kachimov, is going to shut down his company's servers, Malcolm confirms his suspicions; the Russians are planning a cyber attack against Britain by breaking into a submarine communications cable and shutting down every computer system in the country. Harry urges Dolby to temporarily shut down the Internet, but is once again denied. Later, Ros breaks into Lucas' flat while he is away, and discovers Lucas is a double agent, feeding the Russians news that MI5 know about their planned attack. Ros tasers Lucas and brings him back to Thames House. Lucas admits he is spying for the Russians because Kachimov promised he would be released from prison sooner if he would, but also reveals he intends to bring Kachimov down by making him trust Lucas. Although sceptical, Harry sends Lucas to Kachimov to learn which cable the submarine will attack so Malcolm can launch a counterattack. Lucas is able to turn Kachimov by forging evidence that he is an MI5 mole. They both go to the Russian embassy and find the submarine's location, after which Malcolm launches the counterattack with seconds to spare. Kachimov is later arrested. Lucas visits Elizabeta at her home, which was also their married home and he asks her to become an asset to MI5 to save her from arrest because of her association with Kachimov. In the end, Kachimov is with Harry and Ros in a field. Kachimov states his admiration for Adam's sacrifice, but then callously says he was a replaceable resource. In the final moments, Ros hands Harry a gun and Harry kills Kachimov with a shot to the chest. Production The episode was written by head writer Neil Cross. It was also additionally written by Ben Richards. The plot of the episode was influenced by the resurgence of power in Russia following the end of the Cold War, which the producers felt in subtle ways is threatening the security of the West. The producers also included scenes that would show Lucas adjusting to the outside world following eight years of imprisonment, to show how emotionally damaged the character is, and make the audience realise he is struggling. One of the scenes include Lucas struggling to sleep on a bed, and soon resorts to lying on the floor instead. The episode includes four deleted scenes, which feature more on Adam's past. In the scenes Harry tells Ros that he was looking for Adam's mother, but could not find her because before his death, Adam altered her records on where she lived. Harry visits a wealthy estate where she worked and is told she is currently in Blackpool. In the last scene, Harry and Ros toast to Adam. Those scenes have been included on BBC iPlayer on the Spooks website. Broadcast and reception The episode was originally broadcast on digital channel BBC Three from 10:30 pm on Monday, 27 October 2008, the same day as the BBC One viewing of the first episode. The episode would be repeated on the frontline BBC One a day later, during the 9 pm to 10 pm time slot. The BBC Three broadcast was viewed by 827,000 and a 7.3% audience share. It was the second most seen multichannel of the night, beaten by the first episode of Dead Set from E4. The BBC One repeat was seen by 5.06 million viewers with a 22.2 per cent; though it was down by 450,000 from the previous episode, it still won its time slot; and both broadcasts achieved a total reach of 5.89 million. According to the Broadcasters' Audience Research Board, the episode received final viewing figures of 0.93 million on BBC Three, and 5.63 million on BBC One; together they add up to 6.56 million. The Daily Telegraph stated \\"after yesterday's shock demise of series pin-up Rupert Penry-Jones as Adam, fans of the spy drama may be forgiven for approaching the second episode of the new series with trepidation. Fear not, though, there are no star deaths [...] only one rather welcome one [Lucas].\\" John Beresford of TV Scoop praised the entire episode, stating \\"the pace didn't let up from start to finish, the whole thing looked awesome, the acting was pitch perfect,\\" and the dialogue \\"never drops into the realms of trite, or hyperbole, or parody. Each phrase is like a diamond. Tight, bright and sparkling. And able to cut deep,\\" adding \\"this series is already shaping up to be a classic.\\" Beresford also noted Armitage's performance, although this was only his second appearance, \\"Armitage looks and sounds like he's been here all along.\\" Greg O'Keefe of the Liverpool Echo, who also reviewed the first episode, as both episodes are considered a two-part story, stated it was \\"packed with great action sequences, razor-sharp writing and the usual quota of twists and turns.
