This has led to the emergence of international disaster response laws, rules and principles (IDRL): a collection of international instruments addressing various aspects of post- disaster humanitarian relief.GSDRC (2013). International legal frameworks for humanitarian action: Topic guide. Birmingham, UK: GSDRC, University of Birmingham http://www.gsdrc.org/go/topic-guides/international-legal- frameworks-for-humanitarian-action/challenges/-traps-and-debates/the- emergence-of-international-disaster-response-laws-rules-and-principles The IDRL of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent (IFRC) examines the legal issues and frameworks associated with disaster response with particular emphasis on international humanitarian assistance. The IDRL Programme seeks to promote the use of the IDRL Guidelines and support national Red Cross societies in improving legal preparedness for natural disasters in order to reduce human vulnerability. Differing contexts ‚Äì disasters and armed conflicts There is often a greater expectation in the case of disasters than in armed conflicts that domestic authorities will take the primary role in international humanitarian aid efforts and will not only facilitate access, but also coordinate it and monitor its effectiveness. In addition, given the longer establishment of International Humanitarian Law (IHL), there is much broader acceptance and clarification of the specific rights and obligations in armed conflict. There are fewer conditions that can legitimately be imposed on international humanitarian organizations before allowing them access in conflict settings.GSDRC (2013). International legal frameworks for humanitarian action: Topic guide. Birmingham, UK: GSDRC, University of Birmingham In terms of regulatory concerns, many of the same issues are faced in both disaster and conflict environments. These include regulatory barriers, such as bureaucratic delays in the entry of personnel, goods and equipment; and regulatory gaps, such as the absence of mechanisms to facilitate efficient domestic legal recognition of international organizations. There are also differences, however, for example concerns over security, which may not be as relevant in some disaster situations.GSDRC (2013). International legal frameworks for humanitarian action: Topic guide. Birmingham, UK: GSDRC, University of Birmingham In mixed situations, where there is both a disaster and ongoing armed conflict ‚Äì for example the 2004 tsunami in Sri Lanka ‚Äì IHL is the governing law. Even if the need for relief is prompted by a natural disaster rather than by ongoing fighting, the obligations of the parties to the conflict in an armed conflict setting remain the same. The main sources of IDL IDRL is not a comprehensive or unified framework. There are no core international treaties, such as the Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocols under IHL. Rather, it consists of a fragmented and piecemeal collection of various international, regional and bilateral treaties, non-binding resolutions, declarations, codes, guidelines, protocols and procedures. This includes relevant provisions of international treaties in other areas of law, such as international human rights law, international refugee law and IHL (in the case of conflict situations).GSDRC (2013). International legal frameworks for humanitarian action: Topic guide. Birmingham, UK: GSDRC, University of Birmingham Treaties These largely comprise bilateral treaties, covering various areas such as technical assistance, mutual assistance and agreements regulating humanitarian relief between the two state parties. The latter two tend to involve formal rules for the initiation and termination of assistance; and provisions for reducing regulatory barriers (involving e.g. visas and work permits and customs control for relief personal and goods). Regional treaties have largely been adopted for mutual disaster assistance and are in place in the Americas, Asia and Europe. There are a limited number of multilateral treaties. Like other bilateral treaties, they are often focused on a particular sector of operations such as health, telecommunications and transport. The global, but sectoral, Tampere Convention of 1998, for example, commits parties to reduce regulatory barriers and restrictions on the use, import and export of telecommunications equipment for disaster relief. Some global treaties are specific to particular types of disasters, including environmental treaties and treaties concerning industrial or nuclear accidents. Although these global treaties are legally binding, many are limited in utility as few states have ratified them or they are very limited in scope, geographic reach, or enforceability. In addition, few treaties address international actors other than states or UN agencies. International Custom It has been argued that there is a right to receive humanitarian assistance in disaster situations under customary international law. Sources relied upon include the ‚ÄòCode of Conduct for the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and NGOs in Disaster Relief‚Äô which states that there is a right to receive and to offer humanitarian assistance. In addition, the right to a healthy environment as an aspect of the fundamental right to life has been relied upon not only to demonstrate a right to assistance under IHRL but also as part of customary international law. However, for practice to develop into customary law there must be an indication of extensive and uniform state practice and a belief that such actions are required by law. In contrast, states have often responded to disasters on a case-by-case basis. It is also doubtful whether actions of non-state actors can be relied upon to satisfy the requirements of international custom.de Urioste, A. (2006-7). When will help be on the way - the status of international disaster response law. Tulane Journal of International and Comparative Law, 15, 181-206. http://heinonline.org /HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/tulicl15√∑=10&g;_sent=1&collection;=journals UN resolutions (soft law) The instruments with the broadest scope in IDRL are non-binding recommendations, declarations and guidelines. This includes the ‚ÄòMeasures to Expedite International Relief‚Äô, endorsed by the UN General Assembly and the International Conference of the Red Cross in 1977. The General Assembly also passed Resolution 36/225 in 1981, which called for strengthening the UN‚Äôs capacity to respond to disasters; and Resolution 46/182 in 1992, which called for a ‚Äòstrengthening of the coordination of emergency humanitarian assistance of the United Nations system‚Äô. Around the same time, the office that would later become the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) was created. In 2002, the General Assembly adopted Resolution 57/150, which reaffirmed resolution 46/182 and provided for strengthening the effectiveness and coordination of international urban search and rescue assistance.GSDRC (2013). International legal frameworks for humanitarian action: Topic guide. Birmingham, UK: GSDRC, University of Birmingham IDRL Guidelines The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies adopted in 2007 the ‚ÄòGuidelines for the Domestic Facilitation and Regulation of International Disaster Relief and Initial Recovery Assistance‚Äô. They are considered to be a significant development to the IDRL framework, with the potential to contribute to the development of norms under customary international law. The gaps in IDRL and related problems While regulatory problems in the delivery of humanitarian assistance exist in both disaster and conflict settings, they are exacerbated in the former due to the absence of an established comprehensive legal framework and an undeveloped disaster response and coordination mechanism. Common problems identified include: Initiation/barriers to entry In cases of major disaster, it is very rare that a state will refuse international assistance (the case of Burma was a unique situation). Instead, the more common problem is delay in the issuance of a formal request for such assistance or in the response to international offers. This could be due to weaknesses in national procedures and regulations for needs assessment and decision-making. Legal facilities for operation Even where consent is given for humanitarian operations, there are often problems with visas and travel restrictions. Disaster personnel are often granted entry on tourist or other temporary visas, which can cause subsequent problems with renewal and efforts to obtain work permits. Customs formalities are also a frequent problem, with relief goods held up for long periods of time waiting for clearance. The recognition of domestic legal status is another common problem for international relief providers, particularly for NGOs and foreign Red Cross or Red Crescent societies. The processes are often too slow or difficult to negotiate in emergency settings. Unregistered organisations face various problems, including difficulty opening bank accounts, hiring staff, obtaining visas for workers and tax exemptions. Bilateral agreements, negotiated in advance of an emergency, can be of significant assistance in addressing these issues. Without an agreement is in place, there is little guidance at the international level beyond the general obligation to facilitate aid. Regulation of co-ordination and quality Although affected states are expected to play the leading role in disaster settings, they have in some cases adopted a ‚Äòhands-off‚Äô approach, which has resulted in uneven and uncoordinated international efforts. International legal regulation of the quality of humanitarian assistance is also considered weak. This is due in part to states‚Äô reluctance to create legal frameworks that could threaten control over their borders; and concern by humanitarian actors that quality control regulations could result in loss of independence and freedom of action. Recent developments in IDRL Although IDRL is still in a nascent stage and gaps remain in its framework, progress has been made. The adoption of the ‚ÄòGuidelines for the Domestic Facilitation and Regulation of International Disaster Relief and Initial Recovery Assistance‚Äô (IDRL Guidelines) by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in 2007 is considered to be a significant development. Although these guidelines are non-binding, they are comprehensive in geographic scope, relevant for all sectors and for all types of disasters, and address both state and non-state actors. They aim to foster international agreement on how to address key issues specific to disaster settings. They define the responsibilities of affected states (reinforcing that primary responsibility lies with affected states) and offer a set of recommendations to governments for preparing their domestic laws and systems to manage international assistance during relief efforts. This includes encouraging legal facilities for operation, such as visa, customs and transport facilitation, tax exemptions, and a simplified process for acquiring temporary domestic legal personality. These facilities are conditional on ongoing compliance by humanitarian actors with core humanitarian principles and minimum standards drawn from widely recognised sources, such as the Code of Conduct.GSDRC (2013). International legal frameworks for humanitarian action: Topic guide. Birmingham, UK: GSDRC, University of Birmingham The substance of the guidelines is drawn primarily from international laws, rules, norms and principles; and from lessons and good practice from the field. The guidelines have achieved broad international support. State parties to the Geneva Conventions adopted these guidelines at the International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent in 2007. Moreover, several countries have already adopted new regulations or administrative rules based on or inspired by the guidelines. The International Law Commission (ILC), an expert body of the UN charged with codifying customary international law, has also been engaging in advancing the framework for disaster response. Its programme on the ‚ÄòProtection of Persons in the Event of Disasters‚Äô is aimed at developing a legally binding framework at the global level. Draft articles include attention to humanitarian principles; the duty of states to seek assistance when their national response capacity is exceeded; the duty not to arbitrarily withhold consent to external assistance; and the right of the international community to offer assistance.

It was written by Tracy Poust and Jon Kinnally and directed by series producer James Burrows. The episode originally aired on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) in the United States on September 23, 2004. Guest stars in \\"Back Up, Dancer\\" include Will Arnett, Bobby Cannavale, and Janet Jackson. In the episode, Jack (Sean Hayes) auditions to be a backup dancer for singer Janet Jackson, but in order to get the job, he must compete in a dance-off with a fellow named Artemus (Arnett). Meanwhile, Will (Eric McCormack) is torn between going out with his boyfriend Vince (Cannavale) and staying in to console Grace (Debra Messing) following her failed marriage. \\"Back Up, Dancer\\" received generally mixed reviews from television critics, some of whom disliked Jackson's appearance on the show. According to Nielsen, the episode was watched by 15.32 million households during its original broadcast, and received a 7.1 rating/19 share among viewers in the 18‚Äì49 demographic.  Plot  At the beginning of the episode Jack (Sean Hayes) learns he will have an audition to be a backup dancer for singer Janet Jackson. The audition was set up by singer Jennifer Lopez, whom Jack worked for in the same position after Lopez let him go. At the audition, Jackson decides that she would like five dancers instead of the six originally planned. Jack, \\"the newbie,\\" and Artemus (Will Arnett), \\"the guy who's been here the longest,\\" compete in a dance-off to determine the fifth dancer. Before the dance-off, Karen (Megan Mullally)‚ÄîJack's friend‚Äîvisits to support her friend. She sees Artemus and reveals to Jack the two are former lovers. The two get back together which outrages Jack. Karen reassures Jack that their reconciliation will not affect him in any way, only for her to tell Jack to lose the dance-off. Jack tells Karen he will not throw the competition. During the dance-off, Karen pleads with Jack to lose which Jack ultimately does. Believing he won, Artemus tells Karen he used her to win. After deciding that she only needs four dancers, Jackson fires both Jack and Artemus. At the end, Karen apologizes to Jack for getting him fired. Meanwhile, Grace (Debra Messing) copes with her failed marriage to Leo (Harry Connick, Jr.). She tries to move on, but mementos of the past do not let her. Her best friend Will (Eric McCormack) tries to help her but to no avail. While at dinner with his boyfriend Vince (Bobby Cannavale), and Vince's superior officer, Grace calls him, displeasing Vince. Believing that Grace might be suicidal, Will leaves to attend to her. Vince shows up at Will and Grace's apartment to confront her, telling her that she is affecting his relationship with Will because she is too needy. This prompts Grace and Vince to bicker, with the two asking Will to choose between them. He cannot choose between them as Grace is his long-time friend, but he also cares for Vince. The episode concludes with him telling Vince that he wants to work things out, but before they can discuss it, Vince sees Grace's wedding album, resulting in him being more focused on the album than the relationship.  Production  Janet Jackson guest starred in the episode. Her appearance received mixed reviews from critics. \\"Back Up, Dancer\\" was written by Tracy Poust and Jon Kinnally and directed by series producer James Burrows. It originally aired on NBC in the United States on September 23, 2004. It was confirmed in mid-2004 that singer Janet Jackson would guest star as herself on the television series Will & Grace. She recorded her lines in front of a live audience on August 17. Jackson's role in the show had been her first television acting role in nearly two decades. Jackson's last prime- time role was on NBC's Fame. She also appeared in the television shows Diff'rent Strokes and Good Times. In addition, Jackson's appearance came nine months after the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy. She told the entertainment news program Access Hollywood that she was a \\"big fan\\" of the show, and that she could not wait to join the cast for her stint. Also in this interview, she believed that Sean Hayes, who plays Jack, was a decent dancer. \\"I thought he studied dance. I really did, It's so funny. I have to catch myself because I'm cracking up in rehearsals. It's just funny to watch [the actors].\\" Jackson \\"had a tough time\\" on the set because she constantly messed up her lines. She admitted that it was not as easy as she had hoped it would be. \\"I flubbed my lines and got so frustrated when I made those mistakes. I haven't done TV since Different Strokes, and it's not like Saturday Night Live where you can read cue cards. On Will & Grace, they're always rewriting, so you're always memorising.\\" Jackson, however, said that the dancing was the \\"easy part of playing myself\\". It was also announced that actor Will Arnett would guest star, as Jack's dance rival. Alex Herschlag, executive producer of Will & Grace, revealed Arnett's subplot in the episode, saying that Hayes and Arnett are \\"vying for a job as Janet Jackson's backup dancer.\\" In an online chat session with the Los Angeles Times, Arnett revealed that the reason for his guest spot was due to knowing one of the writers of the show, and Arnett being friends with Hayes. In an April 2007 interview with The Advocate, Arnett said that he enjoyed doing his guest spot on the show.  Reception  According to the Nielsen system, \\"Back Up, Dancer\\" was watched by 15.32 million households in its original American broadcast. The episode received a 7.1 rating/19 share among viewers in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, and was the eighth highest-rated show on the NBC network that week. \\"Back Up, Dancer\\" finished in 13th place in the weekly ratings for the week of September 20‚Äì26, 2004. Since airing the episode has received mixed reviews from television critics. In preview of the episode, Phil Rosenthal of the Chicago Sun-Times said: \\"If you're going to book a former cast member from Good Times as a guest for your sitcom, do yourself a favor and try getting Jimmie Walker, John Amos or Ja'net Dubois before settling for Janet Jackson.\\" Scott D. Pierce of Deseret News reported that Jackson's appearance \\"takes the focus off the regular characters\\" while Mark Harris of Entertainment Weekly commented that Jackson's guest spot \\"was an all-time low\\". Gary Susman of Entertainment Weekly was complimentary towards Jackson, concluding that she was \\"all business, playing it straight\\" in the episode. He reported that \\"she makes a fabulous entrance and departs with her dignity intact\\". Charleston Daily Mail contributor Kevin McDonough wrote that in the season premiere episode \\"FYI: I Hurt, Too\\" of season seven, singer Jennifer Lopez appeared \\"in a farfetched and laugh-free guest appearance. Tonight ['Back Up, Dancer'], it's Janet Jackson's turn. At least she has sitcom experience.\\" In her annual countdown of the best quotes of 2004, Amy Amatangelo of Knight Ridder included Will Arnett's line \\"Like a Sicilian woman's eyebrows, we could not be kept apart\\". In March 2006, Entertainment Weekly named Jackson's guest spot as their number nine most memorable guest appearance on Will & Grace.

Chapoutier produces wine from appellations across the Rh√¥ne region, but it is typically their top Hermitage wines, both red and white, that receive the most attention and accolades. Chapoutier's wine labels are distinctive because of their inclusion of Braille writing on all labels since 1996.Chapoutier: Convictions . Retrieved February 8, 2010.  History  The Chapoutier family can trace their history in the Rh√¥ne region back to 1808, but it was in 1879 that Polydor Chapoutier bought his first vineyards and started the actual business. In the mid-20th century Max Chapoutier led the business, until his retirement in 1977, after which his sons Michel Chapoutier and Marc Chapoutier took over. Some years later, during the 1980s, quality improved, under Michel Chapoutier's leadership over the vineyards and winemaking facilities. By the late 1980s, Chapoutier had started to receive considerable international attention for the wines' quality.Chapoutier: The Maison M. Chapoutier .

Chapoutier produces wines from a range of appellations in northern and southern Rh√¥ne, as well as from some Roussillon appellations, and from collaborative projects in Portugal and Australia. The Chapoutier vineyards are all managed to produce biodynamic wines. A further characteristic of Chapoutier is a preference for single- variety wines, also from those appellations where blends are common. Thus, Chapoutier's C√¥te-R√¥ties are Syrah only (with no Viognier), the white Hermitages are all Marsanne only (with no Roussanne) and several of the Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Papes are Grenache noir only.

Braille labeling A Chapoutier Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape wine label with braille. Chapoutier was the first wine producer to introduce braille on its labels, starting in 1994 with the Monier de la Sizeranne Hermitage wine. By 1996 this was expanded to include all wines bottled and sold by the Chapoutier winery. Michel Chapoutier had the idea to include braille on the label after hearing his friend the singer Gilbert Montagn√©, who is blind, explaining on TV that he would have to take someone with him into the store in order to identify each bottle of wine. The Monier de la Sizeranne vineyard that Chapoutier now owns and makes wine from, was founded by the Sizeranne family and the first and subsequent braille printing on this wine is a tribute to that family and specifically a blind member of the family, Maurice de La Sizeranne who was the founder and president of the French Association for the Blind and also developed an abbreviated version of braille. The information presented in the braille print includes the producer, the vintage, the vineyard and region as well as the colour of the wine.

She had previously been a ship of the French Navy under the name Modeste. Launched in France in 1786, she served during the first actions of the French Revolutionary Wars until being captured while in harbour at Genoa, in circumstances disputed by the French and British, and which created a diplomatic incident. Taken into British service she spent the rest of the French Revolutionary and most of the Napoleonic Wars under the white ensign. She served with distinction in the East Indies, capturing several privateers and enemy vessels, including the French corvette I√©na. She also saw service in a variety of roles, as a troopship, a receiving ship, and a floating battery, until finally being broken up in 1814, as the Napoleonic Wars drew to a close. French service and capture Modeste was a Magicienne-class frigate built at Toulon between February 1785 and January 1787, having been launched there on 18 March 1786. In September 1793 she entered the neutral port of Genoa, where according to British reports, her captain was seized by the French Republican agent in the port, who suspected the frigate as having come from the Royalist- held Toulon on some secret mission. The British had been dissatisfied with the actions of the neutral Genoa, in allowing the Modeste and two French tartanes to 'insult' and 'molest' the frigate Aigle while she was also in Genoa. Furthermore the French were alleged to have seized a ship travelling under an assurance of safe passage from Lord Hood. The British envoy in Genoa, Francis Drake, was instructed to seek reparations from the Genoese, and to put a stop to the shipment of grain to the French Republicans. Drake was unsuccessful, so Hood sent Rear-Admiral John Gell to Genoa with orders to capture Modeste, the two tartanes and any other French ships. Drake was to secure assurances from the Genoese that they would comply with Hood's wishes, or failing that, Gell was to blockade the port. Gell was also to travel to Leghorn and capture the French frigate Imp√©rieuse, and instruct the British envoy to the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, Lord Hervey, to demand the expulsion of the French Jacobins. To back up these demands Gell had a squadron consisting of , the 74-gun ships , and the French Scipion, and the smaller vessels , , HMS ALerte, , , , and . The squadron entered Genoa on 17 October and Bedford ranged alongside Modeste. Accounts then differ as to what happened next. A later French account stated that the British ship had moored alongside, and her master had civilly requested the French ship remove a boat that was hampering the British manoeuvres. The French readily agreed, but half an hour later the British captain asked the French to hoist the white flag, saying that he did not know what the tricolour was. Offended, the French refused, whereupon the British suddenly attacked the unprepared French, and captured the frigate. One British account states that Bedford came alongside and after warning the French not to resist, captured her after a short struggle, while another stated that while the fort was saluting the arrival of Rear-Admiral Gell, the French on Modeste came up on deck and behaved with such insolent gestures and language that the British attacked them. The British reported that two Frenchmen had been killed during the fighting on the tartanes, while French sources alternately reported five dead, thirty wounded, or between 30 and 40 killed. The attack outraged the Genoese, who were being threatened both by Drake and by representatives of the French republic, and created a diplomatic incident. The Genoes finally bowed to French pressure and ordered the expulsion of all foreigners, with the exception of the French. The Genoese broke all diplomatic ties; in response Gell's squadron began to blockade Genoa, capturing neutral merchants bound for the city. British career Modeste was taken into service with the Royal Navy, retaining her original name, and was commissioned in November 1793 under Captain Thomas Byam Martin. After some service in the Mediterranean Martin sailed her back to Britain, arriving in Portsmouth on 4 December 1794. Modeste was then laid up, until being converted to a receiving ship in 1798, and was then fitted out between August and October 1799 to sail to the Thames. On arriving at Deptford in November she was fitted out as a troopship, a process that lasted until June 1800. She was commissioned in June that year under Commander Martin Hinton as a 24-gun troopship. She spent some time in the Mediterranean under Hinton in 1801. Because Modeste served in the navy's Egyptian campaign (8 March to 8 September 1801), her officers and crew qualified for the clasp \\"Egypt\\" to the Naval General Service Medal that the Admiralty authorised in 1850 for all surviving claimants. Soon she was back in Britain, being fitted out at Woolwich between September and October 1803 for service with Trinity House. The Navy next used her as a floating battery in 1804. Modeste then underwent a middling repair at Woolwich between April and November 1806 and was recommissioned in October that year under Captain George Elliot. Elliot departed Britain on 15 February 1807, bound for China and the East Indies. On 30 July Modeste arrived at Diamond Harbour, carrying Lord Minto who was coming to Calcutta to assume the position of Governor-General of India.The Asiatic Annual Register, Or, A View of the History of Hindustan, and of the Politics, Commerce and Literature of Asia, (1811), Volume 10, p.8. On 8 October 1808 Modeste chased down and captured the 18-gun French corvette I√©na while in the Bay of Bengal. I√©na, under the command of Captain Maurice, was bound for the Persian Gulf with despatches, and had captured several ships. When Modeste captured Iena she was carrying 25,000 dollars she had taken from a vessel named Swallow, and had also captured an Arab vessel named Frederick, which Elliot retook. I√©na had mistaken Modeste for another merchant vessel and had tried to close on her. On discovering her mistake she had tried to escape, but had been caught after a nine-hour chase and an exchange of fire that left four or five Frenchmen dead or wounded, and one man killed and one wounded on Modeste. Modeste sailed on to Macao, arriving in November. Her arrival helped induce the Chinese government at Canton to bring to an end an affair that had begun with a fracas between local Chinese and seamen from the East Indiaman in March. Modeste also detained a brig under Portuguese colours as the brig sailed out of the Typa, Macao's outer harbour. Elliot had information that the brig was actually Spanish. It was not yet settled whether the seizure of the brig would be adjudicated in China or at Bombay.The Asiatic Annual Register, Or, A View of the History of Hindustan, and of the Politics, Commerce and Literature of Asia, (1811), Volume 10, pp.33-4. On 28 January 1808 Modeste was back at Calcutta. News had been received of the outbreak of war between Great Britain and Denmark. Elliot sent his boats, together with those of and up the Hooghly River to Serampore to seize the Danish merchant vessels there.Seton- Karr & Sandeman (1868), Vol. 4, p.196. One of the captured vessels was Maria, which in November 1808 a prize court awarded to Modeste.The Asiatic Annual Register, Or, A View of the History of Hindustan, and of the Politics, Commerce and Literature of Asia, (1811), Volume 10, pp.101. On 15 July 1809 boats from Modeste and cut out the 8-gun Tuijneelar in the Sunda Straits. Elliot then took part in the operations to capture Java between August and September 1811. Elliot left Modeste in 1812, and was succeeded by Captain James Crawford, who on 6 February 1813 captured the 14-gun privateer Furet off Sicily. Fate Modeste was finally placed in ordinary at Woolwich in 1813. After a year in ordinary, she was broken up at Deptford in June 1814.

She was billed as \\"The Little Magnet\\" in recognition of her ability to attract and engage audiences. Due to her popularity, she was much sought-after by Tin Pan Alley publishers to boost sheet music sales. Songs particularly associated with Gilson include \\"The Sunshine of Paradise Alley\\", \\"The Little Lost Child\\", \\"The Sidewalks of New York\\", and \\"My Mother Was a Lady\\". Career She was born Lydia Deagon in Basel, Switzerland. Details of her early life are unknown including when she first came to the United States and when she made her stage debut. The first record of her performing is in 1884, at the Bowery's Old National Theatre, where she became a regular act. Her success at Old National led eventually to engagements at top New York theaters of the day: Tony Pastor's, Henry Miner's, and Hyde & Behman's. She was soon established as one of the top soubrettes of vaudeville. She appeared at Miner's Theatre and Tony Pastor's new 14th Street Theatre in Lower Manhattan and Hyde and Behman's Theater in Brooklyn. Like many vaudeville stars, Gilson was known not for her singing talent, but for her personality and showmanship. Her rapport with her audience and talent for attracting customers earned her the nickname \\"The Little Magnet\\", which became part of her billing. In the beginning, her act was mainly ballads and tear-jerkers; the sentimental ballad \\"The Sunshine of Paradise Alley\\" (1895) was especially identified with her. After a few years she expanded into bawdy comical songs, such as \\"You're Not the Only Pebble on the Beach\\" (1896). She pioneered methods of engaging the audience that were so widely copied they became cliches. One was the use of a hand-mirror to reflect the spotlight into the audience, shining it on likely male customers and thus making them a part of her act. The practice of cajoling the audience to sing along on the chorus was another of Gilson's trademarks. A staged variation of audience participation involved a teenage boy in the balcony‚Äîostensibly a customer, but really a shill‚Äîwho is suddenly inspired to sing with or to the performer. Gus Edwards was one such balcony-singer who contributed to Gilson's act. Gilson was also in the forefront of another vaudeville practice, taking money from Tin Pan Alley sheet music publishers to promote songs by including them in her act. Her popularity made her very attractive to publishers, who could be sure that songs would be heard and appreciated by a large audience when she sang them. According to publisher and songwriter E.B. Marks, Gilson could \\"draw tears from an audience with a perfectly vapid song\\". Marks's \\"The Little Lost Child\\" (1894) was one of the many successful songs plugged by Gilson. Her promotion also played a role in the success of \\"The Sidewalks of New York\\" (1894); she introduced it in her act at Miner's London Theatre in the Bowery, employing her method of encouraging the audience to sing along at the chorus. Death Lottie Gilson died June 10, 1912 in New York City.

Cases have been recorded since Homer's Iliad, composed approximately 8th century BC, and are widespread. Before the 17th century it was generally believed that the rain was actually blood. Literature mirrors cult practice, in which the appearance of blood rain was considered a bad omen. It was used as a tool foreshadowing events, but while some of these may be literary devices, some occurrences are historic. There is now a scientific consensus that the blood rain phenomenon is caused by aerial spores of green microalgae Trentepohlia annulata. Recorded instances of blood rain usually cover small areas. The duration can vary, sometimes lasting only a short time, others several days. By the 17th century, explanations for the phenomenon had moved away from the supernatural and attempted to provide natural reasons. In the 19th century, blood rains were scientifically examined, and theories that dust gave the water its red colour gained ground. Today, the dominant theories are that the rain is caused by red dust suspended in the water (rain dust) or by the presence of micro-organisms. Alternative explanations include sunspots and aurorae. History and use in literature Occurrences of blood rain throughout history are distributed from the ancient, to the modern day. The earliest literary instance is in Homer's Iliad, in which Zeus twice caused a rain of blood, on one occasion to warn of slaughter in a battle. The same portent occurs in the work of the poet Hesiod, writing around 700 BC; the author John Tatlock suggests that Hesiod's story may have been influenced by that recorded in the Iliad. The first-century Greek biographer Plutarch also recounts a tradition of a rain of blood during the reign of Romulus, founder of Rome. Roman authors Livy and Pliny record some later cases of blood rain, with Livy describing it as a bad portent. Unusual events such as a rain of blood were considered bad omens in Antiquity, and this belief persisted through the Middle Ages and well into the Early modern period. Throughout northern and western Europe there are many cases of rains of blood which were used by contemporary writers to augur bad events: the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records, \\"there was a bloody rain in Britain. And milk and butter were turned to blood. And Lothere, king of Kent, died\\". Tatlock suggests that although the Chronicle was written long after the events, it may have basis in historical truth. He notes that although the rain may seem to be foreshadowing the death of Lothere, medieval chroniclers often noted unusual occurrences in their works \\"merely for their general interest\\". Gregory of Tours records that in 582 \\"In the territory of Paris there rained real blood from the clouds, falling upon the garments of many men, who were so stained and spotted that they stripped themselves of their own clothing in horror\\". Although the work of Geoffrey of Monmouth, a 12th-century writer who popularised the legends of King Arthur, is regarded as \\"fantastical\\" rather than reliable, he too notes the occurrence of blood rain, in the reign of Rivallo. This event was further expanded on by Layamon in his poem Brut (written around 1190), who described how blood rain was one of several portents, and which itself led to destruction: Many works which record occurrences of blood rain, such as that of Layamon, were written significantly after the event was supposed to have taken place. The 14th-century monk Ralph Higden in his work, the Polchronicon, recounts that in 787 there was a rain of blood, perhaps intended by the author as an indication of the coming Viking invasion. Written in the 12th century, the Book of Leinster records many sensational events, including showers of silver; it records a shower of blood in 868. In the work of William of Newburgh, a rain of blood proves the drive and determination of Richard the Lionheart. According to William of Newburgh, a contemporary chronicler, in May 1198 Richard and the labourers working on the castle were drenched in a \\"rain of blood\\". While some of his advisers thought the rain was an evil omen, Richard was undeterred: In Germany, a shower of blood was one of several portents for the arrival of the Black Death in 1348‚Äì1349. The phenomenon gained exposure to a wide audience in the 16th century, during the Renaissance, when it was used as an example of the power of God; a form of literature using prodigies such as blood rain as cautions against immorality proliferated across Europe having originated in Italy. In Germany, such works were particularly popular amongst Protestants. Although unusual events such as rains of blood were still treated with superstition, often as demonstrations of godly power, Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc (1580‚Äì1637) was one of the few who proposed natural causes; after hearing of a bloody rain in Aix-en-Provence, he suggested it was caused by butterflies. Although his theory would later be rejected, he helped the likes of Pierre Gassendi and Ren√© Antoine Ferchault de R√©aumur to lay the foundations for removing superstition from explanations of the phenomenon. One of the first scientists who correctly explained this phenomenon was Giuseppe Maria Giovene (1753-1837). Blood rain fell on Apulia on 7 March 1803, and it was then believed that the rain was caused by the explosion of Italy's volcanoes Mount Vesuvius or Etna, or that it was due to the transport of matter coming from the sea floor and raised by vapor. Giuseppe Maria Giovene related the phenomenon to the wind which occurred prior to the rain event, and he came to the conclusion that the sand came from Africa and that it had been pushed by the wind coming from direction south-east.elogio-storico, pag. 20pioggia-rossa In Europe, there were fewer than 30 recorded cases all together of blood rain in the 13th, 14th, and 15th centuries. There were 190 instances across the 16th and 17th centuries; there was a decline in the 17th century when only 43 were recorded, but this picked up again with 146 in the 19th century. There is little literature on the subject of blood rain, although it has gained the attention of some naturalists. The phenomenon received international coverage in 2001, after red rain fell in Kerala, India, and again in 2012. in the Batman & Dracula trilogy Dracula through Alchemy does something to the Air of Gotham causing it to rain blood every once in a while and this goes on even after his death in the first story. Explanation Photomicrograph of particles from a sample of red rain from Kerala A 2015 studyBAST, F, BHUSHAN, S., JOHN A.A., ACHANKUNJU, J., PANIKKAR N.M.V., HEMETNER, C., AND STOCKER- W√ñRG√ñTTE, E. 2015 European Species of Subaerial Green Alga Trentepohlia annulata (Trentepohliales, Ulvophyceae) Caused Blood Rain in Kerala, India. J Phylogen Evolution Biol 3: 144 URL has unambiguously established that the cause of blood rain in Kerala was the aerial spores of green microalgae Trentepohlia. The study used molecular phylogenetics to compare the evolution of DNA sequence of T. annulata isolated from blood rain sample with that of T. annulata from Austria. Results suggest that the isolate from Kerala is, in fact, a recently introduced species from Austria. The research confirmed the likelihood that the introduction happened through clouds over the ocean, a phenomenon of intercontinental species dispersal previously reported for bacteria and fungi but not for an alga. Clouds over ocean dispersal is analogous to the intercontinental flights; spores of this alga from Europe are transported to India via clouds that drift across the Arabian Sea. Spores might have been carried first to the clouds for its dispersal. How exactly these lower stratospheric clouds containing algal spores got in Kerala remain unknown but it might be related to the monsoon as well, as Kerala is the first state that the southwest monsoon strikes together with Sri Lanka. Again, trade winds (SE and NE) converge at a region called the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), which is located close to Kerala and Sri Lanka, which might be another clue for this puzzle. Authors said their steps would be the analysis of intercontinental clouds using High-Efficiency Particulate Air Filters, using the similar DNA sequence based technique called ‚Äúmetagenomics‚Äù, which would reveal the entire microbial diversity of these clouds. While most ancient authors, such as Hesiod and Pliny, tended to ascribe the rain to the acts of gods, Cicero rejected the idea and instead suggested that the red rain may be caused by \\"ex aliqua contagione terrena\\", \\"from some earthly contagion\\". The two cases in the Iliad are explained by Heraclitus as simply red-coloured rain rather than literally blood; however, a later scholiast (a critical or explanatory commentator) suggests that it was precipitation of blood that had evaporated earlier: after a battle, blood would flow into nearby water courses, evaporate, and then fall as rain. This explanation, demonstrating unfamiliarity with the properties of distillation was echoed by Eustathius of Thessalonica, a 12th-century archbishop. Tatlock, in a study of some medieval cases of blood rain, notes that the medieval cases of blood rain \\"agree well\\" with their classical counterparts. Although there are variables (for example, the rain sometimes lasted only for a short period, while on other occasions, it could last days), they were widely considered to be bad omens and warnings of bad events to come. He also suggests that the phenomenon may be recorded only in small areas because the colour of the rain would not always be noticed and may be obvious against only pale backgrounds. In the classical period, events such as a shower of blood was seen a demonstration of godly power; in the medieval period, Christians were less inclined to attribute the phenomenon to such reasons although followers of nature- religions were happy to do so. In the 19th century, there was a trend towards examining events such as rains of blood more scientifically; Ehrenberg conducted experiments at the Berlin Academy, attempting to recreate \\"blood rain\\" using dust mixed with water. He concluded that blood rain was caused by water mixing with a reddish dust, mostly composed of animal and vegetable matter. He was unclear on the origin of the dust but stated that it lacked the characteristics of African dust that might have indicated it came from the Sahara Desert. Instead, he suggested that the dust came from dried swamps where it was picked up by violent winds and would later fall as rain. This explanation has persisted, and the Academic Press Dictionary of Science and Technology (1992) attributes the colour of blood rain to the presence of dust containing iron oxide. Other reasons for blood rain aside from dust are sometimes given. Schove and Peng-Yoke have suggested that the phenomenon may be connected to sunspots and aurorae. When red rain fell in Kerala, dust was the suspected cause. Alternative theories, later dismissed, included dust from a meteorite and extraterrestrial cells in the water. The particles causing the red colour in Kerala were later determined to be spores of the alga Trentepohlia annulata.

The ensuing combat in Delaware Bay, near Cape May, ended with an American victory over a superior British force. Background Twenty-three-year-old Lieutenant Joshua Barney of the Continental Navy commanded the privateer sloop Hyder Ally during the battles. She was owned by Pennsylvania business man, John Willcocks and was issued a letter of marque. The sloop-of-war was armed with sixteen 6-pounders and had a crew of about 110 men, officers and marines, and was named Hyder Ally after Hyder Ali, the ruler of the Kingdom of Mysore on the Indian subcontinent and a British enemy. Also with Lieutenant Barney were the privateer sloops Charming Sally, with ten guns, and the twelve-gun General Greene. Barney's first command was to escort a rebel fleet of five merchantmen to the Delaware Bay. During this cruise, three British ships were sighted and a battle began. British forces included the 32-gun frigate HMS Quebec under Captain Christopher Mason, the twenty-four gun sloop-of-war HMS General Monk under Captain Josias Rogers and a New York privateer brig named Fair American crewed by American loyalists. Fair American was the former American privateer General Washington, commanded by Silas Talbot at her capture. Battle A map of the Delaware Bay and surroundings At nightfall on April 7, 1782, the American convoy anchored within Cape May due to the wind which had died down to a calm. Later that night, the British in HMS Quebec and General Monk sighted the enemy fleet and anchored off the cape and made preparations to attack the Hyder Ally, which was considered the most formidable ship of the fleet. Unaware of the British vessels nearby, the Americans spent the night believing they were safe. The following morning three British privateers were spotted and Captain Mason signaled them to join him. Only the Brig Fair American responded. At 10:00 am the Americans sighted the British vessels approaching. Lieutenant Barney ordered the merchantmen to flee up the Delaware Bay under the protection of the General Greene and the Charming Sally while the Hyder Ally remained behind to engage the British. The fleet was directed to sail as close to the shoreline as possible so as not to allow a pursuit. The larger British vessels would have a hard time following in the shallow water. The General Greene disobeyed Barney's orders and prepared for battle, and the Charming Sally grounded on a shoal and was abandoned by her crew. At about 11:00 am the three British vessels were identified by the Americans. HMS Quebec stood off the nearby Cape Henlopen to prevent the Americans from escaping Cape May into the Atlantic, but this was unnecessary as the Americans were headed into the bay rather than into open sea. The Fair American led the advance with the General Monk behind. Sometime after 12:00 pm the British came within range of the two American privateers. To try to lure the General Monk closer, Lieutenant Barney turned about as if attempting to flee. The Fair American opened fire with a broadside followed by another; the shots were accurate but caused little damage. Still in a fake retreat, the Hyder Allys gun ports remained closed and no shots had yet been fired by the Continentals. The General Greene did the same as the Hyder Ally and turned around, but she grounded just outside British gun range. The trick worked; Fair American broke off the effort to attack the General Greene as HMS General Monk proceeded forward to attack the Hyder Ally. Fortunately for Continental forces, the Fair American grounded in shallow water, and was put out of the action permanently because of damage to her hull. Heading forward, Captain Rodgers decided to slow down and launch a boat to take the abandoned Charming Sally, after which he continued on until he caught up with the Hyder Ally. When within range of pistols, Captain Rodgers ordered her to surrender. Barney answered with a broadside of grape, canister and round shot which raked the deck of the British sloop, killing some sailors and marines. General Monk replied with her bow guns which were the only weapons bearing down on the Americans at the time. Joshua Barney, circa 1800 Barney ordered his ship to port and unleashed another broadside; these shots passed through the sails and rigging of the General Monk and damaged her main and top-gallant masts. Before the battle, the British bored their 6-pounders on the General Monk to fire 9-pound balls. This proved fatal when the British came within a few yards off 'the 'Hyder Allys beam for a full broadside of their own. When they fired, the General Monks cannons were torn up from the deck and flipped over. Several sailors burned themselves as they tried to right the cannons. A few minutes later the two sloops had drifted close enough to each other that the British and Americans could hear each other shouting commands. Barney took the opportunity to reload his cannon but he did not give his gunners the order to open fire. Instead the lieutenant shouted \\"hard a-port, do you want him to run abroad of us,\\" another trick. Hearing this, Captain Rodgers ordered his ship to port as Lieutenant Barney ordered his vessel to starboard. As a result, the two vessels collided and became entangled in each other's rigging. The American sailors fastened the General Monk to their ship to prevent her from breaking loose and then fired their broadside. The shots knocked out some of the British guns and sent the crew into confusion. The American marines sat high in the rigging of the Hyder Ally and poured musket fire into the British. Barney's men boarded while he remained on top of the compass box to direct the attack. About this time the box was shot out from under the lieutenant but he suffered only a slight injury. Barney also ordered that his port-side guns be turned around to the starboard so they could assist in the battle. After only twenty-six minutes of close-quarters combat, Captain Rodgers was wounded and all of his officers were killed except a midshipman who struck the colors. A total of twenty Britons died and thirty-three were wounded. The General Monk was captured and the Fair American was aground and stranded so Captain Mason in HMS Quebec fled without actually engaging in the fight. American forces suffered the loss of four killed and eleven wounded. The Charming Sally was captured without a fight, the Hyder Ally was damaged considerably, and the General Greene was grounded but re-floated after HMS Quebec began her retreat. Aftermath The Americans won the day and Lieutenant Joshua Barney was given command of the prize HMS General Monk which had well over 300 shot-holes in her sides. Barney sailed both Hyder Ally and Monk to Chester, Pennsylvania where he left Hyder Ally and sailed on to Philadelphia in Monk. He was then ordered to France to deliver dispatches to Benjamin Franklin. After the war ended Barney joined the French Navy. During the War of 1812, Barney was a captain and commanded the Chesapeake Bay Flotilla and later commanded marines and sailors at the Battle of Bladensburg.

It was discovered on November 24, 2002 by M. R. Zapatero Osorio and E. L. Martin's team at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory. It has yet to be determined if it is a field brown dwarf or a 3-million-year-old planet that is part of a cluster. Near-infrared spectroscopy images taken 3 years after its discovery led to the first motion measurements for the object. Its behavior is significantly different from what may be expected; it was further described as either a low-gravity atmosphere or an atmosphere with metallicity. The object's small proper motion suggests that it is farther away than expected if it were a single field T dwarf. Discovery The œÉ Orionis open cluster has been the focus of Osorio's team observations due to the age of the cluster (approximately 3 to 8 million years). The cluster also has low extinction, its distance is convenient, and it is observed to be rich and dense. Using the William Herschel Telescope in a pencil-beam deep mini-survey measuring 55 square minutes of arc at a sensitivity of 21 magnitudes in the J and H Bands allowed the team to find S Ori 70. The raw data collected was reduced to IRAF (an acronym for Image Reduction and Analysis Facility), a standard technique used with near-infrared images; after subtracting the sky background and dark current, an extracted object spectrum was derived. It was the faintest and coolest member found in the cluster and was named S Ori 70. Argument of the initial study Adam J. Burgasser examined the claims of Osorio's T-type brown dwarf discovery and its spectroscopically verified low- mass. A comparison of the J band spectrum between S Ori 70 and other field objects was done. The J band spectrum revealed a distinct triangular-shaped spectral morphology which was previously explained by Osorio and Martin was due to the surface's low gravity. In order to see if similar discrepancies occurred in the T dwarf's behavior, Burgasser's team compared data from the claims of Osorio to that of standard COND models. Identical wavelength scales interpolated through both empirical and model spectra were Gaussian smoothed; this showed that best-fit spectral models can yield skewed gravities for late- type field T dwarfs which resulted in the underestimation of age and mass. Burgasser concluded that S Ori 70 is not a member of the Sigma Ori cluster but is rather a foreground field brown dwarf. Further study of the object suggest that the low gravity was not from the field T dwarf but rather a nearby background star. As of 2009 no direct scientific data have dispelled nor confirmed either conclusion. It could be the first \\"free floating\\" non-stellar planet discovered with a mass of 3 MJupiter, but needs confirmation.

Biography Elizabeth Dickerson was born in 1871 to Julia Armentine (Pratte) Dickerson and Col. John M. Dickerson. Her father died eight months later, and in 1874, her mother remarried, to Col. William Gilpin, who had served as the first governor of the Territory of Colorado in 1861. The family moved to Denver. Elizabeth was trained as a singer as well as a pianist and violinist. After graduating from St. Mary's Academy, she toured Europe. On her return, she married Otis Spencer, a lawyer. Spencer began her career singing in local churches, concerts, clubs, and amateur theatricals. By 1905, she had a successful solo show at the local Orpheum Theatre, a vaudeville venue. This and other engagements led to roles on Broadway, and by 1910 she had moved to New York. Spencer signed an exclusive contract to record for Thomas Edison, and she is today best known for these early recordings on which she sang solos, as well as taking part in duets, trios, quartets, and choruses. Her recordings for Edison Standard Records extended from around 1910 until 1916 and amounted to over 660 sessions, more than any other vocalist for the company.UCSB Cylinder Preservation Project (accessed 8 February 2010). She recorded on both phonograph cylinders and a later Diamond Disc format, and her best recordings are on the latter, which more accurately reproduced her voice. She also participated in demonstrations of recording fidelity arranged by Edison in which she sang along with a phonograph under dim lighting, and the audience had to guess when she stopped singing and the phonograph took over completely. After Spencer's contract with Edison ended in 1916, she moved to Victor, but had returned to Edison by 1920. Her recordings tail off in the 1920s. 1913 recording of Spencer singing \\"I Love You, California\\" Spencer's voice is noted for its sterling operatic quality combined with ability to sing in the vernacular.See, e.g., the inset 1911 Edison recording of her singing \\"Just Awearyin' for You\\" (words by Frank Lebby Stanton, music by Carrie Jacobs-Bond). Cf. Spencer's 1914 duet with Walter Van Brunt on (accessed 10 February 2010). Spencer died in Montclair, New Jersey, in 1930. She was inducted into the Colorado Music Hall of Fame in 2016.

The Council emphasised its position to hold free and fair elections under the supervision of the United Nations in Namibia in accordance with Resolution 435 (1978). As a first step, it requested the Secretary-General Javier P√©rez de Cu√©llar to arrange a formal ceasefire between the South West Africa People's Organization and South Africa, calling upon the latter to substantially reduce its police forces in Namibia with a view to balance the remainder with the monitoring United Nations Transition Assistance Group. The resolution also asked all parties to impartially implement the resolution, and for the Secretary-General to report back at the earliest possible date on developments since the adoption of the current resolution, and also to investigate cost- saving measures, further asking Member States to consider what assistance they could provide to the newly independent Namibia. Resolution 629, with the breakdown of the bi-polar system in the Council, was drafted by the five permanent members of the Security Council, illustrating a shift in governance which allowed the permanent members to consult informally outside the Council chambers on a wide range of issues.

Connelly introduced Haller in his bestselling 2005 novel The Lincoln Lawyer and then paired him with LAPD detective Harry Bosch, his half-brother, in 2008's The Brass Verdict. In 2009's 9 Dragons, Haller was a secondary character as Bosch's personal lawyer. The Reversal was published in the United States on October 5, 2010. Plot summary Mickey Haller, who has become increasingly frustrated in his role as a defense lawyer, agrees to undertake the prosecution role on behalf of the city of Los Angeles, in the retrial of a convicted kidnapper and killer that had been granted as a result of new DNA evidence. His one condition before accepting the task is that he is permitted to choose his own team; he chooses his ex-wife Maggie McPherson as his co-prosecutor, and his half-brother Harry Bosch as his investigator from the LAPD. The prosecution case rests largely on the testimony of Sarah Gleason, the elder sister of the victim, Melissa Landy. The body of 12-year- old Melissa was discovered in 1986, discarded in a dumpster, only a few hours after she was reported missing. Unknown to the killer, her older sister Sarah had been hiding in the garden and had witnessed her abduction. On the day of the murder, she identified Jason Jessup, a truck driver, as the man who snatched Melissa from the garden. The evidence against Jessup also includes strands of Melissa's hair, found in the seat of his truck. Thus, her testimony is essential for establishing the quick police focus on Jessup. However, DNA evidence subsequently showed that semen stains found on the dress Melissa was wearing, which could not be definitely matched at the time, came not from Jessup, but from the girls' stepfather. Jessup's defense counsel, \\"Clever Clive\\" Royce, mounts a media campaign in his client's favour, and it becomes clear that his main motivation is obtaining a sizable compensation payout from the state. Haller's response is to allow bail and have Jessup tailed by the police in the hope that he will return to his old ways and provide additional support for the prosecution case. Jessup is soon seen visiting various mountain trails in the Mulholland area, and on one occasion parks his car outside Bosch's house at night. Bosch and Haller, both concerned for their own teenage daughters' safety, develop a theory that Jessup was a serial killer but are unable to investigate fully for fear of blowing the police's cover. Legal procedures require that the jury is kept ignorant of Jessup's post- conviction history. Testimony given in the original trial, where the witness is no longer available because of death or infirmity, has to be read aloud to the jury by Harry Bosch, but the key to the case is still Sarah Gleason's testimony. During direct examination, Sarah admits that the dress Melissa was wearing was hers and that her stepfather was raping her, which accounted for the semen stains. The defense focuses on presenting the stepfather as the real killer and Jessup as the victim of the family's lies. To undermine Sarah's testimony, because of her history of drug use and prostitution in the years since her sister's murder (though she has now been rehabilitated), Haller concludes that \\"Clever Clive\\" must have a witness who will claim that Sarah had told a different story during her \\"lost years.\\" Bosch then traces Sarah's then-lover, Eddie Roman, and finds that he has remained a drug addict living off a prostitute's earnings but has disappeared, presumably to testify against Sarah. Locating Roman's current prostitute Sonia Reyes, Bosch persuades her to enter the courtroom at a crucial moment in Roman's testimony, which causes Roman to alter his testimony and effectively destroys the defense case. While anticipating a plea bargain offer from the defense team during a lunch break, Bosch and Haller instead learn that Jessup entered Royce's offices with a gun and killed Royce, two of his legal team and a policeman who followed him. Jessup is now at large, but the police surround and kill him at a hideout under the Santa Monica pier that had been discovered by Bosch as a result of the police surveillance activities. Jessup's death ends the search for Melissa Landy's killer, but leaves the prosecution team with a host of unanswered legal and moral questions.

Henri Pourrat (7 May 1887 in Ambert (Puy de Dome) ‚Äì 16 July 1959 in Ambert) was a French writer and anthropologist who collected the oral literature of the Auvergne. Biography  After attending the College d'Ambert and the Lycee Henri IV in Paris, Henri Pourrat was destined to pursue a career in agriculture and was admitted at the Institut National Agronomique Paris-Grignon in 1905. However, due to an infection with tuberculosis, he sought a more healthy climate in the valleys of Monts Dore and in the Livradois and Forez regions, which he would roam in countless hikes over the next fifty years. He lived in a house at Vernet-la-Varenne. The enforced leisure, spent with reading and walking, developed in him the need to write. The work of Henri Pourrat would eventually comprise hundreds of books, including novels, biographies, collections of stories and poems. From 1916 on he and his brother Paul were friends with the young Alexander Vialatte (1901‚Äì1971). In 1948 he permanently settled in the sub-prefecture Ambert of the Puy-de-D√¥me department from which he originated. In 1926 he received an honorary degree of the University of Dublin. He obtained special recognition by the literary critics for his monumental The Valor, pranks and adventures of Jasper of the mountains (4 volumes, 1921‚Äì1931 and final edition in one volume by Albin Michel), for which he was awarded the Prize Figaro (1921, Volume 1) and the Grand Prix du Roman of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise (1931 overall).

Far from the narrow context of regionalism, Auvergne folk tales for him were the best place to discover and understand the nature and spirit of the farmer and thereby \\"attain the universal.\\" He devoted almost twelve to thirteen years of his life to sift through the monumental treasure of tales to which he attached great importance. Many of his works were illustrated by his friend (13 February 1890 ‚Äì 30 May 1974), the brother of Jean Angeli (also Jean l'Olagne, 1886‚Äì1915), a childhood friend of Henry Pourrat.

The choice being made always has a reference point or origin on which the purchasing criteria is made. The core idea can also be answered by the question what business are we in?? Along with the core brand two more brands exist i.e. affiliate brand and periphery brand. Affiliate brand is closely associated with the core idea and represents a close approximation or facsimile to the core brand. Periphery brand represents a distant offering that maintains some resemblance to the original core idea.  Three strategic choices for maintaining brand legacy  Depending on the landscape of the industry or business the organization have three strategic choices for maintaining brand legacy: 1\\\\. Embrace ‚Äì It means returning to the roots and leveraging the heritage of the core idea. VW's Beetle and Ford's Mustang are best examples for embracing their brand legacy. They took the original car concept and modernized the design to include conveniences and amenities that the buying public would demand. The brand legacies instilled in the Beetle and Mustang are more than just names or symbols, they represent a legend or storyline that consumers can follow. Transformers by embracing its legacy was able to build upon its mythology and make each individual generation feel that it uniquely belongs to them. 2\\\\. Discard ‚Äì It means to leave back the old business idea and develop something new which itself will become a legacy. Intel did it when it discarded its business of DRAM chips and moved to development of microprocessors. Today almost all the world's computers are driven by Intel microprocessors. It brought out its Intel Inside campaign to boost its new core brand position. 3\\\\. Reinvent ‚Äì It is midway between embrace and discard where new ways are being found out to leverage the brand legacy. In 1990 when Discovery Channel was facing stiff competition with the new reality TV shows it reinvented itself by expanding its program content and brought up reality shows like American Chopper, Monster Garage and MythBusters. It brought younger viewers to cable network and helped in producing outstanding documentaries and news features. Chris Zook in his book Profit from the Core stated that narrowing the focus and strengthening the core values will drive top and bottom line results and only after the core is strong the organization should venture to an adjacent business as growth strategy. Brand heritage is an asset in building long term brand reputation, but equally, brands must adapt and recognize that the market is changing and expect brand evolution. Change is inevitable and customers are invariably fickle, so brand owners should never assume that brand legacy alone is enough to survive the test of time.  The other side of the coin  Legacy brands are predicated on top-down, command and control models which position the customer as a passive commodity, purely to be sold to. Legacy brands are vulnerable to competitors who create active partnerships with customers to innovate on brand, elevating customers from ‚Äúcommodities‚Äù to value co-creators. Emergent industries may supplant legacy brands in terms of market share of medium without extinguishing their predecessors user base. For example, news as a service may be consumed in multiple incarnations. These include but are not limited to digital, physical print, television and radio waves. The primary channel of consumption is not mutually exclusive to its relative competition. In fact, successful brands may use multiple mediums and create a network of complementary auxiliary products.

B. Falls. It was published in 1951 and was a Newbery Honor recipient in 1952. In the book, Elizabeth Chesley Baity talks about the history of the tribes of people in South and Meso-Americas from the time of the Ice Age when they crossed the Bering Strait up until Spain's arrival. The author gives insight through the archaeologists findings on how each individual culture of American Indian lived, what their history was and what became of them. Focusing on the Aztecs, the Mayans, the Iroquois, the Incas and the different important builders and people throughout the continents, she teaches about each individual group and compares them to the readers modern life. Though some of the information is outdated now, it is inundated with information and written for children to begin them on the path towards history and archaeology. Summary Americans Before Columbus begins with discussing the Ice Age and how humans crossed the Bering Strait and reached the New World and the reason archeologists were able to figure this out was because of the art the people created while passing through; such as cave art, baskets and stone weapons. Then after hundreds of years of spreading out across the continents in the western hemisphere, each group began to remain sedentary, so cultures such as the eskimos up north, the cliff dwelling basket makers in the Rocky Mountains, the citadel hunter/gatherers in Mexico or the Incas in the south began to gain different customs and social behaviors such as religion, hierarchies and ways of maintaining one's home and group. Through the work assembled by the patient and tireless efforts of the excavators, scientists, photographers and artist, Elizabeth Baity creates a book that goes into great deal explaining the process of how those ancient cultures came to be, and how modern day people were able to discover and learn about them.

Set deep within the mountains of Siberia, the novel is about an ostracized shepherd who defends the mountain rams from hunters.

While on coming back from his usual fishing and hunting round he hears crying and decides to help he goes inside the yurt to see 2 children. The eldest one Tim approached Turgen and with all his kindness stayed to tend to the youngest child Aska as she was only but an infant. As time past Marfa the mother of the children came from working to see Turgen tending to her children rather than being angry she was just surprised to find him in her home. As it turns out one of the people who didn't listen to the shamans words was Marfa's late husband who left marfa with some enlightening information that turgen was a kind man that helped anyone that needed and that the shaman only spoke lies and this was proven to her as she came to see him tending to her children. From that point he frequently dropped by to see Marfa and he children bringing them meats, and salts to make sure that marfa did not need to work so hard and with that she was able to spend more time with her children. With these visits Turgen's story about his past affiliation with the rams on how he hunted them for sport and that cause great sorrow in him to see these creatures being hunter for their horns and meats even though they were minding their own business.

With the help of Marfa and her children he was able to lead the rams to safety while being watched by the hunter they threaten his life because of his acrions. This is when Marfa stood up and pleaded to hunter to listen to reason and why Turgen had see the rams through. As they listen they were reminded of the shamans words and ignored er words this is when Turgen stood and talk sense to the hunter and told them how the shamans words should not be headed since he was visited by spirit for helping the rams as the Lamut were very religious they believed a spirit haunted Turgen and now believed he was free since the rams were gone.

Born in Bo'ness, Scotland, he started his professional career in the Football League, helping Watford to the Third Division title, and then spending three seasons at Sheffield United. After a second spell at Watford, he joined Tampa Bay Rowdies in the North American Soccer League. He was their second highest goalscorer in his first season, and in both years was named in the league's second All-star team. Scullion briefly returned to England with Wimbledon, before finishing his professional career in America with the Portland Timbers.  Early life  Scullion moved to England from his hometown of Bo'ness, West Lothian aged 13. He attended Bourne Secondary School in Ruislip, and worked as a clerk for British European Airways.  Playing career   Football League  Scullion started his football career at amateur club Chesham United, who at that time played in the Athenian League. He joined Football League side Charlton Athletic as an amateur in November 1964, turning professional three months later. However, Scullion did not play a league game for Charlton, and in February 1966 he was signed by Watford manager Ken Furphy in a deal that saw Cliff Holton move in the opposite direction. On 25 January 1969, Scullion scored the opening goal in a 1‚Äì1 draw against Manchester United in the Fourth Round of the FA Cup at Old Trafford. He also played in the replay on 3 February. Watford lost 2‚Äì0, but set their highest ever attendance of 34,099. At the end of the 1968‚Äì69 season, Watford were promoted as champions. Scullion remained at the club for two further seasons, before being sold to Sheffield United for ¬£25,000 in May 1971. The season after Scullion's departure, Watford were relegated, winning only 5 of their 42 league games in the 1971‚Äì72 season. During his two and a half years in Sheffield, Scullion played 57 league games, scoring 7 goals, before being sold back to Watford for ¬£15,000 in December 1973.

He was also named in the 1975 NASL All-star second team. Following this success, Scullion transferred to Tampa from Watford permanently for ¬£8,000 in February 1976. He helped the 1976 indoor Rowdies win the NASL's Spring indoor tournament. In his second season, he scored 10 times in 24 appearances, with Tampa winning the Eastern Division Atlantic Conference, and Scullion again being named in the All-star second team. He returned to England for the 1976‚Äì77 season with Wimbledon, before returning to the USA to play for Portland Timbers. After his first of three seasons (1977-1979) at the Timbers, Scullion played for English non-league side Hayes, and returned there briefly in 1981‚Äì82.

It was renamed in 2015 from Meldon Quarry railway station.http://www.dartmoor- railway-sa.org/news  History  The station was originally constructed circa 1920 as Meldon Quarry Halt by the London and South Western Railway. This station had no public access and merely functioned as a staff halt for quarry workers, their families and other railway staff working at Meldon Quarry. The quarry originally had no metalled road access and some quarry workers and their families lived in cottages situated near the quarry. They used the halt for access to Okehampton. The halt was not shown in the public railway timetable and local passenger services would only call by special arrangement. A workmen's service from Okehampton also operated using a passenger coach attached to one of the ballast trains. The platforms of the halt were constructed using standard components manufactured at the Railway's own Concrete Works at Exmouth Junction. The platforms were very narrow and short, about the length of a single passenger coach. They were situated at the immediate east end of Meldon Viaduct, between the viaduct and Meldon Quarry signal box.Nicholas, John & Reeve, George (2001) The Okehampton Line. Clophill: Irwell Press The Beeching Report in 1963 recommended that the Exeter to Plymouth Line be cut back to Okehampton; and when services ceased between there and Bere Alston in 1968, the Halt became disused. Some time later both platforms were demolished during modifications to the rail layout and access at the western end of Meldon Quarry. , North Tawton, Sampford Courtenay and Okehampton lost their passenger services from 1972. But freight traffic continued on the line thanks to the activities of the British Rail ballast quarry at Meldon, three miles from Okehampton, which had an output of 300,000 tons per year. The quarry and railway are now owned by Aggregate Industries. The quarry is currently out of use and 'mothballed'.  Reopening  Train at Meldon Viaduct Station A new station at Meldon Quarry was opened during 2000 by Dartmoor Railway to act as the terminus of a passenger service from Okehampton. It has a single platform adjacent to the former up line but situated slightly nearer to Okehampton than the former Staff Halt. It is an entirely new construction unrelated to the previous Halt. The station was further improved in 2002 with the installation of concrete platform walling and a wooden platform shelter in BR Southern Region style and colour scheme. In 2015 the station was renamed Meldon Viaduct.http://www.dartmoor-railway- sa.org/news It is the current western terminus of Dartmoor Railway heritage passenger services to Okehampton and Sampford Courtenay. The station has no motor vehicle access but does have excellent pedestrian and cycle access via The_Granite_Way Cycleway, part of Devon_Coast_to_Coast_Cycle_Route., and has links to Dartmoor via the local footpath network. There is a buffet situated near the station in a former SR electric multiple unit buffet car. The car overlooks Meldon Viaduct and the surrounding valleys.

The gun turrets were protected by armor and had roofs thick. Construction and career Gueydon was named in honour of Louis Henri de Gueydon, first governor of Algeria under the 3rd Republic. She was commissioned in Toulon harbour in 1903, and undertook a first campaign to East Asia. She took part in the First World War, supervising patrols in Southern America and in the Caribbean. In 1923, she was refitted in Brest harbour. In 1926, she was again modified to serve as a gunnery school; she entered this role the following year, replacing the armoured cruiser Pothuau in Brest. In 1941, her hull was used by the Germans (with two old French sloops) to form the basis for a decoy-dummy of the Prinz Eugen. The hulk of Gueydon was bombed by aircraft from the RAF's 617 Squadron on 13 and 14 August 1944, along with the other hulks at Brest, to prevent them from being used by the Germans as blockships. The wreck was broken up after the end of the war.

Since it is an hour-long episode, it is considered to be the 17th and 18th episodes in the season's episode count. It is the 117th and 118th episode overall. The series‚Äîpresented as if it were a real documentary‚Äîdepicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In this episode, Pam starts having contractions but insists on waiting till midnight to go to the hospital in order to get an extra night at the hospital, irritating Jim. The office tries to distract her with food and entertainment. She eventually goes to the hospital and gives birth to a daughter, Cecelia Marie Halpert. Meanwhile, Michael, inspired by the success of Pam and Jim's relationship, sets up Erin with Kevin. Dwight, sent over to find Pam's iPod, discovers mold in Pam and Jim's house and remodels their entire kitchen, and also considers entering a pre-natal contract with ex-girlfriend Angela, for he feels he needs a baby for business reasons. Part one is written by Daniel Chun and directed by Seth Gordon, while part two is written by Charlie Grandy and directed by Harold Ramis. The episode received mixed reviews from critics and came first in its time slot, helping NBC be the third highest-rated network of the night. Synopsis Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) and Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) both acquire sales while making small talk about their baby's upcoming birth. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) wants to do the same and asks Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) to have a baby with him. Angela is initially excited, but gets annoyed with Dwight making a parenting contract with absurd demands he wants her to agree to. Michael Scott (Steve Carell) anxiously waits for Pam and Jim's baby to be born; Jim urges Pam to let him take her to the hospital, but Pam would rather wait until midnight like she and Jim wanted to do initially (arriving after midnight means a longer hospital stay under the terms of their health insurance). She finds comfort in watching the rest of the office performing absurd activities to distract her from the pain. When Jim reaches his breaking point, Pam reveals that their baby is a girl, which calms Jim's nerves a bit, but then she tells him that her water broke. Since Pam and Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) have gotten hungry at the same times, they have enjoyed regular meals together, and Kevin prepares her one final \\"Ultra Feast\\" before she gives birth. When the contractions appear to become too extreme, Jim, Michael, and Kevin all think it is time for her to go to the hospital. Pam still refuses, and finally breaks down admitting she is too scared to give birth. Jim initially assures her that everything will be all right, but goes into a panic when he's informed she is now at 2 minutes in between contractions (5‚Äì7 minutes is the suggested time to leave for the hospital). Pam finally acquiesces and Michael drives her and Jim to the hospital, with Dwight \\"escorting\\" them. Pam realizes she has forgotten her iPod with her desired birth music on it so they request that Dwight retrieve it from their house, asking that he not \\"touch anything\\". After 19 hours of labor Cecelia Marie Halpert is born at 1:21 pm, weighing in at 7 lbs 2oz. Pam's breastfeeding does not go well, and though a male lactation consultant (Lee Kirk) is summoned to provide apparently successful coaching, Cecelia still fails to \\"latch\\" properly. Against the advice of the nurse, Jim and Pam opt to have Cecelia spend the night with them instead of in the nursery, and they are kept up long hours tending to her. A sleep-deprived Pam accidentally nurses a baby that belongs to a new mom (Melissa Rauch) in the same hospital room. As Jim and Pam get ready to leave the hospital, Pam manages to breast feed Cecelia while Jim gets the car (which is littered with parking tickets, thanks to Michael parking the car in an ambulance only zone). Michael sees the birth as proof that he is a successful office matchmaker. He sets up Kevin on a lunch date with Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), making Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) jealous. Though Kevin thinks the lunch goes well, Michael rudely tells Kevin that he is not good enough to date Erin, infuriating and confusing Kevin as Michael told Kevin that Erin liked him. Kevin also points out that Michael has dated women that appeared to be better than him. Eventually, Andy finally considers actually asking Erin out himself, to which she happily accepts as Michael looks on. At the Halpert residence, Dwight embarks on a search for the iPod only to find mold under the sink and moves in for several days while he reconstructs the cabinets. Dwight and Angela make the final revisions to the parenting contract, but Dwight begins to have second thoughts after an encounter with Pam's friend Isabel (Kelen Coleman), with whom he had a one night stand at Jim and Pam's wedding. He signs the contract, but decides to hold it off. Jim and Pam arrive home with the baby and find Dwight and their wrecked house, but decide not to question it. Production The first part of the episode was written by Daniel Chun his second writing credit for the series after \\"Murder\\" and directed by Seth Gordon his second directing credit for the series after \\"Double Date\\". The second part was written by Charlie Grandy, his fourth writing credit of the series and directed by Harold Ramis, who also directed \\"A Benihana Christmas,\\" \\"Safety Training\\" and \\"Beach Games.\\" The episode also guest stars Nelson Franklin playing Nick the IT Administrator who would appear in later episodes and Linda Purl who played Helene, Pam's mother who previously dated Michael. Reception In its original American broadcast, part one of \\"The Delivery\\" was watched by 8.71 million viewers, with a 4.5 rating and a 12 share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, with part two increasing in viewers to 9.35 million and a 4.9 rating and a 13 share winning its timeslot both times and helping NBC come third ahead of ABC and The CW. The episode ranked 10th in the weekly 18‚Äì49 ratings and ranked 24th in total viewers weekly ratings.Seidman, Robert (March 9, 2010) TVbythenumbers Retrieved June 12, 2010 It was the last episode of The Office to be viewed by over 9 million viewers. Dan Phillips of IGN gave the episode a 6.6 saying that Pam's lactation problems and Kevin's lack of personality while dating Erin made consistently amusing plots, \\"But sadly everything that the episode's half-hour gets right doesn't make up for the painfully uncomfortable and largely unfunny first half.\\" He particularly objected to the length that Pam's refusal to go to the hospital is stretched out, since the entire office supporting her irrational decision even after her water breaks was \\"uncomfortable and unbelievable\\". Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a positive review saying \\"Last night managed to combine a thoroughly believable and funny central idea‚Äîthat Pam would try to delay going to the hospital to get some extra time, gaming the office‚Äôs ‚Äústupid HMO‚Äù‚Äîwith a batch of fine Michael scenes and a thoroughly didn‚Äôt-buy-it-for-a-second Dwight subplot.\\" Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+ saying \\"It felt a little padded and implausible and lurched from one radically different tone to another but it was also very funny and intriguingly prickly and real when it wasn't being cartoonish and over the top. It wasn't a home run.\\" Joel Keller of TV Squad gave the episode a mixed review saying \\"As usual with most one-hour 'Office' episodes, the first half was better than the second. But even the first half of this one had some problems\\".Keller, Joel (March 17, 2009) http://www.tvsquad.com/2010/03/04/the-office-the-delivery-recap/ TV Squad Retrieved June 10, 2010 References External links * \\"The Delivery\\" at NBC.com   Category:2010 American television episodes Category:The Office (American season 6) episodes Category:The Office (American TV series) episodes in multiple parts ","title":"The Delivery (The Office)"},{"id":"26121940","text":"United Nations Security Council resolution 632, adopted unanimously on 16 February 1989, after reaffirming resolutions 431 (1978), 435 (1978) and 629 (1989), the Council endorsed a report by the Secretary-General Javier P√©rez de Cu√©llar concerning the United Nations plan for Namibia, reiterating its legal authority over the territory until its independence.

He was a son of Queen Mahidevi.Asni inscription Mahipala I was also known by the names: Ksitipala, Vinayakapala, Herambapala and Uttarapatha Swami. Reign It seems that Indra III's campaign did not influence Kannauj much and Mahipala I soon revived Kannauj as court poet Rajasekhara calls him Maharajadhiraja of Aryavarta. According to KavyamimansaKavyamimansa of Rajasekhara, ch. XVII, P. 94 of Rajasekhara, Mahipala's reign extended from the upper course of the river Bias in the north-west to Kalinga or Orissa in the south-east, and from the Himalayas to the Kerala or Chera country in the far south. That Mahipala occupied territories up to Narbada is evident from Partabgarh inscription, which provides information about his son Mahendrapala II ruling at Ujjain in 946. R. S. Tripathi asserts that as Mahendrapala II is not credited with any achievements so Mahipala I must be the king who recovered Ujjain. The closing days of Mahipala's reign were disturbed by attacks by the Rashtrakutas on northern India as the Deoli and Karhad plates of Krisna III, while praising his achievement in the style of an inflated panegyric, inform that by hearing conquest of southern regions, the hope about Kalanjara and Citrakuta vanished from the heart of the Gurjara. Arab chronicler Al-Masudi describes Mahipala I as follows: > \\"The ruler has four armies according to the four quarters of the wind. Each > of these number 700,000 or 900,000 men. He has large armies in the garrisons > in the north and in the south; in the east and in the west, for he is > surrounded on all sides by warlike rulers.\\" Mahipala I, whom Kannada poet Pampa expressly calls \\"Gurjararaja\\", carried forward the work of his ancestors. Dharanivaraha, a Chapa or Chavda ruler ruling at Vardhamana (now Wadhwan in Surashtra region of Gujarat) was a feudatory of Mahipala, which is mentioned in his grant dated 914.

Historically in Lancashire and part of Ancoats, it has taken a separate identity to reflect its changed status as a regeneration area. History The name \\"New Islington\\" is recorded at least as early as 1817 and appeared on the 1840 Ordnance Survey map. There is also a street bearing the name. The name was still current in the 1960s and 70s, there being at the time, a New Islington swimming baths, New Islington Primitive Methodist church, and New Islington Conservative club. However, the name for the area fell out of usage. From its attempted regeneration in the 1970s to its current redevelopment it was known as the Cardroom Estate. It was one of several millennium village projects around seeking to regenerate inner-city areas. The name New Islington was also the local residents' choice of name for the area when the prospect of regeneration was raised. New Islington is one of the seven Millennium Communities Programme areas. Funding for the area was secured in 2002 and property developers Urban Splash have been at the forefront of developments including the Chips building. In 2007, coinciding with the regeneration of the area, the Ancoats Primary Care Centre was opened on Old Mill Street. The New Islington Medical Practice operates in the centre. The Grade II listed Ancoats Dispensary is also situated on Old Mill Street. The building became the centre of a dispute between re-developers Urban Splash, who wanted to demolish it, and campaigners fighting to save it. The Dispensary was spared demolition in 2013. In July 2014, the Ancoats Dispensary Trust, which intend to redevelop the building, received a ¬£770,000 grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund to help stabilise and repair the building. However, as of October 2018 works on the site have stalled and the future of the building's regeneration is now uncertain. Governance New Islington falls within the city and borough of Manchester, itself in the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester. Most of New Islington falls within the Ancoats and Clayton electoral ward. However, the area from Old Mill Street to Pollard Street does not fall within the ward boundary, instead falling in the Bradford electoral ward. Each ward has three councillors which represent their area on Manchester City Council. The New Islington area is represented by the Manchester Central parliamentary constituency. The current MP is Lucy Powell (Labour Co-operative) who represents the constituency within the House of Commons. Powell was elected following a by-election in 2012. Transport New Islington is bounded by Great Ancoats Street to the west, the Rochdale Canal to the north-west, New Union Street and New Islington to the north-east, Weybridge Road on the east and Pollard Street to the south. The area is served by New Islington tram stop on the Metrolink's East Manchester Line. The stop, adjacent to Pollard Street, opened in February 2013. In December 2013 the Transport for Greater Manchester Committee announced after their annual fares review that the station would now fall in the City Zone category. Education The New Islington Free School primary school is located on Hugh Oldham Way, New Islington Marina and is bordered by the Rochdale Canal. The school is operated by Manchester Grammar School and supported by Manchester City Council.

Plot Samir (Aasif Mandvi), a sous chef at an upscale New York restaurant, gets frustrated with his boss (Dean Winters) and quits after being passed over for a head chef position. His dreams of studying French cuisine in France are shattered after his father becomes ill and he must take over his family's Indian restaurant, Tandoori Palace in Queens. The restaurant has two chefs who don't know what they're doing, an old fashioned wall and faltering income since the only customers are Samir's uncles sitting at a table playing cards. Samir doesn't know what to do because his knowledge of Indian cooking is limited until he meets the larger-than-life gourmet chef and taxi driver Akbar (Naseeruddin Shah). Samir's world is transformed via Akbar's cooking lessons, the magic of the masala and a beautiful co-worker, Carrie (Jess Weixler). Meanwhile, his mother (Madhur Jaffrey) tries to get him to settle down with a nice Indian girl and his father, Hakkim (Harish Patel) is convinced he will amount to nothing. Samir, Akbar and the kitchen staff first update the restaurant's look. Then with Akbar's eccentric help, they concoct the most magical and mouth watering dishes in what soon becomes the best little Indian restaurant in New York with booming business. However, Akbar moves to Akron, Ohio and it is up to Samir to run the restaurant. Meanwhile, Hakkim plans to sell the restaurant. Samir, along with help from his uncles and Carrie, improves business at the restaurant. Eventually, Hakkim calls off the deal and the movie ends with Hakkim hugging Samir.

It is bounded to the west by the Mid-Cayman Rise spreading center, to the north by the Septentrional-Oriente fault zone and to the south by the Walton fault zone and the Enriquillo‚ÄìPlantain Garden fault zone. The existence of this microplate was first proposed in 1991. This has been confirmed by GPS measurements, which show that the overall displacement between the two main plates is split almost equally between the transform fault zones that bound the Gon√¢ve microplate. The microplate is expected to eventually become accreted to the North American Plate. Geographic extent The Gon√¢ve Microplate is an approximately 1,100 km long strip, consisting mainly of oceanic crust of the Cayman Trough but including island arc material at its eastern end on the western part of Hispaniola. Further east a separate Hispaniola microplate has been identified. At its western end, the Gon√¢ve Microplate is bounded by the mid-Cayman spreading centre. To the north it is bounded by the Septentrional-Oriente fault zone and to the south by a more complex strike-slip fault system that includes the Walton fault and the Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault zone. As the northern and southern boundaries approach the eastern edge of the Caribbean Plate they become less distinct and the eastern boundary is not as well defined. Evidence for existence The presence of a separate Gon√¢ve Microplate was first suggested by the analysis of sidescan sonar results from the Cayman Trough. This study found evidence for continuous transform type faults along the southern flank of the trough, to both sides of the spreading centre. GPS data supports the existence of the microplate by showing that the relative motion between the North American and Caribbean plates is split almost equally between the two bounding transform fault systems. Comparison of these rates with observations of magnetic stripes within the Cayman Trough suggests that displacement is increasingly being transferred from the northern fault system to the southern one. This observation is consistent with the eventual accretion of the Gon√¢ve Microplate to the North American Plate. History The Gon√¢ve Microplate began to form in the Early Eocene after the northern part of the leading edge of the Caribbean Plate (present day Cuba) collided with the Bahamas platform. This part of the plate was unable to move further to the east and a transform fault system developed to the south, effectively cutting off this northern area and accreting it to the North American Plate. A large left-stepping offset formed along this zone just east of the Yucat√°n peninsula creating a pull-apart basin, which continued to extend until the onset of seafloor spreading, creating the Cayman spreading centre. Further movement on this fault system created the Cayman Trough, although at that time the future microplate was still firmly attached to the Caribbean Plate. During the Late Miocene, the part of the Caribbean Plate formed by Hispaniola began to collide with the Bahamas platform and a new strike-slip fault system developed through Jamaica and southern Hispaniola, the Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault zone, isolating part of the Cayman Trough and the central part of Hispaniola to form the Gon√¢ve microplate. It has been suggested that the Gonave microplate will also become accreted to the North American Plate, as all the plate boundary displacement transfers onto the southern fault system.

Before the Frost and Mastermind were shown in November 2008; broadcast of the others began weekly in July 2009. Reviewing The Village Idiot and The Brothers in the Financial Times, John Lloyd wrote: > More evident is the philosophical underpinning that the books' author, > Henning Mankell, brings, focusing down on the forensic work of a provincial > detective the global sins of the western world. This coming week‚Äôs episode, > The Brothers, is a murder mystery emerging from a terrible crime perpetrated > by a group of drunken men on colonised people; last week's, The Village > Idiot, had at its core the moral obloquy of a private surgeon greedy for > profit. > Wallander and his comrades seek what remedies they can to the consequences > of the sins of oppression and greed.

What had happened for Wallander is a > melancholy immersion in human degradation, a provincial Inferno without a > Virgil to guide him.Lloyd, John (18 July 2009). \\"Virtue provides its own > rewards \\". Financial Times. Writing in √ñrnsk√∂ldsviks Allehanda after the release of The Thief (2009), Peter Carlsson complained that only the first and last films of the successive series were any good, pointing out that these are the ones released to cinemas. Carlsson further criticised that the middle films \\"are often predictable, tentative and carelessly made\\", and that the arrest of the criminal is anticlimactic.Carlsson, Peter (21 August 2009). \\"Det t√∂rstande deckarsamh√§llet\\". √ñrnsk√∂ldsviks Allehanda. As a series, Wallander has been nominated for The International TV Dagger at the 2009 Crime Thriller Awards, an awards ceremony presented by British television channel ITV3 and the Crime Writers' Association.

He also had his critics, however. For instance, in 1879 \\"the life-size picture of 'Eve at the Fountain,' painted by Mr. Wight, now on exhibition at Childs & Co.'s gallery, is an attempt at a great work in art, but we can hardly regard it as a successful one. With all the adventitious aids given to it in the drapery about it, and the arrangement of the light, which must greatly heighten its effect, the picture seems to us to come far short of what it ought to be. We doubt whether Eve could be represented except in marble to satisfy our ideal of the innocence, purity and dignity that ought to belong to the fair mother of the race.\\"Ladies' repository: religious and literary magazine for the home circle, v.43, no.1, Jan. 1870; p.79.

They have also been set up as a money making scam, selling fake qualifications which have no official accreditation, often at the taxpayer's expense. To tackle the problem of bogus colleges the British Government established a register of approved education providers in 2005. The register requires potential applicants for student visas to prove that they would be attending a legitimate college or university during their stay in the United Kingdom. The Home Office appoints accreditation bodies to inspect any colleges which wish to take international students. However, the register came in for criticism in 2008 after the government admitted that since the register's establishment almost half of the institutions on the list had been struck off following inspections. The system has been revised a number of times since its establishment. In April 2009 the UK Border Agency introduced tougher rules for international students coming to the United Kingdom. These included fingerprinting and checking potential applicants against security and immigration watchlists. Notable examples One of the most high-profile cases of a bogus college is the East London‚Äìbased Cambridge College of Learning, which sold several thousand fake postgraduate diplomas in business management and IT, charging between ¬£2,500 and ¬£4,000 for each qualification. Immigration officials became suspicious about the college ‚Äì which is unconnected to Cambridge University ‚Äì after the Home Office received 2,542 applications for post-study visas in a period of two months. When the UK Border Agency subsequently raided the premises in December 2008 they discovered just three classrooms and eleven desks. Students registered with the college were told that their visas were invalid and that they must return home. In another instance of bogus college activity, a 2009 Home Office investigation was launched after the British newspaper The Times presented evidence that hundreds of men from Pakistan's North West Frontier had paid at least ¬£1,000 to a gang to be admitted into bogus colleges, while some paid ¬£2,500 for fake diplomas, attendance records and degrees. A total of eleven colleges were established in London, Bradford and Manchester, including one which had enrolled eight terrorism suspects arrested in Manchester and Liverpool in April 2009. The college had three small classrooms and three teachers for 1,797 students. The Home Office inquiry followed an investigation by The Times which compiled a dossier on bogus colleges that included details of another college which claimed to have 150 students, but secretly enrolled 1,178 and offered places to an extra 1,575. Two Liverpool universities admitted they had given places to four \\"graduates\\" from one of the bogus colleges, the Manchester College of Professional Studies. Other examples Higher Education Degree Datacheck, the UK's official service for candidate verification and university authentication, has named a number of 'bogus universities' on its blog, often with names similar to genuine UK universities.

It is a quarterly publication, printed in the UK, that covers contemporary culture, fashion, art, architecture, technology and politics. The magazine is considered one of the pioneering publications in boutique magazine publishing, balancing fewer advertisements with a high cover price. Since its launch, the Tank group has expanded to include Tank Form, tank.tv, TankBooks and Because magazine. History Tank was launched by editor-in-chief Masoud Golsorkhi and art director Andreas Laeufer in September 1998. The first issue was published in the form of a thick, square, miniature book. Its slogan ‚ÄúSmall tank, big fish‚Äù began a trend where thinkers, writers, artists and photographers could look beyond conventional areas of discussion. In 2002, upon Laeufer‚Äôs departure, Caroline Issa was appointed the magazine‚Äôs publisher and fashion director. Issa was quickly established as a ‚Äúperennial street style favourite‚Äù and ‚Äúfixture on the fashion week circuit‚Äù. Format and content The independent magazine has produced a number of different incarnations: bulk pocket book, large wire-bound magazine and finally a rectangular perfect-bound edition. Tank‚Äôs independent editorial platform takes its motto ‚ÄúElitism for All‚Äù from a maxim by Jean-Fran√ßois Lyotard. Each issue revolves around a speculative concept or theoretical framework. Past subjects have included: revolution, disorientation, reality, bubbles and the city. Ane Lynge-Jorl√©n described the magazine as one of the alternative fashion publications. Tank Form Launched in 2003, Tank Form is an independent, boutique creative agency that grew out of Tank magazine. Describing itself as \\"specialist, not generalist\\", the agency provides a creative consultancy. Tank Form is run by group creative director and editor-in-chief Masoud Golsorkhi, and CEO Caroline Issa. Special projects have included sponsored publications created for Prada and Levi's. ...And? was a pink broadsheet newspaper created for Prada. MINED, a palindrome of the word ‚Äòdenim‚Äô, was a thick magazine created for Levi‚Äôs, it won the D&AD; Yellow Pencil Editorial and Book Design Award in 2002.  TankBooks  TankBooks was launched in 2007 and features unabridged classics in the form of cigarette packs. Their release coincided with the ban on smoking in public places in the UK. Created for ‚Äúlovers of literature and connoisseurs of design‚Äù. TankBooks repackages the works of Joseph Conrad, Ernest Hemingway, Rudyard Kipling, Leo Tolstoy, Franz Kafka and Robert Louis Stevenson. The cigarette books received an iF product design award in 2008. O: Quarterly Fashion Supplement by Tank O: by Tank was a luxury fashion supplement created for The Observer. It ran from 2005 to 2013 and focused on the world of fashion and beauty. Published four times a year, O: functioned both as a shopping guide and a source of inspiration for upcoming seasons. From 2012, the supplement was accompanied with a free mobile application called Fashion Scan. The application uses image-recognition technology to link the pages of the supplement with online video content. tank.tv Tank.tv, an online platform established in 2003, profiles contemporary artists, both emerging and prominent, that work specifically in moving image, film and video formats. Tank.tv collaborated on a number of events with international art institutions, including: Tate Modern, Kulturhuset, Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe and the Institute of Contemporary Arts. Turner Prize winning artist Laure Provoust directed Tank.tv from 2004-2011, initiating discussion with and invitations to artists, writers and curators including Paul McCarthy, Pipilotti Rist, Jeremy Deller, John Latham, Hans-Ulrich Obrist, Stuart Comer, John Bock and Negar Azimi. All work commissioned by and invited onto tank.tv is archived and available to view on the website, In 2013, a decade after launching, tank.tv opened an exhibition space on Great Portland Street, London. The gallery, a not for profit Arts Council supported public space, dedicated its programme to new media experimentation through exhibitions, residencies, lecture-performances and audio-visual events. Two key online residencies were with London-based gallery and publisher Arcadia Missa and curatorial team Sanssouci Realty.

Bisque dolls are characterized by their realistic, skin-like matte finish. They had their peak of popularity between 1860 and 1900 with French and German dolls. Bisque dolls are collectible, and antique dolls can be worth thousands of dollars. Antique German and French bisque dolls from the 19th century were often made as children's playthings, but contemporary bisque dolls are predominantly made directly for the collectors market. Colloquially the terms porcelain doll, bisque doll and china doll are sometimes used interchangeably. But collectors, when referring to antique dolls, make a distinction between china dolls, made of glazed porcelain, and bisque dolls, made of unglazed porcelain. When referring to contemporary dolls the terms porcelain and bisque are sometimes used interchangeably. Bisque dolls composition body, c.1920 Most bisque dolls have a head made of bisque porcelain and a body made of another material. Bisque is unglazed porcelain with a matte finish, giving it a realistic skin-like texture. It is usually tinted or painted a realistic skin color. The bisque head is attached to a body made of cloth or leather, or a jointed body made of wood, papier-m√¢ch√© or composition, a mix of pulp, sawdust, glue and similar materials. Doll bodies are only rarely made entirely of bisque because of its fragility and weight. Dolls that are made entirely of bisque are called all-bisque dolls. Bisque dolls usually have eyes made of glass. They vary widely in size, from lifesize down to half an inch. When producing a bisque doll, ceramic raw materials are shaped in a mold and fired at more than . The head is painted more than once to create skin tones and facial characteristics, and then fired again after each layer. Antique German and French bisque dolls from the 19th century were often made as children's playthings, but contemporary bisque dolls are predominantly made directly for the collectors market. History The earliest European porcelain dolls were china dolls, made predominantly in Germany between 1840 and 1880. China dolls were made of white glazed porcelain, giving them a characteristic glossy appearance, and their hair was painted on. Parian dolls were made in Germany of white unglazed porcelain from the 1850s onwards. Catalogue engraving of a bisque doll from the French company Jumeau, c. 1880 French and German bisque dolls began taking over the market after 1860, and their production continued after World War I. These dolls wore wigs, typically made from mohair or human hair.Antique Victorian Porcelain Doll Heads - LoveToKnow Antiques Between approximately 1860 and 1890 most bisque dolls were fashion dolls, made to represent grown up women. They were intended for children of affluent families to play with and dress in contemporary fashions. These dolls came from French companies like Jumeau, Bru, Gaultier, Rohmer, Simone and Huret, though their heads were often manufactured in Germany. In the Passage Choiseul area of Paris an industry grew around making clothing and accessories for the dolls. Up until the mid-19th century, most dolls were made to represent grown-ups, and when childlike dolls first appeared it was a big shift. By the late 19th century childlike dolls overtook the market. Foremost among these were the French B√©b√©s from doll makers like Jumeau, Bru, Steiner and Gaultier, which grew in popularity between the 1860s and 1880s. These were high quality dolls made with great skill. Like the earlier fashion dolls, they were made for children and dressed in contemporary children's clothing. In the 1890s German doll makers began taking over the market with less expensive dolls. In response, the French doll makers began making dolls as a consortium under the name Soci√©t√© Fran√ßaise de Fabrication de B√©b√©s et Jouets (S.F.B.J.) but these later French B√©b√©s were often of lesser quality. German childlike dolls were predominantly produced between 1890 and 1930. The earliest ones are often referred to as dolly-faced dolls and were made by companies like Armand Marseille, Simon & Halbig, , and Kestner. Many came from the Thuringen region, which has natural deposits of the clay used to make the dolls. In the early 20th century companies like K√§mmer & Reinhardt, Heubach and Kestner began making more realistic and expressive childlike dolls, often called character- faced dolls. Small lower-priced all-bisque dolls known as penny dolls were common from the late 19th century to the 1930s. They were unarticulated and made of a single piece of bisque. A few German manufacturers like Kestner also made more detailed dolls entirely of bisque with articulated necks, arms, or legs. Bisque was the most common material for European doll heads until after the turn of the 20th century, when composition (or composite) gained favor. Production of composition dolls was strong in the United States. Kewpie dolls from the early 20th century were still made of bisque, and celluloid was also a popular material, despite the fire danger. Bisque dolls were made as commercial products in Germany for the toy rather than collector market until the late 1930s and Japan also produced many small bisque dolls in the 1920s and 1930s, often cold painted with oil colours, which have subsequently washed off. At about the same time, just before the Second World War, hobbyist production of reproduction dolls, firstly elaborately moulded female doll heads from the 1860s and 1870s, began in the US with doll artists such as Emma Clear. Reproduction bisque doll making grew slowly as a hobby in the United States in the 1950s and 1960s, expanding greatly during the 1970s and by about c. 1980 spreading to Europe, Great Britain and Australia, via companies retailing moulds and supplies such as Seeley's and Wandke, which ran large scale networks of classes and seminars. Another branch of bisque doll making that also emerged during the 1940s in the USA was \\"artists dolls\\" which were original creatively designed and moulded dolls that were not copies of 19th century or early 20th century dolls, or cast from earlier dolls. These dolls were intended for the adult collector market. In the 1980s bisque dolls had a revival with the growth of the collectors market and towards the end of the 20th century production began to move to China. China produced many inexpensive porcelain dolls that were sold in discount department and chain stores often as decorator pieces. This production was at an industrial rather than hobby/studio scale. Mass-produced porcelain dolls can still be found around the world in bargain stores retailing goods from China. More expensive industrially produced bisque dolls may be found by mail order or in gift shops or even in exclusive, upmarket toy shops as decorations for girls' rooms. Reproduction and artist made bisque dolls still appear but the scale of the hobby is not as great as in the 1980s. Collecting Antique bisque dolls are collectible and can be quite valuable. The most expensive bisque doll ever sold went for GBP ¬£242,500September 2014, https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/22200/lot/19/ (an art character doll made by K√§mmer & Reinhardt). But prices vary widely depending on the quality and condition of the doll. Preferable qualities of the bisque include a slight translucency without spots or holes. Dolls that are painted with more skill and have detailed features are valued higher. Other qualities include closed mouths and expressions that are not \\"pretty\\" such as a character face that is crying. More articulated bodies that can be posed more freely, like jointed wood or composition bodies, are valued higher than stiffer papier-m√¢ch√© or leather bodies. French 1860-1890 fashion dolls are commonly worth over US$2000, and dolls from well-known doll makers like Jumeau, Bru and Huret can be worth over US$20,000.Henri Launay, French doctor to dolls - The New York Times Among the French B√©b√©s early dolls from Jumeau and Bru generally go for several thousand dollars, while later S.F.B.J dolls may be worth only a few hundred. Among German dolls, the character-faced dolls are the most collectible, with rarer dolls fetching several thousand dollars. At the lower end of the price range are dolls that can be found for a few hundred dollars, like dolls from Armand Marseille and common types of dolls from Kestner. Unmarked dolls that can't be identified as coming from a specific manufacturer also fetch lower prices, but there are many exceptions. Small all-bisque penny dolls can be found at low prices as well. Carl Horn all bisque dolls are an exception, fetching upwards of $150 a piece for a 1\\" tall all-bisque doll.

By 1970, ERG was the world's second largest Electronic Rental Company in the world with operations in 22 countries. From 1967 to 1973, ERG owned Gola and the Leisure Division was run by Alan Christopher Cowell MC along with companies like Camping Gaz Gola Sporting Goods. He is the nephew of Sir Adolph Weiner of Viners Cutlery, who headed a prominent silversmith family in Sheffield and was knighted by the British monarchy. His wife, Maureen Black (n√©e Peres) is the daughter of Harold Peres, legendary music producer and record distributor of Solomon and Peres, a UK and Northern Ireland based company which later was acquired by Decca Records. In 1986, The Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) invited private sector companies to apply for a new television franchise via satellite. In an attempt to win the bid and operate The Direct Broadcasting by Satellite System, Electronic Rentals Group was acquired by Granada Limited for an estimated ¬£450M. The acquisition helped Granada Television to be awarded the fifteen-year franchise.The Times, Friday, 5 March 1982; pg. 15; Joint UK satellite set up By Bill Johnstone Electronics Correspondent.Guardian, 12 December 1986 Page: 2 \\"pioneer Contract is awarded for satellite tv\\" In 1978, Black with his adult son Anthony Black and family moved to Johannesburg, South Africa to help establish broadcasting throughout Southern Africa. In 1978, Black's ERG subsidiary, Vision Hire, along with King Sobhuza II of Swaziland, founded the Swaziland Television Broadcasting Corporation (STBC). From 1978 to 1979, the Swaziland Government positioned television satellites toward South Africa to provide anti-Apartheid broadcasting to South Africa. Black was considered a silent player in the fight against Apartheid. In 1983, the government of the Kingdom of Swaziland nationalised Black's privately owned company. The company had a monopoly in all television gadgets or equipment, as a result, they government also acquired and operated Vision Hire. With the change of the television station from STBC to STVA, the name of Vision Hire was changed to the Swaziland Television Authority Rentals (STAR). Later years In 1982, Black moved to San Diego, California, US, where he owned and operated Video Library, which later became known as Blockbuster Inc. In retirement, he served as a member of the board of directors of the Mingei International Museum and was California Western School of Law's chairman of the board of Trustees from 1991 to 1994, and continued to serve as chairman Emeritus. In 1995, he was awarded an Honorary Juris Doctorate. Later that year, California Western School of Law opened the Black Family Law Library in his honour.

Algorithms relying on these operations are popular because they are relatively cheap in both hardware and software and run in constant time, making them safe from timing attacks in common implementations. The basic idea of rotational cryptanalysis is that both the bit rotation and XOR operations preserve correlations between bit-rotated pairs of inputs, and that addition of bit-rotated inputs also partially preserves bit rotation correlations. Rotational pairs of inputs can thus be used to \\"see through\\" the cipher's cascaded ARX operations to a greater degree than might be expected. This ability to \\"see\\" correlations through rounds of processing can then be exploited to break the cipher in a way that is similar to differential cryptanalysis. The term \\"rotational cryptanalysis\\" was coined by Dmitry Khovratovich and Ivica Nikoliƒá in 2010 paper \\"Rotational Cryptanalysis of ARX\\", which presented the best cryptanalytic attacks at that time against a reduced-round Threefish cipher -- part of Skein (hash function), a SHA-3 competition candidate.

It is a 75-year longitudinal that has run in tandem with a study called \\"The Glueck Study,\\" which included a second cohort of 456 disadvantaged nondelinquent inner-city youths who grew up in Boston neighborhoods between 1940 and 1945.Vaillant, G., Mukamal K. Successful Aging. American Journal of Psychiatry, 2001: 158:839‚Äì847 The subjects were all male and of American nationality. The men continue to be studied to this day. The men were evaluated at least every two years by questionnaires, information from their physicians, and in many cases by personal interviews. Information was gathered about their mental and physical health, career enjoyment, retirement experience and marital quality. The goal of the study was to identify predictors of healthy aging. The study, its methodology and results are described in three books by a principal investigator in the study, George Vaillant. The first bookVaillant, George E. Adaptation to Life, 1977 describes the study up to a time when the men were 47 years of age, and the second bookVaillant, George E. Aging Well, 2002 to when the inner-city men were 70 years old and the Harvard group were eighty. In 2012, Vaillant and Harvard University Press published Triumphs of Experience, sharing more findings from the Grant Study. The study is part of The Study of Adult Development, which is now under the direction of Dr. Robert J. Waldinger at Massachusetts General Hospital. The study included four members who ran for the U.S. Senate. One served in a presidential Cabinet, and one was President John F. Kennedy. The study is unique partly because of the long time span of the cohort, and also partly because of the high social status of some of the study participants.  Main results George Vaillant, who directed the study for more than three decades, has publishedhttps://www.amazon.com/Triumphs-Experience-Harvard- Grant-Study/dp/0674059824 a summation of the key insights the study has yielded: * Alcoholism is a disorder of great destructive power. ** Alcoholism was the main cause of divorce between the Grant Study men and their wives. ** Strongly correlates with neurosis and depression, which tended to follow alcohol abuse, rather than precede it. ** Together with associated cigarette smoking, was the single greatest contributor to their early morbidity and death. * Financial success depends on warmth of relationships and, above a certain level, not on intelligence. ** Those who scored highest on measurements of \\"warm relationships\\" earned an average of $141,000 a year more at their peak salaries (usually between ages 55 and 60). ** No significant difference in maximum income earned by men with IQs in the 110‚Äì115 range and men with IQs higher than 150. * Political mindedness correlates with intimacy: Aging liberals have more sex. ** The most-conservative men ceased sexual relations at an average age of 68. ** The most-liberal men had active sex lives into their 80s. * The warmth of childhood relationship with mothers matters long into adulthood: ** Men who had \\"warm\\" childhood relationships with their mothers earned an average of $87,000 more a year than men whose mothers were uncaring. ** Men who had poor childhood relationships with their mothers were much more likely to develop dementia when old. ** Late in their professional lives, the men's boyhood relationships with their mothers‚Äîbut not with their fathers‚Äîwere associated with effectiveness at work. ** The warmth of childhood relationships with mothers had no significant bearing on \\"life satisfaction\\" at 75. * The warmth of childhood relationship with fathers correlated with: ** Lower rates of adult anxiety. ** Greater enjoyment of vacations. ** Increased \\"life satisfaction\\" at age 75. Vaillant's main conclusion is that \\"warmth of relationships throughout life has the greatest positive impact on 'life satisfaction'\\". Put differently, Vaillant says the study shows: \\"Happiness is love.

The Amfibus had previously been trialled by Splashtours in Rotterdam Harbour, where it successfully coped with the wash from tugs and cargo ships. Trials on the Clyde took place on 8 and 9 February 2010. It was not without problems as one of the bus' airbags worked loose. The Amfibus was not selected to continue the service. However, in July 2011 a similar vehicle started a tourist cruise service running direct from Schiphol airport to the Amsterdam canals.

Estudio Destra, faux door, tiles by Kate Swift, 1994 Acrobat, acrylic on canvas, inspired by Celtic and Iberian imagery, Kate Swift, 1999  Biography  Born in Dublin in 1956, Swift was the first child of Patrick Swift (painter) and Oonagh Ryan (formerly married to Alexis Guedroitz with whom she had a daughter, Ania Gu√©dro√Øtz). Her uncle was the artist and man of letters, John Ryan; her aunt the film actress Kathleen Ryan. Her father gave a portrait of the poet Patrick Kavanagh to the doctor, Michael Solomons, as a gift for delivering Katherine and the doctor subsequently bequeathed the portrait to the Dublin Writers Museum, where it can be seen today. Katherine had a bohemian upbringing moving between Dublin, London and the Algarve in southern Portugal. Katherine had shown a gift for drawing and painting from an early age. Her father taught and encouraged her. As a teenager she attended boarding school in England and later studied at Art College in Lisbon and London before moving back to the Algarve permanently in 1982, when her father was diagnosed with a brain tumour. Her portraits include David Wright and her father. She illustrated several books including a guide to Portuguese restaurants. Throughout her life she continuously painted the Algarve landscape. For some years her work was inspired by ancient Celtic and Iberian imagery, as can be seen in the Acrobat displayed here. Swift had exhibitions in Dublin, London, and Algarve. She worked in a variety of media including oils, acrylics, ink, watercolour and ceramics.  Ceramics  Doves, tiles by Katherine Swift Estudio Destra entrance Estudio Destra pot signed by Kate Swift Porches Pottery (Olaria Algarve) Swift was involved with the pottery her father founded, Porches Pottery, from its inception. She showed an artistic flair from a young age and, as a child, would decorate ceramics. Swift, like her father, decorated free-hand. Following her father's death in 1983 she took over the management of Porches Pottery. At Porches she concentrated primarily on painting tile panels while also training Porches Pottery decorators in the free flowing style that is associated with Porches Pottery. Estudio Cynette Estudio Destra In the late 1980s Swift founded, with the ceramicist Roger Metcalfe, a ceramics workshop and studio, Estudio Destra. Estudio Destra, which continues to be a working studio and workshop ArtGallery.co.uk on Estudio Destra, Kate Swift & Roger Metcalfe) is located in a 16th-century Jewish townhouse in Silves, Algarve. Silves was once the capital of the Algarve and an important Moorish city that rivalled Lisbon. Among the very few buildings to have survived the earthquake of 1775 in Silves were the Cathedral, begun in the 13th and completed in the 15th century, and the building that today houses Estudio Destra. At Estudio Destra, Swift specialised in painting tile panels. Here she was to \\"gain international repute as a ceramics painter. Kate‚Äôs splendid works are free interpretations of ancient Iberian, Islamic and pre-Islamic designs. Every piece is unique and no stencils or any kind or reproductive technique is used\\".AA Algarve Guide (AA Spiral Guides), p.30 (p.26 earlier issues), Katherine Swift and her Silves Studio, 2005, 07,09, Swift and her studio were the subject of a documentary on Portuguese national TV.

Legacy machines Original Cricut The original Cricut comes with a 6\\" x 12\\" cutting mat and images can be cut in a range from 1\\" to 5 1/2\\" tall.http://beta.cricut.com/home/using-your-cricut/original- cricut#FromTheCommunity The original Cricut is compatible with all original Cricut cartridges. The original Cricut does not have the ability to cut as many different types of materials that the newer Cricut machines can. However, Cricut does make a Deep Cut Blade & Housing that can allow original Cricut owners to cut material up to 1.55mm thick, such as magnet, chipboard, and stamp materials. The original Cricut is also compatible with the Cricut Design Craft Room. Cricut Expression The Cricut Expression offers several advantages over the previous model. First, it allows users to cut shapes and fonts in a range from \\" to 23\\", and comes with a 12\\" x 12\\" cutting matting with adjustable slides so that users no longer need to trim their media down to 6\\" x 12\\". It cuts a wider range of materials, including vellum, fabric, chipboard, vinyl, and thin foils. It also features an LCD Screen to preview the work, and has features such Quantity and Auto-Fill. A \\"Paper Saver\\" mode and choice of Portrait or Landscape Orientation have also been added. The basic model has two cartridges included in the purchase, Plantin SchoolBook and Accent Essentials. Cricut Imagine This machine was entirely unique in that it had an HP 97 ink jet printer built into it so that it could both cut and print images. This machine also had a revamped touch screen interface, and was extremely large and heavy. The machine had an extremely short life span of almost one year. Cricut Expression 2 The Cricut Expression 2 has an updated exterior from the Cricut Expression. It comes with a 12\\" x 12\\" cutting mat. This machine does not have the keyboard that the original cricut and the cricut expression have. Instead it features a new full-color LCD touch screen. The LCD touch screen displays the keyboard on the screen and allows you to see where your images will be on the mat prior to cutting. It also has the new feature of independent image sizing and image rotation directly on the LCD screen. Cricut Mini The Cricut Mini is a small personal electronic cutting machine. Unlike the other Cricut machines it only works with a computer, it can not cut images standing alone. You have to use Cricut Craft Room design software. The Cricut Mini comes with over 500 images that are automatically unlocked when you connect your Cricut with the Cricut Craft Room design software or the Cricut Gypsy device. The machine does have a cartridge port that is compatible with all Cricut cartridges except the Cricut imagine cartridges. The Cricut Mini also features a unique mat size of 8.5\\" x 12\\". The Cricut Mini can cut images in a range of 1/4\\" to 11 1/2\\". The Cricut Mini relied exclusively on using Cricut Craft Room, a computer program which no longer functions. Of all the Legacy Cricut machines, the Mini is the only one that is now obsolete and not usable in any way. Cricut Cake The Cricut Cake was one of the first vinyl cutters that you could cut edible vinyl. This was only for cakes. You can still cut your normal Vinyl, Iron-on and other materials. Cartridges Designs are made from components stored on cartridges. Each cartridge comes with a keyboard overlay and instruction booklet. The plastic keyboard overlay indicates key selections for that cartridge only. However recently Provo Craft has released a \\"Universal Overlay\\" that is compatible with all cartridges released after August 1, 2013. The purpose of the universal overlay is to simplify the process of cutting by only having to learn one keyboard overlay instead of having to learn the overlay for each individual cartridge. Designs can be cut out on a PC with the Cricut Design Studio software, on a USB connected Gypsy machine, or can be directly inputted on the Cricut machine using the keyboard overlay. There are two types of cartridges, shape and font. Each cartridge provides for hundreds of different cuts. Currently over 275 cartridges are available, with new ones regularly released. While some cartridges are generic in content, Cricut has licensing agreements with Disney, Pixar, Nickelodeon, Sesame Street, DC Comics and Hello Kitty. The cartridges are interchangeable, although not all options on a cartridge may be available with the smaller machines. All cartridges work only with Cricut software, must be registered to a single user for use and cannot be sold or given away. A cartridge purchased for a discontinued machine is likely to become useless at the point the machine is discontinued. Cricut reserves the right to discontinue support for some versions of their software at any time, which can make some cartridges immediately obsolete. Software Proprietary The Cricut Craft Room software enables users to combine images from different cartridges, merge images, and stretch/rotate images; it does not allow for the creation of arbitrary designs. It also enables the user to view the images displayed on-screen before beginning the cutting process, so the end result can be seen in advance. Citing Adobe's abandonment of Flash, Cricut announced it would be closing Cricut Craft Room on 15 July 2018. Users of \\"legacy\\" machines were offered a discount to update to models compatible with Cricut Design Space. As of 16 July 2018, Design Space is the only official software available to compose projects. Some third party programs are available and can be used to input the files into Design Space.Important News for Cricut Craft Room Users. Accessed 10 August 2018. Design Space is not compatible with cartridges formerly purchased for the Cricut Mini, which was force-sunset in October 2018. Third-party Provo Craft has been actively hostile to the use of third-party software programs that could enable Cricut owners to cut out designs and to use the machine without depending on its proprietary cartridges. In a comparative review of die-cutting machines, review site TopTenReviews identified being \\"limited to cutting designs from a collection of cartridges\\" as a major drawback of the Cricut range, though the review noted that it could be a preference for some.Cricut Expression review, Top Ten Reviews. Accessed 26 January 2012. Two programs which could formerly be used to make and then get Cricut machines to cut out arbitrary designs (using, for example, arbitrary TrueType fonts or SVG format graphics) were Make-the-Cut (MTC) and Craft Edge's Sure Cuts A Lot (SCAL). In April 2010 Provo Craft opened legal action against the publishers of Make-the-Cut,Nancy Nally, Provo Craft Sues Make The Cut, Scrapbook Update, 7 April 2010 and in January 2011 it sued Craft Edge to stop the distribution of the SCAL program. In both cases the publishers settled with Provo Craft, and removed support for Cricut from their products. The programs continue to be usable with other home cutters.Nancy Nally, Make The Cut Settles Cricut Software Lawsuit With Provo Craft, Scrapbook Update, 11 March 2011 Nancy Nally, Provo Craft Issues Statement on MTC, SCAL Lawsuits, Scrapbook Update, 5 April 2011 Communication from Craft Edge, Notes from the Scrapbooklady (blog), 17 May 2011 Update on SCAL and Provocraft, UK Scrappers, 16 May 2011 According to the text of its legal complaint against Craft Edge, \\"Provo Craft uses various techniques to encrypt and obscure the USB communications between Cricut DesignStudio [a design program supplied with the hardware] and the Cricut e-cutter, in order to protect Provo Craft's proprietary software and firmware, and to prevent attempts to intercept the cutting commands\\".Complaint: Provo Craft and Novelty Inc. v. Craft Edge Inc., at 28 (page 6) Provo Craft contended that in order to understand and replicate this obscured protocol, Craft Edge had disassembled the DesignStudio program, contrary to the terms of its End User License Agreement, thereby (the company asserted) breaching copyright law. Provo Craft also asserted that Craft Edge were violating its trademark in the word \\"Cricut\\" by saying that its software could work with Cricut machines. Provo Craft asserted that this was likely \\"to cause confusion, mistake or deception as to the source or origin of Defendant's goods or services, and [was] likely to falsely suggest a sponsorship, connection, license, or association of Defendant's goods and services with Provo Craft\\".Complaint: Provo Craft and Novelty Inc. v. Craft Edge Inc., at 57 (page 13) The result of this is that customers with older versions of Cricut machines that were 'force sunset' by discontinuation of software support have no alternative software to use with their now obsolete machines.

Olsen was also recognized as an historical archaeologist and scholar of United States military insignia, especially buttons of the American Colonial through Civil War periods. He was the father of John W. Olsen. Early life and military service Stanley Olsen was born in Akron, Ohio to John Mons Olsen (of Bergen, Norway) and Louise Marquardt (of Akron), the second of two sons. After his graduation from high school in 1938, Olsen worked as a tool and die maker at the National Rubber Machinery Company in Akron until his marriage to Eleanor Louise Vinez (1917-2016) in 1942. He subsequently enlisted in the United States Navy, achieving the rank of Machinist Mate First Class while serving aboard the USS Mertz, Bunker Hill and Wyoming, and at naval bases on the U.S. East Coast and at Mare Island Navy Yard, California during the Second World War. Career and scholarly contributions Olsen with crates of \\"mastodon mount\\" at FSU's Geology Center in Tallahassee. Olsen with skulls in Tallahassee. Following his Honorable Discharge from the U.S. Navy in November 1945, Olsen found employment as a fossil preparator in the vertebrate paleontological laboratory of Alfred Sherwood Romer in the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University. Olsen's technical work as a preparator quickly evolved into his assignment as one of Professor Romer's two principal field supervisors. This opportunity led Olsen to the eastern coast of Canada where he prospected for Devonian fish fossils in Newfoundland and to the southeastern and western U.S. where he collected Tertiary fossils in Florida, Wyoming, and Montana and Permian and Triassic vertebrates in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, and Utah. Herman Gunter's 1956 invitation to join the staff of the Florida Geological Survey in Tallahassee as State Vertebrate Paleontologist signaled the beginning of Olsen's scholarly career. One of Olsen's first tasks was reopening excavations at the Thomas Farm site in Gilchrist County, Florida. The Thomas Farm locality, discovered in 1931, has produced the best known early Miocene terrestrial vertebrate fauna east of the U.S. Rocky Mountains. This unique site records predator-prey interactions of the coyote-like Metatomarctus and the ancestral horse, Parahippus, as well as a host of other species, on the margins of an 18-million-year-old wooded sinkhole and cave complex. Tens of thousands of fossils have been uncovered during more than 70 years of research at the site, ranging from frogs and bats to rhinoceroses and bears. Olsen's work on the Thomas Farm Caninae (dog-like carnivores, including Metatomarctus and the bear-dog, Amphicyon, and their kin) in the late 1950s and early 1960s is regarded as foundational for subsequent studies of those and related species. Olsen's analysis of the Thomas Farm carnivores not only established him as a vertebrate paleontologist, but also put him in contact with like-minded scholars the world over, including China, where he nurtured contacts that ultimately came to fruition during his many research trips there beginning in 1976. In 1963, the renowned ornithologist Pierce Brodkorb honored Olsen's work by naming the first fossil stork described from the Tertiary of North America after him. The holotype of the ciconiid, Propelargus olseni, is a partial left tarsometatarsus discovered by Olsen in August 1961 in Middle Hemingfordian Torreya Formation deposits near Tallahassee and is now in the Florida Museum of Natural History's Pierce Brodkorb Ornithology Collection (catalog number 8504). During his tenure at the Florida Geological Survey, Olsen helped pioneer the use of both SCUBA and helmeted diving equipment to explore the rich underwater fossil deposits of central and north Florida's rivers and springs. His work with colleagues in the Ichetucknee, Aucilla, and Wacissa rivers and in Wakulla Springs is especially well known because remains of mammoths and mastodons were found in association with bone and stone artifacts of human manufacture. His familiarity with SCUBA and a developing interest in the archaeology of the Colonial period United States led to Olsen's appointment by Governor Ferris Bryant as Director of Florida's Marine Salvage Committee in 1964. The natural conflicts between scientific inquiry and economic gain were poised to play out in 1960s Florida on a massive scale. The Gulf and Atlantic coasts‚Äô abundant shipwrecks were only beginning to be recognized as a resource for both scientific study and financial exploitation and the Salvage Committee's challenge was to initiate accommodation between these two potentially antithetical goals. Olsen's work on the Salvage Committee was tangentially responsible for kindling his interest in Colonial European exploitation of domestic animals, a research focus that proved lifelong and best exemplified by his innovative analysis of faunal remains recovered from the Spanish ship Nuestra Se√±ora de Atocha. While on the staff of the F.G.S., Olsen also began to publish his widely distributed and highly respected comparative osteological manuals for archaeologists. These monographs of the Peabody Museum at Harvard signaled his conscious movement away from a focus on Tertiary paleontological assemblages toward Quaternary and Holocene bone accumulations associated with archaeological sites. Under Barbara Lawrence's influence during his frequent research trips to Harvard in the late 1950s and early 1960s, Olsen began to work more and more closely with archaeologists in their then fledgling attempts to incorporate the analysis and interpretation of animal remains from anthropogenic deposits into the body of traditional archaeological literature. In 1968, Olsen accepted Hale G. Smith's invitation to join the faculty of the Department of Anthropology at Florida State University where he established one of the first zooarchaeology teaching laboratories in the country (along with those at Harvard University, the University of Tennessee, the Field Museum in Chicago, and the University of Florida). Olsen's transition from the mainly research-oriented environments of museums and the Florida Geological Survey to a broader spectrum academic career is especially noteworthy because he accomplished that feat holding only a high school diploma. Olsen joined the Florida State faculty as a tenured associate professor and was promoted to Full Professor in 1972. In 1973, Olsen accepted the concurrent positions of Professor of Anthropology at the University of Arizona and Curator of Zooarchaeology in the Arizona State Museum in Tucson, which he held until his retirement in 1997. While in Arizona, Olsen focused his work on elucidating evidence for the domestication of a number of vertebrate species, especially the dog, camel, and yak. During his half-century professional career, Olsen conducted paleontological and zooarchaeological fieldwork in the U.S., Canada, Colombia, Belize, China, Tibet, India, Italy, Cyprus, and Nepal and worked extensively with museum collections in Great Britain, Russia, Egypt, and Sweden as well as the United States. The Arizona State Museum's comparative vertebrate skeletal collections are housed in the Stanley J. Olsen Laboratory of Zooarchaeology, and the Stanley J. Olsen Zooarchaeology Endowment Fund was created at the University of Arizona in 2004 to recognize his contributions to the field. Memberships and scholarly service Stanley Olsen was a member of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology, the Society for American Archaeology, the Society of the Sigma Xi, the Society of Mammalogists, and the American Society of Systematic Zoologists. He was a Fellow of both the Explorers Club and the Company of Military Historians. He served as the 26th President of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology in 1965-1966 and was elected an Honorary Member in 1996 (the 50th anniversary of his joining the Society) in recognition of Olsen's distinguished contributions to the discipline of vertebrate paleontology.

Plot Luna and Amar are a young Bosnian couple living in Sarajevo. Both have traumatic memories from the Bosnian War of the 1990s. Luna had seen her parents killed by an anti-Muslim militia in Bijeljina, and had come to Sarajevo with her grandparents as a child refugee. Amar had served as a soldier in the war and lost his brother. At present, however, they have apparently built up a successful life - she as an air hostess with B&H; Airlines, he as an air traffic controller at the Sarajevo International Airport. When she comes back from a flight they make love passionately and go to have a good time at a local nightclub. Though identifying as \\"Muslims\\" in the context of Bosnia's ethnic set-up, religion plays no part in their life. In fact, Amar drinks alcohol a bit too much - which is forbidden by Islam - and it is this which begins to put their relationship under strain. First of all, Amar loses his job for being drunk at work. Luna is very worried and has little hope of realizing her fragile dream of having a child with Amar. But her fears for their future increase when Amar takes on a well-paid job in a Muslim community hours away from where they live. Only after quite some time has elapsed during which they have had no contact with each other, is Luna allowed to visit Amar in this community of conservative Wahhabis in its idyllic lakeside location. She notices that the men and veiled women live in strict segregation and are closely watched. Luna asks Amar to return home with her but Amar insists that life in this isolated community of faithful followers has brought him peace and also keeps him from drinking. When he returns home a few weeks later, Luna realizes that Amars attitude to religion has fundamentally changed. Amar claims that his only interest is to become a better person, but Luna finds it extremely difficult to follow his line of thinking. She begins to question everything that she has believed in, even her desire to have a child. As the wounds of a tragic war-filled past continue to haunt her, Luna tears herself apart searching if love is truly enough to keep her and Amar together on the path to a lifetime of happiness.

The plot follows a divorced gay man who begins to suspect that his son is being physically abused by his ex-wife's new boyfriend. The story takes place in Bath, Somerset. Plot Oliver Wyatt lives with his mother, Hannah Wyatt, and her live-in boyfriend, Frank Donally, and spends occasional afternoons with his father Martyn Wyatt. After Oliver suffers a series of mysterious physical injuries, which he vaguely blames on neighbourhood bullies, suspicions are raised by his father, a GP, against Hannah's boyfriend, Frank. While Martyn becomes firmly convinced Frank is abusing his son, Oliver keeps silent about the true source of his injuries, and Hannah refuses to believe Frank could be abusing her son. Martyn begins court proceedings to gain sole custody of Oliver, though his gay relationship with Tom Dixon is brought as evidence by Hannah's lawyer of the unsuitability of Martyn's home. Only after she catches Frank abusing Oliver does Hannah accept that her boyfriend is the source of Oliver's injuries, though she is swayed by Frank's pleas and agrees to remain quiet about the issue and promises Oliver that the abuse will end. In the climactic scene, Oliver attacks Frank and is saved from a terrible beating by his father, Martyn, who instead receives Frank's wrath. As Frank's savagery is witnessed not only by Hannah, Oliver, and Tom, but also by Hannah's neighbours, who in turn call the police, the film ends with Hannah visiting Oliver, who now resides with his father, and asking him if he'd like to return to her home on occasion, now that Frank no longer lives with her. It is implied that Frank is now serving a prison sentence for abusing Oliver. Her request is met with stony silence from Oliver.

Arian Baptistery, Ravenna, early 6th century. The Hetoimasia, Etimasia (Greek ·ºëœÑŒøŒπŒºŒ±œÉŒØŒ±, \\"preparation\\"), prepared throne, Preparation of the Throne, ready throne or Throne of the Second Coming is the Christian version of the symbolic subject of the empty throne found in the art of the ancient world, whose meaning has changed over the centuries. In Ancient Greece it represented Zeus, chief of the gods, and in early Buddhist art it represented the Buddha. In Early Christian art and Early Medieval art it is found in both the East and Western churches, and represents either Christ, or sometimes God the Father as part of the Trinity. In the Middle Byzantine period, from about 1000, it came to represent more specifically the throne prepared for the Second Coming of Christ, a meaning it has retained in Eastern Orthodox art to the present.Schiller, II, 186. The motif consists of an empty throne and various other symbolic objects, in later depictions surrounded when space allows by angels paying homage. It is usually placed centrally in schemes of composition, very often in a roundel, but typically is not the largest element in a scheme of decoration.Hall, 94 Mara.Krishan, pp. 1 and 5, fig 4a caption The empty throne in pre-Christian art Symbolic base showing an empty throne, with a cuneiform inscription and depiction of Tukulti-Ninurta I 13th century BCE Assur, Iraq. Pergamon Museum, Berlin. Roman Empire, . Silver Denarius. On the obverse : Effigy of Emperor Titus ; on the reverse : curule seat surmounted by a crown. On the reverse of a Russian icon, with instruments of the Passion. The \\"empty throne\\" had a long pre-Christian history. An Assyrian relief in Berlin of c. 1243 BCE shows King Tukulti-Ninurta I kneeling before the empty throne of the fire-god Nusku, occupied by what appears to be a flame.Berlin relief The Hittites put thrones in important shrines for the spirit of the dead person to occupy, and the Etruscans left an empty seat at the head of the table at religious feasts for the god to join the company.Hall, 95 A somewhat controversial theory, held by many specialists, sees the Israelite Ark of the Covenant, or the figures of the cherubim above it, as an empty throne.Haran, 247-249, and later in the chapter. See his notes for further literature A throne with a crown upon it had been a symbol for an absent monarch in Ancient Greek culture since at least the time of Alexander the Great,Syndicus, 151 whose deification allowed secular use for what had previously been a symbol for Zeus, where the attribute placed on the throne was a pair of zig-zag thunderbolts.Hall, 95, coin 1st century CE from Cilicia Early Buddhist art used an empty throne, often under a parasol or Bodhi Tree, from before the time of Christ. This was, in the traditional view, an aniconic symbol for the Buddha; they avoided depicting the Buddha in human form, like early Christians with God the Father. Alternatively, it has been argued that these images represent actual relic-thrones at the major pilgrimage sites which were objects of worship.Example from the V&A; museum. The alternative theory, first advanced by Huntington (see her final paragraph), sees these images as depictions of an actual relic-throne of the Buddha as an object of worship at major Buddhist sites, but this remains controversial. The throne often contains a symbol such as the dharma wheel or Buddha footprint, as well as a cushion. Like the Greeks and other ancient peoples, the Romans held ritual banquets for the gods (a ritualized \\"theoxenia\\"), including the annual Epulum Jovis, and the lectisternium, originally a rare event in times of crisis, first held in 399 BCE according to Livy, but later much more common.Ramsay, 344 A seat for these was called a pulvinar, from pulvinus (\\"cushion\\"), and many temples held these; at the banquets statues of the deity were placed on them. There was a pulvinar at the Circus Maximus, on which initially statues and attributes of the gods were placed after a procession during games, but Augustus also occupied it himself (possibly copying Julius Caesar), building a temple-like structure in the seating to house it.Humphrey, 78-80 Thrones with a jewelled wreath, portrait or sceptre and diadem sitting on them were among the symbols used in the Roman law courts and elsewhere to represent the authority of the absent emperor; this was one of the monarchical attributes awarded by the Roman Senate to Julius Caesar.Humphrey, 79; Hall, 95; Hellemo, 107; Fishwick. See Temple 10, note 12 for detailed studies A seat with jewelled wreath is seen on coins from the Emperor Titus onwards, and on those of Diocletian a seat with a helmet on it represents Mars.Hellemo, 107 Commodus chose to be represented by a seat with the club and lion skin of Hercules, with whom he identified himself. The empty throne continued to be used as a secular symbol of power by the first Christian Emperors, and appears on the Arch of Constantine. Later non-Christian uses of the empty throne motif include the \\"Bema Feast\\", the most important annual feast of Persian Manichaeism, when a \\"bema\\" or empty throne represented the prophet Mani at a meal for worshippers.The Cambridge history of Iran: The Seleucid, Parthian and Sasanian periods In the Balinese version of Hinduism, the most prominent element in most temples is the padmasana or \\"Lotus Throne\\", an empty throne for the supreme deity Acintya.Davison and Granquist, 8-9, Baliblog, with images Christian art Modern depiction in a Romanian Orthodox church, with crown of thorns around the cross. There are several elements found in the image which reflect its changing meaning. The throne itself is always present, and is often backless and armless. In Ancient Greek, a \\"thronos\\" was a specific but ordinary type of chair with a footstool, and there is very often a footstool in the image. There is often a prominent cushion, and a cloth variously interpreted as Christ's mantle (especially when of imperial purple) or a sudarium may cover or sit on the throne.Schiller, I, 132 There may be a crown on the throne. There is often a book, often on the cushion and sometimes open; this represents the gospels in some examples, and in others the Book of Life, always closed and distinguished by its seven seals, following the Book of Apocalypse. There is nearly always a cross (except in images of councils), often a crux gemmata, and in later examples a patriarchal cross with two crossbars. The cloth may be draped round the cross, as may the crown of thorns, which first appears as an isolated motif in this context.Schiller, II, 187, noting the exception of a single occurrence in the Utrecht Psalter. This seems to have originated as a victor's wreath around or over the cross, part of the early emphasis on \\"Christ as Victor\\" found in much cross imagery, but later to have been transmuted into the crown of thorns. It has also been suggested that the wreathed cross motif also was the origin of the Celtic cross. The dove of the Holy Spirit may be present. In later versions two of the instruments of the Passion, the Spear and sponge on a stick, stand behind or beside the throne, or are held by angels. The nails from the cross and crown of thorns may sit on the throne, as in the Russian icon illustrated. If angels or archangels are included they are symmetrically placed on either side, either facing the throne or facing out and gesturing towards it; if there is a roundel they may be outside it. In earlier depictions other figures may surround the throne, for example Saints Peter and Paul in Santa Prassede, Rome (9th century). An alternative to the angels is kneeling figures of Adam and Eve in old age paying homage on either side of the throne. These are found in several large wall-paintings and mosaics, from the 12th century mosaics in Torcello Cathedral,Hall, 94, where both are illustrated, and 141 the paintings in the Chora Church, and the painted church exterior at Vorone≈£ Monastery in Romania of 1547.Vorone≈£ Monastery, feature with good image (in Romanian) Meaning of the image Byzantine miniature of about 880 of the First Council of Constantinople in 381 The image was one of many aspects of imperial iconography taken up by Early Christians after the Edict of Milan in 313, when the depiction of Jesus as a human figure, especially as a large figure detached from narrative contexts, was still a matter of controversy within Christianity. At the First Council of Nicaea in 325 an empty throne had the imperial insignia on it, representing the emperor Constantine I when he was not present.Hall, 95 However within a few decades an empty throne with a book of the gospels on it was being placed in the chamber of church councils to represent Christ, as at the First Council of Ephesus in 431. It has been suggested that the ivory Throne of Maximian in Ravenna, probably a gift from the Eastern Emperor Justinian I, was not made as a throne for personal use by Maximian, who was both Archbishop of Ravenna and the viceroy of the Byzantine territories in North Italy, but as an empty throne to symbolize either the imperial or divine power; Byzantine imagery at this period was sometimes ready to conflate the two.Beckwith, 116-118 A comparable symbol is the bishop's throne from which the cathedral takes its name, which, unless the bishop happens to be present and sitting in it, functions as a permanent reminder of his authority in his diocese. In the earlier versions the throne is most often accompanied by a cross and a scroll or book, which at this stage represents the Gospels. In this form the whole image represents Christ, but when the dove of the Holy Spirit and the cross are seen, the throne appears to represent God the Father, and the whole image the Trinity, a subject that Christian art did not represent directly for several centuries, as showing the Father as a human figure was objectionable. An example of a Trinitarian hetoimasia is in the Church of the Dormition in Nicaea.Parani, 196 From about 1000 the image may bear the title hetoimasia,Parani, 196 literally \\"preparation\\", meaning \\"that which has been prepared\\" or \\"that which is made ready\\", and specifically refers to the \\"sign of the Son of Man\\" and the Last Judgement. By this time the image usually occurs in the West only under direct Byzantine influence, as in Venice and Torcello. Some Early Christians had believed that the True Cross had miraculously ascended to Heaven, where it remained in readiness to become the glorified \\"sign of the Son of man\\" (see below) at the Last Judgement. The Discovery by Helena had displaced this view as to the fate of the actual cross, but the idea of the return at the Last Judgement of the glorified cross remained, as in a homily by Pope Leo the Great (d. 461), which was incorporated in the Roman Breviary.Werner, 35 and note 42 Early examples Icon in ivory, with archangels, cross, spear and sponge, and \\"Hetoimasia\\" inscribed above the throne, Constantinople around 1000 Although it is assumed that other examples existed earlier, the earliest surviving Christian hetoimasia is in the earliest major scheme of church decoration to survive, the mosaics in Santa Maria Maggiore, Rome (432-40), where it occupies the narrow centre of the \\"triumphal arch\\" separating nave and apse, flanked by angels,Beckwith, 111, and 37 on date a typical placement. It is shown, with a procession of Apostles, on a panel of the Pola ivory casket from Istria.Soper, 154-157 Three now displaced stone reliefs of the subject with other symbols are among the earliest indications of Christian architectural sculpture at this period; they are in Berlin, San Marco, Venice and Nicosia, Cyprus.Margaret Mullett, et al. \\"Early Christian and Byzantine art.\\" In Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online, subscription or library access required (accessed November 8, 2010). Elsewhere it may occupy the centre of a frieze below a larger composition in the apse semi-dome, or a position on the main axis of a circular frieze round a central scene in the roof of a dome, as in the Arian Baptistry (start of 6th century) in Ravenna. At Castelseprio it occupies the centre of the apse-side (west-facing) of the triumphal arch. All are central positions, prominent but not dominant. The Baptistry of Neon (late 5th century) in Ravenna is exceptional in using repeated hetoimasia images in a circular dome frieze of eight images, four each of two types appearing alternately: a hetoimasia with cross in a garden and an altar containing an open book, flanked by two chairs.Morgan, 8. It is also known as the Orthodox Baptistry. See also Weinryb, 44, 48-51. The 6th-century \\"throne-reliquary\\" in rather crudely carved alabaster, the Sedia di San Marco, was moved from the high altar to the Treasury of San Marco, Venice in 1534. It would only fit a bishop with a slight figure, and has a large compartment for relics below the seat. It may have functioned as a \\"throne-lectern\\" or resting place for a gospel book, making actual the hetoimasia images with open books.Buckton, 98-105 Later use During the Middle Byzantine period the etimasia became a standard feature of the evolving subject of the Last Judgement, found from the 11th century onwards.V&A; Museum, notes on ivory Last Judgement As in the Western versions descended from the Byzantine images, this was on several tiers, with Christ in Judgement at the top, and in the East the etimasia almost always in the centre of the tier below, but occasionally above Christ. This basic layout has remained in use in Eastern Orthodoxy to the present day, and is found both on church walls and as a painted panel icon. The etimasia was normally omitted in Western versions, except in works under direct Byzantine influence, such as the early 12th century west wall of Torcello Cathedral. Russian 18th(?) century icon of the Last Judgement, following what had become a standard composition in its main elements, including the etimasia. Another context in which the etimasia sometimes appears from the Middle Byzantine period is Pentecost, in Orthodoxy also the Feast of the Trinity. Here a trinitarian etimasia with the dove representing the Holy Spirit may be found, as in the 12th century mosaics on the roof of the west dome of St Mark's, Venice, where the centre is an etimasia with book and dove, with the twelve apostles seated round the outer rims, with flames on their heads and rays connecting them to the central throne. Below the apostles pairs of figures representing the \\"nations\\", with tituli, stand between the windows. Similar images are found in the Chludov Psalter and elsewhere. However, in this case the etimasia did not become part of a conventional composition, and it is not found in modern icons of the Pentecost.Demus, 55-57, and plate 13; also Parani, 196. See here for further details] It has been suggested that the empty stool with a cushion in the foreground of Jan van Eyck's Annunciation in Washington may suggest the empty throne; van Eyck characteristically uses domestic fittings to represent doctrinal references.Hand, J.O., & Wolff, M., Early Netherlandish Painting (catalogue), National Gallery of Art, p. 81 and note 27, Washington/Cambridge UP, 1986, . Entry pp. 75-86, by Hand. Scriptural references The image has been regarded as illustrating a number of different passages from the Bible. For the later Byzantines the etimasia was the \\"sign of the Son of man\\" of Matthew 24:30: \\"And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory\\".See Hellemo, 102-104 for arguments that the earliest examples also carried this meaning (he disagrees) The understanding of the image as a symbol for the Second Coming also drew on Psalms 9:7: \\"But the Lord shall endure for ever: he hath prepared his throne for judgment\\".Schiller, II 98 & 187 where the Septuagint has \\"·º°œÑŒøŒØŒºŒ±œÉŒµŒΩ\\" (\\"hetoimasen\\") for \\"prepared\\".Psalms 9:7: Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ ·ΩÅ Œ∫œçœÅŒπŒøœÇ Œµ·º∞œÇ œÑ·Ω∏ŒΩ Œ±·º∞·ø∂ŒΩŒ± ŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒµŒπ ·º°œÑŒøŒØŒºŒ±œÉŒµŒΩ ·ºêŒΩ Œ∫œÅŒØœÉŒµŒπ œÑ·Ω∏ŒΩ Œ∏œÅœåŒΩŒøŒΩ Œ±·ΩêœÑŒø·ø¶ Biblos website Psalm 89:14:\\"Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne: mercy and truth shall go before thy face\\" is another relevant passage, using the word in the Septuagint (instead of the \\"habitation\\" of the King James Version), giving \\"·ºëœÑŒøŒπŒºŒ±œÉŒØŒ± œÑŒø·ø¶ Œ∏œÅœåŒΩŒøœÖ\\" or \\"preparation of your throne\\".Temple, 8-9, Biblos website Throne imagery is found above all in the Book of Revelation, especially chapter 4, although the throne therein is already occupied. Terminology The Greek verb ·ºëœÑŒøŒπŒºŒ±œÉŒµŒΩ (\\"hetoimasen\\") means \\"to prepare\\" or \\"to make ready\\". It will be seen that the name \\"hetoimasia\\", meaning \\"preparation\\" or \\"that which has been prepared\\", with \\"throne\\" (\\"thronos\\" in Greek) only implied,Contrary to many sources who should know better, and say hetoimasia \\"means\\" empty throne etc. is more appropriate to the Eastern images after about 1000 than to those before. The use of the name for both groups was established in the 19th century by the French art historian Paul Durand (from 1867), and despite protests has stuck.Hellemo, 104-105 In more modern Orthodox contexts \\"etimasia\\" and \\"prepared throne\\" are typically used, and in art history relating to the earlier group \\"hetoimasia\\" and \\"empty throne\\" - exclusively the latter in non- Christian contexts where a more specialized term is not used. There are various other transliterations and translations: \\"hetimasia\\", \\"throne made ready\\" etc. Notes References * Beckwith, John, Early Christian and Byzantine Art, Penguin History of Art (now Yale), 2nd edn. 1979, * Buckton, David, et al., The Treasury of San Marco Venice, 1984, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (fully available online or as PDF from the MMA) * Demus, Otto.

It primarily showcased hunting and fishing products, sporting equipment, and services, along with expert advice, seminars, and competition shooting. Often described as the largest show of its kind in North America, it included more than 1,000 hunting and fishing related vendors and over 500 outfitters from around the world. History The event was originally a six-day event called the \\"Pennsylvania Recreation and Sportsmen's Show\\" and was first held in March 1956. In 1962, the show was expanded to eight days and renamed the \\"Pennsylvania Sports and Outdoor Show\\". Cancellation On January 15, 2013 Reed Exhibitions, the promoter of the show, announced that modern sporting rifles (MSRs) and related products would not be permitted at the show. Following the announcement, hundreds of its exhibitors and most of its celebrity speakers cancelled. Following opposition by the National Rifle Association, and a statement by the National Shooting Sports Foundation that they would stop co-organizing with Reed for their annual SHOT Show, Reed announced the indefinite postponement of the ESOS. Tourism officials for the Hershey and Harrisburg Region of Pennsylvania said that the postponement and eventual cancellation of the ESOS in 2013 resulted in an estimated $80 million loss to the local economy. Officials with the Hershey Harrisburg Regional Visitors Bureau (HHRVB) reported $44 million of that loss was in direct spending from the 1,000 vendors and estimated 250,000 visitors attending the show each year. Regional hotels reported the event accounted for approximately 12,000 room-nights during what was typically a slow period for occupancy. The National Rifle Association (NRA) was chosen over 16 other applicants to replace the show starting in 2014 with a new event at the Farm Show Complex called the Great American Outdoor Show.

Education and early career Iver Rosenkrantz was born at Rosenholm Castle (Rosenholm Slot) in Hornslet, Denmark. He was the son of Erik Rosenkrantz til Rosenholm (1612‚Äì1681) and his third wife Margaret Krabbe til Vemmetofte (1640-1716). His father was a nobleman and statesman who died when Iver was aged 7. He seems to have had a very rigorous education. In 1691 he came to Copenhagen to attend the Knight Academy (Ridderakademi). Three years later he took a trip abroad returning in 1697. In January 1698, he was appointed chamberlain (Kammerjunker) to Princess Sophia Hedwig (1677-1735). Diplomat In 1700, King Frederick IV of Denmark sent Rosenkrantz on a diplomatic mission to meet with King Charles XII of Sweden, though he returned unsuccessfully. In 1702 he was appointed a Counsellor and then served as Danish ambassador to England 1702‚Äì1706 and 1710‚Äì1714. On his return he was appointed Secretary of the Board of Trade (Kommercekollegiet). With Frederick IV relying increasingly on his Queen Anne Sophie Reventlow, and with Rozenkrantz critical of the Danish aristocracy, he was stripped of his titles and appointed governor of Viborg, thereby removing him from central government, although he remained on good terms with the King's siblings. Minister of State When Frederick IV died in 1730, the new King Christian VI immediately called Rosenkrantz back to Copenhagen, where he was appointed a Knight of the Elephant and appointed Chief of the two Danish Chancellories. During the hostility between England and France, he backed England. He was also known for his patronage of Copenhagen University. He was dismissed in 1735 following disagreement with the king regarding foreign policy. Personal life He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in June 1713.

He enlists in the summer of 1917, but spends a year in France, where he serves military policeman, stevedore, and construction laborer, doesn't see frontline action and combat until the summer of 1918, when the novel begins. First, Hick's company is sent to the frontline trenches, where they spend more than a month without fighting, and only once does Hicks and a squad of men leave the trenches to go on a small raid. However, during the raid, a communication mix-up causes their own lines to open fire on them, killing one of the squad and ending the raid. A few weeks later, the battalion is relieved from frontline duty. Not long after, the Germans begin their Spring Offensive, and Hick's company is sent to northern France to help repel the invasion. They engage the Germans, and fight the Battle of Belleau Wood, as one by one members of Hick's original platoon get picked off by gunfire, bombardment, gas, and even self-inflicted injury. By the end of the novel, everyone that Hicks knew a few months before is dead, and he's been so pushed by starvation, dehydration, and exhaustion that Hicks is skirting the edge of delirium. The novel ends with Hicks losing all care in the world and going emotionally numb. Reception Contemporary reviews of Through the Wheat compared it to The Red Badge of Courage. F.

Early parish history The church on 8th Street The parish was established in 1852 by Bishop Hughes, who appointed Rev. John Murray Forbes as its first pastor. The parish began on Bond Street in the Lower East Side, but soon moved to a church building at East 8th Street at the north end of Lafayette Place, now Lafayette Street. That building had been constructed in 1811-12 on Murray Street by the Third Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church, and was designed by John McComb, Jr. in the Georgian style; it was later moved by the Associate Reformed Presbyterian congregation to the 8th Street location. When that congregation moved uptown, the building was sold to the new Roman Catholic parish., p.191 In 1870, needing more space, and wanting to establish a school,\\"The Travesty of St. Ann's Church 120 East 12th Street\\" Daytonian in Manhattan (August 10, 2011) the parish bought a church building at 120 East 12th Street, and the 8th Street building was sold to the A. T. Stewart Department Store, which utilized it as an upholstery factory.Stern:770, 772, 773. See also Parker:35. In 1879 it was turned into the Aberle‚Äôs Theater,Grzeskowiak:10. which was later called the Grand Central, John Thompson's, the Monte Cristo, the Comedy, and, in 1884, the Germania. It was torn down in 1904 due to subway construction. The St. Ann parish's new sanctuary on 12th Street had been built in 1847 as the 12th Street Baptist Church, and from 1854-67 served as the synagogue of Congregation Emanu-El, which moved there from Chrystie Street, and afterward moved to Fifth Avenue, where it remains. St. Ann's demolished everything of the 12th Street building except the facade, and Napoleon LeBrun designed a new French Gothic sanctuary, the cornerstore for which was laid on July 10, 1870. Construction of the new sanctuary, which the New York Times called \\"among the most beautiful\\" in New York City, cost $166,000. It could seat 1600 people, and was dedicated on January 1, 1871. The property extended back to 11th Street, so the parish was able to build a school. In 1920, stained glass windows were added to the church.\\"St. Ann Armenian Rite Cathedral\\" on the New York City Chapter of the American Guild of Organists website Change and demise At the time it was built, St. Ann's was among the wealthiest congregations in the city, but the evolving demographics of the neighborhood eventually required a change, and in 1983, the building was rededicated as the St. Ann's Shrine Armenian Catholic Cathedral, an Eastern Catholic church in communion with the Church of Rome. Twenty years later, in 2003, the Archdiocese of New York announced that the church would be permanently closed, despite objections by parishioners and preservationists, who petitioned the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission for landmark status, to no avail. A developer bought the building in 2005, and plans were announced for a new dormitory for New York University to be built on the site. Protests by the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation provoked NYU into promising that the concerns of the community would be taken into account in the dorm's design, but the final result was that the church was demolished, except for the facade which remains as a free-standing structure in front of the Founders Hall dormitory designed by the firm of Perkins Eastman. The AIA Guide to New York City describes the result as a futile exercise: \\"no connection is made, or even attempted, between the old church and the 26-story hulk ... the effect is of a majestic elk, shot and stuffed.\\" p.163 Pastors *Rev.

As this system is welded, damaged supports can be difficult to replace so the manufacturer offers these bolted components. Warehouse Racking Systems Adjustable pallet racking has two prime components - uprights and beams. These are arranged to provide a number of storage locations that are in general serviced by forklift trucks for the picking and placing of palletised loads. The uprights are vulnerable to damage by a forklift truck when maneuvering. Most of the damage occurs in the first metre of the frame's height. Most systems are bolted so the section can be replaced easily but one manufacturer's system is largely welded. Therefore, in this system the bottom of the front upright is a bolted leg section. When this sacrificial leg is damaged it can be replaced without having to remove the frame for repair or replacement, which would necessitate unloading a whole run of rack.

Annually approximately 16,000,000 passengers are transported. It passes the North - South corridor of Ljubljana on the busiest roads connecting ƒårnuƒçe, Je≈æica, Be≈æigrad, Bavarski dvor, Viƒç and Dolgi most.  History  In 1928 bus route Viƒç ‚Äì ƒårnuƒçe was opened. Before World War II it had been cancelled because of unreliability and competition with tramway. On 27 May 1931 a new tramway line section was opened, called the Viƒç line, with a turning point near the Viƒç church. After World War II the Viƒç was still connected to the center of town with a tramway and Be≈æigrad with Je≈æica. Since 6 October 1951 the trolleybus route Razstavi≈°ƒçe (Vilharjeva road) ‚Äì Je≈æica also connects to the town center. In May 1956 the trolleybus route was extended from Vilharjeva over a railway line passing through the Bavarski dvor to Ajdov≈°ƒçina where a temporary transfer station was located. After the abolition of the tramway in 1958, the discontinued section was handed over to trolleybus and route no. 6 and Viƒç ‚Äì Je≈æica was created. In the late sixties the trolleybus routes were discontinued and replaced with buses. In 1974 the route was extended from Je≈æica to ƒårnuƒçe, after the opening of the Eastern Ljubljana ring road. A new turning point was arranged at Dolgi most. In 1991, after the Ten-Day War night service was shortened to the 24.00. In 2002, a new turning at the parking lot Dolgi most, the first Park and Ride in Ljubljana (beginning of 90th years of the 20th century), was introduced. In November 2003 night service was extended half an hour. But, in July 2004 it was again shortened until 24.00.

Examples Vesijako (the name Vesijako actually means \\"drainage divide\\") and Lummene in the Finnish Lakeland are two nearby lakes in Finland. Both drain in two directions: into the Kymijoki basin that drains into the Gulf of Finland and into the Kokem√§enjoki basin that drains into the Gulf of Bothnia. Similarly the lakes Isoj√§rvi and Inhottu in the Karvianjoki basin in the Satakunta region of western Finland both have two outlets: from Inhottu the waters flow into the Gulf of Bothnia through the Etel√§joki River in Pori and into lake Isoj√§rvi through the Pomarkunjoki River. From lake Isoj√§rvi the waters flow to the Gulf of Bothnia through the Pohjajoki river in Pori and through the Merikarvianjoki river in Merikarvia. In the Karvianjoki basin there have formerly been two other bifurcations, which no longer exist due to human action. Another example is Bontecou Lake, a shallow, man-made bifurcation lake in Dutchess County, New York. Lake Diefenbaker in Saskatchewan is a reservoir created by damming South Saskatchewan River and Qu'Appelle River. The lake continues to drain into the two rivers, but the Qu'Appelle receives a much enlarged flow (in essence, a diversion of flow from the South Saskatchewan) due to the damming. Both rivers eventually drain into Hudson Bay via Lake Winnipeg and the Nelson River. Also located in Saskatchewan is Wollaston Lake, which is the source of Fond du Lac River draining into the Arctic Ocean and of Cochrane River draining into Hudson Bay and the Atlantic Ocean.

Unbeknownst to her husband (Gabriel Goity) and two college-age sons, she begins practicing for a tournament with a man (Arturo Goetz) she met through an ad in a puzzle shop.

Musetto in the New York Post who said, \\"If the plot of the Argentine soaper Puzzle seems familiar, that's because it's nearly identical to the story in the French movie Queen To Play.\\" Comparing this film to Lucrecia Martel's The Headless Woman, in which Maria Onetto starred in 2008, Stephen Holden of The New York Times said, \\"Although Puzzle is a much smaller, less ambitious film without the ominous political subtext of Ms. Martel's masterwork, its story...has implications about sexual inequality in Argentina's middle class.\\" Holden also notes that Smirnoff served as Martel's casting director on the 2008 film.

His extensive conquests mark the rise of the Imperial Pratiharas. Reign After Nagabhata I, there have been two rulers namely Kakkuka and Devaraja before Vatsraja came to the throne. Kakustha or Kakkuka was the nephew of Nagabhata I and nothing much is known about him. The younger brother of Kakkuka, king Devasakti or Devaraja is described as having curbed the freedom of a multitude of rulers. The statement of Jaina preceptor Uddyotana Suri, that the narrative Kuvalayamala was composed by him at Jalor in AD 778 when the ruling king was Vatsaraja, reveals that Vatsaraja ruled at Rajasthan. The evidence of the 795 CE inscription of his subordinate, brought to light by Shanta Rani Sharma, presents a detailed record of his victories over the Arabs, IndrƒÅyudha and Bengal.

Early life and education Schena was born in Buffalo, New York. He received his B.A. in biochemistry from Daniel E. Koshland, Jr. at the University of California at Berkeley in 1984. Schena received his Ph.D. in biochemistry from the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) in 1990. Schena studied as a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Biochemistry at Stanford University from 1990 until 1999. Career During his studies at Berkeley, Schena showed that changes in citrate synthase expression cause changes in flux through the citric acid cycle.Walsh, K., Schena, M., Flint, A.J., and D.E. Koshland. Compensatory regulation in metabolic pathways- responses to increases and decreases in citrate synthase levels. Biochemistry Society Symposia 54, 183‚Äì195, 1987. This work showed the importance of rate limiting steps in enzymatic pathways. As a graduate student at UCSF, Schena discovered the evolutionary conservation of cellular mechanisms across eukaryotic evolution by demonstrating the conservation of mammalian glucocorticoid receptor function in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Schena, M. and K.R. Yamamoto. Mammalian glucocorticoid receptor derivatives enhance transcription in yeast. Science 241, 965‚Äì967, 1988.

History Situated on the edge of Sherwood Forest, Boughton Pumping Station opened in 1905 together with an associated Superintendent‚Äôs house and five workers cottages which were maintained to a meticulously high standard. The Blackburn Engine House, the main pumphouse, was designed by William Beedham Starr which included a flamboyant huge brick chimney which forms a distinctive local landmark. The Pumphouse was commissioned by the Nottingham Corporation Water Department and was capable of pumping 20 million imperial gallons (91,000 m3) per day through of pipe from the underground sandstone Aquifer. There were two Manhattan-type triple-expansion steam engines from Ashton Frost of Blackburn, with standby Davy horizontal engine and triple-expansion engine by Fairbairn Lawson Combe Barbour. Boughton Pumping Station later passed into the hands of Severn Trent Water. The engine house was listed as Grade II in 1974. By 1980 it was obsolete and in need of major repair. In 1988 the uncertain future of the building took a sudden turn for the worst when it suffered mining subsidence. The damage to the buildings and surrounding landscape was alarming and the future of the building looked bleak. Boughton Pumping Station Partnership Trust secured funding to restore the buildings and by 1998 the works were complete. Since its completion in 1998 the Station has been operated as a Business Centre by several previous owners, Boughton Pumping Station Trust, Nottinghamshire County Council and NE Group. In April 2010 it was privately purchased by Horizon Investments and re-launched as Blackburn House after the original Blackburn Engines which enabled it to pump water from its well to the homes in the City of Nottingham.

Pp.76‚Äì99  History  James Haar traces the figure of the improvisatore (the singular male form of \\"improvisatori\\") back to the middle of the 14th century. Throughout the Renaissance (which Haar defines as the period spanning 1350 to 1600), an improvisatore or improvisatrice (singular feminine form of ‚Äúimprovisatori‚Äù) was unlikely to glean a living solely from performing improvised poetry (although some, like the Brandolini brothers of the 15th centuryJoseph Forsyth, Remarks on Antiquities, Arts, and Letters, During an Excursion in Italy, in the Years 1802 and 1803. Boston, Wells and Lilly, 1818. Print. P. 58. achieved a modicum of renown). Instead, the improvisatori of the Renaissance were likely to have participated in religious festivals and community celebrations, performing mainly for their friends and neighbours. During this time, however, the improvisatori were closely linked with the performance of sung madrigals, as well as the recitation of Italian oral epics, and the survival of these songs and poems is due in large part to the improvisatori of the Renaissance.James Haar, Essays on Italian Poetry and Music During the Renaissance, 1350‚Äì1600. Berkeley, University of California Press, 1986. Print. P.83 During the Italian literary \\"period of decadence,\\" which spanned most of the 17th century, Italian literature as a whole produced little notable work. Although the improvisatori likely continued to exist in some fashion during the 17th century, they did not contribute significantly to Italian literature for most of the century. 1690, however, marked the dawn of what Benedetto Croce dubbed a \\"Golden Era\\" (\\"epoca d'oro\\") of Italian improvisational poetry, which would last until around 1840.Benedetto Croce, ‚ÄúGli improvvisatori,‚Äù La Letteratura Italiana del Settecento (Bari: Laterza, 1949). Pp. 299‚Äì311. During this time, not only did the numbers of the improvisatori increase greatly, but their influence on Italian literature likewise expanded. During the first half of the 18th century, the French diplomat Charles de Brosses wrote about encountering a famous Florentine improvisatore named Bernardo Perfetti,Charles de Brosses, Lettres Famili√®res sur l‚ÄôItalie, ed. Yvonne Bezard, 2 vols. [Paris: Firmin-Didot, 1931], 1:385‚Äì387 and expressed admiration for Perfetti‚Äôs ability to express \\"true feeling\\"‚Äù in his extemporaneously-composed poetry. By 1754, the improvisatori were relevant enough within Italy that the Italian dramatist Carlo Goldoni published a play titled Poeta fanatico, in which the protagonist is an improvisational poet.Lindsay Waters, ‚ÄúThe Desultory Rhyme of Don Juan: Byron, Pulci, and the Improvisatory Style,‚Äù ELH, Vol. 45, No. 3, (Autumn, 1978), Johns Hopkins Press, p. 431 During the second half of the 18th century, the importance of the improvisatori continued to increase. By the dawn of the 19th century, the influence of the improvisatori had expanded beyond the realm of art, and improvisational poets like CorillaAvriel Goldberger, \\"Introduction\\", in Corinne, or Italy by Madame de Sta√´l. New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 1987. Print. Pp. xxix‚Äìxxx. were receiving the laurel of Petrarch, Italy's highest poetic honor.Madame de Sta√´l, Corinne, or Italy. New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 1987. Print. Pp. 19‚Äì20. Moreover, the improvisatori were by this time so widely respected that they were frequently lauded in foreign travel journals (see ‚ÄúSignificance outside of Italy‚Äù). The improvisatori continued to enjoy widespread fame and success during much of the Romantic Era. Improvisatori like Tommaso Sgricci mingled with leading English Romantic poets, including Percy Shelley and Lord Byron.Jeffrey C. Robinson. ‚ÄúRomantic Poetry: The Possibilities for Improvisation‚Äù Wordsworth Circle; Summer2007, Vol. 38 Issue 3, p. 94 Early 19th century novels, like Germaine de Sta√´l‚Äôs Corinne (1807) and Francesco Furbo‚Äôs Andrew of Padua (1820), featured improvisatori as protagonists. By 1840, however, the popularity of the improvisatori had begun to wane, likely due to some combination of stagnation in form and their overexposure to foreign tourists.Lindsay Waters, ‚ÄúThe Desultory Rhyme of Don Juan: Byron, Pulci, and the Improvisatory Style,‚Äù ELH, Vol. 45, No. 3, (Autumn, 1978), Johns Hopkins Press, p. 438James Haar, Essays on Italian Poetry and Music During the Renaissance, 1350‚Äì1600.

This improvisatrice (Signora Fantastici) and her rival La Bandettini were street performers, who would frequently pass a hat around before, during, and after improvisations, into which appreciative listeners would make donations. However, there were other settings and styles in which improvisatori might perform. Tommaso Sgricci, by Fran√ßois G√©rard (1824). Museo Civico d'Arte, Modena Beyond using the streets as theatres, some improvisatori performed at private shows. The less-famous of these improvisatori frequently performed at private residences, in which \\"a small table with writing implements, and an old shattered jingling piano, occupied one side of the room, and a small space was left in front for the poet.\\"Michael Caesar, \\"Poetic Improvisation in the Nineteenth Century: Giuseppe Regaldi and Giannina Milli,\\" The Modern Language Review, Vol. 101, No. 3 (Jul., 2006), p. 701 Other, more famous improvisatori like Tommaso Sgricci and Bernardo Sestini, could sell out entire theatres, and had to be accompanied by retinues of bodyguards.Caesar 702Esterhammer 4 In both types of private performances, the improvisatore or improvisatrice would still take suggestions for topics to perform on. However, rather than listening to the audience call out themes, the poet requested that audience members write down suggestions on spare pieces of paper and deposit them in a box before the show.Esterhammer 2Caesar 703 The suggestions would then be read to the poet and the audience at the same time, and seconds later, the poet would begin his composition (these readings could elicit significant audience reactions in their own right ‚Äì Lord Byron reports that, upon hearing \\"the apotheosis of Vittorio Alfieri\\" suggested as a topic for Sgricci to improvise upon, \\"the whole theatre burst into a shout, and the applause was continued for some moments\\"Lord Byron. The Works of Lord Byron, Complete in One Volume. Third ed. Frankfurt: H.L. Broenner, 1837. Google Books. April 2010. P. 721.). In addition to private performances, nationally-celebrated improvisatori (like Sgricci, or Corilla Olimpica, the improvisatrice whose fame and high repute in Italy inspired Madame de Sta√´l's novel Corinne ou l'Italie, before him) could be called upon to improvise for state functions and national celebrations,Avriel Goldberger, ‚ÄúIntroduction‚Äù, in Corinne, or Italy by Madame de Sta√´l.

Moreover, rural improvisatori continued performing for family and neighbours in Tuscan villages, just as their predecessors in the Renaissance used to do.Joseph Forsyth, Remarks on Antiquities, Arts, and Letters, During an Excursion in Italy, in the Years 1802 and 1803. Boston, Wells and Lilly, 1818. Print. P.60. Whatever the occasion or setting, the improvisatori rarely failed to impress their audience. Forsyth writes: > An Italian improvisatore has the benefit of a language rich in echoes.

Significance outside of Italy  Portrait of Madame de Sta√´l as Corinne on Cape Misenum by √âlisabeth Vig√©e Le Brun, Mus√©e d'Art et d'Histoire (Geneva) Despite the significant role the improvisatori played in Italian literature from the Renaissance onward, non-Italian recognition of the medium was slow to crystallize. The first French mention of the improvisatori came in de Brosses‚Äôs letter, which was written circa 1750.Charles de Brosses, Lettres Famili√®res sur l'Italie, ed. Yvonne Bezard, 2 vols. [Paris: Firmin-Didot, 1931], 1:385‚Äì387 According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the first published English mention of the word ‚Äúimprovisatori‚Äù or any of its variants came in 1766, with the publication of Tobias Smollett's Travels through France and Italy.\\"improvisatore, n.1\\" The Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd ed. 1989. OED Online. Oxford University Press. February, 2010 During the Romantic Era (c. 1785‚Äì1830), however, the improvisatori were frequently mentioned in published travel journals. French writers interested in the improvisatori included Madame de Sta√´l (author of Corinne, ou L'Italie [published 1807], a novel in which the protagonist is an improvisatrice) and Antoine Claude Pasquin (better known as Valery; he mentions no fewer than four improvisatori in his Historical, Literary, and Artistic Travels in Italy‚Ä¶ [written between 1826 and 1828]), while the Dutch had Hans Christian Andersen (author of The Improvisatore, published in 1835), and the Germans had Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (whose Italian Journey was written between 1786 and 1788, but not published until 1816). Despite heavy Continental European interest in the improvisatori, the poets were most enthusiastically admired in England, where they influenced the poets Lord Byron, Percy Shelley, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, John Keats, and Laetitia Landon, among others.Jeffrey C. Robinson. ‚ÄúRomantic Poetry: The Possibilities for Improvisation‚Äù Wordsworth Circle; Summer 2007, Vol. 38 Issue 3, p. 94 The improvisatori naturally appealed to Romantic writers captivated by concepts like William Wordsworth‚Äôs ‚Äúspontaneous overflow of emotion‚Äù and the broad Romantic concept of untutored genius.Jeffrey C.

Others, like Byron,Thomas Medwin, Conversations of Lord Byron: Noted during a Residence with his Lordship at Pisa, in the Years 1821 and 1822, London: Henry Colburn, 1824. P. 166 were more skeptical. Esterhammer notes \\"available paradigms for representing the nineteenth-century improvisatore‚Ä¶ ranged from Romantic genius to manipulative professional, and responses varied from ridicule to rapture.\\"Esterhammer 8 It is important to note that while some criticism was directed at the quality of an improvised poem, most critiques were instead focused on the incompatibility of improvisation with the written medium. So, while Caesar notes that the Anglo-Irish diarist Anna Jameson classified one particular improvisation of Sestini‚Äôs to be ‚Äúa failure,‚ÄùCaesar 701 and Forsyth discusses an improviser unable to satisfactorily end his performance (‚Äúwith each verse, he further complicated his plot, frustrating himself and his audience [until] he cursed ‚ÄòMaledetto!‚Äô and ran off‚ÄùForsyth 62), these sentiments are exception, rather than rule. Instead, it is far more common for writers to complain about the supposed inconsistencies of improvised works ‚Äì inconsistencies that usually appear once an improvised poem is examined in a written medium. For example, Byron told Shelley ‚Äú[Sgricci‚Äôs] printed poetry is tame stuff\\"Medwin 167 during a conversation about the phenomenon of improvisational poetry. Similarly, Forsyth lamented > Lady Fantastici [has] a wonderful command of powers; yet, judging from her > studied and published compositions, which are dull enough, I should suspect > that this impromptu exercise seldom leads to poetical excellence. Serafino > d'Acquila, the first improvvisatore that appeared in the language, was gazed > at in the Italian courts as a divine and inspired being, till he published > his verses and dispelled the illusion.Forsyth 61 The notion that improvisers were skilled performers who possessed ‚Äúskill, practice, [and] talent; but none of the felicities of higher art‚ÄùForsyth 60 frequently accompanied accounts of improvisation, forming a curious contrast with prevailing opinions that improvisers exemplified the Romantic notion of untutored genius.

The school's name is often shortened to \\"Evans High School\\" or \\"E-HIGH\\", and the mascot for the school are the Trojans. It primarily serves students from Pine Hills, in addition to some students from nearby Clarcona and Lockhart. The original main campus is located on Silver Star Road at the intersection of Pine Hills Road. Starting in 2010, the entire school was demolished and completely rebuilt; with construction completed in December 2011. The new campus reopened in 2012. Evans High's academic performance, based upon results of the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test (FCAT), was consistently rated at a \\"D\\" or \\"F\\". However, the school improved in 2011 by earning a \\"C\\" for the first time in the school's history. As of the 2012-2013 school year, Evans received its first \\"B\\" in the school's history. The 9th Grade Center served as the main campus during construction, and the new campus was opened for classes on January 3, 2012. History Plans to build a new high school in Pine Hills began in the early 1950s. Until then, students in Pine Hills were bussed to Edgewater High School, Apopka High School and, to a lesser extent, Winter Park High School. Evans High opened in 1958 with grades 7, 8 and 9 and was officially named \\"Maynard Evans High School\\". It was named in honor of a local pharmacist, Maynard Evans, who owned a pharmacy and soda shop in downtown Orlando named \\"Evans Pharmacy\\". The following year, grades 10, 11 and 12 were added. The first graduating class was the Class of 1960. Evans High was built during the height of segregation and it wasn't until 1971 when the school was finally desegregated. During the 1960s and into the 1970s, the campus grew to include a gymnasium, media center, auditorium, and a stadium shared by Edgewater High School named the \\"Double E Stadium\\". In the 1980s up until the mid-1990s, Evans High was one of the largest schools in Orange County. The student population peaked at 4,500 and in 1993 the 9th Grade Center opened to the west of the main campus. Evans' demographics also began to change in the 1980s as newer high schools were constructed on its periphery, removing previous students from its catchment area. This also coincided with a demographic shift in its core catchment area of Pine Hills as that community fell into decline. Today, as a near total reversal from its pre-1971 status, the school is now minority majority. By 2005, declining conditions on the main campus proved detrimental to the students' education. The Orange County school board planned to build a new $37 million school on board owned land adjacent to the 9th Grade Center Campus. This plan was met with fierce opposition by the mayor of Ocoee and nearby residents; prompting the Orange County Board of County Commissioners to reject the school board's plan in 2008. The school board thus decided to build a new school on the main campus at a cost of $75 million. The 9th Grade Center served as the main campus during construction and the new campus was opened for classes on January 3, 2012. The 9th Grade center is supposedly being used as \\"Trojan academy\\". Demographics In the 2007‚Äì2008 school year, the racial makeup of the Evans student body is: 84% Black, 9% Hispanic, 3% White, and 2% Asian and Pacific Islander. (Source: FL Dept. of Education, 2007‚Äì2008) Evans High School has the largest percentage of Haitian students in Orlando.https://www.ocps.net/_layouts/viewDetails.aspx?list=a7a2049d-36b3-4e96-bcfa- ab56f9aad3e2&item;=199 Athletics Current Athletic Director is Iris Woodard.

Its objective was to send supplies to the Israeli enclave in the northwestern Negev desert by air, and create a suitable airfield for this purpose. The operation commenced on August 23, 1948, when the first aircraft landed at a newly created field in Ruhama (raising much dust, giving a name to the operation), and lasted until October 21, when a land corridor was created between the Negev and the rest of Israel. A total of 417 flights were made during the operation, transporting 2,235 tons of supplies and 1,911 people to the Negev, and evacuating 5,098 people. Initially, Douglas C-54 Skymasters, Lockheed Constellations and Curtiss C-46 Commandos were used, but later, the IAF also made use of Douglas Dakotas and Noorduyn Norsemans. The main military obstacle was a seesaw battle with the Egyptian army at Khirbet Mahaz, lasting between September 29 and October 6. Background Khirbet Mahaz from the air, 1948 As a response to the Morrison‚ÄìGrady Plan of 1946, the Jewish Yishuv decided to erect 11 new villages in the northern Negev desert in order to ensure that the territory would become part of a Jewish state in any future political decision. On May 15, 1948, following Israel's declaration of independence, the armies of several Arab states invaded the new state. The Egyptian army advanced along the coastal road, stopping at the Sukreir Bridge and remaining there following Operation Pleshet, an Israeli offensive on the column near the bridge. The Egyptians then set up positions in the Majdal ‚Äì Bayt Jibrin road in order to strengthen their hold on the area and disconnect the Negev villages from the rest of Israel. The Israelis made two major attempts to break through the blockade‚ÄîOperation An-Far and Operation Death to the Invader‚Äîbut failed to create its own wedge between the Egyptian forces. On July 18, 1948, the second truce to the war came into effect, ending the hostilities with the Negev still divided. Before the Egyptians created the bypass, United Nations observers visited the area and determined that the Israelis controlled a passageway to the Negev at the beginning of the truce. Israel used this pretext to launch Operation GYS 1 and GYS 2 in July 1948, but failed to secure a permanent corridor, and the Negev remained disconnected. Meanwhile, the situation in the Negev was becoming more dire, as supplies ran out. On August 18, 1948, it was estimated that the combined Negev villages had enough food only for several days. Also in August 1948, the leadership of Czechoslovakia ordered that the Israeli Air Force supply base at ≈Ωatec be shut down. This base, codenamed Etzion, was used in Operation Balak, the shipment of arms to Israel. This freed up a number of IAF transport aircraft that could be used in Israel, although no place existed to hold them. For this purpose, the Ekron Airfield was refitted and expanded, officially opening on August 17. The IAF's Transport Squadron then held an exercise which tested its abilities to move large quantities of goods. Preparations Avak 1 near Ruhama The decision to send aid to the Negev by air came on August 18, in a top echelon army meeting. The plan was to transport 2,000 tons of food, fuel and supplies; and to replace the Negev Brigade--exhausted and numerically depleted--with the Yiftach Brigade, which participated in Operation GYS but did not otherwise operate in the southern front. The first task was to find a suitable location for a new airfield. Such a location was found on August 19, between Ruhama and Shoval, and over the next three days, an open space of 1,122 m (3,680 ft.) in length and 35 m (115 ft.) in width was cleared. The supplies for transport where meanwhile transported to the Ekron Airbase. During the following days, much of the Yiftach Brigade covertly made their way to the Negev by land, just west of Kawkaba and Huleikat, bypassing Egyptian positions. Ruhama airfield during Operation Avak. August 1948 Flights and ground operations The first flights of Operation Avak took place on August 23, 1948, with four-engined Douglas C-54 Skymaster and Lockheed Constellation aircraft, and twin-engined Curtiss C-46 Commandos. The first aircraft landed at the new Ruhama Airfield at 18:00 on August 23, and carried essential supplies for maintaining the field and assisting later aircraft. It raised a lot of dust (, Avak), coining a name for the operation and the landing strip (hence named Avak 1). During the following days, the airfield was fitted with an electric generator and the runway lit with electric lights. On the first day, 29 tons of supplies were brought to the Negev. While only 14‚Äì15 tons were planned to be transported per day, the air force proved capable of increasing the capacity to 75 by the third day of the operation, a pace which it kept up until the end of the operation. Part of the reason why the load was increased had been the fear of heavy rainfall in the coming months that could disrupt the dirt airfield's operations. This created the possibility however, that the extra fuel used by the transporters would deplete the available supply and significantly diminish the IAF's capabilities during the planned large-scale operation in the area (codenamed Ten Plagues, later Yoav). The IDF thus made emergency acquisitions of fuel from other countries. During much of the operation, about 8 flights per day took place, eventually totaling 417. In order to insure the safety of the new field, nightly patrols and ambushes were conducted by IDF forces. As Yiftach Brigade units reached the individual villages, the Negev Brigade forces were slowly evacuated northwards, leaving their supplies to their replacements. Meanwhile, the search for suitable landing strip locations did not end and on October 10, an area just south of Urim was cleared for Avak 2. The first aircraft landed there on the same night. The Yiftach Brigade, which gained much experience fighting in the Galilee, the Jezreel Valley, and in Operation Danny, was not accustomed to fighting in regions of flat topography, such as that of the Negev. Its troops immediately fanned out and captured a number of outlying positions which represented much of the high ground in the area. This was in contrast to the Negev Brigade which concentrated on defending the villages under its responsibility. Battle of Khirbet Mahaz In the beginning of September 1948, the Egyptian army made numerous attempts to disrupt or disable the Ruhama Airfield. The Israeli and Egyptian forces wrestled for control over the tells surround the field, but this ended on September 7‚Äì8, when the Yiftach Brigade took Tell al-Quneitra, Tell al-Najjila and Tell al-Muleiha, and fended off an Egyptian counterattack that lasted two days. However, as Yiftach consolidated its positions and expanded to Tell al- Hesi and Khirbet Mahaz (a field cannon's range from the airfield) over the course of the month, the Egyptians mounted a response. Yiftach Brigade position at Khirbet Mahaz, 1948 Yiftach originally captured the position of Khirbet Mahaz on September 29‚Äì30, and on September 30, an Egyptian force under Gamal Abdel Nasser retook it. Yiftach returned on the night of October 1‚Äì2 (finding the place empty), and in the following two days managed to repel Egyptian assaults backed by armor and artillery. On October 4, the Egyptians unleashed a heavy barrage of the area and a mechanized force from the 4th Brigade again captured the position. On the same day, the Israelis returned and took it once more. The Egyptians bombarded the position with eight Supermarine Spitfire aircraft on October 5, managing to disrupt Yiftach's forward headquarters at Tell al-Najjila just southwest, but did not dislodge the forces at Khirbet Mahaz. Egypt renewed its assault on October 6, when twelve armored vehicles backed by infantry attacked Khirbet Mahaz from the north. Israeli field artillery was deployed in Tell al-Najjila in order to help halt the advance. The Egyptians stopped about 150 m away from the position and attempted to encircle it with 2 inch mortar teams. The Israelis sent a half-track force (one of them mounting a cannon) to intercept the attack, including another encirclement attempt. They managed to destroy two Egyptian vehicles. In the afternoon, the Egyptians retreated and took up positions 1.5 km north of Khirbet Mahaz. Aftermath Operation Avak was a success and relieved the besieged Israeli forces in the Negev, allowing them to play an active role in Operation Yoav, when a permanent land corridor with the rest of Israel was opened. It significantly raised their morale and fighting ability, as many of the troops had been stranded in the Negev for eight months. The operation led to the transformation of the Negev Brigade, which was completely re-supplied (having left their supplies to the Yiftach Brigade), and gained about 1,000 new soldiers.

Headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama, American's diversified product line also includes static castings and high performance fire pumps. History Many believe that American was founded by John Joseph Eagan; however, it was, in fact, Charlotte Blair, a businesswoman who conceived of the idea for the pipe company. She and her brother James recruited the initial investors, including Mr. Eagan, who was the company's first president and later sole proprietor. Mr. Eagan's vision was a company built on the Golden Rule‚Äîtreat others the way you want to be treated‚Äîthat would be of service to God and humankind. This philosophy still guides the business today. In 1924, Mr. Eagan died of complications from TB. Upon his death, having previously acquired all of the stock of the company, he willed ownership of the company in a trust to its employees. In the 1920s, American developed a proprietary Mono-Cast centrifugal casting method and increased pipe diameters to a record 24 inches (610 mm). The company also introduced cement-lined pipe, which became the industry standard. The company‚Äôs first official safety program served as an industry model. A program of excellent employee benefits became synonymous with the American name. The financial crash of 1929 had little effect on the company at first, but soon, business started to decline resulting in a loss of jobs. But by the mid-1930s, government spending on municipal water supplies, fire protection and sanitation brought a resurgence in business and helped restore jobs. In 1939, business was further boosted by federal defense spending to support the impending war. When the country entered World War II, American was asked to apply its centrifugal casting experience to another metal ‚Äì steel. The manufacturing of steel parts for ships, planes and tanks led to the creation of a new Special Products Division for steel products, the first diversification in American‚Äôs history. The 1940s were marked by the industrial invention of a stronger and more durable iron called ductile iron. American took a lead role in use of this new iron to make large-diameter pipe that was thinner yet stronger. The country‚Äôs growing population and rapidly expanding infrastructure in the 1950s and 1960s meant more demand for pipe for use in water, energy, transportation and sanitation systems. In 1955, American shipped its first large order of ductile iron pipe. A new melting system in 1972, including the largest cupola of its kind in the world, would supply the new iron for this pipe, and American would move from a Sand Spun casting process to a generation of deLavaud metal molds, still used today. Throughout the 1960s, American would continue to diversify, adding its valves and hydrants product line and gaskets. American‚Äôs innovation, diversification and capital investments saw it through economically challenging times in the early 1980s. It expanded its steel pipe business and acquired Waterous Company of St. Paul, Minnesota, to add fire pumps to its product line and increase market share in valves and hydrants. Throughout the 1990s the company embraced the digital age, applying computing and Internet technologies across the board. It also opened a scrap recycling facility on site. As the new millennium dawned, American was poised for further growth, opening American SpiralWeld Pipe Company in Columbia, South Carolina, and diversifying its product line to include spiral-welded steel pipe in diameters up to 144 inches (3,700 mm). Also in 2000, American engineered a single electrode DC furnace, the only one of its kind in the world. The turn of the century would bring a host of innovations for American's water works divisions, including zinc-coated ductile iron pipe, the AFC Mapper for utility asset management, gate valves up to 60 inches in diameter and American's Earthquake Joint System. Its Steel Pipe Division would also see major developments. In 2015, American Steel Pipe completed a $70-million expansion, including a new 150,000-square-foot processing facility and upgrades to its two mills. Divisions American Steel Pipe American Steel Pipe, based in Birmingham, Alabama, produces electric-resistance-welded steel pipe. Applications include high pressure oil and gas transmission lines, distribution main lines, offshore gathering systems, steel pipe pilings, abrasive-resistance pipe, HIC resistant pipe for sour service, dredge pipe, and product pipelines. American Ductile Iron Pipe American Ductile Iron Pipe, based in Birmingham, Alabama, manufactures ductile iron pipe in standard 20-foot lengths ranging from 4-64 inches in diameter. The company‚Äôs product line also features joints of various types designed for ease of installation and dependability in a variety of conditions. American also furnishes standard and special linings and coatings. American Flow Control In March 1991, American Cast Iron Pipe Company merged its two valve- and hydrant-producing subsidiaries‚ÄîAmerican-Darling Valve and Waterous‚Äîinto one division, American Flow Control. This merger yielded a division active in the design and production of waterworks and fire protection products. Production facilities are located in Beaumont, Texas, and South St. Paul, Minnesota. American Spiral-Weld Pipe American SpiralWeld Pipe Company, LLC was established as a division of American in 1999. American SpiralWeld, located on a site in Columbia, South Carolina, manufactures spiral-welded steel pipe for use in water, wastewater, hydropower, and industrial applications. In 2013, American announced a new spiral-welded pipe production facility in Flint, Michigan. The facility began operations in 2015. American Castings American Castings, LLC is located in Pryor, Oklahoma. The plant produces grey and ductile iron castings for automotive, heavy-equipment, industrial machinery and other product manufacturers.

Its mission is to improve student performance in the subjects of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) in the United States. It attempts to do this by scaling up local academic programs to a national level. History of the Initiative In 2005, the National Academies commissioned a report titled ‚ÄúRising Above the Gathering Storm‚Äù which asserts that student achievement in the subjects of math and science has declined in the United States, while other countries have increased their student achievement scores in the same subject areas. The report recommended the creation of a non-profit organization to help marshal private sector support to help improve math and science education in the United States. Several authors of the report partnered with Peter O‚ÄôDonnell Jr. to meet this need, effectively establishing NMSI's board of directors and committing to bring both the UTeach and NMSI's College Readiness program (formerly known as NMSI's Comprehensive AP Program and the Advanced Placement Training and Incentive Program (APTIP)) to scale nationally. ExxonMobil invested $125 million to launch the effort, which was later supplemented by an additional $125 million from corporations, foundations, individual donors and government agencies ‚Äì creating an effective public-private partnership model that continues to sustain the organization today. NMSI's Programs NMSI has expanded three programs to a national scale: NMSI‚Äôs College Readiness Program, NMSI‚Äôs Laying the Foundation Program, and NMSI's UTeach Expansion Program. NMSI‚Äôs College Readiness Program NMSI's College Readiness Program is a three-year program in which teachers go through rigorous professional development to better prepare themselves and their students for Advanced Placement Exams. The prototype for NMSI's program, Advanced Placement Strategies (APS) was launched as a public-private partnership in the Dallas area in 1995 by a group of local businessmen committed to education reform. The goal of the APS program was to improve college readiness and encourage STEM studies for underserved Texas public high school students by increasing participation and performance in AP math, science and English courses. Texas schools in their first year of the APS program increased their exam participation by 198 percent. In the 2008‚Äì2009 school year, NMSI replicated the APS program as the Advanced Placement Training and Incentive Program (APTIP) and in its first year, the program increased enrollment in AP courses by nearly 70 percent, including a 122 percent increase among African American and Hispanic students. The number of passing AP math, science, and English exams also increased by 52 percent, which was nine times the national average; for African American and Hispanic students, the increase in passing AP scores was 71.5 percent. On September 1, 2012, APS officially merged with NMSI to bring this program to scale throughout the United States. More than 50,000 students are now enrolled in the NMSI College Readiness Program, and it is currently being implemented in more than 550 schools in 22 states. The most recent results show a continuing trend of student improvement. Over the life cycle of the NMSI program, the number of average passing scores on AP math, science and English exams increased by 144 percent, compared to 23.2 percent nationally. The average three-year increase in the number of passing math, science and English scores among minorities enrolled in the NMSI program is 219 percent compared to the national average of 48.5 percent. The number of average passing scores for females enrolled in the NMSI program increased by 87 percent, compared to 8.7 percent nationally. In 2010, the organization received funding from the Lockheed Martin Corporation to launch the AP program in schools serving military bases. In April 2011, First Lady Michelle Obama and Dr. Jill Biden announced the expansion of the program as part of their national Joining Forces initiative, which aims to provide support and resources to military personnel and their families in the areas of employment, housing, health care, education, etc. Mrs. Obama and Dr. Biden made the announcement at a community event at Fountain-Fort Carson High School in Fountain, Colo. As of January 2014, NMSI's College Readiness Program is being implemented in 71 schools serving military families in 18 states. NMSI's Laying the Foundation Program In January 2012, NMSI merged with Laying the Foundation, an organization which focused on professional development for math, science, and English teachers, grades 6-12. After the merge, NMSI's Laying the Foundation teacher training program was expanded to include training for elementary teachers, grades 3‚Äì5. In 2012, NMSI was selected to work with the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers (PARCC) consortium to lead Common Core State Standards training in 22 states and create the Educator Leader Cadre. In August 2013, NMSI received a $248,760 grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to develop a series of web- based training modules for teachers who have attended NMSI's Laying the Foundation Program. NMSI's UTeach Expansion Program The UTeach Program originated at The University of Texas at Austin in 1997, enabling students who are majoring in math, science, or computer science to receive full teaching certification without adding time or cost to their degrees. The national replication process is directed by NMSI in conjunction with the UTeach Institute. The NMSI-supported replication of the UTeach program for preparing teachers was launched in 2008 in 13 universities in nine states (Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Pennsylvania, and Texas). On Jan. 6, 2010, President Barack Obama mentioned the UTeach program at a White House education event, saying, ‚ÄúTo bring more educators into the classroom, the National Math and Science Initiative is working with Texas Instruments and the Dell Foundation to prepare almost 5,000 new math and science teachers in the next five years -- through a program that allows young people to earn teaching certificates and science degrees at the same time.‚Äù Furthermore, the UTeach Institute projects that 9,000 UTeach program graduates will have impacted 4.8 million secondary STEM students nationwide by 2020. On February 4, 2014, it was announced that NMSI is expanding the program to 5 additional universities thanks to a $22.5 million grant from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, bringing the total number of UTeach Replication sites to 40 across 19 states. Another 5 will be added in 2015 through the HHMI funding. Funding Major support for the National Math and Science Initiative has been provided by the Exxon Mobil Corporation, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation, and the Texas Instruments Foundation, with in-kind assistance provided by IBM and Perot Systems. Additional funding for UTeach replication comes from the Texas High School Project, the Greater Texas Foundation, the Tennessee Higher Education Commission, the Tennessee Department of Education, the Texas Education Agency, the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation, and other private philanthropy. With funding from the Carnegie Corporation of New York and the Michael & Susan Dell Foundation, NMSI also is preparing an alumni network for UTeach graduates. Leadership Bernard A.

Leid (born c. 1953) is a Trinidadian American, former activist in the Civil Rights Movement, and journalist. She was the managing editor of The City Sun and general manager of New York radio station WBAI. In 2004, The Miami Herald wrote that she \\"prides herself on never working in the mainstream media during her 34 years of journalism\\". Life and career Leid was born in Princes Town, Trinidad, the seventh child of Claude and Gertrude Leid. When she was 18, Leid came to the United States and attended Adelphi University. She returned to Trinidad and Tobago, where she spent nine months investigating the aftermath of an unsuccessful coup d'√©tat. Leid's research was cut short when the government seized her notes. She decided to move back to the United States. Leid worked as a receptionist at the New York Amsterdam News for six months, and in 1977 she and Andrew W. Cooper, a columnist at the newspaper, left to establish the Trans-Urban News Service (TUNS). TUNS trained minority journalists and produced reporting that was relevant to their communities. The Public Relations Society of America gave TUNS its top award in 1979 for its multi-part series on racial tensions between blacks and Jews in Crown Heights. Cooper and Leid co-founded The City Sun, a weekly newspaper that covered issues of interest to African Americans in New York City, in 1984. According to The New York Times, The City Sun had a circulation of 18,500 in 1987. Leid resigned from the paper in 1992 after a dispute with Cooper. By one account, she asked Cooper for complete control of the paper and he refused. By her account, Leid left because Cooper was inflating the newspaper's circulation. The New York Times reported that readers of The City Sun said the paper published \\"its most hard-hitting issues\\" during Leid's tenure, and that it \\"stopped being [a] must-read\\" after she left. In 1993, Leid started working at WBAI, where she hosted a talk radio program called Talkback! The New York Daily News described the show as \\"serious talk\\" and said that Leid covered a wide range of topics. The Daily News also noted that Leid sometimes gave her listeners homework. On December 22, 2000, the board of directors of Pacifica Radio, which controlled WBAI, removed the station's general manager and asked Leid to replace her. Two other long-time staff members were also dismissed. Leid and Pacifica's executive director changed the locks at the station's doors. The changes, which became known as the \\"Christmas Coup\\", prompted several protest demonstrations that involved more than 1,000 people. On March 5, 2001, Leid interrupted an interview with Congressmember Major Owens, who was discussing the events at WBAI. \\"Lies have been told,\\" she announced, and began to broadcast a music program. In August, Amy Goodman, the host of WBAI's Democracy Now!, said that Leid had shoved her during a heated discussion. By late 2001, several groups of listeners and dissident radio hosts sued the Pacifica board. The board settled the lawsuits and agreed to grant more autonomy to WBAI. Leid resigned her position in December. In 2002 Leid moved to Florida, and in 2004 she became editor of The Broward Times, a weekly newspaper that focused on issues of interest to African Americans and Afro- Caribbean Americans in Broward County.

It is located on the boundary between the districts of Ahrweiler and Mayen-Koblenz in Rhineland-Palatinate.  Geography and geology  N√ºrburg The Hohe Acht is located in the High Eifel east of Adenau. The mountain is a Tertiary volcano, whose cone is composed of Lower Devonian rock and whose summit is made of basalt.  Emperor William Tower  In 1908/09 the Emperor William Tower (Kaiser-Wilhelm-Turm) was erected on the Hohe Acht. The reason for the construction of this stone observation tower, based on plans by the architect, Freiherr von Tettau of Berlin, was the silver wedding of Emperor William II and Empress Augusta Victoria as well as the commemoration of Emperor William I The tower is high and its walls are one metre thick at ground level. The work was carried out by master masons, Karl and Johannes Leidinger, from Adenau using local stone. The cost of construction was 18,000 marks. The tower has been a protected monument since 1987. The Emperor William Tower offers a superb view across the whole Eifel (including the mountains of Scharteberg, D√∂hmberg, Michelsberg, Hochth√ºrmerberg, Sch√∂neberg, the nearby N√ºrburg Castle and Hochkelberg), as well as the Siebengebirge and its Gro√üer √ñlberg and, in conditions of good visibility, as far as the Westerwald, the Taunus, the Hunsr√ºck and the Lower Rhine.  Walking and winter sports  There is a network of footpaths around the Hohe Acht and, at many places there are good views over the Eifel landscape. In winter the Hohe Acht has some very good winter sport facilities including prepared cross country skiing trails, toboggan runs and ski lifts.  Motor racing  Very close to the Hohe Acht on a high volcanic cone is N√ºrburg Castle. A section of the North loop (Nordschleife) on the Formula 1 racetrack at the N√ºrburgring is known as the Hohe Acht.

It was built in the 1907, taken over by the Lancashire Cotton Corporation in the 1930s and passed to Courtaulds in 1964. Production finished in the 1960s, the engine was scrapped in 1967, and the mill demolished in 1995. Location Droylsden is a town within the Metropolitan Borough of Tameside, in Greater Manchester, England. It is situated to the east of Manchester city centre, and west-southwest of Ashton-under-Lyne. Historically a part of Lancashire, Droylsden grew as a mill town around the cotton mills established in the mid-19th century, and the Ashton and Peak Forest canals. Saxon Mill was built on Medlock Street, adjacent to the Hollinwood Branch Canal in 1906. History Saxon mill was built in 1906, for the Saxon Mill Co. Ltd, a company formed by the Ashton Syndicate who were responsible for Minerva Mill, Ashton-under-Lyne etc. In 1908 it had 80,000 spindles which rose to 82,000 in 1920, when it was recapitalised. The industry had peaked in 1912 when it produced 8 billion yards of cloth. The Great War of 1914‚Äì18 had halted the supply of raw cotton, and the British government encouraged its colonies to build mills to spin and weave cotton. The war over, Lancashire never regained its markets. The independent mills were struggling. The Bank of England set up the Lancashire Cotton Corporation in 1929 to attempt to rationalise and save the industry. Saxon Mill, Droylsden was one of 104 mills bought by the LCC, and one of the 53 mills that survived through to 1950. It was switched to rayon production. In 1953 it employed 250 people. It was the last mill in the country to produce cop weft.catgate Architecture This was a large four-storey building on a low basement, 18 bays long and 14 bays wide, built of Accrington brick with some yellow sandstone detailing. The shallow buttresses between the windows were embellished at third-floor level. It had a flat roof, tanked to collect water to supplement the water tower. The top three floors were used for spinning frames, the ground floor for preparation machines, and the basement to condition the cotton. The mill was constructed as a grid of cast iron I-beams. The transverse beams were supported on cast iron columns, supporting the longitudinal beams that in turn supported shallow brick vaults. They ran the entire length of the mill, making a fireproof ceiling and floor. Power It was driven by a 1500 hp cross compound engine by Daniel Adamson built in 1907. It had a 24-foot flywheel with 36 ropes, which operated at 65 ¬Ω rpm. New Cylinders by George Saxon, were fitted in 1915. Its cylinders, 27\\"HP, 56\\"LP, had a 5-foot stroke.

Early life Meyer was born in Bielefeld, the son of Therese (Melchior) and Gustav Meyer, a notary, who had fought in the First World War. His family was Jewish. Aged 14, he was sent by his parents from Nazi Germany to the Netherlands on 4 January 1939 as part of a Kindertransport convoy, and settled in Holland on his own. Their decision was made after Hajo was no longer permitted to attend school in the aftermath of Kristallnacht, His parents' maxim was: 'We do not dote to death on children' (bei uns gibt es keine Affenliebe).Hajo G. Meyer, Briefe eines Fl√ºchtlings 1939‚Äì1945: Ein j√ºdischer Junge im holl√§ndischen Exil, Frank & Timme GmbH, 2014 p.9. He went into hiding in 1943, but was arrested after a year and spent ten months in Auschwitz. After Auschwitz he swore would never speak German again. He broke the rule at a scientific conference in Amsterdam after the war, when he happened to be speaking on a similar topic to that discussed by Hermann Haken.Bernd Kr√∂ger, Hermann Haken: From the Laser to Synergetics: A Scientific Biography of the Early Years, Springer, 2014 p.39 n.149. His parents had originally been deported to Theresienstadt concentration camp in 1943, and after his father succumbed to an illness on 15 May 1944, it was decided that there was no more reason to allow his widow Therese to stay on, and that she should be deported to Auschwitz. She had hidden a cyanide capsule in a piece of bread and chose suicide, knowing that the chances of survival there were non-existent.Briefe, 2014 p.16. Post- Holocaust After the war, Meyer returned to the Netherlands, and studied theoretical physics. He eventually became director of the Phillips Physics Laboratory (NatLab). After his retirement he took courses in woodwork and constructed violins and violas.Henry Zeffman, 'Hajo Meyer profile: Physicist who survived Auschwitz,' The Times 1 August 2018. Later career In his later years, Meyer became politically active, including as director of A Different Jewish Voice. He wrote Het einde van het Jodendom (The End of Judaism) in 2003,.Pallade, 2009 p.57, n.60 which accuses Israel of abusing the Holocaust to justify crimes against the Palestinians. In the book he is reported to have used phrases such as the \\"Israeli Wehrmacht,\\" and the \\"Jewish SS.\\"Yves Pallade ' \\"New\\" Anti-Semitism in contemporary German academic,' p.45. In lectures he argued that \\"what is happening to the Palestinians every day under the occupation\\" was \\"almost identical\\" with \\"what was done to the German Jews even before the 'Final Solution,'\\" and also maintained that Israel's demeanour is the main cause of the post-war re-emergence of anti- Semitism.'Yves Pallade p.49 He was a member of the International Jewish Anti- Zionist Network. He participated in the 2011 \\"Never Again ‚Äì For Anyone\\" tour. Meyer argued there are different interpretations of Judaism, and that Jews ought to return to the principles of the Book of Leviticus and the rabbinical principles of figures like Hillel, and avoid the 'doomsday Judaism' he identifies in the Book of Joshua and the positions of Abraham Isaac Kook which have in his view underwritten Zionism.Moises F. Salinas, Hazza Abu Rabi, Resolving the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict: Perspectives on the Peace Process, Cambria Books, 2009 p.136 Meyer has repeatedly argued that there are parallels between the Nazi treatment of Jews leading to (but not including) the Holocaust, and Israel's dehumanization of Palestinians. At one talk, organized and hosted by the leader of the UK's Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, in 2010, Meyer was later reported to have repeatedly likened Israel's actions against the people of the Gaza Strip to the mass killing of Jews in the Holocaust and likened the government of Israel to that of Nazi Germany. Sarah Marsh, 'Corbyn apologises over event where Israel was compared to Nazis,' The Guardian 1 August 2018 During the talk, Meyer said that \\"Judaism in Israel has been substituted by the Holocaust religion, whose high priest is Elie Wiesel.\\" Meyer claimed Zionism predates fascism, that Zionists and fascists had a history of cooperation charging, among other things, that Israel wants to foment anti-Semitism in the world to encourage more Jews to migrate to Israel.M Ghazali Khan, 'Muslims, Jews and Christians Join Together to Condemn Zionism,' Indian Muslims org. 2 July 2006. Meyer spoke in favor of Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions against Israel. In his last recorded interview, coinciding with the 2014 Israel-Gaza Conflict, Meyer lambasted Zionists as Nazi criminals, asserted that German hatred of Jews was less deeply grounded than Israeli-Jewish hatred of Palestinians, and denounced PM Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks that demonstrations against the war were evidence of hatred of Israel. He was first signatory of a statement by 250 Holocaust and descendants of Holocaust survivors protesting that war.Suzanne Weiss, 'Holocaust survivor condemns Gaza massacre,' Green Left Weekly Issue 1021 17 August 2014. His correspondence with his parents while in exile during the war were published. His elder brother Alfred's autobiography also dwells on their experiences during the war.Alfred G.Meyer, My Life as a Fish: A Memoir, Ann Arbor 2000 p,28. Theory of \\"sequential traumatizing\\" of Jews Meyer developed a theory based on the work of Hans Keilson regarding \\"sequential traumatizing,\\" according to which Jewish collective remembering in a ritual setting of numerous past traumatic events befalling the community. Meyer argues that the current government of Israel has used this re-traumatization of Jews with regard to the Holocaust, in order to indoctrinate and inculcate loyalty to Israel against its enemies. He applied this to the Israeli- Palestinian conflict, arguing that Israel dehumanizes Palestinians the same way that Nazi Germany dehumanized Jews.David Whitten Smith, Elizabeth Geraldine Burr, Understanding World Religions: A Road Map for Justice and Peace, Rowman & Littlefield 2014 p.101-102.Lawrence Swaim, The Death of Judeo- Christianity: Religious Aggression and Systemic Evil in the Modern World, John Hunt Publishing, 2012 p.18. He expanded on this sense of an analogy in the following terms: > I cannot help but hear echoes of the Nazi mythos of \\"blood and soil\\" in the > rhetoric of settler fundamentalism which claims a sacred right to all the > lands of biblical Judea and Samaria. The various forms of collective > punishment visited upon the Palestinian people ‚Äî coerced ghettoization > behind a \\"security wall\\"; the bulldozing of homes and destruction of fields; > the bombing of schools, mosques, and government buildings; an economic > blockade that deprives people of the water, food, medicine, education and > the basic necessities for dignified survival ‚Äî force me to recall the > deprivations and humiliations that I experienced in my youth.Hajo Meyer, 'An > Ethical Tradition Betrayed,' Huffington Post 25 May 2010 Accusation of antisemitism Henryk Broder was sentenced in 2006 to a term in prison by a German court after he had publicly accused anti-Zionists like Meyer and for their putative \\"capacities for applied Judeophobia\\" (Kapazit√§ten f√ºr angewandte Jud√§ophobie) because they had compared the Israeli occupation policy to measures taken by the Nazis.Hannes Stein, 'Wer ist Antisemit?

It is also used as the village hall. The frame building, combining elements of the Queen Anne and Shingle architectural styles, dates to the early 20th century. Its exterior incorporates aspects of local train station architecture. It was built by the widow of prominent gynecologist Alexander Skene, who summered in the area, and had founded the library several years before. In addition to her own contributions and contributions from villagers, she raised money from Andrew Carnegie, making it one of the many Carnegie libraries. Later it was deeded to the village. In 2001 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The library currently features a collection of books on the Catskills and Hudson River region among its 15,000 volumes. Building The library is on an lot on the north side of Main Street in Fleischmanns' small downtown. The neighborhood is a mix of commercial and residential buildings. Behind the lot is woodlands, rising slightly to a low hill behind a small parking lot. In front is a small lawn with stone monuments to local war veterans, and the sidewalk. Exterior The building itself is an L-shaped one-story structure on a stone foundation sided in wood shingles. Four narrow wood moldings run around the eave, lintel, sill and water table levels. The high hipped roofs are shingled in asbestos with broad overhanging eaves supported by brackets. Stone chimneys rise from the west side and the east rear. At the center of the south (front) facade is a porch supported by Doric columns and a wooden balustrade topped by a wide frieze and triglyph with dentilled moldings. The words \\"SKENE MEMORIAL LIBRARY\\" are on the entablature. Its overhang is also supported by narrow brackets. Three wide stone steps with iron railings climb up to it. Above the porch is an octagonal tower with round-arched windows in alternating facets above the roofline. Its top stage has louvered vents in all but the front facet, which is sheltered by a gabled hood with a small vergeboard. It is topped by a rounded roof with the same bracketed eaves. All windows are in pairs, with a diamond pattern in the upper pane. A similar pattern is in the transoms on the other two entrances, both on the north end of the rear. A modern wheelchair ramp goes up to these from the parking lot. Interior The double wood and glass doors at the main entrance lead into a small vestibule where stairs provide access to the tower and cellar. From there doors open into the main reading room, rectangular with an elliptical arched ceiling. The original plaster walls have been covered in modern paneling; the original hardwood floors remain. Oak and chestnut molding trims the cornice, doors and windows. Two piers separate the main reading room from a smaller one on the west. It was meant to be separated from the main room by partititions that could be pulled down from the piers, but these may not be operational. The west reading room's main feature is the large stone fireplace on the west wall, with a decorative stone arch in splayed stone and brick. It has a narrow wooden mantel with a shelf supported by brackets and a wooden overmantel with decorative carving. East of the main reading room is a stage area. It is recessed behind a partition and reached by three sets of stairs. Both it and the west reading room have molded window and door treatments similar to the main reading room. They can also be found in the small reading room in the north wing. The other room there, the village clerk's office, has been completely redone and has none of its original finishings. History In the late 19th century, the economy of the Catskills had shifted from forest- product industries to resorts, with the establishment of the state Forest Preserve and the completion of the Ulster and Delaware Railroad. The Fleischmanns area became the summer residence of a number of celebrities of the era, such as baking magnate Charles Louis Fleischmann, for whom it would later be renamed, conductor Anton Seidl, opera singer Amelita Galli-Curci, and Alexander Skene. alt=A black and white photograph of a bald man with a graying mustache and beard wearing a frock coat and tie looking to the right. It fades to almost white at the bottom, where it is signed \\"Alexander Skene\\" The latter, a Scottish emigrant, was a pioneering gynecologist who founded the American Gynecological Society and for whom Skene's gland is named. He and his wife, Belgian-born Annette Wilhelmine Lillian Van der Wegen, built Bonnie Em, a Scottish-style castle, as their summer home on the slopes of Belleayre Mountain in nearby Highmount. In the 1890s, Annette Skene had been trying to get the community to organize a public library, offering to start it with a donation of 500 books from her own library. In 1896, after two years of her entreaties, a library association was formed. Two residents donated the present site in 1901. Initially, funding for a library building came from subscription fees paid by Fleischmanns residents. Mrs. Skene also wrote to Andrew Carnegie, who was offering to finance what came to be called Carnegie libraries in English-speaking countries at the time, in gratitude for the role libraries had played in his life. He contributed $5,000 ($ in contemporary dollars) on the usual condition that the community building the library pledge a tenth of that amount annually for maintenance and support. Fleischmanns was able to raise double that amount, and began the collection with 875 books, including Mrs. Skene's original donation. The builder, Crosby Kelly, was another local resident and subscriber. The library was opened late in 1901, named in memory of Alexander Skene, who had died the previous year. At that time, Carnegie funded libraries without any review of the plans for the proposed building, and New York architects Henry and Marshall Emery, summer residents who had also been among the subscribers, had a free hand. Most of their work is in the Rockland County village of Nyack, where Henry Emery moved the practice after his brother's death in 1921, and Albany and New York City. The Skene library is not as high in style as the Emerys' other known work and seems to have been designed more to blend in with other local architecture. It combines the Queen Anne and Shingle styles, both popular for resorts and cottages in the 1890s. Features such as the overhanging roof, eaves and shingled siding also suggest the railroad stations in the area. Marshall Emery and Annette Skene married, and continued to support the library for several years, donating a heater in 1905. The year before, the association's minutes reflect a donation of $130 from the local Ladies Aid Society to hold a fair, which continued for many years. Performances were given on the stage, many using a grand piano that has since been lost. One local resident recalls seeing her first film, a Tom Mix western, at the library. In 1928 it was deeded to the village for use as a municipal building. It continues in both roles today. There have been no significant changes associated with this use other than the remodeling of one of the rear rooms to serve as the clerk's office.

It is a wooden building dating to the 1920s, built two years after local farmers founded the congregation. See also: Originally an Orthodox synagogue, it has since become Conservative. It is the only synagogue in the Catskills with an exposed truss roof. In 2002, the synagogue was added to the National Register of Historic Places, after a multi-year effort by Bernard Rosenberg, the descendant of a founding member. Congregation Bnai Israel Synagogue is the only synagogue in Delaware County to be listed. Building The synagogue occupies a lot on the north side of Wagner Avenue, a side street that runs along the south side of the village, between Ellsworth Avenue and Park Road, southwest of downtown Fleischmanns. The neighborhood is largely residential, with many old boardinghouses from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Behind the houses across the street the ground slopes up to the NY 28 state highway, rerouted there from the center of the village. To the west is the park created by Julius Fleischmann, son of Charles, after whom the village, originally called Griffin Corner, were renamed. Behind the synagogue, to its north, a small grove of trees surrounds the rear of the building, buffering it from the Bush Kill. As a consequence of being on the creek's flood plain, the synagogue's lot is flat and grassy, set off by ornamental hedges. Exterior The building itself is a one-and-a- half-story three-by-five-bay frame structure on a concrete block foundation. It is sided in clapboard and topped by a gabled roof with overhanging eaves supported by brackets. Along the south (front) and side elevations the bays are divided by flat pilasters with Doric capitals supporting an architrave with wide frieze. alt=The same white building from the photograph above, viewed looking directly at the front On the south facade the windows are in deep molded lancet arch frames. Below the sashes the eight panes are filled with colored glass; above them they have a Star of David design filled with yellow glass surrounded by blue. Larger versions of this design are in the circular windows at each gable end. Interior A set of concrete steps leads up to the main entrance, double wooden doors surrounded by an enframement in which pilasters on the side support a large pointed arch with iridescent glass panels. Inside, a narrow vestibule, with a kitchen on the side, leads to another set of double doors which open onto the community room. It has a pass-through window to the kitchen on a rear wall that replicates the sanctuary's original rear wall. Another set of double doors leads into the sanctuary, which occupies the rear third of the building. The tripartite ark is on the north wall, on a balustraded platform with round-arched carved wooden doors. On either side are projecting sections with panels. Corinthian columns support an entablature with a wide frieze and projecting cornice with modillions that extends across the center. Atop either side projection is a carved lion. The center section holds the Torah behind sliding wooden doors. It is topped with a round-arched panel with key molding depicting two wooden tablets carved with the Ten Commandments. The bimah is in front of the ark. It has four heavy posts, two with finial carvings on top and wide wooden moldings on its exterior walls. Pews with foliate moldings on their scrolled, curved handrails, surround it on three sides. The walls and ceiling are finished in wallboard with applied battens. A narrow strip old wooden molding makes a course around the interior at windowsill level. The ceiling has exposed wooden trusses. Above the vestibule, community room, and kitchen is a space that could have been a gallery, with a railing, yet is unfinished and too small to be used as such. It may have been purely decorative. History Jews began settling in the Catskills around the end of the 19th century. Many came to farm but soon found that the hotel business was as lucrative, if not more, with many of their urban co-religionists wanting a mountain vacation at resorts that welcomed them and accommodated their dietary obligations. In 1918, six of these farmers in the Fleischmanns area who had been meeting in each other's homes for informal religious study formally incorporated as Congregation Bnai Israel. A month afterwards, they bought the land for the synagogue they hoped to build for $1. The following year they held a ball to raise more money. A thousand guests attended; it would be remembered for long afterwards as one of the best such events in the region. It raised about $3,500 ($ in contemporary dollars) from affluent Jews in the area and construction was able to begin in 1920. Local builders Crosby and Kelly, who had also built the village's Skene Memorial Library two decades earlier, did the construction. It reflects a number of influences common to Catskill synagogues. Its overall plan and sanctuary layout, and the Stars of David in the windows, are in keeping with the Orthodox traditions of the founders. The gable roofs and combination of Gothic and classical detailing are features borrowed from the Protestant churches abundant in the region. Bnai Israel is unique in the Catskills in having an exposed truss ceiling, a feature suggesting Episcopalian influences. After 20 years, the sanctuary was partitioned to create the current community room, kitchen and vestibule. Finishings from the original rear wall were saved and reinstalled on the new rear wall of the community room. There have been no other significant modifications to the building.

Design and development The Breda company began design work on the Ba.82 high-speed medium bomber in 1937. It was a four-seat mid-wing twin-engine monoplane with retractable landing gear, powered by two 745-kilowatt (1,000-horsepower) Fiat A.80 RC 41 engines. It was armed with three 7.7-millimeter (0.303-inch) Breda- SAFAT machine guns. Breda constructed a single Ba.82 prototype, which it presented publicly for the first time at the Aeronautica di Milano (\\"Aviation Milan\\") air show in 1937. Even before its first flight, the Ba.82 ran into trouble with the Italian Air Ministry, which after examining its design decided that it was outdated. However, the Ministry considered placing a small production order with Breda provided that the Ba.82s performance and flight characteristics could be improved enough to allow it to complete official trials successfully. Head-on view of the prototype Another view of the prototype During company test flights, the prototype suffered from frequent engine problems, and the company was forced to make numerous alterations to it. The problems delayed official testing of the prototype until 1939. By that time, the Air Ministry had decided that a trimotor layout would be standard for Regia Aeronautica (Italian Royal Air Force) medium bombers, making the Ba.82 prototypes twin-engine design undesirable; moreover, by 1939 the prototype fell short of Regia Aeronautica requirements for maximum speed, range, and bombload. No production order for the Ba.82 materialized, and the single prototype was soon scrapped.

Life  Hall's grandfather was a stonemason working on churches and cathedrals and Hall was able to observe this work and the carving of stone was to influence his sculptures and drawings.Royal Academy Magazine 2008 He studied at the West of England College of Art, Bristol from 1960 to 1964 and at the Royal College of Art, London from 1964 to 1967. A Harkness Fellowship took him to United States, to Canada and Mexico from 1967 to 1969. Only later, back in London, he travelled to Japan, Korea and Switzerland. From 1971 to 1981 Hall was a lecturer and external examiner of the Royal College of Art, London and ran the MA sculpture course at Chelsea College of Art and Design. Hall lives and works in London. He was elected to the Royal Academy of Arts in 2003.  Works  Hall has always created single and multi-coloured drawings. Since the 1960s he has also worked on sculptures and spatial structures. The interplay of shadows and balance in the works mean that their placement, whether indoors or outside, is important. Hall finds the landscape of the Mojave Desert and Swiss Alps spaces of silence and vastness. This influences his drawings and he keeps a diary of sketches on his frequent travels. His drawings represent more than half of his total work. His location-based installation art is internationally known. A two-part wall relief in painted and gilded wood at the entrance of Providence Tower, Dallas (1989), a wall sculpture at the entrance to the Australian National Gallery, Canberra (1982), and his largest sculpture, a free-standing steel work at the entrance to the Thameslink tunnel, London, 1993.

The dance piece was named after the sculpture. The sculpture was inspired by Soda Lake which can be found in the Mojave desert. One part of the sculpture is a thin metal pole which stretched up at an angle and has a large elliptical loop attached at its apex. The second part is a thicker pole which is hung diametrically opposite the point at which the loop is attached to the thin pole, and is suspended so that it does not quite reach the ground. This is in two parts, the top section being marginally fatter than the lower. The upper end of the pole is slightly pointed whilst its lower end is bluntly rounded. The sculpture is made of fiberglass and aluminium and is painted gloss black. Hall used the concept of silence found at the landscape of Soda Lake and translated it into his sculpture through hanging one of the poles above the ground slightly.

He became Gresham Professor of Physic, and edited the third edition of Principia Mathematica. Life Born in London, he received a general education in England, then went to Leyden University in August 1714. There he studied medicine under Herman Boerhaave, and read mathematical authors. From Leyden he passed to Paris to study anatomy, and bought a collection of mathematical works at the sale of the library of the Abb√© Jean Gallois. He returned to London to attend St. Thomas's Hospital, but went back to Leyden in 1719 as the guest of Boerhaave, and graduated M.D. on 27 December of that year. On his settling in London, Pemberton did not practise much, because of delicate health. He was, however, a writer on medical and general subjects. He became a Fellow of the Royal Society, and contributed papers to its Philosophical Transactions (vols. xxxii.‚Äìlxii.). One of these, a demonstration of the inefficiency in an attempted proof by Giovanni Poleni, of Leibniz's assertion that the force of descending bodies is proportional to the square of their velocity, was transmitted to Isaac Newton by Richard Mead, and gained for Pemberton Newton's friendship. Newton brought him a refutation by himself based on other principles. This was afterwards printed as a postscript to Pemberton's paper. Pemberton saw much of Newton in his old age. On 24 May 1728 he was appointed Gresham professor of physic in succession to John Woodward. For seven years (1739‚Äì1746) he was chiefly employed in the preparation of the fifth London Pharmacop≈ìia for the Royal College of Physicians; he performed all the chemical and pharmaceutical experiments. The work was published in 1746 as Translation and Improvement of the London Dispensatory, and he received from the college a gift of the copyright and a hundred guineas above the expenses incurred. Pemberton died on 9 March 1771. Works Pemberton was employed by Newton to superintend the third edition of the ‚ÄòPrincipia.‚Äô The new edition, which appeared in 1726, had a preface by Newton, in which Pemberton is characterised as ‚Äòvir harum rerum peritissimus.‚Äô In 1728 he published ‚ÄòA View of Sir I. Newton's Philosophy.‚Äô It is dedicated to Robert Walpole, and is preceded by a preface containing the writer's recollections of the philosopher. A German translation of pt. i. of the ‚ÄòView,‚Äô by Salomon Maimon, appeared at Berlin in 1793. Pemberton's book was not remunerative, and was regarded as disappointing; George Lewis Scott, however, recommended it to Edward Gibbon. In 1724 Pemberton assisted Mead in editing William Cowper's Myotomia Reformata. His ‚ÄòScheme for a course of Chymistry to be performed at Gresham College‚Äô appeared in 1731. Two courses of his lectures were published by his friend James Wilson‚Äîthe first, in 1771, on chemistry; the second, in 1779, after Pemberton's death, on physiology. In addition to these and some treatises left in manuscript, Pemberton wrote: * ‚ÄòDissertatio Physico- Medicinalis Inaug. de Facultate Oculi ad diversas Rerum Computatarum Distantias se accommodante,‚Äô Leyden, 1719. * ‚ÄòEpist. ad Amicum [viz.

Built in 1558 as part of the Patcham Place estate, it was owned for many years by Anthony Stapley, one of the signatories of King Charles I's death warrant. It was extended and almost completely rebuilt in 1764, with traces of the older buildings remaining behind the Classical fa√ßade with its expanses of black glazed mathematical tiles‚Äîa feature typical of Brighton buildings of the era. Contemporary uses have included a youth hostel, but the house is currently used as a commercial premises. English Heritage has listed it at Grade II* for its architectural and historical importance. History The parish of Patcham, covering of chalk downland north of Brighton, has Saxon origins, and the remains of farmsteads and intermittent settlements can still be discerned. The territory includes several north‚Äìsouth valleys with intermittent streams (winterbournes). The River Wellesbourne, \\"Brighton's lost river\\", rises near the centre of the village and flows through the present city centre to the English Channel. It was culverted and built over in the late 18th century as Brighton began to develop as a fashionable resort. At the time of the Domesday survey in 1086, William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey‚Äîwho owned large areas of land in present-day Sussex‚Äîheld the manor of Patcham. The predecessor of the present All Saints Church existed, and there was a small village around it. These lay east of the old road to London. In the Middle Ages, another estate developed within the parish. A house, Patcham Place, was built in an isolated position west of the road in 1558 for its first owner, William West, 1st Baron De La Warr; but the estate soon passed to Richard Shelley, son of Sir John Shelley of Michelgrove and a member of the family which later became the first Shelley Baronetcy. Richard Shelley is believed to have lived in Patcham from 1546; he was an important figure in Brighton's early history, because in 1579 he and three other local noblemen were appointed by the Privy Council to form a commission to record and regulate the \\"ancient customs\\" of the villagers and to mediate between the fishermen and the farmers, who often had conflicting needs. The commissioners produced a book, The Book of All The Auncient [Ancient] Customs heretofore used amonge the fishermen of the Toune of Brighthelmston, whose orders were enshrined in law. Later in the 16th century, the estate passed to Richard Shelley's sons, one of whom sold it to Anthony Stapley in about 1620. The sale included Patcham Place, and Stapley made it his home for the next 35 years. During this time, he was the Governor of Chichester (the county town of West Sussex) for three years, became one of the 59 signatories of King Charles I's death warrant at his trial in 1649, and subsequently became a member of the English Council of State. Patcham Place stayed in the Stapley family until 1700, after which it passed through several owners (including George Nevill, 1st Earl of Abergavenny). During this time it was also used as the venue for local law enforcement, where the parish constable could take people suspected of crimes to be charged in the presence of a Justice of the Peace. Stanmer House in nearby Stanmer was also used for this purpose. In 1764, Major John Payne (or Paine) bought the house, and immediately set about extending and rebuilding it, eliminating all traces of the 16th-century structure. (The house has sometimes been incorrectly described as newly built in 1764, such was the extent of the revamp.) Payne and his descendants lived in the house for many years, but in 1926, as suburban residential development began to reach the old village of Patcham, Brighton Corporation (predecessor of the present Brighton and Hove City Council) bought the house and its grounds for ¬£6,000 (¬£ in ). Two years later, Patcham was one of several parishes to be absorbed into the Borough of Brighton. In 1937 or 1939, the Corporation leased Patcham Place to the Youth Hostels Association; it was used as the Brighton area's youth hostel from then until 2007, when the lease ran out. Brighton and Hove City Council owned it thereafter. In January 2012, the council announced they were selling the lease to a company which would turn the building into a business and community centre.It was subsequently sold off to Brighton-born businessmen Mark Ratcliffe, Chris Gargan and Peter McDonnell for ¬£1.3 million on 22 February 2013. Patcham Place was listed Grade II* on 13 October 1952. Such buildings are defined as being \\"particularly important ... [and] of more than special interest\\". In February 2001, it was one of 70 Grade II*-listed buildings and structures, and 1,218 listed buildings of all grades, in the city of Brighton and Hove. Following restoration, the property is now used as commercial premises and is the head office of KSD Support Services Limited, a building services and facilities management company. Architecture Patcham Place's present appearance is entirely 18th-century. Its style is Classical, suggested by features such as its three-bay pediment and Tuscan-columned entrance porch. The northwest and northeast walls are hung with the glazed black mathematical tiles which were a signature feature of residential buildings in Brighton between about 1760 and 1820. Elsewhere, stucco is used, except for some flint and brickwork at the rear. The roof is laid with slates and tiles. The entrance is on the northwest face, which has seven bays. The centre three are set forward slightly and are topped by a pediment with an inset oculus and a cornice with dentil elements. The panelled wood door is 18th-century, and sits below an arched fanlight. The windows on this face are sashes topped with stuccoed architraves. On the other walls, the windows are irregularly spaced; some original sashes survive, and there are also two canted bay windows. The interior has several large fireplaces and an ornate chimney-breast decorated with carved egg-and-dart motifs and flanked by pilasters. A plastered archway leads from the hall to the staircase, which has an elaborate stair-rail. Many of the internal doors and windows are topped with architraves.

However, the sentence was not carried out as it was commuted to a prison sentence. Wilson's maiden name was Mary Elizabeth Cassidy, she was born on 11 June 1889, in Catchgate, Stanley, County Durham, and christened on 30 June 1889 at Our Blessed Lady and St. Joseph, Brooms, Co. Durham. She married her first husband John Knowles around November 1914. They settled at a house in Windy Nook, Gateshead. Her lover John Russell eventually moved in with them. In 1955, Knowles died. She waited five months before marrying Russell. Her second husband died in 1956 (or early in 1957). The attending physician declared that both men had died of natural causes. Wilson inherited their money, ¬£42. In June 1957, Wilson married her third husband, Oliver Leonard, a retired estate agent. He died only 12 days into their marriage, leaving her ¬£50. She soon married a fourth husband, Ernest Wilson. His estate included up to ¬£100, a bungalow and life insurance. He died within the year. This time, she did not even bother to attend the funeral. By this time Wilson had become a main figure of local gossip, concerning both the frequency at which her spouses died and her rather cheerful attitude towards the pattern; she had joked at her latest wedding reception that left-over sandwiches would be fresh enough to use in the next funeral. She had also asked for a trade discount from the local undertaker, for providing him with plenty of business. These instances of morbid humour brought her to the attention of the police. An exhumation of the bodies of her last two husbands revealed high levels of phosphorus. Her defence claimed the substance was contained in their medication. Wilson was convicted of murdering two of her four husbands with beetle poison in 1956 and 1957. The remains of her earlier two husbands were exhumed at a later date and pointed to the same cause of death. There was no reason, however, to have a second trial. While Wilson was sentenced to death, her advanced age allowed her to get a reprieve. Her sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. She died while incarcerated at Holloway. * Her story was depicted in the season 11 premiere episode of Deadly Women, entitled \\"Mid Life Murder.\\"  References   External links  * Category:1889 births Category:1963 deaths Category:19th-century English people Category:20th-century English criminals Category:19th-century English women Category:20th-century English women Category:British female serial killers Category:English people convicted of murder Category:English prisoners sentenced to death Category:English serial killers Category:Mariticides Category:Murderers for life insurance money Category:People convicted of murder by England and Wales Category:People from Stanley, County Durham Category:People from Gateshead Category:People from Hebburn Category:Poisoners Category:Prisoners sentenced to death by England and Wales Category:Serial killers who died in prison custody Category:Violence against men in the United Kingdom Category:1956 crimes in the United Kingdom Category:1957 crimes in the United Kingdom Category:1955 crimes in the United Kingdom Category:1950s murders in the United Kingdom Category:1955 murders in Europe Category:1956 murders in Europe Category:1957 murders in Europe ","title":"Mary Elizabeth Wilson"},{"id":"26124772","text":"The Fort de Liouville, also known as Fort Stengel, located between the communes of Saint-Agnant-sous-les-C√¥tes and Saint-Julien-sous-les-C√¥tes, near the town of Commercy in the Meuse departement of France, is one of the forts built at the end of the 19th century to defend the valley of the Meuse. The fort was located on what was then the French frontier facing the German- occupied province of Lorraine. The Fort de Liouville was located between the Fort de Gironville and the Camp des Romains. History In 1870, France was partly occupied by the Prussian army. As a result of this defeat, the S√©r√© de Rivi√®res system of fortifications was planned and constructed to defend the nation. Construction started in 1876 on the roughly rectangular fort with a garrison of 691 troops. Work was completed in 1880, at a cost of 2,108,000 francs. The fort was updated between 1892 and 1910 with a protected magazine, replacement of caponiers with counterscarps, and preparations for a Mougin turret with two 155mm guns. The Mougin turret and guns were installed in 1914, along with two machine gun turrets, a 75mm gun turret and two observation cloches. The fort was armed with a total of 40 artillery pieces in 1914. It was the only fort in the Hauts de Meuse line to receive concrete cover, but did not get concrete-protected barracks. The fort dominates the Wo√´vre valley and blocks the Marbotte and L√©rouville gaps in the Hauts de Meuse, watching over the rail line to L√©rouville. Unusually, the gorge, or entry side of the fort faces German territory, since the fort is built on a west-facing escarpment. Fort de Liouville was bombarded by German artillery for a large portion of the war, with the heaviest fire between 22 September and 16 October 1914. The Mougin turret was hit by a 305mm German shell, but continued to fire with one gun until 28 September. The north ammunition magazine was penetrated by shellfire. The 75mm turret fired despite considerable trouble with the mechanism and numerous casualties until the fort was evacuated, and the turret was jammed by a direct 305mm hit. Infantry continued to hold the area, and the fort was not taken. The fort suffered significant damage to its casemates. It served as an observatory facing German lines and resting place for the regiments taken out of combat. In 1938 a machine gun turret was removed and mounted at the Bastion de la Riene at the Citadel of Verdun. The fort displays an unusual degree of attention to design, with window frames resembling Gothic tracery. The fort is maintained by an association for its preservation. Batterie de Saint-Agnant A triangular position built 1878-1880 as an annex to Liouville, with three 120mm guns prior to 1910. The position also had two Pamart casemate/cupolas for machine guns. It was severely bombarded during the first world war and is now abandoned.

He also served in the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) during World War II, and assisted Justice Robert H. Jackson as an interrogator in connection with the prosecution of Nazi war criminals at the Nuremberg Trials. Early life Hahn was born in Colorado in 1915 to William L. and Masie Hahn. William Hahn was the Maytag Corporation representative in Denver.

Gahagan Douglas was elected to the United States House of Representatives from California's 14th congressional district as a liberal Democrat in 1944, and served three full terms.

Hahn also worked with Cecil B. DeMille on several films, including This Day and Age (1933), where he played the part of the student body president (at the time, Hahn was senior class president at Los Angeles High School). In his book Cecil B. DeMille's Hollywood, author Robert S. Birchard relates how DeMille wasn't sure screenwriter Bartlett Cormack's script had a sense of current slang, so he asked high school student Hahn to read the script and comment. Today we often laugh at the \\"Gee, that's swell\\" dialogue of early 1930s films but, according to Hahn at least, this was the way he and his fellow students talked. He wrote DeMille that the majority of the dialogue in Cormack's script was \\"really not typical of high school students. [It] Should be interspersed with a few exclamations like, 'heck' ‚Äî 'gosh' ‚Äî 'gee,' etc\\" Hahn also suggested that in Steve's speech about the murdered tailor the writer add: \\"Gosh, he was swell to us fellows.\\" Birchard, Robert S.

Marshall, the Army's chief of staff, to form units of bilingual volunteers that would organize and supply guerrilla bands, gather intelligence, and carry out commando operations behind enemy lines. These men formed cells, each containing two sections of two officers and thirteen enlisted men, although the actual size of the teams in the field would vary greatly. Primarily infantrymen and demolitions experts, they also contained medical technicians and radio operators.Aaron Bank, From OSS to Green Berets: The Birth of Special Forces (Novato, Calif.: Presidio Press, 1986), pp. 1-6 Hahn parachuted behind enemy lines into Czechoslovakia, and later received an award from the Czechoslovakian Government in exile for his services in capturing a Nazi gauleiter in that country.Stanford Lawyer Summer 2003, obituary page 87 Nuremberg War Trials One source identifies Hahn as the chief attorney for Justice Robert H.

Jackson had several assistants at the Nuremberg Trials, including Colonel Telford Taylor, who was the U.S. prosecutor in the High Command case. The indictment in this case called for the General Staff of the Army and the High Command of the German Armed Forces to be considered criminal organizations; the witnesses were several of the surviving German Field Marshals and their staff officers.Guilt, responsibility and the Third Reich, Heffer 1970; 20 pages; Captain Hahn conducted interrogations, including that of Colonel of the Luftwaffe Bernd von Brauchitsch, who served on the staff of Reich Marshal Hermann G√∂ring.

This incident was portrayed in the film The Great Escape (1963), an American film starring Steve McQueen about an escape by Allied prisoners of war from a German POW camp during World War II. The film was based on the book The Great Escape by Paul Brickhill, which is a novelization of the true story of a mass escape from Stalag Luft III. When Justice Jackson resigned his position as prosecutor after the first (and only) trial before the IMT and returned to the U.S., Colonel Telford Taylor was promoted to Brigadier General and succeeded him on October 17, 1946, as Chief Counsel for the remaining twelve trials before the U.S. Nuremberg Military Tribunals. In these trials at Nuremberg, 163 of the 200 defendants who were tried were found guilty in some or all of the charges of the indictments. It is not known if Captain Hahn assisted Taylor during these trials. When World War II came to an end the Allies competed for access to top Nazis.

In addition, the section between Old Carroll Avenue and MD 320 is closed to automobile traffic on Sundays.  Route description  Sligo Creek Parkway begins at MD 650 (New Hampshire Avenue) in Takoma Park. The parkway heads west as a two-lane road with a speed limit of , paralleling Sligo Creek and the Sligo Creek Trail to the south. At a southward bend of Sligo Creek, Flower Avenue continues straight while Sligo Creek Parkway turns south. After returning to a westward heading, the parkway intersects Old Carroll Avenue, which is used to access MD 195 (Carroll Avenue), which passes above the parkway on the Carroll Avenue Bridge. Old Carroll Avenue is also the southern limit of road closure on Sundays. When Sligo Creek Parkway reaches Maple Avenue, the parkway becomes concurrent with Maple Avenue and crosses Sligo Creek and the Sligo Creek Trail at grade. From this point, the creek and trail remain south of the parkway. At the next intersection, Maple Avenue continues north, an entrance to Washington Adventist Hospital is on the east, and Sligo Creek Parkway heads west. Sligo Creek Parkway continues northwest through Takoma Park on a stretch featuring many blind curves. After the curvy section, the parkway temporarily turns west and intersects MD 320 (Piney Branch Road), which is the northern limit of road closure on Sundays. Throughout this road closure section, residents local to Sligo Creek Parkway are granted vehicular access. Sligo Creek Parkway resumes its northwest course through Silver Spring and meets MD 594 (Wayne Avenue). Beyond Wayne Avenue, the parkway comes to a three-way stop at Schuyler Road and speed humps start crossing the road at regular intervals.

Early years He was born on the family farm near Chesham, in what is now the Pottersville section of Dublin, New Hampshire on March 6, 1848 to mother Mary Phelps and father Jayson Phelps.\\"Animal and Sporting Artist in America\\" by F. Turner Reuter, Jr. 2008 \\"Preston\\", as he was known, grew up helping out on the very active family farm, where his father in his spare time, liked to paint, build furniture and musical instruments. Preston drew constantly, when he wasn't tending the animals or mowing the fields. His father recognized the financial benefits of talents, as he too painted houses as extra income, and sent William on to the thriving mill city of Lowell, Massachusetts to work for the sign painter Jeduthan Kittredge at the age of 14. While engaged as a sign painter in Lowell, Phelps created paintings on canvas on the side. All the while, he fell in love with the boss's daughter, Anna Marie. At the age of 20, in 1868 he married Anna, and a year later he opened his own sign painting company on the same street as his father-in-law's business. On August 21, 1871 in Lowell, the young couple had a daughter named Ina Kittredge Phelps. A son, Edward, was born three years later. Phelps' talents began to shift away from signage, as people were so impressed by the intricacies and beauty of his work, patrons started to hire him for canvas paintings. To focus his talent, he began to take the train into Boston for evening art classes, then he would paint landscape scenes that he sold out of the window of his shop. After a few years, at the age of 27, he had his first exhibition of his works, in Lowell, where a group of patrons were so impressed, they funded Phelps to study abroad in Munich. Travelling years Leaving his wife Anna and their two children behind, the 28-year-old set sail in 1875 for the Royal Academy of Art in Munich to study painting for two years before heading back to the States. He returned home only to settle his estate, then set sail, this time with his entire family, which would be some of the happiest days of his life. Now, with his family around him, he studied the art of \\"plein air\\" painting under Munich's Veltron. Here he travelled up and down the Rhine and D√ºssel rivers, setting up elaborate tents to paint outside, all the while sending paintings back to the States for exhibition at the National Academy of Design where they sold two paintings for him. He lived in Munich for another three years, where he studied with other Lowellians, including James McNeill Whistler and David Dalhoff Neal, and was also co-founder of the Munich Art Club with other members such as Walter Shirlaw, David Dalhoff Neal, Frank Duveneck, and William Merritt Chase. Next he headed for Paris where he stayed for two more years. From their new residence in Paris, they travelled to England, Scotland, and Wales. After five years of traveling through Europe, the family headed for home, sailing from Glasgow to New York, then by coach to Lowell, where they received a hero's welcome. After settling his family, Phelps once again headed for Europe in 1881 for a whirlwind trip, this time to the Scottish Highlands, then with his friend William Merritt Chase on a working tour of Italy, Venice, and Capri, then back to Germany before returning to Lowell via New York. After a devastating sail back across the Atlantic, that took the lives of three crewmen and broke the main mast in a hurricane, William again set up his studio shop in Lowell. Now back on dry land, and with his shop in Lowell, William began travel up and down the New England coast, painting landscapes in the summers, while also painting portraits of prize cattle and bulls in the off season for the next five years. Then, in 1886, he headed west. Here he painted the Grand Canyon on a huge 7' x 12' canvas which required him to erect a shelter around him as he painted outside or \\"plein aire\\".http://www.askart.com/askart/p/william_preston_phelps/william_preston_phelps.aspx With the death of his father in 1888, William and Anna moved the family to the old family farm at the foot of Mount Monadnock in New Hampshire, just after Anna finished out high school in the summer of 1890. Later years After spending a majority of his 30s traveling and painting around Europe and the U.S., Phelps finally settled down in 1890 when he re-acquired his old family farm near Chesham, New Hampshire. He remained in the area painting many exterior New England landscapes. Here is when he perfected the \\"plain air\\" style. Even in winter, Phelps continued to paint outdoors by building an elaborate shelter studio, that could be transported by a horse-drawn sled, and had its own oil burning stove for heat. His daughter Ina Kittredge Phelps became an artist in her own right, who married Robert Peter Hayward on March 21, 1893. Ina and Robert settled down the road in Keene, where they raised their five children, including the famous inventor, architect, and artist Roger Hayward. In 1901, tragedy struck, when his son Edward, now 27, an artist and lecturer himself, was traveling in Waco, Texas, and rescued a child from the tracks of an oncoming train. He saved the child, but was struck dead by the train. Phelps' wife Anna died just six months later. Phelps began to drink heavily, and in 1906 he remarried but divorced in 1909. By his late 60s, William started to fade with the sadness of his wife Anna and son Edward passing away, and his finances weakened. In 1914, he began to borrow money from a Lowell financing firm, and quickly got into debt. After Phelps pulled a gun on his friend and neighbor in the winter of 1917, the authorities were notified. The police came and escorted the aging artist away, and was labeled an \\"invalid\\" by the asylum in Concord, New Hampshire. On August 2, 1917 all his possessions were auctioned off, all around the same time his grandson Roger was graduating from Keene High School and heading off to MIT. On January 6, 1923, at the age of 75, William died in the same community he was born. He was laid to rest in Edson Cemetery in Lowell, Massachusetts. Today, many of Phelps' papers, work orders, and art are archived at the Smithsonian.

Though often associated with grandeur, the sublime may also refer to the grotesque or other extraordinary experiences that \\"take[s] us beyond ourselves.‚Äù The literary concept of the sublime became important in the eighteenth century. It is associated with the 1757 treatise by Edmund Burke, though it has earlier roots. The idea of the sublime was taken up by Immanuel Kant and the Romantic poets including especially William Wordsworth. Longinus The earliest text on the sublime was written sometime in the first or third century AD by the Greek writer (pseudo-) Longinus in his work On the Sublime (, Per√¨ h√Ωpsous). Longinus defines the literary sublime as \\"excellence in language\\", the \\"expression of a great spirit\\" and the power to provoke \\"ecstasy\\" in one's readers. Longinus holds that the goal of a writer should be to produce a form of ecstasy. He in other words elucidates sublime: \\"Sublimity refers to a certain type of elevated language that strikes its listener with the mighty and irresistible power of a thunderbolt. A sublime passage can be heard again and again with equal pleasure.\\" However, Longinus goes beyond this to define the ideal kind of audience. # The best audience for the sublime is a refined, cultivated one. # Only such an audience is able to judge the relative sublimity of a work. # This attitude (central to neoclassicism) is somewhat aristocratic and elitist, because the audience Longinus desires must be free from the low and vulgar thoughts that generally accompany rustic toil. # This attitude will not be seriously challenged until the Romantic Age. Nicolas Boileau-Despr√©aux introduced the sublime into modern critical discourse in the Preface to his translation of Longinus: Traite du Sublime de Longin (1674). John Baillie The little-known writer John Baillie wrote An Essay on the Sublime in 1747. Burke Most scholars point to Edmund Burke's A Philosophical Inquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful (1757) as the landmark treatise on the sublime. Burke defines the sublime as \\"whatever is fitted in any sort to excite the ideas of pain and danger... Whatever is in any sort terrible, or is conversant about terrible objects, or operates in a manner analogous to terror.\\" Burke believed that the sublime was something that could provoke terror in the audience, for terror and pain were the strongest of emotions. However, he also believed there was an inherent \\"pleasure\\" in this emotion. Anything that is great, infinite or obscure could be an object of terror and the sublime, for there was an element of the unknown about them. Burke finds more than a few instances of terror and the sublime in John Milton's Paradise Lost, in which the figures of Death and Satan are considered sublime.Burke, Edmund. A Philosophical Inquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful. trans. Abraham Mills. New York: Harper & Brothers Publishers, 1856, p. 51. Kant Immanuel Kant in his The Critique of Judgment (1790) further clarifies Burke's definition of the sublime, mostly in contrast to the beautiful. He says that the beautiful in nature is not quantifiable, but rather focused only in color, form, surface, etc. of an object. Therefore, the beautiful is to be \\"regarded as a presentation of an indeterminate concept of understanding.\\" However, to Kant, the sublime is more infinite and can be found even in an object that has no form. The sublime should be regarded as a \\"presentation of an indeterminate concept of reason\\". Basically, Kant argues that beauty is a temporary response of understanding, but the sublime goes beyond the aesthetics into a realm of reason. While Burke argues that the sublime arises from an object that incites terror, Kant says that an object can be terrifying and thus sublime, without the beholder actually being afraid of it. However, there is much more to Kant's definition of the sublime. He argues that the sublime in itself is so great that anything compared to it must necessarily be considered small. And, because of that, an important aspect of the sublime is the work of one's imagination to comprehend something so great that it seems inconceivable; thus, one major aspect of the sublime is the power of mankind's mind to recognize it. Kant transforms the sublime from a terrifying object of nature to something intricately connected to the rational mind, and hence to morality.Kant, Immanuel. The Critique of Judgment. trans. James Creed Meredith. Forgotten Books, 2008, p. 68-75. The literary sublime, as well as the philosophical, aesthetic sublimes, is inherently connected to nature but, as with most literary terms, the sublime evolved alongside literature. More authors began to connect the natural sublime to an internalized emotion of terror. Authors began to see the sublime, with its inherent contradictions (pain and pleasure, terror and awe) as representative of the changing political and cultural climate of the times. They began to incorporate more aspects of the sublime into their literary works as a way of externalizing their inner conflicts. In this way, the sublime particularly appealed to the Romantics.  In English romantic poetry  The fascination with the sublime in Romanticism first began in landscaping; however, Romantic poets soon began experimenting on it as well. But the innovations made to the sublime in landscaping also translated into the poetry of the time. Thus, what Christian Hirschfeld wrote in his Theorie der Gartenkunst (trans. Theory of Gardening 1779‚Äì1780) can be applied to the literary world as well. On the sublime, Hirschfeld argues that man sees his own potential in the grandeur of nature and in the boundless landscapes therein. He also believed that this applied to both man's freedom and lack thereof, and moving from restriction to freedom results in an inner elevation. In this way, the sublime becomes internalized, and \\"physical grandeur [becomes] transformed into spiritual grandeur\\". Hirschfeld further believed that the sublime of the nature then becomes a symbol of inner human realities.Mortensen, Klaus P. The Time of Unrememberable Being: Wordsworth and The Sublime, 1787-1805. Denmark: Museum Tusculanum Press, 1998, p. 36. So the English Romantics began to view the sublime as referring to a \\"realm of experience beyond the measurable\\" that is beyond rational thought, that arises chiefly from the terrors and awe-inspiring natural phenomena.Greenblatt, Stephen, Ed. The Norton Anthology of English Poetry. New York: W.W. Norton & Company, 2006. Others agreed with Kant's definition of the sublime: that it had everything to do with mankind's rational thought and perceptions. But all Romantics agreed that the sublime was something to be studied and contemplated. And in doing so, the Romantics internalized their thoughts of the sublime and attempted to understand it. Although the moment may have been fleeting, the Romantics believed one could find enlightenment in the sublime. Each of the Romantics had a slightly different interpretation on the sublime.  William Wordsworth  William Wordsworth is the Romantic best known for working with the sublime. Many scholars actually place Wordsworth's idea of the sublime as the standard of the romantic sublime. In his essay on the sublime, Wordsworth says that the \\"mind [tries] to grasp at something towards which it can make approaches but which it is incapable of attaining\\".Brennan, Matthew. Wordsworth, Turner and Romantic Landscape. Camden House, 1987, p.52. In trying to \\"grasp\\" at this sublime idea, the mind loses consciousness, and the spirit is able to grasp the sublime‚Äîbut it is only temporary. Wordsworth expresses the emotion that this elicits in his poem Lines Composed a Few Miles above Tintern Abbey: Here Wordsworth expresses that in the mood of the sublime, the burden of the world is lifted. In a lot of these cases, Wordsworth finds the sublime in Nature. He finds the awe in the beautiful forms of nature, but he also finds terror. Wordsworth experiences both aspects of the sublime. However, he does go beyond Burke or Kant's definition of the literary sublime, for his ultimate goal is to find Enlightenment within the sublime.  Samuel Taylor Coleridge  Samuel Taylor Coleridge was a poet, critic and scholar, and he was very concerned with the sublime, especially in contrast to the beautiful. Coleridge argues his view best when he says that: Therefore, the speaker must contemplate more than just the object itself; it is sublime in its greater context. Now, Coleridge's views on the sublime are unique because Coleridge believed that Nature was only occasionally sublime, that is, only in the sky, the sea and the desert, because those are the only objects in nature that are boundless. For this reason, Coleridge's \\"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\" is often considered sublime, though it is one of the few works in which Coleridge expresses the natural world as being sublime. In most of Coleridge's other works, he focuses on the \\"metaphysical sublime,\\" which is found in the 'in between's of the world (earth and sea, sky and sea, etc.). But Coleridge didn't demand the sensation of terror or awe within the sight, rather, he focused on the element of infinity.  Later aspects  The so-called \\"second generation\\" Romantics employed the sublime as well, but as the early Romantics had different interpretations of the literary sublime, so too did Percy Bysshe Shelley, Lord Byron, and John Keats. In many instances, they reflected the desire for Enlightenment that their predecessor showed, but they also tended to stick closer to the definition of the sublime given by Longinus and Kant. They tended to focus on the terror in the sublime, and the ecstasy found there.  Lasting effects  The literary sublime found in Romantic poetry left a lasting impression on writers for generations. The Victorians may not have used the term sublime, but a similar emotional state can be found within their writings. The Irish poet William Butler Yeats referred to a similar concept of \\"tragic joy\\".Ramazani, Jahan R. \\"Yeats: Tragic Joy and the Sublime.\\" Modern Language Association. 104.2 (1989): 163-164 Sigmund Freud took the literary sublime and examined the psyche behind it, resulting in what he termed \\"sublimation\\".http://www.geneseo.edu/~easton/humanities/Freud.htm Freud Terms Other authors that used the sublime after the Romantic period included Charles Dickens, William Butler Yeats, among many others. The sublime has also been described as a key to understanding the sense of wonder concept in science fiction literature.Robu, Cornel \\"A Key to Science Fiction: the Sublime\\". Foundation 42 (Spring 1988), p. 21‚Äì37. In early modernist discourse, the urban landscape became an important subject of the sublime. The rise of skyscrapers and large cities became a center of focus of writers, and, although they did focus on some natural aspects, the definition of the sublime took a slight turn. Christophe Den Tandt says that \\"the moment of sublime terror is always to some extent a social construct\\".Den Tandt, Christophe. The Urban Sublime in American Literary Naturalism University of Illinois Press, 1998, p. 4‚Äì8 Den Tandt focuses on the politics of the sublime and the issue of legitimacy, discussing if the urban landscape is a form of reality because the city cannot be viewed as a single natural design. Rather, the man made aspects of it make an object of uncertainty and thus, terror and the sublime. In addition, the feminist movement used their own definition of the sublime in literature. Barbara Claire Freeman believes that the so-called \\"feminine\\" sublime does not attempt to dominate and master the feeling of terror that the \\"masculine\\" or \\"dominating\\" sublime. Instead, they accept the feeling of rapture and attempt to delve into its \\"metaphysical\\" secrets and aspects. Freeman believes that the domestication of the sublime, which is typically associated with femininity, is not the only aspect (and often is not even found) in women's literature.Freeman, Barbara Claire.

It was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 2006 and is preserved at the Fort Smith Trolley Museum. History The Maumelle Ordnance Works were built by the War Department in 1941 to produce the explosives picric acid, ammonium picrate, and ammonium nitrate. The plant began production in 1942 and the locomotive was purchased to move freight cars around the facility, which was spread over to minimize the risk of incidents spreading from one production unit to others. The plant stopped production in August 1945 and was decontaminated and shut down by November. The land passed through several hands and eventually became the planned community of Maumelle, Arkansas. The Arkansas nomination document says that locomotive #1 was then transferred to the Army, renumbered 8223, and sent to the Newport Army Air Field. The airfield, however, had been renamed \\"Marine Corps Air Facility Newport\\" in 1944 and turned over to the City of Newport at the end of the war. Wherever it spent the period after the war, in the early 1950s the government sold the locomotive to the Augusta Railroad, a line that connected Augusta, Arkansas, near Broadway and 1st Street, to the Missouri Pacific at 6th Street in New Augusta. Parts of the railroad right of way are still obvious on the Google aerial view. The little gasoline locomotive replaced a 1924 Alco 2-6-0 steam locomotive that had been condemned. During the 1950s, the railroad gradually died, as its traffic shifted to trucks. The railroad went through an abandonment proceeding in 1958 and was purchased by Glenn Taggart and Bing Miller. Subsequently, Tommy Taggart bought Miller's interest. He kept the locomotive until he donated it to the Fort Smith Trolley Museum in June 1988. Design The locomotive's controls Locomotive #1 is an unusual combination. Virtually all internal combustion locomotives are diesel- electrics, powered by a diesel prime mover driving a generator which in turn drives one or more electric traction motors; apart from some diesel-mechanical and diesel-hydraulic locomotives. All of the major manufacturers had discarded the use of gasoline engines by the middle 1930s in favor of diesel, primarily on the grounds of fuel economy. Vulcan continued to produce a very limited number of both while it also continued to produce steam locomotives. In early 1942 it is likely that war needs made it easier to get a gasoline engine than a diesel because a gasoline engine uses much less material. Electric drive is almost universal because a railroad locomotive is a difficult environment for a mechanical gearbox, as the loads vary widely from second to second as the slack action runs in and out. Only on very small locomotives, pulling a limited number of cars, generally on level track, have there been any successful gearbox locomotive drives. In the case of Locomotive 1, the four- speed gearbox drives a jackshaft under the cab which is connected with side rods to the two driving wheels. The choice of mechanical drive may also have been driven by war availability ‚Äì a generator and traction motor take hundreds of pounds of copper, which was scarce. The nomination document quotes a Vulcan ad in the 1947 Locomotive Cyclopedia, \\"\\"All Vulcan diesel and gasoline geared locomotives are equipped with a distinctive four-speed, constant-mesh, spur- geared transmission which permits easy gear changes at relatively high speeds. Gears and shafts are heat-treated nickel-chromium steel mounted on anti- friction bearings and operating in an oil bath. Extra-heavy cross-equalized semi-elliptic springs and Vulcan 3-point suspension assure easy riding on rough track and minimize derailments.\\" It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2006.

Inliers are typically formed by the erosion of overlying younger rocks to reveal a limited exposure of the older underlying rocks. Faulting or folding may also contribute to the observed outcrop pattern. A classic example from Great Britain is that of the inlier of folded Ordovician and Silurian rocks at Horton in Ribblesdale in North Yorkshire which are surrounded by the younger flat-lying Carboniferous Limestone. The location has long been visited by geology students and experts. Another example from South Wales is the Usk Inlier in Monmouthshire where Silurian age rocks are upfolded amidst Old Red Sandstone rocks of Devonian age. A similar outcrop pattern which results from movement on a thrust fault followed by erosion may be termed a window. Conversely an outlier is an area of younger rock completely surrounded by older rocks. An outlier is typically formed when sufficient erosion of surrounding rocks has taken place to sever the younger rock's original continuity with a larger mass of the same younger rocks nearby. One example from Great Britain is the mass of Triassic sandstone around the Staffordshire town of Leek. This is isolated from the very much larger area of Triassic rocks which characterise the English Midlands and Cheshire Basin, to the south and west respectively, by the surrounding Carboniferous sandstones and mudstones. Similarly in the Black Mountains of South Wales, the summit area of Pen Cerrig-calch is composed from a suite of Carboniferous age sandstones and limestone. This outcrop is isolated from the main extent of these rocks (which form the South Wales Coalfield and its margins some miles to the south) by the Devonian Old Red Sandstone on which it rests by and by which it is surrounded.British Geological Survey, 2007 Bedrock Geology UK South 5th Edn, 1:625K scale map, Keyworth Grenvillian inliers located within the Appalachian orogeny include the Pine Mountain Belt in Georgia, the French Broad Massif along the Tennessee and North Carolina border, Sauratown Mountain Massif in North Carolina, the Shenandoah Massif in Virginia, the Baltimore Gneiss Domes in Maryland, the Honey Brook Upland in Pennsylvania, and the Reading Prong, which extends from Pennsylvania into New York. Other inliers include the Berkshire Massif, which extends from Massachusetts into Vermont, and the Green Mountain Massif in Vermont. Associated Canadian inliers include the Blair River Inlier on Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, the Steel Mountain Terrane on Newfoundland, and the Long Range Inlier on Newfoundland. In West Africa, the Kenieba inlier borders southwestern Mali and eastern Senegal, and associated Birimian gold is found in Kalana and Sabodala respectively.

Earle L. Reynolds (October 18, 1910 ‚Äì January 11, 1998) was an anthropologist, educator, author, Quaker, and peace activist. He was sent to Hiroshima by the Atomic Energy Commission in 1951 to study the effects of the first atomic bomb on the growth and development of exposed children. His professional discoveries concerning the dangers of radiation later moved Reynolds into a life of anti-nuclear activism. In 1958 he sailed with his wife Barbara, two of his three children and a Japanese yachtsman in the Phoenix of Hiroshima, a ketch he had designed himself, into the American nuclear testing zone in the Pacific. In 1961 the family sailed to the USSR to protest Soviet nuclear testing. During the Vietnam War Reynolds and his second wife Akie sailed the Phoenix to Haiphong to deliver humanitarian and medical aid to victims of American bombing. Early life Reynolds, an only child, was born Earl Frederick Schoene to William and Maude Schoene as the circus of which they were a part passed through Des Moines, Iowa. Earle's father and uncle Frederick performed as The Landry Brothers, trapeze artists and tightrope walkers for the John T. Wortham ShowsBillboard, Feb. 21, 1925, p.104, mentions William Schoene and a Mrs. William Schoene in connection with the John T. Wortham Shows wintering in Paris, Texas; on April 18, 1925, p. 98 mentions William Schoene as the Manager of the Trained Animal Show and on Nov. 28, 1925 mentions that the show was quartered in San Angelo, Texas and William Schoene was breaking in new acts. (also known as John T. Wortham Carnival). Billboard noted, \\"The Landry Brothers work a neat and classy rope acrobatic turn for six minutes, in full stage, which brought the brawny lads one legit.\\".Sept. 26, 1914, p. 15 Before World War I made German names unpopular, according to Reynolds, the pair were billed as Schoene Brothers Aerial Artists. Depending on the season and the family's financial status, their circus acts alternated with vaudeville. Earl took his stepfather's surname, added an \\"e\\" to his first name, earned the rank of Eagle Scout and graduated from Vicksburg High School in 1927. He went on to earn his BA and MA from the University of Chicago and his Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin, all in Anthropology. He married Barbara Leonard in 1936 and they had three children: Tim (1936), Ted (1938), and Jessica (1944). From 1943 to 1951 Reynolds was Associate Professor of Anthropology at Antioch College and Chairman of the Physical Growth Department at the Fels Research Institute for the Study of Human Development, also at Antioch College.Reynolds, Earle L. Anthropology and Human Growth. The Ohio Journal of Science. May, 1949. p 89 footnote Career In 1951 Earle joined the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission (ABCC),http://www7.nationalacademies.org/.../ABCC_1945-1982.html established under the direction of the National Research Council's Division of Medical Sciences in March 1947. He was sent to Hiroshima to research the effects of radiation from the first atomic bomb on the growth of Japanese children. From 1951 until 1954 Earle completed the first of a series of longitudinal studies meant to be resumed after a one-year sabbatical. He wrote up his findings as \\"Report on a Three-Year Study, 1951-2-3, of the Growth and Development of Hiroshima Children Exposed to the Atomic Bomb, 1954.\\" In summary he had found children exposed to radiation to be smaller than their counterparts with lowered resistance to disease and a greater susceptibility to cancer, especially leukemia. Because strontium-90 (produced by the atomic bomb) seeks the same areas of the bodies of growing children as calcium, such as the thyroid gland, children exposed to the bomb were also subject to thyroid cancer. The Phoenix of Hiroshima (foreground) in Hong Kong Harbor, en route to North Vietnam, 1967. While in Japan, Reynolds designed and had built a yacht of , the Phoenix of Hiroshima. From 1954-58 he, his wife Barbara, son Ted (16), daughter Jessica (10), and three young Japanese men from Hiroshima, Niichi (\\"Nick\\") Mikami, Motosada (\\"Moto\\") Fushima and Mitsugi (\\"Mickey\\") Suemitsu, sailed around the world. The building of the boat took 18 months, one year longer than had been previously expected. The first leg of the voyage, from Japan to Hawaii, took 48 days.Reynolds, Earle. \\"We Crossed the Pacific the Hard Way,\\" Saturday Evening Post, May 7, 14 and 21, 1955. In Honolulu for the second time, what had been a pleasure cruise took a serious turn. Across the dock from the Phoenix was a ketch of , the Golden Rule.The Voyage of the Golden Rule: An Experiment with Truth: Albert Bigelow: Books.Albert Bigelow papers www.swarthmore.edu/Library/peace/DG051.../DG076ABigelow.htm Its crew, four Quaker pacifists, Albert Bigelow, George Willoughby, Bill Huntington and Orion Sherwood were attempting to sail to the Marshall Islands to protest the United States' testing of 35 nuclear devices there. An injunction against American citizens entering the test zone was passed after the Golden Rule left port and it was brought back by the Coast Guard. Impressed by the reasoning and character of these men, Earle and Barbara joined the Society of Friends (Quakers) and considered taking over their protest in the Phoenix. Reynolds was at that time one of the world's experts on the effects of radiation. In determining whether to deliberately enter the test zone, he considered a number of factors, such as the effects the radiation from the series of nuclear tests would have on the world environment, specifically increasing incidents of cancer, and the effects of this additional radiation on the Hiroshima and Nagasaki population, since both wind and ocean currents from the test site would carry radiation that direction. He considered unconstitutional the United States government's injunction declaring of ocean off-limits to American personnel during the series. Also, the forbidden zone blanketed any route by which the Reynolds family could conveniently sail back to Japan, as they had hoped to do as soon as possible to complete the circumnavigation. In addition, as the Marshall Islands were a Trust Territory of the U.S., Reynolds objected to the forced removal of Marshallese from their home islands for the purpose of detonating weapons which would almost certainly render their islands uninhabitable for years to come. Activism Earle, Barbara, Ted (20), Jessica (14) and Mikami cleared \\"for the high seas\\" on June 11, 1958.Friends Journal, Friends Journal 1958 coverage of the Golden Rule (published July 31, 2013) The family had not decided whether or not to enter the forbidden zone but Mikami, whose mother and brother had been in the bombing, never wrestled with the question. For days after the nuclear weapon was dropped, his mother had crawled through the radioactive rubble, searching for her brother-in-law. She never found his body. By July 1, at the edge of the invisible perimeter of the zone, everyone came to a consensus. Earle announced by radiotelephone, on the international frequency for ships at sea, \\"The United States yacht Phoenix is sailing today into the nuclear test zone as a protest against nuclear testing...\\" The next morning, inside the forbidden zone, the Phoenix was intercepted and stopped by the American Coast Guard cutter Planetree.Years later, in private correspondence, Capt. Bigelow wrote Earle that most people had never heard of the Phoenix and thought the Golden Rule had sailed into the area. Earle wrote back, \\"...Phoenix, in its trip, was the Golden Rule. I would be entirely happy if the entire world should think it was the Golden Rule which achieved its purpose, because it did!\\" Two armed Coast Guard officers jumped aboard and put Reynolds under arrest. He was flown back to Honolulu for trial. A jury convicted him of entering a forbidden area.Cousins, Norman. \\"Earle Reynolds and His Phoenix.\\" Saturday Review. (date) The sentence was overturned on appeal. Within 19 months Earle and his family were involved in another protest voyage. With the Pacific Ocean again open to American citizens, they sailed without incident back to Hiroshima.Earle Reynolds, The Forbidden Voyage, p. 258 In October, 1961, the USSR resumed its own nuclear testing. The Reynolds family plus Tom YonedaElaine Black Yoneda Collection sailed to Nakhodka in protest (The nearest military port, Vladivostok, was inaccessible in winter).Reynolds, Jessica. To Russia with Love. 2010?. Published in Japanese translation by Chas. E. Tuttle Co, Tokyo 1962 Everyman III in Kiel 1962 In 1962, Reynolds was invited to captain the Everyman III, on which members of A Quaker Action Group (AQAG) sailed from London to Leningrad via Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, and Sweden. This boat of , too, was stopped at sea by armed soldiers. This time the crew were tied up with ropes. That same year, Reynolds and Professor Tatsuo Morito of the University of Hiroshima co-founded the Hiroshima Institute of Peace Science (HIPS). Reynolds became a spokesman for the Japanese peace movement and attempted to work with its Gensuikyo branch until he found it too political for his taste, reporting to the press, \\"Peace cannot be achieved in an atmosphere of hatred.\\" Earle and Barbara divorced in 1964 and Earle married Akie Nagami, a citizen of Hiroshima and a graduate of Hiroshima Women's College where Earle was guest Professor of Anthropology. Together Earle and Akie continued his voyages in the Phoenix. In 1967 a multi- national crew delivered nearly a ton of medical aid to the Red Cross Society of North Vietnam for civilian victims of the Vietnam War. They spent eight days visiting hospitals in Hanoi and Hai Phong and observing the effects of American bombing on outlying villages.Boardman, Elizabeth Jelinek. The Phoenix Trip: Notes on a Quaker Mission to Haiphong, Burnsville, N.C.: Celo Press, 1901 Hannah Branch Road, Burnsville, NC 28714, 1985 Two other voyages to Vietnam followed. Earle and Akie made two attempts to sail the Phoenix to Shanghai as a gesture of \\"friendship and reconciliation\\" from an American and a Japanese citizen to the people of China, although the Japanese government refused to grant Akie a passport on the grounds China and Japan had no diplomatic relations. In 1968 the Phoenix was stopped on the high seas by a Japanese ship. Two years of litigation followed in Japanese courts. In 1969, with a crew of six Americans, the Phoenix was stopped offshore by Chinese authorities and their entry was prohibited. After these attempts to sail to China, the Japanese government passed a new immigration law cracking down on \\"undesirable aliens\\" (1970) and Reynolds was expelled from his adopted country of 13 years. He and his wife sailed to San Francisco and settled in Ben Lomond, California.Reynolds, Earle. \\"The Center is Quaker: A Personal History of Ben Lomond Quaker Center.\\" Self-published, 1985 He taught Peace Studies at the University of California at Santa Cruz and at Cabrillo College while Akie earned an MA in Peace Studies from Antioch College and worked as a career counselor at UCSC, specializing in peace-making careers and in placing students in overseas jobs. His seminar class founded the Peace Resource Center at Merrill College on the UCSC campus in 1975 but it became a casualty of financial cutbacks in the 1980s. Over a two-week period in 1981, 1900 activists were arrested at Diablo Canyon Power Plant. It was the largest arrest in the history of the U.S. anti-nuclear movement and against nuclear weapons research. Reynolds was one of those arrested. In a 1986 interview,Santa Cruz News, January 9, p. 4 Earle commented on his life work: \\"I've been a kind of a renegade scientist. As soon as I stepped over the boundaries, as soon as my findings became politically sensitive, I lost my credibility as a scientist. Now a scientist will stand on a podium and say what I was saying 30 years ago. I'm like a voice in the wilderness that finally begins to hear answering voices.\\" Earle and Akie Reynolds Collection Bibliography *Growth and Development of Hiroshima Children Exposed to the Atomic Bomb.

It consists of riders racing down a snowy hill riding on a shovel. It has been practiced on both typical snow shovels and modified shovel based sleds. It was once an event in the winter X games, but was removed due to safety concerns. History Competitive shovel racing has its roots in New Mexico's ski resorts in the 1970s. It began after ski resort workers used shovels as sleds to quickly move from one location to another. The sport reached the zenith of its popularity in 1997 when it was featured in the winter X games. After racers crash that year prompted fears that the fledgling sport would be banned. The most prominent competition is held in at the Angel Fire Resort in Angel Fire, New Mexico. In 2005, the resort that hosted the largest annual competition dropped the event due to liability concerns. It was later resumed after modified sleds were banned from competition. Riders often decorate their sleds with custom paint jobs. There is a wide age range in competitors, including students and retirees. Rules Shovel racer after losing control The shovel racer typically races on a basic snow shovel. The rider sits in the shovel facing the handle and leans back with his feet pointed forwards. In some cases, shovel racers have extensively modified shovels to the point that they bear little resemblance to normal shovels. These shovels have been banned from competition due to safety concerns after a high-profile accident on a modified shovel. Competitors generally wax the underside of the shovel in order to increase its speed. The top speed of elite shovel racers can range up to 70 miles per hour (112 km/h).

The novel focuses on the invasion of Europe by the alien Posleen, with an emphasis on Germany. Part of the technology brought to humans by the Galactics is the ability to rejuvenate old soldiers, so that countries can draw on their combat experiences. In Germany, this leads to the controversial decision to reactivate the Waffen-SS. The book's title is a reference to the 19th-century German nationalist song \\"Die Wacht am Rhein\\". Reception The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung published a scathingly negative review by Dietmar Dath. Summing up the novel's attitude as \\"cool retro-fascism from the future\\", the reviewer wrote that the authors' main aim (apart from propagating crude stereotypes about European countries) seemed to be to pontificate about the perceived failings of Western society, such as pacifism and environmentalism, to which the rejuvenated Waffen-SS appear intended to provide a positive contrast. Sfreviews.nets reviewer likewise expressed incredulity at the novel's ahistorical conceit of portraying the Waffen-SS as misunderstood patriots who disagreed with the Nazis' genocidal policies, and at the writers' \\"pandering to the wingnut extreme of the far right\\" by drawing analogies from protests against resistance to alien invaders to real-life antiwar movements.

He was one of three Africans sponsored by Joseph Booth, an English missionary who created independent churches in Nyasaland in the early 20th century, the other two being John Chilembwe and Charles Domingo. Unlike Chilembwe, Kamwana did not favour armed revolt as he was a pacifist, but he was more radical in his quest for rapid African advancement than the more moderate Domingo. The independent church he created, the \\"Mlonda\\", or Watchman Healing Mission, ended all links with the Watch Tower movement in the United States in 1937. Some daughter churches split from Mlonda after Kamwana's death in 1956, but it still exists in several Central African countries.Adiele Eberechukwu Afigbo (1986) in Robin H.

His father had been a tribal chief who was murdered, and Kamwana suffered a dislocated childhood as he continually fled with his mother from Ngoni raids. The forename \\"Masokwa\\" is not given in many sources, but may have been added in childhood following the death of a prominent relative, and this and the additional surname \\"Achirwa\\" otherwise \\"Chirwa\\" are frequently omitted, so he is generally known as Elliot Kenan Kamwana.

When Kamwana was eventually allowed to return to Nyasaland in 1937, he initiated the Mlondo or Watchman Healing Mission, an African initiated church entirely independent of the Watch Tower Society, with its own rituals and scriptural interpretations, although many of its members still read the Watch Tower Society's magazines.

Until 2009 it belonged to the municipality of Korpo. Its Finnish-language name is Haapasaari, although this name is seldom used. The village is known for its white limestone church that has a red brick roof. The current church was built in 1955‚Äì1956; however, a church has existed in the place since the Middle Ages. The old church was destroyed in a storm in 1949. History The commercially seafaring Vikings landed on Asp√∂ during the Viking period, 800 - 1050 AD. In the 13th century it also served as a harbour for traders. The trade route was laid between Tallinn, Estonia and Denmark. In the beginning of the 20th century only about 30 people lived on Asp√∂. Now there are only about 10 people. During World War I until 1917, Asp√∂ served as Russian naval military watchpost. In 1944 it served as the German navy base as the Germans were not allowed to anchor on √Öland proper. In the 1910s the Russians had a patrol station on the island. In the 1940s it was used as a harbour for submarines. On the contrary to the year of 1941, on 1944 the Finns allowed instead of √Öland proper, the German navy to use only Asp√∂ and N√∂t√∂ as the naval base Rotbuche as there was a suspicion of the Tanne West operation which would have led to the German occupation of √Öland Islands. The question became actual from 20 June to 27 June, when the president of the republic of Finland, mr. Risto Ryti and the foreign minister Joachim von Ribbentrop negotiated the terms continuing the war after the German arms export embargo in since April, 1944 due to the negotiations of peace with the Soviet union. A heavy naval detachment was sent via Ut√∂ towards Asp√∂. A ship called M/S Eivor transports passengers between Asp√∂ and Nagu. Many men on Asp√∂ work as maritime pilots and the women serve on the tourist branch. As for the tourist attractions there is a new chapel built 1955‚Äì1956. The chapel has been built several times since 1696, in the years 1728, 1850 and 1905. Asp√∂-Eik had played folk music which tradition is taken care of Bruno Johansson and his son Tore Johansson.

History of compilation  The exact date of the compilation of ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát s·ª≠ l∆∞·ª£c was unknown but due to the last record of the book, which was the era name of Tr·∫ßn Ph·∫ø ƒê·∫ø, the compilation was likely finished around 1377. The author of the book was unknown as well but there are several sources who claim it was the historian S·ª≠ Hy Nhan who took charge of the compilation. Ranked first in the 1363 imperial examination, S·ª≠ Hy Nhan was so famous for his knowledge of history that the Tr·∫ßn emperor decided to change his family name from Tr·∫ßn to S·ª≠ (which means \\"history\\" in Vietnamese). Another source reckoned that ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát s·ª≠ l∆∞·ª£c was a condensed version of the ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát s·ª≠ k√Ω which was written by L√™ VƒÉn H∆∞u in 1272, or only the book Vi·ªát ch√≠ (Annals of Viet) by Tr·∫ßn Ph·ªï with the supplements of Tr·∫ßn Dynasty's era names, but they could not verify these two hypotheses because of the lack of historical evidences. During the Fourth Chinese domination, many valuable books of ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát were taken away by the Ming Dynasty, including the ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát s·ª≠ k√Ω, and subsequently were lost. Although being transferred to China, ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát s·ª≠ l∆∞·ª£c was still preserved in its original form and was published in the Siku Quanshu of the Qing Dynasty under the name Vi·ªát s·ª≠ l∆∞·ª£c, the first character ƒê·∫°i (Â§ß, means Great) was left out to suit the Chinese notion of propriety and historical tradition. Therefore, the book is considered the earliest annals about history of Vietnam that remains today and the most important book which was brought back to Vietnam from China. In 1978, ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát s·ª≠ l∆∞·ª£c became the first historical book of Vietnam that was translated directly from H√°n t·ª± to Russian.  Contents  The ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát s·ª≠ l∆∞·ª£c was written in H√°n t·ª± and covered the history of Vietnam from the reign of Tri·ªáu ƒê√† (2nd century BCE) to the collapse of the L√Ω Dynasty (1225) with a supplemental list of era names of Tr·∫ßn emperors from Tr·∫ßn Th√°i T√¥ng to Tr·∫ßn Ph·∫ø ƒê·∫ø. The contents of ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát s·ª≠ l∆∞·ª£c were divided into three volumes (quy·ªÉn), the first called Qu·ªëc s∆° di√™n c√°ch corresponded with the period from the foundation of VƒÉn Lang, the first nation of Vietnam in the 7th century BCE to the 12 Lords Rebellion (10th century), the second and third books were named Nguy·ªÖn k·ª∑ (Period of the Nguy·ªÖn) and narrated the reign of the L√Ω Dynasty with the royal family name L√Ω was changed to Nguy·ªÖn by the Tr·∫ßn Dynasty in order to avoid the given name of Tr·∫ßn L√Ω, grandfather of the emperor Tr·∫ßn Th√°i T√¥ng, and make people forget the former dynasty.

Bissinger, and the movie inspired by the book. He attended Permian High School in Odessa, Texas. Miles is a major figure in Bissinger's book as one of the top high school fullbacks in Texas. He was sought by dozens of top college football schools, but his promising career was derailed by a knee injury. Early life Miles was born en route to St. Luke's Hospital in Houston with a police escort on April 16, 1970. He lived with his parents until he was three when his mother left him with his maternal grandmother in Houston and moved permanently to Oklahoma without him. Around the age of five Miles went to live with his father, James Sr. The elder Miles was working two jobs, as a truck driver and printing-plant laborer. His father lost custody of Boobie when he started dating a woman who, Boobie says, physically harmed him. He was placed in a foster home in the Houston area, and eight months later he was put in the care of his uncle L.V. Miles in Odessa, Texas. The two shared the house with L.V.'s wife, Ruby, and her three daughters. Miles started playing football for the Vikings, a Pop Warner football team that L.V. coached. High school football career In 1987, Miles rushed for 1,345 yards. Expectations were high every year at Permian High School and in 1988 the Associated Press, in its preseason predictions, had chosen Permian to win the state title based partly on the play of Miles.Friday Night Lights From the spring through the early fall of '88, Miles was heavily recruited by numerous top football schools. Letters came from Notre Dame, Florida State, Nebraska, Houston, Texas A&M;, Clemson, Texas Tech, Oklahoma, Oklahoma State, LSU, SMU, USC, Purdue and Arkansas. However, in a preseason scrimmage against the Amarillo Palo Duro Dons, Miles' leg was caught in the artificial turf when he planted his left leg to stiff-arm a tackler; another player then fell on it from the side. The next day he was examined by a local doctor. The initial diagnosis of the injury was that it was only a sprained ligament. Four days later an orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Dean, examined Miles and felt the injury was severe enough to require arthroscopic surgery. The surgery was performed the day before Permian's season opener against Austin High School. Miles had severely torn the anterior cruciate ligament. He had also torn the cartilage in his left knee. Miles was given the option of immediate reconstructive surgery, which Dean had recommended, or a program of rehabilitation. Rehab would allow Miles to play football with a knee brace. Both Boobie and L.V. opted for the brace. Miles returned against Abilene High School, however left the game limping with a cramp after only a handful of carries. The next week against Midland Lee High School, Permian lost, with Miles threatening to quit the team at halftime for his lack of playing time. Miles quit the team that Monday, and in November 1988 Dean performed reconstructive surgery on his knee. After rehabilitation from the surgery Miles lost much of the speed that had made him an effective fullback. After his injury Miles was the target of racial epithets and was told he \\"should be shot like an animal\\" after being injured. After a fight with L.V., Miles moved out and with Chris Comer taking his place at fullback, Miles did not play for Permian High School again. Friday Night Lights Miles was a key figure in Friday Night Lights: A Town, a Team, and a Dream, a 1990 book by H. G. Bissinger that followed the story of the 1988 Permian High Panthers football team as they made a run towards the Texas state championship. In 2002, Sports Illustrated named Friday Night Lights the fourth-greatest book ever written about sports. A movie version of Friday Night Lights was made and then released in the United States on October 6, 2004. It starred Billy Bob Thornton as Permian Coach Gary Gaines. The film was a box office and critical success and, in turn, spawned an NBC television series of the same name, which began airing in October 2006. Boobie was played by Derek Luke. After high school Miles attended Ranger College for a year. He then spent some time playing semi-pro football in Culpeper, Virginia. He has said he regrets trying to play on his injured knee before having surgery to repair it.Boobie's prizes, memories, no regrets He has four children who live in Midland with their mother. As of June 2018, Miles lives in Copperas Cove, Texas with his wife, Becca, and is working for Jack Welch Recruiting. In May 2011, he was charged with aggravated assault. Police said he struck his stepbrother repeatedly in the head with a beer bottle. He received a sentence of five years' deferred probation in district court. He was picked up on a probation violation and served five years in prison. Miles was released in January 2018. In 2012, Buzz Bissinger published a 34-page afterword called After Friday Night Lights, which has Bissinger visiting with Miles and discussing their 25-year friendship. Popular culture In 2010, southern hip hop rapper/producer Big K.R.I.T. released a song entitled \\"Hometown Hero\\" on his mixtape Krit Wuz Here, in which he features Boobie Miles quotes from the movie Friday Night Lights. Big K.R.I.T., also released a song entitled \\"Boobie Miles\\" on his 2012 mixtape 4eva Na Day. Miles is related to Denver Broncos All-Pro Von Miller. Anthony Dixon, a former running back and special-teamer for the Buffalo Bills, is nicknamed ‚ÄúBoobie‚Äù in reference to Miles. Miles Sanders, a current running back for the Philadelphia Eagles, is also nicknamed ‚ÄúBoobie‚Äù in reference to Miles.

In the 1970s, there was discussion about the feasibility of bus service in Concord. Concord's City Council contracted with the Community Services Council to conduct a study. This study served as the framework for the system that was developed. Prior to 1989, Capital Transit had operated bus service in Concord and the YMCA had operated some senior service. In 1989, the City of Concord went out to bid for public transit service. Since high bids came in to operate the service, the city's mayor appointed a committee made up of supporters and detractors of the bus service. The outcome was to approach the Community Action Program Belknap- Merrimack Counties, Inc. (CAPBMCI) to provide the service. CAPBMCI operated and continues to operate senior bus service in the region and, therefore, was in a position to step up to the plate. The agreement was that the city would provide match support (annual federal grants for transit require a 20% or 50% match depending on the type of funding) to purchase buses and three years of operating support as a pilot program. A City of Concord Advisory Committee would work with CAPBMCI. CAPBMCI began CAT and still operates it as one of its programs and transportation systems. From CAT's inception, it included fixed- route service as well as weekday service for seniors and people with disabilities. The routes were from Concord Heights to Concord Hospital and from Penacook to the South End of Concord, along with service for people with disabilities and seniors. At this time, the first Orion buses were used on the routes. Trolley-shaped buses were rented and operated during the six-week holiday season for three years. These trolleys were supported by the Chamber of Commerce, Concord Hospital and Steeplegate Mall. CAMBMCI also assumed operation of senior service that had been operated by the YMCA. In 1991, the City of Concord began to provide CAPBMCI with ongoing funding to support public transportation beyond the three-year pilot. In 1999, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) mandated specific regulations for bus service for people with disabilities. Since CAT already provided such service, it ensured that it conformed to the new ADA regulations. In 1999, CAT also operated the Penacook, Heights, Manchester Street and senior service routes. Manchester Street service was funded through a three-year Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) grant. By 2005, CAT had started a Crosstown bus service between Airport Road and Concord Hospital. The Crosstown bus developed into the Industrial Park route that operates between Industrial Park Drive and the hospital today. CAT started year-round trolley service in 2008 when it received a three-year CMAQ grant. The matching funds for this grant were generously donated by Delta Dental. CAT currently provides fixed route transportation Monday-Friday from 6:00am to 6:30pm in Concord. CAT also provides demand-response transportation to seniors and people with disabilities.

Formation Hair ice on a branch Hair ice forms on moist, rotting wood from broadleaf trees when temperatures are slightly under and the air is humid. Each of the smooth, silky hairs has a diameter of about and a length of up to . The hairs are brittle, but take the shape of curls and waves. They can maintain their shape for hours and sometimes days. This long lifetime indicates that something is preventing the small ice crystals from recrystallizing into larger ones, since recrystallization normally occurs very quickly at temperatures near . The hairs appear to root at the mouth of wood rays (never on the bark), and their thickness is similar to the diameter of the wood ray channels. A piece of wood that produces hair ice once may continue to produce it over several years. In the year 2015, German and Swiss scientists identified the fungus Exidiopsis effusa as key to the formation of hair ice. The fungus was found on every hair ice sample examined by the researchers, and disabling the fungus with fungicide or hot water prevented hair ice formation. The fungus shapes the ice into fine hairs through an uncertain mechanism and likely stabilizes it by providing a recrystallization inhibitor similar to antifreeze proteins.

Ceiling collapse and renovation In 1995 the interior vaulted ceiling of the church collapsed, and 60,000 pounds of plaster fell, breaking through the floor into the basement parish hall. The congregation worshiped for months in a local synagogue, but eventually found the money to repair the floor so that they could worship in the church, albeit in the basement. Because of the great cost of repairing the roof, it was argued that St. Teresa's should be closed. However, the pastor at the time, Father Dennis Sullivan, and his parishioners were determined that St. Teresa's would not close. After the school had been condemned and closed in 1942, it had been torn down and eventually become a parking lot, used by the church and neighborhood residents. The late 1990s was a time of rising property values, as New York City began to revitalize and the Lower East Side began to gentrify, so the parish raised the money it needed through the sale of the parking lot and the adjacent air rights. Extensive renovation of the church included a new roof, new interior appointments salvaged from what was left from the old, and the restoration of three murals painted in the 1880s, depicting St. Patrick teaching the pagan kings of Ireland, St. TeresaHistory official site teaching her sisters and the crucifixion of Christ. The church was reopened in the early winter of 2002 and rededicated by Edward Cardinal Egan, the Archbishop of New York, in early 2003. Father Dennis Sullivan left St. Teresa's in July 2003 and was followed by Father Donald Baker who served as pastor from 2003-2015. Father Jose Serrano as of August 2015 is their current pastor.

Synopsis  While on approach to Heathrow, about five minutes before the flight was due to land, a 55-year-old Australian named Laurence James Downey went into the toilet and doused himself in petrol. He then went to the cockpit and demanded that the plane continue on to Le Touquet ‚Äì C√¥te d'Opale Airport in France, and refuel there for a flight to Tehran, Iran. Upon landing at Le Touquet, Downey further demanded the publication in the Irish press of a nine-page statement which he had the captain throw from the cockpit window.  Standoff  After an eight-hour standoff (during which time Downey released 11 of his 112 hostages), French special forces stormed the plane and apprehended Downey. No shots were fired and nobody was injured. It emerged that Downey was being sought by police in Perth, Australia, in connection with a $70,000 land fraud incident, and was also wanted in Shannon, Ireland, for alleged assault. In February 1983, he was sentenced, in Saint-Omer, France, to five years' imprisonment for air piracy.  Hijacker  In his statement, Downey claimed to have been a Trappist monk in residence at Tre Fontane Abbey in the 1950s (this was later confirmed by monastery officials), before he was expelled from the order for punching a superior in the face. He then took a job as a tour guide in central Portugal, at a shrine devoted to Our Lady of F√°tima, who is said to have appeared before three children and shared with them three secrets. At the time of the hijacking, the third secret was known only to the Pope and other senior figures in the Catholic Church; Downey's statement called on the Vatican to release this secret to the public.

She grew up in a politically active family. Her father was the secretary-general of the liberal Wafd Party in Gharbia, and his political activities led to his incarceration. Ateya herself took part in demonstrations from a very early age, and she was injured during the 1939 anti-British protests. She continued her studies to an advanced level, which was highly unusual for Egyptian girls at the time. She obtained several university degrees in various fields: a license in letters from Cairo University in 1947, a diploma in education and psychology, a master's degree in journalism and a diploma in Islamic studies. She worked as a teacher for 15 years and had a brief six-month stint as a journalist. Military service In 1956, Ateya became the first woman to be commissioned as an officer in the Liberation Army. She played an active role in the Suez War, during which Egypt was invaded by the United Kingdom, France and Israel. She helped train 4,000 women in first aid and nursing amid the war. Ateya held the rank of captain in a women's commando unit.Sullivan 1986, pp. 39‚Äì40 During the October War of 1973, she chaired the Society of Families of Martyrs and Soldiers, which earned her the nickname of \\"mother of the martyred combatants.\\" She obtained several military awards from the Egyptian state, notably the badge of the Third Army, the Medallion of 6 October and the medal of the armed forces. Parliamentary career Voting rights and eligibility for elected office were extended to Egyptian women by President Gamal Abdel Nasser through the adoption of the 1956 Constitution. The first elections under the new constitution were held the following year, on 3 July 1957. There were only 16 women in a field of more than 2,000 candidates. Opinion polls conducted at the time showed that 70% of Egyptian men were opposed to the idea of women taking seats in Parliament. Nevertheless, Ateya overcame the odds and received 110,807 votes in her constituency. Elected from Cairo in the second round, she described the strong bias she faced at the time by saying: \\"I was met with resentment for being a woman. Yet I talked to them and reminded them of the prophet's wives and families until they changed their opinions.\\" In addition to such religious arguments, she used her military experience as a political asset. Ateya's victory was all the more significant since her opponent in the election was pro-communist lawyer and banker Ahmed Fuad, a personal friend and prot√©g√© of President Nasser. Ateya took her seat in the National Assembly on 14 July 1957. Although another woman (Amina Shukri) was elected in the 1957 elections, her victory was only announced on 22 July, thus making Ateya the first female parliamentarian in Egypt and the whole Arab world. During her time in Parliament, Ateya championed women's rights. She insisted on the implementation of preferential treatment for female workers, notably a two- month maternity leave with full salary. In July 1958, she presented a law abolishing polygamy. Although supported by most MPs from urban districts such as Cairo and Alexandria, the law was strongly opposed by MPs representing rural districts and did not pass. Ateya was also unusually pro-American in an era of intense Arab nationalism and anti-imperialism. After visiting the major communist and socialist-leaning countries of the time such as China, India, the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, she told reporters: \\"I have seen Russia, but I really think that I would like Egypt to be more like the United States of America.\\" She publicly stated that she liked the United States and its president Dwight D. Eisenhower, a position for which she was attacked. Nevertheless, she managed to get away with the criticism due to her strong support for President Nasser, whom she described as \\"beautiful\\". Ateya's victory in 1957 was short-lived: two years later, she lost her bid for re- election. However, she remained active, notably serving on the board of the Red Crescent. Twenty-five years after her electoral loss, Ateya managed to revive her parliamentary career. A social democrat, she was elected to the People's Assembly in 1984 under the banner of the National Democratic Party.Sullivan 1986, p. 108 She headed the Population and Family Council for Giza in 1993. Ateya died in 1997 at the age of 71. Legacy Rawya Ateya is considered a pioneering figure in the history of Egyptian and Arab feminism. In December 2007, a ceremony was held in the Egyptian Parliament to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Ateya's electoral victory. The ceremony was notably attended by Lateefa Al Gaood from Bahrain, who had become a year earlier the first female MP in the Persian Gulf region, as well as Nada Haffadh also from Bahrain and that nation's first ever female cabinet minister.

Use of repetitive prayer formulas goes far back in Christian history, and how these passed into the rosary tradition is not clear. It is clear that the 150 beads (Hail Marys) originated from the 150 Psalms prayed from the Hebrew Psalter. The rosary was a way for the ordinary faithful to simulate the meditation of the monks from the hand-printed Psalter. The second half of the Hail Mary, the petition to Mary, appeared for the first time in the catechism of Peter Canisius in 1555 in the Counter-Reformation period, in reaction against Protestant criticism of some Catholic beliefs.Petrus Canisius, CATECHISMI Latini et Germanici, I, ( ed Friedrich Streicher, S P C CATECHISMI Latini et Germanici, I, Roma, Munich, 1933, I, 12Finley, Mitch. The Seeker's Guide to Saints, 2000, p. 73 Following the establishment of the first rosary confraternities in the fifteenth century, the devotion to the rosary spread rapidly throughout Europe. From the sixteenth century onwards, rosary recitations often involved \\"picture texts\\" that assisted meditation. Such imagery continues to be used to assist in rosary meditations. Origins There are differing views on the origin of the rosary, with some traditions attributing it to Saint Dominic who integrated it into Dominican devotion, but evidence shows its existence prior to his time, and a gradual development over centuries of practice.Beebe, Catherine. St. Dominic and the Rosary Thurston, Herbert, and Andrew Shipman. \\"The Rosary.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 13. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 7 Oct. 2014 The practice of meditation during the praying of repeated Hail Marys goes back at least to the 1400s in Germany and the Carthusian monk Dominic of Prussia who died in 1461, just as the Dominicans Alanus de Rupe and James Sprenger had started to promote the rosary. Psalter of Alanus, 1492 By the 1500s the practice of meditation during the rosary had spread across Europe. Bartolomeo Scalvo's Meditationi del Rosario della Gloriosa Maria Virgine (i.e. Meditations on the Rosary of the Glorious Virgin Mary) printed in 1569 for the rosary confraternity of Milan provided an individual meditation to accompany each bead or prayer.Getz, Christine Suzanne. Music in the collective experience in sixteenth-century Milan, p.261, 2006 Alanus de Rupe encouraged the rosary to be prayed in front of an image of Christ or the Virgin Mary. This style of meditation later resulted in meditation using narrative images, the first of which was eventually printed by Dinkmut in Ulm, Germany. The use of \\"image directed rosary meditation\\" soon gained popularity and at the end of the 16th century the most widely used rosary meditation in Germany was not a written one, but a picture text. During the 16th century, the use of images as a form of religious instruction and indoctrination via silent preaching (muta predicatio) was promoted by Gabriele Paleotti in his \\"Discourse on Sacred and Profane Images.\\"Mitchell, Nathan. The Mystery of the Rosary: Marian Devotion and the Reinvention of Catholicism, pp.37-42, 2009 As the use of devotional images came to be seen as the \\"literature of the layman,\\" Paleotti's goal of the transformation of Christian life through the use of sacred images fostered and promoted Marian devotions including the Rosary.Marino, Adrian. The biography of \\"The idea of literature\\" from antiquity to the Baroque, p.46, 1996 By the 17th century, the 15 wood cut images of the picture rosary had become very popular and rosary books began to use them across Europe. In contrast to written rosary meditations, the picture texts changed little and the same set of images appeared in woodcuts, engravings, and devotional panels for over a hundred and fifty years. Meditation and contemplation A woman places a strand of rosary beads on a devotional image mounted on the wall beside her bed. The Walters Art Museum. The word meditation comes from the Latin word meditari which means to concentrate.Antonisamy, F. An introduction to Christian spirituality, p.76, 2000 In 1577 in her book Interior Castle (Mansions 6, Chapter 7), Saint Teresa of Avila, a Doctor of the Church, defined the general approach to Christian meditation as follows:Teresa of Avila, Interior Castle 1979 page 147 > By meditation I mean prolonged reasoning with the understanding, in this > way. We begin by thinking of the favor which God bestowed upon us by giving > us His only Son; and we do not stop there but proceed to consider the > mysteries of His whole glorious life. This perspective can be viewed as the basis of most scriptural rosary meditations.Walls, Ronald. This Is Your Mother: The Scriptural Roots of the Rosary, p.4, 2003 Scriptural meditations on the rosary build on the Christian tradition of Lectio Divina (divine reading) as a way of using the Gospel to start a conversation between the soul and Christ. Christian meditation is differentiated from contemplation which involves a higher level of focus and detachment from the surroundings and environment.Poulain, Augustin. \\"Contemplation.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 4. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 7 Oct. 2014 The word contemplation (coming from the Latin root templum, i.e. to cut or divide) means to separate oneself from the environment. Saint John of the Cross called contemplation \\"silent love\\" and viewed it as an intimate union with God.Provencher, Maureen. Mysteries in My Hands: Young People, Life and the Rosary, p.28, 2005 Contemplation with the rosary is the next step beyond scriptural meditation. This does not mean that the Gospel is ignored during contemplation, but that the focus moves toward the love of God.Storey, William George. The Complete Rosary: A Guide to Praying the Mysteries, p.59, 2006 In his 2002 encyclical Rosarium Virginis Mariae, Pope John Paul II emphasized that the final goal of Christian life is to be transformed, or \\"transfigured\\", into Christ, and the rosary helps believers come closer to Christ by contemplating Christ. He characterized the contemplative aspects of the rosary as follow: \\"To recite the rosary is nothing other than to contemplate with Mary the face of Christ.\\"Rosarium Virginis Mariae, ¬ß3 And quoting Pope Paul VI he reiterated the importance of contemplation, stating that without contemplation, the rosary is \\"a body without soul.\\" The rosary may be prayed anywhere, but as in many other devotions its recitation often involves some sacred space or object, such as an image or statue of the Virgin Mary.Raitt, Jill. World spirituality, pp.100-101, 1987 Anyone can begin to pray the rosary, but repeated recitations over a period of time result in the acquisition of skills for meditation and contemplation.Griffin, Emilie. Simple Ways to Pray: Spiritual Life in the Catholic Tradition, p.85, 2005 Teachings of the saints The Virgin Mary and Saints on the Feast of the Rosary, by Albrecht D√ºrer, 1506. In the sixteenth century, Saint Peter Canisius, a Doctor of the Church, who is credited with adding to the Hail Mary the sentence \\"Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners,\\" was an ardent advocate of the rosary and its confraternities. Braunsberger, Otto. \\"Blessed Peter Canisius.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 11. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 7 Oct. 2014 He developed and stressed the importance of the meditative aspects of the rosary and was one of the first among the early Jesuits to teach that the principle virtue of each mystery of the rosary should be applied to daily life.Stravinskas, Peter M. J., The Catholic Answer Book of Mary, p.131, 2000 Saint Louis de Montfort, one of the early proponents of the field of Mariology, was a strong proponent of the rosary. He joined the Third Order of the Dominicans in 1710, soon after being ordained a priest, in order to preach the rosary.Burke, Raymond. Mariology: A Guide for Priests, Deacons,seminarians, and Consecrated Persons, p.708, Queenship Publishing, 2008, His books Secret of the Rosary and True Devotion to Mary influenced the Mariological views of several popes. In Secret of the Rosary he taught how \\"focus, respect, reverence, and purity of intention\\" are essential in praying the rosary. He stated that it is not the length of a prayer that matters, but the fervor, purity, and respect with which it is said, e.g. a single meditatively said Hail Mary is worth many that are badly said. In the Secret of the Rosary, he also taught how to fight distractions to achieve the proper mindset for meditating with the rosary.de Montfort, Louis. The Secret of the Rosary, \\"Roses\\" (i.e. chapters) 41-43, Tan Books & Publisher, 1976. , In the eighteenth century, Saint Alphonsus Liguori, a Doctor of the Church, also emphasized the need for proper devotion when praying the rosary. In The Glories of Mary he wrote that the Virgin Mary would be more pleased with five decades of the rosary said slowly with devotion than with fifteen said in a hurry and with little devotion. He recommended that the rosary should be said kneeling before an image of the Virgin Mary and before each decade to make an act of love to Jesus and Mary and ask them for a particular grace.Liguori, Alphonsus. The Glories of Mary, p.481, Liguori Publications, 2000, Saint Padre Pio was a firm believer in meditation in conjunction with the rosary and said: \\"Love the Madonna and pray the rosary, for her rosary is the weapon against the evils of the world today. ...The person who meditates and turns his mind to God, who is the mirror of his soul, seeks to know his faults, tries to correct them, moderates his impulses, and puts his conscience in order.\\"Kelly, Liz. The Rosary: A Path Into Prayer, pp.79, 86, 2004 Papal views In 1569 Pope Pius V, a Dominican himself, officially established the devotion to the rosary in the Catholic Church with the papal bull Consueverunt Romani Pontifices and in 1571 called for all of Europe to pray the rosary for victory at the Battle of Lepanto.Scaperlanda, Maria Ruiz. The Seeker's Guide to Mary, p.151, 2002 Cizik, Ladis J. \\"Our Lady and Islam: Heaven's Peace Plan\\", EWTNChesterton, Gilbert Keith, Lepanto, Ignatius Press, 2004, Pope Leo XIII promulgated ten encyclicals on the rosary and instituted the Catholic custom of daily rosary prayer during the month of October. In 1883 he also created the Feast of Queen of the Holy Rosary.Remigius Baumer, 1988, Marienlexikon, St. Ottilien, pp.41 In Laetitiae sanctae Leo XIII wrote that he was \\"convinced that the rosary, if devoutly used, is of benefit not only to the individual but society at large.\\" Pope Pius XII emphasized the benefits of rosary meditations in his encyclical Ingruentium Malorum and wrote: > And truly, from the frequent meditation on the Mysteries, the soul little by > little and imperceptibly draws and absorbs the virtues they contain, and is > wondrously enkindled with a longing for things immortal, and becomes > strongly and easily impelled to follow the path which Christ Himself and His > Mother have followed.Pope Pius XII. Ingruentium Malorum, Vatican The popes of the 19th and 20th centuries up to Pope Paul VI stressed the Mariological aspects of the rosary. However, in 1974 in his Apostolic Exhortation Marialis Cultus, Pope Paul VI focused more on its traditional meditative, Christocentric nature and stated: \\"The rosary is therefore a prayer with a clearly Christological orientation.\\"Pope Paul VI, Marialis Cultus ¬ß46 Pope John Paul II built on the Christocentric theme of Pope Paul VI, stating: \\"The rosary, though clearly Marian in character, is at heart a Christocentric prayer. In the sobriety of its elements, it has all the depth of the Gospel message in its entirety, of which it can be said to be a compendium.\\"Rosarium Virginis Mariae ¬ß1 He further emphasized the contemplative nature of the rosary and stated that: \\"The rosary belongs among the finest and most praiseworthy traditions of Christian contemplation.\\" Apparitions References to the rosary have been part of a number of reported Marian Apparitions spanning two centuries. The reported messages from these apparitions have influenced the spread of rosary devotions worldwide.Shamon, Albert J. M., The Power of the Rosary, p.5, CMJ Publishers, 2003. Miller, John D., Beads and prayers: the rosary in history and devotion, p.151, 2002 Saint Bernadette Soubirous stated that in the first apparition of Our Lady of Lourdes in 1858, the Virgin Mary had a rosary with her and that Bernadette prayed the rosary in her presence then and during subsequent apparitions.McEachern, Patricia A., A holy life: the writings of Saint Bernadette of Lourdes, p.205, 2005 The Rosary Basilica was built at that site in Lourdes in 1899. The rosary was prominently featured in the apparitions of Our Lady of F√°tima reported by three Portuguese children in 1917. The reported Fatima messages place a strong emphasis on the Rosary and in them the Virgin Mary is identified as The Lady of the Rosary. According to Lucia Santos (one of the three children) in one of the apparitions the Virgin Mary has a rosary in one hand and a Brown scapular in the other hand. Reports of the Fatima apparitions helped spread rosary devotions and a Fatima prayer is now often added to the end of rosary recitations.de Marchi, John. The True Story of Fatima, 1952, EWTNSantos, Lucia., 1976, Fatima in Lucia's Own Words, Ravengate Press, 1976, The Basilica of Our Lady of the Rosary, Fatima, was built at that site in 1953 and has fifteen altars, each dedicated to a mystery of the rosary.Hole, Abigail. Portugal, p.277, Charlotte Beech 2005 In January 1933 an eleven-year-old peasant girl called Mariette Beco reported apparitions of the Virgin Mary in Banneux, Belgium, which became known as the Virgin of the Poor. Mariette reported seeing the Virgin Mary with a rosary in hand. Mariette reported that the apparition repeated three days later after she went outside her house and prayed the rosary. The reports of this apparition, also known as Our Lady of Banneux, were approved by the Holy See in 1949.Ball, Ann.

The parish is under the authority of the Archdiocese of New York. Attached to the complex is the church (1870), a single-cell chapel (1879), a rectory (1880), and a parish house (1893). The church was built for the Protestant Episcopal Church as the Chapel of the Beloved Disciple in the Gothic Revival architectural style. Under various names, the church building has been used by three Christian denominations, including Episcopalians, Dutch Reformed, and Catholics. It is the second-oldest church on the Upper East Side. History and design The church was built from sandstone from Nova Scotia in 1870 to a design by the architectural firm of Hubert & Pirsson. Architectural historian and New York Times journalist Christopher Gray wrote that \\"The Gothic-style building has the air of a picturesque English country church, with a plot of green in front and a square tower rising in front of the sanctuary. According to Andrew S. Dolkart, an architectural historian specializing in church design, the building is closely modeled after Edward Buckton Lamb's Church of St. Martin's, Gospel Oak, London (see Gospel Oak), built in 1865. 'It has almost every little quirky detail of the London church,' says Mr. Dolkart. 'The chamfered corners, the varying planes of the fa√ßade, the asymmetrical pinnacle at the top of the tower. It really captures your attention.'\\" Attached to the complex are a single-cell chapel (1879), and a rectory and a parish house (1880 and 1893). The larger Episcopal Church of the Heavenly Rest, on Fifth Avenue and 45th Street, relocated to 2 East 90th Street, forcing Beloved Disciple to merge with it (its name retained in a chapel). The old church was sold in 1929 to wealthy Dutch Reformed congregants from Harlem who formed the Second Collegiate Church of Harlem. In 1950 they sold the church to the Roman Catholic Church, who rededicated it to St. Thomas More. The church was renovated in the later half of the 20th century by architect Paul C. Reilly. Notable parishioners Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis was a parishioner there until her death, and she had a Mass offered for John F. Kennedy every November 22nd on the anniversary of his death, a tradition later maintained by her daughter Caroline. Her 1994 funeral was held at the nearby St. Ignatius of Loyola because of the number of attendees. On July 23, 1999, after the death and cremation of John F. Kennedy, Jr., the Kennedy family held a private memorial service for him at St. Thomas More, at which Senator Ted Kennedy gave the eulogy and President Bill Clinton attended. Peggy Noonan is also a parishioner. Fashion and street photographer Bill Cunningham was also a regular parishioner and a private Requiem Mass was celebrated for the repose of his soul by Fr Kevin Madigan on June 30, 2016. The private funeral for Lee Bouvier Radziwill was held at the church on 25 February 2019.https://people.com/politics/lee-radziwill-funeral-new-york-city/ References Category:Roman Catholic churches completed in 1870 Category:19th-century Episcopal church buildings Category:19th-century Roman Catholic church buildings in the United States Category:Gothic Revival church buildings in New York City Category:Victorian architecture in New York City Category:Buildings converted to Catholic church buildings Category:Roman Catholic churches in Manhattan Category:Former Episcopal church buildings in New York City Category:Former Dutch Reformed churches in New York (state) Category:Upper East Side ","title":"St. Thomas More Church (New York City)"},{"id":"26126320","text":"Deuterocohnia schreiteri is a plant species in the genus Deuterocohnia.

It is endemic to California, where it is known from scattered occurrences along the Sierra Nevada and one disjunct location in Colusa County, California. It grows in coniferous forests and chaparral in deep sandy substrates. It was differentiated from the very similar Piperia unalascensis in 1993.Coleman, R. A. (2002). The Wild Orchids of California. Comstock Publishing Associates, Cornell University Press, Ithaca. It grows erect to about half a meter in maximum height. The basal leaves are narrow and almost grasslike, measuring up to 16 centimeters long and no more than 2 wide. Leaves higher on the stem are much reduced. The upper part of the stem is a spikelike inflorescence of up to 100 small flowers. The unscented translucent green flowers have curved sepals and sickle-shaped, curving petals a few millimeters in length. The flower can be distinguished from that of P. unalascensis by its shorter spur relative to its lip. There are about 19 known occurrences, several of which are within Yosemite National Park. Other occurrences are in unprotected forested lands and may be vulnerable to disturbance from logging operations.

These announcements were made at Shopify Reunite, the company's first virtual event held as a result of COVID-19.  Criticism  In 2017, the #DeleteShopify hashtag campaign called for a boycott of Shopify for allowing Breitbart News to host a shop on its platform. Shopify's CEO, Tobias L√ºtke, responded to the criticism, saying \\"refusing to do business with the site would constitute a violation of free speech\\". In October 2017, Citron Research founder, short-seller Andrew Left released a detailed report which described the e-commerce platform as a \\"get- rich-quick\\" scheme in contravention of Federal Trade Commission regulations. The day the report was released, the stock plunged more than 11%. The main question he posed was \\"Outside the roughly 50,000 verifiable merchants working with Shopify, who are the other 450,000 the company says it has?\\" Third-party marketing tactics were expected to be improved. Left was quoted in 2019 by The Street as saying about Shopify \\"I still think they are best in class\\".  Data breach  In September 2020, Shopify confirmed a data breach in which customer data less than 200 merchants was stolen. The company claims that the data stolen included names, addresses and order details, but not \\"complete payment card numbers or other sensitive personal or financial information.\\" The company also claims that no evidence has proven that the data has been utilized. Shopify identified two \\"rogue members\\" of its support team to be responsible. The employees in question have been fired and the matter has been forwarded to the FBI.

Plot Dreamer (Enrique Almeida) is being questioned by Detective Gramm (Resmine Atis). We flash back to Dreamer and Shaggy sitting in a car when another car pulls up and does a drive-by shooting. The drive by kills Shaggy and the bullet passes through and into Dreamers head. A girl is poking through a pile of trash and finds the bodies of the men who performed the drive by. It is revealed that Shaggy of the Greenville gang had been going with Vanessa who was with Trigger (Hector Atreyu Ruiz ) of the opposing gang. Vanessa says that the night of the drive-by that Trigger was hiding something. Another shooting leaves two more dead. Detectives Cunningham (Tom Sizemore) and Gramm question two men whom say that the killings were done by members of Greenville. Vanessa gives Dreamer Triggers gun, Dreamer then calls Gramm to have her meet him in the alley where he gives her three spent bullets and casings from the gun. Detective Cunningham confronts Captain Garcia (Edward James Olmos) claiming the only reason he was partnered with Gramm was so she could report on his actions. Afterward Garcia starts cleaning out Cunninghams desk and takes his badge after being attacked by Cunningham. Gramm calls Dreamer to tell him the bullets don't match those that killed Shaggy. After another body is found hacked to death Dreamer goes looking for Trigger accusing him of the murder to cover up the killing of Shaggy. Trigger tells Dreamer that even though he can't remember it he also had a thing with Vanessa and that his number came up before Speedy was killed. Cunningham shows up and shoots Trigger after giving him back his gun. In a garage Dreamer is remembering more of what happened and thinks it was Dusty that shot Shaggy and confronts him with a gun. Gramm and Cunningham who had been listening come in and Gramm tells Dreamer to put down the gun. Cunningham fires setting off a firefight. After a brief chase and Dreamer shooting Dusty in the leg Dreamer is shot by Cunningham, Dreamer shoots Dusty which causes both Gramm and Cunningham to shoot Dreamer killing him.

One of its most popular features was the bonus premiums offered as an inducement to subscribe; at first these consisted of large colored prints of art in traditional style by artists such as Konstantin Makovsky. Later science and literature supplements were added, as well as a children's section; by the end of the century, the most important premium was the collected works of Russian classical authors: \\"By 1912 Niva subscribers had received much of the best in Russian literature, including the works of Gogol, Lermontov, Goncharov, Dostoevsky, Turgenev, Leskov, Chekhov, and others.\\"Brooks, When Russia Learned to Read, p. 113. In his autobiography, Maxim Gorky says that his employers in the early 1880s subscribed to Niva \\"for the cut-out patterns and the prize offers; but they never read it\\"; he himself, however, was enthralled by the volumes he pulled out from under their bed and read at night: \\"[T]he pictures and their captions... placed in my ken a world which widened every day, a world splendid like the cities of romance.

Isidor Schneider (Citadel Press, 1949), pp. 272, 280-81. Niva was very successful; starting with 9,000 readers in its first year, by the early twentieth century it had a circulation of over 200,000. Its editorial office was at 22 Malaya Morskaya Street. It was a large publication, almost the size of a tabloid newspaper; in 1900 a typical issue had 24 pages. Most of the text consisted of serialized fiction by respected writers; there were also short news and sports reports, ethnographic essays, and notes on science and technology, as well as information on all aspects of city life.Saint Petersburg Encyclopedia entry. Its editors included Viktor Klyushnikov (1870 to 1892, with interruptions), Dmitry Stakheev (1875‚Äî1877), Fedor Berg (1878‚Äî1887), Mikhail Volkonsky (1892‚Äî1894), Alexei Tikhonov-Lugovoi (1895‚Äî1897), Rostislav Sementkovsky (1897‚Äî1904), and Valerian Ivchenko-Svetlov (1910‚Äî1916). Among its contributors over the years were A. K.

After Marx's death in 1904, Niva was published by the A. F. Marx Publishing and Printing Company, which was bought by the literary entrepreneur Ivan Sytin in 1916. It continued to be popular after the October Revolution, especially in the provinces (in the capitals it was the object of frequent jokes by the sophisticated), but was closed by the Bolsheviks in September 1918.

Established in the 1840s as Springfield's first Catholic parish, it uses a Gothic Revival church building, the towers of which hold a prominent spot in the city's skyline. As a work of a leading city architect, the building has been named a historic site. History None of Clark County's first residents were Catholics; the first Catholics moved into Springfield circa 1835, and by 1845, the community had nearly seventy Catholic families. The first priest to minister in Springfield was Henry Damian Juncker, the future Bishop of Alton, but his responsibilities elsewhere permitted him to visit Springfield only once or twice monthly, and services were held in private residences or in buildings owned by others. James F. Kearney was the first resident priest, coming in August 1840, but due to illness he resigned after one year's service.Rockel, William M., ed. 20th Century History of Springfield, and Clark County, Ohio and Representative Citizens. Chicago: Biographical, 1908. The members bought land in 1848, and the parish was officially erected in 1849 and dedicated to St. Raphael.Fortin, Roger. Faith and Action: A History of the Archdiocese of Cincinnati 1821-1996. Columbus: Ohio State UP, 2002. Although money was originally lacking for the construction of a building, the parish's needs were supplied by wealthy Cincinnati resident Michael Cassily, and with his money the members built the foundation of a church building. Over the next quarter century, twelve different priests served the parish, holding tenures ranging from one to eighteen years. By the late 1860s, the parish was growing to the point that a single priest could no longer serve everyone: an assistant pastor was appointed in 1868, even though a second parish, St. Bernard, had been formed in 1860. Another parish, St. Joseph, was established in 1884. When W.H. Sidley became the pastor in 1873, he was distressed to discover the parish's diminutive complex: a small brick house of worship, a tiny frame house used as a school, and no rectory whatsoever. He soon arranged for the construction of a rectory, which was finished in the following year at a cost of $7,000. Two years later, he began a more substantial school building, three stories tall, it was completed in September 1877 at a cost of $19,000. By the early 1890s, the church itself was proving insufficient for the parish's needs, and the process of replacing it began in early 1892 as the original brick building was destroyed. Six years passed before the completion of the replacement building, which was consecrated by William Henry Elder, the Archbishop of Cincinnati, on July 17, 1898. During the 1920s, the church prospered amid civil strife. In 1923, when Archbishop Moeller was raising money for Mount St. Mary's Seminary of the West, St. Raphael's was wealthy enough to provide $10,000 for the school fund, amounting to fully 10% of the total. Its funds also sponsored Springfield Central Catholic High School, meant for students of all city parishes rather than for St. Raphael parishioners only. Conversely, the church was the focus of rising Ku Klux Klan sentiment in Springfield. Among the most exciting incidents in the parish history occurred during a KKK parade: the Klansmen planned to process past the church, but the parish priest stood before the parade, blocking the way, and the Klansmen turned aside.

The building's general plan is that of a streamlined Latin cross, with slight gabled projections near the rear forming the crosspieces. Three entrances pierce the facade, while lancet windows of similar height are placed at varying locations in the towers, and two-story windows fill the side bays. Widest and tallest are the windows placed in the rear-side projections and above the entrances on the facade. Both towers are topped with pointed roofs, surrounded by ornamental pointed roofs of far smaller sizes, while the roof of the main part of the church is a steep gable. Despite extensive Gothic Revival detailing, such as the pointed- arch windows and doorways, the building also retains some elements of the Romanesque Revival style, including the false buttresses and columns around the main entrance, as well as the sheer massing of both towers. By the time that the building was complete, parishioners had spent $75,000 on construction and ancillary costs. The architect for St. Raphael's was Charles A. Cregar, first among architects native to Springfield. Cregar was responsible for numerous grand buildings in Springfield, including City Hall, and St. Raphael's is among the chief examples of his work. Recent history The church nave. St. Raphael's remains an active part of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cincinnati, but no longer as a separate parish: St. Joseph's and St. Raphael's have been combined into a single parish.Our Parish Community, St. Joseph/St. Raphael Parish, n.d. Accessed 2014-02-24. The church building itself has received wide recognition: it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in June 1976, due to its historically significant architecture. It is one of six Cregar-designed buildings listed on the Register, along with the former city hall, St. John's Evangelical Lutheran Church, the former Arcade Hotel, St. Joseph's Church, and the former Third Presbyterian Church.

Scientists and diplomats have debated nuclear weapons policy since before the atomic bombing of Hiroshima in 1945. The public became concerned about nuclear weapons testing from about 1954, following extensive nuclear testing in the Pacific. In 1961, at the height of the Cold War, about 50,000 women brought together by Women Strike for Peace marched in 60 cities in the United States to demonstrate against nuclear weapons. In 1963, many countries ratified the Partial Test Ban Treaty which prohibited atmospheric nuclear testing. Some local opposition to nuclear power emerged in the early 1960s,Paula Garb. Review of Critical Masses, Journal of Political Ecology, Vol 6, 1999. and in the late 1960s some members of the scientific community began to express their concerns. In the early 1970s, there were large protests about a proposed nuclear power plant in Wyhl, Germany. The project was cancelled in 1975 and anti-nuclear success at Wyhl inspired opposition to nuclear power in other parts of Europe and North America. Nuclear power became an issue of major public protest in the 1970s.Jim Falk (1982). Global Fission: The Battle Over Nuclear Power, Oxford University Press, pp. 95-96.

Because of concerns about worldwide fallout levels, the Partial Test Ban Treaty was signed in 1963. Above are the per capita thyroid doses (in rads) in the continental United States resulting from all exposure routes from all atmospheric nuclear tests conducted at the Nevada Test Site from 1951‚Äì1962. The Phoenix of Hiroshima (foreground) in Hong Kong Harbor in 1967, was involved in several famous protest voyages against nuclear testing in the Pacific. In 1945 in the New Mexico desert, American scientists conducted \\"Trinity,\\" the first nuclear weapons test, marking the beginning of the atomic age. Even before the Trinity test, national leaders debated the impact of nuclear weapons on domestic and foreign policy. Also involved in the debate about nuclear weapons policy was the scientific community, through professional associations such as the Federation of Atomic Scientists and the Pugwash Conference on Science and World Affairs. On August 6, 1945, towards the end of World War II, the Little Boy device was detonated over the Japanese military city of Hiroshima. Exploding with a yield equivalent to 12,500 tonnes of TNT, the blast and thermal wave of the bomb destroyed nearly 50,000 buildings (including the headquarters of the 2nd General Army and Fifth Division) and killed approximately 75,000 people, among them 20,000 Japanese soldiers and 20,000 Korean slave laborers. Detonation of the Fat Man device exploded over the Japanese industrial city of Nagasaki three days later after Hiroshima, destroying 60% of the city and killing approximately 35,000 people, among them 23,200-28,200 Japanese munitions workers, 2,000 Korean slave laborers, and 150 Japanese soldiers. The two bombings remains the only events where nuclear weapons have been used in combat. Subsequently, the world's nuclear weapons stockpiles grew.Mary Palevsky, Robert Futrell, and Andrew Kirk. Recollections of Nevada's Nuclear Past UNLV FUSION, 2005, p. 20. Operation Crossroads was a series of nuclear weapon tests conducted by the United States at Bikini Atoll in the Pacific Ocean in the summer of 1946. Its purpose was to test the effect of nuclear weapons on naval ships. Pressure to cancel Operation Crossroads came from scientists and diplomats. Manhattan Project scientists argued that further nuclear testing was unnecessary and environmentally dangerous. A Los Alamos study warned \\"the water near a recent surface explosion will be a witch's brew\\" of radioactivity. To prepare the atoll for the nuclear tests, Bikini's native residents were evicted from their homes and resettled on smaller, uninhabited islands where they were unable to sustain themselves. Radioactive fallout from nuclear weapons testing was first drawn to public attention in 1954 when a Hydrogen bomb test in the Pacific contaminated the crew of the Japanese fishing boat Lucky Dragon. One of the fishermen died in Japan seven months later. The incident caused widespread concern around the world and \\"provided a decisive impetus for the emergence of the anti-nuclear weapons movement in many countries\\".Wolfgang Rudig (1990). Anti-nuclear Movements: A World Survey of Opposition to Nuclear Energy, Longman, p. 54-55. The anti-nuclear weapons movement grew rapidly because for many people the atomic bomb \\"encapsulated the very worst direction in which society was moving\\".Jim Falk (1982). Global Fission: The Battle Over Nuclear Power, Oxford University Press, pp. 96-97. Peace movements emerged in Japan and in 1954 they converged to form a unified \\"Japanese Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs\\". Japanese opposition to the Pacific nuclear weapons tests was widespread, and \\"an estimated 35 million signatures were collected on petitions calling for bans on nuclear weapons\\". German publications of the 1950s and 1960s contained criticism of some features of nuclear power including its safety. Nuclear waste disposal was widely recognized as a major problem, with concern publicly expressed as early as 1954. In 1964, one author went so far as to state \\"that the dangers and costs of the necessary final disposal of nuclear waste could possibly make it necessary to forego the development of nuclear energy\\".Wolfgang Rudig (1990). Anti-nuclear Movements: A World Survey of Opposition to Nuclear Energy, Longman, p. 63. The Russell‚ÄìEinstein Manifesto was issued in London on July 9, 1955 by Bertrand Russell in the midst of the Cold War. It highlighted the dangers posed by nuclear weapons and called for world leaders to seek peaceful resolutions to international conflict. The signatories included eleven pre-eminent intellectuals and scientists, including Albert Einstein, who signed it just days before his death on April 18, 1955. A few days after the release, philanthropist Cyrus S. Eaton offered to sponsor a conference‚Äîcalled for in the manifesto‚Äîin Pugwash, Nova Scotia, Eaton's birthplace. This conference was to be the first of the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs, held in July 1957. In the United Kingdom, the first Aldermaston March organised by the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament took place at Easter 1958, when several thousand people marched for four days from Trafalgar Square, London, to the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment close to Aldermaston in Berkshire, England, to demonstrate their opposition to nuclear weapons.A brief history of CND The Aldermaston marches continued into the late 1960s when tens of thousands of people took part in the four-day marches. In 1959, a letter in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists was the start of a successful campaign to stop the Atomic Energy Commission dumping radioactive waste in the sea 19 kilometres from Boston.Jim Falk (1982). Global Fission: The Battle Over Nuclear Power, Oxford University Press, p. 93. On November 1, 1961, at the height of the Cold War, about 50,000 women brought together by Women Strike for Peace marched in 60 cities in the United States to demonstrate against nuclear weapons. It was the largest national women's peace protest of the 20th century. In 1958, Linus Pauling and his wife presented the United Nations with the petition signed by more than 11,000 scientists calling for an end to nuclear-weapon testing. The \\"Baby Tooth Survey,\\" headed by Dr Louise Reiss, demonstrated conclusively in 1961 that above-ground nuclear testing posed significant public health risks in the form of radioactive fallout spread primarily via milk from cows that had ingested contaminated grass. Public pressure and the research results subsequently led to a moratorium on above- ground nuclear weapons testing, followed by the Partial Test Ban Treaty, signed in 1963 by John F. Kennedy and Nikita Khrushchev.Jim Falk (1982). Global Fission: The Battle Over Nuclear Power, Oxford University Press, p. 98. On the day that the treaty went into force, the Nobel Prize Committee awarded Pauling the Nobel Peace Prize, describing him as \\"Linus Carl Pauling, who ever since 1946 has campaigned ceaselessly, not only against nuclear weapons tests, not only against the spread of these armaments, not only against their very use, but against all warfare as a means of solving international conflicts.\\"Jerry Brown and Rinaldo Brutoco (1997). Profiles in Power: The Anti-nuclear Movement and the Dawn of the Solar Age, Twayne Publishers, pp. 191-192. Pauling started the International League of Humanists in 1974. He was president of the scientific advisory board of the World Union for Protection of Life and also one of the signatories of the Dubrovnik-Philadelphia Statement. After the Partial Test Ban Treaty The Shippingport Atomic Power Station was the first full-scale PWR nuclear power plant in the United States. The reactor went online December 2, 1957, and was in operation until October, 1982. Radioactive materials were accidentally released from the 1970 Baneberry Nuclear Test at the Nevada Test Site. The 18,000 km2 expanse of the Semipalatinsk Test Site (indicated in red), which covers an area the size of Wales. The Soviet Union conducted 456 nuclear tests at Semipalatinsk from 1949 until 1989 with little regard for their effect on the local people or environment. The full impact of radiation exposure was hidden for many years by Soviet authorities and has only come to light since the test site closed in 1991. 120,000 people attended an anti-nuclear protest in Bonn, Germany, on October 14, 1979, following the Three Mile Island accident. In the United States, the first commercially viable nuclear power plant was to be built at Bodega Bay, north of San Francisco, but the proposal was controversial and conflict with local citizens began in 1958. The proposed plant site was close to the San Andreas Fault and close to the region's environmentally sensitive fishing and dairy industries. The Sierra Club became actively involved.Thomas Raymond Wellock (1998). Critical Masses: Opposition to Nuclear Power in California, 1958-1978, The University of Wisconsin Press, pp. 27‚Äì28. The conflict ended in 1964, with the forced abandonment of plans for the power plant. Historian Thomas Wellock traces the birth of the anti-nuclear movement to the controversy over Bodega Bay. Attempts to build a nuclear power plant in Malibu were similar to those at Bodega Bay and were also abandoned. In 1966, Larry Bogart founded the Citizens Energy Council, a coalition of environmental groups that published the newsletters \\"Radiation Perils,\\" \\"Watch on the A.E.C.\\" and \\"Nuclear Opponents\\". These publications argued that \\"nuclear power plants were too complex, too expensive and so inherently unsafe they would one day prove to be a financial disaster and a health hazard\\".Keith Schneider. Larry Bogart, an Influential Critic Of Nuclear Power, Is Dead at 77 The New York Times, August 20, 1991.Anna Gyorgy (1980). No Nukes: Everyone's Guide to Nuclear Power South End Press, , p. 383. The emergence of the anti-nuclear power movement was \\"closely associated with the general rise in environmental consciousness which had started to materialize in the USA in the 1960s and quickly spread to other Western industrialized countries\\". Some nuclear experts began to voice dissenting views about nuclear power in 1969, and this was a necessary precondition for broad public concern about nuclear power to emerge.Wolfgang Rudig (1990). Anti-nuclear Movements: A World Survey of Opposition to Nuclear Energy, Longman, p. 52. These scientists included Ernest Sternglass from Pittsburg, Henry Kendall from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Nobel laureate George Wald and radiation specialist Rosalie Bertell. These members of the scientific community \\"by expressing their concern over nuclear power, played a crucial role in demystifying the issue for other citizens\\", and nuclear power became an issue of major public protest in the 1970s.Jim Falk (1982). Global Fission: The Battle Over Nuclear Power, Oxford University Press, p. 95. In 1971, 15,000 people demonstrated against French plans to locate the first light-water reactor power plant in Bugey. This was the first of a series of mass protests organized at nearly every planned nuclear site in France.Dorothy Nelkin and Michael Pollak (1982). The Atom Besieged: Antinuclear Movements in France and Germany , ASIN: B0011LXE0A, p. 3. Also in 1971, the town of Wyhl, in Germany, was a proposed site for a nuclear power station. In the years that followed, public opposition steadily mounted, and there were large protests. Television coverage of police dragging away farmers and their wives helped to turn nuclear power into a major issue. In 1975, an administrative court withdrew the construction licence for the plant,Stephen Mills and Roger Williams (1986). Public Acceptance of New Technologies Routledge, pp. 375-376.Robert Gottlieb (2005). Forcing the Spring: The Transformation of the American Environmental Movement, Revised Edition, Island Press, USA, p. 237.Nuclear Power in Germany: A Chronology but the Wyhl occupation generated ongoing debate. This initially centred on the state government's handling of the affair and associated police behaviour, but interest in nuclear issues was also stimulated. The Wyhl experience encouraged the formation of citizen action groups near other planned nuclear sites. Many other anti-nuclear groups formed elsewhere, in support of these local struggles, and some existing citizen action groups widened their aims to include the nuclear issue. Anti-nuclear success at Wyhl also inspired nuclear opposition in the rest of Europe and North America. In 1972, the anti-nuclear weapons movement maintained a presence in the Pacific, largely in response to French nuclear testing there. Activists, including David McTaggart from Greenpeace, defied the French government by sailing small vessels into the test zone and interrupting the testing program.Paul Lewis.

In Australia, thousands joined protest marches in Adelaide, Melbourne, Brisbane, and Sydney. Scientists issued statements demanding an end to the tests; unions refused to load French ships, service French planes, or carry French mail; and consumers boycotted French products. In Fiji, activists formed an Against Testing on Mururoa organization. In Spain, in response to a surge in nuclear power plant proposals in the 1960s, a strong anti-nuclear movement emerged in 1973, which ultimately impeded the realisation of most of the projects.Lutz Mez, Mycle Schneider and Steve Thomas (Eds.) (2009). International Perspectives of Energy Policy and the Role of Nuclear Power, Multi-Science Publishing Co. Ltd, p. 371. In 1974, organic farmer Sam Lovejoy took a crowbar to the weather- monitoring tower which had been erected at the Montague Nuclear Power Plant site. Lovejoy felled the tower and then took himself to the local police station, where he took full responsibility for the action. Lovejoy's action galvanized local public opinion against the plant.Utilities Drop Nuclear Power Plant Plans Ocala Star-Banner, January 4, 1981.Anna Gyorgy (1980). No Nukes: Everyone's Guide to Nuclear PowerSouth End Press, , pp. 393-394. The Montague project was canceled in 1980,Northeast Utilities System. Some of the Major Events in NU's History Since the 1966 Affiliation after $29 million was spent on the project. By the mid-1970s anti-nuclear activism had moved beyond local protests and politics to gain a wider appeal and influence. Although it lacked a single co-ordinating organization, and did not have uniform goals, the movement's efforts gained a great deal of attention.Walker, J. Samuel (2004). Three Mile Island: A Nuclear Crisis in Historical Perspective (Berkeley: University of California Press), pp. 10-11. Jim Falk has suggested that popular opposition to nuclear power quickly grew into an effective anti- nuclear power movement in the 1970s.Jim Falk (1982). Global Fission: The Battle Over Nuclear Power, Oxford University Press, p. 96. In some countries, the nuclear power conflict \\"reached an intensity unprecedented in the history of technology controversies\\".Herbert P. Kitschelt. Political Opportunity and Political Protest: Anti-Nuclear Movements in Four Democracies British Journal of Political Science, Vol. 16, No. 1, 1986, p. 57.

In West Germany, between February 1975 and April 1979, some 280,000 people were involved in seven demonstrations at nuclear sites. Several site occupations were also attempted. In the aftermath of the Three Mile Island accident in 1979, some 120,000 people attended a demonstration against nuclear power in Bonn. In May 1979, an estimated 70,000 people, including the governor of California, attended a march and rally against nuclear power in Washington, D.C.Jon Agnone.

This was the largest anti-nuclear rally in the U.S. for several decades. In Britain, there were many protests about the government's proposal to replace the aging Trident weapons system with a newer model. The largest protest had 100,000 participants and, according to polls, 59 percent of the public opposed the move.Lawrence S. Wittner. A rebirth of the anti- nuclear weapons movement? Portents of an anti-nuclear upsurge Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, 7 December 2007. The International Conference on Nuclear Disarmament took place in Oslo in February 2008, and was organized by The Government of Norway, the Nuclear Threat Initiative and the Hoover Institute. The Conference was entitled Achieving the Vision of a World Free of Nuclear Weapons and had the purpose of building consensus between nuclear weapon states and non-nuclear weapon states in relation to the Nuclear Non- proliferation Treaty.

She specialised in scientific racism. Her work contributed to the Nazi crimes against the Sinti and Roma peoples. Early life Eva Justin making a facial cast in 1936 Born in Dresden in 1909, the daughter of a railroad official, Eva Justin served as an assistant to Nazi psychologist Robert Ritter. Justin originally trained as a nurse, and received her doctorate in anthropology from the University of Berlin in 1943, despite not having followed the normal university procedure to do so. Eugen Fischer mentored her through her doctoral thesis and final exams, and ethnologist Richard Thurnwald was a reviewer. Justin was one of the first registered nurses to earn a PhD. Speaking Romani, she earned the trust of Roma and Sinti people. Her doctoral dissertation was titled \\"Lebensschicksale artfremd erzogener Zigeunerkinder und ihrer Nachkommen\\" (\\"Biographical destinies of Gypsy children and their offspring who were educated in a manner inappropriate for their species\\"). Holocaust Romani children at St. Josefspflege orphanage in Mulfingen, Germany, used in Eva Justin's racial studies for her PhD dissertation The children that Justin studied had been selected for deportation, but this was delayed until she completed her research and received her PhD. The children were then sent to the Gypsy family camp at Auschwitz on 6 May 1944. Soon after their arrival, Josef Mengele arrived at Auschwitz. Some of the children were subjected to his experiments and most were eventually killed in the gas chamber. Approximately 39 or 40 children that Justin had studied were sent to Auschwitz in 1944, and all but four died before the end of the war, many before her thesis was published. Thirty-nine children from an orphanage in Mulfingen who were the subjects of Justin's doctoral thesis were registered at Auschwitz on 12 May 1944. She searched for anthropological subjects in concentration camps. Justin was a senior member of the Race Hygiene Research Center. She wrote in the foreword to a research paper that she hoped to provide the basis for further racial hygiene laws to stop the flow of \\"unworthy primitive elements\\" into the German population. Her position was that Gypsies could not be assimilated because they usually became asocial as a result of their primitive thinking, and that attempts to educate them should be stopped. Justin proposed sterilization for Gypsies, except for those with pure Gypsy blood. She was present when the Sinti and Roma deportations to concentration camps were organized. In 1958, the Frankfurt district attorney initiated an investigation into Justin's wartime actions, but the investigation was closed in 1960, after the district attorney had concluded that her actions were subject to the statute of limitations. Frankfurt magistrates found insufficient evidence to prosecute Justin in 1964, believing that Justin had not known her ideas would lead to the children being sent to concentration camps and that survivors could not specifically remember her striking them. Justin had based her work on the ideas of Robert Ritter and no longer believed them. In post-war West Germany, Justin worked as a psychologist for the Frankfurt police, even acting as a consultant to the legal system for compensation cases for Holocaust survivors. She died from cancer in 1966 in Offenbach am Main, a city on the outskirts of Frankfurt.

Elg, 307 U.S. 325 (1939), was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States that a child born in the United States to naturalized parents on U.S. soil is a natural born citizen and that the child's natural born citizenship is not lost if the child is taken to and raised in the country of the parents' origin, provided that upon attaining the age of majority, the child elects to retain U.S. citizenship \\"and to return to the United States to assume its duties.\\". Background Marie Elizabeth Elg was born in the Brooklyn section of New York City in 1907 to two Swedish parents who had arrived in the United States some time prior to 1906; her father was naturalized in 1906. In 1911, her mother took the four-year-old to Sweden; her father went to Sweden in 1922, and in 1934 made a statement before an American consul in Sweden that he had \\"voluntarily expatriated himself for the reason that he did not desire to retain the status of an American citizen and wished to preserve his allegiance to Sweden.\\" In 1929, within eight months of attaining the age of majority, Marie Elg obtained an American passport through the American consul in Sweden, and returned to the United States. In 1935 she was notified by the U.S. Department of Labor that she was an illegal alien and was threatened with deportation. Elg sued to establish that she was a citizen of the United States and not subject to deportation. Frances Perkins was listed as the nominal plaintiff in the case, being the Secretary of Labor during the administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt, when the case was appealed to the Supreme Court.\\"Court rulings on dual citizenship \\", richw.org, page fetched 8 February 2010. Decision Chief Justice Hughes wrote for the Court: * Elg became a citizen of the United States upon her birth in New York; the Civil Rights Act of 1866 had specifically addressed the issue of a child born in the United States to alien parents; * When a citizen of the United States who is a minor has parents who renounce their American citizenship, the minor does not lose his American citizenship as a result, \\"provided that, on attaining majority he elects to retain that citizenship and to return to the United States to assume its duties\\"; * Some provisions of the Naturalization Convention and Protocol of 1869 between the U.S. and Sweden, which provided for the loss of U.S. citizenship by any United States citizen who chose to \\"expatriate\\" -- to become a naturalized citizen of another country, live there, and lose their United States citizenship -- did not apply to minors, as the minor's move out of the United States was not to be considered a voluntary act; * The acquisition of \\"derivative Swedish citizenship\\" by a minor likewise does not force the minor to lose his American citizenship. The Court's first holding, that Elg was a citizen upon birth within the United States, was a reaffirmation of United States v. Wong Kim Ark (1898). The case was argued for the United States by Robert H. Jackson, who later became a Supreme Court justice. This was the only Supreme Court case that Jackson lost in his two years as Solicitor General.Great American lawyers: an encyclopedia, Volume 1, John R. Vile, Page 391. 2001.

She is the widow of singer-songwriter Jim Croce and the mother of singer-songwriter A. J. Croce. Between 1964 and 1971, Ingrid and Jim Croce performed as a duo. In 1969, Capitol Records released their album, Jim & Ingrid Croce. Their song, \\"Age\\", won a country music award in the late 1970s. Biography Early life Croce was raised in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in a Jewish family. When she was eight, she worked at her grandmother's dress store in South Philadelphia. Her mother, Shirley, played piano on her own local television show. She learned to cook with her and started singing in local clubs and on television by the time she was 10. Her father, Sidney Jacobson, was a general practitioner with his medical office in their home in West Philadelphia. By the age of 15, she was employed as the \\"junior art therapist\\" assisting her father at the University of Pennsylvania where he did his residency for his psychiatric practice. Before her sixteenth birthday, her mother died at the age of 36 from breast cancer and a weak heart. She left high school and gymnastics and moved to her father's home in the suburbs. She and her twin sister, Phyllis, attended several high schools after the death of their mother. They graduated from Nether Providence High School in 1965. Croce attended Rhode Island School of Design and Moore College of Art and travelled to Mexico in her senior year when she won a fellowship to study painting and pottery in San Miguel de Allende. With Jim Croce When Jim Croce and Ingrid discovered they were going to have a child, Jim became more determined to make music his profession. He sent a cassette of his new songs to a friend and producer in New York City in the hope that he could get a record deal. When their son Adrian James Croce (A. J. Croce) was born in September 1971, Ingrid became a stay-at-home mom, while Jim went on the road to promote his music. Two years later, as Jim Croce's songs were topping the music charts, his plane crashed in Natchitoches, Louisiana, on September 20, 1973, a week before A.J.'s second birthday. After Jim died, Ingrid and A.J. spent time in Quepos, Costa Rica. After they moved to San Diego, she developed a Head Start program for Costa Rica, opened a children's school in Point Loma, and wrote a children's book, Mirandome. When A. J. was almost four years old, he was temporarily blinded by \\"serious physical abuse\\" at the hands of Ingrid Croce's boyfriend. From 1977 to 1981, Croce served as Vice-Consul of Costa Rica in San Diego. She wrote and sang songs, completed two solo albums, and started the publishing company Time in a Bottle. She sat on the board of the Woman's Bank and traveled to Israel, where A. J. took his rites of passage. In 1983, she became a dedicated runner and won third place in her age category in the Stockholm Marathon.

In the late 1980s, Ingrid Croce became a board member of the California Restaurant Association, San Diego County Chapter, and the San Diego Convention & Visitors Bureau. In 2004, her determination to build San Diego into a top dining destination led her to launch San Diego Restaurant Week. In 2010, the event drew 200,000 guests to close to 200 restaurants twice a year. In 2014, Croce closed the downtown business and re-opened in Bankers Hill as Croce's Park West.

It focuses on \\"interdisciplinary studies of law and economics\\" and \\"an advanced understanding of the economic effects of divergent laws\\".emle.org It is offered by a consortium of nine universities: Erasmus University Rotterdam (co-ordinating institution), University of Hamburg, University of Bologna, University of Ghent, University of Aix-Marseille, University of Vienna, University of Haifa, Warsaw School of Economics and the Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research. Students who participate in the EMLE Program usually divide their time between two or three of the participating Universities and, depending on their allocations, can receive multiple-degrees from each institution where they have undertaken studies. The partner universities variously award LL.M., M.Sc. or M.A. degrees. The language of instruction is English, but the master thesis can also be written in another European language. History of the programme The European Master Programme in Law and Economics started in 1990 at the University of Oxford, University of Ghent, Paris Dauphine University, and Erasmus University Rotterdam with 20 students from a variety of countries. From the very beginning, the Programme received recognition and financial support of the ERASMUS Bureau of the European Community. The partner universities exchanged multilateral agreements to continue their joint venture and made all the necessary arrangements in order to be included in the new SOCRATES framework between the European Commission and the European universities. The number of partner universities has increased rapidly and the network now comprises seven teaching centres within the EU and two internationally. Admission Admission to the EMLE is extremely selective. Applicants must have a bachelor's or master's degree in law or economics with high academic merit. Degrees from related disciplines are also acceptable, provided that the curriculum comprises a significant number of courses in law or economics. Preference is given to applicants who already have a first masters or above, and most admitted students already hold advanced degrees. The demand for a place in the programme has steadily risen. Given the increase in the number of applications, the acceptance rate is now consistently below 10%. While most students still come from within the E.U., over 30 other countries are represented in each class. Structure The European Master Programme in Law and Economics is the primary source of high quality postgraduate education in the field of the economic analysis of law. The EMLE is designed to provide students with advanced knowledge in the Economic Analysis of Law and to allow them to use economic methods to explain and assess the effects of divergent legal rules. Students study introductory courses and core courses on the major topics in the economic analysis of law. Students also take specialized courses and write a master thesis. The EMLE includes three kinds of courses: Economic Courses, Comparative Law Courses, and Law and Economics Courses. Students will become competent to work for private companies, public organizations, as economic advisers, or for large multinational law firms. Graduates are also well prepared for research in Law and Economics. Many EMLE graduates now hold teaching positions in European universities. Reputation and accreditation The EMLE has been recognized as an Erasmus Mundus Masters Course by a panel of independent academic experts and chosen by the Selection Committee out of 128 proposals. The European Commission has designated the programme of \\"outstanding academic quality.\\" The Master in Law and Economics is the only Masters Course in Economics and one of the two Erasmus Mundus Courses in the legal discipline. In 2002, the EMLE Programme was already selected to take part in the Joint Masters Project of the European University Association (together with 10 other networks). In August 2004, the EMLE program in Rotterdam and Ghent was accredited by the NVAO, the Accreditation Organisation of the Netherlands and Flanders. Also in 2004, The EMLE was also included in the list of the eleven best European Joint Masters by the EUA. In February 2005, the EMLE was accredited by ZEvA, the German Central Evaluation and Accreditation Agency. The EMLE has participated in the TEEP II Project, which is a form of external quality assurance and The TEEP II Committee showed a very high appreciation of the EMLE. The Israeli economic newspaper Haaretz classified the EMLE programme as \\"the most elitist integrated Master program\\"Haaretz, 22 August 2010, Amit Ben - Aroya, \\"◊ë◊ë◊ï◊ß◊® ◊û◊©◊§◊ò ◊û◊°◊ó◊®◊ô, ◊ë◊¢◊®◊ë ◊©◊ô◊ò◊ï◊ò ◊ë◊§◊ê◊®◊ô◊°\\", http://www.themarker.com/law/1.578905 for law and economics. Governance The EMLE is organized and governed by Associated Members and a Committee of Patronage, which is composed of public and private research institutions, governmental bodies, law firms and consulting firms, commercial enterprises, and renowned scholars in law and economics. Associated Members include: Deutsche Bundesbank, Deutsche Bank AG, De Nederlandsche Bank, Ernst & Young, White & Case Deloitte, Covington & Burling LLP, Centre for European Policy Studies, European Association of Law and Economics, RiskMetrics Group, Joseph von Sonnenfels Center for the Study of Public Law and Economics, Bombay Stock Exchange Limited, and many other notable institutions. The Committee of Patronage includes world-leading Professors: James M. Buchanan (Nobel Prize Award 1985), Ronald Coase (Nobel Prize Award 1991), Robert Cooter (University of California, Berkeley), R. Epstein (University of Chicago), Michael Faure (University of Maastricht), William Landes (University of Chicago), Ejan Mackaay (University of Montr√©al), Henry Manne (former Dean - George Mason University Law School), A.

Williamson (University of California, Berkeley), and O. Zerbe, Jr. (University of Washington). The Midterm Meeting The first Midterm Meeting of the EMLE took place in Ghent in 1991. Since then the Midterm Meeting of EMLE has grown to be a multi-facetted event, a symposium of lectures and scientific discussion seminars, informal networking and other social activities. This annual event now rotates between Bologna, Ghent and Hamburg, and also serves as the forum for the EMLE graduation ceremonies. The EMLE Midterm Meeting attracts one of the largest groups of Law and Economics scholars in the world and is widely regarded as one of the leading conferences for law and economics.

It features SpongeBob SquarePants characters and is the first SpongeBob racing game since Nicktoons Winners Cup Racing. It is also the first SpongeBob game released by Firebrand Games for the Nintendo DS and ImPulse Games for the Wii. It is compatible with the Wii Wheel. The game features more than 100 different options to customize a boat, and features 4 player mode. Even though this is the racing genre, this game is more of a demolition derby. Plot At Mrs. Puff's Boating School, it's the last test of the year and SpongeBob, as per usual, manages to horrendously fail on his boating test. As he sits on the steps on the entrance to the school, looking quite depressed, a shark named Seymour Scales arrives outside the school in a bus, to find SpongeBob sitting on the entrance ramp. Seymour then tricks him into his \\"D.R.I.V.E.\\" (Destruction, Recklessness, Impairment, Velocity, Escape) classes. As the player progresses through the game, SpongeBob unlocks more friends to sign up. After the final exams, SpongeBob gets his boating licence. But Mrs. Puff informs him it's not real. Then, SpongeBob sees Seymour going into a truck, attempting to escape, after SpongeBob realizes that it was a scam. This leads to a final battle, fought in vehicles, in which SpongeBob wins. He then decides to go to Mrs. Puff's Boating School next year, and Seymour is sent to jail. D.R.I.V.E. Classes Destruction The Destruction class is the first class in Seymour's D.R.I.V.E. lessons. It requires the player to smash into opponents' boats and pick up the parts that are produced from the smash. In some tests, the player is required to reach a set amount of collected parts. In others, the player has to finish in the Top 3 to achieve either a ranking. Recklessness The second class in the D.R.I.V.E. lessons. This class requires the player to smash into opponents' boats, which awards points to the player. In some tests, the player is required to achieve a set score target, while in others, the player must place in the Top 3 to receive a ranking. Reckless Velocity Reckless Velocity is a variation of Recklessness, and is a combination of Recklessness and Velocity, which is the fourth class in the D.R.I.V.E series. Reckless Velocity requires players to complete a race within a certain time limit and also earn a certain number of points to obtain a ranking. Impairment Impairment is the third class in the D.R.I.V.E. lessons. In this class, players must knock out opponents within a set time limit. When the player collides with an opposition player, stars form around that opponent, and they are briefly stopped in the current position. This gives the player the opportunity to repeatedly smash that opponent, eventually knocking them out. Velocity The fourth class in the D.R.I.V.E. lessons. In Velocity, the player must complete a race against up to seven opponents as fast as possible. To achieve a ranking, the player must finish in Top 3. Escape The final class in the D.R.I.V.E. lessons, the player must knock opponents out while they actively hunt down the player. The damage done to opponents is increased massively, however damage done to the player is also increased. Escape occurs in waves, and at the end of each wave, the player's car will be slightly healed, the amount decreasing on each wave. The player must destroy as many cars as possible, again to achieve a ranking.

He was born at Kirkcaldy, Fife, and at an early age went in service to a small farmer near Largo. Later he returned to Kirkcaldy, working as a hand-loom weaver. In around 1800 he moved to Edinburgh (where his younger brother William was training in the law), and established himself as a draper. In 1816 he helped to finance his brother's new venture, The Scotsman newspaper. Following his brother's death in 1831, he became much more involved with the newspaper, giving up the drapery business. Within a few years he was the sole proprietor, having bought out the other shareholders. He turned the paper into a daily in 1855, selling at the price of 1d. In 1842, Ritchie's great-nephew John Ritchie Findlay came to live with Ritchie, and entered the business. In addition to his newspaper activities, Ritchie was a town councillor in Edinburgh, a magistrate, chairman of the Chamber of Commerce and one of the founders of the United Industrial School. On Ritchie's death in 1881, John Ritchie Findlay succeeded him in the ownership of The Scotsman. They are buried in the same family plot at the south end of \\"Lords Row\\" on the western wall of Dean Cemetery in Edinburgh.

A very high title, its holder ranked as the first woman after the Empress herself in the imperial court. The title is attested from the 9th century until the 12th century, but only a handful of its holders are known. History and functions The title means \\"girded lady-patrician\\", often translated into English as \\"Mistress of the Robes\\", and was used for high-ranking court ladies who were attached to the Byzantine empresses as their ladies of honour. Its origin or date of institution are unclear. Disregarding a clearly anachronistic reference to Antonina, the wife of the great 6th-century general Belisarius, as being a zostƒì patrikia, the title is first attested in for Theoktiste, the mother of Empress Theodora. The title is last attested in literary sources (the Skylitzes Chronicle) in 1018, when it was conferred to Maria, the former Empress of Bulgaria, and finally in a series of lead seals dated to the late 11th century (see below). It disappears thereafter, along with many other titles of the middle Byzantine period, following the reforms of Emperor Alexios I Komnenos (). Ivory carving showing Constantine VII dressed with the loros and crowned by Christ In Philotheos's Klƒìtorologion of 899, the dignity of the zostƒì patrikia is placed very high in the imperial order of precedence, coming before the magistros and after the kouropalatƒìs. Her exceptional status is further illustrated by the fact that she was one of only six dignitaries who dined at the imperial table‚Äîalong with the Patriarch of Constantinople, the Caesar, the n≈çbelissimos, the kouropalatƒìs and the basileopat≈çr‚Äîand by the prominent role she played in imperial ceremonies, especially those revolving around the Empress, such as the coronation of an empress or the birth of a child. The z≈çstƒì patrikia functioned as the chief attendant to the empress (to whom she was usually related) and the head of the women's court (the sekreton t≈çn gynaik≈çn), which consisted mostly of the wives of high-ranking officials. Indeed, hers was the only specifically female dignity: other women bore the feminine versions of their husbands' titles. A z≈çstƒì patrikia is therefore, in John B. Bury's words, \\"the only lady who was œÄŒ±œÑœÅŒπŒ∫ŒØŒ± in her own right\\", and not to be confused with a simple patrikia, who was the spouse or widow of a patrikios. The French scholar Rodolphe Guilland points out that the title itself appears to be a compound one, with the sources sometimes calling it \\"the z≈çstƒì and patrikia\\", indicating that the noble title of patrikia was added to the court dignity of z≈çstƒì. Although it appears that, in common with the other supreme dignities with which it is associated, there was a single holder of the dignity at each time, at the reception of Olga of Kiev, the plural form z≈çstai is used, indicating the presence of at least two. This may be accounted for by the fact that at times there were several empresses, and that each one must have had a z≈çstƒì in her particular service. The z≈çstƒì was raised to the rank in an elaborate investiture ceremony in the Theotokos of the Pharos palace chapel, which is recorded in the De Ceremoniis (I.50) of Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos (). The ceremony ended in the Chrysotriklinos audience hall, where she received from the emperor's hands the ivory tablets that were the particular insignium of her office. She then visited the Hagia Sophia, where the tablets were blessed by the Patriarch, before making her way to the Magnaura, where she received the congratulations of the women of the court and the spouses of the high dignitaries. Finally, she returned to the Pharos chapel, where she deposited an offering of 70 nomismata, before retiring to her apartments. Her distinctive dress, however, which probably gave the z≈çstƒì her name, was the broad belt or loros that she put on at the investiture ceremony. A descendant of the ancient Roman consular trabea, the golden l≈çros was the \\"most prestigious imperial insignium\\", and was also worn by the Byzantine emperor and a select few of his highest dignitaries such as the Eparch of Constantinople or the magistroi. A less likely origin of the z≈çstƒì may derive from her position as chief lady-in-waiting to the empress, among whose duties was to supervise her dress, or, as the Patria of Constantinople puts it, to \\"gird\\" the empress. The z≈çstƒì held her title for life, even after the death of an empress she had been appointed to serve. In addition, like most Byzantine titles, the dignity could be conferred as a simple honour without the requirement of service, as was most likely the case with Theoktiste and Maria, the widow of Tsar Ivan Vladislav of Bulgaria. List of known holders Miniature from the Madrid Skylitzes depicting the wedding of Miroslava of Bulgaria to the Byzantine-Armenian aristocrat Ashot Taronites. The couple fled to Byzantium, where Miroslava was appointed z≈çstƒì patrikia. Despite the prominence of their title, the sources mention but rarely the z≈çstai. As Rodolphe Guilland writes, \\"confined to the women's quarters of the empress, they hardly had the opportunity to become known. Certainly the women's quarters were sometimes a hotbed of intrigue and scandal; but the noise of these intrigues and these scandals hardly crossed the walls of the Great Palace.\\" * Antonina, wife of Belisarius (anachronistic reference from the Patria of Constantinople). * Theoktiste, mother of Empress Theodora, the wife of Emperor Theophilos (). * Anastasia, known only through a single reference in the late 10th-century Life of Basil the Younger hagiography.

Special types include dying-and-rising deities, various agricultural deities, and those who descend into the underworld: crossing the threshold between life and death representing the most fundamental of all boundaries. Vegetation deities in particular mimic the annual dying and returning of plant life, making them seasonally cyclical liminal deities. In contrast, the one-time ordeal typical of the dying-and-rising myth, or legends of those who return from a descent to the underworld, represent a more narrow scope of liminal deities.

In a unique way, he spent most of his life within the walls of the same academic institution, \\"Lyc√©e Louis-le-Grand\\" in the heart of Paris, as pupil when a teenager, then as simple teacher, and grew to be its first Head Teacher, while in parallel that establishment evolved from a medley of various private and mostly religious educational foundations under the reigns of Louis XV and Louis XVI into the prototype model of highest level colleges in the French educational system, that emerged in the turmoil of the Revolution years from the educational dreams of the new ruling middle class and took its fundamental properties in the early Empire days (\\"Lyc√©e\\"). Most of all, through the difficult revolutionary years and multiple throes, hazards and harassments during the French Revolution, he contrived in keeping open the Lyc√©e Louis-le-Grand throughout the period, a unique case for institutions of that type. Also notable for some academic work as Hellenist, acknowledged translator of ancient Greek writings, and distinguished as member of the Acad√©mie des inscriptions et belles-lettres, he was closely linked to a transient personality of the Revolution years, Pierre Henri H√©l√®ne Marie Lebrun-Tondu, as of his real name TONDU, also known as LEBRUN or TONDU-LEBRUN, who grew to be Minister of Foreign Affairs for one year (August 1792-June 1793) and ultimately fell a victim to the Terror period instated by Robespierre and his friends.  Biography   Youth and training for educational career Born in 1751 in the small city of Semur-en-Auxois in Burgundy, he got there his early terms of education, certainly with some brilliancy, as he was selected by local powers-that-be to pursue them from his very early teens on at \\"Louis-le-Grand\\", already then a famous educational compound in the center of Paris that was at that time, under the reigns of Louis XV and Louis XVI, organized as a medley of various private and mostly religious educational foundations, where pupils where funded by powers-that-be of high noble rank or of religious standing (such as abbeys or bishops), for example the \\"coll√®ge Dainville\\" (also designated sometimes as the \\"coll√®ge d'Inville\\"), that was patronized by the Chapter of the Cathedral of Noyon (61 Oise, France). The \\"coll√®ge Louis-le-Grand\\" happened in the three decades preceding the French Revolution to be the mold of education of will-be prime players in that world-changing period: universally-known Maximilien Robespierre and Camille Desmoulins,but also Pierre Henri H√©l√®ne Marie Lebrun- TonduCharles Reybaud, M√©moires authentiques de Maximilien de Robespierre, Bruxelles, L.

(later known as Minister of Foreign Affairs of the First French Republic, from August 1792 till June 1793, under the name of LEBRUN or of LEBRUN-TONDU), all born, like Jean-Fran√ßois Champagne, in the 1750s and early 1760s decade, underwent there most of their education, but as well many promising students with high hopes and perspectives in the sciences, who for example later on joined the Observatoire de Paris, that entertained several research departments of various types (including Mathematics), under the lead of the successive Cassinis, for the which careers \\"Louis-le-Grand\\" was a kind of antechamber. Beneficiary of a scholarship grant from his home town, he stays at Louis-le- Grand as a pupil from 1767 till 1778, then follows up as a simple teacher, then Head teacher for the 6th grade class and probably in succession higher grades. He takes up a statute as religious (¬´ Louis‚Äìle-Grand ¬ª is then under the supervision of the Company of Jesus), and becomes a deacon, a ¬´ natural ¬ª path for those that considered teaching careers in those days (Lebrun-Tondu, three years younger than Champagne, followed pretty much the same path until his mid twenties; they were closely linked as events will spectacularly put in light in 1794). All those steps prepared what should have been a regular, stolid and uneventful educational career. However the great tide of the French Revolution was to change that, as for many others. Around mid 1791, collateral effects of the French Revolution then in full gear-up up bearing on the religious communities that steer the college bring about Jean-Fran√ßois Champagne‚Äôs nomination as Head of the College; he will in fact steer it in a uniquely successful way throughout the ensuing 20 years.  Steering \\"Louis- le-Grand\\" through the Revolution years He has been a teacher about ten years when the Revolution comes out (1789) ; in the ensuing two years, senior colleagues, most of whom with a religious grade of some sort, resign and quit their position. Not him; he steadfastly remains and thus becomes Head Teacher on May 3, 1791. A circumstantial Head Teacher, he reveals himself a providential guide for the ¬´ Lyc√©e Louis-Le-Grand ¬ª through the French Revolution turmoil, body-and-soul devoted to his institution and charge Keeping a firm hand on what remains of the initial College, he will steer it through the turmoil and extraordinary changes and hazards of that extraordinary period. First of all, playing on all his links with the new and rapidly changing powers (he becomes an active member of the Comit√© r√©volutionnaire, section Panth√©on-Fran√ßais), he contrives to remain constantly confirmed in his role as Head of the institution, while it undergoes an incredible succession of names and organizational changes : ‚ÄúColl√®ge √âgalit√©‚Äù (1793), ‚ÄúInstitut des Boursiers √âgalit√©‚Äù (1796), ‚ÄúPrytan√©e Fran√ßais (1798), ‚ÄúColl√®ge de Paris‚Äù (1800), ‚ÄúLyc√©e de Paris‚Äù (1803) and finally ‚ÄúLyc√©e Imp√©rial‚Äù (1804).R.R. Palmer, The School of the French Revolution: a documentary history of the College of Louis-le-Grand and its director Jean- Fran√ßois Champagne, 1762-1814, Princeton, Princeton University Press, 1975. Times are really tough; the originally privately funded institution is deprived of all its properties and own sources of revenues, no allocation is attributed it for quite some time, and he must resort to all sorts of ways, means and expedients to even barely feed his pupils. The site is requisitioned at several occasions and for diverse purposes, even serving as a jail for part of its premises in 1793; notwithstanding all hazards and all enmities and attempts at appropriation, Jean-Fran√ßois Champagne succeeds in keeping the school open for a remainder of students (the older ones have been sent to join the Revolutionary Army on a variety of locations from 1792 on even as late as 1796!) throughout the times, a unique ‚Äútour de force‚Äù without any equivalent from any institution of that type during that period in France. Mostly on his sole energy, dedication, unwavering will and purpose, he contrives in keeping Louis-le-Grand open throughout those troubled times. In January 1794, he definitely abandons his cleric status to marry the widow of his co-disciple and friend Pierre H√©l√®ne Tondu, executed in late December 1793 under orders of Robespierre, this latter himself onetime pupil at Louis-le-Grand like Tondu and Champagne, and who execrated Tondu.Charles Reybaud, M√©moires authentiques de Maximilien de Robespierre, Bruxelles, L. Hauman et Cie, 1830, 2 tomes en 1 volume. Together with the widow, he takes on the charge of the six children of Tondu, whoo had entrusted them unto his care in a letter written a few hours before being sent to the guillotine, all boys of whom will be educated in that same Louis-le-Grand where they have then taken their abode with their father- in-law.  Head Teacher of the prototype best-in-class \\"Lyc√©e Imp√©rial\\"  The advent of the Napoleon years brings a total reversal to these hardships. Tuition and education become again a priority of the State; Louis-le-Grand becomes the model of all high school levels institutions according to the new concepts introduced under the Consulate and Empire early years, and becomes designated as ‚Äúle Prytan√©e Fran√ßais‚Äù; former pupils are become themselves teachers and Heads of like establishments that sprout out in all large cities, the ‚Äúlyc√©es imp√©riaux‚Äù. For 15 years, Jean-Fran√ßois Champagne will serve as the exemplary Head Teacher of Louis-le-Grand. Widely recognized, Jean-Fran√ßois Champagne moves from survival mode to model firmness, order and method, and lords undisputed for an additional 10 years over the revamped Louis-le-Grand, where discipline and application to work are become master words. And in practice as in words! From 1801 on, the private confinement ‚Äúcells‚Äù of the school, where rebellious or insufficiently motivated pupils were detained on bread and water only, were booked 100% on a permanent basis, to the point that in 1803, Champagne requested an extension of their numbers to meet a 1% ratio of the pupils‚Äô population! In parallel, Jean-Fran√ßois Champagne at last has some enough spare time and energy to pursue some personal accomplishments, especially in ancient Greece literature and academics, he enters the ‚ÄúInstitut de France, classe des Sciences morales et politiques‚Äù, in 1795, and even dabbles with politics, getting elected to the Conseil des Cinq-Cents, although it seems he never actually sat. By 1810, ailing health leads to his more or less voluntary retirement from the position and premises that had been his scope for 50 years, he dies three years later on September 14, 1813.

This has the advantages of improving mechanical stiffness, and improving the reliability of the sealing between them. Monobloc techniques date back to the beginnings of the internal combustion engine. Use of the term has changed over time, usually to address the most pressing mechanical problem affecting the engines of its day. There have been three distinct uses of the technique: * Cylinder head and cylinder * Cylinder block * Cylinder block and crankcase In most cases, any use of the term describes single-unit construction, opposed to the more common contemporary practice. Where the monobloc technique has later become the norm, the specific term fell from favour. It is now usual practice to use monobloc cylinders and crankcases, but a monobloc head (for a water-cooled inline engine at least) would be regarded as peculiar and obsolescent.  Cylinder head  Napier engine, with monobloc headKennedy, pp. 163-167 DB 605 inverted aircraft engine of WW2, with monobloc cylinder blocks and heads Sectioned view of an air-cooled single cylinder, with monobloc head and access plug above the side valve The head gasket is the most highly stressed static seal in an engine, and was a source of considerable trouble in early years. The monobloc cylinder head forms both cylinder and head in one unit, thus avoiding the need for a seal. Along with head gasket failure, one of the least reliable parts of the early petrol engine was the exhaust valve, which tended to fail by overheating. A monobloc head could provide good water cooling, thus reduced valve wear, as it could extend the water jacket uninterrupted around both head and cylinder. Engines with gaskets required a metal-to-metal contact face here, disrupting water flow. The drawback to the monobloc head is that access to the inside of the combustion chamber (the upper volume of the cylinder) is difficult. Access through the cylinder bore is restricted for machining the valve seats, or for inserting angled valves. An even more serious restriction is de-coking and re- grinding valve seats, a regular task on older engines. Rather than removing the cylinder head from above, the mechanic must remove pistons, connecting rods and the crankshaft from beneath. One solution to this for side-valve engines was to place a screwed plug directly above each valve, and to access the valves through this (illustrated). The tapered threads of the screwed plug provided a reliable seal. For low-powered engines this was a popular solution for some years. It was difficult to cool this plug, as the water jacket didn't extend into the plug. As performance increased, it also became important to have better combustion chamber designs with less \\"dead space\\". One solution was to place the spark plug in the centre of this plug, which at least made use of the space. This placed the spark plug further from the combustion chamber, leading to long flame paths and slower ignition. During World War I, development of the internal combustion engine greatly progressed. After the war, as civilian car production resumed, the monobloc cylinder head was required less frequently. Only high-performance cars such as the Leyland Eight of 1920 persisted with it. Bentley and Bugatti were other racing marques who notably adhered to them, through the 1920s and into the 1930s, most famously being used in the purpose-built American Offenhauser straight-four racing engines, first designed and built in the 1930s. Aircraft engines at this time were beginning to use high supercharging pressures, increasing the stress on their head gaskets. Engines such as the Rolls-Royce Buzzard used monobloc heads for reliability. The last engines to make widespread use of monobloc cylinder heads were large air-cooled aircraft radial engines, such as the Wasp Major. These have individual cylinder barrels, so access is less restricted than on an inline engine. As they have high specific power and require great reliability, the advantages of the monobloc remained attractive. General aviation engines such as Franklin, Continental, and Lycoming are still manufactured new and continue to use monobloc individual cylinders, although Franklin uses a removable sleeve. A combination of materials are used in their construction, such as steel for the cylinder barrels and aluminum alloys for the cylinder heads to save weight. Common rebuilding techniques include chrome plating the inside of the cylinder barrels in a \\"cracked\\" finish that mimics the \\"cross-hatched\\" finish normally created by typical cylinder honing. Older engines operated on unleaded automotive gasoline as allowed by supplemental type certificates approved by the FAA may require more frequent machining replacement of valves and seats. Special tools are used to maintain valve seats in these cylinders. Non-destructive testing should be performed to look for flaws that may have arisen during extreme use, engine damage from sudden propeller stoppage or extended engine operation at every overhaul or rebuild. Historically the difficulties of machining, and maintaining a monobloc cylinder head were and continue to be a severe drawback. As head gaskets became able to handle greater heat and pressure, the technique went out of use. It is almost unknown today, but has found a few niche uses, as the technique of monobloc cylinder heads was adopted by the Japanese model engine manufacturer Saito Seisakusho for their glow fueled and spark ignition model four-stroke engines for RC aircraft propulsion needs. Monobloc cylinders also continue to be used on small 2 stroke-cycle engines for power equipment used to maintain lawns and gardens, such as string trimmers, tillers and leaf blowers.

Casting technology at the dawn of the internal combustion engine could reliably cast either large castings, or castings with complex internal cores to allow for water jackets, but not both simultaneously. Most early engines, particularly those with more than four cylinders, had their cylinders cast as pairs or triplets of cylinders, then bolted to a single crankcase. As casting techniques improved, the entire cylinder block of four, six or even eight cylinders could be cast as one. This was a simpler construction, thus less expensive to manufacture, and the communal water jacket permitted closer spacing between cylinders. This also improved the mechanical stiffness of the engine, against bending and the increasingly important torsional twist, as cylinder numbers and engine lengths increased. In the context of aircraft engines, the non-monobloc precursor to monobloc cylinders was a construction where the cylinders (or at least their liners) were cast as individuals, and the outer water jacket was applied later from copper or steel sheet.Beaumont, p. 231 This complex construction was expensive, but lightweight, and so it was only widely used for aircraft. V engines remained with a separate block casting for each bank. The complex ducting required for inlet manifolds between the banks were too complicated to cast otherwise. For economy, a few engines, such as the V12 Pierce-Arrow, were designed to use identical castings for each bank, left and right.Ludvigsen, V12 Engine, p. 120 Some rare engines, such as the Lancia 22¬Ω¬∞ narrow-angle V12 of 1919, did use a single block casting for both banks.Ludvigsen, V12 Engine, p. 50-53 Modern cylinders, except for air-cooled engines and some V engines, are now universally cast as a single cylinder block.  Crankcase  Rover V8 engine, with both blocks and crankcase formed en bloc As casting improved and cylinder blocks became a monobloc, it also became possible to cast both cylinders and crankcase as one unit. The main reason for this was to improve stiffness of the engine construction, reducing vibration and permitting higher speeds. Most engines, except some V engines, are now a monobloc of crankcase and cylinder block.  Modern engines - Combined block, head and crankcase  Light-duty consumer-grade Honda GC-family small engines use a monobloc design where the cylinder head, block, and half the crankcase share the same casting, termed 'uniblock' by Honda. Includes sectioned drawings One reason for this, apart from cost, is to produce an overall lower engine height. Being an air- cooled OHC design, this is possible thanks to current aluminum casting techniques and lack of complex hollow spaces for liquid cooling. The valves are vertical, so as to permit assembly in this confined space. On the other hand, performing basic repairs becomes so time-consuming that the engine can be considered disposable. Commercial-duty Honda GX-family engines (and their many popular knock-offs) have a more conventional design of a single crankcase and cylinder casting, with a separate cylinder head. Honda produces many other head-block-crankcase monoblocs under a variety of different names, such as the GXV-series. They may all be externally identified by a gasket which bisects the crankcase on an approximately 45¬∞ angle.

One of his earlier works, The Bride of Abydos is considered to be one of his \\"Heroic Poems\\", along with The Giaour, Lara, The Siege of Corinth, The Corsair and Parisina. These poems contributed to his poetic fame at the time in England.http://www.salon.com/books/today/2002/02/01/feb01/ Plot Divided into two cantos, and further into more than a dozen stanzas each, The Bride of Abydos has a straightforward plot. After an initial description of the Turkish setting, the story opens with the ruler Giaffir rebuking his supposed son, Selim. Selim professes his love for his half-sister, Zuleika, Giaffir's daughter. Angered, the Pasha refuses Selim a key to the royal harem and upbraids him with insults. Zuleika herself appears, radiant in beauty, and soon she is forbidden to marry Selim; she tacitly complies. Later, she exclaims her love to Selim and mourns her fate that would be without him. He, in turn, decries Giaffir's judgment as well and vows vengeance. The first canto closes as Zuleika notices a change in Selim's demeanour and wonders about his evasive language. He comforts her with the knowledge that he still retains the harem key and promises to reveal himself later that night. The second canto again opens with a chthonic description of the Turkish lands and the grotto where the lovers meet. His cloak thrown aside, Selim is dressed as a dashing pirate and declares that Zuleika is not his sister. She is surprised and listens as Selim relates how Giaffir had killed Abdallah, Selim's father and Giaffir's brother. Selim's story continues as he tells her that he learned of his true identity from one of his father's loyal servants, Haroun, and that since Selim himself was raised by Giaffir, he was detested and maltreated. He became a pirate so that he could gather a posse for revenge, and asserts his lust for Giaffir's blood; the silence at the end of Selim's tale is interrupted by the reports of weapons belonging to Giaffir's men. Selim, wishing to kiss his love one last time, tarries to leave the cave and soon falls, dying on the beach, the fatal blow administered by Giaffir himself. The second canto thus ends with Zuleika dying of sorrow for Selim, while Giaffir is forced to live out the rest of his life in solitude.

Byron, however hastily he wrote, returned and revised The Bride many times. Nevertheless, the manuscript tradition reveals only minor tweaks to the poem. In another letterColeridge. p.150. Byron expresses his intent to concoct an illicit love affair between the true brother and sister, but he settled on its final format before actually penning the story. Style The verse structure in The Bride of Abydos has its critics and champions. The majority of the lines are in octosyllabic couplets, but Byron manages to incorporate various other rhyme schemes as well as meters, including heroic couplets and anapests. Because the plot of The Bride is rather simple when compared to his other works at the time, Byron experiments with the meter and language.Joseph, M. K. Byron the Poet. London: Victor Gollancz, LTD, 1964. p.53. However, some declare this experiment to be a failure; Paul West, in Byron: The Spoiler‚Äôs Art, notes the inherent awkwardness between the stresses of the speech and the counts of the line.West, Paul. Byron: The Spoiler's Art. London: Chatto& Windus, 1960. p.49. He cites the following passage as an example of this inability of the stress to correctly align: Characters Inasmuch as the meter is varied and experimental, the characters in The Bride of Abydos are of a simple stock. There are four characters, Giaffir and Zuleika, the former an embodiment for death and destruction, the other for love, and Selim and Haroun, both balanced in death and love, the former party to both while Haroun is to neither.Marshall, William H. The Structure of Byron's Major Poems. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1962. p45. Selim‚Äôs revelation of his true identity separates the two cantos down these lines. Giaffir constantly berates Selim on his lack of warlike prowess, and Selim is quiet and does not clash with the Pasha; thus Selim is solely the lover in the first canto, paired with Zuleika. However, he changes before her: ‚ÄúThis morn I saw thee gentlest, dearest, / But now thou'rt from thyself estranged‚Äù (I.385-86). And so as the pirate, desiring more for revenge than to be safe and alive with Zuleika, the character is now paired with the death and destruction of Giaffir. Haroun, the fourth, is a eunuch, is neither a lover in the harem to which he has the key, nor is he a fighter, for he does not join Selim in vengeance against Giaffir. He is only a catalyst, aiding Selim‚Äôs transformation into a fighter by arming him with the nature of his true identity, without which Selim would be impudent. A fourth voice is also presented; the narrator is a mostly impersonal, omniscient, third-person entity and \\"is nothing more than a standard storytelling device\\". The voice records the drama and supplies the interior motives and monologues without pretense, explaining in a few cases exterior allusions, \\"but, generally within the body of the poem is sparing in offering truly informative commentary\\"Deneau, Daniel P. Byron's Narrative Poems of 1813. Salzburg, Austria: Universitat Salzburg. 1975. p53. Themes Most readily, this poem is read as a love story between Selim and Zuleika. The narrator, too, fashions the work in such a style, establishing the characters first in their relations to each other romantically, following the two lovers as a cohesive character unit for some time, and finally explaining the rest of the plot themes(e.g. revenge and manhood) with respect to the more centralised aspect of love. Nevertheless, even the characters themselves refuse to support such a tradition love-story structure; indeed, Zuleika is wholly in love with Selim, denying her father and every external pressure on her love while imploring Selim to do the same, but her lover himself cannot focus on love. Although he is the featured \\"lover\\" character of the tale, Selim does not choose love above all else, considering himself principled on the themes of filial piety and revenge. One author finds the refusal of Selim to heed Zuleika‚Äôs pleas of love and his turn for vengeance against Giaffir to be \\"a consistent vision of man‚Äôs low estate and the futility of Romantic optimism\\"Gleckner, Robert. Byron and the Ruins of Paradise. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press, 1967. p123. Again, the initial reaction in reading The Bride of Abydos as a poem of revenge is to understand Selim's motives as they are given by the narrator, namely justice for his murdered father. Rather, Selim 's most immediate cause for revenge is his present condition in Giaffir's court, one of unmanliness, another prominent theme in this poem: to the point that it is Giaffir's mistake to underestimate Selim, the prince is forced to strip himself of a masculine identity to hide in the court. Indeed, until the point of the revelation of his true persona and even spanning until the siege on the beach, the only evidence of Selim's manhood is his relationship with Zuleika. And although a clearly heterosexual affair, it is clandestine to all but the lovers themselves, the narrator, and the audience. To Giaffir and the court for the majority of The Bride of Abydos, Selim is a man with no masculinity. Inasmuch as the aspect of sexual identity shadows the Selim's relations with Giaffir and his court, certain sexual perversions, namely incest, seemed to run chiefly in the mind of Byron from the very inception of the poem. Byron allows himself to explore the taboos of such love lines in the wild passions of the Orient, away from British sensibilities. Nevertheless, while using such a foreign setting to entertain tale of taboo, the poet also justifies Selim and Zuleika's relations with respect to knowledge of that culture: \\"[N]one else there could obtain that degree of intercourse leading to general affection\\"Graham, Peter W.

Watson Research Center. Its name comes from the fact that it is an artificial neural net trained by a form of temporal-difference learning, specifically TD-lambda. TD-Gammon achieved a level of play just slightly below that of the top human backgammon players of the time. It explored strategies that humans had not pursued and led to advances in the theory of correct backgammon play. Algorithm for play and learning During play, TD-Gammon examines on each turn all possible legal moves and all their possible responses (two-ply look-ahead), feeds each resulting board position into its evaluation function, and chooses the move that leads to the board position that got the highest score. In this respect, TD-Gammon is no different than almost any other computer board-game program. TD-Gammon's innovation was in how it learned its evaluation function. TD-Gammon's learning algorithm consists of updating the weights in its neural net after each turn to reduce the difference between its evaluation of previous turns' board positions and its evaluation of the present turn's board position‚Äîhence \\"temporal-difference learning\\". The score of any board position is a set of four numbers reflecting the program's estimate of the likelihood of each possible game result: White wins normally, Black wins normally, White wins a gammon, Black wins a gammon. For the final board position of the game, the algorithm compares with the actual result of the game rather than its own evaluation of the board position. After each turn, the learning algorithm updates each weight in the neural net according to the following rule: : w_{t+1} - w_t = \\\\alpha(Y_{t+1} - Y_t)\\\\sum_{k=1}^{t}\\\\lambda^{t-k} abla_w Y_k where: :{- valign=\\"top\\" w_{t+1} - w_t is the amount to change the weight from its value on the previous turn. |- valign=\\"top\\" Y_{t+1} - Y_t is the difference between the current and previous turn's board evaluations. |- valign=\\"top\\" \\\\alpha is a \\"learning rate\\" parameter. |- valign=\\"top\\" \\\\lambda is a parameter that affects how much the present difference in board evaluations should feed back to previous estimates. \\\\lambda = 0 makes the program correct only the previous turn's estimate; \\\\lambda = 1 makes the program attempt to correct the estimates on all previous turns; and values of \\\\lambda between 0 and 1 specify different rates at which the importance of older estimates should \\"decay\\" with time. |- valign=\\"top\\" abla_w Y_k is the gradient of neural-network output with respect to weights: that is, how much changing the weight affects the output. |} Experiments and stages of training Unlike previous neural-net backgammon programs such as Neurogammon (also written by Tesauro), where an expert trained the program by supplying the \\"correct\\" evaluation of each position, TD-Gammon was at first programmed \\"knowledge-free\\". In early experimentation, using only a raw board encoding with no human-designed features, TD-Gammon reached a level of play comparable to Neurogammon: that of an intermediate-level human backgammon player. Even though TD-Gammon discovered insightful features on its own, Tesauro wondered if its play could be improved by using hand-designed features like Neurogammon's. Indeed, the self-training TD-Gammon with expert-designed features soon surpassed all previous computer backgammon programs. It stopped improving after about 1,500,000 games (self-play) using 80 hidden units. Advances in backgammon theory TD-Gammon's exclusive training through self- play (rather than tutelage) enabled it to explore strategies that humans previously hadn't considered or had ruled out erroneously. Its success with unorthodox strategies had a significant impact on the backgammon community. For example, on the opening play, the conventional wisdom was that given a roll of 2-1, 4-1, or 5-1, White should move a single checker from point 6 to point 5. Known as \\"slotting\\", this technique trades the risk of a hit for the opportunity to develop an aggressive position. TD-Gammon found that the more conservative play of 24-23 was superior. Tournament players began experimenting with TD-Gammon's move, and found success. Within a few years, slotting had disappeared from tournament play. (It is now reappearing for 2-1, though.) Backgammon expert Kit Woolsey found that TD-Gammon's positional judgement, especially its weighing of risk against safety, was superior to his own or any human's. TD-Gammon's excellent positional play was undercut by occasional poor endgame play. The endgame requires a more analytical approach, sometimes with extensive lookahead. TD-Gammon's limitation to two-ply lookahead put a ceiling on what it could achieve in this part of the game. TD- Gammon's strengths and weaknesses were the opposite of symbolic artificial intelligence programs and most computer software in general: it was good at matters that require an intuitive \\"feel\\" but bad at systematic analysis.

It is bordered by two different oxygenation and glacial events, but the Boring Billion itself had very low oxygen levels and no evidence of glaciation. The oceans may have been oxygen- and nutrient-poor and sulfidic (euxinia), populated by mainly anoxygenic cyanobacteria, a type of photosynthetic bacteria which uses hydrogen sulfide (H2S) instead of water and produces sulfur instead of oxygen. This is known as a Canfield ocean. Such composition may have caused the oceans to be black- and milky-turquoise instead of blue. Despite such adverse conditions, eukaryotes may have evolved around the beginning of the Boring Billion, and adopted several novel adaptations, such as various organelles and possibly sexual reproduction, and diversified into plants, animals, and fungi. Such advances may have been important precursors to the evolution of large, complex life later in the Cambrian explosion. However, prokaryotic cyanobacteria were the dominant lifeforms during this time, and likely supported an energy-poor food-web with a small number of protists at the apex level. The land was likely inhabited by prokaryotic cyanobacteria and eukaryotic proto-lichens, the latter more successful here probably due to the greater availability of nutrients than offshore ocean waters. Description In 1995, geologists Roger Buick, Davis Des Marais, and Andrew Knoll reviewed the apparent lack of major biological, geological, and climatic events during the Mesoproterozoic era 1.6 to 1 billion years ago (Gya), and, thus, described it as \\"the dullest time in Earth's history\\". The term \\"Boring Billion\\" was coined by paleontologist Martin Brasier to refer to the time between about 2 and 1 Gya, which was characterized by geochemical stasis and glacial stagnation. In 2013, geochemist Grant Young used the term \\"Barren Billion\\" to refer to a period of apparent glacial stagnation and lack of carbon isotope excursions from 1.8 to 0.8 Gya. In 2014, geologists Peter Cawood and Chris Hawkesworth called the time between 1.7 and 0.75 Gya \\"Earth's Middle Ages\\" due to a lack of evidence of tectonic movement. The Boring Billion is now largely cited as spanning about 1.8 to 0.8 Gya, contained within the Proterozoic eon, mainly the Mesoproterozoic. The Boring Billion is characterized by geological, climatic, and by-and-large evolutionary stasis, with low nutrient abundance. In the time leading up to the Boring Billion, Earth experienced the Great Oxygenation Event due to the evolution of oxygenic photosynthetic cyanobacteria, and the resultant Huronian glaciation (Snowball Earth), formation of the UV-blocking ozone layer, and oxidation of several metals. Boring Billion oxygen levels dramatically dropped. It was ended by the breakup of the supercontinent Rodinia during the Tonian (1000‚Äì720 Ma) period, a second oxygenation event, and another Snowball Earth in the Cryogenian period.  Tectonic stasis  The evolution of Earth's biosphere, atmosphere, and hydrosphere has long been linked to the supercontinent cycle, where the continents aggregate and then drift apart. The Boring Billion saw the evolution of two supercontinents: Columbia (or Nuna) and Rodinia. The supercontinent Columbia formed between 2.0 and 1.7 Ga and remained intact until at least 1.3 Ga. Geological and paleomagnetic evidence suggest that Columbia underwent only minor changes to form the supercontinent Rodinia from 1.1 to 0.9 Ga. Paleogeographic reconstructions suggest that the supercontinent assemblage was located in equatorial and temperate climate zones, and there is little or no evidence for continental fragments in polar regions. Due to the lack of evidence of sediment build-up (on passive margins) which would occur as a result of rifting, the supercontinent probably did not break up, and rather was simply an assemblage of juxtaposed proto-continents and cratons. There is no evidence of rifting until the formation of Rodinia, 1.25 Gya in North Laurentia, and 1 Gya in East Baltica and South Siberia. However, breakup did not occur until 0.75 Gya, marking the end of the Boring Billion. This tectonic stasis may have been related in ocean and atmospheric chemistry. It is possible the asthenosphere‚Äîthe molten layer of Earth's mantle that tectonic plates essentially float and move around upon‚Äîwas too hot to sustain modern plate tectonics at this time. Instead of vigorous plate recycling at subduction zones, plates were linked together for billions of years until the mantle cooled off sufficiently. The onset of this component of plate tectonics may have been aided by the cooling and thickening of the crust that, once initiated, made plate subduction anomalously strong, occurring at the end of the Boring Billion. Nonetheless, major magmatic events still occurred, such as the formation (via magma plume) of the central Australian Musgrave Province from 1.22 to 1.12 Gya, and the Canadian Mackenzie Large Igneous Province 1.27 Gya; and plate tectonics were still active enough to build mountains, with several orogenies, including the Grenville orogeny, occurring at the time.  Climatic stability  Graph showing average temperatures during the Mesoproterozoic. Blue line uses CO2 concentration 5 times modern day, red line 10 times, and red dot shows average temperature range at the tropics There is little evidence of significant climatic variability during this time period. Climate was likely not primarily dictated by solar luminosity because the Sun was 5‚Äì18% less luminous than it is today, but there is no evidence that Earth's climate was significantly cooler. In fact, the Boring Billion seems to lack any evidence of prolonged glaciations, which can be observed at regular periodicity in other parts of Earth's geologic history. High CO2 could not have been a main driver for warming because levels would have needed to be 30 to 100 times greater than pre-industrial levels and produced substantial ocean acidification to prevent ice formation, which also did not occur. Mesoproterozoic CO2 levels may have been comparable to those of the Phanerozoic eon, perhaps 7 to 10 times higher than modern levels. The first record of ice from this time period was reported in 2020 from the 1 Ga Scottish Diabaig Formation in the Torridon Group, where dropstone formations were likely formed by debris from ice rafting; the area, then situated between 35‚Äì50¬∞S, was a (possibly upland) lake which is thought to have frozen over in the winter and melted in the summer, rafting occurring in the spring melt. A higher abundance of other greenhouse gases, namely methane produced by prokaryotes, may have compensated for the low CO2 levels; a largely ice-free world may have been achieved with a methane concentration of 140 parts per million (ppm). However, methanogenic prokaryotes could not have produced so much methane, implying some other greenhouse gas, probably nitrous oxide, was elevated, perhaps to 3 ppm (10 times today's levels). Based on presumed greenhouse gas concentrations, equatorial temperatures during the Mesoproterozoic may have been about , in the tropics , at 60¬∞ , and the poles ; and the global average temperature about , which is 4 ¬∞C (7.2 ¬∞F) warmer than today. Temperatures at the poles dropped below freezing in winter, allowing for temporary sea ice formation and snowfall, but there were likely no permanent ice sheets. It has also been proposed that, because the intensity of cosmic rays has been shown to be positively correlated to cloud cover, and cloud cover reflects light back out into space and reduces global temperatures, lower rates of bombardment during this time due to reduced star formation in the galaxy caused less cloud cover and prevented glaciation events, maintaining a warm climate. Also, some combination of weathering intensity which would have reduced CO2 levels by oxidation of exposed metals, cooling of the mantle and reduced geothermal heat and volcanism, and increasing solar intensity and solar heat may have reached an equilibrium, barring ice formation. Conversely, glacial movements over a billion years ago may not have left many remnants today, and an apparent lack of evidence could be due to the incompleteness of the fossil record rather than absence. Further, the low oxygen and solar intensity levels may have prevented the formation of the ozone layer, preventing greenhouse gasses from being trapped in the atmosphere and heating the Earth via the greenhouse effect, which would have caused glaciation. However, not much oxygen is necessary to sustain the ozone layer, and levels during the Boring Billion may have been high enough for it, though the Earth may still have been more heavily bombarded by UV radiation than today. Oceanic composition The oceans seem to have had low concentrations of key nutrients thought to be necessary for complex life, namely molybdenum, iron, nitrogen, and phosphorus, in large part due to a lack of oxygen and resultant oxidation necessary for these geochemical cycles. However, nutrients were more abundant in terrestrial environments, such as lakes or nearshore environments closer to continental runoff. In general, the oceans may have had an oxygenated surface layer, a sulfidic middle layer, and suboxic bottom layer. The predominantly sulfidic composition may have caused the oceans to be a black- and milky-turquoise color instead of blue. Oxygen Earth's geologic record indicates two events associated with significant increases in oxygen levels on Earth, with one occurring between 2.4 and 2.1 Gya, known as the Great Oxygenation Event, and the second occurring an approximate 0.8 Ga. The intermediary period, during the Boring Billion, is thought have had low oxygen levels (with minor fluctuations), leading to widespread anoxic waters. The oceans may have been distinctly stratified, with surface water oxygenated, and deep water suboxic (less than 1 ŒºM oxygen), the latter possibly maintained by lower levels of hydrogen (H2) and H2S output by deep sea hydrothermal vents which otherwise would have been chemically reduced by the oxygen. The decomposition of sinking organic matter would have also leeched oxygen from deep waters. The sudden drop in O2 after the Great Oxygenation Event‚Äîindicated by Œ¥13C levels to have been a loss of 10 to 20 times the current volume of atmospheric oxygen‚Äîis known as the Lomagundi Excursion Event, and is the most prominent carbon isotope event in Earth's history. Oxygen levels may have been less than 0.1 to 2% of modern-day levels, which would have effectively stalled the evolution of complex life during the Boring Billion. Oxic conditions would have become dominant at the second oxygenation event causing the proliferation of aerobic activity over anaerobic, but widespread suboxic and anoxic conditions likely lasted until about 0.55 Gya corresponding with Ediacaran biota and the Cambrian explosion. Sulfur Diagram of how euxinic conditions form In 1998, geologist Donald Canfield proposed what is now known as the Canfield ocean hypothesis. Canfield claimed that increasing levels of oxygen in the atmosphere at the Great Oxygenation Event would have reacted with and oxidized continental iron pyrite (FeS2) deposits, with sulfate (SO42‚àí) as a byproduct, which was transported into the sea. Sulfate-reducing microorganisms converted this to hydrogen sulfide (H2S), dividing the ocean into a somewhat oxic surface layer, and a sulfidic layer beneath, with anoxygenic bacteria living at the border, metabolizing the H2S and creating sulfur as a waste product. This created widespread euxinic conditions in middle-waters, an anoxic state with a high sulfur concentration, which was maintained by the bacteria. Iron Among rocks dating to the Boring Billion, there is a conspicuous lack of banded iron formations, which form from iron in the upper water column (sourced from the deep ocean) reacting with oxygen and precipitating out of the water. They seemingly cease around the world after 1.85 Ga. Canfield argued that oceanic SO42‚àí reduced all the iron in the anoxic deep sea. Iron could have been metabolized by anoxygenic bacteria. It has also been proposed that the 1.85 Ga Sudbury meteor impact mixed the previously stratified ocean via tsunamis, interaction between vaporized seawater and the oxygenated atmosphere, oceanic cavitation, and massive runoff of destroyed continental margins into the sea. Resultant suboxic deep waters (due to oxygenated surface water mixing with previously anoxic deep water) would have oxidized deep-water iron, preventing it from being transported and deposited on continental margins. Nonetheless, iron-rich waters did exist, such as the 1.4 Ga Xiamaling Formation of Northern China, which perhaps was fed by deep water hydrothermal vents. Iron-rich conditions also indicate anoxic bottom water in this area, as oxic conditions would have oxidized all the iron. Lifeforms Low nutrient abundance may have caused increased photosymbiosis‚Äîwhere one organism is capable of photosynthesis and the other metabolizes the waste product‚Äîamong prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea), and the emergence of eukaryotes. Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukaryota are the three domains, the highest taxonomic ranking. Eukaryotes are distinguished from prokaryotes by a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles, and all multicellular organisms are eukaryotes. Prokaryotes 1.44 Ga stromatolite from Glacier National Park, Montana Prokaryotes were the dominant lifeforms throughout the Boring Billion. Anoxygenic cyanobacteria are thought to have been the dominant photosynthesizers, metabolizing the abundant H2S in the oceans. However, in iron-rich waters, cyanobacteria may have suffered from iron poisoning, especially in offshore waters where iron-rich deep water mixed with surface waters, and were outcompeted by other bacteria which could metabolize both iron and H2S. However, iron poisoning could have been abated by silica-rich waters or biomineralization of iron within the cell. Microfossils indicate the presence of cyanobacteria, green and purple sulfur bacteria, methane-producing archaea or bacteria, sulfate-metabolizing bacteria, methane-metabolizing archaea or bacteria, iron-metabolizing bacteria, nitrogen-metabolizing bacteria, and anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria. Eukaryotes Eukaryotes may have arisen around the beginning of the Boring Billion, coinciding with the accretion of Columbia, which could have somehow increased oceanic oxygen levels. However, multicellular eukaryotes had possibly already evolved by this time, with the earliest claimed fossil evidence dating to the Great Oxygenation Event with jellyfish- like Francevillian biota. Following this, eukaryotic evolution was rather slow, possibly due to the euxinic conditions of the Canfield ocean and a lack of key nutrients and metals which prevented large, complex life with high energy requirements from evolving. Euxinic conditions would have also decreased the solubility of iron and molybdenum, essential metals in nitrogen fixation. A lack of dissolved nitrogen would have favored prokaryotes over eukaryotes, as the former can metabolize gaseous nitrogen. 1.6 Ga Ramathallus fossil, the earliest known red alga Nonetheless, the diversification of crown group eukaryotic macroorganisms seems to have started about 1.6‚Äì1 Gya, seemingly coinciding with an increase in key nutrient concentrations. According to phylogenetic analysis, plants diverged from animals and fungi about 1.6 Gya; animals and fungi about 1.5 Gya; Bilaterians and cnidarians (animals respectively with and without bilateral symmetry) about 1.3 Gya; sponges 1.35 Gya; and Ascomycota and Basidiomycota (the two divisions of the fungus subkingdom Dikarya) 0.97 Gya. The earliest known red algae mats date to 1.6 Gya. The earliest known fungus dates to 1.01‚Äì0.89 Gya from Northern Canada. Multicellular eukaryotes, thought to be the descendants of colonial unicellular aggregates, had probably evolved about 2‚Äì1.4 Gya. Likewise, early multicellular eukaryotes likely mainly aggregated into stromatolite mats. The 1.2 Ga red alga Bangiomorpha is the earliest known sexually reproducing and meiotic lifeform, and, based on this, these adaptations evolved 2‚Äì1.4 Gya. However, these may have evolved well before the last common ancestor of eukaryotes given that meiosis is performed using the same proteins in all eukaryotes, perhaps stretching to as far back as the hypothesized RNA world. Cell organelles probably originated from free-living cyanobacteria (symbiogenesis) possibly after the evolution of phagocytosis (engulfing other cells) with the removal of the rigid cell wall which was only necessary for asexual reproduction. Mitochondria had already evolved in the Great Oxygenation Event, but plastids used in plants for namely photosynthesis are thought to have appeared about 1.6‚Äì1.5 Gya. Histones likely appeared during the Boring Billion to help organize and package the increasing amount of DNA in eukaryotic cells into nucleosomes. Hydrogenosomes used in anaerobic activity may have originated in this time from an archaeon. Given the evolutionary landmarks achieved by eukaryotes, this time period could be considered an important precursor to the Cambrian explosion about 0.54 Gya, and the evolution of relatively large, complex life. Ecology Due to the marginalization of large food particles, such as algae, in favor of cyanobacteria and prokaryotes which do not transmit as much energy to higher trophic levels, a complex food web likely did not form, and large lifeforms with high energy demands could not evolve. Such a food web probably only sustained a small number of protists as, in a sense, apex predators. The presumably oxygenic photosynthetic eukaryotic acritarchs, perhaps a type of microalga, inhabited the Mesoproterozoic surface waters. Their population may have been largely limited by nutrient availability rather than predation because species have been reported to have survived for hundreds of millions of years, but after 1 Gya, species duration dropped to about 100 Ma, perhaps due to increased herbivory by early protists. This is consistent with species survival dropping to 10 Ma just after the Cambrian explosion and the expansion of herbivorous animals. Life on land Some of the earliest evidence of the prokaryotic colonization of land dates to before 3 Gya, possibly as early as 3.5 Gya. During the Boring Billion, land may have been inhabited mainly by cyanobacterial mats. Dust would have supplied an abundance of nutrients and a means of dispersal for surface-dwelling microbes, though microbial communities could have also formed in caves and freshwater lakes and rivers. By 1.2 Gya, microbial communities may have been abundant enough to have affected weathering, erosion, sedimentation, and various geochemical cycles, and expansive microbial mats could indicate biological soil crust was abundant. The earliest terrestrial eukaryotes may have been lichen fungi about 1.3 Ga, which grazed on the microbial mats. Abundant eukaryotic microfossils from the freshwater Scottish Torridon Group seems to indicate eukaryotic dominance in non-marine habitats by 1 Gya, probably due to increased nutrient availability in areas closer to the continents and continental runoff. These lichen may have later facilitated plant colonization 0.75 Gya in some manner. A massive increase in terrestrial photosynthetic biomass seems to have occurred about 0.85 Gya, indicated by a flux in terrestrially-sourced carbon, which may have increased oxygen levels enough to support an expansion of multicellular eukaryotes.

The title track became popular with church choirs and helped make their debut album a success. The album earned Youthful Praise two Stellar Award nomination in 2003 for Choir of the Year and Contemporary Choir of the Year. The group was also nominated for a Soul Train Award for Gospel Artist of the Year, and the GMWA Excellence Award for Choir of the Year. The group's sophomore release Thank You for the Change raised their profile even more by featuring a guest vocal performance from Coko, former lead singer of SWV on \\"Up There\\" and containing the highlight song \\"Deliver\\". YP matured their sound even more on the next release Live! The Praise... The Worship which delivered the hit singles like \\"Incredible God, Incredible Praise\\" and \\"You Are So Awesome\\". Youthful Praise continued expanding their borders with television appearances on Late Night with Conan O'Brien, The Stellar Awards, and Bobby Jones Gospel. The ensemble was soon invited to perform with Joan Osborne, Shirley Caesar, and Destiny's Child. Exalted, an exciting collection recorded live in Baltimore, Maryland was released on both CD/DVD in 2007. The following year saw a recap of their success with the compilation The Best of Youthful Praise.

Williams was sentenced in October 2010 to two life sentences for first-degree murder of Jessica Lloyd and Canadian Forces Corporal Marie-France Comeau, in addition to over 80 other lesser charges. In Late January 2010 the Ontario Provincial Police discovered evidence that lead them to suspect Williams involvement in the disappearance of 27-year-old Jessica Lloyd, and suspected links to two other crimes that had been committed in close proximity to other locations near Williams previous home. On February 7th Williams was interrogated by OPP investigator Jim Smyth and confronted with the evidence of tire tracks and boot prints at Lloyds home. Over the next 10 hours Williams gave a detailed confession of not only the sexual assault and murder of Lloyd, but also the sexual assault and murder of Corporal Marie-France Comeau and at least two other cases initially. The subsequent investigation into Williams brought further confessions and revealed evidence of detailed notes and photographs stored at his home. The evidence showed he had broken into at least 82 houses to steal underwear of females including children, this behaviour later escalated to sexual assaults and later still the rapes and murder. He was formally charged with two counts of first-degree murder, two counts of forcible confinement, two counts of breaking and entering, and sexual assault. Another 82 charges relating to breaking and entering were later added. On October 21, 2010, Williams was sentenced to two life sentences for first- degree murder, two 10-year sentences for other sexual assaults, two 10-year sentences for forcible confinement, and 82 one-year sentences for breaking and entering, all to be served concurrently. The life sentences mean Williams will serve a minimum of 25 years before parole eligibility. Since he was convicted of multiple murders, Williams is not eligible for early parole under the \\"faint hope clause\\" of the Criminal Code. From July 2009 until his arrest in February 2010, Williams commanded CFB Trenton, Canada's largest military airbase and a hub for the country's foreign and domestic air transport operations. He was also a decorated military pilot who had flown Canadian Forces VIP aircraft for dignitaries such as Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Philip, and the Governor General and the Prime Minister of Canada. Following charges being made on February 8, 2010, Williams was relieved as the base commander at CFB Trenton. Following his conviction, on October 22, 2010, Williams was stripped of his commission, ranks, and awards by the Governor General on the recommendation of the Chief of the Defence Staff.Email: Chief of Defence Staff to all Canadian Forces members, October 22, 2010 at 1:05 pm (EDT) Subsequent to his conviction, his uniform and all his items of military apparel were burned. Early life and education David Russell Williams was born in Bromsgrove, England, to Christine Nonie (n√©e Chivers) and Cedric David Williams. His family emigrated to Canada, where they moved to Chalk River, Ontario. His father was hired as a metallurgist at Chalk River Laboratories, Canada's premiere nuclear research laboratory. After this relocation, the Williams family met another family, the Sovkas, and they became good friends. Williams' parents divorced when he was six years old, and soon after, Nonie Williams married Dr. Jerry Sovka. During this time, Williams took the name Sovka from his stepfather, and moved again to Scarborough, Ontario, a suburb of Toronto. While in the Scarborough Bluffs area, Williams began high school at Birchmount Collegiate, but finished at Upper Canada College. He delivered The Globe and Mail newspaper and learned to play the piano. By 1979, his family moved to South Korea, where Sovka was overseeing another reactor project. Williams completed his final two years of high school as a boarding student at Upper Canada College while his parents were in South Korea. In his final year in 1982, he was selected as a prefect for his boarding house. Williams then studied economics and political science at the University of Toronto Scarborough (UTSC), graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in 1986. At UTSC, Williams engaged in pranks against his roommates, picking locked doors and hiding in rooms for hours to surprise the occupants.Above Suspicion, The Fifth Estate (Canadian Broadcasting Corporation), September 24, 2010, Accessed August 12, 2017 Military service Williams was regarded as a model military officer over the course of his 23-year career. He joined the Canadian Forces in 1987, received his flying wings in 1990, and was posted to 3 Canadian Forces Flying Training School, based at CFB Portage la Prairie, Manitoba, where he served for two years as an instructor. Promoted to captain on January 1, 1991, Williams was posted to 434 Combat Support Squadron at CFB Shearwater, Nova Scotia, in 1992, where he flew the CC-144 Challenger in the electronic warfare and coastal patrol role. In 1994, he was posted to the 412 Transport Squadron in Ottawa, where he transported VIPs, including high-ranking government officials and foreign dignitaries, also on Challengers. He was promoted to major in November 1999 and was posted to Director General Military Careers, in Ottawa, where he served as the multi-engine pilot career manager. He earned a Master of Defence Studies from the Royal Military College of Canada in 2004 with a 55-page thesis that supported pre-emptive war in Iraq, and in June 2004, he was promoted to lieutenant-colonel and the following month, he was appointed commanding officer of 437 Transport Squadron at CFB Trenton, Ontario, a post he held for two years. From December 2005 to May 2006, Williams also served as the commanding officer of Camp Mirage, a secretive logistics facility believed to be located at Al Minhad Air Base in Dubai, United Arab Emirates that provides support to Canadian Forces operations in Afghanistan. Williams was posted to the Directorate of Air Requirements on July 21, 2006 where he served as project director for the Airlift Capability Projects Strategic (C-17 Globemaster III) and Tactical (CC-130J Super Hercules), and Fixed-Wing Search and Rescue (CC-127J Spartan), working under Lieutenant General Angus Watt at this posting. In January 2009, he was posted to the Canadian Forces Language School in Gatineau, Quebec, for a six-month period of French language training, during which he was promoted to colonel by recommendation of the now-retired Watt. On July 15, 2009, Williams was sworn in as the Wing Commander at CFB Trenton by the outgoing Wing Commander Brigadier General Michael Hood. CFB Trenton is Canada's busiest air transport base and locus of support for overseas military operations. Located in Trenton, Ontario, the base also functions as the point of arrival for the bodies of all Canadian Forces personnel killed in Afghanistan, and the starting point for funeral processions along the \\"Highway of Heroes\\" whence their bodies are brought to Toronto for autopsy.Unusual suspects Williams had been described as an elite pilot and \\"shining bright star\\" of the military. He had flown Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh, the Governor General of Canada, the Prime Minister of Canada, and many other dignitaries across Canada and overseas in Canadian Forces VIP aircraft. Investigation leading to arrest 27-year-old Jessica Lloyd went missing on January 28, 2010. Investigators identified distinctive tire tracks left in mud near her home. One week after her disappearance, the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) conducted an extensive canvassing of all motorists using the highway near her home from 7 pm on February 4, 2010, to 6 am the following day, looking for the unusual tire treads. Williams was driving his Nissan Pathfinder that day‚Äîrather than the BMW he usually drove‚Äîand an officer noticed the resemblance of his tire treads. These were subsequently matched to the treads near Lloyd's home. On February 7, 2010, Williams was at his newly built home in the Ottawa suburb of Westboro, where his wife lived full-time and he lived part-time, when he was called by the Ottawa Police Service and asked to come in for questioning. Interview & confession On 7th February 2010, Williams was interrogated at the police headquarters by OPP Detective Staff Sergeant Jim Smyth. Williams was confronted with the evidence gathered so far starting at 3 p.m. with the interrogation lasting approximately ten hours overall. By 7.45 p.m Williams had begun confessing to his crimes. In the confession, Williams gave details of and admitted to dozens of crimes including the sexual assaults in Tweed. Some of them occurred at homes within walking distance of his new home where he lived with his wife. Other break-ins and thefts occurred in Belleville, and in Tweed, where the couple had a cottage since 2004. He also told police where they could find evidence inside his Ottawa home, including hidden keepsakes, and photographs that he took of his victims and of himself modelling in their underwear. He then identified on a map where he dumped Lloyd‚Äôs body. Early the next morning, Williams led investigators to the woman's body in a secluded area on Cary Road, 13 minutes away from where he lived. Charges Along with the murder charges, Williams was charged with breaking and entering, forcible confinement, and the sexual assault of two other women in connection with two separate home invasions near Tweed, Ontario in September 2009. According to reports, the women had been bound in their homes and the attacker had taken photos of them.Police to begin hunt for 'trophies' tied to rapes and murders Williams was also charged in the death of Corporal Marie-France Comeau, a 37-year-old military traffic technician based at CFB Trenton, who had been found dead inside her home in late November 2009. Williams was arraigned and remanded into custody on Monday, February 8, 2010. The Canadian Forces announced that day that an interim commander would soon be appointed to replace him (Dave Cochrane took over 11 days later), and removed his biography from the Department of National Defence website the following day. Hours after the announcement of Williams' arrest, police services across the country reopened unsolved homicide cases involving young women in areas where Williams had previously been stationed. According to news reports, police began looking at other unsolved cases based on a full statement that Williams gave to police. A week after his arrest, investigators reported that, along with hidden keepsakes and other evidence they had found in his home, they had matched a print from one of the homicide scenes to his boot. In addition to the four primary incidents, the investigation into Williams includes probes into 48 cases of theft of women's underwear dating back to 2006. In the searches of his Ottawa home, police discovered stolen lingerie that was neatly stored, catalogued, and concealed. In April 2010, Williams was placed on suicide watch at Quinte Detention Centre in Napanee, Ontario after he tried to kill himself by wedging a stuffed cardboard toilet paper roll down his throat. After his conviction he was stripped of the rank of colonel in the Royal Canadian Air Force as well as his military decorations of the South-West Asia Service Medal with \\"AFGHANISTAN\\" Clasp and the Canadian Forces Decoration (CD) with 1 Clasp by order of the Governor General of Canada David Johnston. He will be allowed to keep his military pension equal to $60,000 CAD per year as his pension can only be removed through an act of Parliament.https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/russell-williams-stripped-of- colonel-s-rank-1.865703https://www.ctvnews.ca/russell-williams-stripped-of- colonel-rank-1.566053 Court proceedings and trial Williams appeared before the Ontario Court of Justice in Belleville, Ontario via video link from the Quinte Detention Centre on July 22, 2010, where his next court appearance was set for August 26. Again via video link, Williams waived his right to a preliminary inquiry and thus had his next appearance scheduled at the Ontario Superior Court of Justice for October 7, 2010. Williams' lawyer stated then that his client would plead guilty to all charges filed against him. On October 18, 2010, Williams pleaded guilty to all charges. On the first day of Williams' trial and guilty plea, details emerged of other sexual assaults he committed, including that of a new mother who was woken with a blow to the head while she and her baby were asleep in her house. The first day of trial revealed that Williams also had pedophiliac tendencies, stealing underwear of girls as young as nine years old. He made 82 fetish-related home invasions and attempted break-ins between September 2007 and November 2009. Williams had progressed from break-ins to sexual assaults with no penetration to rape and murder. He had kept detailed track of police reports of the crimes he was committing, logged his crimes, kept photos and videos, and had even left notes and messages for his victims. In a break-in into the bedroom of a 12-year-old, he left a message in her computer saying: \\"Merci\\" (\\"Thank you\\" in French). He had taken thousands of pictures of his crimes, and had kept the photos on his computer. Crown Attorney Robert Morrison presented numerous pictures of Williams dressed in the various pieces of underwear and bras he had stolen, frequently masturbating while lying on the beds of his victims. Some of the photos presented on the first day of his trial were published in several newspapers. As some newspapers explained, although troubling, the photos were published because they capture the essence of the crimes of Williams and show the true nature of his crimes. Among the news media that published some of the released photographs were The Montreal Gazette and The Toronto Star. Ontario Superior Court Justice Robert F. Scott sentenced Williams on October 22, 2010, to two concurrent terms of life imprisonment, with no consideration of parole for 25 years. The Governor General revoked Williams' commission and, later, medals, and he was expelled from the Canadian Forces for service misconduct, the most serious extant charge. After being returned to the Forces, his uniform was burned, his medals were cut into pieces, and his commission scroll (the instrument of his commission) was shredded; these actions being similar to a military degradation. His vehicle, a Pathfinder, was similarly crushed and scrapped. Williams currently collects a $60,000 annual military pension. In May 2010, he and his wife also split their real estate holdings, leaving Williams the sole owner of their cottage in Tweed and his wife the sole owner of their Ottawa townhouse. Williams refused to pay $8,000 in victim surcharge fines, resulting in action being taken against him by a collection agency. Williams was initially incarcerated at Kingston Penitentiary, in the prison's segregation unit. After the prison began the process of closing, he was moved to the Port-Cartier Institution, a maximum-security prison in Port-Cartier, Quebec. On May 10, 2012, the Canadian Forces announced that it had made a \\"terrible mistake\\" by publishing a booklet with a photograph bearing the likeness of Williams in the background, and ordered 4,000 copies of the book destroyed. The photograph was incidental to the subject matter of the book, but the image was felt to be offensive.'Terrible mistake': DND booklet shows Russell Williams at CTV.ca; published May 9, 2012; retrieved April 23, 2014 Personal life On June 1, 1991 Williams married Mary Elizabeth Harriman, who is an associate director of the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada. According to Williams' biography that had been posted on the Department of National Defence website, he was a keen photographer, fisherman and runner, and he and his wife were avid golfers. The couple moved to Orleans, a suburb of Ottawa, in July 2006. By then Williams had been posted to the Directorate of Air Requirements at the National Defence Headquarters. He served at the Airlift Capability Projects Strategic (CC-177 Globemaster III) and Tactical (CC-130J Hercules J), and Fixed-Wing Search and Rescue. In December 2010, Williams' wife began the process of filing for divorce, together with a request to have any of her financial and medical information sealed by the court. Fictional portrayals A television movie adaptation of the Williams case, An Officer and a Murderer, with American actor Gary Cole in the lead role, premiered on the Lifetime Network in the United States on July 21, 2012. A Canadian premiere on The Movie Network, originally planned for August 2012, was cancelled after \\"reviewing the media coverage\\" of the US premiere. An Officer and a Murderer eventually aired on Canadian television in August 2013. Television and film The Canadian investigative news program The Fifth Estate released an episode titled \\"Russell Williams: Above Suspicion\\" on September 24, 2010. The American investigative news programs 48 Hours aired \\"Name, Rank and Serial Killer?\\" on April 9, 2011 and on August 13, 2015 Dateline NBC aired a piece covering the Williams case, titled \\"Conduct Unbecoming\\". Season four of the documentary television series I Survived... (originally aired on September 30, 2012) featured one of Williams' victims recounting her story of Williams attacking her in her home. In November 2017, Dutch film director Ram√≥n Gieling released a documentary, Fatum (Room 216), that uses footage of Williams' 10-hour-long police interrogation. In popular culture J. K. Rowling has stated that the serial killer in her novel Troubled Blood was, in part, based on Williams.

His output of works include 10 operas, a ballet, an oratorio, and numerous vocal and chamber works. Pizzi graduated from the Milan Conservatory in 1884 where he was a pupil of Antonio Bazzini and Amilcare Ponchielli and attended classes with Pietro Mascagni. Shortly after completing his education, he moved to London where he remained for almost 13 years. In 1885 his operetta Lina won the Bonetti Competition. In 1889 his first opera, Guglielmo Ratcliff, won first prize at the Baruzzi Competition. His fourth opera, Gabriella, was commissioned by Adelina Patti and she portrayed the title role when the work premiered in Boston in 1893 at the Metropolitan Theatre with the composer in attendance.

He was President of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI) in 1811, 1820, 1844 and 1855. Life Crampton was born in Dublin, Ireland, the son of John Crampton and Anne VernerBurke's Peerage, 1857: Sir Philip Crampton. He was a childhood friend of Theobald Wolfe Tone, the United Irishman, and a cousin, on his mother's side, of Thomas Verner, Grand Master of the Orange Order. He was indentured to Solomon Richards and soon after commenced studies at the RCSI School. He joined the army as an assistant surgeon. When he was appointed surgeon to the Meath Hospital in 1798 he was not yet fully qualified, and went on to graduate MD in Glasgow University in 1800 and by 1801 he was a Member of RCSI. He was to remain in the Meath Hospital for nearly sixty years. A few years later he also became assistant surgeon at the Lock Hospital, Dublin and also built up a large private practice at his house in Dawson St. He joined Peter Harkan in teaching anatomy in private lectures, forming the first private school of anatomy and surgery in the city.Obituary, British Medical Journal, 26 June 1858 Cameron in his History of RCSI notes of him: \\" In 1805 Crampton published an essay on Entropeon, or inversion of the eyelid, which excited considerable interest at the time. In 1813 he described, a muscle in the eyes of birds, arising from the inner surface of the bony hoop which surrounds the cornea, and terminating in a circular tendon connected with the circular lamina of the cornea. By means of this muscle the lens can be so adjusted‚Äîtelescoped, so to speak‚Äîas to enable it to see objects at short or long distances, as required. This muscle has been termed musculus cramptonius in honour of its discoverer\\"Cameron, Sir Charles A. (1886) History of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, and of the Irish Schools of Medicine &c; Dublin: Fannin & Co. pp. 343-344. He became a Fellow of the Royal Society (F.R.S.) in Ireland for this treatise on the construction of eyes of birds. This was later published, with other writings, in the Dublin Journal of Medical Science.Dublin Journal of Medical Science, January 1839, p. 527 left In 1821, together with Sir Henry Marsh (with whom he shared a mutual cousin, Philip Cecil Crampton) and Dr. Charles Johnston, he founded a children's hospital in Pitt St. (now Balfe St.), the Institute for Sick Children in 1821. This hospital was the first teaching children's hospital in Ireland or Great Britain. The main objective of the hospital was to treat sick children in one of the poorest parts of Dublin, The Liberties. He resigned the chief-surgeoncy of the Lock Hospital when he was appointed surgeon-general to the forces in Ireland. He remained as consulting surgeon to Dr Steevens' Hospital and the Dublin Lying-in Hospital. He was elected President of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI) on four occasions. He was created a baronet on 14 March 1839.Boylan, p. 86 He was always interested in zoological science and played an active part in founding the Royal Zoological Society of Ireland and was many times its president. He was also a member of the Royal Irish Academy. He died at his residence, 14 Merrion Square, in Dublin. The Crampton Memorial Sir Philip Crampton's memorial in Dublin The Crampton Memorial, at the junction of College St. with Pearse St. and D'Olier St., was erected from the design of John Kirk the sculptor in 1862. It was of a curious design, consisting of a bust above a fountain and surmounted by a cascade of metal foliage. This monument was locally known in the 19th century as the \\" water- babe\\",Cosgrave and later as the \\"cauliflower\\", \\"pineapple\\" or \\"artichoke\\".Peter, p. 32 As it was slowly falling apart, it was removed in 1959.Reinventing Modern Dublin by Yvonne Whelan James Joyce references the monument in his novel Ulysses when Leopold Bloom passes the monument and thinks, \\"Sir Philip Crampton's memorial fountain bust.

Marginal cost is an economic concept that measures the cost of an additional unit. The marginal abatement cost, in general, measures the cost of reducing one more unit of pollution. Although marginal abatement costs can be negative, such as when the low carbon option is cheaper than the business-as- usual option, marginal abatement costs often rise steeply as more pollution is reduced. Marginal abatement costs are typically used on a marginal abatement cost curve, which shows the marginal cost of additional reductions in pollution.  Usage  Carbon traders use marginal abatement cost curves to derive the supply function for modelling carbon price fundamentals. Power companies may employ marginal abatement cost curves to guide their decisions about long-term capital investment strategies to select among a variety of efficiency and generation options. Economists have used marginal abatement cost curves to explain the economics of interregional carbon trading. Policy- makers use marginal abatement cost curves as merit order curves, to analyze how much abatement can be done in an economy at what cost, and where policy should be directed to achieve the emission reductions. However, marginal abatement cost curves should not be used as abatement supply curves (or merit order curves) to decide which measures to implement in order to achieve a given emission-reduction target. Indeed, the options they list would take decades to implement, and it may be optimal to implement expensive but high- potential measures before introducing cheaper measures. Criticism The way that marginal abatement cost curves are usually built has been criticized for lack of transparency and the poor treatment it makes of uncertainty, inter- temporal dynamics, interactions between sectors and ancillary benefits. There is also concern regarding the biased ranking that occurs if some included options have negative costs. Examples of existing marginal abatement cost curves Various economists, research organizations, and consultancies have produced marginal abatement cost curves.

It is an herbaceous bulbous perennial, growing to tall by , with strap-shaped leaves and large umbels of lily-like pink flowers in late summer and autumn. The common names of the species are Cornish lily, Cape flower, Guernsey lily, and Bowden lily. However, it is neither a true lily nor from Cornwall or Guernsey, but originates from South Africa (Eastern Cape, KwaZulu Natal, Free State, Drakensberg Mountains). Confusingly the name ‚ÄúGuernsey lily‚Äù is also applied to a related species, Nerine sarniensis. The species was named in 1904 after Athelstan Cornish-Bowden who had sent bulbs of the plant to England from South Africa. Description N. bowdenii bulbs are in circumference. The bulbs are \\"shaped like old-fashioned Chianti bottles\\". The plant has eight or more faintly-scented bright pink flowers with frilly tips, resembling finely- cut lilies. Because the leaves do not appear until spring, the species can tolerate lower temperatures than most species in the genus Nerine. Cultivation Nerine bowdenii is widely cultivated in temperate regions, where it requires warmth and shelter in colder areas, but is quite hardy, being able to withstand temperatures of . It needs to be planted where it cannot be disturbed for several years, and blooms best when the bulbs are crowded. The species grows best in heat and well-drained soil. However, it will not tolerate tropical or very humid weather. It is suggested that colchicums and cyclamens are good choices of companion plants to grow with this species. This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Biochemistry The bulbs of Nerine bowdenii contain ungeremine, a betaine-type alkaloid, and a number of other alkaloids. Ungeremine is an inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase, and as such may be of interest in research into treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Ungeremine also has been isolated from a number of related plant species, such as Ungernia minor, Ungernia spiralis, Zephyranthes flava, Crinum asiaticum, Crinum augustum, Pancratium maritimum and Hippeastrum solandriflorum. Diseases The plant virus, vallota mosaic virus, has been found to infect Nerine bowdenii and other members of the genus Nerine in the UK.

It has rough, fibrous or flaky bark on the trunk and branches, lance-shaped to curved adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, white flowers and conical fruit. Description Eucalyptus quadrangulata is a tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has rough, greyish brown, fibrous or flaky bark on the trunk and branches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have stems that are square in cross-section and leaves that are arranged in opposite pairs and sessile with their bases surrounding the stem. The juvenile leaves are lance-shaped, paler on the lower surface, long and wide. Adult leaves are the same shade of glossy green on both sides, lance-shaped to curved, long and wide, tapering to a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds usually sessile. Mature buds are oval to spindle-shaped, long and about wide with a conical operculum. Flowering occurs from February to March and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody, conical capsule long and wide with the valves below the level of the rim. Taxonomy Eucalyptus quadrangulata was first formally described in 1899 by Henry Deane and Joseph Maiden in Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales.

It ceased business in the 1980s. The company was revived in 1996 by Mark Westrom. The idea of entering the small arms industry caught the interest of then-company president Richard Boutelle at Fairchild Engine and Airplane Corporation, and Armalite was incorporated as a division of Fairchild on October 1, 1954. Their first design, the AR1 Parasniper from 1952, used foam-filled fiberglass furniture and a composite barrel using a steel liner inside an aluminum sleeve. This was little used, but when they were asked to compete in a contest for an aircrew survival rifle their AR-5 and AR-7 designs from 1956 saw production use. This was followed by an invitation to compete for the new combat rifle for US forces, which led to the AR-10. The AR-10 lost the 1957 contest, but many of its ideas were reused in the smaller and lighter AR-15. Tired of repeated failures in the market, Fairchild licensed the AR-10 and AR-15 designs to Colt, and the AR-10 to a Dutch company. Fairchild sold its interest in Armalite in 1962. That year, Colt sold the AR-15 to the United States Air Force to arm base security troops. Commercial models were then sent to Special Forces in Vietnam, who reported success using the weapon. This led to its being adopted as the Army's main combat rifle starting in 1964. Officially designated Rifle, Caliber 5.56 mm, M16, it remained the US's primary combat rifle in one form or another to October 2016, however it is in the process of being phased out by other weapon systems, notably the M27-IAR and is expected to be out of service by the mid 2030s. It has been adopted by many NATO countries in the 1980s. Armalite had further brushes with success, especially with the ArmaLite AR-18. These were not enough to keep the company going, and they ceased operations in the early 1980s.Pikula, Sam (Major), The Armalite AR-10, p. 92 The design rights and name were purchased in 1996 by Mark Westrom, who re-launched the company Armalite, Inc., now headquartered in Geneseo, Illinois. In 2013, Westrom sold Armalite, Inc. to Strategic Armory Corps, who also owns AWC Silencers, Surgeon Rifles, Nexus Ammo, and McMillan Firearms. Strategic Armory Corps was formed with the goal of acquiring and combining market-leading companies within the firearms industry. In 2014, 3-Gun Champion Tommy Thacker was appointed president. In 2015, Armalite introduced 18 new products including AR-10 and M-15 platform firearms. In mid 2018, Armalite was relocated to Phoenix Arizona. History Armalite began as a small arms engineering concern founded by George Sullivan, the patent counsel for Lockheed Corporation, and funded by Fairchild Engine and Airplane Corporation.Pikula, Sam (Major), The Armalite AR-10, pp. 23‚Äì26 After leasing a small machine shopPikula, p. 25: The workshop on Santa Monica occupied only 1000 square feet, and was referred to as 'George's backyard garage' by employees. at 6567 Santa Monica Boulevard in Hollywood, California, Sullivan hired several employees and began work on a prototype for a lightweight survival rifle for use by downed aircrew. On October 1, 1954, the company was incorporated as the Armalite Corporation, becoming a subdivision of Fairchild. With its limited capital and tiny machine shop, Armalite was never intended to be an arms manufacturer. Armalite was instead focused on producing small arms concepts and designs to be sold or licensed to other manufacturers. While testing the prototype of Armalite's survival rifle design at a local shooting range, Sullivan met Eugene Stoner, a talented small arms inventor, whom Sullivan immediately hired to be Armalite's chief design engineer. Stoner was a Marine in World War II and an expert with small arms. Since the early 1950s, he had been working at a variety of jobs while building gun prototypes in his spare time. At the time, Armalite Inc. was a very small organization (as late as 1956 it had only nine employees, including Stoner). With Stoner as chief design engineer, Armalite quickly released a number of interesting rifle concepts.Pikula, Sam (Major), The Armalite AR-10, pp. 30-36 The first Armalite concept to be adopted for production was the AR-5, a survival rifle chambered for the .22 Hornet cartridge. The AR-5 was adopted by the U.S. Air Force as the MA-1 Survival Rifle. A civilian survival weapon, the AR-7, was later introduced, chambered in .22 Long Rifle. The semi-automatic AR-7, like the AR-5, could be disassembled, and the components stored in the buttstock. Primarily made of alloys, the AR-7 would float, whether assembled or stored, due to the design of the buttstock, which was filled with plastic foam. The AR-7 and derivative models have been produced by several companies since introduction in the late 1950s, currently by Henry Repeating Arms, of Bayonne, New Jersey, and the rifle is still popular today. Most of Armalite's time and engineering effort in 1955 and 1956 was spent in developing the prototypes for what would become the ArmaLite AR-10. Based on Stoner's fourth prototype, two hand-built production AR-10s were tested by the Springfield Armory in late 1956 and again in 1957 as a possible replacement to the venerable yet outdated M1 Garand. The untested AR-10 faced competition from the two other major rifle designs, the Springfield Armory T-44, an updated M1 Garand design that became the M14, and the T-48, a version of the famous Belgian FN FAL rifle. Both the T-44 and the T-48 had a lead of several years over the AR-10 in development and trials testing; the T-44 had the additional advantage of being an in-house Springfield Armory design.Pikula, Sam (Major), The Armalite AR-10, pp. 39-40 The Army eventually selected the T-44 over both the AR-10 and the T-48. Armalite continued to market the AR-10 based on a limited production of rifles at their Hollywood facility. These limited-production, virtually hand-built rifles are referred to today as the \\"Hollywood\\" model AR-10.Pikula, Sam (Major), The Armalite AR-10, pp. 29, 31 In 1957, Fairchild/Armalite sold a five-year manufacturing license for the AR-10 to the Dutch arms manufacturer 'Artillerie Inrichtingen (AI). Converting the AR-10 engineering drawings to metric, AI found the Hollywood version of the AR-10 deficient in a number of respects, and made a number of significant design and engineering changes in the AR-10 that continued throughout the production run in the Netherlands. Firearms historians have separated AR-10 production under the AI license into three identifiable versions of the AR-10: the \\"Sudanese\\" model, the \\"Transitional\\", and the \\"Portuguese\\" model AR-10. The Sudanese version derives its name from its sale to the Government of Sudan, which purchased approximately 2,500 AR-10 rifles, while the Transitional model incorporated additional design changes based on experience with the Sudanese model in the field. The final AI-produced AR-10, the Portuguese, was a product-improved variant sold to the Portuguese Air Force for use by paratroopers.Pikula, Sam (Major), The Armalite AR-10, p. 78 While AR-10 production at AI dwarfed that of Armalite's Hollywood shop, it was still limited, as sales to foreign armies proved elusive. Guatemala, Burma, Italy, Cuba, Sudan and Portugal all purchased AR-10 rifles for limited issue to their military forces,Pikula, Sam (Major), The Armalite AR-10, p. 45Pikula, Sam (Major), The Armalite AR-10, p. 72,73Pikula, Sam (Major), The Armalite AR-10, p. 75 resulting in a total production of less than 10,000 AR-10 rifles in four years. It appears that none of the design changes and product improvements made by AI were ever transmitted to or adopted by Armalite. Disappointed with AR-10 sales, Fairchild Armalite decided to terminate its association with Artillerie Inrichtingen and instead concentrated on producing a small-caliber version of the AR-10 to meet a requirement for the U.S. Air Force. Using the Hollywood- produced AR-10, the prototype was downsized in dimensions to accept the .223 Remington (5.56 mm) cartridge.Pikula, Sam (Major), The Armalite AR-10, p. 88 This resulted in the ArmaLite AR-15, designed by Eugene Stoner, Jim Sullivan, and Bob Fremont, and chambered in 5.56 mm caliber. Armalite also re-introduced the AR-10, this time using a design derived from the original Hollywood prototypes of 1956, and designated the AR-10A. Unable to produce either rifle in quantity, Armalite was forced to license both designs to Colt in early 1959. That same year, Armalite moved its corporate offices and engineering and production shop to new premises at 118 East 16th Street in Costa Mesa, California.Pikula, Sam (Major), The Armalite AR-10, p. 90 Frustrated by what it perceived as unnecessary production delays at AI, and poor AR-10 sales, Fairchild decided not to renew Artillerie Inrichtingen's license to produce the AR-10. In 1962, disappointed with Armalite's meagre profits, largely derived from licensing fees, Fairchild dissolved its association with Armalite. With the AR-10 and AR-15 designs sold to Colt, Armalite was left without a viable major infantry arm to market to potential manufacturers and end users. Armalite next developed a series of less expensive new rifle designs in 7.62 mm and 5.56 mm. The 7.62 mm NATO rifle was designated the AR-16. The AR-16 and the other newly designed Armalites utilized a more traditional gas piston design along with stamped and welded steel construction in place of aluminum forgings. Due to the success of the FN FAL, H&K; G3, and the US M14, the 7.62 mm AR-16 (not to be confused with the M16) was produced only in prototype quantities. Another Armalite project was the AR-17, a two- shot autoloading shotgun based on the short-recoil principle and featuring a weight of only 5.5 pounds thanks to its aluminum and plastic construction; only about 1,200 were ever produced.Hahn, Nick, The 'Other' Autoloaders, Gun Digest 2011, 65th ed., F+W Media (2010), p. 69 In 1963, development began on the AR-18 rifle, a \\"downsized\\" 5.56 mm AR-16 with a new gas system utilizing a short stroke gas piston instead of the Stoner direct gas impingement system used on the AR-10 and AR-15. Designed by Art Miller, the AR-18 was accompanied by a semi-automatic version, the AR-180. However, the sales success of the AR-15 worldwide to the U.S. military and other nations proved the undoing of the AR-18, and the latter failed to garner substantial orders. In response to criticism of the rifle's performance in trials by the military in the United States and Great Britain, a few minor improvements were made to the original design, but little else was done. Armalite manufactured some AR-18 and AR-180 rifles at its Costa Mesa facility and later licensed production to Howa Machinery Co. in Japan. However, Japan was prohibited under its laws from selling military-style arms to combative nations, and with the United States involved in the Vietnam war, production at the Howa plant was limited. Armalite then licensed production to Sterling Armaments in Dagenham, Great Britain. Sales remained modest. Today, the AR-180 is best known for its use by the Provisional Irish Republican Army in Ireland, who received small quantities of the rifle from black market sources. The AR-18 gas system and rotating bolt mechanism did serve as the basis for the current British small arms family, the SA80, which came from the XL65 which is essentially an AR-18 in bullpup configuration. Other designs, such as the Singapore SAR-80 and German G36, are based upon the AR-18. A derivative of the AR-18 was the AR-100 series. It came in four variants: the closed-bolt AR-101 assault rifle and AR-102 carbine, and the open-bolt fired AR-103 carbine and AR-104 light machine gun with ejecting magazines. The weapon was intended to increase firepower of a squad as well as mobility. It was never adopted; however, it led to the Ultimax 100. By the 1970s, Armalite had essentially stopped all new rifle development, and the company effectively ceased operations. In 1983 Armalite was sold to Elisco Tool Manufacturing Company, of the Philippines. The AR-18 tooling at the Costa Mesa shop went to the Philippines, while some of the remaining Armalite employees acquired the remaining inventory of parts for the AR-17 and AR-18. Resurrection of the Armalite brand Armalite AR-10B After passing through a series of owners, the Armalite brand name and rampant lion logo was sold in 1996 to Mark Westrom, a former U.S. Army Ordnance officer and inventor of a 7.62 NATO sniper rifle based on the design concepts of Eugene Stoner. The company resumed business as Armalite Inc. Today, Armalite produces a number of AR-15 and AR-10-based rifles, as well as .50 BMG rifles (the AR-50), and a modified AR-180 named the AR-180B (discontinued in 2009). In the mid-2000s, Armalite had also announced that they are introducing a handgun line including the AR-24 and AR-26 (both pistols also discontinued). In 2013, Westrom sold Armalite, Inc. to Strategic Armory Corps, who also owns AWC Silencers, Surgeon Rifles, Nexus Ammo, and McMillan Firearms. Strategic Armory Corps was formed with the goal of acquiring and combining market-leading companies within the firearms industry.

S. Gilbert Poster The Japanese Village in Knightsbridge, London, was a late Victorian era exhibition of Japanese culture located in Humphreys' Hall, which took place from January 1885 until June 1887. The exhibition employed around 100 Japanese men and women in a setting built to resemble a traditional Japanese village. Description The exhibition was a commercial venture organised by Tannaker Buhicrosan (1839‚Äì1894),\\"Buhicrosan, Tannaker, 1839‚Äì1894\\", Library of Congress, accessed 19 September 2020 who had been organising travelling Japanese exhibitions in Britain for several years beforehand. As a result of the opening up of Japan to trade with Britain in the 1850s, an English craze for all things Japanese had built through the 1860s and 1870s, fed by the British perception of Japan as a mediaeval culture. This resonated particularly with devotees of the Aesthetic movement of the late nineteenth century and made the exhibition very popular,Jones, pp. 688‚Äì93 with over 250,000 visitors during its early months.British history online, 'Knightsbridge Green Area: Scotch Corner and the High Road', Survey of London: volume 45: Knightsbridge (2000), pp. 79-88 The exhibition was built to resemble a traditional Japanese village, completely contained within Humphreys' Hall (which was south of Knightsbridge and east of what is now Trevor Street). It employed around 100 Japanese men and women, and included segregated sleeping accommodation. According to advertisements placed in the Illustrated London News, > \\"Skilled Japanese artisans and workers (male and female) will illustrate the > manners, customs, and art-industries of their country, attired in their > national and picturesque costumes. Magnificently decorated and illuminated > Buddhist temple. Five o‚Äôclock tea in the Japanese tea-house. Japanese > Musical and other Entertainments. Every-day Life as in Japan\\".An > advertisement from the Illustrated London News, 3 January 1885, quoted in > McLaughlin, para 10. While Gilbert and Sullivan were writing their opera The Mikado (1885), W. S. Gilbert visited the exhibition and engaged Japanese people from the village to teach his cast aspects of Japanese behaviour. In May 1885, the hall burnt down overnight and one of the Japanese employees was killed in the blaze. However Mr Buhicrosan immediately announced that the hall and the exhibit would be rebuilt as quickly as possible. As it happened the exhibit employees were already committed to visit Berlin and appear at the 1885 International Hygiene Exhibition in Berlin. They proceeded to fulfill the engagement. Meanwhile, the hall and the village exhibit were both reconstructed and the exhibition re- opened to the public in December 1885 with \\"several streets of shops ... two temples and various free-standing idols, and a pool spanned by a rustic bridge\\".\\"Knightsbridge Green Area: Scotch Corner and the High Road: The Japanese Native Village\\", in Survey of London: Volume 45, Knightsbridge, ed.

Considered the concluding album of his remarkable 1970s run, it was the last album he would record for seven years. The album is very different in tone from its predecessor and revives Newbury's talent for song suites with \\"The Sailor/Song of Sorrow/Let's Say Goodbye One More Time\\". Other highlights on the album include \\"That Was The Way It Was Then\\" and \\"Over the Mountain\\". After All These Years was collected for CD issue on the eight-disc Mickey Newbury Collection from Mountain Retreat, Newbury's own label in the mid-1990s, along with nine other Newbury albums from 1969‚Äì1981.  Recording and composition  After All These Years was recorded in producer's Norbert Putnam's 1875 mansion the Bennett House In Franklin, Tennessee. After the glossy production of Newbury's last album The Sailor, After All These Years was a return of sorts to the orchestrated melodies and haunting song suites of his earlier albums. \\"The Sailor\\", which had been left off its namesake album, features a harrowingly darker sound that hearkens back to Newbury's earlier work, \\"painted with broad strokes and with metaphorical allusions to heaven, hell, and earth.\\" For the most part, the songs contained on the LP speak to a longing for the old days, but with more optimism than on Newbury's Frisco Mabel Joy album, which explored the same theme. Newbury biographer Joe Ziemer contends \\"Let's Say Goodbye One More Time\\" and \\"That Was The Way It Was Then\\" are \\"sincere offerings of the heart of a card-carrying romantic.\\"  Reception  AllMusic gave After All These Years four out of five stars, with reviewer Thom Jurek stating: \\"Somehow from the vastness of the sea expressed in the suite's first song to the individual sitting alone in a room at night staring at a clock, we find the spectrum of human regret and grief. These songs -- most of them country songs although there is a strangely wonderful country- rock ballad called 'Truly Blue' -- reveal for the first time Newbury's sense that he may have wasted his career.\\"  Track listing  All tracks by Mickey Newbury except where noted # \\"The Sailor\\" ‚Äì 5:21 # \\"Song of Sorrow\\" ‚Äì 3:22 # \\"Let's Say Goodbye One More Time\\" ‚Äì 3:35 # \\"That Was the Way It Was Then\\" ‚Äì 2:41 # \\"Country Boy Saturday Night\\" ‚Äì 3:27 # \\"Truly Blue\\" ‚Äì 3:41 # \\"Just as Long as That Someone Is You\\" ‚Äì 3:26 # \\"Over the Mountain\\" (Newbury, Joe Henry) ‚Äì 3:26 # \\"Catchers in the Rye\\" ‚Äì 2:52 # \\"I Still Love You (After All These Years)\\" ‚Äì 3:27  Personnel  * Steve Brantley ‚Äì vocals * Bruce Dees ‚Äì vocals * Gene Eichelberger ‚Äì engineer * Steve Gibson ‚Äì guitar * Jon Goin ‚Äì guitar * David Hungate ‚Äì bass * Shane Keister ‚Äì piano * Sheldon Kurland ‚Äì strings * Dave Loggins ‚Äì guitar, vocals * Mike Manna ‚Äì piano * Terry McMillan ‚Äì harmonica * Weldon Myrick ‚Äì steel guitar * Mickey Newbury ‚Äì guitar, vocals * Bobby Ogdin ‚Äì piano * Norbert Putnam ‚Äì guitar * Cindy Reynolds ‚Äì harp * Buddy Spicher ‚Äì fiddle * James Stroud ‚Äì drums * Jack Williams ‚Äì bass  References  ;Citations ;Bibliography * Category:Mickey Newbury albums Category:1981 albums Category:Mercury Records albums ","title":"After All These Years (Mickey Newbury album)"},{"id":"26128002","text":"The Polic√≠a de Investigaciones del Per√∫ or Peruvian Investigative Police (PIP) was a Peruvian plainclothes police unit, similar to the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which was meant to investigate crimes, gather intelligence, and fight subversion.

Early life Pugh was born on Turk's Island (Caicos group), part of the British West Indies as son of a Wesleyan minister. Pugh came to Brisbane from London in 1855. Journalist and publisher Pugh is well known in Queensland history honoured as the a journalist and public servant and as the publisher of the still frequently used Pugh's Almanac of Queensland. Yet the conspiracy of silence on all matters dealing with Aboriginal rights meant that Pugh was never credited for his editorial campaign in the Brisbane Courier for Aboriginal rights and against Queensland's infamous frontier force the Native Police Force in the years 1860 to 1861. Pugh's biographers mentions his contribution as a political journalist and as publisher of Pugh's Almanac and critical stands in regards to the kanaka trade but not one word about his crucial role in connection to the editorial campaign against the native police in 1860‚Äì61 and the Select Committee of 1861. He was also the first publisher of the Queensland Government Gazette from 1861 to 1863.Australian Dictionary of Biography 1851‚Äì1890; Moreton Bay Courier & Brisbane Courier 1859‚Äì61; Brisbane Courier 22 June 1926.

He had attained the age of 65 years. Mr. Pugh was born at Turk's Island (Caicos group) in 1831. After being educated at Old Kingswood School, near Bristol, and at Wesley College, Taunton, he served a short apprenticeship as a printer, and then joined the \\"Southern Times\\" at Weymouth. Subsequently he was connected with the \\"Mirror\\" at Salisbury, and the \\"Herald\\" at Swansea. Emigrating to Australia, he arrived at Moreton Bay in June 1855. Continuing his Press career, he for a time acted as correspondent to the Empire of Sydney. He became editor of the Moreton Bay Free Press in 1855, and occupied the editorial chair of that newspaper for four years, in 1859 he was appointed editor of the \\"Moreton Bay Courier,\\" then a bi-weekly publication, which was shortly afterwards published three times a week, and daily from May 1861. After leaving what is now the \\"Brisbane Courier\\" in 1863, Mr. Pugh was identified with various journalistic ventures, and when the Brisbane \\"Telegraph\\" was started in 1872, Mr. Pugh was its first editor, a position which he retained for slightly over a year. \\"Pugh's Moreton Bay Almanac\\" appeared in sheet form at the close of 1857, and in book size the following year. In 1860 the scope of the almanac ‚Äì or, rather, directory ‚Äì was enlarged, and came out as \\"Pugh's Queensland Almanac,\\" and its publication has been continued yearly ever since by various publishers. Mr. Pugh was closely identified with the movement for obtaining the separation of Queensland from New South Wales, and from 1857 to 1859 acted as secretary of the committee. Until the appointment of a Government printer, he was the publisher of the Government Gazette.In 1863 he was elected to represent the Town of Brisbane in the second Parliament of Queensland. He was re-elected in 1867, and became Chairman of Committees. An election taking place in the following year, Mr. Pugh again secured the confidence of the electors, but almost immediately, thereafter he retired from Parliamentary life. Mr. Pugh entered the civil service, and was appointed Police Magistrate at Goondiwindi in 1874. He afterwards filled similar positions at Rockhampton, Warwick, Bundaberg, and Beenleigh, and latterly at Nanango, Mr. Pugh, at the time of his death, was a patient in a private hospital at Toowoomba.

Biography  Vercel was fascinated by the sea and marine life. Although he virtually never went to sea, most of his novels featured a maritime setting. World War I interrupted his studies of letters. Early in the war his poor eyesight left him a stretcher-bearer on the battlefields of northern and eastern France. Because of a shortage of army officers, he returned to Saint-Cyr. He ended the war on the eastern front, and was discharged a year after the Armistice. He returned to Dinan, where in 1921 he was appointed professor at the College of Letters. He earned a doctorate in letters in 1927, with a thesis entitled: \\"The images in the work of Corneille\\". The Acad√©mie fran√ßaise awarded it the Saintour prize of literary history. Dinan extinguished it in 1957. His war memories inspired some of his earlier books: Our Father Trajan, Captain Conan, Lena, but the maritime world makes up the heart of his work. Off Eden earned him the Prix Femina from the France-America Committee in 1932. He won the Prix Goncourt in 1934 for Capitaine Conan.

The film gained some recognition due to James Rolfe slyly promoting the film in a top 10 video he produced the same year the film was released. This is due to his friendship with von Manahan, the filmmaker. Plot At the dawn of his quarter-life crisis, Caleb Callahan (Jeremy Luno) returns home to Bucks County after recently dropping out of college. Upon his return, he discovers a note from his lifelong friends Montag (Michael Hampton) and Swank (Nikitas Manikatos) to meet and catch up on old times. Montag, an eccentric man-child and serial prankster, requests that Caleb joins him and Swank on one of his many schemes. After seeing his old bandana mask from his pranking days with the two, Caleb agrees to join them. Caleb, dressed in cape and mask, distracts the Washington Elementary School's noon aids and causes bedlam among the students with a soapbox speech on recess grounds. Meanwhile, Montag and Swank discover a map that leads to an old time capsule after randomly searching the principal's office. Caleb (having escaped from the noon aids‚Äô clutches), return inside the school to return an old overdue library book, When the Leaves Fall. He hears music, following it to the school's music room to find Cole (Mackenzie Firgens) playing piano, he's speechless by her presence. The trio are immediately confronted by Cole's father, the principal of the Washington Elementary, but they escape his clutches and their scheme a success. Later that night at Sherrwood Tavern, Caleb and Swank go out for drinks and darts. Caleb, an avid darts player, shows Swank how to play, only to be disrupted by Officer Scar (Jeff Berg), Caleb's old nemesis. Scar, the dart champion of Sherrwood, prevents them from further playing, who nightly guards the area by the dartboard to prevent possible rivals at the game. As they leave, Caleb runs into Cole, who runs a nighttime taxi service to prevent drunks from roaming the streets. Cole playfully informs Caleb that she has his book (left behind after his confrontation with her father), and Caleb responds by saying he‚Äôll call her tomorrow. While Montag discusses his next scheme with Caleb and Swank at the park, Montag gets into a fight with his long-time rival, the obnoxious Tanner (Billy Tanner) after being loudly insulted by him. Meanwhile, Caleb sees James Paddington (Paul Gleason), the county's gubernatorial candidate, discussing to a crowd of potential voters the history of the Revolutionary War and the town's history behind it. Caleb argues with Paddington that Washington's attack on the British was considered cheating for fighting on Christmas. After Paddington publicly berates Montag and Swank before the crowd, Caleb says out of all the pranks Montag has done in the past, their upcoming scheme against Paddington is the one he can truly agree on. At 2:00 a.m., Montag and Swank hide on a stakeout by Caleb's house where they are interrogated by Scar. Scar informs Montag that he knows that he was behind the trespassing at Washington Elementary, and warns that the next scheme they concoct, he will intervene. Caleb and Cole begin seeing each other more and more and eventually become lovers, much to Montag's annoyance. Caleb introduces Cole to Montag and Swank so they can get to know her, but Scar intervenes, revealing to Caleb that he had a relationship with Cole before him, reveling in Caleb's anger at this revelation. Caleb, Cole and the others return to Sherrwood Tavern for drinks and darts where they again run into Scar, who prevents them from further playing. Cole insults Scar by proclaiming that Caleb will take his dart champion title from him. They play a single match, with Scar being victorious. When Cole asks Caleb about his history with Scar and of the diamond shaped scar on his cheek, Caleb refuses to answer, considering the inquiry to be rude. As Caleb leaves for the restroom, Swank reveals to Cole their history with Scar dating back from high school. Montag challenged Scar and his crew to a basketball match, only to lose miserably. As Scar reveled in his victory, Montag shoved Scar, only to receive a beating in retaliation. Caleb defends Montag by throwing a garbage can at Scar, the impact pushed Scar's face against a wire fence and ripped a bloody diamond shaped mark into his left cheek. Humiliated, Scar swears vengeance against Caleb and his friends and disappears. Wintertime, Caleb and Cole meets up with Montag at the site of Paddington Brothers Construction, where Montag plans on leaving upper deckers in every master bathroom on the block. Caleb refuses to go along with the scheme and leaves with Cole. Cole confronts Caleb, who plans on ducking out of a date to join Montag and Swank with Operation: Sorbet, a scheme where they dig up their old elementary school's time capsule and replace the capsule's contents with pornography. Caleb explains that he tries to keep a balance between his relationship with Cole and his friendship with Montag, but Cole explains that it's not good enough and gives Caleb an ultimatum: either not follow through with Montag's ongoing schemes or their relationship ends. Caleb backs out of Operation: Sorbet, and Montag is forced to hire the inexperienced Simon (Brett Jacobsen) to proceed with the prank. Scar foils Montag's plans (while Tanner further humiliates Montag and Swank with water balloons) and beats him mercilessly. Operation: Sorbet ends in failure. Caleb later meets up with Montag at his current residence (their childhood tree house) finding him defeated and demoralized by Operation: Sorbet's failure. Caleb apologies for bailing out of him and proclaims his full involvement with Montag's next upcoming scheme. Montag, Caleb and Swank plan on sabotaging Paddington's annual reenactment of Washington Crossing of the Delaware as Native Americans. The trio attack Paddington's crew with jousting cardboard tubes, while Montag swipes Paddington's costume wig of George Washington, claiming it as his prize. Montag trips as he tries to escape, falling victim to Paddington's impending attack with a replica saber. Caleb quickly disables Paddington with a throwing dart before he can attack Montag and falls in the icy Delaware. The next day after their victory celebration, Caleb discovers that a bounty has been placed on him after a picture of him (in disguise) is shown disarming Paddington. Caleb is distraught, but Montag reassures him that his identity will remain safe. Meanwhile, Scar, who still harbors feelings for Cole, deliberately gets drunk at Sherrwood Tavern and calls her for a ride home. During the ride, Scar reveals to Cole photographic evidence of Caleb's involvement in the Reenactment sabotage, where he will reveal them to the authorities unless Cole has sex with him. Cole and Scar engage in the act in her car, and Cole becomes in sole possession of the photos, proclaiming to Scar that she's doing this because she loves Caleb. Montag runs into Cole while she tears up in her car, revealing that he knows about the affair. Later at Sherrwood Tavern, Paddington, having recovered from his injuries, announces the tavern's annual dart championship tournament, where the winner of the tournament gets a prize pack, including debt-free rights from the tavern. Paddington believes that the dart thrower who injured him will attend the tournament, and he will be able to catch him and arrest him for the assault during the Reenactment. Scar thanks Cole for the ride home from the tavern earlier and requests another ride. Through heavy implication, Scar reveals to Caleb of Cole having sex with him. Caleb is angry at Cole's actions, but understands the reasons behind it. Caleb later visits Montag, who is busy cleaning up his tree house after it burned down sometime earlier from an accidental electrical fire. Caleb asks Montag for advice on how to get back at Scar, Montag answers by beating him at the dart tournament. He goads Caleb into regaining his confidence in his dart throwing ability and Caleb enters the tournament in disguise. Caleb and Scar make it to the finals, where Caleb narrowly beats Scar and claims the title of champion. His throwing darts match the same one used by during the Reenactment, and Caleb is promptly arrested by Paddington. However, Montag exonerates Caleb with a signed confession of his involvement of the scheme and delivers Paddington the wig stolen from him, claiming that Paddington doesn‚Äôt have enough valid evidence to lock Caleb away. Enraged, Scar attacks Caleb with a pool cue, but Montag defends him with his own pool cue, claiming that Scar's anger has always been towards him, not Caleb. Scar overpowers Montag, and before he delivers the final blow, Swank hits from behind with a pool cue of his own, giving him a second scar and knocking him unconscious. Springtime, Montag visits Caleb at Sherrwood Tavern, where he reveals that he's chosen self-exile from Bucks County over jail time thanks to an old county law. Montag plans on returning to Bucks County one day by running for county commissioner, despite his lack of political experience. He says his goodbyes and Caleb takes over Montag's role as serial prankster of Bucks County.

He is also remembered as an excellent striker, being the sixth all-time pre-1941 Yugoslav First League top-scorer, with a total of 51 goals. Having been born in Raƒça Kragujevaƒçka, a suburb of Kragujevac, he still young came to Belgrade, where he played for several clubs. He started playing for Palilulac, between 1930 and 1932, and later in ƒåukariƒçki, until 1936, when he moved to one of the major clubs in the country, SK Jugoslavija. He will play with them until 1943, becoming one of the major league strikers and a fans idol. Those were his best years in which he also became a member of the national team. All the success was interrupted by an unfortunate injury of the meniscus that would make him pause for entire three years! He never fully recovered, despite having returned and played four seasons with FK Vojvodina, between 1945 and 1949, and a single season with FK ≈Ωeljezniƒçar Sarajevo where despite the difficulties, and his age, he managed to score 8 goals in 14 matches.

The release was supported by singles \\"Rules Don't Stop,\\" released on April 5, 2010, and \\"Nice Guys,\\" released June 7, 2010. Following the band's split from EMI/Virgin in November 2009, the record was released by PIAS Recordings in the United Kingdom. Background and recording In March 2008, We Are Scientists released its second studio album Brain Thrust Mastery through EMI Records. It was a moderate commercial success, and charted at number eleven on the UK Albums Chart. Some critics dismissed the album as inconsistent and a let down when compared to the band's 2005 debut With Love and Squalor. Dom Gourlay of Drowned in Sound in particular wrote: \\"Brain Thrust Mastery was a largely forgettable experience ... it reeked of a record overshadowed by record company interference whose ultimate aim was instant payback via radio playlisting and that all-important monster hit\\". We Are Scientists lead singer Keith Murray said the band had some steep financial obligations at the time, and were advised by management to release another album quickly as to relieve themselves of these obligations. Murray also noted there was in fact some interference from EMI: Before recording Brain Thrust Mastery, longtime drummer Michael Tapper left We Are Scientists. For the next few years, the band performed with several interim drummers before settling on Andy Burrows. At the time, Burrows had left his previous band Razorlight, and the two members of We Are Scientists asked him to join the band. Murray said while he and bassist Chris Cain had become great friends through touring, the duo never felt like a true band. According to Murray: \\"Doing it with Andy it felt like a band again it felt like 3 dudes who wanted to run into a room and be loud, be crazy, and also finish up so we could go to the pub together and hang out and forget everything we had rehearsed. It was definitely rejuvenating to have him\\". Murray wrote the majority of the songs on Barbara whilst staying between a rented cottage in Athens, Georgia, and Miami Beach, Florida. Barbara was then recorded at various studios in New York City, Los Angeles and London. Rechtshaid produced the album, while Dana Nielsen and Mike Boden served as the engineers. The recording sessions for Barbara proved difficult for the band members, as they dealt with what Cain described as \\"a lot of label-juggling, a lot of management juggling\\". Promotion and release During January 2010, the band played in support of the new album on their \\"Big Fuckin‚Äô Deal Tour\\", performing three small shows in Washington, D.C., Philadelphia and New Jersey, with temporary drummer Danny Lee Allen (of Youth Group). The dates were the band's first live performances since appearing at the All Points West Music & Arts Festival on August 2, 2009. In an interview prior to the Washington date, bassist Chris Cain stated \\"I think May is looking like a fairly solid release time, although we don‚Äôt have an actual week yet\\", as well as describing it poppy and hook-laden. Cain also confirmed that the band had parted with their record label in November 2009, with the record being released by various labels including PIAS Recordings in the United Kingdom. During the performance, the band played new tracks \\"Jack and Ginger\\", \\"I Don't Bite\\", \\"Nice Guys\\" and \\"Rules Don't Stop\\". On February 8, 2010, NME, Gigwise.com and The Fly announced the release of the album in June 2010. \\"Rules Don't Stop\\" was announced as the lead single, scheduled for release on April 5, 2010. As well as this, the band performed a sold-out show at London's Hoxton Bar & Grill on February 23, 2010, as part of the NME Awards Shows and to promote the album.

Genome  The genome of one strain of S. coelicolor was sequenced in 2002. It contains 8,667,507 bp, encoding 7,825 predicted genes, including over 20 gene clusters for the synthesis of known or predicted natural products.  Small noncoding RNA  Bacterial small RNAs are involved in post-transcriptional regulation. Using deep sequencing S. coelicolor transcriptome was analysed at the end of exponential growth. 63 small RNAs were identified. Expression of 11 of them was confirmed by Northern blot. The sRNAs were shown to be only present in Streptomyces species. sRNA scr4677 (Streptomyces coelicolor sRNA 4677) is located in the intergenic region between anti-sigma factor SCO4677 gene and a putative regulatory protein gene SCO4676. scr4677 expression requires the SCO4677 activity and scr4677 sRNA itself seem to affect the levels of the SCO4676-associated transcripts. Targets of two of S. coelicolor noncoding RNAs have been identified. Noncoding RNA of Glutamine Synthetase I was shown to modulate antibiotic production. The small RNA scr5239 (Streptomyces coelicolor sRNA upstream of SCO5239) has two targets. It inhibits agarase DagA expression by direct base pairing to the dagA coding region, and it represses translation of methionine synthase metE (SCO0985) at the 5' end of its open reading frame.

He represented and captained both the England national rugby union team and the British Lions in the 1950s and 1960s. He subsequently became a sports administrator and Chairman of the Sports Council. He was appointed CBE in 1977.\\"Who's Who 1998\\", Published by A&C; Black Limited, 1998 Biography Richard Eric Gautrey Jeeps was born on 25 November 1931 in Chesterton (England). He was educated at Bedford Modern School. Jeeps played scrum half 24 times for England including all four matches of the Grand Slam season of 1957. Jeeps was selected to join the British Lions party to tour South Africa in 1955 and is one of that select group of players capped for the British Lions before being capped by his country. Jeeps felt that his selection for the Lions was due to playing an invitation match with Cliff Morgan in Cornwall shortly before the Lions party was announced. \\"I think Cliff got me in the party because he liked my service.\\" Despite being originally the third choice scrum half in the 1955 squad, he played in all four tests of the drawn series. He was also selected for the 1959 British Lions tour to Australia and New Zealand and the 1962 British Lions tour to South Africa, bringing his Lions test appearances to 13, a record at the time. Only Willie John McBride has represented the Lions more times since. In 1959 Jeeps' ability to serve up decent possession from apparently any angle led New Zealanders to dub him \\"the India-rubber Man\\". They also rated him the most complete footballer of the Lions' backs, high praise indeed when the Lions party included Bev Risman, David Hewitt, Tony O'Reilly, Peter Jackson and Ken Scotland. In 1962 the South Africans also rated him amongst the best of the visiting backs, although this time he caught the eye as much for his astute marshalling of his pack as for skill as an instigator of flashing attacks. He captained the Lions in the final test. Jeeps played his first match for England in 1956 and his last in 1962. He captained England 13 times with a captaincy record of played 13, won five, drawn four, lost four. His twenty-four caps remained a record for an England scrum-half for twenty years, until Steve Smith surpassed it. In later life Jeeps was President of the Rugby Football Union in 1976-77 and Chairman of the Sports Council for seven years. He died on 8 October 2016 at the age of 84.

It is the only member of genus Vargula to inhabit Japanese waters; all other members of its genus inhabit the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean Sea, and waters off the coast of California. V. hilgendorfii was formerly more common, but its numbers have fallen significantly. Description V. hilgendorfii is a small animal, only 3 millimetres long. It is nocturnal and lives in the sand at the bottom of shallow water. At night, it feeds actively. Bioluminescence V. hilgendorfii glowing The luciferin from Vargula hilgendorfii V. hilgendorfii is known for its bioluminescence. It produces a blue-coloured light by a specialized chemical reaction of the substrate luciferin and the enzyme luciferase. The luciferase enzyme consists of a 555-amino acid-long peptide with a molecular mass of 61627 u, while the luciferine vargulin has only a mass of 405.5 u. A suggested biosynthesis for vargulin divides the molecule into a tryptophan, an arginine and an isoleucine subunit. The maximum in the wavelength of the luminescence is dependent on pH and salinity of the water in which the reaction takes place. It varies between 448 and 463 nm, with the maximum being at 452 nm in sea water. The substrate oxidizes when ejected from the upper-lip gland, with luciferase as a catalyst. The reaction produces carbon dioxide, oxyluciferin, and blue light. As an intermediate, a 1,2-dioxetane ring is formed; this intermediate is also formed in reaction of other bioluminescent lifeforms and also in the chemoluminescence of glow sticks. Distribution V. hilgendorfii is indigenous to the water off the southern Japanese coast. DNA and RNA analysis indicated that V. hilgendorfii migrated slowly northward after the last ice age. The poor swimming abilities and the fact the eggs are hatched in the uterus and live young are born limit the ability to migrate. History The species was first described by Gustav Wilhelm M√ºller in 1890. He named the species after the zoologist Franz Martin Hilgendorf (1839‚Äì1904). The bioluminescence of V. hilgendorfii was a research topic for a long time; the first research dates back to the year 1917. During World War II, the Japanese army sometimes used dried sea-firefly as a light source to discreetly read maps in their dim light. In 1962, the name of the species was changed from Cypridina hilgendorfii to Vargula hilgendorfii. In 1968, Japanese scientists were able to determine the structure of the luciferin vargulin.

Life He was born in Beach Hill, County Armagh, Ireland, son of Thomas Simpson. He attended Dr. Henderson's school at Newry before continuing to Trinity College, Dublin in 1832. He graduated in 1837 and travelled on the continent. After attending a lecture in Paris by Dumas on chemistry he decided to study that subject, which he did at University College, London. In 1847 he became lecturer in chemistry at the Park Street Medical School (later Ledwich School of Medicine) in Dublin. Upon closure of that school he lectured at the Peter St. School of Medicine. He then took three years leave of absence in order to study in Germany, returned to Dublin in 1854, spent two further years in Paris and returned again in 1860. At this point he built a laboratory in his Dublin home in which he worked for the next seven years. During this early part of his life he had started making the discoveries that placed him in the first rank of chemists of his time. These included improvements in the determination of nitrogen in organic compounds, determination of the structure of polyhydric alcohols and the synthesis of Succinic and other acids from the corresponding cyanides. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in June 1862. In 1872 he was appointed Professor of Chemistry at Queen's College, Cork, a position he held until his retirement in 1892. He married Mary Martin, daughter of Samuel Martin of Loughorne, County Down. He died in London in 1902 and was buried at Fulham cemetery.

In assuming leadership of the company, Pierce transitioned the company to being a manufacturer of fine organic chemicals, giving it the PCC name in 1950. Among other advances, PCC was the first commercial manufacturer of ninhydrin for use in amino acid analysis. After the first several years, the company diversified into other products and markets. Roy Oliver succeeded Pierce as company president in 1965 (Pierce remaining affiliated with eponymous products and business units until his retirement in 1994). Under Oliver, PCC expanded its operations internationally, entering into agreements with European distributors. The company's focus began to shift in the 1970s from the manufacture of organic chemical products at scale, to research, development, and production, of high- purity reagents for biotechnology research at smaller scales‚Äîresulting in its name chance to Pierce Biotechnology (PBT). PBT became a subsidiary of Perstorp Group in the Perstorp Life Science Division, was spun off as a component of this division as Perbio Science AB, which was subsequently acquired by Fisher Scientific International in 2003. Fisher merged with Thermo Electron in 2006, bringing some former PCC and PBT product lines of Perbio Science AB under Thermo Fisher Scientific management, as brands of its \\"Thermo Scientific Pierce Protein Biology\\" division. Perstorp management In 1983, Perstorp, a Sweden-based chemical company, purchased Pierce. Perstorp was a manufacturer of chemicals, resins, plastics, and laminates. In 1985, researchers at Pierce Chemical Company, led by Paul K. Smith, published a method detailing the use of bicinchoninic acid (BCA) as a protein quantitation reagent.Smith, P.K., et al. 1985. Measurement of protein using bicinchoninic acid. Anal. Biochem. 150, 76-85 The BCA protein assay method maintains the high sensitivity and low variability among proteins associated with the Lowry protein assay, while providing increased tolerance to the presence of non-ionic detergents and buffer salts. The BCA assay has since become one of the most widely used methods of protein quantitation. Pierce was recognized for its international marketing efforts in 1990 when it received the US President's \\"E\\" Award for success in exporting. Only 24 \\"E\\" awards were presented nationwide that year. In 1995, Pierce Chemical Company introduced the patented SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate for the chemiluminescent detection of biological molecules such as antibodies or pharmaceuticals. Chemiluminescence is the emission of light that occurs when a chemical reaction (in this case, between the SuperSignal Substrate and the tagged biological molecule) yields light. Researchers preserve the light signal on X-ray film or read the signal directly using an imager. Use of chemiluminescent technology allows researchers to replace radioactive tracers for greater personal safety and much less ecological impact. The introduction of SuperSignal Substrate was one of many product introductions that propelled Pierce Chemical Company to become a leader in the areas of protein sample preparation, protein function and modification, and protein detection. The company would soon change its name to Pierce Biotechnology, Inc. to reflect its focus and expertise on these growing areas. In June 1998, Pierce's parent company, Perstorp AB, announced several organizational changes, including the establishment of the separate Perstorp Life Science Division, of which Pierce was a key player. In 1999, the Perstorp Life Science Division was spun off into its own company, Perbio Science AB. The new company was listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange O List in October 1999. Fisher Scientific and subsequent management In August 2003, Fisher Scientific International announced its intent to purchase Perbio Science AB.

In 1917, he was appointed a Professor of Law at the Ohio State University Moritz College of Law. He was a visiting professor of law at the University of Chicago Law School, Stanford Law School, and Cornell Law School. He briefly served as a special assistant in the office of the United States Attorney General in Washington, D.C., in 1920. A rising star in legal education circles, he also served briefly as Dean of the West Virginia University College of Law before being added to the faculty of the University of Pittsburgh School of Law in 1927. During this time, he served on several federal commissions, including an arbitration panel which settled a strike by 1,800 streetcar conductors in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1934. He also served on Pennsylvania Governor Gifford Pinchot's Commission on Special Planning in Industry, the Pittsburgh Regional Labor Board, and a West Virginia state commission which revised and codified that state's public statutes. NLRB service In 1935, President Franklin D. Roosevelt named Madden the first Chairman of the newly formed National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). His name had appeared on a list developed by United States Senator Robert F. Wagner and United States Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins. Madden supported the expanded powers of the NLRB; he had observed the operations of the labor clauses of the previously existing National Industrial Relations Act, which were often stymied by employer refusal to negotiate with union representatives who didn't work for them. He was later to say of this period, \\"It was all very frustrating.\\"Frederick, David C. Rugged Justice: The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and the American West, 1891-1941. Raleigh, N.C.: University of California Press, 1994, p. 203. During his time on the NLRB, Madden was often opposed by the American Federation of Labor (AFL), which believed that Madden was using the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA; the primary federal law governing labor relations in the United States) and the procedures and staff of the NLRB to favor the AFL's primary competitor, the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO).Stark, Louis. \\"Both A.F.L. and C.I.O.

The NLRB and NLRA were under intense pressure from employers, the press, Congressional Republicans, and conservative Democrats.Gross, James A. Reshaping of the National Labor Relations Board: A Study in Economics, Politics, and the Law. Albany, N.Y.: SUNY Press, 1981. From the time it was established in August 1935, management lawyers had challenged the constitutionality of the NLRA and the authority of the NLRB to act. The United States Department of Justice and NLRB legal staff wanted the Supreme Court to rule as quickly as possible on the constitutionality of the NLRA.Schlesinger, Jr., Arthur M. The Age of Roosevelt, Vol. 2: The Coming of the New Deal. Paperback ed. New York: Mariner Books, 2003. (Originally published 1958.) But the Board and Justice Department also realized that the Court's Lochner era legal philosophy made it unlikely that the Court would uphold the Act.Chasse, J. Dennis. \\"John R. Commons and His Students: The View From the End of the Twentieth Century.\\" In The Institutionalist Tradition in Labor Economics. Dell P. Champlin and Janet T. Knoedler, eds. Armonk, N.Y.: M.E.

Subsequently, Madden strove to resolve minor cases before they could become court challenges, and worked to delay appeals as long as possible until the best possible case could be brought to the Court. The Supreme Court eventually upheld the NLRA in NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U.S. 1 (1937), and Madden personally argued the case (along with NLRB General Counsel Charles Fahy and Charles Edward Wyzanski Jr., a special assistant in the office of the United States Solicitor General) before the Court.Stern, Robert L.; Horsky, Charles A.; Morse, David A.; and Freund, Paul A. \\"The Solicitor General.\\" In The Making of the New Deal: The Insiders Speak. Frank Freidel, Katie Louchheim, and Jonathan Dembo, eds. Reprint ed. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1984. The ruling marked the Court's abandonment of Lochner era jurisprudence and led to a series of cases upholding New Deal legislation.Hoffer, Peter Charles; Hoffer, William James Hull; and Hull, N.E.H. The Supreme Court: An Essential History. Lawrence, Kan.: University Press of Kansas, 2007. Madden continued to strategically guide the NLRB's legal efforts to strengthen the courts' view of the NLRA and the Board's actions. Through the efforts of Madden and NLRB General Counsel Charles H. Fahy, the Supreme Court reviewed only 27 cases between August 1935 and March 1941, even though the Board had processed nearly than 5,000 cases since its inception. The Supreme Court enforced the NLRB's rulings in 19 cases without modifying them, enforced them with modification in six more, and denied enforcement in two cases. Additionally, the Board won all 30 injunction and all 16 representation cases before the lower courts, a rate of success unequaled by any other federal agency. AFL opposition Madden's stewardship of the NLRB came under increasing attack, however. Section 9(b) of the NLRA authorized the Board to determine the appropriate bargaining unit, but did not specify what standards to use to make that determination. The AFL had long preferred craft unionism, whereby workers were organized into unions on the basis of craft, trade, or skill.Galenson, Walter. The CIO Challenge to the AFL: A History of the American Labor Movement. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1960. ; Zieger, Robert H. The CIO, 1935-1955. Reprint ed. Chapel Hill, N.C.: University of North Carolina Press, 1997. But other unions sought to organize workers on an industry-wide basis (industrial unionism) to create more powerful unions as well as to take advantage of changes in the workplace that mass production and increases in corporate size were making. The intense philosophical differences led the AFL to eject those organizations advocating industrial unionism, and these unions formed the CIO in November 1936. J. Warren Madden (left) goes over testimony with Charles Fahy (right) and Nathan Witt prior to a U.S. Senate Commerce Committee hearing on December 13, 1937. AFL opposition to the \\"Madden Board\\" grew.Horowitz, David A. America's Political Class Under Fire: The Twentieth Century's Great Culture War. Florence, Ky.: Routledge, 2003. Initially, the NLRB heldGlobe Machine & Stamping Co., 3 NLRB 294 (1937). in 1937 that workers themselves should determine whether they wished to be organized by craft or industry, a compromise acceptable to both the AFL and the CIO.Tomlins, Christopher L. The State and the Unions: Labor Relations, Law, and the Organized Labor Movement in America, 1880-1960. Reprint ed. New York: Cambridge University Press, 1985. But in 1939, the Board held in American Can Co., 13 NLRB 1252 (1939) that a unit's history of collective bargaining could overrule democratic self- determination. The decision deeply angered the AFL, which had sought to carve out three craft-based unions from the larger bargaining unit. The NLRB also upset the AFL when in 1938 it upheld an industry-wide bargaining unit that favored the CIO-affiliated International Longshore and Warehouse Union over the AFL-affiliated International Longshoremen's Association.Shipowners' Ass'n of the Pacific Coast, 7 NLRB 1002 (1938), enf'd American Federation of Labor v. National Labor Relations Board, 308 U.S. 401 (1940). The AFL, never a strong proponent of the NLRA, had proposed amending the law in early 1936. The \\"Madden Board's\\" actions led it to adopt a resolution in October 1937 condemning Madden's administration of the NLRB and the NLRA. It adopted another resolution in October 1938 charging the NLRB and Madden with perverting the law and harboring prejudice against craft unions. In June 1938, the House Un-American Activities Committee (led by Chairman Martin Dies, Jr.) heard testimony from AFL leader John P. Frey, who accused Madden of staffing the NLRB with communists.\\"Reds Start Count of Allies in Federal Jobs And Push Participation in C.I.O., Frey Says.\\" New York Times.

Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 2005. The allegations were true, in at least one case: Nathan Witt, the NLRB's executive secretary and the man to whom Madden had delegated most administrative functions, was a member of the Communist Party of the United States.Halpern, Martin. Unions, Radicals, and Democratic Presidents: Seeking Social Change in the Twentieth Century. Santa Barbara, Calif.: Greenwood Publishing Group, 2003. Witt had extensive influence among the staff, was close to Board Member Edwin S. Smith, and had influenced procedural matters on the Board in favor of the CIO in at least a few instances. Secretary Perkins prevailed upon President Roosevelt to speak with Madden, and the President demanded an impartial administration of the law. When Member Donald Wakefield Smith's term on the Board expired, Roosevelt put William Morris Leiserson (Chairman of the National Mediation Board and a conservative Democrat) on the NLRB in his place on July 1, 1939.Stark, Louis. \\"Leiserson Picked for Labor Board.\\" New York Times. April 25, 1939; \\"Leiserson Named to Place on NLRB.\\" New York Times. April 26, 1939. Leiserson forced Madden to appoint a personnel director and a trial examiner to reduce Witt's power, and unsuccessfully sought Witt's dismissal and a significant reduction in the Board's legal staff. Over the next six months, Madden abandoned his formerly expansive interpretation of the NLRA and began switching back and forth between the liberal position represented by Member Edwin S. Smith and the conservative position advocated by William M. Leiserson. The Smith Committee NLRB Member William M. Leiserson (left), J. Warren Madden, and NLRB Member Edwin S. Smith (right) during testimony before the Smith Committee on December 22, 1939. On July 20, 1939, Republicans and conservative Democrats formed a coalition to push through the House of Representatives a resolution establishing a Special Committee to Investigate the National Labor Relations Board (the \\"Smith Committee\\"), chaired by conservative, anti-labor Rep. Howard W. Smith of Virginia. In testimony before the Smith Committee in December 1939, Leiserson strongly attacked Madden's administration of the NLRB.\\"Leiserson in Feud at National Labor Relations Board Hearing.\\" New York Times.

On March 7, 1940, the Smith Committee proposed legislation which would have abolished the NLRB, reconstituted it, and radically amended the NLRA.Atleson, James B. Labor and the Wartime State: Labor Relations and Law During World War II. Urbana, Ill.: University of Illinois Press, 1998. Among the changes proposed: Removal of many of the guarantees of collective bargaining from the Wagner Act's preamble, denial of legal protections to sitdown strikers and agricultural workers, removal of the requirement that employers must bargain with unions, making the General Counsel independent from the Board, abolition of the Board's economic research unit, enhanced employer free speech rights, introduction of the right of employers to seek an election among their workers, and removal of the Board's authority to engage in bargaining unit determination.

April 14, 1940; \\"Rival Labor Bills Put Before House.\\" New York Times. April 20, 1940.

To protect the NLRB, Roosevelt convinced Senator Elbert D. Thomas, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Education and Labor, to hold no hearings or votes on the bill, and the legislation died. The Smith Committee investigation had a lasting effect on labor law in the United States, and the Smith bill was the basis for the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947. Federal judicial service Madden was nominated by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on November 15, 1940, to a seat on the Court of Claims (United States Court of Claims from June 25, 1948) vacated by Judge William R. Green. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on January 2, 1941, and received his commission on January 7, 1941. Madden was initially appointed as a Judge under Article I, but the court was raised to Article III status by operation of law on July 28, 1953, and Madden thereafter served as an Article III Judge. He assumed senior status on August 15, 1961. His service terminated on February 17, 1972, due to his death. Nomination battle Roosevelt had briefly considered Madden for the seat being vacated by Francis Biddle on the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit (Biddle was being nominated to be United States Attorney General).\\"Jackson, Biddle Get Higher Posts.\\" New York Times. January 5, 1940. But Roosevelt's confidantes were urging the president to \\"dump Madden\\" as a political liability and because the previous year's opposition had made Madden's reappointment a political impossibility. Madden entered political limbo: His five-year term as an NLRB Member expired on August 27, 1940, but Roosevelt did not reappoint him or anyone else to the position.Stark, Louis. \\"Showdown Near on Madden's Post.\\" New York Times.

October 10, 1940. Finally, on November 15, 1940, President Roosevelt nominated Harry A.

November 7, 1940; Hurd, Charles. \\"Roosevelt Names Dr. Millis to NLRB, Replacing Madden.\\" New York Times. November 16, 1940. Although the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary favorably reported Madden's nomination to the floor (almost without discussion or comment),\\"Favors Madden for Judge.\\" New York Times. November 28, 1940. Republican Senators Robert A. Taft and Arthur H. Vandenberg, along with other Republicans, attempted to hold up the nomination on procedural grounds as a means of expressing their anger at what they believed was Madden's pro- labor administration of the National Labor Relations Act.\\"Confirms Madden Over Taft Protest.\\" New York Times. January 3, 1941.\\"Vandenberg Again Blocks Madden Job.\\" New York Times. December 3, 1940; \\"Longest Congress idles last 3 Days.\\" New York Times. December 31, 1940. Senator Taft intended to deny Madden's nomination a vote on the Senate floor, arguing that the Judiciary Committee had approved the nomination via telephone voice vote and telegram rather than at a face-to-face meeting. But Senator John E. Miller (Chairman of the Judiciary subcommittee which had approved the nomination in a face-to-face conference) and Senate Majority Leader Alben W. Barkley both defended the practice, noting it had been used many times before without question. Taft then attacked Madden for four hours on the Senate floor, declaring Madden had \\"no judicial temperament whatsoever\\" and that he had perpetrated a \\"gross perversion of justice\\" while head of the NRLB. After a struggle to obtain a quorum, the Senate was able to resolve itself for business and voted 36-to-14 to approve Madden's nomination to the bench.\\"Vote of the Senate Confirming Madden.\\" Associated Press.

Madden was often designated to sit on various United States courts of appeals when workload or vacancies threatened to impede an appellate court's function or his expertise was required. In 1958, sitting on an appellate court, Madden wrote an opinion which held that United States courts had no jurisdiction over claims by American banks that they had lost money in the Russian Revolution of 1917.Lewis, Anthony. \\"Bank Loses Plea on Russian Fund.\\" New York Times.

The character first appeared in the Philadelphia-based underground newspaper Yarrowstalks #2 in July 1967, making her comics debut in the second issue of Zap Comix (June 1968). Characterization Angelfood McSpade is a satirical portrayal of a stereotypical black African woman.Dowd; Hignite 2006.Crumb; Holm 2004. She is depicted as a large, bare-breasted tribeswoman, dressed in nothing but a skirt made out of palm tree leaves.Crowley 1995. She is drawn with big lips, golden rings around her neck and in her ears, huge breasts, large round buttocks and speaks jive. Her name references angelfood cake and the racial slur \\"spade\\". According to the second issue of Zap Comix, she has been confined to \\"the wilds of darkest Africa\\", because \\"civilization would be threatened if she were allowed to do whatever she pleased!\\"Crumb, R. \\"Angelfood McSpade: She's Sock-a-Delic ‚Äî She's All Heart,\\" Zap Comix #2 (July 1968). It is not clear whether she was born in Africa or born in the U.S.A. and then sent to Africa. Her type of clothing suggests she is African, but her jive talk suggests she's from the U.S.A.Estren 1993. Angelfood is depicted as a nymphomaniac and open to sexual intercourse.Harvey 1996. In many of her stories she is accompanied by Snoid, another of Crumb's characters who is portrayed as \\"a short-statured asshole\\" known for \\"his fetishes, sex cravings, and disdain for materialism.\\"Fox, M. Steven. \\"Snoid Comics,\\" ComixJoint. Accessed 16 November 2016. Policemen prevent other sexually aroused men from meeting Angelfood. In a later story three men bring her to the United States and promise to \\"civilize\\" her. There she is told to lick toilets clean in order to gain success. While she does this, the men push her head inside the toilet and violate her.Jahraus; Neuhaus 2003.Crumb, R. Untitled (\\"There she is, fellows! Ah! She'll be so grateful to us!\\"), East Village Other (18 October 1968) She is very na√Øve and easily abused or even raped by the horny men who surround her, though, being a nymphomaniac, she is not bothered by this. Often, she is vulnerable to assault while being asleep or unconscious. Angelfood has a tendency to walk barebreasted, even in cities. However, no one seems to stop her from walking around half-naked. In another story she saves two boys, Chuck and Bob, from being eaten by members of her own tribe.Heller 2004. They flee from the tribe to the U.S., where she spends a night with the boys and afterwards goes to the hairdresser. When she returns, she has bleached her skin, changed her hair and clothing and learned fluent English, much to the disappointment of the two boys.Crumb, R. \\"Ups and Downs,\\" Yellow Dog vol. 2, #2 [issue #13/14] (Print Mint, July 1969). In another story she asked Hugh Hefner if she could become a Playboy Bunny, but when Hefner saw her in the outfit he couldn't resist laughing. This made her so angry that she attacked him. In the last panel she and Mr. Natural (who accompanied her) are kicked out of Hefner's office. \\"Angelfood McSpade,\\" Playboy vol. 17, #7 (July 1970). The character was featured regularly during Crumb's late 1960s and early 1970s output. In later comics her appearances became less frequent, and finally after 1971 Crumb stopped using the character in his comics altogether. Controversy Angelfood McSpade is one of Crumb's most notorious targets for accusations of sexism and racism.Sorensen 2005. Crumb has responded that he did not invent racist caricatures like Angelfood, but that they used to be part of the American culture in which he was raised.Huxley 2001. He saw the character as a criticism of the racist stereotype itself and assumed that the young liberal hippie/intellectual audience who read his work were not racists and would understand his intentions for the character.Lopes 2009.

The school is well known for sports teams, and school bands who participate in various competitions throughout Ontario. History The school opened in September 1906 as three small buildings in the Wingham Public School. Later, construction began on an actual high school. Increased population and the introduction of shop and home ec classes lead to the construction of a new school. It was sold to W.T. Cruickshank for a dollar and the former location became a radio station (CKNX, AM920). Because so many students came from out of town in 1968, there was a contest held to try to find a new name for the school. The winning name was F.E. Madill, named after the school principal at the time, Frank E. Madill. On March 31, 2010, FE Madill held a pre-release screening of a documentary film entitled Still Bill.

At the time, Newbury was making an impact as an incredible and successful songwriter in Nashville, signed by Acuff-Rose Publishing. At one point he had four #1 hits on different charts for Eddy Arnold, Solomon Burke, The First Edition, and Andy Williams, and he had written hits for several others. Produced by Elvis Presley producer Felton Jarvis, Harlequin Melodies concentrates on Newbury's versions of his hit songs; nearly every song on the album has been covered by other artists. Sonically, the album is drastically different from anything else Newbury would record. The artist largely disowned the album, considering its successor Looks Like Rain his true debut. In contrast to the subtle expressiveness of Newbury's prime work, Harlequin Melodies is overproduced and packed with often distracting instrumental touches, shifting tempos, and strange production effects. As a result of his dissatisfaction with the album and recording sessions, Newbury ended his RCA contract. Some of the songs on Harlequin Melodies would be re-recorded by Newbury for later albums, with very marked differences. \\"How Many Times (Must The Piper Be Paid For His Song)\\" was a highlight of Frisco Mabel Joy, \\"Good Morning, Dear\\" and \\"Sweet Memories\\" were on Heaven Help the Child, \\"Here Comes The Rain Baby\\" on A Long Road Home, the last album Newbury released during his lifetime. Seven of the songs on Harlequin Melodies were repackaged for Sings His Own where they would be joined by another oft-covered Newbury song \\"Sunshine\\" and two of his RCA singles \\"The Queen\\" and \\"Got Down On Saturday.\\" Most CD versions add these songs as bonus tracks to the complete Harlequin Melodies album.

Binding selectivity describes how a ligand may bind more preferentially to one receptor than another. A selectivity coefficient is the equilibrium constant for the reaction of displacement by one ligand of another ligand in a complex with the substrate. Binding selectivity is of major importance in biochemistry and in chemical separation processes.  Selectivity coefficient  The concept of selectivity is used to quantify the extent to which one chemical substance, A, binds each of two other chemical substances, B and C. The simplest case is where the complexes formed have 1:1 stoichiometry. Then, the two interactions may be characterized by equilibrium constants KAB and KAC.The constant used here are association constants. Dissociation constants are used in some contexts. A dissociation constant is the reciprocal of an association constant. :{A} + B <=> AB; \\\\mathit K_{AB}=\\\\frac{[AB]}{[A][B]} :{A} + C <=> AC; \\\\mathit K_{AC}=\\\\frac{[AC]}{[A][C]} [..] represents a concentration. A selectivity coefficient is defined as the ratio of the two equilibrium constants. :K_\\\\ce{B,C}=\\\\frac{K_\\\\ce{AC}}{K_\\\\ce{AB}} This selectivity coefficient is in fact the equilibrium constant for the displacement reaction :{AB} + C <=> {AC} + B; \\\\mathit K_{B,C}=\\\\frac{[AC][B]}{[AB][C]} =\\\\frac{\\\\mathit K_{AC}[A][B][C]}{\\\\mathit K_{AB}[A][B][C]} =\\\\frac{\\\\mathit K_{AC}}{\\\\mathit K_{AB}} It is easy to show that the same definition applies to complexes of a different stoichiometry, ApBq and ApCq. The greater the selectivity coefficient, the more the ligand C will displace the ligand B from the complex formed with the substrate A. An alternative interpretation is that the greater the selectivity coefficient, the lower the concentration of C that is needed to displace B from AB. Selectivity coefficients are determined experimentally by measuring the two equilibrium constants, KAB and KAC.  Applications   Biochemistry  In biochemistry the substrate is known as a receptor. A receptor is a protein molecule, embedded in either the plasma membrane or the cytoplasm of a cell, to which one or more specific kinds of signalling molecules may bind. A ligand may be a peptide or another small molecule, such as a neurotransmitter, a hormone, a pharmaceutical drug, or a toxin. The specificity of a receptor is determined by its spatial geometry and the way it binds to the ligand through non-covalent interactions, such as hydrogen bonding or Van der Waals forces. If a receptor can be isolated a synthetic drug can be developed either to stimulate the receptor, an agonist or to block it, an antagonist. The stomach ulcer drug cimetidine was developed as an H2 antagonist by chemically engineering the molecule for maximum specificity to an isolated tissue containing the receptor. The further use of quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) led to the development of other agents such as ranitidine. It is important to note that \\"selectivity\\" when referring to a drug is relative and not absolute. For example, in a higher dose, a specific drug molecule may also bind to other receptors than those said to be \\"selective\\".  Chelation therapy  Chelation therapy is a form of medical treatment in which a chelating ligandThe term \\"ligand\\" here refers to binding to a metal. In the definition of selectivity coefficient this \\"ligand\\" is in fact the substrate and ligand in that definition is the metal ion. is used to selectively remove a metal from the body. When the metal exists as a divalent ion, such as with lead, Pb2+ or mercury, Hg2+ selectivity against calcium, Ca2+ and magnesium, Mg2+, is essential in order that the treatment does not remove essential metals. Selectivity is determined by various factors. In the case of iron overload, which may occur in individuals with Œ≤-thalessemia who have received blood transfusions, the target metal ion is in the +3 oxidation state and so forms stronger complexes than the divalent ions. It also forms stronger complexes with oxygen-donor ligands than with nitrogen-donor ligands. deferoxamine, a naturally occurring siderophore produced by the actinobacter Streptomyces pilosus and was used initially as a chelation therapy agent. Synthetic siderophores such as deferiprone and deferasirox have been developed, using the known structure of deferoxamine as a starting point.Iron- Selective Chelators With Therapeutic Potential in Chelation occurs with the two oxygen atoms. Wilson's disease is caused by a defect in copper metabolism which results in accumulation of copper metal in various organs of the body. The target ion in this case is divalent, Cu2+. This ion is classified as borderline in the scheme of Ahrland, Chatt and Davies. This means that it forms roughly equally strong complexes with ligands whose donor atoms are N, O or F as with ligands whose donor atoms are P, S or Cl. Penicillamine, which contains nitrogen and sulphur donor atoms, is used as this type of ligand binds more strongly to copper ions than to calcium and magnesium ions. Treatment of poisoning by heavy metals such as lead and mercury is more problematical, because the ligands used do not have high specificity relative to calcium. For example, EDTA may be administered as a calcium salt to reduce the removal of calcium from bone together with the heavy metal. Factors determining selectivity for lead against zinc, cadmium and calcium have been reviewed,  Chromatography  In column chromatography a mixture of substances is dissolved in a mobile phase and passed over a stationary phase in a column. A selectivity factor is defined as the ratio of distribution coefficients, which describe the equilibrium distribution of an analyte between the stationary phase and the mobile phase. The selectivity factor is equal to the selectivity coefficient with the added assumption that the activity of the stationary phase, the substrate in this case, is equal to 1, the standard assumption for a pure phase. Section 30E The resolution of a chromatographic column, RS is related to the selectivity factor by: :R_S=\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt N}{4}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\alpha-1}{\\\\alpha}\\\\right)\\\\left(\\\\frac{k_B}{1+k_B}\\\\right) where Œ± is selectivity factor, N is the number of theoretical plates kA and kB are the retention factors of the two analytes. Retention factors are proportional to distribution coefficients. In practice substances with a selectivity factor very close to 1 can be separated. This is particularly true in gas-liquid chromatography where column lengths up to 60 m are possible, providing a very large number of theoretical plates. In ion-exchange chromatography the selectivity coefficient is defined in a slightly different way  Solvent extraction  Solvent extraction is used to extract individual lanthanoid elements from the mixtures found in nature in ores such as monazite. In one process, the metal ions in aqueous solution are made to form complexes with tributylphosphate (TBP), which are extracted into an organic solvent such as kerosene. Complete separation is effected by using a countercurrent exchange method. A number of cells are arranged as a cascade. After equilibration, the aqueous component of each cell is transferred to the previous cell and the organic component is transferred to the next cell, which initially contains only water. In this way the metal ion with the most stable complex passes down the cascade in the organic phase and the metal with the least stable complex passes up the cascade in the aqueous phase. If solubility in the organic phase is not an issue, a selectivity coefficient is equal to the ratio of the stability constants of the TBP complexes of two metal ions. For lanthanoid elements which are adjacent in the periodic table this ratio is not much greater than 1, so many cells are needed in the cascade.  Chemical sensors  Types of Chemosensors. (1.) Indicator-spacer-receptor (ISR) (2.) Indicator-Displacement Assay (IDA) A potentiometric selectivity coefficient defines the ability of an ion-selective electrode to distinguish one particular ion from others. The selectivity coefficient, KB,C is evaluated by means of the emf response of the ion-selective electrode in mixed solutions of the primary ion, B, and interfering ion, C (fixed interference method) or less desirably, in separate solutions of B and C (separate solution method). For example, a potassium ion-selective membrane electrode utilizes the naturally occurring macrocyclic antibiotic valinomycin. In this case the cavity in the macrocyclic ring is just the right size to encapsulate the potassium ion, but too large to bind the sodium ion, the most likely interference, strongly. Chemical sensors,Florinel-Gabriel BƒÉnicƒÉ, Chemical Sensors and Biosensors: Fundamentals and Applications, John Wiley and Sons, Chichester, 2012, Print are being developed for specific target molecules and ions in which the target (guest) form a complex with a sensor (host). The sensor is designed to be an excellent match in terms of the size and shape of the target in order to provide for the maximum binding selectivity. An indicator is associated with the sensor which undergoes a change when the target forms a complex with the sensor . The indicator change is usually a colour change (gray to yellow in the illustration) seen in absorbance or, with greater sensitivity, luminescence. The indicator may be attached to the sensor via a spacer, in the ISR arrangement, or it may be displaced from the sensor, IDA arrangement.

History The original SR 175 was on a different route before 2004, when the last of East Shelby Drive were included into the route. The original road took a sharp left onto what is now Houston Levee Road for , then a sharp right onto what is now Collierville Road, and continued east for , until reaching Byhalia Road, and taking a sharp left, continuing to the end of the current route. These last 2.4 miles of SR 175 (Collierville Road) have undergone rigorous construction since about 1998, and barely one-third of the current road follows exactly the original route. Prior to the 1980s, Shelby Drive was known as \\"Whitehaven-Capleville Road\\" or \\"Whitecap\\" for short; also, the portion of the current route between Fleming Road and Byhalia Road in Collierville was called \\"Mann Road.\\" Route description Memphis SR 175 begins in extreme southwestern Shelby County as a continuation of MS 301 along Weaver Road. It intersects US 61/SR 14 (Third Street) and travels with it until Shelby Drive where it turns east. After about , SR 175 passes Greeter Park and intercepts Horn Lake Road to become East Shelby Drive, passing through the community of Persey. SR 175 then crosses the Illinois Central Railroad. From this point, SR 175 travels another 2.4 miles through Whitehaven in southern Memphis, and intercepts US 51 (SR 3/Elvis Presley Boulevard). Then, SR 175 continues for , and intercepts I-55/I-69 (Exit 2). Shortly after, intercepting Airways Boulevard and passing the Memphis International Airport. After passing the airport SR 175 has an intersection with SR 176 (Getwell Road) before it intercepts US 78 (SR 4/Lamar Avenue) within the community of Capleville and crosses the BNSF Railway twice. Germantown After , and crossing several major city roads, SR 175 (East Shelby Drive) crosses South Germantown Road and enters Germantown. It then intercepts Hacks Cross Road after . Collierville Following another 2 miles, SR 175 (East Shelby Drive) shares a crossroads with Forest Hill Irene Road, entering Collierville, and becoming a two-lane road. For the next 2 miles SR 175 is somewhat rural, then crossing South Houston Levee Road. SR 175 then briefly widens to six lanes for before crossing Fleming Road, and then goes another along a narrow rural route before stopping at Byhalia Road. SR 175 turns left onto Byhalia Road and heads nearly due north. SR 175 continues for 1 mile until widening to four lanes and crossing SR 385. SR 175 then travels 1 mile before the designation ends at Poplar Avenue (US 72/SR 57) in the heart of the Collierville business district.

Born in the village of Bijelo Brdo, near Dalj in Austria-Hungary, Trbiƒá was a monk in his youth. He fled Mount Athos after being accused of murdering several fellow monks and joined the nationalist band of Jovan Drimkolski in 1904‚Äì05, quickly becoming the unit's commander. Trbiƒá fought alongside Serbian forces during the Balkan Wars and during World War I, earning the Order of the Star of Karaƒëorƒëe for his efforts. Acting alongside other former Chetnik commanders, he participated in establishing organizations whose purpose was to raise monuments to Serbian military successes from 1912‚Äì18 and to promote cultural development in Macedonia in the interwar period. He died in 1962. Early life Vasilije Trbiƒá was born in 1881 in the Slavonian village of Bijelo Brdo, near Dalj. He completed his early schooling here before continuing his education in the Kingdom of Serbia. A monk in his youth, Trbiƒá was forced to flee Mount Athos in 1902 after being charged with murdering several Greek monks. He found sanctuary in Belgrade, where he met several Serbian nationalist leaders who convinced him to join their Chetnik bands. In 1903, Trbiƒá murdered a Turk near the Pƒçinja River. He was caught and sentenced to death by Ottoman Turkish authorities before being pardoned for his crime. Involvement with the Chetniks Trbiƒá (in white clothing) with fellow Chetnik commanders, 1908. In 1904‚Äì05, Trbiƒá joined a Chetnik band in a Macedonian village in Drimkol and replaced vojvoda ƒêorƒëe Cvetkoviƒá-Drimkolski as the unit's commander. Soon afterwards, he had one of his men executed for lack of discipline. This incident brought him into conflict with other Chetnik leaders in the area, notably vojvoda Andjelko Krstiƒá. In 1907, Trbiƒá was promoted to the rank of vojvoda in the city of Veles. Bloody skirmishes near the village of Nebregovo followed, involving Trbiƒá's Chetniks and local Bulgarian insurgents. In 1907, Trbiƒá and fellow vojvoda Jovan Babunski joined forces to defeat the forces of Bulgarian warlord Stevan Dimitrov in the village of Drenovo. During the Balkan Wars, his Chetnik band launched several diversionary attacks against Turkish forces in Macedonia on behalf of the Serbian Army. As the war progressed, his Chetniks became one of the first Serbian units to enter the towns of Veles and Prilep in November 1912. Trbiƒá flew an airplane past German, Austro-Hungarian, and Bulgarian lines and carried out reconnaissance missions for the Serbian Army after consulting with the intelligence officer Major Milan Vasiƒá.He was awarded the Order of the Star of Karaƒëorƒëe for his efforts. In September 1912, Vasilije Trbiƒá entered the village of Desovo with 30 Chetniks where they massacred 111 Albanian men and burned the village. In nearby Brailovo, Trbiƒá had 60 Albanians executed. Political career After the war, Trbiƒá became involved in politics. In 1924, he was elected as a deputy representing the People's Radical Party (NRS) in the National Assembly of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. Afterwards, he changed allegiances and became a member of the Yugoslav National Party (JNP). Alongside other former Chetnik commanders, he also participated in establishing organizations whose purpose was to raise monuments to Serbian military successes from 1912‚Äì18 and to promote cultural development in Macedonia. Following the Yugoslav coup d'√©tat in March 1941, Trbiƒá was overtly antagonistic towards the political and military leaders of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, whom he blamed for the Axis invasion of the country. As World War II progressed, Trbiƒá's son, Milivoje, became a Chetnik commander and led Chetnik forces in the Poreƒçe region. Trbiƒá died in 1962.

As with the preceding album, many of these songs would be heavily covered by other artists, and Newbury himself would reinterpret \\"Sweet Memories\\", \\"Sunshine\\", and \\"Good Morning, Dear\\" on his 1973 album Heaven Help The Child.

Okinawa Originally interested in history and travelling, he retired at age 60 from the university and travelled to Okinawa in 1932 and 1933. In 1932, a cameraman accompanied him and in 1933 he was accompanied by his wife, son, a cameraman and an artist.

It is garnished with toasted garlic, rock salt, black pepper and sometimes chopped scallions. The rice grains are ideally loose and not stuck together. It is rarely eaten on its own, but is usually paired with a \\"dry\\" meat dish such as tocino (bacon), longganisa (sausage), tapa (dried or cured meat), Spam, or daing (dried fish), as well as the addition of scrambled or fried eggs.

He was also the grandson of Wilhelm II, German Emperor. Early life Marie-Auguste of Anhalt. Prince Karl Franz was born on 15 December 1916 in Potsdam. He was the only child born to Prince Joachim of Prussia by his wife Princess Marie-Auguste of Anhalt. Karl Franz was the Emperor's fourth grandchild to be born since World War I began; he was consequently very young when Hohenzollern fortunes fell. His grandfather abdicated in 1918, and his father Prince Joachim committed suicide in 1920. At the time of his grandfather's abdication, Prince Karl Franz was twelfth in line of succession to the German and Prussian thrones. After his father's suicide, Karl Franz was taken into custody by his paternal uncle Prince Eitel Friedrich of Prussia. As the legal head of the House of Hohenzollern, he claimed this right because Emperor Wilhelm had issued an edict placing Hohenzollern powers in Eitel's hands. This was later declared to have been illegal, and his mother was given full custody of him in 1921. She was given this right despite the fact that she had run away from her husband and that there had been numerous servants testifying against her. Eitel's defence had also stated that Marie-Auguste was not a fit person for Karl Franz's guardianship. Marie-Auguste went to court however and made a plea that she was heartbroken, which may have helped win the case for her. In 1922, Marie-Auguste sued ex-Emperor Wilhelm for financial support that had been promised in her and Joachim's marriage contract. Wilhelm's attorney argued that the House of Hohenzollern laws were no longer valid, and therefore there was no obligation to support her. In 1926, his mother remarried to Johannes-Michael, Baron von Lo√´n. They were divorced in 1935. In World War II, Karl Franz served as a lieutenant in an armoured car division, and at one point was stationed on the Polish front. He was awarded the Iron Cross. Marriages First On 5 October 1940, Karl Franz married Princess Henriette Hermine Wanda Ida Luise of Sch√∂naich-Carolath. She was a daughter of Princess Hermine Reuss of Greiz, who had been the second wife of Karl Franz's grandfather Emperor Wilhelm II since 1922 (Henriette was thus Kaiser Wilhelm's stepdaughter). Held at Wilhelm's private residence without much ceremony, he and Hermine attended the ceremony, as did a few other guests. The Mayor of Doorn performed the ceremony. They had three children: *Prince Franz Wilhelm Viktor Christoph Stephan of Prussia (born 3 September 1943), he married a claimant to the Russian throne Maria Vladimirovna, Grand Duchess of Russia.

The northbound span of the Yadkin River Veterans Memorial Bridge, the first of two carrying Interstate 85 / U.S. Highway 52, opened May 5, 2012, and on August 2, 2012, southbound traffic moved to that span as well. A southbound span of the same bridge was completed in October 2012 and opened to traffic in March 2013. Each span carries four lanes of traffic. Separated by less than were the twin spans carrying Interstate 85 / U.S. Highway 52 used from 1957 to 2012. Adjacent are two bridges carrying the Norfolk Southern Railroad, and two bridges carrying U.S. Highway 29 / U.S. Highway 70 / NC 150, one of which was closed and has been replaced. Interstate 85 bridges The original Interstate 85 Yadkin River Bridge, twin spans completed in 1957 and closed August 2, 2012, carried four lanes of Interstate 85 (two in each direction). The bridge was not only a bottleneck for traffic moving between Charlotte and Greensboro (and between the larger metropolitan areas of Atlanta and Washington, D.C.); it was also structurally deficient and in need of replacement. In terms of cost, national importance, and imminent structural failure, it became the highest-profile construction project in North Carolina. In the 1940s, plans began for an Interstate Highway System. North Carolina's State Highway Commission built several limited access roads using equal funding from the federal government and from the state. One planned road was the Salisbury bypass, long with a $1 million twin-span bridge over the Yadkin River. Construction on the bridge started in 1955 (this date is shown on a plaque, and most sources have used the date), but the lanes were not as wide as federal standards required, and the road had a sharp curve north of the bridge. Both of these characteristics saved money. The Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 provided for 90 percent federal funding of highways that would become part of the Interstate Highway System, and the N.C. Highway Commission used the funds to build the rest of the highway, which opened as I-85 in 1958. The bridge, finished a year earlier, was \\"grandfathered\\" despite not meeting standards. As of 1984, I-85 was relocated and widened to six lanes starting several miles north of the Yadkin River. Plans were made for widening to eight lanes around Salisbury. As of 2001, the project to build a wider, safer replacement bridge was expected to cost $147 million, with right-of-way acquisition in the years 2003 through 2005 and construction starting by 2007 or 2008.Mark Wineka, \\"Road projects piling up for Salisbury area,\\" Salisbury Post, 2001-09-28. In 2005, the state prepared to ask for bids, but concerns about damage to a Native American cultural site delayed the project two years. With less funding available, the state considered and eventually rejected tolls. After many more delays, the state government asked for federal funding but only received $10 million in TIGER money in 2010. At that time, the bridge carried over 70,000 vehicles every day. The funding for the $180 million design-build project, to be completed in 2013, came from the $10 million from TIGER, $20 million from the state's Transportation Improvement Program, and GARVEE bonds to be repaid over 12 years. The DOT announced April 30 that Flatiron-Lane would build the new I-85 bridge, a replacement bridge for the U.S. 29-70 northbound traffic, bridges taking I-85 over the railroad's main line and a spur line, and redesign one interchange and remove another, in addition to widening and relocating of I-85, for a total cost of $136 million, $44 million less than expected. The state and federal departments of transportation approved the plan July 6. On September 29, 2010, state and local officials held a groundbreaking ceremony on the Davidson County side of the project. Work on the project was scheduled to start the next day. By October 9, 20 acres had been cleared after approximately a week. To build the actual bridge, crews spent five months building a half-mile long, 38-foot wide temporary steel bridge for workers and equipment. This bridge remained in place from July 2011 until October 2012 and had to support as many as six 230-ton cranes at a time. On May 11, 2011, the State House passed legislation to call the I-85 bridge the Yadkin River Veterans Memorial Bridge. The northbound bridge's foundation was complete by December 2011, with traffic scheduled to move to that bridge by the end of March 2012. The northbound bridge opened to traffic at 1:15 A.M. May 5, 2012, and southbound traffic moved to lanes on the same bridge August 2 as the old twin spans closed. Demolition work on the old bridges was under way by February 2013 and scheduled to be finished by April. While the target date for the southbound bridge was April 2013, it was later scheduled to open March 9. An official dedication marking the bridge's completion and naming was held November 8, 2013. Wil-Cox Bridge The Wil-Cox Bridge is a concrete arch bridge which carried the southbound lanes of U.S. 29 and the westbound lanes of U.S. 70 but now carries both lanes of both highways. It was completed in 1924 at a cost of $212,000, is almost long, is wide, and consists of seven open spandrel arch spans. The Wil-Cox Bridge, named for highway commissioners W.E. Wilkinson of Charlotte and Elwood Cox of High Point, is one of only six of its type left in the state. As of 2001, the city of Salisbury wanted to see the bridge preserved. When the U.S. 29-70 bridge is replaced, this bridge will no longer be used for traffic. Until early 2009, the state was planning to demolish the bridge, but preservationists wanted it saved as a pedestrian bridge, \\"a regional historical artifact\\" to become part of a planned greenway system. Davidson County decided to consider taking ownership and responsibility for maintenance, with the state giving the county the $2.5 million estimated cost of demolition. In March 2010, Davidson County voted to take the bridge, though one opponent pointed out that preserving the bridge would be more of a tourism advantage to Rowan County, which did not want the bridge. Tourist attractions in the area included Trading Ford and the former site of the Civil War fort Camp Yadkin. On April 8, 2010, the N.C. DOT closed the Wil-Cox Bridge due to safety concerns. Inspectors discovered the problems in December 2008, but the closure of the bridge was expected to take place in a few years once the I-85 bridges were ready. Delays on the I-85 bridges meant these problems became serious enough to require repairs to keep the bridge in service. On July 21, 2010, Pat Ivey of the N.C. DOT said the bridge would be used as a detour during construction, so the state would spend $1.5 million on repairs. The work was under way as of February 2011. By April 15, 2011, upgrading on the bridge was halfway to completion. A month later, workers were using a technique called \\"shotcrete\\", using a hose to spray concrete into those spaces where damaged concrete had been removed. By July the work was expected to be complete; the bridge would be needed as a detour. On September 1, 2011, work on Wil-Cox Bridge was complete, allowing the bridge to be used as a detour during replacement of the U.S. 29-70 bridge. The U.S. 29-70 bridge built in 1951 closed April 17, 2012, with the new bridge scheduled to open by Fall 2013. However, only cars going south could use the bridge until August, when changes were made to allow traffic to go both ways. One-way traffic had a negative effect on businesses in Spencer. Other bridges The Norfolk Southern Railroad Yadkin River Bridges were built in 1906 and 1919 and each contain four spans of Warren deck truss. The U.S. Highway 29 North / U.S. Highway 70 East Bridge is a steel girder bridge built in 1951 as a companion to the Wil-Cox Bridge. It was closed and replaced with a new bridge. A portion of the temporary work bridge from the neighboring I-85 project was used to build the new bridge.

Rosen was born Jayne Flanagan in San Antonio, Texas, on August 28, 1917. However, she was largely raised in Torre√≥n, Coahuila, where her father worked for a silver mining company. Her mother was a pianist and her sister was a dancer. Rosen was influenced by Mexican culture early in life, learning Spanish and noting the country's sharp class divisions. She attended Brackenridge High School in San Antonio, Texas. Flanagan performed at talent shows around San Antonio, including the Majestic Theatre, under the stage name, Jayne Walton. She began singing at local radio stations in San Antonio, beforing moving on to stations in Oklahoma City, Dallas and Chicago. One of her radio performances was heard by musician Lawrence Welk, who asked Walton to join his band, the Lawrence Welk Orchestra. Welk named Walton as his Champagne Lady in the early 1940s during World War II. Walton, who could sing in Spanish due to her childhood in Coahuila, recorded the song Maria Elena with Welk, which was certified gold. Walton left the Lawrence Welk Orchestra in the mid-1940s to pursue a solo singing career. She enjoyed success in Chicago and New York City. She largely retired from the professional entertainment circuit in 1952, when she married her husband and adopted the name Jayne Walton Rosen. She continued to make guest appearances on Welk's long-running television show, The Lawrence Welk Show. Rosen later worked as a salesperson at the Rhodes department store and Dillard's at the Central Park Mall. She retired circa 1990. Rosen remained in good health throughout most of her life. However, she suffered from failing health during her later years, including heart disease and kidney disease, which required dialysis. She also broke her hip in a fall. Jayne Walton Rosen died in San Antonio on January 10, 2010, at the age of 92.

Pirrson (1833‚Äì1888), which was active from c.1870 to 1888. It was later known as Hubert, Pirsson and Company, and Hubert, Pirrson & Haddick from 1888-1898. Active during New York City's \\"Gilded Age\\", the firm produced many of the city‚Äôs finest buildings, including hotels, churches and residences, and were especially noted for their luxury co-operative apartments and residential hotels. History and style The French-born Hubert and the New York City-native Pirrson, who was trained by an English architect, established their partnership around 1870; the former‚Äôs father was the architect and engineer Charles Antoine Colomb Gengembre,White & Willenski, p. 181 while the latter‚Äôs father was a well-connected \\"piano-forte manufacturer and musician who helped to found the New York Philharmonic Society.\\" In 1870, both men were \\"listed as the architects for two third-class tenements erected on East 49th Street between First and Second Avenues under the first name Hubert & Pirrson.\\"\\"James W.

The firm initially designed typical single-family rowhouses and tenements. However, the firm is credited with the Episcopal Church of the Blessed Disciple in 1870. Still listed as Hubert & Pirrson, the firm submitted designs for The Appleby in October 1879, a French flathouse on the southeast corner of West 58th Street and Seventh Avenue. The Landmarks Preservation Commission of New York City explained that \\"It was the firm‚Äôs designs for this type of building which gained for them fame and prestige.\\" Some of their most famous apartment houses are the Central Park Apartments or Spanish Flats (now demolished) which had stood on the southeast corner of Seventh Avenue and Central Park South, and the Chelsea (1883) on West 23d Street, a designated New York City Landmark. The firm incorporated some innovative concepts into their apartment plans such as the \\"mezzanine plan\\" or split level apartment, and they provided a greater degree of light and air for their apartments than did most of their contemporaries. Hubert & Pirrson were also actively involved in encouraging the growth of cooperative ownership of apartments.New York City, Manhattan Buildings Department, Dockett Books, N.B. p.769-79; quoted in New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. \\"Designation List 124\\", March 16, 1979 \\"The Queen Anne style, which characterizes this row, is an American variant of the interpretation of early 18th-century English brick architecture Specific details associated with this style include Tudor roses, sunflowers, multi-paneled wood doors and various classical motifs such as swags and wreaths, which often appear on the sheet-metal roof cornices.

Atlas mastic tree and as the Persian turpentine tree.Investigation of Drought influence on rodent food behavior and destruction of watershed in arid and semi-arid regions Pistacia ranges from shrubs to trees adapted to drought and the Mediterranean climate. P. atlantica has three subspecies or varieties which have been described as cabulica, kurdica, and mutica. Names In Iran it is called baneh or wild pistachio tree.Pourreza, M., et al. (2008). Sustainability of wild pistachio (Pistacia atlantica Desf.) in Zagros forests, Iran. Forest Ecology and Management 255 3667-71. In Tamazight, it is known as Tijje…£t. In the Canary Islands it is known as Almacigo, and in Arabic, it is called (bu·π≠m or bu·π≠um). In southern Iran, in Bandar-Abbas in HormozgƒÅn Province it is called kasoudang and in Bushehr it is called kolkhong. In Turkey it is commonly known as melengi√ß. In Kurdish the tree is called darwan or daraban, and the seed is called qezwan (). In Pashto it is called Shanna. Description Pistacia atlantica in Elah valley Pistacia atlantica is a deciduous tree growing up to tall with branches spreading and growing erect to form a dense crown. The trunk is stout and covered in fissured bark. Old trees may have trunks measuring in diameter; it may take 200 years for a tree to reach wide. The leaves are pinnate, each with seven to 9 lance-shaped leaflets. The leaves and branches often have galls when the tree is infested with gall-producing species of aphids, including Pemphigus utricularis, Slavum wertheimae, and Forda riccobonii.Martinez, J. J. I. (2008). Impact of a gall- inducing aphid on Pistacia atlantica Desf. trees. Arthropod-Plant Interactions 2:3 147-51. The tree is dioecious with male and female trees producing different types of flowers. Both types are small and greenish and fall away quickly. Monoecious and hermaphrodite trees have been seen, but are unusual.ƒ∞sfendiyaroƒülu, M. & E. √ñzekera. (2009). Inflorescence features of a new exceptional monoecious Pistacia atlantica Desf. (Anacardiaceae) population in the Barbaros Plain of ƒ∞zmir/Turkey. International Journal of Plant Production 3:3. The oblong, fleshy, oily fruit borne by the female tree is long and pink in color, ripening to blue. It grows slowly, and can reach 1000 years old. It has broken bark with ashen gray color. Older branches have the same design, fractured and ash color, which gives the tree a grizzled look. The leaves are oval, almost sessile, shining above, and dark green, with seven to 9 leaflets, imparipinnate with petioles a little winged, flowers in racemes lax, the male and female on different trees. The flowers are unisexual, small, discreet green, thick as pea fruit, then changing to reddish blue. In colder areas the leaves in May check and fall in November. Though dioecious, in some communities males dominate the female specimens in number. It grows in oak woodlands and oak sclerophyllus. The fruits ripen from July to October, starting to bear fruit at the age of eight to 10 years, with abundant fruit after two to three years. Distribution It is native to a section of Eurasia from North Africa to the Iranian Plateau, where it was once common.Pistacia atlantica Desf. FAO Fact Sheet Because other trees were rare, it was the only good source of wood and was overharvested, reducing its current distribution. It is a common tree in mountain forests in Iran, and it is \\"characteristic\\" of the landscape in parts of Algeria outside the Sahara.Yousfi, M., et al. (2002). Letter to the Editor: Fatty acids and sterols of Pistacia atlantica fruit oil. Journal of the American Oil Chemists' Society 79:10 1049-50. The almacigo is a tree that extends from the North Africa and found in thermophilous forests, up to 600 m altitude. It is one of the few deciduous species native to the Canary archipelago. It is native of Eurasia, the Iranian Plateau, to northern Africa. Azerbaijan (Soltanbud forest) Uses Pistacia atlantica in sunlight There are many uses for this plant. This wild pistachio is the most economically important tree in many parts of Iran, including the Zagros Mountains, where it is managed as a valuable forest tree. The resin and fruit oil were historically used for a variety of medicinal purposes. The resin, known in Iran as saqez, is still an important commodity. An important use is to combat soil erosion. It strengthens the soil, and is used for reforestation of arid and steep slopes and against landslides. It is stronger than Pistacia terebinthus, where it is used as rootstock in Ukraine and the United States for growing Pistacia vera, but resists frost better than P. Terebinthus. The resin is used to manufacture alcohol and lacquer. Its essential oils are used in perfume industry. The leaves are rich in tannins, up to 20% in the galls caused by an aphid parasite, used as the raw material for tanning in the leather industry. The sap is dried and used as incense, and its smoke releases a pleasant smell to the local environment for celebrations and religious ceremonies, as \\"incense\\". The tannins from the galls were used for tanning. Food The pistachio fruits are a food source in the area, but the more commonly cultivated pistachio tree P. vera is more valuable for food production. The seeds, like pistachio, are edible oil seeds, like nuts, and contain up to 60% fat. Candy made with P. atlantica in Turkish are called tsukpi pistachio. Sometimes, the immature fruit is harvested and eaten with sour milk. The plant contains a resin, used as chewing gum in Kevan, Turkey, where it is called kevove rubber tree. Mastic gum of the tree has been reported to have significant antimicrobial and antifungal activity. Twenty-six compounds in hexane extract were identified. The major compounds were Œ±-pinene 57.06%, Œ≤-pinene 9.83%, trans-pinocarveol 2.95%, trans-Verbenol 3.97%, Œ±-Phellandren-8-ol 3.81%.Amhamdi, H., Aouinti, F., Wathelet, J.P. and Elbachiri, A., 2009.

Furthermore, P. atlantica var. kurdica contained several chemical constitutes which have been reported as health benefits. Having a watery flavour, the resin from cultivar P. atlantica kurdica (found in Kurdistan) is used as a chewing gum to relieve upper abdominal discomfort, stomach aches, dyspepsia and peptic ulcer.Ahmed, H.M., 2017.

He was the son of Herman A. von Wende (1825‚Äì1892), a Colonel in the German Army, and Mary R. Wende (1833‚Äì1919). He was educated at the Millgrove, Clarence Union School, Buffalo Central School, and graduated with the first-ever law class of Cornell Law School at Cornell University in 1876. Career After reading law with Judge Cothran, Wende was admitted to the bar in 1877 and practiced law for 61 years, keeping his law office, Wende & Wende, at the Erie County Savings Bank. As a Democrat, he was a member of New York State Assembly (Erie Co., 7th D.) in 1909, beating Robert H. Reed.

It was powered by a 149-kilowatt (200-horsepower) SPA 6A water-cooled engine driving a two-bladed tractor propeller. It had fixed, tailskid landing gear.Green and Swanborough, pp. 478-479. The Gamma prototype first flew early in 1918. An Italian official commission observed a demonstration of it, and concluded that although it was fast and had good maneuverability, its rate of climb was insufficient to merit a production order.Green and Swanborough, pp. 478. Gamma IF Pomilio responded to the Gammas shortcomings by building a second prototype, the Gamma IF, fitted with a more powerful Isotta Fraschini V6 engine rated at 186 kilowatts (250 horsepower). An official commission saw a demonstration of the Gamma IF in 1918, but at first could not agree on whether it merited a production order. During the final weeks of World War I, the commission finally decided to order a small number of Gamma IF fighters, although the Gamma IF never entered active service.Green and Swanborough, pp. 478.

Mathematical contributions A 1988 monograph of BestvinaBestvina, Mladen, Characterizing k-dimensional universal Menger compacta. Memoirs of the American Mathematical Society, vol. 71 (1988), no. 380 gave an abstract topological characterization of universal Menger compacta in all dimensions; previously only the cases of dimension 0 and 1 were well understood. John Walsh wrote in a review of Bestvina's monograph: 'This work, which formed the author's Ph.D. thesis at the University of Tennessee, represents a monumental step forward, having moved the status of the topological structure of higher-dimensional Menger compacta from one of \\"close to total ignorance\\" to one of \\"complete understanding\\".'John J. Walsh, Review of: Bestvina, Mladen, Characterizing k-dimensional universal Menger compacta. Mathematical Reviews, MR0920964 (89g:54083), 1989 In a 1992 paper Bestvina and Feighn obtained a Combination Theorem for word-hyperbolic groups.M. Bestvina and M. Feighn, A combination theorem for negatively curved groups. Journal of Differential Geometry, Volume 35 (1992), pp. 85‚Äì101 The theorem provides a set of sufficient conditions for amalgamated free products and HNN extensions of word-hyperbolic groups to again be word-hyperbolic. The Bestvina‚ÄìFeighn Combination Theorem became a standard tool in geometric group theory and has had many applications and generalizations (e.g.EMINA ALIBEGOVIC, A COMBINATION THEOREM FOR RELATIVELY HYPERBOLIC GROUPS.

Topology, vol. 30 (1991), no. 2, pp. 143‚Äì154 that a finitely generated group G admits a free isometric action on an R-tree if and only if G is a free product of surface groups, free groups and free abelian groups. A 1992 paper of Bestvina and Handel introduced the notion of a train track map for representing elements of Out(Fn).Mladen Bestvina, and Michael Handel, Train tracks and automorphisms of free groups. Annals of Mathematics (2), vol. 135 (1992), no. 1, pp. 1‚Äì51 In the same paper they introduced the notion of a relative train track and applied train track methods to solve the Scott conjecture which says that for every automorphism Œ± of a finitely generated free group Fn the fixed subgroup of Œ± is free of rank at most n. Since then train tracks became a standard tool in the study of algebraic, geometric and dynamical properties of automorphisms of free groups and of subgroups of Out(Fn). Examples of applications of train tracks include: a theorem of BrinkmannP. Brinkmann, Hyperbolic automorphisms of free groups. Geometric and Functional Analysis, vol. 10 (2000), no. 5, pp. 1071‚Äì1089 proving that for an automorphism Œ± of Fn the mapping torus group of Œ± is word-hyperbolic if and only if Œ± has no periodic conjugacy classes; a theorem of Bridson and GrovesMartin R.

Inventiones Mathematicae, vol. 129 (1997), no. 3, pp. 445‚Äì470 Bestvina and Brady developed a version of discrete Morse theory for cubical complexes and applied it to study homological finiteness properties of subgroups of right-angled Artin groups. In particular, they constructed an example of a group which provides a counter-example to either the Whitehead asphericity conjecture or to the Eilenberg‚àíGanea conjecture, thus showing that at least one of these conjectures must be false. Brady subsequently used their Morse theory technique to construct the first example of a finitely presented subgroup of a word-hyperbolic group that is not itself word-hyperbolic.Brady, Noel, Branched coverings of cubical complexes and subgroups of hyperbolic groups.

It is a low-riding, rug-hugger breed with short legs and fur-pointed coat. They are described as having a small to medium-sized semi-cobby muscular body, a rounded head, large ears that are wide at the base, a short broad muzzle with prominent whisker pads and eyes that are large and round, spaced well apart, giving them an open alert expression. Their fur is a sparse rex-coat, which is more dense on their outer extremities, giving them a unique coat description of \\"fur-points\\" that defines the mask, ears, legs and tail, with a more sparsely coated cashmere- like torso. Minskin cats are often described as exotic and alien-like, they are sweet tempered and affectionate cats that are playful but not destructive. They are a healthy, small breed that require little grooming and get along with other animals, thrive on human interaction and are particularly fond of children.  History  In 1998, Paul Richard McSorley began the development of the Minskin cat breed in Boston, Massachusetts. Just as the Siamese has color restricted to the points/extremities, Paul McSorley envisioned a cat with short legs and denser fur restricted to the points (fur-points) on the mask, ears, legs and tail, with a noticeably more sparsely coated torso, neck and belly. To accomplish his goal, he crossed his already established Munchkin (show) cats with short legs (short legs are a naturally occurring physical anomaly, a healthy dominant gene) with a full coat of fur. He then introduced and combined 'fuzzy' Sphynx for the hairless characteristic (hairlessness is a cosmetic anomaly which is a naturally occurring, healthy recessive gene) but with denser fur restricted to the extremities, making for a healthier immune system. When combined, the two healthy mutation genes do not recognize each other and therefore do not cause any detrimental impact. For the appeal of structure, temperament, type and other desired qualities, he also used his International Award Winning Burmese cats and Devon Rex in the development of his Minskin breeding program. The first standard cat that met his goal was \\"TRT I Am Minskin Hear Me Roar\\" 'Rory' was born in July 2000. By early 2005 about 50 cats meeting the Minskin vision existed and were registered by The International Cat Association (TICA). In 2008, the Minskin became recognized as a Preliminary New Breed (PNB) and is currently in TICA's program that monitors the development of new breeds and their progress toward achieving the title of Advanced New Breed (ANB). Ultimately, when all requirements are met and with the approval of the BOD, the Minskin breed will advance in TICA with full recognition in the Championship class.
