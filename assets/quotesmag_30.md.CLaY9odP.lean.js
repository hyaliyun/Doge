The album was released on June 9, 2017 by Blue Note. Reception Michael J. West of JazzTimes wrote \\"Like many live jazz albums, A Rift in Decorum amplifies Ambrose Akinmusire's best qualities (his beautiful, penetrating trumpet sound and postbop melodies) as well as his worst (his proneness to being too hip for the room). It's hard to say which is more powerful. But given that the album stretches over two discs, Akinmusire's excesses may have the edge. Its high points are as good as anything the trumpeter has ever done.\\" Matt Collar of Allmusic noted \\"An expansive two-disc concert album, Ambrose Akinmusire's 2017 effort, A Rift in Decorum: Live at the Village Vanguard, is a sophisticated production on par with his previous studio recordings. Rather than returning to those familiar surroundings for his fourth album, Akinmusire instead brought his quartet to the Vanguard along with a set of newly penned original compositions. It's a purposeful choice that resonates with the long history of albums recorded at the storied Greenwich Village institution, most notably John Coltrane's classic, and at the time divisive, 1962 contribution, \\"Live\\" at the Village Vanguard. While Akinmusire has made a very different album from Coltrane's, A Rift in Decorum does find the trumpeter in a similarly challenging mood, balancing the highly introspective and cerebral nature of his studio albums with the unpredictable and often explosive nature of his live shows.\\" Frank Alkyer of DownBeat said \\"It's music that sneaks into your soul because whether fiery or quiet, nothing is ever rushed by these musicians; everything is thought out and purposeful... That depth of self-reflection makes Akinmusire an amazingly effective composer‚Äîone who should be heard, studied and enjoyed.\\" Track listing Disc 1 Disc 2 Personnel *Ambrose Akinmusire ‚Äì trumpet *Sam Harris ‚Äì piano *Harish Raghavan ‚Äì bass *Justin Brown ‚Äì drums Production *Jaeyeol Han ‚Äì artwork *Sydney Nichols ‚Äì design *Dave Darlington ‚Äì mixing, mastering *Geoffrey Countryman ‚Äì recording *Tyler McDiarmid ‚Äì recording References Category:2017 albums Category:Ambrose Akinmusire albums Category:Blue Note Records albums Category:Albums recorded at the Village Vanguard ","title":"A Rift in Decorum"},{"id":"57250734","text":"Pycnopsyche guttifera is a species of northern caddisfly in the family Limnephilidae.

These spiders are most commonly found in subtropical and tropical regions in South and Central America, as well as southern regions of the United States. One of the key distinguishing characteristics of A. elevatus is its kleptoparasitic behavior through which it primarily procures food for survival. Up to 45, but usually 1 or 2 A. elevatus spiders preside in outer areas of webs built by other species of spiders. There are two main mechanisms by which A. elevatus raid the hub of the host‚Äôs web to steal insects preyed and wrapped by the host spider. A. elevatus follows an intricate course to the hub of the web to search for prey, using vibrational detection enhanced by laid out threads along the web to find and capture the insect. These spiders are highly efficient, with the theft lasting a maximum of 12 seconds and high success rates. This reliance on a host spider for food has led to adaptations in sleep schedules and alternate food sources to revolve around the host species activity. A. elevatus display a unique courtship routine in which male A. elevatus presents prey wrapped in silk as a nuptial gift to the female spider. The male spider approaches the female, carrying the nuptial gift on its chelicerae while communicating with a distinct courting vibration, followed by copulation. Approximately twenty-four hours after the A. elevatus courtship and copulation series of events, the female spider will lay one to two eggs on the outer regions of the host's web.  Description  Argyrodes elevatus spiders' small bodies can be divided into two regions, the cephalothorax, which consists of the head and legs, and the abdomen. The head is usually a dark color, ranging from brown to black. The legs extending from this division are a lighter brown, with the ends of the legs returning to the darker color similar to the head. The second division, or the abdomen, has a silver, bulb-like, conical appearance with a dark line extending down the length of the spider. With the two divisions combined, the spider is approximately 4-7 mm in length. Females and males differ in shape. Males are smaller and have the abdominal division slightly lower than females, which are larger and have the abdomen pointing upwards.  Habitat and Distribution  Argyrodes elevatus are primarily found in Central America, South America, and the southern-most areas of the United States. Within the United States, Argyrodes elevatus spiders can be found spanning regions including California, Texas, Florida, and Virginia. Because of its preference for tropical and subtropical climates, large populations have been identified in Trinidad.  Diet  = Prey-capture = The bulk of the diet obtained by adult A. elevatus comes from stealing food from the host spider, such as host egg sacs or insects and other organisms trapped in the web silk threads. Small prey that have not yet been detected by the host spider can be easily stolen from the webs, while prey that have already been attacked and stored for later use may be more difficult to obtain. Larger prey ranging up to sizes ten times larger than it are have usually been previously predigested by the host spider prior to stealing. This behavior is attributed to age-related decreased ability to trap prey in silk thread due to either lack of sticky silk production or slower rate of wrapping. = Host Predation = Sometimes, A. elevatus does not steal an entire prey-packet from the hub of the host's web, and instead share it with the host at the hub. Furthermore, some A. elevatus spiders, particularly juvenile A. elevatus, feed on the host spider. This behavior is based on the differences in size and number of other caught prey available on the web. More specifically, predation is most common when there are fewer prey present in the host‚Äôs web and when the two spiders are similar in size. = Web Material = During shortages of regional prey-density, the host will protect its prey-packets from kleptoparasitic spiders even more, limiting the theft success rates and thus diminishing access to food for A. elevatus. Silk from the host's web can also provide a more stable food source, especially during these periods of low success in prey-capture. Even when A. elevatus is successful in capturing the host's insects, web material may also serve as an additional source of nutrition.  Reproduction  Approximately twenty-four hours after the A. elevatus courtship and copulation series of events, the female spider will lay one to two eggs on the outer regions of the host's web. The eggs are embedded on thread structures in these regions, and then left without any parental protection immediately.  Mating  = Male- Female Interactions =  Nuptial Gifts  During courtship, male A. elevatus presents a nuptial gift, often prey wrapped in silk, to the female. One example of prey offered as the nuptial gift is C. huila. The male spider approaches the female, carrying the nuptial gift on its chelicerae while communicating with a distinct courting vibration. This sequence is different from other spider species that engage in this behavior. This sequence of courtship events, followed by copulation between the two spiders, may last between two to eight hours. This is the longest duration activity within the species, as other interactions range mainly between three seconds to six minutes. = Pheromones = Recent studies have found novel long-chain fatty acid esters, containing unique functional groups, that may point towards their role in chemical communication between A. elevatus spiders. However, more investigation is required to further examine this finding and its relevance in the mating behavior of A. elevatus.  Behavior  = Kleptoparasitism = Argyrodes elevatus presides in the outer area of webs built by the Argiope argentata and Nephila clavipes spiders, which are two types of araneid spiders. Up to 45 A. elevatus spiders may be present on a single web depending on the season and host-spider density in the region. There are two main mechanisms by which A. elevatus steals both small and large prey from the host spiders that differ in the timing of the raid. In one strategy, A. elevatus moves towards the center of the web, or the hub, once the host spider has wrapped an insect to immobilize it and leaves to capture another insect. The second strategy follows similar steps, but A. elevatus instead waits for multiple insects to be wrapped into a prey-packet prior to rushing towards the hub to steal the host's captured prey. Studies have shown that the first strategy is more commonly employed by the kleptoparasitic spiders due to higher success rates.  Mechanism of Prey-capture  A. elevatus spiders sense vibrations along the threads of the web to detect silk wrapping of prey by the host spider. In order to best detect these vibrations, A. elevatus produces fine threads that are spread out along the web's radii, including the hub where the prey most-likely reside. These signals are detected by moving its long front legs in a forward and then sideways direction to tap the threads as it slowly moves. The slow movements are aimed to reduce the chances of alerting the host spider of its approach. Once the vibrational cues signal the presence of captured prey, the spider is then triggered to move towards the prey to procure for its own food supply. Studies have suggested that chemotaxis may also play a role in locating the captured prey.  Securing Prey-capture  Once the prey is identified with the front legs of A. elevatus, various threads are drawn. One thread secures the wrapped prey-packet or single insect to be placed into its chelicerae, while the other threads are placed to direct the spider back to the outer safe regions of the web. These escape threads can be followed after A. elevatus cuts up to 4 cm sections of the host's web threads to detach the prey and retreat. The entire raid, from finding the prey to securing the theft for return to the outskirts, has been seen to be completed in less than twelve seconds on certain occasions.  Success of Prey-capture  If host spiders sense the loss of their stored prey, they may attempt to search the hub for the intruding kleptoparasite and disrupt the theft by aggressively shaking the threads, causing A. elevatus to be shaken off the thread or to retreat. However, it is more common for the host to retrieve the captured prey by intercepting the theft. Studies have shown that A. elevatus are highly successful at capturing prey without being intercepted by the host. One experiment showed an approximate success rate of 67%. = Sleeping Patterns = Because of its kleptoparasitic behavior, A. elevatus has opposite patterns of sleep-wake cycles and activity than its host. These host spiders are often diurnal, making A. elevatus most commonly nocturnal. However, this can change if there are multiple species of spiders with different periods of activity. Monitoring host activity is achieved by sensing vibrations within the web signaling host movement.

Other common names include the wide-headed rottenwood termite and southwestern rottenwood termite. It is found in arid parts of southwestern North America. Species of Zootermopsis are difficult to tell apart; one means of doing so is by analysis of the cuticle hydrocarbons, but that method has its limitations, and it transpires that near-infrared spectroscopy can separate species and subspecies with an accuracy of over 99%. Distribution and habitat Zootermopsis laticeps occurs in North America, its range extending from Arizona and New Mexico to northern Mexico. The termites live in rotting wood, in standing trees in riparian locations; the moisture present in the standing trees may be critical to their survival, as they are not found in fallen logs or tree stumps. Host trees include Populus, Salix and Platanus. Life cycle A colony is usually founded by a winged male and female termite after a nuptial flight. Having discarded their wings, the reproductives choose a suitable tree with an area of dead wood and create a chamber under the bark, often entering through a beetle hole. The first egg develops into a small soldier termite, recognisable by its dark head and slashing mandibles; soldiers protect the colony from other termites and from marauding ants. The next eggs develop into workers, which expand the colony by chewing into the wood that surrounds them. When the dead wood is exhausted, the colony will die out. As they continue to grow and moult, some of the workers may develop into full-sized soldiers, while others may begin to grow wingbuds, finally differentiating into primary reproductives; these become more numerous when the colony's resources are nearly depleted. Another group of workers may develop into golden-coloured wingless, secondary reproductives; this normally happens after the death of the primary reproductives, perhaps through strife with neighbouring colonies which often results in the two colonies merging. Merged colonies may contain numerous secondary reproductives. Ecology The diet consists primarily of rotten wood, with symbiotic bacteria and protozoa present in the gut helping them to digest the cellulose. They will also consume injured members of their colony, and opportunistically, termites from other colonies.

Biography  Born in Dinard of an architect father and a musician mother, Delaage played at a very young age in front of Alfred Cortot who offered to become her private teacher. Resigning from the Conservatoire de Paris, where she had just been unanimously received in first position, she followed the teaching of the master, famous co-founder of the √âcole normale de musique de Paris. A friend of Dino Ciani, a young Italian pianist who died prematurely, she also received technical advice from Gy√∂rgy Cziffra, before pursuing a career as an international concert performer. Although she performed in Paris, salle Gaveau, salle Pleyel and at the Th√©√¢tre des Champs-√âlys√©es, she performed mainly and more extensively outside France, in particular in Germany, Austria, Italy, Argentina and the United States, where she regularly gives masterclasses. Every year she plays Wagner-Liszt's transcriptions at Bayreuth. Although for a long time there were few recordings available, a concert she gave in 2001 at the New Theatre of Turin was the subject of a CD, with pieces by Chopin, Ravel and Debussy. In addition, several reference CDs were produced in early 2010. This pianist, whom Gy√∂rgy Cziffra considered an \\"exceptional artist\\", is renowned for her great musicality and extreme delicacy.\\"C comme Chopin\\", in Improvisation so piano, Jean-Pierre Thiollet, 2017, . Alfred Cortot bequeathed to her his pianos, after saying of her: \\"If I had a daughter, she would have been Florence Delaage\\". On 11 March 2008, she gave a recital in Paris, Salle Gaveau, with works by Beethoven, Chopin and Wagner- Liszt. On the occasion of the disappearance fifty years ago of Alfred Cortot, she gave a concert on 15 June 2012 at the Temple Saint Marcel,Temple Saint- Marcel in the 5th arrondissement of Paris.

This was the document voted on by the UN General Assembly on 29 November 1947, and became known as the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine.A/PV.128 Minutes of the 128th meeting, page 1424, \\"We shall now proceed to vote by roll-call on the report of the Ad Hoc Committee (document A/516). A vote was taken by roll-call... The report was adopted by 33 votes to 13, with 10 abstentions.\\" The Ad Hoc Committee on the Palestinian Question, also known as the Ad Hoc Committee on Palestine or just the Ad Hoc Committee was a committee formed by a vote of the United Nations General Assembly on 23 September 1947, following the publication of the report of the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine (UNSCOP) on 3 September 1947, which contained majority and minority proposals. The Committee was chaired by H. V. Evatt, who was later to write in his memoirs: \\"I regard the establishment of Israel as a great victory of the United Nations.\\" The General Assembly vote for the formation of the committee was 29 to 11, with 16 abstaining. The creation of the committee was strongly opposed by Arab states, who wanted the question referred to the UN Political Committee, since according to Lebanon's Charles Malik, an Ad Hoc Committee would be more susceptible to the influence of ‚Äúcertain pressure groups‚Äù.U.N. Assembly Establishes Ad Hoc Committee on Palestine; Will Start Meetings Thursday, JTA, September 24, 1947 Two subcommittees were created on 22 October to assess the UNSCOP majority and minority proposals. These subcommittees were broadly mutually exclusive, and the second subcommittee, composed primarily of Arab states and with the Higher Arab Committee advising, was largely ignored. The Committee  Abba Hillel Silver, Chairman of the American Section of the Jewish Agency, made the case for a Jewish State to the Ad Hoc Committee and announced on behalf of the Jewish Agency acceptance of 10 of the eleven unanimous recommendations of the UN Partition Plan and rejection of the minority report. Of the majority report (the Partition Plan areas), Silver vacillates saying that he was prepared to ‚Äúrecommend to the Jewish people acceptance subject to further discussion of the constitutional and territorial provisions‚Äù.UN Doc Dr Abba Hillel Silver address to the Ad Hoc Committee While three members endorsed a federal state (the minority report) similar to the Morrison-Grady Plan that had been rejected by both Jews and Arabs and the UNSCOP found that a canton system ‚Äúmight easily entail an excessive fragmentation of the governmental processes, and in its ultimate result, would be quite unworkable.‚Äù No members of the UNSCOP endorsed a one-state solution as recommended by the Arab Higher Committee and on 29 September Jamal al- Husayni, vice-president of the Arab Higher Committee, announced opposition to the UN Partition Plan. Subcommittees On 22 October the Ad Hoc Committee formed two subcommittees. Subcommittee 1 comprised nine members and was responsible for producing a plan of implementation of the UNSCOP majority report; and subcommittee 2 was composed of six Arab delegates and three supporters of the minority plan and reviewed the UNSCOP minority report which was a plan for a single federal Palestinian state, with Jewish and Arab provinces and a split Jerusalem as federal capital. The reports of subcommittee 111 November 1947 UN Doc A/AC.14/34 Sub-committee 1 and subcommittee 211 November 1947 UN Doc A/AC.14/42 Sub-committee 2 were delivered on 19 November 1947. Subcommittee 2 wanted the International Court of Justice to be asked for an advisory opinion on relevant legal questions. At the request of the representative of France, two votes were taken, one on the first seven questions, the other on the eighth question, which read as follows: :Whether the United Nations, or any of its Member States, is competent to enforce, or recommend the enforcement of, any proposal concerning the constitution and future government of Palestine, in particular, any plan of partition which is contrary to the wishes, or adopted without the consent, of the inhabitants of Palestine. In respect of the seven questions, this was rejected by a vote of eighteen in favour, twenty-five against, with eleven abstentions and in respect of the eighth question, this was rejected by a vote of twenty in favour, twenty-one against, with thirteen abstentions.https://unispal.un.org/DPA/DPR/unispal.nsf/0/CB265C939B5A551F802564B40053D359 A/516 25 November 1947 REPORT OF THE AD HOC COMMITTEE ON THE PALESTINIAN QUESTION The Ad Hoc Committee rejected the subcommittee 2 resolution to constitute a unitary Palestinian state and accepted the proposed partition plan of subcommittee 1. Subsequent events Britain was unwilling to implement a policy that was not acceptable to both sides and so refused to share with the UN Palestine Commission the administration of Palestine during the transitional period and on 20 November 1947 the British Government informed the UN of a timetable for evacuating Palestine. On the Termination of the Mandate, Partition And Independence. Britain as the Mandatory Power was to use its best endeavours to ensure that an area situated in the territory of the Jewish State, including a seaport and hinterland adequate to provide facilities for a substantial immigration, was to be evacuated at the earliest possible date and in any event not later than 1 February 1948.UN Resolution 181 Avalon Project Ad Hoc Committee on the Palestinian Question : report of Sub-Committee 1Press Release of Ad Hoc Committee On 29 November 1947 the UN General Assembly recommended the adoption and implementation of a plan substantially in the form of The Plan of Partition with Economic Union in CHAPTER VI: PROPOSED RECOMMENDATIONS (II), as Resolution 181 (II).

History The mock-up that was installed at the site in 1911 Construction of the third and current Christiansborg Palace began in 1907 after the second Christiansborg Palace had been destroyed in a fire in 1884. Following Christian IX's death on 29 January 1906, it was decided to commemorate him with an equestrian statue that would complement the equestrian statue of Frederick VII in front of the palace. An invited competition held in 1908 was won by Anne Marie Carl- Nielsen. She found the model for the horse in Hannover, Germany. A wooden mockup of the sculpture was installed at Christiansborg Ridebane in 1911. The statue was cast in royal bronze caster Carl and Poul Lauritz Rasmussen's foundry in N√∏rrebro. The plinth was designed by the architect Andreas Clemmesen and executed in stone carver Scheller's workshop. The monument was unveiled on 15 November 1927.

William Wallace is said to have drunk from the well whenever he visited the area and also just before his capture by English troops commanded by Sir John Mentieth. History Seal of John de Monteith (c.1297) Statue of William Wallace in Ayr. The Scots bard Blind Harry first mentioned the Wallace Well in his poem The Actes and Deidis of the Illustre and Vallyeant Campioun Schir William Wallace, better known as The Wallace. The well stands close to the barn where, on the 3rd of August, 1305, Wallace was passing through 'Rab or Ralph Rae's Toun', now Robroyston, on a journey to Glasgow, possibly to meet the Bishop of Glasgow, Robert Wishart in connection with the need for funds to continue the fight for Scottish Independence. The farm's owner, Rab or Ralph Rae, may have been the one who betrayed William Wallace to Sir John Menteith (aka Sir John Stewart of Menteith) who had made an arrangement with Sir Aymer Vallance, the commander of the English troops. After his capture by English troops he was taken to London via Dumbarton Castle where he was tried and executed. Another version by the English chronicler Piers Langtoft records that Sir John captured Wallace through the treacherous information of Jack Short, Wallace's body servant, and that he came in the dead of night and seized him in his bed. Wallace is said to have killed Jack Short's brother and this act of betrayal was his revenge. However, another source states that it may have been Ralph Haliburton, one of his men who had been released from prison and who was later rewarded for spying on Wallace. Kerlie, a faithful friend and follower, was killed near the well. Some people think that the well was where that he was taken prisoner. The alternative name 'Auchinleck Well' refers to the farm of Auchinleck rather that the Laird of Auchinleck who was a supporter of William Wallace. =Other Wallace's Wells= A gargoyle of 'False Menteith' at Dumbarton Castle. Another Wallace's Well near Elcho Castle in Perth and Kinross got its name from the water from it being Sir William Wallace's favourite drink while he was staying residing at the castle. Dunfermline has a Wallace's Well in which he is said to have hidden briefly from English troops after the Battle of Falkirk. In 1303 he visited Dunfermline, accompanied by his mother, with the intention of praying at the shrine of St Margaret. Ayr has Wallace's Heel Well that derives from an incident that occurred when Wallace was hiding in the Leglen Woods near Auchencruive.  Description of the well site An old photograph shows the well with a hand-operated cast- iron water pump to the right-hand side of the well opening, indicating that it was a regular and dependable source of water for those living locally, and a gap in the low wall shows that a flow existed at the time; however, now (datum 2018) it is very shallow and partly exposed mud. In 1923 a line drawing shows the well much as it is today (datum 2019); however, the low wall at the entrance was a low metal railing with three vertical supports. The well has seen many changes over the years, the present appearance originating from around 1911, the previous structure having had a stone with an inscription commemorative of the crucial year 1305. The well is Set in a curved alcove in a simply built stone wall by the roadside with the Gadburn flowing in front. A pink granite lintel over the well now reads 'Wallace's Well'. The well was listed in 1970; however, the listing was removed in 2001 as the association with William Wallace is held by some to be of quite recent origin. The well site came under threat from a housing development of more than 800 houses. Restoration of the site was undertaken in June 2011 with re-turfing of the Wallace Well area. Wallace's Cross Wallace's Well and the Gadburn The building where the capture of William Wallace, previously the Guardian of Scotland, traditionally took place was demolished in the 19th century and a cross erected on the site (NS 63415 69338) on August 4, 1900. This barn or cottage at Robroyston reportedly survived until around 1826 and the buildings foundations could be seen for a time after, located to the east of the present day monument. Roof timbers from the building were however rescued and made into a chair by Sir Walter Scott and can be seen at Abbotsford House. The tall pink granite cross was carved by McGlashen, sculptors, Edinburgh and has the same form as St Martin's cross, Iona. The monument is elevated high up on a granite plinth and surrounded by plain iron railings. It was unveiled by Miss Emmeline McKerlie, a direct descendant of Kerlie, Wallace's faithful companion. Cadder Parish Council were the guardians of the monument and around a thousand people were present at the opening. John B. Calder, of Muirhead was responsible for the ancillary work including laying the foundations, erecting the railings, and building the boundary wall with its little stone ball ornamentation. The wall around the Memorial Cross was rebuilt and a commemorative plaque was also added by Convener, David R. Ross. A bench has been placed at the site that is a double seater version of one said to have belonged to Wallace and now (datum 2018) at Balnagowan Castle, Ross-shire.

A total of six different classes comprising eighteen vessels were constructed. The first vessel, , was laid down in 1875, and was one of the first torpedo cruisers built by any navy. She proved to be a disappointment in service, being too slow to be an effective warship. Pietro Micca was followed by the more successful design, , which provided the basis for the four s and the eight-vessel . The four Goitos were built on an experimental basis, with being used as the basis for the Partenopes. While those vessels were being built, a pair of smaller vessels‚Äîthe ‚Äîwere ordered. The final class, which comprised and , was built in the late 1890s to be fleet scouts. Like Pietro Micca, the Agordat class were too slow for their intended role. Most of the Italian torpedo cruisers served during the relatively uneventful 1880s, 1890s, and 1900s, and as a result, saw little activity outside of routine training operations. By the early 1900s, many of the cruisers had been reduced to subsidiary roles or had been discarded outright. A handful of vessels, specifically of the Partenope and Agordat classes, were still in front-line service by the time of the Italo-Turkish War in 1911‚Äì1912, and they saw action primarily as coastal bombardment vessels supporting Italian forces operating in North Africa. The surviving vessels still in service during World War I saw no offensive operations, though four‚ÄîTripoli, , , and ‚Äîthat had been converted into minelayers, were employed to help blockade the Austro-Hungarian Navy in the Adriatic Sea. Partenope was torpedoed and sunk by a German U-boat in March 1918, the only Italian torpedo cruiser to be lost to hostile action. Long since obsolete by the early 1920s, the remaining torpedo cruisers were then sold for scrap. Their place in the fleet's reconnaissance force was taken by a group of German and Austro-Hungarian light cruisers that were acquired as war reparations. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"float: right; margin: 0 0 0 1em;\\" + Key - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Armament  The number and type of the primary armament - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Armor  The maximum thickness of the deck armor - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Displacement  Ship displacement at full combat load - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Propulsion  Number of shafts, type of propulsion system, and top speed generated - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Service  The dates work began and finished on the ship and its ultimate fate - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Laid down  The date the keel assembly commenced - ! scope=\\"row\\"  Commissioned  The date the ship was commissioned } __TOC__ Pietro Micca In the aftermath of the Italian fleet's defeat at the Battle of Lissa in 1866, the Italian parliament drastically reduced naval budgets.Sondhaus, pp. 49‚Äì50 By the 1870s, the small budgets precluded the acquisition of a large battle fleet centered on new ironclads like the then under construction, and so Admiral Simone Antonio Saint-Bon, then the Italian Minister of the Navy, ordered a small, fast vessel that was armed with torpedoes. The experimental vessel was to provide the basis for further such ships, which would increase the combat power of the Regia Marina at a fraction of the cost of a new ironclad. The new vessel was one of the first torpedo cruisers to be built by any navy. Her flat-bottomed hull prevented her from reaching her intended speed, which meant that she would be unable to catch the ironclads she was intended to destroy. She spent little time in active service as a result, and the Italian navy did not build another torpedo cruiser for almost another decade. In November 1893, the navy sold the vessel and she was subsequently broken up.Osborne, pp. 36‚Äì37 { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" + Summary of the Pietro Micca class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  ArmamentGardiner, p. 346 ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armor ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  1 √ó torpedo tube   1 shaft, single-expansion steam engine,  15 February 1875  3 July 1877  Broken up, 1893 } Tripoli Tripoli after her modernization By the mid-1880s, Engineering Inspector Benedetto Brin‚Äîthe designer of the Caio Duilio and s‚Äîhad begun to experiment with the ideas of the Jeune √âcole, which emphasized small, fast, torpedo-armed vessels that could damage or destroy the much larger battleships at a fraction of the cost. His first experiment was a new torpedo cruiser that was to correct the defects of Pietro Micca, most importantly her slow speed. The new vessel, Tripoli, was nearly faster than Pietro Micca, and she carried five torpedo tubes to Pietro Miccas single tube, significantly increasing her offensive power. She was so successful that she proved to be the basis for twelve more similar vessels of the and es built over the following decade.Sondhaus, p. 149Gardiner, pp. 346‚Äì347 Tripoli served with the Italian fleet until 1910, during which time she participated in extensive fleet training exercises that helped to develop Italian naval doctrine and tactics.Brassey (1889), p. 453Barry, p. 133 She was modernized in 1897‚Äì1898, receiving new boilers and a modified bow, among other changes.Garbett, p. 200 In 1910, she was converted into a minelayer. She served in this capacity during the Italo-Turkish War of 1911‚Äì1912 but she saw no action during the conflict.Beehler, p. 11 She remained in service through World War I, during which the Italian fleet made extensive use of minefields to keep the Austro- Hungarian Navy contained in the narrow waters of the Adriatic Sea. Tripoli remained in the fleet's inventory until 1923, when she was discarded and broken up for scrap. By that time, she was the last Italian torpedo cruiser, having served for more than thirty-six years.Halpern, pp. 141‚Äì142 { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" + Summary of the Tripoli class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armor ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  5 √ó torpedo tubes 1 √ó gun   3 shafts, double-expansion steam engines,  10 June 1885  1 December 1886  Broken up, 1923 } Goito class Goito early in her career with canvas awnings erected, c. early 1890s Brin continued his experimentation with the Goito class, adopting different hull forms, propulsion systems, and light gun batteries to determine the most effective configuration for the new warship type. He was joined in this task by Engineering Director Giacinto Pullino, who prepared the design for . Despite their variations, all were broadly similar to Tripoli, upon which their designs were based. The follow-on Partenope class adopted the two-shaft engine arrangement that had been used in Confienza, along with her gun armament suite, which included a single gun; she was the only member of the class to carry a medium-caliber gun. Like Tripoli, the four Goitos served with the fleet and participated in training exercises. These exercises frequently gamed the problem of a French naval attack on various Italian ports, France then being Italy's most likely adversary, owing to Italy's membership in the Triple Alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary. When not conducting maneuvers, the ships were frequently placed in reserve to reduce operational costs.Clarke & Thursfield, pp. 202‚Äì203 By the late 1890s, the ships began to be withdrawn from frontline service, with Goito being converted into a minelayer in 1897, Montebello becoming a training ship in 1898; Monzambano and Confienza were simply stricken from the register in 1901 and sold for scrap. During World War I, Goito supported the minelaying operations against Austria-Hungary,O'Hara, Dickson, & Worth, p. 201 and she and Montebello were both discarded after the war in 1920. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" + Summary of the Goito class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  ArmamentGardiner, p. 347 ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armor ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  rowspan=\\"3\\"  5 √ó 14 in torpedo tubes  rowspan=\\"4\\"  1.5 in  rowspan=\\"4\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\"  3 shafts, double-expansion steam engines,  September 1885  16 February 1888  Broken up, 1920 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  25 September 1885  14 March 1888  Broken up, 1920 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  3 shafts, triple-expansion steam engines, 18 kn  25 August 1885  14 March 1888  Broken up, 1901 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  5 √ó 14 in torpedo tubes 1 √ó 4.7 in gun  2 shafts, double-expansion steam engines,  September 1887  11 April 1890  Broken up, 1901 } Folgore class Saetta at anchor The next class of torpedo cruisers built for the Italian fleet, the Folgore class, marked further experimentation on the part of Brin. These two ships were significantly smaller than the other torpedo cruisers Brin designed, though they still carried an armament of three torpedo tubes, and they were nearly as fast as the Goitos. They were not particularly successful vessels and their design was not repeated in future torpedo cruisers. The ships had uneventful careers, though this was in part due to the fact that Folgore was badly damaged in a collision with the protected cruiser early in her career, and she could not be repaired to her original configuration. Saetta was frequently placed in reserve,\\"Naval and Military Notes ‚Äì Italy\\" (1895), p. 90\\"Naval and Military Notes ‚Äì Italy\\" (1893), p. 567\\"Naval and Military Notes ‚Äì Italy\\" (1894), p. 565 and in 1897 she became a gunnery training ship.

Nevertheless, the design staff decided to standardize on the two-shaft arrangement adopted for Confienza, since it was a simpler and cheaper solution if it did not match the speed of the three-shaft systems. And with more powerful engines, the Partenope-class cruisers were faster than the three-shaft Goitos, reaching speeds as high as . For their gun armament, the Partenopes also adopted the battery installed on Confienza, since the medium-caliber significantly increased her combat power. The designers conducted further tests with the ships' armaments, and Caprera received a second 4.7-inch gun. Like the other Italian torpedo cruisers, the Partenope class spent much of its career with the fleet conducting training exercises.Brassey (1903), p. 60 In the 1890s, Partenope and Euridice participated in naval demonstrations off Crete in attempts by the Great Powers to prevent conflicts between Greece and the Ottoman Empire over control of the island.Neal, p. 355Robinson, p. 187 By the mid-1900s, the class began to be withdrawn from front-line service. Partenope and Minerva were converted into minelayers in 1906‚Äì1908 and 1909‚Äì1910, respectively, and Calatafimi and Euridice were sold for scrap in 1907. Several members of the class saw action during the Italo-Turkish War, primarily shelling Ottoman positions in North Africa.Beehler, pp. 35, 47‚Äì48 Aretusa briefly engaged the Ottoman torpedo cruiser in the Red Sea.Stephenson, p. 62 After the war, the navy discarded Aretusa, Urania, and Caprera. The three surviving members of the class, Partenope, Minerva, and Iride, continued in service during World War I, but they saw limited activity due to the cautious strategy adopted by the Italian fleet. The two minelayers were tasked with laying defensive minefields in the Adriatic, and on 24 March 1918, the German U-boat UC-67 torpedoed and sank Partenope off Bizerte.Willmott, p. 426 Minerva and Iride were both scrapped in the early 1920s. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" + Summary of the Partenope class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armament ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armor ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  5 √ó torpedo tubes 1 √ó 4.7 in gun  rowspan=\\"8\\"  rowspan=\\"8\\"  rowspan=\\"8\\"  2 shafts, triple-expansion steam engines,  8 June 1888  11 September 1890  Sunk, 24 March 1918 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  rowspan=\\"5\\"  6 √ó 17.7 in torpedo tubes 1 √ó 4.7 in gun  1 February 1889  20 August 1892  Broken up, 1921 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  14 February 1889  1 May 1891  Broken up, 1907 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  16 February 1889  21 July 1893  Broken up, 1912 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  21 February 1889  1 November 1892  Broken up, 1920 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  1 June 1889  1 September 1892  Broken up, 1912 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  5 √ó 17.7 in torpedo tubes 2 √ó 4.7 in guns  27 July 1891  12 December 1895  Broken up, 1913 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  6 √ó 17.7 in torpedo tubes 1 √ó 4.7 in gun  15 September 1891  16 January 1894  Broken up, 1907 } Agordat class Coatit later in her career The design for the Agordat class was prepared in the mid-1890s, with work beginning on the two new cruisers in early 1897. The two new cruisers were significantly larger than previous designs, though they discarded the medium-caliber guns that had been adopted in the Partenope design. The thickness of armor protection and the number of torpedo tubes were reduced as well. Intended to be scouts for the main battle fleet, Agordat and Coatit nevertheless proved to be too slow in service to be usable in that role. As a result, their careers were limited. They saw action during the Italo-Turkish War, where they provided gunfire support to Italian troops in North Africa.Beehler, p. 47 Neither ship saw combat during World War I, and after the war, they were withdrawn from fleet service. The Italian fleet received a group of former German and Austro-Hungarian light cruisers as war reparations, and these vessels replaced the torpedo and protected cruisers in the fleet's reconnaissance forces in the 1920s. Coatit became a minelayer, while Agordat was reclassified as a gunboat, in 1919 and 1920, respectively. Neither ship remained in service for very long, with Coatit being sold for scrap a year after her conversion, and Agordat joining her in 1923.Gardiner & Gray, pp. 253‚Äì254 { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align: center;\\" + Summary of the Agordat class - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Ship ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  ArmamentGardiner, p. 348 ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Armor ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Displacement ! scope=\\"col\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  Propulsion ! scope=\\"col\\" colspan=\\"3\\"  Service - valign=\\"top\\" ! scope=\\"col\\"  Laid down ! scope=\\"col\\"  Commissioned ! scope=\\"col\\"  Fate - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\"  2 √ó 17.7 in torpedo tubes  rowspan=\\"2\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\"  rowspan=\\"2\\"  2 shafts, triple-expansion steam engines,  18 February 1897  26 September 1900  Broken up, 1923 - valign=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"row\\"  8 April 1897  1 October 1900  Broken up, 1920 } See also * List of protected cruisers of Italy * List of heavy cruisers of Italy Notes References       Neal, William George, ed.

Little by little, Jean-Philippe M√©th√©lie made a name for himself in the French championship, particularly with his three-point shots. In 1991, the Martiniquan took part in the World Military Games and became World Champion with the Blues. He stayed at Montpellier until 1993. = Olympique d'Antibes, from 1993 to 1996 = Then, Jean-Philippe M√©th√©lie left to join Olympique d'Antibes, coached by Jacques Monclar. In his first season at Antibes (1993-1994), he took part in high-level European competition, in the FIBA Koraƒá Cup. In 1995, M√©th√©lie won the French Championship at Pau with the score at 80 to 81, with a buzzer-beater from Michael Ray Richardson, former NBA star for the New Jersey Nets. Antibes then took part in the EuroLeague. The 1995-1996 season was his best, with an average of 10.2 points, 3.7 rebounds, 0.8 interceptions and 1.1 decisive passes. In 1996, he left Antibes to join Cholet Basket. = Pitch Cholet from 1996 to 1998 = Cholet signed Jean- Philippe M√©th√©lie for the 1996-1997 season. He showed that he was both a fantastic team player, but also a defensive master. Cholet finished 6th, and qualified for the FIBA Koraƒá Cup. The 1997-1998 season was very good for M√©th√©lie and his team. Cholet finished third in the French Championship, with a total of 20 wins, 10 defeats. M√©th√©lie averaged 11.3 points, trois rebounds, two decisive passes and 1.1 interceptions per match. In the same season, he had the best three-point percentage with 59.5% (41 of 72 attempts). At the end of the season, he left to join Limoges CSP. In 1998, he = Limoges CSP from 1998 to 2004 = M√©th√©lie was recruited by Limoges CSP. Jean-Philippe stayed CSP for the rest of his career. In his first season at Limoges, CSP did not perform well. The Cercle Saint-Pierre didn't make the top 3 for the league, finishing 7th. In the FIBA Saporta Cup, Limoges were eliminated in the last 16 by R√©gion Wallonne. M√©th√©lie also had a poor season personally. However, in the following season, (1999-2000) he improved. Limoges had an exceptional season. In contrast to the 1999-2000 season, CSP recorded the best passing statistics since the start of the 1990s. The players took financial sacrifices to ensure the continuing survival of the club. The club was at risk of folding. Beaublanc and the Cercle Saint-Pierre players believed each match could be their last. This desperation and drive led to the players winning the FIBA Koraƒá Cup against Malaga, and the coupe de France against PSG Racing, and finally the French Championship, against Asvel. CSP won the treble.https://www.sudouest.fr/2017/01/15/basket-les-images-cultes-de-l- eternelle-rivalite-entre-l-elan-bearnais-et-le-csp-limoges-3095737-5138.php Despite M√©th√©lie and his team making history for the club, they were relegated to Pro B due to budget issues. M√©th√©lie alone of the treble winners re-signed for the 2000 season. He became captain of Limoges CSP. The 2000-2001 season saw them promoted back to the Pro A without much difficulty. M√©th√©lie again had a good statistical average of over 10 points, almost 5 rebounds and 3 passes per match. M√©th√©lie's final three seasons at CSP were difficult. The yellow and garnets of Limoges struggled to maintain their position, while still trying to repay debt behind the scenes. In 2004, M√©th√©lie was injured, and Limoges finished last (2003-2004 season) and were relegated beyond Pro B due to the large financial difficulties at the club. Eventually, it was agreed that Limoges would play in the NM1 rather than the NM3, as initially agreed.

It has three dark green leaves at its base and up to fifteen greenish, insect-like flowers with dark reddish black glands on its labellum. This species is known by some authorities as Phoringopsis byrnesii. Description Arthrochilus byrnesii is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, sympodial herb with an underground tuber which produces daughter tubers on the end of root-like stolons. It usually has three dark green leaves, one large and one or two smaller, each leaf long and wide. Between five and fifteen greenish, insect-like flowers long are well spaced along a flowering stem tall. The dorsal sepal is long, about wide and the lateral sepals are long and about wide. The petals are long and about wide and curved. The petals and lateral sepals turn backwards against the ovary and are inconspicuous. The labellum is about long and and held above the flower. The callus is about long, about wide, covered with many spiky, bristly hair-like glands with a glandular tip is about wide. Flowering occurs in March and April. Taxonomy and naming Arthrochilus byrnesii was first formally described in 1972 by Donald Blaxell from a specimen collected near the South Alligator River. The description was published in Contributions from the New South Wales National Herbarium from a specimen collected by Norman Byrnes. In 2002 David Jones and Mark Clements changed the name of this orchid to Phoringopsis byrnesii, but the name has not been adopted by some authorities. Distribution and habitat The sandstone truffle orchid is a rarely seen species which grows around sandstone boulders and in tussocks of spinifex in the north of the Northern Territory and the Kimberley region of Western Australia. Ecology As with other Arthrochilus orchids, A. byrnesii is pollinated by male thynnid wasps of the genus Arthrothynnus although the species involved is not known. It also reproduces asexually by producing new tubers.

He was a member of the groupe colonial, in favour of expanding and consolidating the French colonial empire and opposed to the rival British Empire. He portrayed the British as oppressive despots compared to the civilized and tolerant French. Life =Family= Fran√ßois Deloncle was born on 14 August 1856 in Cahors, Lot. His family had provided many lawyers and judges to the Parliament of Toulouse. He was related to a Deputy of C√¥tes-du-Nord at the National Convention, great- grandson of a Deputy of Lot in 1809 and grandson of a president of the Cahors Court. His parents were Antoine Joseph Eug√®ne Deloncle (1829‚Äì1887) and Anne Madeleine Ad√®le Caroline Jos√©phine Lathelize (born 1832). His father was a university professor who had resigned after the 2 December 1851 coup d'√©tat and had been deported to Algeria for refusing to take the oath.

His dispatches were embellished and enlivened by Octave Mirbeau and published under the pseudonym \\"Nirvana\\" in 11 instalments in Le Gaulois between 22 February and 22 April 1885. They take the form of 11 letters written by a traveller who visits Aden, Ceylon, the French colony of Pondicherry, Peshawar and Darjeeling. It is a work of propaganda, in which the anonymous author contrasts the brutal oppression of British colonialism with the civilized tolerance of the French.

The fighting between the German pacification forces under J√ºrgen Stroop, which were destroying the ghetto, and the Jewish insurgent forces of ≈ªZW, under Pawe≈Ç Frenkel, took place in the now non-existent Muran√≥w Square. According to the accounts of two soldiers of the - and Henryk Iwa≈Ñski - the fighting was resumed on 27‚Äì28 April 1943 and a Polish unit of the Security Corps was to participate in it at that time.  History  = Origins = After the liquidation of the Warsaw ghetto, carried out by the Nazis in the summer of 1942, about 300 thousand Jews were forcefully deported to the Treblinka extermination camp and murdered there. A group of young Jewish activists founded two military organizations to fight the Nazis: the Jewish Combat Organization (≈ªOB), which was associated with the left-wing Bund, and the Jewish Military Union (≈ªZW), associated with the right-wing Zionists- Revisionists. These organizations, due to political differences, did not reach an agreement on the issue of joining forces (the ≈ªOB being the majority of them offered the revisionists to join their ranks one by one, not as a separate organization). According to Marek Edelman, few days before the outbreak of the uprising the two armed groups met in the ghetto. Apart from Edelman, the ≈ªOB was also represented by Mordechai Anielewicz and Icchak Cukierman. According to Edelman, the fighters from ≈ªZW took out their revolvers and, by blackmailing the members of ≈ªOB, tried to force them to subordinate to their organization. There was a brawl and gunfire between the two groups, fortunately, no one was wounded. The fighters did not reach an agreement, but later, for pragmatic reasons, embarked on limited military cooperation, dividing up zones of influence in defense of the ghetto area in the event of another entry of German troops.Dawid Wdowi≈Ñski: And We Are Not Saved.. London: Allen, 1964, p. 80 Pennant of the Jewish Military Union The area of military activity of the Jewish Military Union was the vicinity of the now non-existent Muran√≥w Square, located between Muranowska Street and Nalewki Street, in the Warsaw district of Muran√≥w (this place corresponds to the present intersection of Stawki and J√≥zefa Lewartowskiego Streets). The headquarters of ≈ªZW were located at 7 Muranowska Street.Plac muranowski ‚Äì \\"Miejsce bitwy w czasie powstania w getcie warszawskim\\" article from szetl.org.pl The units of the Union were divided into three groups - two of them defended the so-called \\"Shops\\" - factories where ghetto prisoners worked, located outside the ghetto wall, which was reduced after the liquidation operation. The third group, much larger, was located in Muran√≥w Square, where six units, each consisting of 20 soldiers, manned houses in Muranowska Street with numbers 1, 3, 5, 7-9 and 40.Dawid Wdowi≈Ñski: And We Are Not Saved.. London: Allen, 1964, p. 82. The positions of ≈ªZW were in contact with the positions of ≈ªOB, who occupied the houses at Zamenhofa, Mi≈Ça, Gƒôsia and Nalewki Streets.Maciej Kledzik, ‚ÄûZapomniani ≈ºo≈Çnierze ≈ªZW‚Äù, ‚ÄûRzeczpospolita‚Äù 18-04-2008 The ≈ªZW units in Muran√≥w Square had at their disposal an excellently equipped arsenal, located in an abandoned house at 7 Muranowska Street. A Jewish historian and an eyewitness Emanuel Ringelblum, who visited their quarters, was impressed by the arsenal of weapons they had gathered, he writes about the preparations for the uprising in his diary. He saw various types of weapons hanging on the walls and also witnessed the purchase of their next batch by Jewish fighters.Emanuel Ringelblum. ‚ÄûKronika getta warszawskiego‚Äù, Czytelnik, Warszawa 1983. = The battle = Fighting in the square started immediately after the beginning of the Uprising, on April 19, 1943, and lasted for at least 3 days. According to Dawid Wdowi≈Ñski, a soldier and commander of ≈ªZW, a white-blue Jewish flag was hung on the house at 7-9 Muranowska Street, where the headquarters of ≈ªZW were located, and stayed there for 5 days after the beginning of the uprising.Dawid Wdowi≈Ñski: And We Are Not Saved. London: Allen, 1964, p. 94. According to other accounts, there were two flags hanging there: the white-blue Jewish flag and the white-red Polish flag; this is confirmed by the accounts of the historian Emanuel Ringelblum, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Bartoszewskiquoted \\"April 19, 1943. In one of the houses at Muran√≥w Square, two flags were hung: the Jewish one, white and blue, and the Polish one, white and red. (...) Do you remember these flags? W≈Çadys≈Çaw Bartoszewski: Of course. They hanged them so high that they were clearly visible from the tram I was driving from ≈ªoliborz. (...) A special assault group, ordered by SS general J√ºrgen Stroop, attacked the Jewish positions and on April 20, after a fierce fight, both flags were ripped off. Stroop writes about it in his report. Aleksandra Klich and Jaros≈Çaw Kurski, interview with W≈Çadys≈Çaw Bartoszewski, \\"Arcypolskie powstanie ≈ºydowskie\\". \\"Gazeta Wyborcza\\". 12.04.2013. and Alicja Kaczy≈Ñska, who noted this fact in her memoirs. The two flags are also mentioned in the report by J√ºrgen StroopJ√ºrgen Stroop, Es gibt keinen j√ºdischen Wohnbezirk in Warschau mehr!, Warschau 1943, p.5. and in the account by Stroop written by his post-war fellow prisoner, Kazimierz Moczarski, in ‚ÄúRozmowy z katem‚Äù [‚ÄúConversations with an Executioner‚Äù].Kazimierz Moczarski, ‚ÄûRozmowy z katem‚Äù, Spo≈Çeczny Instytut Wydawniczy ‚ÄûZnak‚Äù 2009. A photograph from the Stroop Report. Original German caption: \\"These bandits fought in an armed resistance\\". Picture taken at Nowolipie street looking East, near intersection with Smocza street. In the back one can see ghetto wall with a gate. The first clash took place when the German units approached Nalewki Street in the morning of April 19 - the insurgents opened fire on them with machine guns and hand guns, forcing the Nazis to retreat in the afternoon. During the fights that day, two commanders of the ≈ªZW, Pawe≈Ç Frenkel and Leon Rodal, dressed up as SS officers, approached a unit of Ukrainian soldiers grouped near the square and attacked them by surprise, breaking the encircling of the Jewish units and restoring their contact with the rest of the insurgents.Dawid Wdowi≈Ñski: And We Are Not Saved. London: Allen, 1964, p. 95. According to Kazimierz Iranek-Osmecki, later the head of the Home Army Main Command's Intelligence, the Germans, after capturing the ≈ªOB resistance point on Gƒôsia Street, attacked ≈ªZW positions at Muran√≥w Square, commanded by Pawe≈Ç Frenkel. Houses at 6-10 Muranowska Street during the Warsaw Uprising in 1944 On the night of April 19‚Äì20, the command of the ≈ªZW held a meeting, during which it was decided to distribute the reserve of weapons among all the insurgents, so that it would not fall into the hands of the Nazis in case they acquired the arsenal. Heavy fights continued over the next few days, and when J√ºrgen Stroop took command of the Nazi army, they became even more intense as the Germans used tactics of destroying individual houses, burning and bombing them using heavy cannons. The insurgents, using hidden passages between the houses, attacked Germans by surprise, but at the same time they lost all communication and could only contact each other at night. On the fourth day of the fights, the Muran√≥w unit was joined by a group of ≈ªZW from the \\"shop\\" of brushers in ≈öwiƒôtojerska Street, which was captured by a German armored unit.Dawid Wdowi≈Ñski: And We Are Not Saved. London: Allen, 1964, p. 96. According to Wdowi≈Ñski, on the fifth day of the uprising, the flag was still on the command building at Muran√≥w Square, and the insurgents were still defending themselves by shooting from the windows. Little is known about the fate of the ≈ªZW units in the central ghetto after they lost contact. On April 21 a ≈ªZW unit was still fighting in Franciszka≈Ñska and Mi≈Ça Streets. Some units withdrew that day outside the ghetto wall, trying, with the help of the Polish organization \\"Miecz i P≈Çug\\" (Sword and Plough), to get out of Warsaw to a forest near Otwock. However, they were denounced by the MiP (an organization penetrated by Gestapo agents) to the Germans and died fighting on the road to Otwock.Barbara Engelking, Jacek Leociak: Getto Warszawskie. Przewodnik po nieistniejƒÖcym mie≈õcie.. Warszawa: IFiS PAN, 2001, p. 737. Some of the units stayed in the ghetto and kept fighting. On May 2, 1943, the group moved out of the ghetto to a flat at Grzybowska Street, where they were surrounded and killed. = Account by W≈Çadys≈Çaw Zajdler = According to W≈Çadys≈Çaw Zajdler \\"≈ªarski\\", on April 27 the battle on Muran√≥w Square was also assisted by an 18-person squad of the \\"W\\" squadron of the Security Corps (an autonomous organization associated with the Home Army), commanded by Henryk Iwa≈Ñski \\"Bystry\\". The unit consisted of a team headed by W≈Çadys≈Çaw Zajdler \\"≈ªarski\\" and a section of Lejewski \\"Garbarz\\".W≈Çadys≈Çaw Zajdler. Wypad do getta. Fragment walk na placu Muranowskim.. ‚ÄûZa Wolno≈õƒá i Lud‚Äù. 8, 1962. According to Zajdler, on April 27 Poles got there through a tunnel, with replenishment of weapons, ammunition and food, but due to the complete exhaustion of insurgents they replaced the ≈ªZW unit under the command of David Apfelbaum on the key position between the ruins in the area of the no longer existing Muran√≥w Square and Nalewki Street (today's Bohater√≥w Getta Street), repelling German and Latvian attacks supported by armored weapons. ≈ªarski relates: > \\"On April 26, 1943, through a liaison officer of the Jewish Military Union, > we received a report that the commander of the section Dawid Moryc Apfelbaum > was injured and demanded help in the form of weapons and ammunition. The > Jewish units regained access to a tunnel stretching under the road and > reaching the basement of a house outside the ghetto wall, at 7 Muran√≥w > Square... SC's Main Headquarters ordered us to organize the passage of our > combat group to the ghetto area.

Three subordinates of Iwa≈Ñski, his brother and two of his sons, were allegedly killed in heavy all-day defensive battles, as well as ten Jews, among them Dawid Apfelbaum. Iwa≈Ñski himself was injured and, together with 30 other wounded people, was taken back through a tunnel by his surviving soldiers. According to some studies, \\"together with ≈ªZW, on that day a unit of the Security Corps under the command of Captain Iwa≈Ñski (...) fights in the ghetto, suffering some losses (including the death of his son)\\". Henryk Iwa≈Ñski also reported that he and the Security Corps provided arms to the ≈ªZW before the operation: \\"We supplied (...) arms, ammunition and grenades (...) from 1940 to 1943.) In March and April 1943, before the outbreak of the uprising, we delivered to the ghetto large quantities of machine and hand weapons, ammunition, several boxes of \\"Filipinka\\" grenades (...) During the uprising in the ghetto our people, mainly firemen - members of the Security Corps supplied Jewish fighters with ammunition about 20 times\\".Stanis≈Çaw Wro≈Ñski, Maria Zwolakowa, ‚ÄûPolacy i ≈ªydzi 1939‚Äì1945‚Äù. KsiƒÖ≈ºka i Wiedza, Warszawa 1971 p.167. Iwa≈Ñski's accounts were also confirmed by Tadeusz Bednarczyk \\"Bednarz\\" - a messenger between ≈ªZW and Security Coprs, who was to deliver weapons personally to Jews.Stanis≈Çaw Wro≈Ñski, Maria Zwolakowa, ‚ÄûPolacy i ≈ªydzi 1939‚Äì1945‚Äù. KsiƒÖ≈ºka i Wiedza, Warszawa 1971 p. 167. = Controversy = Historians do not agree on the participation of Poles from the Security Corps in the battles in Muran√≥w Square on April 27, 1943. According to Barbara Engelking and Jacek Leociak, the account is not confirmed by any other sources, and it is known that ≈ªZW units left the ghetto before April 27. So while this account may be true, according to these historians, Zajdler is wrong as to the date or place of the fights.Barbara Engelking, Jacek Leociak: Getto Warszawskie. Przewodnik po nieistniejƒÖcym mie≈õcie.. Warszawa: IFiS PAN, 2001, p. 746‚Äì747. According to Dariusz Libionka and Laurence Weinbaum, not only did Zajdler falsify the accounts about his participation in the ghetto fights in order to obtain veteran privileges, but also did Iwa≈Ñski. They argue that Zajdler's account of the battle did not appear until 1962, and in his earlier, very extensive account of 1948, Iwa≈Ñski does not mention the battle of 27 April, the death of his family members, or the joint fight with Zajdler. Libionka and Weinbaum, referring to other inaccuracies (e.g. the date of the founding of the Security Corps was not until the autumn of 1943), claim that the accounts of Iwa≈Ñski and Zajdler are untrue.Dariusz Libionka, Laurence Weinbaum. Pomnik Apfelbauma, czyli klƒÖtwa ‚Äûmajora‚Äù Iwa≈Ñskiego. Prawdziwa i nieprawdziwa historia ≈ªydowskiego ZwiƒÖzku Wojskowego.. ‚ÄûWiƒô≈∫‚Äù. 4, 2007. The authors also question the fact that two flags, one Jewish and the other Polish, were hung in the ghetto. In their opinion, it is a beautiful legend, unfortunately not confirmed by serious historical sources. They also dispute the existence of Dawid Apfelbaum. = Description of the Battle in the Stroop Report = Fifth page of the Stroop Report describing the Battle of Muran√≥w Square The military operations in Muran√≥w Square are also reported in a 75-page report by J√ºrgen Stroop, SS and police general, who was the commander of German units fighting the uprising. According to the report: > ‚ÄúThe main group of Jews, mixed with Polish bandits, withdrew to the so- > called Muran√≥w Square on the first or second day of the fights. There, they > were rearmed by a large group of Polish bandits. This group decided to > fortify in every possible way to prevent us from further penetration of the > ghetto area.

KsiƒÖ≈ºka i Wiedza, Warszawa 1971 On 27 April, in his report, J√ºrgen Stroop wrote down information that might partially confirm ≈ªarski's account. It describes German fights against a large group of Jewish insurgents located in buildings adjacent to the north-eastern part of the ghetto, located outside the ghetto in Muran√≥w. Stroop sent units there under Diehl's command on the basis of a denunciation, which was sent to the German command. The Germans discovered a group of 120 people \\"strongly armed with guns, rifles and light machine guns\\", which fought back. During the battle, \\"24 bandits were killed and 52 arrested\\". The fighting dragged on until the next day. Stroop writes down: > \\"(...) we arrested 17 Poles, among them two Polish policemen, who should > have known about the existence of this gang.

The garlic gets briefly fried with olive oil in a pan until it reaches a golden color, then it gets removed; in the meantime another pan is used to boil some moderately salted water which will be used to cook the pasta. Ortolana Ingredients Carrots, leek and celery get thrown in the pan where the garlic has been fried in olive oil and left cooking for about 6 or 7 minutes, before adding red and yellow capsicum, salt and pepper to the mix. At this point the pasta gets thrown in the other pan with hot boiling water, where it will cook for about 6-10 minutes (varies depending on the type of pasta). After the vegetables have been cooking for another 3 or 4 minutes, 1 or 2 scoops of the hot boiling water (where the pasta is being cooked) need to be poured in the pan with the vegetables, before adding eggplants and cherry tomatoes, leaving everything cooking for about 10 minutes. When the pasta is almost ready, it gets taken off from the boiling water and thrown into the pan together with all the vegetables, where everything gets tossed and cooked for another 2 or 3 minutes before serving it with few leaves of fresh basil on top..\\"Fusilli all'Ortolana\\", Giallo Zafferano  Variations  This Italian dish can have many different variation, as the base concept is to create the sauce by using different fresh vegetables, before mixing it with pasta (Just like with the type of pasta, there is no strict specification regarding the type of vegetables used for the Ortolana): some might replace the leek with onion, as well as adding more tomatoes to create a substantial sauce \\"Vegetarian Pasta Recipe  Rigatoni all‚ÄôOrtolana\\", Vincenzo's plate \\"Rigatoni all'Ortolana  Vegetarian Pasta Recipes  Italian Food Recipes\\", Vincenzos plate, while other might consider adding black olives to the mix, together with diced smoked cheese \\"Pasta all‚Äôortolana ‚Äì summer vegetable pasta\\", Coochinando See also * List of Italian dishes  References  Category:Pasta dishes Category:Italian cuisine ","title":"Pasta all'Ortolana"},{"id":"57252602","text":"The Puerto Hurraco massacre was a mass murder that occurred on the afternoon of Sunday, 26 August 1990 in Puerto Hurraco, a village in Benquerencia de la Serena, municipality in the Province of Badajoz, (Extremadura, Spain). It has 135 inhabitants (200 in summer). The perpetrators were the brothers, Emilio and Antonio Izquierdo, members of the \\"Izquierdo family\\", who murdered 9 people in the streets of their hometown, some of them belonged to their rivals, the \\"Cabanillas family\\" (two girls of 13 and 14 years old among them), and caused serious injuries to 12 others. The two then fled, but were arrested next morning and eventually sentenced each to 684 years in prison,La matanza de Puerto Hurraco, Fin de semana (July 22, 2005)Los hermanos Izquierdo, condenados a 684 a√±os de c√°rcel por la matanza de Puerto Hurraco, El Mundo (January 26, 1994) where they died aged 72 and 74.  Background  The quarrels between the Cabanillas (called \\"the Amadeos\\") and Izquierdo families (the \\"Patas Pel√°s\\")Ecos de los disparos en una silla de ruedas (January 17, 1994) arose from a boundary dispute in 1967, when Amadeo Cabanillas entered with a plough on a farm owned by Manuel Izquierdo in Puerto Hurraco.http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/181792/0/puerto/hurraco/muere There was also, at that time, a history of unrequited love between Amadeo Cabanillas and Luciana Izquierdo; both fell in love, but he finally refused to marry her, a fact that affected Luciana very much.https://web.archive.org/web/20120505183035/http://mundomisterio.portalmundos.com/puerto- hurraco-tragedia-en-tres-actos-primer-acto/ A few days after the rejection, on January 22, 1967, Amadeo Cabanillas was murdered by Jer√≥nimo Izquierdo, the oldest of the Izquierdo brothers, who was imprisoned for this crime and served a 14-year sentence. As soon as Jer√≥nimo Izquierdo met his sentence in 1986, he returned to Puerto Hurraco aiming to avenge the death of his elderly mother, Isabel Izquierdo Caballero,25 a√±os de la tragedia Puerto Hurraco quiere olvidar ‚Äì El Pa√≠s (August 26, 2015) who died two years earlier in a fire in her house on the street Carrera No. 9, on October 18, 1984. The Izquierdo family blamed Antonio Cabanillas, brother of Amadeo, for being the author of the crime; even though the police investigation did not find perpetrator. That is the reason why Jer√≥nimo tried to kill Antonio with a knife, seriously injuring him, although he managed to survive. As a result Jer√≥nimo Izquierdo entered the psychiatric hospital on August 8, 1986, and died nine days later.  The shooting  On Sunday, 26 August 1990, six years after the fire and four years after the stabbing of Antonio Cabanillas by Jer√≥nimo Izquierdo, his two brothers, Emilio and Antonio Izquierdo, aged 56 and 52 respectively, said goodbye to their sisters, √Ångela and Luciana Izquierdo in their house in Monterrubio de la Serena, assuring that \\"We are going to hunt turtledoves\\". Dressed as hunters and armed with automatic .12 caliber shotgun, they hid at nightfall in an alley in town and then came out and shoot cartridges against numerous members of the Cabanillas family who were there, they were specifically looking for Antonio Cabanillas Rivera. Subsequently, the shooting would result against anyone who accidentally came across them in the street. The incident resulted in 9 people dead, two little girls who were sisters of the Cabanillas family among them, Encarnaci√≥n and Antonia Cabanillas (daughters of Antonio), aged 13 and 14 respectively, who were playing in the square and were brutally shot at short distance by the Izquierdo brothers. There were over 12 wounded people with different degrees of severity. Some ended up paraplegic and in a wheelchair for the rest of their lives. The third sister of Encarnaci√≥n and Antonia, Mar√≠a del Carmen Cabanillas, avoided the massacre since she was at the time at her cousin's home. A six-year-old-child, Guillermo Ojeda S√°nchez, was hit in the head, and left in a coma.La novena v√≠ctima de Puerto Hurraco ser√° enterrada en San Sebastian ‚Äì El Pa√≠s (12/09/1990) Again, the crime was committed as an act of vengeance since they considered the victims guilty for a fire that was set on one of their properties in which their mother, Isabel Izquierdo, died. The ammunition used were buckshots, cartridges that contain nine thick lead pellets. After their escape, the Izquierdo brothers even got to shoot against one unit of the Civil Guard that arrived from their barracks house back at Monterrubio de la Serena, alerted by the neighbours. Two agents of the Civil Guard were seriously injured on the inside of their vehicle before they could even stop the murderers or even defend themselves with their service weapons. Similar .12 calibre buckshot shotgun to the ones used during the massacre. After the slaughter, the Izquierdo brothers ran towards the hill, Sierra del Oro, sown field with olive groves. The Civil Guard units that were looking for them found them sleeping nine hours after the beginning of the tragedy and both of them were arrested without putting up any resistance. They were taken to the court in Castuera (Badajoz), far from Puerto Hurraco, and from the entirely possible chance of settling the score. After his detention, Emilio Izquierdo, did not show even the smallest sign of regret: ‚ÄúLet the town suffer now like I have been suffering all this time‚Äù, while his brother, Antonio claimed they had the idea of continuing with the carnage: ‚ÄúIf you hadn‚Äôt caught us we would have come back to shot everyone during the burial for the dead‚Äù http://www.abc.es/20100427/historia-/matanza-puerto-hurraco- izquierdo-201004262002.html The brothers thought they had shot a score of 20 people, but they really shot twenty-one people, but they only got to kill seven of them instantly, and two injured that died within weeks at the hospital Infanta Cristina in Badajoz. The two sisters, Luciana and √Ångela, 62 and 49 years old respectively, ran as fast as they could up to their house in Monterrubio de la Serena and then caught the train to Madrid, even though four days later (on the 30 August 1990) they had to come back to Castuera to testify before the judge. Outside the court they had Antonio Cabanillas waiting for them, father of the two little girls murdered, with a knife on his hand, but he was quickly disarmed and arrested by the Civil Guard that was guarding the building in case there was any chance of retaliation. = Victims = *Reinaldo Ben√≠tez Romero, 62 *Manuel Cabanillas Carrillo, 55 *Antonia Cabanillas Rivero, 14 *Encarnaci√≥n Cabanillas Rivero, 12, sister of Antonia Cabanillas *Isabel Carrillo D√°vila, 70 *Andr√©s Ojeda Gallardo, 36, son-in-law of Isabel Carrillo *Araceli Murillo Romero, 60 *Antonia Murillo Fern√°ndez, 58 *Jos√© Penco Rosales, 43 Among those wounded were: Guillermo Ojeda S√°nchez, 6, Antonio Cabanillas Ben√≠tez, 24, Juan Antonio Fern√°ndez Trejo, 31, √Ångela S√°nchez Murillo, 42, Felicitas Ben√≠tez Romero, 59, Vicenta Izquierdo S√°nchez, Isabel Cabanillas, and Manuel Calero M√°rquez.  The trial  In the trial held three and a half years later, in January 1994, the two Izquierdo brothers were sentenced to 684 years in prison and 300 million pesetas, the former Spanish currency, in compensation. The magistrate stressed: \\"Their intelligence is within the norm, a fact that is corroborated since that they were capable of managing a flock of about a thousand sheep, had leased farms and possess, with the crisis that is going on in the countryside, a 10 million pesetas passbook\\", \\"the accused outlined a 'plan to exterminate' the largest possible number of inhabitants of the town of Puerto Hurraco\\", \\"they chose the alley and the night because they knew the habits of their neighbours and they knew that 'at that time and from that place they could kill more people'\\" and the judge also stressed \\"a cultural primitivism and an affective impoverishment that determines contempt for human life\\" and \\"the accused fed their own phobias and obsessions due to an abnormal social isolation and the fact that they lived together in a closed group (in reference to all the brothers)\\". The prosecution initially charged sisters Angela and Luciana Izquierdo with allegedly inducing the crime, but two years later they were acquitted after the judge failed to find evidence to prove their direct involvement in the events. However, they were admitted to the Psychiatric Hospital of Merida on medical recommendation, as they were diagnosed with a paranoid process and a shared delusional disorder related to revenge for the death of their mother Isabel Izquierdo, six years earlier, in a fire. The public prosecutor as well as the prosecution forgot about their demands of exile for both defendants once they were released from jail, which could be at the age of 70.  Death of the murderers  Fourteen years later, Luciana Izquierdo (1928‚Äì2005) died on 1 February 2005, in the mental hospital of Merida at the age of 77. She was thought to be the true instigator of the crimes in Puerto Hurraco (in her youth she was rejected by her boyfriend, a member of the Cabanillas family). In November of that same year, just ten months after, her sister Angela Izquierdo (1941‚Äì2005) also died in the same mental hospital at the age of 64. One year after his sisters‚Äô death, Emilio Izquierdo (1934‚Äì2006), who was 72 at that time, died of natural causes on 13 December 2006 when he was in Badajoz prison. He suffered from heart problems and was found dead in his cell by a prison officer. His brother Antonio attended the funeral and next to his brother's tomb he said: ‚ÄúBrother, go in peace because our mother has been avenged.‚Äù hoy.es: ¬´Hermano, te vas con la satisfacci√≥n de que tu madre ha sido vengada¬ª (S√°bado, 16 de diciembre de 2006). Three years and six months after Emilio's death and nineteen years after the massacre, Antonio Izquierdo (1938‚Äì2010), the last of the Izquierdo brothers, died on 25 April 2010, in the prison of Badajoz when he hanged himself with the bed sheets. He was found in his cell at the nurse unit, where the inmate was staying at the time, due to his delicate health. The prison officers found him at 2 am while they were on their night shift. Although they immediately called the medical services, they were only able to determine his death.El √∫ltimo de los asesinos de Puerto Hurraco se ahorca en la c√°rcel Badajoz ‚Äì El Pa√≠s (25 April 2010) [1] Antonio committed suicide the very same day he was supposed to be released from prison if the Parot Doctrine had not been applied. The Doctrine was passed by The Supreme Court in 2006. Antonio was serving a sentence of 25 years, but the doctrine left him with another 5 years to serve. The inmate showed his disconformity with the application of the Parot Doctrine. None of the five Izquierdo brothers had descendants, so the lineage ended with the death of the last brother, Antonio. Only a daughter of the Cabanillas family survived the massacre, Mari Carmen, who had two children. Both surnames will disappear (Izquierdo and Cabanillas) because these children will take the Cabanillas surname in the second place. Nevertheless, the Izquierdo family couldn't accomplish its objective of killing the Cabanillas family after this series of tragic events.http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2010/04/25/espana/1272194891.html  Pop culture and media  Fourteen years later, events were brought to the big screen.

The Group, which today is worth ‚Ç¨5.45 billion, is one of the world's leading urban public transport operators, carrying more than 16 million passengers per day in 14 countries on four continents. With more than 20% of its revenue generated internationally, RATP is a multimodal operator - with more than eight modes of transport - and the world leader in the tramway and automatic metro. The expertise of its 60,000 employees in engineering, maintenance and operations, its many projects (more than 3,000 carried out in 2017-2018, a level unmatched since the 1930s) and its very high investment level in √éle-de-France (‚Ç¨8.5 billion between 2016-2020, of which ‚Ç¨4.2 billion in equity and ‚Ç¨1.74 billion in investment planned in 2018) make RATP a major economic and social player.

This ambition is based on four priorities: achieving operational excellence, succeeding in the opening up to competition, being the best partner for smart and sustainable cities and increasing RATP Group's international development. These four priorities, implemented as of January 2018, are followed by very concrete objectives, such as making customer service a constant requirement by developing more and more personalised services, thanks to an ambitious digital transformation plan (‚Ç¨500 million over five years) or becoming a key player in the sustainable city, thanks to a vast conversion program of bus depots to electric and gas by 2025, to have a fleet of 100% clean buses. Other projects in progress: to be exemplary in terms of energy transition by reducing the Group's energy consumption by 20% and reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2025, making RATP a champion of multimodal mobility in France and worldwide, through a policy of equity participation in start-ups and a doubling of the Group's international sales in five years, creating more and more places of social diversity in the urban landscape (bringing together maintenance, private, social & student housing, nurseries ...) just as the RATP has already demonstrated in the context of the transformation of the Lagny and Jourdan bus depots. = Other mandates = Catherine Guillouard has been a board member representing the French state at Engie since 2015 and an independent board member at Airbus since 2016.

Offenses and alleged crimes  Wolfgang Ott was sentenced to 15 months probation and psychiatric treatment at the age of 16 for sexual assault. After two failed kidnapping attempts on women, he kidnapped 23-year old bank employee Sonja S. on May 30, 1995, and held her for three days in his home in Liesing, Vienna, where he repeatedly raped and abused her. He then went with her to Styria, where he undressed her on the bank of the Salza river, tied her up and threw her in the river, where she drowned. Her body was only recovered on June 26 in Landl. On June 10, 1995, he kidnapped the 19-year old high school graduate Karin M. in Vienna, raped and abused her several times before strangling her on a bank of the Salza, burying the body in a wooded area in Palfau. Her body was found two years later, on June 6, 1997. On June 12, 1995, he abducted a 43-year old businesswoman in Perchtoldsdorf and detained her in his home for over 20 hours, raping her as well. When he left the house for a short time, she managed to escape and alerted the police, who immediately began looking for Ott. In the meantime, Ott kidnapped and raped two more women, one of whom managed to escape. The other, a 23-year old mountain climber, he transported over 600 km in the trunk of his van to a bank of the Salza river and released her there, after she had promised to meet him again. On June 20, 1995, Wolfgang Ott was arrested near the Attersee lake in Upper Austria by the gendarmerie. He had been riding a bicycle and had tried in vain to pose as a German tourist. On June 23, 1995, the police found the body of 34-year old Helga V. near Sonja S.'s burial site. It is still being investigated if Ott has any connection to this crime. In addition, authorities are also trying to clarify whether he also murdered 17-year old Martina Posch, whose body was found on November 22, 1986, on the shores of lake Mondsee in Upper Austria. On October 3, 1996, he was sentenced to life imprisonment and admission to an institution for mentally ill lawbreakers for the murder of Sonja S. On February 24, 1999, he was again sentenced to life imprisonment by the Landesgericht Leoben for the murder of Karin M.  Imprisonment  On July 1, 2004, while working in the carpentry shop of the Graz-Karlau Prison, Ott hid himself in a box secured with snap-on hinges and let inmates load him into a hospital-owned truck that was to drive to the Maria Lankowitz satellite camp.

Sandifer headed the NAACP's New York State branch and was involved in cases, including school segregation. He argued Henderson v. United States (1950) before the U.S. Supreme Court.  Early life and education  Born John Sandifer on June 6, 1914 in Greensboro, North Carolina, he was one of Charles and Nettie Sandifer's nine children. In college, he changed his first name from John to Jawn. Sandifer graduated from Johnson C. Smith University in 1935 and in 1938 he earned his law degree from the Howard University School of Law.  Career  Early in his legal career, Sandifer was dedicated to fighting Jim Crow laws. During World War II, he served in the Army's criminal investigation unit. In 1949, he moved to New York City and opened a private legal practice in Harlem. The same year, he was elected to serve as one of the two lawyers for the New York branch of NAACP, working with Thurgood Marshall. In 1950, while working with the NAACP, he had the opportunity to argue a key discrimination case for the U.S. Supreme Court case, Henderson v. United States. His judicial career started in 1964, when he was appointed to the civil court bench in New York City by mayor Robert F. Wagner. In 1982, Sandifer won the election for State Supreme Court in Manhattan. He retired in 1992. = New York City Sanitation Department case = In 1986, there was a case involving a change to the City Sanitation Department entrance exam. The union, Uniformed Sanitationmen's Association, alleged that the most recent entrance test for the job was too easy and \\"noncompetitive\\". The older, 1974 version of the entrance test and examination, had involved obstacle courses with scaling eight-foot walls, and was unrelated to the job of hauling garbage. Of 45,000 people who took the 1986 version of the exam, 44,000 earned the highest grade and 1,710 of those were women. Sandifer approved the use of the current version of the entrance exam, siding with the City Sanitation Department in his ruling and allowed the City Sanitation Department to hire its first women. = Legal Right to Die case = Thomas Wirth, who had AIDS and a brain infection, drafted a living will in April 1987 with his legal guardian. It stated that if he could not be restored to a \\"meaningful quality of life,\\" he wished to be allowed the right to die \\"without extraordinary medical measures\\". In July 1987, Judge Sandifer sided with Bellevue Hospital, the hospital giving life prolonging treatment to Wirth, because it had not been proven that Wirth's brain infection was not treatable. Wirth died in August of the same year, of an AIDS-related brain infection.  Personal life  Sandifer was married to Laura Sandifer until her death in 1993. Sandifer's second wife was Elsa Krueger‚ÄìSandifer and together they had a son Floyd. Sandifer died at age 92 on September 1, 2016 due to cancer. Sandifer is buried in Oakland Cemetery in Sag Harbor, New York. References Category:1914 births Category:2006 deaths Category:Howard University School of Law alumni Category:Johnson C.

Family background Lu Yin was from Wu County, Wu Commandery (), which is present-day Suzhou, Jiangsu. The Lu clan, which he was from, was one of the four most influential clans in Wu Commandery and also in the Jiangdong (or Wu) region at the time. He was the younger brother of Lu Kai and a relative of Lu Xun, who served as the eighth and third Imperial Chancellors of Eastern Wu respectively.(Èô∏Âá±Â≠óÊï¨È¢®ÔºåÂê≥ÈÉ°Âê≥‰∫∫Ôºå‰∏ûÁõ∏ÈÅúÊóèÂ≠ê‰πü„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 61.([Èô∏]ËÉ§Â≠óÊï¨ÂÆóÔºåÂá±Âºü‰πü„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 61.

Around the 240s, there was a power struggle between Sun He, the Crown Prince, and his fourth brother Sun Ba, the Prince of Lu, over the succession to their father's throne. While Sun He became worried that his father would depose and replace him, Sun Ba became increasingly set on seizing the position of Crown Prince from Sun He.(Âê≥ÈåÑÊõ∞ÔºöÂ§™Â≠êËá™ÊáºÈªúÂª¢ÔºåËÄåÈ≠ØÁéãË¶¨Ë¶¶ÁõäÁîö„ÄÇ) Wu Lu annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 61. Each of the two princes had a faction supporting him. During this time, Sun Quan considered replacing Sun He with Sun Ba so he privately asked Yang Zhu (), one of Sun Ba's supporters, about his thoughts on Sun Ba. Yang Zhu sang praises of Sun Ba and nearly convinced Sun Quan to replace Sun He with Sun Ba. A servant who eavesdropped on the private conversation between Sun Quan and Yang Zhu secretly reported what he heard to Sun He.(Ê¨äÊôÇË¶ãÊ•äÁ¨ÅÔºåËæüÂ∑¶Âè≥ËÄåË´ñÈú∏‰πãÊâçÔºåÁ¨ÅÊ∑±Ëø∞Èú∏ÊúâÊñáÊ≠¶Ëã±ÂßøÔºåÂÆúÁÇ∫Â´°Âó£ÔºåÊñºÊòØÊ¨ä‰πÉË®±Á´ãÁÑâ„ÄÇÊúâÁµ¶‰Ωø‰ºè‰∫éÁâÄ‰∏ãÔºåÂÖ∑ËÅû‰πãÔºå‰ª•ÂëäÂ§™Â≠ê„ÄÇ) Wu Lu annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 61.

Instead, he lied that it was Yang Zhu who told them about it. Sun Quan then ordered Yang Zhu to be arrested and interrogated as well. Yang Zhu, unable to withstand the torture, falsely admitted that he told Lu Yin.

Later life In 258, during the reign of Sun Xiu, Lu Kang was appointed as the Area Commander of Xiling (Ë•øÈôµ; around present-day Yichang, Hubei) near the western frontier of Wu. He was also awarded the peerage of a Marquis of a Chief Village ().

It is the second book co-authored by Benedict and Keteyian, who published The System: The Glory and Scandal of Big- Time College Football in 2013. Background Prior to writing the book, Benedict and Keteyian read over 20 books previously published about Woods' life, including Woods' own memoir, The 1997 Masters: My Story. The authors also read articles by Wright Thompson, Gary Smith, Frank Deford and others as they created a timeline of Woods' life that, once complete, was over 70,000 words in length. More than 250 people were interviewed for the book. Keteyian interviewed Mark O'Meara for the book while O'Meara was playing a round at the 2017 Conquistadores Classic. O'Meara's ex-wife, Alicia O'Meara, was also interviewed several times for the book. The authors declined an on-the-record interview Woods himself for the book as they were not willing to meet Woods' conditions for such an interview, and the authors were not able to conduct any off-the-record conversations with Woods himself. Keteyian said the reason for writing the book was to attempt to answer the question, \\"Who is Tiger Woods?\\" Synopsis The biography opens with the 2009 car accident on the day after Thanksgiving that precipitated Woods' infidelity scandal and fallout. From The Financial Times: :\\"Much time is spent on the pathologies of his parents, his African-American father Earl and Thai mother Kultida, whom Earl met when he was an army officer in Asia and still married to his first wife. While his father is credited with teaching their son the game and pushing him to greatness, Tida, as she is known, is found to be more cold-blooded and the source of his killer instinct...Benedict and Keteyian provide extensive details of Tiger‚Äôs famous nastiness, which was helpful in dispatching golf foes and deployed against anyone he no longer required. And there are painstaking descriptions of his escapades with Las Vegas hostesses and waffle house waitresses.\\" Reception Tiger Woods was a New York Times bestseller, reaching #5 overall in the category of Hardcover Nonfiction. The book has received mostly positive reviews, with critics noting the authors' treatment of Woods' life off the course. One writer said, \\"Thankfully, the authors‚Äô spare us more than fleeting snippets of Woods‚Äô on-course exploits. Their interest is more on the human drama of Woods‚Äô career.\\" In one review, the New York Times said, \\"It‚Äôs a confident and substantial book that‚Äôs nearly as sleek as a Christopher Nolan movie. It makes a sweet sound, like a well-struck golf ball.\\" Golf Digest said Tiger Woods is, \\"a book brimming with revealing details about Woods‚Äô unique background, his rise to superstardom and the myriad character flaws that contributed to his well-publicized fall.\\" A review in The New Yorker said the book is, \\"comprehensive, propulsive, packed with incident...and unsparing with regard to its subject.\\" Tiger Woods was criticized as factually inaccurate by Woods' lawyers. Doug Band, an aide to former President Bill Clinton, who was present for a round of golf played between Woods and Clinton, also questioned the accuracy of the book, saying of an account of the round, \\"there is hardly an accurate or true word in the excerpt.‚Äù Keteyan and Benedict responded to the criticism on ESPN's Outside the Lines, explaining that the \\"egregious errors\\" that Woods' lawyers point to are relatively minor discrepancies. Media adaptation In March 2018, filmmaker Alex Gibney was reported to be developing a documentary series based on Tiger Woods. In May 2019, after Woods's win at the 2019 Masters, Deadline Hollywood announced that Benedict had reached an agreement with Wheelhouse Entertainment to develop a scripted miniseries based on the book.https://deadline.com/2019/05/tiger-woods-jeff-benedict- wheelhouse-1202620066/https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/tiger-woods- scripted-miniseries-based-on-bestselling-biography-reportedly-in-development/ References Category:Golf books Category:2018 non-fiction books ","title":"Tiger Woods (book)"},{"id":"57253318","text":"The knockout stage of the 2019 Cricket World Cup consisted of two semi-finals, played at Old Trafford in Manchester on 9 July and Edgbaston in Birmingham on 11 July, and a final, at Lord's on 14 July. It was the third time Edgbaston hosted a World Cup semi-final and the fourth at Old Trafford ‚Äì a record for a World Cup venue. Rules All of the knockout games had a reserve day. If a reserve day came into play, the match would not be restarted but resumed from the previous day's play (if any). In the event of no play on the scheduled day or the reserve day, in the semi-finals, the team that finished higher in the group stage progressed to the final, and if no play were possible in the final, the trophy would be shared. If any match ended in a tie, a Super Over would be used to determine the winner; each team would select three batsmen and a bowler, with the full team available to field. There would be no penalty for the loss of a wicket, but the loss of two wickets would end the Super Over. If the scores in the Super Over were also tied, the winner would be determined by the two teams' overall boundary count, including both the match itself and the Super Over. Qualification On 25 June 2019, Australia became the first team to qualify for the semi-finals, after beating England at Lord's. India were next to qualify, thanks to victory over Bangladesh at Edgbaston on 2 July. The following day saw tournament hosts England become the third team to qualify, after they beat New Zealand at the Riverside Ground. New Zealand were the fourth and final team to qualify, after Pakistan were unable to increase their net run rate sufficiently enough in their match against Bangladesh at Lord's. As group winners, India faced fourth-placed New Zealand in the first semi-final, while the second semi-final will feature Australia and England, who finished second and third, respectively. The International Cricket Council (ICC) appointed the umpires for the two matches on 7 July. Bracket Semi-finals Due to persistent rain, the first semi- final was suspended in the 47th over of New Zealand's innings, and continued on 10 July. New Zealand eventually posted a total of 239/8 from their 50 overs; in response, India were bowled out for 221, 18 runs short, sending New Zealand through to their second Cricket World Cup final, having also played in the final in 2015. The second semi-final saw England take on Australia at Edgbaston. Australia won the toss and chose to bat first, but lost three of their top four batsmen for single-figure scores, two of them to Chris Woakes, to reduce them to 14/3 a ball into the seventh over. Steve Smith held his wicket to top-score with 85 as Australia were bowled out for 223 with Woakes and Rashid being the best of the bowlers with three wickets apiece. Nevertheless, England were well over halfway to their target by this point, and an unbroken partnership of 79 between Joe Root and captain Eoin Morgan saw them home to an eight-wicket victory and their first World Cup final since 1992.

The Germans shot prisoners brought from outside the ghetto in the \\"Jewish residential district in Warsaw\\" in the summer of 1942, but such executions became massive only in mid-May 1943, after the uprising in the Warsaw Ghetto had been suppressed and the district had begun to be systematically demolished. The genocide in the ruins of the ghetto was carried out continuously until the outbreak of the Warsaw uprising in August 1944. SS and German police officers shot several thousand people there ‚Äì Polish hostages (mainly prisoners of Pawiak prison and ordinary residents of the city detained during mass round-ups), as well as Jews captured on the \\"Aryan side\\".  Origins  Warsaw was considered by the Germans to be the centre of Polish resistance against the Nazi \\"New Order\\". Although in the occupied General Government the former capital of Poland was degraded to the role of a provincial city, Warsaw still remained the centre of Polish political, intellectual and cultural life. It was also the seat of the authorities of the Polish Underground State and a place of functioning of particularly strong and well-organized structures of the resistance movement. Governor General Hans Frank wrote in his diary on December 14, 1943: \\"If we had not had Warsaw in the General Government, we would not have four-fifths of the difficulties we had to face. Warsaw is and will remain a focus of turmoil, the point from which unrest spreads in that country\\".W≈Çadys≈Çaw Bartoszewski: Warszawski pier≈õcie≈Ñ ≈õmierci 1939‚Äì1944. Warszawa: Interpress, 1970, p. 442. From the first days of the occupation, Germans imposed brutal terror on the people of Warsaw, directed primarily at the representatives of the Polish political and intellectual Elites, the Jewish community and people who were in any way connected with the activities of the resistance movement. Warsaw's Prisons and detention centres ‚Äì Pawiak, the investigator's arrest at Dani≈Çowiczowska Street, the Mokot√≥w Prison, and the basements of Sipo's headquarters in Szucha Avenue ‚Äì were filled with arrested people. Street round-ups, deportations to concentration camps and mass murders became daily occurrences. Executions of Political prisoners from Warsaw were usually carried out in secret in areas inaccessible to bystanders. The places of massacres were, among others: the Sejm gardens at Wiejska Street; Kabaty Forest; Swedish Mountains in Bemowo; Sƒôkocin Forest near Magdalenka; Chojn√≥w Forests near Stefan√≥w; Laski, Wydmy ≈Åu≈ºe and W√≥lka Wƒôglowa on the outskirts of Kampinos; and above all ‚Äì infamous Palmiry. From the executioner's point of view, however, executions carried out in the Forests near Warsaw entailed certain risks and logistic problems. The discreet transport of convicts from Warsaw's prisons to places of execution located several kilometers from the city was a complicated and time-consuming operation. The protection of execution sites from unauthorized witnesses and escape of convicts also posed serious problems. The Germans had no guarantee that the inhabitants of the surrounding villages would not be able to find mass graves by accident or intention.‚ÄûTerror nie ustaje‚Äù ‚Äì 75. rocznica masowych egzekucji w ruinach getta warszawskiego, 29 May 2018, dzieje.pl  First executions in the ruins of the ghetto  Ruins of the Warsaw Ghetto Starting from June 1942, there were several cases when small groups of Poles, ranging from a few to several dozen, were murdered by the Germans in the Warsaw Ghetto, which at that time was completely isolated from the rest of the city. The bodies of the murdered were usually abandoned directly in the streets of the \\"Jewish residential district\\", where they were then taken care of by Jewish working groups, whose duties included cleaning the streets from the bodies of the dead inhabitants of the ghetto. They usually buried the corpses in the Jewish cemetery or in the \\"Skra\\" football field. Such executions took place on a larger scale during the great displacement operation in the ghetto (summer 1942), because in the conditions of general chaos, it was easy for Germans to hide the fact of the murder and to get rid of the victims' bodies unnoticeably.W≈Çadys≈Çaw Bartoszewski: Warszawski pier≈õcie≈Ñ ≈õmierci... op.cit., p. 194 i 196.Regina Doma≈Ñska: Pawiak ‚Äì wiƒôzienie Gestapo. Kronika lat 1939‚Äì1944. Warszawa: KsiƒÖ≈ºka i Wiedza, 1978, p. 236, 244, 246. In the spring of 1943, the Germans finally shut down the Warsaw Ghetto by brutally suppressing the uprising which had been started by the Jewish resistance movement. Areas of the former \\"Jewish residential district\\" were transformed by the occupying forces into a \\"stone- brick desert\\". The management of the Warsaw Gestapo came to a conclusion that the ruins of the ghetto might turn out to be a convenient place to carry out secret executions of Poles ‚Äì this time on a massive scale. SS-Gruppenf√ºhrer J√ºrgen Stroop, the then SS and Police Commander (SS- und Polizeif√ºhrer) for the Warsaw district, claimed that the author of this idea was Dr Ludwig Hahn, Commander of the German security police and security service in Warsaw. While in Mokot√≥w Prison waiting for the trial, Stroop reported on talks with Hahn to his co-prisoner from the cell, Kazimierz Moczarski. ‚ÄúDoctor Hahn said something like this: \\"Let's use Grossaktion to finish Poles as well. Many Jews died in the ghetto and will continue to do so. There are corpses everywhere, so if a few thousand more dead Poles arrive, nobody will be able to verify anything anyway\\" ‚Äì reported by J√ºrgen Stroop.Kazimierz Moczarski: Rozmowy z katem. Warszawa: Pa≈Ñstwowy Instytut Wydawniczy, 1978, p. 294. From the point of view of the occupants, a number of factors spoke in favor of using the ruins of the ghetto as a place of mass executions. The district was directly adjacent to the Pawiak prison, where the vast majority of Polish political prisoners were detained. The ghetto walls and numerous German posts completely isolated the \\"stone and brick desert\\" from the rest of the city.W≈Çadys≈Çaw Bartoszewski: Warszawski pier≈õcie≈Ñ ≈õmierci... op.cit., p. 256 Police patrols constantly hunted Jews hiding in the ruins, which explained the sound of shots coming from behind the walls. It was easy to bury or burn the bodies of the murdered in the ruins. Finally, in the summer of 1943, a German concentration camp ‚Äì the so-called Konzentrationslager Warschau ‚Äì began to operate in the area of the former ghetto (near Gƒôsia Street). Its premises and crew were used for carrying out executions, as well as its equipment (crematorium). Ruins of the house at 27 Dzielna Street. In 1943‚Äì1944, thousands of Pawiak prisoners were murdered there. \\"We'll avange Pawiak\\". An inscription made by scouts from the \\"Wawer\\" organization on a notice board placed on a fence of the BGK garden at Bracka Street. The first execution of Pawiak's prisoners, carried out in the ruins of the Warsaw Ghetto, took place on May 7, 1943, i.e. before the end of the Ghetto Uprising.The destruction of the Great Warsaw Synagogue by the Germans, which is considered the official end of the uprising, took place on May 16, 1943. At that time, 94 people were murdered in the gate of a tenement house at 21 Dzielna Street.Regina Doma≈Ñska: Pawiak... op.cit., p. 319. From the end of May 1943, executions in the former \\"Jewish residential district\\" took place almost every day.Regina Doma≈Ñska: Pawiak... op.cit., p. 27. Since then, the Germans have almost completely abandoned execution of convicts in forests near Warsaw and have significantly limited the deportations of Pawiak prisoners (and of other Warsaw prisons and jails) to concentration camps. Instead, Polish political prisoners were hastily and massively murdered in the ruins of the ghetto, often after only a few or several days of investigation or even without any investigation at all.W≈Çadys≈Çaw Bartoszewski: Warszawski pier≈õcie≈Ñ ≈õmierci... op.cit., p. 441. Almost every day executions of several or a dozen Jews captured by the Germans on the \\"Aryan side\\", as well as Poles who hid them, took place there.W≈Çadys≈Çaw Bartoszewski: Warszawski pier≈õcie≈Ñ ≈õmierci... op.cit., p. 269 i 363. The names of these victims were in most cases never established, as the captured Jews were not entered in the Pawiak's records at all. Instead, after a few hours, or at most a few days of their stay on the death row, they were executed in the ghetto. It was not uncommon for whole families, including women and children, to be murdered in the ruins.Regina Doma≈Ñska: Pawiak... op.cit., p. 13-14. Germans carried out the executions at various places in the former ghetto, but most often on the grounds of the property at 25 and 27 Dzielna Street, in the garden of the house at 29 Nowolipki Street and in the courtyard of the house at 19 Zamenhofa Street.W≈Çadys≈Çaw Bartoszewski: Warszawski pier≈õcie≈Ñ ≈õmierci... op.cit., p. 256.Regina Doma≈Ñska: Pawiak... op.cit., p. 28. Pawiak prisoners or other people brought from the city were also shot on the grounds of the Warsaw concentration camp (KL Warschau).Regina Doma≈Ñska: Pawiak... op.cit., p. 333. The corpses of the murdered were burnedIt is probable that at the very beginning the bodies of the victims of some executions were buried by the Germans in the ground or buried in the cellars of demolished houses. ‚Äì most often on the grounds of the property at 45 Gƒôsia and 27 Pawia Streets or within the KL Warschau camp (on piles made of wooden parts of demolished houses or in the local crematorium). The corpses were burned by labor units composed of Jews - prisoners of the camp.Bogus≈Çaw Kopka: Konzentrationslager Warschau... op.cit, p. 62. The information on German crimes provided to the outside by the members of the AK conspiracy employed as the Pawiak custodian staff was inevitably fragmented, so it is impossible to determine the exact dates and course of all the murders carried out in the ghetto ruins in the spring and summer of 1943. However, it is known that in the executions that were carried out almost every day a few to a dozen people died. There have been cases in which dozens or even hundreds of Poles and Jews have been murdered in individual executions. On May 29, 1943, a great massacre of Pawiak prisoners took place in the former ghetto, during which about 530 people were killed.Regina Doma≈Ñska: Pawiak... op.cit., p. 326. The execution echoed widely in occupied Warsaw ‚Äì it was then that the inscriptions \\"Pawiak pom≈õcimy\\" (We'll avenge Pawiak) began to appear on a large scale on the walls of the city.W≈Çadys≈Çaw Bartoszewski: Warszawski pier≈õcie≈Ñ ≈õmierci... op.cit., p. 268. On June 24, 1943, about 200 people died in the next big execution in the ghetto.W≈Çadys≈Çaw Bartoszewski: Warszawski pier≈õcie≈Ñ ≈õmierci... op.cit., p. 447. On July 15, 1943, from 260 to 300Regina Doma≈Ñska: Pawiak... op.cit.,. 337. people were shot there ‚Äì Poles and Jews arrested as a result of the so- called scandal of the Polish Hotel. The next day, 132 more prisoners of Pawiak were executed in the camp at Gƒôsia Street.  Executions during Kutschera's rule  Announcement of the execution of 60 Polish hostages and a list of 40 new hostages taken by Nazi authorities in Poland, 3 December 3 In October 1943 German terror against the people of Warsaw was dramatically intensified. The Germans intensified their efforts throughout the General Government to break the growing Polish resistance movement. On October 2, 1943, Hans Frank's ordinance \\"On combating attacks on the German work of reconstruction in the General Government\\" was announced. It sanctioned the principle of collective responsibility fully applied by the occupying power, providing, among other things, that \\"instigators and helpers are punishable as perpetrators\\" and that \\"an attempt to commit a crime is punishable as a committed crime\\". The only form of punishment provided for in the Regulation was the death penalty.W≈Çadys≈Çaw Bartoszewski: Warszawski pier≈õcie≈Ñ ≈õmierci... op.cit., p. 283. In Warsaw, the intensification of the Nazi terror was also caused by the fact that SS-Brigadef√ºhrer Franz Kutschera took over the function of the SS and Police Commander for the Warsaw district (September 25, 1943). The new SS- und Polizeif√ºhrer advocated a hard hand policy towards the nations conquered by the Third Reich. He wanted to pacify Warsaw by means of mass executions of Hostages, carried out in retaliation for every anti-German act. However, executions were to be carried out not only in the ruins of the ghetto, but also in an open manner ‚Äì on the streets of Warsaw. The Germans hoped that in this way they would be able to intimidate the capital's population and at the same time drive a wedge between the resistance movement and ordinary citizens.W≈Çadys≈Çaw Bartoszewski: Warszawski pier≈õcie≈Ñ ≈õmierci... op.cit., p. 289. The intensification of the occupant's policy was communicated in Warsaw by a wave of round-ups of unprecedented intensity, which fell on the city on October 13, 1943 and since then have been organized by the Germans almost daily ‚Äì even several times during a single day and in many parts of the city.W≈Çadys≈Çaw Bartoszewski: Warszawski pier≈õcie≈Ñ ≈õmierci... op.cit., p. 284 i 291. The first of numerous street executions took place on October 16, 1943, on Niedpodleg≈Ço≈õci Avenue (at the corner of Madali≈Ñski Street).Les≈Çaw M. Bartelski: Mokot√≥w 1944. Warszawa: wydawnictwo MON, 1971, p. 100. In order to have an appropriate psychological effect, names of the victims were read out by street megaphones, together with the announcement of shooting of the next group of hostages (named after them) in case of another anti-German attack in Warsaw. After some time, megaphone announcements were replaced by written announcements on the walls (Bekanntmachung). The infamous Posters, printed on pink paper and usually bearing the anonymous signature \\"SS and Police Commander for the district of Warsaw\\", appeared for the first time on the streets of Warsaw on October 30, 1943. Mass roundups and executions, in which hundreds of innocent people were killed, shocked Warsaw. While German repressions were usually directed against specific social or political groups, the terror perpetrated by Kutschera was basically used in a random manner. Next to political prisoners arrested by the Gestapo, ordinary Warsaw residents who were accidentally detained during round-ups died in great numbers.W≈Çadys≈Çaw Bartoszewski: Warszawski pier≈õcie≈Ñ ≈õmierci... op.cit., p. 288-289. However, while street executions naturally attracted public attention, the simultaneous action of secret elimination of hostages in the ruins of the ghetto took on a much larger scale. Between October 15, 1943 and May 15, 1944, the Germans executed almost 5000 people in the city and its immediate vicinity (about 270‚Äì300 people a week), of whom about 3800 were shot in the ruins of the ghetto.W≈Çadys≈Çaw Bartoszewski: Warszawski pier≈õcie≈Ñ ≈õmierci... op.cit., p. 372 i 448‚Äì449. This means that there were 3‚Äì4 people murdered secretly in the ghetto per 1 person killed in a street execution. At that time, executions in the ruins of the ghetto were carried out not only daily, but often even several times in a single day. Dozens or even hundreds of prisoners of Pawiak or ordinary Warsaw citizens detained during round-ups were repeatedly killed in single executions. One of the biggest executions in Pawiak's history, which lasted several hours until 4:00 am, took place during the night from October 17 to 18, 1943. Naked prisoners were led out of the prison in groups and shot with machine guns on the section of 36‚Äì42 Pawia Street and 37‚Äì42 Dzielna Street, about 600 people were killed. Rumors spread later in prison that the execution was so horrible that one of the SS soldiers did not endure the mental stress and committed suicide.Regina Doma≈Ñska: Pawiak... op.cit., p. 362‚Äì363. On October 23, 1943, about 300 hostages, brought the day before from Praga, were executed in the ruins.W≈Çadys≈Çaw Bartoszewski: Warszawski pier≈õcie≈Ñ ≈õmierci... op.cit., p. 293. Mass executions also took place on November 12 and 13 (about 240 and 120 victims, respectively),W≈Çadys≈Çaw Bartoszewski: Warszawski pier≈õcie≈Ñ ≈õmierci... op.cit., p. 302 i 305. December 9 (about 146 victims, including 16 Jewish women with one young child),W≈Çadys≈Çaw Bartoszewski: Warszawski pier≈õcie≈Ñ ≈õmierci... op.cit., p. 328. December 14 (about 230 victims),Regina Doma≈Ñska: Pawiak... op.cit., p. 389-390. December 16 (about 100 victims),W≈Çadys≈Çaw Bartoszewski: Warszawski pier≈õcie≈Ñ ≈õmierci... op.cit., p. 336. January 13, 1944 (about 260 victims)W≈Çadys≈Çaw Bartoszewski: Warszawski pier≈õcie≈Ñ ≈õmierci... op.cit., p. 349. and January 28 (about 170‚Äì180 victims).W≈Çadys≈Çaw Bartoszewski: Warszawski pier≈õcie≈Ñ ≈õmierci... op.cit., p. 355. At the same time, according to the information provided by the underground cells operating in Pawiak, in November 1943, the Germans started to erase the traces of previous executions and evidence of crimes committed while the Warsaw Ghetto was still in existence. Labour units composed of KL Warschau prisoners began to extract bodies from mass graves hidden in the former ghetto or in the Jewish cemetery under the supervision of the Germans. The exhumed corpses were then burned or blasted with explosives.Regina Doma≈Ñska: Pawiak... op.cit., p. 372 and 375. According to Regina Doma≈Ñska, on November 17, 1943, Germans gathered about 300 men in the ruins of one of the houses in the former ghetto, and then blew up the building.Regina Doma≈Ñska: Pawiak... op.cit., p. 373. On February 1, 1944, soldiers of the \\"Pegasus\\" unit belonging to Kedyw AK carried out a successful attack on Kutschera in Ujazd√≥w Avenue. Most of the victims of the retaliatory executions carried out by the Germans in the following days were murdered in the ruins of the ghetto. As early as February 2, Germans shot 300 Polish hostages, 100 of whom were executed in a street execution at the corner of Ujazd√≥w and Chopin Avenues (near the assassination point), and the remaining 200 in the ghetto.Regina Doma≈Ñska: Pawiak... op.cit., p. 414. Another mass executions in the ruins took place on February 3 (about 150 victims),Regina Doma≈Ñska: Pawiak... op.cit., p. 415. February 10 (about 330 victims)W≈Çadys≈Çaw Bartoszewski: Warszawski pier≈õcie≈Ñ ≈õmierci... op.cit., p. 364. and February 15 (about 210 victims, including 18 women).W≈Çadys≈Çaw Bartoszewski: Warszawski pier≈õcie≈Ñ ≈õmierci... op.cit., p. 368.  Last months of the occupation  After the death of Kutschera, the German terror against people of Warsaw was clearly reduced. The Germans decided not to carry out street executions, and stopped informing about the execution of hostages by means of megaphone announcements and posters. One could clearly feel the desire of the occupants not to give Poles the opportunity to manifest patriotic feelings. However, the extermination process in the ruins of the ghetto continued on a full scale.W≈Çadys≈Çaw Bartoszewski: Warszawski pier≈õcie≈Ñ ≈õmierci... op.cit., p. 371. In the spring of 1944, dozens or even hundreds of Pawiak prisoners or people brought from the city for execution were being killed almost daily.Regina Doma≈Ñska: Pawiak... op.cit., p. 449. On February 22, 1944, about 312 people were executed in the ruins of the ghetto.W≈Çadys≈Çaw Bartoszewski: Warszawski pier≈õcie≈Ñ ≈õmierci... op.cit., p. 373. On February 28, about 100 prisoners of Pawiak were executed.Regina Doma≈Ñska: Pawiak... op.cit., p. 427. On March 4, another 84‚Äì100 prisoners (including 4 Jewish women) were killed in the ruins. Their bodies were thrown into the cellars of a demolished house at Nowolipie Street (corner of Karmelicka Street) and set on fire. Some of the severely wounded convicts were burnt alive.W≈Çadys≈Çaw Bartoszewski: Warszawski pier≈õcie≈Ñ ≈õmierci... op.cit., p. 377.Regina Doma≈Ñska: Pawiak... op.cit., p. 431. Six days later, 40 Jews captured in a hiding place at Gr√≥jecka Street and a few Poles who gave them shelter (Mieczys≈Çaw Wolski and W≈Çadys≈Çaw Marczak with their families) were shot in the ghetto. One of the murdered Jews was the famous Jewish historian Emanuel Ringelblum.Regina Doma≈Ñska: Pawiak... op.cit., p. 433. On March 21, another 200 people were murdered in the ghetto, mainly inhabitants of Villages near Warsaw. Until the late evening hours, the glow over the crematorium of KL Warschau was visible in the city and the smell of burning bodies was evident.Regina Doma≈Ñska: Pawiak... op.cit., p. 437. Mass executions in the ghetto ruins also took place on March 16 (ca. 185 victims), March 29 (ca. 100‚Äì150 victims), March 30 (ca. 95 victims), March 31 (ca. 140 victims, of which ca. 100‚Äì150 were brought from ≈Åowicz), April 6‚Äì7 (approx. 100), April 13 (approx. 115), April 14 (approx. 154‚Äì163), April 15 (approx. 100), April 17 (about 140 victims), April 26 (about 110), 11 May (about 120‚Äì130 victims, including a Russian woman and some Jews), 19 May (about 103 victims), 20 May (about 160‚Äì200), 22 May (about 200), 27 May (about 100), June 5/6 (about 110), June 9/10 (about 100).W≈Çadys≈Çaw Bartoszewski: Warszawski pier≈õcie≈Ñ ≈õmierci... op.cit., p. 450. In addition, there were several executions of small groups of prisoners (often of Jewish origin), the number of whom is difficult to determine.W≈Çadys≈Çaw Bartoszewski: Warszawski pier≈õcie≈Ñ ≈õmierci... op.cit., p. 382. After the unsuccessful rebellion of the prisoners of Pawiak's third unit (a night from July 19 to 20, 1944), 154 (according to other sources ‚Äì 173) unfortunate escapees were shot in the ruins of the ghetto.W≈Çadys≈Çaw Bartoszewski: Warszawski pier≈õcie≈Ñ ≈õmierci... op.cit., p. 414-415. As the eastern front was approaching, the Germans started to dismantle Pawiak at the end of July 1944. The great evacuation transport, which included over 1800 prisoners, left Warsaw on July 30.W≈Çadys≈Çaw Bartoszewski: Warszawski pier≈õcie≈Ñ ≈õmierci... op.cit., p. 416. Before that, activities aimed at erasing the evidence of crimes committed in Warsaw had also been intensified (e.g. on June 8 the ruins of a house on Nowolipki Street, where executions were regularly carried out were blown up).Regina Doma≈Ñska: Pawiak... op.cit., p. 374. On August 13, 1944, almost two weeks after the outbreak of the Warsaw Uprising, the last execution took place in the ruins of the ghetto. At that time the Germans shot about 100 people ‚Äì prisoners of Pawiak, who could not be evacuated from Warsaw before the outbreak of the uprising. There were 18 women among the victims, including two midwives with newborns.W≈Çadys≈Çaw Bartoszewski: Warszawski pier≈õcie≈Ñ ≈õmierci... op.cit., p. 420.  Number of victims  It is impossible to determine the exact number of victims of executions carried out in the ruins of the Warsaw Ghetto. Historian calculated that between January 1, 1943 and July 31, 1944, in secret or open executions carried out in Warsaw, the German occupiers murdered about 20,500 people,Bogus≈Çaw Kopka: Konzentrationslager Warschau... op.cit, p. 60. most of whom were in all probability executed in the former ghetto. According to IPN historians, around 20,000 people were murdered in the ruins of the ghetto between 1943 and 1944, including around 10,000 Poles.Bogus≈Çaw Kopka: Konzentrationslager Warschau... op.cit, p. 16 and 120. It is difficult to determine, however, how many of the murdered were prisoners of KL Warschau (mostly Jews from various European countries) and how many were the residents of Warsaw or the surrounding towns shot in retaliation executions. Hence, the probable number of victims of murders carried out in the ruins of the Warsaw Ghetto amounts to several thousand. According to W≈Çadys≈Çaw Bartoszewski's calculations ‚Äì based mainly on estimates of underground reports of the Pawiak cells and covering only those executions in which it was possible to determine at least the approximate number of victims ‚Äì about 9600 people were murdered in the ruins of the ghetto between May 7, 1943 and August 13, 1944.W≈Çadys≈Çaw Bartoszewski: Warszawski pier≈õcie≈Ñ ≈õmierci... op.cit., p. 445-450. The following people were murdered in the ruins of the ghetto: Miko≈Çaj Arciszewski (a journalist, cartoonist, head of one of the Soviet intelligence networks in Warsaw), Mieczys≈Çaw Bilek (president of the underground Democratic Party, former President of Gdynia), S≈Çawomir Bittner (company commander in the Home Army Battalion \\"Zo≈õka\\"), Stanis≈Çaw Chudoba (leader of the Polish Socialist Workers' Party), Tytus Czaki (one of the organizers of the Riflemen's Association, pre-war President of Brest and W≈Çoc≈Çawek), Hanna Czaki (daughter of Tytus, scout, liaison officer and secretary of the Information Department in the Information and Propaganda Bureau of the Home Army), Pawe≈Ç Finder and Ma≈Çgorzata Fornalska (leaders of the Polish Workers' Party), Tadeusz Hollender (poet, satirist, publicist), lieutenant Jan H√∂rl alias Frog (Home Army soldier, Silent Unseen/Cichociemny), Gustaw Kale≈Ñski (historian, archivist, captain of the Polish Army in retirement), Stefan Kapu≈õci≈Ñski (Silesian trade union and political activist), Mieczys≈Çaw Kotarbi≈Ñski (painter, graphic designer), dr J√≥zef Lewicki (pedagogue, upbringing historian, lecturer at the Free Polish University in Warsaw), prof. Tadeusz Pruszkowski (painter, art critic, pedagogue), Emanuel Ringelblum (famous historian of Jewish origin), Colonel J√≥zef Rosiek (inspector of the Warsaw Home Army), Stefan Sacha (president of the Main Board of the underground National Party).  Perpetrators  Responsibility for the management of thousands of murders committed in the ruins of the Warsaw Ghetto falls primarily on the SS and Police Commanders in the Warsaw district, who held their positions from May 1943 to August 1944. That includes: SS- Brigadef√ºhrer J√ºrgen Strop (sentenced to death by a Polish court after the war and executed on March 6, 1952), SS-Brigadef√ºhrer Franz Kutschera (killed by the soldiers of Kedyw AK on February 1, 1944), SS-Oberf√ºhrer Herbert B√∂ttcher (sentenced to death by a Polish court after the war and executed on June 12, 1950) and SS-Oberf√ºhrer Paul Otto Geibel (sentenced to life imprisonment by a Polish court after the war, committed suicide in the Mokot√≥w prison in 1966).W≈Çadys≈Çaw Bartoszewski: Warszawski pier≈õcie≈Ñ ≈õmierci... op.cit., p. 424. Dr Ludwig Hahn, the commander of the German security police and service in Warsaw, played a special role in the extermination operation. Hahn ‚Äì the originator of the idea of adapting the ruins of the ghetto to the extermination of the Warsaw population and the spiritus movens of all terrorist and extermination activities carried out against the Polish and Jewish population of Warsaw in 1941‚Äì1944 ‚Äì lived in Hamburg under his real name for many years after the war.W≈Çadys≈Çaw Bartoszewski: Warszawski pier≈õcie≈Ñ ≈õmierci... op.cit., p. 434. He was not brought to court until 1972 and was sentenced to 12 years' imprisonment after a one-year trial. The Hamburg sworn court changed the sentence to life imprisonment during the revision process. Hahn was released in 1983, however, and died three years later.Bogus≈Çaw Kopka: Konzentrationslager Warschau... op.cit, p. 99-100. Executions in the ruins of the ghetto were carried out by:Bogus≈Çaw Kopka: Konzentrationslager Warschau... op.cit, p. 26, 60, 62. * Officers of the Warsaw SD facility and the security police, under the supervision of Dr. Hahn, whose seat was located in Szuch Avenue; * Pawiak staff members; * KL Warschau staff members; * SS-men from the Third Battalion of the 23rd SS Regiment and the Police (Battalion III/SS- Polizei Regiment 23), commanded by Major Otton Bundtke.Bundtke's Battalion stayed in the former ghetto and worked on its pacification after the official suppression of the uprising. Both open and secret executions carried out in Warsaw were repeatedly led by SS-Obersturmf√ºhrer Norbert Bergh-Trips, SS- Haupturmf√ºhrer Paul Werner and SS-Obersturmf√ºhrer Walter Witossek.

She served on the front line in France throughout the First World War, despite being injured in a shellfire attack. She was awarded the Legion d'Honneur and the Croix de Guerre, which makes her one of the most highly decorated nurses of any country in WW1. She also received the British War Medal and Victory Medal from the British Government, but was never recognised by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.  Background  Annie Brewer was born in Newport, South Wales, on 21 November 1874. At the age of 24 she qualified as a nurse of 'insane persons' and worked in hospitals around Britain including in London and Chester, before travelling around Europe as a personal nurse and companion.  War record  While in Paris in 1914, WWI broke out and she joined up with French nursing and ambulance services, the Fondation Baye, seeing action in war zones including the Marne, the Somme and Verdun. She helped with 229 operations in 7 days at the battle of Verdun. On one occasion the ambulance in which she was travelling was shelled and she was wounded in the head and leg. She also came under shellfire while working in a French hospital. The strain led to a period of serious illness, but she insisted on returning to duty once she recovered.  Marriage  Her work fed over into her personal life when she met French ambulance driver, Daniel Mistrick, marrying him on the Verdun battlefield according to French genealogy sources. She remained in Europe, working at a feeding station in Germany after the war ended with the French army of occupation.  Death  In 1921, she returned to Newport to nurse her ailing mother at 23 West Street, but was herself seriously ill and died of kidney disease, Bright's disease, on 30 January 1921 aged 46. Although she is buried at St. Woolos cemetery, she currently does not have a war grave.

Conditional probability values represent degrees of belief based on the assumption of some received evidence. PIL studies prior probability functions on the set of sentences and evaluates the rationality of such prior probability functions through principles that such functions should arguably satisfy. Each of the principles directs the function to assign probability values and conditional probability values to sentences in some respect rationally. Not all desirable principles of PIL are compatible, so no prior probability function exists that satisfies them all. Some prior probability functions however are distinguished through satisfying an important collection of principles.  History Inductive logic started to take a clearer shape in the early 20th century in the work of William Ernest Johnson and John Maynard Keynes, and was further developed by Rudolf Carnap. Carnap introduced the distinction between pure and applied inductive logic,Rudolf Carnap (1971). A Basic System of Inductive Logic, in Studies in Inductive Logic and Probability, Volume 1, pp 69-70. and the modern Pure Inductive Logic evolves along the lines of the pure, uninterpreted approach envisaged by Carnap. Framework =General case= In its basic form, PIL uses first order logic without equality, with the usual connectives \\\\wedge, \\\\vee, eg, \\\\to (and, or, not and implies respectively), quantifiers \\\\exist, \\\\forall, finitely many predicate (relation) symbols, and countably many constant symbols a_1,a_2, a_3, \\\\ldots \\\\,. There are no function symbols. The predicate symbols can be unary, binary or of higher arities. The finite set of predicate symbols may vary while the rest of the language is fixed. It is a convention to refer to the language as L and write : L= \\\\\\\\{R_1,R_2, \\\\ldots R_q\\\\\\\\} where the R_i list the predicate symbols. The set of all sentences is denoted SL. If a sentence is written with constants appearing in it listed then it is assumed that the list includes at least all those that appear. {\\\\cal T}L is the set of structures for L with universe \\\\\\\\{a_1,a_2,a_3\\\\ldots\\\\\\\\} and with each constant symbol a_i interpreted as itself. A probability function for sentences of L is a function w with domain SL and values in the real interval [0,1] satisfying the following conditions: ‚Äì any logically valid sentence \\\\theta has probability 1\\\\\\\\!:\\\\, w(\\\\theta)=1 ‚Äì if sentences \\\\theta and \\\\phi are mutually exclusive then w(\\\\theta \\\\vee \\\\phi)= w(\\\\theta) + w(\\\\phi) ‚Äì for a formula \\\\psi(x) with one free variable the probability of \\\\exists x \\\\, \\\\psi(x) is the limit of probabilities of \\\\psi(a_1) \\\\vee \\\\psi(a_2) \\\\vee \\\\ldots \\\\vee \\\\psi(a_n) as n tends to \\\\infty. This last condition, which goes beyond the standard Kolmogorov axioms (for finite additivity) is referred to as Gaifman's Axiom and it is intended to capture the idea that the a_i exhaust the universe. For a probability function w and a sentence \\\\phi with w(\\\\phi)>0, the corresponding conditional probability function w(.\\\\phi) is defined by :~~~~~~~~~~~~~~w(\\\\theta \\\\mid \\\\phi) = \\\\frac{w(\\\\theta \\\\wedge \\\\varphi)}{w(\\\\varphi)} ~~~~~~~( \\\\theta \\\\in SL). Unlike belief functions in many valued logics, it is not the case that the probability value of a compound sentence is determined by the probability values of its components. Probability respects the classical semantics: logically equivalent sentences must be given the same probability. Hence logically equivalent sentences are often identified. A state description for a finite set of constants is a conjunction of atomic sentences - predicates or their negations - instantiated exclusively by these constants, such that for any eligible atomic sentence either it or its negation (but not both) appears in the conjunction. Any probability function is uniquely determined by its values on state descriptions. To define a probability function, it suffices to specify nonnegative values of all state descriptions for a_1, \\\\ldots,a_n (for all n) so that the values of all state descriptions for a_1, \\\\ldots,a_n, a_{n+1} extending a given state description for a_1, \\\\ldots,a_n sum to the value of the state description they all extend, with the convention that the (only) state description for no constants is a tautology and that has value 1. If \\\\Theta is a state description for a set of constants including a_i,a_j then it is said that a_i,a_j are indistinguishable in \\\\Theta, a_i \\\\sim_\\\\Theta a_j, just when upon adding equality to the language (and axioms of equality to the logic) the sentence \\\\Theta \\\\wedge a_i=a_j is consistent. \\\\,\\\\sim_\\\\Theta is an equivalence relation. =Unary case= In the special case of Unary PIL, all the predicates R_1, \\\\ldots, R_q are unary. Formulae of the form :~~~~~~~~~~~~\\\\beta(x) = \\\\pm R_1(x)\\\\wedge \\\\pm R_2(x) \\\\wedge \\\\ldots \\\\wedge \\\\pm R_q(x) where \\\\pm R stands for one of R, eg R, are called atoms. It is assumed that they are listed in some fixed order as \\\\beta_1, \\\\beta_2,\\\\ldots, \\\\beta_{2^q}. A state description specifies an atom for each constant involved in it, and it can be written as a conjunction of these atoms instantiated by the corresponding constants. Two constants are indistinguishable in the state description if it specifies the same atom for both of them. Central question Assume a rational agent inhabits a structure in {\\\\cal T}L but knows nothing about which one it is. What probability function w should s/he adopt when w(\\\\theta) is to represent his/her degree of belief that a sentence \\\\theta is true in this ambient structure? Rational principles =General rational principles= The following principles have been proposed as desirable properties of a rational prior probability function w for L. The constant exchangeability principle, Ex. The probability of a sentence \\\\theta(a_1,a_2, \\\\ldots, a_m) does not change when the a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots, a_m in it are replaced by any other m-tuple of (distinct) constants. The principle of predicate exchangeability, Px. If R,R' are predicates of the same arity then for a sentence \\\\theta, :w(\\\\theta)=w(\\\\theta') where \\\\theta' is the result of simultaneously replacing R by R' and R' by R throughout \\\\theta. The strong negation principle, SN. For a predicate R and sentence \\\\theta , :w(\\\\theta)=w(\\\\theta') where \\\\theta' is the result of simultaneously replacing R by eg R and eg R by R throughout \\\\theta. The principle of regularity, Reg. If a quantifier-free sentence \\\\theta is satisfiable then w(\\\\theta) >0. The principle of super regularity (universal certainty), SReg. If a sentence \\\\theta is satisfiable then w(\\\\theta) >0. The constant irrelevance principle, IP. If sentences \\\\theta, \\\\phi have no constants in common then w(\\\\theta \\\\wedge \\\\phi) = w(\\\\theta) \\\\cdot w(\\\\phi). The weak irrelevance principle, WIP. If sentences \\\\theta, \\\\phi have no constants nor predicates in common then w(\\\\theta \\\\wedge \\\\phi) = w(\\\\theta) \\\\cdot w(\\\\phi). Language invariance principle, Li. There is a family of probability functions w^{J}, one on each language J, all satisfying Px and Ex, and such that w^L=w and if all predicates of J belong also to K then w^J and w^K agree on sentences of J. The (strong) counterpart principle, CP. If \\\\theta, \\\\theta' are sentences such that \\\\theta' is the result of replacing some constant/relation symbols in \\\\theta by new constant/relation symbols of the same arity not occurring in \\\\theta then :w(\\\\theta \\\\mid \\\\theta') \\\\geq w(\\\\theta). (SCP) If moreover \\\\theta is the result of replacing the same and possibly also additional constant/relation symbols in \\\\theta by new constant/relation symbols of the same arity not occurring in \\\\theta then :w(\\\\theta \\\\mid \\\\theta') \\\\geq w(\\\\theta \\\\mid \\\\theta) \\\\geq w(\\\\theta). The Invariance Principle, INV. If F is an isomorphism of the Lindenbaum-Tarski algebra of sentences of L supported by some permutation \\\\mu of {\\\\cal T} L in the sense that for sentences \\\\theta, \\\\phi, :F([\\\\theta]) = [\\\\phi]~ just when ~ M \\\\models \\\\theta \\\\Longleftrightarrow \\\\mu(M) \\\\models \\\\phi then w(\\\\theta) = w(\\\\phi). The Permutation Invariance Principle, PIP. As INV except that F is additionally required to map (equivalence classes of) state descriptions to (equivalence classes of) state descriptions. The Spectrum Exchangeability Principle, Sx. The probability w(\\\\Theta) of a state description \\\\Theta depends only on the spectrum of \\\\Theta, that is, on the multiset of sizes of equivalence classes with respect to the equivalence relation \\\\sim_\\\\Theta. Li with Sx. As the Language Invariance Principle but all the probability functions in the family also satisfy Spectrum Exchangeability. The Principle of Induction, PI. Let \\\\Theta be a state description and a_k a constant not appearing in \\\\Theta. Let \\\\Phi, \\\\Psi be state descriptions extending \\\\Theta to include (just) a_k. If a_k is \\\\sim_\\\\Phi-equivalent to some and at least as many constants as it is \\\\sim_\\\\Psi-equivalent to then w(\\\\Phi\\\\mid \\\\Theta) \\\\geq w(\\\\Psi \\\\mid \\\\Theta). =Further rational principles for unary PIL = The Principle of Instantial Relevance, PIR. For a sentence \\\\theta, atom \\\\beta and constants a_k,a_m not appearing in \\\\theta, :w(\\\\beta(a_k) \\\\mid \\\\beta(a_m) \\\\wedge \\\\theta) \\\\geq w(\\\\beta(a_k) \\\\mid \\\\theta). The Generalized Principle of Instantial Relevance, GPIR. For quantifier-free sentences \\\\psi(a_k), \\\\phi(a_m), \\\\theta with constants a_k,a_m not appearing in \\\\theta, if \\\\psi(x) \\\\models \\\\phi(x) then : w( \\\\psi(a_{k}) \\\\mid \\\\phi(a_{m}) \\\\wedge \\\\theta) \\\\geq w( \\\\psi(a_{k}) \\\\mid \\\\theta). Johnson Sufficientness Principle, JSP. For a state description \\\\Theta for n constants, atom \\\\beta and constant a_k not appearing in \\\\Theta, the probability :w(\\\\beta(a_k)\\\\mid \\\\Theta) depends only on n and on the number of constants for which \\\\Theta specifies \\\\beta. The Principle of Atom Exchangeability, Ax. If \\\\tau is a permutation of \\\\\\\\{1,2, \\\\ldots, 2^q\\\\\\\\} and \\\\Theta is a state description expressed as a conjunction of instantiated atoms then w(\\\\Theta)=w(\\\\Theta') where \\\\Theta' obtains from \\\\Theta upon replacing each \\\\beta_i by \\\\beta_{\\\\tau(i)}. Reichenbach's Axiom, RA. Let \\\\beta_{h_i} for i=1,2,3,\\\\ldots be an infinite sequence of atoms and \\\\beta an atom. Then as n tends to \\\\infty, the difference between the conditional probability :w(\\\\beta(a_{n+1}) \\\\mid \\\\beta_{h_1}(a_1) \\\\wedge \\\\beta_{h_2}(a_2) \\\\wedge \\\\ldots \\\\wedge \\\\beta_{h_n}(a_n)) and the proportion of occurrences of \\\\beta amongst the \\\\beta_{h_1}, \\\\beta_{h_2}, \\\\ldots ,\\\\beta_{h_n} tends to 0. Principle of Induction for Unary languages, UPI. For a state description \\\\Theta, atoms \\\\beta_i, \\\\beta_j and constant a_k not appearing in \\\\Theta, if \\\\Theta specifies \\\\beta_i for at least as many constants as \\\\beta_j then :w(\\\\beta_i(a_k)\\\\mid \\\\Theta) \\\\geq w(\\\\beta_j(a_k)\\\\mid \\\\Theta). Recovery. Whenever \\\\Psi(a_1,a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n) is a state description then there is another state description \\\\Phi(a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \\\\ldots, a_{h}) such that w(\\\\Phi \\\\wedge \\\\Psi) eq 0 and for any quantifier free sentence \\\\theta(a_{h+1},a_{h+2}, \\\\ldots, a_{h+g}), :w(\\\\theta(a_{h+1},a_{h+2}, \\\\ldots, a_{h+g})\\\\,\\\\,\\\\Phi \\\\wedge \\\\Psi) =w(\\\\theta(a_{h+1},a_{h+2}, \\\\ldots, a_{h+g})). Unary Language Invariance Principle, ULi. As Li, but with the languages restricted to the unary ones. ULi with Ax. As ULi but with all the probability functions in the family also satisfying Atom Exchangeability. Relationships between principles =General Case= Sx implies Ex, Px and SN. PIP + Ex implies Sx. INV implies PIP and Ex. Li implies CP and SCP. Li with Sx implies PI. =Unary case= Ex implies PIR. Ax is equivalent to PIP. Ax+Ex implies UPI. Ax+Ex is equivalent to Sx. ULi with Ax implies Li with Sx. Important probability functions =General probability functions= Functions V_M. For a given structure M \\\\in {\\\\cal T} L and \\\\theta \\\\in SL, :V_M(\\\\theta)= \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\begin{array}{ll} 1& {\\\\rm if}~ M\\\\models \\\\theta,\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0&{\\\\rm otherwise}.\\\\end{array} \\\\right. Functions \\\\omega^{\\\\Psi}. For a given state description \\\\Psi(a_1,a_2, \\\\ldots, a_K), \\\\,\\\\omega^{\\\\Psi} is defined via specifying its values for state descriptions as follows. \\\\,\\\\omega^{\\\\Psi}(\\\\Theta(a_1,a_2, \\\\ldots, a_n)) is the probability that when a_{h_1},a_{h_2}, \\\\ldots, a_{h_n} are randomly picked from \\\\\\\\{a_1, \\\\ldots,a_K\\\\\\\\}, with replacement and according to the uniform distribution, then \\\\Psi(a_1, \\\\ldots, a_K) \\\\models \\\\Theta(a_{h_1},a_{h_2}, \\\\ldots, a_{h_n}). Functions ^\\\\circ \\\\\\\\! (\\\\omega^\\\\Psi). As above but employing a non-standard universe (starting with a possibly non-standard state description \\\\Psi) to obtain the standard ^\\\\circ \\\\\\\\! (\\\\omega^\\\\Psi). \\\\bullet The ^\\\\circ \\\\\\\\! (\\\\omega^{\\\\Psi}) are the only probability functions that satisfy Ex and IP. Functions u^{\\\\overline{p}}. For a given infinite sequence \\\\overline{p} = \\\\langle p_0,p_1,p_2,p_3, \\\\ldots \\\\rangle of non-negative reals such that :p_1 \\\\geq p_2 \\\\geq p_3 \\\\geq \\\\ldots \\\\geq 0\\\\, \\\\, and ~\\\\sum_{i=0}^\\\\infty p_i = 1, u^{\\\\overline{p}} is defined via specifying its values for state descriptions as follows: For a sequence \\\\vec{c} = \\\\langle c_1,c_2, \\\\ldots, c_n\\\\rangle of natural numbers and a state description \\\\Theta(a_{1}, a_{2}, \\\\ldots, a_{n}), \\\\Theta is consistent with \\\\vec{c} if whenever c_s=c_t eq 0 then a_{s} \\\\sim_\\\\Theta a_{t}. C(\\\\vec{c}) is the number of state descriptions for a_{1}, a_{2}, \\\\ldots, a_{n} consistent with \\\\vec{c}. \\\\,u^{\\\\overline{p}}(\\\\Theta) is the sum over those \\\\vec{c} with which \\\\Theta is compatible, of : C(\\\\vec{c})^{-1} \\\\prod_{s=1}^n p_{c_s}. \\\\bullet The u^{\\\\overline{p}} are the only probability functions that satisfy WIP and Li with Sx. (The language invariant family witnessing Li with Sx consists of the functions u^{\\\\overline{p}, J} with fixed \\\\overline{p}, where u^{\\\\overline{p}, J} is as u^{\\\\overline{p}} but defined with language J.) =Further probability functions (unary PIL)= Functions w\\\\vec{c}. For a vector \\\\vec{c} = \\\\langle c_1,c_2, \\\\ldots, c_{2^q}\\\\rangle of non-negative real numbers summing to one, w\\\\vec{c} is defined via specifying its values for state descriptions as follows: :w\\\\vec{c}(\\\\Theta )= \\\\prod_{j=1}^{2^q} c_{j}^{m_j} where m_j the is number of constants for which \\\\Theta specifies \\\\beta_j. \\\\bullet The w\\\\vec{c} are the only probability functions that satisfy Ex and IP (they are also expressible as ^\\\\circ \\\\\\\\! (w^{\\\\Psi}) ). Carnap continuum functions c_{\\\\lambda}.\\\\, For \\\\lambda>0, the probability function c_\\\\lambda is uniquely determined by the values : c_\\\\lambda( \\\\beta_j(a_{n+1}) \\\\mid \\\\Theta )=\\\\frac{m_j + \\\\lambda2^{-q}}{n + \\\\lambda} where \\\\Theta is a state description for n constants not including a_k and m_j is the number of constants for which \\\\Theta specifies \\\\beta_j. Furthermore, c_\\\\infty is the probability function that assigns 2^{-nq} to every state description for n constants and c_0 is the probability function that assigns 2^{-q} to any state description in which all constants are indistinguishable, 0 to any other state description. \\\\bullet The c_\\\\lambda are the only probability functions that satisfy Ex and JSP. \\\\bullet They also satisfy Li ‚Äì the functions c^{J}_\\\\lambda with fixed \\\\lambda, where c^{J}_\\\\lambda is as c_\\\\lambda but defined with language J provide the unary language-invariant family members. Functions w^{\\\\delta}. For -(2^q-1)^{-1} \\\\leq \\\\delta \\\\leq 1, w^{\\\\delta} is the average of the 2^q functions w\\\\vec{c} where \\\\vec{c} has all but one coordinate equal to each other with the odd coordinate differing from them by \\\\delta, so : w^\\\\delta= 2^{-q} \\\\sum_{i=1}^{2^q} w\\\\vec{e_i} where \\\\vec{e_i} = \\\\langle \\\\gamma, \\\\gamma, \\\\ldots, \\\\gamma, \\\\gamma + \\\\delta, \\\\gamma, \\\\ldots, \\\\gamma \\\\rangle ~, (\\\\gamma+\\\\delta in ith place) and \\\\gamma = 2^{-q}(1-\\\\delta). For 0\\\\leq \\\\delta \\\\leq 1, the w^{\\\\delta} are equal to u^{\\\\bar{p}} for :\\\\bar{p} = \\\\langle 1-\\\\delta, \\\\delta, 0,0,0,\\\\ldots \\\\rangle and as such they satisfy Li. \\\\bullet The w^{\\\\delta} are the only functions that satisfy GPIR, Ex, Ax and Reg. \\\\bullet The w^{\\\\delta} with 0\\\\leq\\\\delta <1 are the only functions that satisfy Recovery, Reg and ULi with Ax. Representation theorems A representation theorem for a class of probability functions provides means of expressing every probability function in the class in terms of generic, relatively simple probability functions from the same class. Representation Theorem for all probability functions. Every probability function w for L can be represented as :w= \\\\int_{{\\\\cal T} L} V_M \\\\,d\\\\mu(M) where \\\\mu is a \\\\sigma- additive measure on the \\\\sigma-algebra of subsets of {\\\\cal T} L generated by the sets :\\\\\\\\{\\\\, M \\\\in {\\\\cal T} L \\\\mid M \\\\vDash \\\\theta\\\\,\\\\\\\\} ~ ~~~ (\\\\theta \\\\in SL). Representation Theorem for Ex (employing non-standard analysis and Loeb Integration TheoryCutland, N.J., Loeb measure theory, in Developments in Nonstandard Mathematics, Eds. N.J.Cutland, F.Oliveira, V.Neves, J.Sousa-Pinto, Pitman Research Notes in Mathematics Series, Vol. 336, Longman Press, 1995, pp151-177.). Every probability function w for L satisfying Ex can be represented as :w = \\\\int_A \\\\,^\\\\circ\\\\\\\\!(\\\\omega^{\\\\Psi}) \\\\, d\\\\mu(\\\\Psi) where A is an internal set of state descriptions for a_1,a_2, \\\\ldots, a_ u (with u a fixed infinite natural number) and \\\\mu is a \\\\sigma-additive measure on a \\\\sigma-algebra of subsets of A . Representation Theorem for Li with Sx. Every probability function w for L satisfying Li with Sx can be represented as :w = \\\\int_{\\\\mathbb B} \\\\,u^{\\\\overline{p}}\\\\, d\\\\mu(\\\\overline{p}) where {\\\\mathbb B} is the set of sequences :\\\\overline{p} = \\\\langle p_0,p_1,p_2,p_3, \\\\ldots \\\\rangle of non-negative reals summing to 1 and such that p_1 \\\\geq p_2 \\\\geq p_3 \\\\geq \\\\ldots \\\\,\\\\geq 0 \\\\, and \\\\mu is a \\\\sigma-additive measure on the Borel subsets of {\\\\mathbb B} in the product topology. de Finetti's Representation Theorem (unary). In the unary case (where L is a language containing q unary predicates), the representation theorem for Ex is equivalent to: Every probability function w for L satisfying Ex can be represented as : w= \\\\int_{\\\\mathbb D} w_{\\\\vec{x}}\\\\, d\\\\mu(\\\\vec{x}). where {\\\\mathbb D} is the set of vectors \\\\vec{x} = \\\\langle x_1,x_2, \\\\ldots, x_{2^q}\\\\rangle of non-negative real numbers summing to one and \\\\mu is a \\\\sigma-additive measure on {\\\\mathbb D}.

Early life  Serafima Amosova was born in central Siberia on 20 August 1914 to a working family; her father worked at the local Chernorechenskaya railway depot. Her grandfather, Anton Amosov, had moved to Siberia in the late 19th century from Byelorussia. After graduating from school in 1929 she joined the Komsomol and found work as the leader of a pioneer detachment. In 1933 she was a delegate to the All-Union Conference of Pioneer Workers in Moscow. With dreams of becoming a pilot, she entered the OSOAVIAHIM but crashed her glider on the day she was due to graduate flight training. After recovering from her injuries she attended the Tambov Aviation School. In 1936 she graduated with honors and received her pilot's license, after she worked for Aeroflot as a pilot a Moscow - Irkutsk route. After escalation of the Second World War in January 1941 she was appointed squadron commander to train military-aged men at Yanaul Airport in Bashkortostan.  Military career  Just a few days after the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 Amosova and several other female instructors sent a letter requesting to be sent to the warfront. While male students were deployed to the warfront the female flight instructors were told to remain in Bashkortostan to train new cadets. After further persistence they were referred to Marina Raskova, the founder of three women's aviation regiments. After receiving that letter she immediately flew to Moscow to meet with Raskova, who accepted her into the regiment. After graduating from Engels Military Aviation School in May 1942 with the rank of lieutenant she was deployed to the Southern Front as a squadron commander in the 588th Night Bomber Regiment, later renamed as the 46th Guards Night Bomber Regiment in 1943. Due to being one of the most experienced pilots of the regiment she was quickly promoted to deputy commander of flight operations. During the regiment's first sortie she flew as pilot with navigator Larisa Litvinova who later became a Hero of the Soviet Union, carefully following the plane of regimental commander Yevdokia Bershanskaya and Sofya Burzaeva. On one mission when Amosova was flying as pilot to bomb an Axis headquarters, she delayed dropping her bombs because of the lack of anti-aircraft fire when she flew over the target, having expected anti-aircraft fire from such an important target. Suspecting they were over the wrong location she flew back to an aerial checkpoint and made another approach but was again met by a lack of anti-aircraft fire. Shocked that such an important target for bombing would not be protected by antiaircraft artillery, she returned to the checkpoint again and made a third approach, after which they released the bombs and waiting to see if there would be any counterattacks. Only after dropping the bombs did the Axis launch anti-aircraft fire, likely because they did not want to indicate the position of the target. She made a total of 555 missions in the war, having participated in night bombing campaigns in the North Caucasus, Stavropol, Kuban, Novorossiysk, Crimea, Kuban, Kerch, Belarus and Poland as well as airdropping supplies for the Eltigen landing and daylight missions in search of areas to use as airfields because the Po-2 light bombers were not assigned airports. Throughout the war she was awarded two Orders of the Red Banner, the Order of Alexander Nevsky, the Order of the Red Star, and an Order of the Patriotic War.  Later life  Not long after the end of the war, she married fellow airforce pilot Ivan Andreevich Taranenko and took his surname. Together the couple raised three sons, and all of them grew up to work in aviation or serve in the military. She worked as a magazine editor and spoke to youth about patriotism. She died in Moscow on 17 December 1992.

With NASL specific attacks can be automated, based on known vulnerabilities. Tens of thousands of plugins have been written in NASL for Nessus and OpenVAS. Files that are written in this language usually get the file extension .nasl. For the exploitation of a zero day attack it is possible for an end user of Nessus or OpenVAS to write custom code in NASL which is executed by these vulnerability scanners. In earlier versions of Nessus, a binary called nasl or nasl.exe was provided that could interpret NASL code to perform vulnerability scans. In later versions of Nessus, this should be done via an API that is provided by this software. An example of executing a NASL plugin 'myzeroday.nasl' on Windows, a command such as the following could be invoked: \`nasl.exe -t 127.0.0.1 \\"C:\\\\temp\\\\myzeroday.nasl\\"\` An equivalent example of a Linux or UNIX command could look like this: \`nasl -t 127.0.0.1 /tmp/myzeroday.nasl\` If the plugin, in this example myzeroday.nasl, is placed in the same directory where other NASL plugins are located, it can also be included in standard scans by Nessus or OpenVAS, via the Web GUI or an API.

The equestrian statue was created by the French sculptor Abraham- C√©sar Lamoureux. Dating from 1688, it was originally made in gilded lead but recast in bronze in 1939. Desculption With direct inspiration from the equestrian statue of Louis XIII at the centre of Place des Vosges, it depicts the king dressed like a Roman imperator with a Laurel wreathed helmet. The plinth is surrounded by four allegorical statues. Facing Charlottenborg Palace stand two figures of Minerva and Alexander the Great, representing prudence and fortitude, while the opposite side features statues of Herkules and Artemisia, personifications of strength and honour. Even though Lamoureux depicted the horse in a trot-like gait, with inspiration from Marcus Aurelius' horse at the Capitoline Hill, the design caused severe problems due to the soft metal used for the casting. The construction therefore had to be strengthened, and Lamoureux introduced a figure of a naked man crouched underneath the horse's hoof, personifying envy but in the same time affording support for the horse's barrel as the weakest point of the statue. History Shortly after Christian V was crowned in 1670, Kongens Nytorv was laid out as a place royale with inspiration from France. Land around the new square was distributed among interested wealthy citizens, including people from the new ranks. Buildings facing the square were required to have at least two stories and meet certain standards. The French sculptor Abraham-C√©sar Lamoureux was commissioned to create an equestrian statue of Christian V for the centre of the square. In 1688, a baroque garden complex with trees around a parterre and the gilded equestrian statue of Christian V in its centre, was inaugurated. In 1747 the entire square was rebuilt by Frederik V as a military drill and ceremony ground for the King's troops, which was used until 1908, when the square was re-shaped to its original design. The equestrian statue was created in gilded lead. Over the centuries the soft metal used for casting the statue resulted in problems, particularly with the horse's front left leg, and finally Professor Einar Utzon-Frank from the Danish Academy of Fine Arts was commissioned to recast the statue in bronze. This happened from 1939 to 1942 and the new cast was reinaugurated on 22 May 1946.

It was developed as a copy of the German V-1 flying bomb and was used to simulate bombers for training anti-aircraft artillery crews and fighter pilots. History The CT 10's design process began in August 1946 with reverse-engineering of V-1 missile stocks captured from the Luftwaffe. It was first launched from the Centre interarm√©es d'essais d'engins sp√©ciaux missile range near Colomb-Bechar, Algeria, in December 1949 and became operational in 1952. It was mass-produced by Nord in Ch√¢tillon and Villeurbanne. More than 400 copies were eventually built. The CT 10 was used primarily by France, though the United Kingdom, Italy, and Sweden used it as well. It was retired from French service during the 1950s in favour of more advanced derivatives such as the CT20 and CT41 but was still in widespread use by the British and Swedish air forces throughout the 1960s. Design The CT 10 was ground-launched or air-launched. When ground-launched, it would be propelled down a launch ramp by a pair of solid rockets. When air-launched, it would be released from a LeO 45 bomber. It was then engaged by fighter aircraft or ground-based guns and missiles. The CT 10's design is largely identical to that of the V-1 missile it was based on. However, there were some important differences between the two: * The CT 10 was scaled-down from the V-1: it is 6 m long, versus 8.32 m for the V-1. * The CT 10 was propelled down its launch ramp by a pair of solid rocket boosters, which had more thrust than the liquid-fueled Dampferzeuger (\\"Steam generator\\") used to launch the V-1. This allowed the CT 10's launch ramp to be considerably shorter. * The CT 10 was designed to be recovered, and therefore carried a parachute. * The CT 10 was radio-guided from a nearby ground station. Surviving examples A CT 10 is displayed in the Overlord Museum in Colleville-sur-Mer, France.

The magazine was created by Corinne Timsit and Eric Bonici in 2003 in Puerto Rico and is now based in Paris since 2014. ArtPremium begins as a magazine in Spanish dedicated to the Puerto Rican art scene, its first issues are subtitled: La revista de arte de Puerto Rico. ArtPremium remain the art magazine of Puerto Rico until 2008, when Corinne Timsit and Eric Bonici decide to internationalize the magazine. They create ArtPremium Newspaper to locally replace their magazine, ArtPremium then becomes a magazine entirely dedicated to contemporary art and ArtPremium TV to broadcast content adapted to the web. In parallel with its activities, ArtPremium develops a network of partners in major contemporary art fairs worldwide, by forming partnerships with : Art Basel, Art Basel Miami, Art Basel Hong-Kong, Fiac Paris, Art Paris art fair, The Armory Show New York. Its distribution focus on major bookstores, concept stores, and museums such as: Ch√¢teau de Montsoreau-Museum of Contemporary Art, Palais de Tokyo, Pompidou Center, Guggenheim Museum (Bilbao), Reina Sofia Museum. The magazine has published background articles on: Andres Serrano, Aziz + Cucher, Bill Viola, Lee Ufan, Anish Kapoor, Nils Udo, Subodh Gupta. In 2006, the magazine ArtPremium organizes and produces in Puerto Rico, the first retrospective of Jean-Michel Basquiat. This exhibition takes place at the Mus√©o de arte de Puerto Rico in order to pay a national tribute to Jean-Michel Basquiat (born in New York), who was of Puerto Rican origins by his mother. Lourdes I Ramos-Rivas (named in 2016 president of the Museum of Latin American Art in Long Beach), as chief curator of the museum, is also the curator of this retrospective which brings together more than 135 original works by JMB, and contributes to the book: Jean-Michel Basquiat, an anthology for Puerto Rico, also produced by ArtPremium. In 2009, the entire spring issue is dedicated to Kiro Urdin to celebrate the long term achievements in his international career. During an interview, and to the question of what he thought to be so exposed, Urdin will say: \\"It doesn't happen frequently to the artists, but it is good when an important magazine is dedicated to one artist\\".  Website artpremium.com  Between 2011 and 2015, ArtPremium abandons its paper version to focus on its digital development, the magazine becomes completely free and readable online. The results having been inconclusive, the paper version of the magazine returns in 2016 with a new English-language version. The ArtPremium website is now an extension of the paper review, it includes uploads of unpublished articles and a layout adapted to digital reading.

The gene is also known as \\"chromosome 10 open reading frame 18\\" (c10orf18). FAM208B is expressed throughout the body however its function has not been established. FAM208b has been observed to be differentially regulated in various cancers and throughout development. While the exact role of the protein is yet to be established, the significant presence of the protein within humans and throughout the phylogenetic tree depicts a central importance of the gene in normal function. Gene The gene is located on chromosome 10 at position 10p15.1. FAM208b is upstream of ankryn repeat and SOCS box containing 13 (ASB13), and downstream of the GDP dissociation inhibitor 2 (GDI2) and nuclear receptor binding factor 2 pseudogene 5 (NRBF2P5). ASBI13 and GDI2 are both found on the opposite strand of FAM208b, while NRBF2P5 is on the same strand. The gene neighborhood of FAM208b. GDI2 is upstream on the same strand, while NRBF2P5 is upstream on the reverse strand. ASB13 is directly downstream on the reverse strand. Homology and Evolution =Paralog= FAM208b has a single paralog, FAM208a. FAM208a is also known as \\"retinoblastoma-associated protein 140\\", \\"Transgene Activation Suppression Protein\\" (TASOR), \\"CTCL Tumor Antigen\\", and \\"chromosome 3 open reading frame 63\\" (c3orf63). =Orthologs= FAM208b is conserved only in vertebrates. Orthologs can be found in mammals, reptiles, and amphibians. Distant homologs, including orthologs of the paralog, FAM208a, are observed in bony fish and sharks. =Homologous Domains= FAM208b has highly conserved N- and C- termini and a less conserved central region. Three domains of unknown function (DUFs) are found within the protein, including one DUF 3699 and two DUF 3715. All three DUFs are conserved between species. DUF 3715 is found in the paralog of FAM208b. Alignment of FAM208b and its paralog FAM208a, highlighting identified domains of unknown function: DUF3699 in blue, DUF3715 of FAM208b in yellow, DUF3715 of FAM208a in red, and their overlap in orange. =Evolution= The change in amino acids over time of FAM208b indicates that it is a rapidly evolving gene. The presence of FAM208a but not FAM208b in bony fish and sharks but not FAM208b, indicates that the paralogs split about 325 million years ago. Relative divergence of FAM208b as compared to Fibrinogen, a rapidly evolving gene, and Cytochrome C, a slowly evolving gene. FAM208b is evolving very rapidly. This is represented as more changes in the amino acid sequence over time. Phylogenetic tree depicting predicted evolutionary relationships based on FAM208b sequence similarity from select mammals. Transcription =Promoter= Two promoter regions for FAM208b can be observed. The earlier promoter region is regulated by numerous transcription factors. The promoter contains binding sites for Ikaros2, Nuclear Factor Y, and at least three binding sites for Pleomorphic adenoma gene 1. The second promoter region is found within the first intron and encodes a slightly shorter mRNA. This promoter contains multiple binding sites for the FOXP1 transcription factor. =mRNA= The mRNA of the most common peptide (variant x2) is 8699 nucleotides long and includes 22 exons. Binding Proteins The 5' UTR is bound by the RNA binding proteins RBMX1, FUS, SFRS1, ACO1, and NONO. The 3' UTR is bound by EIF4B, A2BP1, and ZFP36. A single non-coding variant of FAM208b is transcribed. This sequence is partially complementary to the human gene PCNX1. =Transcript Variants= A total of 20 transcript variants of FAM208b, including one non-coding RNA have been observed. While multiple splice variants are present, 18 exons, composing for 7089 base pairs that code for 2331 amino acids, are present in all coding variants. This constitutes approximately 82.1% of the most common transcript variant (X2), and 95.6% of its polypeptide product. The most commonly skipped exon is Exon 12 (position ch10: 5735304-5735546). Multiple variants have alternative transcription start sites, indicative of an internal promoter sequence. List of all observed FAM208b transcript variants. Exons are thick boxes, introns are thin lines. The NCBI accession number for each variant is given on the right. Protein =Biochemistry= The primary isoform of FAM208b consists of 2430 amino acids. The total molecular weight is 268.86 kD. FAM208b has an isoelectric point of 5.72. FAM208b has an instability index of 53.64, making it a relatively unstable protein in the unphosphorylated form. =Primary Structure= FAM208b has a unique amino acid composition. An above- average proportion of serine residues are observed (11.1%). This indicates a potential role in intracellular signaling. Comparison of the amino acid composition of FAM208b and the total distribution of amino acids in all proteins. FAM208b has an above average composition of serine residues. =Secondary Structure= FAM208b is predicted to have multiple alpha-helical domains. It is predicted that 25% of the protein forms alpha-helices, 15% forms beta-strands, and 60% is random coil. The various DUF domains are predicted to have variable structure. DUF3699 consists of two helices and four beta-strands. The N-terminal DUF3715 appears to form a stretch of random coil, while the C-terminal DUF3715 has two helices and four beta-strands. Predicted structure of FAM208b's DUF3699 domain. Predicted structure of FAM208b's first DUF3715 domain. It appears to be entirely disordered. Predicted Structure of FAM208b's second DUF3715 domain. =Tertiary Structure= A tertiary structure has not yet been confirmed by X-ray crystallography. Predictions of tertiary structure indicate a modular protein, composed of three modules connected by random coil. 3D structure prediction of FAM208b. =Post-Translational Modifications= Phosphorylation FAM208b has 13 experimentally confirmed phosphorylation sites on serine residues. The high serine content of FAM208b suggests a role in intracellular signaling. SUMOylation FAM208b has potential for SUMOylation SUMOylation has been observed to play a role in nuclear transport, which would aid FAM208b's localization prediction. Glycosylation FAM208b is predicted to be an intracellular protein, indicating that it is not glycosylated. =SubCellular Location= FAM208b is predicted to be localized to the cytosol or nucleus. The peptide sequence lacks a signal sequence either at the N-terminus or internally. No transmembrane domains have been observed or predicted, indicating that FAM208b is not secreted or found in the cell membrane, and is very likely to be intracellular. A Nuclear Localization Signal is observed at amino acids 393-403. The NLS is highly conserved in mammals, birds, and reptiles. Multiple Sequence Alignment between various mammalian groups of the Nuclear Localization Signal of FAM208b, indicating that the protein is likely transported to the cell nucleus. Clinical Significance =Development= FAM208b expression is observed to decrease over the course of development. Peak expression is observed in the blastocyst. A sharp decline in expression is observed at the fetal stage, after which expression is maintained at constant levels through adulthood. =Pathology= FAM208b has been observed to be correlated in a variety of cancers. The locus of FAM208b (10p15.1) was identified as an aberration site present in translocation-positive Follicular lymphoma but not Nodal Marginal Zone Lymphoma. FAM208b has also been identified as being upregulated significantly and prominently in Non-Hodgkin lymphoma cells. FAM208b has been identified as a hub gene of Stage IV colorectal cancer. A fusion of FAM208b and PLEKHB1 has been validated as candidate for fusion of chromosomes 10 and 11 in Donor Cell Leukemia. FAM208b has also been separately observed to be differentially expressed in a variety of cancers. A decrease in transcription of FAM208b has been observed in adrenal cancer, bladder cancer, breast cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, glial cancer, kidney cancer, lymph cancer, skin cancer, muscle cancer, and uterine cancer. An increase in transcription of FAM208b has been observed in cervical cancer, leukemia, liver cancer, lung cancer, and prostate cancer. FAM208b has also been found to be expressed at higher levels in Acute Macular Degeneration. FAM208b has been observed to be downregulated in bronchial epithelial cells infected by respiratory syncytial virus and has been postulated as a biosignature of the infection.

Created in 1975, it allows an S-100 machine to produce its own display, and when paired with a keyboard and their 3P+S card, it eliminates the need for a separate video terminal. Using a 7 x 9 dot matrix and ASCII characters, it produces a 64-column by 16-row text display. The VDM-1 is a complex card and was soon replaced by an increasing number of similar products from other companies. An early competitor was the Solid State Music VB-1, which offers an identical display from a much simpler card. Later cards using LSI chips have enough room to include the keyboard controller as well. History =TV Typewriter= In September 1973, the cover article of Radio Electronics magazine was Don Lancaster's \\"Build a TV Typewriter\\", which allows users to type characters on a keyboard and have them appear on a conventional television. Given this limited functionality, they initially estimated that the magazine would sell about 20 copies of the plans for $20 each. Instead, they were flooded by requests and eventually sent out 10,000 copies. Bob Marsh built a TV Typewriter and showed it to Lee Felsenstein. Felsenstein noted that it had no external memory, so once a full page of text had been typed, the entire page had to be erased to display additional text. He phoned Lancaster and asked him about this design note, and Lancaster replied that he simply hadn't considered using it as the basis of a terminal, \\"I don't know ‚Äì people just want to put up characters on their TV screens\\". =Tom Swift Terminal= Throughout 1973, Felsenstein had been looking for a low-cost terminal for the Community Memory bulletin board system. He had designed the Pennywhistle modem to address the need for remote access at a price under $100, but the terminal that they hooked it up to still cost $1500. Felsenstein began designing a printed circuit board that would combine the video output of the TV Typewriter with 1024 bytes of memory so it could hold a page of text in ASCII format and send it to a video monitor. He called the resulting design \\"The Tom Swift Terminal\\", after the Tom Swift books. The design manual also had an extended section on the concept of \\"convivial design\\" (essentially \\"friendly\\")wiktionary:convivial, which argued that a device's social utility was inversely proportional to its complexity, and thus devices should be as simple and open-ended as possible. Felsenstein sold the design document to local hobbyists, and wrote an article on it in the People's Computer Company in early 1974. By 1975, the system had still not been assembled by anyone. =VDM-1= Processor Technology VDM-1 board Early January 1976 Byte advertisement for the VDM-1 In April 1975, Bob Marsh and Gary Ingram formed Processor Technology, initially to sell expansion cards for the Altair. Marsh approached Felsenstein with the idea of modifying the Tom Swift design to work with the Altair, which had been released that January. A key aspect of the resulting design was the use of electronic switches that allow the display and the computer to access different parts of the on-board memory at the same time, which means the display hardware does not have to stop the computer while it is drawing. The prototype was completed in less than three months. As soon as the prototype was ready, Steve Dompier began porting Star Trek to it, replacing its serial output with a more game-like display to produce Trek-80. The system went on sale soon after at a price of $199 for the kit version. As reviews of the era noted, an Altair compatible machine equipped with a keyboard, the VDM-1, and an appropriate monitor (from Radio Shack) cost less than a typical smart terminal of the era. =Sol-20= Les Solomon, whose Popular Electronics cover article had launched the Altair, was looking for someone to build an all-in-one machine that avoided the need for multiple cards from multiple vendors. He first approached Don Lancaster, who created the original TV Typewriter, and introduced him to Ed Roberts of MITS, the creator of the Altair. The two immediately began fighting and any idea of a partnership ended. As Solomon put it: In December 1975, Solomon approached Marsh, asking him if he could make this all-in-one \\"intelligent terminal\\" design. If he did it within 30 days, Solomon would put it on the cover of the magazine. Marsh again turned to Felsenstein to design it, and as soon as they began discussing it, it was clear the best solution was a complete computer system. This would basically be a low-end computer with the VDM as its output. Felsenstein initially wanted to use a different processor, but eventually concluded the Intel 8080 was the best solution. As Felsenstein worked on the design, Marsh continually added new required features, leading to a case of feature creep. The design was finally completed after two months. The result is the Sol-20, one of the earliest all-in-one computer designs. =VDM-2= Sometime later, Felsenstein returned to the design in order to make a new version that would have 24 lines of 80 columns, which was becoming a standard. The VDM-1 had 16 rows simply because 64 x 16 = 1,024, the amount of memory on the card. It also added a split-screen feature that allowed the upper and lower sections to be scrolled independently, and place the split at any line. It also added smooth scrolling, greyscale and flashing. By the summer of 1979, Felsenstein had a partially assembled version and took it to the Javits Convention Center in New York City to show it to the Processor Technology people. After looking for the booth for some time, he found that the company had closed. He could not find a buyer for the design. Description The VDM-1 uses a single slot in the S-100 backplane, but is so large it covers adjacent slots in most machines. The front side of the board was crammed with components, including eight 91L02A 128-byte static RAMs, to the point that there was not enough room left for the required electrical traces. This was solved by running a ribbon cable from one side of the board to the other.See image here. The monitor is connected via a coaxial cable running off the top corner of the card. The board generates 16 lines of 64 characters on a monitor or a conventional television that is slightly modified to bypass the radio frequency section. The display is black and white, and the hardware includes the ability to support inverse video, which they refer to as \\"cursor bytes\\", by setting the high bit on the character byte. With the appropriate switch set on the settings DIP switch, any such character will blink. This supplies the hardware cursor display by setting this bit on a space character. One oddity of the system is that the character graphics were supplied in ROM, and there are several versions of the ROMs with different glyphs. The user could not know in advance which version he would receive.

Osborn has served as an expert advisor on numerous urgent medical and health issues that include infectious diseases and their vaccines, virology, and public health policy as well as publishing research on these subjects. Osborn currently works on public health policy with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, The World Health Organization, The National Institutes of Health, and The Food and Drug Administration. Early life June E. Osborn was born in Endicott, New York on May 28, 1937 to Leslie Varmus and Dora Wrist. The family moved to Madison, Wisconsin in 1950 due to her father being offered a job position as the director of the state's mental hygiene department and professor of psychiatry at The University of Wisconsin. Shortly after moving Osborn's mother began a second career as a psychiatric social worker. Upon studying chemistry in Ohio at Oberlin College, Osborn decided that she did not want to be a physician, but rather that she wanted to go into teaching and researching as her profession. Education June E. Osborn began her studies at Oberlin College where she received her A.B. degree in 1957. Osborn continued her education in Cleveland at Case Western Reserve University. It was while she was here that she met and worked with Dr. Frederick C. Robbins, who shared the 1953 Nobel Prize in physiology, whom through his work inspired her to study virology. Dr. June E. Osborn received her M.D. from Case Western Reserve University in 1961. She then spent three years training at Boston Children‚Äôs and Massachusetts General Hospitals as a pediatric resident. After she was finished there she spent two years at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and also The University of Pittsburgh as a postdoctoral fellow in infectious diseases and virology. Career Osborn was on the faculty of The University of Wisconsin-Madison Medical School from 1966 to 1984 as a professor in the Medical Microbiology Department and also the Department of Pediatrics. She was appointed associate dean for biological sciences at The University of Wisconsin Graduate School in 1975. In 1984 Dr. Osborn was offered a position as the dean of The School of Public Health at The University of Michigan so she decided to leave Wisconsin. She later on became the dean and professor of epidemiology, pediatrics, and also communicable diseases at The School of Public Health in Michigan. While serving as dean June E. Osborn set up a post-doctoral program for minority scholars to assist them in preparing for growth and success in faculty positions. Osborn remained serving as the dean until 1993. She was elected to membership in The Institute of Medicine in 1986 and from 1995 through 2000 she was a member of its governing council. Later on in 1994 she was elected to fellowship in The American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Osborn went on to be the sixth president of the Josiah Macy, Jr. Foundation in New York in 1996. Osborn has achieved international recognition for her events during the AIDS epidemic. Throughout the 1980s and 90s Osborn had several senior positions that include The Lung and Blood Institute Advisory Committee on AIDS, The National Institutes of Health, The National Advisory Committee for The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's AIDS Health Services Project, and The United States National Commission on AIDS. Osborn was an active member of The Global Commission on AIDS of the World Health Organization. Throughout the height of the AIDS epidemic in the 80s and 90s Osborn gave many speeches on and wrote many articles about AIDS, HIV, and the public health and policy issues that accompanied them. Dr. June E. Osborn, M.D., retired from active faculty status of professor of epidemiology in the School of Public Health and professor of pediatrics and communicable diseases on September 30, 1996. Dr. June E. Osborn is currently in New York serving as a member of The Boards of the Corporation for Supportive Housing, The Center for Health Care Strategies in New Jersey, and the Legal Action Center.

The name of the party was chosen a reference to the phrase \\"Moi pr√©sident de la R√©publique...\\", repeated by Fran√ßois Hollande against Nicolas Sarkozy in the debate between the two rounds of the 2012 presidential election. The party aims to elect figures from civil society and with business experience in place of the professional political class, supporting liberal and social liberal policies and presenting an \\"alternative offer to the FN\\" (Front National). It claims to go beyond the left-right divide with a program created through \\"participatory democracy\\" supportive of globalization and critical of the French labor code. In the 2014 municipal elections, Nous Citoyens offered its support to any candidates committed to \\"good governance, transparency, and the non-accumulation of mandates\\", and won a total of 58 seats across 18 communes. In the subsequent European elections, the party solicited applications from its members to join its electoral lists, hoping to be present in all 8 European Parliament constituencies in France. Nous Citoyens ultimately presented lists in 7 constituencies, winning 1.41% of the vote nationally. On 8 September 2013, Payre was replaced as president of Nous Citoyens by centrist Member of the European Parliament Jean-Marie Cavada, who consequently stepped down as vice-president of the New Centre and Union of Democrats and Independents. Payre, wishing to focus on social entrepreneurship projects over his political commitments, became vice-president of the party, which claimed 12,000 members at the time of Cavada's accession. Cavada quit the party on 29 June 2015 over the lack of internal democracy, forcing Payre to return to the presidency of Nous Citoyens, and on 17 July, Cavada founded the movement G√©n√©ration Citoyens with several dissidents of his former party. On 25 January 2016, Nicolas Doucerain was elected to succeed Payre with 59.5% of votes in the first round, with a turnout of about 1,800 votes out of 4,700 activists up-to-date on membership fees.

Such initiatives are often temporary, informal and citizen-led as well as taking place in unused, if not abandoned, urban spaces.  Definitions  Austerity urbanism can be described in several ways and gathers different components. The following lines present the main definitions and interpretations of the concept. First, austerity urbanism is based upon two main notions : austerity and urbanism. Generally speaking, austerity is ‚Äúa situation in which people‚Äôs living standards are reduced because of economic difficulties‚Äù. Austerity is also described as ‚Äúa condition of enforced or extreme economy‚Äù . Here, austerity refers to the reduction of investment, as well as expenditure in general, by the state due to an economy in jeopardy. Recent episodes of austerity are often linked with neoliberalism, which is the latest form of capitalism. Its main idea is to restrict the power of public institutions as well as government spending and to give precedence to the market economy, in order to increase the role of the private sector in the society as well as maintain public sectors in good financial health. Given that the private sector is in charge in the neoliberal system, public expenditures are less likely to occur. This is what leading to austerity in bad economic times. Second, austerity urbanism is a type of urbanism that shows the repercussions of austerity. The critical situation of the economy has a significant effect on the development of cities. Investors, due to economic crisis and lack of attractive investment options, reduce the amount of money they invest in cities, leaving neighborhoods or entire cities worse off. In other words, an episode of austerity may leave municipalities with no alternative about the lack of investment of private actors, and create difficulties to manage the development of their cities. Moreover, the possibility for actors from the private sector to withdraw at any moment puts municipalities in a position where they may not have the means to manage their urban development themselves. Finally, austerity urbanism happens when the private sector reduces its investment. Due to the lack of funds of the municipalities, neighborhoods are at risk of not receiving proper investment. At that point, individuals or local associations may take control and launch their own urban initiatives in places neglected by municipalities. This process often leads to attracting, once again, the private sector after those places have been reshaped for temporary use by the local community. In the meantime, the actions of local communities work as transitional uses before future developments.  Origins  To understand the emergence of austerity urbanism, it is necessary to explore first the notion of austerity and its impacts throughout history as austerity urbanism appears later as a consequence of such a context. The notion of austerity is not new in the history of humankind, but as an explicit concept, it did not start to be until the beginning of the 20th century. The economist John Maynard Keynes was amongst the first ones to use it. In the wake of World War I, he made known his disagreement on the Treaty of Versailles, opining that it was not a good idea to impose an economy of austerity on Germany. He argued that it would also weaken other countries in Europe. The risk was also that the impoverishment of Germany could raise fierce opposition to the treaty in Germany and maybe even a revolution. At that time, Keynes supported a more interventionist economic policy and was therefore against a deliberate austerity build up. In the 1930s, the notion of austerity reappeared with the Great Depression and its consequences, Europe as a whole being in a situation of austerity. This crisis framework appeared again after the Second World War, plunging several European countries into a state of misery, which can be qualified as austerity. At this moment, it was clear that the continent needed to rebuild its devastated lands and cities. This state of austerity gradually faded away during \\"The Glorious Thirty\\" but resurfaced quickly in the 1980s with the general awareness of ecological limits and key resource depletion which suggested the rethinking of the socio-economic system. Then, with the subprime crisis in 2007-2008, the notion of austerity came back strongly and explicitly especially in the economic and urban realm. Indeed, the changing economic conditions led to the emergence of the concept of austerity urbanism. In austerity urbanism, cities have to take care of themselves since ‚Äúmunicipal governments act as cost-saving business actors that envisage running cities like corporations‚Äù. Even if the situation is not uniform across cities, nor completely comparable, the manifestation of austerity became ‚Äúevident at the urban scale‚Äù. Nowadays, there are several ideological undercurrents involved in the austerity narrative. On the one hand, the ‚Äúeconomy of means‚Äù current suggests that one must stop living beyond one's means. In order to reduce the negative consequences of austerity urbanism, such as the rise of youth unemployment as well as poverty, social exclusion and the increasing debt prevailing in most Western economies for example, it is considered necessary to be cautious regarding public expenses. However, this can result in the mistrust in the institutions and this increasing dissatisfaction leads to the weakening of the aforesaid institutions. On the other hand, when austerity reaches its limits, it can also open up new opportunities and therefore generate great possibilities in the urbanistic field, such as citizen-led initiatives taking place in unusual spaces or forms, in an attempt from the population to counteract the crisis situation and austerity measures. To sum up, there is therefore a crisis-linked austerity situation in opposition to an ideological vision of prudence, which tend to maintain a pressure for unnecessary cost-avoidance. Between these two perspectives, it may be quite difficult to carry out urban planning assignments, as it necessarily implies investments at a time when funds are seemingly lacking. This is the global context in which the notion of austerity urbanism emerged, whose definition was proposed in 2012 by various authors, including Fran Tonkiss and Jamie Peck. The notion of austerity in urban planning is evolving, not being always a negative assertion, but also valuing the opportunities and innovative solutions that are created within the practice of urban planning. The notion of austerity urbanism is in fact more and more linked to that of tactical urbanism and improvisational urbanism, emphasizing in particular the growing importance of citizen solidarity. These connotations complement what has to be considered, altogether, as a progressive vision of urbanism where the game is to take advantage of a crisis to allow for new collective achievements to emerge.  Practical interventions under conditions of austerity  Planning under austerity can lead to alternative and critical spatial practices, that are described by Kevin Lynch as a strategy for ‚Äúdealing with the existing city [in] the search for underused space and time, and its readaptation for a desired activity. We can explore the use of streets as play areas, or the possibilities for using roof tops, empty stores, abandoned buildings, waste lots, odd bits of land, or the large areas presently sterilized by such mono- cultures as parking lots, expressways, railroad yards, and airports‚Äù. These makeshift, informal and often temporary urban interventions were categorized by Fran Tonkiss in four protocols for planning under austerity, depending on the degree of facilitation by existing policies: # The ‚ÄúPositive model‚Äù provides the best conditions for the development of such self-organized interventions as it integrates their informal nature into formal processes, by offering building permits for instance. # The ‚ÄúPermissive model‚Äù neither facilitates, nor excludes unconventional planning strategies, being based on a tolerant approach regarding them. # The ‚ÄúProscription model‚Äù on the other hand leaves almost no space for negotiation and improvisation initiatives by criminalizing or implementing punitive measures against them. # The ‚ÄúAbandonment model‚Äù positions these interventions as an urbanism of last resort, in response to the complete roll back of the state in terms of territorial governance. Prinzessinneng√§rten, Berlin Kreuzberg In reality, these four approaches are often combined, as the case of squatting in some British cities that is a mix of the third and the fourth model. Indeed, in 2012, residential squatting was criminalized in England, and at the same time, budget cutback made it difficult to positively promote alternative practices, despite the ambitions of the Big Society political ideology. This situation was paradoxical considering that at that time the number of empty houses in the country well exceeded the number of squatters in the UK. On a more micro- scale level, interstitial urbanism such as community gardening is another form of alternative urban interventions, open to improvisation and adaptation. Such initiatives can take place on brownfields, waste ground like the in Berlin or even in-between two buildings, as it is the case with the self-managed space on the rue Saint-Blaise 56 in Paris. In a context of austerity, these sites represent an important testing ground for urban experimentation as well as providing local services and spaces to counteract the lack of public policy. = The case of Todmorden, England = Urban vegetable gardens along the Rochdale canal, Todmorden Todmorden is a northern English town that engaged in austerity urbanism following the deindustrialization. Between the 1970s and 2010, the city lost about half of its population, mostly being workers that became unemployed. In response to the crisis, citizens had the idea of producing food in public spaces, cultivating vegetables in urban gardens located in every unused space around the city like next to the train station, the main road or even the police station. Todmorden is in fact the first city in the world to have launched, in 2008, a food self-sufficiency initiative, called the Incredible Edible. Nowadays, the project is still successfully going and contributes to strengthening social bonds and solidarity among the population.  Criticism  Temporary urbanism can involve risks. Indeed, temporary and self-organized projects could also be used to keep unused lands attractive while the economy is in crisis and therefore facilitating the state withdrawal from its responsibilities. As Margit Mayer pointed out, ‚Äúprinciples such as self-management, self-realization and all kinds of unconventional or insurgent creativity (‚Ä¶) have lost the radical edge they used to entail in the context of the overbearing Keynesian welfare state - in today‚Äôs neoliberal urbanism they have been usurped as essential ingredients of sub-local regeneration programs‚Äù. The concept itself of austerity urbanism is the subject of different critical points of views. From a free-market perspective, austerity is a necessary, if temporary, measure to assure the financial health of the public sector where it has been spending too much and faces a large amount of debt and deficit. This perspective relates to the orthodox neoclassical economic theory which argues, against a Keynesian ideology, that public investments are bad for the economy in a long term. For the free-market advocates, austerity is a way to purge non-efficient institutions and enterprises and let new technologies and strategies emerge in a Schumpeterian creative destruction perspective. Translated to urban planning theories, austerity means that it is beneficial for the economy to cut public investments in urban development and let private initiatives and the private sector run cities. Entrepreneurial urbanism argues that the public sector should function more like the private sector and seek to make returns on investment on public spending and be competitive to decrease the distortions of public intervention in the market. On the other hand, heterodox economy, radical geography, other fields of research, and left wing or Marxists political parties see austerity as a punitive and non-justified policy related to a pejorative perception of neoliberalism. Increasing inequalities, gaps in the rights to the city, and social injustice, austerity urbanism leads to what David Harvey describes as ‚Äúaccumulation by dispossession‚Äù. In this point of view, austerity should be stopped and new social strategies of urban development should be organized to fight the commodification and financialization of cities.

ADCIRC utilizes the finite element method in either three-dimensional or two- dimensional depth-integrated form on a triangular unstructured grid with Cartesian or spherical coordinates. It can run in either barotropic or baroclinic modes, allowing inclusion of changes in water density and properties such as salinity and temperature. ADCIRC can be run either in serial mode (e.g. on a personal computer) or in parallel on supercomputers via MPI. The model has been optimized to be highly parallelized, in order to facilitate rapid computation of large, complex problems. ADCIRC is able to apply several different bottom friction formulations including Manning's n-based bottom drag due to changes in land coverage (such as forests, cities, and seafloor composition), as well as utilize atmospheric forcing data (wind stress and atmospheric pressure) from several sources, and further reduce the strength of the wind forcing due to surface roughness effects. The model is also able to incorporate effects such as time-varying topography and bathymetry, boundary fluxes from rivers or other sources, tidal potential, and sub-grid scale features like levees. ADCIRC is frequently coupled to a wind wave model such as STWAVE, SWAN, or WAVEWATCH III, especially in storm surge applications where wave radiation stress can have important effects on ocean circulation and vice versa. In these applications, the model is able to take advantage of tight coupling with wave models to increase calculation accuracy.

He died in combat during the Battle of Iwo Jima.  Biography  Senda was a native of Kagoshima Prefecture, and was born to the Takayama family, and was later adopted by the Senda family, whose surname he took. A graduate of the 26th class of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in 1914, one of his classmates was General Tadamichi Kuribayashi. He was promoted to major in 1924. Assigned to the IJA 11th Division, he as in combat in the disastrous Battle of Lake Khasan against the Red Army in 1938. He was promoted to colonel in 1939, but was reassigned as chief of the discipline section in the Sendai Army Youth School. On 29 May 1940, he became commanding officer of the 44th Infantry Regiment of the Japanese Imperial Army. He later became commandant of the Sendai Army Youth School on 5 February 1943, a post he maintained until 27 November 1944. In Autumn 1944, general Tadamichi Kuribayashi, in charge of the defense of the island of Iwo Jima, replaced many local officers with others whom he judged more competent. Imperial General Headquarters promoted Senda to major general and sent assigned him to Iwo Jima, after general Kuribayashi requested \\"the best infantry leader\\" available. The choice was puzzling, as Senda had never attended the Army War College, a prerequisite for higher ranking officers, and his combat experience was very limited. Nevertheless, Senda took office at the 2nd Mixed Brigade as its commanding officer on 16 December 1944. Senda built his headquarters in a cave in Mount Tamana, near Motoyama Airfield. He also organized his men in to \\"special assault squadrons\\" who were assigned suicide missions to rush enemy tanks with explosives. The 2nd Mixed Brigade more the brunt of the attack by the IUSMC 4th Division for six days, from March 2 to March 8, in which it became completely encircled. As the US Marines resorted to flamethrowers to burn Senda's men in place, Kuribayashi refused Senda's repeated requests to be allowed to lead his men on a final Banzai charge attack. Instead, Kuribayashi ordered Senda to retreat with his remaining forces to the Japanese headquarters. Senda attempted a breakout with 427 men, but were pinned down on a beach and were annihilated, with only two men reaching Kuribayashi's lines. Some of Senda's men refused the order to surrender, and remained behind at Mount Tamana to continue guerrilla-style attacks on the American forces. Approximately half of the American forces killed in action during the battle died in Senda's sector. Senda was posthumously promoted to Lieutenant General and awarded the Order of the Golden Kite. 4th class.

Life  He was born in the family of the Cossack Vasily Velychko in the village of Zhuky of the first hundred Poltava regiment. His father was able to write, was a man of wisdom and respected and had a large library. Successfully passed entrance exams to the Kyiv-Mohyla Collegium, which at that time was one of the most reputable educational institutions in Europe. Successfully graduated from college before 1690. From this year he took office as the clerk of the General Military Chancellery, headed by Vasyl Kochubey. Velichko also fulfilled the special orders of Vasyl Kochubey, \\"the most necessary and secret at that time military affairs,\\" even those who went to the Russian tsar, and the cipher (encrypted) letters to the owners of Volosky and Muntyansky. Via Velychko there was correspondence, which Ivan Mazepa did not know. In this status, he has served 15 years.  Writings   Honoring Memory  Unfortunately, the grave of Samiilo Velychko has not survived to this day. And in the center of the village Zhuky, on the top, near the chapel of the Protection of the Most Holy Theotokos and the mound of memory, a granite boulder was set up, which symbolizes the last shelter of the famous historian of the Cossack. Today, in the village where Samiilo Velychko was born, lived and worked, the memorial complex of the glory of the Ukrainian Cossacks was erected. In 2010, the first complex of memory of the dead Cossacks was opened. In 2003, in order to honor the memory of the glorious Cossack chronicler, the son of Poltava region, and the presentation of the best examples of national culture in the context of the creativity of one of its founders, the regional literary award named after Samiil Wielicz was initiated.

She researched marine coastal ecosystems (in particular seagrass, seaweed, and coral reef habitats) and how they are affected by human activities. She was a strong advocate for environmental protection, credited with helping pass legislation expanding the boundaries of Northern California's Gulf of the Farallones and Cordell Bank national sanctuaries, increasing the area of federally-protected coastal waters. Early life and education Williams attended the University of Michigan, where she earned a bachelor's of science degree in biology in 1972. She then earned a master's degree in biological oceanography from the University of Alaska in 1977 and a doctoral degree in botany and marine biology from the University of Maryland in 1981. Career Williams served as science director of the United States National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration's National Undersea Research Program in the Virgin Islands before becoming a professor of biology at San Diego State University, where she directed the University's Coastal and Marine Institute. Williams joined the faculty of the University of California, Davis in 2000 and served as director of the University's Bodega Marine Laboratory between 2000 and 2010. She returned to teaching full-time in 2010 and remained on the UC Davis faculty until her death from a traffic collision in Petaluma, California on April 24, 2018. She taught and mentored both undergraduate and graduate students, including teaching a course called \\"Life in the Sea\\" which she developed to help get non science-majors inspired to help protect marine environments. Williams diving off the Spermonde islands in Indonesia Williams served as president of the Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation from 2009 to 2011. Williams worked closely with Indonesian researchers throughout her career: in 2015, she co- authored a study that looked at the effects of human pollution on fish for sale in California and Indonesia. They found that a quarter of the fish from the California Bay Area they tested and an even greater proportion of the fish from Indonesian fish markets contained plastic debris or synthetic fibers. This was one of the first times plastic debris were reported in fish sold directly for human consumption. Another study Williams performed in collaboration with Indonesian scientists looked into ways to restore seagrass beds, endangered habitats that are important for, among other things, supporting fisheries and protecting coastlines. Working in Indonesia's Coral Triangle, a biodiversity hotspot made up of seagrass, coral reefs, and mangrove forests, Williams and her colleagues showed that restoration efforts were more effective when they planted multiple species of seagrass instead of just a single species. These findings can help direct seagrass restoration efforts around the world. In October 2017 and February 2018, Williams returned to Indonesia through the Fulbright Specialist Program; there she worked with faculty and students at Hasanuddin University to establish and expand upon existing infrastructure to protect Indonesia's coastal ecosystems. Advocacy and community outreach Outreach in the Spermonde Islands Williams encouraged scientists to engage meaningfully with the general public as well as with politicians. Her connection with political activism began early in her scientific career; in 1993, she was appointed to a panel of scientists consulting with the assistant secretary of the Interior, and in 2000 she received an Aldo Leopold Fellowship in Environmental Leadership. This activism continued to the end; mere weeks before her death she co-wrote an article commemorating the one-year anniversary of 2017's March for Science in which she urged scientists to become more engaged with the public and politicians. In 2007, she testified before United States Congressional committees about how the Point Arena upwelling center off California's coast provides nutrients to help downstream marine productivity - this is credited with helping pass legislation in June 2015 extending the northern boundary of California's Greater Farallones National Marine Sanctuary in order to better protect the coastal environment. Williams also used her scientific work to speak out about the dangers of climate change; in 2010, she helped raise the alarm that even small increases in ocean temperature could rapidly accelerate the growth of invasive species in marine environments. Williams was remembered by colleagues as an effective mentor and strong advocate for women scientists.

Since 1990 she has written for the mass-circulation weekly newspaper, Die Zeit. More recently she has come to wider prominence through her television work.  Biography  Iris Radisch was born in West Berlin (as it was known at that time). She attended university at Frankfurt and T√ºbingen, studying Germanistics, Romance studies and Philosophy. She then moved into journalism, working as a literary editor with the Frankfurter Rundschau, a mass-market daily newspaper. Her switch to Die Zeit came in 1990. As a regular contributor to the paper's Feuilleton (arts and literature) section she gained a reputation as a perceptive, original, but sometimes also starkly polemical literature critic, able to deliver her judgments with a rare level of authority. She was able to combine her journalism with guest professorships, notably at St. Louis and at G√∂ttingen. She also began to appear as a television moderator in discussion programmes transmitted by ZDF, ARD, WDR and the private-sector broadcaster VOX. Her public profile rose after August 2000 when she began her involvement with \\"Das Literarische Quartett\\" (\\"The Literary Quartet\\"), a weekly television programme produced by West Germany's ZDF broadcasting operator in collaboration (at that time) with Austria's ORF. The programme presented book reviews provided (and argued over) by a permanent panel of four literary critics. Radisch took the place vacated through the well publicised resignation from the programme of Sigrid L√∂ffler. She remained a panel member till December 2001 when (temporarily, as it later turned out) the series came to an end. She also participated in a number of subsequent \\"one-off\\" episodes transmitted during 2005 and 2006 to celebrate anniversaries of Friedrich Schiller, Thomas Mann, Heinrich Heine und Bertolt Brecht. During 2002/2003 she teamed up with the philosopher-journalist Gert Scobel, the longstanding moderator of the television arts magazine Kulturzeit, as an alternate presenter of the literary radio programme \\"B√ºcher, B√ºcher\\" from Hessischer Rundfunk. From August 2006 till September 2012 she \\"fronted\\" Swiss Television's Literturclub show in succession to Roger Willemsen. Between 1995 and 2000 Radisch served on the jury for the Ingeborg Bachmann Prize, a literary prize centred on German language literature and awarded each year, since 1977, in Klagenfurt. She returned to the prize jury a few years later, chairing it between 2003 and 2007. In 2007 Iris Radisch published her first book, \\"Die Schule der Frauen\\" (loosely \\"The women's school\\"). It was not the first time the title had been used, but Radisch's book covers and builds on more contemporary and pressing themes than the similarly titled works of Moli√®re and Gide. \\"I have three children and one professional job and I am not a believer in simple solutions\\" (\\"\\"Ich habe drei Kinder und einen Beruf und ich glaube nicht an einfache L√∂sungen\\"). The author illuminates her own experience of sustaining a professional career with her \\"career\\" as a mother of three small children by two different men. She \\"exposes modern myths\\" about the compatibility of family and profession. She discusses the semi-detached contributions of fathers. Since April 2013, jointly with Adam Soboczynski, she has headed up Die Zeit's Feuilleton section.  Celebration  In 2008 the German Language Society (\\"Gesellschaft f√ºr deutsche Sprache\\" / GfdS) awarded her the Media Prize for Speech culture (press) for her work on Die Zeit.

In the first phase of the Mexican War of Independence, revolutionary leaders Miguel Hidalgo, Ignacio Allende, Jos√© Mariano Jim√©nez, and Juan Aldama, plus nearly 900 men in the rebel army were captured here on March 21, 1811 by 150 soldiers commanded by Ignacio Elizondo. Elizondo pretended to be a supporter of the struggle to overthrow Spanish rule, lured the rebels into a trap, and captured them with little resistance. The four leaders and many of their followers were tried and executed. Background Ignacio Allende. Jos√© Mariano Jim√©nez. In 1810 Mexico was ruled by Spain and called New Spain. On September 16, Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, a Roman Catholic priest, triggered the Mexican War of Independence with his speech, called in Mexico the \\"grito.\\" Among Padre Hidalgo's followers were Ignacio Allende and Juan Aldama, both captains in the Spanish army. A citizen's army, numerous but poorly equipped and trained, quickly formed around these leaders. On September 22, 1810, Hidalgo, who had no military experience, was named by his followers as captain general of the revolutionary army. Allende was second in command with the rank of lieutenant general. The rebel army under Hidalgo enjoyed early successes but was decisively defeated by the royalist army supporting Spanish rule on January 17, 1811 in the Battle of Calder√≥n Bridge near Guadalajara. Along with the remnants of the rebel army, Allende, Aldama and Hidalgo, and others fled northward with the goal of getting to the United States and hoping that they would receive military and financial support from the U.S. The military leaders blamed Hidalgo for the loss at Calderon Bridge, forced him to resign his command, and threatened to execute him if he resisted.

The principal route to the U.S. was through Monclova and the best source of water en route to Monclova was the Wells of Baj√°n.Harris III, p. 129 The royalist sympathizers in Monclova sent two prominent citizens as spies to Saltillo to ascertain the plans of the rebels. The spies won the confidence of Allende and the other leaders and volunteered to guide the rebels to Texas. They told Allende that Elizondo would meet them the Wells of Baj√°n and escort them to Monclova. In Monclova, the royalists seized key points in the city, capturing the inebriated Aranda, the rebel commander in the city, and blocking all roads out of Monclova to prevent the news that they had taken control from reaching Allende and Hidalgo. Elizondo, his adherence to the royalists unsuspected by the rebels, was sent with 150 men to the Wells of Bajan to capture the rebel leaders.Almaraz, Jr. pp. 454-455 Capture Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla On March 17, 1811, Generals Allende, Jim√©nez, and Aldama, Padre Hidalgo, and more than 1,000 soldiers of the rebel army departed Saltillo to march north to Monclova. The caravan was strung out on the road over a distance of . An advance guard led the convoy, followed by more than 20 horse-drawn carriages transporting the rebel leaders. Following the carriages was a mule train with loads of supplies and silver bullion. Next came caissons of artillery, cumbersome ox-drawn carts carrying munitions, and, finally, the bulk of the soldiers and a rearguard. On the evening of March 20, the rebels camped from the Wells of Baj√°n.Vargas Garza, Jos√© Jes√∫s, \\"La Apprehension de Hidalgo en Acatita, , accessed 15 Jan 2019Almaraz, Jr., p, 455 At dawn on March 21 a courier arrived with a letter for Jim√©nez ensuring the unsuspecting rebel general that Elizondo and his soldiers were waiting for them at the Wells of Baj√°n and would welcome the arrival of the rebel army. The courier suggested to Jimenez that, due to shortages of water, the convoy arrive at Baj√°n in stages to allow time for the wells to recharge after each draw down of water. He also suggested that the leaders arrive first so that they could continue rapidly on toward Monclova. Jimenez accepted the suggestion and the convoy set out that morning toward Baj√°n without scouts or outriders and arrived at the Wells of Baj√°n piecemeal.Harris III, pp 133-134 Elizondo greeted the rebel leaders with an honor guard. He led the carriages behind a nearby hill not visible from the remainder of the rebel convoy. There, his men demanded the surrender of the rebel leaders. Padre Hidalgo, on horseback, drew a pistol but was restrained from firing by a royalist soldier. Allende and Jimenez were in the fifth carriage, and Allende opened fire. In the return fire Allende's son and several rebel soldiers were killed. The royalists tied the hands of the rebel leaders and their escorts and escorted them to a makeshift prison camp. This process of capturing elements of the rebel army continued all day long. As each new element arrived they were taken captive by Elizondo's men. By the end of the day the royalists had 893 prisoners and had killed about 40 of the royalists who resisted. The rear guard was the only contingent in the rebel army which sensed the danger and escaped capture.Almaraz, Jr., pp 455-456\\"La Guerra de Independencia.\\" The next day Elizondo divided the prisoners into three groups: the leaders of the rebels including Padre Hidalgo; captured rebel clergymen, and the common soldiers. All prisoners were taken to Monclova first and the lesser offenders remained there for trial. Ten captured clergymen were taken to Durango and 27 military leaders and Hidalgo were taken to Chihuahua for trial.Almaraz, pp. 456-457 Trial and executions Allende, Aldama, and Jim√©nez were tried and found guilty in May 1811 and executed by firing squads and decapitated on July 26, 1811, Another leader, Mariano Abasolo, escaped execution due to his public denouncement of the insurgent cause and the intervention of his wife, Mar√≠a Manuela Rojas Taboada, whose family had connections with aristocrats of the Viceroyalty of New Spain. He was instead sentenced to life in prison in the Santa Catalina Castle at C√°diz, Spain, where he died of pulmonary tuberculosis April 14, 1816. Hidalgo was tried by the Mexican Inquisition by the bishop of Durango, Francisco Gabriel de Olivares, for an official defrocking and excommunication on 27 July 1811. He was then tried by a military court that found him guilty of treason and he was executed on July 30, 1811. There are many theories about how he was executed, the most famous that he was killed by firing squad and then decapitated on July 30 at 7:00 in the morning. Before his execution, he thanked his jailers, two soldiers, Ortega and Melchor, for their humane treatment. At his execution, Hidalgo stated, \\"Though I may die, I shall be remembered forever; you all will soon be forgotten.\\" Hidalgo is often called the \\"Father of Mexican Independence\\" and September 16, the date of his \\"grito\\" is celebrated as Mexico's independence day.\\"Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla,\\" Encyclopedia Britannica, , accessed 16 Jan 2019 Aftermath Rafael Iriarte was the only senior rebel leader who escaped the encounter at the Wells of Baj√°n and he delivered the news to Hidalgo's secretary, Ignacio L√≥pez Ray√≥n, who had remained in Saltillo while the insurgent leaders marched north. Iriarte was subsequently executed according to the previous instructions left by Allende, based on suspicions such as having freed General Felix Maria Calleja's wife. On 26 March 1811, the insurgent army in Saltillo, numbering about 3,500 men with 22 cannons, fled southward. L√≥pez Ray√≥n would go on to meet with Jose Maria Morelos and other insurgent leaders to establish a prototypical governing body known as the Council of Zit√°cuaro to continue the struggle for independent against the vice-regal structure. The four heads of the executed insurgent leaders were hung from the corners of the Grain Exchange Alh√≥ndiga de Granaditas in Guanajuato, to discourage the independence movement. The heads remained hanging for ten years, until Mexico achieved its independence in 1821. Their bodies were then taken to Mexico City and eventually put to rest under el √Ångel de la Independencia in 1910. Of the more than 800 common soldiers and junior leaders captured several hundred were executed in Monclova; others were sentenced to work in mines and on haciendas scattered around Coahuila.Harris III, p. 136  References  Category:History of Coahuila Category:Mexican War of Independence Category:Conflicts in 1811 ","title":"Wells of Baj√°n"},{"id":"57254696","text":"Margaret Allan (1922 ‚Äì 27 June 2017) was an author of romance novels from Harrogate, North Yorkshire, England.

Originating as a small farming village in the 1850s, it is one of the city's oldest neighborhoods and retains a distinct character, with winding streets, irregular lots, and adobe vernacular buildings reminiscent of other old Hispanic communities in northern New Mexico. Name Historically, Martineztown and Santa Barbara were separate communities, though today they are generally considered to form a single neighborhood. with Martineztown is named for its founding settlers, the Mart√≠n family, possibly via an Anglicization of Los Martines. Prior to becoming known by its present name, the area was usually referred to as \\"Dog Town\\". Santa Barbara is named for the Santa Barbara Cemetery, which still exists as part of Mount Calvary Cemetery. Geography Santa Barbara- Martineztown is bounded by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue, the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad tracks, Menaul Boulevard, and Interstate 25. Interstate 40 runs through the northern part of the neighborhood on an elevated viaduct, intersecting I-25 at the Big I. Historically, the neighborhood's main axis was Edith Boulevard; Broadway Boulevard is the other major north-south route and separates the residential part of the neighborhood from the warehouse district adjacent to the railroad tracks. The main east- west arterials are Lomas Boulevard, Mountain Road, and Odelia Road. The northeastern part of the neighborhood includes two large cemeteries as well as Albuquerque High School, while several blocks in the southeast corner are occupied by Lovelace Medical Center. The neighborhood's terrain consists of rolling sandhills leading up to the East Mesa. Demographics As of the 2010 Census, Martineztown-Santa Barbara had a total population of 2,716 and 65% of the population was Hispanic or Latino. History Second United Presbyterian Church, built in 1922 In the 1700s, the sandhills that make up Martineztown were a common area used by residents of Old Town to graze their sheep. Separated from Old Town by marshlands, the area was accessible via the Old Carnuel Trail (now Mountain Road) and a section of the Camino Real de Tierra Adentro called El Camino del Lado (Side Road) which skirted the Rio Grande valley floor. This later became the old Bernalillo Road and then Edith Boulevard. A small agricultural community developed after Manuel Mart√≠n and his family moved to the area around 1850. Irrigation for farming was provided by the Acequia Madre de los Barelas, which also brought water to the downstream community of Barelas. The land was divided into narrow lots fronting on the acequia as in other farming communities in the region. The development of Martineztown accelerated after the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway reached Albuquerque in 1880, and much of the present neighborhood dates from this period. In the early 1900s, the adjacent community of Santa Barbara began to develop as well. The communities centered on Edith Boulevard, which was lined with stores, dance halls, and other small businesses. Area residents built a Presbyterian church, Second United Presbyterian Church, in 1889, and a Catholic church, San Ignacio Church, in 1916. Martineztown was annexed by the city of Albuquerque in 1898, followed by Santa Barbara in 1948. Starting in the 1940s, the neighborhood's physical condition began to deteriorate. City leaders viewed the low-income, mostly Hispanic area as blighted and believed the land could be better used as an extension of Downtown. Zoning regulations enacted in 1959 designated most of Martineztown for commercial and industrial use, eroding the neighborhood's low-density residential character and discouraging new home construction in favor of industrial and storage facilities. In 1971, neighborhood residents successfully organized to fight a large-scale urban renewal project that would have razed the southern end of the neighborhood to build a new campus for Albuquerque High School. Instead, the school was built on vacant land near Interstate 25. Still, tensions with the city government have continued to simmer. In 2018, neighborhood activists launched a new lawsuit against the city alleging discriminatory zoning regulations. Points of interest Martineztown-Santa Barbara has four properties which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places: *Old St. Joseph Hospital *San Ignacio Church *Santa Barbara School *Second United Presbyterian Church One other property, the F.M. Mercantile, is listed on the New Mexico State Register of Cultural Properties. Albuquerque High School Education Albuquerque Public Schools operates two schools in Martineztown-Santa Barbara: Longfellow Elementary School and Albuquerque High School. Longfellow serves students who live south of Interstate 40, while those to the north attend Cochiti Elementary. Older students in the neighborhood are assigned to Jefferson Middle School and Albuquerque High. Transportation ABQ Ride operates public transit in the neighborhood, including the 5 Montgomery-Carlisle, 6 Indian School Commuter, 8 Menaul, 11 Lomas, 12 Constitution Commuter, 16 Broadway-University-Gibson, 50 Airport-Downtown, and 92 Taylor Ranch Express city bus routes.
