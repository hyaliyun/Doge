It is a sequel to The Matrix, and the second installment in The Matrix film franchise. Reloaded premiered on May 7, 2003, in Westwood, Los Angeles, California, and had its worldwide release by Warner Bros. on May 15, 2003, including a screening out of competition at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival. The video game Enter the Matrix and The Animatrix, a collection of short animations, supported and expanded the storyline of the film. The film received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed $739.4 million worldwide, breaking Terminator 2: Judgment Day's record and becoming the highest-grossing R-rated film of all time until Deadpool surpassed it in 2016. The Matrix Revolutions, which continues the story, was released six months after Reloaded, in November 2003. Plot Six months after the events of The Matrix, Neo and Trinity are now romantically involved. Morpheus receives a message from Captain Niobe of the Logos calling an emergency meeting of all ships of Zion. Zion has confirmed the last transmission of the Osiris: an army of Sentinels is tunneling towards Zion and will reach it within 72 hours. Commander Lock orders all ships to return to Zion to prepare for the onslaught, but Morpheus asks one ship to remain to contact the Oracle. As the Caduceus receives a message from the Oracle, one of the Caduceus crew, Bane, encounters Smith, who reveals that his previous encounter with Neo severed his connection with the Matrix and has made him a rogue program, then absorbs his avatar. Smith then uses the phone line to leave the Matrix and gain control of Bane's real body. In Zion, Morpheus announces the news of the advancing machines to the people. In the Matrix, Neo meets the Oracle's bodyguard Seraph, who leads him to her. After realizing that the Oracle is part of the Matrix, Neo asks how he can trust her; she replies that this is his decision. The Oracle instructs Neo to reach the Source of the Matrix with the help of the Keymaker. As the Oracle departs, Smith appears, telling Neo that after being defeated, he refused to be deleted and is now a rogue program. He demonstrates his ability to clone himself using other inhabitants of the Matrix, including other Agents, as hosts. He then tries to absorb Neo but fails, prompting a battle between Smith's clones and Neo. Neo manages to defend himself, but is forced to retreat from the increasingly overwhelming numbers. Neo, Morpheus, and Trinity visit the Merovingian, who is imprisoning the Keymaker. The Merovingian, a rogue Matrix program with his own agenda, refuses to let him go. His wife Persephone, seeking revenge on her husband for his infidelity, leads the trio to the Keymaker. Morpheus, Trinity, and the Keymaker flee while Neo holds off the Merovingian's henchmen. Morpheus and Trinity try to escape with the Keymaker, pursued by several Agents and the Merovingian's chief henchmen, the Twins. After a long chase, Trinity escapes, Morpheus defeats the Twins, and Neo saves Morpheus and the Keymaker from Agent Johnson. The crews of the Nebuchadnezzar, Vigilant, and Logos help the Keymaker and Neo reach the Source. The Logos crew must destroy a power plant and the Vigilant crew must disable a back-up power station, to prevent a security system from being triggered, allowing Neo to open the door to the Source. Haunted by a vision of Trinity's death, Neo asks her to remain on the Nebuchadnezzar. The Logos succeeds, while the Vigilant is destroyed by a Sentinel, killing everyone on board. Trinity replaces the Vigilant crew and completes their mission. However, Agent Thompson corners her and they fight. As Neo, Morpheus, and the Keymaker try to reach the Source, the Smiths ambush them. The Keymaker unlocks the door to the Source, but the Smiths shoot him dead as he closes the door. Neo meets a program called the Architect, the creator of the Matrix. The Architect explains that Neo is himself a program and an intentional part of the Matrix, which is now in its sixth iteration. Neo is meant to stop the Matrix's fatal system crash that naturally recurs due to the concept of human choice within it. As with the five previous Ones, Neo has a choice: either return to the Source to reboot the Matrix and pick survivors to repopulate the soon-to-be-destroyed Zion, as his predecessors all did, or cause the Matrix to crash and kill everyone connected to it, which would mean humanity's extinction when Zion is destroyed. Neo learns of Trinity's situation and chooses to save her instead of returning to the Source, to which the Architect responds dismissively. Trinity is shot as she and Agent Thompson fall off a building. Before she hits the ground, Neo catches her. He then removes the bullet from her heart and revives her. They return to the real world, where Sentinels attack them. The Nebuchadnezzar is destroyed, but the crew escape. Neo displays a new ability to disable the machines with his thoughts, but falls into a coma from the effort. The crew are picked up by another ship, the Hammer. Its captain, Roland, reveals the other ships were wiped out by the machines after someone activated an EMP too early, and that they found only one survivor: the Smith- possessed Bane. Cast Zee was originally played by Aaliyah, who died in a plane crash on August 25, 2001, before filming was complete, requiring her scenes to be reshot with Nona Gaye. Production =Filming= The Matrix Reloaded was largely filmed at Fox Studios in Australia, filming began on March 1, 2001 and ended on August 21, 2002, concurrently with filming of the sequel, Revolutions. The freeway chase and \\"Burly Brawl\\" scenes were filmed at the decommissioned Naval Air Station Alameda in Alameda, California. The producers constructed a 1.5-mile freeway on the old runways specifically for the film. Some portions of the chase were also filmed in Oakland, California, and the tunnel shown briefly is the Webster Tube, which connects Oakland and Alameda. Some post-production editing was also done in old aircraft hangars on the base. The city of Akron, Ohio was willing to give full access to Route 59, the stretch of freeway known as the \\"Innerbelt\\", for filming of the freeway chase when it was under consideration. However, producers decided against this as \\"the time to reset all the cars in their start position would take too long\\". MythBusters would later reuse the Alameda location in order to explore the effects of a head-on collision between two semi trucks, and to perform various other experiments. Around 97% of the materials from the sets of the film were recycled after production was completed; for example, tons of wood were sent to Mexico to build low-income housing. =Visual effects= Following the success of the previous film, the Wachowskis came up with extremely difficult action sequences, such as the Burly Brawl, a scene in which Neo had to fight 100 Agent Smiths. To develop technologies for the film, Warner Bros. launched ESC Entertainment. The ESC team tried to figure out how to bring the Wachowskis' vision to the screen, but because bullet time required arrays of carefully aligned cameras and months of planning, even for a brief scene featuring two or three actors, a scene like the Burly Brawl seemed almost impossible as envisioned and could take years to composite. Eventually John Gaeta realized that the technology he and his crew had developed for The Matrixs bullet time was no longer sufficient and concluded they needed a virtual camera (in other words, a simulation of a camera). Having before used real photographs of buildings as texture for 3D models in The Matrix, the team started digitizing all data, such as scenes, characters' motions, or even the reflectivity of Neo's cassock. The reflectivity of objects needs to be captured and simulated adequately and Paul Debevec et al. captured the reflectance of the human face and Borshukov's work was strongly based on the findings of Debevec et al. They developed \\"Universal Capture\\", a process which samples and stores facial details and expressions at high resolution, then capture expressions from Reeves and Weaving using dense aka. markerless capture and multi-camera setup (similar to the bullet time rig) photogrammetric capture technique called optical flow. The algorithm for Universal Capture was written by George Borshukov, visual effects lead at ESC, who had also created the photo-realistic buildings for the visual effects in The Matrix. With this collected wealth of data and the right algorithms, they finally were able to create virtual cinematography in which characters, locations, and events can all be created digitally and viewed through virtual cameras, eliminating the restrictions of real cameras, years of compositing data, and replacing the use of still camera arrays or, in some scenes, cameras altogether. The ESC team rendered the final effects using the program mental ray. =Music= Don Davis, who composed for The Matrix, returned to score Reloaded. For many of the pivotal action sequences, such as the \\"Burly Brawl\\", he collaborated with Juno Reactor. Some of the collaborative cues by Davis and Juno Reactor are extensions of material by Juno Reactor; for example, a version of \\"Komit\\" featuring Davis' strings is used during a flying sequence, and \\"Burly Brawl\\" is essentially a combination of Davis' unused \\"Multiple Replication\\" and a piece similar to Juno Reactor's \\"Masters of the Universe\\". One of the collaborations, \\"Mona Lisa Overdrive\\", is titled in reference to the cyberpunk novel of the same name by William Gibson, a major influence on the directors. Leitmotifs established in The Matrix return ‚Äî such as the Matrix main theme, Neo and Trinity's love theme, the Sentinel's theme, Neo's flying theme, and a more frequent use of the four-note Agent Smith theme ‚Äî and others used in Revolutions are established. As with its predecessor, many tracks by external musicians are featured in the movie, its closing credits, and the soundtrack album, some of which were written for the film. Many of the musicians featured, for example Rob Zombie, Rage Against the Machine and Marilyn Manson, had also appeared on the soundtrack for The Matrix. Rob Dougan also re-contributed, licensing the instrumental version of \\"Furious Angels\\", as well as being commissioned to provide an original track, ultimately scoring the battle in the Merovingian's chateau. A remixed version of \\"Slap It\\" by electronic artist Fluke ‚Äî listed on the soundtrack as \\"Zion\\" ‚Äî was used during the rave scene. Linkin Park contributed their instrumental song \\"Session\\" to the film as well, although it did not appear during the course of the film. P.O.D. composed a song called \\"Sleeping Awake\\", with a music video which focused heavily on Neo, as well as many images that were part of the film. Both songs played during the film's credits. It was originally planned for the electronic band R√∂yksopp to create the soundtrack, but this offer was turned down.\\"Kafka feat. R√∂yksopp at the Bergen International Festival \\". Bergen International Festival. 2015 Reception =Box office= The film earned an estimated $5 million during Wednesday night previews in the United States and Canada. Reloaded grossed $37.5 million on its Thursday opening day from 3,603 theaters, which was the second highest opening day after Spider-Mans $39.4 million and highest for a Thursday. The film earned $91.7 million in the United States and Canada in its first weekend from 3,603 theaters and $134.3 million in its first 4 days, including the previews. Internationally, it opened in 13 territories, including Australia and France, and grossed $37.5 million in its first week. It expanded to most international territories (62) the following weekend, except Japan and India, and became the first movie to earn more than $100 million outside the U.S. in one weekend, taking its overseas total to $176 million and worldwide total to $385 million. It ultimately grossed $281.6 million in the US, and $739.4 million worldwide. The film sold an estimated 46,695,900 tickets in North America. =Critical response= On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 73% based on 245 reviews, with a weighted average score of 6.81/10. The site's critical consensus states: \\"Though its heady themes are a departure from its predecessor, The Matrix Reloaded is a worthy sequel packed with popcorn-friendly thrills.\\" On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score 62 out of 100, based on 40 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B+\\" on an A+ to F scale. Positive comments from critics included commendation for the quality and intensity of its action sequences, and its intelligence. Tony Toscano of Talking Pictures had high praise for the film, saying that \\"its character development and writing...is so crisp it crackles on the screen\\" and that \\"Matrix Reloaded re-establishes the genre and even raises the bar a notch or two\\" above the first film, The Matrix. Negative comments included the sentiment that the plot was alienating, with some critics regarding the focus on the action as a detriment to the film's human elements. Some critics thought that the number of scenes with expository dialog worked against the film, and the many unresolved subplots, as well as the cliffhanger ending, were also criticized. Other criticisms included the film's perceived lack of pacing. Entertainment Weekly named it as one of \\"The 25 Worst Sequels Ever Made\\". =Awards= =Censorship= The film was initially banned in Egypt because of the violent content and because it put into question issues about human creation, \\"which are related to the three divine religions.\\"  Home media  The Matrix Reloaded was released on VHS and DVD on October 14, 2003. A Blu-Ray release followed on September 7, 2010. The Matrix Reloaded was released as a part of The Matrix Trilogy on 4K UHD Blu-ray on October 30, 2018.

It is a type of metaplasia, which includes all cell fate switches, including the interconversion of stem cells. Current uses of transdifferentiation include disease modeling and drug discovery and in the future may include gene therapy and regenerative medicine. The term 'transdifferentiation' was originally coined by Selman and Kafatos in 1974 to describe a change in cell properties as cuticle producing cells became salt- secreting cells in silk moths undergoing metamorphosis. Discovery Davis et al. 1987 reported the first instance of transdifferentiation where a cell changed from one adult cell type to another. Forcing mouse embryonic fibroblasts to express MyoD was found to be sufficient to turn those cells into myoblasts. Natural examples The only known instances where adult cells change directly from one lineage to another occurs in the species Turritopsis dohrnii and Turritopsis Nutricula. Rather, cells dedifferentiate and then redifferentiate into the cell type of interest. In newts when the eye lens is removed, pigmented epithelial cells de-differentiate and then redifferentiate into the lens cells. In the pancreas, it has been demonstrated that alpha cells can spontaneously switch fate and transdifferentiate into beta cells in both healthy and diabetic human and mouse pancreatic islets. While it was previously believed that oesophageal cells were developed from the transdifferentiation of smooth muscle cells, that has been shown to be false. Induced and therapeutic examples The first example of functional transdifferentiation has been provided by Ferber et al.Ferber S, Halkin A, Cohen H, Ber I, Einav Y, Goldberg I, Barshack I, Seijffers R, Kopolovic J, Kaiser N, Karasik A (2000) Pancreatic and duodenal homeobox gene 1 induces expression of insulin genes in liver and ameliorates streptozotocin-induced hyperglycemia. http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/v6/n5/full/nm0500_568.html by inducing a shift in the developmental fate of cells in the liver and converting them into 'pancreatic beta-cell-like' cells. The cells induced a wide, functional and long-lasting transdifferentiation process that reduced the effects of hyperglycemia in diabetic mice.Sarah Ferber, Amir Halkin, Hofit Cohen, Idit Ber, Yulia Einav, Iris Goldberg, Iris Barshack, Rhona Seijffers, Juri Kopolovic, Nurit Kaiser & Avraham Karasik (2000) - \\"Pancreatic and duodenal homeobox gene 1 induces expression of insulin genes in liver and ameliorates streptozotocin-induced hyperglycemia\\" Moreover, the trans- differentiated beta-like cells were found to be resistant to the autoimmune attack that characterizes type 1 diabetes.Shternhall-Ron K et al., Ectopic PDX-1 expression in liver ameliorates type 1 diabetes, Journal of Autoimmunity (2007), doi:10.1016/j.jaut.2007.02.010. http://www.orgenesis.com/uploads/default/files/shternhall-jai-2007.pdf The second step was to undergo transdifferentiation in human specimens. By transducing liver cells with a single gene, Sapir et al. were able to induce human liver cells to transdifferentiate into human beta cells.Tamar Sapir, Keren Shternhall, Irit Meivar-Levy, Tamar Blumenfeld, Hamutal Cohen, Ehud Skutelsky, Smadar Eventov-Friedman, Iris Barshack, Iris Goldberg, Sarah Pri- Chen, Lya Ben-Dor, Sylvie Polak-Charcon, Avraham Karasik, Ilan Shimon, Eytan Mor, and Sarah Ferber (2005) Cell-replacement therapy for diabetes: Generating functional insulin-producing tissue from adult human liver cells This approach has been demonstrated in mice, rat, xenopus and human tissues (Al-Hasani et al., 2013). Schematic model of the hepatocyte-to-beta cell transdifferentiation process. Hepatocytes are obtained by liver biopsy from diabetic patient, cultured and expanded ex vivo, transduced with a PDX1 virus, transdifferentiated into functional insulin-producing beta cells, and transplanted back into the patient. Granulosa and theca cells in the ovaries of adult female mice can transdifferentiate to Sertoli and Leydig cells via induced knockout of the FOXL2 gene. Similarly, Sertoli cells in the testes of adult male mice can transdifferentiate to granulosa cells via induced knockout of the DMRT1 gene. Methods = Lineage-instructive approach = In this approach, transcription factors from progenitor cells of the target cell type are transfected into a somatic cell to induce transdifferentiation. There exists two different means of determining which transcription factors to use: by starting with a large pool and narrowing down factors one by one or by starting with one or two and adding more. One theory to explain the exact specifics is that ectopic Transcriptional factors direct the cell to an earlier progenitor state and then redirects it towards a new cell type. Rearrangement of the chromatin structure via DNA methylation or histone modification may play a role as well. Here is a list of in vitro examples and in vivo examples. In vivo methods of transfecting specific mouse cells utilize the same kinds of vectors as in vitro experiments, except that the vector is injected into a specific organ. Zhou et al. (2008) injected Ngn3, Pdx1 and Mafa into the dorsal splenic lobe (pancreas) of mice to reprogram pancreatic exocrine cells into Œ≤-cells in order to ameliorate hyperglycaemia. = Initial epigenetic activation phase approach = Somatic cells are first transfected with pluripotent reprogramming factors temporarily (Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, etc.) before being transfected with the desired inhibitory or activating factors. Here is a list of examples in vitro. =Pharmacological agents= The DNA methylation inhibitor, 5-azacytidine is also known to promote phenotypic transdifferentiation of cardiac cells to skeletal myoblasts. In prostate cancer, treatment with androgen receptor targeted therapies induces neuroendocrine transdifferentiation in a subset of patients. No standard of care exists for these patients, and those diagnosed with treatment induced neruoendocrine carcinoma are typically treated palliatively. = Mechanism of action = The transcription factors serve as a short term trigger to an irreversible process. The transdifferentiation liver cells observed 8 months after one single injection of pdx1. The ectopic transcription factors turn off the host repertoire of gene expression in each of the cells. However, the alternate desired repertoire is being turned on only in a subpopulation of predisposed cells. Despite the massive dedifferentiation ‚Äì lineage tracing approach indeed demonstrates that transdifferentiation originates in adult cells. = Mogrify algorithm = Determining the unique set of cellular factors that is needed to be manipulated for each cell conversion is a long and costly process that involved much trial and error. As a result, this first step of identifying the key set of cellular factors for cell conversion is the major obstacle researchers face in the field of cell reprogramming. An international team of researchers have developed an algorithm, called Mogrify(1), that can predict the optimal set of cellular factors required to convert one human cell type to another. When tested, Mogrify was able to accurately predict the set of cellular factors required for previously published cell conversions correctly. To further validate Mogrify's predictive ability, the team conducted two novel cell conversions in the laboratory using human cells, and these were successful in both attempts solely using the predictions of Mogrify. Mapping out cell conversion Mogrify has been made available online for other researchers and scientists. Issues =Evaluation= When examining transdifferentiated cells, it is important to look for markers of the target cell type and the absence of donor cell markers which can be accomplished using green fluorescent protein or immunodetection. It is also important to examine the cell function, epigenome, transcriptome, and proteome profiles. Cells can also be evaluated based upon their ability to integrate into the corresponding tissue in vivo and functionally replace its natural counterpart. In one study, transdifferentiating tail-tip fibroblasts into hepatocyte-like cells using transcription factors Gata4, Hnf1Œ± and Foxa3, and inactivation of p19(Arf) restored hepatocyte-like liver functions in only half of the mice using survival as a means of evaluation. =Transition from mouse to human cells= Generally transdifferentiation that occurs in mouse cells does not translate in effectiveness or speediness in human cells. Pang et al. found that while transcription factors Ascl1, Brn2 and Myt1l turned mouse cells into mature neurons, the same set of factors only turned human cells into immature neurons. However, the addition of NeuroD1 was able to increase efficiency and help cells reach maturity. =Order of transcription factor expression= The order of expression of transcription factors can direct the fate of the cell. Iwasaki et al. (2006) showed that in hematopoietic lineages, the expression timing of Gata-2 and (C/EBPalpha) can change whether or not a lymphoid-committed progenitors can differentiate into granulocyte/monocyte progenitor, eosinophil, basophil or bipotent basophil/mast cell progenitor lineages. =Immunogenicity= It has been found for induced pluripotent stem cells that when injected into mice, the immune system of the synergeic mouse rejected the teratomas forming. Part of this may be because the immune system recognized epigenetic markers of specific sequences of the injected cells. However, when embryonic stem cells were injected, the immune response was much lower. Whether or not this will occur within transdifferentiated cells remains to be researched. = Method of transfection = In order to accomplish transfection, one may use integrating viral vectors such as lentiviruses or retroviruses, non-integrating vectors such as Sendai viruses or adenoviruses, microRNAs and a variety of other methods including using proteins and plasmids; one example is the non-viral delivery of transcription factor-encoding plasmids with a polymeric carrier to elicit neuronal transdifferentiation of fibroblasts. When foreign molecules enter cells, one must take into account the possible drawbacks and potential to cause tumorous growth. Integrating viral vectors have the chance to cause mutations when inserted into the genome. One method of going around this is to excise the viral vector once reprogramming has occurred, an example being Cre- Lox recombination Non-integrating vectors have other issues concerning efficiency of reprogramming and also the removal of the vector. Other methods are relatively new fields and much remains to be discovered. Pluripotent reprogramming *Almost all factors that reprogram cells into pluripotency have been discovered and can turn a wide variety of cells back into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). However, many of the reprogramming factors that can change a cell's lineage have not been discovered and these factors apply only for that specific lineage. *The final products of transdifferentiated cells are capable of being used for clinical studies, but iPSCs must be differentiated. *It may become possible in the future to use transdifferentiation in vivo, whereas pluripotent reprogramming may cause teratomas in vivo. *Transdifferentiated cells will require less epigenetic marks to be reset, whereas pluripotent reprogramming requires nearly all to be removed, which may become an issue during redifferentiation. *Transdifferentiation is geared towards moving between similar lineages, whereas pluripotent reprogramming has unlimited potential. *Pluripotent cells are capable of self-renewal and often go through many cell passages, which increases the chance of accumulating mutations. Cell culture may also favor cells that are adapted for surviving under those conditions, as opposed to inside an organism. Transdifferentiation requires fewer cell passages and would reduce the chance of mutations. *Transdifferentiation can also be much more efficient than pluripotency reprogramming due to the extra step involved in the latter process. *Both pluripotent and transdifferentiated cells use adult cells, thus starting cells are very accessible, whereas human embryonic stem cells require that one navigate legal loopholes and delve into the morality of stem cell research debate.

It was one of the first apocalyptic novels of the nuclear age and has remained popular more than half a century after it was first published, consistently ranking in Amazon.com's Top 20 Science Fiction Short Stories list (which groups together short story collections and novels) and has an entry in David Pringle's book Science Fiction: The 100 Best Novels. The novel deals with the effects of a nuclear war on the fictional small town of Fort Repose, Florida, which is based upon the actual city of Mount Dora, Florida. The novel's title is derived from the Book of Revelation: \\"Alas, alas, that great city Babylon, that mighty city! for in one hour is thy judgment come.\\" The cover art for the Bantam paperback edition was made by Robert Hunt. Plot The story is set in a fictional 1959, following two years of escalating tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union for dominance in the Middle East and in the Mediterranean Sea. The Soviets are menacing Turkey from three sides through their proxies in Egypt, Syria and Iraq in order to gain control of the Bosporus and give free passage to their large Mediterranean fleet. To counteract the Soviet menace the United States established a military presence in Lebanon and are providing aid to their Turkish and Israeli allies. As detailed in the book, the Soviets gained a temporary space supremacy through the launch of a massive fleet of militarized Sputniks; moreover, they are aware that, within three or four years, the United States will cover the gap. Intelligence from a Soviet officer who defected in Berlin provided information about a Soviet war plan involving a sudden, overwhelming nuclear first strike on U.S. and NATO military and civilian targets, in order to minimize retaliation and become the leading world power. According to the leaked war plan the Soviet leadership considers acceptable the loss of 20 to 30 million of their own civilian population due to the retaliatory strike by NATO. Narration follows the point of view of Randy Bragg, who lives an aimless life in the small Central Florida town of Fort Repose. His older brother, Colonel Mark Bragg, an Air Force Intelligence officer, sends a telegram ending in the words, \\"Alas, Babylon\\", a pre- established code between the brothers to warn of imminent disaster. Mark flies his family down to Fort Repose for their protection while he stays at Strategic Air Command headquarters at Offutt Air Force Base in Omaha, Nebraska. Soon afterward, a U.S. fighter pilot, attempting to intercept an enemy plane over the Mediterranean, inadvertently destroys an ammunition depot in a large Soviet submarine base in Latakia, Syria. The explosion is mistaken for a large-scale U.S. air assault on the military facility and, by the following day, Soviet Union retaliates with its planned full-scale nuclear strike against the United States and its allies. U.S. missiles, with Mark as a witness, are sent in retaliation. Randy and his guests awake to the shaking from the bombing of nearby military bases; one explosion temporarily blinds Peyton, Randy's niece. Fort Repose descends into chaos: tourists are trapped in their hotels, communication lines fail, the CONELRAD radio system barely operates, convicts escape from prisons and a run on the banks causes currency to become worthless. In the weeks and months after the attack sporadic news gathered through an old but still-functioning vacuum tube radio receiver show that many major cities of the U.S. are in ruins and vast regions of the Continental United States are labeled by the government as off-limits, \\"contaminated zones\\". The whole of Florida is among the contaminated areas, leaving the stranded survivors of Fort Repose without hope of immediate assistance. Most of the government has been eliminated, with the U.S. presidency defaulting to Josephine Vanbruuker-Brown, the former Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare. Other international broadcasts reveal that Western Europe was badly hit by Soviet missiles as well (a dire situation in southern France is mentioned). Soviet leadership was eliminated by U.S. retaliation and the capital of the Soviet Union was moved to Central Asia, but war still rages for months after the attack, although it is fought mostly between the remnants of U.S. Air Force and scattered Soviet Navy nuclear submarines. Since Randy was an Army Reserve officer before the Soviet attack, a radio dispatch by President Vanbruuker-Brown formally empowers him as the local authority under the current emergency situation. Randy then organizes a community self-defence team against bandits and tries to rid the community of radioactive jewellery taken into Fort Repose from the radioactive ruins of Miami. The search for alternative food sources is also prominent in the months following the attack, leading to the launch of a rag-tag fleet of fishing boats to sift the surrounding swamps for fish and to a desperate search for the much-needed salt. The following year, an Air Force helicopter arrives at Fort Repose. The crew assess the status of the residents and the local environment, explaining that the area around Fort Repose is perhaps the largest patch of non-contaminated soil in the whole State of Florida and that, after all, the survivors of Fort Repose managed to fare better than many other places in the U.S. Randy also learns that his brother Mark has most likely died when Omaha and Offutt Base were destroyed by multiple hits. When the crew of the helicopter offer to evacuate the residents out of Florida, the residents choose to stay. It is finally revealed that the United States won the war, but at a tremendous cost: it lost most of its population (45 million survivors are estimated overall), its military, its infrastructure and most of its natural resources (ironically, the government is planning to use the large stockpiles of military-grade uranium and plutonium left from the war to power the surviving towns and cities). The U.S. is now receiving food, fuel and medicine aid from third-world countries such as Thailand, Indonesia and Venezuela. Apparently, the \\"Three Greats\\" (deliberately left unclear but likely India, China and Japan) have taken the role of world leading powers in place of U.S. and Soviet Union.

This is distinguished from real-time strategy (RTS), in which all players play simultaneously. Examples =Board games= Many board games are turn based, such as chess, Reversi, checkers, Hare games, and Go, as well as many modern board games. =Turn-based tactics= Turn-based tactical game- play is characterized by the expectation of players to complete their tasks by using the combat forces provided to them, and usually by the provision of a realistic (or at least believable) representation of military tactics and operations. Tactical role-playing games are a part of this genre. Examples include Fire Emblem, The Battle for Wesnoth, Poxnora, Silent Storm, Steel Panthers: World at War!, King's Bounty, Great Big War Game, Nintendo Wars, UniWar, XCOM 2 and Chessaria: The Tactical Adventure. =Mainstream computer games= After a period of converting board and historic TBS games to computer games, companies began basing computer turn-based strategy games on completely original properties or concepts. The presence of a computer to calculate and arbitrate allows game complexity which is not feasible in a traditional board game. Some well known turn-based strategy games are Final Fantasy series, Sid Meier's Civilization series, Heroes of Might and Magic series, Panzer General series, Warlords series, and Age of Wonders series. =Indie games= The Battle for Wesnoth is an open source turn-based strategy game. A further market trend is the rise of \\"Indie\\" TBS games (games produced by small groups, independent or only somewhat affiliated with the major elements in the computer games industry). These games often extend or refine already existing TBS games. Examples include Freeciv or Golden Age of Civilizations. =Open- source games= Since turn-based strategy games do not typically require vast amounts of art or modeling, developers willing to volunteer their time can focus on gameplay. Directories like Freecode provide large lists of open- source, turn-based strategy projects. =Browser-based games= Online browser-based games do not require users to install files and are often free.

American Revolutionary War veteran Daniel Shays led four thousand rebels (called Shaysites) in a protest against economic and civil rights injustices. Shays was a farmhand from Massachusetts at the beginning of the Revolutionary War; he joined the Continental Army, saw action at the Battles of Lexington and Concord, Battle of Bunker Hill, and Battles of Saratoga, and was eventually wounded in action. In 1787, Shays' rebels marched on the federal Springfield Armory in an unsuccessful attempt to seize its weaponry and overthrow the government. The federal government found itself unable to finance troops to put down the rebellion, and it was consequently put down by the Massachusetts State militia and a privately funded local militia. The widely held view was that the Articles of Confederation needed to be reformed as the country's governing document, and the events of the rebellion served as a catalyst for the Constitutional Convention and the creation of the new government. There is still debate among scholars concerning the rebellion's influence on the Constitution and its ratification. Background Populist Governor John Hancock refused to crack down on tax delinquencies and accepted devalued paper currency for debts. Artist's depiction of protesters watching a debtor in a scuffle with a tax collector by the courthouse at Springfield, Massachusetts. The insurrection was a tax- related rebellion. The economy during the American Revolutionary War was largely subsistence agriculture in the rural parts of New England, particularly in the hill towns of central and western Massachusetts. Some residents in these areas had few assets beyond their land, and they bartered with one another for goods and services. In lean times, farmers might obtain goods on credit from suppliers in local market towns who would be paid when times were better.Szatmary, pp. 1‚Äì10 Conversely, there was a market economy in the more economically developed coastal areas of Massachusetts Bay and in the fertile Connecticut River Valley, driven by the activities of wholesale merchants dealing with Europe and the West Indies.Szatmary, pp. 10‚Äì15 The state government was dominated by this merchant class.Szatmary, p. 32 When the Revolutionary War ended in 1783, Massachusetts merchants' European business partners refused to extend lines of credit to them and insisted that they pay for goods with hard currency, despite the country-wide shortage of such currency. Merchants began to demand the same from their local business partners, including those operating in the market towns in the state's interior.Szatmary, pp. 25‚Äì31 Many of these merchants passed on this demand to their customers, although Governor John Hancock did not impose hard currency demands on poorer borrowers and refused to actively prosecute the collection of delinquent taxes.Richards, p. 85 The rural farming population was generally unable to meet the demands of merchants and the civil authorities, and some began to lose their land and other possessions when they were unable to fulfill their debt and tax obligations. This led to strong resentments against tax collectors and the courts, where creditors obtained judgments against debtors, and where tax collectors obtained judgments authorizing property seizures.Szatmary, pp. 29‚Äì34 A farmer identified as \\"Plough Jogger\\" summarized the situation at a meeting convened by aggrieved commoners:Zinn, p. 91 > I have been greatly abused, have been obliged to do more than my part in the > war, been loaded with class rates, town rates, province rates, Continental > rates, and all rates ... been pulled and hauled by sheriffs, constables, and > collectors, and had my cattle sold for less than they were worth... The > great men are going to get all we have and I think it is time for us to rise > and put a stop to it, and have no more courts, nor sheriffs, nor collectors > nor lawyers. Veterans had received little pay during the war and faced added difficulty collecting pay owed to them from the State or the Congress of the Confederation, and some soldiers began to organize protests against these oppressive economic conditions. In 1780, Daniel Shays resigned from the army unpaid and went home to find himself in court for non-payment of debts. He soon realized that he was not alone in his inability to pay his debts and began organizing for debt relief.Zinn, p. 93 Early rumblings Governor James Bowdoin instituted a heavy tax burden and stepped up a collection of back taxes. One early protest against the government was led by Job Shattuck of Groton, Massachusetts in 1782, who organized residents to physically prevent tax collectors from doing their work.Szatmary, p. 43 A second, larger- scale protest took place in Uxbridge, Massachusetts on the Rhode Island border on February 3, 1783, when a mob seized property that had been confiscated by a constable and returned it to its owners. Governor Hancock ordered the sheriff to suppress these actions.Bacon, p. 1:148 Most rural communities attempted to use the legislative process to gain relief. Petitions and proposals were repeatedly submitted to the state legislature to issue paper currency, which would depreciate the currency and make it possible to pay a high-value debt with lower-valued paper. The merchants were opposed to the idea, including James Bowdoin, since they stood to lose from such measures, and the proposals were repeatedly rejected.Szatmary, pp. 38‚Äì42, 45 Governor Hancock resigned in early 1785 citing health reasons, though some suggested that he was anticipating trouble.G. North Bowdoin had repeatedly lost to Hancock in earlier elections, but he was elected governor that year‚Äîand matters became more severe. He stepped up civil actions to collect back taxes, and the legislature exacerbated the situation by levying an additional property tax to raise funds for the state's portion of foreign debt payments.Richards, pp. 87‚Äì88 Even comparatively conservative commentators such as John Adams observed that these levies were \\"heavier than the People could bear\\".Richards, p. 88 Shutting down the courts Protests in rural Massachusetts turned into direct action in August 1786 after the state legislature adjourned without considering the many petitions that had been sent to Boston.Richards, pp. 6‚Äì9Szatmary, p. 38 On August 29, a well-organized force of protestors formed in Northampton, Massachusetts and successfully prevented the county court from sitting. The leaders of this force proclaimed that they were seeking relief from the burdensome judicial processes that were depriving the people of their land and possessions. They called themselves Regulators, a reference to the Regulator movement of North Carolina which sought to reform corrupt practices in the late 1760s.Szatmary, p. 56 Governor Bowdoin issued a proclamation on September 2 denouncing such mob action, but he took no military measures beyond planning a militia response to future actions.Szatmary, pp. 79‚Äì80 The court was then shut down in Worcester, Massachusetts by similar action on September 5, but the county militia refused to turn out, as it was composed mainly of men sympathetic to the protestors.Szatmary, p. 80 Governors of the neighboring states acted decisively, calling out the militia to hunt down the ringleaders in their own states after the first such protests.Szatmary, pp. 78‚Äì79 Matters were resolved without violence in Rhode Island because the \\"country party\\" gained control of the legislature in 1786 and enacted measures forcing its merchants to trade debt instruments for devalued currency. Boston's merchants were concerned by this, especially Bowdoin who held more than ¬£3,000 in Massachusetts notes.Richards, pp. 84‚Äì87 Daniel Shays had participated in the Northampton action and began to take a more active role in the uprising in November, though he firmly denied that he was one of its leaders. The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts indicted 11 leaders of the rebellion as \\"disorderly, riotous, and seditious persons\\". The court was scheduled to meet next in Springfield, Massachusetts on September 26, and Shays organized an attempt to shut it down in Northampton, while Luke Day organized an attempt in Springfield.Holland, pp. 245‚Äì247 They were anticipated by William Shepard, the local militia commander, who began gathering government-supporting militia the Saturday before the court was to sit, and he had 300 men protecting the Springfield courthouse by opening time. Shays and Day were able to recruit a similar number but chose only to demonstrate, exercising their troops outside of Shepard's lines rather than attempting to seize the building. The judges first postponed hearings and then adjourned on the 28th without hearing any cases. Shepard withdrew his force (which had grown to some 800 men) to the Springfield Armory, which was rumored to be the target of the protestors.Holland, p. 247 Militia general William Shepard defended the Springfield Armory against rebel action. Protests were also successful in shutting down courts in Great Barrington, Concord, and Taunton, Massachusetts in September and October. James Warren wrote to John Adams on October 22, \\"We are now in a state of Anarchy and Confusion bordering on Civil War.\\"Manuel, p. 219 Courts were able to meet in the larger towns and cities, but they required protection of the militia which Bowdoin called out for the purpose.Morse, p. 208 Governor Bowdoin commanded the legislature to \\"vindicate the insulted dignity of government\\". Samuel Adams claimed that foreigners (\\"British emissaries\\") were instigating treason among citizens. Adams helped draw up a Riot Act and a resolution suspending habeas corpus so the authorities could legally keep people in jail without trial. Adams proposed a new legal distinction that rebellion in a republic should be punished by execution. The legislature also moved to make some concessions on matters that upset farmers, saying that certain old taxes could now be paid in goods instead of hard currency. These measures were followed by one prohibiting speech critical of the government and offering pardons to protestors willing to take an oath of allegiance.Szatmary, p. 84 These legislative actions were unsuccessful in quelling the protests, and the suspension of habeas corpus alarmed many.Szatmary, p. 92 Warrants were issued for the arrest of several of the protest ringleaders, and a posse of some 300 men rode to Groton on November 28 to arrest Job Shattuck and other rebel leaders in the area. Shattuck was chased down and arrested on the 30th and was wounded by a sword slash in the process.Szatmary, pp. 92‚Äì93 This action and the arrest of other protest leaders in the eastern parts of the state angered those in the west, and they began to organize an overthrow of the state government. \\"The seeds of war are now sown\\", wrote one correspondent in Shrewsbury,Szatmary, p. 94 and by mid-January rebel leaders spoke of smashing the \\"tyrannical government of Massachusetts\\".Szatmary, p. 97 Rebellion The federal government had been unable to recruit soldiers for the army because of a lack of funding, so Massachusetts leaders decided to act independently. On January 4, 1787, Governor Bowdoin proposed creating a privately funded militia army. Former Continental Army General Benjamin Lincoln solicited funds and raised more than ¬£6,000 from more than 125 merchants by the end of January.Szatmary, pp. 84‚Äì86 The 3,000 militiamen who were recruited into this army were almost entirely from the eastern counties of Massachusetts, and they marched to Worcester on January 19.Szatmary, pp. 86‚Äì89, 104 General Benjamin Lincoln, portrait by Henry Sargent While the government forces assembled, Shays and Day and other rebel leaders in the west organized their forces establishing regional regimental organizations that were run by democratically elected committees. Their first major target was the federal armory in Springfield.Szatmary, pp. 98‚Äì99 General Shepard had taken possession of the armory under orders from Governor Bowdoin, and he used its arsenal to arm a militia force of 1,200. He had done this even though the armory was federal property, not state, and he did not have permission from Secretary at War Henry Knox.Richards, pp. 27‚Äì28Holland, p. 261 The insurgents were organized into three major groups and intended to surround and attack the armory simultaneously. Shays had one group east of Springfield near Palmer, Luke Day had a second force across the Connecticut River in West Springfield, and the force under Eli Parsons was to the north at Chicopee.Richards, p. 28 The rebels had planned their assault for January 25, but Day changed this at the last minute and sent a message to Shays indicating that he would not be ready to attack until the 26th.Szatmary, p. 101 Day's message was intercepted by Shepard's men, so the militia of Shays and Parsons approached the armory on the 25th not knowing that they would have no support from the west;Richards, p. 29 instead, they found Shepard's militia waiting for them. Shepard first ordered warning shots fired over the heads of Shays' men, and then he ordered two cannons to fire grape shot. Four Shaysites were killed and 20 wounded. There was no musket fire from either side, and the rebel advance collapsed.Szatmary, p. 102 Most of the rebel forces fled north, both Shays' men and Day's men, and they eventually regrouped at Amherst, Massachusetts.Szatmary, p. 103 General Lincoln immediately began marching west from Worcester with the 3,000 men that had been mustered. The rebels moved generally north and east to avoid him, eventually establishing a camp at Petersham, Massachusetts. They raided the shops of local merchants for supplies along the way and took some of the merchants hostage. Lincoln pursued them and reached Pelham, Massachusetts on February 2, some from Petersham.Szatmary, pp. 103‚Äì104 He led his militia on a forced march to Petersham through a bitter snowstorm on the night of February 3‚Äì4, arriving early in the morning. They surprised the rebel camp so thoroughly that the rebels scattered \\"without time to call in their out parties or even their guards\\".Szatmary, p. 105 Lincoln claimed to capture 150 men but none of them were officers, and historian Leonard Richards has questioned the veracity of the report. Most of the leadership escaped north into New Hampshire and Vermont, where they were sheltered despite repeated demands that they be returned to Massachusetts for trial.Richards, pp. 31, 120 Aftermath This monument marks the spot of the final battle of Shays' Rebellion in Sheffield, Massachusetts. Lincoln's march marked the end of large-scale organized resistance. Ringleaders who eluded capture fled to neighboring states, and pockets of local resistance continued. Some rebel leaders approached Lord Dorchester for assistance, the British governor of the Province of Quebec who reportedly promised assistance in the form of Mohawk warriors led by Joseph Brant.Szatmary, p. 108 Dorchester's proposal was vetoed in London, however, and no assistance came to the rebels.Richards, p. 34 The same day that Lincoln arrived at Petersham, the state legislature passed bills authorizing a state of martial law and giving the governor broad powers to act against the rebels. The bills also authorized state payments to reimburse Lincoln and the merchants who had funded the army and authorized the recruitment of additional militia.Richards, p. 32 On February 16, 1787, the Massachusetts legislature passed the Disqualification Act to prevent a legislative response by rebel sympathizers. This bill forbade any acknowledged rebels from holding a variety of elected and appointed offices.Richards, p. 33 Most of Lincoln's army melted away in late February as enlistments expired, and he commanded only 30 men at a base in Pittsfield by the end of the month.Richards, p. 35 In the meantime, some 120 rebels had regrouped in New Lebanon, New York, and they crossed the border on February 27, marching first on Stockbridge, Massachusetts, a major market town in the southwestern corner of the state. They raided the shops of merchants and the homes of merchants and local professionals. This came to the attention of Brigadier John Ashley, who mustered a force of some 80 men and caught up with the rebels in nearby Sheffield late in the day for the bloodiest encounter of the rebellion: 30 rebels were wounded (one mortally), at least one government soldier was killed, and many were wounded.Szatmary (p. 122) and Richards (p. 36) disagree on the casualty figures. Szatmary reports three government soldiers killed, Richards one. Richards does not report on the government wounded. Ashley was further reinforced after the encounter, and he reported taking 150 prisoners.Richards, p. 36 Consequences Four thousand people signed confessions acknowledging participation in the events of the rebellion in exchange for amnesty. Several hundred participants were eventually indicted on charges relating to the rebellion, but most of these were pardoned under a general amnesty that only excluded a few ringleaders. Eighteen men were convicted and sentenced to death, but most of these were overturned on appeal, pardoned, or had the sentences commuted. John Bly and Charles Rose, however, were hanged on December 6, 1787.Richards, pp. 38‚Äì41 They were also accused of a common-law crime, as both were looters. Shays was pardoned in 1788 and he returned to Massachusetts from hiding in the Vermont woods. He was vilified by the Boston press, who painted him as an archetypal anarchist opposed to the government.Richards, p. 117 He later moved to the Conesus, New York area where he died poor and obscure in 1825.Zinn, p. 95 The crushing of the rebellion and the harsh terms of reconciliation imposed by the Disqualification Act all worked against Governor Bowdoin politically. He received few votes from the rural parts of the state and was trounced by John Hancock in the gubernatorial election of 1787.Richards, pp. 38‚Äì39 The military victory was tempered by tax changes in subsequent years. The legislature cut taxes and placed a moratorium on debts and also refocused state spending away from interest payments, resulting in a 30-percent decline in the value of Massachusetts securities as those payments fell in arrears.Richards, p. 119 Vermont was an unrecognized independent republic that had been seeking independent statehood from New York's claims to the territory. It became an unexpected beneficiary of the rebellion due to sheltering the rebel ringleaders. Alexander Hamilton broke from other New Yorkers, including major landowners with claims on Vermont territory, calling for the state to recognize and support Vermont's bid for admission to the union. He cited Vermont's de facto independence and its ability to cause trouble by providing support to the discontented from neighboring states, and he introduced legislation that broke the impasse between New York and Vermont. Vermonters responded favorably to the overture, publicly pushing Eli Parsons and Luke Day out of the state (but quietly continuing to support others). Vermont became the fourteenth state after negotiations with New York and the passage of the new constitution.Richards, p. 122 Impact on the Constitution Thomas Jefferson was serving as ambassador to France at the time and refused to be alarmed by Shays' Rebellion. He argued in a letter to James Madison on January 30, 1787, that occasional rebellion serves to preserve freedoms. In a letter to William Stephens Smith on November 13, 1787, Jefferson wrote, \\"The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants. It is its natural manure.\\"Foner, p. 219 In contrast, George Washington had been calling for constitutional reform for many years, and he wrote in a letter dated October 31, 1786, to Henry Lee, \\"You talk, my good sir, of employing influence to appease the present tumults in Massachusetts. I know not where that influence is to be found, or, if attainable, that it would be a proper remedy for the disorders. Influence is not government. Let us have a government by which our lives, liberties, and properties will be secured, or let us know the worst at once.\\"Lodge, p. 2:26Feer, p. 396 = Influence upon the Constitutional Convention = The 1787 Constitutional Convention by Junius Brutus Stearns, 1856 At the time of the rebellion, the weaknesses of the federal government as constituted under the Articles of Confederation were apparent to many. A vigorous debate was going on throughout the states on the need for a stronger central government, with Federalists arguing for the idea, and Anti-Federalists opposing them. Historical opinion is divided on what sort of role the rebellion played in the formation and later ratification of the United States Constitution, although most scholars agree that it played some role, at least temporarily drawing some anti-Federalists to the strong government side.Szatmary, p. 120 By early 1785, many influential merchants and political leaders were already agreed that a stronger central government was needed. Shortly after Shays' Rebellion broke out, delegates from five states met in Annapolis, Maryland from September 11‚Äì14, 1786, and they concluded that vigorous steps were needed to reform the federal government, but they disbanded because of a lack of full representation and authority, calling for a convention of all the states to be held in Philadelphia in May 1787.Szatmary, p. 122 Historian Robert Feer notes that several prominent figures had hoped that the convention would fail, requiring a larger-scale convention, and French diplomat Louis-Guillaume Otto thought that the convention was intentionally broken off early to achieve this end.Feer, pp. 391‚Äì392 In early 1787, John Jay wrote that the rural disturbances and the inability of the central government to fund troops in response made \\"the inefficiency of the Federal government more and more manifest\\".Szatmary, p. 123 Henry Knox observed that the uprising in Massachusetts clearly influenced local leaders who had previously opposed a strong federal government. Historian David Szatmary writes that the timing of the rebellion \\"convinced the elites of sovereign states that the proposed gathering at Philadelphia must take place\\".Szatmary, p. 127 Some states delayed choosing delegates to the proposed convention, including Massachusetts, in part because it resembled the \\"extra-legal\\" conventions organized by the protestors before the rebellion became violent.Feer, p. 393 = Influence upon the Constitution = Elbridge Gerry (1861 portrait by James Bogle) opposed the Constitution as drafted, although his reasons for doing so were not strongly influenced by the rebellion. The convention that met in Philadelphia was dominated by strong- government advocates.Richards, p. 132 Delegate Oliver Ellsworth of Connecticut argued that because the people could not be trusted (as exemplified by Shays' Rebellion), the members of the federal House of Representatives should be chosen by state legislatures, not by popular vote.Richards, p. 134 The example of Shays' Rebellion may also have been influential in the addition of language to the constitution concerning the ability of states to manage domestic violence, and their ability to demand the return of individuals from other states for trial.Szatmary, p. 130 The rebellion also played a role in the discussion of the number of chief executives the United States would have going forward. While mindful of tyranny, delegates of the Constitutional Convention thought that the single executive would be more effective in responding to national disturbances.Milkis, S., Nelson, M., The American Presidency. Washington: CQ Press, 2003. Fourth Edition. Print Federalists cited the rebellion as an example of the confederation government's weaknesses, while opponents such as Elbridge Gerry, a merchant speculator and Massachusetts delegate from Essex County, thought that a federal response to the rebellion would have been even worse than that of the state. He was one of the few convention delegates who refused to sign the new constitution, although his reasons for doing so did not stem from the rebellion.Feer, p. 395 = Influence upon ratification = When the constitution had been drafted, Massachusetts was viewed by Federalists as a state that might not ratify it, because of widespread anti-Federalist sentiment in the rural parts of the state. Massachusetts Federalists, including Henry Knox, were active in courting swing votes in the debates leading up to the state's ratifying convention in 1788. When the vote was taken on February 6, 1788, representatives of rural communities involved in the rebellion voted against ratification by a wide margin, but the day was carried by a coalition of merchants, urban elites, and market town leaders. The state ratified the constitution by a vote of 187 to 168.Szatmary, p. 133 Historians are divided on the impact the rebellion had on the ratification debates. Robert Feer notes that major Federalist pamphleteers rarely mentioned it and that some anti- Federalists used the fact that Massachusetts survived the rebellion as evidence that a new constitution was unnecessary.Feer, p. 404 Leonard Richards counters that publications like the Pennsylvania Gazette explicitly tied anti- Federalist opinion to the rebel cause, calling opponents of the new constitution \\"Shaysites\\" and the Federalists \\"Washingtonians\\".Richards, p. 139 David Szatmary argues that debate in some states was affected, particularly in Massachusetts, where the rebellion had a polarizing effect.Szatmary, pp. 128‚Äì132 Richards records Henry Jackson's observation that opposition to ratification in Massachusetts was motivated by \\"that cursed spirit of insurgency\\", but that broader opposition in other states originated in other constitutional concerns expressed by Elbridge Gerry, who published a widely distributed pamphlet outlining his concerns about the vagueness of some of the powers granted in the constitution and its lack of a Bill of Rights.Richards, pp. 141‚Äì143 The military powers enshrined in the constitution were soon put to use by President George Washington. After the passage by the United States Congress of the Whiskey Act, protest against the taxes it imposed began in western Pennsylvania. The protests escalated and Washington led federal and state militia to put down what is now known as the Whiskey Rebellion.Richards, pp. 135‚Äì136 Memorials The events and people of the uprising are commemorated in the towns where they lived and those where events took place. Sheffield erected a memorial (pictured above) marking the site of the \\"last battle\\", and Pelham memorialized Daniel Shays. US Route 202, which runs through Pelham, is called the Daniel Shays Highway. A statue of General Shepard was erected in his hometown of Westfield.Richards, pp. 117‚Äì118 In the town of Petersham, Massachusetts, a memorial was erected in 1927 by the New England Society of Brooklyn, New York. The memorial commemorates the government's General Benjamin Lincoln, who raised 3,000 troops and routed the rebellion on February 4, 1787.

Its economy is largely agricultural. The population was 118 at the 2010 census. Geography Hingham is located at (48.555641, -110.422951). According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land. History of \\"The Town on the Square\\" Hingham is a small agricultural community in northern Montana. Hingham, like many Hi-Line towns, developed as a grain storage and shipping center along the Great Northern Railway (BNSF Railway) and U.S. Route 2. In 1909, homesteaders purchased a relinquishment for the town site, and by early 1910 they had a town established. The community was planned on a broad grid with a central town square as its dominant feature. Hingham prospered in its early years with the opening of a school, hospital, several churches and over forty businesses. In 1917 Hingham incorporated with an elected mayor/council style government. The Hingham Bar (bank) photographed by John Margolies Community members have developed the town square into one of the best parks on the Hi-Line, much of it through volunteer work and donations. A popular landmark of the town is the water tower which can be seen for miles. The Hingham School was established in 1910 with the Rangers as their mascot and red, white and black as their colors. The school operated until the early 1980s when it consolidated with the neighboring Rudyard School to form Blue Sky Schools. Once again in 2005, Blue Sky Schools consolidated with KG Schools (Kremlin-Gildford) to form North Star Schools. In recent decades Hingham's population has declined due to lack of economic opportunity. In 2010 Hingham celebrated its Centennial.

Except in rare cases where they are formed by an insurgency, domestic or foreign governments actively participate in, support, or ignore the death squad's activities. Death squads are distinct from assassination due to their permanent organization and the larger number of victims (typically thousands or more) who may not be prominent individuals. Other violence, such as rape, torture, arson, or bombings may be carried out alongside murders.https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/hurq3√∑=53 They may comprise a secret police force, paramilitary militia groups, government soldiers, policemen, or combinations thereof. They may also be organized as vigilantes. When death squads are not controlled by the state, they may consist of insurgent forces or organized crime, such as the ones used by cartels.  History  Although the term \\"death squad\\" did not rise to notoriety until the activities of such groups became widely known in Central and South America during the 1970s and 80s, death squads have been employed under different guises throughout history. The term was first used by the fascist Iron Guard in Romania. It officially installed Iron guard death squads in 1936 in order to kill political enemies.Laignel-Lavastine, Alexandra. Cioran, Eliade, Ionesco. L'oubli du fascisme. Paris: Presses Universitaires de France, 2002, 116. It was also used during the Battle of Algiers by Paul Aussaresses.Interview of Paul Aussaresses by Marie-Monique Robin in Escadrons de la mort ‚Äì l'√©cole fran√ßaise (See here, starting at 8min38) = Cold War usage = In Latin America, death squads first appeared in Brazil where a group called Esquadr√£o da Morte (literally \\"Death Squad\\") emerged in the 1960s; they subsequently spread to Argentina and Chile in the 1970s, and they were later used in Central America during the 1980s. Argentina used extrajudicial killings as a way of crushing the liberal and communist opposition to the military junta during the 'Dirty War' of the 1970s. For example, Alianza Anticomunista Argentina was a far-right death squad mainly active during the \\"Dirty War\\". The Chilean military regime of 1973‚Äì1990 also committed such killings. See Operation Condor for examples. During the Salvadoran civil war, death squads achieved notoriety on March 24, 1980, when a sniper assassinated Archbishop √ìscar Romero as he said Mass inside a convent chapel. In December 1980, three American nuns, Ita Ford, Dorothy Kazel, and Maura Clarke, and a lay worker, Jean Donovan, were gang raped and murdered by a military unit later found to have been acting on specific orders. Death squads were instrumental in killing hundreds of real and suspected Communists. Priests who were spreading liberation theology, such as Father Rutilio Grande, were often targeted as well. The murderers were found to have been soldiers of the Salvadoran military, which was receiving U.S. funding and military advisors during the Carter administration. These events prompted outrage in the U.S. and led to a temporary cutoff in military aid at the end of his presidency.Juan de Onas, \\"U.S. Suspends New Aid to El Salvador until Deaths Are Clarified,\\" New York Times, Dec. 6 1980, p.1. Death Squad activity stretched well into the Reagan years (1981‚Äì1989) as well. Honduras also had death squads active through the 1980s, the most notorious of which was the army unit Battalion 316. Hundreds of people, teachers, politicians, and union leaders were assassinated by government-backed forces. Battalion 316 received substantial training from the United States Central Intelligence Agency. In Southeast Asia, extrajudicial killings were conducted by both sides during the Vietnam War. For example, Viet Cong member Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn L√©m, famous for being extrajudicially executed on camera by General Nguy·ªÖn Ng·ªçc Loan on 1 February 1968 in Saigon, was himself later claimed to have commanded a death squad targeting South Vietnamese policemen and their families during the Tet Offensive in Saigon. = Recent use = , death squads have continued to be active in several locations, including Chechnya, Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Central African Republic, Nigeria, Colombia, Iraq, Yemen, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, South Sudan, Syria, Somalia, Kenya, Tanzania, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Philippines among others.  By continent  = Africa =  Ivory Coast  Death squads are reportedly active in this country. This has been condemned by the US but appears to be difficult to stop. Moreover, there is no proof as to whom is behind the killings In an interview with the Pan-African magazine \\"Jeune Afrique\\", Laurent Gbagbo accused one of the opposition leaders, Alassane Ouattara (ADO), to be the main organizer of the media frenzy around his wife's involvement in the killing squads. He also successfully sued and won, in French courts, in cases against the French newspapers that made the accusations.  Kenya  In December 2014, Kenyan Anti-Terrorism Police Unit officers confessed to Al-Jazeera that they were responsible for almost 500 of the extrajudicial killings. The murders reportedly totalled several hundred homicides every year. They included the assassination of Abubaker Shariff Ahmed \\"Makaburi\\", an Al-Shabaab associate from Kenya, who was among 21 Muslim radicals allegedly murdered by the Kenyan police since 2012. According to the agents, they resorted to killing after the Kenyan police could not successfully prosecute terror suspects. In doing so, the officers indicated that they were acting on the direct orders of Kenya's National Security Council, which consisted of the Kenyan President, Deputy President, Chief of the Defence Forces, Inspector General of Police, National Security Intelligence Service Director, Cabinet Secretary of Interior, and Principal Secretary of Interior. Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta and the National Security Council of Kenya members denied operating an extrajudicial assassination program. Additionally, the officers suggested that Western security agencies provided intelligence for the program, including the whereabouts and activities of government targets. They asserted that Britain supplied further logistics in the form of equipment and training. One Kenyan officer within the Council's General Service Unit also indicated that Israeli instructors taught them how to kill. The head of the International Bar Association, Mark Ellis, cautioned that any such involvement by foreign nations would constitute a breach of international law. The United Kingdom and Israel denied participation in the Kenyan National Security Council's reported death squads, with the UK Foreign Office indicating that it had approached the Kenyan authorities over the charges.  South Africa  Beginning in the 1960s, the African National Congress (ANC) and its ally, the South African Communist Party (SACP), and the Pan-Africanist Congress (PAC), began a campaign to topple South Africa's National Party (NP)-controlled apartheid Government. Both the ANC's armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK), and South African security forces routinely engaged in bombings and targeted killings, both at home and abroad. Particularly notorious apartheid death squads were the Civil Cooperation Bureau (CCB) and the South African Police's counter- insurgency unit C10, commanded by Colonel Eugene de Kock and based at the Vlakplaas farm west of Pretoria, itself also a center for torture of prisoners. After the end of Apartheid, death squad violence conducted by both the National Party and the ANC was investigated by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.  Uganda  From 1971 to 1979, Ugandan dictator Idi Amin set up death squads to murder enemies of the state. =North America=  Dominican Republic  Rafael Trujillo's Dominican government employed a death squad, known as la 42 and led by Miguel Angel Paulino, that tooled around in a stylish red Packard called the Carro de la Muerte (Death Car). During the 12-year regime of Joaqu√≠n Balaguer, the Frente Democr√°tico Anticomunista y Antiterrorista, most known as la Banda Color√°, continued the practices of la 42.  Haiti  The Tonton Macoute was a paramilitary force created in 1959 by Haitian dictator Fran√ßois \\"Papa Doc\\" Duvalier that murdered 30,000 to 60,000 Haitians.  Mexico  Cristero rebels publicly hanged on telegraph poles in Jalisco, Mexico. The bodies often remained on the poles until the pueblo or town renounced public religious practice. In a way similar to the American Indian Wars, the early Mexican nation struggled against Apache raids. Between 1835 and 1837, only 15 years after the Mexican independence and at the midst of the Texan Revolution, the local governments of the Mexican states of Sonora and Chihuahua (that border with the U.S. states of Texas, New Mexico and Arizona ) put a bounty on the Apache bands that were in the area. In the case of Chihuahua the bounty attracted \\"bounty hunters\\" from the United States, that were often Anglo Americans, runaway slaves and even from other Indian tribes, it was paid based on Apache scalps, 100 pesos per warrior, 50 pesos per woman, and 25 pesos per child. As historian Donald E. Worcester wrote: \\"The new policy attracted a diverse group of men, including Anglos, runaway slaves led by Seminole John Horse, and Indians ‚Äî Kirker used Delawares and Shawnees; others, such as Terrazas, used Tarahumaras; and Seminole Chief Coacoochee led a band of his own people who had fled from Indian Territory.\\" =After the Mexican Revolution= For more than seven decades following the Mexican Revolution, the Mexican State was a one-party state ruled by the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI). During this era, death squad tactics were routinely used against suspected enemies of the state. During the 1920s and 1930s, the PRI's founder, President Plutarco El√≠as Calles, used death squads against Mexico's Roman Catholic majority. Calles explained his reasons in a private telegram to the Mexican Ambassador to the French Third Republic, Alberto Jos√© Pani Arteaga. \\"...Catholic Church in Mexico is a political movement, and must be eliminated ... free of religious hypnotism which fools the people... within one year without the sacraments, the people will forget the faith...\\"Jean Meyer, PhD La Cristiada: The Mexican People's War for Religious Liberty, . SquareOne Publishers. Calles and his adherents used the Mexican Army and police, as well as paramilitary forces like the Red Shirts, to abduct, torture, and execute priests, nuns, and actively religious laity. Mexican Catholics were also routinely hanged from telegraph poles along the railroad lines. Prominent victims of the Mexican State's campaign against Catholicism include the teenager Jose Sanchez del Rio, the Jesuit priest Father Miguel Pro, and the Christian Pacifist Anacleto Gonz√°lez Flores. (see also Saints of the Cristero War). In response, an armed revolt against the Mexican State, the Cristero War, began in 1927. Composed largely of peasant volunteers and commanded by retired General Enrique Gorostieta Velarde, the Cristeros were also responsible for atrocities. Among them were the assassination of former Mexican President √Ålvaro Obreg√≥n, train robberies, and violent attacks against rural teachers. The uprising largely ended after the Holy See and the Mexican State negotiated a compromise agreement. Refusing to lay down his arms despite offers of amnesty, General Gorostieta was killed in action by the Mexican Army in Jalisco on 2 June 1929. Following the cessation of hostilities, more than 5,000 Cristeros were summarily executed by Mexican security forces. The events of the Cristero War are depicted in the 2012 film For Greater Glory. =During the Cold War= During the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, death squads continued to be used against anti-PRI activists, both Marxists and social conservatives. One example of this is the 1968 Tlatelolco massacre, in which an anti-regime protest rally was attacked by security forces in Mexico City. After this event, paramilitary groups like \\"Los Halcones\\" (The hawks) and the \\"Brigada blanca\\" (White brigade) were used to attack, hunt and exterminate political dissidents. Allegations have been made by both journalists and American law enforcement of collusion between senior PRI statesmen and the Mexican drug cartels. It has even been alleged that, under PRI rule, no drug traffickers were ever successful without the permission of the Mexican State. If the same drug trafficker fell from favor, however, Mexican law enforcement would be ordered to move against their operation, as happened to Pablo Acosta Villarreal in 1987. =Regime change and \\"Drug war tactics\\"= By the early 1990s, the PRI started to lose the grip on its absolute political power, however, its corruption became so pervasive that Juarez Cartel boss Amado Carrillo Fuentes was even able to purchase a window in Mexico's air defense system. During this period, his airplanes were permitted to smuggle narcotics into the United States without the interference of the Mexican Air Force. As a result, Carillo Fuentes became known as \\"The Lord of the Skies.\\" It is believed by American and Mexican investigators that the PRI would also use the cartels to commit assassinations which were too sensitive to be traced back to the ruling party. One murder believed to be an example of this is the 1993 murder of Cardinal Juan Jes√∫s Posadas Ocampo. The PRI also used death squad tactics against the Zapatista guerilla movement. In 1997, forty-five people were killed by a Mexican security forces in Chenalho, Chiapas. In 2000, however, during an internal power struggle between former President Salinas and President Zedillo, the PRI was peacefully voted out from power, until 2013 when they partially regained their influence and power, only to lose again in 2018. It is also alleged that, during the time they first lost the presidency, some of the most powerful PRI members were supporting and protecting drug cartels that they used as death squads against their criminal and political rivals, being this one of the real reasons the PAN party government accepted to start the Mexican drug war against the Cartels. However, it is also alleged that during this period of time the turmoil of war has been used by the parties in power to exterminate even more political dissidents, activists and their own rivals. An example of this is the case of the 2014 forced disappearance and assassination of 43 activist rural students from the Ayotzinapa Teachers' College, in the hands of police officers colluded with the \\"Guerreros Unidos\\" drug cartel.  United States  During the California Gold Rush, the state government between 1850 and 1859 financed and organized militia units to hunt down and kill Native Americans in the state. Between 1850 and 1852 the state appropriated almost one million dollars for the activities of these militias, and between 1854 and 1859 the state appropriated another $500,000, almost half of which was reimbursed by the federal government. By one estimate, at least 4,500 Californian Indians were killed between 1849 and 1870. Contemporary historian Benjamin Madley has documented the numbers of Californian Indians killed between 1846 and 1873; he estimates that during this period at least 9,492 to 16,092 Californian Indians were killed by non-Indians. Most of the deaths took place in what he defined as more than 370 massacres (defined as the \\"intentional killing of five or more disarmed combatants or largely unarmed noncombatants, including women, children, and prisoners, whether in the context of a battle or otherwise\\"). Some scholars contend that the state financing of these militias, as well as the US government's role in other massacres in California, such as the Bloody Island and Yontoket Massacres, in which up to 400 or more natives were killed in each massacre, constitutes acts of genocide against the native people of California. Lawrence and killed 164 defenders. Beginning in the 1850s, pro- slavery Bushwhackers and anti-slavery Jayhawkers waged war against each other in the Kansas Territory. Due to the horrific atrocities committed by both sides against civilians, the territory was dubbed \\"Bleeding Kansas\\". After the American Civil War began, the fraternal bloodshed increased. The most infamous atrocity which was committed in Kansas during the American Civil War was the Lawrence Massacre. A large force group of Bushwhackers who were led by William Clarke Quantrill and Bloody Bill Anderson attacked and burned down the pro- Union town of Lawrence, Kansas in retaliation for the Jayhawkers' earlier destruction of Osceola, Missouri. The Bushwhackers shot down nearly 150 unarmed men and boys. During Reconstruction, embittered Confederate veterans supported the Ku Klux Klan and similar vigilante organizations throughout the American South. The Klan and its counterparts terrorized and lynched lynched African-Americans, northern carpetbaggers, and Southern \\"scalawags\\". This was often done with the unofficial support of the Democratic Party leadership. Historian Bruce B. Campbell has called the KKK, \\"one of the first proto-death squads\\". Campbell alleges that the difference between it and modern-day death- squads is the fact that the Ku Klux Klan was composed of members of a defeated regime rather than members of the ruling government. \\"Otherwise, in its murderous intent, its links to private elite interests, and its covert nature, it very closely resembles modern-day death squads.\\"Arthur D. Brenner and Bruce B. Campbell, Eds. \\"Death Squads in Global Perspective: Murder With Deniability,\\" New York: St. Martin's Press (2000). Ultimately, U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant declared a state of emergency in the American South and gave the United States Army the power to break up the Klan. Some Klansmen were tried before military tribunals and hanged. In the early 21st Century, American police departments underwent a process of hyper-militarization as part of the Homeland Security Act. https://www.infragardnational.org/wp- content/uploads/2019/05/Homeland-Security-and-Police-Militarization.pdf As a result of this proliferation of military equipment and more aggressive training, American police officers have carried out numerous extrajudicial killings on an ad hoc basis. https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-new- estimate-of-killings-by-police-is-way-higher-and-still-too- lowhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/police- shootingshttps://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/in-fatal-shootings-by- police-1-in-5-officers-names-go- undisclosed/2016/03/31/4bb08bc8-ea10-11e5-b0fd-073d5930a7b7_story.htmlhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/police- shootings-2017/ In June 2020, Los Angeles County Deputy Sheriff Austreberto ‚ÄúArt‚Äù Gonzalez filed a claim against the county, claiming that approximately twenty percent of the deputies operating in the county's Compton Station belonged to a secret death squad. Gonzales alleges that the group, named \\"The Executioners\\", carried out multiple extrajudicial killings over the years and that members followed initiation rituals, including being tattooed with skulls and nazi imagery.https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/los-angeles-deputy- says-colleagues-are-part-of-violent- gang/2020/08/04/9aed4050-d697-11ea-a788-2ce86ce81129_story.htmlhttps://losangeleno.com/features/lasd- whistleblower-executioners = Central America =  El Salvador  massacres that occurred during the civil war During the Salvadoran civil war, death squads (known in Spanish by the name of Escuadr√≥n de la Muerte, \\"Squadron of Death\\") achieved notoriety when a sniper assassinated Archbishop √ìscar Romero while he was saying Mass in March 1980. In December 1980, three American nuns and a lay worker were gangraped and murdered by a military unit later found to have been acting on specific orders. Death squads were instrumental in killing thousands of peasants and activists. Funding for the squads came primarily from right-wing Salvadoran businessmen and landowners.Bonner, Raymond, Weakness and Deceit:: U.S. Policy and El Salvador, New York Times Books, 1984, p.330 Because the death squads involved were found to have been soldiers of the Salvadoran military security forces, which were receiving U.S. arms, funding, training and advice during the Carter, Reagan and George H. W. Bush administrations, these events prompted some outrage in the U.S. Human rights activists criticized U.S. administrations for denying Salvadoran government links to the death squads. Veteran Human Rights Watch researcher Cynthia J. Arnson writes that \\"particularly during the years 1980‚Äì1983 when the killing was at its height (numbers of killings could reach as far as 35,000), assigning responsibility for the violence and human rights abuses was a product of the intense ideological polarization in the United States. The Reagan administration downplayed the scale of abuse as well as the involvement of state actors. Because of the level of denial, as well as the extent of U.S. involvement with the Salvadoran military and security forces, the U.S. role in El Salvador- what was known about death squads, when it was known, and what actions the United States did or did not take to curb their abuses- became an important part of El Salvador's death squad story.\\"Arnson, Cynthia J. \\"Window on the Past: A Declassified History of Death Squads in El Salvador\\" in Death Squads in Global Perspective: Murder with Deniability, Campbell and Brenner, eds, 88 Some death squads, such as Sombra Negra, are still operating in El Salvador. The Salvadoran Army's U.S.-trained Atlacatl Battalion was responsible for the El Mozote massacre where more than 800 civilians were murdered, over half of them children, the El Calabozo massacre, and the murders of six Jesuits in 1989. Notorious Salvadoran Battalion Is Disbanded : Military: U.S.-trained Atlacatl unit was famed for battle prowess but was also implicated in atrocities. Los Angeles Times. 9 December 1992.  Honduras  Honduras had death squads active through the 1980s, the most notorious of which was Battalion 3‚Äì16. Hundreds of people, teachers, politicians, and union bosses were assassinated by government-backed forces. Battalion 316 received substantial support and training from the United States Central Intelligence Agency. At least 19 members were School of the Americas graduates. Seven members, including Billy Joya, later played important roles in the administration of President Manuel Zelaya as of mid-2006. Following the 2009 coup d'√©tat, former Battalion 3‚Äì16 member Nelson Willy Mej√≠a Mej√≠a became Director-General of Immigration and Billy Joya was de facto President Roberto Micheletti's security advisor. Another former Battalion 3‚Äì16 member, Napole√≥n Nassar Herrera, was high Commissioner of Police for the north-west region under Zelaya and under Micheletti, and also became a Secretary of Security spokesperson \\"for dialogue\\" under Micheletti. Zelaya claimed that Joya had reactivated the death squad, with dozens of government opponents having been murdered since the ascent of the Michiletti and Lobo governments.  Guatemala  Throughout the Guatemalan Civil War, both military and \\"civilian\\" governments utilized death squads as a counterinsurgency strategy. The use of \\"death squads\\" as a government tactic became particularly widespread after 1966. Throughout 1966 and the first three months of 1967, within the framework of what military commentators referred to as \\"el-contra terror\\", government forces killed an estimated 8,000 civilians accused of \\"subversive\\" activity.Michael MeClintock, The American Connection, vol. 2, State Terror and Popular Resistance in Guatemala (London: Zed, 1985), pp. 84‚Äì85. This marked a turning point in the history of the Guatemalan security apparatus, and brought about a new era in which mass murder of both real and suspected subversives by government \\"death squads\\" became a common occurrence in the country. A noted Guatemalan sociologist estimated the number of government killings between 1966 and 1974 at approximately 5,250 a year (for a total death toll of approximately 42,000 during the presidencies of Julio C√©sar M√©ndez Montenegro and Carlos Arana Osorio).Gabriel Aguilera Peralta, \\"The Militarization of the State\\", in Guatemala in Rebellion: Unfinished History Killings by both official and unofficial security forces would climax in the late 1970s and early 1980s under the presidencies of Fernando Romeo Lucas Garc√≠a and Efra√≠n R√≠os Montt, with over 18,000 documented killings in 1982 alone. Greg Grandin claims that \\"Washington, of course, publicly denied its support for paramilitarism, but the practice of political disappearances took a great leap forward in Guatemala in 1966 with the birth of a death squad created, and directly supervised, by U.S. security advisors.\\" An upsurge in rebel activity in Guatemala convinced the US to provide increased counterinsurgency assistance to Guatemala's security apparatus in the mid to late 1960s. Documents released in 1999 details how United States military and police advisers had encouraged and assisted Guatemalan military officials in the use of repressive techniques, including helping establish a \\"safe house\\" from within the presidential palace as a location to coordinate counter insurgency activities. In 1981, it was reported by Amnesty International that this same \\"safe house\\" was in use by Guatemalan security officials to coordinate counterinsurgency activities involving the use of the \\"death squads.\\"AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL, 1981, Guatemala: A Government Program of Political Murder, in: The New York Review of Books, 19 March 1981 According to a victim's brother, Mirtala Linares \\"He wouldn't tell us anything; he claimed they hadn't captured [Sergio], that he knew nothing of his whereabouts ‚Äì and that maybe my brother had gone as an illegal alien to the United States! That was how he answered us.\\"  Nicaragua  Throughout the Ortega regime, starting in 2006, but escalating with the 2018‚Äì2020 Nicaraguan protests, the dictatorship has employed death squads also known as \\"Turbas\\" or paramilitary groups armed and aided by the National Police to attack pro-democracy protesters. The government's crackdown of lethal force was condemned by the international community, the Organization of American States, Human Rights Watch, and the local and international Catholic Church. = South America =  Argentina  Amnesty International reports that \\"the security forces in Argentina first started using \\"death squads\\" in late 1973. One example was Alianza Anticomunista Argentina, a far-right death squad mainly active during the \\"Dirty War\\". By the time military rule ended in 1983 some 1,500 people had been killed directly by \\"death squads\\", and over 9,000 named people and many more undocumented victims had been \\"disappeared\\"‚Äîkidnapped and murdered secretly‚Äîaccording to the officially appointed National Commission on Disappeared People (CONADEP).Amnesty International ‚Äì Getting Away With Murder: Political Killings and Disappearances in the 1990s, 1993,36  Brazil  The Esquadr√£o da Morte (\\"Death Squad\\" in Portuguese) was a paramilitary organization that emerged in the late 1960s in the context of the Brazilian Military Dictatorship. It was the first group to have received the name \\"Death Squad\\" in Latin America, but its actions resembled traditional vigilantism as most executions were not exclusively political-related. The greater share of the political executions during the 21 years of Military Dictatorship (1964‚Äì1985) were done by the Brazilian Armed Forces itself. The purpose of the original \\"Death Squad\\" was, with the consent of the military government, to persecute, torture and kill suspected criminals (marginais) regarded as dangerous to society. It began in the former State of Guanabara led by Detective Mariel Mariscot, one of the \\"Twelve Golden Men of Rio de Janeiro's Police\\", and from there it spread throughout Brazil in the 1970s. In general, its members were politicians, members of the judiciary, and police officials. As a rule, these groups were financed by members of the business community.Sociedade, cultura e pol√≠tica: ensaios cr√≠ticos. Ana Am√©lia da Silva, Miguel Wady Chaia, Carmen Junqueira ‚Äì 2004 ‚Äì p. 625 In the 1970s and 1980s, several other organizations were modeled after the 1960s Esquadr√£o da Morte. The most famous such organization is Scuderie Detetive Le Cocq (English: Shield of Detective Le Cocq), named after deceased Detective Milton Le Cocq. The group was particularly active in the Brazilian Southeastern States of Guanabara and Rio de Janeiro, and remains active in the state of Esp√≠rito Santo. In the State of S√£o Paulo, Death Squads and individual gunmen called \\"justiceiros\\" were pervasive and executions almost were exclusively the work of off-duty policemen. In 1983, a police officer nicknamed \\"Cabo Bruno\\" was convicted for murdering more than 50 victims.Vigilantism and the state in modern Latin America: essays on extralegal violence Martha Knisely Huggins (ed.) ‚Äì 1991 ‚Äì p. 211 The \\"Death Squads\\" active under the rule of the military dictatorship continue as a cultural legacy of the Brazilian police. In the 2000s, police officers remain linked with death-squad-type executions. In 2003, roughly 2,000 extrajudicial murders occurred in S√£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, with Amnesty International claiming the numbers are likely far higher. Brazilian politician Fl√°vio Bolsonaro, the son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, was accused of having ties to death squads.  Chile  One of the most notorious murder gangs operated by the Chilean Army was the Caravan of Death, whose members travelled by helicopter throughout Chile between 30 September and 22 October 1973. During this foray, members of the squad ordered or personally carried out the execution of at least 75 individuals held in Army custody in these garrisons.Chile priest charged over deaths, BBC, 1 September 2007 According to the NGO Memoria y Justicia, the squad killed 26 in the South and 71 in the North, making a total of 97 victims.Caravan of Death , Memoria y Justicia Augusto Pinochet was indicted in December 2002 in this case, but he died four years later without having been convicted.

According to the Chilean Government's own Truth and Reconciliation (Rettig) report, 2,279 people were killed in the operations of Pinochet's regime.Usip.org In June 1999, judge Juan Guzm√°n Tapia ordered the arrest of five retired generals.  Colombia  The United States supported death squads in Colombia, El Salvador and Guatemala during the 1980s. In 1993, Amnesty International reported that clandestine military units began covertly operating as death squads in 1978. According to the report, throughout the 1980s political killings rose to a peak of 3,500 in 1988, averaging some 1,500 victims per year since then, and \\"over 1,500 civilians are also believed to have \\"disappeared\\" since 1978.\\"El Salvador: The Spectre of Death Squads  Amnesty International The AUC, formed in 1997, was the most prominent paramilitary group. According to a 2014 report published by Human Rights Watch (HRW) on Buenaventura, a port town in Colombia, \\"entire neighborhoods were dominated by powerful paramilitary successor groups\\" HRW reports that the groups \\"restrict residents' movements, recruit their children, extort businesses, and routinely engage in horrific acts of violence against anyone who defies their will.\\" It is reported that scores of people have been \\"disappeared\\" from the town over the years. Bodies are dismembered before they are disposed of and residents have reported the existence of casas de pique, \\"chop-up houses\\" where people are slaughtered. Many residents have fled and are considered to have been \\"forcibly displaced\\": 22,028 residents fled in 2011, 15,191 in 2012, and 13,468 between January and October 2013. In Colombia, the terms \\"death squads\\", \\"paramilitaries\\" or \\"self-defense groups\\" have been used interchangeably and otherwise, referring to either a single phenomenon, also known as paramilitarism, or to different but related aspects of the same.Rangel, Alfredo (editor); William Ram√≠rez Tob√≥n, Juan Carlos Garz√≥n, Stathis Kalyvas, Ana Arjona, Fidel Cu√©llar Boada, Fernando Cubides Cipagauta (2005). El Poder Paramilitar. Bogot√°: Editorial Planeta Colombiana S.A., 26. There are reports that Los Pepes, the death squad led by brothers Fidel and Carlos Casta√±o, had ties to some members of the Colombian National Police, especially the Search Bloc (Bloque de B√∫squeda) unit. A report from the country's public prosecutors office at the end of 2009 reported the number of 28,000 disappeared by paramilitary and guerrilla groups. only 300 corpses were identified and 600 in 2009. According to the prosecutor's office, it will take many more years before all the bodies recovered can be identified. At least 40% of the national legislature are said to have ties to paramilitary groups. In August 2018, prosecutors in Colombia charged 13 Chiquita brands with supporting the right wing death squad that killed hundreds in the Urab√° Antioquia region between 1996 and 2004. Salvatore Mancuso, a jailed paramilitary leader, has accused Del Monte, Dole and Chiquita of funding right wing death squads. Chiquita was fined $25 million after admitting they had paid $1.7 million to paramilitaries over six years; the reason for the payments remains a matter of dispute, with Chiquita claiming the money was routine extortion money paid to paramilitary groups to protect workers. Activists, on the other hand, insist that a portion of the money paid by Chiquita was used to finance political assassinations.  Peru  Peruvian government death squads carried out massacres against radicals and civilians in their fight against Shining Path and T√∫pac Amaru Revolutionary Movement.Comando Rodrigo Franco  Venezuela  In its 2003 and 2002 world reports, Human Rights Watch reported the existence of death squads in several Venezuelan states, involving members of the local police, the DISIP and the National Guard. These groups were responsible for the extrajudicial killings of civilians and wanted or alleged criminals, including street criminals, looters and drug users. In 2019, amid the Crisis in Bolivarian Venezuela, the government of Nicol√°s Maduro was accused by a UN human rights report of using death squads to conduct thousands of extrajudicial executions. The report relayed a multitude of eyewitness accounts, describing the government‚Äôs Special Action Forces (FAES) frequently arriving at homes in unmarked vehicles, executing male suspects on the spot, then planting drugs or weapons on the corpse to make it appear the victim died resisting arrest. According to the report, the executions were part of a campaign aimed at ‚Äúneutralizing, repressing and criminalizing political opponents and people critical of the government‚Äù.https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela- un/venezuela-death-squads-kill-young-men-stage-scenes-u-n-report-says- idUSKCN1TZ1PW The Maduro government condemned the report as ‚Äúopenly biased‚Äù.https://www.dw.com/en/venezuelas-army-death-squads-kill-thousands- un/a-49477147 = Asia =  Bangladesh  In contemporary times, the Bangladeshi \\"Rapid Action Battalion\\" has been criticized by rights groups for its use of extrajudicial killings.  In addition, there have been many reports of torture in connection with the battalion's activities. Several battalion members have been accused of murder and obstruction of justice during the Narayanganj Seven murder. They've been known to kill civilian suspects for the explicit purpose of avoiding trials. They have also been accused of carrying out a campaign of forced disappearances.  Cambodia  The Khmer Rouge began employing death squads to purge Cambodia of non- communists after taking over the country in 1975. They rounded up their victims, questioned them and then took them out to killing fields.  India  The secret killings of Assam (1998‚Äì2001) was probably the darkest chapter in Assam's political history when relatives, friends, sympathisers of ULFA insurgents were systematically killed by unknown assailants. These extrajudicial murders happened in Assam between 1998 and 2001. These extrajudicial killings were conducted by the state government using SULFA members and the security forces in the name of counter-insurgency operations. The victims of these killings were relatives, friends and colleagues of ULFA militants. The most apparent justification for the whole exercise was that it was a tit-for-tat response to the ULFA-sponsored terrorism, specially the killings of their old comrades‚Äîthe SULFAs.  Indonesia  In 1965‚Äì1966, hundreds of thousands of leftists and those believed tied to the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI) were massacred by the Indonesian military and right- wing paramilitary death squads after a failed coup attempt which was blamed on the Communists. At least 400,000 to 500,000 people, perhaps as many as 3 million, were killed over a period of several months, with thousands more being interred in prisons and concentration camps under extremely inhumane conditions. The violence culminated in the fall of President Sukarno and the commencement of Suharto's thirty-year authoritarian reign.Mark Aarons (2007). \\"Justice Betrayed: Post-1945 Responses to Genocide.\\" In David A.

Philippines  President Rodrigo Duterte There are certain vigilante death squads that are active in the Philippines, especially in Davao City where local death squads roam around the city to hunt criminals. After winning the Presidency in June 2016, Rodrigo Duterte had urged, \\"If you know of any addicts, go ahead and kill them yourself as getting their parents to do it would be too painful.\\" By March 2017, the death toll for the Philippine Drug War passed 8,000 people.  South Korea  News reports on the use of death squads in Korea originated around the middle of the 20th century such as the Jeju Massacre and Daejeon. There were also the multiple deaths that made the news in 1980 in Gwangju.  Thailand  During the Cold War, in the short period of democracy in Thailand (1973‚Äì1976), three right-wing paramilitary groups, Nawaphon, Red Gaurs, and Village Scouts were founded and supported by Internal Security Operations Command and Border Patrol Police to promote national unity, loyalty to Thai royal family, and anti-communism. They were also heavily funded and backed by the United States government, and were under the patronage of the royal family themselves. Among their ranks were former soldiers, veterans of the Vietnam War, former mercenaries in Laos, and violent vocational students. These groups were first employed to counter protests of the pro-democracy and left-wing students movement, attacking them with firearms and grenades. When the ideological conflict escalated, they started assassinating labor and peasants union officials and progressive politicians, the most famous was Dr. Boonsanong Punyodyana, the general secretary of the Socialist Party of Thailand. The conflict reached its peak with the Thammasat University massacre in 1976, which the Royal Thai Armed Forces and Royal Thai Police, supported by the three aforementioned paramilitary groups, stormed the university and shot mostly unarmed student protesters indiscriminately, resulting in at least 46 deaths. A military coup was staged later in the same day. During the military rule, the paramilitary groups' popularity diminished. In contemporary Thailand, many extrajudicial killings occurred during the 2003 anti-drug effort of Thailand's prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra were attributed to government-sponsored death squads. Rumors still persist that there is collusion between the government, rogue military officers and radical right wing/anti-drugs death squads, with both Muslim and Buddhist sectarian death squads still operating in the South of the country. = Europe =  France  The French military used death squads during the Algerian War (1954‚Äì1962).  Germany  = Weimar Republic = Death squads first appeared in Germany following the end of the First World War and the overthrow of the House of Hohenzollern. In order to prevent a coup d'etat by Soviet- backed German Communists, the SPD-dominated government of the Weimar Republic declared a state of emergency and ordered the recruitment of war veterans into militias called the Freikorps. Although officially answering to Defense Minister Gustav Noske, the Freikorps tended to be drunken, trigger happy, and loyal only to their own commanders. However, they were instrumental in the defeat of the 1919 Spartacist Uprising and the annexation of the short-lived Bavarian Soviet Republic. The most famous victims of the Freikorps were the Communist leaders Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg, who were captured after the suppression of the Spartacist Uprising and shot without trial. After the Freikorps units turned against the Republic in the monarchist Kapp Putsch, many of the leaders were forced to flee abroad and the units were largely disbanded. Some Freikorps veterans drifted into the ultra-nationalist Organisation Consul, which regarded the 1918 Armistice and the Versailles Treaty as treasonous and assassinated politicians who were associated with them. Among their victims were Matthias Erzberger and Walter Rathenau, both of whom were cabinet ministers in the Weimar regime. In addition, the city of Munich remained a headquarters of Russian White √©migr√© hit teams, which targeted those who were believed to have betrayed the Tsar. Their most infamous operation remains the 1922 attempt on the life of Russian Provisional Government statesman Pavel Miliukov in Berlin. When newspaper publisher Vladimir Dmitrievich Nabokov attempted to shield the intended victim, he was fatally shot by assassin Piotr Shabelsky-Bork. During the same era, the Communist Party of Germany also operated its own assassination squads. Titled, the Rotfrontk√§mpferbund they carried out assassinations of carefully selected individuals from the Weimar regime as well as assassinations of members of rival political parties. The most infamous operations of Weimar-era Communist death squads remain the 1931 slayings of Berlin police Captains Paul Anlauf and Franz Lenck. Those involved in the ambush either fled to the Soviet Union or were arrested and prosecuted. Among those to receive the death penalty was Max Matern, who was later glorified as a martyr by the East German State. The last surviving conspirator, former East German secret police head Erich Mielke, was belatedly tried and convicted for the murders in 1993. The evidence needed to successfully prosecute him had been found in his personal safe after German reunification. = Nazi Germany = Einsatzgruppen murder Jews in Ivanhorod, Ukraine, 1942 Between 1933 and 1945, Germany was a one-party state ruled by the fascist Nazi Party and its leader, Adolf Hitler. During this period, the Nazis made extensive use of death squads and targeted killings. In 1934, Hitler ordered the extrajudicial killings of Ernst R√∂hm and all members of the Sturmabteilung who remained loyal to him. Simultaneously, Hitler also ordered a mass purge of the German armed forces, targeting officers who, like General Kurt von Schleicher, had opposed his drive for absolute power. These massacres have gone down in history as, \\"The Night of the Long Knives.\\" Following the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, the German military was followed by four travelling death squads called Einsatzgruppen to hunt down and kill Jews, Communists and other so-called undesirables in the occupied areas. This was the first of the massacres which comprised the Holocaust. Typically, the victims, who included women and children, were forcibly marched from their homes to open graves or ravines before being shot. Many others suffocated in specially designed poison trucks called gas vans. Between 1941 and 1944, the Einsatzgruppen killed some two million people, including about 1.3 million Jews, as well as tens of thousands of suspected political dissidents, most of the Polish upper class and intelligentsia, POWs, and uncounted numbers of Romany. Another use of death squad tactics in Nazi Germany took place after the failure of the July 20th Plot, which had aimed to assassinate Hitler and dismantle the Nazi Party. More than 4,000 members and sympathizers of the German Resistance and their families were either killed out right or subjected to judicial murder by Judge Roland Freisler of the People's Court. Those whom Freisler sentenced to death were routinely hanged from piano wire nooses within hours of their trials. These tactics ended only with the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945. = East Germany = Between the end of World War II and 1989, Germany was divided into the democratic and capitalist Federal Republic of Germany and the Communist German Democratic Republic, a one-party state under the Socialist Unity Party and its secret police, the Stasi. During these years, kangaroo courts and cavalier use of the death penalty were routinely used against suspected enemies of the State. In order to prevent East German citizens from defecting to the West, orders were issued to border guards to shoot suspected defectors on sight. During the 1980s, the Stasi carried out a mission to hunt down and assassinate West Germans who were suspected of smuggling East Germans. On the orders of the Party leadership and Stasi chief Erich Mielke, the East German Government financed, armed, and trained, \\"urban guerrillas,\\" from numerous countries. According to ex-Stasi Colonel Rainer Wiegand, ties to terrorist organizations were overseen by Markus Wolf and Department Three of the Stasi's foreign intelligence wing.Koehler (1999), pages 362-363. Members of the West German Rote Armee Fraktion,Koehler (1999), pages 387-401. the Chilean Manuel Rodr√≠guez Patriotic Front,Koehler (1999), pages 311-315. and the South African Umkhonto we SizweKoehler (1999), pages 316-318. were brought to East Germany for training in the use of military hardware and, \\"the leadership role of the Party.\\"Koehler (1999), page 313. Similar treatment was meted out to Palestinian terrorists from the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, Abu Nidal, and Black September.Koehler (1999), pages 359-386. Other Stasi agents worked as military advisers to African Marxist guerrillas and the governments they later formed. They included the Namibian SWAPO and the Angolan MPLA during the South African Border War, the FRELIMO during the Mozambican War of Independence and civil war, and Robert Mugabe's ZANLA during the Rhodesian Bush War.Koehler (1999), page 317. Colonel Wiegand revealed that Mielke and Wolf provided bodyguards from the Stasi's counter-terrorism division for Senior PLO terrorist Carlos the JackalKoehler (1999), pages 368-371. and Black September leader Abu DaoudKoehler (1999), pages 363-367. during their visits to the GDR. Col. Wiegand had been sickened by the 1972 Munich massacre and was horrified that the GDR would treat the man who ordered it as an honored guest. When he protested, Wiegand was told that Abu Daoud was, \\"a friend of our country, a high-ranking political functionary,\\" and that there was no proof that he was a terrorist.Koehler (1999), pages 365-366. During the 1980s, Wiegand secretly recruited a Libyan diplomat into spying on his colleagues. Wiegand's informant told him that the La Belle bombing and other terrorist attacks against western citizens were being planned at the Libyan Embassy in East Berlin. When Wiegand showed him a detailed report, Mielke informed the SED's Politburo, which ordered the Colonel to continue surveillance but not interfere with the plans of the Libyans.Koehler (1999), pages 325-357. Shortly before German Reunification, West Germany's Federal Constitutional Court indicted former Stasi chief Erich Mielke for collusion with two Red Army Faction terrorist attacks against U.S. military personnel. The first was the car bomb attack at Ramstein Air Base on 31 August 1981. The second was the attempted murder of United States Army General Frederick Kroesen at Heidelberg on 15 September 1981.Ex-E. German Official Charged With Fraud and Embezzlement, Los Angeles Times', April 28, 1991.\\"World IN BRIEF : GERMANY : Ex-Security Chief Accused in Attack\\", Los Angeles Times, March 27, 1991. The latter attack, which was carried out by RAF members Brigitte Mohnhaupt and Christian Klar, involved firing an RPG-7 anti-tank rocket into the General's armored Mercedes.Stars and Stripes Published: August 5, 2005 Due to reasons of senile dementia, Mielke was never placed on trial for either attack. = Federal Republic of Germany = Following German reunification, death squads linked to foreign intelligence services have continued to operate in Germany. The most infamous example of this remains the 1992 Mykonos restaurant assassinations, in which a group of anti-Islamist Iranians were fatally machine-gunned in a Greek restaurant in Berlin. A German court ultimately convicted the assassins and exposed the involvement of intelligence services of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The murder and subsequent trial has been publicized in the nonfiction bestseller The Assassins of the Turquois Palace by Roya Hakakian.  Hungary  For most of World War II, Hungary was an ally of Nazi Germany. However, the Regency Council of Admiral Mikl√≥s Horthy refused to permit the deportation of Hungarian Jews to Nazi death camps. Then, in October 1944, Horthy announced a cease-fire with the Allies and ordered the Hungarian Army to lay down their arms. In response, Nazi Germany launched Operation Panzerfaust, a covert operation which forced Horthy to abdicate in favour of the Fascist and militantly racist Arrow Cross Party, which was led by Ferenc Sz√°lasi. This was followed by an Arrow Cross coup in Budapest on the same day. Sz√°lasi was declared \\"Leader of the Nation\\" and prime minister of a \\"Government of National Unity\\". Arrow Cross rule, despite lasting only three months, was brutal. Death squads killed as many as 38,000 Hungarians. Arrow Cross officers helped Adolf Eichmann re-activate the deportation proceedings from which the Jews of Budapest had previously been spared, sending some 80,000 Jews out of the city on slave labor details and many more straight to death camps. Many Jewish males of conscription age were already serving as slave labor for the Hungarian Army's Forced Labor Battalions. Most of them died, including many who were murdered outright after the end of the fighting as they were returning home. Quickly formed battalions raided the Yellow Star Houses and combed the streets, hunting down Jews claimed to be partisans and saboteurs since Jews attacked Arrow Cross squads at least six to eight times with gunfire. These approximately 200 Jews were taken to the bridges crossing the Danube, where they were shot and their bodies borne away by the waters of the river because many were attached to weights while they were handcuffed to each other in pairs. Red Army troops reached the outskirts of the city in December 1944, and the Battle of Budapest began, although it has often been claimed that there is no proof that the Arrow Cross members and the Germans conspired to destroy the Budapest ghetto. Days before he fled the city, Arrow Cross Interior Minister Gabor V√°jna commanded that streets and squares named after Jews be renamed.Patai, p. 586 As control of the city's institutions began to decay, the Arrow Cross trained their guns on the most helpless possible targets: patients in the beds of the city's two Jewish hospitals on Maros Street and Bethlen Square, and residents in the Jewish poorhouse on Alma Road. Arrow Cross members continually sought to raid the ghettos and Jewish concentration buildings; the majority of Budapest's Jews were saved only by a handful of Jewish leaders and foreign diplomats, most famously the Swedish Raoul Wallenberg, the Papal Nuncio Monsignor Angelo Rotta, Swiss Consul Carl Lutz and Francoist Spain's consul general, Giorgio Perlasca.Patai, p. 589 Sz√°lasi knew that the documents used by these diplomats to save Jews were invalid according to international law, but ordered that they be respected. The Arrow Cross government effectively fell at the end of January 1945, when the Soviet Army took Pest and their enemies forces retreated across the Danube to Buda. Sz√°lasi had escaped from Budapest on December 11, 1944, taking with him the Hungarian royal crown, while Arrow Cross members and German forces continued to fight a rear-guard action in the far west of Hungary until the end of the war in April 1945. After the war, many of the Arrow Cross leaders were captured and tried for war crimes. Many were executed, including Ferenc Sz√°lasi. Fr. Andr√°s Kun, a Roman Catholic priest who commanded an Arrow Cross death squad while dressed in his cassock, was also convicted and hanged after the war. Fr. Kun's cassock remains on permanent display at the House of Terror in Budapest.  Ireland  ; Irish War of Independence A group of British intelligence agents (reputedly either the Cairo Gang or Igoe Gang) formed to counter IRA actions during the Irish War of Independence. During the Irish War of Independence, the Irish Republican Army under Michael Collins made use of death squads and targeted killings. At the beginning of the conflict, Collins recruited a group of men from the IRA's Dublin Brigade, who were dubbed \\"The Twelve Apostles\\". At Collins' orders, the Twelve Apostles strategically assassinated members of Crown security forces, British intelligence spymasters, and moles within IRA ranks. Collins was assisted in this by IRA moles within Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) and the Dublin Metropolitan Police. Furthermore, several secretaries working for the British Army High Command in Dublin were also working as spies for Collins. As British authority in Ireland began to disintegrate, Prime minister David Lloyd George declared a state of emergency. In order to defeat the IRA, Winston Churchill, the Secretary of State for War, suggested the recruitment of First World War veterans into paramilitary law enforcement. Lloyd George agreed to the proposal, and advertisements were filed in British newspapers. Groups of formerly enlisted men were formed into the Black and Tans, so called because of their mixture of British Army and police uniforms. Veterans who had held officers rank were formed into the Auxiliary Division, the members of which were higher paid and received better supplies. Members of both units, however, were despised by Irish civilians, against whom the \\"Tans\\" and \\"Auxies\\" routinely retaliated against for IRA raids and assassinations. To make matters worse, it was also far from unheard of for the Regular army, the Royal Irish Constabulary, or the Dublin Metropolitan Police to use the same tactics. In many cases, mixed forces of army, policemen, and paramilitaries would abduct, torture, and summarily execute Irish civilians who were suspected of being connected with the IRA or IRA members. This further eroded support for British rule among the Irish populace. A group of Black and Tans in Dublin, April 1921. On 20 March 1920, Tom√°s Mac Curtain, the nationalist Lord Mayor of Cork, was shot dead in front of his wife and son by a group of RIC officers with blackened faces. Enraged, Collins ordered the Twelve Apostles to hunt down and assassinate every one of the RIC officers involved in Mac Curtain's murder. On 22 August 1920, RIC District Inspector Oswald Swanzy, who had ordered the assassination, was shot dead with Mac Curtain's revolver while leaving a Protestant church service in Lisburn, County Antrim. This sparked a \\"pogrom\\" against the Catholic residents of the town.Coogan, p. 149.'When the killing starts do you defend God or family?' Irish Independent, Independent.ie, accessed 15/12/09, On Bloody Sunday, Collins' men set out to assassinate members of a British army intelligence group known as the Cairo Gang, killing or fatally wounding fifteen men, some of whom were unconnected to the Gang. In one incident, the IRA group was heard to scream, \\"May the Lord have mercy on your souls\\", before opening fire.T. Ryle Dwyer, The Squad and the Intelligence Operations of Michael Collins, Mercier Press, 2005. Pages 172‚Äì187. Collins later said of the incident, > My one intention was the destruction of the undesirables who continued to > make miserable the lives of ordinary decent citizens. I have proof enough to > assure myself of the atrocities which this gang of spies and informers have > committed. If I had a second motive it was no more than a feeling such as I > would have for a dangerous reptile. By their destruction the very air is > made sweeter. For myself, my conscience is clear. There is no crime in > detecting in wartime the spy and the informer. They have destroyed without > trial. I have paid them back in their own coin.Dwyer, p. 191 That afternoon, British security forces opened fire into the crowd during a Gaelic football match at Croke Park, killing 14 and wounding 68 players and spectators. The hostilities ended in 1921 with the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, which guaranteed the independence of the Irish Free State. ; Irish Civil War Irish Army soldiers escorting a captured IRA member After independence, Irish nationalist movement divided over the terms of the Anglo- Irish Treaty, which granted a partitioned Ireland Dominion status within the British Empire. Furthermore, all officials of the new Irish State were required to take an oath of allegiance to King George V. As a result, the Irish Civil War was fought between those Irish nationalists who accepted the Treaty and those who considered it treasonous. Although fought between men who had recently served together against the British, the fighting was often without quarter and brutal atrocities were committed by both sides. In IRA communications, the Irish State was referred to as, \\"The Imperial Gang,\\" the \\"Murder Government,\\" and as, \\"a British-imposed D√°il.\\" Therefore, Irish men and women who supported the Free State were regarded as traitors. At the orders of IRA Chief of Staff Liam Lynch, Anti-Treaty IRA began raising money for their cause via armed robbery of banks and post offices. On 30 November 1922, Liam Lynch issues what were dubbed the \\"orders of frightfulness\\", in which he ordered IRA members to assassinate members of the Irish Parliament, or D√°il √âireann, and Senators whenever possible. This General Order sanctioned the assassination of certain judges and newspaper editors. The IRA also launched a concerted arson campaign against the homes of members of the D√°il, or TDs. Among these attacks were the burning of the house of TD James McGarry, resulting in the death of his seven-year-old son and the murder of Free state minister Kevin O'Higgins elderly father and burning of his family home at Stradbally in early 1923. After TD Sean Hales was assassinated, the D√°il began to treat the civil war as a state of emergency. They voted to retaliate by summarily executing four captured members of IRA Executive  Rory O'Connor, Liam Mellows, Richard Barrett and Joe McKelvey. After the motion passed, all four men were executed by firing squad on December 8, 1922. During the conflict, at least 73 other captured IRA men were treated in the same fashion‚Äîsome following court martial, others without trial. There are no conclusive figures for the number of unofficial executions of captured IRA insurgents, but Republican officer Todd Andrews estimated 153.Todd Andrews, Dublin Made Me, p269 (see Executions during the Irish Civil War). At the beginning of the Civil War, the Irish State formed a special counter-terrorism police, which was called the Criminal Investigation Department. Based in Dublin's Oriel House, the CID were despised by the Anti-Treaty IRA, which referred to them as, \\"The Murder Gang.\\" During the Battle of Dublin, the CID is known to have shot 25 Anti-Treaty militants, officially while, \\"resisting arrest.\\" Ultimately, the Irish State disbanded CID upon the cessation of hostilities in 1923. Despite the best efforts of the Anti-Treaty forces, both the Irish Army and the CID proved highly effective in both combat and intelligence work. One tactic involved placing IRA message couriers under surveillance, which routinely led the Irish security forces to senior members of the insurgency. According to historian Tom Mahon, the Irish Civil War, \\"effectively ended,\\" on 10 April 1923, when the Irish Army tracked down and mortally wounded Liam Lynch during a skirmish in the Knockmealdown Mountains of County Tipperary. Twenty days later, Lynch's successor, Frank Aiken, gave the order to, \\"Surrender and dump arms.\\"Tom Mahon & James J. Gillogly, Decoding the IRA, Mercier Press, 2008. Page 66.  Russia  ;Russian Empire Oprichniki, painting by Nikolai Nevrev The first organized use of death squad violence in Russia dates from the 16th century reign of Ivan the Terrible, the first Russian monarch to claim the title of Tsar. Named the Oprichniki, they wore quivers which contained brooms, symbolizing their mission to ferret the enemies of the Tsar. They dressed in black garb, which was similar to a Russian Orthodox monastic habit, and bore the insignia of a severed dog's head (to sniff out treason and the enemies of the Tsar) and a broom (to sweep them away). The dog's head was also symbolic of their \\"nipping at the heels of the Tsar's enemies.\\" They were sometimes called the \\"Tsar's Dogs\\" on account of their loyalty to him. They also rode black horses in order to inspire a greater level of terror. Their oath of allegiance was: I swear to be true to the Lord, Grand Prince, and his realm, to the young Grand Princes, and to the Grand Princess, and not to maintain silence about any evil that I may know or have heard or may hear which is being contemplated against the Tsar, his realms, the young princes or the Tsaritsa. I swear also not to eat or drink with the zemshchina, and not to have anything in common with them. On this I kiss the cross.Isabel de Madariaga, Ivan the Terrible, page 183 Led by Malyuta Skuratov, the Oprichniki routinely tortured and executed whomever the Tsar suspected of treason, including boyars, merchants, clergymen, commoners, and even entire cities. The memoirs of Heinrich von Staden, provide a detailed description of both the Tsar's motivations and the inner workings of the Oprichniki. The most famous victims of the Oprichniki remains Kyr Philip Kolychev, the Metropolitan bishop of Moscow. The Metropolitan gave a sermon in the Tsar's presence in which he rebuked Ivan for terrorizing and murdering large numbers of innocent people and their families. Enraged, Tsar Ivan convened a Church council which declared Metropolitan Philip defrocked and imprisoned in a monastery for delinquent clergy. Years later, Tsar Ivan sent an emissary demanding Metropolitan Philip's blessing on his plans for the Novgorod massacre. Metropolitan Philip said, \\"Only the good are blessed.\\" Enraged, Tsar Ivan sent Skuratov to personally strangle the Metropolitan in his monastic cell. Metropolitan Philip was subsequently glorified as a Saint by the Russian Orthodox Church. In later centuries, Russian Tsars would declare a state of emergency and use death squad tactics in order to suppress domestic uprisings like Pugachev's Rebellion and the Russian Revolution of 1905. During the latter, Tsar Nicholas II of Russia ordered the Imperial Russian Army to ally itself with the Black Hundreds, an ultra-nationalist paramilitary group. Those captured in arms against the Tsar's forces were tried by military tribunals before being hanged or shot. According to Simon Sebag Montefiore, being caught wearing similar clothing to Anti-Tsarist militias was often enough for court martial followed by execution. These tactics were continued by the anti-communist White Movement during the Russian Civil War (1917-1920). Opponents of the House of Romanov also carried out targeted killings of those deemed as enemies of Socialism, which was referred to as individual terror. Among them were the People's Will, the Bolshevik Battle Squad, and the Combat Brigade of the Socialist Revolutionary Party. Among the victims of Marxist death squads were Tsar Alexander II of Russia, the Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia, and the Georgian language poet and publisher Ilia Chavchavadze. These tactics were drastically accelerated following the October Revolution. ;Soviet Union''' Following the Bolshevik Revolution, the former Russian Empire spent 73 years as a one party state ruled by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Especially between 1917 and 1953, the CPSU routinely ordered the abduction, torture, and execution of massive numbers of real and suspected anti-communists. Those with upper class origins were routinely targeted in this way during the early years of the Soviet Union. Most of the repression was committed by the regular forces of the state, like the army and the police, but there were also many cases of clandestine and covert operations. During the interwar period, the NKVD routinely targeted anti-Stalinists in the West for abduction or murder. Among them were the CPSU's former Commissar of War, Leon Trotsky, who was assassinated in Mexico City on 21 August 1940 by NKVD officer Ramon Mercador. Furthermore, former White Army Generals Alexander Kutepov and Evgeny Miller were abducted in Paris by the NKVD. Kutepov is alleged to have had a heart attack before he could be smuggled back to Moscow, and shot. General Miller was not so fortunate and died in Moscow's Lubianka Prison. Yevhen Konovalets, the founder of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists, was blown to bits by NKVD officer Pavel Sudoplatov in Rotterdam on 23 May 1938. In the post-war period, the Russian Orthodox Church collaborated with the Soviet State in a campaign to eliminate Eastern Rite Catholicism in the newly annexed regions of Soviet-ruled Ukraine.Rev. Christopher Zugger, Finding a Hidden Church, Eastern Christian Publications, 2009. Priests and laity who refused to convert to Orthodoxy were either assassinated or deported to the GULAGs in Karaganda.Finding a Hidden Church, pages 33‚Äì212. On 27 October 1947, the NKVD staged a car accident in order to assassinate the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Bishop Theodore Romzha of Mukachevo.Finding a Hidden Church, pages 78‚Äì82. When the \\"accident\\" failed to kill the Bishop, the NKVD poisoned him in his hospital bed on 1 November 1947.Finding a Hidden Church, page 82-86. Even in the post-Stalin era, the Soviet secret police continued to assassinate anti- communists in the West. Two of the most notable victims were Lev Rebet and Stepan Bandera, Ukrainian nationalists who were assassinated by the KGB in Munich, West Germany. Both deaths were believed to be accidental until 1961, when their murderer, Bohdan Stashynsky, defected to the West with his wife and voluntarily surrendered to West German authorities. ;Russian Federation''' The Russian military has been accused of using death squads against Chechen insurgents. After defecting to the United States in October, 2000, Sergei Tretyakov, an SVR agent, accused the Government of the Russian Federation of following Soviet-era practices by routinely assassinating its critics abroad.  Spain  Prior to World War II, Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union fought a war by proxy during the Spanish Civil War. There were death squads used by both the Falangists and Republicans during this conflict. Prominent victims of the era's death squad violence include the poet Federico Garc√≠a Lorca, Jos√© Robles, and journalist Ramiro Ledesma Ramos. (see also Martyrs of the Spanish Civil War). The Republican death squads were heavily staffed by members of Joseph Stalin's OGPU and targeted members of the Catholic clergy and the Spanish nobility for assassination (see Red Terror). According to author Donald Rayfield, > Stalin, Yezhov, and Beria distrusted Soviet participants in the Spanish war. > Military advisors like Vladimir Antonov-Ovseenko, journalists like Koltsov > were open to infection by the heresies, especially Trotsky's, prevalent > among the Republic's supporters. NKVD agents sent to Spain were therefore > keener on abducting and murdering anti-Stalinists among Republican leaders > and International Brigade commanders than on fighting Franco. The defeat of > the Republic, in Stalin's eyes, was caused not by the NKVD's diversionary > efforts, but by the treachery of the heretics.Donald Rayfield, Stalin and > his Hangmen: The Tyrant and Those Who Killed for Him, Random House, 2004. > Pages 362‚Äì363. John Dos Passos later wrote, > I have come to think, especially since my trip to Spain, that civil > liberties must be protected at every stage. In Spain I am sure that the > introduction of GPU methods by the Communists did as much harm as their tank > men, pilots and experienced military men did good.

The ranks of the Republican assassination squads included Erich Mielke, the future head of the East German Ministry of State Security. Walter Janka, a veteran of the Republican forces who remembers him described Mielke's career as follows, > While I was fighting at the front, shooting at the Fascists, Mielke served > in the rear, shooting Trotskyites and Anarchists.John Koehler, \\"The Stasi\\", > page 48. In the modern era, death squads, including the Batall√≥n Vasco Espa√±ol, Triple A, Grupos Antiterroristas de Liberaci√≥n (GAL) were illegally set up by officials within the Spanish government to fight ETA. They were active from 1975 until 1987, operating under Spanish Socialist Workers' Party cabinets from 1982.  United Kingdom  During the Troubles in Northern Ireland accusations of collusion between the British state and Loyalist terror groups have been longstanding, with several army units implicated in accusations of collusion. The Military Reaction Force (MRF) was a covert intelligence- gathering unit of the British Army active in Northern Ireland during the Troubles, a former member described it as a \\"legalised death squad\\". Another former MRF soldier said: \\"If you had a player who was a well-known shooter who carried out quite a lot of assassinations... then he had to be taken out. \\"[They were] killers themselves, and they had no mercy for anybody.\\" During the 30 years of The Troubles in Northern Ireland, the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) have also been accused of operating such squads. Suspected informers were dealt with by the IRA's Internal Security Unit, which carried out an investigation and interrogated the suspects. Following this a court martial would take place, with any death sentence needing to be ratified by the IRA Army Council.  Yugoslavia  The Srebrenica Massacre, also known as the Srebrenica Genocide, was the July 1995 killing of an estimated 8,000 Bosniak men and boys, as well as the ethnic cleansing of 1,000‚Äì2,000 refugees in the area of Srebrenica in Bosnia and Herzegovina, by units of the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS) under the command of General Ratko Mladiƒá during the Bosnian War. In addition to the VRS, a paramilitary unit from Serbia known as the Scorpions participated in the massacre. In Potoƒçari, some of the executions were carried out at night under arc lights, and industrial bulldozers then pushed the bodies into mass graves.Graham Jones. Srebrenica: A Triumph of Evil, CNN 3 May 2006 According to evidence collected from Bosniaks by French policeman Jean-Ren√© Ruez, some were buried alive; he also heard testimony describing Serb forces killing and torturing refugees at will, streets littered with corpses, people committing suicide to avoid having their noses, lips and ears chopped off, and adults being forced to watch the soldiers kill their children. In 2004, in a unanimous ruling on the \\"Prosecutor v. Krstiƒá\\" case, the Appeals Chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) located in The Hague ruled that the Srebrenica massacre was genocide. = Middle East =  Egypt  The Iron Guard of Egypt was a pro-palace political movement or a secret palace organization which assassinated Farouk of Egypt's enemies or a secret unit with a licence to kill, which was believed to personally take orders from Farouk. It was involved in several deadly incidents.  Iran  Under the reign of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi (1941‚Äì1979) the SAVAK (Security and Intelligence Service) was founded. During the 1960s and 70s, it was accused of using death squads. After the Islamic Revolution overthrew the Shah, Amnesty International continued to complain of human rights abuses in Iran.Abrahamian, Ervand, Tortured Confessions, (1999) Suspected foes of the Ayatollah Khomeini, were imprisoned, tortured, tried by kangaroo courts, and executed. The most famous victim of the era's death squad violence remains Amir-Abbas Hoveida, a Prime Minister of Iran under the Shah. However, the same treatment was also meted out to senior officers in the Iranian military. Other cases exist of Iranians opposed to the Islamic Republic who have been tracked down and murdered abroad. One of the most notorious examples of this remains the 1992 Mykonos restaurant assassinations in Berlin, Germany. The Iranian government's victims include civilians who have been killed by \\"death squads\\" that operate under the control of government agents but these killing operations have been denied by the Iranian government. This was particularly the case during the 1990s when more than 80 writers, translators, poets, political activists, and ordinary citizens who had been critical of the government in some way, disappeared or were found murdered.Elaine Sciolino, Persian Mirrors: the Elusive Face of Iran, Free Press, 2000, p.241 In 1983 the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) gave one of the leaders of Iran Khomeini information on Communist KGB agents in Iran. This information was almost certainly used. Later, The Iranian regime occasionally used death squads throughout the 1970s, 80s, and 90s. However, by the 2000s, it seems to have almost if not entirely ceased its operations. This partial Westernization of the country can be seen as paralleling similar events in Lebanon, the United Arab Emirates, and Northern Iraq beginning in the late 1990s.  Iraq  Iraq was formed by the British from three provinces of the Ottoman Empire following the empire's breakup after World War I. Its population is overwhelmingly Muslim but is divided into Shiites and Sunnis, with a Kurdish minority in the north. The new state leadership in the capital of Baghdad was formerly composed of, for the most part, the old Sunni Arab elite. After Saddam Hussein was overthrown by the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, the secular socialist Baathist leadership were replaced with a provisional and later constitutional government that included leadership roles for the Shia and Kurds. This paralleled the development of ethnic militias by the Shia, Sunni, and the Kurdish Peshmerga. During the course of the Iraq War the country has increasingly become divided into three zones: a Kurdish ethnic zone to the north, a Sunni center and the Shia ethnic zone to the south. While all three groups have operated death squads, in the national capital of Baghdad some members of the now Shia police department and army formed unofficial, unsanctioned, but long tolerated death squads. They possibly have links to the Interior Ministry and are popularly known as the 'black crows'. These groups operated either by night or by day. They usually arrested people, then either tortured or killed them. The victims of these attacks were predominantly young males who had probably been suspected of being members of the Sunni insurgency. Agitators such as Abdul Razaq al-Na'as, Dr. Abdullateef al-Mayah, and Dr. Wissam Al-Hashimi have also been killed. Women and children have also been arrested or killed. Some of these killings have also been simple robberies or other criminal activities. A feature in a May 2005 issue of the magazine of The New York Times accused the U.S. military of modelling the \\"Wolf Brigade\\", the Iraqi interior ministry police commandos, on the death squads that were used in the 1980s to crush the Marxist insurgency in El Salvador. In 2004, the US dispatched James Steele as an envoy and special training adviser to the Iraqi Special Police Commandos who were later accused of torture and death squad activities. Steele had served in El Salvador in the 1980s, where he helped train government units involved in human rights violations death squads in their war against the FMLNF.  Lebanon  Death squads were active during the civil war from 1975 to 1990. The number of people who disappeared during the conflict is put around 17,000.  Saudi Arabia   Turkey  Grey Wolves (organization) was established by Colonel Alparslan T√ºrke≈ü in the 1960s, it was the main nationalist force during the political violence in 1976‚Äì80 in Turkey. During this period, the organization became a \\"death squad\\" engaged in \\"street killings and gunbattles\\". According to authorities, 220 of its members carried out 694 murders of left-wing and liberal activists and intellectuals. Attacks on university students were commonplace. They killed hundreds of Alevis in the Mara≈ü massacre of 1978 and are alleged to have been behind the Taksim Square massacre of 1977. The masterminds behind the attempt on Pope John Paul II's life in 1981 by Grey Wolves member Mehmet Ali Aƒüca were not identified and the organization's role remains unclear.

It is on the north bank of the Boulder River between Butte and Helena, slightly east of the Continental Divide, at the intersection of Interstate 15 and Montana Highway 69\\\\. The population was 1,183 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Helena Micropolitan Statistical Area. Established in the 19th century as a stagecoach station, Boulder grew into a regional trading center for farmers, ranchers, and miners and, by the end of that century, home to state schools for the deaf, blind and developmentally disabled. In the 21st century, it is the center of government in Jefferson County, and institutions based in the town offer services for disabled adults and troubled youths. Its library system serves about 10,000 people, and its high school district covers more than . Three buildings in Boulder are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History Named for the many large boulders in the vicinity, the town of Boulder Valley was established in the early 1860s as a stagecoach station on the route between Fort Benton and Virginia City. It later became a trading center for nearby agricultural areas and the Elkhorn, Comet, and Baltimore mining districts. The Great Northern Railway branch line from Helena to Butte reached Boulder in 1888. State schools for the deaf, blind, and developmentally disabled were established in the city in 1892. In 1897, the town's name was shortened to Boulder. Geography and geology Boulder as seen from near Interstate 15 Boulder lies at an elevation of above sea level along Interstate 15 at its intersection with Montana Highway 69, approximately north of Butte, and south of Helena. The town is on the north bank of the Boulder River, a tributary of the Jefferson River. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. In the late Cretaceous Period (roughly 81 to 74 million years ago), molten rock (magma) rose to the Earth's surface in and near what later became Jefferson County and eventually formed an intrusive body of granitic rock up to thick and in diameter. This body, known as the Boulder Batholith, extends from Helena to Butte, and is the host rock for the many valuable ores mined in the region. As the granite cooled, it cracked, and hot solutions filled the cracks and formed mineral veins bearing gold and other metals. Millions of years later, weathering allowed gold in the veins to wash down to the gravels in the Boulder River valley. The Boulder mining district was essentially limited to placer mining of those gravels, because the source lodes were in other mining districts in the mountains.

Philosophy of physics can be broadly lumped into three areas: * interpretations of quantum mechanics: mainly concerning issues with how to formulate an adequate response to the measurement problem and understand what the theory says about reality * the nature of space and time: Are space and time substances, or purely relational? Is simultaneity conventional or only relative? Is temporal asymmetry purely reducible to thermodynamic asymmetry? * inter-theoretic relations: the relationship between various physical theories, such as thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. This overlaps with the issue of scientific reduction. Philosophy of space and time The existence and nature of space and time (or space-time) are central topics in the philosophy of physics. =Time= Time, in many philosophies, is seen as change. Time is often thought to be a fundamental quantity (that is, a quantity which cannot be defined in terms of other quantities), because time seems like a fundamentally basic concept, such that one cannot define it in terms of anything simpler. However, certain theories such as loop quantum gravity claim that spacetime is emergent. As Carlo Rovelli, one of the founders of loop quantum gravity has said: \\"No more fields on spacetime: just fields on fields\\".Rovelli, C. (2004). Quantum Gravity. Cambridge Monographs on Mathematical Physics. p. 71. Time is defined via measurement‚Äîby its standard time interval. Currently, the standard time interval (called \\"conventional second\\", or simply \\"second\\") is defined as 9,192,631,770 oscillations of a hyperfine transition in the 133 caesium atom. (ISO 31-1). What time is and how it works follows from the above definition. Time then can be combined mathematically with the fundamental quantities of space and mass to define concepts such as velocity, momentum, energy, and fields.

(hardcover), 0-09-944068-7 (paperback). as well as most people up until the 20th century, thought that time was the same for everyone everywhere. The modern conception of time is based on Einstein's theory of relativity and Minkowski's spacetime, in which rates of time run differently in different inertial frames of reference, and space and time are merged into spacetime. Time may be quantized, with the theoretical smallest time being on the order of the Planck time. Einstein's general relativity as well as the redshift of the light from receding distant galaxies indicate that the entire Universe and possibly space-time itself began about 13.8 billion years ago in the Big Bang. Einstein's theory of special relativity mostly (though not universally) made theories of time where there is something metaphysically special about the present seem much less plausible, as the reference-frame-dependence of time seems to not allow the idea of a privileged present moment. =Time travel= Some theories, most notably special and general relativity, suggest that suitable geometries of spacetime, or certain types of motion in space, may allow time travel into the past and future. Concepts that aid such understanding include the closed timelike curve. Albert Einstein's special theory of relativity (and, by extension, the general theory) predicts time dilation that could be interpreted as time travel. The theory states that, relative to a stationary observer, time appears to pass more slowly for faster-moving bodies: for example, a moving clock will appear to run slow; as a clock approaches the speed of light its hands will appear to nearly stop moving. The effects of this sort of time dilation are discussed further in the popular \\"twin paradox\\". These results are experimentally observable and affect the operation of GPS satellites and other high-tech systems used in daily life. A second, similar type of time travel is permitted by general relativity. In this type a distant observer sees time passing more slowly for a clock at the bottom of a deep gravity well, and a clock lowered into a deep gravity well and pulled back up will indicate that less time has passed compared to a stationary clock that stayed with the distant observer. Many in the scientific community believe that backward time travel is highly unlikely, because it violates causality Extract of page 32 i.e. the logic of cause and effect. For example, what happens if you attempt to go back in time and kill yourself at an earlier stage in your life (or your grandfather, which leads to the grandfather paradox)? Stephen Hawking once suggested that the absence of tourists from the future constitutes a strong argument against the existence of time travel a variant of the Fermi paradox, with time travelers instead of alien visitors. =Space= Space is one of the few fundamental quantities in physics, meaning that it cannot be defined via other quantities because there is nothing more fundamental known at present. Thus, similar to the definition of other fundamental quantities (like time and mass), space is defined via measurement. Currently, the standard space interval, called a standard metre or simply metre, is defined as the distance traveled by light in a vacuum during a time interval of 1/299792458 of a second (exact). In classical physics, space is a three-dimensional Euclidean space where any position can be described using three coordinates and parameterised by time. Special and general relativity use four-dimensional spacetime rather than three-dimensional space; and currently there are many speculative theories which use more than four spatial dimensions. Philosophy of quantum mechanics Quantum mechanics is a large focus of contemporary philosophy of physics, specifically concerning the correct interpretation of quantum mechanics. Very broadly, much of the philosophical work that is done in quantum theory is trying to make sense of superposition states: the property that particles seem to not just be in one determinate position at one time, but are somewhere 'here', and also 'there' at the same time. Such a radical view turns many common sense metaphysical ideas on their head. Much of contemporary philosophy of quantum mechanics aims to make sense of what the very empirically successful formalism of quantum mechanics tells us about the physical world. =The Everett interpretation= The Everett, or many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics claims that the wave-function of a quantum system is telling us claims about the reality of that physical system. It denies wavefunction collapse, and claims that superposition states should be interpreted literally as describing the reality of many-worlds where objects are located, and not simply indicating the indeterminacy of those variables. This is sometimes argued as a corollary of scientific realism,David Wallace, 'The Emergent Multiverse', pp. 1‚Äì10 which states that scientific theories aim to give us literally true descriptions of the world. One issue for the Everett interpretation is the role that probability plays on this account. The Everettian account is completely deterministic, whereas probability seems to play an ineliminable role in quantum mechanics.David Wallace, 'The Emergent Multiverse', pp. 113‚Äì117 Contemporary Everettians have argued that one can get an account of probability that follows the Born Rule through certain decision- theoretic proofs.David Wallace, 'The Emergent Multiverse', pg. 157‚Äì189 Physicist Roland Omn√©s noted that it is impossible to experimentally differentiate between Everett's view, which says that as the wave-function decoheres into distinct worlds, each of which exists equally, and the more traditional view that says that a decoherent wave-function leaves only one unique real result. Hence, the dispute between the two views represents a great \\"chasm.\\" \\"Every characteristic of reality has reappeared in its reconstruction by our theoretical model; every feature except one: the uniqueness of facts.\\" =Uncertainty principle= The uncertainty principle is a mathematical relation asserting an upper limit to the accuracy of the simultaneous measurement of any pair of conjugate variables, e.g. position and momentum. In the formalism of operator notation, this limit is the evaluation of the commutator of the variables' corresponding operators. The uncertainty principle arose as an answer to the question: How does one measure the location of an electron around a nucleus if an electron is a wave? When quantum mechanics was developed, it was seen to be a relation between the classical and quantum descriptions of a system using wave mechanics. In March 1927, working in Niels Bohr's institute, Werner Heisenberg formulated the principle of uncertainty thereby laying the foundation of what became known as the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. Heisenberg had been studying the papers of Paul Dirac and Pascual Jordan. He discovered a problem with measurement of basic variables in the equations. His analysis showed that uncertainties, or imprecisions, always turned up if one tried to measure the position and the momentum of a particle at the same time. Heisenberg concluded that these uncertainties or imprecisions in the measurements were not the fault of the experimenter, but fundamental in nature and are inherent mathematical properties of operators in quantum mechanics arising from definitions of these operators.Niels Bohr, Atomic Physics and Human Knowledge, p. 38 The term Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics was often used interchangeably with and as a synonym for Heisenberg's uncertainty principle by detractors (such as Einstein and the physicist Alfred Land√©) who believed in determinism and saw the common features of the Bohr‚ÄìHeisenberg theories as a threat. Within the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics the uncertainty principle was taken to mean that on an elementary level, the physical universe does not exist in a deterministic form, but rather as a collection of probabilities, or possible outcomes. For example, the pattern (probability distribution) produced by millions of photons passing through a diffraction slit can be calculated using quantum mechanics, but the exact path of each photon cannot be predicted by any known method. The Copenhagen interpretation holds that it cannot be predicted by any method, not even with theoretically infinitely precise measurements. History of the philosophy of physics =Aristotelian physics= Aristotelian physics viewed the universe as a sphere with a center. Matter, composed of the classical elements, earth, water, air, and fire, sought to go down towards the center of the universe, the center of the earth, or up, away from it. Things in the aether such as the moon, the sun, planets, or stars circled the center of the universe.Tim Maudlin (2012-07-22). Philosophy of Physics: Space and Time: Space and Time (Princeton Foundations of Contemporary Philosophy) (p. 3). Princeton University Press. Kindle Edition.\\"Because it is a sphere, Aristotle's universe contains a geometrically privileged center, and Aristotle makes reference to that center in characterizing the natural motions of different sorts of matter. ‚ÄúUpward,‚Äù‚Äúdownward,‚Äù and ‚Äúuniform circular motion‚Äù all are defined in terms of the center of the universe.\\" Movement is defined as change in place, i.e. space.Tim Maudlin (2012-07-22). Philosophy of Physics: Space and Time: Space and Time (Princeton Foundations of Contemporary Philosophy) (p. 4). Princeton University Press. Kindle Edition. \\"Aristotle adopts the concept of space, and the correlative concept of motion, that we all intuitively employ.\\" =Newtonian physics= The implicit axioms of Aristotelian physics with respect to movement of matter in space were superseded in Newtonian physics by Newton's First Law of Motion.Tim Maudlin (2012-07-22). Philosophy of Physics: Space and Time: Space and Time (Princeton Foundations of Contemporary Philosophy) (pp. 4‚Äì5). Princeton University Press. Kindle Edition. \\"Newtonian physics is implicit in his First Law of Motion: Law I : Every body perseveres in its state either of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line, except insofar as it is compelled to change its state by impressed forces. 1 This single law smashes the Aristotelian universe to smithereens.\\" \\"Every body\\" includes the Moon, and an apple; and includes all types of matter, air as well as water, stones, or even a flame. Nothing has a natural or inherent motion.Tim Maudlin (2012-07-22). Philosophy of Physics: Space and Time: Space and Time (Princeton Foundations of Contemporary Philosophy) (pp. 5). Princeton University Press. Kindle Edition. Absolute space being three-dimensional Euclidean space, infinite and without a center. Being \\"at rest\\" means being at the same place in absolute space over time.Tim Maudlin (2012-07-22). Philosophy of Physics: Space and Time: Space and Time (Princeton Foundations of Contemporary Philosophy) (pp. 9‚Äì10). Princeton University Press. Kindle Edition. \\"Newton believed in the existence of a spatial arena with the geometrical structure of E. He believed that this infinite three-dimensional space exists at every moment of time. And he also believed something much more subtle and controversial, namely, that identically the same points of space persist through time.\\" The topology and affine structure of space must permit movement in a straight line at a uniform velocity; thus both space and time must have definite, stable dimensions.Tim Maudlin (2012-07-22). Philosophy of Physics: Space and Time: Space and Time (Princeton Foundations of Contemporary Philosophy) (p. 12). Princeton University Press. Kindle Edition. \\"...space must have a topology, an affine structure, and a metric; time must be one- dimensional with a topology and a metric; and, most importantly, the individual parts of space must persist through time. =Leibniz= Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, 1646 ‚Äì 1716, was a contemporary of Newton. He contributed a fair amount to the statics and dynamics emerging around him, often disagreeing with Descartes and Newton. He devised a new theory of motion (dynamics) based on kinetic energy and potential energy, which posited space as relative, whereas Newton was thoroughly convinced that space was absolute. An important example of Leibniz's mature physical thinking is his Specimen Dynamicum of 1695.Ariew and Garber 117, Loemker ¬ß46, W II.5. On Leibniz and physics, see the chapter by Garber in Jolley (1995) and Wilson (1989). Until the discovery of subatomic particles and the quantum mechanics governing them, many of Leibniz's speculative ideas about aspects of nature not reducible to statics and dynamics made little sense. For instance, he anticipated Albert Einstein by arguing, against Newton, that space, time and motion are relative, not absolute: \\"As for my own opinion, I have said more than once, that I hold space to be something merely relative, as time is, that I hold it to be an order of coexistences, as time is an order of successions.\\"See H. G. Alexander, ed., The Leibniz-Clarke Correspondence, Manchester: Manchester University Press, pp. 25‚Äì26. =Quotes from Einstein's work on the importance of the philosophy of physics= Einstein was interested in the philosophical implications of his theory. Albert Einstein was extremely interested in the philosophical conclusions of his work. He writes: > \\"I fully agree with you about the significance and educational value of > methodology as well as history and philosophy of science. So many people > today‚Äîand even professional scientists‚Äîseem to me like somebody who has seen > thousands of trees but has never seen a forest.

In 2005, he admitted responsibility for five additional homicides across the river, at trial in Kansas City, Missouri, in a deal to receive multiple life sentences without possibility of parole and avoid more death sentences. Investigators fear that there might be other undiscovered victims as well, in both cities and elsewhere. As of 2019, with eight murder convictions across both states, Robinson remains on death row in Kansas. Because he made contact with most of his post-1993 victims via on-line chat rooms, he is sometimes referred to as \\"the Internet's first serial killer\\". Early life Robinson was born in Cicero, Illinois, the third of five children of an alcoholic father and a disciplinarian mother. In 1957, he became an Eagle Scout, and reportedly traveled to London with a group of Scouts who performed before Queen Elizabeth II. Later that year he enrolled at Quigley Preparatory Seminary in Chicago, a private boys' school for aspiring priests, but dropped out after one year due to disciplinary issues. In 1961, he enrolled at Morton Junior College in Cicero to become a medical X-ray technician, but dropped out after two years. In 1964, he moved to Kansas City and married Nancy Jo Lynch, who gave birth to their first child, John Jr., in 1965, followed by a daughter, Kimberly, in 1967, and twins Christopher and Christine in 1971. Early crimes Robinson was arrested for the first time in Kansas City in 1969, after embezzling $33,000 from the medical practice of Dr. Wallace Graham, where he had secured a job as an X-ray technician using forged credentials. He was sentenced to three years' probation. In 1970, Robinson violated probation by moving back to Chicago without his probation officer's permission, and took a job as an insurance salesman at the R.B. Jones Company. In 1971, he was arrested again for embezzling firm funds, and ordered back to Kansas City where his probation was extended. In 1975, it was extended again after another arrest, this time on charges of securities fraud and mail fraud in connection with a phony \\"medical consulting\\" company he had formed in Kansas City. During this period, Robinson cultivated and maintained the outward appearance of a community-minded citizen and family man; he became a Scoutmaster, a baseball coach and a Sunday school teacher. In 1977, he talked his way onto the board of directors of a local charitable organization and forged a series of letters from its executive director to the mayor of Kansas City, and from the mayor to other civic leaders, commending his generous volunteer efforts and generally singing his praises. Eventually, he had himself named the organization's Man of the Year, and threw a festive awards luncheon in his own honor. In 1979, Robinson completed probation. In 1980, he was arrested again on multiple charges including embezzlement and check forgery, for which he served 60 days in jail in 1982. After his release, he formed a bogus hydroponics business and swindled $25,000 from a friend, to whom he promised a fast investment return so that he could pay for his dying wife's health care. At this time, he reportedly began sexually propositioning his neighbors' wives, resulting in a fistfight with one of the husbands. He also claimed to have joined a secret sadomasochism cult called the International Council of Masters, and to have become its \\"Slavemaster\\", whose duties included luring victims to gatherings to be tortured and raped by cult members. Murders begin In 1984, having started two more fraudulent shell companies (Equi-Plus and Equi-2), Robinson hired Paula Godfrey, 19, ostensibly to work as a sales representative. Godfrey told friends and family that Robinson was sending her away for training. After hearing nothing further from her, Godfrey's parents filed a missing persons report. Police questioned Robinson, who denied any knowledge of her whereabouts. Several days later her parents received a typewritten letter, with Godfrey's signature at the bottom, thanking Robinson for his help and asserting that she was \\"OK\\" and did not want to see her family. The investigation was terminated, as Godfrey was of legal age and there was no evidence of wrongdoing. No trace of Godfrey has ever been found. In 1985, using the name John Osborne, he met Lisa Stasi and her four-month-old daughter, Tiffany, at a battered women's shelter in Kansas City. He promised Stasi a job in Chicago, an apartment, and daycare for her baby, and asked her to sign several sheets of blank stationery. A few days later, Robinson contacted his brother and sister-in-law, who had been unable to adopt a baby through traditional channels, and informed them that he knew of a baby whose mother had committed suicide. For $5,500 in \\"legal fees\\", Don and Helen Robinson received Tiffany (whose identity was confirmed by DNA testing in 2000) and a set of authentic-appearing adoption papers with the forged signatures of two lawyers and a judge. Stasi was never heard from again. In 1987, Catherine Clampitt, 27, left her child with her parents in Wichita Falls, Texas and moved to Kansas City to find employment. She was hired by Robinson, who reportedly promised her extensive travel and a new wardrobe. She vanished in June of that year. Her missing persons case remains open. From 1987 to 1993, Robinson was incarcerated, first in Kansas (1987‚Äì1991) on multiple fraud convictions and thereafter in Missouri for another fraud conviction and parole violations. At Western Missouri Correctional Facility, he met 49-year-old Beverly Bonner, the prison librarian, who upon his release left her husband, a prison doctor, and moved to Kansas to work for him. After Robinson arranged for Bonner's alimony checks to be forwarded to a Kansas post office box, her family never heard from her again. For several years, Bonner's mother continued forwarding her alimony checks, and Robinson continued cashing them. By then, Robinson had discovered the Internet, and roamed various social networking sites using the name \\"Slavemaster\\", looking for women who enjoyed playing the submissive partner role during sex. An early online correspondent was Sheila Faith, 45, whose 15-year-old daughter Debbie was wheelchair-bound due to spina bifida. Robinson, portraying himself as a wealthy businessman and philanthropist, offered to pay Debbie's medical expenses and give Sheila a job. In 1994, the mother and daughter moved from Fullerton, California to Kansas City and immediately disappeared. Robinson cashed Faith's pension checks for the next seven years. Gradually, Robinson became well known in the increasingly popular BDSM online chat rooms. In 1999, he offered a job and a bondage relationship to Izabela Lewicka, a 21-year-old Polish immigrant living in Indiana. When she moved to Kansas City, Robinson (who was still married to Nancy) gave Lewicka an engagement ring and brought her to the county registrar, where they paid for a marriage license that was never picked up. It is unclear whether Lewicka believed that she and Robinson were married; she told her parents she had married, but never told them her husband's name. She did sign a 115-item slave contract that gave Robinson almost total control over every aspect of her life, including her bank accounts. Some time during the summer of 1999, she disappeared. Robinson told a web designer he employed that she had been caught smoking marijuana and deported. Around the time of Lewicka's disappearance, a licensed practical nurse named Suzette Trouten moved from Michigan to Kansas to travel the world with Robinson as his submissive sex slave. Trouten's mother received several typed letters signed by her daughter and purportedly mailed while the couple was abroad, although the envelopes all bore Kansas City postmarks. The letters were, her mother said, uncharacteristically mistake-free. Later, Robinson told Trouten's mother that she had run off with an acquaintance after stealing money from him. Arrest Over time, Robinson became increasingly careless, and did a progressively poorer job of covering his tracks. By 1999, he had attracted the attention of authorities in both Kansas and Missouri as his name popped up in more and more missing persons investigations. Robinson was arrested in June 2000, at his farm near La Cygne, Kansas, after a woman filed a sexual battery complaint against him and another charged him with stealing her sex toys. The theft charge, in particular, finally gave investigators the probable cause they needed to obtain search warrants. On the farm, a task force found the decaying bodies of two women, later identified as Lewicka and Trouten, in two 85-pound chemical drums. Across the state line in Missouri, other members of the task force, searching a storage facility where Robinson rented two garages, found three similar chemical drums containing corpses subsequently identified as Bonner, Faith, and her daughter. All five women were killed in the same way, by one or more blows to the head with a blunt instrument. Conviction In 2002, Robinson stood trial in Kansas for the murders of Trouten, Lewicka and Stasi, along with multiple lesser charges. After the longest criminal trial in Kansas history,\\"Death sentence is upheld for serial killer John E. Robinson Sr.\\". The Kansas City Star (November 6, 2015), retrieved March 13, 2017. he was convicted on all counts; he received the death sentence for the murders of Trouten and Lewicka, and life imprisonment for Stasi's (because she was killed before Kansas reinstated the death penalty). He also received a five- to-20-year prison sentence for \\"interfering with the parental custody\\" of Stasi's baby, 20¬Ω years for kidnapping Trouten, and seven months for theft. After his Kansas convictions, Robinson faced additional murder charges in Missouri, based on the evidence discovered in that state. Missouri is far more aggressive in its pursuit of capital punishment convictions (Kansas has not executed anyone since reinstating its death penalty statute in 1994), and Robinson's attorneys were anxious to avoid a trial there. Chris Koster, the Missouri prosecutor, insisted as a condition of any plea bargain that Robinson lead authorities to the bodies of Stasi, Godfrey and Clampitt. Robinson, who has never cooperated in any way with investigators, refused, but Koster still faced pressure to make a deal because his case was not technically airtight‚Å† ‚Å†‚Äî among other issues, there was no unequivocal evidence that any of the murders had actually been committed within his jurisdiction. Robinson, on the other hand, faced pressure to plead guilty to avoid an almost certain death sentence in Missouri, and failing that, yet another capital murder trial back in Kansas. When it became clear that the women's remains would never be found without Robinson's cooperation, a compromise of sorts was reached: In a carefully scripted plea in October 2003, Robinson acknowledged that Koster had enough evidence to convict him of capital murder for the deaths of Godfrey, Clampitt, Bonner and the Faiths. Though his statement was technically a guilty plea, and was accepted as such by the Missouri court, observers remarked that it was notably devoid of any contrition or specific acceptance of responsibility. He received a life sentence without possibility of parole for each of the five murders. In November 2015, the Kansas Supreme Court vacated the Trouten and Stasi murder convictions on technicalities, but upheld the Lewicka conviction and its accompanying death sentence. The ruling marked the first time that Kansas's highest court has upheld a death sentence since reinstatement of capital punishment there in 1994. Robinson currently remains on death row at the El Dorado Correctional Facility in Kansas. Aftermath In 2005, Nancy Robinson filed for divorce after 41 years of marriage, citing incompatibility and irreconcilable differences. In 2006, Stasi's daughter‚Äîknown since her (faked) adoption as Heather Robinson‚Äîfiled a civil suit against Truman Medical Center in Kansas City and social worker Karen Gaddis. The suit accused Gaddis of putting Robinson in contact with Stasi and her newborn daughter in 1984, after he told Gaddis that he ran a charitable organization providing assistance to \\"unwed mothers of white babies.\\" In 2007, Heather and the hospital reached a settlement for an undisclosed sum, which Robinson said she would split with her biological grandmother, Patricia Sylvester. Heather won a second judgment, in 2007, preventing Robinson from profiting from any future potential book sales or film rights.Logan, C. (26 May 2007).

It portrays a fictional account of a nuclear crisis. The film features performances by actors Henry Fonda, Dan O'Herlihy, Walter Matthau, Frank Overton, Larry Hagman, Fritz Weaver, Dana Elcar, Dom DeLuise and Sorrell Booke. Fail Safe describes how Cold War tensions between the Soviet Union and the United States lead to an accidental thermonuclear first strike after an error sends a group of US bombers to bomb Moscow. In 2000, the novel was adapted again as a televised play starring George Clooney, Richard Dreyfuss and Noah Wyle, and broadcast live in black and white on CBS. Plot During a VIP visit to the headquarters of the Strategic Air Command (SAC), at Offutt Air Force Base in Omaha, Nebraska, the Air Force's early warning radar indicates that an unidentified aircraft has intruded into American airspace. Shortly after, the \\"intruder\\" is identified as an off-course civilian airliner and the alert is cancelled, but a computer error causes one American bomber group to receive apparently valid orders for a nuclear attack on Moscow. Attempts to rescind this order fail because a new Soviet countermeasure jams American radio communications. Unable to obtain confirmation or denial of the order, Colonel Jack Grady (Edward Binns), the US bomber group's commander, follows the order and commands his group to continue to their target. The president of the United States (Henry Fonda) and his advisers attempt to recall the bombers or shoot them down. Communications are opened with the Soviet chairman in which mistakes on both sides (the orders to the American bombers and the Soviet jamming) are acknowledged. The jamming ceases, but the crew follows their training, dismissing the subsequent counter-orders they receive as a Soviet ruse. The President struggles to find a solution that will stop the Soviet Union from counter-attacking; if he fails, a nuclear holocaust will be unavoidable. He offers to sacrifice an American target to appease the skeptical Soviets and prove that the attack was indeed an error, and he orders an American bomber towards New York City. The President's advisers in the Pentagon discover that in doing so, the President is sacrificing the First Lady, who is visiting New York City. A single American bomber reaches Moscow and destroys it. The President then orders General Black (Dan O'Herlihy), whose wife and children live in New York, to carry out a corresponding nuclear attack on that city, using the Empire State Building as ground zero. After releasing the bombs, Black kills himself. The last moments of the film show images of people in New York going about their daily lives, unaware of the coming disaster.

Except for radio background during a scene at an Air Force base in Alaska, there is no original music score (only the electronic sound effects act as the film‚Äôs main and end title music). With few exceptions, the action takes place largely in the White House underground bunker, the Pentagon war conference room, the SAC war room, and a single bomber cockpit (a \\"Vindicator bomber\\"). Shots of normal daily life are seen only after the title opening credits and in the final scene depicting an ordinary New York City day, its residents entirely unsuspecting of their imminent destruction, each scene ending with a freeze-frame shot at the moment of impact. The Soviets are not depicted in the film. The progress of the attack is followed on giant, electronic maps in the Pentagon War Room and SAC Headquarters. Conversations with the Soviet Premier (Russian language occasionally heard in the background on the \\"Hot-Line\\") are translated by an American interpreter (Larry Hagman). Suspense builds through dialog between the President and other officials, including an advisor to the Department of Defense, Professor Groeteschele (Walter Matthau), an old college friend of the President, General Black (Dan O'Herlihy) and SAC commander General Bogan (Frank Overton). The character of Groeteschele was inspired, according to Lumet's audio commentary on the film, by military strategist Herman Kahn.https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2020/05/shut-in-movie-club-fail- safe-coronavirus The \\"Vindicator\\" bombers (an invention of the novelists) are sometimes represented in the film with stock footage of Convair B-58 Hustlers. Fighters sent to attack the bombers are illustrated by film clips of the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter, Convair F-102 Delta Dagger, Dassault Mirage III and McDonnell F-101 Voodoo. Stock footage was used because the United States Air Force declined to cooperate in the production, disliking the premise of a lack of control over nuclear strike forces.\\"Fail-Safe (Reviews).\\" strategypage.com. Retrieved: September 5, 2012. The scene depicting bombers taking off was stock footage of a single B-58 takeoff edited to look like several bombers taking off in succession. A nightmare quality is imparted to many of the flying sequences by depicting the planes in photographic negative. In several of the negative sequences the \\"Soviet interceptors\\" were actually French Mirage fighters with Israeli markings. Reception When Fail Safe opened in October 1964, it garnered excellent reviews, but its box office performance was poor. Its failure rested with the similarity between it and the nuclear war satire Dr. Strangelove, which had appeared in theaters first, in January 1964. Still, the film later was applauded as a Cold War thriller. The novel sold through to the 1980s and 1990s, and the film was given high marks for retaining the essence of the novel.Erickson, Hal. \\"Fail Safe (1964).\\" The New York Times. Retrieved: October 24, 2009. Over the years, both the novel and the movie were well received for their depiction of a nuclear crisis, despite many critical reviews rejecting the notion that a breakdown in communication could result in the erroneous go-command depicted in the novel and the movie. =Lawsuit= Fail Safe and Dr. Strangelove were both produced in the period after the Cuban Missile Crisis, when people became much more sensitive to the threat of nuclear war. Fail Safe so closely resembled Peter George's novel Red Alert, on which Strangelove was based, that Strangelove screenwriter/director Stanley Kubrick and George filed a copyright infringement lawsuit. The case was settled out of court. The result of the settlement was that Columbia Pictures, which had financed and was distributing Strangelove, also bought Fail Safe, which had been an independently financed production. Kubrick insisted that the studio release his movie first.Jacobson, Colin. \\"Review:Fail-Safe: Special Edition (1964).\\" dvdmg.com, 2000. Retrieved: November 21, 2010.

This is extremely useful because computations involving a diagonalizable matrix can often be reduced to much simpler computations involving the corresponding diagonal matrix. The concept of diagonalization is relatively straightforward for operators on finite-dimensional vector spaces but requires some modification for operators on infinite-dimensional spaces. In general, the spectral theorem identifies a class of linear operators that can be modeled by multiplication operators, which are as simple as one can hope to find. In more abstract language, the spectral theorem is a statement about commutative C*-algebras. See also spectral theory for a historical perspective. Examples of operators to which the spectral theorem applies are self-adjoint operators or more generally normal operators on Hilbert spaces. The spectral theorem also provides a canonical decomposition, called the spectral decomposition, eigenvalue decomposition, or eigendecomposition, of the underlying vector space on which the operator acts. Augustin-Louis Cauchy proved the spectral theorem for self-adjoint matrices, i.e., that every real, symmetric matrix is diagonalizable. In addition, Cauchy was the first to be systematic about determinants.A Short History of Operator Theory by Evans M. Harrell II The spectral theorem as generalized by John von Neumann is today perhaps the most important result of operator theory. This article mainly focuses on the simplest kind of spectral theorem, that for a self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space. However, as noted above, the spectral theorem also holds for normal operators on a Hilbert space.  Finite-dimensional case  = Hermitian maps and Hermitian matrices = We begin by considering a Hermitian matrix on \\\\mathbb{C}^n (but the following discussion will be adaptable to the more restrictive case of symmetric matrices on \\\\mathbb{R}^n). We consider a Hermitian map on a finite-dimensional complex inner product space endowed with a positive definite sesquilinear inner product \\\\langle\\\\cdot,\\\\cdot\\\\rangle. The Hermitian condition on A means that for all , : \\\\langle A x, y \\\\rangle = \\\\langle x, A y \\\\rangle. An equivalent condition is that , where is the Hermitian conjugate of . In the case that is identified with a Hermitian matrix, the matrix of can be identified with its conjugate transpose. (If is a real matrix, this is equivalent to , that is, is a symmetric matrix.) This condition implies that all eigenvalues of a Hermitian map are real: it is enough to apply it to the case when is an eigenvector. (Recall that an eigenvector of a linear map is a (non-zero) vector such that for some scalar . The value is the corresponding eigenvalue. Moreover, the eigenvalues are roots of the characteristic polynomial.) Theorem. If is Hermitian, there exists an orthonormal basis of consisting of eigenvectors of . Each eigenvalue is real. We provide a sketch of a proof for the case where the underlying field of scalars is the complex numbers. By the fundamental theorem of algebra, applied to the characteristic polynomial of , there is at least one eigenvalue and eigenvector . Then since : \\\\lambda_1 \\\\langle e_1, e_1 \\\\rangle = \\\\langle A (e_1), e_1 \\\\rangle = \\\\langle e_1, A(e_1) \\\\rangle = \\\\bar\\\\lambda_1 \\\\langle e_1, e_1 \\\\rangle, we find that is real. Now consider the space , the orthogonal complement of . By Hermiticity, is an invariant subspace of . Applying the same argument to shows that has an eigenvector . Finite induction then finishes the proof. The spectral theorem holds also for symmetric maps on finite-dimensional real inner product spaces, but the existence of an eigenvector does not follow immediately from the fundamental theorem of algebra. To prove this, consider as a Hermitian matrix and use the fact that all eigenvalues of a Hermitian matrix are real. The matrix representation of in a basis of eigenvectors is diagonal, and by the construction the proof gives a basis of mutually orthogonal eigenvectors; by choosing them to be unit vectors one obtains an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors. can be written as a linear combination of pairwise orthogonal projections, called its spectral decomposition. Let : V_\\\\lambda = \\\\\\\\{v \\\\in V: A v = \\\\lambda v\\\\\\\\} be the eigenspace corresponding to an eigenvalue . Note that the definition does not depend on any choice of specific eigenvectors. is the orthogonal direct sum of the spaces where the index ranges over eigenvalues. In other words, if denotes the orthogonal projection onto , and are the eigenvalues of , then the spectral decomposition may be written as : A = \\\\lambda_1 P_{\\\\lambda_1} + \\\\cdots + \\\\lambda_m P_{\\\\lambda_m}. If the spectral decomposition of A is A = \\\\lambda_1 P_1 + \\\\cdots + \\\\lambda_m P_m, then A^2 = (\\\\lambda_1)^2 P_1 + \\\\cdots + (\\\\lambda_m)^2 P_m and \\\\mu A = \\\\mu \\\\lambda_1 P_1 + \\\\cdots + \\\\mu \\\\lambda_m P_m for any scalar \\\\mu. It follows that for any polynomial one has : f(A) = f(\\\\lambda_1) P_1 + \\\\cdots + f(\\\\lambda_m) P_m. The spectral decomposition is a special case of both the Schur decomposition and the singular value decomposition. = Normal matrices = The spectral theorem extends to a more general class of matrices. Let be an operator on a finite-dimensional inner product space. is said to be normal if . One can show that is normal if and only if it is unitarily diagonalizable. Proof: By the Schur decomposition, we can write any matrix as , where is unitary and is upper-triangular. If is normal, one sees that . Therefore, must be diagonal since a normal upper triangular matrix is diagonal (see normal matrix). The converse is obvious. In other words, is normal if and only if there exists a unitary matrix such that : A = U D U^*, where is a diagonal matrix. Then, the entries of the diagonal of are the eigenvalues of . The column vectors of are the eigenvectors of and they are orthonormal. Unlike the Hermitian case, the entries of need not be real.  Compact self-adjoint operators  In the more general setting of Hilbert spaces, which may have an infinite dimension, the statement of the spectral theorem for compact self-adjoint operators is virtually the same as in the finite-dimensional case. Theorem. Suppose is a compact self-adjoint operator on a (real or complex) Hilbert space . Then there is an orthonormal basis of consisting of eigenvectors of . Each eigenvalue is real. As for Hermitian matrices, the key point is to prove the existence of at least one nonzero eigenvector. One cannot rely on determinants to show existence of eigenvalues, but one can use a maximization argument analogous to the variational characterization of eigenvalues. If the compactness assumption is removed, it is not true that every self-adjoint operator has eigenvectors.  Bounded self-adjoint operators  =Possible absence of eigenvectors= The next generalization we consider is that of bounded self-adjoint operators on a Hilbert space. Such operators may have no eigenvalues: for instance let be the operator of multiplication by on , that is, Section 6.1 : [A \\\\varphi](t) = t \\\\varphi(t). \\\\; Now, a physicist would say that A does have eigenvectors, namely the \\\\varphi(t)=\\\\delta(t-t_0), where \\\\delta is a Dirac delta-function. A delta-function, however, is not a normalizable function; that is, it is not actually in the Hilbert space . Thus, the delta-functions are \\"generalized eigenvectors\\" but not eigenvectors in the strict sense. =Spectral subspaces and projection-valued measures= In the absence of (true) eigenvectors, one can look for subspaces consisting of almost eigenvectors. In the above example, for example, where [A \\\\varphi](t) = t \\\\varphi(t), \\\\; we might consider the subspace of functions supported on a small interval [a,a+\\\\varepsilon] inside [0,1]. This space is invariant under A and for any \\\\varphi in this subspace, A\\\\varphi is very close to a\\\\varphi. In this approach to the spectral theorem, if A is a bounded self-adjoint operator, one looks for large families of such \\"spectral subspaces\\". Theorem 7.2.1 Each subspace, in turn, is encoded by the associated projection operator, and the collection of all the subspaces is then represented by a projection-valued measure. One formulation of the spectral theorem expresses the operator as an integral of the coordinate function over the operator's spectrum \\\\sigma(A) with respect to a projection-valued measure. Theorem 7.12 : A = \\\\int_{\\\\sigma(A)} \\\\lambda \\\\, d E_{\\\\lambda} . When the self-adjoint operator in question is compact, this version of the spectral theorem reduces to something similar to the finite- dimensional spectral theorem above, except that the operator is expressed as a finite or countably infinite linear combination of projections, that is, the measure consists only of atoms. =Multiplication operator version= An alternative formulation of the spectral theorem says that every bounded self- adjoint operator is unitarily equivalent to a multiplication operator. The significance of this result is that multiplication operators are in many ways easy to understand. Theorem. Theorem 7.20 Let be a bounded self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space . Then there is a measure space and a real-valued essentially bounded measurable function on and a unitary operator such that :: U^* T U = A, :where is the multiplication operator: :: [T \\\\varphi](x) = f(x) \\\\varphi(x). :and \\\\T\\\\ = \\\\f\\\\_\\\\infty The spectral theorem is the beginning of the vast research area of functional analysis called operator theory; see also the spectral measure. There is also an analogous spectral theorem for bounded normal operators on Hilbert spaces. The only difference in the conclusion is that now may be complex-valued. =Direct integrals= There is also a formulation of the spectral theorem in terms of direct integrals. It is similar to the multiplication-operator formulation, but more canonical. Let A be a bounded self-adjoint operator and let \\\\sigma (A) be the spectrum of A. The direct-integral formulation of the spectral theorem associates two quantities to A. First, a measure \\\\mu on \\\\sigma (A), and second, a family of Hilbert spaces \\\\\\\\{H_{\\\\lambda}\\\\\\\\},\\\\,\\\\,\\\\lambda\\\\in\\\\sigma (A). We then form the direct integral Hilbert space : \\\\int_\\\\mathbf{R}^\\\\oplus H_{\\\\lambda}\\\\, d \\\\mu(\\\\lambda). The elements of this space are functions (or \\"sections\\") s(\\\\lambda),\\\\,\\\\,\\\\lambda\\\\in\\\\sigma(A), such that s(\\\\lambda)\\\\in H_{\\\\lambda} for all \\\\lambda. The direct-integral version of the spectral theorem may be expressed as follows: Theorem 7.19 :Theorem. If A is a bounded self-adjoint operator, then A is unitarily equivalent to the \\"multiplication by \\\\lambda\\" operator on :: \\\\int_\\\\mathbf{R}^\\\\oplus H_{\\\\lambda}\\\\, d \\\\mu(\\\\lambda) for some measure \\\\mu and some family \\\\\\\\{H_{\\\\lambda}\\\\\\\\} of Hilbert spaces. The measure \\\\mu is uniquely determined by A up to measure-theoretic equivalence; that is, any two measure associated to the same A have the same sets of measure zero. The dimensions of the Hilbert spaces H_{\\\\lambda} are uniquely determined by A up to a set of \\\\mu-measure zero. The spaces H_{\\\\lambda} can be thought of as something like \\"eigenspaces\\" for A. Note, however, that unless the one-element set {\\\\lambda} has positive measure, the space H_{\\\\lambda} is not actually a subspace of the direct integral. Thus, the H_{\\\\lambda}'s should be thought of as \\"generalized eigenspace\\"‚Äîthat is, the elements of H_{\\\\lambda} are \\"eigenvectors\\" that do not actually belong to the Hilbert space. Although both the multiplication-operator and direct integral formulations of the spectral theorem express a self-adjoint operator as unitarily equivalent to a multiplication operator, the direct integral approach is more canonical. First, the set over which the direct integral takes place (the spectrum of the operator) is canonical. Second, the function we are multiplying by is canonical in the direct-integral approach: Simply the function \\\\lambda\\\\mapsto\\\\lambda. =Cyclic vectors and simple spectrum= A vector \\\\varphi is called a cyclic vector for A if the vectors \\\\varphi,A\\\\varphi,A^2\\\\varphi,\\\\ldots span a dense subspace of the Hilbert space. Suppose A is a bounded self-adjoint operator for which a cyclic vector exists. In that case, there is no distinction between the direct-integral and multiplication-operator formulations of the spectral theorem. Indeed, in that case, there is a measure \\\\mu on the spectrum \\\\sigma(A) of A such that A is unitarily equivalent to the \\"multiplication by \\\\lambda\\" operator on L^2(\\\\sigma(A),\\\\mu). Lemma 8.11 This result represents A simultaneously as a multiplication operator and as a direct integral, since L^2(\\\\sigma(A),\\\\mu) is just a direct integral in which each Hilbert space H_{\\\\lambda} is just \\\\mathbb{C}. Not every bounded self-adjoint operator admits a cyclic vector; indeed, by the uniqueness in the direct integral decomposition, this can occur only when all the H_{\\\\lambda}'s have dimension one. When this happens, we say that A has \\"simple spectrum\\" in the sense of spectral multiplicity theory. That is, a bounded self-adjoint operator that admits a cyclic vector should be thought of as the infinite-dimensional generalization of a self-adjoint matrix with distinct eigenvalues (i.e., each eigenvalue has multiplicity one). Although not every A admits a cyclic vector, it is easy to see that we can decompose the Hilbert space as a direct sum of invariant subspaces on which A has a cyclic vector. This observation is the key to the proofs of the multiplication-operator and direct-integral forms of the spectral theorem. =Functional calculus= One important application of the spectral theorem (in whatever form) is the idea of defining a functional calculus. That is, given a function f defined on the spectrum of A, we wish to define an operator f(A). If f is simply a positive power, f(x)=x^n, then f(A) is just the n\\\\mathrm{th} power of A, A^n. The interesting cases are where f is a nonpolynomial function such as a square root or an exponential. Either of the versions of the spectral theorem provides such a functional calculus.E.g., Definition 7.13 In the direct-integral version, for example, f(A) acts as the \\"multiplication by f\\" operator in the direct integral: :[f(A)s](\\\\lambda)=f(\\\\lambda)s(\\\\lambda). That is to say, each space H_{\\\\lambda} in the direct integral is a (generalized) eigenspace for f(A) with eigenvalue f(\\\\lambda).  General self-adjoint operators  Many important linear operators which occur in analysis, such as differential operators, are unbounded. There is also a spectral theorem for self-adjoint operators that applies in these cases. To give an example, every constant-coefficient differential operator is unitarily equivalent to a multiplication operator. Indeed, the unitary operator that implements this equivalence is the Fourier transform; the multiplication operator is a type of Fourier multiplier. In general, spectral theorem for self-adjoint operators may take several equivalent forms.See Section 10.1 of Notably, all of the formulations given in the previous section for bounded self-adjoint operators‚Äîthe projection- valued measure version, the multiplication-operator version, and the direct- integral version‚Äîcontinue to hold for unbounded self-adjoint operators, with small technical modifications to deal with domain issues.

The per capita income for the town was $17,310. About 7.7% of families and 11.9% of the population were below the poverty line, including 10.9% of those under age 18 and 11.7% of those age 65 or over. Economy Ennis is the center of a long-standing ranching economy in the Madison River Valley. Large cattle and sheep ranches dot the valley north and south of the town along the river. Ennis is also a major tourist attraction and angling destination for fly fisherman targeting rainbow and brown trout. The small town hosts at least three fly shops and numerous resorts that cater to fly anglers with guided fishing trips on the Madison and in nearby Yellowstone National Park. Ennis is home to Willie's Distillery, known for its bourbon and moonshine, and one of the growing number of micro- distilleries in Montana. Education Ennis has a public library, the Madison Valley Public Library. Arts and culture Ennis 4th of July parade 2014 The Ennis Chamber of Commerce has organized an annual 4th of July parade since the early 1980s. In 2014, the Chamber hosted its 79th annual Fourth of July parade. The annual parade down main street in Ennis attracts visitors from throughout the U.S. and is considered one of the best small town parades in Montana. The 4th of July celebration in Ennis includes a rodeo event at the Ennis Rodeo Grounds just west of town. For at least the last decade, the Madison River Foundation, headquartered in Ennis has sponsored an annual 'Ennis on the Madison' Fly Fishing Festival in mid August. The festival attracts anglers and fly fishing luminaries from around the U.S. Each summer, Ennis hosts three long distance runs, collectively known as the Madison Trifecta. A duathlon is held over the 4th of July weekend between Ennis and Virginia City, Montana. A full marathon, the highest elevation run (over ) in America is held in the Gravelly Range in late July. The Madison Triathlon is held in August of every year between Ennis and Harrison, Montana. In October, the Chamber of Commerce also hosts the annual Hunters Feed. It takes place the day before rifle season opens. Locals line up on Main St. and cook a wild game dish for the attendees to sample. In the past there has been elk, moose, deer, pheasant, and bob cat to try. A winner is chosen for the best chili, best non- chili dish, and most unusual dish. Ennis is also home to Montana's first combined brewery and distillery festival, Tap Into Ennis. The event occurs the third Saturday in May which coincides with the first day of fishing season on the Madison River. The Chamber hosts the event and invites Montana breweries and distilleries, artists, and local music acts. Ennis also hosts the Madison Valley Arts Festival, typically the second Saturday of August. Infrastructure Ennis is served by the Big Sky Airport. In popular culture * The plot of Steven Seagal's film The Patriot was set in this town. * Ennis was featured on an episode of Haunted Highway in 2012. Wildlife restoration In 2012, a few miles south of Ennis, in restored wetlands along O'Dell spring creek and the Madison River, Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks and the Montana Audubon Society undertook a project to reintroduce trumpeter swans to the Madison Valley. In August 2012, five trumpeter swan cygnets were released in restored wetlands. The goals of the project are to establish at least five breeding pairs of trumpeter swans through annual releases over five years.

The three principles are often translated into and summarized as nationalism, democracy, and the livelihood of the people. This philosophy has been claimed as the cornerstone of the Republic of China's policy as carried by the Kuomintang (KMT); the principles also appear in the first line of the Republic of China national anthem. Origins The concept first appearing in the newspaper Min Bao in 1905 appearing as \\"Three Big Principles\\" (‰∏âÂ§ß‰∏ªÁæ©) instead of \\"Three Principles of the People\\" (‰∏âÊ∞ë‰∏ªÁæ©). In 1894 when the Revive China Society was formed, Sun only had two principles: nationalism and democracy. He picked up the third idea, welfare, during his three-year trip to Europe from 1896 to 1898.Li Chien-Nung, translated by Teng, Ssu-yu, Jeremy Ingalls. The political history of China, 1840‚Äì1928. Princeton, NJ: Van Nostrand, 1956; rpr. Stanford University Press. , . pp. 203‚Äì206. He announced all three ideas in the spring of 1905, during another trip to Europe. Sun made the first speech of his life on the \\"Three Principles of the People\\" in Brussels. He was able to organize the Revive China Society in many European cities. There were about 30 members in the Brussels branch at the time, 20 in Berlin, and 10 in Paris. After the Tongmenghui was formed, Sun published an editorial in Min Bao (Ê∞ëÂ†±). This was the first time the ideas were expressed in writing. Later on, in the anniversary issue of Min Bao, his long speech of the Three Principles was printed, and the editors of the newspaper discussed the issue of people's livelihood. The ideology is said to be heavily influenced by Sun's experiences in the United States and contains elements of the American progressive movement and the thought championed by Abraham Lincoln. Sun credited a line from Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, \\"government of the people, by the people, for the people\\", as an inspiration for the Three Principles. Dr. Sun's Three Principles of the People are inter-connected as the guideline for China's modernization development as stretched by Hu Hanmin. The Principles =M√≠nz√∫ or Civic Nationalism= The Principle of M√≠nz√∫ (Ê∞ëÊóè‰∏ªÁæ©, M√≠nz√∫ Zh«îy√¨) is commonly rendered as \\"nationalism\\", literally \\"Populism\\" or \\"rule/government of the People\\", \\"M√≠nz√∫/People\\" clearly describing a nation rather than a group of persons united by a purpose, hence the commonly used and rather accurate translation \\"nationalism\\". By this, Sun meant independence from imperialist domination or oppression. To achieve this he believed that China must develop a \\"China-nationalism,\\" Zhonghua Minzu, as opposed to an \\"ethnic-nationalism,\\" so as to unite all of the different ethnicities of China. These were mainly composed of the five major groups, Han, Mongols, Tibetans, Manchus, and the Muslims (such as the Uyghurs), which together are symbolized by the Five Color Flag of the First Republic (1911‚Äì1928). This sense of nationalism is different from the idea of \\"ethnocentrism,\\" which equates to the same meaning of nationalism in Chinese language. To achieve this he believed that China must develop a \\"national consciousness\\" so as to unite the Han in the face of imperialist aggression. He argued that \\"minzu\\", which can be translated as \\"people\\", \\"nationality\\" or \\"race\\", were defined by sharing common blood, livelihood, religion, language and customs. =M√≠nqu√°n or Governance Rights= The Principle of M√≠nqu√°n (Ê∞ëÊ¨ä‰∏ªÁæ©, M√≠nqu√°n Zh«îy√¨) is usually translated as \\"democracy\\"; literally \\"the People's power\\" or \\"government by the People.\\" To Sun, it represented a Western constitutional government. He divided political life of his ideal for China into two sets of \\"powers\\": the power of politics and the power of governance. The power of politics (ÊîøÊ¨ä, zh√®ngqu√°n) are the powers of the people to express their political wishes, similar to those vested in the citizenry or the parliaments in other countries, and is represented by the National Assembly. There are four of these powers: election (ÈÅ∏Ëàâ), recall (ÁΩ∑ÂÖç), initiative (ÂâµÂà∂), and referendum (Ë§áÊ±∫). These may be equated to \\"civil rights\\". The power of governance (Ê≤ªÊ¨ä, zh√¨qu√°n) are the powers of administration. Here he expanded the European-American constitutional theory of a three-branch government and a system of checks and balances by incorporating traditional Chinese administrative tradition to create a government of five branches (each of which is called a Yuan (Èô¢, yu√†n, literally \\"court\\"). The Legislative Yuan, the Executive Yuan, and the Judicial Yuan came from Montesquieuan thought; the Control Yuan and the Examination Yuan came from Chinese tradition. (Note that the Legislative Yuan was first intended as a branch of governance, not strictly equivalent to a national parliament.) =M√≠nshƒìng or Welfare Rights= The Principle of M√≠nshƒìng (Ê∞ëÁîü‰∏ªÁæ©, M√≠nshƒìng Zh«îy√¨) is sometimes translated as \\"the People's welfare/livelihood,\\" \\"Government for the People\\". The concept may be understood as social welfare and as a direct criticism of the inadequacies of capitalism. He was influenced by the American thinker Henry George. Sun intended to introduce a Georgist tax reform. The land value tax in Taiwan is a legacy thereof. Sun Yat-sen said that land value tax as \\"the only means of supporting the government is an infinitely just, reasonable, and equitably distributed tax, and on it we will found our new system.\\"Post, Louis Freeland (April 12, 1912). \\"Sun Yat Sen's Economic Program for China\\". The Public. 15: 349. Retrieved 8 November 2016. He divided livelihood into four areas: clothing, food, housing, and mobility; and planned out how an ideal (Chinese) government can take care of these for its people. Sun died before he was able to fully explain his vision of this Principle and it has been the subject of much debate within both the Chinese Nationalist and Communist Parties, with the latter suggesting that Sun supported socialism. Chiang Kai-shek further elaborated the M√≠nshƒìng principle of both the importance of social well-being and recreational activities for a modernized China in 1953 in Taiwan. Canon \\"Portrait of Sun Yat-sen\\" (1921) Li Tiefu Oil on Canvas 93√ó71.7cm The most definite (canonical) exposition of these principles was a book compiled from notes of speeches that Sun gave near Guangzhou (taken by a colleague, Huang Changgu, in consultation with Sun), and therefore is open to interpretation by various parties and interest groups (see below) and may not have been as fully explicated as Sun might have wished. Indeed, Chiang Kai-shek supplied an annex to the Principle of M√≠nshƒìng, covering two additional areas of livelihood: education and leisure, and explicitly arguing that M√≠nshƒìng was not to be seen as supporting either communism or socialism. The French historian of Chinese history, Marie-Claire Berg√®re's view is that the book is a work of propaganda. Its purpose is to appeal to action rather than to thought. As Sun Yat-sen declared, a principle is not simply an idea; it is \\"a faith, a power.\\" Legacy A sign on Dadan Island near Quemoy (Kinmen) facing Mainland China proclaiming \\"Three Principles of the People Unites China\\" set by General Zhao in Aug. 1986, dismissed after 1987 Lieyu Massacre The Three Principles of the People were claimed as the basis for the ideologies of the Kuomintang under Chiang Kai- shek, of the Communist Party of China under Mao Zedong, and of the Reorganized National Government of China under Wang Jingwei. The Kuomintang and the Communist Party of China largely agreed on the meaning of nationalism but differed sharply on the meaning of democracy and people's welfare, which the former saw in Western social democratic terms and the latter interpreted in Marxist and communist terms. The Japanese collaborationist government interpreted nationalism less in terms of anti-imperialism and more in terms of cooperating with Japan to advance theoretically pan-Asian, but in practice, typically Japanese interests. =Taiwan (Republic of China)= There were several higher-education institutes (university departments/faculties and graduate institutes) in Taiwan that used to devote themselves to the 'research and development' of the Three Principles in this aspect. Since the late 1990s, these institutes have re-oriented themselves so that other political theories are also admitted as worthy of consideration, and have changed their names to be more ideologically neutral (such as Democratic Studies Institute). In addition to this institutional phenomenon, many streets and businesses in Taiwan are named \\"SƒÅn-m√≠n\\" or for one of the three principles. In contrast to other politically-derived street names, there has been no major renaming of these streets or institutions in the 1990s. Although the term \\"Sanmin Zhuyi\\" (‰∏âÊ∞ë‰∏ªÁæ©) has been less explicitly invoked since the mid-1980s, no political party has explicitly attacked its principles with practices under the Martial Law ruling era then except the Tangwai movement groups such as Democratic Progressive Party. The Three Principles of the People remains explicitly part of the platform of the Kuomintang and in the Constitution of the Republic of China. As for Taiwan independence supporters, some have objections regarding the formal constitutional commitment to a particular set of political principles. Also, they have been against the mandatory indoctrination in schools and universities, which have now been abolished in a piecemeal fashion beginning in the late 1990s. However, there is little fundamental hostility to the substantive principles themselves. In these circles, attitudes toward the Three Principles of the People span the spectrum from indifference to reinterpreting the Three Principles of the People in a local Taiwanese context rather than in a pan-Chinese one. =Vietnam= The Vietnam Revolutionary League was a union of various Vietnamese nationalist groups, run by the pro- Chinese Vi·ªát Nam Qu·ªëc D√¢n ƒê·∫£ng. The Vi·ªát Nam Qu·ªëc D√¢n ƒê·∫£ng translates directly into Vietnamese Kuomintang, and it was based on the Chinese Kuomintang party. Its stated goal was for unity with China under the Three Principles of the People, and opposition to Japanese and French Imperialists. The Revolutionary League was controlled by Nguy·ªÖn H·∫£i Th·∫ßn, who was born in China and could not speak Vietnamese . General Zhang Fakui shrewdly blocked the Communists of Vietnam, and Ho Chi Minh from entering the league, as his main goal was Chinese influence in Indo China. The KMT utilized these Vietnamese nationalists during World War II against Japanese forces. =Tibet= The pro- Kuomintang and pro-ROC Khamba revolutionary leader Pandatsang Rapga, who established the Tibet Improvement Party, adopted Dr. Sun's ideology including the Three Principles, incorporating them into his party and using Sun's doctrine as a model for his vision of Tibet after achieving his goal of overthrowing the Tibetan government. Pandatsang Rapga hailed the Three Principles of Dr. Sun for helping Asian peoples against foreign imperialism and called for the feudal system to be overthrown. Rapga stated that \\"The Sanmin Zhuyi was intended for all peoples under the domination of foreigners, for all those who had been deprived of the rights of man. But it was conceived especially for the Asians. It is for this reason that I translated it. At that time, a lot of new ideas were spreading in Tibet\\", during an interview in 1975 by Dr. Heather Stoddard. Dr. Sun's ideology was put into a Tibetan translation by Rapga. He believed that change in Tibet would only be possible in a manner similar to when the Qing Dynasty was overthrown in China. He borrowed the theories and ideas of the Kuomintang as the basis for his model for Tibet. The party was funded by the Kuomintang and by the Pandatsang family. =Singapore= The establishment of the People's Power Party in May 2015 by opposition politician Goh Meng Seng marks the first time in contemporary Singaporean politics that a political party was formed with the Three Principles of the People and its system of having five branches of government as espoused by Sun Yat-Sen as its official guiding ideology. The People's Power Party has adapted the ideas with a slight modification to the concepts of the Five Powers in order to stay relevant to modern contemporary political and social structures. The emphasis is put on the separation of the Five Powers which naturally means the separation of certain institutions from the Executive's control. The Power of Impeachment (originally under the Control Yuan) has been expanded to include various contemporary functional government institutions. Examples include the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau, advocacy of Ombudsman Commission, Equal Opportunity Commission, Free Press and Freedom of Expression. The Power of Examination has been adapted and modified to fit the modern concept of Selection for both political leaders as well as civil servants. This involves institutions like the Elections Department and Public Service Commission. The People's Power Party advocates that the institutions included in these two powers, namely the Power of Impeachment and the Power of Selection, to be put under the supervision of Singapore's Elected President.

He was initially a member of the left-wing of the Kuomintang (KMT), leading a government in Wuhan in opposition to the right- wing government in Nanjing, but later became increasingly anti-communist after his efforts to collaborate with the Chinese Communist Party ended in political failure. His political orientation veered sharply to the right later in his career after he collaborated with the Japanese. Wang was a close associate of Sun Yat-sen for the last twenty years of Sun's life. After Sun's death in 1925 Wang engaged in a political struggle with Chiang Kai-shek for control over the Kuomintang, but lost. Wang remained inside the Kuomintang, but continued to have disagreements with Chiang until the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, after which he accepted an invitation from the Japanese Empire to form a Japanese-supported collaborationist government in Nanjing. Wang served as the head of state for this Japanese puppet government until he died, shortly before the end of World War II. Although he is still regarded as an important contributor in the Xinhai Revolution, his collaboration with Imperial Japan is a subject of academic debate,http://www.scmp.com/article/709876/tragic-lives-national-hero-turned- traitor-and-wife-who-stayed- loyalhttp://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/china/wang-ching-wei.htm and the typical narratives often regard him as a traitor in the War of Resistance.http://etoep.tc.edu.tw/modules/km_user/viewres.php?did=8488http://www.books.com.tw/products/0010566503 Early life and education Wang Jingwei in his twenties. Former residence of Wang Jingwei in Nanjing. Born in Sanshui, Guangdong, but of Zhejiang origin, Wang went to Japan as an international student sponsored by the Qing Dynasty government in 1903, and joined the Tongmenghui in 1905. As a young man, Wang came to blame the Qing dynasty for holding China back, and making it too weak to fight off exploitation by Western imperialist powers. While in Japan, Wang became a close confidant of Sun Yat-sen, and would later go on to become one of the most important members of the early Kuomintang. He was among the Chinese nationalists in Japan who were influenced by Russian anarchism, and published a number of articles in journals edited by Zhang Renjie, Wu Zhihui, and the group of Chinese anarchists in Paris.Biographical Dictionary of Republican China. Eds. Howard L. Boorman and Richard C. Howard,(New York: Columbia University Press, 1970), p. 369-370. Early career In the years leading up to the Xinhai Revolution in 1911, Wang was active in opposing the Qing government. Wang gained prominence during this period as an excellent public speaker and a staunch advocate of Chinese nationalism. He was jailed for plotting an assassination of the regent, Prince Chun, and readily admitted his guilt at trial. He remained in jail from 1910 until the Wuchang Uprising the next year, and became something of a national hero upon his release.The Biographical Dictionary of Republican China. Eds. Howard L. Boorman and Richard C. Howard,(New York: Columbia University Press, 1970), pp. 370‚Äì371. During and after the Xinhai Revolution, Wang's political life was defined by his opposition to Western imperialism. In the early 1920s, he held several posts in Sun Yat-sen's Revolutionary Government in Guangzhou, and was the only member of Sun's inner circle to accompany him on trips outside of Kuomintang (KMT)-held territory in the months immediately preceding Sun's death. He is believed by many to have drafted Sun's will during the short period before Sun's death, in the winter of 1925. He was considered one of the main contenders to replace Sun as leader of the KMT, but eventually lost control of the party and army to Chiang Kai-shek.Spence, Jonathan D. (1999) The Search for Modern China, W.W. Norton and Company. pp. 321‚Äì322. . Wang had clearly lost control of the KMT by 1926, when, following the Zhongshan Warship Incident, Chiang successfully sent Wang and his family to vacation in Europe. It was important for Chiang to have Wang away from Guangdong while Chiang was in the process of expelling communists from the KMT because Wang was then the leader of the left wing of the KMT, notably sympathetic to communists and communism, and may have opposed Chiang if he had remained in China.Barnouin, Barbara and Yu Changgen.

Rivalry with Chiang Kai-shek Wang Jingwei and Chiang Kai-Shek in 1926 =Leader of the Wuhan Government= During the Northern Expedition, Wang was the leading figure in the left-leaning faction of the KMT that called for continued cooperation with the Chinese Communist Party. Although Wang collaborated closely with Chinese communists in Wuhan, he was philosophically opposed to communism and regarded the KMT's Comintern advisors with suspicion.Dongyoun Hwang. Wang Jingwei, The National Government, and the Problem of Collaboration. PhD Dissertation, Duke University. UMI Dissertation Services, Ann Arbor Michigain. 2000, p. 118. He did not believe that Communists could be true patriots or true Chinese nationalists.Dongyoun Hwang. Wang Jingwei, The National Government, and the Problem of Collaboration. PhD Dissertation, Duke University. UMI Dissertation Services, Ann Arbor Michigain. 2000, p. 148. In early 1927, shortly before Chiang captured Shanghai and moved the capital to Nanjing, Wang's faction declared the capital of the Republic to be Wuhan. While attempting to direct the government from Wuhan, Wang was notable for his close collaboration with leading communist figures, including Mao Zedong, Chen Duxiu, and Borodin, and for his faction's provocative land reform policies. Wang later blamed the failure of his Wuhan government on its excessive adoption of communist agendas. Wang's regime was opposed by Chiang Kai-shek, who was in the midst of a bloody purge of communists in Shanghai and was calling for a push farther north. The separation between the governments of Wang and Chiang are known as the \\"Ninghan Separation\\" ().Spence, Jonathan D. (1999) The Search for Modern China, W.W. Norton and Company. pp. 338‚Äì339. . Chiang Kai-shek occupied Shanghai in April 1927, and began a bloody suppression of suspected communists known as the \\"White Terror\\". Within several weeks of Chiang's suppression of communists in Shanghai, Wang's leftist government was attacked by a KMT-aligned warlord and promptly disintegrated, leaving Chiang as the sole legitimate leader of the Republic. KMT troops occupying territories formerly controlled by Wang conducted massacres of suspected Communists in many areas: around Changsha alone, over ten thousand people were killed in a single twenty-day period. Fearing retribution as a communist sympathizer, Wang publicly claimed allegiance to Chiang before fleeing to Europe.Barnouin, Barbara and Yu Changgen. Zhou Enlai: A Political Life. Hong Kong: Chinese University of Hong Kong, 2006. p.38. Retrieved 12 March 2011. =Political activities in Chiang's government= Between 1929 and 1930, Wang collaborated with Feng Yuxiang and Yan Xishan to form a central government in opposition to the one headed by Chiang. Wang took part in a conference hosted by Yan to draft a new constitution, and was to serve as the Prime Minister under Yan, who would be President. Wang's attempts to aid Yan's government ended when Chiang defeated the alliance in the Central Plains War.Gillin, Donald G. \\"Portrait of a Warlord: Yen Hsi-shan in Shansi Province, 1911‚Äì1930\\" The Journal of Asian Studies. Vol. 19, No. 3, May, 1960. p. 293. Retrieved 23 February 2011. Wang Jingwei (second from left) and Chen Bijun (far left) in British Malaya, 1935. In 1931, Wang joined another anti- Chiang government in Guangzhou. After Chiang defeated this regime, Wang reconciled with Chiang's Nanjing government and held prominent posts for most of the decade. Wang was appointed premier just as the Battle of Shanghai (1932) began. He had frequent disputes with Chiang and would resign in protest several times only to have his resignation rescinded. As a result of these power struggles within the KMT, Wang was forced to spend much of his time in exile. He traveled to Germany, and maintained some contact with Adolf Hitler. As the leader of the Kuomintang's left-wing faction and a man who had been closely associated with Dr. Sun, Chiang wanted Wang as premier both to protect the \\"progressive\\" reputation of his government which was waging a civil war with the Communists and a shield for protecting his government from widespread public criticism of Chiang's policy of \\"first internal pacification, then external resistance\\" (i.e. first defeat the Communists, then confront Japan). Despite the fact that Wang and Chiang disliked and distrusted each other, Chiang was prepared to make compromises to keep Wang on as premier. In regards to Japan, Wang and Chiang differed in that Wang was extremely pessimistic about China's ability to win the coming war with Japan (which almost everyone in 1930s China regarded as inevitable) and was opposed to alliances with any foreign powers should the war come. While being opposed to any effort at this time to subordinate China to Japan, Wang also saw the \\"white powers\\" like the Soviet Union, Britain and the United States as equal if not greater dangers to China, insisting that China had to defeat Japan solely by its own efforts if the Chinese were to hope to maintain their independence. But at the same time, Wang's belief that China was too economically backward at present to win a war against a Japan which had been aggressively modernizing since the Meiji Restoration of 1867 made him the advocate of avoiding war with Japan at almost any cost and trying to negotiate some sort of an agreement with Japan which would preserve China's independence. Chiang by contrast believed that if his modernization program was given enough time, China would win the coming war and that if the war came before his modernization plans were complete, he was willing to ally with any foreign power to defeat Japan, even including the Soviet Union, which was supporting the Chinese Communists in the civil war. Chiang was much more of a hardline anti-Communist than was Wang, but Chiang was also a self-proclaimed \\"realist\\" who was willing if necessary to have an alliance with the Soviet Union. Though in the short-run, Wang and Chiang agreed on the policy of \\"first internal pacification, then external resistance\\", in the long-run they differed as Wang was more of an appeaser while Chiang just wanted to buy time to modernize China for the coming war. The effectiveness of the KMT was constantly hindered by leadership and personal struggles, such as that between Wang and Chiang. In December 1935, Wang permanently left the premiership after being seriously wounded during an assassination attempt a month earlier. In 1936, Wang clashed with Chiang over foreign policy. In an ironic role reversal, the left-wing \\"progressive\\" Wang argued for accepting the German-Japanese offer of having China sign the Anti- Comintern Pact while the right-wing \\"reactionary\\" Chiang wanted a rapprochement with the Soviet Union. During the 1936 Xi'an Incident, in which Chiang was taken prisoner by his own general, Zhang Xueliang, Wang favored sending a \\"punitive expedition\\" to attack Zhang. He was apparently ready to march on Zhang, but Chiang's wife, Soong Mei-ling, and brother-in-law, T. V. Soong, feared that such an action would lead to Chiang's death and his replacement by Wang, so they successfully opposed this action.Barnouin, Barbara and Yu Changgen. Zhou Enlai: A Political Life. Hong Kong: Chinese University of Hong Kong, 2006. p.66. Retrieved 12 March 2011. Wang accompanied the government on its retreat to Chongqing during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937‚Äì1945). During this time, he organized some right-wing groups along European fascist lines inside the KMT. Wang was originally part of the pro-war group; but, after the Japanese were successful in occupying large areas of coastal China, Wang became known for his pessimistic view on China's chances in the war against Japan.Cheng, Pei-Kai, Michael Lestz, and Jonathan D. Spence (Eds.) The Search for Modern China: A Documentary Collection, W.W. Norton and Company. (1999) pp. 330‚Äì331. . He often voiced defeatist opinions in KMT staff meetings, and continued to express his view that Western imperialism was the greater danger to China, much to the chagrin of his associates. Wang believed that China needed to reach a negotiated settlement with Japan so that Asia could resist Western Powers. Alliance with the Axis Powers Wang receiving German diplomats while head of state in 1941 Hideki Tojo and Wang Jingwei meet in 1942 In late 1938, Wang left Chongqing for Hanoi, French Indochina, where he stayed for three months and announced his support for a negotiated settlement with the Japanese. During this time, he was wounded in an assassination attempt by KMT agents. Wang then flew to Shanghai, where he entered negotiations with Japanese authorities. The Japanese invasion had given him the opportunity he had long sought to establish a new government outside of Chiang Kai-shek's control. On 30 March 1940, Wang became the head of state of what came to be known as the Wang Jingwei regime (formally \\"the Reorganized National Government of the Republic of China\\") based in Nanjing, serving as the President of the Executive Yuan and Chairman of the National Government (Ë°åÊîøÈô¢Èï∑ÂÖºÂúãÊ∞ëÊîøÂ∫ú‰∏ªÂ∏≠). In November 1940, Wang's government signed the \\"Sino-Japanese Treaty\\" with the Japanese, a document that has been compared with Japan's Twenty-one Demands for its broad political, military, and economic concessions. In June 1941, Wang gave a public radio address from Tokyo in which he praised Japan and affirmed China's submission to it while criticizing the Kuomintang government, and pledged to work with the Empire of Japan to resist Communism and Western imperialism.Wang Jingwei. \\"Radio Address by Mr. Wang Jingwei, President of the Chinese Executive Yuan Broadcast on 24 June 1941\\" The Search for Modern China: A Documentary Collection.

(1994) Administration of the Wang Jingwei regime Chinese under the regime had greater access to coveted wartime luxuries, and the Japanese enjoyed things like matches, rice, tea, coffee, cigars, foods, and alcoholic drinks, all of which were scarce in Japan proper, but consumer goods became more scarce after Japan entered World War II. In Japan-occupied Chinese territories, the prices of basic necessities rose substantially, as Japan's war effort expanded. In Shanghai in 1941, they increased elevenfold. Daily life was often difficult in the Nanjing Nationalist government- controlled Republic of China, and grew more so as the war turned against Japan (c. 1943). Local residents resorted to the black market to obtain needed items. The Japanese Kempeitai, Tokko, collaborationist Chinese police, and Chinese citizens in the service of the Japanese all worked to censor information, monitor any opposition, and torture enemies and dissenters. A \\"native\\" secret agency, the Tewu, was created with the aid of Japanese Army \\"advisors\\". The Japanese also established prisoner-of-war detention centers, concentration camps, and kamikaze training centers to indoctrinate pilots. Since Wang's government held authority only over territories under Japanese military occupation, there was a limited amount that officials loyal to Wang could do to ease the suffering of Chinese under Japanese occupation. Wang himself became a focal point of anti-Japanese resistance. He was demonized and branded as an \\"arch-traitor\\" in both KMT and Communist propaganda. Wang and his government were deeply unpopular with the Chinese populace, who regarded them as traitors to both the Chinese state and Han Chinese identity.Frederic Wakeman, Jr. ‚ÄúHanjian (Traitor) Collaboration and Retribution in Wartime Shanghai.‚Äù In Wen-hsin Yeh, ed. Becoming Chinese: Passages to Modernity and Beyond. (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2000), 322. Wang‚Äôs rule was constantly undermined by resistance and sabotage. The strategy of the local education system was to create a workforce suited for employment in factories and mines, and for manual labor in general. The Japanese also attempted to introduce their culture and dress to the Chinese. Complaints and agitation called for more meaningful Chinese educational development. Shinto temples and similar cultural centers were built in order to instill Japanese culture and values. These activities came to a halt at the end of the war. Death In March 1944, Wang left for Japan to undergo medical treatment for the wound left by an assassination attempt in 1939.Lifu Chen and Ramon Hawley Myers. The storm clouds clear over China: the memoir of Ch ªen Li-fu, 1900‚Äì1993. p. 141. (1994) He died in Nagoya on 10 November 1944, less than a year before Japan's surrender to the Allies, thus avoiding a trial for treason. Many of his senior followers who lived to see the end of the war were executed. His death was not reported in occupied China until the afternoon of November 12, after commemorative events for Sun Yat-sen's birth had concluded. Wang was buried in Nanjing near the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum, in an elaborately constructed tomb.Taylor, Jeremy E. (2019). ‚ÄúFrom Traitor to Martyr: Drawing Lessons From the Death and Burial of Wang Jingwei, 1944.‚Äù Journal of Chinese History 3, p. 146-153. https://doi.org/10.1017/jch.2017.43. Soon after Japan's defeat, the Kuomintang government under Chiang Kai-shek moved its capital back to Nanjing, destroyed Wang's tomb, and burned the body. Today, the site is commemorated with a small pavilion that notes Wang as a traitor. Legacy For his role in the Pacific War, Wang has been considered a traitor by most post-World War II Chinese historians in both Taiwan and mainland China. His name has become a byword for \\"traitor\\" or \\"treason\\" in mainland China and Taiwan, similarly to \\"Quisling\\" in Europe, \\"Benedict Arnold\\" in the United States, or \\"Mir Jafar\\" in India and Bangladesh. The mainland's communist government despised Wang not only for his collaboration with the Japanese, but also for his anti-communism, while the KMT downplayed his anti-communism and emphasized his collaboration with imperial Japan and betrayal of Chiang Kai-shek. The communists also used his ties with the KMT to demonstrate what they saw as the duplicitous, treasonous nature of the KMT. Both sides downplayed his earlier association with Sun Yat-sen because of his eventual collaboration.Wang Ke-Wan, ‚ÄúIrreversible Verdict? Historical Assessments of Wang Jingwei in the People‚Äôs Republic and Taiwan.‚Äù Twentieth Century China. Vol. 28, No. 1. (November 2003), 59. Despite the notoriety added to his name, academics continue to discuss whether or not he should be unequivocally condemned as a traitor because Wang also contributed greatly to the Xinhai Revolution and to the later mediation between the Communist Party and the Nationalist Party in postwar China. They argue that Wang collaborated with the Japanese because he believed that collaboration was the only hope for his desperate countrymen.http://www.hoplite.cn/templates/jsyjs0009.htmlhttp://xuyida.home.news.cn/blog/a/01010000BB540CF125B1FB81.html Personal life Wang was married to Chen Bijun and had six children with her, five of whom survived into adulthood. Of those who survived into adulthood, Wang's eldest son, Wenjin, was born in France in 1913. Wang's eldest daughter, Wenxing, was born in France in 1915, after 1948 was a teacher in Hong Kong, retired to the US in 1984 and died in 2015. Wang's second daughter, Wang Wenbin, was born in 1920. Wang's third daughter, Wenxun, was born in Guangzhou in 1922, and died in 2002 in Hong Kong. Wang's second son, Wenti, was born in 1928, and was sentenced in 1946 to imprisonment for being a hanjian.

Classical Chinese is a traditional style of written Chinese that evolved from the classical language, making it different from any modern spoken form of Chinese. Literary Chinese was used for almost all formal writing in China until the early 20th century, and also, during various periods, in Japan, Korea and Vietnam. Among Chinese speakers, Literary Chinese has been largely replaced by written vernacular Chinese, a style of writing that is similar to modern spoken Mandarin Chinese, while speakers of non-Chinese languages have largely abandoned Literary Chinese in favor of local vernaculars. The Classic of Poetry (Ë©©Á∂ì or shƒ´jƒ´ng), a collection of Chinese poetry, comprising 305 works dating from the 11th to 7th centuries BC Literary Chinese is known as ' () in Japanese, ' in Korean (but see also ') and h√°n vƒÉn (Êº¢Êñá), ' () or ' () in Vietnamese.  Definitions  Strictly speaking, Classical Chinese refers to the written language of the classical period of Chinese literature, from the end of the Spring and Autumn period (early 5th century BC) to the end of the Han dynasty (AD 220), while Literary Chinese is the form of written Chinese used from the end of the Han Dynasty to the early 20th century, when it was replaced by vernacular written Chinese. It is often also referred to as \\"Classical Chinese\\", but sinologists generally distinguish it from the language of the early period. During this period the dialects of China became more and more disparate and thus the Classical written language became less and less representative of the varieties of Chinese (cf. Classical Latin, which was contemporary to the Han Dynasty, and the Romance languages of Europe). Although authors sought to write in the style of the Classics, the similarity decreased over the centuries due to their imperfect understanding of the older language, the influence of their own speech, and the addition of new words.Norman (1988), pp. 83‚Äì84, 108‚Äì109. This situation, the use of Literary Chinese throughout the Chinese cultural sphere despite the existence of disparate regional vernaculars, is called diglossia. It can be compared to the position of Classical Arabic relative to the various regional vernaculars in Arab lands, or of Latin in medieval Europe. The Romance languages continued to evolve, influencing Latin texts of the same period, so that by the Middle Ages, Medieval Latin included many usages that would have been foreign to the Romans. The coexistence of Classical Chinese and the native languages of Japan, Korea and Vietnam can be compared to the use of Latin in nations that natively speak non-Latin-derived Germanic languages or Slavic languages, to the position of Arabic in Persia, or the position of the Indic language Sanskrit in South India and Southeast Asia. However, the non-phonetic Chinese writing system causes a unique situation where the modern pronunciation of the classical language is far more divergent (and heterogeneous, depending on the native ‚Äì not necessarily Chinese ‚Äì tongue of the reader) than in analogous cases, complicating understanding and study of Classical Chinese further compared to other classical languages. Christian missionaries coined the term Wen-li () for Literary Chinese. Though composed from Chinese roots, this term was never used in that sense in Chinese, and was rejected by non-missionary sinologues.  Pronunciation  The shape of the Oracle bone script character for \\"person\\" may have influenced that for \\"harvest\\" (which later came to mean \\"year\\"). Today, they are pronounced r√©n and ni√°n in Mandarin, but their hypothesized pronunciations in Old Chinese were very similar, which may explain the resemblance. For example, in the recent Baxter-Sagart reconstruction,http://ocbaxtersagart.lsait.lsa.umich.edu/ they were and , respectively, becoming and in Early Middle Chinese. Chinese characters are not alphabetic and only rarely reflect sound changes. The tentative reconstruction of Old Chinese is an endeavor only a few centuries old. As a result, Classical Chinese is not read with a reconstruction of Old Chinese pronunciation; instead, it is always read with the pronunciations of characters categorized and listed in the Phonology Dictionary (ÈüªÊõ∏; pinyin: y√πnsh≈´, \\"rhyme book\\") officially published by the Governments, originally based upon the Middle Chinese pronunciation of Luoyang in the 2nd to 4th centuries. With the progress of time, every dynasty has updated and modified the official Phonology Dictionary. By the time of the Yuan Dynasty and Ming Dynasty, the Phonology Dictionary was based on early Mandarin. But since the Imperial Examination required the composition of Shi genre, in non-Mandarin speaking parts of China such as Zhejiang, Guangdong and Fujian, pronunciation is either based on everyday speech as in Cantonese; or, in some varieties of Chinese (e.g. Southern Min), with a special set of pronunciations used for Classical Chinese or \\"formal\\" vocabulary and usage borrowed from Classical Chinese usage. In practice, all varieties of Chinese combine these two extremes. Mandarin and Cantonese, for example, also have words that are pronounced one way in colloquial usage and another way when used in Classical Chinese or in specialized terms coming from Classical Chinese, though the system is not as extensive as that of Southern Min or Wu. (See Literary and colloquial readings of Chinese characters) Japanese, Korean or Vietnamese readers of Classical Chinese use systems of pronunciation specific to their own languages. For example, Japanese speakers use On'yomi pronunciation when reading the kanji of words of Chinese origin such as ÈäÄË°å (gink≈ç) or the name for the city of T≈çky≈ç (Êù±‰∫¨), but use Kun'yomi when the kanji represents a native word such as the reading of Ë°å in Ë°å„Åè (iku) or the reading of both characters in the name for the city of ≈åsaka (Â§ßÈò™), and a system that aids Japanese speakers with Classical Chinese word order. Since the pronunciation of all modern varieties of Chinese is different from Old Chinese or other forms of historical Chinese (such as Middle Chinese), characters that once rhymed in poetry may not rhyme any longer, or vice versa. Poetry and other rhyme-based writing thus becomes less coherent than the original reading must have been. However, some modern Chinese varieties have certain phonological characteristics that are closer to the older pronunciations than others, as shown by the preservation of certain rhyme structures. Some believe Classical Chinese literature, especially poetry, sounds better when read in certain varieties that are believed to be closer to older pronunciations, such as Cantonese or Southern Min, because the rhyming is often lost due to sound shifts in Mandarin. Another phenomenon that is common in reading Classical Chinese is homophony (words that sound the same). More than 2,500 years of sound change separates Classical Chinese from any modern variety, so when reading Classical Chinese in any modern variety of Chinese (especially Mandarin) or in Japanese, Korean, or Vietnamese, many characters which originally had different pronunciations have become homonyms. There is a famous Classical Chinese poem written in the early 20th century by the linguist Chao Yuen Ren called the Lion-Eating Poet in the Stone Den, which contains only words that are now pronounced with various tones in Mandarin. It was written to show how Classical Chinese has become an impractical language for speakers of modern Chinese because Classical Chinese when spoken aloud is largely incomprehensible. However the poem is perfectly comprehensible when read silently because Literary Chinese, by its very nature as a written language using a logographic writing system, can often get away with using homophones that even in spoken Old Chinese would not have been distinguishable in any way. The situation is analogous to that of some English words that are spelled differently but sound the same, such as \\"meet\\" and \\"meat\\", which were pronounced and respectively during the time of Chaucer, as shown by their spelling. However, such homophones are far more common in Literary Chinese than in English. For example, the following distinct Old Chinese words are now all pronounced y√¨ in Mandarin: *≈ãjajs Ë≠∞ \\"discuss\\", *≈ãj…ôt ‰ª° \\"powerful\\", * îjup ÈÇë \\"city\\", * îj…ôk ÂÑÑ \\"100,000,000\\", * îj…ôks ÊÑè \\"thought\\", * îjek Áõä \\"increase\\", * îjik Êäë \\"press down\\", *jak Âºà \\"Chinese chess\\", ÈÄ∏ \\"flee\\", Áøº \\"wing\\", Êòì \\"change\\", Êòì \\"easy\\", and Ëú¥ \\"lizard\\". Romanizations have been devised giving distinct spellings for the words of Classical Chinese, together with rules for pronunciation in various modern varieties. The earliest was the Romanisation Interdialectique (1931‚Äì2) of French missionaries Henri Lamasse, of the Paris Foreign Missions Society, and Ernest Jasmin, based on Middle Chinese, followed by linguist Wang Li's w√©ny√°n lu√≥m«éz√¨ (1940) based on Old Chinese, and Chao's General Chinese Romanization (1975). However none of these systems has seen extensive use.  Grammar and lexicon  Classical Chinese is distinguished from written vernacular Chinese in its style, which appears extremely concise and compact to modern Chinese speakers, and to some extent in the use of different lexical items (vocabulary). An essay in Classical Chinese, for example, might use half as many Chinese characters as in vernacular Chinese to relate the same content. In terms of conciseness and compactness, Classical Chinese rarely uses words composed of two Chinese characters; nearly all words are of one syllable only. This stands directly in contrast with modern Northern Chinese varieties including Mandarin, in which two-syllable, three- syllable, and four-syllable words are extremely common, whilst although two- syllable words are also quite common within modern Southern Chinese varieties, they are still more archaic in that they use more one-syllable words than Northern Chinese varieties. This phenomenon exists, in part, because polysyllabic words evolved in Chinese to disambiguate homophones that result from sound changes. This is similar to such phenomena in English as the pen‚Äìpin merger of many dialects in the American south and the caught-cot merger of most dialects of American English: because the words \\"pin\\" and \\"pen\\", as well as \\"caught\\" and \\"cot\\", sound alike in such dialects of English, a certain degree of confusion can occur unless one adds qualifiers like \\"ink pen\\" and \\"stick pin.\\" Similarly, Chinese has acquired many polysyllabic words in order to disambiguate monosyllabic words that sounded different in earlier forms of Chinese but identical in one region or another during later periods. Because Classical Chinese is based on the literary examples of ancient Chinese literature, it has almost none of the two-syllable words present in modern Chinese varieties. Classical Chinese has more pronouns compared to the modern vernacular. In particular, whereas Mandarin has one general character to refer to the first-person pronoun (\\"I\\"/\\"me\\"), Literary Chinese has several, many of which are used as part of honorific language (see Chinese honorifics). In syntax, Classical Chinese is always ready to drop subjects and objects when a reference to them is understood (pragmatically inferable). Also, words are not restrictively categorized into parts of speech: nouns are commonly used as verbs, adjectives as nouns, and so on. There is no copula in Classical Chinese, \\"ÊòØ\\" (pinyin: sh√¨) is a copula in modern Chinese but in old Chinese it was originally a near demonstrative (\\"this\\"); the modern Chinese for \\"this\\" is \\"ÈÄô\\" (pinyin: zh√®). Beyond grammar and vocabulary differences, Classical Chinese can be distinguished by literary and cultural differences: an effort to maintain parallelism and rhythm, even in prose works, and extensive use of literary and cultural allusions, thereby also contributing to brevity. Many final particles (Ê≠áË™ûÂ≠ó, xiƒìy«îz√¨) and interrogative particles are found in Literary Chinese.  Modern use  Classical Chinese was used in international communication between the Mongol Empire and Japan. This letter, dated 1266, was sent to Khubilai Khan from the \\"King of Japan\\" (Êó•Êú¨ÂúãÁéã) before the Mongol invasions of Japan; it was written in Classical Chinese. Now stored in T≈çdai- ji, Nara, Japan. There are some grammar notes on it, which were to help Japanese speakers better understand it. Classical Chinese was the main form used in Chinese literary works until the May Fourth Movement (1919), and was also used extensively in Japan, Korea, and Vietnam. Classical Chinese was used to write the Hunmin Jeongeum proclamation in which the modern Korean alphabet (hangul) was promulgated and the essay by Hu Shih in which he argued against using Classical Chinese and in favor of written vernacular Chinese. (The latter parallels the essay written by Dante in Latin in which he expounded the virtues of the vernacular Italian.) Exceptions to the use of Classical Chinese were vernacular novels such as Dream of the Red Chamber. Most government documents in the Republic of China were written in Classical Chinese until reforms in the 1970s, in a reform movement spearheaded by President Yen Chia- kan to shift the written style to vernacular Chinese. pages 75‚Äì76. Today, pure Classical Chinese is occasionally used in formal or ceremonial occasions. The National Anthem of the Republic of China (‰∏≠ËèØÊ∞ëÂúãÂúãÊ≠å), for example, is in Classical Chinese. Buddhist texts, or sutras, are still preserved in Classical Chinese from the time they were composed or translated from Sanskrit sources. In practice there is a socially accepted continuum between vernacular Chinese and Classical Chinese. For example, most official notices and formal letters are written with a number of stock Classical Chinese expressions (e.g. salutation, closing). Personal letters, on the other hand, are mostly written in vernacular, but with some Classical phrases, depending on the subject matter, the writer's level of education, etc. With the exception of professional scholars and enthusiasts, most people today cannot write in full Classical Chinese with ease. Most Chinese people with at least a middle school education are able to read basic Classical Chinese, because the ability to read (but not write) Classical Chinese is part of the Chinese middle school and high school curricula and is part of the college entrance examination. Classical Chinese is taught primarily by presenting a classical Chinese work and including a vernacular gloss that explains the meaning of phrases. Tests on classical Chinese usually ask the student to express the meaning of a paragraph in vernacular Chinese. They often take the form of comprehension questions. The contemporary use of Classical Chinese in Japan is mainly in the field of education and the study of literature. Learning the Japanese way (kanbun) of decoding Classical Chinese is part of the high school curriculum in Japan. The use of Classical Chinese in these regions is limited and is mainly in the field of Classical studies. In addition, many works of literature in Classical Chinese (such as Tang poetry) have been major cultural influences. However, even with knowledge of grammar and vocabulary, Classical Chinese can be difficult to understand by native speakers of modern Chinese, because of its heavy use of literary references and allusions as well as its extremely abbreviated style.

Her debut solo album, Blue on Blue, was released on August 15, 2006 by the One Son/Nettwerk record labels.  Early life  Nash was born Leigh Anne Bingham in New Braunfels, Texas. She started singing country music and learning old country songs on the guitar at the age of 12. She had several years' experience singing in local cafes with a band and performed regularly at a Texan country & western dance hall. She met guitarist and songwriter Matt Slocum at a church retreat in the early 1990s.  Career  Leigh Nash and Matt Slocum formed Sixpence None the Richer (named for a line from the book Mere Christianity by the author C.S. Lewis) soon after and went on to record four full-length albums with the band. Their first album, released when she was just 16, was The Fatherless & the Widow. The album garnered critical acclaim and Slocum and Nash searched for new band members.Dr. Drew Interview Joined by Tess Wiley, Dale Baker, and J.J. Plascencio, the new band recorded This Beautiful Mess, which won a Dove Award for Best Album. Wiley quit the band after their US tour and the band released the Tickets for a Prayer Wheel EP and then signed to the Squint Records label following the demise of R.E.X. The band's eponymous album was released in 1997 and the single \\"Kiss Me\\" in 1999. In 1999 they received numerous Dove Awards, including Best Artist of the Year. The band was also nominated for a Grammy Award. A second single, a cover of the La's \\"There She Goes\\", also hit the Billboard Hot 100, followed by a third single, \\"I Can't Catch You\\". In 2000, Nash sang the song \\"Need to Be Next to You\\" for the movie Bounce in order to thank Miramax that had used \\"Kiss Me\\" in the movie She's All That and brought them into the spotlight. Written by Diane Warren, it became Nash's first solo single. After the departure of drummer Dale Baker and bass player J.J. Plascencio, Sixpence None the Richer released Divine Discontent in 2001. Two singles from that album, \\"Breathe Your Name\\" and a cover of Crowded House's 1986 hit single \\"Don't Dream It's Over\\", charted on the US Adult Top 40 at No. 18 and No. 9, respectively. In 2004, Sixpence None the Richer announced their break-up by letter from Matt Slocum to CCM Magazine. After that, the band released The Best of Sixpence None the Richer. In 2003, the band appeared on an episode of the final season of the ABC sitcom Sabrina, The Teenage Witch. The group disbanded in 2004. Nash and her husband left their Nashville home of 10 years and moved to Los Angeles. Nash released her first solo record, Blue on Blue, in August 2006 on One Son Records, Nash's own imprint label through Nettwerk Productions. The first single, \\"My Idea of Heaven\\", was released to U.S. radio the week of July 14, 2006, and the song \\"Ocean Size Love\\" was to be the second single, but it was a promo release only. She has also recorded a song \\"Mirrors and Smoke\\" with the band Jars of Clay on their album Good Monsters the same year. She also performed the song \\"A Place for Us\\" (written by Bryan Adams) with Tyler James for the 2007 Disney film Bridge to Terabithia. In 2007, Nash began a new band, Fauxliage, with Canadian band Delerium, which released a self-titled album on August 14, 2007. Nash, Megan Thompson and Kate York also started a Christian band called Thompson, York & Nash. They worked on a few songs that have been put on MySpace. However, none of the songs posted on their MySpace page have been formally released. In January 2008 Nash traveled to New Zealand for the annual Parachute Music Festival, where she performed acoustic covers of Sixpence None the Richer hits \\"Kiss Me \\" and \\"There She Goes\\". In late 2008, Nash toured with Delerium. Nash has since rejoined Sixpence and worked on a new EP My Dear Machine EP, and the Christmas album The Dawn of Grace with tour dates planned throughout 2008 in the States and Europe. Guitarist Tess Wiley returned to the band to support them on a European tour. Nash joined Open Wings-Broken Strings tour in late 2009, along with Ed Kowalczyk of Live and Art Alexakis of Everclear. In 2011 she released a worship album entitled Hymns and Sacred Songs, and in August 2012, she released Lost in Transition, her sixth studio album with Sixpence None the Richer. On September 18, 2015, Nash released her album: The State I'm In. She writes for BMG. In 2018, Nash released a cover of the Pretenders' 1986 single \\"Don't Get Me Wrong\\". In an interview, Nash stated that new music will be coming soon and will be crowd-funded.  Inspiration  Nash has two distinct poles of inspiration: her work with Sixpence in the Christian music sphere and her childhood fascination with older female country artists like Tanya Tucker, Loretta Lynn, and Patsy Cline. \\"I started singing country music and learning old country songs on the guitar when I was 12. I was really, really shy but just had this desire to get on stage and started calling clubs myself to ask if I could come down and sing\\", says Nash, who grew up in the Texas Hill Country town of New Braunfels.\\"http://www.newreleasetoday.com/artistdetail.php?artist_id=389\\" Leigh Nash Artist Profile, New Release Today Before long, the adolescent Nash was singing Loretta Lynn and Tanya Tucker songs like \\"You Ain't Woman Enough to Take My Man\\" and \\"Texas When I Die\\" on alcohol-free, open mic Sunday nights, backed by a middle-aged band of town locals. Later in life her interest in pop acts like the Sundays, Innocence Mission, and the Cranberries provided more formative material for her songwriting and singing.  Personal life  Nash is the younger of two sisters. She married PFR drummer Mark Nash in May 1996, whom she met while both bands were performing at the Cornerstone Festival in Illinois. They had one child (a son) together in 2004. The couple divorced in 2007. Nash married musician Stephen Wilson in 2011.

These trails were used by early settlers and freight companies, and helped to establish where the community of Twin Bridges would develop. Judge M.H. Lott came to Montana in 1862, and with his brother John T. Lott, settled in the Ruby Valley in 1864. In 1865 they built a bridge across the Beaverhead River, and later built another bridge across the Beaverhead at the Point of Rocks. The Lott brothers continued development of roads and promoted settlement of the town, which was incorporated in 1902, with M.H. Lott as the first mayor.

In 1961 the town and the surrounding area were designated a National Historic Landmark District, the Virginia City Historic District. The population was 190 at the 2010 census. History =Founding= Thomas Francis Meagher House, Virginia City In May 1863, a group of prospectors were headed toward the Yellowstone River and instead came upon a party of the Crow tribe and was forced to return to Bannack. On May 26, 1863, Bill Fairweather and Henry Edgar discovered gold near Alder Creek. The prospectors could not keep the site a secret and were followed on their return to the gold bearing site. A mining district was set up in order to formulate rules about individual gold claims. On June 16, 1863 under the name of \\"Verina\\" the township was formed a mile south of the gold fields. The name was intended to honor Varina Howell Davis, the first and only First Lady of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War. Verina, although in Union territory, was founded by men whose loyalties were thoroughly Confederate. Upon registration of the name, a Connecticut judge, G. G. Bissell, objected to their choice and recorded it as Virginia City. Within weeks Virginia City was a boomtown of thousands of prospectors and fortune seekers in the midst of a gold rush. The remote region of the Idaho Territory was without law enforcement or justice system with the exception of miners' courts. In late 1863, the great wealth in the region, lack of a justice system and the insecure means of travel gave rise to serious criminal activity, especially robbery and murder along the trails and roads of the region. Road agents as they became known were ultimately responsible for up to 100 deaths in the region in 1863 and 1864. This resulted in the formation of the Vigilance committee of Alder Gulch and the infamous Montana Vigilantes. Up to 15 road agents were hanged by the vigilantes in December 1863 and January 1864, including the sheriff of Bannack, Montana and alleged leader of the road agent gang, Henry Plummer. The Montana Territory was organized out of the existing Idaho Territory by Act of Congress and signed into law by President Abraham Lincoln on May 26, 1864. Although Bannack was the first territorial capital, the territorial legislature moved the capital to Virginia City on February 7, 1865. It remained the capital until April 19, 1875 when it moved to Helena, Montana. Thomas Dimsdale began publication of Montana's first newspaper, the Montana Post, in Virginia City on August 27, 1864. Montana's first public school was established in Virginia City in March 1866. Gilbert Brewery, Wallace Street, Virginia City, founded in 1866 by Henry S.

The ghost town of Virginia City began to be restored for tourism in the 1950s. Most of the city is now owned by the state government and is a National Historic Landmark operated as an open-air museum. Of the nearly three hundred structures in town, almost half were built prior to 1900.

Chapter 7: \\"Initiating Permanent Settlement\\" History Americans gave the location a generic name based on the ethnicity or language of the original settlers, namely French Canadians. The settlement was cofounded around 1858 by two French Canadians moving inland with their Metis families to escape turmoil further west that followed the arrival of the American federal authorities. Jean-Baptiste Ducharme left Puget Sound during the Indian Wars (1855-1856) abandoning his land claim as his Muck Creek neighbors were arrested under martial law. Louis Brown (anglicized name) left the Colville Valley turmoil a few years later with his Pend d'Oreille wife and Metis daughters. Meanwhile the Pend d'Oreilles Kalispel had moved upriver to a new locale accompanied by Jesuit priest Father Hoecken who relocated the Saint-Ignatius mission northeast of the future Frenchtown. Louis Brown Metis daughters and grandchildren married into the wave of French Canadian settlers that swept over the valley in the course of the last four decades of the 19th century.

Another source suggests that the town was called Clyde Park in honor of Clyde Durand, a local rancher; or for Harvey's Clydesdale horse. The Harvey and Tregloan Ranch eventually was sold to Robert Shiplet. The present-day Shiplet Ranch has historic barns that date to the 1870s or 80s, and its livestock brand is notably the shape of Montana.

Winnett ran away from home as a boy, seeking adventure in \\"Indian country.\\" His excellent marksmanship abilities helped him get jobs with outfits who were always looking for someone who could keep them in fresh meat. When he was captured by Sioux Indians and later adopted into the tribe, he was given the name Eagle Eyes because of his remarkable shooting skills. Winnett established a ranch in Montana Territory in 1879 near an active trading post and the Hangman's Tree used by vigilantes in the area. The massive ranch house, which he built in 1900 housed his own family and served as a gathering place for the community. Dances, weddings, funerals, church services, and school were all held here. Billings was the closest town, so Winnett built up a freight line business to haul supplies. Each of his outfits consisted of ten to twenty horses and huge wagons. In 1910 he built a store and petitioned for a post office.Winnett, Montana Community Information In addition to county government offices, Winnett's businesses and services include a grocery store, two filling stations, a post office, a school system with grades K-12, and two bar-and-grills; the hotel has closed, and the nearest medical facilities are in Lewistown.

Powell County Courthouse, Deer Lodge Deer Lodge is also the location of Grant-Kohrs Ranch National Historic Site, dedicated to the interpretation of the frontier cattle ranching era. This site was the home of Conrad Kohrs, one of the famous \\"Cattle Kings\\" of Montana whose land holdings once stretched over a million acres (4,000 km2) of Montana, Wyoming, and Alberta, Canada. The Grant-Kohrs ranch was built in 1862 by Johnny Grant, a Scottish/French/Metis fur-trader and trapper who encouraged his people to settle in Deer Lodge because of its pleasant climate and large areas of bunch grass prairie, ideal for raising cattle and horses. The city's name derives from a geological formation known as Warm Springs Mound which contained natural saline that made for a natural salt lick for the local deer population, the protected valley in which Deer Lodge is located was where most of the local wildlife would winter as the temperatures lowered in the high country. Deer Lodge was the site of the College of Montana, the first institution of higher learning in the state. History Extant mentions of the Deer Lodge Valley prior to 1860 are found as occasional remarks in records written for other purposes. Consistent record-keeping begins with the writings of Granville Stuart and others in the early 1860s., pp 46-56articles and advertisements - 1864-1869 1860 marks the beginning of permanent occupation of both the valley and the future site of the city of Deer Lodge by European-Americans., p. 118, Chapter 26 =Fur Trade Era= Before 1860, the Deer Lodge Valley was not the territory of any American Indian group. Gatherings were held there, including horse races. American Indian groups from the west, Flatheads, Pend d'Oreilles et al. passed through the valley as an alternative route to and from the buffalo hunting grounds to the east., Chapter XIX The first documented visit to this area by European-American explorers occurred in 1805‚Äì1806, when Lewis and Clark's Corps of Discovery expedition passed by the Deer Lodge Valley without entering it. Evidence of earlier incursion, probably by Spaniards, was noted by miners during the 1880s, at Race Track Lake on the west side of the Deer Lodge Valley., p. 67 Early European trapper/traders passing through the valley referred to it as \\"the Deer House Plains\\". The Clark Fork river was called the Arrow Stone river in the 1830s. By the 1850s it was called the Deer Lodge Creek/Hellgate River., Papers Annexed to Report: # 24, p. 342-345 Catholic Father Pierre-Jean De Smet brought the first wagons known to have passed through the valley, in 1841. In 1846, the Deer Lodge Valley became part of the United States and Oregon Territory with the signing of the Oregon Treaty by the U. S. and Great Britain. From 1853 to 1863 it was in Washington Territory, then briefly part of Idaho Territory until the creation of Montana Territory in 1864., p. 94 European-American settlement of the valley gained momentum during the 1850s and 60's, with the primary site being at present-day Deer Lodge. During the 1850s, trapper/traders from Fort Hall began wintering herds of horses and cattle in the valley. Also during that decade placer gold finds were made near present-day Gold Creek, first in 1852 by Francois (Bennetsee) Findley, followed in 1856 by Hereford, Saunders, Madison et al.,, p. 209 and in 1858-61 by James and Granville Stuart, Reese Anderson et al. In 1860‚Äì62, Lt. John Mullan oversaw construction of the Mullan Road, which connected Walla Walla, Washington Territory with Fort Benton, then in Dakota Territory. The Mullan Road passed through the north end of the Deer Lodge Valley. =European-American Settlement, Montana Gold Rush= Johnny Grant in his prime John Francis (Johnny) Grant built the first permanent structures in the valley in 1859‚Äì60, at Grantsville near present-day Garrison. Grant had begun grazing cattle and horse herds in the north valley several years previously and \\"wintered over\\" there in 1857‚Äì58. In 1860, feeling as he said \\"lonely\\", he returned to Fort Hall for summer trading and induced several fellow trader/trappers and their families to return to the valley with him at the end of the season. Instead of locating at Grantsville, his friends chose to build at the site of present-day Deer Lodge, where several Mexican trapper/traders and their Metis families had already established the seasonal settlement of Spanish Fork. While Johnny Grant had been at Fort Hall, several people had come from Fort Union down the Mullan Road route and begun building homes at Grantsville. In 1861, the Stuart brothers and Reese Anderson established American Fork near present-day Gold Creek. Also in that year Johnny Grant moved his large family to his newly built house at Deer Lodge, at the present- day site of Grant-Kohrs Ranch National Historic Site. During the next two years, placer gold discoveries at Grasshopper Creek, Alder Gulch and other locations to the south caused a population decline in the valley, including the abandoning of Grantsville and American Fork. Beginning in 1864 with gold strikes to the north, Deer Lodge City grew rapidly as a base for supplies to mines in the surrounding mountains. =Montana Territory= By 1861‚Äì2, Spanish Fork was more often referred to as Cottonwood. In 1862, a Deer Lodge Town Committee was established to lay out the town site, to be called LaBarge City, after Missouri River steamboat Captain Joseph LaBarge whose firm, LaBarge, Harkness & Company, had proposed to start a business in Cottonwood. Creation of Idaho Territory in 1863 induced a name change to Idaho City. And with the 1864 designation of Montana Territory, Deer Lodge City became the choice. Montana's first territorial legislature defined most of the boundaries of Deer Lodge County, establishing the county seat at the placer mining camp of Silver Bow City, near Butte. In September 1865, county voters transferred the seat to Deer Lodge City., p. 65 During the first half of the 1860s, Granville Stuart described valley social life as including many gay dances and parties, which was the way of the Metis. By 1866, Johnny Grant and many of his fellow Metis had become disenchanted with their increasingly numerous neighbors from \\"the States\\". In that year, Grant sold most of his Deer Lodge Valley holdings to Conrad Kohrs and in 1867 led a mass exodus of Metis families to the Red River country of Manitoba, Canada. In 1869, the Territorial Prison was located at Deer Lodge. Also that year, the town site plat for Deer Lodge City was recorded. In 1878, Montana Collegiate Institute was established at Deer Lodge City. It opened for classes in 1883 and closed in 1914. Attorney Horace Clagett, of the Deer Lodge firm Clagett and Dixon, was elected U.S. Representative from Montana Territory for the 1871‚Äì73 term. He was defeated for reelection by Martin Maginnis. Clagett was noted for introducing the legislation establishing Yellowstone National Park. Clagett's partner, William W. Dixon, later moved to Butte and upset Thomas H. Carter in 1891 to serve a single term as U.S. Representative from the State of Montana. Clagett and Dixon platted the first addition to Deer Lodge City, in 1872. Perhaps its most prominent building was the former St. Joseph's Hospital. =State of Montana, Powell County= Deer Lodge City was incorporated in 1888,, Book 1 with a mayor and aldermen as officers. Montana achieved statehood in 1889 and a battle ensued between Helena and Anaconda over the location of the capitol in which Helena finally triumphed in 1894., p. 95 In 1896, Anaconda took the Deer Lodge County seat away from Deer Lodge. This began a battle which culminated in the creation of Powell County in 1901, with its county seat at Deer Lodge. =Frank Conley= Mayoral portrait of Frank Conley, mayor of Deer Lodge, Montana (with breaks) from 1892 until 1928 After statehood, the State of Montana let a contract to run Montana State Prison, which was awarded to Frank Conley and Thomas McTague., p. 70 They held the contract until 1908. In that year, the State took over running Montana State Prison, appointing Frank Conley as warden. Conley remained in that capacity until 1921, when Governor Joseph M. Dixon replaced Conley with M. W. Potter. The Governor then commissioned an investigation of Conley's administration. This resulted in the MacDonald Report, which would be used as the basis for a civil lawsuit by the State of Montana against Conley. The year following, Montana Attorney General Wellington Rankin sued Conley for misuse of state funds and materials, in the case State of Montana vs Frank Conley The case took three months to try and resulted in the State of Montana being ordered to reimburse Conley., Chapter 8: THE CONLEY CASE Deer Lodge City celebrated with a victory party. Frank Conley was elected the fifth (1892‚Äì93), seventh (1895-1903) and tenth (1907-1928) mayor of Deer Lodge City.Picture and plaque at City Hall, Deer Lodge, Montana When he resigned for the last time, an article in the Billings Gazette called him 'the longest serving mayor in American history'. Mayor Conley was instrumental in bringing the division headquarters and shops of the Milwaukee Road to Deer Lodge City in 1910. Over the next decade, he presided over upbuilding the town's infrastructure to accommodate the rapidly expanding population. He was also responsible for the building of the City Hall. =Montana State Prison= In 1908, inmates W.A. Hayes and George Rock killed guard John Robinson and seriously wounded Warden Conley in an attempted prison breakout. In 1959, a prolonged riot occurred at the prison, led by Jerry Miles and Lee Smart, which resulted in the slaying of Deputy Warden Ted Rothe and the eventual suicides of Miles and Smart. All inmates were moved in 1977‚Äì79 to a new state prison facility outside of Deer Lodge. The town of Deer Lodge employs the Powell County Museum & Arts Foundation to manage the old facility as a museum. =Superfund Site= In the 1870s, Butte developed into a rich silver mining camp. Marcus Daly's discovery of rich copper veins in his Anaconda mine launched the Copper Kings era at Butte. In 1883, Daly established his smelter facilities at newly platted Anaconda, Montana. Anaconda immediately became Deer Lodge County's major population center and employer. Smelting activities at Butte and Anaconda left behind enormous amounts of toxic wastes. Flooding on Silver Bow Creek and Warm Springs Creek, particularly in the great valley flood of 1908, spread toxic wastes from Butte through Deer Lodge City, to the Milltown Dam, just east of Missoula. As a result of legal actions begun in 1983 and culminating in 2008, the course of the Clark Fork River from Anaconda to the Milltown Dam was declared to be a Superfund cleanup site. Cleanup costs are financed from the settlement with ARCO (now BP-ARCO). =Economic Decline= Interstate 90 bypassed Deer Lodge in 1960. In 1961, the Milwaukee Road ended its Olympian Hiawatha passenger trains. Limited passenger service between Minneapolis and Deer Lodge continued until 1964, at which time all Milwaukee Road passenger service to Deer Lodge ended. In the 1970s, the Anaconda Copper Company suffered financial setbacks which ultimately caused its 1977 merger with ARCO. By 1982, ARCO had closed down the smelter at Anaconda and stopped mining copper at Butte. In 1980, the Milwaukee Road shut down its western extension. All of its infrastructure from Seattle, Washington to Miles City, Montana was torn out, including the rails themselves. Geography Deer Lodge in 1869 Deer Lodge is located at (46.396183, -112.732922).

Daly is said to have wanted to begin business in the then county seat of Grantsdale, but was denied the opportunity. He supposedly founded Hamilton out of his own pocket as a reaction to being rebuffed at Grantsdale. The Ravalli County Museum, founded in 1955, is located in the former Ravalli County Courthouse and focuses on County history, natural history and art.

President Clinton declared a state of emergency in the area and dispatched National Guardsmen to assist with fighting the fires. Hamilton is, as of 2004, home to two microbiological research and production facilities: the government-run Rocky Mountain Laboratories, and a branch of the Corixa Corporation (bought in the late 1990s from Ribi ImmunoChem Research, Inc.).

The population was 1,809 at the 2010 census. Stevensville is officially recognized as the first permanent settlement of non-indigenous peoples in the state of Montana. Forty-eight years before Montana became the nation's 41st state, Stevensville was settled by Jesuit Missionaries at the request of the Bitterroot Salish tribe. History Through interactions with Iroquois working in the fur trade between 1812 and 1820, the Bitter Root Salish learned about Christianity and Jesuit missionaries (the Blackrobes as they were called) who worked with Native Americans teaching about agriculture, medicine, and religion. Interest in these \\"blackrobes\\" grew among the Salish and, in 1831, four young Salish men were dispatched to St. Louis, Missouri to request a priest to return with them to their homeland of present-day Stevensville. The four Salish men were directed to the home and office of William Clark (of Lewis and Clark fame) to make their request. At that time Clark was in charge of administering the territory they called home. Through the perils of their trip, two of the Salish died at the home of General Clark. The remaining two Salish men secured a visit with St. Louis Bishop Joseph Rosati, who assured them that missionaries would be sent to the Bitterroot Valley when funds and missionaries were available in the future. Again in 1835 and 1837 the Bitterroot Salish dispatched men to St. Louis to request missionaries, but to no avail. Finally in 1839 a group of Iroquois and Salish met Father Pierre-Jean DeSmet in Council Bluffs. The meeting resulted in Fr. DeSmet promising to fulfill their request for a missionary the following year. DeSmet arrived in present-day Stevensville on September 24, 1841, and called the settlement St. Mary's. Construction of a chapel immediately began, followed by other permanent structures including log cabins and Montana's first pharmacy. Father Ravalli, Jesuit priest and physician, was the builder. In 1850 Major John Owen arrived in the valley and set up camp north of St. Mary's. In time, Major Owen established a trading post and military strong point named Fort Owen, which served the settlers, the indigenous peoples, and missionaries in the valley. Both St. Mary's Mission and Fort Owen still have permanent structures that stand today in present-day Stevensville, denoting its historical past starting in 1841. The name of the settlement was changed from St. Mary's to Stevensville in 1864 to honor territorial governor Isaac Stevens. In the words of Luther E. Stanley, \\"When Isaac Ingle Stevens was ordered to Fort Owen in 1853, he came to what he supposed would be a military fort but much to his surprise, it was a trading post.

The population was 5,191 at the 2010 census. The city lies along the Yellowstone River and is in proximity to the badlands of the Dakotas. Sidney is approximately midway between Glendive, Montana and Williston, North Dakota. History Settlers began arriving in the area in the 1870s, and a post office was established in 1888. Six-year-old Sidney Walters and his parents were staying with Hiram Otis, the local justice of the peace, and Otis decided that Sidney was a good name for the town. The following year, Montana became a state and Sidney was incorporated in 1911. Sidney was originally part of Dawson County, but became the county seat of Richland County at its inception in 1914. Agriculture became an important part of the region after the Lower Yellowstone Irrigation Project was completed in 1909. A dam was built on the river south of Glendive, which diverted water from the river into a main canal, which runs north-south, parallel to the Yellowstone, irrigating land from Glendive north up to Fairview, where it dumps into the Missouri River. This project irrigates and serves water to 450 farms, according to the manager of the Lower Yellowstone Irrigation Districts. During the Great Depression, Montana artist J. K. Ralston painted a Federal Arts Project mural at the Richland County Courthouse in Sidney. The area experienced an oil boom and bust in the late 1970s and early 1980s, bringing an influx of people to the town for a short period of time. Around the start of the 21st century, the town started experiencing another surge in oil exploration activity. The town's museum, the MonDak Heritage Center, was founded in 1967. The museum houses artifacts and archives that detail the history of life in eastern Montana and western North Dakota since the first pioneers arrived in the late 19th century. Economy Sidney relies heavily on farming, ranching, and oil production for economic stability. The surrounding countryside is populated with many farms and cattle ranches, plus oil exploration activity.

The population was 714 at the 2010 census. History Culbertson was created in June 1887 following the arrival of the Great Northern Railway, then known as the St. Paul, Minneapolis & Manitoba Railway. The town was named after Major Alexander Culbertson, former head of the American Fur Company's Fort Union, to the east. The settlement of Culbertson followed hard on the heels of the 1886-87 watershed years for the early cattle industry. As a result, the first settlers in the area raised horses for the US Cavalry‚Äôs various Montana and Dakota posts. As cattle prices slowly rebounded, the range was once again stocked with cattle, though the second wave of cattlemen utilized hardy English breeds instead of the Texas longhorns of the earlier outfits. With the passage of new homestead laws in 1909 enabling homesteaders to take out larger acreages, the area saw an influx of dryland farmers. With its railroad connection, Culbertson became the center of the area‚Äôs agricultural trade. When the agricultural boom went bust after World War II and never resumed its former glory, Culbertson saw a gradual decline in businesses and population. This was somewhat ameliorated by a heavy railroad presence in the community. Culbertson also became a surviving center as smaller adjacent communities dried up in the agricultural depression of the 1920s and 1930s. With better automobiles and better roads, farmers and ranchers could live farther from centers of trade.

The population was 2,214 at the 2010 census. Established in 1924 and incorporated as a city in 1998, Colstrip is the largest city in Rosebud County with 24% of the total population. Colstrip's primary industries are coal mining and electricity production. For the Sports Illustrated Magazine's 50th anniversary, it named Colstrip the top sports town in Montana. The entire community celebrates Colstrip Days annually on the weekend prior to the 4th of July. History Open pit strip mining with shovels at Colstrip's Rosebud Mine Colstrip was established by the Northern Pacific Railway in 1924 as a company town to provide coal for their steam locomotives. The mining at Rosebud Mine two miles south of the town is open pit strip mining, where draglines remove soil above the layer of bituminous coal from the Fort Union Formation. During World War II, the Colstrip mine was identified as strategically important because it supplied coal for the Northern Pacific Railway steam locomotives hauling military equipment for the war effort. The mine was guarded from sabotage, and the employees were not allowed to quit their jobs. In 1958 the railroad switched to using diesel locomotives and the Colstrip mine was shut down. In 1959 Montana Power Company purchased the rights to the mine and the town, and resumed mining operations in the 1970s with plans to build coal-fired electrical plants. The power plants were built in the 1970s and 1980s by a collection of contractors including Bechtel. During this construction period Colstrip was a boomtown, with a large increase in population. Plants 1 & 2 were operational in 1975 and 1976, and plants 3 & 4 were operational in 1984 and 1986. Colstrip Power Plants 1-4 from right to left The Rosebud mine in 2006, taken from the International Space Station In 1974 construction of Colstrip's Castle Rock Lake (formerly named surge pond) was completed. The Colstrip plants produce electricity from coal using steam. The water for the steam is pumped in an underground pipe from the Yellowstone River and stored in the lake. The lake is stocked with fish and the home for a wide variety of wildlife. In 1990 the Colstrip Energy Limited Project started commercial operations. Located six miles (10 km) north of Colstrip, this experimental electricity production facility is owned by Rosebud Energy Corp., a partnership that at one point included Enron. The plant uses high sulfur waste coal from the Rosebud Coal Mine's topmost one foot layer of coal. In 1998 plants 1-4 were sold to a group led by PPL Corporation (PPL) and Puget Sound Energy (PSE). The Rosebud Coal Mine was sold to Westmoreland Mining LLC. In this same year the City of Colstrip was incorporated. As of June 2015, PPL spun off its power generation assets including the Colstrip plants to become Talen Energy. In 2016, Puget Sound Energy reached an agreement with the Sierra Club and the Montana Environmental Information Center to shut down units 1 and 2 of the coal-fired generating plant by the year 2022. The agreement said nothing about the status of Units 3 and 4 at the generating station. However, the existing electrical transmission capacity that transmits power from Colstrip to the Pacific Northwest may be used to transmit wind energy. In June 2019, Talen Energy announced the closure of two of the four coal burning units by the end of the year. The power plant is \\"the sixth-largest source of greenhouse emissions in the U.S.\\" Units 3 and 4 will remain in operation. In January 2020, Puget Sound Energy announced that Unit 1 ceased operating in the \\"first days of January\\", and Unit 2 ceased operating on January 4. Units 3 and 4 will remain operational as planned, but will be closed within the next five years. Colstrip is the proposed junction point of the BNSF Railway's trackage through the city with the proposed Tongue River Railroad south to new coal mines near the Wyoming border.

Another striking feature of Heron's climate is the patterned, extremely large seasonal variation in diurnal temperature range: only 10-11 degrees in the wettest months, November through January, expanding to nearly 35 degrees in the driest months, July and August, reflecting prevalent low humidity during those months. Around 11 days per year reach 90 F., while 100 F. is a very rare occurrence. Nights are cool year round with freezes having been recorded in every month. On average, the lowest temperature each year is -12 F., placing Heron in hardiness zone 5B. Average monthly precipitation is very high by Montana standards, especially in the wettest months of November through January, but Heron experiences continuing moderately wet conditions each month from February to June. In May and June, Heron shares with the rest of Montana some frequency of shower and thunderstorm activity, making these the wettest months in virtually all other areas of Montana, but not in Heron due to its exceptionally wet winters. Overall, Heron's average annual precipitation cycle is similar to that of the Pacific Northwest in its dry summer and wet winter (with a November maximum, as in Seattle, WA), but somewhat transitional into the typical Montana and Wyoming pattern of a May or June maximum, reflected in Heron's continued relatively high rainfall those months. The combination of these factors with possible orographic lift results in Heron being one of the wettest locations in Montana, mostly a dry state elsewhere.

February 21, 1921 ‚Äì November 24, 2002) was an American moral and political philosopher in the liberal tradition. Rawls received both the Schock Prize for Logic and Philosophy and the National Humanities Medal in 1999, the latter presented by President Bill Clinton, in recognition of how Rawls' work \\"helped a whole generation of learned Americans revive their faith in democracy itself.\\" In 1990, Will Kymlicka wrote in his introduction to the field that \\"it is generally accepted that the recent rebirth of normative political philosophy began with the publication of John Rawls's A Theory of Justice in 1971.\\" Rawls has often been described as one of the most influential political philosophers of the 20th century. He has the unusual distinction among contemporary political philosophers of being frequently cited by the courts of law in the United States and Canada and referred to by practicing politicians in the United States and the United Kingdom. Rawls's theory of \\"justice as fairness\\" recommends equal basic rights, equality of opportunity, and promoting the interests of the least advantaged members of society. Rawls's argument for these principles of social justice uses a thought experiment called the \\"original position,\\" in which people select what kind of society they would choose to live under if they did not know which social position they would personally occupy. In his later work Political Liberalism (1993), Rawls turned to the question of how political power could be made legitimate given reasonable disagreement about the nature of the good life. Biography =Early life= Rawls was born in Baltimore, Maryland. He was the second of five sons born to William Lee Rawls, a prominent Baltimore attorney, and Anna Abell Stump Rawls.Freeman, 2010:xix Tragedy struck Rawls at a young age: > Two of his brothers died in childhood because they had contracted fatal > illnesses from him. ... In 1928, the seven-year-old Rawls contracted > diphtheria. His brother Bobby, younger by 20 months, visited him in his room > and was fatally infected.

Upon graduation in 1939, Rawls attended Princeton University, where he graduated summa cum laude and was accepted into The Ivy Club and the American Whig- Cliosophic Society. At Princeton, Rawls was influenced by Norman Malcolm, Wittgenstein's student. During his last two years at Princeton, he \\"became deeply concerned with theology and its doctrines.\\" He considered attending a seminary to study for the Episcopal priesthoodJoshua Cohen and Thomas Nagel, \\"John Rawls: On My Religion\\", Times Literary Supplement, 18 March 2009 and wrote an \\"intensely religious senior thesis (BI).\\" In his 181-page long thesis titled \\"Meaning of Sin and Faith,\\" Rawls attacked Pelagianism because it \\"would render the Cross of Christ to no effect.\\"http://arks.princeton.edu/ark:/88435/dsp01tt44pn90s His argument was partly drawn from Karl Marx's book On the Jewish Question, which criticized the idea that natural inequality in ability could be a just determiner of the distribution of wealth in society. Even after Rawls became an atheist, many of the anti-Pelagian arguments he used were repeated in A Theory of Justice. He completed his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1943, and enlisted in the Army in February of that year.Article by Iain King, titled Thinker at War: Rawls, published in Military History Monthly, 13 June 2014, accessed 20 November 2014. =Military service, 1943‚Äì46= During World War II, Rawls served as an infantryman in the Pacific, where he toured New Guinea and was awarded a Bronze Star;\\"His first experience of combat was in New Guinea ‚Äì a country which saw fighting for almost the whole duration of the Pacific campaign ‚Äì where he won a Bronze Star.\\" From article by Iain King, titled Thinker at War: Rawls, published in Military History Monthly, 13 June 2014, accessed 20 November 2014. and the Philippines, where he endured intensive trench warfare and witnessed traumatizing scenes of violence and bloodshed.\\"One soldier in a dugout close to Rawls stood up and deliberately removed his helmet to take a bullet to the head, choosing to die rather than endure the constant barrage. ...

Rawls returned to Princeton to pursue a doctorate in moral philosophy. He married Margaret Warfield Fox, a Brown University graduate, in 1949. They had four children, Anne Warfield, Robert Lee, Alexander Emory, and Elizabeth Fox. Rawls received his Ph.D. from Princeton in 1950 after completing a doctoral dissertation titled A Study in the Grounds of Ethical Knowledge: Considered with Reference to Judgments on the Moral Worth of Character. Rawls taught there until 1952 when he received a Fulbright Fellowship to Oxford University (Christ Church), where he was influenced by the liberal political theorist and historian Isaiah Berlin and the legal theorist H. L. A. Hart. After returning to the United States he served first as an assistant and then associate professor at Cornell University. In 1962, he became a full professor of philosophy at Cornell, and soon achieved a tenured position at MIT. That same year, he moved to Harvard University, where he taught for almost forty years and where he trained some of the leading contemporary figures in moral and political philosophy, including Thomas Nagel, Allan Gibbard, Onora O'Neill, Adrian Piper, Elizabeth S. Anderson, Christine Korsgaard, Susan Neiman, Claudia Card, Thomas Pogge, T. M. Scanlon, Barbara Herman, Joshua Cohen, Thomas E. Hill Jr., Gurcharan Das, Andreas Teuber, Samuel Freeman and Paul Weithman. He held the James Bryant Conant University Professorship at Harvard. =Later life= Rawls seldom gave interviews and, having both a stutter (partially caused by the deaths of two of his brothers, who died through infections contracted from Rawls) and a \\"bat-like horror of the limelight,\\"Rogers, 27.09.02 did not become a public intellectual despite his fame. He instead remained committed mainly to his academic and family life. In 1995, he suffered the first of several strokes, severely impeding his ability to continue to work. He was nevertheless able to complete The Law of Peoples, the most complete statement of his views on international justice, and shortly before his death in November 2002 published Justice As Fairness: A Restatement, a response to criticisms of A Theory of Justice. Rawls died on 24 November 2002 and is buried at the Mount Auburn Cemetery in Massachusetts. He was survived by his wife, Mard Rawls, and their four children, and four grandchildren. Philosophical thought Rawls published three main books. The first, A Theory of Justice, focused on distributive justice and attempted to reconcile the competing claims of the values of freedom and equality. The second, Political Liberalism, addressed the question of how citizens divided by intractable religious and philosophical disagreements could come to endorse a constitutional democratic regime. The third, The Law of Peoples, focused on the issue of global justice. =A Theory of Justice= Rawls's magnum opus titled A Theory of Justice, published in 1971, aimed to resolve the seemingly competing claims of freedom and equality. The shape Rawls's resolution took, however, was not that of a balancing act that compromised or weakened the moral claim of one value compared with the other. Rather, his intent was to show that notions of freedom and equality could be integrated into a seamless unity he called justice as fairness. By attempting to enhance the perspective which his readers should take when thinking about justice, Rawls hoped to show the supposed conflict between freedom and equality to be illusory. Rawls's A Theory of Justice (1971) includes a thought experiment he called the \\"original position.\\" The intuition motivating its employment is this: the enterprise of political philosophy will be greatly benefited by a specification of the correct standpoint a person should take in his or her thinking about justice. When we think about what it would mean for a just state of affairs to obtain between persons, we eliminate certain features (such as hair or eye color, height, race, etc.) and fixate upon others. Rawls's original position is meant to encode all of our intuitions about which features are relevant, and which irrelevant, for the purposes of deliberating well about justice. The original position is Rawls' hypothetical scenario in which a group of persons is set the task of reaching an agreement about the kind of political and economic structure they want for a society, which they will then occupy. Each individual, however, deliberates behind a \\"veil of ignorance\\": each lacks knowledge, for example, of his or her gender, race, age, intelligence, wealth, skills, education and religion. The only thing that a given member knows about themselves is that they are in possession of the basic capacities necessary to fully and willfully participate in an enduring system of mutual cooperation; each knows they can be a member of the society. Rawls posits two basic capacities that the individuals would know themselves to possess. First, individuals know that they have the capacity to form, pursue, and revise a conception of the good, or life plan. Exactly what sort of conception of the good this is, however, the individual does not yet know. It may be, for example, religious or secular, but at the start, the individual in the original position does not know which. Second, each individual understands him or herself to have the capacity to develop a sense of justice and a generally effective desire to abide by it. Knowing only these two features of themselves, the group will deliberate in order to design a social structure, during which each person will seek his or her maximal advantage. The idea is that proposals that we would ordinarily think of as unjust ‚Äì such as that black people or women should not be allowed to hold public office ‚Äì will not be proposed, in this, Rawls' original position, because it would be irrational to propose them. The reason is simple: one does not know whether he himself would be a woman or a black person. This position is expressed in the difference principle, according to which, in a system of ignorance about one's status, one would strive to improve the position of the worst off, because he might find himself in that position. Rawls develops his original position by modeling it, in certain respects at least, after the \\"initial situations\\" of various social contract thinkers who came before him, including Thomas Hobbes, John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Each social contractarian constructs his/her initial situation somewhat differently, having in mind a unique political morality s/he intends the thought experiment to generate.Nussbaum, Martha; Frontiers of Justice; Harvard U Press; Cambridge, Massachusetts; 2006; Kindle location 1789 Iain King has suggested the original position draws on Rawls' experiences in post-war Japan, where the US Army was challenged with designing new social and political authorities for the country, while \\"imagining away all that had gone before.\\"\\"Deciding what this new (Japanese) society should look like was the task of the Supreme Command for the Allied Powers, and Rawls took this question ‚Äì what should the rules of a society be ‚Äì back to the US. But only in 1971 did he come up with a comprehensive answer. His theory starts by imagining away all that had gone before, just as the past had been erased in Hiroshima.\\" Taken from Thinker at War: Rawls, published in Military History Magazine, 13 June 2014, accessed 20 November 2014. In social justice processes, each person early on makes decisions about which features of persons to consider and which to ignore. Rawls's aspiration is to have created a thought experiment whereby a version of that process is carried to its completion, illuminating the correct standpoint a person should take in his or her thinking about justice. If he has succeeded, then the original position thought experiment may function as a full specification of the moral standpoint we should attempt to achieve when deliberating about social justice. In setting out his theory, Rawls described his method as one of \\"reflective equilibrium,\\" a concept which has since been used in other areas of philosophy. Reflective equilibrium is achieved by mutually adjusting one's general principles and one's considered judgements on particular cases, to bring the two into line with one another. Principles of justice Rawls derives two principles of justice from the original position. The first of these is the Liberty Principle, which establishes equal basic liberties for all citizens. 'Basic' liberty entails the (familiar in the liberal tradition) freedoms of conscience, association and expression as well as democratic rights; Rawls also includes a personal property right, but this is defended in terms of moral capacities and self-respect, rather than an appeal to a natural right of self-ownership (this distinguishes Rawls's account from the classical liberalism of John Locke and the libertarianism of Robert Nozick). Rawls argues that a second principle of equality would be agreed upon to guarantee liberties that represent meaningful options for all in society and ensure distributive justice. For example, formal guarantees of political voice and freedom of assembly are of little real worth to the desperately poor and marginalized in society. Demanding that everyone have exactly the same effective opportunities in life would almost certainly offend the very liberties that are supposedly being equalized. Nonetheless, we would want to ensure at least the \\"fair worth\\" of our liberties: wherever one ends up in society, one wants life to be worth living, with enough effective freedom to pursue personal goals. Thus participants would be moved to affirm a two-part second principle comprising Fair Equality of Opportunity and the famous (and controversial) difference principle. This second principle ensures that those with comparable talents and motivation face roughly similar life chances and that inequalities in society work to the benefit of the least advantaged. Rawls held that these principles of justice apply to the \\"basic structure\\" of fundamental social institutions (such as the judiciary, the economic structure and the political constitution), a qualification that has been the source of some controversy and constructive debate (see the work of Gerald Cohen). Rawls‚Äô theory of justice stakes out the task of equalizing the distribution of primary social goods to those least advantaged in society and thus may be seen as a largely political answer to the question of justice, with matters of morality somewhat conflated into a political account of justice and just institutions. Relational approaches to the question of justice, by contrast, seek to examine the connections between individuals and focuses on their relations in societies, with respect to how these relationships are established and configured.Young Kim, Justice as Right Actions: An Original Theory of Justice in Conversation with Major Contemporary Accounts (Lexington Books, 2015)(); Iris Marion Young, Justice and the Politics of Difference (Oxford University Press, 1990). Rawls further argued that these principles were to be 'lexically ordered' to award priority to basic liberties over the more equality-oriented demands of the second principle. This has also been a topic of much debate among moral and political philosophers. Finally, Rawls took his approach as applying in the first instance to what he called a \\"well- ordered society ... designed to advance the good of its members and effectively regulated by a public conception of justice.\\" In this respect, he understood justice as fairness as a contribution to \\"ideal theory,\\" the determination of \\"principles that characterize a well-ordered society under favorable circumstances.\\" Much recent work in political philosophy has asked what justice as fairness might dictate (or indeed, whether it is very useful at all) for problems of \\"partial compliance\\" under \\"nonideal theory.\\" =Political Liberalism= First edition of Political Liberalism In Political Liberalism (1993), Rawls turned towards the question of political legitimacy in the context of intractable philosophical, religious, and moral disagreement amongst citizens regarding the human good. Such disagreement, he insisted, was reasonable ‚Äì the result of the free exercise of human rationality under the conditions of open enquiry and free conscience that the liberal state is designed to safeguard. The question of legitimacy in the face of reasonable disagreement was urgent for Rawls because his own justification of Justice as Fairness relied upon a Kantian conception of the human good that can be reasonably rejected. If the political conception offered in A Theory of Justice can only be shown to be good by invoking a controversial conception of human flourishing, it is unclear how a liberal state ordered according to it could possibly be legitimate. The intuition animating this seemingly new concern is actually no different from the guiding idea of A Theory of Justice, namely that the fundamental charter of a society must rely only on principles, arguments and reasons that cannot be reasonably rejected by the citizens whose lives will be limited by its social, legal, and political circumscriptions. In other words, the legitimacy of a law is contingent upon its justification being impossible to reasonably reject. This old insight took on a new shape, however, when Rawls realized that its application must extend to the deep justification of Justice as Fairness itself, which he had presented in terms of a reasonably rejectable (Kantian) conception of human flourishing as the free development of autonomous moral agency. The core of Political Liberalism, accordingly, is its insistence that, in order to retain its legitimacy, the liberal state must commit itself to the \\"ideal of public reason.\\" This roughly means that citizens in their public capacity must engage one another only in terms of reasons whose status as reasons is shared between them. Political reasoning, then, is to proceed purely in terms of \\"public reasons.\\" For example: a Supreme Court justice deliberating on whether or not the denial to homosexuals of the ability to marry constitutes a violation of the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause may not advert to his religious convictions on the matter, but he may take into account the argument that a same-sex household provides sub-optimal conditions for a child's development. This is because reasons based upon the interpretation of sacred text are non- public (their force as reasons relies upon faith commitments that can be reasonably rejected), whereas reasons that rely upon the value of providing children with environments in which they may develop optimally are public reasons ‚Äì their status as reasons draws upon no deep, controversial conception of human flourishing. Rawls held that the duty of civility ‚Äì the duty of citizens to offer one another reasons that are mutually understood as reasons ‚Äì applies within what he called the \\"public political forum.\\" This forum extends from the upper reaches of government ‚Äì for example the supreme legislative and judicial bodies of the society ‚Äì all the way down to the deliberations of a citizen deciding for whom to vote in state legislatures or how to vote in public referenda. Campaigning politicians should also, he believed, refrain from pandering to the non-public religious or moral convictions of their constituencies. The ideal of public reason secures the dominance of the public political values ‚Äì freedom, equality, and fairness ‚Äì that serve as the foundation of the liberal state. But what about the justification of these values? Since any such justification would necessarily draw upon deep (religious or moral) metaphysical commitments which would be reasonably rejectable, Rawls held that the public political values may only be justified privately by individual citizens. The public liberal political conception and its attendant values may and will be affirmed publicly (in judicial opinions and presidential addresses, for example) but its deep justifications will not. The task of justification falls to what Rawls called the \\"reasonable comprehensive doctrines\\" and the citizens who subscribe to them. A reasonable Catholic will justify the liberal values one way, a reasonable Muslim another, and a reasonable secular citizen yet another way. One may illustrate Rawls's idea using a Venn diagram: the public political values will be the shared space upon which overlap numerous reasonable comprehensive doctrines. Rawls's account of stability presented in A Theory of Justice is a detailed portrait of the compatibility of one ‚Äì Kantian ‚Äì comprehensive doctrine with justice as fairness. His hope is that similar accounts may be presented for many other comprehensive doctrines. This is Rawls's famous notion of an \\"overlapping consensus.\\" Such a consensus would necessarily exclude some doctrines, namely, those that are \\"unreasonable,\\" and so one may wonder what Rawls has to say about such doctrines. An unreasonable comprehensive doctrine is unreasonable in the sense that it is incompatible with the duty of civility. This is simply another way of saying that an unreasonable doctrine is incompatible with the fundamental political values a liberal theory of justice is designed to safeguard ‚Äì freedom, equality and fairness. So one answer to the question of what Rawls has to say about such doctrines is ‚Äì nothing. For one thing, the liberal state cannot justify itself to individuals (such as religious fundamentalists) who hold to such doctrines, because any such justification would ‚Äì as has been noted ‚Äì proceed in terms of controversial moral or religious commitments that are excluded from the public political forum. But, more importantly, the goal of the Rawlsian project is primarily to determine whether or not the liberal conception of political legitimacy is internally coherent, and this project is carried out by the specification of what sorts of reasons persons committed to liberal values are permitted to use in their dialogue, deliberations and arguments with one another about political matters. The Rawlsian project has this goal to the exclusion of concern with justifying liberal values to those not already committed ‚Äì or at least open ‚Äì to them. Rawls's concern is with whether or not the idea of political legitimacy fleshed out in terms of the duty of civility and mutual justification can serve as a viable form of public discourse in the face of the religious and moral pluralism of modern democratic society, not with justifying this conception of political legitimacy in the first place. Rawls also modified the principles of justice as follows (with the first principle having priority over the second, and the first half of the second having priority over the latter half): # Each person has an equal claim to a fully adequate scheme of basic rights and liberties, which scheme is compatible with the same scheme for all; and in this scheme the equal political liberties, and only those liberties, are to be guaranteed their fair value. # Social and economic inequalities are to satisfy two conditions: first, they are to be attached to positions and offices open to all under conditions of fair equality of opportunity; and second, they are to be to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged members of society. These principles are subtly modified from the principles in Theory. The first principle now reads \\"equal claim\\" instead of \\"equal right,\\" and he also replaces the phrase \\"system of basic liberties\\" with \\"a fully adequate scheme of equal basic rights and liberties.\\" The two parts of the second principle are also switched, so that the difference principle becomes the latter of the three. =The Law of Peoples= Although there were passing comments on international affairs in A Theory of Justice, it was not until late in his career that Rawls formulated a comprehensive theory of international politics with the publication of The Law of Peoples. He claimed there that \\"well-ordered\\" peoples could be either \\"liberal\\" or \\"decent.\\" Rawls's basic distinction in international politics is that his preferred emphasis on a society of peoples is separate from the more conventional and historical discussion of international politics as based on relationships between states. Rawls argued that the legitimacy of a liberal international order is contingent on tolerating decent peoples, which differ from liberal peoples, among other ways, in that they might have state religions and deny adherents of minority faiths the right to hold positions of power within the state, and might organize political participation via consultation hierarchies rather than elections. However, no well-ordered peoples may violate human rights or behave in an externally aggressive manner. Peoples that fail to meet the criteria of \\"liberal\\" or \\"decent\\" peoples are referred to as 'outlaw states,' 'societies burdened by unfavourable conditions' or \\"benevolent absolutisms' depending on their particular failings. Such peoples do not have the right to mutual respect and toleration possessed by liberal and decent peoples. Rawls's views on global distributive justice as they were expressed in this work surprised many of his fellow egalitarian liberals. For example, Charles Beitz had previously written a study that argued for the application of Rawls's Difference Principles globally. Rawls denied that his principles should be so applied, partly on the grounds that states, unlike citizens, were self- sufficient in the cooperative enterprises that constitute domestic societies. Although Rawls recognized that aid should be given to governments which are unable to protect human rights for economic reasons, he claimed that the purpose for this aid is not to achieve an eventual state of global equality, but rather only to ensure that these societies could maintain liberal or decent political institutions. He argued, among other things, that continuing to give aid indefinitely would see nations with industrious populations subsidize those with idle populations and would create a moral hazard problem where governments could spend irresponsibly in the knowledge that they will be bailed out by those nations who had spent responsibly. Rawls's discussion of \\"non-ideal\\" theory, on the other hand, included a condemnation of bombing civilians and of the American bombing of German and Japanese cities in World War II, as well as discussions of immigration and nuclear proliferation. He also detailed here the ideal of the statesman, a political leader who looks to the next generation and promotes international harmony, even in the face of significant domestic pressure to act otherwise. Rawls also controversially claimed that violations of human rights can legitimize military intervention in the violating states, though he also expressed the hope that such societies could be induced to reform peacefully by the good example of liberal and decent peoples.

History Walkerville is a suburb of Butte, Montana and is home to some of the earliest mining sites in the area. These sites attracted many investors to Walkerville in the late 1800s. Walkerville is named for four of those investors: brothers Joseph, Samuel, Matthew and David Walker of Salt Lake City; they had purchased the lucrative Alice mine upon recommendation by their agent (and later Copper King) Marcus Daly. There were many different types of materials mined depending on the location of a given site. Copper and silver were two of the most commonly mined materials. In 1893, silver prices dropped, but the town's economy continued to thrive due to its copper production.http://southwestmt.com/communities/walkerville.htm Walkerville's economic success continued until 1918 when the end of World War I caused copper prices to drop as well. In 2015, nearly all of the town's many mines are abandoned. Some of these sites have become very dangerous and plans are being made to restore or remove them.http://epa.gov/aml/tech/silverbow- case.pdf References External links * Butte History and \\"Lost Butte\\": Walkerville, 1881 Category:Towns in Silver Bow County, Montana ","title":"Walkerville, Montana"},{"id":"123628","text":"Absarokee ( ) is a census-designated place (CDP) in Stillwater County, Montana, United States, approximately south of Columbus on Highway 78.

U of Nebraska Press, 2005 History Absarokee was founded just north of the Second Crow Agency (sometimes referred to as the Absaroka Agency) in 1892. The Crow Agency was the headquarters of the Crow Tribe's reservation that was established by the Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868). That original reservation extended to more than 35 million acres with the first Crow Agency located at Fort Parker near modern Livingston, Montana in 1869. As miners encroached, the reservation was reduced to 8 million acres in 1875 with a location south of modern Absarokee established as Second Crow Agency (1875-1884). It was during this time that the Crow were forced to give up nomadic free lifestyles to one totally under the control of the US government. They were not allowed to leave the reservation, bison was replaced with US issued beef rations, and the tribe was hit by several measles and scarlet feaver epidemics. Finally, by 1884 further miner encroachment led to the creation of the third and current Crow Agency 60 miles SE of Billings on the Little Bighorn River. Most of the Absaroka Agency Fort was destroyed in a fire in 1891.History revisited during trip to Absaroka Agency May 18, 2013 9:30 pm ‚Ä¢ By Susan Olp http://billingsgazette.com/news/state-and-regional/montana/history-revisited- during-trip-to-absaroka- agency/article_127caffe-3e1d-5e7a-9e80-8d8edea19c4c.html#ixzz2WEro1BjR With the Homestead Acts of the 1860s and the westward expansion of the railroad, more settlers came to Montana. Not until October 15, 1892, did the federal government through a Benjamin Harrison proclamation open the land around Absarokee for settlement as part of a 1.8 million-acre land cession agreed to by Crow tribal leaders two years earlier after bowing to political pressure.http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=71121 Eleven days earlier on October 4, Sever Simonson and his family had arrived and established squatter's rights at the confluence of the Stillwater and East Rosebud Rivers.NRHS Simonson and his nephew, Oliver H. Hovda, built a log hotel and together established a trading post (later the Absarokee Cooperative Trading Co.). This was followed by a saloon, livery stable, and blacksmith shop. A post office was established December 16, 1892 in Simonson's home, where he served as Absarokee's postmaster.

Two older buildings on the campus are no longer used for educational purposes. The new high school (1989) is shared by both the junior high school and high school students. Absarokee High School is a class C school (less than 132 students) which helps determine athletic competitions. The most notable difference in class C schools is that they play eight-man football, which is basically eleven-man football with no tackles and one split-end instead of two wide receivers. Absarokee's sport teams are called the Huskies and the school colors are orange and black.

The population was 708 at the 2010 census. Fairfield is the self-proclaimed \\"Malting Barley Capital of the World\\" with of irrigated cropland and of non-irrigated cropland in production for the purpose of raising malt barley in the vicinity. Fairfield began as a station on the Milwaukee and is between Great Falls and Choteau and near Freezeout Lake, (from Cheney's Names on the Face of Montana, Mountain Press Publishing Company) where as many as 300,000 snow geese and 10,000 tundra swans gather in March. Fairfield serves as a trading center for the farmers of Greenfield Bench. Irrigation now assures crops, but in earlier days a dry summer made the grass scarce and the name \\"Freeze-out Bench\\" was applied to the area. \\"Greenfield Bench\\" and Fairfield are now descriptive of the hay and grain fields surrounding the town. Even though the federal government had opened this area of Montana to homesteading in 1862, not until 1909 did settlers really come into the Fairfield area when Congress liberalized this act allowing the settler 320 acres of free land instead of 160. It became apparent, however, that the small homesteads, 160 or 320 acres, made little sense in the vast and dry landscape of Montana. After the Bureau of Reclamation conducted a survey that showed a dam could be built in the Sun River Canyon and water for irrigation in Fairfield area would be feasible were many more settlers attracted to Fairfield. The Gibson Dam was completed in 1929. Today, Greenfield Irrigation District delivers water from Gibson Dam to approximately 83,000 acres surrounding this community.

The population was 312 at the 2010 census. Geography Hysham is located at (46.290535, -107.229929). According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land. Hysham is bordered to the north by the Yellowstone River. The surrounding area is composed of rolling hills and farmland. History When the Montana Territory became the state of Montana in 1889 the future site of Hysham was just a blank spot in the rolling prairie along the Yellowstone River. At that time, the area was within sprawling Custer County, which covered much of eastern Montana, and also included the eastern part of the Crow Indian Reservation. The area was opened up to homesteading in 1906 after the federal government moved the Crow Indian Reservation boundary further west to its present location. This made possible the development of farms and ranches throughout the area and at the same time allowed the settlement of small towns like Hysham (Cheney 1984). The location and founding of the town of Hysham is intertwined with its ranching and railroad history. A large cattle ranch, the Flying E, ran thousands of heads of cattle in the region. Charlie J. Hysham had moved from the town of Red Oak, Iowa, to manage the ranch. In order to facilitate the delivery of the large amounts of supplies the Flying E ranch required, the Northern Pacific Railroad built a siding to unload goods and materials that Hysham had ordered from Billings and Forsyth. In 1907, the siding became the nucleus for the town of Hysham. (Cheney 1984; Kimball 1976). James O. Lockard built the first building on the future site of Hysham shortly after the area was open to homesteading. Later, his homestead south of the railroad tracks would become the \\"Lockard Addition\\" in Hysham. The general store was located north of the railroad tracks and also served as Hysham‚Äôs first post office with Lockard appointed the first postmaster. Hysham slowly grew by a general process typical throughout the frontier where an initial commercial or transportation need would establish the site, which would then grow as settlers homesteaded nearby. This would, in turn, resulted in the need for other commercial enterprises followed by schools, churches, banks, government and other civic institutions (Cheney 1984; Kimball 1976; Sanborn 1920). In 1906 there were two stores, a lumber yard and a blacksmith shop. The first school at the growing community was built in 1908. Ada Channel, who had a homestead near the railroad siding, became the school's first teacher. She was also a key figure in the formation of Hysham. This same year, she worked to locate a town site with the help of James Lockard and F. L. Baker. The three town founders plotted town lots on of Channel's homestead. E. C. Sampson completed the process with a survey, which established the town's streets. Two other additions were added later. The First Addition added south of the original site and the Rogers Addition was established north of the railroad depot. Even though Charlie Hysham had moved away from the area by this time, the new town was named Hysham in his honor. The town was officially incorporated in 1916 (Sanborn 1920: Kimball 1976; Cheney 1984). As more families were attracted to the area, more businesses were established. Town mayor, James Lyndes, the started a real estate business with C. M. Patterson and opened a law office. He served as the first County Attorney and Hysham‚Äôs first Mayor. Lyndes' wife Mary Alice served as chairman of the school board and for the first few years, the high school was held above the Lyndes and Patterson store. Also among the first town's residents were F. L. and Christiania Baker. Baker owned a threshing machine and did custom threshing (Kimball 1976). Another phase of the community development process usually occurred after the initial settlers became established and then encouraged friends and relatives to move to the area. Such was the case with the Lyndes family. After James Lyndes set up his law and real estate business, four of his brothers: Bert, Wallace, Elmer and C. W. \\"Kid\\" and their families, became some of the earliest Hysham residents (Kimball 1976). With the growth of commercial and agricultural businesses came the need for banks to finance the economic growth. The first bank in Hysham was the First National Bank, established in 1910, with J. W. Wagner serving as president. The bank continued to serve the community for more than half a century. Five years later, C. C. Jordan gambled on the boom caused by World War I and opened the Treasure State Bank. However, this bank was not as fortunate as its predecessor and ran into hard times with the post-war recession and a brutal winter in 1919, which severely damaged many of the area's cattle ranches. It was forced to close in 1922, which further hurt many local ranchers who had invested heavily in the bank (Kimball 1976). For the most part, however, the 1910s were a period of prosperity. Hysham boasted of concrete sidewalks with modern infrastructure including electric lights, telephone, water, and sewer. New businesses included an International Harvester dealership, a drug store, a hotel, the Pin-Con confections and ice cream parlor, a hardware business, a grocery store, the Rosebud Flour mill, a grain elevator, a butcher shop, a bakery, the Hysham Echo newspaper, a barber shop and pool hall as well as other enterprises. Besides new businesses, the decade saw the establishment of many social institutions such as the Hysham Community Church, the Presbyterian Church, the Hysham School, the Hysham Women's Club and the Buffington Hall, which was used for dances, basketball games, community meetings and other programs until it burned down in 1939 (Kimball 1976; Cheney 1984). Another development, which occurred during the 1910s, was the improvement of the area's road system. In 1914, the Montana State Highway Commission placed the \\"Yellowstone Trail\\" county road between Custer and Hysham on the Federal-Aid highway system. The road eventually followed a county road that ran just south of the Yellowstone River, crossing it over the Myers Bridge, which was a multi-span steel through truss span built in 1907. Other roads were either constructed or improved during this period (Axline 1991). The Yucca Theatre. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on January 7, 1994. Symbolic of this perseverance in the face of adversity, was the construction of the Yucca Theatre in 1931 by local businessman and politician, David M. Manning and his brother Jim Manning, just when the nationwide depression was at its nadir. This striking building is in the Mission style, which may have been the result of Manning's time spent in the Southwest where he would have seen similar buildings. However, it was unique to the Hysham area and undoubtedly was a source of civic pride to the community and does to this day show movies every Sunday. (U.S. Department of Interior 1993). Manning went on to become the owner or part owner of five different businesses; he helped build the city swimming pool and city water system; he built two dams in the Hysham area and improved the irrigation system. In addition to his many projects and businesses in Hysham, he also served in the Montana legislature where he was instrumental in promoting rural electrification and highway construction (U.S. Department of Interior 1993). After 52 continuous years of service (1933‚Äì1985), he retired as Dean of the Montana Senate and senior state legislator in the nation (Andrea Merrill-Maker, Montana Almanac, p. 159).

Durfee in the Leavenworth, Kansas trading firm of Durfee and Peck. In 1867, company employee Abe Farwell constructed the Fort Peck trading post along the Missouri River, which enjoyed a virtual monopoly in trade with the Sioux and Assiniboine people. After its short life as a trading post, Fort Peck served as an Indian agency from 1873 until 1878. At that time, the agency was moved to its current location at Poplar. Fort Peck had a post office from 1879 to 1881. A new town of Fort Peck, located approximately two miles north of the original, was built in 1934 to house Army Corps of Engineers employees involved in the construction of the Fort Peck Dam. Designed to be temporary, the government-owned town nevertheless included many features of a permanent town, including an administrative headquarters, a hospital, stores, a theater, a recreation hall, and other facilities. Totally inadequate to house the 10,000-plus employees, Fort Peck was soon joined by numerous shanty towns, including Wheeler, New Deal, Delano Heights, and Park Grove.

Despite being just the 23rd-largest city in Montana, Glasgow is the most populous city for over , thus making it an important economic hub for a large region in Eastern Montana. Both Amtrak and the National Weather Service operate facilities in Glasgow that link the city to the surrounding region. History Native Americans inhabited the region for centuries, and extensive buffalo and pronghorn antelope herds provided ample food for the nomadic tribes. The Nakoda, Lakota, and Dakota peoples alternately inhabited and claimed the region from the 16th to the late 19th centuries. In 1804 the Lewis and Clark expedition came within of the future site of Glasgow and noted the extensive herds of buffalo and various game. In 1851, the US government formed the first treaty with the Native American tribes, in 1885 the tribes engaged in the last known buffalo hunt in the region, and in 1887, a treaty was signed where the tribes , which led from 1888 to the formation of the Fort Peck Indian Reservation and the removal of the tribes from the Glasgow area. Glasgow was founded in 1887 as a railroad town by James Hill, who was responsible for creating many communities along the Hi-Line. He and a local railroader named the town when they spun a globe and their finger landed on Glasgow, Scotland. Glasgow grew during the 1930s when President Franklin D. Roosevelt authorized the construction of the Fort Peck Dam, which became a major source of employment for the Glasgow area. During World War II, the Glasgow Army Airfield housed the 96th Bombardment Squadron and 614th Bombardment Squadron, flying B-17 Flying Fortresses, at different times during the war. Starting in December 1944, a German POW camp was established at the facility, lasting until the end of the war. After the war ended the base was closed, and part of the facility eventually became the present day Glasgow Airport. Glasgow was the death place of Lieutenant Colonel Ronald Speirs, famed member of Easy Company, 101st Airborne. In the 1960s, the population rose to about 6,400 due to the nearby presence of the Glasgow Air Force Base, (SAC air command and housing B-52 bombers) used during the Vietnam War and the earlier part of the Cold War. A significant amount of mid-century modern and Googie-style architecture was built in Glasgow at this time, much of which survives. After the de-activation and closure of the base in 1969, Glasgow's population declined to about half its one-time size by 1990, when the loss rate stabilized. Glasgow currently functions as the major regional administrative, shopping and services hub for Valley County and some of the areas beyond.

Glasgow experiences a continental semi-arid climate (K√∂ppen climate classification BSk) with long, dry winters with typically freezing but exceedingly variable temperatures and hot, dry summers. The extreme variability of winter temperatures is due to the large warming produced by chinook winds as air descending from the Rockies is warmed, contrasting with very cold continental air masses typical of inland locations at this latitude. As an illustration, the record cold month of February 1936 averaged , but the two warmest Februaries of 1931 and 1984 averaged above and had mean maxima above . Snowfall averages per year.

In the early 1990s, railway abandonment occurred between the towns of Scobey and Opheim. *Opheim was once the location of Opheim Air Force Station, a former United States Air Force General Surveillance Radar station. Since its closing in 1979, the population has decreased significantly. *The city was also home to many banks, bars, stores, and a movie theater, all of which have changed hands or closed. The town has no major source of income and is currently facing a slow economic decline. *Granrud's Lefse in Opheim is one of the few area bakeries that still produces the traditional Norwegian potato flatbread, Lefse. *Opheim has a strong Norwegian-American heritage as reflected by the high school's mascot, the Vikings.

The population was 997 at the 2010 census. The city was once the eastern terminus of electric operations (1914‚Äì74) for the \\"Pacific Extension\\" of the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (\\"Milwaukee Road\\"). Here, steam or diesel locomotives were changed or hooked up to electric locomotives for trip through the Rocky Mountains to Avery, Idaho. Harlowton was founded in 1900 as a station stop on the Montana Railroad, a predecessor to the Milwaukee, and was named for Richard A. Harlow, the Montana Railroad's president. The area around Harlowton is rich in agriculture, the leading products being wheat, barley, cattle, sheep and honey bees. Major employers are Wheatland Memorial Healthcare, Harlowton High School, Hillcrest Elementary School, Musselshell Ranger District, Midtown Market 2 Grocery Store, Rays Sport and Western Wear, Cream of the West, Rocky Mountain Cookware, TicketPrinting.com, and the Judith Gap Wind Farm. The local newspaper is the Times Clarion. Harlowton is surrounded by the Crazy, Little Belt and Big Snowy Mountains, which are a part of the Lewis and Clark National Forest. The National Forest offers plenty of acreage for recreational activities; camping, sightseeing, hunting, OHV riding, snowmobiling, etc. Fishing access sites are located along the Musselshell River or at nearby Deadman's Basin or Martinsdale Reservoir. There are three parks located within Harlowton: Chief Joseph Park, Deer Park, and Fischer Park. The old Milwaukee Railroad trackbed has been converted into the ‚ÄúSmoking Boomer‚Äù trail. Of special interest are the pioneer bronze sculpture (entitled And They Called the Land Montana) and the Veteran's Honor Wall located in front of the Wheatland County Court House. The Rodeo, Wheatland County Youth Fair, and Harlowton Kiwanis Show are annual events that take place in Harlowton.

Within 100 miles are the Nez Perce National Historic Trail, Charles M. Bair Museum, and Showdown Ski Area. Prehistory Welcome Monument  Electric Switch Engine E57B The Upper Musselshell River Valley is named for the Musselshell River, which got its name from the large number of freshwater mussels found in its river bed. In the fall and winter weather, the bison would migrate to the lower altitudes along the Musselshell River. Early plains hunters, taking advantage of the large bison population, frequented this area. Some of the tribes that traveled through the area were the Crow, Blackfeet, Flathead, Gros Ventre, Northern Cheyenne, Nez Perce, Shoshones, Sioux, and Assiniboine. Harlowton lies within the Montana High Plains that form a part of the Northwestern Plains. The area is most known archeologically for the line of demarcation which was mutually established between the Crow and Blackfeet tribes that passed through the area. This fifty-mile rock line fence crossed east to west from the Big Snowy Mountains to the Crazy Mountains. The rock line hunting boundary was the cause of several battles in the area. Within Wheatland County, site surveys have recorded and assigned archaeological site numbers to Sentinel Rock, the Fish Creek Pictograph, Owl Canyon Pictograph, Winnecook Petroglyph, Fortification site, and to several buffalo jumps in the area. The Big Snowy, Little Belt, Castle and Crazy Mountains have produced five wickiup (conical timbered lodges) sites and several pictograph sites. On May 7, 1868, a treaty with the Crow Nation and the United States Government opened the Musselshell River Valley to settlement. The first sheep operation on the Upper Musselshell was started by P.J. Moore in 1878. The first large cattle operation in the area was the Chicago Montana Livestock Company in 1882, with S.S. Hobson as part owner and manager. Big Nose George robbery In 1878, JV Salazar (Mexican John) was robbed of his horses, grub, and guns near the present site of Harlowton by the noted horse thief George Parrott (Big Nose George). At the time of the Salazar robbery, George Parrott was known to be camping on the Musselshell River with Andrew Garcia, where he was holding a bunch of stolen horses on his way to Canada. Big Nose George was later lynched at Rawlins, Wyoming. Merino/Harlowton The town of Merino was officially established in 1881. The name Merino came from the breed of sheep (Merino) that were run in the area by Charles Severance at the time. The trading post owned by John and Archie McEachnie housed the post office, store and saloon. The first railroad into the area was the Montana Railroad (nicknamed the ‚ÄúJawbone Railroad‚Äù) in 1899. The Montana Railroad terminal was located one mile northwest of Merino, so it was decided to relocate the town site. On June 10, 1900 Richard Harlow, father of the Montana Railroad, and Arthur Lombard, surveyor and promoter of the Montana Railroad, auctioned off lots of the new town site. The name Merino was changed to Harlowton on November 9, 1900. The first building to be erected in the new town site was a barber shop, owned by Thomas Hanzlik. On June 17, 1907, a fire destroyed 24 buildings on the north side of Harlowton's Main Street. The town was rebuilt, though most of the construction took place on Central Avenue to correspond with the Milwaukee Railroad plot. The first town election was held on June 6, 1908. Mr. A. T. Anderson was elected mayor. The grand opening of the Graves Hotel was on June 19, 1909, with a banquet and dance. Andrew Chris Graves was the principal owner.

In 1915 the Milwaukee Railroad was electrified from Harlowton to Avery, Idaho ‚Äî over 450 mountainous miles. Harlowton became the eastern terminus of electric operations and was known as ‚Äúthe place where electricity replaces steam.‚Äù The Milwaukee Railroad dropped its electrified system in 1974, just months before the OPEC oil embargo of the United States. The Milwaukee Railroad was abandoned following a bankruptcy settlement and the last train that went through Harlowton was in March 1980.

Paleontology The town of Harlowton is located in the Fort Union Geological formation and is famous for its Paleocene fossils. In 1902 Albert Silberling, a local homesteader and self-taught paleontologist, discovered the Douglass Quarry southwest of Harlowton. Albert Silberling and Earl Douglass, a Princeton University paleontologist, discovered fossil remains of primitive mammals including the Ptilodus, Phenacodus, and Plesiadapis in the quarries southwest of Harlowton. Albert Silberling's discoveries from fossils excavated in the Harlowton area have subsidized the information about life in the Paleozoic era. The Rugocaudia cooneyi and Tatankacephalus cooneyorum are two new dinosaur species that were found southwest of Harlowton. The Rugocaudia cooneyi is a new sauropod dinosaur that was described and named by the paleontologist Cary Woodruff in 2012. The genus name Rugocaudia means ‚Äúwrinkle tail‚Äù and the species name honors the landowner J. P. Cooney. The Tatankacephalus is a new ankylosaur dinosaur species found in 1997 by Bill and Kris Parsons, research associates of the Buffalo Museum of Science. The Avaceratops lammersi dinosaur was found on the Lammers family Careless Creek Ranch northeast of Harlowton and is the first of its kind. The Aveceratops is a small horned dinosaur that belongs to the Ceratopsidaie family. Eddie and Ava Cole discovered the fossil remains in 1981. Dr. Peter Dodson, Professor of Paleontology and Veterinary Anatomy at the University of Pennsylvania, participated in further excavation and transported the specimen to the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia.

Arriving at the hotel late at night, Roosevelt was accosted by a drunk sheep herder carrying cocked revolvers in both hands, and ordered to buy drinks for the crowd. Roosevelt pretended to move towards the bar, then punched the man three times in quick succession, causing the drunk to fire his revolvers as he fell. The future president then took away the man's guns before several other occupants of the hotel dragged him out into a shed.

Today, Huntley is an eastern suburb of Billings and is located east of Shepherd and west of Worden. History George N. Smith and family at the Yellowstone River, Huntley, Montana, 1881 This settlement in arid Crow Indian country was named for S.O. Huntley, a partner in the stagecoach firm of Clark & Huntley. It was located at the head of navigation on the Yellowstone River. The first steamboat, the packet Josephine, arrived June 6, 1875, but river trade was infrequent. A U.S. post office was established in March 1878. The 1880 Census found only 37 people living in Huntley. Surveying for a railroad led to the so-called \\"Baker Battle\\" between Sioux Indians and Army engineers in 1872. The Northern Pacific Railroad arrived in 1882, connecting the town to the new city of Billings. Three years later the town called \\"Huntley Station\\" had two stores, a hotel, and a blacksmith. German immigrants were prominent among the new settlers, who established Lutheran and German Methodist churches. In 1905 the United States Bureau of Reclamation began an irrigation project, called the Huntley Project, on lands that had been part of the Crow Indian Reservation until 1904. The town of Huntley was incorporated into the project along with the new railroad towns of Ballantine, Worden, and Pompey's Pillar, all founded in 1907. During the Yellowstone Flood of 1937, the damage to Huntley was more extensive, percentage-wise, than in any other community in the region. Much of the original town of Huntley was destroyed and significant portions of the land it occupied was claimed or compromised by the Yellowstone River. The flood damage included washing away the suspension bridge that allowed adjacent Highway 312 to cross the river. After the flood, the site of the town was relocated from the north side of the river to the higher elevation on the south bank. Geography Huntley is located at (45.899722, -108.304491).

It is the third largest community in the Billings Metropolitan Statistical Area, and is located in the Yellowstone Valley, as an east-west terminal division point of the Burlington-Northern Railroad. The population was 6,781 at the 2010 census.US Census Fact Sheet for 2010 Laurel is home to a Cenex Harvest States oil refinery and Montana Rail Link's Laurel Yard, the largest rail yard between St. Paul, Minnesota and Pasco, Washington. History Before Laurel became a city or a community, people passed through the site during the gold rush period, when gold was discovered at the Clarks Fork headwaters. They came by team and wagon, and by small steamer vessels up the Yellowstone River. The government was in the process of planning a railroad to the west coast, and had surveying crews out to map the country on the most direct route. Many of the prospectors that went west in search of gold, felt gold might be found in other parts of the state, so some returned to the Yellowstone Valley, and others came from the East to settle here. However, this did not take place until after the Custer Massacre in 1876. It was not until 1877 that the white man felt safe in the Yellowstone Valley, after the power of the Sioux was broken. So it was that while the memory of the Massacre of General Custer and his Command on the Little Big Horn River was still fresh in the minds of settlers of Montana, that a little community was established in the Yellowstone Valley.Laurel's Story, A Montana Heritage, Elsie Johnston, writer and coordinator, 1979. The history of Laurel began when settlers began making their homes in the vicinity in 1879. There was a section house built that served as a depot and post office, situated about where Hobo Hill is, or near the center of the present railroad yards east of Laurel. The railroad pushed closer to Laurel from the east, up the Yellowstone Valley during the summer of 1882. Up to this time, there were about 200 people in the community. With the advent of the railroad, the population grew to 368 in 1900, 806 in 1910, and 2,338 in 1920. Laurel was originally known as the station of Carlton, however by 1883, its name was changed to Laurel, after a local shrub. Laurel was considered a town in 1906, but it was not until August 1908 that it became incorporated, and two months later, on October 10, 1908, city government was established with the election of a city council and mayor. Geography Laurel is located at (45.673986, -108.770893). It is 3300 feet (1006 m) above sea level. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. Some of Laurel's residents commute the to Billings, Montana's largest city. Laurel is also significant as it lies on one of two main roads to Red Lodge, southwest on US 212; it is a popular mountain town and an end of the Beartooth Highway. Laurel is also served by the Laurel Municipal Airport, a publicly owned public-use airport, which is north of the central business district.

As the needs of the citizens increased and calls for service became more frequent, the City felt an agency ran by city government was better equipped to provide for the people. The ambulance service has operated at the Basic Life Support level since 1976. The service is licensed through the Montana Department of Public Health and Human services, and it requires each staff member to maintain a license of at least the Emergency Medical Technician level.

Lockwood was named after Captain Lockwood, reputed to have many victories fighting Native Americans and to have been a surveyor for the government who camped in the foothills in the late 1800s. In 1907, settlers opened a public road through Lockwood flats of heavy loam to the 2nd crossing of Dry Creek, to the Dry Creek Road traversing to the Reservation. The old Native American supply road is still etched into the side of the hill at the south end of Exxon Road which was later called Peter Hoe Road. Lockwood Flats was home of the Johnson Ranch. Just to the southeast of the ranch, one can find reminisces of Cavalry camps as they stay in the area for a whole winter surveying the land for the federal government. The area known as Lockwood Flats was also originally the site of a stop called Hirsch, located just between Johnson Lane and old Coulson Road. A community began to develop around it, however, the topographical name Lockwood stuck, and the name Hirsch was eventually forgotten. On June 16, 1965, an F3 tornado touched down near Lockwood. It was the strongest tornado ever recorded in Yellowstone County.http://www.tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado/19650616.30.2http://www.tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado/Montana/Yellowstone Today, Lockwood has grown to become the largest unincorporated community in the state of Montana and the 16th largest population center in the state. Lockwood is also one of the fastest growing communities in Montana with an estimated 58% increase between the 2000 and 2010 censuses. In 2010, Lockwood gained status as a Census Designated Place. Residents and local businesses are working with Yellowstone County and the City of Billings to create a framework for proper infrastructure and zone planning, as well as an eventual incorporation as an official municipality. On October 24, 2013, Lockwood residents gathered for a large community meeting with 250 attendees to discuss and organize community interest, goals, and direction. Pictures of the historic meeting were recorded of the event and posted on the new [www.lockwoodmontana.com community website]. Groups were organized and champions were chosen for many different issues whether it was for a high school, incorporation, better roads, Billings bypass, community garden, community festival, water & sewer, lighting, sidewalks, and businesses. A celebration was held one year from the historic gathering to celebrate the progress that had been made.

Between 1872 and 1880, when the population had grown to 2,800, Hastings was a boomtown. Settlers first built sod houses, dugouts, and shanties, then houses and stores. The city was incorporated in April 1874, and in September 1878, after a five-year Great County Seat War, the county seat was transferred to Hastings from Juniata.Catherine Renschler, Prairie to Prominence: Hastings' First 10 Years at Adams County Historical Society, retrieved April 6, 2010.

Looking east on First Street, circa 1944 In 1942, the Naval Ammunition Depot was constructed, initiating explosive growth: Hastings' population grew from 15,000 to 23,000 in under a year and there was a critical shortage of housing, which prompted both alteration of existing housing stock and rapid construction of new neighborhoods.Spilinek, p. 10.

The population was 755 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Hastings, Nebraska Micropolitan Statistical Area. History Juniata was named by the Burlington Railroad for a river in Pennsylvania and is the oldest town in Adams County. It was platted, organized, and became the county seat in late 1871, the first school district in the county was established there, and the first newspaper in the county, the Adams County Gazette, was published there. During the 1870s the Commercial Hotel, south of the railroad depot, was one of the largest in Nebraska west of Lincoln. It was demolished in 1879. On April 12, 1872, the county commissioners declined a request from the St. Joseph and Denver City Railroad for $75,000 in bonds to build 25 miles of track, reasoning that the line would be built anyway and would logically cross the Burlington line at Juniata. Instead the railroad laid its tracks seven miles east and set up the new town of Hastings,Catherine Renschler, Juniata at Adams County Historical Society, retrieved April 6, 2010. which in September 1878 won a five-year Great County Seat War and became the county seat.Catherine Renschler, Prairie to Prominence: Hastings' First 10 Years at Adams County Historical Society, retrieved April 6, 2010.

Neligh and a few of his friends took a trip up the Elkhorn River from West Point, Nebraska. Neligh took note of the scenic landscape and thought it would be the ideal setting for a town and the county seat. He immediately left for Omaha to buy 520 acres for the town site. Misunderstanding the prime land he was selling, Omaha banker Herman Kountze sold the land required to develop Neligh. He was apparently not aware it would make the ideal county seat, which Neligh eventually became.

Her father, Black Elk, asked the townspeople \\"to respect the grave of my child just as they do the graves of their own dead\\". She was buried in Laurel Hill Cemetery in Neligh, and her grave tended by the residents; in 1960, owing to the deterioration of the monument, the marker was set on a new foundation.\\"White Buffalo Girl\\".

Arthur. Arthur was incorporated as a village in 1944. The first county office was a covered wagon, with a one-room courthouse being built in 1915. A year before that, in the Spring, a general store was constructed, and afterward a newspaper, the first church and the post office were established. A one-room highschool was also built in 1914, expanding to two rooms in 1920. In 1916 the Arthur State Bank was founded. Into the 1920s, Arthur continued to be built. The town got electricity in 1926, though most of the county would not have it until the early 1950s. Then in 1932, the Great Depression struck Arthur, closing its bank, which was not replaced until 1939 with the Arthur County Co-op Credit Association. Following WWII, in 1950 construction of a new, large and modern highschool was completed. A new courthouse was built in 1960-1961.

The population was 100 at the 2010 census. History Harrisburg, and all of Banner County, were originally part of Cheyenne County and began with a homestead in 1884. A settlement, at first called Randall and then Centropolis, developed around this and neighboring homesteads. In November, 1888, Cheyenne County subdivided into five counties, and the settlement was included in the territory which became Banner County. Its county seat was originally located at Ashford, a few miles northeast. However, in 1889 Charles Schooley, a settler, donated part of his land for the development of a formal town. A migrant being from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania caused the name to be selected. Because of its central location, Harrisburg became the home base for stagecoach and mail carrier lines in the county, and the county government moved its operations from Ashford in mid-1891. By 1892, Harrsiburg had two hotels, two livery stables, a brickwork, a cheese factory, two banks and three newspapers. It was the principal community for the county, which was almost entirely devoted to wheat farming and cattle ranching. In 1951, oil (which had first been discovered in 1919) became the county's third commodity. Harrisburg's fortunes rose and fell with the county's. The lack of a railroad line for shipping eventually drew the larger farm and ranch houses to the north, while the 1960s routing of Interstate Highway 80 through Kimball brought the removal of other businesses to the south. Other small hamlets in Banner County collapsed as people moved either north or south, or consolidated their activities around Harrisburg. This movement has allowed Harrisburg to flourish into the 21st century, despite its low resident population. Geography Harrisburg is located at (41.554553, -103.740379).

At the 2010 census, its population was 341. Pleasanton was platted in 1890 when the Union Pacific railroad was extended to that point. It got its name from its location in the Pleasant Valley of the Loup River. Pleasanton was incorporated as a village in 1894. History The village was platted in April 1890 when the Union Pacific constructed a branch line of railroad, the Omaha and Republican Valley Railway, from Boelus in Howard County through Ravenna and on to Pleasant Valley. The village was a terminus station for the branch line of railroad located on the north side of the South Loup River called Pleasant Valley. This was also the location of an early settlement called Peters' Bridge. The Peters family was one of the first settlers to the area when they constructed and operated the bridge. Peters' Bridge was the location of a station on the stagecoach and freight line that went north with supplies. A post office was located in an area called South Loup, near the bridge. This area of section 35 of the Loup Township was previously known as Riverview, when the post office was established in 1883. James Hunter became the first postmaster of Riverview. The first regularly scheduled train arrived to the town on March 1, 1890. Local businesses and buildings were quickly constructed at the crossroads. The village schoolhouse was constructed on the south side of the South Loup River. This location served the town of Pleasanton until 1907 when an ice-jam clogged the river and backed the water up into the school. In 1909 a brick schoolhouse was built on top of the hill, above the flood plain. The flood was first of many disasters the village of Pleasanton has endured in its history. The disasters continued when a cyclone occurred in 1890, three fires burned parts of the town between 1892 and 1894, and two major floods occurred in 1924 and 1947. The 1947 flood washed out the railroad tracks that were responsible for the creation of the village. The village went through a growing spurt in the 1970s where 40 new homes were built. Pleasanton Public School The school has been in operation since 1890. It is categorized as a class D2 School by the Nebraska School Activities Association, which organizes high schools on a scale from A to D, with D2 being the smallest schools. Railroad depot The Pleasanton Railroad Depot located in the center of town was built in 1890. It was constructed during a time where an extension of Burlington Northern and Union Pacific railroads were built in an effort to reach the Black Hills quickly. In 2005 the village board deemed the building a liability, and made plans to tear it down. The Pleasanton High School chapter of Future Business Leaders of America made it their mission to save the deteriorating building. It took eight years of grants and fundraisers to raise the money and renovate the depot. Geography Pleasanton is located at (40.968612, -99.088086).

It is part of the Kearney, Nebraska Micropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 1,059 at the 2010 census. It is located west of Grand Island along both the Union Pacific Railroad and U.S. Route 30. Nebraska Link 10-D connects Shelton with Interstate 80. Geography Shelton is located at (40.777487, -98.733282). According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all land. The downtown business district is situated near the banks of the Wood River and the historic Lincoln Highway (now U.S. Highway 30) passes through Shelton. History Shelton, evolving from Wood River Centre, is one of the older communities in Nebraska. The first European settler to live in the area was a Mormon by the name of Joseph Johnson in 1858. His store, blacksmithery, wagon repair shop, tintype gallery, bakery, place where meals could be obtained, and printing office served early pioneers. The \\"Huntsman's Echo\\", his publication, was the first newspaper west of Omaha and was established in April 1860. His establishment (Johnson's Ranche) found itself as an important point of supply serving Mormons and other travelers on the Council Bluffs Road. Prior to service by the railroad, The Great Western Stage Company established a stage station at Wood River Center in 1860 to serve its Fort Kearny route. The Union Pacific Railroad came to the area in 1866; with additional settlers, the need to establish government was realized. Patrick Walsh, Martin Slattery, and a Sergeant Cody petitioned the governor to organize Buffalo County in 1869. Wood River Centre (Shelton) was selected through election to be the county seat. Within a year, the seat was moved to Gibbon. Patrick Walsh, the community postman, wrote the Postmaster General in 1873 with the plea to change the name of Wood River Centre to Shelton to avoid confusion with Wood River, a community to the east. The post office name was changed from Wood River Center to Shelton on February 3, 1873. Shelton held the name of Wood River Center from 1860 to about 1873. No further correspondence about the naming of Shelton is recorded. The name, Shelton, is derived from the name of an auditor for the Union Pacific Railroad, Nathan Shelton. Shelton Township Library, Shelton NE The original townsite was surveyed from the homestead farm of Patrick Walsh, followed by a survey from the Union Pacific Railway Company. It was 1876 before the Union Pacific established a station.

As early as 1866, people of the Shelton area organized together to form the first schoolhouse in Buffalo County. By 1876, a new school district was organized; it was legally known as No. 19 in Buffalo County. In January 1908, the community library was officially organized as the Shelton Public Library with a village tax being levied for its support. A Carnegie Library building was funded on April 7, 1913.

The population was 481 at the 2010 census. This town is named after one of its incorporators, Stephen Decatur. It developed around a trading post established by Colonel Peter Sarpy, the namesake for Sarpy County in the state. History The area was long occupied by the Omaha Native Americans, who settled along the creeks and river Explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark passed through the area in 1804 as their expedition traveled via the upper Missouri River on their way to and from the Pacific Coast, in their exploration of the Louisiana Purchase. The first European settler in the area was a man named Woods, who settled at the mouth of Wood Creek (his namesake) in 1837. Stephen Decatur arrived in the area in 1841. A former schoolteacher in New Jersey and New York, he had abandoned his wife and two children when he migrated to the West. Here he changed his name, dropping his former surname of \\"Bross.\\" His farm was called Decatur Springs, after a spring which supplied water to the village for the next century. In 1854, the U.S. Commissioner of Indian Affairs purchased 300,000 acres of land from the Omaha, including the area which is now Decatur. The town of Decatur was incorporated in 1856 under the name \\"The Decatur Townsite & Ferry Company.\\" The other incorporators included Thomas Whiteacre, T. H. Hineman, George Mason, and Herman Glass. Peter Sarpy helped lay out the town, which developed around his Indian trading post at the mouth of Wood Creek.

The Center's positions are generally characterized as liberal/progressive. It has issued a number of releases commending the health-care measure passed by Congress in 2010, has opposed the elimination of the estate tax, and has condemned judicial rulings \\"designed to protect corporate interests\\". = Storefront Theater = The Storefront Theater is located on Main Street in Lyons. It is one of four projects that are a part of the Byway of Art project created through a $200,000 ArtPlace America grant awarded to the Center for Rural Affairs. The Byway of Art project was created by former Lyons resident Adele Phillips and conceptual artist Matthew Mazzotta. The Storefront Theater creates a seating and performance area on the street. When not in use the structure appears to be a typical storefront. However, what appears to be a standard building consists of a false facade that lowers down toward the street and over the sidewalk. Bleachers behind the storefront theater pull out for seating. The Storefront Theater was selected as part of the Americans for the Arts 2016 Public Art Network Year in Review program.

The population was 88 at the 2010 census. History An attempt to settle the area was first made in 1857, on the banks of Skull Creek, a half-mile from current-day Linwood. A school was established in 1865, and a postmaster for the settlement, originally named Skull Creek, was appointed in 1868. It was later renamed Linwood for the linden trees growing near the creek.

It is named for the large local lake, which for years has been a popular resort area. The lake is surrounded by numerous homes. Most are year-round residences, although some summer cottages dot the shore. It is especially noted for two islands in its center, separated by a narrow, shallow strait (both of which have cabins). The lake's name reportedly comes from the local Wangunk Indian language for \\"lake with pierced islands\\" or \\"divided pond.\\" Price, Carl F. Yankee Township. East Hampton, Conn.: Citizens' Welfare Club, 1941. 9. According to local legend, some time long before the area was settled by whites, the tribe living there felt they were being cursed by their irritable Great Spirit. To try to appease him, the main chief agreed to sacrifice his daughter, who willingly threw herself into the lake and drowned. The tribe's shamans announced that never again would an Indian be killed on the lake. Lake Pocotopaug, at , is large, but many other lakes in Connecticut are larger. The largest by far, is Candlewood Lake at .http://ctwaterfrontlife.com/2012/04/04/connecticut-lakes- sizes-and-information/ The Wangunk were also said to have hunted on Spellman's point, a quaint street lined with cottages, using loud noises to scare the animals to the end of the peninsula, and thereby an effective way to gather food, however in the mid-to-late 1800s it was sold for a sack of bean to the \\"Bay point\\" society. Sears Park is located at the lake and has various swimming, boating and recreational facilities for residents. In recent years the lake has become a place of ecological study due to the large scale algae blooms that resulted starting in 2000. Tests have shown that increasing watershed land development and fertilizer use are causing issues. A town sanctioned Lake Commission and the Friends of Lake Pocotopaug are two organizations concentrating on improvement ideas. In late spring and summer 2020, a rehabilitation project began, focusing on pumping fresh air into the lake bottom at multiple sites around the lake. These were added throughout the lake in a step wise process. Additionally, a ‚Äúbioblast‚Äù treatment with favorable bacterial organisms was completed in early August 2020. Within a single season, water clarity increased and has been steadily improving. This successful intervention has interrupted nearly two decades of regular summer algae blooms, with no significant bloom occurring in 2020. Dramatic improvement in the lake‚Äôs water quality has resulted. How long term this improvement will be sustained remains to be seen. The lake has scattered rock hazards, including one marked by a small memorial lighthouse in its southeast portion. ‚ÄúClaudia‚Äôs island - 2006‚Äù is identified on the base. Although it‚Äôs light is currently nonfunctional, the lighthouse has undergone a restoration and repainting by Good Samaritans.

The population was 6,502 at the 2010 census. History The Lewis and Clark Expedition passed the mouth of the Platte River, just north of what is now Main Street Plattsmouth, on July 21, 1804. Plattsmouth first appeared in 1854 as \\"the Barracks\\", a trading post established by Sam Martin, owner of the Platteville ferry in neighboring Mills County, Iowa, ferryman Wheatley Mickelwait, and Glenwood, Iowa attorney and politician Colonel Joseph Longworthy Sharp. The community was renamed Plattsmouth for its location at the mouth of the Platte River, and was incorporated on March 15, 1855. The organization of the city under the charter of March 1855 was effected December 29, 1856, by the election of Wheatley Mickelwait to the Mayoralty, and Enos Williams, W. M. Slaughter and Jacob Vallery, Aldermen. This Council met and proceeded to business on January 29, 1857, their first ordinance, approved by the Mayor March 2, 1857, levying a tax of one-half of 1 per cent on all taxable property within the corporate limits of the city of Plattsmouth, the amount collected to be expended in the improvement of the streets and alleys and steamboat landings at and in the city. On December 7, 1857, the Council voted each member an annual salary of $100, being something over $16 apiece for each session held during the year. This is a noticeable fact, in view of the action taken by the succeeding Council on December 30, 1858, in ordaining that the Mayor and Alderman receive for their services during that year the sum of 5 cents each, payable in city scrip; the Assessor, Recorder and Treasurer being paid $25 apiece for the same term.

The population was 1,050 at the 2010 census. History The name of the stream running through Weeping Water is Nigahoe in Oto and Omaha, meaning \\"rustling water,\\" in reference to the sound of the water running over the low falls. This was mistaken by the French to be Nihoage, meaning \\"water weeping.\\" This error was recorded in French as L'Eau qui Pleure, meaning \\"the water which weeps.\\"Fitzpatrick, Lilian Linder (1925). Nebraska Place-Names, p. 33. Retrieved January 12, 2018. This was later translated into English as its current name, Weeping Water. The village of Nehawka, also in Cass County, is an anglicization of Nigahoe, the original name of the stream in Weeping Water. Weeping Water was platted in 1867. Weeping Water was incorporated as a village in 1870, and as a city in 1888. = Legend = Debates over the origin of the name have existed since at least the early twentieth century. Regardless of whether the legend originates from Native American sources or simply was created to explain the mistranslation of the Native American name for the steam, the legend has become an important piece of Nebraska folklore. According to American folklorist Louise Pound, the first written reference to the legend of Weeping Water is found in the 800-line poem \\"The Weeping Water\\" by Orsamus Charles Dake, published in a book of poetry called Nebraska Legends and Other Poems in 1871. Dake's poem is prefaced with a disclaimer that \\"The Weeping Water\\" was one of two poems which Dake \\"developed.\\" Dake's poem is also preceded by a paragraph summarizing the legend which reads: > The Omaha and Otoe Indians, being at war, chanced to meet on their common > hunting ground south of the Platte River in Nebraska. A fierce battle > ensued, in which all the male warriors of both tribes being slain, the women > and children came upon the battle-field and sat down and wept. From the > fountain of their tears arose and ever flows the little stream known as the > Ne-hawka or the Weeping Water. The poem includes details and dialogue that Dake likely invented, such as the main narrative thrust of the poem, a story of forbidden love between an Otoe man and the daughter of the Omaha chief. According to Pound, the words spoken by the characters in the poem are not so much dialogue but rather \\"[l]ofty speeches of the Homeric and Virgilian type\\" which Pound attributes to Dake's classical training and tenure as an English professor. Pound suggests that it is most likely, based on the preface and summary he provides with the poem, that Dake took inspiration from a preexisting folktale, though whether the legend was genuinely of Native American origin remains undetermined.

The population was 1,424 at the 2000 census. The core of the village is listed as the North Grosvenordale Mill Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places. The historic area around the cotton mill was listed in 1993 and is located on Riverside Drive (Route 12), Buckley Hill Road, Floral Avenue, Market Lane, and Marshall, Central, River, and Holmes Streets. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of 5.8 km (2.2 mi2), all land. It is located in central Thompson, on the banks of the French River. The main road passing through the village is Connecticut Route 12, which roughly parallels the river's north‚Äìsouth course. History North Grosvenor Dale was the site of early small textile mills, probably erected in the early years of the 19th century. The mill located here remained relatively small until after the American Civil War, when it and the associated water privileges were purchased by William Grosvenor, an investor from Providence, Rhode Island. Grosvenor also purchased a second mill further south, where he built a large new mill in 1868, calling that village Grosvenordale. When he built the large brick mill standing here in 1872, he renamed this village North Grosvenordale. This mill produced fine cotton fabrics, and was one of the longest-lived and most successful textile businesses in northeastern Connecticut. Grosvenor also built significant tracts of worker housing on either side of the river. Most of these are multiple-family buildings with vernacular Greek Revival style. They were occupied in clusters by different groups of immigrant workers, giving rise to neighborhood names such as \\"Little Canada\\" and \\"Swede Village\\". The company also built some higher-quality single-family houses at the north end of the village, which were probably occupied by skilled specialists and supervisors. The mills operated until 1954, and have been adapted to other industrial uses. The mill and surrounding company-related resources (an area of about with more than 100 buildings), was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993.

Smith, who hoped to attract settlers to the region \\"as the magnet attracts iron\\". =Town motto and disasters= Magnet's motto: \\"Magnet: The town too tough to die!\\" came from a variety of disasters that have struck the town over the course of its history. In February 1925 a fire burned one block of Main Street. The first tornado of two to strike Magnet happened on June 18, 1937. It tore through the town, destroying many businesses and homes. Thousands of people came to survey the damage on the Sunday following the storm. Over the summer of 1937 the town was cleaned up and through the help of neighboring towns, buildings and farms were restored. The second tornado struck Magnet on May 6, 1975 at 2:45 pm. The devastating tornado ripped through the town, destroying 2 homes and heavily damaging many more. A Carhart Lumber truck from Randolph came into town, bringing a load of plywood sheets. They were used for temporary repairs to protect damaged homes from the elements. The town was without lights and water, so the fire department from the neighboring town of Wausa brought in emergency generator units. Workers from the power company labored throughout the night to restore electrical service to the main part of town. It took over a week to replace broken poles and wires. Drinking water was brought in milk creamer cans. Help from neighboring towns came during the summer to assist with the clean-up. =Railroad= The Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis, and Omaha Railroad went from Randolph to Magnet, then on to Bloomfield. Travelers who came to Magnet in 1894 had only a platform and an old box car to unload on when they arrived. During 1905‚Äì06, everything came by mail, groceries, farm goods, etc. In 1948‚Äì49, there was a very bad winter; at one time there was no train for six weeks. In the 1950s the train only came through three times a week. The tracks were eventually torn up in 1965. =Jail House= The jailhouse was built circa 1902. Bars on the windows were set to keep the prisoners in. Before it was moved it was an old voting booth. In the 1960s the building was moved and added on to serve as the county shed. It was one of the buildings that was destroyed by the tornado in 1975.

The first Gurley depot station was opened during the winter of 1915-1916. Three bunk cars served as a station building. One was the office, one was for freight and one was for living quarters for the agent and his family. The first agent was George Wallen. Fred Gurley was the agent from 1916-1919. During the time that Fred was the agent he started a park north of the depot. He planted flowers and made the trellis that was in the center of it and there is still a park there today. The Gurley Lumber Company was one of the first businesses in Gurley. S.J. Flora came in 1914 to be the manager of this business. The first person born in Gurley was Clara Anneva Flora, later to be named Clara Lessig. As of December 2008, Clara is still an active member of the Gurley community. The first general store and a post office were operated by F.W. Busse. In the same building, there was a pharmacy and a doctor's office. Dr. Hart was the doctor at that time. He also had the first telephone switchboard in Gurley. Christ Weyerts built a Weyerts Garage and dance hall about 1915.

This city is nine miles north from the Colorado state line. The population was 6,757 at the 2010 census. History The city was named for Sidney Dillon, president of the Union Pacific Railroad. It was founded in 1867 by the Union Pacific and grew up around the military base of Fort Sidney (also known as Sidney Barracks), where soldiers were stationed to guard the transcontinental railroad from potential Indian attacks. The town became the southern terminus of the Sidney Black Hills Stage Road which used Clarke's Bridge (near Bridgeport, Nebraska) to allow military and civilian traffic to reach Fort Robinson, Red Cloud Agency, Spotted Tail Agency, Custer, South Dakota, and Deadwood, South Dakota in the late 1870s and 1880s. When the railroad reached Sidney, it was the end of a sub-division of the rail line and played host to a roundhouse, repair facilities, and a railroad hotel for passengers. Sidney is home to one of the Old West's Boot Hill cemeteries; many of those interred there were soldiers from the fort.http://www.sidneyboothill.com/ The former headquarters for Cabela's was located in Sidney until 2017, when Sidney lost 2,000 jobs due to the Cabela's merger with Bass Pro Shops. Approximately 120 of those jobs were relocated to the Bass Pro Shops headquarters in Springfield, Missouri. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. Sidney is toward the western edge of the midwestern wheat-growing region. West of the city, the land is increasingly used for cattle ranching. Sidney is located along Lodgepole Creek, which is along present-day Interstate 80. The city is presently located at the junction of U.S. Route 385 with I-80, and its location approximately halfway between Cheyenne, Wyoming, and North Platte, Nebraska, has encouraged the growth of the city as a major transportation service area on the Interstate. Because the I-80/US 385 interchange is located several miles southeast of the town center, a new commercial area has developed, including truck stops, convenience stores, the building that housed Cabela's former world headquarters, shopping centers, motels, restaurants, and other commercial enterprises. In recent years, the city has seen further growth with the construction of wind farms in this portion of the Nebraska Panhandle and adjacent areas of Colorado, including Peetz.

Nebraska Public Power District. October 2009. Retrieved 2010-03-05. History In 1866, the Union Pacific Railroad reached present-day Schuyler, at the time known as Shell Creek Station. Three years later, the Nebraska State Legislature divided large Platte County into three smaller counties, including Colfax County. In 1870, Shell Creek Station was renamed Schuyler. In 1870, the Union Pacific chose the town as the point at which Texas cattle being driven north would be loaded onto trains. With this, Schuyler became Nebraska's first \\"cow town\\". However, the resulting boom, which saw a six-fold increase in the town's population (from 100 to 600) and around 50,000 head of cattle pass through, was only temporary: the next year, the terminus of the cattle trail had moved west to Kearney. The city's early residents were Czech, Irish, and German settlers. Settlement was enabled by Schuyler's geographic position, which caused the community to be associated with a number of historic overland transportation routes, including: * Oregon Trail (1836‚Äì1869) * Mormon Trail (1840s‚Äì1850s) * Transcontinental Railway (1866‚Äìpresent) * Coast-to-coast Lincoln Highway (1913‚Äì1925) Beginning in the late 1980s, reductions in wages at the Cargill plant led to a change in Schuyler's demographic makeup. By 2017, an estimated 60% of the population was Latino, and immigrants from other parts of the world, including Somalia and Thailand, had also moved into the city. Attractions Christ the King Priory Saint Benedict Center In 1935, monks from the Congregation of Missionary Benedictines of Saint Ottilien established a community in Schuyler as a means of supporting the congregation's missions in Africa and Asia. At present, Christ the King Priory is home to 11 monks. The monks' apostolate has expanded to providing retreats at the recently constructed Saint Benedict Center, four miles north of Schuyler.The Schuyler Sun, Volume 113 No. 43 The Oak Ballroom's ceiling beams The Oak Ballroom, completed by the Works Progress Administration in 1937 and now listed on the National Register of Historic Places, was built using dozens of native oak trees hauled to the building site from the nearby Platte River using horses and wagons.Nebraska Public Television ‚Äì Statewide Notable people *Kyle Emanuel, professional American football player for the Los Angeles Chargers, former player at North Dakota State University *John C.

The population was 495 at the 2010 census. John Neihardt, who later became Nebraska's poet laureate, lived in Bancroft for twenty years and wrote many of his works there. His study is preserved at the John G. Neihardt State Historic Site in the village. History Succeeding cultures of indigenous peoples lived in the area for thousands of years before European encounter. By the mid-eighteenth century, the Omaha tribe lived on the west side of the Missouri River throughout this area. The settlement was originally known as Unashta Zinga, meaning \\"little stopping place\\" in a Native American language. The site that became Bancroft was homesteaded in the mid-1870s by Ford Bella Barber and Deborah (Watson) Barber, who came from Maine to settle in Nebraska. In 1880, when the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha Railway began planning a line through the area, the Barbers deeded of land to the railway for the platting of a town. At that time, the approximately 25 residents were of mostly German, Irish, and Scandinavian descent; some were immigrants. When the village was platted, townspeople named it Barbersville, but the couple refused the honor. The village was named after George Bancroft. Sources differ on who this was. In her 1925 Nebraska Place-Names, Lilian Linder Fitzpatrick says that it was historian George Bancroft. However, more recent sources say that the Bancroft whose name was used was \\"a well-liked civil engineer with the railroad\\". In 1884, of the Omaha Reservation was sold to \\"actual residents\\". This brought an influx of white settlers to that portion of the reservation; and Bancroft, located at the southern edge of the reservation, profited from the increased business. The population grew until 1910, when it reached a peak of 742. The Great Depression drove many of Bancroft's residents away to larger cities; but the onset of World War II brought a revival of prosperity. John Neihardt In 1900, the 19-year-old John G. Neihardt and his family moved to Bancroft, where he worked as assistant to a trader with the Omaha. He learned about the Omaha traditions and customs while working with them. Neihardt had already begun writing; he had published his first book, The Divine Enchantment, in 1897. His experiences among the Omaha strongly influenced his subsequent work. In September 1903, Neihardt became co-owner and editor of the weekly Bancroft Blade. He resigned this position in January 1905; he had enjoyed writing editorials, but could not maintain interest in the stuff of local news. From that point, he devoted himself to writing fiction and poetry, quickly winning national recognition. In 1911, Neihardt rented a one-room building for a study. In 1912, he began his epic Cycle of the West there. He continued to work in the study until 1920, when he moved to Branson, Missouri. In the following year, the Nebraska Legislature named him \\"Poet Laureate of Nebraska and the Plains\\". Neihardt's study was restored in 1967; in 1970, it was listed in the National Register of Historic Places. In 1976, the John G. Neihardt State Historic Site was opened. Beside the studio, this includes a museum, a library, and the restored Sacred Hoop Prayer Garden. This was designed based on symbolism in Niehardt's Black Elk Speaks (1932). This has become his best-known work, based on the oral history and spiritual teachings of Black Elk, a prominent Oglala Lakota sachem or medicine man.

The population was 678 at the 2010 census. Geography Beemer is located at (41.930439, -96.809862) on the table lands adjoining the Elkhorn River bottoms, 84 miles from Omaha and nine miles northwest of West Point, near the geographic center of Cuming County where Nebraska Link 20A meets U.S. Route 275. According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all land. Beemer view History =Early settlement= The first settlers of European descent arrived in the Beemer area by prairie schooner in 1864, seeking land under the Homestead Act. The new inhabitants built dugouts, sod houses, and, eventually, log cabins. The earliest settlers in Beemer Township included M. Brayrerton, George Graham, Joseph S. Emley, Robert Fehlmann, Dr. H.H. Howe, Howard Howe, James and Michael McNamara, Judge Newburn, the Rabe family, W.S. Schneald, William Sharp and two sons Martin and Silas, Casper Schifferns, David Simons, Wm. A. Smith, J.E. Spencer, Benjamin Ewing, John Wagaoner, Henry White, James Wilson, and William Witte.Some Early History of Beemer, Nebraska, Nebraska State Historical Society. The first school in Beemer Township was taught by Mrs. William Sharp in 1867 in her log cabin, a short distance to the northwest of where Beemer is now located. West of Beemer, a small stream called Rock Creek flows into the south side of the Elkhorn River. In 1865, August Lambrecht built a water-driven grain and flour mill on the creek about from the river. Lambrecht's mill, combined with the creek and with favorable agricultural conditions, attracted a small concentration of settlers; the area was known as \\"Rock Creek\\", after the stream. In 1871, the tracks of the Fremont, Elkhorn and Missouri Valley Railroad, which followed the Elkhorn upstream from Fremont, reached Wisner; the line reached Norfolk in 1879.Pangle, Mary Ellen. A History of Norfolk. Published serially in Norfolk Daily News. 1929 As the railway was extended, water stops were needed at intervals to support the steam locomotives.\\"History of Allen\\", a brochure about Allen, TexasFor example, a section of the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad running in the Mojave Desert between Ludlow and Amboy had water stops spaced by 5-10 miles: Lavic, Ragtown, Ash Hill, Klondike, Siberia, Bagdad, see Google Maps, all eight of them being ghost towns now. The railroad stops were also served by telegraphs for the purpose of administering and controlling the railroad as well as business development of the telegraphs.Thompson, Jim. The Railroad Telegrapher, Vol. VII, No. 2, Fall 1993 / Winter 1994. Retrieved from http://thelibrary.springfield.missouri.org/lochist/periodicals/ozarkswatch/ow702h.htm on 31 July 2010 The telegraph station at the water stop located at the site of present-day Beemer was named after the nearest significant settlement, Rock Creek, and used the call letters \\"R C\\". So, for the next fifteen years, two locations, several miles apart and on opposite sides of the Elkhorn, were referred to as 'Rock Creek': one was the area around the Rock Creek stream near Lambrecht's mill and the other the area around the railway water stop and telegraph station. =Forming a village= In 1885, Allen D. Beemer, George Canfield, and K.C. Morehouse laid out lots to the north of the Rock Creek water stop and platted a village to be known as Rock Creek, as filed in the county seat of West Point on May 26, 1885. Mr. Beemer built the first rail depot building, and led the drive to build a wooden bridge across the Elkhorn. His efforts on behalf of the area were rewarded in 1886, when Congressman Edward K. Valentine secured a post office for the settlement, naming it the Beemer Post Office. On July 15, 1886, in response to a petition of 54 residents, a village named Beemer was incorporated with Harry Delmont, W.D. Gibbon, John M. Barber, F.J. Fitzgerald, and Niels Hansen the village trustees. In that year Mr. Beemer founded a newspaper, the Beemer Times; and the rail company changed the name of the station from Rock Creek to Beemer, although its telegraph call signs remained \\"R C\\" (for \\"Rock Creek\\") until the depot closed in 1963. =Beemer's first century, 1886 - 1986= The first century was marked by spurious growth and numerous initiatives to develop Beemer. The Beemer Times, founded by A.D. Beemer around 1 March 1886, chronicled the times, the progress, the achievements, the disasters, and the dilemmas that faced early Beemer. The paper assailed ills like the muddy streets, the lack of sidewalks, and the excessive number of taverns; and it reported on more favorable developments like improvements to the schooling, new commercial enterprises, and major modernizations such as waterworks, electrification, road improvements, and telephone systems. Original site of the Congregational Church Holy Cross Catholic Church Churches Five churches were established in Beemer during this era. The Methodist Episcopal Church was built at the northeast corner of Fifth and Beemer Streets and dedicated September 5, 1886. In 1904, it moved to a new building on the northwest corner of Third and Fraisier streets. The first St. John's Lutheran Church building, with a steeple, was built on the southeast corner of Third and Lambrecht streets and dedicated July 2, 1893. The Congregational Church at the northeast corner of Third and Canfield streets was dedicated January 14, 1900. The Holy Cross Roman Catholic Church, at the southwest corner of Sixth and Frasier streets, was dedicated on September 20, 1914. The Mennonite Church at the southwest corner of Sherman and Fourth streets was dedicated on March 15, 1959. Schools The first Beemer Public School was held in a small frame building located on the northest corner of Third and Beemer Streets. By 1886, in order to support its 32 enrolled pupils, a two-room, frame building was built on the southwest corner of Fifth and Beemer Streets. The names of absent or tardy students were duly reported in the Beemer Times. In 1892, voters approved $10,000 in bonds for a modern two-story brick school. The school officers, F.J. Fitzgerald, A.D. Beemer, and Charles Decker reported an enrollment of 210 pupils. The building was erected on the north side of Third Street between Blaine and Harrison Streets (approximately where a 1964 addition to the school was eventually built). In 1917, the village passed another bond issue for a new school building on the northeast corner of Third and Blaine Streets. The new building was used for the graduation ceremonies in May 1918; the older, adjacent building was torn down that summer. The 1918 building would continue to be used until 2008. Railroad Service The tracks of the Fremont. Elkhorn & Missouri Valley Railroad arrived in Beemer in 1871. This route was laid from Fremont to reach the Black Hills of South Dakota. The Chicago & North Western took over in 1903. By the mid-1970s, the freight traffic volumes began mildly declining. C&NW; ended railroad service in the spring of 1982, after flooding damaged many sections of the track & abandonment was applied for. The tracks were removed just a few years later.

The population was 3,364 at the 2010 census. History West Point was first founded in the spring of 1857, when Omaha businessmen formed the Nebraska Settlement Association in order to find suitable townsites in the Elkhorn Valley. Uriah, John, and Andrew Bruner (three brothers originally from Pennsylvania), and William Sexauer chose the present location on a bend along a river, which they called New Philadelphia. The name was soon changed to West Point because it was the westernmost outpost along the valley. West Point became the county seat of Cuming County on October 12, 1858 after winning the election over the community of DeWitt. A total of 19 votes were split between the two towns with West Point obtaining 12 votes. By the spring of 1859, over 4,000 Pawnee natives flooded the Elkhorn Valley during a hunting excursion and, displeased to find white settlers in the valley, burned several homesteads and killed livestock. The so-called Pawnee War ended near Battle Creek without a fight. West Point grew slowly at first, but with the coming of the railroad in 1870, it boomed to a population of over 700. The Chicago & North Western ended railroad service in 1982 after flood damage and declining freight traffic levels resulted in the track being abandoned. Plans were made to revive railroad service from the newly formed Fremont & Elkhorn Valley Railroad, who purchased the abandoned C&NW; track. However, the costs were too high to revive railroad service, and the tracks were removed in 1988.

Livestock industry Wisner is known as the livestock center of Nebraska; their economic activities include farming, and cattle and hog feeding. There are approximately 130,000 cattle boarders feeding in Wisner over 15 feedlots at one time. Louis Dinklage, a pioneer of commercial cattle feeding, got his start in Wisner and funded many of Wisner's public attractions. =Louis Dinklage and Dinklage Co.= Louis Dinklage was inducted into the Cattle Feeders Hall of Fame in 2013. Dinklage is considered one of the pioneers of commercial cattle feeding. He started his operation with only 25 to 30 head of cattle, but by 1923 had expanded to 400 head of cattle. He originally had a goal of 1,000 head of cattle, but by the late 1930s he fed roughly 3,000 to 4,000 head of cattle with a shovel and a team of horses. By the 1960s, Dinklage had 65,000 head of cattle, which made him the largest private cattle-feed operator in the United States. Louis Dinklage influenced and mentored many of Nebraska's top cattle feeders and was instrumental in founding Dinklage Feedyards. =Herman Dinklage, Inc. and tornado devastation= Wisner and surrounding areas were hit by the Tornado outbreak of June 16‚Äì18, 2014. Herman Dinklage, Inc., a farming company owned and operated by Jeff and David Dinklage, was completely leveled to the ground. Jeff Dinklage, a 4th generation farmer, and his family had operated the farm on this land for almost a century. The Dinklage barn, farm equipment, including a planter, combine, and bailer, and home were destroyed as well as nearly 300 cattle killed. Wisner landmarks Dinklage Park‚ÄîOriginally known as \\"City Park\\", it was donated to the city by the railroad. Located next to the original Wisner high school building, it featured a large gazebo and was often the site for graduations and school activities. In 1960, a swimming pool was built on the site, and that pool was replaced in 1982 with a heated, Olympic-sized pool courtesy of contributions by Wisner cattleman Louis Dinklage. The park was renamed in honor of Louis and his wife Abby Faye in 1982. Dutch Hollow‚ÄîFormerly a wooded valley at the base of Nye Hill, it became one of the earliest settled parts of Wisner, and many of its oldest houses can be found here. Ninth Street in Wisner directly runs the route that Dutch Hollow ran, and this street is still referred to as \\"Dutch Hollow\\" by residents. Elkhorn River‚ÄîWisner is located directly on the border of this tributary of the Platte River, and it has been the source of several momentous events, such as major floods in 1966 and 1994, as well as a barge accident that killed three children in 1888. Because the river runs at a southeast angle, the roads of Wisner run a similar path, and very few roads in Wisner actually run truly north, south, east or west, but at a severely altered angle. In June 2010 floodwaters washed away the approach to the bridge, inconveniencing local travel and commerce. Kane's Lake‚ÄîA lake located directly south of the Elkhorn River, and the lake for which the unincorporated \\"Lakeview\\" (Wisner's original name) was named. Land of Nod‚ÄîThis was an amusement park located just north of today's River Park, from 1917‚Äì1940. Founded by Wisner businessman Andy Peterson, it featured livestock show barns, a dance hall and an ice skating rink and was the site of Wisner's first baseball diamond. It was an ambitious project that ultimately failed (mostly due to the development of the nearby City Park). Only the park's brick pillared entry and Peterson's home remains standing. Nye Hill‚ÄîThe hill upon which a major portion of the city was built, and it was named for the veterinarian who built his home directly upon it, and who owned the majority of the surrounding property. His home and the barn that he used for his practice still remain today. River Park‚ÄîAlso called \\"Community Park\\" and perched directly by the Elkhorn River, this was built on land purchased by the city of Wisner in 1927. Over the years it has been the site of community baseball games (including several state tournaments), high school football (1933‚Äì1968), as well as snowmobile and motorcross racing. Most recently, two fields for softball and youth baseball have been added (the softball fields have both served as the home field for the Wisner-Pilger High School softball team since the school started playing the sport in 2007), as well as a tractor pull arena for the annual \\"Thunder By The River\\" competition. It also features a rodeo arena and show barns for livestock shows, and has been the site for countless community concerts and activities. Rock Creek‚ÄîThe primary tributary of the Elkhorn River in the region, located south of Wisner. It was the site of an unincorporated collection of German farmers in the late 19th century who felt shunned by area communities, particularly Wisner and Beemer, Nebraska. The farmers formed a baseball team that became well known throughout Nebraska and Iowa, and was known for drawing large crowds to its games. The \\"Rock Creek Tigers\\" played until 1952, when fielding a team became too expensive, and its remaining players began playing for Wisner and the West Point, Nebraska Bombers.Wisner News-Chronicle, April 11, 1952 West Field‚ÄîA pasture owned by the West family, where Wisner High first played football through 1930. The Wisner Auditorium, the community tennis courts and the Wisner volunteer fire department are now located on this property. \\"The Blacktop\\"‚ÄîAn asphalt-paved two-lane road leading south of Wisner, crossing the Elkhorn River. The road was paved in 1964, as the newly constructed Elkhorn River Bridge made it the only route into Wisner from the south. Its true name is \\"6th Road\\" (named in 1995 when postal routes were re-defined), but residents south of Wisner (including the Rock Creek community, which lies directly on its route) refer to it as \\"The Blacktop\\", after a regional nickname for its asphalt surface. The road connects U.S. Highway 275 Highway to Nebraska Highway 32, which has made it well known as a significant shortcut to Lincoln, Nebraska for area travelers. U.S. Route 275‚ÄîKnown as \\"Highway 275\\", it runs directly through Wisner, forming Wisner's main street and business district. Plans to divert Highway 275 to routes north of town (as part of a four lane expressway project) have been continually discussed, with local businesses hoping for a portion of the highway's traffic to continue to run through Wisner.

It enters South Sioux City via a bridge over the Missouri River, and crosses the southern end of South Sioux City with interchanges at Dakota Avenue (the city's main street) and U.S. Route 77. Interstate 129 overlaps U.S. routes 20 and 75. Siouxland Veterans Memorial Bridge * U.S. Route 77 is a north-south highway whose northern terminus is at Interstate 29 in Sioux City. From there, it enters South Sioux City via the Siouxland Veterans Memorial Bridge, follows Dakota Avenue to 9th Street, then arcs west and south as a four-lane bypass around the city. In 1989, a large strip mall anchored by Wal-Mart and Hy-Vee opened along the bypass and effectively shifted the city's primary retail district from Dakota Avenue, in the center of town, to the western edge of the city. =Public transit= Local bus service to South Sioux City is provided by the Sioux City Transit System. =Aviation= The nearest commercial airport is Sioux Gateway Airport/Colonel Bud Day Field (SUX) in Sioux City.

Chadron also is the United States Forest Service headquarters of the Nebraska and Samuel R. McKelvie National Forests, and the Buffalo Gap, Fort Pierre, and Oglala National Grasslands. The Museum of the Fur Trade is located near Chadron, at the site of the American Fur Company's former Bordeaux Trading Post. History Succeeding cultures of indigenous peoples lived in the area for thousands of years. In historic times, tribes such as the Oglala Lakota (Oglala Sioux Tribe), Cheyenne and others lived in the area. The Sioux used this territory as a hunting ground after pushing other tribes to the west. Chadron is named for Louis Chartran, a French-Indian (M√©tis) fur trapper who ran a trading post on Chadron Creek in 1841. He was married to a Native American woman. In 1884 the town was formally established when the Fremont, Elkhorn, and Missouri Valley Railroad was constructed through the area from Omaha, Nebraska, en route to Wyoming. Chadron was first named O'Linn for its founder Fannie O'Linn, who built a community at the confluence of the White River (Missouri River) and Chadron Creek. This is where the railroad was expected to branch. When it was built six miles away on Bordeaux Creek, the townspeople packed up the entire town‚Äîbuildings included‚Äîand moved it to the new location.\\"Chadron history\\" , Chadron Chamber of Commerce, retrieved December 24, 2007 Among the founders of the town were the businessman Charles Henry King and his wife Martha. King established retail and freight businesses and banks in towns along the railroad's route; he capitalized on the flow of settlers and pioneers to the region. Four of the five King children were born in Chadron, including their second son Leslie Lynch King. In 1908 the family moved to Omaha, the business center of the state. In 1912 Leslie married, and in July 1913 became the father of the future president, Gerald Ford. King and his wife divorced soon after that.

The population was 997 at the 2010 census. It was incorporated in 1886 and was named for the late Captain Emmet Crawford, who had been stationed at nearby Fort Robinson. History The Fremont, Elkhorn and Missouri Valley Railroad reached Fort Robinson in 1886 on its way to Wyoming. Several miles east of the Fort, the railroad passed through a tree claim belonging to William Annin (also spelled \\"Annon\\"), who sold his claim for a new townsite. The \\"tent city\\" that sprang up around the railroad was named after Lt. Emmet Crawford, who had been formerly stationed at Fort Robinson but was killed in Mexico in January 1886. The town's original plat was filed on June 21, 1886 by the Western Townsite Company. E.A. Thompson and William D. Edger (editor of the original Crawford Clipper) circulated a petition for Crawford to become a village, but upon getting only 69 of the 200 needed signatures, secured the remaining signatures from willing soldiers at Fort Robinson. Crawford was incorporated in August 1886. Seeking entertainment, the soldiers kept the town supplied with much business during its early years. Crawford was a very wild frontier town, and was home to many saloons and brothels. Calamity Jane came to Crawford from Deadwood, South Dakota with ten dancing girls and set up a tent south of town. Several murders took place in Crawford, most involving soldiers from Fort Robinson. C. 1910 depiction of Second Street (Crawford's main business thoroughfare) from Main Street. A second railroad, the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy, reached Crawford in 1889, providing an additional boost to the community. In 1907 Crawford became a city, and by 1911 Crawford had the seventh-most business volume in Nebraska. Through the following years, the town had a variety of industries, including a brick works, mica mill, pickle factory, and a Nash Finch Company warehouse. Crawford lobbied for a state normal school, but the state decided to place the school (now Chadron State College) in nearby Chadron. The state thought that Crawford's proximity to Fort Robinson would not be good for the school's young women students. The Elite Theater was established about 1910 in a converted saloon. The theater was owned and operated by Mrs. Georgianna Higgins, thought to be the first woman theater owner in the United States. Crawford's population peaked at 2,536 in 1910, largely because of the Kinkaid Act. It attracted many new settlers to western Nebraska who could claim public land for homesteading. But many found it impossible to successfully conduct dry-land farming on the 640-acre plots made available, and began to sell out to ranchers. The population of Crawford reflected that change and dropped to 1,646 by 1920. Businesses declined with the loss of customers. The town made some minor recovery, and the population was 1,845 in 1940. Because of urbanization and people seeking jobs, and the decline of family agriculture on the Great Plains, the population has been steadily decreasing since. In the Lakota language, Crawford is known as ogl√≠yotake ot»ü√∫≈ãwahe, or \\"Return and Settle City\\". Geography Crawford is located at (42.683617, -103.412297).

Finding the site congenial, and concerned about the \\"Border War\\" in Kansas, they opted to remain there, founding a nearby townsite that they named Franklin. The site grew with the arrival of new parties of settlers. One such party brought a steam-powered sawmill and meal-grinder, the first steam mill in Dodge County.Perkey, Elton A (1995). Perkey's Nebraska Place Names. Nebraska State Historical Society. p. 61. In 1858, Emerson's name was changed to Wallace, after a Philadelphia philanthropist who had offered to build a library in any town taking his name. In the 1860s, the town had a pontoon bridge across the Platte River allowing for trade with the farms to the south of the river making into the local grain market, a prime business opportunity for the incoming Union Pacific Railroad. The combined townsite arrived at its present name in 1864, when the Union Pacific (UP) Railroad bought a piece of ground for a depot on the proposed transcontinental railroad. For many years, surveys had showed the town's location as \\"the north bend\\" and was the northernmost point of the UP in the state of Nebraska. The residents and UP officials agreed on North Bend as the name for the town. The first train arrived in North Bend in 1866, and the town was platted by the railroad in 1867. By 1876, the population had reached 250; there were 21 businesses, a school, and two churches. The city's first newspaper, the Independent, was founded in 1879. Growth continued steadily.

Annexation Omaha after annexing Elkhorn Elkhorn, founded in 1865 by George Crawford and platted in 1867, was an independent municipality until it was annexed by the city of Omaha in 2005. In an attempt to prevent the annexation, Elkhorn almost simultaneously annexed several surrounding subdivisions in an attempt to bring the city's population above 10,000 citizens. Under state law, that would have prevented the city's forcible annexation by Omaha. On January 12, 2007, the Nebraska Supreme Court ruled in favor of Omaha, saying \\"‚Ä¶we conclude that Elkhorn ceased to exist as a separate municipality on March 24, 2005, the date that Omaha's annexation ordinance became effective.\\" The United States Supreme Court denied Elkhorn's request to hear the case on February 22, 2007. Omaha Mayor Mike Fahey said he tried for years to work with Elkhorn, whereby Elkhorn would not be annexed if the city did no further annexing of its own. Elkhorn representatives did not consider that a fair proposal and refused. Omaha began the process of annexing Elkhorn. The two municipalities went to court as Elkhorn attempted to block the forcible annexation by Omaha. It was not until after losing the first round in the courts that Elkhorn offered to reach an agreement with Omaha. Omaha, having won in the courts and already financially invested in the court fights, refused to deal with Elkhorn and continued the annexation process. Elkhorn ceased to be an independent municipality on March 1, 2007.

A year later the town was platted by future Omaha mayor Roy N. Towl. A petition to incorporate the property as a village was submitted to the Douglas County Board of Commissions on June 22, 1912, which was adopted by the Board two days later on June 24. The still nascent village experienced a devastating blow to its development on Easter, March 23, 1913, when a tornado tore through the downtown area. The 1913 Easter Tornado was part of a March 1913 tornado outbreak sequence that ripped through the Southern and Midwestern regions of the United States.

The population was 591 at the 2010 census. History In 1870, Dr. Horace Greeley Smith and his wife filed a homestead claim at the site of present-day Exeter. In an earlier scouting trip, Smith had determined that the site would lie near the line of the Burlington and Missouri River Railroad as it extended itself westward. In the fall of 1871, the Burlington and Missouri was completed through Fillmore County. To promote settlement along its line, the railroad established towns at intervals. Towns were named alphabetically as the railroad ran westward from Lincoln. In eastern Fillmore County, a town was established on land donated by Smith and by James Dolan. One of the families that had settled in the area had come from Exeter, New Hampshire, and it was proposed that the town be given that name. It was adopted, as being in keeping with the alphabetical sequence: Crete, Dorchester, Exeter, Fairmont, Grafton, Harvard, Inland, Juniata, Kenesaw, and Lowell. The railroad advertised the availability of free government land in Nebraska, bringing settlers from the eastern United States, and Czech, German, English, Irish, and Scandinavian immigrants. The town's growth was initially slow, but hastened in the late 1870s. In 1878, two large grain elevators were built and a number of businesses opened; the town's first newspaper, the Enterprise, was established in that year. In 1879, the town was incorporated; by that time, it had sixteen businesses. Geography Exeter is located at (40.644684, -97.449229).

In 1877, the first store opened and was followed by the village's first survey 1879. Railroad service arrived in 1879 with the Burlington Railroad reaching town. Incorporation of the village of Naponee took place on November 30, 1909. Like many places, Naponee suffered in the Great Depression and major dust storms and flooding of the Republican River in 1935 compounded these woes. Construction of the nearby Harlan County Dam in the 1940s nearly doubled the population from 200 to 400. Today Naponee remains a rural community with a stable population.

Its population was 12,459 at the 2010 census. Beatrice is located south of Lincoln on the Big Blue River and is surrounded by agricultural country. History Gage County was one of the 19 counties originally established by the Nebraska Territorial Legislature in 1854. At the time of its establishment, there were no settlers living within its boundaries. In 1857, the steamboat Hannibal, carrying 300 passengers up the Missouri River from St. Louis, Missouri to Nebraska City, Nebraska, ran aground near Kansas City, Missouri. While it was stranded, 35 of the passengers agreed to form the \\"Nebraska Association\\", under which name they would unite in seeking a townsite and establishing a settlement in the territory. After reaching Nebraska City, the Association divided itself into two exploratory parties, one of which went directly westward and the other southwest. The latter party located the site of Beatrice, at the point where the DeRoin Trail crossed the Big Blue River, and the whole Association decided to settle there. The settlement was named after Julia Beatrice Kinney, the 17-year-old daughter of Judge John F. Kinney, a member of the Association.At least one reference suggests that it was named for Beatrice, last-born child of Queen Victoria (1857‚Äì1944), see The Territorial Legislature selected Beatrice as the county seat of Gage County in 1857. The decision was challenged by Blue Springs, but was confirmed by the Legislature in 1859. In 1864, the Legislature dissolved the original Clay County (not the current Clay County, Nebraska), dividing its land between Gage and Lancaster Counties. The addition of this ground in the north placed Beatrice near the center of the enlarged county, strengthening its claim to the county seat. It continues to hold that position today. =Homestead Act= In 1862, the U.S. Congress passed the Homestead Act, which allowed settlers to claim of government land for a nominal fee. The law went into effect on January 1, 1863. Just after midnight on that day, Daniel Freeman persuaded a clerk to open the local Land Office so that he could file a claim for a homestead located west of Beatrice. His is regarded as the first of the 417 applications filed that day. In 1936, Congress created Homestead National Monument of America on the site of Freeman's claim. =Early development= The Big Blue River was both a help and a hindrance to the development of Beatrice. It provided the town with a water source, and produced ample power to operate the mills that were among the town's first industries. However, it represented a major obstacle to travelers on the Oregon Trail route; and floods frequently destroyed the dams and bridges in the area. Not until 1890 was a Big Blue bridge built in Beatrice that could survive for decades. In 1871, the Burlington and Missouri River Railroad constructed a line from Lincoln, Nebraska to Beatrice. In 1879, the Union Pacific Railroad built a line joining Beatrice to Marysville, Kansas. By 1890, the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad had also run tracks through Beatrice. The former international foods conglomerate, Beatrice Foods, (now a part of ConAgra Foods) was founded in Beatrice in 1894 as The Beatrice Creamery Company, by George Everett Haskell and William W. Bosworth. =Beatrice State Developmental Center= In 1885, the Nebraska legislature enacted legislation to establish the Institution for Feeble Minded Youth near Beatrice, subject to the city's donating a suitable parcel of land. Beatrice donated 40 acres, located east of the city limits, and the first residents were admitted in 1887. Over the following decades, the institution expanded greatly. By 1935, there were 1171 residents living on . The institution was largely self-supporting, operating a farm on which the residents did much of the work; in 1935, were under cultivation. In 1945, the institution was renamed the Beatrice State Home. Its resident population peaked at about 2300 in the late 1960s. From there it declined: new restrictions had been imposed on the use of unpaid labor by residents of institutions, and there was a national trend toward deinstitutionalization. In 1975, the Horacek v. Exon lawsuit was settled with a consent decree whereunder many of the residents of the Beatrice State Home were transferred to community-based mental health facilities. In that year, the institution's name was changed to the current Beatrice State Developmental Center. A 2006 investigation by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services revealed a number of severe deficiencies at the Center; after two years of appeals, the Center lost its Medicaid certification in 2009. As of 2011, the Center served about 175 clients. The majority had been diagnosed with \\"severe\\" or \\"profound\\" retardation; nearly all suffered from two or more other disabling conditions.

History The area that would eventually become Liberty was being settled by whites as early as 1855. The town itself was founded by early settler David Palmer (1838-1876), who ran a trading post in the area. Palmer drowned in a nearby river and was buried in the Liberty Cemetery. The town also grew from the influx of railroad laborers who built the tracks that went through the village. In its heyday in 1890, Liberty had a population of 469, enough to support three grocery stores, a meat market, a livery, a dry goods store, a hotel, a law office, a hardware store, an undertaker, a lumber yard and barbershops, and its own newspaper, The Liberty Journal. But the money panic of 1893 hit the village particularly hard, and it never recovered from the shock of many farmers selling what they could and leaving town.\\"Places Called Liberty and Tate\\", The Mathias Family Archives, 24 May 2000.

It is used in Tarot card games as well as divination.  Description  The Empress sits on a throne wearing a crown with twelve stars, holding a scepter in one hand. The scepter is representative of her power over life, her crown has twelve stars representing her dominance over the year, and her throne is in the midst of a field of grain, representative of her dominion over growing things. The Empress is representative of the productivity of the subconscious, seeded by ideas. She is meant to be the embodiment of the growth of the natural world, fertility, and what one knows or believes from the heart.Gray, E. (1960). The tarot revealed: A modern guide to reading the tarot cards. New York, N.Y.: Bell Publishing Company.  History  Waite and the other occultists are responsible for the starry crown, the emblem of Venus, the waterfall, and the vegetation and wildlife. In historical decks, the Empress sits on a throne, almost always holding a shield or orb in one hand and a scepter in the other. The shield typically bears an eagle, the heraldic emblem of the Holy Roman Empire. The Empress can be represented by Aphrodite, a figure from Greek mythology. The empress connects with the Death card, for she is accustomed to life, death and rebirth. File:RWS Tarot 03 Empress.jpgRider-Waite tarot deck, 1910  by ,  Interpretation  According to Waite's The Pictorial Key to the Tarot, The Empress is the inferior (as opposed to nature's superior) Garden of Eden, the \\"Earthly Paradise\\". Waite defines her as a ‚Äî a fruitful mother of thousands: \\"she is above all things universal fecundity and the outer sense of the Word, the repository of all things nurturing and sustaining, and of feeding others.\\" The Empress is a mother, a creator, and nurturer. In many decks she can be shown as pregnant. She can represent the creation of life, romance, art, or business. The Empress can represent the germination of an idea before it is ready to be fully born, and the need to be receptive to change. Waite writes that the card carries these several divinatory associations: > 3\\\\. THE EMPRESS.Fruitfulness, action, initiative, length of days; the > unknown, clandestine; also difficulty, doubt, ignorance. Reversed: Light, > truth, the unraveling of involved matters, public rejoicings; according to > another reading, vacillation.

It is used in game playing as well as in divination. Description and symbolism In many modern packs, the Hierophant is represented with his right hand raised in blessing or benediction, with two fingers pointing skyward and two pointing down, thus forming a bridge between Heaven and Earth reminiscent of that formed by the body of The Hanged Man. The Hierophant is thus a true \\"pontiff\\", in that he is the builder of the bridge between deity and humanity. In his left hand he held a triple cross. The Hierophant is typically male, even in decks that take a feminist view of the Tarot, such as the Motherpeace Tarot. The Hierophant was also known as \\"The Teacher of Wisdom\\". In most iconographic depictions, the Hierophant is seen seated on a throne between two pillars symbolizing Law and Liberty or obedience and disobedience, according to different interpretations. He wears a triple crown, and the keys to Heaven are at his feet. Sometimes he is shown with worshippers, as his alternate title is the Pope or, sometimes, Jupiter.Dummett, Michael and Ronald Decker. History of the Occult Tarot. Duckworth, 2002. The card is also known as \\"The High Priest\\", as a counterpart to \\"The High Priestess\\" (which itself is also sometimes known as \\"The Papess\\", as counterpart to \\"The Pope\\"). History The papacy was not just a religious force, but was a political and military force as well. When the tarot was invented, the Pope controlled a large portion of central Italy known as the Papal States. Renaissance culture did not question the abstract ideal of the Pope as God's human representative on Earth. In Tarot of Marseilles, he wears a red cape and a blue robe, in contrast to The Papess, who wears a blue cape and blue robe. The more commonly encountered modern name \\"Hierophant\\" is due to Antoine Court de G√©belin. According to de Gebelin, \\"hierophant\\" was the title of the chief priest in the Eleusinian mysteries (an ancient Greek ritual). Interpretation According to A.E. Waite's _Pictorial Key to the Tarot_ , the Hierophant card carries several divinatory associations: > 5\\\\. THE HIEROPHANT.Marriage, alliance, captivity, servitude; by another > account, mercy, and goodness; inspiration; the man to whom the Querent has > recourse. Reversed: Society, good understanding, concord, over kindness, > weakness.  References   External links  * The History of the Hierophant (Pope) Card from The Hermitage.

Grand Island has been given the All-America City Award three times (1955, 1967, and 1981‚Äì82) by the National Civic League. Grand Island is home to the Nebraska Law Enforcement Training Center, which is the sole agency responsible for training law enforcement officers throughout the state, as well as the home of the Southern Power District serving southern Nebraska. History In 1857, 35 German settlers left Davenport, Iowa, and headed west to Nebraska to start a new settlement on an island known by French traders as La Grande Isle, which was formed by the Wood River and the Platte River. The settlers reached their destination on July 4, 1857, and by September had built housing using local timber. Over the next nine years, the settlers had to overcome many hardships, including blizzards and conflicts with Native Americans. They set up farms but initially had no market to sell their goods until a market opened at Fort Kearny. When the Pike's Peak Gold Rush began, Grand Island was the last place travelers could obtain supplies before they crossed the plains. Grand Island, 1867 Surveyors from the Union Pacific Railroad (UP) laid out a town called Grand Island Station and many settlers living on Grand Island moved to the new town, located slightly inland from the island. In 1868 the railroad reached the area, bringing increased trade and business. Grand Island became the end of the east division of the railroad and UP built service facilities for their locomotives in the town as well as an elegant hotel for passengers providing a boost for the local economy. The cost of the railroad coming into town was the denudement of most of the hardwood trees on the island for use as ties for the railroad. By 1870, 1,057 people lived in the town and in 1872 the town was incorporated as Grand Island. In about 1890, sugar beets were introduced as a crop in Nebraska. The first sugar beet processing factory in the United States was built in the southwest part of Grand Island. =1980 tornadoes= On June 3, 1980, Grand Island was hit by a massive supercell storm. Through the course of the evening, the city was ravaged by seven tornadoes, the worst of which was rated F4 on the Fujita Scale. The hardest hit area of town was the South Locust business district. There were five deaths as a result of the tornadoes. Tornado Hill is a local landmark created as a direct result of the tornadoes. Debris that could not be recycled was burned near Fonner Park and what remained was buried within Ryder Park, on the west end of town. The base of the hill was a hole 6‚Äì8 feet deep and nearly 200 feet across, and the hill is 40 feet high. It is used for sledding in this otherwise flat area. A book, Night of the Twisters, by Ivy Ruckman, and movie were based on this event.

Environmental issues Construction of a primary water detention cell for flood control by the Central Platte River Natural Resources District, the city of Grand Island, Hall County, and Merrick County has been delayed by the slow cleanup of burning grounds with buried and unexploded gravel mines on the grounds of the former Cornhusker Army Ammunition Plant. In 1981, a plume of contaminated groundwater was discovered beneath the plant area, which occupies 20 square miles west of Grand Island. The plume extended to northeast of the plant for about five miles and migrated towards Grand Island. RDX was discovered at 371 parts per billion (ppb) and TNT at 445 ppb on the plant site and just over 100 ppb off-site. The safe drinking water standard for RDX and TNT is only 2 ppb. Cornhusker had produced bombs and explosives during World War II, the Korean War and Vietnam War, and had been put on standby status in October 1973. During munitions production, wastewater contaminated with explosives, and explosives-contaminated mops, buckets, and other equipment were buried in 56 earthen surface impoundments. Dried solids were periodically scraped from the impoundments and taken to the burning grounds for incineration and burial. After the discovery of contaminated groundwater in 1981, the Army extended Grand Island city water lines to rural subdivisions (that as of 2014 are part of the Capital Heights and Le Heights areas) in 1985 because wells may have exposed residents to the contaminated water. In 1987, the Army burned about 40,000 tons of explosives-contaminated soil. In 1993, city water lines in northwest and north-central Grand Island were extended. In 1998, a pump-and-treat facility that continues to operate was built to cycle contaminated water through an explosives residue-removal system and discharge it as clean water into Silver Creek. The Army injected \\"hot spots\\" of contamination with a molasses-based substance containing bacteria present under the T&E; Cattle Company feedlot to more quickly degrade RDX and TNT, which supposedly helped lower contamination levels. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the sites of bomb production lines (the so-called load line structures), were cleared and burned. , TNT is still present at 30 ppb, and 7 ppb for RDX in the hot spot under load line 1. , the most heavily-contaminated areas at Cornhusker are the burning grounds with buried and unexploded gravel mines. Their excavation proceeds very slowly, sifting one cubic yard at a time, because of the explosives' shock sensitivity. Excavation is expected to finish by January 2015, followed by environmental testing, estimated to take 24 to 36 months. State Fair In 2010 Grand Island became the home of the Nebraska State Fair. Transportation Interstate 80 is located four miles south of the city. U.S. Route 281 is the main north‚Äìsouth route in the city, running through the city's west edge south to Hastings, and north to O'Neill.

History St. Paul was founded by two young surveyors, James N. and Nicholas J. Paul, who had been surveying in Nebraska and the surrounding areas as the land opened to settlers. Struck by the beauty and the prospects of the Loup valley, they took out homesteads, successfully petitioned the state legislature to form a new county to be known as Howard County, and laid out the townsite. They brought the first settlers to the county in March 1871 and established the seat of government in St. Paul. Stillman Hazeltine put up the first building for a general store and town hall in the summer of 1871. That first building burned a few years later and the brick building which replaced it is still in use with his name and date 1871 on the front. When the town was to be named, a committee collected the suggested names in a hat and the name Athens was drawn. Since an Athens already existed in the state, Nebraska Senator Phineas W. Hitchcock suggested the name St. Paul in honor of the Paul brothers who founded it. It officially became the county seat by vote in 1874 and was incorporated in 1881. The first mayor was E.F. Clapp. During its first twenty years, Howard County was a typical western frontier with covered wagons, cowboys, huge cattle herds, rowdy railroad construction gangs, and Army detachments stationed within its borders. As settlers and the railroad extended north and west, the town of St. Paul served as an important trade center and quickly grew to a population of 2,000 residents. From 1882 until 1917, St. Paul was the home of Frank Iams, the nation's largest importer of European draft horses. Three-star General C.S. Irvine set record-shattering, long-distance flights in a B-29 shortly after World War II. Herbert Paul was Adjutant General of the Nebraska National Guard for 19 years. St. Paul had a broom factory, canning factory, brick factory, cigar factory, two flour mills, hatchery and more. Through the years innovation like the first self-rising flour was developed at one of the flour mills. The first chicken hatchery in Nebraska started in Cushing in 1901, moved to St. Paul in 1922, and operated until 1956. Pirus, a cure for many kidney and liver ailments, was invented in St. Paul. Dorothy Lynch invented her famous salad dressing in St. Paul, which is now sold nationally. The first two people executed in Nebraska's electric chair were sentenced for a murder they committed within Howard County. Grover Cleveland Alexander, who was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame, was born on a farm in the area and retired to St. Paul at the end of his sports career. The American Legion baseball field was dedicated on June 15, 1971, and named after Alexander. Each year St. Paul honors Alexander with the celebration of Grover Cleveland Alexander (GCA) Days, the weekend following the 4th of July.

The population was 3,942 at the 2010 census. Fairbury has been closely connected with railroading for much of its history. It was founded on the projected route of a railway, and grew as a shipping center. For nearly 80 years, it was the location of the Western Division headquarters of the Rock Island Railroad. Fairbury prospered with the Rock Island, and lost business and residents as the railroad declined. History =19th century= In 1868, James B. Mattingly, a freighter originally from Kentucky, established a sawmill on the banks of the Little Blue River. Shortly thereafter, Woodford G. McDowell, a capitalist from Fairbury, Illinois, came to Nebraska to plat a town along the route of the St. Joseph and Denver City Railroad, which was to follow the Little Blue. In 1869, Mattingly and McDowell each contributed for a new townsite, which they named after McDowell's hometown. The new town grew rapidly, even before the railroad's arrival. In 1870, a population of 370 was reported; in that year, the Fairbury Gazette was established. A year later, Fairbury was chosen as the county seat; in early 1872, the city was incorporated. By this time, its businesses included three hotels and five blacksmith shops. In 1872, the St. Joseph and Denver City reached Jefferson County. (The railroad was subsequently acquired by the Union Pacific and operated as the St. Joseph and Grand Island branch.) Fairbury became a shipping center: in the first half of 1873, it shipped 255 cars of grain and received 143 of lumber. By 1874, there were 600 residents; 44 businesses operated in the city. An 1879 fire, \\"supposed to have been the work of an incendiary\\", destroyed an estimated fourteen buildings, for a loss of $50,000, much of it uninsured. However, recovery was swift, and many of the destroyed frame buildings were replaced by more modern brick and stone structures. By 1882, the city's population had grown to 1,600. In 1885, the Campbell Brothers Circus began wintering in Fairbury. It continued to winter in and around the city until its closing in 1913. At its peak, the circus was the second-largest in the world. In 1886, the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad reached Fairbury. The city lay at the junction of the Rock Island's north-south and east-west lines; because of this, it was designated the headquarters of the railroad's Western Division. An extensive rail yard was constructed, including shops, storage and maintenance facilities, switching yards, and an 18-stall roundhouse. The railroad had a major impact on Fairbury: by 1890, the population had grown to 2,630. Jefferson County courthouse The brick courthouse had survived the fire of 1879; but soon thereafter, it proved too small to handle the county's increasing business and store its growing records. In 1882, the county began renting the top two floors of the newly constructed Opera House, and moved its offices there; but this too was quickly outgrown. In 1889, a $60,000 bond issue for the construction of a new courthouse passed; the new Romanesque Revival building was completed in 1892. Fairbury continued to prosper as the home of the Rock Island headquarters, which employed many locals directly and in supporting businesses. Commercial and residential development continued apace in Fairbury. Both of the city's banks survived the Panic of 1893. Boardwalks were replaced with brick sidewalks between 1892 and 1894; an electricity and waterworks powerhouse was constructed in 1895; and in 1898, electric street lights were installed. By 1900, the population had reached 3,140. South side of courthouse square in early 1900s =20th century= The decade from 1900 to 1910 saw the largest growth in Fairbury's history; the census of 1910 reported a population of 5,294, representing a sixty percent increase over the ten years. A major fire in 1903 swept the commercial district, destroying almost the entire block south of the courthouse square; the only building to survive was the original brick courthouse. Within a year, however, the entire block had been rebuilt. In 1909, E. J. Hested opened his dime store, The Fair Store, in one of the new buildings. Two years later, the name of the store was changed to Hested's. In 1925, the store moved into a new and larger building; the business expanded to over 150 stores in the Midwest and Mountain States before its acquisition by the J.J. Newberry chain in 1969. The 1910s and 1920s were the peak years for the Rock Island Railroad, with fourteen passenger trains passing through Fairbury daily, and with hundreds of Fairbury residents on the payroll. To accommodate this traffic, the railroad constructed a new depot, at a cost of $40,000. The city's commercial district underwent a considerable expansion, including two movie theaters and several large retail stores. In 1915, civic leaders began promoting the brick paving of Fairbury's downtown streets; by 1930, there were of paved road. The 1920s and 1930s saw a proliferation of automobile-related businesses, such as garages, gas stations, and repair shops. Fairbury was better situated than many communities to weather the Great Depression. Beside the railroad, it had a variety of industries, including the Fairbury Windmill Company, with a payroll of 50 people in 1930. The city continued to grow through the Depression, despite the difficulties of the Rock Island, which went into receivership in 1933 and did not emerge until 1948. The population of Fairbury peaked in 1950, at 6,395 residents. Fairbury Rock Island Depot Museum The conversion of the Rock Island to diesel locomotives, completed by 1952, rendered portions of the Fairbury yards obsolete. The decrease in passenger railway traffic after World War II led to the reduction of service, the closing of stations, and the abandonment of track. In 1965, the Rock Island's Chicago-to-Denver Rocky Mountain Rocket train ceased to run through Fairbury; in that same year, the railway relocated its Western Division headquarters from Fairbury to Des Moines, Iowa. 1965 was also the last year in which the Rock Island reported a profit. In 1975, it again entered receivership. A 1979 strike, unsuccessfully mediated by President Jimmy Carter, was the final nail in the railroad's coffin. The railroad's routes were operated for 60 days by the Kansas City Terminal Railway, to allow shipping of the 1979 Midwestern harvest; but in 1980, service to Fairbury ceased, and the depot was abandoned.

A member of the group since its inception, he has recorded 14 studio albums with them as well as one solo record. The Edge's understated style of guitar playing, a signature of U2's music, is distinguished by chiming timbres, use of rhythmic delay, drone notes, harmonics, and an extensive use of effects units. The Edge was born in England to a Welsh family, and was raised in Ireland after the Evans family moved there. In 1976, at Mount Temple Comprehensive School he formed a band with his fellow students and elder brother Dik that would evolve into U2. Inspired by the ethos of punk rock and its basic arrangements, the group began to write its own material. They eventually became one of the most successful acts in popular music, with albums such as 1987's The Joshua Tree and 1991's Achtung Baby. Over the years, the Edge has experimented with various guitar effects and introduced influences from several genres of music into his own style, including American roots music, industrial music, and alternative rock. With U2, the Edge has also played keyboards, co-produced their 1993 record Zooropa, and occasionally served as co-lyricist. The Edge met his second wife Morleigh Steinberg through her collaborations with the band. As a member of U2 and as an individual, the Edge has campaigned for human rights and philanthropic causes. He co-founded Music Rising, a charity to support musicians affected by Hurricane Katrina. He has collaborated with U2 bandmate Bono on several projects, including songs for Roy Orbison and Tina Turner, and the soundtracks to the musical Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark and the Royal Shakespeare Company's London stage adaptation of A Clockwork Orange. As a member of U2, the Edge has won 22 Grammy Awards and has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Several music publications have ranked the Edge among the greatest guitarists of all time. Early life David Howell Evans was born at the Barking Maternity Hospital,Dunphy (1988), p. 70 in the county of Essex in England, on 8 August 1961. He is the second child of Welsh parents Garvin and Gwenda Evans, both of whom originated from Llanelli, a coastal town in South Wales. Garvin was an engineer who worked for the local electricity board, and subsequently worked for the electronics company Plessey. The Edge has an elder brother Richard (often called Dik) and a younger sister called Gillian. The Evanses initially lived in Chadwell Heath, Essex. Around 1962, Garvin was offered a promotion and a transfer at his job, and the family subsequently moved to County Dublin, Ireland for him to take it. During his childhood in Dublin he possessed two differing accents to converse in, Welsh and Irish English, the former being used when he was in the family home and the latter when he was outside; as he later explained: \\"The reason for this dual identity was mainly to be understood by my peers but also to be accepted.\\" He received his initial formal education at St. Andrew's National School, in Malahide. As a child, he also received piano and guitar lessons, and practised music with Dik. The Edge received his first guitar at the age of seven when his mother bought him a Spanish guitar. He did not know how to properly tune it or hold it and referred to it as \\"little more than a toy\\", but he was fascinated by how cool it was. At the age of nine, the \\"first proper guitar\\" came to the Evans household when the Edge's mother purchased an old acoustic guitar at a jumble sale for a pound. He and Dik both experimented with this instrument, replacing the rusty wire strings with nylon ones and learning to properly play it. The Edge said in 1982 of this early experimentation, \\"me and my elder brother Dik both played it, plonking away, all very rudimentary stuff, open chords and all that.\\" Musical career =U2= The Edge performing at a U2 concert in Belfast in 2015 While the Evans brothers were at Mount Temple Comprehensive School in Dublin in 1976, they went along to a meeting in response to an advert posted by another pupil, Larry Mullen Jr., on the school's noticeboard seeking musicians to form a new band with him. Among the several other pupils who also responded to the note were Paul \\"Bono\\" Hewson and Adam Clayton.McCormick (2006), pp. 27‚Äì30 The band went through a number of reformations before becoming known as U2 in March 1978 (Richard Evans having left before this to join another band, leaving his younger brother as the lead guitarist).McCormick (2006), pp. 46‚Äì48 Early in the band's career, Evans was given the nickname \\"the Edge\\" by members of the Lypton Village surrealist street gang to which Bono belonged. The nickname is commonly believed to be derived from the angular shape of Evans' head.McCormick (2006), p. 68McGee (2008), p. 9 However, the origin of the name is disputed and other theories include a description of his guitar playing and his preference for not becoming fully involved and therefore remaining on the edge of things. U2 began its public performance life in small venues in Dublin in 1977, occasionally playing at other venues elsewhere in Ireland. In December 1979, they performed their first concerts outside Ireland, in London, and in 1980 began extensive touring across the British Isles, developing a following. Their debut album Boy was released in 1980. In 1981, leading up to the October Tour, Evans came very close to leaving U2 for religious reasons, but he decided to stay.McCormick (2006), pp. 117‚Äì120 During this period he became involved with a group called Shalom Tigers, in which bandmates Bono and Larry Mullen Jr. were also involved. Shortly after deciding to remain with the band, he wrote a piece of music that later became \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\". =Other musical pursuits= The Edge performing in 2009 In addition to his regular role within U2, the Edge has also recorded with such artists as Johnny Cash, B. B. King, Tina Turner, Ronnie Wood, Jah Wobble, Holger Czukay, Jay-Z, and Rihanna. The Edge connected with Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois collaborator Michael Brook (the creator of the infinite guitar, which he regularly uses), working with him on the score to the film Captive (1986). From this soundtrack the song \\"Heroine\\", the vocal of which was sung by a young Sin√©ad O'Connor was released as a single. He also created the theme song for season one and two of The Batman. He and fellow U2 member Bono wrote the theme of the 1995 James Bond film GoldenEye. The Edge, along with Bono, composed a musical adaptation of Spider-Man. On 25 May 2011, a single titled \\"Rise Above 1\\" by Reeve Carney featuring Bono and the Edge was released digitally. The music video was released on 28 July 2011. In 2008, the Edge participated in the Davis Guggenheim-directed documentary film It Might Get Loud. The film examines the history of the electric guitar, focusing on the careers and styles of the Edge, Jimmy Page, and Jack White. The film premiered on 5 September 2008 at the Toronto International Film Festival On 29 April 2016, the Edge performed in the Sistine Chapel as part of a conference for the Angiogenesis Foundation, making him the first rock artist to stage a concert at the site. Musical style = Guitar playing = The Edge's style of playing guitar is distinguished by his chiming timbres,Gulla (2009), pp. 57‚Äì65 echoing notes, sparse voicings, and extensive use of effects units. He favours the perfect fifth interval and often plays chords consisting of just two notes, the fifth and the root note, while eliminating the third.McCormick (2006), pp. 72‚Äì75 This style is not explicitly in a minor or major key, but implies both, creating a musical ambiguity. For these chords, he often plays the same notes on multiple strings, some which are left open, creating an Irish-influenced drone. Against this drone, he changes other notes to imply a harmony.Calhoun (2018), p. 17 Among the Edge's signature techniques are playing arpeggios, sixteenth note percussive strumming, and harmonics, the latter of which he described as \\"so pure and finely-focused that [they have] the incredible ability to pierce through [their] environment of sound, just like lightning\\". The Edge takes a relatively understated approach to guitar playing, viewing notes as \\"expensive\\" and preferring to play simple parts that best serve their song.Flanagan (1996), pp. 44‚Äì45 He eschews virtuosity in favour of \\"atmospherics, subtlety, minimalism, and clever signal processing\\", according to Guitar Player. Rather than emulate common playing styles, the Edge is interested in \\"tearing up the rule book\\" and finding new ways to approach the instrument. He cited guitarists such as Tom Verlaine of Television, Rory Gallagher, and Patti Smith as some of his strongest influences. The Edge playing his signature guitar, the Gibson Explorer The Edge's guitar sound is frequently modulated with a delay effect set to a dotted eighth note for rhythmic effect. After acquiring his first delay pedal, the Electro-Harmonix Memory Man,McGee (2008), pp. 29‚Äì31 he became fascinated with how to use its return echo to \\"fill in notes that [he's] not playing, like two guitar players rather than one\\". The effect unit became a mainstay in his guitar rig and had a significant impact on the band's creative output. The Edge became known for his extensive use of effects units, and for his meticulous nature in crafting specific sounds and guitar tones from his equipment choices. Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page called him a \\"sonic architect\\", while Neil McCormick described him as an \\"effects maestro\\". Critics have variously referred to the Edge's guitar sounds as evoking the image of fighter planes on \\"Bullet the Blue Sky\\", resembling a \\"dentist's drill\\" on \\"Love Is Blindness\\", and resembling an \\"airplane turbine\\" on \\"Mofo\\". The Edge said that rather than using effects merely to modify his sound, he uses them to spark ideas during his songwriting process. The Edge developed his playing style during his teenage years, partially as a result of him and Mullen trying to accommodate the \\"eccentric\\" bass playing of Clayton by being the timekeepers of the band. In their early days, the Edge's only guitar was his 1976 Gibson Explorer Limited Edition, which became a signature of the group.McGee (2008), p. 18 However, he found the sound of the Explorer's bass strings unsatisfactory and avoided them in his playing early on, resulting in a trebly sound. He said by focusing \\"on one area of the fretboard [he] was developing a very stylized way of doing something that someone else would play in a normal way\\". Other equipment choices contribute to the Edge's unique sound. His 1964 Vox AC30 \\"Top Boost\\" amplifier (housed in a 1970s cabinet) is favoured for its \\"sparkle\\" tone, and is the basis for his sound both in the studio and live. The Edge has also used plectrums manufactured by the German company Herdim that he turns sideways or upside down so the dimpled grip strums against the strings, resulting in a \\"rasping top end\\" to his guitar tone. About his playing style, the Edge said in 1982: = Vocals = The Edge singing backing vocals into a headset microphone in 2019 The Edge provides the backing vocals for U2. Their 1983 live album and video release, Under a Blood Red Sky and U2 Live at Red Rocks: Under a Blood Red Sky are good reference points for his singing (as are the live DVDs from the Elevation Tour, U2 Go Home: Live from Slane Castle and Elevation 2001: Live from Boston). For example, he sings the chorus to \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\" (Bono harmonises on the final 'Sunday'). U2 used this tradeoff technique later in \\"Bullet the Blue Sky\\" as well. His backing vocals are sometimes in the form of a repeated cry; examples of songs that use this approach include \\"Beautiful Day\\", \\"New Year's Day\\" and \\"Stay (Faraway, So Close!)\\". Another technique he uses in his backing vocals is the falsetto, in songs such as \\"Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of\\", \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own\\", \\"A Man and a Woman\\", \\"The Wanderer\\", live versions of \\"The Fly\\", and \\"Window in the Skies\\". The Edge sings the lead vocal on \\"Van Diemen's Land\\" and \\"Numb\\", the first half of the song \\"Seconds\\", dual vocals with Bono in \\"Discotheque\\", and the bridge in the song \\"Miracle Drug\\". He also sings the occasional lead vocal in live renditions of other songs (such as \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\" during the PopMart Tour and \\"Party Girl\\" during the Rotterdam Zoo TV show when it was Bono's birthday), and has sung the second verse of the \\"Stand by Me\\" cover on a few shows. A solo acoustic version of the song \\"Love is Blindness\\", that is featured in the documentary film From the Sky Down, is sung by him as well. = Other instruments = He has played keyboards on many of the band's songs, including \\"I Fall Down\\", \\"October\\", \\"So Cruel\\", \\"New Year's Day\\", \\"Running to Stand Still\\", \\"Miss Sarajevo\\", \\"The Hands that Built America\\", and \\"Original of the Species\\" and others. In live versions of \\"New Year's Day\\", \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\", \\"Your Blue Room\\", \\"Moment of Surrender\\" and \\"Raised By Wolves\\", he plays both the piano and guitar parts alternately. In most live versions of \\"Original of the Species,\\" piano is the only instrument played during the song. Although the Edge is the band's lead guitarist, he occasionally plays bass guitar, including the live performances of the song \\"40\\" where the Edge and bassist Adam Clayton switch instruments. =Equipment= The Edge playing a Fender Stratocaster on the Zoo TV Tour in 1993 The Edge plays electric guitar, acoustic guitar, keyboards, piano, bass guitar (on \\"40\\" and \\"Race Against Time\\") and lap steel guitar. Detailed gear diagrams of the Edge's U2 guitar rig for the 1981 October Tour,Cooper, Adam (18 March 2012). \\"The Edge's 1981 Guitar Rig\\".

In 2016, Fender unveiled a signature model of guitar and amplifier designed in collaboration with the Edge: the Edge Signature Stratocaster and the Fender Edge Deluxe, respectively. Personal life Evans was brought up as a Protestant Christian, and was, along with fellow band members Bono and Mullen, involved with non-denominational Christian group the Shalom Fellowship as an adult.https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/church-u2 Evans married his secondary school girlfriend Aislinn O'Sullivan on 12 July 1983.McCormick (2006), p. 144 They have three daughters: Hollie (born in 1984), Arran (in 1985) and 'Blue Angel' (in 1989). The couple separated in 1990, but were unable to get legally divorced because of Irish laws regarding marriage annulment at the time; divorce was legalised in 1995, and the couple legally divided in 1996. In 1993, he began dating Morleigh Steinberg, an American professional dancer who was employed by the band as a choreographer and on-stage belly dancer during the Zoo TV Tour. They have a daughter, Sian (born 1997), and a son, Levi (born 25 October 1999). The couple were married in 2002. Evans has been criticised for his efforts to build five luxury mansions on a 156-acre (63.13-hectare) plot of land in Malibu, California. The California Coastal Commission voted 8‚Äì4 against the plans. The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy agreed to remain neutral on the issue following a US$1 million donation from Evans and a commitment to designate 100 acres of the land as open space for public footpaths. =Philanthropy= US Deputy Secretary of Agriculture Stephen Censky and Angiogenesis Foundation co-founder Dr. William W. Li The Edge, Bob Ezrin and Henry Juszkiewicz co-founded Music Rising in 2005, a charity that helped provide replacement instruments for those that were lost in Hurricane Katrina. The instruments were originally only replaced for professional musicians but they soon realised the community churches and schools needed instruments as well. The charity's slogan is \\"Rebuilding the Gulf Region note by note\\" and has so far helped over a hundred musicians who were affected by Hurricane Katrina. The Edge also serves on the board of the Angiogenesis Foundation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organisation dedicated to improving global health by advancing angiogenesis-based medicine, diets, and lifestyle. Legacy In 2007, the Edge was awarded an honorary doctorate of music from Berklee College of Music. In 2010, Gibson ranked him the 23rd-best guitarist of all time, saying that he \\"created a sound that is distinctly his own ‚Äì no small feat when you consider he's had to do it in the course of three decades while working shoulder-to-shoulder with one of the biggest personalities in rock, Bono\\". The following year, Rolling Stone placed the Edge at number 38 on its list of \\"The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\\"; Daniel Lanois called him an \\"innovative mind\\", a \\"scientist, and a poet by night\\", and said he is \\"dedicated to note-taking\\" to \\"document every detail of his sound\\". In 2012, Spin ranked him 13th on their list of the 100 greatest guitarists, saying that he \\"masked and flaunted his willful ignorance of how guitars are meant to be played with forgiving delay pedals, forging a sonic trademark so distinctive that his band's name became an adjective\\". In 2015, Rolling Stone ranked Bono and the Edge at number 35 on its list of the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time. At the 2017 Bonnaroo Music Festival, the Edge was honoured with the Les Paul Spirit Award by the Les Paul Foundation for being someone who \\"exemplifies the spirit of the late, great Les Paul through innovation, engineering, technology and/or music\\".

He has resided in County Dublin, Ireland since his family moved to Malahide in 1965, when he was five years old. Clayton attended Mount Temple Comprehensive School, where he met schoolmates with whom he co-founded U2 in 1976. A member of the band since its inception, he has recorded 14 studio albums with U2. Clayton's bass playing style is noted for its \\"harmonic syncopation\\", giving the music a driving rhythm. He is well known for his bass playing on songs such as \\"Gloria\\", \\"New Year's Day\\", \\"Bullet the Blue Sky\\", \\"With or Without You\\", \\"Mysterious Ways\\", \\"Vertigo\\", \\"Get on Your Boots\\", and \\"Magnificent\\". He has worked on several solo projects throughout his career, such as his work with fellow band member Larry Mullen Jr. on the 1996 version of the \\"Theme from Mission: Impossible\\". As a member of U2, Clayton has received 22 Grammy Awards and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2005. Early life Adam Charles Clayton, the oldest child of Brian and Jo Clayton, was born on 13 March 1960 in Chinnor, Oxfordshire, England. His father was a pilot with the Royal Air Force, who moved into civil aviation, and his mother was a former airline stewardess. When he was 4 years old, Clayton's father worked in Kenya as a pilot with East African Airways, the family being resident in Nairobi (Clayton regards this as the happiest period of his childhood). In 1965, the family moved to Malahide, northern County Dublin, Ireland, where Clayton's brother Sebastian was born. The Clayton family became friends with the Evans family (including their son David Evans (\\"The Edge\\"), who would later co-found the band U2 with Clayton).McCormick (2006), pp. 11‚Äì13, 24 When he was eight years old, Clayton was sent to the private junior boarding Castle Park School in Dalkey, southern County Dublin. Not being sports-oriented, Adam did not enjoy the school or respond well to its ethos; he found it difficult to settle socially there. He was interested in pop music, which students were not allowed to listen to. He joined the School's \\"Gramphone Society\\", which met to listen to classical music. He also took piano lessons for a short time. His introduction to the world of popular music was around the age of 10, listening to rock operas such as Jesus Christ Superstar and Hair, and other material that was midway between classical and popular music. At age 13, Clayton entered the private St Columba's College secondary school in Rathfarnham, Dublin. Here he made friends with other pupils who were enthusiastic about the pop/rock music acts of the period, including the Who, the Beatles, the Grateful Dead, and Carole King. In response he bought a ¬£5 acoustic guitar from a junk-shop near the Dublin quays, and began learning elementary chords and songs. John Leslie, who shared a bunk bed with Clayton at St. Columba's, persuaded him to join in with a school band where Clayton would play the bass guitar for the first time. His mother purchased a bass for him when he was 14 years old on the basis of a given promise that he would commit himself to learn to play the instrument.In the name of the son and the father Clayton later changed school to the non-boarding Mount Temple Comprehensive School in Dublin, where he met future U2 bandmates Paul Hewson (\\"Bono\\") and Larry Mullen Jr., who were also pupils there, and was reunited with his childhood friend David Evans.McCormick (2006), pp. 40‚Äì46 Musical career = U2 = Clayton playing in Charlottesville, Virginia on 1 October 2009 In September 1976, Mullen put an advert onto the school's bulletin board seeking other musicians to form a band; Clayton showed up for the first meeting and practice, so did the Edge with his older brother Richard Evans (\\"Dik\\"), Bono, and Ivan McCormick and Peter Martin who were two of Mullen's friends. McCormick and Martin left the band soon after its inception. While the band was a five-piece (consisting of Bono, the Edge, Mullen, Dik Evans, and Clayton) it was known as \\"Feedback\\". The name was subsequently changed to \\"The Hype\\", but changed to \\"U2\\" soon after Dik Evans left. Clayton stood in as the nearest thing that the band had to a manager in its early life, handing over the duties to Paul McGuinness in May 1978.McCormick (2006), pp. 52‚Äì56, 59‚Äì62 In 1981, around the time of U2's second, spiritually charged album, October, a rift was created in the band between Clayton and McGuinness, and the three other band members. Bono, The Edge, and Mullen had joined a Christian group, and were questioning the compatibility of rock music with their spirituality. However, Clayton, with his more ambiguous religious views, was less concerned, and so was more of an outsider. In 1995, after the Zoo TV Tour and Zooropa album, Clayton headed to New York with bandmate Mullen to receive formal training in the bass; until then Clayton had been entirely self-taught. During that period, he worked on U2's experimental album, released under the pseudonym \\"Passengers\\", entitled Original Soundtracks 1. That album features one of the few instances where Clayton has appeared as a vocalist; he spoke the last verse of \\"Your Blue Room\\", the album's second single. Prior to this Clayton had only provided live backing vocals to tracks such as \\"Out of Control\\", \\"I Will Follow\\", \\"Twilight\\", and \\"Bullet the Blue Sky\\". Since the 1997 PopMart Tour, Clayton has not sung live in any capacity for the band. =Other projects= Clayton has worked on several side projects throughout his career. He played (along with the other members of U2) on Robbie Robertson's self-titled album from 1987, and has also performed with Maria McKee. Clayton played on the song \\"The Marguerita Suite\\" on Sharon Shannon's self-titled debut album which was released in October 1991.McGee (2008), p. 138 He joined U2 producer Daniel Lanois and bandmate Larry Mullen Jr. on Lanois's 1989 album Acadie, playing the bass on the songs \\"Still Water\\" and \\"Jolie Louise\\". In 1994, Clayton played bass alongside Mullen on Nanci Griffith's album Flyer, appearing on the songs \\"These Days in an Open Book\\", \\"Don't Forget About Me\\", \\"On Grafton Street\\" and \\"This Heart\\". In 1996, Clayton and Mullen contributed to the soundtrack to the 1996 film Mission: Impossible by re-recording the \\"Theme from Mission: Impossible\\". The song reached number 7 on the Billboard Hot 100, and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance (Orchestra, Group or Soloist) in 1997. Clayton was also featured on Steven Van Zandt's 1999 album Born Again Savage. Musical style Clayton in October 2018 Clayton's style of bass guitar playing is noted for what instructor Patrick Pfeiffer called \\"harmonic syncopation\\". With this technique, Clayton plays a consistent rhythm that stresses the eighth note of each bar, but he \\"anticipates the harmony by shifting the tonality\\" before the guitar chords do. This gives the music a feeling of \\"forward motion\\".Jobling (2014), p. 243 Initially, Clayton had no formal musical training;McCormick (2006), pp. 30, 34 Bono said of Clayton's early bass playing, \\"Adam used to pretend he could play bass. He came round and started using words like 'action' and 'fret' and he had us baffled. He had the only amplifier, so we never argued with him. We thought this guy must be a musician; he knows what he's talking about. And then one day, we discovered he wasn't playing the right notes. That's what's wrong, y'know?\\" In the band's early years, Clayton generally played simple bass parts in time consisting of steady eighth notes emphasising the roots of chords. Over time, he incorporated influences from Motown and reggae into his playing style, and as he became a better timekeeper, his playing became more melodic. Author Bill Flanagan said that he \\"often plays with the swollen, vibrating bottom sound of a Jamaican dub bassist, covering the most sonic space with the smallest number of notes\\". Flanagan said that Clayton's playing style perfectly reflected his personality: \\"Adam plays a little behind the beat, waiting till the last moment to slip in, which fits Adam's casual, don't-sweat-it personality.\\"Flanagan (1996), pp. 208‚Äì209 Clayton relies on his own instincts when developing basslines, deciding whether to follow the chord progressions of the guitars or play a counter-melody, and when to play an octave higher or lower. He cites bassists such as Paul Simonon, Bruce Foxton, Peter Hook, Jean-Jacques Burnel, and James Jamerson as major influences on him. He credits Burnel for his choice of instrument: \\"I remember hearing the bass on 'Hanging Around' and immediately knowing it was going to be the instrument for me\\". Describing his role in U2's rhythm section with drummer Larry Mullen Jr., Clayton's said, \\"Larry's drums have always told me what to play, and then the chords tell me where to go\\". One of Clayton's most recognizable basslines is from \\"New Year's Day\\", which was borne out of an attempt to play Visage's song \\"Fade to Grey\\".McCormick (2006), p. 136 Clayton has sung on some occasions, including on the song \\"Endless Deep\\", the B-side to the single \\"Two Hearts Beat As One\\" from 1983. Clayton also sang backup vocals on \\"I Will Follow\\", \\"Twilight\\", \\"Trip Through Your Wires\\" and also on some occasions on \\"With or Without You\\" and \\"Bullet the Blue Sky\\" during live performances. He also spoke the last verse of \\"Your Blue Room\\". Clayton can be heard speaking on \\"Tomorrow ('96 Version)\\" (a rerecording of \\"Tomorrow\\" that he arranged) a song from U2's 1981 album October. He plays the guitar on a few occasions, most notably the song \\"40\\", where he and guitarist the Edge switch instruments. He also plays the keyboards on \\"City of Blinding Lights\\" and \\"Iris (Hold Me Close)\\". Musical equipment  Clayton with Warwick Star Bass in 2010 Claytons first bass was a walnut brown Ibanez Musician, which he played heavily from the recording of Boy and well though the War era. Two years later, at the age of 16, Clayton asked his father to purchase a second- hand Precision for him when Brian Clayton travelled to New York, as he felt he needed a better guitar to master the instrument. For the rest of his career, he was mainly known for using various Fender Precision and Jazz basses. Clayton's Precision basses have been modified with a Fender Jazz neck. In an interview with Bass Player magazine, he said that he prefers the Jazz bass neck because it is more \\"lady-like\\" and is a better fit in his left hand. In 2011 the Fender Custom Shop produced a limited-edition signature Precision Bass built to his own specifications in a limited run of 60 pieces, featuring an alder body and a gold sparkle finish. In 2014, Fender announced a signature Adam Clayton Jazz Bass guitar, modeled after a Sherwood Green 1965 Jazz Bass he played during the 2001 Elevation Tour. Clayton's basses include: * Fender Precision Bass * Fender Jazz Bass * Ibanez Musician Bass * Warwick Adam Clayton Reverso Signature Bass * Warwick Streamer Bass * Warwick Star Bass II * Gibson Thunderbird Bass * Gibson Les Paul Triumph Bass * Gibson Les Paul 70's Recording Bass, unknown model * Gibson Les Paul Signature Bass * Lakland Joe Osborn Signature Bass * Lakland Darryl Jones Signature Bass (with Chi- Sonic pick-ups) * Auerswald Custom Bass * Epiphone Rivoli bass (seen in the \\"Get on Your Boots\\" music video) * Rickenbacker 4001 Bass - used in the early days of U2 circa 1978/79 * Status John Entwistle Buzzard Bass * Gibson RD Bass For amplification Clayton started out on Ashdown amplifiers, and later switched to using Aguilar amplifiers. * Aguilar DB 751 bass amp * Aguilar DB 410 & 115 cabs Personal life Clayton served as the best man in Bono's wedding to Alison Hewson (n√©e Stewart) in 1982. Clayton made the news in August 1989 when he was arrested in Dublin for carrying a small amount of marijuana. However, he avoided conviction by making a large donation to charity, and later commented: \\"it was my own fault. And I'm sure I was out of my head ‚Äì emotionally apart from anything else. But it is serious because it is illegal.\\" Clayton has also had alcohol problems, which came to a head during the Zoo TV Tour. On 26 November 1993 he was so hung over that he was unable to play that night's show in Sydney, the dress rehearsal for their Zoo TV concert film. Bass duties had to be fulfilled by Clayton's technician Stuart Morgan. After that incident, he resolved to give up alcohol, eventually beginning his sobriety in 1996. On 26 June 2017, Clayton received the Stevie Ray Vaughan Award at the MusiCares 13th annual MAP Fund Benefit Concert in recognition of his commitment to helping others with addiction recovery. Clayton remained a bachelor for several decades until his marriage in 2013. During the early 1990s, he dated English supermodel Naomi Campbell. He also had a long-standing relationship with Suzanne \\"Susie\\" Smith, a former assistant to Paul McGuinness; they were engaged in 2006, but the pair broke up in February 2007. In 2010, Clayton fathered a son with his then-partner, an unnamed French woman. In 2013, he confirmed that he was no longer in that relationship. On 4 September 2013, Clayton married former human rights lawyer Mariana Teixeira de Carvalho in a ceremony in Dublin. Originally from Brazil, de Carvalho now works as a director at Michael Werner, a leading contemporary art gallery in London and New York. In 2009, the High Court ordered the assets of Carol Hawkins, Clayton's former housekeeper and personal assistant, be frozen after it was reported that she misappropriated funds of ‚Ç¨1.8 million. At the subsequent trial that figure was stated to be ‚Ç¨2.8 million. Hawkins denied the charges but in 2012 was convicted by a jury of 181 counts of theft and sentenced to 7 years imprisonment. On 25 July 2017, Clayton and his wife announced the arrival of their daughter, Alba. They declined to divulge where and when she was born. Charity work In 2011, Clayton became an ambassador for the Dublin-based St Patrick's Hospital's Mental Health Service \\"Walk in My Shoes\\" facility. Awards and recognition Clayton and U2 have won numerous awards in their career, including 22 Grammy awards, including those for Best Rock Duo or Group seven times, Album of the Year twice, Record of the Year twice, Song of the Year twice, and Best Rock Album twice. In March 2005, Clayton was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of U2, in their first year of eligibility.

He studied astronomy at Princeton University, obtaining his B.A. In 1897 and his doctorate in 1899, studying under Charles Augustus Young. From 1903 to 1905, he worked at the Cambridge Observatory with Arthur Robert Hinks as a research assistant of the Carnegie Institution and came under the strong influence of George Darwin. He returned to Princeton to become an instructor in astronomy (1905‚Äì1908), assistant professor (1908‚Äì1911), professor (1911‚Äì1927) and research professor (1927‚Äì1947). He was also the director of the Princeton University Observatory from 1912 to 1947 where Charlotte Moore Sitterly helped him measure and calculate the properties of stars. He died in Princeton, New Jersey on 18 February 1957 at the age of 79. He is buried in Princeton Cemetery.https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/8056675/henry-norris- russell Family In November 1908 Russell married Lucy May Cole (1881-1968). They had four children. Their youngest daughter, Margaret Russell (1914-1999), married the astronomer Frank K. Edmondson in the 1930s. Published work Russell co-wrote an influential two-volume textbook in 1927 with Raymond Smith Dugan and John Quincy Stewart: Astronomy: A Revision of Young‚Äôs Manual of Astronomy (Ginn & Co., Boston, 1926‚Äì27, 1938, 1945). This became the standard astronomy textbook for about two decades. There were two volumes: the first was The Solar System and the second was Astrophysics and Stellar Astronomy. The textbook popularized the idea that a star's properties (radius, surface temperature, luminosity, etc.) were largely determined by the star's mass and chemical composition, which became known as the Vogt-Russell theorem (including Heinrich Vogt who independently discovered the result). Since a star's chemical composition gradually changes with age (usually in a non- homogeneous fashion), stellar evolution results. Russell dissuaded Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin from concluding that the composition of the Sun is different from that of the Earth in her thesis, as it contradicted the accepted wisdom at the time. He realized she was correct four years later after deriving the same result by different means. In his paper Russell credited Payne with discovering that the Sun had a different chemical composition from Earth.

Mullen's distinctive, almost military drumming style developed from his playing martial beats in childhood marching bands. Some of his most notable contributions to the U2 catalogue include \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\", \\"Pride (In the Name of Love)\\", \\"Where the Streets Have No Name\\", \\"Zoo Station,\\" \\"Mysterious Ways\\", and \\"City of Blinding Lights\\". Mullen was born and raised in Dublin, and attended Mount Temple Comprehensive School, where he co-founded U2 in 1976 after posting a message on the school's notice board. A member of the band since its inception, he has recorded 14 studio albums with U2. Mullen has worked on numerous side projects during his career. In 1990, he produced the Ireland national football team's song \\"Put 'Em Under Pressure\\" for the 1990 FIFA World Cup. In 1996, he worked with U2 bandmate Adam Clayton on a dance re-recording of the \\"Theme from Mission: Impossible\\". Mullen has sporadically acted in films, most notably in Man on the Train (2011) and A Thousand Times Good Night (2013). As a member of the band, he has been involved in philanthropic causes throughout his career, including Amnesty International. As a member of U2, Mullen has received 22 Grammy Awards and has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2016, Rolling Stone ranked Mullen the 96th-greatest drummer of all time. Early life Lawrence Joseph Mullen Jr., the middle child and only son of Lawrence Joseph Mullen Sr. and Maureen (n√©e Boyd) Mullen, was born on 31 October 1961 in Artane, Dublin, Ireland, and lived there, on Rosemount Avenue, until his twenties. His father was a civil servant and his mother a homemaker. He has an elder sister, Cecilia, and had a younger sister, Mary, who died in 1973.McCormick (2006), pp. 25‚Äì27 He attended the School of Music in Chatham Row to learn piano at the age of eight and then began drumming in 1971 at the age of 9, under the instruction of Irish drummer Joe Bonnie. After Bonnie's death, his daughter Monica took over for him, but Mullen gave up the lessons and started playing by himself. His mother died in a car accident in 1976. Before founding U2, Mullen joined a Dublin marching band called the Artane Boys Band at the suggestion of his father. Mullen said that the band focused more on learning to read sheet music, whereas he wanted to spend more time playing the drums. He was asked by the band to cut his shoulder-length hair, and despite acquiescing and cutting a few inches off, he was asked to shorten it further. Mullen refused and quit the band after just three weeks. Mullen used the money he had saved and with his father's help bought a drum kit, made by a Japanese toy company, which his sister Cecilia's friend was selling. He set up the kit in his bedroom and his parents allotted him certain times to practice. His father then got him into the Post Office Workers Band, which played orchestral melodies with percussion, along with marching band standards. Mullen spent approximately two years in the Post Office Workers Band, overlapping with his time in U2. He attended Scoil Colmcille, Marlborough Street, Dublin. He took the exams for Chanel College and St. Paul's, two Catholic schools his father wanted his son to attend. After the accidental death of Larry's younger sister in 1973, his father gave up the idea of pushing his son into those schools and sent Larry to Mount Temple Comprehensive School, the first interdenominational school in Ireland. Musical career =U2= Mullen (right) performing with U2 in 2009 Mullen's father suggested that he place a notice on the Mount Temple bulletin board, saying something to the effect of \\"drummer seeks musicians to form band.\\" U2 was founded on 25 September 1976 in Mullen's kitchen in Artane. Attending the first meeting were Mullen, Paul \\"Bono\\" Hewson, David \\"The Edge\\" Evans and his brother Dik, Adam Clayton, and Mullen's friends Ivan McCormick and Peter Martin. Mullen later described it as \\"'The Larry Mullen Band' for about ten minutes, then Bono walked in and blew any chance I had of being in charge.\\"McCormick (2006), pp. 30, 34 McCormick and Martin soon left, and the group settled on the name \\"Feedback\\" because it was one of the few technical terms they knew. The band later changed their name to \\"The Hype\\", and again to \\"U2\\" for a 1978 talent contest in Limerick, Ireland, that they entered and won as a four-piece. Days after the competition, the band's reduction to a four- piece lineup became permanent after they parted ways with Dik. Mullen left school in 1978, having taken his Intermediate Certificate exams. The school offered him the chance to complete his Leaving Certificate exams. He and his sister Cecilia worked for an American company in Dublin, involved in oil exploration off the coast of Ireland. Mullen worked there for a year in the purchasing department, with the prospect of becoming a computer programmer in their geology section. During the recording of the album Pop in 1996, Mullen suffered from severe back problems. Recording was delayed due to surgery.McCormick (2006), p. 262 When he left the hospital, he arrived back in the studio to find the rest of the band experimenting more than ever with electronic drum machines, something driven largely by the Edge's interest in dance and hip-hop music, and, given his weakness after the operation, he relented, allowing The Edge to continue using drum machines, which contributed heavily to the album's electronic feel. =Other projects= Mullen in 2006 Mullen has worked on many musical projects outside of U2 in his career, including collaborations with Maria McKee. Mullen contributed to U2 producer Daniel Lanois's 1989 album Acadie. In 1990, Mullen co-wrote and arranged an official Irish national football team song \\"Put 'Em Under Pressure\\" for the FIFA World Cup.McGee (2008), p. 131 He and Clayton collaborated with Mike Mills and Michael Stipe from R.E.M. to form the one-performance group Automatic Baby, solely for the purpose of performing \\"One\\" for MTV's 1993 inauguration ball for US President Bill Clinton; the group's name refers to the titles of both latest bands' albums at the time, Achtung Baby and Automatic for the People. For Nanci Griffith's 1994 album Flyer, he and Clayton performed in the rhythm section on several songs, while Mullen also mixed three songs. Mullen played drums on many of the songs on Emmylou Harris' 1995 album Wrecking Ball.Discumentary: Emmylou Harris \\"Wrecking Ball\\" - WYEP Mullen and Clayton contributed to the soundtrack to the 1996 movie Mission: Impossible, which included recording the theme song, whose time signature was changed from the original time signature to an easier and more danceable time signature. The \\"Theme from Mission: Impossible\\" reached number 8 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance (Orchestra, Group or Soloist) in 1997. Mullen performed on Underworld's song \\"Boy, Boy, Boy\\" from their 2007 album, Oblivion with Bells. Ten years later he appeared on Alice Cooper's 2017 album Paranormal. Musical style and techniques Mullen performing in Melbourne on the Joshua Tree Tour 2019 Mullen's drumming style is influenced by his experience in marching bands during his adolescence, which helped contribute to the militaristic beats of songs such as \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\".McCormick (2006), pp. 130, 135 Author Bill Flanagan said that he plays \\"with a martial rigidity but uses his kit in a way a properly trained drummer would not\\"; he tends to transition from the snare drum onto tom-toms positioned on either side of him, contrasting with how they are traditionally used.Flanagan (1996), pp. 208‚Äì209 Mullen occasionally rides a tom-tom the way other drummers would play a cymbal, or rides the hi-hat how others would play a snare. He admitted his bass drum technique is not a strength, as he mostly played the snare in marching bands and did not learn to properly combine the separate elements together on a full kit. As a result, he uses a floor tom to his left to create the effect of a bass drum, an arrangement he began to use while recording \\"Pride (In the Name of Love)\\" in 1984 at the influence of producer Daniel Lanois. He said, \\"I couldn't do what most people would consider a normal beat for the song, so I chose alternatives.\\" Flanagan said that his playing style perfectly reflects his personality: \\"Larry is right on top of the beat, a bit ahead‚Äîas you'd expect from a man who's so ordered and punctual in his life. Mullen was heavily influenced by glam rock acts of the 1970s when first learning to play drums. In the early days of U2, he had what Bono called a \\"florid\\" drumming style, before he eventually adopted a philosophy of simplicity and pared down his rhythms. His drumming leaves open space, owing to what Modern Drummer described as his understanding of \\"when to hit and when not to hit\\". As he matured as a timekeeper, he developed a preternatural sense of rhythm; Eno recounted one occasion when Mullen noticed that his click track had been set incorrectly by just six milliseconds. Under the tutelage of Lanois, Mullen learned more about his musical role as the drummer in filling out the band's sound, while producer Flood helped Mullen learn to play along with electronic elements such as drum machines and samples. His kit has a tambourine mounted on a cymbal stand, which he uses as an accent on certain beats for songs such as \\"With or Without You\\". Mullen has had tendinitis problems throughout his career. As a means to reduce inflammation and pain, he began to use specially designed Pro-Mark drumsticks. He uses Yamaha drums and Paiste cymbals. Although he occasionally plays keyboards and synthesiser in concerts, Mullen rarely sings during performances. He contributed backing vocals to the songs \\"Numb\\", \\"Get On Your Boots\\", \\"Moment of Surrender\\", \\"Elevation\\", \\"Miracle Drug\\", \\"Love and Peace or Else\\", \\"Unknown Caller\\", \\"Zoo Station\\" and \\"Daddy's Gonna Pay for Your Crashed Car\\" (only during Zoo TV Tour), and others. He occasionally performed a cover version of \\"Dirty Old Town\\" on the Zoo TV Tour.Let Larry Sing!, ZooStation During live performances of \\"I'll Go Crazy If I Don't Go Crazy Tonight\\" on the U2 360¬∞ Tour, Mullen walked around the stage, playing a large djembe strapped around his waist. Acting career Mullen's film debut was in a film by Phil Joanou called Entropy where he played himself alongside bandmate Bono. He played a thief in Man on the Train, which starred Donald Sutherland. Filmed in Orangeville, Ontario, Canada, Man on the Train was released in 2011. The following year, it was announced that Mullen would appear in his second film, A Thousand Times Goodnight, starring Juliette Binoche. On 3 September 2013 the film won Special Grand Prix of the Jury at Montreal World Film Festival. In July 2020, Mullen was invited to join the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences. Personal life Mullen met his partner, Ann Acheson, in their first year at Mount Temple Comprehensive School. The two have been together for over 40 years and they have three children. He is a first cousin of Irish actor Conor Mullen. As U2 became increasingly successful, Larry Mullen had to add the suffix \\"Junior\\" to his surname to avoid confusion with his father, who was receiving large tax bills meant for his son. In 1995, Mullen had surgery on his back because he had been carrying an injury since The Joshua Tree tour. He and Clayton own houses near Bono and The Edge in Southern France to make it easier to record with U2 in the south of France. He prefers to let the other band members take the spotlight at interviews. He has played synthesiser or keyboards on several songs, including \\"United Colours\\" from Passengers' 1995 album Original Soundtracks 1, an album that Mullen has always disliked. In the 1980s, The Prunes gave him the nickname of \\"The Jam Jar'\\".

The population was 255 at the 2010 census. History Originally a siding on the Union Pacific Railroad, Dix was founded as a settlement in 1886. The community derives its name from Dixon, Illinois, the former home of an early settler. However, it was deemed necessary to shorten the name to \\"Dix\\", in order to avoid repetition with Dixon. State highway 30 runs through Dix, and in 1995 was changed from \\"Main\\" street to \\"Miller\\" street (within the city limits of Dix). This was done in honor of Fred H. Miller, who worked for the Union Pacific for 30 years and ran the town's train depot. The train depot was dismantled after Fred's retirement. Fred also served on the town board, and lived two blocks away from the depot next to the city park with his wife Ada B. Miller.

Climate Kimball, like much of western Nebraska, has a climate on the border between humid continental (K√∂ppen Dfa/Dfb/Dwa/Dwb) and cool semi- arid (BSk). The climate is characterised by cold and extremely variable winters that can range from quite warm days due to chinook winds to bitter cold under the influence of Arctic air from Canada. Spring is also variable, but heats up gradually, and features frequent thunderstorms that make this the wettest time of year, whilst summer is very warm to hot and can range from extremes of heat and drought to cooler weather with heavy rainfall. The fall season is drier than the spring and gradually cools down, although warm spells due to the chinook are always possible.  Economy  The Kimball Wind Farm was upgraded from 10.5 to 30MW in 2018.

There, a fort was built to protect the early settlers from Indian attacks. The settlement took its name from the Niobrara River. They built a log garrison of cottonwood, which later became known as \\"Old Cabin\\". The company, founded by Shelly and others, was called L'eau Qui Court Company. This Company failed, and the Niobrara Township Company was organized. The new town was eventually called \\"Niobrara\\", an Omaha word for \\"running water\\". On June 29, 1857, a steam sawmill was brought to Niobrara from St. Louis by the steamer \\"Omaha\\" and was immediately put into operation sawing lumber for the building of the new town. In spite of early hardships, the new town continued to grow, and the 1881 population was reported to be about 500. Just as the Missouri River was responsible for the original settlement of Niobrara, it was also responsible for the first move. In March 1881, the spring thaw produced one of the largest Missouri River floods on record. After the danger of flooding, Mother Nature and the mighty Missouri again invaded Niobrara in April 1952, and much of the town and the surrounding area was flooded. This record flow came shortly before the completion of the Missouri River dams, citizens were relieved that flooding along the Missouri would be a thing of the past and life could continue at a more or less routine pace. A big event of the 1950s was the Centennial Celebration of June 16‚Äì17, 1956. There were many events leading up to the two day celebration which was attended by an estimated 20,000 people. Later, in the 1950s and in the 1960s, it became apparent that the mighty Missouri would, again, influence Niobrara history. Silt from the Niobrara River, which began to accumulate in the river bed, raised the ground water level in Niobrara and the surrounding area. Many basements became flooded, requiring constant pumping and it was apparent that the problem would continue to intensify. By 1969, community officials began to look for solutions. The US Army Corps of having seemingly passed, on March 28, 1881, an ice gorge broke and Niobrara residents were greeted by a surge of muddy water. The water continued to overflow until most of the town was covered, forcing people and animals alike to seek the safety of higher ground. Fortunately, no lives were lost but this disastrous flood influenced the citizens of Niobrara to pick up and move to a new town site west and south of the old site. The town grew and flourished at the new location providing most of the goods and services required by a rural Nebraska community of that era. Noteworthy events of the era included the first school house in 1886, the first waterworks system which was supplied by an artesian well completed in 1892, the construction of an electric light plant in 1899 and the coming of the railroad in 1902. 1902 also marked the moving of the county seat from Niobrara to a new central location in the newly formed town of Center.Through most of Niobrara's history, ferry boats have provided an important transportation link with South Dakota. The first ferry boat began operation in about 1860 and was operated by horses walking on a treadmill.1910 marked the grand opening of the Niobrara Island Park. The land on which the park was built was given to the village for a park in 1881 by the U.S. Department of the Interior. The village operated the park until approximately 1930 when it was given to the State of Nebraska and was added to the Nebraska Park System. Engineers became involved and eventually suggested three solutions. These included abandonment of the town, an elaborate dike and pumping system, or relocation to a new site. Niobrara citizens accepted the challenge of, once again, moving Niobrara and the site selection process followed. Funds were appropriated by Congress to pay a sizable portion of the cost of the move. Site preparation began in September 1973 and was completed in April 1974. Next came the water, sewer, storm sewer, paving, water wells and water storage tank. The sale of residential lots followed in the summer of 1974 and residential construction moved forward at a fast pace. By the end of 1977, the move was nearly completed. The 1980 census showed 420 and 213 homes in Niobrara. 1981 marked the 112th anniversary of the original settlement and was celebrated with a historical pageant, parade and other activities. Through volunteer efforts, a nine-hole grass greens golf course was completed on the old town site. The Niobrara State Park was relocated, suffering the same fate as the old town. Niobrara's history can best be summarized as being destined by the mighty Missouri on whose banks it was founded and from whose reach it has continuously tried to escape. Geography Niobrara is located at (42.750000, -98.031989).

By the early 1900s, the village had become a prosperous commercial and social center for the area. At this time, the nearby town of Lincoln was still relatively small and remote. Beginning with the Great Depression, Bennet's population declined, local businesses closed, and many moved to cities for work. Today, Bennet has a similar status as many former business centers in Lancaster County as Lincoln has become the political, financial, commercial, and cultural center of the county. However, Bennet has experienced a recent population growth as more and more people have begun living in Bennet despite working in Lincoln. According to a community-wide survey conducted in 1992, 76% of Bennet's residents commute to work in Lincoln. A recent survey indicated that 44% of people who moved to Bennet did so because of the small town atmosphere, citing a lower cost of living, cleaner air, and a good school system.

Schools Norris School District 160 is located approximately two miles north and one mile west of Firth. Norris is made up of an elementary school, intermediate school, middle school, and a high school, all of which are in separate buildings but on the same campus. Norris provides Pre-K-12 education for students from Hickman, Holland, Firth, Cortland, Roca, Princeton, Panama, and parts of southern Lincoln. Norris School was named after a United States senator from Nebraska, George William Norris. History A courthouse square was planned in the area that would become Firth sometime before 1860. However, due to Firth's remote location, residents would have had to travel to Nebraska City for supplies, meaning that the area remained largely uninhabited by non-Natives for many years. Firth was settled in the early 1870s, as the Atchison & Nebraska Railroad was extended toward Lincoln. The post office was established in 1872, named for Superintendent Frank Firth of the Atchison & Nebraska Railroad, and was incorporated in 1879.\\"Lancaster County, Part 29: Firth.\\" Andreas's History of the State of Nebraska. Retrieved 2012-11-29.\\"FirthLancaster County\\". Nebraska... Our Towns. Retrieved 2012-11-29. Once the railroad was completed, Firth became an important hub of business on the Atchison & Nebraska line, shipping 700 carloads of grain and livestock daily. In 1916, a brick school was built to replace the two-story schoolhouse which had previously served the village. In 1964, Firth became one of several schools to consolidate and form the Norris School District. The brick school building was torn down in 1971 after years of vacancy. Fundraising in the area allowed for the Lakeview Rest Home to be built in the 1970s on land donated by Henry and Bertha TeKolste. Notable person Orah Dee Clark, the first superintendent of Alaska schools, was born in Firth.

History In 1879, the Panama Cemetery Association was formed and raised funds to dig a well. Panama was originally founded one mile south of its present location but was moved in order to be closer to the railway. In 1888, the village was officially founded on land that was previously owned by Moses J. Mitton, John Forrest, and Gilbert F. Steeves. According to local folk history, the village's original by-laws contained a clause inserted by a descendant of Gilbert F. Steeves, Caroline \\"Carrie\\" Steeves, which stated that if the village allowed any business to sell alcohol in the village, the Steeves family would reclaim the land they had deeded to the village. Panama was incorporated as a village in 1904. New by-laws and ordinances were enacted when the village was incorporated and again in 1977, but it is still illegal to sell alcohol in the village. The village was likely named after the Isthmus of Panama, which had gained notoriety at the time due to the United States' involvement in building the Panama Canal.

A population grew in the area, generally centered around Raymond's present location, but there was no official settlement or name of the area. In 1878, a post office was established nearby and named \\"Orlando.\\" Raymond was platted in 1880 when the railroad was extended to that point and was named for I. M. Raymond, a railroad official. A 1925 edition is available for download at University of Nebraska‚ÄîLincoln Digital Commons. In 1892, Raymond became incorporated as a village and one year later a two-room school was built. Following consolidation with several neighboring school districts, a new high school was built near Agnew, Nebraska, but elementary school students still attend school in Raymond. The twentieth century created challenges for Raymond. As automobiles became the way to travel cross-country in the United States, Raymond was left disconnected as Highway 79 passed one half mile west of the town rather than through it. World War II saw the building of the Lincoln Air Base and increasing numbers of factory jobs elsewhere, leaving Raymond behind. However, Raymond experienced a period of growth following the construction of Branched Oak Dam in 1970. The dam provided flood relief for the village, but also created a large reservoir surrounded by the largest recreational area in eastern Nebraska.

History The population of Roca in 1890 was 190, the highest it has been before the present day. The post office was established September 22, 1894. When the town was platted in 1876, the citizens wished to choose a name, which would suggest the chief industry in the area, stone quarrying. Roca is the Spanish word for stone. A 1925 edition is available for download at University of Nebraska‚ÄîLincoln Digital Commons. In 1857 John and Margaret Prey, adult sons, John W., Thomas, and William, and teenage children, David and Rebecca, came from Wisconsin to preempt land near the proposed town called \\"Olathe.\\" There were high hopes for the future of the area, which was designated as \\"Clay County.\\" However, not many people ventured this far onto the prairie. While there were no major confrontations with Indians, there were several scares, which caused some settlers to leave and not return. Indians took Rebecca Prey, but they released her when her father and brothers appeared. In 1861 Delos and Frances Mills settled one-half mile west of Salt Creek. They built a small stone house, using limestone from a ledge that protruded from the ground. This was the beginning of the quarries that became a primary business. The following year Mills' mother, Orra Boydston, and her sister, Esther Warner arrived. Both widows, they filed on adjoining homesteads near Mills' cabin. There was a \\"political altercation\\" in 1863, at which time Clay County was dissolved and the land divided between Gage and Lancaster counties. The Prey family and John Haskins were the only original settlers who remained at this location. In 1864 Elmore Keys arrived and bought Prey's cabin for $20. He moved it, log by log, to a site on the east side of the creek and later added a small stone lean-to. In 1867 a committee was commissioned to find a location for the state's capital city. A site near the rock quarries on the Mills farm was suggested because of the availability of good building materials. However, the town of Lancaster was chosen instead. When work was started on the statehouse in 1868, rock from the quarry was said to be \\"unsatisfactory for building.\\" The quarry men built a school in 1869 near the Warner farm. When the Atchinson & Nebraska Railroad built its line to Lincoln in 1871, it came right through the area. The siding and station established at that time needed a name. Haskel Warner, who had worked with a survey crew in the New Mexico Territory, suggested \\"Roca,\\" which is Spanish for rock. Elmore Keys and John Meyer donated the land, and a town site was platted. The big stone house that Keys built on top of the hill east of the town at that time is still a fine home today. The town immediately started to grow, and 1876 incorporated it. Keys & Bullock opened a new quarry on the south side of Roca in 1875, and later called it the Blue Stone quarry. Rock from these quarries was used in the construction of many buildings in Lincoln, out-state, and beyond. There was active quarrying in the area for over 100 years, both by the county and by private owners. In 1879 the number of students had grown so that another schoolhouse was needed. That one also was quickly outgrown, so a larger wooden building was erected. By 1882 there were 280 students and businesses included a motel, a mill, a hardware store, a lumberyard, and a few other shops. Main Street faced Salt Creek on the West Side of town, with the Railroad depot across the street. Fires destroyed several businesses in 1891, the mill in about 1900, and the hotel in 1910. By then the quarries were not as productive. Businesses, once displaced, did not rebuild. In 1933 a large brick schoolhouse was built, which served the community until 1964 when a Consolidation effort formed the Norris School District with a building south of Hickman. A Methodist church formed in 1876 was built by quarry men, and enlarged in 1925. That evidence burned in an early morning fire in 1969. A new church was built which was a small but active congregation. A small Lutheran church located near the school was active until 1916 when it disbanded. The original cemetery was one mile north of town on a sand hill. In 1876 the present cemetery was established on land donated by the Keys family, an enlargement of their family burial grounds. The \\"old stone store\\" was built from quarry rock as a blacksmith shop in 1879. It has been a lodge, community hall, and a grocery store, with an apartment upstairs.

This included a blacksmith (Alfred Leister), two merchants (Joseph Strickler and Martin Mickelsen), a lumberman (Weston Hill), a liveryman (Horace Stone), a doctor (William Eves), a postmaster (John Pricket), a minister (William Evans), and two railroad foremen. There were about 64 farm families (including laborers working for others) in the surrounding Nichols Precinct. Most families were of American origin, although there were five German families, and one or two each of Swedish, French, Scottish, Dutch, Bohemian and Canadian background.1900 United States Census, Nichol's Precinct, Lincoln County, Nebraska, E.D. 152, pp. 1-10. The village was incorporated in April 1909. = From 1900 to 1920 = Between 1900 and 1920, Hershey grew rapidly and added the structural foundation, commercial attractions, and social amenities of an important economic center for the surrounding area. A local newspaper, the Hershey Times, began publication in 1911. In 1913, a bond issue was approved providing for public water and electric lights. A telephone exchange was introduced in 1914. Businesses in Hershey in 1920, in addition to those present in 1900, included two mills (one of which, an alfalfa mill, burned in March 1920), two elevators, a hotel, two banks, three agricultural implement dealers, a cement works, an automobile dealer, a garage, a tire store, a meat market, a drug store, a restaurant, a number of dealers in agricultural products, including stock and hay, a barber, and an Opera House. There were three churches, the Methodist, Presbyterian (54 members), and Lutheran (40 members), and a number of fraternal organizations, including the Odd Fellows (63 members), Yeomanry (39 members), Modern Woodmen of the World, Royal Neighbors and Mystic Legion. = Agricultural Context = Hershey is located between the North and South Platte rivers in the midst of good agricultural land, much of it irrigated. From an early date, agricultural production emphasized stock raising, alfalfa, and sugar beets. The sugar beet industry was encouraged by a tariff on sugar enacted in 1897. In 1905, there were 721 acres in Nicols Precinct planted to sugar beets. Shipments from Hershey in 1919 included 904 rail carloads of hay and 279 carloads of sugar beets. While the sugar content of the beets raised near Hershey was high, the volume was long insufficient to support a processing plant.Ira L. Bare & Will H. McDonald, An Illustrated History of Lincoln County, Nebraska and Her People (American Historical Society, 1920), pp. 86-87, 284. = Additional Immigrant Groups = Both the railroad and the sugar beet industries were labor intensive, attracting additional immigrant groups to supply that labor. These groups included Russian Germans (ethnic Germans from Russia), Japanese and Mexicans. In 1900, there were three Russian families in the Hershey area (Henry Haff, George Amen, and Conrad Amen), two of whom had become farmers in their own right.1900 U.S. Census, Nichols Precinct, Lincoln County, Nebraska, E.D. 152, sh. 3. By 1910, there had been a substantial influx of Swedish settlers, most engaged in farming. There were also two households of Japanese men in Nichols Precinct, without wives, one consisting of seven men working for the railroad and one of four men engaged in farming.1910 U.S. Census, Nichols Precinct, Lincoln County, Nebraska, E.D. 179, sh. 8A & 8B. By 1920, there were eight Japanese families in Hershey itself, all engaged in farming.1920 U.S. Census, Hershey, Lincoln County, Nebraska, E.D. 192. The Mexican community repeated the pattern: in 1920, there were three Mexican households in Hershey, including young men working for the railroad. By the late 1920s, there were 19 Mexican families in Hershey. Both the Japanese and Mexican families were important parts of the community thereafter.

History =Settlement and early history= In late 1865 three scouts were sent from a German Lutheran settlement near Ixonia, Wisconsin, to find productive, inexpensive farmland that could be claimed under the Homestead Act. From the Omaha area they followed the Elkhorn River upstream to West Point. Finding that area too crowded, they continued up the river. On September 15, they reached the junction of the Elkhorn and its North Fork, and chose that area as a settlement site.Pangle, Mary Ellen. A History of Norfolk. Published serially in Norfolk Daily News. 1929. On May 23, 1866, a party of 124 settlers representing 42 families from the Ixonia area set out for northeast Nebraska in three wagon trains. They arrived at the new site on July 15. A second group of settlers from Wisconsin arrived in July 1867. These collective wagon parties established the first Lutheran church in Madison County, St. Paul's Lutheran, which is still operating today. The original name of the colony was a variant of \\"North Fork\\", but accounts differ on the exact name: \\"Northfork\\", \\"Nor'fork\\", and \\"Nordfork\\"Perkey, Elton.

It is part of the Grand Island, Nebraska Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 2,934 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Merrick County. History =Early inhabitants= The inhabitants just prior to the establishment of Lone Tree (Central City) were the Pawnee. In the late 1700s, the Chaui had a village on the current location of Central City. An account that an old Chaui man gave to Major Frank North in 1875 about a battle that took place between two divisions of the Pawnee (the Chaui, Pitahauerit, and Kitkehahki, jointly known as the Southern Pawnee, on one side; and the Skidi on the other) in the late 1700s illustrates the political complexities of the early inhabitants of what would come to be Central City. There had been considerable rivalry between the Chaui and the Skidi, which eventually led to an unprovoked attack by the Skidi on a group of Chaui hunting buffalo. It was estimated that 200 Chaui were killed. All were men from the Chaui village, which was near Lone Tree and where Central City is now located. The surviving Chaui returned to their village (this was thought to have occurred during winter). The Chaui did not believe they were strong enough to attack the Skidi, so they held councils with two other Southern Pawnee bands and told them what happened. The Pitahauerit and Kitkehahki decided to help the Chaui against the Skidi. The men of the three villages crossed the Platte River and made a night march to the Skidi village. Some of the men dressed as buffaloes in order to entice the Skidi out of their village to hunt buffalo. The rest of the men hid along the river and behind the ridge of sandhills next to the river. The Skidi charged between the men hiding along the river and behind the sandhill ridge thinking that they were chasing buffalo; the Southern Pawnees attacked them there. All of the Skidi men who had not gone out to hunt the buffaloes came out of the village and joined buffalo hunters who had initially escaped, preparing to make a last stand. Grinnell's Chaui informant estimated that more than 400 Skidi men were killed. The Chaui and the Pitahauerat wanted to exterminate the Skidi, but the Kitkehaki disagreed, arguing that the Skidi were the same people as they and should not be eradicated. The three bands argued for some time, but the Kitkehaki won the argument. They told the Skidi that they wanted to talk and Skidi subsequently agreed to their terms. The Southern Pawnees took much of the Skidi property, including many horses. Many of the Skidi women were forced to marry into the other villages to establish family ties among villages of Pawnee. =Founding of Lone Tree= The first pioneers passed by what would eventually become Central City on the Mormon Trail in 1847 and later on the Oregon Trail and the California Trail. This location was close to a huge cottonwood tree, called Lone Tree, that the pioneers used on these trails as a landmark. In 1858, the Nebraska Territorial Legislature establish Merrick county named after Elvira Merrick, the wife of a Dodge County Nebraska Territorial legislator who introduced the bill creating Merrick County. A yet to be established county seat was called \\"Elvira\\" and was said to be located under Lone Tree. It was not until 1866 that an actual county seat was created near the mythical location of Elvira and renamed \\"Lone Tree.\\" It was established as the Union Pacific Railroad was laying tracks through Merrick County. In 1868, J.H.Berryman built the first substantial building, which functioned as a general store, hotel, bar, court house, revival meeting hall, and his home. The first courthouse was built in 1871 and was replaced by the current court house in 1912. Nebraska Christian High school main building, formerly Nebraska Central College main building =Name change= In 1875 a petition was presented to the Merrick County Court requesting a name change for Lone Tree to \\"Central City\\". Proponents of change argued that the name \\"Lone Tree\\", gave the impression that the area was desolate and the inhabitants were poor and uncivilized, which would not bring in new settlers and thereby limit the growth of the area. Opponents to change countered that \\"Lone Tree\\" portrayed a \\"beautiful spot and is a name dear to the pioneers.\\" The proponents of change won out and on July 1, 1875, the name was officially changed from \\"Lone Tree\\" to \\"Central City.\\" Central City was meant to designate the city's key location within the state's agricultural belt. A 1925 edition is available for download at University of Nebraska‚ÄîLincoln Digital Commons. =Boom town= By the 1880s, Central City was a \\"boom\\" town after the arrival of a second railroad, the Burlington & Missouri River. During this time of peak growth, three banks were built, in addition to a hardware store, a roller mill, two newspapers, three lumberyards, a cracker factory, a cigar factory, a new brick school, nine churches, and a college. The college was Nebraska Central College, which opened in 1885 as a Methodist college and the first high school were built. The first newspaper in Central City was The Merrick County News, which published its first addition on March 21, 1872. A second news paper, the Sentinel, a \\"railroad\\" paper, started on April 10, 1873, but only lasted a short time. In 1874, The Merrick County News became the Courier. In 1880, the Merrick County Item was first published, but only lasted until 1881. In 1882, the Nonpareil opened and Central City again had two newspapers. By the 1890s, economic growth had slowed. In 1890, the Courier closed and Nebraska Central College closed in 1891. A flood washed out both the Union Pacific and Burlington railroad tracks. By the mid-1890s, economic conditions were improving. Two new newspapers opened: the Record in 1895 (which would close in 1908) and Republican in 1896 (which would merge with the Nonpareil to form the current Republican-Nonpareil in 1953). The Society of Friends (Quakers) reopened Nebraska Central College in 1899. The early 1900s saw the construction of a new courthouse (1911‚Äì1913), the historic Martha Ellen Auditorium (1916, earlier an opera house), and a new high school. Economic growth was aided in the 1920s by the opening of a branch of Omaha Cold Storage in 1927, allowing farmers to sell their poultry and eggs locally at better prices. Perhaps the most notable citizen of Central City, Wright Morris, lived here from 1910 to 1919. =1930s to the present= A library was built just before the Great Depression, but little construction took place during the 1930s. In the 1940s, construction resumed when a hospital was built and a gymnasium was added for the high school. In the 1950s, Nebraska Central College closed (1953), but a new hospital was built in 1959. In 1975, an explosion and fire destroyed an entire city block, but Central City still reached its largest population to date at 3,083 people in 1980. Central City's population has declined slightly since then.

The population was 132 at the 2010 census.  History  Established in 1854 and incorporated in 1856, Brownville was the largest town in the Nebraska Territory, with a population of 1,309 by 1880. Bordering slave-holding Missouri, the town became an important port on the Missouri River. Daniel Freeman, the first homesteader to file a claim under the Homestead Act of 1862, staked his claim at a New Year's Eve party in Brownville. The rise of the railroad was ultimately Brownville's undoing. The railroads siphoned traffic away from the Missouri River's steamboats. Brownville's attempt to secure a railroad of its own was severely botched and led to immense tax increases to pay the bonds for the failed venture. This drove most of the population away and led to the county seat being transferred to Auburn in 1885.Brownville¬í's 150th Anniversary 1854 - 2004: The Village of Firsts Remains on the Frontier Edge .

After the Civil War David Mercer established a law practice in the town. Mercer later served as a long- time U.S. Representative from Nebraska.

The Brownville Bridge was built over the Missouri River in 1939. Today it is on the National Register of Historic Places. Owing to its place in Nebraska history, Brownville is primarily a tourist attraction with several old houses opened for tours or converted into museums. Art galleries and wineries in and near Brownville have also helped to make the town an increasingly attractive getaway for residents of the region's larger cities. Omaha's River City Star was built in the town in 1967, and was originally named the Belle of Brownville. The Governor Furnas Arboretum was planted in the city in 1992.

It was named for Julian Bahuaud, an early settler from France. The first name was chosen as no one seemed to be able to pronounce his last name. In June 1899, Julian Bahuaud was murdered for his money. He lived alone about 1/2 miles south of Julian. The murder went unsolved for 14 years. In 1913 one of three men who were under suspicion had a heatstroke in Kansas. He thought he was going to die so he confessed to his part in the murder. He recovered, was brought back to Auburn where he was tried and convicted. The murderer spent the rest of his life in the Nebraska State Penitentiary.

The population was 865 at the 2010 census. Peru State College is located in Peru. History The first attempt to settle the community took place in 1853, by some residents of Peru, Illinois. However, troops from Fort Kearney forced them to leave because Nebraska Territory belonged to the Otoe tribe. The settlers then temporarily settled across the Missouri River at Sonora (now Watson, Missouri). In 1857, a community formed around a trading post called Mount Vernon on the bluffs above the river on the Nebraska side.http://www.casde.unl.edu/history/counties/nemaha/peru/ In 1857, settlers founded Peru down the hill from Mount Vernon directly on the Missouri River. In 1861, a Methodist school called Mount Vernon Academy opened. In 1867, the school (which became Peru State College) became the state's first normal school. Floods in the 1860s changed the course of the river, pushing it nearly a mile from Peru.
