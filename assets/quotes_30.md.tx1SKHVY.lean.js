It is now a northern suburb of Colchester. The original village began approximately one mile north of the centre of Colchester which probably accounts for its name. This has varied over the centuries but essentially with the same meaning. It is the only part of Colchester to be a civil parish. Myland rises from about 19 metres in the south to about 50 metres in the north. It is within 30 minutes driving time of Sudbury and Ipswich. The earliest record of the original village is from 1254 when Mile End became a separate church parish. In the English Civil War, Colonel Fothergill's fort, a major Roundhead stronghold was located in the village. Daniel Defoe held a long lease on Tubswick, an ancient house in the village which burned down on 7 December 2009. He is said to have leased Tubswick for his daughter. His book \\"Moll Flanders\\" mentions Mile End. Colchester Borough Council has granted planning consent to two major housing developments in Myland, totalling more than 3,000 homes. These decisions have provoked strong local opposition. The larger development, of 1,600 homes,\\"The Gazette, 26 September 2013\\" is on greenfield land and is to include a new primary school, a new secondary school, a retail area and a community centre, all to be completed by 2021. The smaller development will add some 1,500 new homes on the former Severalls Hospital site, plus a primary school and community centre. Myland Community Council, founded in 1999, represents the Myland community. Its clerk and chief financial officer is Katherine Kane. The council is chaired by John Stewart. The parish has two public houses, 'The Bricklayers' and 'The Dog and Pheasant', as well as three churches/chapels. These are St. Michael's Parish Church (Church of England), a Methodist chapel and a Catholic church. There are two primary schools, Myland (in Mill Rd) and Queen Boudica (off Turner Rd). Both Colchester General Hospital and the private Oaks Hospital are to be found in the parish. Despite its size, Myland has no community centre. Myland has two areas of playing fields. Both are owned and maintained by the Borough Council. To the west, Mile End Playing Fields offer facilities for football and cricket while to the east, Mill Road Playing Fields are home to Colchester Rugby Club, supporting rugby union, cricket and archery. Colchester United F.C.'s ground, The Weston Homes Community Stadium, is on the Cuckoo Farm/Severalls development in the north of the parish.

It was located in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles. The school was reopened in 2019 as St. John Paul II STEM Academy. Background Bellarmine-Jefferson was a co-educational Catholic high school located in Burbank, CA that was founded by Monsignor Martin Cody Keating in 1944. Keating selected the school's name from St. Robert Bellarmine (a 17th- century Italian Jesuit priest) and Thomas Jefferson (the nation's 3rd president). The school colors are Red, White, and Royal Blue. The school mascot was the Guard, named for the Swiss Guard organization that has protected the pope since 1506. Bell-Jeff celebrated its first commencement ceremony with the class of 1948. The school's unofficial motto was \\"God helping me I will do my best today,\\" a quote attributed to St. Robert Bellarmine. The school closed in Spring 2018. Architecture The school's main building is a replica of the old Pennsylvania State House, also known as Independence Hall, located in Philadelphia, PA. Adjacent to the main building is St. Eleanor's Hall, a replica of the main library at the University of Virginia, designed by Thomas Jefferson. The main entry to St. Eleanor's Hall has 13 steps, representing the original 13 colonies in the order they became states by ratifying the U.S. Constitution. The clock tower on the main building is frozen to honor the two famous documents written in Independence Hall. On the north side of the tower is July 4, 1776 @ 8:00 pm to commemorate the signing of the Declaration of Independence and on the south side is September 17, 1787 @ 4:00 pm to commemorate the signing of the U.S. Constitution. Academics Bell-Jeff is a four-year college preparatory high school. As of the 2014-2015 school year the school offers eight Advanced Placement courses (Calculus, Chemistry, Chinese Language & Culture, English Literature, European History, Psychology, Spanish Language, and United States History), UC approved college prep courses, and a host of electives. In recent years the school has sent students to the University of Notre Dame, Johns Hopkins University, Georgetown University, Columbia University, Boston University, UCLA, UC Berkeley, USC, St. John's University, UC Santa Barbara, UC Irvine, Occidental College, University of Arizona, UC Riverside, Loyola Marymount University, Pepperdine University, and UNLV. Athletics Bell-Jeff offered 14 varsity sports. Girls competed in the Santa Fe League of the CIF Southern Section in six sports while boys competed in the Santa Fe League of CIF-SS in eight sports. * Athletics Website =Cross Country= The Cross Country teams were arguably the school's most successful sports program. The girls team won its league championship seven times since 2000, most recently in 2008, and was a consistent challenger in the CIF-SS Division V. Both teams hosted the annual Bellarmine-Jefferson Cross Country Invitational at Griffith Park. The Bell-Jeff Invitational was one of the largest and longest-running invitationals in Southern California. It was also the longest running event in Griffith Park. =Basketball= The most popular sport at Bell-Jeff has had it greatest success in the past two decades. The boys team has made the CIF-SS playoffs six consecutive years and had California's state leader in scoring in 1998 in Ruben Douglas. Douglas went on to lead the NCAA in scoring as a senior at the University of New Mexico and played professional basketball in Europe. The Guards last won the Santa Fe league title in 2011, ending a 14-year drought. The Lady Guards proudly own the school's only two sectional championships, winning the CIF-SS title during the 1996-1997 season and most recently during the 2008-2009 campaign. The 2008-2009 team went on to win the Southern California regional championship and then on March 20, 2009 defeated Pinewood Prep, 55-47, at Arco Arena in Sacramento to win the school's first California State Championship. The state championship was also the first ever for any Burbank area high school in a team sport. In addition, the team has appeared in the CIF-SS title game two times, losing both in 2003 and 2008. The Girls team also won the Nike Tournament of Champions in the Grey Division in 2008 and placed 3rd in 2009. After winning the CIF and State titles in 2009, the Lady Guards advanced to the CIF Semi-Finals for three consecutive seasons, 2010-2012. During the 2012 season Rishonda Napier was named the LA Daily News player of the year and was nominated as a McDonald's All-American. The Lady Guards basketball team won the 2017 CIF-SS Division 5A Championship and advanced to the CIF Semi-Finals in the State Tournament. =Football= The football team returned to play its 2012 home games at newly constructed Memorial Field on the campus of John Burroughs, after playing its 2011 home games at North Hollywood HS. Despite the school's small student population, the football team is consistently ranked in the top-ten of CIF-SS's Northeast Division. The team has won four league championships in its history - 1954, 2000, 2004, and most recently 2007. The 2008 team won the schools' 1st CIF playoff game since 1954, before falling in the CIF Quarterfinals. The Guards returned to the playoffs in 2012, and the future is bright as the Guards welcome new head coach and athletic director, Fred Martinez (Class of 1981) to the school for the 2014 season. =Volleyball= Both teams play their home games in Keating Memorial Gymnasium (nicknamed \\"The Guard House\\") on campus. The girls team won seven consecutive Santa Cruz league titles from 2006-2012. The girls had a 49-1 record during that time which included a winning streak of 46 matches. In 2009, the team advanced all the way to the CIF-SS Division IVA Championship game, the only title game appearance in school history. The Lady Guards had advanced to the CIF Quarterfinals in 1993 and 2008. In 2010 the girls reached the CIF Semi-Finals and then the Quarterfinals in 2011 - both years falling to the eventual division champion. The boys team also has fared well in recent years, qualifying for the CIF-SS Division V playoffs three consecutive years and having their finest season in 2007 when they advanced to the CIF Quarterfinals. =Baseball/Softball= The baseball team plays its home games at Burbank's Brace Park and competes in CIF-SS Division V. The team ended an almost twenty-year drought by winning the Santa Fe League Championship in 2005. The team qualified for the CIF-SS playoffs for nine consecutive years from 2003-2011. The softball team competes at Burbank's Gross Park and has qualified for the CIF-SS playoffs in each of the last nine seasons, winning its first playoff game since 1994 in 2008. The softball team has developed into one of the finest in the area. The Lady Guards have won five consecutive Santa Cruz League Championships from 2010-2014 (losing only one game during that time - by forfeit) and advanced to three consecutive CIF- SS Championship games, losing to Pomona Catholic in 2011 and again in 2012, before finally breaking through and winning the school's first CIF-SS softball championship on June 1, 2013, 8-4 over Mary Star of the Sea.

It corresponds to the European DVB-H and 1seg extensions of DVB-T and ISDB-T terrestrial digital TV standards respectively. ATSC is optimized for a fixed reception in the typical North American environment and uses 8VSB modulation. The ATSC transmission method is not robust enough against Doppler shift and multipath radio interference in mobile environments, and is designed for highly directional fixed antennas. To overcome these issues, additional channel coding mechanisms are introduced in ATSC-M/H to protect the signal. Evolution of mobile TV standard =Requirements= Several requirements of the new standard were fixed right from the beginning: * Completely backward compatible with ATSC (A/53) * Broadcasters can use their available license without additional restrictions * Available legacy ATSC receivers can be used to receive the ATSC (A/53) standard without any modification. =Proposals= Ten systems from different companies were proposed, and two remaining systems were presented with transmitter and receiver prototypes: * MPH (an acronym for mobile/pedestrian/handheld, suggesting miles per hour), was developed by LG Electronics and Harris Broadcast. (Zenith, a subsidiary of LG, developed much of the original ATSC system.) * A-VSB (Advanced-VSB) was developed by Samsung and Rohde & Schwarz. To find the best solution, the Advanced Television Systems Committee assigned the Open Mobile Video Coalition (OMVC) to test both systems. The test report was presented on May 15, 2008. As a result of this detailed work by the OMVC, a final standard draft was designed by the Advanced Television Systems Committee, specialist group S-4. ATSC-M/H will be a hybrid. Basically the following components of the proposed systems are used: * RF- Layer from the MPH standard * Deterministic frame structure from A-VSB * Signaling of service designed on the base of the established mobile standards =Standard milestones= On December 1, 2008, the Advanced Television Systems Committee elevated its specification for Mobile Digital Television to Candidate Standard status. In the following six months, the industry tested the standard. Before it became an official standard, additional improvements were proposed. * ATSC members approved the ballot on October 15, 2009 to official standard A/153. * ATSC introduced in January 2010 at Consumer Electronics Show, the name and logo for \\"MDTV\\" for ATSC A/153. Structure of mobile DTV standard The ATSC Mobile DTV standard ATSC-M/H (A/153) is modular in concept, with the specifications for each of the modules contained separate Parts. The individual Parts of A/153 are as follows: * Part 1 ‚ÄúATSC Mobile DTV System‚Äù describes the overall ATSC Mobile DTV system and explains the organization of the standard. It also describes the explicit signaling requirements that are implemented by data structures throughout the other Parts. * Part 2 ‚ÄúRF/Transmission System Characteristics‚Äù describes how the data is processed and placed into the VSB frame. Major elements include the Reed Solomon (RS) Frame, a Transmission Parameter Channel (TPC), and a Fast Information Channel (FIC). * Part 3 ‚ÄúService Multiplex and Transport Subsystem Characteristics‚Äù covers the service multiplex and transport subsystem, which comprises several layers in the stack. Major elements include Internet Protocol (IPv4), UniDirectional Protocol (UDP), Signaling Channel Service, FLUTE over Asynchronous Layered Coding (ALC) / Layered Coding Transport (LCT), Network Time Protocol (NTP) time service, and Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) / RTP Control Protocol (RTCP). * Part 4 ‚ÄúAnnouncement‚Äù: Part 4 covers Announcement, where services can optionally be announced using a Service Guide. The guide specified in Part 4 is based on an Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) broadcast (BCAST) OMA BCAST-Electronic program guide, with constraints and extensions. * Part 5 ‚ÄúApplication Framework‚Äù defines the Application framework, which enables the broadcaster of the audio-visual service to author and insert supplemental content to define and control various additional elements of the Rich Media Environment (RME). * Part 6 ‚ÄúService Protection‚Äù covers Service Protection, which refers to the protection of content, either files or streams, during delivery to a receiver. Major elements include the Right Issue Object and Short-Term Key Message (STKM). * Part 7 ‚ÄúAVC and SVC Video System Characteristics‚Äù defines the Advanced Video Coding (AVC) and Scalable Video Coding (SVC) Video System in the ATSC Mobile DTV system. Additional elements covered in this Part included closed captioning (CEA 708) and Active Format Description (AFD). * Part 8 ‚ÄúAHE AAC Audio System Characteristics‚Äù defines the High-Efficiency Advanced Audio Coding (HE-AAC v2) Audio System in the ATSC Mobile DTV system. * Part 9 ‚ÄúScalable Full Channel Mobile Mode‚Äù Principle ATSC-M/H is a service for mobile TV receivers and partly uses the 19.39 Mbit/s ATSC 8VSB stream. The mobile data is carried in an unreferenced Packet ID, so legacy receivers ignore the mobile data. Block Diagram Headend Technology ATSC-M/H bandwidth consumes fixed chunks of 917kbit/s out of the total ATSC Bandwidth. Each such chunk is called an M/H Group. A data pipe called a parade is a collection of one to eight M/H groups. A parade conveys one or two ensembles which are logical pipes of IP datagrams. Those datagrams in turn carry TV services, System Signaling tables, OMA DRM key streams and the Electronic Service Guide. ATSC-M/H has an improved design based on detailed analyses of experiences with other mobile DTV standards. ATSC-M/H Layer Model =Protocol stack= ATSC-M/H protocol stack is mainly an umbrella protocol that uses OMA ESG, OMA DRM, MPEG-4 in addition to many IETF RFCs. =Transport stream data structure= The ATSC-M/H standard defines a fixed transport stream structure, based on M/H Frames, which establishes the location of M/H content within the VSB Frames and allows for easier processing by an M/H receiver. This is contrary to the legacy ATSC transport stream, defined in A/53, in which there is no fixed structure to establish the phase of the data relative to VSB Frames. One M/H Frame is equivalent in size to 20 VSB Frames and has an offset of 37 transport stream (TS) packets relative to the beginning of the VSB Frame. Each M/H Frame, which has a fixed duration of 968 ms, is divided into five M/H sub-frames and each sub-frame is further subdivided into sixteen M/H Slots. Each slot is the equivalent amount of time needed to transmit 156 TS packets. A slot may either carry all main ATSC data (A/53) or 118 packets of M/H data and 38 packets of main data. The collection of 118 M/H packets transmitted within a slot is called an M/H Group. Each of the 118 M/H packets within an M/H Group are encapsulated inside a special TS packet, known as an MHE packet. An M/H Parade is a collection of M/H Groups and can carry one or two M/H Ensembles. These Ensembles are logical pipes for IP datagrams. Those datagrams in turn carry TV services and the signaling of mobile content. The M/H Groups from a single Parade are placed within M/H Slots according to an algorithm defined in A/153 Part 2. The Number of Groups per M/H Sub-Frame (NoG) for an M/H Parade ranges from 1 to 8 and therefore the number of Groups per an M/H Frame for a Parade ranges from 5 to 40 with a step of 5. The data of a Parade are channel coded and distributed by an interleaver during an M/H Frame. Mobile Data are protected by an additional FEC, as Interleaving and Convolutional codes. To improve the reception in the receiver, training sequences are introduced into the ATSC-M/H signal to allow channel estimation on the receiver side. Time slicing is a technique used by ATSC-M/H to provide power savings on receivers. It is based on the time- multiplexed transmission of different services. =Error protection= ATSC-M/H combines multiple error protection mechanisms for added robustness. One is an outer Reed‚ÄìSolomon error correction code which corrects defective bytes after decoding the outer convolutional code in the receiver. The correction is improved by an additional CRC checksum since bytes can be marked as defective before they are decoded (erasure decoding). The number of RS parity symbols can represent 24, 36 or 48. The symbols and the additional checksum form the outer elements of a data matrix which is allocated by the payload of the M/H Ensemble. The number of lines is fixed and the number of columns is variable according to how many slots per Subframe are occupied. The RS Frame is then partitioned into several segments of different sizes and assigned to specified regions. The M/H data in these regions are protected by an SCCC (Series Concatenated Convolutional Code), incorporating a code rate of 1/2 or 1/4, and is specific to each region in a group. A 1/4 rate PCCC (Parallel Concatenated Convolutional Code) is also employed as an inner code for the M/H signaling channel, which includes FIC (Fast Information Channel) and TPC (Transmission Parameter Channel). The TPC carries various FEC modes and M/H Frame information. Once the TPC is extracted, the receiver then knows the code rates being employed and can decode each region at its specified rate. A modified trellis encoder is also employed for backwards compatibility with legacy A/53 receivers. The time interleaving of ATSC-M/H is 1 second. =Signaling= ATSC M/H Signaling and Announcement defines three different layers of signalling. The layers are organized hierarchically and optimized to characteristics of the transmission layer. * Transmission Signaling System is the lowest layer and uses the Transmission Parameter Channel (TPC). It provides information for the receiver needed to decode the signal * Transport Signaling System is the second layer, which uses the Fast Information Channel (FIC) in combination with the Service Signaling Channel (SSC). The main purpose of the FIC is to deliver essential information to allow rapid service acquisition by the receiver. The Service Signaling Channel (SSC), consists of several different signaling tables. The information carried within these tables can be compared to the PSIP information of ATSC. The SSC provides mainly the basic information, the logical structure of the transmitted services and the decoding parameters for video and audio. * Announcement / Electronic Service Guide (ESG) is the highest layer of signaling. It uses the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) Broadcast Service Enabler Suite (OMA BCAST) Electronic Service Guide (ESG). An ESG is delivered as a file data session File Delivery over Unidirectional Transport (FLUTE), and is used as the delivery protocol. The ESG consists of several XML sections. With this structure, a program guide and enabled interactive services can be realized. =Signaling of video- and audio coding= Each video- or audio decoder needs information about the used coding parameters, for instance resolution, frame rate and IDR (Random Access Point) repetition rate. In MPEG-4/AVC, mobile TV systems the receiver uses information from the Session Description Protocol File (SDP-File). The SDP-file is a format which describes streaming media initialization parameters. In ATSC-M/H, the SDP-File is transmitted within the SMT-Table. Most of the information is coded in binary, but some is coded in the original ASCII text format. The SMT-Table combines information that is typically in different tables and reduces the complexity for the network and the receivers. In case of signaling with ESG, the complete SDP-File is transmitted. =Single-frequency network (SFN)= In an SFN, two or more transmitters with an overlapping coverage send the same program content simultaneously on the same frequency. The 8VSB modulation used by ATSC allows SFN transmissions. To allow regular channel approximation, ATSC-M/H provides additional training sequences. ATSC A/110 defines a method to synchronize the ATSC modulator as part of the transmitter. The A/110 standard sets up the Trellis coder in a pre-calculated way to all transmitters of the SFN. In such an SFN, the ATSC-M/H multiplexer and the ATSC-M/H transmitter are synchronized by a GPS reference. The ATSC-M/H multiplexer operates as a network adapter and inserts time stamps in the MPEG transport stream. The transmitter analyzes the time stamp, delays the transport stream before it is modulated and transmitted. Eventually, all SFN transmitters generate a synchronized signal. Other mobile standards Until its shutdown, MediaFLO had been available in parts of the United States. It was a premium service that required subscription. ATSC-M/H would be free to air, as are regular broadcast signals.

Rapaport has been called a \\"maverick\\"A DIAMOND MAVERICK'S WAR WITH THE CLUB ON 47TH STREET New York Times November 13, 1984 within the diamond industry, and is often recognized for his signature bow tie. Rapoport was an early proponent of the Kimberley Process aimed at limiting the number of \\"conflict diamonds\\" in worldwide circulation. Each year Rapaport hosts an International Diamond Conference which tackles important and relevant topics facing those in the diamond trade world. Education and early career Martin Rapaport began his work in diamonds as a cleaver and rough sorter in Antwerp, Belgium. He began brokering rough and polished diamonds in New York City in 1975.GIA bio for Martin Rapaport In 1978, he created the Rapaport Price List, which some say is not reflective of true prices. He has since created many businesses relating to the diamond industry that eponymously bear his name. He launched the electronic trading network for called RapNet in 1980 and several diamond- related news sources in print and web formats. He is a member of several non- profit and diamond-industry-related organizations, including the Jewelers for Children Charity Fund, the Diamond Manufacturers and Importers Association of America and the Jewelers Vigilance Committee. Following personal visits to Sierra Leone in the early 2000s, Rapaport advocated more for a Kimberley Process and launched Rapaport Fair Trade. The price list He is considered controversial by many within the diamond industry for publishing the Rapaport Diamond Report in the late 1970s, which has become the de facto standard baseline for pricing wholesale polished diamonds. His guide is cited as being the chief reason diamonds cost significantly less than what they used to during the commodities boom of that time. Activities Martin Rapaport's impact within the industry is largely controversial because his commercial price guides have made manipulation of prices much more difficult for the diamond industry, and are considered a step toward commoditizing diamonds. This is an affront to all the industry represents, with efforts to sell diamonds as something as unique as a snowflake, and of eternal value, hence the De Beers' sales pitch A Diamond Is Forever. It is no coincidence either, that Rapaport has largely played a maverick role in issues such as conflict diamonds, synthetic diamonds, diamond treatments, and Fair-Trade diamond issues, or has often been an unlikely ally to NGOs. The Rapaport Diamond Corporation has been criticized for publishing wholesale price guides for diamonds whilst allegedly simultaneously trading in diamonds directly to consumers (thereby possibly cutting out the wholesalers who subscribe to the Rapaport Diamond Corporation's services). Pricing =Diamonds as a commodity= Rapaport originally tried in 1982 by filing out a contract proposal to the New York Mercantile Exchange to create a diamond commodity market. The effort failed, he claimed, because the \\"diamond industry didn't want price transparency.\\" He is currently writing a new proposal and believes it will only be a matter of time before the idea succeeds, as long as a sufficient criteria of standardization is created. Rapaport says diamonds are \\"definitely a commodity.\\" > You buy and sell them for cash. They're a natural resource with limited > supply; they're well defined; they're certified; they're analyzed, graded, > tradable around the world. Neil D. Reiff writes that Rapaport is \\"destroying\\" the diamond industry with trying to commoditize diamonds, and his price guide no longer reflects the wholesale value of diamonds as they are sold, but influences what those prices are before they go to market. Rapaport counters that diamonds are not unique, as De Beers marketing claims, and are subject to the same laws of supply and demand as anything else.Martin Rapaport One man's destruction of our industry A New York Times report in 2012 cited Rapaport among a list of other major industry players like Edahn Golan and companies like IDEX who are countering the argument that diamonds have too many characteristic differences to be traded in a standardized commodity market.Diamonds as a Commodity New York Times April 12, 2012 =Price manipulation= Dating back to the genesis of his price guide, Rapaport has been an outspoken critic of De Beers, and what he believes is an effort to manipulate diamond prices. He recently made a reference to the negative unintended consequences of the corporation's practice of trying to control supply of diamonds in the market: > The diamond pipeline is stuffed like a goose and there's some indigestion. In reference to the possibility large companies might dictate prices in the future, Mr. Rapaport stated: > There are powerful companies involved in diamonds and real concerns about > price manipulation, but it is supply and demand that will determine price. > If I think the prices on the exchange are not fair, I will walk away from > this project. =Diamonds as an investment= Rapaport has spoken at length about diamonds as an investment. In 2008 while speaking to the Guardian, he cited diamonds' durability even during the 2008 financial crisis because \\"there is so much new wealth around the globe and wives want in on the action - and if they can't get their hands on big stones, then the price will only go up.\\"Martin Rapaport talks up diamond investments as demand for large stones surges 12 Jun 2008 As recently as Summer 2012, he has referred to the investment market as very good because of low prices for the stones and high, rising demand out of emerging markets in China and India.Investing in Diamonds: The Clear-Cut Truth Wall Street Journal 24 Oct 2012 Rapaport argues that diamonds are indeed a commodity, against detractors who would say each stone has to be evaluated individually based on a list of different factors.Diamonds as a Commodity New York Times 13 Apr 2012 =European Commission= Martin Rapaport submitted papers in 2002 and in 2005 criticizing the European Commission's handling of investigations of collusion between De Beers and Russia's state owned diamond cartel, ALROSA. He alleged the European body ignored evidence that ALROSA was selling diamonds to De Beers at prices 8 to 20 percent below market value, and was aiding and abetting unethical and illegal business practices. Synthetics This view of diamonds also carries over to the discussion of synthetic diamonds. While he does not believe they will be as valuable as diamonds mined from the earth,Faux diamonds sparking a gem war he believes that synthetics are yet another commodity that jewelers can sell for whatever value the marketplace deems their worth, but that consumers are always going to want full disclosure that a diamond they are buying is coming from a lab, rather than mined from the ground > The concern in the industry today is what if, just what if there is a way to > synthesise diamonds that are non-detectable from natural diamonds? What if > technology uses the ability to make this synthetic diamond and no one knows > this is synthetic?\\" Conflict diamonds Rapaport has traveled extensively to Sierra Leone, since 2000, long before mainstream media, Hollywood or the diamond industry took an interest in the civil war there, or the role diamonds played in it. NGO Global Witness made Rapaport aware of the situation and invited him to visit. This early trip is featured in the 3 hour Canadian documentary Diamond Road directed by Nisha Pahuja, produced by Kensington Communications (Canada). After returning, he wrote and published \\"Guilt Trip\\" which was quoted in the United States Congressional Record: > Hundreds of millions of dollars of Sierra Leone diamonds are being traded on > the world markets without any benefit going to the government or people of > Sierra Leone. The real problem facing Sierra Leone is not merely how to > share diamond resources among warring factions, but how to stop the illegal > diamond industry from stealing the country's resources. But it goes beyond > that. The bastards are not just stealing Sierra Leone's diamonds, they are > trading them for guns. Guns which are used to kill people to keep the war > going ... The real challenge facing Sierra Leone and the world diamond > trade, is how to stop this horrific murderous cycle of illegal diamond > activity.DIRTY DIAMONDS AND CIVIL SOCIETY =Kimberley Process Certification Scheme= Martin is a key member of the Kimberley Process Plenary, the cooperative United Nations / diamond industry partnership to self-regulate the end to conflict diamonds. Martin has been cited as a technical asset to the process by the South African government,PRESENTATION BY MINISTER OF MINERALS AND ENERGY, MS PHUMZILE MLAMBO-NGCUKA AT THE KIMBERLEY PROCESS HANDING OVER CEREMONY, Sun City, 31 October 2003 and has advocated the need for better price transparency as a means of keeping the industry honest. Fair Trade Diamonds He has long since been an advocate of finding an equitable solution to exploitation of West African labor, and has tried to build mining collectives in Sierra Leone and create a place in the market for what he calls \\"Fair Trade Diamonds\\" that would be certified as guilt and exploitation-free. =International Diamond Conference= Rapaport annually addresses ethical dilemmas within the industry at the Rapaport International Diamond Conference,Interview Fair trade stones with a 'spiritual sparkle beyond price' where he invites Non-Governmental organizations such as Global Witness and Amnesty InternationalUK Blood Diamonds - New call on industry to clean up diamond trade to meet with diamond industry leaders. =Artisanal diggers= Under his plan, diggers in West Africa will register and be invited to bring diamonds to a public auction. Rapaport says he will pay 5% more than the gems' market value. After independent monitors ensure that diggers are paid about a third of the purchase price, a \\"development diamond\\" label will be applied before gems are shipped to jewelers. Rapaport, in cooperation with the U.S. Agency for International Development and Global Witness invested $60,000 of his own money to create four alluvial mining cooperatives in Sierra Leone, but ultimately sees \\"Fair-Trade\\" diamonds as the solutions to West Africa's woes. Critics =African People's Solidarity Committee= Groups such as the African People's Solidarity Committee, who protested at the 2007 Rapaport International Diamond Conference in New York, say that \\"all diamonds are blood diamonds\\" and that Rapaport's efforts to help artisanal miners is nothing more than a public relations ploy: > The African People's Solidarity Committee rejects this public relations > ploy. They are calling for nothing less than all of Africa's resources under > the control of the African working class itself. Africa is the richest > continent on earth. Africans don't need charity; they need control over > their own land.Diamond Industry Reps Scurry to Defend Profits African > People's Solidarity Committee =Charles Wyndham= Charles Wyndham, owner of PolishedPrices, Rapaport's main competitor in diamond pricing, is often very critical of Martin Rapaport's prices and personality, often referring to him as \\"Boney\\", a comparison to Napoleon Bonaparte. Wyndham refers to Martin Rapaport nearly weekly, and criticizes his diamond prices as being too low,Use of Rap proving costly by Charles Wyndham see also Boney's seasons greetings! by Charles Wyndham and Good news for Martin in Bedlam by Charles Wyndham having a flawed or arbitrary methodologyLaw of Inverse Proportion by Charles Wyndham or too much like Wyndham's own prices.Bumbling Boney by Charles Wyndham He has also accused Rapaport of having a monopoly on diamond grading with GIA.Boney and Vomit by Charles Wyndham =Chaim Even-Zohar= Chaim Even-Zohar, an (now retired) analyst for diamondintelligence.com, a diamond industry news rival to Rapaport's own Rapaport News, is also a frequent critic of Martin Rapaport. Even-Zohar singled Martin out in his editorial about a corruption scandal within the Gemological Institute of America (GIA), where graders were caught giving a pair of diamond earrings intended for a Saudi royal a higher grade than they warranted. Even-Zohar made note of Rapaport's silence in the case, noting the close relationship Rapaport has with the laboratory, and the exclusive access his customers (diamond traders who use Rapaport's RAPNET trading platform) enjoy with the lab as a consequence. Chaim Even-Zohar even went so far as to say that Martin Rapaport's silence about the case was hypocritical, and undermined the credibility of his trade publications, especially in light of him being an outspoken proponent of transparency.

Located in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles, Providence is known for its college-prep academic programs, with the option to specialize in one of three focus programs: Cinema Arts, Medical and Technology. Providence is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges, Western Catholic Educational Association, California Association of Independent Schools, and most recently, the National Association of Independent Schools. History On September 19, 1955, Providence High School opened its doors to 81 female students. A recent cement strike had resulted in a shortage of building materials, and construction on the school was not completed in time for the students' arrival. Under the guidance of the school's first principal, Sr. Mary Gleason, SP (Maria Theresa), the first classes were taught in donated circus tents in the parking lot. On November 2, 1955, classes were able to move into the first floor of what is now known as the \\"A\\" building, but only three rooms were accessible to students at that time. In fall 1957, the school adopted the Alma Mater, written by Cathy Wade Shepard '60, with music by her father, William Wade. On June 15, 1959, 68 young women took part in the school's first annual commencement, held at the Starlight Bowl. In May 1960, the Board of Admissions and Relations of the University of California granted accreditation to Providence High School. =From All Girls to Coeducational= In May 1973, school officials began to discuss with the Archdiocese the possibility of making the school coeducational. It was decided in January 1974 that the school should indeed include boys for the following school year. =1980s and 1990s= Enrollment declined in the 1980s, a problem faced by many Catholic schools in the area, leading to the most difficult challenge in the school's history. In the fall of 1988, with enrollment at an all-time low of fewer than 200 students, the Sisters of Providence announced that the school would close at the end of the 1988-1989 school year. A group of determined parents and students were very upset by the news and banded together along with Principal Sr. Lucille Dean, SP to improve Providence's enrollment. Impressed by the parents‚Äô devotion, the Sisters of Providence agreed that if 100 potential students took the school's entrance exam that spring and enrollment reached 400 students within four years, then Providence High School would remain open. =2000s to Present Day= On December 11, 2000, the school held a groundbreaking ceremony for the planned student activity center. Construction of the new facility, featuring a gym, conference room, snack shop, weight room, and exercise room, began on January 9, 2001 and was completed in early 2002. The Fritz B. Burns Student Activity Center was dedicated and blessed at a special liturgical celebration on January 20, 2002. Sr. Lucille Dean, SP retired from her position as principal at the conclusion of the 2004-2005 school year and, Mrs. Michele Schulte, became the school's 7th Principal. After Mr. Michael Collins spent one year as Interim Head of School in 2010-2011, the school appointed Mr. Joe Sciuto as Head of School. The 2012-2013 school year marked the opening of the long anticipated Science Center, which contains biology, chemistry and physics classrooms and labs. PHS has been continually accredited by Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC), Western Catholic Educational Association (WCEA) and has recently become a member of California Association of Independent Schools (CAIS). Providence's first head of school, Joe Sciuto served the Catholic high school until the spring of 2019. Administrative leadership changed in the Fall of 2019 when Scott McLarty was selected to become Providence High School's second Head of School and changing former Principal Allison Castro's title to Assistant Head of School. Focus Programs =Cinema Arts Focus Program= The Cinema Arts Focus Program explores the influencer that narrative has in media through an in-depth hands- on curriculum. The Cinema Arts Focus Center is a first-class studio with professional-grade equipment. Cinema Arts students are given the opportunity to compete in various film competitions and to hear from guest speakers currently working in the industry. =Medical Focus Program= The four-year program covers topics from health, medicine, and biotechnology to health care within political, social, economic, religious and ethical frameworks. The program is the result of a partnership between Providence High School and Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center. Expansion of the program now includes participation and support of the following organizations/institutions: Providence Holy Cross Medical Center, Shriner's Hospital, USC University Hospital, LAC+USC Medical Center, Glendale Memorial Hospital, Kaiser Permanente, Midway Medical Center, Huntington Memorial Hospital, and Cedars- Sinai Medical Center. =Technology Focus Program= The Technology Focus Program is designed as a broad-based introduction into various kinds of technology, providing a launching pad for further college study and industry application. In 2018, the Technology Focus Program Center held its ribbon cutting ceremony unveiling a 32-station computer lab, four 3-D printers, a CNC machine, a mill machine and a laser cutter. This facility is open for Technology Focus Program students enrolled in the four-year program.

The enterprise is a part of Polska Grupa Zbrojeniowa SA. In the past it used to produce non-military equipment, most notably sewing machines and typewriters, but those branches were deemed unprofitable and were dropped in 2000. History The company was founded in the Second Polish Republic to produce arms for Wojsko Polskie. In 1925 the main building, steel hardening shop, power plant, boiler room, woodshop, bath, and the workers‚Äô houses were erected. On 31 December 1927, production was launched when, by an act signed by then Director of the plant Msc.Eng. Kazimierz O≈Çdakowski, the plant was officially taken over from the local government and became part of the Pa≈Ñstwowe Wytw√≥rnie Uzbrojenia concern. O≈Çdakowski insisted that his workers receive free health care. He also arranged for child care services and regular leisure time, and built gymnasiums, theaters, gardens, and housing for his workers. During his directorship the Vis pistol (pistolet wz. 35 Vis) was developed. During World War II it was captured and operated by the Germans. After World War II the factory was renamed: Zak≈Çady Metalowe im. gen. \\"Waltera\\" (General Walter Metal Works). It received the factory code number of 11; to prevent confusion with an earlier Factory #11, the number received a single circle around it to difference it. In 1990 the factory returned to its old name Zak≈Çady Metalowe \\"≈Åucznik\\" (Metal Works \\"≈Åucznik\\"), \\"≈Çucznik\\" meaning 'archer'. It became a state-owned company (SA).

The term \\"protracted phonological development\\" is sometimes preferred when describing children's speech, to emphasize the continuing development while acknowledging the delay.  Classification  Speech sound disorders may be subdivided into two primary types, articulation disorders (also called phonetic disorders) and phonemic disorders (also called phonological disorders). However, some may have a mixed disorder in which both articulation and phonological problems exist. Though speech sound disorders are associated with childhood, some residual errors may persist into adulthood. = Articulation disorders = Articulation disorders (also called phonetic disorders, or simply \\"artic disorders\\" for short) are based on difficulty learning to physically produce the intended phonemes. Articulation disorders have to do with the main articulators which are the lips, teeth, alveolar ridge, hard palate, velum, glottis, and the tongue. If the disorder has anything to do with any of these articulators, then it is an articulation disorder. There are usually fewer errors than with a phonemic disorder, and distortions are more likely (though any omissions, additions, and substitutions may also be present). They are often treated by teaching the child how to physically produce the sound and having them practice its production until it (hopefully) becomes natural. Articulation disorders should not be confused with motor speech disorders, such as dysarthria (in which there is actual paralysis of the speech musculature) or developmental verbal dyspraxia (in which motor planning is severely impaired). = Phonemic disorders = In a phonemic disorder (also called a phonological disorders) the child is having trouble learning the sound system of the language, failing to recognize which sound-contrasts also contrast meaning. For example, the sounds /k/ and /t/ may not be recognized as having different meanings, so \\"call\\" and \\"tall\\" might be treated as homophones, both being pronounced as \\"tall.\\" This is called phoneme collapse, and in some cases many sounds may all be represented by one ‚Äî e.g., /d/ might replace /t/, /k/, and /g/. As a result, the number of error sounds is often (though not always) greater than with articulation disorders and substitutions are usually the most common error. Phonemic disorders are often treated using minimal pairs (two words that differ by only one sound) to draw the child's attention to the difference and its effect on communication. Some children with phonemic disorders may seem to be able to hear phoneme distinctions in the speech of others but not their own. This is called the fis phenomenon based on scenario in which a speech pathologist will say, \\"Did you say 'fis,' don't you mean 'fish'?\\" To which the child responds, \\"No, I didn't say 'fis,' I said 'fis'.\\" In some cases, the sounds produced by the child are actually acoustically different, but not significantly enough for others to distinguish ‚Äì because those sounds are not phonemically unique to speakers of the language. Though phonemic disorders are often considered language disorders in that it is the language system that is affected, they are also speech sound disorders in that the errors relate to use of phonemes. This makes them different from specific language impairment, which is primarily a disorder of the syntax (grammar) and usage of language rather than the sound system. However, the two can coexist, affecting the same person. Other disorders can deal with a variety of different ways to pronounce consonants. Some examples are glides and liquids. Glides occur when the articulatory posture changes gradually from consonant to vowel. Liquids can include /l/ and /…π/ . = Mixed speech sound disorders = In some cases phonetic and phonemic errors may coexist in the same person. In such case the primary focus is usually on the phonological component but articulation therapy may be needed as part of the process, since teaching a child how to use a sound is not practical if the child does not know how to produce it. = Residual errors = Even though most speech sound disorders can be successfully treated in childhood, and a few may even outgrow them on their own, errors may sometimes persist into adulthood rather than only being not age appropriate. Such persisting errors are referred to as \\"residual errors\\" and may remain for life.  Presentation  Errors produced by children with speech sound disorders are typically classified into four categories: *Omissions: Certain sounds are not produced ‚Äî entire syllables or classes of sounds may be deleted; e.g., fi' for fish or 'at for cat. *Additions (or Epentheses/Commissions): an extra sound or sounds are added to the intended word; e.g. puh-lane for plane. *Distortions: Sounds are changed slightly so that the intended sound may be recognized but sounds \\"wrong,\\" or may not sound like any sound in the language. *Substitutions: One or more sounds are substituted for another; e.g., wabbit for rabbit or tow for cow. Sometimes, even for experts, telling exactly which type has been made is not obvious ‚Äî some distorted forms of /…π/ may be mistaken for /w/ by a casual observer, yet may not actually be either sound but somewhere in between. Further, children with severe speech sound disorders may be difficult to understand, making it hard to tell what word was actually intended and thus what is actually wrong with it. Some terms can be used to describe more than one of the above categories, such as lisp, which is often the replacement of /s/ with /Œ∏/ (a substitution), but can be a distortion, producing /s/ just behind the teeth resulting in a sound somewhere between /s/ and /Œ∏/. There are three different levels of classification when determining the magnitude and type of an error that is produced: # Sounds the patient can produce ##A: Phonemic- can be produced easily; used meaningfully and contrastively ##B: Phonetic- produced only upon request; not used consistently, meaningfully, or contrastively; not used in connected speech # Stimulable sounds ##A: Easily stimulable ##B: Stimulable after demonstration and probing (i.e. with a tongue depressor) # Cannot produce the sound ##A: Cannot be produced voluntarily ##B: No production ever observed Note that omissions do not mean the sound cannot be produced, and some sounds may be produced more easily or frequently when appearing with certain other sounds: someone might be able to say \\"s\\" and \\"t\\" separately, but not \\"st,\\" or may be able to produce a sound at the beginning of a word but not at the end. The magnitude of the problem will often vary between different sounds from the same speaker.  Causes  Most speech sound disorders occur without a known cause. A child may not learn how to produce sounds correctly or may not learn the rules of speech sounds on his or her own. These children may have a problem with speech development, which does not always mean that they will simply outgrow it by themselves. Many children do develop speech sounds over time but those who do not often need the services of a Speech-Language Pathologist to learn correct speech sounds. Some speech sound errors can result from other syndromes or disorders such as: * developmental disorders (e.g. autism) * genetic disorders (e.g. Down syndrome) * hearing loss, including temporary hearing loss, such as from ear infections * cleft palate or other physical anomalies of the mouth * illness * neurological disorders (e.g. cerebral palsy) Diagnosis  In a typical 2-year-old child, about 50% of speech may be intelligible. A 4-year-old child's speech should be intelligible overall, and a 7-year-old should be able to clearly produce most words consistent with community norms for their age. Misarticulation of certain difficult sounds ([], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], and []) may be normal up to 8 years. Children with speech sound disorder have pronunciation difficulties inappropriate for their age, and the difficulties are not caused by hearing problems, congenital deformities, motor disorders or selective mutism. The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria are as follows: > *A. Persistent difficulty with speech sound production that interferes with > speech intelligibility or prevents verbal communication of messages. *B. The > disturbance causes limitations in effective communication that interfere > with social participation, academic achievement, or occupational > performance, individually or in any combination. *C. Onset of symptoms is in > the early developmental period. *D. The difficulties are not attributable to > congenital or acquired conditions, such as cerebral palsy, cleft palate, > deafness or hearing loss, traumatic brain injury, or other medical or > neurological conditions. Treatment For most children, the disorder is not lifelong and speech difficulties improve with time and speech-language treatment. Prognosis is poorer for children who also have a language disorder, as that may be indicative of a learning disorder.

It is operated by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles and accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges and the Western Catholic Educational Association  History  St. Pius X-St. Matthias Academy was born from two great traditions of Catholic Education in the Archdiocese of Los Angeles- Pius X High School (1953-1998) and St. Matthias High School (1963-2013). In the year 1953, the Archdiocese of Los Angeles launched Pius X High School which served a co-ed population from the southeast area of Los Angeles County. The campus was home to Pius X High School from 1953 until the Archdiocese of Los Angeles announced a school realignment transforming the co-ed Pius X High School, into a consolidation with the all-girls St. Matthias High School, eventually phasing out the Pius X program over a three-year period. About 80% of St. Matthias' all-girls student body of 300 transferred to Pius X campus. This resulted in a larger all-girl Catholic high school located on the sprawling 15-acre Pius X campus which became known as St. Matthias High School for Girls. = Pius X High School = Pius X High School (Pius X) was a co- educational, private, four-year (grade levels 9-12) high school. Named for Pope Pius X, it was founded in 1954. The present campus of St. Pius X - St. Matthias Academy on Gardendale Street is Pius X's campus. Fr. James W. Keefe was named principal in 1967, and the following year, instituted a concept of modern teaching, the Model School Project. Pius employed an educational model called \\"non-gradedness,\\" which placed a student in a class where his or her present achievement was the deciding factor. Emphasis was put on progress and learning by the individual. The plan was discontinued after Keefe left in 1975. Declining enrollment from the 1980s onward placed financial pressure on the Archdiocese's high schools, prompting Pius X to begin fundraisers and to form a new alumni association in 1986. A 25 percent drop in enrollment in 1992 prompted drastic cost-cutting, including the firing of two coaches and the elimination of many sports. = St. Matthias High School = A school was first established at Stafford Avenue and Belgrade Street in Huntington Park in 1926, to serve as the parochial school of the parish of St. Matthias, where Msgr. Patrick Shear was pastor. It was leveled in the 1933 Long Beach earthquake and rebuilt, then converted to St. Matthias High School in 1960. It was staffed by the Sisters of Notre Dame. St. Matthias High School was recognized as a Blue Ribbon School of Excellence by the United States Department of Education in May 2002 and was accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges and the Western Catholic Education Association. St. Matthias had a well-regarded fine-arts department, producing highly acclaimed productions in theater, music and art. Actress Sabrina Le Beauf was a 1976 graduate. = Merger = In early 1995, the Archdiocese of Los Angeles announced a school realignment that would make the Pius X campus co-institutional with the all-girl St. Matthias High School. The Pius X program was to be phased out over a three-year period, leaving the institution an all-girls school. The merger plan was met with opposition from students, parents, teachers and civic leaders alike. Pius X students staged a walkout in February 1995 to protest the decision to make the school single-sex, and students, parents and teachers from St. Matthias staged their own protest against the closure of the Huntington Park campus. The plan proceeded, but the school continued to operate under capacity. In 2011, the St. Matthias Advisory Board and the Archdiocese asked Loyola Marymount University's Center for Catholic Education to conduct a detailed study on options for St. Matthias. The Center for Catholic Education study looked at how the school was achieving their Catholic education mission. It was decided to convert the facility back to a co-ed school, and the name St. Pius X - St. Matthias Academy was chosen to honor the traditions of both institutions. Its mission today focuses on providing a challenging Catholic college preparatory education in a supportive learning community that will positively affect the lives of teenagers, and provide opportunities for all students to grow in faith, learn without limits, and live with a purpose. That mission carries the belief that a college education is a right rather than a privilege, and that every student deserves a chance to pass through that gateway to success in life. Every day, caring teachers enthusiastically promote each student as a significant member of the community, guiding them past any obstacles that could keep them from seizing academic, personal, and spiritual growth opportunities. Its mission is accomplished when their graduates thrive in college, become role-models for future graduates, and pursue the service of God, country, and humanity towards the common good. St. Pius X-St. Matthias Academy or PMA as it is known among the community, serves a co-ed population of approximately 400 students from diverse economic and cultural backgrounds. It recently announced plans to begin work on the first phase of the PMA Campus Master plan that was completed in the Spring 2017. Through the generosity of the J.F. Shea Co. and the John H. & Cynthia Lee Smet Foundation, the school will begin the new construction and expansion of numerous projects on campus set to begin in the Fall of 2017.  Athletics  St. Pius X - St. Matthias Academy competes with other southeastern Los Angeles County Catholic schools in the Santa Fe League, in the CIF Southern Section. As of 2015, they field teams in cheerleading, cross country, volleyball, football, soccer, basketball, track & field, baseball, and softball.

The younger son of film producer G. K. Reddy, Vishal studied Visual Communications at Loyola College, Chennai. Best known for his roles in action films, he produces films under his production company, Vishal Film Factory. Vishal made an entrance into the film industry as an assistant director for Arjun. He then became an actor and played his first lead role in the romantic thriller Chellamae (2004), before going on to star in the commercially successful action films Sandakozhi, Thimiru, Thaamirabharani and Malaikottai. Following a series of unsuccessful films at the box office, Vishal chose to create his own production studio and has since produced and worked on profitable ventures such as Pandiya Naadu (2013), Naan Sigappu Manithan (2014) and Poojai (2014). Vishal was elected as the General Secretary of the Nadigar Sangam in October 2015 after initiating a movement against the previous committee. He was expelled from Tamil Film Producers' Council (TFPC) for remarks against the council. Later in April 2017, he won the election and got elected as President of Tamil Film Producers Council.  Personal life  Vishal Krishna was born to G. K. Reddy and Janaki Devi on 29 August 1977 in Chennai.. His father was a film producer for Telugu and Tamil films and his family settled in Chennai. His elder brother Vikram Krishna has produced several of Vishal's films and had previously appeared as an actor in films under the screen name of Ajay. Vishal also has a younger sister Aishwarya. Vishal obtained his secondary education from Don Bosco Matriculation Higher Secondary School before securing a degree in visual communications from Loyola College, Chennai. = Allegations of sexual exploitation and casting couch = Actress Sri Reddy, who previously blamed many celebrities of indulging in casting couch and sexually exploiting her in Kollywood and Tollywood, stated in July 2018 that she has received threats from Vishal for exposing the casting couch in the Tamil Film Industry. She later accused Vishal of sexually exploiting several girls in the Tamil film industry and challenged him to prove her allegations wrong and also said that she doesn't care even if Vishal destroys her career. Vishal responded by saying there are no evidences for her accusations. = Arrest = Vishal was arrested by police in December 2019 when he tried to enter inside the Tamil Film Producers Council in T Nagar, Chennai by forcefully trying to break the lock. The council was locked by 300 film producers claiming that Vishal failed to fulfill his promises during the election in 2015. His father claimed that Vishal was indulging in criminal activities and even has shares in the piracy website Tamil Rockers.  Career  =2004‚Äì2011= Vishal assisted actor- director Arjun Sarja in his venture Vedham (2001), and a producer spotted Vishal on the sets of the film and signed him to appear in an acting role in Gandhi Krishna's Chellamae (2004). Accepting the role, Vishal prepared by joining Koothu-P-Pattarai to hone his acting skills and played the protagonist role of Raghunandan, whose wife is kidnapped by her childhood friend. A critic described his performance is \\"apt\\" but \\"there was plenty left to hone\\". His next film was Sandakozhi (2005) with N. Linguswamy, who had previously worked with his father's production house as an assistant director. Vishal was described to have \\"improved from his Chellamae days\\" and \\"clicked as an action hero\\". Film journalists stated that he was \\"the fastest rising action hero\\" of the time. After a cameo as himself in Sasi's Dishyum (2006), he went on to appear in Tarun Gopi's action film Thimiru (2006). The film opened to mixed reviews with Vishal being praised for his intense performance with a critic calling his performance \\"the film's only strength and, to an extent, making up for the weak script and poor characterisation\\". The film became Vishal's third consecutive commercial success, and he began to emerge in Tamil films. His next film, the political action drama Sivappathigaram (2006), directed by Karu Pazhaniappan was a failure financially despite favourable reviews. His next film was released in January 2007, Hari's multi-starring family action drama Thaamirabharani (2007) and the film went on to gain considerable box office success, carrying good reports amidst other big budget releases. Later in the year, he appeared in Boopathy Pandian's Malaikottai (2007), a comedy entertainer. In his first full-length comic role, Vishal received mixed feedback for his portrayal from critics, with Rediff stating that he is \\"a far cry from the rather endearing young man in Sandakozhi\\", whilst describing his performance as \\"cringe-able\\". Behindwoods stated it as an \\"Average masala-mix entertainer\\". The film took a large opening and was declared a blockbuster, featuring in the top 10 at behindwoods box office. In the year 2008, for the first time, Vishal portrayed a police officer in Sathyam, which became a commercial failure at the box office. Then both his films Thoranai (2009) and Theeradha Vilaiyattu Pillai (2010) were just average grossers. Additionally, the box-office duds, Sathyam and Thoranai, both of which were bilingual in Tamil and Telugu, failed to establish his popularity in Telugu cinema. Vishal was then given the opportunity to feature in Bala's dark comedy Avan Ivan (2011), after being recommended to the director by his friend Arya. Portraying a village stage actor with a squint, Vishal had severe eye pain and headaches, and he also had a serious muscular injury on sets. The film opened to mixed reviews, though Vishal's performance won positive reviews. Indiaglitz stated that Vishal delivered an \\"award winning performance\\" and that his \\"mannerisms and body language give you goosebumps\\". The reviewer further cited that \\"Vishal's spontaneous response to his mentor's death in the movie is touching. His demonstration of Navarasas in front of actor Suriya will melt you in tears\\".Vaadu Veedu Telugu Movie Review. IndiaGlitz (17 June 2011). Retrieved 24 June 2012. Vishal played the role of a police officer in his following release Vedi (2011), directed by Prabhu Deva, which was declared an instant flop at the box office. =2013‚Äìpresent= In the 2013 film Samar, Vishal played a forest trek guide. Behindwoods stated that he \\"rocks in the action sequences\\". He appeared in three more films that year. Following a cameo role in Theeya Velai Seiyyanum Kumaru, he starred in the action films Pattathu Yaanai and Pandiya Naadu. The latter was Vishal's debut production venture.Top 10 Tamil grossers of 2013 ‚Äì The Times of India. The Times of India. Retrieved 17 September 2015.2013 ‚Äì The top 10 Tamil grossers. Sify.com (2 January 2014). Retrieved 17 September 2015. Vishal opted to produce and collaborate with Thiru for a third venture Naan Sigappu Manithan (2014), a revenge drama, in which his character had narcolepsy. To prepare for the lead role, Vishal read up and studied real life case studies of people with the disorder, citing that there were no references from cinema which he could watch and learn. Then he had acted under director Hari for the second time in Poojai (2014), which did somewhat good business at the box office. In 2015, he acted two films, namely, Aambala is a hit. Paayum Puli, turned out to be flop at the box office. In 2016, he did three movies; Kathakali, Marudhu and Kaththi Sandai. The first two were average grossers, while Kaththi Sandai became a flop at the box office. In January 2017, Vishal signed his debut Malayalam film, as the main antagonist in the Mohanlal-starer Villain, directed by B. Unnikrishnan. In September 2017, Vishal played a detective in Thupparivaalan directed by Mysskin which was loosely based on the British writer Arthur Conan Doyle's detective character, Sherlock Holmes. The film was a commercial success and was appreciated by audiences and critics. In 2018, Vishal had two major releases. The first one was Irumbu Thirai directed by newcomer P.S. Mithran which released in May 2018 And second was Sandakozhi 2 released in October 2018 was written and directed by N. Linguswamy.

Apart from this, Vishal is also a staunch advocate against online piracy since 2014, having started an anti-piracy cell. = Television = He made his television d√©but in October 2018 as a host of Sun Naam Oruvar, a talk show airing on Sun TV. Politics Vishal filed his nomination as an independent candidate for the by-poll to the high-profile RK Nagar constituency in Chennai, which fell vacant following Jayalalithaa's death in December 2017.

Taxonomy Three species - Hypostomus aurantiacus, H. nigricans and H. vicinus - were described by Fran√ßois Louis de la Porte, comte de Castelnau in 1855. Parancistrus was described by Pieter Bleeker in 1862 and P. aurantiacus designated as type. Later, P. nigricans and P. vicinus were deemed to be synonyms of P. aurantiacus, making P. aurantiacus the only species of Parancistrus until P. nudiventris was described in 2005. Species There are currently two recognized species in this genus: * Parancistrus aurantiacus (Castelnau, 1855) * Parancistrus nudiventris Rapp Py-Daniel & Zuanon, 2005 Appearance and anatomy Parancistrus is unique among loricariids due to the presence of fleshy folds on the naked area around the dorsal fin and at the pectoral fin points insertion in the breeding males. Breeding males also have elongated odontodes on their bodies and pectoral fin spines. Parancistrus have stout bodies that are completely plated in adults. The dorsal fin membrane connects to the adipose fin spine. Their color is typically slate gray to black, occasionally with white streaks. They have large gill openings, which makes the genus different from all other loricariids except some Pogonopoma and Rhinelepis.

A descendant of an old rabbinical family, he was destined from his childhood for the rabbinate, and was educated first by his grandfather at Worms, and later by his uncle, Joseph David Sinzheim, subsequently president of the Central Consistory at Paris. Under the latter's direction, Auerbach acquired not only extensive Talmudic knowledge, but a secular education as well. When, owing to the efforts of Herz Cerfbeer of Medelsheim, a Jewish community had been formed at Strasbourg, Auerbach was charged with its administration. At the outbreak of the Reign of Terror in France, Auerbach, on account of his connection with Cerfberr (who as former contractor to the royal army was suspected by the revolutionists), was thrown into prison where he remained for a year. On leaving Strasbourg he was appointed rabbi at Forbach, then at Neuwied, and in 1809 at Bonn. In 1837 he resigned the position, ostensibly on account of his great age, but really to have his son succeed him in his place. Auerbach was the author of several liturgical poems and prayers, and of a poem on the abolition of the poll tax, entitled Dibre ha-Mekes we-Be·π≠uloh (History of the Tax and its Abolition), still extant in manuscript. The poem was dedicated to Cerfberr, who by his intervention brought about the abolition. A specimen of the poem was given by Samuel Joseph Fuenn, who was the possessor of the manuscript. Auerbach left seven sons, among whom the best known was Benjamin Hirsch Auerbach, rabbi at Darmstadt and Halberstadt.

Only the 1641 creation is extant. Chichester baronets, of Raleigh (1641) The Chichester Baronetcy, of Raleigh in the County of Devon, was created in the Baronetage of England on 4 August 1641 for John Chichester (1623‚Äì1667). =1st Baronet= John Chichester (1623‚Äì1667) was MP for Barnstaple, Devon. Raleigh was a manor held by the Chichester family in the parish of Pilton, near Barnstaple. He was the son of Sir Robert Chichester, knight, (1579‚Äì1627) of Raleigh (whose monument with effigies exists in Pilton Church) by his second wife Ursula Hill. Sir Robert was the son of Sir John Chichester by his wife Ann Denys, daughter of Sir Robert Denys (d.1592), MP, of Holcombe Burnell, Devon. Sir John was the eldest surviving sonThe inscription on the monument of Sir Robert Chichester states clearly that he was the son of Sir John Chichester by Anne Dennis and died in 1627 aged 48, giving a date of birth of 1579. His father Sir John must have been at least 18 on his son's birth, giving him a birth date of c. 1559, making him therefore older than his two eminent peer brothers, Arthur born in 1563 and Edward born in 1568. The fact that he inherited, apparently due to primogeniture, the principal paternal manor of Raleigh, in the parish church of which at Pilton his father was buried and has an elaborate monument, also seems to confirm that he was the eldest son. He appears to have had a brother also named John, who was Governor of Carrickfergus, beheaded by Irish rebels in 1597, unless the two brothers John are in fact the same person of Sir John Chichester (d.1569), knight, of Raleigh, whose elaborate monument (without effigy) exists in Pilton Church, who was also father of Arthur Chichester, 1st Baron Chichester of Belfast (1563-1624/5), and of Edward Chichester, 1st Viscount Chichester (1568‚Äì1648), of Eggesford, Devon, ancestor of the Marquesses of Donegall (see this title for more information on this branch of the family). =Succession= Rear-Admiral Sir Edward Chichester, 9th Baronet (1849-1906) The first Baronet's eldest son, John Chichester, the second Baronet, died childless at an early age and was succeeded by his younger brother, Arthur Chichester, the third Baronet. He too represented Barnstaple in the House of Commons. On his death in 1718 the title passed to his son, John, the fourth Baronet. He too sat as MP for Barnstaple. His son, John, the fifth Baronet, and his son, John, the sixth Baronet, both served as High Sheriff of Devon (from 1753 to 1754 and from 1788 to 1789 respectively). The latter died unmarried in 1808 and was succeeded by his first cousin once removed, Arthur, the seventh Baronet whose seat was Youlston Park, Shirwell, Devon. He was the grandson of Reverend William Chichester, younger son of the fourth Baronet. He was High Sheriff of Devon between 1816 and 1817. His son, Arthur, the eighth Baronet, was a Deputy Lieutenant and Justice of the Peace for Devon. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Edward, the ninth Baronet. He was a Rear-Admiral in the Royal Navy, Naval Aide-de-Camp to Queen Victoria and King Edward VII and Admiral Superintendent of the Naval Establishment in Gibraltar. As of 2008 the title is held by his great-grandson (the baronetcy having descended from father to son), James, the twelfth Baronet, who succeeded in 2007. The aviator and world-circumnavigating sailor Sir Francis Chichester was the son of Reverend Charles Chichester, seventh son of the eighth Baronet. *Sir John Chichester, 1st Baronet (23 April 1623 ‚Äì 2 November 1667) *Sir John Chichester, 2nd Baronet (c. 1658-16 September 1680) (son) *Sir Arthur Chichester, 3rd Baronet (c. 1662-3 February 1718) (brother) *Sir John Chichester, 4th Baronet (2 June 1689 ‚Äì 2 September 1740) (son) *Sir John Chichester, 5th Baronet (26 March 1721 ‚Äì 18 December 1784) (son) *Sir John Chichester, 6th Baronet (c. 1752-30 September 1808) (son) *Sir Arthur Chichester, 7th Baronet (25 April 1790 ‚Äì 30 May 1842) (cousin) *Sir Arthur Chichester, 8th Baronet (4 October 1822 ‚Äì 13 July 1898) (son) *Rear-Admiral Sir Edward Chichester, 9th Baronet (20 November 1849 ‚Äì 17 September 1906) (son)Wikisource:Devonshire Characters and Strange Events/Rear-Admiral Sir Edward Chichester, Bart. *Sir Edward George Chichester, 10th Baronet (22 January 1888 ‚Äì 26 September 1940) (son), Commander, Royal Navy Naval Brigade.

It is part of the Ciske trilogy which was written between 1941 (publication was however delayed by paper shortages until 1942) and 1946. The book was published in more than ten countries. It was made into two films, a television series and a musical. Best known is the film version of 1984, starring Danny de Munk as Ciske, Herman van Veen and Willeke van Ammelrooy.  Plot summary The setting is in Amsterdam in the 1930s. The story is told by Ciske‚Äôs new teacher Bruis. Ciske de Rat (\\"Ciske the Rat\\") is the story of eleven-year-old lonely street child Ciske (Franciskus) Vrijmoeth, who has no friends and is only called \\"the Rat\\". Ciske has to change school, because he poured ink over his teacher's head. After school, he helps out in a pub, where his mother Marie also works. His beloved father Cor is a sailor and therefore not at home. Ciske groeit op (\\"Ciske grows up\\") is the second part. Ciske meets his father, who wants to get divorced. At school he makes friends with a sick boy called Dorus. One night, Ciske finds his mother with another man, who beats him. As his mother tears out pages from a book which was borrowed from Dorus, Ciske gets angry and kills his mother with a knife. He is then arrested and put into jail. His teacher helps him out, and after Ciske saves a drowning boy's life, he is declared a hero and lives together with his father and aunt Jans. In the third part, Cis de man (\\"Cis the man\\"), Ciske is now an adult soldier and fights against the German soldiers in May 1940, when the Germans invaded the Netherlands. His former teacher Bruis, who tells this story as well, happens to be his sergeant. Cis actually has more authority than Bruis. In the end, Cis gets seriously injured. This part of the book was published in 1946 after the Dutch liberation and is not included in the films.  Films  = 1955 = The first film was issued in 1955, starring Dick Van der Velde as Ciske and Kees Brusse as the teacher Bruis. The black-and-white film, which was directed by Wolfgang Staudte, won an OCIC Award and a Silver Lion at the Venice Film Festival. Based on admissions, it is still the third most popular Dutch film in Dutch box office history. = 1984 = The second film was directed by Guido Pieters and filmed by Frans Bromet. Ciske is played by Danny de Munk who also sang the title song Ik voel me zo verdomd alleen (\\"I feel so damned alone\\") which scored a number one hit in the Netherlands. An enhanced television series was later broadcast. Both films are still in the Top fifteen most-successful films in The Netherlands since 1945.  Soundtrack  The 1984 soundtrack features two songs from the film: Ik voel me zo verdomd alleen (composed by Herman van Veen, lyrics by Karin Loomans) and Vergeet nu maar je zorgen (\\"Now forget your worries\\"), which is played at the closing credits.  Musical  From October 5, 2007 to November 29, 2009, a musical based on the full trilogy toured the Netherlands and Belgium, starring 37-year-old Danny de Munk (who had gone on to appear in several Dutch musicals in the years after his portrayal of young Ciske in the movie) as grown-up Ciske. The musical was based on the 1984 film but added part of the storyline of the third book, switching back and forth between flashbacks to the events occurring in the 1930s and the days before the German invasion of the Netherlands in 1940. The show featured music by Henny Vrienten and lyrics by Andr√© Breedland. Paul Eenens directed the production. Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands was present at the gala premiere at the Royal Theater Carr√© in Amsterdam. The show received very positive reviews and seven Dutch musical awards (in 2008 the most awards ever bestowed on a single production). A CD and DVD were released of this stage production. The musical was staged again in 2016/2017, in a slightly modified version, once more directed by Paul Eenens and starring Danny de Munk. It won, among others, the 2017 Dutch Musical Award for Best Dutch Musical.

The existing text of the Acharanga Sutra which is used by the Svetambara sect of Jainism was recompiled and edited by KshamaShraman Devardhigani, who headed the council held at Valabhi c. 454 CE. The Digambaras do not recognize the available text, and regard the original text as having been lost in its original form. The Digambara text, Mulachara is said to be derived from the original Acharanga and discusses the conduct of a Digambara monk. Introduction The Acharanga Sutra is the oldest agam, from a linguistic point of view, written in Ardhamagadhi Prakrit. The Sutra contains two books, or Srutaskandhas. The first book is the older part, to which other treatises were later added. It describes the conduct and behavior of ascetic life: the mode of asking for food, bowl, clothes, conduct while walking and speaking and regulation of possessions by ascetics. It also describes the penance of Mahavira, the Great Hero. The second book is divided into four sections called Kulas. There were originally five K√ªl√¢s, but the fifth, the Nis√Æhiyagghana, is now reckoned as a separate work. The first and second parts lay down rules for conduct of ascetics. The ƒÄcƒÅrƒÅ·πÖga has been described in details in SamavƒÅyƒÅ·πÖga and the Nand·øë. According to them, the main studies of the ƒÄcƒÅrƒÅ·πÖga are 'ƒÄcƒÅra gocara' i.e. code of conduct, vinaya (humility), vainƒÅyika (fruition of humility), sthƒÅna (difference postures), gamana (travelling), cankrama·πáa (movements), bhojana-mƒÅtra (quantity of food intake), svƒÅdhyƒÅya (spiritual studies), bhƒÅ·π£ƒÅ samiti (principles of speech), gupti (restraint or of mind, speech and body), sayyƒÅ (place of stay), upƒÅdh·øë (belongings) etc. The ƒÄcƒÅrƒÅ·πÖga recommends purity of all these aspects. Acharya UmƒÅsvati has briefly dealt with the subject matter of the nine chapters of the ƒÄcƒÅrƒÅ·πÖga. They are: #·π¢a·∏çj·øëvanikƒÅya yatanƒÅ ‚Äì self-restraint in respect of the six kinds of living beings. #Abandoning of ego over worldly things. #Conquest over trials and tribulations of life. #Unshakable perception about righteousness. #Detachment towards worldly affairs. #The process to decay or destroy the karmas. #Service towards elders. #Penance and austerities. #Renunciation of attachment to sexual objects Acharanga sutra quotes:Surendra Bothra, Ahimsa ‚Äì the science of peace Monasticism Acharanga Sutra describes lack of clothes as being in full conformity of with Jain doctrine (AS 1.6.2.3). Another passage in the Acharanga refers to the difficulties experienced by naked monk and also to the fact that he does not need to beg for and repair clothes (AS 1.6.3.1‚Äì2).

It is located in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles. Background Holy Family Girls High School, a college-preparatory school, opened its doors to 21 freshmen in September 1937. For three years classes were held on the top floor of the grade school and were conducted by the Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, with Sister Mary St. Bertha, B.V.M., as principal until 1943. Members of the charter class recall that the chemistry lab was a former piano lesson room, that the first issue of the school paper was published under the most adverse conditions, and that only high school girls could use the front stairs. In 1940, because of the growing enrollment, Msgr. Galvin purchased the old Knights of Columbus Hall on Lomita Avenue and converted it into a four-year high school. There were seventeen members in the charter graduating class of 1941, and, as enrollment continued to grow, so did the very special spirit that has characterized Holy Family High from its earliest years. In 1951 Msgr. Galvin purchased two more lots adjacent to the high school on the east for the construction of the present building. Under the principalship of S. Mary George Francis, B.V.M., the Class of 1952 was the first class to graduate from the new building. Msgr. Galvin continued as chief administrator until 1972. In 1974, during the administration of Sister Ann Eileen Clancy, B.V.M., Msgr. Arthur J. Lirette became pastor. He showed a constant personal interest in all the activities of the school, academic, religious, and social. During the ensuing fifteen years, the chief building project was the retrofitting of the parish church and the parish elementary school, both of which had suffered damage in the earthquakes of 1971 and 1987, whereas the high school building had stood firm. Msgr. Lirette retired in 1996 during the principalship of Ms Jacqueline Kresal, who had assumed duties as the first lay principal in 1987. Holy Family High School has been served by seven B.V.M. principals since its founding in 1937, and is now led by its seventh lay-person, Dr. Joe Reiken, as Head of School (2017‚ÄìPresent). Today Holy Family High School is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC), earning a full-term (6-year) accreditation at the last self-study (March 2012). The high school has also been voted ‚ÄúBest Private School‚Äù in Glendale from 1999 - 2010. On January 27, 2010, it was recognized as one of the top 50 schools in the United States, and one of the top three in the state of California, by the Catholic High School Honor Roll for ‚Äúcontributing in extraordinary ways to the moral and intellectual formation of young people.‚Äù See also * Holy Family Catholic Church (Glendale, California) References External links  Category:Roman Catholic secondary schools in Los Angeles County, California Category:Educational institutions established in 1937 Category:Girls' schools in California Category:High schools in the San Fernando Valley Category:Education in Glendale, California Category:Buildings and structures in Glendale, California Category:Catholic secondary schools in California ","title":"Holy Family High School (Glendale, California)"},{"id":"11541353","text":"Samson Cerfberr of Medelsheim (born at Strasburg about 1780; committed suicide at Paris, 1826) was a French soldier and author.

It is visible in binoculars or a telescope but is too faint to be seen with the naked eye, having an apparent visual magnitude of 7.51. The system is drifting closer to the Sun with a radial velocity of ‚àí9 km/s. Two extrasolar planets have been confirmed to orbit the primary. Properties The primary, component A, is a G-type main- sequence star with a stellar classification of G9VCN+1. The suffix notation indicates an overabundance of the cyano radical in the spectrum. Houk and Swift (1999) found a class of G8IV, suggesting it is instead a more evolved subgiant star. It is around seven billion years old and is spinning slowly with a projected rotational velocity of 1.5 km/s. The star has 1.1 times the mass of the Sun and 2.2 times the Sun's radius. It is radiating 2.9 times the luminosity of the Sun from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 5,321 K. A wide binary companion star was discovered in 2000. This secondary, designated component B, has a visual magnitude of 11.11 and lies at an angular separation of along a position angle of 134¬∞, as of 2015. It is a red dwarf with a class of M0V, and has just 0.6 times the Sun's radius. It is radiating 0.085 times the Sun's luminosity at an effective temperature of 4,033 K.  Planetary system  In August 2005, two planets were discovered orbiting the star, the innermost like Neptune and another like Jupiter orbiting at 3.34 AU. However, the second planet (HD 11964 b) was not confirmed until May 2007. In September 2007, P.C. Gregory claimed that there was a third planet in the system on the basis of Bayesian analysis of the radial velocity data. The planet was claimed to have a mass similar to that of Saturn and located in a 360-day orbit. Gregory cautioned that the close match between the period of this planet to being exactly a year meant that the radial velocity variations may have been caused by insufficient correction for the motion of the Earth in orbit around the Sun. The planet was not detected in re-reduced data in an analysis published in the Astrophysical Journal in 2009.

Werner Erhard and his courses have been referenced in popular culture in various forms of fictional media including literature, film, television and theatre. The original course, known as est, was delivered by the company Erhard Seminars Training (EST, or est). Under the name The Forum, they were delivered by Werner Erhard and Associates. Also, the Landmark Forum, a program created by Erhard's former employees after purchasing his intellectual property, has had an influence on popular culture. Some of these works have taken a comedic tack, parodying Erhard and satirizing the methodology used in these courses. Both est and The Forum have been depicted more often in film and television than in literary works. The 1977 film Semi- Tough satirized Erhard and the est Training, through the fictional \\"Bismark Earthwalk Action Training,\\" in which Bert Convy portrayed a character said to have been a parody of Erhard. Diana Ross and Joel Schumacher, who had both taken the est training, incorporated Werner Erhard's teachings into the 1978 musical film, The Wiz. The 1990 film The Spirit of '76 also parodied est, with Rob Reiner portraying a trainer for the est-like \\"Be, Inc. Seminars.\\" Movie critics have also drawn parallels to est and Werner Erhard, in reviews of the films Fight Club and Magnolia. Concepts from the Landmark Forum were utilized by The Wachowskis in their film The Matrix Revolutions. Werner Erhard's training programs have been parodied in television. The 1979 episode of Mork & Mindy, \\"Mork Goes Erk\\", and the 2002 episode of Six Feet Under, \\"The Plan\\", are the most notable. In the Mork & Mindy episode, the Erhard parody character was played by David Letterman. Madison, Wisconsin's Broom Street Theater produced a play about Werner Erhard and The Forum in 1995, called Devil In Paradise, The Fall and Rise of Werner Erhard. This piece presented a fictionalized version of controversial issues surrounding Erhard. The third and fourth season of the FX series \\"The Americans\\" contains a story line in which several recurring characters attend the EST training in or near Washington, DC. In a recreation of the est Training the lead character and Russian spy, Phillip, begins to confront his past and to question his purpose. Background The est Training was a two-weekend, 60-hour course offered from late 1971 to late 1984. The purpose of the seminar was \\"to transform one's ability to experience living so that the situations one had been trying to change or had been putting up with, clear up just in the process of life itself.\\"Getting it ‚Äì the psychology of est, by Dr. Sheridan Fenwick, p.44 It \\"brought to the forefront the ideas of transformation, personal responsibility, accountability, and possibility.\\" Music John Denver wrote the song \\"Looking for Space\\" which was dedicated to Erhard, and became a theme song for EST.  Fiction  = est and successors in literature = Depictions of est and The Forum in literature have dealt with direct references to these trainings, through such books as 60 Hours that Transform Your Life, by Adelaide Bry; Getting It: The Psychology of est, by Sheridan Fenwick, est: Making Life Work, by Robert Hargrove; The est Experience by James Kettle; and The Book of est by Luke Rhinehart. est was parodied in the March 1980 issue of the Marvel Comics Howard the Duck series, titled: \\"The Dreadcliff Cuckoos\\". In \\"The Dreadcliff Cuckoos\\", the character \\"Werner Blowhard\\" heads the organization \\"Bozoes Eagerly Serving Tyrants\\", abbreviated B.E.S.T. In his first appearance in the comic, Blowhard states \\"I've got It, Have you got It?\\". The \\"Werner Blowhard\\" character was later referenced in D. Keith Mano's 1982 novel, Take Five. In Pressure Points, a 2001 novel by Larry Brooks, one of the book's protagonists asserts that the programs developed by Werner Erhard, William Penn Patrick, and Alexander Everett all came from the same source. The Program, a 2004 novel by Hurwitz, quotes Erhard prior to the opening of the prologue.  Film  = 1970s = est advocate Valerie Harper contacted Bert Convy on behalf of Werner Erhard during the filming of Semi- Tough. Werner Erhard and his est Training programs and later The Forum have been parodied in films, both directly and through more subtle references. Still in other films that did not directly intend to parody the subject matter, other reviewers have found elements of the est movement as applied to the genre of fictional self-help films. The 1977 movie Semi-Tough, starring Burt Reynolds, parodied the est training. Bert Convy played \\"Friedrich Bismark,\\" a caricature of Werner Erhard. Bismark's organization and its training went by the name \\"B.E.A.T.\\", which stands for: \\"Bismark Earthwalk Action Training.\\" In real life, Erhard had a Mercedes Benz with a llicense plate that said \\"SO WHUT\\", in the film, Bismark rode in a limousine that said: \\"BEAT IT\\". A form of Rolfing was also parodied in the film, and Lotte Lenya's character \\"Clara Pelf\\", called PELFING\\", was described as: \\"a Rolf like masseuse.\\" The press caught on to this satire of Erhard in the film, and gave these sections of the film positive reviews. The Wall Street Journal did not give an overall positive review, but did appreciate the portions where Werner Erhard was parodied: \\"The movie isn't much - an erratic ramble - But it has some pleasant moments, and a delicious send-up of The self-improvement guru Werner Erhard.\\" The Charlotte Observer praised Bert Convy's portrayal of the self-help guru Frederick Bismark, writing: \\"Bert Convy is a hilariously smug consciousness-raiser with a more than passing resemblance to EST's Werner Erhard.\\" After the film's release, Bert Convy appeared on The Tonight Show and discussed his experiences when he attended an est training seminar in preparation for his role as Frederick Bismark. During actual filming on Semi- Tough, Convy received a late-night phone call from actress Valerie Harper, known in Hollywood as a devoted student of Werner Erhard. She related to Convy that Erhard was \\"pleased\\" with the role, and she wished him success in the film. However, Convy suspected that her real reason for calling was to subtly pressure him to go easy on his parody of Erhard in the film. However, several EST graduates shunned the film for making fun of the training, its methods, its philosophy, as well as Werner Erhard, himself. est student Diana Ross worked some of Werner Erhard's teachings into the film version of The Wiz. The Grove Book of Hollywood wrote that the 1978 film, The Wiz was influenced by Werner Erhard's teachings and est because actress Diana Ross and writer Joel Schumacher were \\"very enamored of Werner Erhard.\\" The film's producer Rob Cohen noted that: \\"before I knew it, the movie was becoming an est-ian fable full of est buzzwords about knowing who you are and sharing and all that. I hated the script a lot. But it was hard to argue with Diana because she was recognizing in this script all of this stuff that she had worked out in est seminars.\\" Schumacher spoke positively of the results of the est training, saying: \\"I will be eternally grateful for learning that I was responsible for my life.\\" Of est and Erhard references in the film itself, The Grove Book of Hollywood notes that the speech delivered by the Good Witch, played by actress Lena Horne, at the end of the film was \\"a litany of est-like platitudes,\\" and the book also makes est comparisons to the song \\"Believe in Yourself.\\" In the 1979 film Manhattan, Woody Allen's character Isaac Davis says of his first wife, \\"She was a kindergarten teacher, then she got into drugs and moved to San Francisco. She went to est, became a Moonie. She works for the William Morris Agency now.\\". = 1980s = Circle of Power, also known as Mystique, Brainwash and The Naked Weekend, is a 1981 film, co-produced by Gary Mehlman, Anthony Quinn and Jeffrey White, and based on the non-fiction book The Pit: A Group Encounter Defiled. It stars Yvette Mimieux in her final film performance. = 1990s = Rob Reiner portrayed \\"Dr. Cash\\", a parody of Werner Erhard, in the 1990 film The Spirit of '76. In the 1990 film The Spirit of '76, Rob Reiner plays \\"Dr. Hedley Cash\\" (referred to only as \\"Dr. Cash\\" in the film), an abusive trainer for the est-like \\"Be, Inc. Seminars\\" who traps time- traveler Heinz-57 (played by Geoff Hoyle) in one of his seminars and continually refers to him as \\"Heinz Asshole\\". In the DVD commentary for the 2003 release of the film, director Lucas Reiner stated that the \\"Absentee, oblivious, self-involved parents who don't notice their kids have a spaceship\\" was a reference to the self-involved nature of adults during the 1970s and their propensity for self-improvement. Reiner stated that these scenes were meant to symbolize the \\"'70s hunger for self-improvement\\" and the extreme ends that people would go to in order to improve themselves. Lucas Reiner had never personally attended one of Werner Erhard's seminars, but had heard that attendants were not allowed to leave, often peed in their pants, and were called \\"assholes\\" and insulted publicly. Reiner noted that once his brother Carl put on the \\"Dr. Cash\\" costume, he played his character perfectly. Heavyweights, a 1995 comedy film, portrays a fat camp for kids that is taken over by fitness guru Tony Perkis, played by Ben Stiller. In a review of the film in The Washington Post, Hal Hinson compared Stiller's portrayal of the Perkis character to Erhard, and called him \\"the Werner Erhard of slide aerobics\\". Fight Club author Chuck Palahniuk's work was influenced by his experiences in the Landmark Forum. Fight Club author Chuck Palahniuk was a graduate of The Landmark Forum, or \\"The Forum\\" for short, and this later influenced his work. In his review of the 1999 film adaptation of the book, Roger Ebert likened the character Tyler Durden to Werner Erhard. Ebert wrote that Tyler Durden was: \\".a bullyWerner Erhard plus S & M, a leather club operator without the decor.\\" Fight Club film producer Ross Grayson Bell believes that his \\"creative synchronicity\\" with writer Palahniuk was due to their shared experience of attending The Forum. In the 1999 film Magnolia, Tom Cruise played a motivational guru named Frank T.J. Mackey, who was the author of a self-help book called Seduce and Destroy. This work was meant to teach men how to get women to sleep with them. The Frank T.J. Mackey character in the film has been likened to: \\"a sort of pop-TV blend of Werner Erhard and Bob Guccione, strutting around a stage with cocksure arrogance, indoctrinating his acolytes in the arts of machismo and seduction\\". The Frank T.J. Mackey character has also been compared to another motivational trainer influenced by Erhard, in Details Magazine. = 2000‚Äìpresent = The Wachowskis drew on their experiences in the Landmark Forum seminar series when they wrote The Matrix Revolutions. In her 2004 book Life Long Learning: Transforming, Learning Discovering Through Living Life in Unlimitless Possibilities, Lady Nenari Anne Diamond writes that filmmakers The Wachowskis got the inspiration for the screenplay to The Matrix Revolutions while participating in a Landmark Forum \\"seminar series.\\" Diamond also analyzes The Matrix Revolutions and the messages imparted in the film, in the context of her own personal experiences in the Landmark Forum. She describes a tautologous exchange between Agent Smith and Neo in the film, where Neo is asked by Smith: \\"Why do you continue to do this, Mr. Anderson?\\" and Neo responds: \\"Because I choose to.\\" Diamond uses this example to explain the Landmark Forum's discussion of \\"choice and decision.\\" Diamond provides further analysis of other Landmark Forum concepts utilized in The Matrix Revolutions in her book Stepping Into Spiritual Oneness: Spiritual Rememberings of the Soul Through Life Experience, including the concept that: \\"we all choose to BE who we are being in each and every moment of our experience.\\"  Television  = Mork & Mindy = David Letterman portrayed a parody of Werner Erhard in an episode of Mork & Mindy called \\"Mork Goes Erk.\\" Parody and satire of est and The Forum in television has taken a more direct approach than in literature and film. Characters have been shown attending seminars, and having negative outcomes as a result. Mork & Mindy dealt with this in a lighter fashion, dealing with a small introduction of individuals to the training in a home environment, in season one, episode seventeen: \\"Mork Goes Erk.\\" In the episode, David Letterman portrayed an Erhard-like character by the name of \\"Ellsworth\\" offering ERK or Ellsworth Revitalization Konditioning. In a 1982 article in the journal Theory & Society, Lewis & Clark College sociology professor Robert Goldman compared and contrasted Letterman's \\"Ellsworth\\" character and his training program to that of Werner Erhard. Goldman noted that the episode spent time: \\"lampooning Werner Erhard and est-like commercial pop psychologies.\\" However, Goldman went on to note that the inherent problem with \\"Ellsworth Revitalization Konditioning\\" was not the training - but Ellsworth himself. Ellsworth is seen not just as a parody of Werner Erhard, but also of consumerism: \\"As the self- help entrepreneur, Ellsworth is portrayed as a walking collection of lifestyle-status points and sign-values (\\"I've got my Rolls-Royce!\\"). Conspicuous consumption and commodity fetishism define his personality.\\" Goldman explained that the Mork and Mindy episode succeeded in distinguishing between criticism of the Ellsworth training, and criticism of Ellsworth, citing Ellsworth's character traits of: \\"tyranny, selfishness, open greed, and flaunting of the accoutrements of his vulgar money-making.\\" In the end of the segment of the episode parodying est, Mork wins out over the Ellsworth philosophy by instead calling to mind universal humanistic moral values. David Letterman received positive praise for his portrayal of \\"Ellsworth\\" in the episode. = Six Feet Under = Alice Krige portrayed a seminar leader of \\"The Plan\\" (a parody on \\"The Forum\\") in the 2002 Six Feet Under episode, \\"The Plan\\". Six Feet Under Episode 16, of Season 2, \\"The Plan\\", featured a seminar- delivery organization called \\"The Plan\\", which the character Claire Fisher immediately compared to est. Actress Alice Krige portrays \\"Alma\\" the seminar leader of \\"The Plan\\" - who uses jargon related to the \\"blueprint\\" for building a house in order to convey concepts about self-improvement. She singles out the character Ruth and berates her for \\"tiptoeing around her own house like she's afraid of waking someone up.\\" Ruth begins to use jargon from the course in her conversations with family, and complains to her daughter that she cannot yet go to sleep after coming home from her seminar because she must first do \\"homework\\" from the course. This homework includes writing a letter to her dead mother forgiving her for \\"all the terrible things she did to me\\", and writing a letter to herself, describing how she will \\"renovate\\" her life. During the following day of \\"The Plan\\", the seminar leader gives the group a new assignment: to go outside to ready banks of phones, and call their family members to inform them of specifically how they wish to \\"renovate their homes\\" together. In the seminar, the leader asks everyone to close their eyes and imagine that everyone else is laughing at them for being stupid, and then asks the participants if they get the joke. Everyone does, except Ruth, who rants at the course instructor. After her rant, the leader congratulates her for \\"knocking down her old house\\", and proceeds to tell her that now she can rebuild a new house. Analysis in secondary sources and books on Six Feet Under have compared the training in \\"The Plan\\" to the current incarnation of Erhard's trainings, Landmark Education. Reading Six Feet Under: TV to Die For by Akass et al. have compared \\"The Plan\\" to est and The Forum. Akass cites the episode while analyzing the phenomenon of self-improvement, and notes that: \\"Repairing her shingles often leaves Ruth in shackles.\\" She writes that: \\"the series performs the logic of self-help, both its silly and seductive sides.\\" However, she also points out that Ruth's rant at the end of her seminar is cathartic for Ruth, and she ends her analysis of the episode by asking: \\"So, what do we make of our times when all this supposed nonsense actually works?\\"  Theatre  In 2008, Climate Theater in San Francisco, California showed a play called The Group, written by Robert Quillen Camp and performed by Ryan Eggensperger, and inspired, according to Climate \\"by the largely American tradition of packaging and selling self-empowerment, from EST and the Landmark Forum to Norman Vincent Peale and The Secret\\". The play is an immersive performance piece where audience members sit in a circle and wear audio headsets, through which they listen to the charismatic leader's voice and sound effects. The production ran from May 29, 2008 to June 14, 2008. Robert Avila of the San Francisco Bay Guardian called The Group: \\"in-your-face comedy in a droll send-up of EST-like self-actualization programs,\\" and a spoof of \\"recent incarnations\\" including The Secret and Landmark Forum. Avila gave the play a positive review, noting its \\"inspired writing, sharp humor, and simple yet slick production\\". In a review of the play for the San Jose Mercury News, Karen D'Souza wrote: From est to 'The Secret,' this is a playful lampoon of 'healing philosophies'\\". D'Souza also reviewed the play positively, writing: \\" Writer-director Robert Quillen Camp slyly pokes fun at reducing the human experience to one-size-fits-all platitudes and besmirching belief systems with \\"cash-only\\" workshops.\\" Pat Craig wrote in Contra Costa Times: \\"After a lifetime of enduring various human potential programs, from the chanted mantras of transcendental meditation to the institutionalized loathing of est, 'The Group' seems a bit tame for satire to a veteran of the high-profit mind games.\\" In a review for the San Francisco Examiner, Leslie Katz said, \\"In the end, the show provides excellent therapy. As those who aren't swayed by expensive self-help seminars know, laughter is indeed the best medicine.\\" Literature In the 2016 novel Heat and Light, by Jennifer Haigh, the character Kip the Whip attends an EST training seminar led by Werner Erhard.

Calouros are often subject to hazing, which is known as \\"trote\\" (lit. \\"prank\\") there. The first known hazing episode in Brazil happened in 1831 at the Law School of Olinda and resulted in the death of a student. In 1999, a Chinese Brazilian calouro of the University of S√£o Paulo Medicine School named Edison Tsung Chi Hsueh was found dead at the institution's swimming pool; this has since become one of the most well known episodes of violent hazing and has received extensive national media coverage since that year. United Kingdom =England and Wales= Students in their first year of University are known in England and Wales, but also more broadly, often as freshers however first years is more common. The first week of term is widely known as fresher's week where there are usually no classes and students take part in induction events and fairs. Unlike in Scotland, this term is not used in reference to pre-university education, the equivalent terms being Year sevens for the first year of secondary school and first years, lower sixers and Year Twelves used at sixth forms. =Scotland= First year (also known as S1 in Scotland) is the first year of schooling in secondary schools in Scotland and is roughly equivalent to Year 8 (Second Form) in England and Wales and Year 9 (Second Form) in Northern Ireland. Most pupils are 12 or 13 years old at the end of S1. The first year of primary education in Scotland is known as Primary 1 (P1). At the four ancient Scottish universities the traditional names for the four years at university are Bejan (\\"Bejant\\" at the University of St Andrews) (1st), Semi (2nd), Tertian (3rd) and Magistrand (4th), though all Scottish universities will have a \\"freshers' week\\" (as with all British universities) and the term is as widely used with more traditional terms. United States Freshman is commonly in use as a US English idiomatic term to describe a beginner or novice, someone who is naive, a first effort, instance, or a student in the first year of study (generally referring to high school or university study). New members of Congress in their first term are referred to as freshmen senators or freshmen congressmen or congresswomen, no matter how experienced they were in previous government positions. High school first year students are almost exclusively referred to as freshmen, or in some cases by their grade year, 9th graders. Second year students are sophomores, or 10th graders, then juniors or 11th graders, and finally seniors or 12th graders. At college or university, freshman denotes students in their first year of study. The grade designations of high school are not used, but the terms sophomore, junior, and senior are kept at most schools. Some colleges, including historically women's colleges, do not use the term freshman but use first year, instead. Beyond the fourth year, students are simply classified as fifth year, sixth year, etc. Some institutions use the term freshman for specific reporting purposes.

Basketball was soon to latch onto the quickly successful idea, and the idea was discussed by FIBA, during the 1957 FIBA European Championship in Bulgaria. Then FIBA Secretary General William Jones, set up a commission consisting of Borislav Stankoviƒá (Yugoslavia), Raimundo Saporta (Spain), Robert Busnel (France), Miloslav Kriz (Czechoslovakia), and Nikolai Semashko (Soviet Union), to come up with a proposal. The commission invited Europe's national basketball federations to send their national domestic league champions, L'Equipe donated a trophy, and in 1958, the FIBA European Cup For Men's Champion Clubs, or, FIBA European Champions Cup, started. Clubs from Eastern Europe (from the former Soviet bloc) dominated the early years. They not only won the first six editions of the competition (three times Rƒ´gas ASK, twice CSKA Moscow, and once Dinamo Tbilisi), but also managed to reach the finals four times in the first six years (twice Academic, once Dinamo Tbilissi, and Rƒ´gas ASK). 2.18 m (7'2\\") tall Soviet player JƒÅnis Kr≈´mi≈Ü≈°, was the man in the middle for Rƒ´gas ASK's initial three-peat, as he was an unmatched dominant force inside. The '60s, Real Madrid and CSKA Moscow rise In 1961, things began to change. The main Western European basketball club, Real Madrid, started to show signs of ambition, and was eliminated only after the semifinal, by Rƒ´gas ASK. The following two years, the Spanish League champions, Real Madrid, found their way to the final game, but lost both times, versus Dinamo Tbilisi and CSKA Moscow. Eventually, Real won the first of its nine European crowns in 1964, by beating the Czechs of Spartak ZJ≈† Brno. However, that season, the USSR League champions did not participate, because the Soviet Union national team (made up of 90% of the players from CSKA) was preparing for the 1964 Summer Olympic Games. Anyway, this season was a big twist for European basketball, as it marked the beginning of the domination of the \\"wealthy\\" Western European clubs. From then through 1968, Real Madrid and Olimpia Milano, then known for sponsorship reasons as Simmenthal, shared the title of the best European team. Real Madrid could rely on players like Clifford Luyk, the first naturalized American player with such a big role, Emiliano Rodr√≠guez, Miles Aiken, Bob Burgess, and later Wayne Brabender. Meanwhile, Simmenthal, in 1966, was led by a young and smart American forward: Bill Bradley, who would later become an NBA champion with the 1970 and 1973 New York Knicks. Still later, Bradley would become a senator for the state of New Jersey and, finally, a candidate for the United States Presidency. Bradley, who was studying at Oxford, as a Rhodes Scholar, took advantage of his year in Europe, to give decisive help to Milano. In 1969, CSKA Moscow, inspired by the talented Sergei Belov, managed to beat Real Madrid in Barcelona. The young Belov had 19 points that night, but his teammate, big 2.15 m (7'1\\") tall center Vladimir Andreev, exploded for 37 points. The '70s, Varese-Meneghin Dynasty After the Soviet and Madrid dynasties, the '70s were, without any doubt, the decade of Varese. The Italian League champions found a way, year after year, to reach the final game of the competition. Indeed, Varese played the 10 finals in the '70s, winning five of them. Real Madrid, CSKA Moscow, the enthusiastic Bosna, and the up-and-coming Maccabi Elite Tel Aviv, were the other champions of the decade. At the time, Varese was led by the legendary center, Dino Meneghin, whom was surrounded by players such as, one of the best scorers in Italian League history, Bob Morse, Mexican shooter Manuel Raga, Ottorino Flaborea, John Fultz, Ivan Bisson, etc. In 1971, CSKA Moscow won its last European title, until they won it again in the year 2006. They beat Ignis Varese, thanks to Sergei Belov's 24 points. Varese, after a tough win in the championship game against Jugoplastika in 1972, won the championship one more time, against CSKA in 1973. This was despite the play of Sergei Belov. Belov, was once again the dominant scorer, with 36 points in the 1973 championship game. In the 1974 final, Ignis Varese, after almost securing the win, was upset by Real Madrid, on an unbelievable late surge, led by Wayne Brabender and Carmelo Cabrera. In 1977, the Israelis of Maccabi Elite Tel Aviv, whose leaders Jim Boatwright and Miki Berkovich, combined for 43 points against Mobilgirgi Varese, won the first of their six European crowns. A big surprise to the world of European basketball. At last, in 1979, the Yugoslavian League school of basketball began to dazzle Europe. Bosna, led by a young coach (32 years old) named Bogdan Tanjeviƒá, beat Emerson Varese in Grenoble, France. The great performances of its shooters, ≈Ωarko Varajiƒá (45 points), and Mirza Deliba≈°iƒá (30 points), offered its first European crown to Yugoslavia. The '80s, Italian and Yugoslav dominance What could have been the decade of Maccabi Elite Tel Aviv (six finals appearances, but only one win), eventually became a triumph for Italian League basketball (seven finals appearances, and five wins). Italy managed to generate three different European champions (Cant√π, Virtus Roma, and Olimpia Milano) in only seven years. These ten years were also marked by the definitive emergence of the elegant and inspired Yugoslavian League style of basketball. First, Cibona, led by the phenomenal Dra≈æen Petroviƒá, won two times in a row (in 1985 and '86). Then, the up-and-coming Split, won three consecutive titles (in 1989, '90 and '91), revealing the talent of players such as Dino Raƒëa, Toni Kukoƒç, and others, like (Zoran Saviƒá, Zoran Sretenoviƒá, Velimir Perasoviƒá, Du≈°ko Ivanoviƒá, ≈Ωan Tabak, Goran Sobin, Luka Paviƒáeviƒá...). In 1982 and 1983, Cant√π, traditional runner-up to the mighty Varese in the Italian League, won its two European titles, thanks to the young and talented Antonello Riva (16, then 18 points in the finals). The former Varese star, Dino Meneghin, who had joined Olimpia Milano, imported his winning tradition to the Capital of Lombardy, to play in his eleventh European Final (in 1983). But he eventually lost what seemed like a wrestling match, against Wallace Bryant of Ford Cant√π, in one of the most physical and \\"ugliest\\" finals of all time. After Cant√π's back to back wins, Banco di Roma Virtus took over for one year. Its American players, Larry Wright and Clarence Kea, dominated the final, scoring respectively, 27 and 17 points. Then began the reign of Cibona, and the marvelous Dra≈æen Petroviƒá. \\"Little Mozart\\", as Petroviƒá was nicknamed, scored 36 points against Real Madrid in the 1985 championship game, and added 22 against Arvydas Sabonis and ≈Ωalgiris a year later. Italy got back to its back-to-back tradition in 1987, and '88, as Milano, now bearing the sponsorship name of Tracer Milano, beat Maccabi Elite twice. Then, in 1989, the wonderful generation of Jugoplastika (Kukoƒç, Raƒëa, Perasoviƒá, Saviƒá, etc.) took over and dominated European basketball for three years. The '90s, the Greek rise The '90s saw two of the most exciting and controversial endings in the history of the competition, which in 1996, became known as the FIBA EuroLeague, using the name, EuroLeague, for the first time. In 1992, Partizan's young duo of Aleksandar ƒêorƒëeviƒá and Predrag Daniloviƒá, led the underdogs to a title, the fourth consecutive for a Yugoslav League club. Danilovic was named the EuroLeague Final Four MVP, but it was Djordjevic's last second, coast-to-coast three-pointer, which lifted Partizan to a 71‚Äì70 victory against Montigal√† Joventut. The following year saw another underdog take the title, as the French League club Limoges CSP, stunned the Toni Kukoƒç-led club of Benetton Treviso in the final. In 1994, 7up Joventut made up for their last second defeat against Partizan two years earlier. This time, it was the Spanish League club's turn to stage a late rally. Against an Olympiacos team with the regular season's best record, Joventut forward Corny Thompson, hit a three-pointer (his fifth of the entire competition), to put his team up by 2-points, with 19 seconds remaining. Olympiacos had a chance to tie the game at the free throw line, but Yugoslavian national team star ≈Ωarko Paspalj, only made one of two free throws, and \\"La Penya\\" held on for the win. The title stayed in Spain in 1995, but this time with Real Madrid. Arvydas Sabonis, led Real Madrid to victory over Olympiacos in the final, and won the only European club honor that had eluded him, before going to play in the NBA. 1996 proved to be one of the most controversial finals to any European club competition. Greek club Panathinaikos, pulled off the coup of the season, by signing former NBA star Dominique Wilkins, but it was Croatian center Stojko Vrankoviƒá, who decided the outcome of the EuroLeague Final Four. The 2.18 m (7'2\\") tall center, ran the length of the court, to block FC Barcelona's Jose Antonio Montero's lay-up attempt, in the last second, to seal the win for Panathinaikos. Although the block looked like a possible goal-tend, no call was made, and Panathinaikos were the first ever champions from the Greek League. Although this would seem to indicate that a goal tend call should have been made, the situation is less than clear. In fact, numerous violations occurred in the last seconds of the game, none of which were called by the referees. Panathinaikos had possession of the ball, and with 8 seconds remaining on the game clock, Panathinaikos guard Panagiotis Giannakis lost possession of the ball (possibly after being fouled, though no foul call was made). As players from both teams struggled to gain possession of the ball, the shot clock was renewed illegally (since the ball was in possession of neither team, a shot clock violation should have been called against Panathinaikos, meaning that the game clock should have been stopped, and Barcelona should have been given the ball, with an upcoming inbound pass). The situation was further exacerbated, by the fact that the game clock stuck at 4.9 seconds for about 6 seconds, thus allowing Barcelona nearly 10 seconds of play. Olympiacos continued Greek supremacy over the EuroLeague in 1997. After Olympiacos had lost in the final in both 1994 and 1995, their new signing, David Rivers, proved to be the difference in 1997. Rivers averaged 27 points in the two games of the EuroLeague Final Four, and Olympiacos beat FC Barcelona of Aleksandar ƒêorƒëeviƒá and Art≈´ras Karni≈°ovas in the final, to win their first ever EuroLeague title. In the ten years since the EuroLeague Final Four format had been introduced, the club with the best regular season record had never won the title. That changed in 1998, when Kinder Bologna romped through the competition. That year a Greek team, AEK, came second; their coach was Yannis Ioannidis who had reached the Final Four previously with another Greek team, Aris, in 1988, 1989 and 1990.

Controversy In July 2013, it was revealed that St. Lucy's had terminated the employment of a teacher who had married a partner of the same sex, following changes to California's marriage law. Ken Bencomo had taught at the school for 17 years, but had his contract terminated by Assistant Principal Sister Helen Dziuk after a photograph of the marriage appeared in a local newspaper. He was told that making his marriage public violated his contract. Bencomo said that his sexual orientation had been known by St. Lucy's. According to a statement released by the school, St. Lucy's \\"does not discriminate against teachers or other school employees based on their private lifestyle choices, [but] public displays of behavior that are directly contrary to church teachings are inconsistent with these values.\\" The statement added, \\"These values are incorporated into the contractual obligations of each of our instructors and other employees.\\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/gay-catholic-high- school-teacher-firing-spurs-online-petition-article-1.1415621 A public petition was launched by alumnae and the St. Lucy's community calling for Bencomo's reinstatement, which proved unsuccessful.

The band was originally a quartet, Lorenzo Music in 1992, which grew into a 22 member pop orchestra, called the Lorenzo Music Philharmonic. Faced with legal action from the actor of the same name, the name changed it to La Musique Populaire before the release of their debut EP, Auntie Canada in 1996. As part of the American indie pop scene of the 1990s, they are defined by their eclectic sound, like contemporaries Ween and The Magnetic Fields. On their website, LMP lists as their influences: ABBA, The Archies, The Beatles, The Beach Boys, Christopher Cross, Hall and Oates, Rupert Holmes, Haysi Fantayzee, Billy Joel, Rodd Keith, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, Prefab Sprout, The Rock-afire Explosion, Squeeze, Paul Williams, Wham, and Steve Winwood. During this time, the band recorded tracks to various compilation releases and an EP, Omar Sheriff, which, as of 2020, remains unreleased. By 2000, the band moved to Evanston, Illinois, where they started on several projects in a studio they called \\"Eckhouse 2000\\". Their main project was A Century of Song, a six-CD box set chronicling the 20th century through pop music. Other projects included two EPs, The New Body Language and Meeting Up and Making Friends and two albums, What'll We Do At the Zoo and Love Conquers Alda. In 2001, LMP moved to Chicago, where they continued recording in a new studio space, Shiny Vibes. Most of the material eventually were released through Polyholiday Records, with the exception of What'll We Do At the Zoo. Their most famous project, A Century of Song, was considered by LMP as their most ambitious project. As it was about the songs that defined the 20th century, the band covered that ranged from hits, like We Built This City by Starship, to the esoteric, like Aquarius by Boards of Canada. Some songs were covered straightforward, whereas others in different genres. The album received positive reviews, with Greg Adams of AllMusic stating that LMP covered the century \\"with irreverence, humor, and impressively accomplished and inventive arrangements.\\" Douglas Wolk of the Seattle Weekly called it \\"pretty funny\\" remarking that \\"it sounds like everyone's having a great time. \\" As of 2014, Bassler and Haugen continue to record material La Musique Populaire, but none of their material has been released publicly.

Biography =Early life= Leacock was born on July2, 1922, in Weehawken, New Jersey, the second of three daughters. Her mother, Lily Mary Battherham, was a mathematician who taught secondary school and her father was the literary critic and philosopher Kenneth Burke. Leacock was raised between the family's apartment in Greenwich Village, New York and their northern New Jersey 150-acre farm, living half of the year in each place. Living in a social circle that included artists, political radicals and intellectuals prompted into Leacock an ideal \\"to be scornful of materialist consumerism; to value‚Äîeven revere‚Äînature; to hate deeply the injustices of exploitation and racial discrimination‚Ä¶and to be committed to the importance of doing what one could to bring about a socialist transformation of society\\". Leacock attended New York public schools during her childhood until her teenage years, when she got a scholarship to the prestigious private high school Dalton School. Also on scholarship, she started undergraduate courses in anthropology at Radcliffe College in 1939. At Radcliffe, she was introduced by Carleton S. Coon to the neo-evolutionary thought of V. Gordon Childe and C. Daryll Forde. She also became involved in studying Lewis H. Morgan and Karl Marx and in radical student politics. There she also met filmmaker Richard Leacock, whom she married in 1941. After curfew violations, Radcliffe authorities asked her to leave and she transferred to Barnard College in 1942. She studied under Gladys Reichard, graduating from Barnard in 1944 with a bachelor of arts degree in anthropology. =Academic career= After receiving her graduate degree Leacock traveled to Europe with her first husband while he was shooting films on human geography. It is during this time in Paris that she began researching the social changes in the fur trade amount the Montagnais-Naskapi people. In 1951 Leacock received a grant to conduct fieldwork in Labrador, Canada. During this time she brought her one-year-old son with her to Labrador. She used this fieldwork to challenge the idea that private property is universal. She worked at Bank Street College of Education as a senior research associate, from 1958 to 1965, and at Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn in the social sciences department, from 1963 to 1972. She struggled to get a full-time job during the 1950s due to her outspoken political views. She taught as an adjunct for decades before being appointed, in 1972, as a professor and chair of anthropology at City College (CCNY) and graduate faculty of City University of New York Graduate Center. Although highly qualified, Leacock credited her CCNY appointment to the rise of the women's movement and social pressure felt by City College to diversify its faculty. Her appointment coincided with the publication of her celebrated introduction to Friedrich Engels' The Origins of the Family, Private Property and the State. In that introduction, she cited contemporary research to further explicate Engels' theory that \\"the historic defeat of the female sex\\" and subjugation of women began with the stratification of society, the widespread practice of private property, and the emergence of a state. It is not until 1971 that she does her next big fieldwork assignment in Zambia. During this time Zambia had not let many anthropologists into the country because of perceived colonist attitudes. This particular fieldwork aided Leacock in her research of the decolonization efforts in primary school education. One of Leacock's most fruitful contributions to the field of anthropology was her essay entitled \\"Interpreting the Origins of Gender Inequality: Conceptual and Historical Problems\\" (1983), in which she discussed gender inequalities. Leacock's theories mainly concentrated on the intersectionality of race, class, gender, sexuality, and religion. And she refuted the biological determinism as it relates to race, gender, and class. Leacock's work could be reflected in five areas: women's status in egalitarian societies, race, and gender in schools, culture of poverty studies, women's work in development, and the studies of race, class, and gender in Samoa. Arguing the roles of women in the hierarchical society, she claimed that some features of women become exploitable under the patriarchy system. Leacock interpreted the structure of marriage as the structure of exchange and the division of labor. The exploitation of women's labor within the household is the same. Leacock's career involved four major regions: North America, Europe, Africa, and the Pacific. In these areas she studied various topics including the anthropology of education, women cross-culturally, foraging societies, etc. Leacock died of a stroke on April 2, 1987 in Hawaii.

The complete observation of its nine-year orbit rules out any interior planets of minimum mass (m sini) greater than 0.3 Jupiter. The star rotates at an inclination of 50 degrees relative to Earth. It is probable that the planet shares that inclination. It has been called a \\"Jupiter twin\\". The system's habitable zone is centered at .754 AU and is narrower than the Sun's.Square root of stellar luminosity.

The tail feathers are dark and may be white-tipped. It is approximately 10 cm in length. The brown gerygone has a relatively large range. Although total population trends have not been quantified, it is considered of \\"least concern\\" by the IUCN. It may be sighted in coastal rainforest, singly or in small groups of two to four. It feeds on insects. The brown gerygone call is a soft what-is-it. It is not closely related to either true Old World Warblers or the New World Warblers, but belongs rather to the Corvida parvorder comprising many tropical and Australian passerines, as well as crows. The brown gerygone is similar to both the large-billed, G. magnirostris, and mangrove, G. levigaster, gerygones. It differs from the former by having a distinctive white eyebrow and a grey-tinged face. The mangrove gerygone, while having a white eyebrow, lacks the grey face, has more white on the flanks and has a redder eye.

Born in New York City, Benswanger moved with his family to Pittsburgh when he was five years of age. Upon adulthood, he entered his family's insurance business, then served in the United States Army's balloon corps during World War I. He also was an accomplished pianist and musician and served on the board of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra for two decades. Son-in-law of Pirates' owners Benswanger became involved in baseball through his marriage to Eleanor \\"Fanny\\" Dreyfuss, daughter of longtime Pirates owner Barney Dreyfuss. The elder Dreyfuss was grooming his son, Samuel, to succeed him as club president, but Samuel Dreyfuss died suddenly in 1931 from pneumonia at age 35. The following year, Barney Dreyfuss died as well. Dreyfuss' widow, Florence, inherited the team. She successfully prevailed upon Benswanger, her son-in-law, to become president and operating head of the franchise. He would lead the team from 1932 through the 1946 season. During that time, the Pirates boasted a number of star players, including Baseball Hall of Fame members Paul Waner, Lloyd Waner, Pie Traynor, Arky Vaughan and Ralph Kiner. But, apart from four second-place finishes, they resided in the middle- to lower-rung of the National League and were late in developing a farm system, the surest method at the time of attaining sustained success in baseball. On the plus side, Benswanger kept the team going through the Great Depression and brought back all-time great Honus Wagner to serve as a coach. Fought players' union in 1946 Benswanger's last year as president, 1946, was especially tumultuous. Robert Murphy, a Boston labor lawyer, organized the American Baseball Guild, a players' union and predecessor of the Major League Baseball Players Association. Early demands included a minimum salary, standardization of player contracts, and an increase in per-diem expense reimbursements (amending or abolishing the reserve clause was not yet on the table). Murphy targeted the Pirates as the testing ground for signing members of the Guild because of Pittsburgh's reputation as a union stronghold. The majority of the Pirates joined the Guild, with the notable exception of veteran pitcher Rip Sewell. Benswanger, as point man for the Major League owners, would not negotiate with the Guild, and Murphy threatened a strike for the Pirates' June 7 game with the New York Giants. In a pre-game players-only meeting, a majority voted in favor of striking. However, due to Sewell's forceful opposition, the vote fell short of the required two-thirds majority, and the threat evaporated. The failure of the strike vote fatally wounded the Guild; the owners made minor concessions to players, and staved off the effective creation of a union until the MLBPA was formed in 1966.The New York Times, 2012.12.01 At the same time Benswanger was fending off the American Baseball Guild, the Dreyfuss family's 46-year ownership of the team was coming to a close. In August 1946, the Pirates were purchased by an ownership group headed by Indianapolis businessman Frank E. McKinney, and which included entertainer Bing Crosby, Pittsburgh attorney Thomas P. Johnson, and Columbus, Ohio-based real estate magnate John W. Galbreath. Benswanger stepped down as club president upon completion of the sale on August 8, ending 46 years of ownership by the Dreyfuss-Benswanger family. He died in Pittsburgh at age 79. Prior to Branch Rickey's efforts with the Brooklyn Dodgers, Benswanger was one of the few owners and executives who vocally challenged Major League Baseball's color barrier and its major proponent, Commissioner of Baseball Kenesaw Mountain Landis.

Originally designed by freelance illustrator Phillip Boydell for press adverts, the character was widely used by other wartime artists in poster campaigns and political cartoons. It is one of the few propaganda campaigns from World War II to be fully documented from the original concept sketches to the finished adverts.p62, Joseph Darracott and Belinda Loftus, Second World War Posters, HMSO, London, 1972. Creation The first of Boydell's six original Squander Bug sketches, here with its original name of the 'Money Grub'. During the Second World War, the British National Savings Committee became concerned that inflated prices were being paid for scarce consumer goods and believed that the money would be better spent on savings certificates to finance the war.p21, Joseph Darracott and Belinda Loftus, Second World War Posters, HMSO, London, 1972. The Committee felt that a way to ridicule indulgent spending was needed, without being boring or high-handed. To meet this need, Boydell produced a series of six sketches depicting an imp-like creature named the 'Money Grub' that could 'push, pull, scratch, bite and steal'. The concept was accepted almost as it stood, aside from the name being changed. The character was intended as a positive alternative to endless government warnings on what not to do, for example 'Don't waste fuel' or 'Don't waste paper'. Instead, the Squander Bug's speech balloons encouraged shoppers to waste their money on useless purchases, accompanied by captions urging consumers to fight or starve the creature. The character eventually gained swastika tattoos and was even placed in Madame Tussauds wax museum alongside other war enemies such as Hitler and Mussolini.p80, Joseph Darracott, A Cartoon War, Pen & Sword Books Ltd, 1989. Usage Boydell was mainly involved in developing the Squander Bug for press adverts, but the character was also adapted for use in poster campaigns with the same message. British wartime cartoonists such as David Low and Carl Giles also used the character, sometimes ironically. For example, Victor Weisz lampooned Hitler's manpower shortages by giving him his own pair of squander bugs. The character developed an international reputation, and an adapted version was used in Australia, where the Squander Bug was given a Japanese appearance.Australia Under Attack 1942-1943, http://www.awm.gov.au/underattack/mobilise/santa.asp, accessed 1 June 2007 A Squander Bug character was also created by Dr. Seuss to encourage Americans to buy war bonds, although the design was quite different from Boydell's version.University of North Texas Library, https://digital.library.unt.edu/permalink/meta-dc-138, accessed 1 June 2007 References External links * Australia Under Attack 1942-1943 * Women's Magazines at Cyberheritage * People's War Stories at the BBC Category:United Kingdom home front during World War II Category:Economic history of the United Kingdom Category:1940s in Australia Category:Military history of Australia during World War II Category:Propaganda cartoons Category:Fictional insects Category:Fictional demons and devils ","title":"Squander Bug"},{"id":"11541700","text":"right John Tudno Williams (born 31 December 1938) was the Moderator of the Presbyterian Church of Wales 2006-7PCW  Connexion  The Moderator and the Principal of the United Theological College, Aberystwyth from 1998 to 2003.

As a result of the regular travels and teaching of Meltzer and Martha Harris, his third wife, who was head of the Child Psychotherapy Training Course at the Tavistock Clinic, this model of psychoanalytic psychotherapy training became established in the principal Italian cities, in France and Argentina.R. Li Causi and M. Waddell, \\"An appreciation of the work of Donald Meltzer\\" Journal of Child Psychotherapy Vol. 31(1) 3‚Äì5; I. Freeden, obituary, Journal of the British Association of Psychotherapists Vol. 43 (19) 88 Meltzer taught for many years at the Tavistock Clinic, and practised privately in Oxford until his death. Owing to having left the BPS, his ideas remained controversial. He supervised psychoanalytically-oriented professionals in atelier-style groups throughout Europe, Scandinavia and South America, and his visits also included New York and California. Since his death in 2004 his reputation has increasingly regained ground also in his adoptive country. Several international congresses have focussed on his work: in London (1998), Florence (2000), Buenos Aires (2005), Savona (2005), Barcelona (2005) and Stavanger, Norway (2007).See also A. Hahn, \\"Dr Meltzer's Biography\\" =Imago Group= Meltzer was a member of the Kleinian Imago Group founded by the Kleinian aesthete Adrian Stokes for discussing applied psychoanalysis. The group included among others Richard Wollheim, Wilfred Bion, Roger Money-Kyrle, Marion Milner and Ernst Gombrich.http://www.psa- atelier.org/index.php?ul=abc89aac75c4c81dc70221e0b3ea96a0 With Stokes he wrote a dialogue ‚ÄúConcerning the social basis of art‚Äù.In A. Stokes, Painting and the Inner World (1963), reprinted in Meltzer and Harris Williams, The Apprehension of Beauty (Clunie Press, 1988) 206‚Äì7 Meltzer's aesthetic interests, combined with the mother-baby model of early learning processes, led to seeing psychoanalysis itself as an art form.J.

This has had an influence on the philosophical view of the relation between art and psychoanalysis.S. Gosso, Psychoanalysis and art: Kleinian perspectives (Karnac, 2004): N. Glover, Psychoanalytic aesthetics: the British School\\" =Ideas= Some of Meltzer's significant and widely used developments of Kleinian object relations theory are as follows: *The aesthetic conflict, the foundation for normal development, based on the internal mother-baby relationship, was formulated in Meltzer and Harris Williams (1988) The Apprehension of Beauty * Intrusive identification, a form of projective identification associated with life in the Claustrum (narcissistic pathology), first formulated in early seminal papers ‚ÄúThe relation of anal masturbation to projective identification‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe delusion of clarity of insight‚Äù, and expanded in The Claustrum (1992) *Pseudo-maturity, a common clinical manifestation of arrested development * Adhesive identification and dismantling in two-dimensional autistic states, formulated in a work documenting Meltzer's experience with 5 colleagues in treating autistic children, Explorations in Autism (1975) * The preformed transference, first described in The Psychoanalytical Process (1967), referring to the patient's initial preconceptions about a psychoanalytic relationship which have to be overcome before a genuine transference and countertransference can be established *A reappraisal of Melanie Klein‚Äôs discovery of the combined internal object, which stresses its beneficial nature as a basis for mental development, begun in Richard Week-by-Week, Part II of The Kleinian Development (1978).

Accessed 2008-05-13. This list of tornadoes in the state is likely incomplete, as official records date back only to 1950 for tornadoes in the United States. As with most of the northeastern United States, the number of tornadoes peaks in the summer months, normally in July or August. Hartford County has had the most tornadoes in the state, although since 1950 Litchfield County has reported the most tornadoes. Several areas have been struck more than once, and Waterbury has been struck by no less than four tornadoes since 1955. From 1953 to 1991, Connecticut recorded an average of about 1.3 tornadoes per year, ranked 43rd in the United States.Grazulis, p. 18 Although Connecticut tornadoes are typically weak, isolated events can be violent. Three tornadoes of F4 intensity have affected the state in its history, as well as at least 27 tornadoes of F2 intensity or greater. Outbreaks of three or more tornadoes in a single day occurred in 1786, 1787, 1878, 1973, 1989, 1998, 2001 and 2018. The year 1973 was particularly active; eight tornadoes occurred on six separate days. The year 2018 has the highest number of tornadoes recorded in the state in a year, with nine total. The 1878 Wallingford tornado killed at least 29 and likely 34 people in Wallingford, the most by any tornado event in Connecticut history.

The first tornado touched down near present-day Roxbury, then known as \\"Shipague-Neck\\". It travelled through the village of South Britain, injuring five people, with one man injured so that \\"his life was in great danger\\". Ten houses, five barns, and three mills were badly damaged or destroyed. The second tornado injured one person while moving down a hillside west of Southington.Grazulis, p. 553 *August 23, 1786: As many as six tornadoes did a great deal of damage in Windham County. Twenty homes and sixty-three barns were destroyed, as well as of dense forest. One woman was killed and five people were injured in Woodstock. Leaves from destroyed trees rained down heavily in Providence, Rhode Island.Ludlam, pp. 11‚Äì12 *August 15, 1787: The Four-State Tornado Swarm of 1787 was the largest tornado outbreak recorded to date, and affected most of New England. The first in the state touched down around 1:30 PM near New Britain, traveling along nearly the same path as a tornado in 1728 or 1729. This tornado was nearly as violent as the Wallingford Tornado of 1878. A mother and two of her children were killed in Wethersfield, and 10 others were injured before the tornado lifted outside of the town.Tornado Project. \\"Worst\\" Tornadoes Retrieved on 2007-07-02.

Background  Of Snowball's Chance as a follow-up to Orwell's work, Reed stated: \\"My intention is to blast Orwell, I‚Äôm really doing my best to annihilate him.\\"New York Press - JOHN STRAUSBAUGH The title raised the ire of Christopher Hitchens. A New York Times article about a hostile letter sent to the publisher from the Orwell estate, which cited issues of copyright infringement, precipitated a journalistic and online debate about the book at a time when Orwell's legacy was under question, due to a list of \\"crypto- Communists\\" he handed over to the British Foreign Office.A Pig Returns to the Farm, Thumbing His Snout at Orwell - New York Times Orwell's literary executor also objected to the work.Editorial: Kill the beavers! - Telegraph Hitchens accused Reed of being a \\"Bin Ladenist.\\"Portland Tribune As was reported in Australian paper The Age:The Age; 27 November 2002 \\"[William] Hamilton [Orwell's literary executor], of London, said: 'If it were a straight parody, I would say 'Good on you.' But this book seems to take rather than give.\\" Reed said: 'I think that Orwell, were he still alive, would far rather be with me in my hovel than sitting in some corporate office preparing lawsuits.'\\"  Plot  The story begins with the death of Napoleon, the original antagonist of Animal Farm. The animals of the farm, fearing what will become of them, learn that Snowball is alive and well, and Snowball returns to the farm to encourage capitalism. A second windmill is soon built alongside the first, and the two are thenceforth known as the Twin Mills (allegorical of the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center), and the animals all learn to walk on their hind legs, something hitherto forbidden by Old Major shortly before the expulsion of Mr. Jones from the farm. Also, in place of the original Seven Commandments, Snowball adopts a single slogan for the animals to live by: All animals are born equal - what they become is their own affair. As time passes, the animals, under the leadership of Snowball, realise the properties of monetary gain, and begin to file lawsuits against neighbouring farms, allowing Animal Farm to gain land and wealth. The revitalised farm also attracts animals from elsewhere in England, who are segregated from the farm animals (a possible allegory for American racial segregation). In an effort to increase their wealth, Snowball proposes to transform the farm into a large fairground named Animal Fair (similar to the development of Coney Island in the 19th Century), and in order to provide power for the fair, the animals drive off a group of beavers and other woodland creatures living by a nearby river, and the beaver-dams are destroyed in order for the farm to exploit the water- supply of the river (similar treatment to that endured by the Native Americans). Despite the success of Animal Fair, the excessive littering and pollution leaves the farm in a deplorable state, and matters worsen when the Twin Mills are destroyed by the woodland creatures in retaliation for their expulsion from the riverbank (in a manner similar to the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center). Snowball counteracts this by declaring war on the now- fanatical woodland creatures, even though Animal Farm is in no position to win the war. Differences from Animal Farm *Sugarcandy Mountain - the likely allegory for Heaven mentioned by Moses the Raven in Animal Farm. In Snowball's Chance it is renamed the Sugarcandy Lodestar. *The language of Snowball's Chance is more over-the-top than that of Animal Farm.

Developed in seven months, Jangeborg created the GRAX game engine using some prior code and components from his earlier project, graphics package The Artist. Wilkes contributed art assets towards the game, including enemy sprites and the title screen. The game was well received critically and commercially, selling over 50,000 copies; a sequel Fairlight II was released in 1986. The game revolves around the protagonist Isvar, and his quest to find the Book of Light for the court sorcerer, in order for them to escape Castle Avars. The ZX Spectrum version was one of the first (along with Technician Ted) to have an interactive loader - instead of the usual yellow/blue loading bars, a counter at the bottom of the screen ran backwards indicating how long until the game had loaded. Gameplay The player controls an adventurer named Isvar who can explore a castle displayed in an isometric view. Each object has its own physical properties and resultant characteristics in terms of how much else can be carried alongside it. Certain objects have special uses (e.g. keys open certain doors), and there is a puzzle element to the game to discover how some of these objects relate to the world in order to help the player solve the game. In addition to carrying objects, they could also be stacked on top of each other to enable Isvar to climb up to rooms above him or to reach objects otherwise out of reach. There are also a number of secret areas in the castle that are not visually obvious to the player and can only be discovered through exploration. During Isvar's exploration of the castle he is accosted by its guards and monsters - trolls, monks, guards, tornadoes, man-eating plants, bubbles, etc. all of which weaken Isvar's energy. The castle also contains food and magical potions which will restore his health. In addition, certain game objects can affect the enemies (by either killing them, distracting them, or freezing them, depending on the object and the type of enemy they are used upon). Once defeated in combat a guard disappears leaving only his helmet behind. Helmets can be picked up and carried by Isvar, and placed somewhere else out of harm's way (or into the path of a tornado, that destroys any object it touches). If Isvar leaves the room, the guard will regenerate from the helmet.

Early life Harris was born in Los Angeles, California and raised in Portland, Oregon. His first independent business enterprise, at the age of twelve or thirteen, was building crystal radio sets. A high school science course piqued his interest in chemistry. In 1924, at the age of sixteen, Harris began his college education at Oregon State University, then known as Oregon Agricultural College (OAC), where he was a member of Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity. Despite the lack of a chemistry department at that time, Harris pursued a degree in chemical engineering and took all available courses in chemistry. Graduate School and Textile Work At the age of 18, Harris graduated from OAC, and began graduate work at Yale University. Upon his graduation from Yale in 1929, Harris took his first job as a chemist at the Cheney Brothers Mill. Harris was called away from Cheney in 1931 to join a new textile research group at the National Bureau of Standards (NBS). Harris was later appointed director of the research group, which would ultimately produce roughly 200 scientific papers on various aspects of textile chemistry. While he was at the NBS Harris, along with Vincent du Vigneaud, made important discoveries with regard to similarities between the three-dimensional molecular structures of wool, insulin, and human hair. World War II Era With the beginning of US involvement in World War II, Harris‚Äô group began advising the Army Quartermaster about textiles, as well as helping to solve a myriad of problems for the NBS. Harris aided the research and redesign of sandbag sacking, tent cloth, and the chemical additives in military underwear that were used to protect soldiers from the effects of a gas attack. At the end of World War II, while the Textile Foundation was relocated to Princeton, New Jersey, Harris elected to stay in Washington, D.C. With the help of some colleagues, Harris started the Harris Research Laboratories, which operated as a consulting laboratory for the Gillette Company and American Enka Company, among others. Later career Harris‚Äô association with the Gillette Company grew with the development of his consulting business. In 1955, Gillette bought the Harris Research Laboratories and appointed Harris Vice President of Research. Just before his retirement from Gillette in 1966, Milton Harris was approached by the American Chemical Society (ACS) Board of Directors and asked if he would accept a nomination to the board. He accepted and served as head for six years. In 1975 Harris headed an ACS panel which produced a study instrumental to the National Academy of Sciences‚Äô recommendation for widespread cultivation of the jojoba shrub. Harris died of cancer September 12, 1991. His papers were donated to Oregon State University Libraries Special Collections in November 1995.

The state park surrounds Mount Spokane and other peaks including Mount Kit Carson, Beauty Mountain, and Quartz Mountain. The park receives of snow annually and is home to Mount Spokane Ski and Snowboard Park as well as an extensive system of trails for hiking, biking, and horseback riding. As of 2018, Washington State Parks reported its acreage as , making it Washington's largest state park, slightly ahead of Riverside State Park () which lies 23 miles to the southwest. History The park was dedicated with 1500 acres in 1927. During the 1930s, workers with the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) planted grass, constructed picnicking and parking areas, constructed trails and shelters, and improved roads. ;Vista House Vista House was designed by architect, H. C. Bertelsen, as was the caretaker's cabin, although an earlier design for Vista House had been prepared by state park architect Charles Saunders. The caretaker's cabin was built by Elmer Highberg. Some sources state that Vista House was built by the CCC. However, according to the State of Washington's Cultural Resources Management Plan (2009), a local contractor, E.O. Fieldstad, won the contract with a \\"low bid of $4,693,\\" and built Vista House. The publication states: \\"Its existence near the site of the Mount Spokane CCC camp may have contributed to the present impression held by many that the Vista House was constructed by the CCC.\\" Activities and amenities The park has of trails for hiking, biking, and horseback riding. Trails range from easy (the Burping Brook Loop) to difficult (the ‚ÄòRound the Mountain Trail). Winter activities include downhill and cross-country skiing, snowmobiling and snowshoeing. Camping and picnicking are also available. Bald Knob campground is generally open from May to September. There are 7 primary trail-heads to park at from Bear Creek Lodge right before the entrance of the park to the summit parking and vista house. During the winter a Sno-park permit is required at both the Lower Selkirk Sno-Park Parking Lot and the Upper Selkirk Lodge Sno-Park Parking Lot.  Rules of the Park  For vehicles to enter the park a Discover Pass is required. The exceptions to this regulation include the following: when camping or renting accommodations, being registered as a disabled veteran or state park pass holder, and having a disabled parking permit registered by the state. The park is a participant of the pack-it- in/pack-it-out program, therefore all visitors are required to pack out whatever was brought in with them.

Back closures were once common on Western female clothing, but have recently become less so, especially on female casual and business attire. They continue, however, to be widely used in underwear (such as brassieres and garter belts), formal wear (such as evening gowns and wedding dresses) and specialized clothing (such as smocks). Back closures are also common in garments for infants and toddlers.  History  Back closures throughout the past several centuries have been common on clothes designed for females of all ages, including dresses, skirts, jumpers, blouses, sweaters, and sometimes slacks, and on certain unisex clothes such as infant and toddler wear, costumes, wetsuits and special-needs outfits. Though usually a feature of a garment's designs for stylistic reasons, some back closures can be difficult or sometimes impossible for the wearer to operate oneself, a factor that has favored their phase-out. In earlier centuries, buttons found on the back of a dress as opposed to the front were originally intended to give the appearance of wealth in a woman, as wearing such a garment implied the woman could afford servants to help her dress. Many such dresses, especially the most frivolous and those intended for formal occasions, were difficult to impossible for the wearer to fasten by themselves. Back closures on female clothing remained common in Western fashion even through the Industrial Revolution, when servants became rare except to royalty and the wealthiest of women. Even then, back closures were still favored by women who wanted to appear wealthy or more attractive. It is for this reason that back closures have more often been associated with clothes intended for smarter occasions, such as formal events, religious services, or professional wear. In the 1970s and 1980s, women began taking on a wider range of activities and professions; clothing originally intended as casual and sports wear became acceptable as street wear, and women began favoring such garments that they could don and doff unassisted. Certain types of women's clothing, however, continue to feature back closures out of tradition. Formal wear such as evening gowns and wedding gowns, for example, frequently fasten at the back. Many summer dresses, especially in petite sizes, feature back zippers, though in recent years, fabrics that can retain these styles without the use of a zipper have been developed. Back closures also remain commonplace in some everyday garments that can be donned backwards and then reversed, such as skirts and bras, or that can be slipped on/off without the need for a closure, where they only are present for stylistic purposes.  Advantages and disadvantages  * Back closures allow for a solid unbroken front to the garment that is uncluttered by fasteners. On thinner and more fitted garments, the bulk introduced by a button placket or a zippered seam may also be deemed less conspicuous when worn at the back. Designers thus often favor back closures in couture and formal wear, where aesthetics are more important: the solid front makes it simpler to feature elaborate necklines, embroidery and fabric patterns across the bust. * A garment with adjustable fit may conform more closely to the torso if it fastens at the rear, where adjustments take in fabric across the flat of the back rather than the curve of the bust. Many women find back-fastening corsets and brassieres more comfortable for this reason. * It is easier to flex one's arms forwards than backwards. A back closure may thus be easier for the wearer to enter and exit the garment from the rear, especially if it is closely fitted and does not stretch. A high- necked garment which opens at the back can also be quickly pulled on without disturbing one's hair. * Most people find it awkward or difficult to reach the middle of their back, and even more so to manipulate fasteners, out of sight, on a garment that closes in back. The wearer may need assistance to dress and undress, or at least find it time-consuming to don or remove the garment.  Garment types  = Dresses = Dress with a discreet back zipper at the seam The zipper was initially popularized as a fastener for men's trousers. Though at first opposed on women's clothes due to the suggestiveness of speedy undressing, it ultimately became popular on women's clothing, particularly dresses, in the late 1930s, for their convenience over hook and eye fasteners, buttons and snap fasteners, hence the now obsolete term zipperback dress. Zippers are typically placed at the back seam of a dress. Some such garments may sport decorative buttons, lacing or mock closures at the front, but actually open at the back. In the late 1990s, the hidden zipper started to make its way into the backs of dresses, skirts, and other garments, thereby making back closures not so noticeable. But since 2010, there has been a style to have extra conspicuous zippers on the backs of dresses, skirts, and blouses, which on not all garments need to be opened to don or remove the garment. Some have fancy pull tabs. Others expose on the exterior not only the teeth of the zipper but also the fabric. = Skirts = Back zipper on a skirt. A loop for a single waist button is also visible. Skirts with back zippers continue to be commonplace, especially in career lines. They are likely to remain long after other garments with back closures lose popularity because they allow for a woman to easily dress herself. A back zipper on a skirt is normally easy to reach and manipulate, though by feel rather than sight. For occasions when it is not, then the wearer can simply rotate the skirt until the zipper becomes visible at the front, and turn it back when the job is done. Fitted skirts may have their back zippers accompanied by a single waist button, a hook-and-eye closure, or nothing else. Though skirts are currently the most common place for a back zipper, many skirts are made in alternative styles. Other skirt closures that are popular today include a front fly similar to those found on pants (which is common on jean skirts), a side zipper, or a column of buttons in front. Many skirts, especially in plus sizes, feature an elastic waistband and no closure. = Blouses = Prior to the existence of the zipper, buttons were the most common back closure found on women's clothes. in the past, a dress was usually made with buttons covering the back from the neck down the waist, or several inches below. A blouse contained buttons down its full back. But later in the 20th century, garments for women were made with fewer buttons. Toward the end of the 20th century, the keyhole button closure became popular on dresses and blouses made of nylon or silk, popular fabrics at the time. These garments, which had a roomy fit, were made to be slipped over, but the keyhole served simply as a fastener for the neck. Such clothes, mostly a part of a career line, were considered to be of high practicality. They could be worn interchangeably as casual clothes, and were easy to dress in, since they only required the fastening of a single button in a place that was easy to reach. This, combined with their T-shirt-like comfort and low cost, made them a popular choice for working women for a few decades. Since the 2000s, keyhole blouses have been replaced with sweater and T-shirt-like blouses that are elastic and are simply pulled over with no closures. Some variations of the keyhole were blouses or dresses that had two or three buttons in back. Others had a fitted mockneck collar, accompanied by either a single button or buttons covering up to the top half of the blouse. Some blouses were made with a full length of buttons, but with a roomy fit, allowing them to be donned and removed with just a single button open. = Turtlenecks and mock turtlenecks = Many tops, including turtlenecks, mock turtlenecks, and similar sweaters, have back zippers. The zippers do not need to be open in order for the top to be pulled over. But the zipper allows the top to be widely open when being pulled over in order to not disturb one's hair style. These tops are usually marketed to older adults, who are more likely to have delicate hair styles that can be damaged by pulling a garment over. = Brassieres = Most bras close in the back with a series of hooks and eyes. Since bras are elastic, they can still be donned with the closure in front and reversed. Some bras have front hooks, and others, particularly sports bras, have no closure at all. While front closing bras and pull-over bras (commonly known as sports bras) do exist, back closing bras remain the most popular type. JC Penney reported in 2004 that back-closing bras accounted for 62% of all bra sales. = Other women's garments = During the 1980s and 1990s, one-piece pants or shorts outfits that had back zippers or occasionally buttons were popular. These posed the problem that the wearer would be required to reach in back to unzip the garment simply for bathroom usage. Only those who were capable of reaching in back to zip/unzip these garments themselves could wear them. These garments are rarely seen today. In the early 2000s, pants with back zippers, which have existed in the past, were popular. These were easier to operate than outfits with full back zippers. = Other types of clothes = ; Small children : Many clothes made for 3 year old or younger children of either gender have zippers or buttons on the back. Such children mostly dressed by their parents or other adults, and this location can add ease, as well as style, to the child's outfit. Additionally, costumes made for children up to around age 12 frequently have back zippers. ; Adult males : Generally, regular clothes made for adult males do not ever have back closures. However, an exception is the cummerbund of the men's tuxedo. ; Wetsuits : Rear openings on wetsuits and diving suits can make it easier for a wearer to enter them. Most such suits are intended to be worn as skin-tight garments and are made of rubber or neoprene, which do not stretch easily at the thicknesses needed to insulate the wearer against cold water. ; Protective clothing : Aprons and smocks typically fasten at the rear as they have no openings at the front which could admit staining or hazardous substances. Most household aprons are designed to be donned quickly and can simply be slipped over the head and tied at the back of the waist. ; Special needs : Adaptive garments designed for those with physical disabilities (such as arthritis) often open at the rear so that they can be put on without having to bend the arms backwards. Such garments are also easier for caregivers to put on an unresponsive, wheelchair-bound or bedridden person. Hospital gowns traditionally tie at the back for this same reason. : Garments with rear closures are also used on patients with dementia (such as those with Alzheimer's Disease) to prevent them from disrobing at inappropriate moments or interfering with their diapers. These are typically one-piece jumpsuits with back zippers.  Alternatives to back closures  In the past, when back closures were the norm, clothes that contained them were seen as more \\"classy\\" or \\"dressy\\" by women on this basis alone, and were sought by many women. Due to the difficulty in self-fastening or unfastening a back closure, designers have employed a number of alternatives in order to make dressing and undressing easier while retaining fashionability by focusing on improving other elements of design. The alternatives, which are often used in combination, include: * Elasticity: The garment may have elastic panels added or be made of a more elastic fabric to allow the garment to simply be slipped on and off without the benefit of a closure. While some elastic is hidden by being covered or placed on a less noticeable part of the garment, other elastic bands are designed stylishly. * Front closures: Some garments are made with front closures, similar to fly openings on men's trousers and button plackets on men's shirts, but may retain a feminine cut. Other garments (such as uniform dresses for service workers like waitresses and cleaners, for example) may feature a front zipper, but concealed in a seam or flap of fabric. * Looser fit: A larger neckhole and/or a looser bodice allows the garment to be slipped on over the head without the need for a fastener. * Side closures: Side zippers have been around from before the 1950s, and are in fashion on and off. These are not as hidden from frontal view of the garment, can cause fabric to bunch up and look odd, appear less clean in outline silhouettes, and on dresses require the neck to be somewhat scooped. Side zippers are easier for the wearer to reach. Side zippers on skirts, especially for petite women, are common. They are also found sometimes on trousers. Side buttons are often found on jumper dresses and overalls. In the past, many blouses and sweaters were made with shoulder buttons, a feature rarely seen in today's fashion. * Shoulder closures: On sleeved garments, such as crew-neck and mock-neck sweaters, these allow the neckhole to be opened far enough for the garment to be pulled on or off over the head. On sleeveless garments, a shoulder closures are typically shoulder straps which can be undone at the top or detached from the front of the garment. *Back closures for show: Some dresses, blouses, and sweaters contain a zipper or buttons on the back for aesthetic purposes only, but opening or closing it is not required in order to don and remove the garment easily.  In popular culture  * The children's song \\"Miss Mary Mack\\" (of unknown origin) contains the lyrics \\"All dressed in black, black, black, With silver buttons, buttons, buttons, All down her back, back, back.\\" * In The Red Balloon, Pascal wears a sweater with a back zipper through the first half of the film.

During the Viking Age, a second runic inscription was added in Old Norse using the younger futhark. Description The Sk√•√§ng Runestone consists of a younger futhark inscription that is within a serpent on the edge of the stone and an older inscription in the center of the stone. The younger futhark inscription was discovered in 1830, but the older central inscription was not noticed until 1867. The Elder Futhark inscription is harija √∑ leugaz which is interpreted as the Proto-Norse names Harija and Leugaz. The name Harija is a hypocoristic form of names ending with -harjaz (\\"warrior\\"), or a name beginning with Harja-, and it is part of the place name H√§ringe. (Lexicon of Nordic personal names before the 8th century) The name Leugaz is a nomen agentis of the same word as the Gothic liugan (\\"swear an oath\\") and means \\"oath taker.\\" Between the two names there is a 10px rune (the shape of younger futhark rune hagall), but there is no consensus on how to interpret it. Two different forms of the z rune algiz are used in this inscription, the first a double or mirrored form similar to that used in the inscription on the Charnay fibula and the second the standard form. The younger futhark inscription is classified as being carved in runestone style Fp. The text on the serpent states that the stone was part of \\"landmarks\\" made by Skammhals and √ìl√¥f in memory of their father Sveinn. The prayer at the end of this text uses the Norse word salu for soul, which was imported from English and is first recorded as being used on a different runestone dating from the tenth century.

Larbre Comp√©tition is a French auto racing team founded in 1988 by Jack Leconte. Based at the Circuit du Val de Vienne in Le Vigeant, Larbre has had considerable success in the Porsche Carrera Cup, French GT Championship, and international FIA GT Championship. Previously working with major automobile manufacturers like Porsche, Ferrari, and Chrysler, Larbre ran one of the factory Aston Martin squads in the Le Mans Series where they won the 2006 GT1 class championship. For 2008 Larbre chose to enlist Saleen S7-Rs for the Le Mans Series and FFSA GT Championship. The team continued with the GT1 Saleens during the 2009 LMS season, but ACO denied an entry from them for the 2009 24 Hours of Le Mans. For 2010 Larbre competed once again with the 10-year-old Saleen S7-R in the Le Mans Series, with drivers Fernando Rees, Gabriele Gardel and Patrice Goueslard. In 2010 24 Hours of Le Mans the team took the last ever LMGT1 class win with the aging Saleen S7-R, as well championship victories from both Le Mans Series and Intercontinental Le Mans Cup. In 2011 the GT1 class got axed from ACO-sanctioned racing, and the old GT2 category (renamed as GTE) became the premier GT class. The team entered a Chevrolet Corvette C6.R into the GTE-Am division of the Le Mans Series and 24 Hours of Le Mans. The team won the GTE-Am category of the 2011 24 Hours of Le Mans with the Corvette and also took the second place with Porsche GT3 RSR. They also won the ILMC GTE-AM championship and thus became the first team to win a professional championship with a GT2-spec Corvette C6.R. In 2012 and 2013, Larbre competed in the FIA World Endurance Championship with two GTE-Am class Corvette C6.Rs. For 2014, Larbre competed in the first race of the European Le Mans Series season, the 4 Hours of Silverstone, with Keiko Ihara and Gustavo Yacam√°n driving a Morgan LMP2. The team also competed in the 24 Hours of Le Mans as an ELMS entry with the addition of Ricky Taylor. For 2015, Larbre is currently competing with a Chevrolet Corvette C7.R in the GTE-Am class of the FIA World Endurance Championship with drivers Gianluca Roda, Paolo Ruberti, Kristian Poulsen, and Nicolai Sylvest. The team continues in the FIA World Endurance Championship in 2016, again with a Corvette C7.R racing in GTE-Am. The driver lineup consists of Yatuka Yamagishi, Pierre Ragues, and Paolo Ruberti.

Owned and operated by Radio CJFP (1986) lt√©e (part of the Groupe Radio Simard), it broadcasts on 103.7 MHz with an effective radiated power of 60,000 watts using an omnidirectional antenna (class C). The station has an adult contemporary format under the CIEL branding. However, the station has some oldies programming, during weekends. The station was originally known as CJFP and went on the air on April 13, 1947 Larouche, Marc. \\"CJFP devient CIEL- FM\\", Le Soleil, May 7, 2001, pg. A-4. as an AM station broadcasting on 1400 kHz. From 1984 until the station's move to FM in 1994, it was one of the few AM stations authorized to increase its power at night, due to NARBA amendments which authorized all stations on \\"graveyard\\" (class C) channels to quadruple their nighttime power. CJFP actually became the most powerful station in all of North America among those stations, as it was authorized to broadcast with 10,000 watts during the day and 20,000 watts (directional) at night;Decision CRTC 84-1031 however, this did not actually result in good coverage at night due to massive co-channel interference.Decision CRTC 94-736 The FM signal went on the air on December 15, 1994Former Canadian AM stations, by Kit Sage and the AM signal went off the air in June 1995. Because the station already had an FM sister station, namely CIBM-FM (at the time, Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) regulations generally forbade broadcasters to operate more than one AM station and one FM station per market), CJFP-FM originally operated under a condition of licence which required at least half of the programming to be \\"spoken-word programming\\" (i.e., talk radio). As such, CJFP-FM became the first privately owned French- language FM station to broadcast mainly talk programming; most of that talk programming came from the Radiom√©dia network. The station abandoned most of its talk programming, adopting a full-time adult contemporary format, and changed its call sign to CIEL-FM, effective September 1, 2001. That call sign was used, until August 2000, on a Montreal-area station now known as CHMP-FM, which coincidentally now has a talk format. Transmitters CIEL-FM-1 went on the air when CJFP moved to FM.

He served as member of the Maryland House of Delegates in 1833 and 1836, and was admitted to the bar in 1840. Harris was removed from Yale after taking part in a student protest against the poor quality of the food in the campus housing. While serving in the Maryland State House of Delegates, he opposed the Know-Nothing Party and championed religious freedom. But as the Civil War loomed he also sought to enforce slavery, including the re-enslavement of Maryland's freedmen. Harris was elected as a Democrat to the Thirty-eighth and Thirty-ninth Congresses (March 4, 1863 ‚Äì March 3, 1867). During the Civil War, he voted against every war appropriations measure brought to the House of Representatives. His vote on the Thirteenth Amendment to abolish slavery is recorded as nay. In his defense of Congressman Alexander Long, Harris openly prayed for a southern victory on the floor of the House. He was therefore censured by the House of Representatives on April 9, 1864, for treasonable utterances.

In 1959, the Archdiocese of Los Angeles assumed sponsorship of the school, moving it to our present campus and taking California's first bishop, Bishop Francisco Garc√≠a Diego y Moreno, as its patron. In 2005, Bishop Diego High School became an independent Catholic high school. through the years, the school's instruction and leadership has varied from the Jesuit Fathers, the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur, the Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, the Franciscan Community, and the Josephite Fathers.

Today their membership of over 50,000 members of the national office and more than 100,000 members across the country, including ACCO affiliate groups, includes: * Parents of children who are being treated or have been treated for cancer * Children with cancer * Survivors of childhood cancer * Immediate or extended family members * Bereaved families * Health care professionals * Educators History The organization was founded in Washington, D.C. in 1970 by parents of children and adolescents with childhood cancer to advocate for their needs, and to support research so every child survives and leads a long and healthy life. The Candlelighters name is derived from an old Chinese proverb \\"It is better to light a candle than to curse the darkness.\\" Two other Candlelighters organizations formed simultaneously in 1970, one in Florida, the other in California. The initial focus of the Washington D.C. group was legislative; to achieve congressional and administrative support for increased funding for childhood cancer research during the Nixon Administration and the writing of the National Cancer Act. Parent to parent contact had such a profound impact on the parents and families of children with cancer in the initial three groups that they decided to form a national organization. It was mutually agreed upon that the metropolitan Washington area group would assume the role of National Office of Candlelighters Childhood Cancer Foundation. From this initiative, local community organizations were established throughout the country. In 1976, the Candlelighters Foundation was incorporated as the communication link for groups and contacts throughout the country. In 1985, the name was officially changed to Candlelighters Childhood Cancer Foundation. In 1997, the National Office assisted one of the local Candlelighters organizations with the development and promotion of the gold ribbon symbol as the universal awareness symbol of childhood cancer. In 2001, the National Office released a new logo, one that embraced both symbols - the candle and the gold ribbon. In 2002 Candlelighters formed legal agreements with local organizations across the nation in a binding Affiliation Agreement regarding the use of the trademark name/logo and mission statement. In 2006, the national Candlelighters board voted to expand its mission and support innovative research initiatives.

A member of the family Locustellidae, this species is notable for sexual size dimorphism, among the most pronounced in any bird. It is a moderate-sized bird of nondescript plumage; the female brownish above and paler below, the larger male a darker brown. Taxonomy The brown songlark was described by Nicholas Aylward Vigors and Thomas Horsfield as Megalurus cruralis in 1827. John Gould placed it in the genus Cincloramphus in 1843, describing it as C. cantatoris.Gould, J. (1843). In Proceedings of meeting of Zoological Society of London, Oct. 11, 1842.: 131-140 [135] However the specific name of the former authors took priority. Along with most Old World Warblers, this species was formerly placed in Sylviidae sensu lato, but molecular phylogenetic studies demonstrated that this broad grouping is not a cohesive evolutionary lineage and warbler species were assigned to various families. An alternative generic name Cinclorhamphus is derived from Greek words cinclus/Œ∫ŒπŒ≥Œ∫ŒªŒøœÇ \\"wagtail\\" and ramphos/œÅŒ±ŒºœÜŒøœÇ \\"beak\\") and cruralis from the Latin root crur- \\"leg, shin\\". Description Male brown songlarks are 23‚Äì25 cm long versus 18‚Äì19 cm for females, and may weigh 2.3 times as much. In general, the birds have a dusky pale- streaked with darker brown plumage with and pale eyebrows. The underparts are brownish-white in the female, darker brown in the male. Breeding males may display a cinnamon-colour. Its eyes and bill are black, and legs grey. Juveniles are smaller and paler with pinkish-brown bills. The call has been described as loud and creaky. The male is the principal singer, calling from perches or when rising above breeding territory. Distribution and habitat The bird is found throughout all of Australia, except parts of the far north, and not in Tasmania. There are particularly dense populations in the southern parts of the country. It prefers open pastures and grassy scrub, and feeds on seeds and insects. The species is highly nomadic. Local numbers fluctuate depending on rainfall and the bird will often flee from drought affected areas. The brown songlark has a large range, between 1,000,000 and 10,000,000 kilometers¬≤; while population size has not been quantified the bird is reported to be common. The IUCN thus lists it as a species of \\"least concern\\" . and it is considered \\"secure\\" by Australian authorities. Reproduction Nesting occurs from August to December. The nest itself is a deep cup of herbaceous material well concealed in shrubbery or tall grass. There is generally one clutch per breeding season, consisting of 2 to 5 pale pink eggs with reddish brown spots and flecks 23 mm x 17 mm in size. Females provide most of the parenting. Foxes and snakes prey upon nests. =Sexual dimorphism= The sexual dimorphism of the species has been the subject of study. Males are highly polygynous and compete directly for mates, giving rise to the pronounced size differential. Preferring open terrain, there is significant habitat heterogeneity (sameness) and excellent visibility across brown songlark territories. This allows males to defend large territories and support multiple nesting females. Research has shown an interesting corollary to the dimorphism of the species: though males are larger than females, females hatch from larger eggs and are initially heavier than their brothers. This may provide them an early competitive advantage. Particularly, in periods of low food availability, the greater nutrient reserves of female hatchlings may skew the sex-ratio toward \\"cheaper\\" daughters. Three weeks after hatching, male chicks are significantly heavier than the females. After ten days, the male chicks are almost 50% heavier than their sisters. This is due to the male nestlings receiving a higher quantity and quality of prey from their parents. The males receive more spiders than their sisters, providing them with certain amino acids that are essential for their growth and development. The females receive more grasshoppers than spiders, which contain chitin (the indigestible carbohydrate of the exoskeleton). Studies have shown that when raising all male chicks, the females energy expenditure increases by 27%. The favouritism shown to the male chicks is due to the importance of body size in males in regard to reproductive success, ensuring the parents genes are well represented in future generations.

In 1955, the Athletics left Philadelphia for Kansas City, Missouri (they have played in Oakland, California, since 1968). Meanwhile, Carpenter and the Phillies bought Shibe Park (renamed \\"Connie Mack Stadium\\") from the A's, solidified their hold on Delaware Valley baseball fans, and moved into Veterans Stadium in . Although Carpenter admitted that he had only seen the Phillies play \\"two or three games\\" before his family purchased the team (and had not attended a National League game until 1940),The New York Times, Nov. 24, 1943 the Carpenters were not new to running a baseball franchise: prior to their purchase of the Phillies, they had owned and operated a minor league baseball club, the original Wilmington Blue Rocks of the Interstate League (not to be confused with the current Carolina League franchise). Bob Carpenter took an active role in the management of the Phillies. He and his father tried to polish the team's image and way of doing business. They wanted to shed the image of failure by changing the team's nickname. Before the 1944 season, the team held a fan contest soliciting a new team nickname. Management chose \\"Blue Jays,\\" the fan submission of Elizabeth Crooks, who received a $100 war bond as compensation. Phillies management said that the Blue Jays name was as an official \\"additional nickname,\\" meaning that the team had two official nicknames simultaneously, the Phillies and the Blue Jays. The new Blue Jays moniker was ultimately unpopular; it was officially dropped by the team in January 1950. Carpenter went on to serve as the club's general manager without portfolio after the January 1948 death of Herb Pennock, through the 1950 NL pennant, and until April of 1954. For his efforts in rebuilding the franchise, Carpenter was hailed by the Sporting News as Major League Executive of the Year for 1949‚Äîone year before the Phils' pennant-winning campaign. =The 'Whiz Kids' and their aftermath= But the 1950 Whiz Kids were not able to sustain their high level of play and were the last National League club to break the baseball color line, in . The team hovered at and under .500 through the middle of the 1950s, then collapsed completely, finishing last from 1958 through 1961. However, in 1962 the Phillies once again exceeded the .500 mark, and placed in the National League's first division in 1963. The following season, 1964, the Phils burst into the league lead and appeared headed for their third NL pennant in late September‚Äîonly to lose ten games in succession and fritter away a 6¬Ω-game lead to finish tied for second. They would not contend again for a dozen years. But in , Bob and Ruly Carpenter appointed Paul Owens, the team's shrewd farm system director, as general manager, and Owens would bring the Phils back to contending status from 1976‚Äì80, the last five years of the Carpenter family's ownership. With four division titles in five years, and the 1980 world title, the Phillies averaged 93 victories a season. In the 1940s Carpenter along with a friend, boxing promoter Ralph Tribuani established the Wilmington Sportsmens Club, converted Wilmington Baseball Park into a fight venue. Many shows and exhibitions were promoted, featuring future, current and former world champions and contenders, which included Lou Brooks , Al \\"Bummy\\" Davis, Lew Jenkins, Joey Maxim, Sugar Ray Robinson, Lee Savold and Al Tribuani . Aside from baseball and boxing Carpenter was wealthy from investments and family relations with the DuPont family. In 1978, he was inducted into the Delaware Sports Museum and Hall of Fame. Bob Carpenter died of cancer at age 74 on July 8, 1990.

He was known for his \\"sterling integrity, gentlemanly manners, and polished oratory.\\" Early life Clarke was born in Winterfield, Chesterfield County, Virginia on February 11, 1809. Winterfield was a 210 acre plantation near modern day Midlothian that had a horse racetrack on it. In the 1870s it was subdivided into 65 lots. The current subdivisions of Winterfield Station (2004), Winterfield Park (2016), and Winterfield Crossing (2018) all possess the name of the old plantation and yet are not located on the land of it. Clarke attended the common school and moved to Kentucky in 1823. He studied law in Franklin, Kentucky, and graduated from the Lexington Law School in 1831. Career Clarke was admitted to the bar in 1833 and commenced practice in Franklin, Kentucky. He served as member of the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1841 and 1842. Clarke was elected as a Democrat to the Thirtieth Congress (March 4, 1847 ‚Äì March 3, 1849). He served as delegate to the State constitutional convention in 1849. =Race for Governor of Kentucky= In 1855, Clarke, who was known as old-line conservative and proslavery candidate, was selected as the Democratic nominee for Governor of Kentucky. His opponent Charles S. Morehead, a former Whig U.S. Representative who ran with the Know-Nothing Party ran a campaign that focused on immigrants and vilified Catholics leading to bloody riots in Louisville. Although Clarke himself was not a Catholic, his wife was and that was used against him. Clarke had the support of John C. Breckinridge, who (successfully) ran to replace Morehead in the House of Representatives and would later serve as Vice-President of the United States from 1857 to 1861 under President Buchanan. Clarke was defeated by Morehead (69,816 for Morehead to 65,413 for Clarke) who served until 1859. Louisville, KentuckyLouisville =Diplomatic service= On January 7, 1858, he was appointed by President Buchanan as U.S. Minister to Guatemala. On January 14, 1858, he was also appointed as U.S. Minister to Honduras. He presented his credentials in Guatemala on July 13, 1858 and in Honduras on August 10, 1858, serving until his death in Guatemala on March 17, 1860. After moving to Guatemala, Clarke converted to Catholicism, confirmed by Bishop Bernardo Pi√±ol with Pedro de Aycinena y Pi√±ol as his godfather, much to the delight of the people there. Personal life Clarke was married to his cousin Mariah Louise Clarke (1818-1847), a devout Roman Catholic. Together, they were the parents of one son and three daughters (all of whom they named after the Virgin Mary), including: * George W. Clarke * Mariah \\"Pauline\\" Clarke (1837‚Äì1876), who married John Singleton Mosby (1833‚Äì1916) on December 30, 1856 and moved to Brentmoor in Warrenton, Virginia.

TFIIA is one of several general (basal) transcription factors (GTFs) that are required for all transcription events that use RNA polymerase II. Other GTFs include TFIID, a complex composed of the TATA binding protein TBP and TBP-associated factors (TAFs), as well as the factors TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH. Together, these factors are responsible for promoter recognition and the formation of a transcription preinitiation complex (PIC) capable of initiating RNA synthesis from a DNA template. Functions TFIIA interacts with the TBP subunit of TFIID and aids in the binding of TBP to TATA-box containing promoter DNA. Interaction of TFIIA with TBP facilitates formation of and stabilizes the preinitiation complex. Interaction of TFIIA with TBP also results in the exclusion of negative (repressive) factors that might otherwise bind to TBP and interfere with PIC formation. TFIIA also acts as a coactivator for some transcriptional activators, assisting with their ability to increase, or activate, transcription. The requirement for TFIIA in vitro transcription systems has been variable, and it can be considered either as a GTF and/or a loosely associated TAF-like coactivator. Genetic analysis in yeast has shown that TFIIA is essential for viability. Structure TFIIA is a heterodimer with two subunits: one large unprocessed (subunit 1, or alpha/beta; gene name ) and one small (subunit 2, or gamma; gene name ). It was originally believed to be a heterotrimer of an alpha (p35), a beta (p19) and a gamma subunit (p12). In humans, the sizes of the encoded proteins are approximately 55 kD and 12 kD. Both genes are present in species ranging from humans to yeast, and their protein products interact to form a complex composed of a beta barrel domain and an alpha helical bundle domain. It is the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of the large subunit that participate in interactions with the small subunit. These regions are separated by another domain whose sequence is always present in large subunits from various species but whose size varies and whose sequence is poorly conserved. A second gene encoding a large TFIIA subunit has been found in some higher eukaryotes. This gene, ALF/TFIIAtau (gene name GTF2A1LF) is expressed only in oocytes and spermatocytes, suggesting it has a TFIIA-like regulatory role for gene expression only in germ cells.

After statehood, he was elected as an Oklahoma delegate to Congress, where he served six consecutive terms. He retired from politics in 1915. He was a cousin of William Neville.  Early life  Born in Belleville, Illinois, McGuire moved to Randolph County, Missouri with his parents in 1867. He attended public school, and moved to Chautauqua County, Kansas, in the spring of 1881; and then to Indian Territory. He engaged in the cattle business, and attended the State Normal School at Emporia, Kansas.  Career  McGuire taught for several terms, and later attended the law department of the University of Kansas at Lawrence. He was admitted to the bar in 1889 and commenced practice in Sedan, county seat of Chautauqua, Kansas. He registered as a republican the first time he voted, and remained in that party for the rest of his life. He served as prosecuting attorney of Chautauqua County, Kansas from 1890 to 1894. Thoburn, Joseph Bradfield. A Standard History of Oklahoma. Vol. 5, p. 1259. 1916. Accessed February 13, 2020. After moving to Pawnee in Indian Territory] in 1894 he opened a law practice there. He was appointed assistant United States Attorney for Oklahoma Territory in 1897, in which capacity he served until after his nomination for Congress. McGuire was recognized as the leader of one wing of the Oklahoma Republican Party and battled with the last territorial governor Frank Frantz over party leadership and patronage appointments.Carney, George O., \\"McGuire, Bird Segle (1865-1930) ,\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture (accessed May 28, 2010). The infighting resulted in McGuire's being the only Republican elected to Congress from Oklahoma in 1907. Aiding Oklahoma's Bid for Statehood Elected as a Republican a Delegate to the Fifty-eighth and Fifty-ninth Congresses, McGuire served from March 4, 1903, to March 3, 1907. As a Territorial representative he could not vote. However, he could participate in the debates. When Congress took up the issue of statehood for the twin territories, the Democrats were adamantly in favor of creating two states: Sequoyah for Indian Territory (the eastern part) and Oklahoma for the western part. Republicans favored a single state that would be called Oklahoma. Although Congress was closely divided, the Republican president Theodore Roosevelt was so opposed to the two-state solution, he promised to veto any legislation that came to his desk with that option. McGuire realized that if the Democrats got their way, then no state would be created in the foreseeable future. Historian Thoburn wrote that McGuire proved so capable in moving the Democrats to back down on their two- state position that Congress passed the Oklahoma Enabling Act which the President signed, even though grudgingly. Thoburn, p. 1260. He was then elected as a Representative to the Sixtieth and to the three succeeding Congresses and served from November 16, 1907, when Oklahoma was admitted as a State into the Union, until March 3, 1915. He served as chairman of the Committee on Expenditures in the Department of the Interior ( Sixty-first Congress). He was not a candidate for renomination in 1914 to the Sixty-fourth Congress. He married Ruby Ridgeway of Kansas City, Missouri on June 2, 1911. When his term expired in 1915, he moved his residence from Pawnee to Tulsa, where he resumed his law practice until his death. Thoburn, p. 1260. McGuire also owned and operated a large ranch near Bartlesville, Oklahoma.  Death  McGuire died in Tulsa, Tulsa County, Oklahoma, on November 9, 1930 (age 65 years, 27 days).

Design and development Using lessons learned from the MB 1 and MB 2, James Martin and Captain Valentine Baker capitalised in developing the design and construction to produce a new design, the MB 3, which was powered by a 2,000 hp Napier Sabre 24-cylinder, H-type engine, driving a de Havilland variable-pitch three-bladed propeller. The MB 3 was to meet an Air Ministry fighter specification. It was armed with six cannon mounted in the wings, each with 200 rounds of ammunition, which made it the most heavily-armed fighter in existence: for ease of maintenance the armament was easily accessible. Three were ordered to specification F.18/39 which was written for the design. While retaining the essential characteristics of the earlier designs, MB 3 included many new features: the fuselage primary structure was still the round steel tube arrangement but metal panels had taken the place of wood and fabric of earlier models. The wing construction integrated torsion-box construction and a laminated steel spar, would give a strong and stiff structure with minimum flexing. Attention to detail extended to a Martin-designed pneumatically- controlled undercarriage that was simple, sturdy, effective and reliable. With the wing flaps also pneumatically operated, the need for hydraulics, with all their attendant operational hazards and maintenance problems, was eliminated. Underwing radiators had the coolant radiator on the starboard and the oil cooler on the port side. Testing and evaluation Then listed as \\"Experimental Aeroplane No.120\\" and with the serial number R2492, the MB 3 was temporarily stationed at 26 OTU (Operational Training Unit ‚Äì RAF Wing in Buckinghamshire) for trials and first flew on 31 August 1942. The tests were supervised by Group Captain Snaith and observed by, amongst others, Air Vice Marshals Linnell and Burton. Following its successful first flight, undertaken by Captain Baker, the next series of test flights revealed the MB 3 to be highly manoeuvrable and easy to fly, but on 12 September 1942, the engine failed soon after take-off and Captain Baker, trying to save the aircraft by executing a difficult forced landing, crashed in a field and was killed. The Unit Report states, > Capt. Baker had just got airborne, when he had immediate loss of power. In > trying to save the aircraft, he made a forced landing in a field, but hit a > tree stump and was killed. The subsequent Court of Inquiry found the cause to be \\"...engine failure due to a broken sleeve drive crank in the engine.\\" Rumours suggested that the Napier Sabre engine used had been overheating on the ground. Ground-crew George Bignall recalled \\"Although nobody was allowed into the aircraft hangar, we were able to see it during its testing time. It was very fast, with Captain Baker flying very close to us at times, shooting up the runway very low.\\" Of the day of the accident he said, \\"I was doing a modification on dispersals, when Captain Baker took off towards Stewkley. I watched him climb, then, suddenly, the engine cut out and he crashed, trying to land.\\" Civilian John Thornton also witnessed the accident, > Two fields from where Morris and I were harvesting, there was a stack of > newly-threshed straw. The MB3 hit this and burst into flame. 'Bunny' Winter, > the bailiff of Cold Harbour Farm, beat us to the crash, but we were too late > to rescue Captain Baker in the fierce fire. The Unit Report states that Mr Winter actually managed to remove Capt. Baker's body from the aircraft. Due to various delays and late delivery, the Ministry considered the design outdated and there was no production order.Buttler, British Secret Projects Fighters and Bombers 1935‚Äì1950 p. 31 Despite the loss of the sole prototype, the MB 3 design was not abandoned and Martin decided to design the MB 4, powered by a Griffon engine. This project was eventually dropped in favour of an entirely new design, which became the Martin-Baker MB 5. Legacy The MB 3 design could have been developed into a good fighter aircraft. Martin felt the personal loss of his best friend and partner and \\"many consider that it was this painful tragedy that really fired the passionate interest in the safety of aircrews, which was later to become the very pivot of his life\\".Teeuwen, Jaap. \\"Martin-Baker MB 5\\".

He was named the France Football African Footballer of the Year and the African Footballer of the Year (the only Guinean to receive that honour) in 1972 while playing with Hafia FC in Conakry. Career Born in Kindia the son of a chauffeur/mechanic, Souleymane moved to East Germany when he was 17 years old to study to become a plumber, but switched to architecture because, he later stated, it made it easier for him to play football. He played for SC Neubrandenburg in the second-tier DDR-Liga for two seasons, from 1962 to 1964. He returned to his home country and spent the rest of his playing career with top-tier Hafia FC, initially known as Conakry II when he joined the club. He played for Hafia from 1964 to 1978. Hafia was a powerhouse in Guinea and in Africa during this period, winning the Guin√©e Championnat National, the top national league, from 1965 to 1968 and from 1971 to 1979. In international competition, it won the African Cup of Champions Clubs three times, in 1972, 1975 and 1977, and was the runner-up in 1976, during Souleymane's tenure. In the 1976 African Cup of Nations, Guinea came in second, despite never losing a game, the sole regret of his playing career. He was also on the Guinea national football team from 1965 through 1977, and competed for Guinea at the 1968 Summer Olympics with the national team. In 11 FIFA appearances, he scored three goals. He also coached nine FIFA games, amassing a record of three wins, two draws and four losses. He made his debut at the 1985 inaugural FIFA U-16 World Championship in China; his team defeated the United States 1-0, advanced out of its group and placed fourth. As of December 2013, Souleymane has been the Technical Director (Director Technique) of the Guinean Football Federation since 2004.

Barnes, a tall, well-groomed, politically astute 42-year old attorney, stood in marked contrast to 70-year old Rogers. Barnes ran an aggressive campaign, attacking Rogers on many issues, including the war, and actively recruited new, young voters. In the primary, Barnes would defeat Rogers by a mere 30 votes (27,218 to 27,188). Rogers alleged foul that Barnes' staff had registered University of Denver students who were non-residents from other states.

Johnson was a co- founder and organizer of the Mile High Housing Association, a cooperative- housing membership group that acquired land and built 32 homes on South Dahlia Lane, in Arapahoe County just southeast of Denver. The cooperative was launched by faculty members at the University of Denver who at the time lived in temporary postwar housing (mainly butler huts) and wanted something better. Johnson and his family moved into their home in February 1951. South Dahlia Lane's 32 homes were designed by architect Eugene Sternberg, whose South Dahlia Lane home was next door to Johnson's. Sternberg's designs were influenced by Frank Lloyd Wright; Wright's Pope-Leighey House in Virginia has distinctive elements that re-appear in the Sternberg designs for South Dahlia Lane. Johnson in 1954 launched and organized a church-sponsored housing project for the elderly, Senior Homes of Colorado. Built on East Kentucky Circle, Senior Homes of Colorado opened its doors to residents in 1958. Political career Johnson served as member of the Colorado House of Representatives from 1955 to 1956.

The site focuses on the technical and engineering aspects of the United States space program, but also covers spaceflight activities of private companies and other countries around the world. NASASpaceFlight.com has had stories picked up by news organizations such as MSNBC, USA Today, The New York Times, and Popular Science. NASASpaceFlight also frequently broadcasts its own independently-produced live videos of rocket launches online. It is owned and operated by founder and managing editor Chris Bergin. History The site was conceived from an idea between Chris Bergin and three NASA and United Space Alliance managers, who wanted to see a news media site cover space flight (specifically the Space Shuttle, the Vision for Space Exploration and NASA) from an engineering standpoint, concentrating on breaking news and documentation that involved the communication between the engineers and managers and the general public who were interested. The website went online in the summer of 2005, just before the first \\"Return to Flight\\" Space Shuttle mission (STS-114) following the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster. It soon expanded its coverage from NASA to all crewed and uncrewed spaceflight, by commercial providers as well as international space agencies. NSF also developed a team of photographers and videographers who capture views from launch sites and other various facilities, for publication on the site. Video content In 2019, NSF began publishing content on its YouTube channel, where HD video of various aerospace activities is uploaded regularly. The channel also hosts live broadcasts of rocket launches from various launch sites, particularly Kennedy Space Center, Cape Canaveral, usually hosted on- site by assistant managing editor Chris Gebhardt, as well as hardware testing at the SpaceX South Texas Launch Site, Boca Chica, Texas broadcast on-site by Mary \\"Boca Chica Gal\\", a videographer who had been a resident of the site before the development of the spaceport, and began contributing to NSF in 2018. A weekly space news recap show and podcast \\"NSF Live\\", hosted by contributors Jack Beyer, Thomas Burghardt, John \\"Das\\" Galloway, and others, also broadcast on the channel, frequently features NSF contributors that specialize in a particular aerospace topic, or guests from the aerospace industry, to discuss topics of interest for that week, and answer questions from the audience.

Early life Catherine Dorris was born in Camden, Ouachita County, Arkansas to Baptist preacher Franklin Dorris, and Rose Whitehead Dorris in 1901. The family moved to various congregations in Tennessee, Texas, and Arkansas before they settled and Catherine Dorris finished high school in Monticello, Arkansas. She attended Ouachita Baptist University in Arkadelphia, and the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville. While there, she became a skilled organist and pianist and went on to serve as director of the music department at Arkansas A & M College (now Arkansas State University) and teach in the Arkansas public school system. Family Norrell was married to William Frank Norrell from 1922 until his death in 1961. Together they had one child, Julia Jean \\"Judy\\" Norrell. Catherine Norrell worked alongside her husband for three decades and succeeded him in the United States House of Representatives following his death. While on leave from George Washington University Law School, Judy Norell managed her mother's 1961 campaign. Political career Serving as president of the Congressional Wives Club, Norrell befriended Hattie Wyatt Caraway of Jonesboro, Arkansas, who was the first woman ever elected to the U.S. Senate. Norrell worked in the political sphere since the 1930s when her husband was elected to the Arkansas Senate and later to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1938. Catherine Norrell worked as her husband's legislative assistant while he served in the state legislation and Congress. Following her husband's death, she began her campaign for his seat with the slogan: ‚Äú‚ÄúKeep Your Congressional Power Up! Elect Mrs. W. F. Norrell‚Ä¶the Only Candidate Prepared to Step In.‚Äù Norrell was elected as a Democratic candidate to the Eighty-seventh United States Congress April 18, 1961, to fill the vacant seat. In the special election she faced four Democratic male candidates, including lawyer and banker John Harris Jones (born 1922) of Pine Bluff, who attacked Norrell, claiming if elected, she would benefit financially from the congressional salary as well as a pension from her husband's House service. Norrell succeeded in defeating her opponents, winning with 43 percent of the vote to 25 percent for Jones and 23 percent for M.C. Lewis. Catherine Norrell was one of only 20 women serving in the 87th Congress. She took her oath of office on April 25, 1961 and served until January 3, 1963. She was ineligible for renomination due to the elimination of Arkansas's 6th congressional district. Norrell's first vote in Congress was in favor of the Kennedy administration's Cold War policies that proposed foreign aid to Latin American countries. In office, Norrell focused her efforts on ensuring economic development for Arkansas and especially, her Sixth District. She made legislative strides to protect her home-state's clay, textile, and lumber industries through increased government control. Norrell noticed the wood industry within her district suffered from reduced tariff rates and she sequentially joined Representative Cleveland M. Bailey of West Virginia in supporting a bill that would ease Internal Revenue Service (IRS) efforts to collect retroactive taxes. This was intended to protect businesses in those areas from financial harassment as well as from foreign countries who failed to reciprocate. In May 1961, Norrell showed her support of the Equal Rights Amendment by sponsoring a joint resolution calling for the Amendment's passage. Norrell also supported the Equal Rights Amendment and signed a joint resolution in May 1961 which called for its passage. Though Norrell and her husband both identified as Democrats, she was able to stand apart from her husband in her political decisions; she claimed \\"I expect in the future my vote will be more conservative than liberal.\\" Legacy The dissolution of Arkansas's Sixth District, paired with familial, political, and especially financial reasons discouraged Norrell from running against two powerful incumbents Representative Mills and Representative Oren Harris. Judy, Norrell's daughter and campaign manager was concerned with the stress the campaign would have on her mother and their family so she consequently discouraged her mother from rerunning. In private, Catherine Norrell revealed to friends that financially, she could not afford the contested campaign. After her term in Congress, President Kennedy appointed her Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Educational and Cultural Affairs where she served from 1963 to 1965. She later served from June 1, 1965 until January 5, 1969 as director of the United States Department of State Reception Center in Honolulu after being appointed by Lyndon B. Johnson. Norrell noted that her husband had voted against Hawaii statehood but she had favored admission of the fiftieth state. She explained, \\"...that was my husband and not me... I'm delighted to be here.‚Äù. She resided in Monticello, Arkansas, until her death in Warren in Bradley County. Norrell worked as a church musician in Hawaii for most of her retirement before returning to her hometown of Monticello, Arkansas. On August 26, 1981, Catherine Norrell died in Warren, Arkansas. She was interred alongside her husband at Oakland Cemetery in Monticello.

Hyperconnectivity is a term invented by Canadian social scientists Anabel Quan-Haase and Barry Wellman, arising from their studies of person-to-person and person-to-machine communication in networked organizations and networked societies. The term refers to the use of multiple means of communication, such as email, instant messaging, telephone, face-to-face contact and Web 2.0 information services.

New York: Oxford University Press, 2006 Hyperconnectivity is also a trend in computer networking in which all things that can or should communicate through the network will communicate through the network. This encompasses person-to-person, person-to-machine and machine- to-machine communication. The trend is fueling large increases in bandwidth demand and changes in communications because of the complexity, diversity and integration of new applications and devices using the network. The communications equipment maker Nortel has recognized hyperconnectivity as a pervasive and growing market condition that is at the core of their business strategy. CEO Mike Zafirovski and other executives have been quoted extensively in the press referring to the hyperconnected era. Apart from network-connected devices such as landline telephones, mobile phones and computers, newly-connectable devices range from mobile devices such as PDAs, MP3 players, GPS receivers and cameras through to an ever wider collection of machines including cars refrigerators and coffee makers, all equipped with embedded wireline or wireless networking capabilities. The IP enablement of all devices is a fundamental limitation of IP version 4, and IPv6 is the enabling technology to support massive address explosions.

He is referred to as the \\"Father of Arizona\\" due to his efforts lobbying for creation of the territory. Poston was also Arizona Territory's first Delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives. Background Poston was born near Elizabethtown, Kentucky to Temple and Judith Debrille Poston. His father was a printer and he served as a printer's devil. Poston was orphaned at the age of twelve, and was apprenticed to the local county clerk, Samuel Haycraft. Following his apprenticeship, he moved to Nashville, Tennessee where he clerked for the Tennessee Supreme Court while reading law. Poston married Haycraft's daughter, Margaret, in November 1849 and the couple had a daughter, Sarah Lee Poston, who reached adulthood. Margaret Poston became paralyzed on February 12, 1851, possibly from a stroke while giving birth to a second child, and was cared for by relatives until her death from cancer on February 26, 1884. On July 27, 1885, Poston married former newspaper typesetter Martha \\"Mattie\\" Tucker. The couple separated shortly afterwards, but there is no evidence they ever divorced. Early exploration and mining efforts Poston traveled to California as part of the Gold Rush and took a clerk position at the San Francisco Customs House in February 1851. Poston was demoted in 1853 and complained that his replacement was a professional gambler and political appointee. While at this job, he became involved with a group of French bankers interested in the lands of the recently negotiated Gadsden Purchase. In late 1853, with the bankers' backing, Poston joined with mining engineer Herman Ehrenberg to organize an expedition into the territory Mexico was expected to sell to the United States. Taking a ship from San Francisco, the two became shipwrecked near the Mexican port of Guaymas. They were then detained temporarily by Mexican authorities as suspected filibusters before heading north to the Gadsden territory. The expedition visited San Xavier del Bac and Ajo, collecting mineral samples along the way, before traveling down the Gila River. At Fort Yuma, a U.S. Army post near the confluence of the Gila and Colorado River, Poston first met the fort's commander Major Samuel P. Heintzelman. While at Fort Yuma Poston surveyed a townsite on the south side of the river a mile below the fort, at Jaeger's Ferry. Poston sold the townsite called Colorado City for $20,000 when he returned to San Francisco. The mining town and fort of Cerro Colorado, established by Poston and Major Heintzelmen. After returning to San Francisco, Poston left for the East Coast in search of capital to fund a mining operation in the newly acquired territory. After several unsuccessful attempts, he was introduced to several Cincinnati, Ohio investors by Heintzelman. On March 24, 1856, US$2 million was secured to found the Sonora Exploring and Mining Company with Heintzelman as company president and Poston as managing supervisor. The company set up headquarters in Tubac, Arizona and began mining operations in the nearby Santa Rita Mountains and elsewhere. Poston served as alcalde of the settlement and became known as \\"Colonel\\" Poston in the town of roughly 800 people. Using the authority granted to him by the government of New Mexico Territory, he printed his own money and officiated over marriages, divorces, and the baptisms of children. This continued until Father Macheboeuf, the vicar of Bishop Jean- Baptiste Lamy, was sent from Santa Fe to investigate the goings-on in Tubac. The validity of the marriages Poston had performed was questioned by the vicar, and a US$700 donation made before Father Macheboeuf sanctified the unions. Charles Poston's brother, John, was murdered by Mexican outlaws at Cerro Colorado in southern Arizona, the town was established by Charles Poston. Mining operations produced US $3000 per day in silver until 1861. With the withdrawal of Union troops due to the American Civil War, Tubac saw an increase in hostilities from local Apaches and the settlement had to be abandoned. Arizona Territory John Poston's grave, the brother of Charles Poston who was murdered by Mexican outlaws at Cerro Colorado, Arizona in 1861. After being forced to leave Tubac due to the Apache siege, Poston went to Washington D.C. and worked for General Heintzelman as a civilian aide. During this time Heintzelman introduced him to President Abraham Lincoln. Poston in turn used this time to lobby both Lincoln and Congress for creation of an Arizona Territory, advertising the benefits of the area's mineral wealth to the Union cause. Toward the end of the process Poston attended an oyster dinner where the slate of territorial positions was divided among lame duck congressmen and Poston was selected as an Indian Agent for the new territory. Poston commissioned Tiffany & Co. to create a US$1500 inkwell from Arizona silver and presented the inkwell to Lincoln upon signing of the Arizona Organic Act. On 12 March 1863 Poston was appointed superintendent of Indian affairs. This appointment was followed by his election as Delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives on 18 July 1864. During his term of service, Poston submitted bills aimed at settling private land claims and to establish Indian reservations along the Colorado river. In 1865, Poston chose not to return to Arizona during his run for reelection, and was defeated by John Noble Goodwin. A final run for election to the territorial delegate position failed in 1866. Writing After losing his position in Congress, Poston opened a law office in Washington D.C. In 1867 he traveled to Europe, spending time in both London and Paris. He then returned to Washington and in 1868 published a travel book, Europe in the Summer-Time. This was followed by U.S. Secretary of State William H. Seward commissioning Poston to deliver the Burlingame Treaty to the Emperor of China and to study irrigation and immigration in Asia. After China, Poston continued to India where he developed a fascination with the Parsi people and Zoroastrianism. He reached Egypt by early 1869 and was in Paris by April of that year. After living a year in Paris he moved to London where he spent the next six years. During this time he worked as an editor of a London newspaper, foreign correspondent to the New York Tribune, and as a \\"counselor- at-law\\". Poston also wrote several books during this time, publishing The Parsees in 1872, The Sun Worshippers of Asia in 1877, and his poem Apache Land in 1878. His work, Building a State in Apache Land was published in installments by Overland Monthly between July and October 1894. Later life Poston in his later years Poston returned to the United States in time for the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia. Through his acquaintance with John Bigelow, he then became a campaign worker for Samuel J. Tilden during the U.S. presidential election of 1876. Poston expected a consul position in London if Tilden had won the election, but instead was made register of the United States land office at Florence, Arizona from July 1877 till June 1879. During his time in Florence he became interested in building a Parsi fire temple on a nearby hill, paying for construction of a road to the summit. The temple itself was decorated with a blue and white flag depicting a red sun and built upon the ruins of an older Indian structure. Construction ended when Poston ran out of funds. He attempted to raise additional money, even writing to the Shah of Iran, but his efforts failed and the temple's eternal flame failed shortly thereafter. This unusual interest led to Poston being criticized as a crank and eccentric. Following his time in Florence he moved to Tucson and supported himself with a variety of positions including lecturer, mining and railroad promoter, and writer. In 1884 he became a consular agent in Nogales followed by an assignment as a civilian military agent in El Paso, Texas in 1887 and as employee of U.S. Geological Survey in 1889. Inscription on the tomb of Charles D. Poston on Poston Butte in Florence, Arizona Poston declined into obscurity until 1897 when Whitelaw Reid published an account detailing Poston's situation. As a result, the Arizona Territorial legislature awarded Poston a pension of US$25/month in 1899 and increased this to US$35/month in 1901. Poston died from apparent heart failure on June 24, 1902 in Phoenix, Arizona Territory. Despite his previously stated wish to be buried at the summit of Primrose Hill, Poston was initially buried in a pauper's grave in Phoenix. His remains were removed from Phoenix and moved to Florence, Arizona, on the 100th anniversary of his birth, and buried on Primrose Hill, renamed, Poston Butte where he had never completed his \\"Temple to the Sun\\". He was entombed in an official ceremony led by Governor George W. P. Hunt. Television depictions Poston was portrayed in the 1965 episode \\"A City Is Born\\" by later California Governor and U.S. President Ronald W. Reagan on the syndicated television series Death Valley Days. In the story line, Poston is a mining developer and surveyor engaged in a race against time to reach San Diego, California, for an important meeting with bankers. In another Death Valley Days segment in 1966, Robert Taylor, Reagan's successor as the series host, played Poston in the episode \\"The Day All Marriages Were Cancelled\\". The story stemmed from a dispute between Poston and the Roman Catholic bishop, who questioned how Poston through his role as alcalde could perform secular marriages at no costs to the couples involved in the absence of available priests. During a civil trial, the church relents, and the marriages were declared legal once again. Willard Sage played the role of Father McCabe in this episode.

Gangulphus was a Burgundian courtier whose historical existence can only be attested by a single document: a deed from the court of Pepin the Short dated 762. It attests that he was a great landowner, whose family dominated the region and exercised a lot of power.Alessandro Barbero Gangulphus decided to renounce his wealth and become a hermit. Even so, he was subsequently killed by his wife's lover, who wished to remove Gangulphus as a possible interference to the adulterous relationship. Legend Born to one of the most illustrious families of Burgundy, his education was provided by his parents, who were virtuous Christians. As a youth, Gangulphus was known for his great honesty, chastity, and propriety, and visited churches and read religious texts, avoiding the company of libertines. When his parents died, he became a model landowner, taking care of the household economy with ease and industry and also providing for the churches and the poor on his land. When it came time to marry, he chose a woman who did not share his virtues. As an important nobleman, Gangulphus participated in the wars of the time, but also dedicated himself to preaching the Gospel in Frisia. On a journey back to Burgundy, he found a property at Bassigny upon which stood a fountain that issued fresh and good water. Gangulphus bought the property. However, his friends mocked him because this property's fountain would not serve back at home. However, when Gangulphus returned home, he pushed a stick into the soil. The next day, he instructed his servant to pull the stick out of the soil. Out of the soil emerged a new fountain, from which gushed fresh water. During his absence, his wife had committed adultery with a priest. His wife protested her innocence, but Gangulphus wished her innocence to be judged by God. Thus, he had her dip her hand into the very same source of water he had created on his property. His wife‚Äôs hand was completely and miraculously scalded by the water. Gangulphus was fairly lenient: he forbade his wife from ever sharing his marriage bed and also ordered the priest to go abroad. Gangulphus meanwhile withdrew to his castle at Avallon, near V√©zelay, performing works of penance and charity. However, his wife soon had her lover return. Hurrying back, the priest, wishing to decapitate Gangulphus, attacked the saint as he slept. However, the priest missed and injured Gangulphus' thigh. The wound, however, proved to be fatal and Gangulphus received the Last Sacraments on May 11, 760. The priest fled the country with Gangulphus' wife.San Gengolfo Purported miracles soon took place at Gangulphus' tomb. Both his wife and the priest soon suffered illnesses and died. Veneration Gangulphus' relics were translated to Varennes-sur-Amance in the diocese of Langres, where his cult developed, and later distributed to various places in France, Germany, the Low Countries and Switzerland. Gangulphus' name is found in numerous martyrologies of the 10th and 11th centuries, in France as well as in Germany, and later in England and Italy. His Life was probably written at Varennes. Hrosvit of Gandersheim wrote a version of his life around 960. Some of his relics, consisting of part of his head, can be found at the Gangolfskirche in Bamberg.St. Gangolf, Bambergs aelteste bestehende Kirche und lebendige Gemeinde The Gangolfskirche in Hollfeld developed as a daughter church of the Bamberger church. On the Milseburg, in the Rh√∂n Mountains, rises a Gangolfkapelle, as well as at Wolpertswende in Upper Swabia and at Fladungen in northern Franconia. There is also a Sankt Gangloff in Thuringia. Gangulphus became also associated with the spot now occupied by the area known as Saint- Gingolph, where he is said to have dedicated himself as a hermit to a life of prayer and penance. Local legends confused Gangulphus with a hypothetical soldier of the Theban Legion who escaped from nearby Agaunum and would have faced martyrdom there. There is a poem about the saint in The Ingoldsby Legends, entitled A Lay of St. Gengulphus, by Richard Barham.

Rear view mirrors are somewhat standard equipment for this endeavor. Extremely large or luxury vehicles may have in addition technical aids such as backup cameras. Many industrial vehicles such as fork lifts automatically activate a repetitive warning beep whilst reversing. In the UK lorries may be fitted with warning devices which repeatedly announce \\"This vehicle is reversing\\", or the equivalent phrase in Welsh. Reversing a vehicle can serve the purpose of changing lanes in traffic when a driver wishes to change to an adjacent lane but the destination lane is relatively full of vehicles. This is performed by driving in the reverse direction until the vehicle can move into the adjacent lane (or adjacent lanes) at the back of the queue in the next lane. More commonly, reversing is used as an intermediate step, to complete a three point turn, J-turn, parallel park, or similar maneuver. These moves are used with the goal of positioning the vehicle in a specific way under certain space restrictions, that would not be possible to achieve whilst moving forward.

Background Campbell, the son of Thomas Courtney Campbell and Ellen Minor Campbell, was born in Chillicothe, Missouri, and educated at Westminster College in Fulton, Missouri, and thereafter the University of Missouri at Columbia. During World War I, he served as a second lieutenant in the United States Army. He studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1924 in Missouri and Florida and practiced from 1924 to 1928 in Tampa. He also worked as a citrus farmer, banker, and land developer. He was married to the former Henrietta Hisgen. Political life Campbell served as the assistant attorney general of Florida and from 1941 to 1946 was a member of the Florida War Labor Relations Board. From 1942 to 1947, he was a member of the Florida State Road Board. In 1948, the Davis Causeway across Tampa Bay was renamed the Courtney Campbell Causeway in his honor. Campbell had spearheaded efforts to ensure repairs and beautification of the causeway. Campbell was elected in 1952 to the Eighty-third Congress (January 3, 1953 ‚Äì January 3, 1955), when the one- term Democratic incumbent Chester B. McMullen did not seek reelection. Campbell was challenged by the Republican State Representative William C. Cramer of St. Petersburg. A native of Denver, Colorado, Cramer spent $25,000 in a handshaking campaign about Pinellas, Hillsborough, Pasco, and Hernando counties. Cramer benefit from running on the Eisenhower-Nixon ticket though he lost to Campbell by .7 of 1 percent. In 1954, with a stronger organization, Cramer rebounded and unseated Campbell by the same .7 percent margin by which he had lost in 1952. He spent $40,000, an amount insufficient for television advertising in the then still new medium.

Politically he served one term as Arizona Territory's Congressional delegate as well as a member of the Tennessee House of Representatives and Arizona Territorial Legislature. He had a number of business interests over the course of his life but is best known for mining interests. Early life and education Bean was born to Josiah J. and Olive (Sanborn) Bean on January 4, 1828 in Tamworth, New Hampshire. His father died while he was young and Bean relocated to Gilmanton, New Hampshire with his mother in 1837. He received his education at Phillips Exeter Academy and Union College. Early career In the mid-1850s, Bean moved to New York City where he obtained a job at the custom house. In addition to his job, Bean was involved with the brokerage business and read law. He was admitted to the bar but rarely practiced law. Bean had enough financial success that by 1859 he was able to donate $2,500 for creation of a private railroad. During the American Civil War, Bean was the clerk of the New York City school board. Career During 1864 Bean moved to Columbia, Tennessee. From there he went to Nashville, Tennessee. During 1867 and 1868, Bean served as a member of the Tennessee House of Representatives. Bean married Mary Margaret Bradshow. The couple had three daughters: Mary, Grace, and Blanche. Bean and his wife moved to Arizona Territory in June 1868, settling in Prescott. By October, he had opened a business office and was selling grain to the military. Bean sold corn to the military for 8¬¢/pound while buying it from local farmers for 7¬¢/pound in gold. By 1872, his operations had expanded to the point he purchased of corn from New Mexico Territory at 6¬¢/pound and transported it to Arizona via a 33‚Äëday journey by ox cart. In addition to Anglo settlers, Bean attempted to employ the indigenous population. In 1873, he advertised for any Indian \\"willing to work and earn an honest dollar\\" while searching for laborers to cut hay for Fort Verde. At the same time Bean promised to provide free vegetables if he was awarded a contract to operate a farm near Fort McDowell. In addition to hay and grain, Bean operated a ranch near Fort Verde and a sutler store. He was known to import items from St. Louis, Missouri to avoid the higher prices charged in San Francisco, California. Mining became Bean's primary business interest. After visiting a mine for the first time in January 1869, Bean began to acquire mining claims and was shipping thousands of pounds of silver ore to San Francisco by 1870. This was expanded to include several milling operations along with the acquisition and sales of mining equipment. Some of Bean's mining interests were held in the name of just him and his wife while others were held by partnerships. Among the people with which Bean partnered were John C. Fr√©mont, Charles Silent, and Thomas Fitch. In 1880, Bean began branching out into copper mining. He acquired an extensive portfolio of copper mines before selling most of them to Phelps Dodge. Politically, Bean made his first attempt to be elected Territorial Delegate in 1874. He lost the election to Hiram Sanford Stevens by a vote of 1,076 to 1,442. The race saw several abnormalities including the disqualification of 650 Bean votes by the Yavapai County Board of Supervisors which had come from the Little Colorado and Lower Lynx Creek precincts. Witnesses testified that no election had been held at the Lower Lynx Creek precinct. The Little Colorado precinct has returned 385 votes to the county seat despite witnesses claiming only 106 ballots being cast. Bean announced his intention to run for Territorial Delegate again on April 29, 1876 but withdrew his candidacy that year after being accidentally shot with his own weapon a month later. In 1878, Bean decided to run for a seat in the territorial legislature and was elected to a council (upper house) seat during the 1879 session. During the session, he lobbied for creation of the office of territorial mineralogist. Governor Fremont had proposed this position, which might have had a salary as much as $3000/year, with the possibility that the Governor might hold the newly created office in addition to his position as governor. Friends lobbied for Bean to run to become mayor of Prescott in 1880. The matter was dropped when it was realized that Bean's home being located outside of city limits made him ineligible for the position. Bean ran again for Territorial Delegate in 1884. Nominated during the territorial Republican convention on September 15, he ran on a platform that mirrored the national party platform but added a call for territorial officials to be selected from territorial residents, free public education, increased territorial control of land grants to the railroads, and reductions in the size of Indian reservations and amount spent on Indians. The Democratic challenger as Cotesworth Pinckney Head, a prominent Prescott merchant. Bean won the election by a vote of 6,747 to 5,595. Upon his arrival to the United States Congress, Bean was assigned to the United States House Committee on Mines and Mining. As a delegate, Bean secured a right of way for the Southern Pacific Railroad through the Maricopa and Pima Indian reservations. This allowed the railroad to build a spur from its main line at Maricopa to Phoenix. He was unsuccessful however in efforts to block the Harrison Act of 1886 which limited the territorial legislature's ability to grant subsidies to railroads and incur additional territorial debt. Other proposals by Bean included a reward for the capture or killing of Geronimo, adding another judge to the territorial supreme court, and incentives for creation of artesian wells. Republican's unanimously renominated Bean for a second term in 1886. The territorial platform criticized the Cleveland administration for being too pro-Wall Street, called for Union Army veterans to be given a pension, and called for a prohibition on Chinese immigration. Bean was defeated by the Democratic challenger, Marcus A. Smith, 4,472 to 6,355. Death After leaving office, Bean returned to his mining interests in Arizona. He was seen as a potential candidate for governor in 1889 but withdrew his name due to his wife's displeasure with life on the frontier and growing financial concerns. Bean moved to New York City in 1890 but maintained a legal address in Arizona. He remained his home in New York for the rest of his life but made numerous trips westward to look after his business interests. Bean died on February 1, 1904. His body was buried in Brooklyn's Green-Wood Cemetery.

Biography Don L. Short was born June 22, 1903 in Le Mars, Iowa to Hugh Connoran and Anne Otely Corkery Short. Less than a year later the family moved to North Dakota and what would become the Short Ranch. The ranch is located in Billings County, North Dakota; near the town of Medora where Short attended public schools. He also attended the St. James School in Faribault, Minnesota, and an agricultural short course at Montana State University at Bozeman. Short graduated from Pillsbury Military Academy, Owatonna, Minnesota, in 1921; and was a student at the University of Minnesota 1922-1926, where he joined Phi Kappa Psi. After attending college he returned to the Short Ranch. In 1929 he married Edith Esther Whittemore, a Medora school teacher. He made his living as a cattle rancher and farmer. Don and Edith ran the ranch with their son Con Short (Buzzie) until the former congressman's health failed in his late 70s. He developed Alzheimer's in his last few years and became more and more uncomfortable outside of Beach, ND. He was a long-time resident of Beach. He greatly enjoyed driving back and forth from Beach to the ranch in his later years to check on cattle and crops, until his death in Dickinson, N.D., on May 10, 1982. He was interred in the scenic Medora Cemetery, Medora. His gravestone is inscribed COWBOY, and sits on the top of a bluff overlooking town of Medora, next to the Medora Musical outdoor theater. While in Washington, D.C. he became friends with George H. W. Bush and Richard Nixon in his time in the House of Representatives .

He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1964 to the Eighty-ninth Congress. His defeat was attributed to the efforts of Senator Milton Young (a ND Republican Senator. Young actively and covertly worked to have Short defeated even refusing to endorse Short as he had eagerly had given his support in previous elections. Two years later, Short was asked to run for Congress again, but declined as he had moved back to tend to the ranch. The nature of Don Short's and Milt Young's dispute was money versus stewardship. Milt Young and Don Short disagreed about the need for a highway through an unspoiled piece of America's scenic national treasure, The Badlands. Short voted against building a US highway through the National Grasslands. Young disagreed with him. Short's efforts won in the long run as no US highway was ever built and the land remains unspoiled and pristine.

The phylogenetic position of Ixinandria within the tribe Loricariini remains uncertain. It has been suggested that Ixinandria could be synonym of Rineloricaria. Previously there were two species in this genus, but it was found that I. montebelloi was a synonym of I. steinbachi. Distribution The distribution of Ixinandria includes rivers of the Atlantic slope of the Andes in Bolivia and Argentina. I. steinbachi occurs in the Salado River basin. I. steinbachi occurs in Salta Province in mountainous areas at high altitudes ranging from around 1000-2900 metres (3300-9500 ft) above sea level. Appearance and anatomy Sexual dimorphism includes hypertrophied odontodes around the head margin and on the pectoral fin spines of mature males. These fish reach a length of SL. Habitat ecology I. steinbachi is a rheophilic species that lives in fast flowing and very oxygenated waters. Its color pattern reflects mimicry with stoned bottoms.

The Clan Mackenzie and possibly the Clan Munro defeated the Clan MacDonald of Lochalsh at Drumchatt (Druimchat) or \\"the Cat's Back\\", a ridge to the southeast of Strathpeffer.  Background  In 1493, the powerful chief of the Clan Donald, Sir John of Islay, lost his right to the title of Lord of the Isles when it was revoked by James IV of Scotland, having also already forfeited the title of Earl of Ross in 1475. As a result, many of the western and other northern clans, particularly the Clan MacLeod of Harris and Dunvegan, felt that they no longer had to pledge allegiance to the MacDonalds. In 1495, King James assembled an army at Glasgow. Then, on 18 May, many of the highland chiefs made their submissions to him, including those of the Clan Mackenzie and Clan Munro. This may explain the unusual alliance between the Munros and Mackenzies who were rival clans. However, while the presence of the Clan Munro at the Battle of Drumchatt in 1497 is mentioned by early 19th- century historian Donald Gregory, according to late 19th-century historian Alexander Mackenzie, the Munros are not mentioned as being present in the earliest account which was written by Sir Robert Gordon in the early 17th century. Historical accounts The earliest account of the Battle of Drumchatt of 1497 was written by Sir Robert Gordon (1580‚Äì1650) in his manuscript A Genealogical History of the Earldom of Sutherland (written in the early 17th century and published in 1813).

He > was encountered by the Mackenzies and Munroes at a place called Drumchatt, > where, after a sharp skirmish, he and his followers were again routed and > driven out of Ross.\\" Aftermath of the battle Donald Gregory also gives an account of the events in the aftermath of the battle, quoting from the MS histories of the Mackenzies and Mackintoshs: > After this event, the knight of Lochalsh proceeded southward among the > Isles, endeavouring to rouse the Islanders to arms in his behalf, but > without success owing, probably to the terror produced by the execution of > Sir John of Isla and his sons. Meantime, MacIian of Ardnamurchan, judging > this a proper opportunity of doing an acceptable service to the King, > surprised Lochalsh in the island of Ornasay, whither he had retreated, and > put him to death, In this MacIan was assisted by Alexander, the eldest > surviving son of John of Isla, with whom he had contrived to effect a > reconciliation, and to whom he had given his daughter in marriage. > Sir Alexander of Lochalsh left both sons and daughters, who afterwards fell > into the King's hands, and of whom we shall have occasion to speak in the > sequel. About the same time as the unsuccessful insurrection of which we > have just spoken, the chiefs of Mackenzie and MacKintosh made their escape > from Edinburgh Castle; but, on their way to the Highlands, they were > treacherously seized at the Torwood, by the Laird of Buchanan.

Common dishes made with Toona paste are Chinese Mahogany fried rice, Chinese Mahogany beancurd, and Chinese Mahogany mushroom soup. The timber is hard and reddish; it is valuable, used for furniture making and for bodies of electric guitars. Being a \\"true mahogany\\" (mahogany other than Swietenia), it is one of the common replacements for Swietenia mahogany (\\"genuine mahogany\\") which is now commercially restricted from being sourced natively. Outside its native region T. sinensis is valued more as a large ornamental tree for its haggard aspect.More, D. & White, J. (2003). Cassell's Trees of Britain & Northern Europe.

Culture In Chinese literature, Toona sinensis is often used for a rather extreme metaphor, with a mature tree representing a father. This manifests itself occasionally when expressing best wishes to a friend's father and mother in a letter, where one can write \\"wishing your Toona sinensis and daylily are strong and happy\\" (), with Toona sinensis metaphorically referring to the father and daylily to the mother.

Early years, education, military, legal practice  Bethune was born to Mr. and Mrs. Edwin Bethune Sr. in Pocahontas, Arkansas. He graduated in 1953 from Pocahontas High School. He was a Sergeant in the United States Marine Corps from 1954‚Äì1957, with service in South Korea. After military service, Bethune obtained his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1961 from the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville, where he was a member of the Kappa Sigma fraternity. He received the Juris Doctor degree from the University of Arkansas School of Law in 1963 and was admitted to the Arkansas bar that same year. Career That year he began his practice in Pocahontas. In 1972, while he was living in Searcy north of Little Rock, he practiced with former Arkansas Republican Party chairman Odell Pollard, who served as his political mentor. Bethune also was admitted to practice before the United States Supreme Court. He was a prosecuting attorney for the First Judicial District of Arkansas from 1970-1971. He was chairman of the Ninth District Federal Home Loan Bank Board from 1973-1976. Political career =Campaign for state attorney general, 1972= In 1972, Bethune was the unsuccessful Republican nominee for Arkansas attorney general against the Democrat James Guy Tucker Jr. Tucker defeated Bethune, 370,647 (60 percent) to 247,404 (40 percent). =Election to the U.S. House, 1978= Once in the House, Bethune made federal taxes and spending his chief concern. Bethune opposed Reagan's proposal to sell AWACS fighter planes to Saudi Arabia, which was against the advice of Israel. Bethune joined Senators Bumpers and Pryor to veto a proposal to override Arkansas' 10 percent interest ceiling for retail loans. Bethune was chosen in 1979 as the president of the U.S. House Republican freshman class. He was reelected with ease in 1980‚Äîhe polled 159,148 votes (78.9 percent) to 42,278 (21 percent) for his Democratic opponent, Jacksonville Mayor James G. Reid. =Election of 1982= In 1982, a year of widespread election of Democrats, Bethune had a harder race. He did not begin campaigning until the final three weeks of the contest, as he had been confident of winning a third term. His opponent was the Democratic former state Senator Charles Lindbergh George Sr. (born ca. 1929), from Cabot. George was not the Democrats' first choice; party leaders failed to persuade Little Rock attorney Sandy Sidney McMath (born ca. 1942), the son of the former governor, Sidney Sanders McMath, to challenge Bethune. Bethune survived the challenge and gained re-election: 96,775 (53.9 percent) to George's 82,913 (46.1 percent). It was his last election victory. =U.S. Senate campaign, 1984= In 1984, Bethune sought the Senate seat against the incumbent Senator Pryor. He was decisively defeated, with Pryor receiving 502,341 votes (57.3 percent) to Bethune's 373,615 (42.7 percent). After leaving Congress, Bethune served from 1986-1988 as the Arkansas Republican Party state Chairman. He resisted suggestions that he run for governor in 1986, and the nomination went to Frank White.

Primarily a drummer, Kirkpatrick is the principle songwriter for the band, and has played other instruments as necessary.  Career (1987-present)  Kirkpatrick started as a touring drummer for the doom metal band Trouble in 1987, and played a few shows with the group. However, he soon left Trouble as he was unable to meet its touring commitments. In 1989, he formed the group Tourniquet with Guy Ritter and Gary Lenaire. The group performed a highly progressive style of thrash and speed metal, informed by Kirkpatrick's love of classical music. The band released three albums in rapid succession, Stop the Bleeding in 1990, Psycho Surgery in 1991, and Pathogenic Ocular Dissonance in 1992. The band underwent some lineup changes and adopted a more hard rock approach for the 1994's Vanishing Lessons and 1997's Crawl to China. In the 2000s, the band returned to its thrash metal origins, and released Microscopic View of a Telescopic Realm in 2000 and Where Moth and Rust Destroy in 2003. Apart from select touring and concert appearances, Tourniquet then went mostly inactive. However, in 2010 the band announced that it was recording new material and looking for a suitable label. In 2012, the band released Antiseptic Bloodbath. Kirkpatrick also released the album Onward to Freedom, which features his drumming supported by numerous guest musicians, through Tourniquet in 2014. In addition to his work in Trouble and Tourniquet, Kirkpatrick has independently recorded and released several solo recordings, including a stoner metal album and In the Shadow of the Masters, an album where Kirkpatrick drums to various classical recordings.  Influences  As principle lyricist for the band, Kirkpatrick‚Äôs talent for allegory, symbolism, and using unusual and sometimes bizarre examples to convey Christian concepts can be found throughout the Tourniquet catalog. A fan of ethnic and world music, Ted has played or included other, less traditional (in terms of metal music) instruments on Tourniquet albums, including the Greek bouzouki, flute, banjo, and dulcimer. For the acoustic sets that Tourniquet occasionally performs, he plays 6 or 12 string guitar.

In 2010, he released a solo album, \\"Ode to a Roadkill\\", featuring animal sounds as lead \\"vocals\\".

Persian Armenia had fallen to the Arab Rashidun Caliphate by 645 CE. Byzantine Armenia was already conquered in 638‚Äì639. Background: Islamic expansion After Muhammad's death in 632, his successors started a military campaign in order to increase the territory of the new Caliphate. During the Muslim conquests, the Arabs conquered most of the Middle East. Sources The details of the early conquest of Armenia by the Arabs are uncertain, as the various Arabic, Greek, and Armenian sources contradict each other. The main sources for the period are the eyewitness account of the Armenian bishop Sebeos, along with the history of the 8th- century Armenian priest ≈Åewond. The Arabic historians al-Tabari and Ya'qubi also provide information about the period, but the main source is the 9th- century scholar al-Baladhuri, who, unusually for a Muslim writer, included much information drawn from local accounts from Armenia. Arab raids and conquest of Armenia According to the Arabic sources, the first Arab expedition reached Armenia in 639/640, on the heels of their conquest of the Levant from the Byzantines and the start of the Muslim conquest of Persia. The Arabs were led by Iyad ibn Ghanim, who had previously conquered Upper Mesopotamia, and penetrated as far as Bitlis. A second expedition occurred in 642, when the Muslim army advanced divided into four corps up to northeastern Armenia, only to be defeated and pushed out of the country. After this setback, the Arabs only undertook a raid from Adharbayjan in 645, led by Salman ibn Rabi'a, but this only touched the Armenian borderlands. It was not until 645/646 that a major campaign to subdue the country was undertaken by Mu'awiya, the governor of Syria. Mu'awiya's general Habib ibn Maslama al-Fihri first moved against the Byzantine portion of the country: he besieged and captured Theodosiopolis (present-day Erzurum, Turkey) and defeated a Byzantine army, reinforced with Khazar and Alan troops, on the Euphrates. He then turned towards Lake Van, where the local Armenian princes of Akhlat and Moks submitted, allowing Habib to march onto Dvin, the capital of the former Persian portion of Armenia. Dvin capitulated after a few days of siege, as did Tiflis further north in Caucasian Iberia. During the same time, another Arab army from Iraq, under Salman ibn Rabi'a, conquered Caucasian Albania (Arran). The Armenian sources however provide a different narrative, both in chronology and in the details of the events, although the broad thrust of the Arab campaigns is consistent with the Muslim sources. The Armenian historians report that the Arabs first arrived in 642, penetrating up to the central region of Ayrarat, and sacked Dvin, returning with over 35,000 captives. In 643, the Arabs invaded again, from the direction of Adharbayjan, ravaged Ayrarat and reached Iberia, but were defeated in battle by the Armenian leader Theodore Rshtuni and forced back. After this success, Rshtuni was recognized as ruler of Armenia by the Byzantine emperor Constans II. At some point soon after, the Armenians recognized Byzantine suzerainty. When Constans' truce with the Arabs ended in 653, however, and a new Arab invasion became likely, Rshtuni voluntarily agreed to submit to Muslim overlordship. In response, Emperor Constans in person led an army of reportedly 100,000 men into Armenia. The local princes rallied to him, and both Armenia and Iberia returned to Byzantine allegiance. After spending the winter in Dvin, Constans left in spring 654. Almost immediately an Arab army invaded and captured the regions on the northern shore of Lake Van. With their assistance, Rshtuni evicted the Byzantine garrisons from Armenia, and secured Arab recognition as presiding prince of Armenia, Iberia, and Albania. The Byzantines under general Maurianos tried to recover control of the region, but without success. In 655, even Byzantine Armenia was invaded, and the Arabs occupied Theodosiopolis (Arabic Qaliqala) and cemented their control of the country by taking Rhstuni to Damascus, where he died in 656, and appointing his rival Hamazasp Mamikonian in his stead. However, with the outbreak of the First Muslim Civil War in 657, effective Arab authority in the country ceased, and Mamikonian returned to Byzantine overlordship almost immediately. These events are merged into the single campaign of 645/646 in the Arabic sources, who omit any detail about the internal affairs of Armenia or the recognition of Byzantine suzerainty there, and portray the country as being firmly under Arab suzerainty since Habib al-Fihri's campaign. Modern historians generally consider the contemporary account of Sebeos (which is partly corroborated by the Byzantine chronicler Theophanes the Confessor) to be more reliable, and have proposed different reconstructions of the early Arab raids between 640 and 650, based on a critical reading of the sources; it is clear, however, that the country did not submit to Arab rule at this time. In 661, however, Mu'awiya, now the victor of the Muslim civil war, ordered the Armenian princes to re-submit to his authority and pay tribute. In order to avoid another war, the princes complied. Armenia within the Caliphate Theodorus Rshtuni and other Armenian nakharars (lords) accepted Arab rule over Armenia. Constans II, the Byzantine Emperor, sent occasional reinforcements to Armenia, but they were inadequate. The commander of the city of Dvin, Smbat, confronted by the fact that he could no longer hold out against the Islamic army, submitted to Caliph Omar, consenting to pay him tribute. In 644, Omar was assassinated by a Persian slave and was replaced by Caliph Uthman. The Armenian acceptance of Arab rule irritated the Byzantines. Emperor Constans sent his men to Armenia in order to impose the Chalcedonian creed of Christianity. He did not succeed in his doctrinal objective, but the new Armenian prefect, Hamazasp, who regarded the taxes imposed by the Muslims as too heavy, yielded to the Emperor. Armenia remained under Arab rule for approximately 200 years, formally starting in 645 CE. Through many years of Umayyad and Abbasid rule, the Armenian Christians benefited from political autonomy and relative religious freedom, but were considered second-class citizens (dhimmi status). This was, however, not the case in the beginning. The invaders first tried to force the Armenians to accept Islam, prompting many citizens to flee to Byzantine-held Armenia, which the Muslims had largely left alone due to its rugged and mountainous terrain. The policy also caused several uprisings until the Armenian Church finally enjoyed greater recognition even more than it experienced under Byzantine or Sassanid jurisdiction. The Caliph assigned Ostikans as governors and representatives, who sometimes were of Armenian origin. The first ostikan, for example, was Theodorus Rshtuni. However, the commander of the 15,000-strong army was always of Armenian origin, often from the Mamikonian, Bagratuni or Artsruni families, with the Rshtuni family having the highest number of troops at 10,000. He would either defend the country from foreigners, or assist the Caliph in his military expeditions. For example, the Armenians helped the Caliphate against Khazar invaders. Arab rule was interrupted by many revolts whenever Arabs attempted to enforce Islam, or higher taxes (jizya) to the people of Armenia. However, these revolts were sporadic and intermittent. They never had a pan-Armenian character. Arabs used rivalries between the different Armenian nakharars in order to curb the rebellions. Thus, the Mamikonian, Rshtuni, Kamsarakan and Gnuni families were gradually weakened in favor of the Bagratuni and Artsruni families. The rebellions led to the creation of the legendary character, David of Sassoun. During Islamic rule, Arabs from other parts of the Caliphate settled in Armenia. By the 9th century, there was a well-established class of Arab emirs, more or less equivalent to the Armenian nakharars. At the end of this period, in 885, the Bagratid Kingdom of Armenia was established with Ashot I, a Christian king, as the first monarch. The Byzantine Empire and the Abbassid Caliphate's willingness to recognize the existence of the kingdom stemmed from the need to maintain a buffer state between them. Particularly for the Caliphate, Armenia was more desirable as a buffer rather than a province due to the threat of the Khazars, who were allied with Byzantium. Ashot's regime and those who succeeded him ushered in a period of peace, artistic growth, and literary activity. This era is referred to as the second Armenian Golden Age and is manifested in the magnificent churches built and the illustrated manuscripts created during the period.

Late in life Livernash adopted the French form of the family name, de Nivernais, by decree of court. Livernash was born in Lower Calaveritas, a California mining camp near San Andreas, to an Irish mother and a father of French-Canadian descent, and attended the common schools of California. He became a printer at the age of fifteen, and a year later founded a country newspaper at Cloverdale, California. He studied law in preparation for journalism, and in 1887 was admitted to the California bar. In 1891, he joined the staff of the San Francisco Examiner and held various editorial posts there. In 1897 Livernash was sent by the Klondike miners as commissioner to the Dominion of Canada to urge a modification of onerous laws. in 1904, Livernash ran for Congress to represent California's 4th congressional district (San Francisco) in the Fifty-eighth Congress (March 4, 1903 ‚Äì March 3, 1905) on a Democratic and Union Labor ticket. The dual nomination was unusual, and under then-prevailing California law, Livernash was required to choose which nomination would appear on the ballot; however, in October 1902 the California Supreme Court held that the provision limiting the ballot entry to a single nomination was not valid, and allowed both designations to appear. Livernash's opponents in the election were the incumbent, Republican Julius Kahn; Socialist Party candidate William Costly; and Prohibition Party candidate Joseph Rowell. Livernash received 16,146 (49.17%) of the votes cast, compared to 16,005 (48.74%) cast for Kahn, with Costly and Rowell picking up the remaining 2.09%. Kahn contested the election, charging that many of the votes in Livernash's plurality were illegally cast, but the election was upheld. Livernash served only one term, losing his reelection bid to Kahn in 1904. He became the managing editor of the Rocky Mountain News in 1906, but resigned after only thirteen weeks after coming under criticism from Senator Thomas M. Patterson for an editorial published in December 1906. Livernash resided in France from 1909 to 1912, when he returned to the United States and settled near Belmont, California. He engaged in study and literary pursuits. Livernash died in Agnew, California on June 1, 1938. His remains were cremated at Cypress Lawn Cemetery in Colma, California.

He was City Auditor of Denver 1899-1901.In 1903 he was a member of the first convention elected to draft a charter for the city of Denver.

In the Sixty-fifth Congress, Keating was chairman of the Committee on Expenditures in the Post Office Department. He was unsuccessful in his bid for reelection in 1918. In 1916, along with Robert Owen, sponsored a bill called the Keating‚ÄìOwen Child Labor Act of 1916,which barred the interstate commerce of goods produced by children. Shortly after the act went into effect it was declared unconstitutional; nevertheless, it is regarded as a historic landmark in the story of the regulation of child labor in the United States. Several states already had child labor laws but these varied widely. Although bills regulating child labor had been introduced in previous congressional sessions they did not pass. The Keating-Owen bill was the first to become a law and thus became the first federal intervention in the tackling of the child labor problem. (Later many of the provisions of the Keating-Owen Act were incorporated into other labor legislation which was upheld by the Supreme Court.) In April, 1917, Keating was one of fifty Congressman that voted against the House Resolution for War against Germany.

Life  Tansey worked to develop a \\"universal\\" slide classification scheme that would serve the needs of both catalogers and patrons. Co-authored by Wendell Simons, it was published in 1969 under the title, A slide classification system for the organization and automatic indexing of interdisciplinary collections of slides and pictures. Created mostly during her tenure at the University of California, Santa Cruz in the late 1960s-early 1970s, this system is still in use at UCSC and other institutions and is known as the Tansey or Santa Cruz system. This system was also built with computer indexing in mind. Tansey worked with the College Art Association (CAA) for the benefit of librarians and image librarians. Her work contributed to the eventual founding of two professional societies, the Art Libraries Society of North America (ARLIS/NA) and the Visual Resources Association (VRA). In 1993 she received both the VRA and ARLIS/NA's Distinguished Service Awards. In 1993, Tansey underwrote the VRA Travel Awards Program; several Luraine Tansey Travel Awards are still awarded each year. Luraine Tansey worked on several lectures and publications throughout the 1970‚Äôs.

She also assisted her husband, Dr. Richard Tansey, with editing five editions of Gardner's Art Through the Ages as a bibliographer, and she worked on the index in Cohen‚Äôs Study Guide for Art through the Ages. Luraine Tansey had a multidisciplinary approach to the visual world. She was a talented classical violinist who could pick up a tune and accompany anyone. She was an avid photographer, particularly of nature, and was acquainted with several of the major West Coast photographers including Imogen Cunningham, Roy Partridge, and Edward Weston. She was a precocious illustrator of human character and action and a committed painter of landscapes in California and New England. From a young age she was interested in how materials and images could be regarded and transformed to impart knowledge. Her father, Merle Collins, had a tool shop where he made all sorts of things from lamps and desks to toys. He taught her how to craft things out of wood, clay, paper, leather, metals, and a range of things found in nature. Luraine internalized a fascination with making things which she shared with her family. This transformative visual sensibility is part of the inspirational basis for her son, Mark Tansey‚Äôs painting, ‚ÄúThe Bricoleur‚Äôs daughter.‚Äù Although her breakthrough image classification system and her work with the Visual Resources Association are what she is best known for, her lifelong passion was early childhood education.

The problem consists in the maintenance, i.e., keeping track, of the convex hull for input data undergoing a sequence of discrete changes, i.e., when input data elements may be inserted, deleted, or modified. It should be distinguished from the kinetic convex hull, which studies similar problems for continuously moving points. Dynamic convex hull problems may be distinguished by the types of the input data and the allowed types of modification of the input data. Planar point set It is easy to construct an example for which the convex hull contains all input points, but after the insertion of a single point the convex hull becomes a triangle. And conversely, the deletion of a single point may produce the opposite drastic change of the size of the output. Therefore, if the convex hull is required to be reported in traditional way as a polygon, the lower bound for the worst- case computational complexity of the recomputation of the convex hull is \\\\Omega(N), since this time is required for a mere reporting of the output. This lower bound is attainable, because several general-purpose convex hull algorithms run in linear time when input points are ordered in some way and logarithmic-time methods for dynamic maintenance of ordered data are well- known. This problem may be overcome by eliminating the restriction on the output representation. There are data structures that can maintain representations of the convex hull in an amount of time per update that is much smaller than linear. For many years the best algorithm of this type was that of Overmars and van Leeuwen (1981), which took time O(log2 n) per update, but it has since been improved by Timothy M. Chan and others. In a number of applications finding the convex hull is a step in an algorithm for the solution of the overall problem. The selected representation of the convex hull may influence on the computational complexity of further operations of the overall algorithm. For example, the point in polygon query for a convex polygon represented by the ordered set of its vertices may be answered in logarithmic time, which would be impossible for convex hulls reported by the set of it vertices without any additional information. Therefore, some research of dynamic convex hull algorithms involves the computational complexity of various geometric search problems with convex hulls stored in specific kinds of data structures. The mentioned approach of Overmars and van Leeuwen allows for logarithmic complexity of various common queries. References     *.

It first appeared in December 1835 before being included in the collection Twice-Told Tales in 1837. Plot synopsis In the White Mountains, a band of eight adventurers gathers together. They are each on a personal quest for the Great Carbuncle, a brilliant gem legendary in its elusiveness. The adventurers are as follows: *The Seeker: a man sixty years of age who has sought the Carbuncle nearly his entire life. He says when he finds the Carbuncle he will die alongside it. *Doctor Cacaphodel: a European chemist. He intends to analyze the Carbuncle and publish his findings. *Master Ichabod Pigsnort: a merchant, who wishes to sell the Carbuncle to the highest bidder. *The Cynic: a bespectacled man with a constant sneer. He considers the hopes of the other adventurers futile and makes derisive comments about them. His goal is to prove that the Carbuncle does not exist by searching everywhere for it. *The Poet: He hopes the Carbuncle will bring him inspiration. *Lord de Vere: a wealthy prince, who wants to use the Carbuncle's brilliance as a symbol of his family's greatness for posterity. *Matthew and Hannah: newlyweds, who wish to use the gem as a light in their household and as a conversation piece. The next morning, Matthew and Hannah wake up realizing that the others have left before them. Even though they fear they have lost the Carbuncle, they take their time in preparing for their morning's adventure. As they begin to climb a great mountain, they find themselves surrounded by the mists at its peak and fear that they will become lost. Spying a great red brilliance, though, they realize that the Carbuncle must be near and find it atop a cliff overlooking a lake. At the base of the cliff lies the Seeker, who has already died trying to reach the gem. The Cynic approaches and claims that he cannot see the Carbuncle; at Matthew's urging, he removes his spectacles and is permanently blinded by its brilliance. Matthew and Hannah decide to leave it where it is, knowing that it will overwhelm everything else in the world, and lead the Cynic down the mountain. The story closes with an account of the other searchers' fortunes after this adventure: * Pigsnort loses his fortune due to capture by Indians and the failure of his business. * Cacaphodel analyzes a piece of ordinary granite from the mountain and publishes his findings - as extensive as they would have been if he had used the Carbuncle itself - in a European scientific journal. * The Poet finds a piece of ice, which he claims is a perfect match for his idea of the Carbuncle, and is inspired by it to write bleak, cold verses. * De Vere spends his life pondering his ancestors' greatness; when he dies, he is laid to rest among them with only torches to highlight his vanity. * The Cynic wanders the world in desperate search of any light that he can perceive, and eventually dies in the Great Fire of London. * Matthew and Hannah live a long and peaceful life together, often telling the tale of their search. Conflicting reports begin to spread as to the fate of the Carbuncle. Some accounts claim that it lost its luster and became an ordinary stone; others contend that it fell into the lake, and that the Seeker's spirit can sometimes be seen bending down toward it. A few people believe that the Carbuncle still retains its original glory and venture into the mountains after it - and the narrator reveals that he is one of them. Publication history Hawthorne was informed by a trip to Vermont and New Hampshire beginning in September 1832. \\"The Great Carbuncle\\" was published in the December 1835 issue of the New- England Magazine as the second (and final) installment of his series \\"Sketches from Memory, By a Pedestrian\\", after \\"The Ambitious Guest\\" in the previous issue.Mellow, James R. Nathaniel Hawthorne in His Times. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1980: 51. . Analysis Hawthorne explores the importance of honesty, simplicity, and selflessness in \\"The Great Carbuncle.\\" These positive characteristics are most often demonstrated by Hannah and Matthew during the search for the Carbuncle; they sacrifice personal gain, alter their goals, and pivot their actions to assist others for the good of the group. By contrast, characters' selfish motivations and greed elicit negative results. Each character has their own fantasy related to the stone: Dr. Cacaphodel wants to publish his findings for profit, the cynic wants to prove that he's right, and the Poet wanted to keep it to insure his writing. Each of these characters meet a different tragic fate related to what they desired to use the stone for. The story reinforces Hawthorne's value of selflessness and simplicity as opposed to selfishness and greed. This story also suggests that hard work and determination do not guarantee success. Though most of the characters are experts in their given fields, their knowledge does not help them at all.

It is a birth defect or congenital abnormality of the female genitourinary system. Signs and symptoms Vaginal hypoplasia can vary in severity from being smaller than normal to being completely absent.The absence of a vagina is a result of vaginal agenesis. Diagnostically, it may look similar to a vaginal obstruction such as can be caused by an imperforate hymen or, less commonly, a transverse vaginal septum. It is frequently associated with Mayer-Rokitansky-K√ºstner-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, in which the most common result is an absent uterus in conjunction with a deformed or missing vagina, despite the presence of normal ovaries and normal external genitalia. It is also associated with cervical agenesis, in which the uterus is present but the uterine cervix is absent.The situation is most urgent where there is a menstruating uterus with an obstructed uterovaginal outflow, leading to hematometra. In this case prompt medical action is required. Causes The main causes are M√ºllerian agenesis and complete androgen insensitivity syndrome. Treatment Inflatable vaginal expander ZSI 200 NS ZSI 200 NS vaginal expander stretching the female vagina In order to facilitate sexual intercourse, the main treatments are self-dilation methods (using intra- vaginal cylinders or inflatable expanders (vaginal stents) of increasing size) and surgical vaginoplasty to lengthen the vagina. Self-dilation has a high success rate, estimated at 75%, and is usually the first-line treatment due to low surgical invasiveness. Overall, the complication rates are significantly lower with dilation than with vaginoplasty. Surgery is indicated when there is inability or reluctance to perform self-dilation, or where it is performed but with failed result. The vaginoplasty is performed around the inflatable expander which maintains the neovagina against the pelvic wall after the surgery and favors the process of microscopic neovascularization while reducing the risks for hematoma. One appropriate surgical variant is the Vecchietti technique. In this procedure, an olive-shaped pressure device is pressed towards the potential vaginal space by a thread that goes through the skin, behind the urinary bladder and pubic bone and exits the skin in the hypogastrium, where it is attached to a plate that provides counter-traction. Vaginoplasty can also be performed using a skin graft or an intestinal graft. Traction vaginoplasty such as the Vecchietti technique seems to have the highest success rates both anatomically (99%) and functionally (96%), whereas skin graft procedures and intestinal procedures have the lowest successful outcomes (83‚Äì95%). After vaginoplasty, available evidence suggests that continued self-dilation is needed to maintain the patency in periods of coital inactivity. A vaginal expander can be used regularly to prevent post-operative vaginal retraction. Epidemiology Vaginal hypoplasia is estimated to occur in 1 in 4,000‚Äì5,000 live female births. It is often unnoticed until adolescence when pain and a lack of menstrual flow indicates the condition.

Career She became known as one of the first Azerbaijani musicians to perform mugham (an Azeri folk music genre) on piano. In 1919, Gayibova moved to Baku with her family. She was one of the founders of the Azerbaijan State Conservatory in 1920. After Sovietization, she became head of the Department of Oriental Music in the Azerbaijan People's Commissariat for Education.Ganjali, Sabir. Woman, Beauty and Sanctity. Azerbaijan Nashriyyati. Baku: 2001; p. 154-155 During this period, Gayibova organized short-term piano and drama classes for women. In 1927, she was admitted to the Azerbaijan State Conservatoire specialising as a composer. First arrest In 1933, Gayibova was arrested and incarcerated allegedly for espionage and counter-revolutionary activity. She was released three months later and the charges were dropped due to lack of evidence. In the following year she was employed by the Azerbaijan State Conservatoire to research Azerbaijan's folk musical heritage. Second arrest and death Outgoing and social, the Gayibovins held musical \\"salons\\" for foreign visitors, many from Turkey, and also attracting musicians, poets, writers, academics, and artists to gather there. The salons began to come to the attention of Soviet authorities who viewed them in a political context, suspecting relations with the Turkish government. On 17 March 1938, shortly after her husband's second arrest, Gayibova, now a target for spy allegations, was arrested once again and accused of maintaining links with the Musavat party. For the next five weeks, she was interrogated nine times, until found guilty on the charges of espionage. Gayibova did not plead guilty and according to her former fellow inmate Zivar Afandiyeva (wife of executed statesman Sultan Majid Afandiyev), while incarcerated, she believed that she would be exiled to Siberia at most. However, on 19 October 1938, after a 15-minute final court hearing, Gayibova was sentenced to execution by firing squad. The sentence was carried out at Baku. Exoneration In 1956, at the request of Gayibova's daughter Alangu Sultanova, Gayibova's case was reviewed, and she was officially exonerated. References External links *Aida Huseynova.

He is also suspected of committing two further murders in October 1941. Convicted of the murder of 34-year-old Evelyn Oatley, Cummins was sentenced to death for her murder and was hanged at HMP Wandsworth on 25 June 1942. Cummins became known as the \\"Blackout Killer\\" and the \\"Blackout Ripper\\" due to the fact he committed his murders during the imposed wartime blackout and because of the extensive mutilations inflicted upon three of his victims' bodies. He is also known as the \\"Wartime Ripper\\" as his murders were committed at the height of World War II. The murders committed by Gordon Cummins have been described by one Detective Superintendent within the Metropolitan Police as \\"by far the most vicious\\" he ever investigated during his entire career. Early life Gordon Frederick Cummins was born in New Earswick, North Yorkshire on 18 February 1914,The Murders of the Black Museum: 1870-1970 p. 372 the first of three children born to John Cummins and his wife Amelia, n√©e Lee. Cummins's father was a civil servant who ran a school for delinquent youths; his mother was a housewife. As a child, Cummins received a private education in Llandovery, South Wales, although contemporary reports from his years at the Llandovery County Intermediate Secondary School describe his academic performance as unremarkable, with teachers later recollecting Cummins was much more preoccupied with socialising than his studies. Nonetheless, Cummins did obtain a diploma in Chemistry at age sixteen. After completing his schooling in 1930, Cummins attended Northampton College of Technology. He abandoned his studies on November 1, 1932.In the Dark: The True Story of the Blackout Ripper p. 256 At age 18, Cummins relocated to Newcastle, where he briefly worked as an industrial chemist. He was dismissed from this job after five months. In August 1933, Cummins obtained employment as a tanner in Northampton, although he was fired from this employment for poor timekeeping after thirteen months,The Murders of the Black Museum: 1870-1970 p. 372 thereafter alternating between part-time work and casual labour. In October 1934, Cummins relocated to London, obtaining a job as a leather dresser in a clothing factory, earning ¬£3 a week. He later trained to become a foreman at this firm. While residing in London, Cummins developed a desire to live the life of an aristocrat. He frequented hotels and clubs in the West End of London, falsely claiming to acquaintances to be the illegitimate son of a peer and also claiming to receive an allowance from this fabled individual. To support this contention, Cummins refined his accent to imitate that of an Oxfordian, and insisted on being referred to as the Honourable Gordon Cummins. He also frequently engaged in acts of theft or embezzlement to financially maintain this facade, and regularly bragged to colleagues of his sexual excursions with local women.The Murders of the Black Museum: 1870-1970 p. 372 To his employers, his extravagant lifestyle impacted his work performance, and he was fired from his job on 8 February 1935. Shortly thereafter, Cummins moved into his brother's flat in Queens Mews, Bayswater, as he considered his next career move.In the Dark: The True Story of the Blackout Ripper p. 257 =Royal Air Force= In early 1935, Cummins volunteered to join the Royal Air Force (RAF). He enlisted at the Air Crew Reception Centre in Regent's Park, London, where both serving members of the RAF and new recruits were assessed for training. Cummins initially trained as a rigger, tasked with undertaking flight checks on aircraft. His superiors considered Cummins to be an ambitious individual, although he was not popular among many of his fellow servicemen, who resented his boastful attitude and claims to hail from nobility. These false claims to hail from an aristocratic background earned Cummins the derogatory nickname \\"the Duke\\". In May 1936, he became acquainted with Marjorie Stevens, the secretary of a West End theatre producer. The two first met at an Empire Air Day air show in the village of Henlow.In the Dark: The True Story of the Blackout Ripper p. 113 Following a seven month courtship, the couple married at the Paddington Register Office on 28 December. The couple had no children.The Murders of the Black Museum: 1870-1970 p. 372 Initially, Cummins was stationed with the Marine and Armament Experimental Establishment at Felixstowe, Suffolk. Between 1936 and 1939, he relocated with this military research and test organisation to Scotland. On 25 October 1939, shortly after the outbreak of World War II, Cummins was transferred to Helensburgh, Dumbartonshire.In the Dark: The True Story of the Blackout Ripper p. 114 He remained stationed in Dumbartonshire until April 1941, when he was posted to Colerne, Wiltshire. At this posting, Cummins reached the junior rank of leading aircraftman, although he held aspirations to become a Spitfire pilot. On 10 November 1941, Cummins was posted to Cornwall. At this new posting, his braggadocio among his fellow airmen earned him the nickname \\"the Count\\". While stationed in Cornwall, Cummins joined a Falmouth social club named The Blue Peter Club, and occasionally assisted the proprietess by tending the bar. However, he was relieved of his bartending duties within weeks when found to be serving free drinks to RAF personnel. Shortly thereafter, the proprietess discovered that approximately ¬£35 worth of jewellery had been stolen from her apartment. Although both the proprietess and local police suspected Cummins of committing this theft, no evidence existed to prove his guilt.The Blackout Murders: The Shocking True Story p. 117 The following January, having by this time accrued over 1,000 hours of flight experience,The Blackout Murders: The Shocking True Story p. 117 he appeared before the Royal Air Force selection board to take an aviation exam.In the Dark: The True Story of the Blackout Ripper p. 118 His exemplary performance earned him a transfer to the Air Crew Receiving Centre in Regent's Park, where he was to be stationed with 300 other men. Cummins was ordered to report for duty at 10 a.m. on 2 February 1942.Foul Deeds and Suspicious Deaths in Hampstead, Holburn and St Pancras pp. 143-144 Murders Cummins is known to have murdered at least four womenThe New Murderers' Who's Who p. 102 and to have attempted to murder two others over a period of six days in February 1942. He is also suspected of murdering two further women in October 1941.

His first suspected victim was a 19-year-old clerk named Maple Church, who was murdered on 13 October. Church is known to have frequently engaged in casual sexual relations with servicemen.Coroner, the Biography of Sir Bentley Purchase p. 117 Her nude body was found by workmen in a bombed house on Hampstead Road the day after her murder. She had been strangled to death with her own camiknickers by an individual described by the pathologist who examined her body as being a left- handed individual, as the bruising around Church's neck indicated her murderer had more strength in his left hand than his right. In addition, her handbag had been emptied, with several contents missing.The Murders of the Black Museum: 1870-1970 pp. 375-376 Church had not been subjected to a sexual assault. Her death is believed to have occurred at approximately 9:15 p.m. Four days later, on 17 October, a 48-year-old widow named Edith Eleanora Humphries was found lying upon her bed at her Regent's Park home. She had been extensively bludgeoned about the face and head before her assailant had attempted to strangle her before cutting her throat. Humphries had also suffered a single stab wound to her skull, which had penetrated her brain. Humphries was still alive, but died shortly after her admission to hospital. The door to her property was ajar, and investigators found no signs of a forced entry to her home. Several items of jewellery had been stolen. At the time of these two murders, Cummins was stationed in Colerne, Wiltshire, although when on leave, he is known to have frequently visited London, residing at an address in nearby St John's Wood.Murder Files from Scotland Yard and the Black Museum p. 194 =Blackout murders= On Sunday 8 February 1942, Cummins left an RAF establishment in St John's Wood to visit his wife at the flat they rented in Southwark. As the couple ate dinner, Cummins asked whether he could borrow some money with the explanation he intended to visit the West End for a \\"night on the town\\".The Murders of the Black Museum: 1870-1970 p. 372 Marjorie gave her husband a pound note (the equivalent of approximately ¬£47 ). Cummins left his home shortly after 6:30 p.m.The Blackout Murders: The Shocking True Story p. 118 Evelyn Margaret Hamilton The air raids upon London and other British cities throughout World War II resulted in enforced nighttime blackout measures The following morning, the body of 41-year-old pharmacist Evelyn Hamilton was discovered by an electrician named Harold Batchelor in a street-level air raid shelter in Montagu Place, Marylebone. Her clothes had been disarranged and her scarf wound about her head. Scuff marks on her shoes and broken sections of mortar scattered near her body indicated Hamilton had fiercely struggled with her attacker, who had raised her skirt above her hips, pulled her underwear below knee level, and exposed her right breast.The Blackout Murders: The Shocking True Story p. 4 Her handbag‚Äîcontaining approximately ¬£80‚Äîhad been stolen, although some of the contents were found strewn about the pavement outside the air raid shelter. Hamilton's empty handbag was later found by a police officer on nearby Wyndham Street. No fingerprints were recovered from any of her possessions. Her body was identified by her landlady, Catherine Jones, on 10 February.The Blackout Murders: The Shocking True Story p. 44 The day prior to her murder, Hamilton had resigned from her position managing a Hornchurch chemists, which had experienced financial hardships due to the onset of the war, and travelled to London via train. At 6:40 p.m. on 8 February, she is known to have informed a Mrs. Maud Yoxall of her plans to leave London and travel to Lincolnshire the following day, as she had been offered a manageress position at a pharmacy in Grimsby. She was last seen alive by a waitress at the Maison Lyons Corner House in Marble Arch shortly before midnight, drinking a glass of white wine to celebrate her 41st birthday. The location of her body led investigators to conclude she had been either accosted or attacked as she walked back to her boardinghouse in the early hours of the following morning.The Blackout Murders: The Shocking True Story p. 49 Hamilton's post- mortem revealed she had been manually strangled by a left-handed individual. She had not been sexually assaulted or mutilated, although numerous small cuts and scratches had been inflicted to her right breast and a cut measuring one inch had been inflicted to her left eyebrow. Evelyn Oatley Shortly after 8:30 a.m. on 10 February, two meter readers discovered the naked and mutilated body of 34-year-old Evelyn Oatley lying upon her bed in her flat at 153 Wardour Street, Soho.In the Dark: The True Story of the Blackout Ripper p. 265 She had been beaten about the mouth and chest, then strangled into unconsciousness before a six-inch cut had been inflicted to her throat, severing her right carotid artery.The Blackout Murders: The Shocking True Story p. 58 Oatley's head hung over the edge of her bed. Her abdomen, genitals and thighs had been extensively sexually mutilated with a safety razor blade and a tin opener after death. Six of these wounds had been inflicted around her vaginal cavity, the jagged nature of which suggested they had been inflicted with the tin opener. Oatley had also been sexually violated with an electric torch, which protruded from her vagina.In the Dark: The True Story of the Blackout Ripper p. 249 A pair of blood-smeared curling tongs was also found close to her body, and a bloodstained razor blade lay to the left of her head. In addition, the contents of Oatley's leather handbag were strewn across the floor of her bedroom, and seven unused Gillette safety razor blades were recovered from the small nightstand beside her bed. The door to her apartment had been closed, but not locked.The Blackout Murders: The Shocking True Story p. 57 No defensive wounds were found upon Oatley's hands, nails or arms. Evelyn Oatley Detective Chief Superintendent Frederick Cherrill was able to determine that fingerprints recovered from the bloodstained tin opener and upon the corner of a broken section of mirror found within Oatley's leather handbag which had also been used to mutilate her body indicated that her murderer was a left-handed individual.Fingerprints Never Lie: The Autobiography of Fred Cherrill p. 187 No match for this set of fingerprints could be found within the police fingerprint bureau, indicating Oatley's murderer had no police record. Oatley was a married woman who, at the outbreak of World War II, had turned to prostitution, using the alias Leta Ward, to supplement the income she earned as a nightclub hostess. Three eyewitness later informed investigators Oatley had been approached by a young, clean- shaven and moustachioed airman with chestnut brown hair, approximately () in height, outside a restaurant in Shaftesbury Avenue late in the evening prior to her murder. According to these witnesses, when Oatley had asked this individual what his sexual preferences were, he had simply replied, \\"I like blondes.\\"The Blackout Murders: The Shocking True Story p. 36 Oatley was last seen alive by a fellow tenant of 153 Wardour Street named Ivy Poole, who observed her enter the stairwell to the property in the company of this individual at approximately 11:40 p.m. According to Poole, shortly after midnight, she was awoken by the sudden increase in the volume of Oatley's wireless. She did not investigate this disturbance.The Blackout Murders: The Shocking True Story p. 38 Margaret Florence Lowe In the early hours of Wednesday, 11 February, a 43-year-old prostitute named Margaret Florence LoweMurder Files from Scotland Yard and the Black Museum p. 191 was murdered in her flat at 11 Gosfield Street, Marylebone.The Story of Soho: The Windmill Years 1932-1964 p. 35 She was last seen alive by a neighbour named Florence Bartolini at approximately 1:15 a.m. walking along the corridor to her flat in the company of a client. Bartolini later heard the man exit Lowe's flat, walk down the corridor and onto Gosfield Street, whistling to himself.The Blackout Murders: The Shocking True Story p. 131 Lowe's body remained undiscovered until the afternoon of 13 February, when her 15-year-old daughter, Barbara, visited her mother only to be told by a neighbour her mother had not been seen for \\"two or three days\\" and that a parcel had remained unclaimed outside her door for the same length of time.In the Dark: The True Story of the Blackout Ripper p. 141 Lowe lay upon her bed beneath the quilts, which were raised to beneath her chin. She lay upon her back with her legs apart and her knees bent upwards. She had been extensively beaten,In the Dark: The True Story of the Blackout Ripper p. 195 then strangled to death upon her divan bed with a silk stocking which was still knotted beneath the right side of her jaw. Froth was visible around her nose and mouth.The Blackout Murders: The Shocking True Story p. 179 Upon examining Lowe's body, Forensic pathologist Sir Bernard Spilsbury remarked that the injuries inflicted by her murderer were \\"quite dreadful\\", adding that the perpetrator was \\"a savage sexual maniac\\" who \\"indulged in a wicked lust to perpetrate the most diabolical injuries on the women he killed\\". The mutilations inflicted to Lowe surpassed the savagery of those her murderer had inflicted upon Oatley, with some mutilations inflicted while the victim had still been alive, although at the point of death. Her body had been extensively slashed and mutilated with a variety of implements including a razor blade, a vegetable knife, a table knife, and a poker, all of which were found protruding from or beside her body. Her abdomen had been opened, exposing her internal organs,The Blackout Murders: The Shocking True Story p. 179 with one further wound inflicted to the right side of her groin being \\"a deep, gaping wound\\" measuring ten inches in length.In the Dark: The True Story of the Blackout Ripper p. 179 A large serrated bread knife protruded from a wound close to Lowe's groin, a wax candle had also been inserted six inches into her vagina, and her uterus had been slashed. Spilsbury was also able to determine the injuries inflicted to Lowe's body left little doubt her murderer had also been responsible for the death of Evelyn Oatley. Forensic experts recovered fingerprints from the base of a glass candlestick holder standing upon the bedroom mantlepiece, plus a glass tumbler, and a half-drunk bottle of Hammerton's oatmeal stout also found at the crime scene.In the Dark: The True Story of the Blackout Ripper p. 181 The fingerprints upon the glass candlestick holder were found to belong to the perpetrator's right hand, indicating the perpetrator was left-handed. Lowe was a widowed mother of one who hailed from Southend-on-Sea. Following the death of her husband in 1932, Lowe had sold the family fancy-goods business. She later enrolled her daughter in a boarding school before relocating alone to London, where she obtained employment as a bousecleaner in 1934. Shortly thereafter, using the alias Peggy Campbell, she began to engage in prostitution, although every third weekend, Barbara would travel to London from Southend via train to visit her mother, and Lowe would devote her weekend to social activities such as visiting the cinema and local landmarks with her daughter.The Blackout Murders: The Shocking True Story p. 175 Catherine Mulcahy On Thursday, 12 February, Cummins accosted a 25-year-old prostitute named Catherine Mulcahy in Regent Street. Mulcahy‚Äîwho sold sex using the alias Kathleen KingMurder Files from Scotland Yard and the Black Museum p. 193‚Äîagreed to take him to her flat in nearby Southwick Street.In the Dark: The True Story of the Blackout Ripper p. 163 The two travelled to her flat via taxi, with Cummins giving her the agreed fee of ¬£2 in advance. Upon entering her flat, Mulcahy lit her gas fire and began removing her clothes but did not remove her boots.The Murders of the Black Museum: 1870-1970 p. 374 She later stated a \\"strange smile\\" appeared on Cummins's face as she removed her clothing, lay upon her bed and beckoned him to join her. He removed his clothes, then approached Mulcahy, clambered atop her, slammed his knees into her stomach and attempted to strangle her as he pinned her body to the bed with his own weight. Mulcahy fought her attacker, kicking his stomach with her boot and breaking free of his grasp as Cummins fell to the floor beside her bed. Mulcahy then ran screaming from her flat to the house of a neighbour. Possibly as a means of deterring Mulcahy from reporting the assault to police, Cummins partially dressed himself before approaching her neighbour's flat. He then gave her a further eight ¬£1 notes, stating: \\"I'm sorry. I think I had too much to drink this evening\\" as Mulcahy repeatedly shrieked her belief he was a murderer.The Blackout Murders: The Shocking True Story p. 172 Cummins then grabbed his coat and fled, unwittingly leaving his RAF webbing belt at her address. Doris Jouannet Shortly after his assault upon Mulcahy, Cummins encountered 32-year-old Doris Jouannet (also known as Olga). Jouannet was last seen alive at approximately 10:20 p.m. on 12 February by a friend named Beatrice Lang, with whom she drank a shot of whiskey at a corner-house tearoom. According to Lang, Jouannet stated she intended to visit a regular client whom she referred to as \\"The Captain\\". The two then parted company on Oxford Street.In the Dark: The True Story of the Blackout Ripper p. 143 Shortly thereafter, Jouannet encountered Cummins, accepted his proposal, and took him to the two-room ground-floor flat at 187 Sussex Gardens, Bayswater, that she shared with her husband.The Thames Torso Murders of Victorian London p. 25 Doris Jouannet The following evening, Doris's husband, Henri, returned to the flat he shared with his wife. Noting the bedroom door locked, Henri unsuccessfully attempted to prise the door open before phoning the police, who dispatched a constable named William Payne to the property.The Blackout Murders: The Shocking True Story p. 186 Urging Henri to remain in the hallway, Payne prised the door open and turned on the light, discovering Jouannet's body‚Äînaked save for an open black nightgown‚Äîlying diagonally across the bed with her left hand placed between her legs. A silk stocking was knotted around her neck. Payne then exited the room, stating to Henri, \\"I must advise you not to go in that room.\\" He then returned to the Paddington Police Station to request the station officer alert Scotland Yard's Criminal Investigation Department and the divisional surgeon to his discovery. Divisional Detective Leonard Clare arrived at Sussex Gardens shortly after 8 p.m. His examination of the body at the crime scent revealed Jouannet's jaw had been broken before she had been strangled with the stocking knotted beneath the left side of her chin. Her abdomen, genitals, left breast, and thighs extensively mutilated with a razor blade and knife in a similar manner to the bodies of Oatley and Lowe. One of the wounds inflicted was a six-inch vertical gash extending between her navel and genitalia; another wound inflicted to her vagina measured six-and-a-half inches. Furthermore, the flesh beneath her left breast had been carved away.The Blackout Murders: The Shocking True Story p. 186 The knife used to mutilate Jouannet had been placed on her thigh. Two used condoms lay on the floor beside the bed, and a gold watch and approximately ¬£5 had been stolen from the flat.In the Dark: The True Story of the Blackout Ripper p. 249 Sir Bernard Spilsbury conducted Jouannet's autopsy at the Paddington Mortuary on 14 February. Via examining the spillage of blood from Jouannet's wounds, Spilsbury was able to determine the decedent had been strangled to the point of death before her murderer had first mutilated her breast and left thigh as she died. All other wounds had been inflicted after death. In reference to the nature of the wounds to the victim's body and the locations they had been inflicted, Spilsbury noted the murderer had exercised a degree of calculated restraint when disfiguring his victim above the navel, but that he had worked himself into an evident frenzy when mutilating her genitalia and thigh.The Blackout Murders: The Shocking True Story p. 194 Jouannet was known to only occasionally resort to street level prostitution. She had married her husband‚Äîwho had previously been a client of hers‚Äîin November 1935, and is known to have remarked to other West End prostitutes that she would only resort to selling sexual favours on occasions when she needed \\"a few extra shillings\\" to supplement the money given to her by her elderly husband, who managed a hotel in Sloane Square.In the Dark: The True Story of the Blackout Ripper p. 149 She would engage in prostitution when her husband slept overnight at the hotel, as his employment frequently required him to do. =Press coverage= Due to wartime restrictions on newsprint, the murders committed by Cummins initially received only limited press coverage, largely due to the ongoing global conflict. Nonetheless, the murders quickly became the prime topic of conversation among West End prostitutes, many of whom became increasingly reluctant to offer their services to individuals they did not consider regular clients. However, on 13 February, the bodies of both Lowe and Jouannet were discovered just hours apart. Both murders were soon linked to the murder of Evelyn Oatley, and the perpetrator was dubbed by the press as the Blackout Killer. The murders became nationwide headlines. Margaret Heywood On the evening of 13 February 1942, Cummins accosted a young married woman named Margaret Heywood in Piccadilly. After sharing a drink and a sandwich at the London Trocadero, the two walked in the direction of Haymarket. Heywood later stated that at this point, Cummins became \\"unpleasantly forward\\" toward her: pushing her into a doorway near Piccadilly Circus and groping her waist as he attempted to persuade her to accompany him to a nearby air raid shelter. Heywood consented to a single kiss before informing Cummins she did not know of any nearby air raid shelters, stating, \\"In any case, I wouldn't go in one with you.\\"In the Dark: The True Story of the Blackout Ripper p. 157 Cummins then began fondling Heywood, who remonstrated against his actions as she struck at his wrists and pushed his hands away from her body, then attempted to leave. In response, Cummins seized her by the throat and pushed her back into the doorway. Heywood was then strangled into unconsciousness as Cummins repeatedly muttered the words, \\"You won't\\".The Murders of the Black Museum: 1870-1970 p. 374 As Cummins rifled through her handbag, he was disturbed by an 18-year-old delivery boy named John Shine, who was carrying bottles of drink into the nearby Captain's Cabin pub, forcing Cummins to flee the scene, leaving his RAF-issue gas mask and haversack in the doorway. Shine immediately ran to Heywood's assistance. Noting Heywood had regained consciousness, he then offered to accompany her to a hospital. En route, the couple encountered a policeman named James Skinner, who suggested the two accompany him to West End Central Police Station to provide witness statements detailing Heywood's attack before an officer accompanied her to a nearby hospital.The Blackout Murders: The Shocking True Story pp. 160-161 Immediately after his attack on Heywood, Cummins visited a nearby pub, where he realised he had left his gas mask and haversack at the site of the attempted murder, and that the Regimental number printed inside his haversack could be traced to him. In an effort to concoct an alibi, he stole another airman's gas mask and haversack before returning to base.The Blackout Murders: The Shocking True Story p. 199 Investigation Prior to providing his witness statement at the West End Central Police Station, John Shine handed the gas mask and haversack to investigators, explaining he had recovered the items from the doorway where he had found Heywood, who insisted the items had been in the possession of her assailant. A Detective Sergeant named Thomas Shepherd noted the RAF Regimental number (525987) printed on the inside of the haversack. Shepherd immediately contacted the Royal Air Force Police, who in turn contacted Cummins's regiment in Regent's Park. A staff sergeant quickly ascertained the gas mask and haversack had been issued to Cummins. This information was relayed to Detective Sergeant Shepherd at 11:30 p.m. on 13 February, with the staff sergeant adding Cummins was not at his billet.The Blackout Murders: The Shocking True Story p. 162 =Arrest= Detective Sergeant Thomas Shepherd formally questioned Cummins on the morning of 14 February. He protested his innocence and claimed he had spent the evening drinking whiskey and bitter with a corporal whose name he could not recall at the Volunteer Public House in Baker Street before the two took a taxi to Shaftesbury Avenue. According to Cummins, he drank several shots of spirits at the bar before engaging in conversation with a woman. He further claimed to only hold hazy recollections of his conversations with this woman, due to his intoxication, although he did claim to have a \\"hazy recollection\\" of walking on the street in her company before realising in the early hours he had violated his curfew, and immediately returned to his base. He claimed to have no memory of attacking Heywood, but expressed his regrets and offered to pay her compensation. Questioned as to why the knuckles upon his left hand were cut and bruised, Cummins claimed to have received the wounds while performing maintenance upon an airplane engine.The Blackout Murders: The Shocking True Story pp. 203-204 Immediately after Cummins provided a written statement of his account of the previous evening's events, he was arrested and held on remand upon a charge of causing grevious bodily harm. =Further enquiries= An examination of the entries within billet pass-book on 15 February indicated Cummins had reported back to the billet before 10:30 p.m. on several dates each murder and attempted murder investigators had ascribed to the Blackout Killer. However, many entries had been written in lead pencil, meaning entries within the book could easily be manipulated. Furthermore, several of Cummins's entries for the month of February were incomplete, as although he had invariably signed the pass-book when leaving base, he had frequently failed to sign in upon his return.The Blackout Murders: The Shocking True Story p. 227 Questioning of Cummins's fellow airmen revealed they had been in the habit of vouching for each other's return to base, and that Cummins had spent extravagantly in the week prior to his arrest. Detective Chief Inspector Edward Greeno further discovered Cummins and another airman named Felix Sampson had left the billet via a fire escape after midnight on each of the dates in question, and both had not returned to base until the early hours of the morning.The Murders of the Black Museum: 1870-1970 p. 375 A search of Cummins's possessions revealed he had taken various items belonging to the four murder victims linked to the Blackout Killer as keepsakes. One of the items had been a white metal cigarette case engraved with the initials L.W., which had belonged to Evelyn Oatley. This cigarette case was discovered hidden inside a kitchenette, alongside a photograph of Oatley's mother.The Blackout Murders: The Shocking True Story p. 234 Traces of blood were also recovered from a shirt retrieved from his kit bag, and the inner surface of his belt. Furthermore, an examination of the trouser turn-ups of Cummins's military uniform revealed traces of a distinctive brick dust mixture found at the air raid shelter in which Evelyn Hamilton's body was discovered. Chippings of this mortar were also recovered from Cummins's haversack.The Blackout Murders: The Shocking True Story p. 232 Detective Chief Superintendent Frederick Cherrill was able to match the fingerprint of Cummins's left little finger and thumb with prints found upon the tin opener and broken mirror found near the body of Evelyn Oatley. Cherrill later confirmed fingerprints recovered from two other crime scenes belonged to Cummins. Two of the ten ¬£1 banknotes Catherine Mulcahy's attacker had given her before and after he had assaulted her were brand new. Via tracing the serial number of these banknotes, Detective Chief Inspector Edward Greeno was further able to determine these two notes had been issued to Cummins on 12 February.In the Dark: The True Story of the Blackout Ripper p. 240 Both Heywood and Mulcahy were later asked to view a police lineup to identify their attacker. Mulcahy was unable to positively identify her attacker, although Heywood unhesitantly identified Cummins as the man who had assaulted her. Cummins continued to protest his innocence, claiming Heywood was mistaken and that another airman must have switched his own gas mask and haversack with his, and may have left the items at the site of the attempted murder in an effort to frame him.The Murders of the Black Museum: 1870-1970 p. 375 =Formal murder charges= On 16 February, Edward Greeno drove to HM Prison Brixton to interview Cummins, who recounted his movements between 9 and 13 February. He insisted he had never encountered any of the murder victims, and claimed to be unable to recognise their photographs. When presented with the victims' personal belongings recovered among his own possessions, Cummins claimed the items had been \\"taken from a service respirator case I was carrying when arrested, but which was not mine\\".The Blackout Murders: The Shocking True Story p. 250 He then recounted his claim that he had either picked up the wrong haversack, or that another airman had swtiched his own gas mask and haversack with his. Unconvinced of Cummins's claims, Greeno informed him he was to be charged with the murders of Oatley, Lowe, and Jouannet the following morning. He was held on remand at HM Prison Brixton, to await trial.The Murders of the Black Museum: 1870-1970 p. 376 Cummins was further charged with assaulting Heywood and Mulcahy on 20 February. On 27 March, Cummins again appeared before a judge at Bow Street Magistrates' Court. On this occasion, he was further charged with the murder of Evelyn Hamilton. Trial The trial of Gordon Cummins for the murder of Evelyn Oatley began at the Old Bailey on 24 April 1942. He was tried before Mr Justice AsquithEncyclopedia of Serial Killers p. 56 The clerk of assize opened proceedings on this date by asking Cummins to stand to hear a formal recitation of the charge, and to state his plea. Cummins entered a plea of not guilty to the charge against him; the clerk then informed the jury: \\"The prisoner at the bar, Gordon Frederick Cummins, is charged upon indictment with the murder of Evelyn Oatley on the tenth day of February this year. To this indictment he has pleaded that he is not guilty. It is your charge to say, having heard the evidence, whether he be guilty or not.\\"In the Dark: The True Story of the Blackout Ripper p. 264 The prosecution consisted of Christmas Humphreys K.C. and G. B. McClure, K.C., with Denis Nowell Pritt K.C. initially appointed to defend Cummins. However, due to a legal technicality on the first day of the trial (the presentation to the jury of crime scene photographs of victim Margaret Florence Lowe),The Enemy Within: Hucksters, Racketeers, Deserters, and Civilians During the Second World War p. 104 the jury was excused from duty. The trial restarted before a new jury on 27 April, the defence now consisting of John Flowers K.C. and Victor Durand K.C. Cummins himself seemed uninterested in the legal proceedings; occasionally chatting in a light-hearted manner with his lawyers or turning from the bar to smile and wave at his wife, who steadfastly believed in his innocence.In the Dark: The True Story of the Blackout Ripper p. 264 =Witness testimony= In his opening statement on behalf of the prosecution, Humphreys outlined the discovery of Oatley's body, the injuries inflicted to her body, the weapons her murderer had used to perform the mutilations, and the fingerprints recovered at the crime scene. Referring to the prosecution's intention to link Cummins to this murder by the fingerprints investigators had recovered, Humphreys stated: \\"You will hear from one of the greatest experts in the country upon fingerprints. He will tell you that there have been some half- million fingerprints taken in this time and there have never been two alike. The prosecution would ask you to say, each one of you, that you are satisfied, on the evidence which will be called before you, and nothing else, that this man is the man who murdered Mrs. Oatley on the tenth of February.\\"The Blackout Murders: The Shocking True Story p. 266-267 The first witnesses to testify on behalf of the prosecution was Detective Chief Superintendent Frederick Cherrill, who stated he was prepared to publicly stake his reputation the fingerprints found upon the tin opener and broken mirror at the crime scene which had been used to extensively mutilate Oatley's body belonged to Cummins. Cherrill repeated this claim during cross-examination from John Flowers, who contended the fingerprint upon the tin opener was too faint to determine a precise identification,In the Dark: The True Story of the Blackout Ripper p. 268 stating the quality of the fingerprint was typical for a fingerprint left upon a metal surface, and that any individual who touched the same surface would leave a fingerprint impression of the same quality. In response to further questioning as to discrepancies in the distance between points of identification upon the enlarged photographs of Cummins's fingerprints and those retrieved at the crime scene on display in the courtroom, Cherrill stated the points of discrepancy would appear \\"very great in an enlarged photograph\\", adding that original fingerprints can extend up to four millimeters depending on the degree of pressure to which they are subjected.The Blackout Murders: The Shocking True Story p. 268 Sir Bernard Spilsbury followed Cherrill into the witness box to testify as to the autopsy he had conducted upon Oatley's body. Spilsbury testified the cause of death of the decedent had been the deep cut to her throat, that Oatley would have bled to death in less than five minutes, and that death had occurred at approximately 12:30 a.m. on the morning of the discovery of her body, although the actual time of her death could have been up to two hours before or after this time.In the Dark: The True Story of the Blackout Ripper p. 268The Blackout Murders: The Shocking True Story p. 270 Felix Sampson then testified that between 10:30 and 11 p.m. on the night of Oatley's disappearance, he and Cummins had accosted two prostitutes outside the Monico Restaurant in Piccadilly Circus. The two had agreed to reconvene outside the restaurant after \\"taking care of business\\". Sampson testified he had arrived back outside the restaurant at approximately 11:30 p.m. and had waited roughly 25 minutes for Cummins to appear before walking alone to a local pub. He had arrived back at St John's Wood at approximately 6 a.m., only to find Cummins asleep. When he later asked Cummins what time he had arrived back at the billet, Cummins had replied \\"about half-past three or four\\" in the morning,The Blackout Murders: The Shocking True Story p. 271 adding: \\"The woman I went with didn't satisfy me, so I went and found someone else.\\"The Blackout Murders: The Shocking True Story p. 55 =Defendant's testimony= Cummins chose to testify in his own defense on 27 April. He denied any culpability in Oatley's murder; insisting he had been in the company of another woman on 10 February before returning to his billet. In reference to the previous testimony of Felix Sampson, Cummins admitted to having lied in his statement to Detective Chief Inspector Edward Greeno that he and Sampson had reconvened outside the Monico Restaurant at approximately 10 p.m., adding the primary reason was that he had been afraid due to the fact Greeno had intimidated him in his initial questioning on 16 February, stating to him: \\"We have a rope around your neck, and we are going to hang you with it\\" after he had admitted having been in Oatley's company shortly before her murder, but had insisted she had been alive and well when he had last seen her. He also claimed to have been too drunk on the evening of her death to recall the actual timing of his whereabouts or actions, adding: \\"I had not a watch, myself. And, of course, in the dark, one cannot see public clocks.\\"The Blackout Murders: The Shocking True Story p. 275 Both counsels presented their closing arguments to the jury on 28 April. Upon completion of both counsels' closing arguments, Mr Justice Asquith delivered his final instructions to the jury. This address lasted for more than hour, with the judge outlining key points presented by both prosecution and defence. At 4 p.m., the jury retired to consider their verdict.Dark City: Murder, Vice, and Mayhem in Wartime London ch. 3 Conviction The jury returned their verdict at 4:35 p.m., having deliberated for just 35 minutes. Each avoided making eye contact with Cummins as they filed back into the courtroom. When asked by the court clerk as to their verdict, the foreman replied, \\"Guilty of murder.\\"The Murders of the Black Museum: 1870-1970 p. 376 Cummins displayed no emotion as the verdict was read aloud, although his wife burst into tears. He was then asked whether he had any legal reason or cause as to why the court should not impose the penalty of death. In response, Cummins replied, \\"I am completely innocent, sir.\\"In the Dark: The True Story of the Blackout Ripper p. 277 Cummins was then formally sentenced to death by hanging. Upon imposing this sentence, Mr Justice Asquith stated: \\"Gordon Frederick Cummins, after a fair trial you have been found guilty, and on a charge of murder. As you know, there is only one sentence which the law permits me to pronounce, and that is you be taken from this place to a lawful prison, and thence to a place of execution, and that you there be hanged by the neck until you are dead. And may God have mercy on your soul.\\"In the Dark: The True Story of the Blackout Ripper p. 278 Wandsworth Prison. Cummins was executed within the grounds of this prison on 25 June 1942 =Execution= Following his conviction, Cummins was held in a condemned cell at Wandsworth Prison, to await execution.In the Dark: The True Story of the Blackout Ripper pp. 280-281 He voiced no convern over his predicament, although he did lodge an appeal against his conviction. His appeal was rejected by the Lord Chief Justice in early June 1942. Gordon Cummins was executed by Albert Pierrepoint at Wandsworth Prison on 25 June 1942. Contemporary news reports indicate Cummins was given a glass of brandy to calm his nerves. He then walked stoically to the scaffold, flanked by two warders, without offering any resistance. The entire execution process lasted less than two minutes.The Blackout Murders: The Shocking True Story p. 282-283 Cummins's execution was conducted during a German air raid upon London. He is the only convicted murderer in British criminal history known to have been executed during an air raid.The Story of Soho: The Windmill Years 1932-1964 p. 36 Cummins protested his innocence to the end. His wife and family were unwavering in their belief of his innocence, and visited him on a frequent basis until the day of his execution.The Murders of the Black Museum: 1870-1970 p. 377 Cummins's body was later buried within the confines of the prison.

He served as U.S. Representative from Massachusetts. Biography Francis Ball Fay was born in Southborough, Massachusetts. His parents were poor, and he had little education. At the age of 18, he \\"bought his time\\" of his father for $80 a year. (The term refers to the practice of sons owing their fathers time and dedication until they were 21; to pursue other occupations, sons were expected to \\"buy their time\\" to reimburse their fathers for lost labor.) Fay attended the public scales in Dock Square, Boston, in 1811-12, then served as market man and butcher, and in 1817 became a merchant in Southborough. From 1816-1824 Fay was an active member of the state militia, reaching the rank of colonel. He was postmaster of Southborough from September 15, 1817, to March 29, 1832. He was deputy sheriff of Worcester County 1824‚Äì1830. He served as member of the Massachusetts General Court (the lower house of representatives) in 1830 and 1831. In 1831 he moved to Chelsea, Massachusetts, built one of the first substantial houses there, and brought the first ferry-boats running to Boston. Fay represented Chelsea in the Massachusetts General Court from 1834 to 1836 and in 1840, and served in the State Senate 1843‚Äì1845 and again in 1848. Fay served as the first Mayor of Chelsea in 1857, where he was also the first president of Chelsea's oldest bank, the Chelsea Savings Bank, incorporated in 1854. Fay was elected as a Whig to the Thirty-second Congress to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Robert Rantoul, Jr., and served from December 13, 1852, to March 3, 1853. He chose not to run for another term. In 1852, Fay endowed his hometown of Southborough, Massachusetts with a public lending library, reputed to be the fourth earliest free municipal library in the country, predating by a few months the Boston Public Library.Southborough, Massachusetts Historic Buildings Survey , Southborough Historical Commission, 2000 The institution was named in Fay's honor. After declining to serve a second term as Chelsea's mayor, Fay moved to Lancaster in 1858 to be closer to the Lancaster Industrial School for Girls he had helped found, and with which he was connected as commissioner, trustee, and treasurer from 1854-64. This groundbreaking facility was the country's first state reform school for girls, and as an alternative to the then common practice of imprisoning juvenile delinquents, was one of the most progressive correctional institutions for women of its day.National Park Service, Places Where Women Made History Fay was a member of the State Senate one final time in 1868.

He was also the father of U.S. Congressman James Carr, and the founder of a political and mercantile family in Bangor, Maine. Carr was born and attended common schools in Newbury in the Province of Massachusetts Bay. He later moved to Haverhill, married Mary Elliot (b. 1755 in Amesbury), and engaged in the mercantile and shipbuilding business. He also represented Haverhill in the Massachusetts House of Representatives.Edson Irving Carr, The Carr Family Records (1894), pp. 69, 105. Political career In 1793 Carr moved to Bangor in Massachusetts' District of Maine, which had incorporated as a town only two years before. As in Haverhill, he was elected to represent the area in the Massachusetts House of Representatives (1806‚Äì1808), and later the Massachusetts State Senate (1809‚Äì1811). Carr was the first citizen of Bangor to serve in the U.S. Congress. He was elected as a Democratic-Republican to the Twelfth Congress to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Barzillai Gannett and served from April 6, 1812, to March 3, 1813. He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1812 to the Thirteenth Congress, and resumed mercantile pursuits. In 1814 he witnessed the British sacking of Bangor following the rout of local militia in the Battle of Hampden. He died in Bangor, Maine, October 6, 1821, and was interred in Mount Hope Cemetery. Carr Family The Carrs remained an important mercantile and political family in Bangor well into the 19th century.

He was a cousin of Pedro Perea, and grandson of Governor Francisco Xavier Ch√°vez, the first Governor (1822‚Äì1823) of the Departamento de Nuevo M√©xico under the independent First Mexican Empire. Perea had a trade network along the Santa Fe Trail between St. Louis and Mexico. During the American Civil War, Perea was commissioned as a Union Army lieutenant colonel, helping to defend the Territory. He was elected to serve as a delegate for the Territory of New Mexico to the 38th United States Congress from March 4, 1863, to March 3, 1865. After the war he served again in the Territorial legislature, and then as US postmaster of Jemez Springs from 1894 to 1905. Biography =Early life and education= Perea was born January 9, 1830, in Los Padillas, New Mexico (then in the United Mexican States). This area is now within Bernalillo County, New Mexico, near Albuquerque. He was the third child of Juan Perea and his wife, Josefa Chaves de Perea, a family of Hispanos whose roots in the area dated to colonial era. He was a maternal grandson of Governor Francisco Xavier Ch√°vez, the first Governor (1822‚Äì1823) of the Departamento de Nuevo M√©xico under the independent First Mexican Empire shortly after Mexican War of Independence from Spain ended in 1821. As a youth, Perea attended select schools in Bernalillo County from 1836 to 1837 and at Santa Fe from 1837 to 1839. Perea attended the Jesuit College (now St. Louis University), St. Louis, Missouri, from 1843 to 1845. He received collegiate training at the Bank Street Academy in New York City 1847-1849. During this period, the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War took place, ending with Mexico's defeat and its ceding the Southwest and California to the US. When Perea returned to New Mexico, it had been annexed by the US; Congress authorized it as a Territory in 1850 after Texas gave up its claims. Before returning home, Perea and other classmates met President Zachary Taylor. Perea contracted cholera about this time, but he recovered. =Marriage and family= Shortly after his return from the east, Perea married Dolores Otero on March 15, 1851. They had a total of eighteen children, most of whom died as infants. =Business and politics= Throughout the 1850s, Perea was engaged in stock raising and commercial pursuits. He transported merchandise by mule train along the Santa Fe Trail from St. Louis and Independence, Missouri, to Mexico. He also traveled to California, and had an extended trip to New York City during the 1850s. In 1858 Perea was elected to represent Bernalillo County in the Territorial House. On December 31 of that year, he submitted the following letter: \\"To the Hon. Jos√© Guadalupe Gallegos Speaker of the House of Representatives: SIR: To the resolution of the House, asking me to give my reasons for declining to take a seat in that Hon. House, as a member from the county of Bernalillo, I have the honor to respond: In the first place, I never consented to my name being placed before the people as a candidate for the office to which I was elected and secondly, I would inform the House, that the health of my family, makes my presence absolutely indispensable. I was not aware that it was my duty to resign after I had been elected, or I would have done so, in order to give the people of my county an opportunity to elect another in my place. With assurances to the Hon. House, that I would be very happy to accompany them in providing for the good of our common country, if the matters above mentioned would permit me. I am, Mr. Speaker with much respect, Your Obd. Servant, FRANCISCO PEREA\\" The communication was adopted and Francisco Perea was excused from attending the House during the 1858 session. =Civil War service and territorial delegate= When the American Civil War broke out, Perea traveled across the Territory of New Mexico to garner support for the Union cause. President Abraham Lincoln authorized the establishment of two regiments and four battalions for the defense of the New Mexico Territory. Perea was commissioned as a lieutenant colonel. In December 1861, he organized one of the battalions, which came to be known as Perea's Battalion. It was stationed at Albuquerque during the winters of 1861 and 1862. He commanded the unit to defend New Mexico against the Texas Rangers and Navajo. Perea took part in the Battle of Glorieta Pass, in March 1862, where the Union defeated Confederate forces.Civil War Archives Perea resigned from the battalion and worked to repair his home, destroyed during the war. He was elected in 1862 as a Republican Territorial delegate to the Thirty-Eighth Congress, serving from March 4, 1863, to March 3, 1865. In 1863, he was selected as New Mexico Territory's delegate to the 1864 Republican National Convention. He traveled to Washington, D.C., where the Thirty-Eighth Congress met in its first session on December 7. During the 1864 Republican National Convention, he was among those who favored the renomination of President Lincoln. He was at Ford's Theatre when Lincoln was shot by John Wilkes Booth in April 1865. In the summer of 1865, Perea was renominated for his seat in Congress, but did not win the election. =Later life= Perea was elected to the Territorial Council of New Mexico for a third time in 1866, and a fourth time in 1884. In 1881 he had moved from Bernalillo County to Jemez Springs, New Mexico. There he served as proprietor of the springs, believed to be healthful, and a related hotel. After several years, he was appointed as US postmaster of Jemez Springs, serving from 1894 to 1905 during Republican administrations. He moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico, in 1906 and died there May 21, 1913. He was interred in Fairview Cemetery.Francisco Perea, Biographical Directory of the United States Congress Retrieved on 2008-10-13 =Family= Perea was married twice. He first married Delores Otero on March 15, 1851. They had a total of eighteen children, most of whom died as infants. Delores died in 1866. Perea married secondly Gabriela Montoya in 1875. With his second wife he had another eighteen children, ten of whom survived him.

Administrative structure In 1995, the Alabama Cooperative Extension System became the nation's first unified Extension program, combining the resources of the 1862 and 1890 land-grant institutions. The catalyst was a landmark federal court ruling, known as Knight vs. Alabama, handed down by Judge Harold Murphy.\\"Judge ends desegregation case,\\" Decatur Daily, Dec. 14, 2006. Under its terms, the Extension programs and other land-grant university functions of Alabama A&M;, Auburn, and Tuskegee (historically African-American institution) universities were combined and served as cooperative partners within this unified system.

The Extension director serves as the organization's chief executive officer and maintains offices at both campuses. In written remarks outlining his rationale for the ruling, Judge Murphy called for an expanded and updated Cooperative Extension mission that not only continued to address traditional programming needs but that also was better equipped to respond to the needs of a population that had become more urbanized and racially and ethnically diverse. Additionally to providing for an associate director for Rural and Traditional Programs, who would be housed at Auburn University. Judge Murphy also mandated that an associate director of Urban and New Nontraditional Programs be employed and housed at Alabama A&M; University.

For decades, the bulk of Alabama Cooperative Extension programs were carried out by county agents ‚Äì generalists who kept abreast of many different subjects and delivered a wide variety of programs. By the onset of the 21st century, urbanization was a key trend that resulted in fewer farms and altered public expectations. The advent of the World Wide Web changed information delivery methods from printed materials to online. These changes prompted the switch from using the generalist agents who had administered Extension programming throughout the previous century to regional agents specializing in one of 14 program priority areas. = Regional agents = Regional Extension agents work with other agents across regional and disciplinary lines, with area and state subject-matter specialists, and with sister agencies, such as the Alabama Farmers Federation, the Alabama Forestry Commission and the Natural Resources Conservation Service, to deliver programs over a regional and statewide basis. =Continuing county presence= Despite the growing emphasis on regional agents, Alabama Extension continues to operate offices in all 67 counties. These are headed by coordinators, who work with regional agents and other Extension staff to deliver programs within their counties. =Funding= One of the distinguishing traits associated with Cooperative Extension work throughout the country is the financial support it receives from every level of government. Like many of its sister programs throughout the country, Alabama Extension has begun looking for ways to supplement these traditional sources of funding with private support, typically in the form of grants and fees.\\"Taking the University to the People: 2000 Annual Report,\\" Alabama Cooperative Extension System History A common perception is that the birth of Cooperative Extension followed passage of the Smith-Lever Act of 1914, which provided federal funds to land-grant universities to support Extension work. In a formal sense, this is true. But the roots of Cooperative Extension extend as far back as the late 18th century, following the American Revolution, when affluent farmers first began organizing groups to sponsor educational meetings to disseminate useful farming information. In some cases, these lectures even were delivered by university professors ‚Äì a practice that foreshadowed Cooperative Extension work more than a century later.Rasmussen, Wayne D., Taking the University to the People: Seventy-five Years of Cooperative Extension, Ames, Iowa: Iowa State University Press, 1989, p. 18. These efforts became more formalized over time.

Gregarines tend to parasitize invertebrates with the mature gamonts being extracellular, the coccidia mostly infect vertebrates and have intracellular gamonts. Description A conoid is found in most species and when present forms complete but truncated cone. Sexual and asexual reproduction are present in life cycle of all species. Each zygote normally forms an oocyst wall within which it undergoes meiosis. This is sometimes followed by mitosis. This process of sporogony produces mobile vermiform infectious sporozoites. Multiple mitotic divisions (schizogony) also occur during merogony of the feeding stages (trophozoites) and during gametogony. =Motility= Microgametes of some species are flagellated.

Early life and career  Born in Dedham, Massachusetts, Williams attended private schools, graduated from the Dedham High School in 1868, and from Dartmouth College in 1872. He studied at the Universities of Heidelberg and Berlin. He also studied law at Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts. He taught school in West Brewster, Massachusetts in 1872 and 1873.

In the 1896 convention, he bucked the state party establishment by abandoning the gold plank supported by the rest of the delegation, and supported William Jennings Bryan for president. This action did tremendous damage to his future elective prospects within the party. Williams was appointed Minister to Greece and Montenegro by President Woodrow Wilson, serving in 1914. He resigned this position after a visit to Albania witnessing the tragic Albanian civilians being murdered and left to die of hunger by the Royal Greek Army.

Mecherle, a farmer who became an insurance agent also, founded State Farm after becoming dissatisfied with the insurance rates charged to farmers, as those rates included the risks of city drivers as well. Mecherle was known as a very progressive and scientific farmer. However, in 1919 he quit farming and moved to Florida to improve his wife's health ‚Äî she had rheumatoid arthritis. The warm climate did not improve her health so they moved back to Central Illinois in 1921. After returning to Illinois he had sold tractors for a while and discovered that he had a real knack for selling to farmers. Believing that city insurance companies were \\"rooking\\" farmers with high premiums based upon city driving accident rates, he became obsessed with the idea of starting his own insurance company ‚Äî \\"an honest insurance company\\" was the phrase Mecherle used. In the spring of 1921, Tazewell County Farm Bureau organized a township mutual insurance company ‚Äî which was the idea Mecherle had been considering ‚Äî a mutual insurance company which is owned by those who are insured through a membership. The Tazewell company was set up to insure property, including automobiles. Mecherle then attended a meeting of the Federation of Mutual Fire Insurance Companies in the summer of 1921 in St. Louis. He spoke with Tazewell County Farm Bureau president and those discussions helped to crystallize Mecherle's idea of starting \\"an honest insurance company.\\" Eventually, Mecherle's idea began taking shape and he opened his first office late in 1921 in The Illinois House in downtown Bloomington. In January 1922, he developed a prospectus and presented it to the Illinois State Association of Mutual Insurance Companies meeting in Streator. The plan called for his company to sell automobile insurance to: > members of Farm Bureau, members of farm mutuals, their immediate families, > or those eligible for membership in such organizations. The association enthusiastically endorsed the plan, and Mecherle proceeded to get the state license he needed to operate. On June 8, 1922, ‚Äî the day after George Mecherle's 45th birthday ‚Äî State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company was in business. Mecherle attempted to adopt programs that gave financial strength to his growing company while providing unique benefits to policyholders beyond what was offered at the time. For example, he adopted a strict no-drinking and driving provision to reduce accidents, and he also instituted the first installment payment program for premiums. This was to allow farmers premiums to become due when they expected to receive their crop payments. Eventually, his company became the largest property and casualty insurer in the United States and one of the 20 largest corporations on the Fortune 500.

CPSE is characterized by seizures involving long-lasting stupor, staring and unresponsiveness. Sometimes this is accompanied by motor automatisms, such as eye twitching.  Diagnosis  As is the case with other non-convulsive status epilepticus forms, CPSE is dangerously underdiagnosed. This is due to the potentially fatal yet veiled nature of the symptoms. Usually, an electroencephalogram, or EEG, is needed to confirm a neurologist's suspicions. The EEG is also needed to differentiate between absence status epilepticus (which affects the entire brain), and CPSE, which only affects one region.  Treatment  Treatment is in the form of anti-epileptic drugs, such as barbiturates, benzodiazepines and topiramate.

Alyona works as a witch in a research institution that researches magic called NUINU (Scientific Universal Institute of Extraordinary Services, a NIICHAVO subsidiary in Kitezhgrad; for NIICHAVO see Monday Begins on Saturday). The couple are about to get married when Alyona's jealous and scheming co-worker, Sataneev (V. Gaft), tricks Alyona's boss, Kira Shemahanskaya (Ye.

Ivan and Alyona's friends must figure out a way to break the curse while simultaneously protecting the institution's latest research development, a magic wand.

But Bromberg turned down the script due to its serious tone and social commentary, and the Strugatskys had to rewrite their script as a light-hearted romantic comedy. As a result, the movie bore almost no resemblance to the book besides the setting and several characters' names. History later repeated itself with another film by Sokurov Days of Eclipse (Dni zatmeniya).

It is the band's first album with guitarist/keyboardist Brian Southall who joined the band after the departure of guitarist/vocalist Casey Crescenzo. This album was produced by Matt Squire (Panic! at the Disco, Boys Like Girls, Hit The Lights). Writing for the album occurred from October 2006 to January 2007. The album peaked at #130 on the Billboard 200, #3 on Top Heatseekers, and #15 on Top Independent Albums. Background and production The Receiving End of Sirens released their debut album Between the Heart and the Synapse in April 2005, though independent label Triple Crown Records. The group promoted it with four US tours (supporting the likes of Gatsbys American Dream, Acceptance and Alexisonfire), stints on the Warped Tour and Taste of Chaos, leading up to the group's first headlining tour in early 2006.Various tours: * First US supporting tour and Warped Tour: * Second US supporting tour: * Third and fourth US supporting tours: * Taste of Chaos: * US headlining tour: The members were suffering from interpersonal tension, which guitarist/vocalist Casey Crescenzo attributed to himself: \\"I was the epicenter ... There were too many creative egos, and I suppose mine had to be the loudest.\\" He left the group after the conclusion of their headlining tour in May 2006, citing \\"many factors, personal and creative\\" as the reasoning. However, it was later discovered he was suffering from a series of undiagnosed medical issues ‚Äì namely, throat and stomach ulcers, kidney and pancreatic failure, burst lung capillaries and memory loss ‚Äì that he was unable to afford care. Vocalist/bassist Brendan Brown and vocalist/guitarist Alex Bars handled the singing role for the remainder of their touring commitments for the year, which consisted of two further US tours, and treks of Canada and the UK, up to late 2006.Various tours: * Sixth US tour: * Seventh US tour: * Canadian tour: * UK tour: Cody Bonnette of As Cities Burn filled Crescenzo's role for three months, though they didn't record or practice together, and was replaced by Brian Southall of Boys Night Out joined the band as their guitarist; he was previously their one-time touring manager. They went to a secluded llama farm in Connecticut, which was owned by Bars' grandparents, where they spent two months writing new material. Starting in February 2007, the group began recording their second album with producer Matt Squire. Sessions were held at SOMD studios, located in Beltsville, Maryland. On April 17, the band announced recording had concluded. Composition =Overview= The Earth Sings Mi Fa Mi is a concept album, which takes its story and title from Johannes Kepler, a 16th-century astronomer, in a book of his which the band were intrigued by. He theorized that the solar system produced tones, such as Venus being a major sixth note, and the Earth as the relative minor sixth note, cumulating in the Mi-Fa-Mi scale. Additionally he pondered on the idea that the Earth \\"'singing' Mi Fa Mi could truly stand for Misery, Famine, Misery and ultimately, that is the song the Earth and Venus continued to sing. Misery, referring to an empty place and Famine, referring to the appetite or thirst for things.\\" Bars incorporated his love for astronomer Carl Sagan into the album. The record's secondary topic is about a family breakdown; Brown wrote all of the lyrics, in contrast to their debut, where he collaborated on them with Crescenzo and drummer Andrew Cook. Musically, the sound of it has been described as arena rock, emo and progressive rock, drawing a comparison to Kid A (2000)-era Radiohead. It utilized multi-layered vocals, in addition to call-and-response parts, with the tracks being sung from different perspectives, such as animals (in the track \\"Smoke and Mirrors), planets and human beings. Unlike their debut album, which had Crescenzo handle all of the programming, all of the members contributed programming for their second album, and basted some of the tracks around it. =Tracks= The opening track \\"Swallow People Whole\\" is a quiet rock track with elements of electronic music, reminiscent of Depeche Mode. Brown woke up in a hotel room with the drum pattern and chorus melody in his head; he worked on the sequencing over the course of a night. It talks about being a stranger in one's own body and that one's actions didn't reflect their own perception of themselves. \\"Obliette (Disappear)\\" tackles the theme of emptiness, and features programming from Southall. \\"The Crop and Pest\\" discusses desire and features pomp rock-styled organ. One of the verses details an evil spirit using a human host as a home; it makes reference to a nautilus shell, which is done as a metaphor for perfection. The track reuses some of the lyrics from an outtake from the album sessions, \\"The Afterglow\\". The almost seven-minute long number \\"The Salesman, the Husband, the Lover\\" was compared to Blue October. It is the start of the album's other topic, which discusses fracturing relationships that mentioned throughout the remainder of release. Brown based it on a fictional story he had wrote about a broken home. While working on the demo recording of the song, Brown did research on kids in broken families and incorporated various terms in the song: lightbulb, wishbone, rifle and telephone. The song was partially influenced by the poem I Go Back to May 1937 by Sharon Olds, which was a favorite of Brown's. \\"Smoke and Mirrors\\", which also talks about emptiness, opens with a spoken-word introduction. The song had been performed live sometime prior to recording in a different form. As they were in the studio, the overall structure and guitar melody during the chorus was changed. \\"A Realization of the Ear\\" is another quiet rock track with electronic elements that ends with a choral section. \\"Saturnus\\" talks about dealing with a craving, and includes references to scratching, which are used to show \\"how it is often more pleasurable to pursue a temptation than to obtain said temptation.\\" \\"Music of the Spheres\\" is an instrumental that leads into the penultimate track \\"The Heir of Empty Breath\\". It reaches the climax of the family storyline, and talks about begging to be taken away from emotional distress. The track features the combination of five different vocal melodies. The closing track \\"Pale Blue Dot\\" took its name from the Sagan book of the same title. The song is about becoming complacent with dissatisfaction, instead of choosing to do something about it. Release In May 2007, the band supported Thrice on their brief US tour, and appeared at the Give it a Name festival in the UK. On June 1, The Earth Sings Mi Fa Mi was announced for release in August, and the album's track listing was revealed. In June and July, the group supported Saosin on their headlining US tour. On July 19, \\"Saturnus\\" was posted the group's AbsolutePunk profile. Four days later, the band posted an e-card with snippets of music from the forthcoming album. The Earth Sings Mi Fa Mi was made avilable for streaming through the group's Myspace account on August 3, prior to its release through Triple Crown Records on August 7. They embarked on a headlining US tour in August and September, with support from Emanuel, Envy on the Coast, Hopesfall, Strangler and Goodbye Tomorrow. The group supported New Found Glory and Senses Fail on their co-headlining US tour in October and November. In December, the band went on a headlining US tour with support from As Tall as Lions and Therefore I Am. A music video was released for \\"Smoke and Mirrors\\" on January 31, 2008. In February, the band played two shows in Australia with Thursday around the Soundwave festival. On March 19, the group announced they were breaking up. Reception The Earth Sings Mi Fa Mi received favorable reviews from music critics. AllMusic reviewer Jo-Ann Grene wrote that the theming made it \\"a complex set\\", and its music \\"even more so\\" with the group crafting \\"a dense tapestry of sound, multi-shaded and many colored.\\" While noting this was also true of their debut album, \\"here they exude confidence and take it to a whole new level.\\" Sputnikmusic staff member Adam Knott summarized the album in one word: \\"exhausting. It's exhausting to listen to, exhausting to write about, exhausting to think about\\", before clarifying, it was \\"painfully catchy\\" that the listener can \\"almost feel its hooks pummeling you, each one familiar but not quite recurring.\\" He said it was a \\"difficult record\\" with a \\"brilliance [that] is ultimately so rewarding.\\" P√§r Winberg of Melodic said the band performed the arena/progressive rock \\"real[ly] damn well.\\" He found the album to have a \\"bunch of pompous songs\\", and overall said it was \\"far better\\" than their debut. Alternative Press writer Luke O'Neil said it had \\"[s]himmering harmonies, gutsy vocal straining that verges toward a scream,\\" backed by \\"atmospheric breakdowns\\" to showcase \\"songwriting maturity,\\" with \\"rolling storms of distortion and woe-is-me handwringing.\\" Despite the band adding \\"absolutely nothing new to the formula\\", which he considered \\"pretty much perfect-you can‚Äôt fix a formula that‚Äôs already this awesome.\\" The Albuquerque Tribune Paul Maldonado said the band created an album that had \\"extraordinary lyrical depth\\" and \\"exquisite harmonies\\" with a \\"dual-guitar attack [which] sets the mood.\\" Track listing All music by The Receiving End of Sirens.

Biography Born in Stowe, Vermont, Hendee attended the common schools of Morrisville, Vermont, and People's Academy. He studied law in the office of Whitman G. Ferrin of Johnson, was admitted to the bar in 1855, and commenced practice in Morrisville, Vermont. In 1855 he married Millissa Redding, who died in 1861. In 1863 he married Viola S. Bundy. He married his third wife, Mary Louise Watts Woodbury, in January 1906. He had one daughter. Career Hendee served for many years as Superintendent of Schools in Morrisville, Vermont. He was also a director of the Portland and Ogdensburg Railway, president of the Montreal, Portland and Boston Railway, vice president of the Union Savings Bank and Trust Company of Morrisville, and receiver of the National Bank of Poultney and of the Vermont National Bank of St. Albans. Hendee served as State's Attorney for Lamoille County in 1858 and 1859, and as member of the Vermont House of Representatives in 1861 and 1862. During the Civil War Hendee served as a deputy provost marshal. (Provost marshals were appointed for each state and Congressional district by the federal government, and were responsible for supervising conscription and recruiting activities.) He served in the Vermont State Senate from 1866 to 1868, and was chosen to serve as Senate President. Hendee was elected 25th Lieutenant Governor of Vermont in 1869. On February 7, 1870, Governor Peter T. Washburn died; Hendee succeeded to the governorship, and his oath of office was administered by Justice Benjamin H. Steele of the Vermont Supreme Court. He completed the remainder of Washburn's term, which ended on October 3, 1870, but did not run for a full term in 1870. Republicans, who had won all statewide elections in Vermont since the founding of the party (and would continue to do so until the late 1950s), debated whether Hendee should be a candidate for a full term in 1870. Their first issue was whether the nomination would go to someone from the west side of the Green Mountains, in keeping with the Mountain Rule that had existed since the founding of the party in the mid-1850s, or whether it should go to someone from the east side of the mountains, where Washburn had lived, on the grounds that he had died before his term was complete. Their second issue was that the Mountain Rule had limited Vermont Governors to two one-year terms in office, and 1870 would be the first election for a two-year term. The Republicans planned to revise their Mountain Rule to limit Governors to one two-year term. Should Hendee be nominated, which would mean that he would serve more than two years? (Under the Mountain Rule, candidates for Governor and Lieutenant Governor were from alternate sides of the Green Mountains, and Governors were limited to two years in office. US Senators were chosen so that one always came from the east side of the mountains and one from the west.) Republicans resolved these questions by deciding that the nomination should go to someone from the west, in keeping with their regular rotation policy, but that it should go to someone other than Hendee, in order to ensure that no Governor exceeded the two-year limit. As a result, the nomination went to John W. Stewart, who easily won the general election and went on to serve the first two-year term. Hendee returned to elective office in 1872 when he was elected as a Republican to represent Vermont's 3rd congressional district in the Forty-third Congress, succeeding Worthington C. Smith. He was re-elected to the Forty-fourth and Forty-fifth Congresses, and served from March 4, 1873 to March 3, 1879. He served on the committee on private land claims and on the District of Columbia which drafted and secured passage of the law which changed the form of government of the District. The 3rd District included the six northern counties of Vermont and bridged the Green Mountains. Counting Hendee's three terms, it had been represented by someone from the west side of the mountains for six terms. Because of the Republican Party's desire for someone from the east side of the Green Mountains to have an opportunity to serve, in keeping with the Mountain Rule Hendee did not run in 1878, deferring to William W. Grout. (Grout lost the general election to Bradley Barlow, a Republican running as a \\"National Republican\\" with the support of the Greenback Party.) Hendee resumed the practice of law, and took a special interest in the breeding of Morgan horses. He was Vermont's national bank examiner from 1879 to 1885. Death Hendee died in Morrisville, Vermont, on December 6, 1906. He is interred at Pleasant View Cemetery in Morrisville.

In addition to serving in both houses of the state legislature, Johnson also served as a United States Representative. He was the father of Senator Hiram Warren Johnson. Early life Johnson was born in Syracuse, New York, on March 27, 1841. He attended the local schools, studied law, and was admitted to the bar in 1862. While establishing himself as a lawyer, Johnson served on the Syracuse Board of School Commissioners in 1862 and 1863. In 1863, Johnson was accused of falsifying endorsements on promissory notes worth $250 each. Unable to pay the debt, he hastily departed for Arizona Territory to accept a job arranged by his brother as a quartermaster's clerk for the Union Army.Arizona Territory. He held this position until the end of the American Civil War in April 1865, when he relocated to California. Move to California Johnson moved to California in 1865, and established himself in Sacramento, where he built a successful law practice, sold insurance, and became involved in other business ventures. He was able to satisfy his past debts, and the charges against him in Syracuse were dismissed. In addition to his legal and business activities, Johnson became involved in local government and politics as a Republican. From 1866 to 1879, Johnson was clerk of the Sacramento County Board of Swamp Land Commissioners, the body charged with planning and overseeing development and reclamation of marshes and bogs throughout the county. In 1867 he was the National Union Party candidate for county auditor; accused of illegal campaign practices for allegedly adding the names of non-existent voters to the rolls so he could cast ballots for himself, Johnson pleaded no contest and withdrew from the campaign. From 1868 to 1871 he was a clerk in the office of the state Surveyor General. Political career After his unsuccessful 1867 campaign, Johnson became a member of the Democratic Party. He served on the state Democratic Central Committee, and made unsuccessful runs for the California State Senate in 1871 and 1875. In his 1871 campaign, several ballots were discovered to have been tampered with; someone used disappearing ink to cause the name of Johnson's opponent to disappear and Johnson's to appear after the ballots had been marked. Election officials observed the alterations and confiscated the suspect ballots, but no charges were brought against Johnson. Following his 1875 loss, Johnson rejoined the Republicans. He won a seat in the California State Assembly in 1877, and served from 1878 to 1879. In 1879 he was elected to the State Senate, and he served from 1880 to 1882.

The partnership consisted of Brooklyn Botanic Garden, Brooklyn Children's Museum, Brooklyn Museum, Brooklyn Public Library, Prospect Park and Prospect Park Zoo. History Seeking a way in which to encourage visitors to Manhattan to see New York City's other four boroughs, the six organizations came together to promote Brooklyn as a cultural destination. Although it was officially founded in 2001, the organizations had been working together on an unofficial level since 1998 with the launching of the program's summer camp, called Brooklyn Cultural Adventures Program or BCAP. Through the formal partnership established in 2001 and launched on Valentine's Day in 2002, the group was able to expand its offerings and better pool its resources. Th group ceased operations on Valentine's Day 2013, although BCAP was continued. Activities HOB ran the Brooklyn Cultural Adventures Program (BCAP), a program and summer camp based at HOB's member institutions. The camp is designed to engage children in cultural activities during the summer as well as introduce them to the organizations and their collections thereby attracting a new generation of cultural consumers. Heart of Brooklyn's goal was to make its organizations more visible and accessible. The partnership runs a free shuttle service called The HOB Connection, announced in November 2008, which delivers passengers to its cultural institutions. The new service is designed to help tourists in Manhattan and residents of Brooklyn reach the cultural hub surrounding Prospect Park. HOB also worked with local merchants and community leaders on neighborhood revitalization efforts, having been selected as a Core Provider for Avenue NYC as well as participating in the NYC Clean Streets program. HOB was a member of and active participant in the Washington Avenue-Prospect Heights Merchants Association (WAPHA). In addition, HOB's collaboration with Brooklyn Borough Hall produced tourism initiatives geared toward marketing the borough as a whole, such as Brooklyn Pass. The Pass includes free or reduced admission to participating organizations as well as discounts at other venues throughout the Borough. HOB published a monthly newsletter entitled Heartbeat, and in May 2009, published the Extraordinary Places in the Heart of Brooklyn coupon booklet in cooperation with neighborhood shops and businesses.

Miller, who was a known bank robber, had just testified in court against his whole gang and would have to go into hiding as soon as he was released.

Discrimination This type of discrimination can take a number of forms, ranging from refusing to hire someone because they are considered to be too short or too tall, to treating overweight and underweight individuals with disdain. There aren't currently any specific anti-discrimination laws that have been put in place to prohibit sizeism, despite the issue being extremely prevalent. Sizeist stereotypes (such as \\"overweight people are lazy\\" or \\"tall people can play basketball\\") are often ingrained in modern society. In the US, the list of anti-discrimination acts does not specifically include sizeism as an offense.Antidiscrimination (EEO) Law Information, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. June 15, 2011. Web. 26 April 2012. The EOCC website states \\"Height and weight requirements tend to disproportionately limit the employment opportunities of some protected groups and unless the employer can demonstrate how the need is related to the job, it may be viewed as illegal under federal law. A number of states and localities have laws specifically prohibiting discrimination on the basis of height and weight unless based on actual job requirements. Therefore, unless job-related, inquiries about height and weight should be avoided.\\" Therefore, size discrimination in the workplace is only illegal under federal law if it is not a job requirement. Characteristics Sizeism can be based on height, weight or both, and so is often related to height and weight-based discrimination but is not synonymous with either. Depending on where in the world one is and how one lives his/her life, people may have a tendency to be especially tall, slender, short, or plump, and many societies have internalized attitudes about size. Another manifestation of body variance is muscle mass and skeletal size, often with associations of degree of compliance to one's born sex, but do not necessarily affect gender to deviate from sex. As a general rule, sizeist attitudes imply that someone believes that his or her size is superior to that of other people and treat people of other sizes negatively. Examples of sizeist discrimination might include a person being fired from a job for being overweight or exceptionally short though their work was unaffected. Sizeism often takes the form of a number of stereotypes about people of particular heights and weights. Sizeist attitudes can also take the form of expressions of physical disgust when confronted with people of differing sizes and can even manifest into specific phobias such as cacomorphobia (the fear of fat people), or a fear of tall or short people. Sizeism, being a newly recognized discriminatory stance, is usually observed by those who are its targets. Sizeism is aligned with the social construction of the ideal or \\"normal\\" body shape and size and how that shapes our environment. In the U.S. we can observe many public facilities shaped by this \\"normative\\" body including; telephone booths, drinking fountains, bleachers, bathroom outlets (sinks, toilets, stalls), chairs, tables, turnstiles, elevators, staircases, vending machines, doorways...to name a few. Design assumptions are drawn about the size and shape of the users (height, weight, proportionate length of arms and legs, width of hips and shoulders).Susan M. Shaw, Janet Lee, Oregon State University. Women's Voices, Feminist Visions : Classic and Contemporary Readings. New York, NY :McGraw-Hill, 2015. Print. Body-shaming, more specifically weight-shaming of men and women, is a widely known characteristic of sizeism, shown in the form of prejudice and discrimination can include both skinny shaming and fat shaming. Prevalence Based on data analysis done on a survey of over 3,000 Americans, weight and height discrimination, a form of sizeism, was ranked just behind gender, age, and race as a highly experienced factor of discrimination. Among female respondents, weight and height discrimination exceeds race-based discrimination as the third most prevalent form of experienced discrimination. This discrimination was experienced in multiple settings, including from employers, interactions within the health- care field, in educational atmospheres, as well as within personal and familial relationships. Greater prevalence was found to exist within those respondents who were self-reported as female, with 10% of female respondents reporting having experienced weight and height discrimination, compared to 5% of male respondents . For younger women, these numbers illustrated still an increase: 14.1% of women with a reported age range of 35-44 years old expressed experiencing weight and height based discrimination, and women who identified between 45-54 years of age were nearly five times more likely to have experienced weight and height based discrimination than their 65-74 year old counterparts. The study also found that African-American women were more likely to experience weight and height discrimination, with 23.9% of respondents having reported an incident. The women most affected are those who identify as belonging to the highest weight category. Those women reported as moderately obese, or those with a Body mass index of 30-35, were found to be three times more likely than their male counterparts of a similar weight to experience weight based discrimination. Countermeasures Despite substantial research documenting weight discrimination and its negative impact on the lives of those targeted, under the US Constitution and federal law, it is legal to discriminate on the basis of weight. With the exception of the state of Michigan and several localities (i.e., San Francisco and Santa Cruz in California; Washington, DC; Urbana, Illinois; Binghamton, New York; and Madison, Wisconsin) that have passed legislation explicitly prohibiting weight-based discrimination, Americans have no viable means for seeking legal recourse in the face of weight discrimination, and existing US civil rights laws prohibit discrimination only on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, and national origin. Some individuals have attempted to file discrimination lawsuits under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), but plaintiffs must prove that their weight is a disability or perceived to be a disability according to ADA definitions, which is not the case for many people. Thus, few cases have been successful under this law and most of these successes have occurred since 2009, after Congress passed the ADA Amendments Act, which expanded the definitions of disability to include ‚Äúsevere obesity‚Äù (but not moderate obesity, overweight or underweight) as an impairment. For example, in 2012, the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) successfully settled 2 cases for employees who were terminated from their jobs because their employers regarded them to be disabled based on their obesity and their severe obesity was now a covered disability under the new amendment. Despite these few recent successes, not all weight discrimination occurs in the context of disability or perceived disability, and legal remedies that can directly address weight discrimination as a legitimate social injustice remain absent.

The most notable action of Helgesen in his Congressional career was that he was a key figure between 1911 and 1916 in Congressional activity in support of the claims of Dr. Frederick Cook with regard to being the first explorer to reach the North Pole, and a corresponding demand to take back the promotion of Robert Peary to the rank of rear admiral. Research by William R. Hunt into this matter showed that Helgesen's staff in Washington included an aide, Ernest C. Rost, who was a professional photographer and a friend of Dr. Cook. Later it turned out that Rost was a hired lobbyist for Cook. Helgesen read into the Congressional Record of 1915 published pamphlets and newspaper articles in support of Cook. However, a year later Cook went on a trip to Asia, and Helgesen denounced Cook as a fraud. It cannot be ascertained if there is any connection but Cook was being sued for non-payment of salary owed to Rost at this time. Further activity by Helgesen ended with his death in April 1917.

He served two terms as Arizona Territory's delegate in the United States House of Representatives and three times in the Arizona Territorial Legislature. Background Stevens was born in Weston, Vermont on March 20, 1832. He grew up in Weston where he obtained only a \\"limited education.\\" The 1850 census shows he was working there as a farmer. In 1851, Stevens enlisted in the army and became part of Company I, United States 1st Dragoons. He saw action during his military tour against the Apache in New Mexico Territory. After three years of service he received an honorable discharge while at Fort Thorn. Following his discharge, Stevens proceeded to Tucson with only a brief stop along the San Pedro River. There he operated a ranch near Sentinel Peak before opening a store in Sacaton in 1858. That year, on August 28, he was baptized at a Catholic church in Tucson under the name \\"Steven Augustus Hiram.\\" Following the outbreak of the American Civil War, Stevens left Tucson for a time. He returned to the town in 1864 and was appointed one of Tucson's \\"councillors\\" by Governor Goodwin on May 11. The next year he formed a partnership with Samuel C. Hughes to jointly supply the \\"Mariposa Store.\\" The two men engaged in a variety of business partnerships over the years, occasionally including Hughes' younger brother, Thomas, in their endeavors. In addition to their business partnership the two men became brothers-in-law. Stevens married Petra Santa Cruz while Hughes married her older sister, Atanacia. The Stevens had two adopted children: Elisa and Thomas. From 1866 until 1872 Stevens was a post trader for Fort Buchanan and Fort Crittenden. He was forced to close his operation when it was discovered he had been selling alcohol to the soldiers illegally. In 1876, Stevens and Hughes formed Hughes, Stevens & Company. The firm was active in cattle, mercantile, and mining interests. At the peak of his career, Stevens also owned a sheep ranch in Colorado and was worth an estimated US$150,000. This made him one of the richest men in the territory. Political career Stevens's success in business prompted him to take an interest in politics. He served as Tucson city treasurer, Pima County tax assessor, and was a member of the Pima County Board of Supervisors on multiple occasions. In 1868, Stevens was elected to represent the 5th Arizona Territorial Legislature where he represented Pima County in the House of Representatives (lower house). The session even met in a building owned by Stevens. Stevens was returned to the legislature twice more, serving in the Council (upper house) of both the 6th and 7th Arizona Territorial Legislature. In 1874, Richard Cunningham McCormick decided not to run for reelection as Arizona Territory's delegate in the United States House of Representatives. The territory's Democrats met in Phoenix in May to select nominees for the upcoming election. The two candidates for the Territorial Delegate were Stevens and John A. Rush. With delegates from Yavapai and Yuma counties not yet arrived, the convention selected Rush by an 8 to 7 vote. Rush refused to accept the nomination and withdrew as a candidate on July 24, 1874. The election then became a five-way race with all candidates running as Independents. Stevens and Charles T. Hayden favored Democratic policies while Curtis Coe Bean and John Smith advocated those of the Republican party. The fifth candidate, stagecoach driver David G. Beardsley, ran as the \\"workingman's candidate\\". Stories of the day indicate Stevens enlisted the territory's gamblers to aid his campaign. To do this he is said to have loaned them money to bet on his victory in the election, allowing the gamblers to keep any winnings and asking only for the sum of the wagers to be returned. The election also saw 650 questionable votes for Bean thrown out by the Yavapai County Board of Supervisors. Final results were 1,442 for Stevens, 1,076 for Bean, 638 for Smith, 13 for Hayden and 7 for Beardsley. Rumors of a possible special session of the U.S. Congress being called prompted Stevens to leave for Washington D. C. on March 3, 1875. The special session never materialized and Stevens kept himself busy in Washington looking after his business concerns. After the 44th United States Congress convened in December, the new territorial delegate introduced a series of legislative proposals. Among these were requests for funds to construction of a territorial capital and penitentiary, creating of a port of entry in Tucson, and navigation improvements along the Colorado River. One of Stevens' bills that was passed by the Congress allowed the territorial legislature to overrule the Governor's veto with a two-thirds vote. A bill to allow for election of the territorial governor was defeated. Stevens announced he would seek a second term on June 21, 1876. His opponents were Granville H. Oury and William H. Hardy. Curtis Coe Bean announced his intention to run but withdrew to look after his business interests. During the race, the territorial newspapers expected the incumbent to win reelection. When the election results were being totaled, the Yavapai County Board of Supervisors, in a 2-1 decision, attempted to disqualify 168 votes for Stevens on the grounds that they came from two towns where residents had not paid their poll tax. This was done despite the tax not being due till December 31 and the board's decision to accept the votes from several other towns with similar circumstances but that had voted for a different candidate. A provision in territorial law required the Territorial Secretary to accept the vote canvas provided by the County Recorder thwarted the board's efforts and resulted in Stevens winning a plurality of the vote. Final results were 1,194 for Stevens, 1,049 for Hardy, and 1,007 for Oury. The 45th United States Congress saw Stevens introduce several new proposals. In addition to a series of appropriation requests, the delegate asked for a modification to the amount of land allocated for army use at Fort Lowell. More important was a change in the size of the Arizona Territorial Legislature. With Arizona's population having grown to around 40,000, Stevens convinced the U.S. Congress to increase the size of the legislature from its previous nine member Council and eighteen member House of Representatives to twelve and twenty-four members respectively. June 7, 1878 saw Stevens announce his plans to run for a third term. His reelection bid was unsuccessful as he placed third in a five-way race during the 1878 election. After office Business activities occupied Stevens' time after he left office. The early 1880s saw him purchase a ranch near Sahuarita and become part owner in the largest general store in Tucson. He additionally became a moneylender, charging the prevailing rate of 2%/month. When Tucson was considering conversion from gas to electric lighting in 1884, Stevens was a major opponent of the proposal. Following his death it was discovered he owned 100,000 shares of Tucson Gas Company stock. In other activities, Stevens was the second President of Arizona Pioneers' Historical Society. Tucson's first Protestant church was built on land he donated and he is credited with planting the area's first pepper trees. Stevens died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound on March 22, 1893. His business interests had taken a downturn with creditors filing for attachment four days before Stevens' death. Stevens shot his wife, inflicting only a minor wound, and then turned a second gun on himself.

Early life and education  Bisbee was born on May 1, 1839 in Canton, Maine. Bisbee began attending Tufts College in Massachusetts, but halted his studies in 1861 when the American Civil War broke out. Bisbee enlisted in the Union Army with the 5th Massachusetts Militia as a private until July 1861, when he was appointed as a captain in the 9th Maine Infantry. He eventually rose to the ranks of lieutenant colonel and later colonel. Bisbee retired from the army in March 1863 and returned to Tufts College, graduating later that year.  Political career  Bisbee moved to Chicago, Illinois in late 1863 and was admitted into the Illinois Bar in 1864. After the end of the war in 1865, Bisbee moved to Jacksonville, Florida and established his law practice there. In 1869, President Ulysses S. Grant appointed Bisbee as the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Florida. In this position, Bisbee, a Republican, made acquaintance with several high-profile Floridians, including Governor Harrison Reed and lawyer Joseph E. Lee, who was one of the most prominent black Republicans in Florida at the time. In 1872, Bisbee was temporarily appointed as the eleventh Florida Attorney General by Reed. He stepped down when lawyer J. P. C. Emmons was chosen to permanently fill the position. During his appointment, he was still serving as a U.S. Attorney. He resigned as U.S. Attorney in 1873. = U.S. House of Representatives = In 1876, Bisbee was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, representing Florida's recently created 2nd congressional district. Bisbee defeated Democratic incumbent Jesse J. Finley by just three votes. Finley successfully contested the election and was seated on February 20, 1879, less than a month before the term expired. As Finley was not seated until after the election of 1878, Bisbee was technically still the incumbent leading into that election. Bisbee was defeated by Democratic Lieutenant Governor Noble A. Hull by just 22 votes. Bisbee successfully contested the election, taking the seat on January 22, 1881, again just a month and half before the term expired. In the year before, during the 1880 elections, Hull, the technical incumbent going into the election, did not seek reelection. Bisbee and Finley again ran as the Republican and Democratic nominees, respectively. Once again, Finley won, but the election was contested by Bisbee. On June 1, 1882, Bisbee was declared the winner, meaning he would be the incumbent entering the 1882 election. In the 1882 election, Bisbee won a decisive and undisputed victory over Finley. Bisbee ran for reelection in 1884, losing to Charles Dougherty, the former Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives. After this loss, Bisbee retired from politics, returning to private practice.  Personal life  At some point after his retirement, Bisbee married Charlotte Randolph. They had a daughter, Florence, in 1885. Bisbee and his wife returned to Maine leaving their daughter in Jacksonville with her husband and his family.  Death and burial  Bisbee died in Dixfield, Maine on March 27, 1916. He is buried with his wife, who died twelve years later, in Dixfield's Greenwood Cemetery.

He is remembered as the author of the Wilcox Municipal Bankruptcy Act, which became law in 1934, a bill which initially allowed a city in his district, West Palm Beach, to adjust its bonded indebtedness and avoid bankruptcy. It was later invoked to help New York City avoid bankruptcy in 1972. Biography =Early years= James Mark Wilcox, commonly known by his middle name, was born May 21, 1890 in Willacoochee, Georgia, the second son of Dr. Jefferson Taylor Wilcox and his wife Marian Henson Wilcox.\\"James Mark Wilcox (1890-1956),\\" Biographical Dictionary of the United States Congress, 1774-Present. Washington, DC: US Government Printing Office. (Public domain source). He attended public schools and Emory University. After graduation from Emory, he worked as a teacher before attending law school at Mercer University. He graduated from Mercer in 1910 and was admitted to the bar the same year; he commenced practice in Hazlehurst, Georgia. Wilcox married the former Lyde Christine Helm (1892-1973) of Birmingham, Alabama on November 27, 1910. The couple would have two sons, James Mark Wilcox, Jr. (1915-1995) and Joel C. Wilcox, Sr. (1918-2009). Wilcox served as the solicitor of Jeff Davis County, Georgia from 1911 until 1918. The following year he moved to Brunswick, Georgia, then in 1925 to West Palm Beach, Florida, where he continued to practice law. He served as city attorney of West Palm Beach from 1928 until 1933 and as a member of the taxation committee of President Herbert Hoover's Conference on Home Ownership in 1931. =Political career= Wilcox was elected to Congress in 1932, defeating two-term Congressional representative Ruth Bryan Owen in the June Democratic primary. Wilcox was elected to the Seventy-third, Seventy-fourth, and Seventy-fifth Congresses and served from March 4, 1933 to January 3, 1939. In Congress authored HR Bill 3151 in 1937 which recommended separating the Air Corps from the Army and making it an independent service. He also authored the Wilcox Municipal Bankruptcy Act which became law in 1934; it allowed West Palm Beach to adjust its bonded indebtedness and avoid bankruptcy. It was later invoked to help New York City avoid bankruptcy in 1972. He was not a candidate for Congress in 1938, instead choosing to make a run for the Democratic nomination for United States Senator, a campaign which was ultimately unsuccessful. In a congressional discussion on the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1937, Wilcox expressed the importance and concern of Southern Democrats in maintaining wage disparities among races. \\"[T]here is another matter of great importance in the South and that is the problem of our Negro labor. There has always been a difference in the wage scale of white and colored labor. So long as Florida people are permitted to handle the matter, the delicate and perplexing problem can be adjusted; but the Federal Government knows no color line and of necessity, it cannot make any distinction between the races. We may rest assured, therefore, that when we turn over to a federal bureau or board the power to fix wages, it will prescribe the same wages for the Negro that it prescribes for the white man. Now, such a plan might work in some sections of the United State but those of us who know the true situation know that it just will not work in the South. You cannot put the Negro and the white man on the same basis and get away with it.\\" Texas Law Review, 65 (1987), p.1347 =Later years, death, and legacy= Following his 1938 electoral defeat Wilcox resumed the practice of law in Miami, Florida. Later, he served as attorney for the Dade County Port Authority/Greater Miami Traffic Association from 1945 until his death at his farm, ChrisMar, in White Springs, Florida on February 3, 1956.

She earned her MFA from the Ume√• Academy of Fine Arts in 2004, and her recent awards include artist-in-residence at the Bemis Center for Contemporary Arts in Omaha, Nebraska (2007), the IASPIS International Exchange (2006), a Swedish Visual Arts Fund Project Grant (2005), NIFCA Nordic Air Residency in Tallinn, Estonia (2005) and two grants from the JC Kempes Foundation (2003/2004). Together with Po Hagstrom, Holmstedt is part of artist duo Trial and Error , working with projects related to national identity and the use of public space. Holmstedt also co-founded SQUID , an online project which facilitates a space for the parallel knowledge that emerges from an investigative, creative process. Janna Holmstedt works with image, text, video and installation, usually in relation to a specific site and/or situation. She employs storytelling as a tool for critical engagement and as a way to deal with and make sense of the constant flow of information in everyday life. In her work, she seeks to situate a subject within a context that is not framed as an absolute truth or stable reality, but rather as a system that unfolds through a specific network where meanings are constructed. In her video- and sound installations involving voice-overs, Holmstedt focuses on the tension between an existentially defined \\"inner\\" space and that which we typically perceive as an \\"outer\\" space of politics and everyday life. She finds the borderland where these two fields meet, collide and interact - that is, where our sense of individuality and reality is represented - as the most interesting to investigate.  Web based Projects  =Trial and Error= external website Collaboration with Po Hagstr√∂m, ongoing since 2005. Trial and Error work with projects related to national identity and the use of public space. The duo was formed in 2005 when the project ‚ÄùMonument for the Masses‚Äù was first conceived, this in response to a huge monument which is going to be erected in Tallinn, Estonia. Trial-and-error is a method for solving problems and obtaining knowledge. Holmstedt and Hagstr√∂m use it to scrutinize situations and concepts they find intriguing. The online project ‚ÄùMonument for the Masses‚Äù consists of a proposal for a counter-monument to the city of Tallinn and a campaign to gain support for the proposal. At the website you find articles about how national heroes are constructed; French identity-soup; nation branding; the privatisation of public space; ruin value; the protests among the Taino people against a monument to Columbus in Puerto Rico, and much more. It is also possible to contribute to the Park for (Un)wanted Sculptures . This virtual sculpture park has been inspired by the Szobor Park in Hungary and is a growing archive of public art that for different reasons is unwanted. \\"Monument for the Masses\\" was exhibited at Tallinn City Gallery , Estonia, Sep-Oct, 2006. The online project is represented at Rhizome.org at the New Museum of Contemporary Art , New York. =SQUID= external website Collaborative project with Katja Aglert , ongoing since 2004. SQUID is a text focused project which aims to make cultural producers‚Äô substantial knowledge available to a wider audience. Artists, writers, curators, philosophers among others from different countries are continually being invited to write in relation to the engagement and interests which runs through, or parallel to their own work. SQUID focuses on the local experiences derived from diverse individual or collective practices and isn't necessarily limited to being a discussion of art per se. SQUID can be seen as an expanding archive on the internet but also an initiator of public events such as for example readings, open talks etc. SQUID has been invited to Tensta konsthall , ak28 and Ersta konsthall in Stockholm and to the Russian magazine Chto delat?/What is to be done? , which is part of the Documenta Magazine Project .

The cradle scythe has an additional arrangement of fingers attached to the snaith (snath or snathe) to catch the cut grain so that it can be cleanly laid down in a row with the grain heads aligned for collection and efficient threshing. History An early Swedish scythe from a painting by Per S√∂dermark American cradle (patent drawing) As the cultivation of grain developed, the seasonal harvest became a major agricultural event. Grain could be pulled or, later, cut with a sickle and tied into sheaves to be threshed. The scythe improved on the sickle by giving the mower a more ergonomic stance and permitting a larger blade. However, keeping the grain stems aligned in the windrow required great skill and where these skills were less available the addition of a cradle helped to manage the grain heads, reducing the sheaver's work-load and improving efficiency at threshing. Lesser skilled mowers could harvest significantly more grain by using the cradle.\\"American Grain Cradles\\", Richard Van Vleck, http://www.americanartifacts.com/smma/grain/cradle.htm Although the grain cradle was in previous use in parts of Europe it was not generally used because skilled labour was traditionally available. Between 1800 and 1840 the cradle was widely adopted in the expanding grain growing area of Midwestern United States, undergoing some refinement there and resulting in the American-pattern cradle. Fifty American patents were issued between 1823 and 1930, the first in 1823 in western New York state and the last in 1924 in West Virginia peaking between 1875 and 1900.\\"American Grain Cradles\\" http://www.americanartifacts.com/smma/grain/decade.htm Hay does not require aligning and the scythe is more efficient without a cradle, so it was removed for haymaking. Decline The cradle was commonly used throughout the 1800s and into the beginning of the 20th century, in part because many of the smaller farms were not designed for mechanical reaping and in part because there were still a great number of smaller farms where the mechanical reaper was not economical. However, by the end of the 19th century the cradle had been generally replaced by the mechanical reaper, a horse-drawn (or tractor- drawn) machine patented by Cyrus McCormick in 1834, and later by other mechanical methods of harvesting such as the combine harvester.

One way to do this is to take b = ‚àía. * If there exists a unit vector u in X that is not an extreme point of the closed unit ball in X, then there exist points a and b in B such that there is equality in (1) but b ‚â† ¬±a. Carath√©odory length of a tangent vector There is an associated notion of Carath√©odory length for tangent vectors to the ball B. Let x be a point of B and let v be a tangent vector to B at x; since B is the open unit ball in the vector space X, the tangent space TxB can be identified with X in a natural way, and v can be thought of as an element of X. Then the Carath√©odory length of v at x, denoted Œ±(x, v), is defined by :\\\\alpha (x, v) = \\\\sup \\\\big\\\\\\\\{  \\\\mathrm{D} f(x) v  \\\\big f : B \\\\to \\\\Delta \\\\mbox{ is holomorphic} \\\\big\\\\\\\\}.

In the battery industry, the term \\"depolarizer\\" has been used to denote a substance used in a primary cell to prevent buildup of hydrogen gas bubbles.\\"McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Scientific & Technical Terms\\", McGraw-Hill, Inc., 2003. A battery depolarizer takes up electrons during discharge of the cell; therefore, it is always an oxidizing agent. The term \\"depolarizer\\" can be considered as outdated or misleading, since it is based on the concept of \\"polarization\\" which is hardly realistic in many cases. Polarization Under certain conditions for some electrochemical cells, especially if they use an aqueous electrolyte, hydrogen ions can be converted into hydrogen atoms and H2 molecules. In the extreme case, bubbles of hydrogen gas might appear at one of the electrodes. If such a layer of hydrogen or even H2 gas bubbles appear on the positive plate of a battery, they interfere with the chemical action of the cell. An electrode covered with gases is said to be polarized. Polarization in galvanic cells causes the voltage and thus current to be reduced, especially if the bubbles cover a large fraction of a plate. Depolarizers are substances which are intended to remove the hydrogen, and therefore, they help to keep the voltage at a high level. However, this concept is outdated, since if enough depolarizer is present, it will react directly in most cases by getting electrons from the positive plate of the galvanic cell, i.e. there will be no relevant amount of hydrogen gas present. Therefore, the original concept of polarization does not apply to most batteries, and the depolarizer does not react with hydrogen as H2. Still, the term is used today, however, in most cases, it might be replaced with oxidizing agent. Many different substances have been used as depolarizers; the most notable are listed below. Oxidizing agents These oxidize the hydrogen to water. Examples include: * Nitric acid, used in the Grove cell and Bunsen cell * Chromic acid, used in the Chromic acid cell * Manganese dioxide, used in the Leclanch√© cell and Dry cell Nitric and chromic acids are powerful oxidizing agents, and effective depolarizers, but their hazardous nature makes them unsuitable for general use. Manganese dioxide is, therefore, the most widely used depolarizer. Salts of metals The hydrogen ions displace metal from the salt so that metal, instead of hydrogen, is deposited on the positive plate. Examples: * Silver oxide, used in the Silver-oxide battery * Copper sulphate, used in the Daniell cell * Mercurous sulphate, used in the Weston and Clark standard cells References * Everyman's Encyclopaedia, 1931, volume 3, pp. 520‚Äì522 External links * Telegraph batteries Category:Battery (electricity) Category:Electrochemistry ","title":"Depolarizer"},{"id":"11543717","text":"James Francis O'Connor (May 7, 1878 ‚Äì January 15, 1945) was a U.S. Representative from Montana.

With MCP, merchants can sell the same item to British customers in pounds sterling, French and German customers in Euros, and Japanese customers in Yen. A sales tool that helps merchants expand into other sectors of the global marketplace, MCP allows cardholders to shop, view prices and pay in the currency of their choice. Currently this feature is available for Visa and MasterCard networks only. For example, a Japanese consumer browsing a US-based web-site with MCP functionality may view prices in US dollars, or in Japanese Yen. The consumer is then given the option to pay in the currency of his or her choice. If the customer chooses to pay in Yen, this service guarantees that this exact Japanese yen amount will be debited to the cardholder account, and the exact US dollar amount will be credited to the merchant's account. The cardholder is not charged any additional fees for this service. Among the biggest advantages to merchants according to proponents: * Ability to localize websites and expand to other regions * Cater to international customers by pricing in a currency they understand and feel more comfortable with, while continuing to receive settlement and reporting in one currency * Reduces customer service inquiries and chargebacks The MCP solution is mostly found in card not present (internet, mail-order/telephone-order) environments, but can also be used as a terminal application in card present (POS) environments.

VRA was founded in 1982 by slide librarians (visual resources curators) who were members of the College Art Association (CAA), the South Eastern Art Conference (SECAC), the Art Libraries Society of North America (ARLIS/NA), and the Mid-America College Art Association (MACAA). The association is concerned with creating, describing, and distributing digital images and other media; educating image professionals; and developing standards. The Visual Resources Association Foundation, a 501 C-3 organization created by the VRA, supports research and education in visual resources, and provides educational, literary, and scientific outreach to the archival and library community and the general public. Goals The association is a multi-disciplinary organization whose purpose is furthering research and education in the field of image management in educational, cultural heritage, and commercial environments. The VRA develops standards, offers educational programs, and publishes a variety of material. It offers a forum for preservation of and access to digital and analog images of visual culture; cataloging and classification standards and practices; integration of technology-based instruction and research; intellectual property policy; and other topics of interest to the field. It works with the broader information management and educational communities to support the primacy of visual information in documenting and understanding the cultural experience. Membership In 2010, the VRA had 800 members, mostly from the United States and Canada, but also from Israel, Mexico, and the United Kingdom. The membership includes: information specialists; digital image specialists; art, architecture, film and video librarians; museum curators; slide, photograph, microfilm, and digital archivists; architectural firms; galleries; publishers; image system vendors; rights and reproductions officials; photographers; art historians; artists; and scientists. There are thirteen local chapters, including Canada Great Lakes Greater New York International Mid-Atlantic Midwest New England Northern California Pacific Rim Southeast Southern California Texas Upstate New York The VRA Board consists of seven officers. The 2014 President is Elaine Paul, University of Colorado Boulder; the previous President was Jolene de Verges, Southern Methodist University History From 1968, visual resources curators had been meeting during the College Art Association's annual conferences to discuss issues of particular interest to those involved with the management of art slide collections. During the next few years, the group remained essentially an ad hoc committee.'Adapted from the History page on the VRA official web site. By the late 1970s, regional and international activity had begun. The Comit√© International d‚ÄôHistoire de l‚ÄôArt (CIHA) recognized the visual resources subgroup as an important part of that international association. Visual resources sessions were provided during its conference in Bologna in 1979, and continued for almost 20 years. The Southeastern College Art Conference (SECAC) and the Mid-America College Art Association (MACAA) included visual resources sessions at their conferences. Visual resources curators within the MACAA group, led by Nancy DeLaurier of the University of Missouri, Kansas City, met during MACAA‚Äôs annual conferences. In 1972, this group began to meet independently, creating workshops and sessions on various aspects of visual resources maintenance. For the workshops, members developed several kits for the benefit of attending visual resources managers. These kits included information on slide room management, standards, and other practical aspects of the profession. This group also created a newsletter, Slides and Photographs Newsletter, which contained news and information on issues of concern to members. This newsletter was supported by CAA and later by MACAA and eventually became known as the International Bulletin for Photographic Documentation of the Visual Arts. In 1982, after almost a decade of informal association, visual resources curators active in CAA, MACAA, SECAC, and ARLIS/NA, formalized an independent association and held the first official meeting during the annual CAA meeting in Philadelphia in February 1983. In the 1990s, the explosion of the Internet and the consequent expansion of the visual resources field to include digital media expanded the role of the association. It led in the effort to develop public understanding of intellectual property rights, protocols for dissemination of digital material, standards of cataloging, and the importance of broad public access to digital cultural information. As an organization, it participated in the Copyright Town Meetings organized by the National Initiative for a Networked Cultural Heritage (NINCH) which were held across the country between 1997 and 2004, and were open to the public. The annual conferences began attracting non-members, while vraweb.org evolved into a source of information for students, professionals, free-lance photographers, even IPR rights managers. Cataloging Cultural Objects (CCO) gained national recognition as an attempt to standardize the cataloging of visual information, and its workshops, web site, and outreach efforts began educating a broad audience. The Education Committee sponsored conference workshops on topics of broad interest at the VRA conference and also at other professional conferences. The Digital Scene, a feature of vraweb.org, featured information on collaborative projects, new standards in imaging and metadata, digital preservation issues, consortial projects, training opportunities, and reports from the field. In 2004, the VRA, in conjunction with the ARLIS/NA, began offering a Summer Educational Institute to provide in-depth educational to new professionals.

The project was largely funded by the Getty Foundation. The guide was designed for those who describe and document works of art, architecture, and cultural artifacts.Baca, Murtha. 2006. Cataloging cultural objects: a guide to describing cultural works and their images. Chicago: American Library Association. VRA Core Categories Since the 1980s, VRA has worked on creating standards to describe images. To replace the earlier widely varying practices, the association created a common standard, the VRA Core Categories. Somewhat based on the Dublin Core model, the Core has grown from a list of elements describing art and architectural images to a data standard (with an XML schema to promote the sharing of records) for describing images. The first version was published in 1996, with revisions in 1998, 2002, 2004, and 2007 (resulting in the current version, 4.0.) . In November 2010, the Network Development and MARC Standards Office of the Library of Congress began hosting VRA Core 4 in partnership with the VRA. Core 4 is the only metadata standard designed specifically for the description of images and the cultural objects they represent. Core 4 is uniquely able to capture descriptive information about works and images, and indicate relationships between the two. Events =Annual Conference= The association's annual conference is held in a different city each year.
