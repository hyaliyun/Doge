Christian Wilhelm, his older brother, was a painter, architect and gallery director. In 1785, he went to Bremen and, from 1789 to 1791, engraved the tables and illustrations for the Schr√∂tersche Mondwerk by Johann Hieronymus Schr√∂ter. In 1796, together with the cartographer, , he helped create the Murtfeldtsche Karte; the first map of Bremen produced by using triangulation. In 1804, he did a copper engraved map of the Duchy of Oldenburg, based on drawings by the surveyor, Christoph Friedrich Mentz (1765-1832). In addition to maps, he produced portraits, cityscapes and landscapes.  Sources  * Herbert Schwarzw√§lder: Das Gro√üe Bremen-Lexikon.

The series ran on CBS radio from 1952-1954. The series was sponsored by the General Electric company and was usually recorded in Hollywood, although some shows were recorded in Palm Springs. The last seven shows of the first season were broadcast as though they had come from Paris, France but they had actually been recorded in the USA prior to Crosby‚Äôs departure for Europe. Overview Singer and entertainer Bing Crosby had finished a three-year engagement with Chesterfield cigarettes on CBS radio which had ended in June 1952. Crosby remained with CBS and General Electric took over as sponsor for his show. The show was named The Bing Crosby Show for General Electric and premiered on Thursday, October 9, 1952. Notable guest stars and appearances on the series included Frank Sinatra, Jack Benny, Ella Fitzgerald, Connee Boswell, Bob Hope, Dinah Shore, Rosemary Clooney, Peggy Lee, The Bell Sisters and Kay Starr. The competition of television was causing radio audiences to fall away dramatically and the Crosby show had to adapt to this over its two-year run. Crosby is said to have been paid $16,000 per week which made it one of the most expensive shows on radio. This figure also had to cover the cost of staff and guests. =Season one= The format used for the Chesterfield show was followed with songs and chat. Variety liked the opening show, saying inter alia, ‚ÄúBing Crosby is back for another semester in radio and this time, flying the General Electric colours. Chesterfield gave him the go-by at the wind up of last season, along with Bob Hope, considering the weekly tab too high. The Hollywood and Vine reports have it that, as with Jack Benny before him, the production, accoutrements and bankroll on Bing‚Äôs showcase have been trimmed in keeping with the ‚Äòradio re-appraisal‚Äô, if so, GE has grabbed itself a good deal. For there is no perceptible change - so far as the listener is concerned - either in Crosby or his entourage.\\" The shows continued until July 2, 1953, and the audience share for the season was 6.5 which enabled the program to scrape into twentieth position in the Nielsen ratings. The top show was Amos 'n' Andy with 14.2. =Season two= The first show of the second season was broadcast on September 27, 1953, the series having been moved to Sunday nights. ‚ÄúWhere the Blue of the Night‚Äù was replaced as a theme song by an untitled orchestral piece written by Victor Young. Ken Carpenter and the John Scott Trotter Orchestra remained as fixtures. The shows were still being produced by Bill Morrow and Murdo MacKenzie and continued until May 30, 1954. The audience share was 6.0 for the season which earned the show seventh place in the Nielsen ratings. The game show People Are Funny took top position with a rating of only 8.4 confirming that the public had deserted radio for television. Radical changes had been made to the Crosby broadcast with most shows being assembled piecemeal and put together for transmission. Usually audiences were not present and recordings of earlier audience reactions were dubbed in creating the illusion of a ‚Äúlive‚Äù recording. Typically Crosby would spend Sundays recording material for the shows. Expensive guest stars were rarely used and Crosby employed his sons - Gary, Dennis, Phillip and Lindsay - frequently on the show. Jud Conlon‚Äôs Rhythmaires were not used in this second series and a regular spot was established for the Orchestra to play an instrumental version of a well-known song. A notable guest however was Frank Sinatra who appeared around the time when he had been nominated as Best Supporting Actor for his role in ‚ÄúFrom Here to Eternity‚Äù. Whilst the songs and the chat continued, the ‚Äònormal‚Äô commercials were abandoned in favour of several minutes of ‚Äòdiscussion‚Äô between Crosby and Ken Carpenter, on such heavyweight subjects as ‚ÄòGovernment‚Äô, ‚ÄòCommunism‚Äô and ‚ÄòCollectivism‚Äô. It was the time when McCarthyism was rife but even so the propaganda must have been hard going for the listeners. Variety was positive about the opening show saying, ‚ÄúSunday is now Bingsday on CBS Radio and no matter where you move him, the loyal will find him. His voice and personality have the magic of the Pied Piper and even without his long-time ‚Äòthemer‚Äô (‚ÄúBlue of the Night‚Äô) he‚Äôll be fished out of the receiver‚Ä¶ General Electric preferred to have cross talk about people, rather than ‚Äúmove merchandise\\". Billboard was more cautious in its reaction. ‚ÄúBing Crosby returned to the air this week in good voice and a gay old mood... In a season in which Crosby is due to bow on TV on a somewhat regular basis, it‚Äôs worth noting that his current radio show is strictly a radio show, consisting of songs and pleasant chatter. While his zillions of fans would no doubt flock to see him do no more than that, it is nevertheless to be hoped that Bing will pay some attention to develop a really televisable format.\\" The series ended on May 30, 1954 and its ending was a little confusing. There were 39 shows in the first season for General Electric but only the 36 in the second. The usual ‚Äòdiscussion‚Äô between Crosby and Ken Carpenter, implied that they were summing up all the previous items of this nature but astonishingly, at the close of the program, Crosby is heard to say, ‚ÄúI hope to see you all again, next week, when our guest will be Miss Rosemary Clooney.‚Äù This information was re-iterated by Ken Carpenter in the closing announcements. In fact, it was planned that Gary Crosby would take over with his own show on the following Sunday. The confusion may have been due to Gary Crosby having a motor accident on May 24 and being treated for a lacerated nose and an injured knee. Gary Crosby‚Äôs debut had to be postponed until June 13 and his radio program replaced his father‚Äôs on CBS for the summer period of thirteen weeks before Gary began his third year at Stanford. Bing Crosby had decided not to continue with a weekly radio series and in November 1954, he returned to the airwaves with a five-nights a week 15-minute program called \\"The Bing Crosby Show\\".

The distinction between the two is that diffeomorphic metric maps satisfy the property that the length associated to their flow away from the identity induces a metric on the group of diffeomorphisms, which in turn induces a metric on the orbit of shapes and forms within the field of Computational Anatomy. The study of shapes and forms with the metric of diffeomorphic metric mapping is called diffeomorphometry. A diffeomorphic mapping system is a system designed to map, manipulate, and transfer information which is stored in many types of spatially distributed medical imagery. Diffeomorphic mapping is the underlying technology for mapping and analyzing information measured in human anatomical coordinate systems which have been measured via Medical imaging. Diffeomorphic mapping is a broad term that actually refers to a number of different algorithms, processes, and methods. It is attached to many operations and has many applications for analysis and visualization. Diffeomorphic mapping can be used to relate various sources of information which are indexed as a function of spatial position as the key index variable. Diffeomorphisms are by their Latin root structure preserving transformations, which are in turn differentiable and therefore smooth, allowing for the calculation of metric based quantities such as arc length and surface areas. Spatial location and extents in human anatomical coordinate systems can be recorded via a variety of Medical imaging modalities, generally termed multi-modal medical imagery, providing either scalar and or vector quantities at each spatial location. Examples are scalar T1 or T2 magnetic resonance imagery, or as 3x3 diffusion tensor matrices diffusion MRI and diffusion-weighted imaging, to scalar densities associated to computed tomography (CT), or functional imagery such as temporal data of functional magnetic resonance imaging and scalar densities such as Positron emission tomography (PET). Computational anatomy is a subdiscipline within the broader field of neuroinformatics within bioinformatics and medical imaging. The first algorithm for dense image mapping via diffeomorphic metric mapping was Beg's LDDMM for volumes and Joshi's landmark matching for point sets with correspondence, with LDDMM algorithms now available for computing diffeomorphic metric maps between non-corresponding landmarks and landmark matching intrinsic to spherical manifolds, curves, currents and surfaces, tensors, varifolds, and time-series. The term LDDMM was first established as part of the National Institutes of Health supported Biomedical Informatics Research Network. In a more general sense, diffeomorphic mapping is any solution that registers or builds correspondences between dense coordinate systems in medical imaging by ensuring the solutions are diffeomorphic. There are now many codes organized around diffeomorphic registration including ANTS, DARTEL, DEMONS, StationaryLDDMM, FastLDDMM, as examples of actively used computational codes for constructing correspondences between coordinate systems based on dense images. The distinction between diffeomorphic metric mapping forming the basis for LDDMM and the earliest methods of diffeomorphic mapping is the introduction of a Hamilton principle of least-action in which large deformations are selected of shortest length corresponding to geodesic flows. This important distinction arises from the original formulation of the Riemannian metric corresponding to the right-invariance. The lengths of these geodesics give the metric in the metric space structure of human anatomy. Non- geodesic formulations of diffeomorphic mapping in general does not correspond to any metric formulation. History of development Diffeomorphic mapping 3-dimensional information across coordinate systems is central to high- resolution Medical imaging and the area of Neuroinformatics within the newly emerging field of bioinformatics. Diffeomorphic mapping 3-dimensional coordinate systems as measured via high resolution dense imagery has a long history in 3-D beginning with Computed Axial Tomography (CAT scanning) in the early 80's by the University of Pennsylvania group led by Ruzena Bajcsy, and subsequently the Ulf Grenander school at Brown University with the HAND experiments. In the 90's there were several solutions for image registration which were associated to linearizations of small deformation and non-linear elasticity. The central focus of the sub-field of Computational anatomy (CA) within medical imaging is mapping information across anatomical coordinate systems at the 1 millimeter morphome scale. In CA mapping of dense information measured within Magnetic resonance image (MRI) based coordinate systems such as in the brain has been solved via inexact matching of 3D MR images one onto the other. The earliest introduction of the use of diffeomorphic mapping via large deformation flows of diffeomorphisms for transformation of coordinate systems in image analysis and medical imaging was by Christensen, Rabbitt and Miller and Trouve. The introduction of flows, which are akin to the equations of motion used in fluid dynamics, exploit the notion that dense coordinates in image analysis follow the Lagrangian and Eulerian equations of motion. This model becomes more appropriate for cross-sectional studies in which brains and or hearts are not necessarily deformations of one to the other. Methods based on linear or non-linear elasticity energetics which grows with distance from the identity mapping of the template, is not appropriate for cross-sectional study. Rather, in models based on Lagrangian and Eulerian flows of diffeomorphisms, the constraint is associated to topological properties, such as open sets being preserved, coordinates not crossing implying uniqueness and existence of the inverse mapping, and connected sets remaining connected. The use of diffeomorphic methods grew quickly to dominate the field of mapping methods post Christensen's original paper, with fast and symmetric methods becoming available. Such methods are powerful in that they introduce notions of regularity of the solutions so that they can be differentiated and local inverses can be calculated. The disadvantages of these methods is that there was no associated global least-action property which could score the flows of minimum energy. This contrasts the geodesic motions which are central to the study of Rigid body kinematics and the many problems solved in Physics via Hamilton's principle of least action. In 1998, Dupuis, Grenander and Miller established the conditions for guaranteeing the existence of solutions for dense image matching in the space of flows of diffeomorphisms. These conditions require an action penalizing kinetic energy measured via the Sobolev norm on spatial derivatives of the flow of vector fields. The large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping (LDDMM) code that Faisal Beg derived and implemented for his PhD at Johns Hopkins University developed the earliest algorithmic code which solved for flows with fixed points satisfying the necessary conditions for the dense image matching problem subject to least- action. Computational anatomy now has many existing codes organized around diffeomorphic registration including ANTS, DARTEL, DEMONS, LDDMM, StationaryLDDMM as examples of actively used computational codes for constructing correspondences between coordinate systems based on dense images. These large deformation methods have been extended to landmarks without registration via measure matching, curves, surfaces, dense vector and tensor imagery, and varifolds removing orientation. The diffeomorphism orbit model in computational anatomy Deformable shape in Computational Anatomy (CA)is studied via the use of diffeomorphic mapping for establishing correspondences between anatomical coordinates in Medical Imaging. In this setting, three dimensional medical images are modelled as a random deformation of some exemplar, termed the template I_{temp} , with the set of observed images element in the random orbit model of CA for images I \\\\in \\\\mathcal {I} \\\\doteq \\\\\\\\{ I=I_{temp} \\\\circ \\\\varphi, \\\\varphi \\\\in Diff_V \\\\\\\\} . The template is mapped onto the target by defining a variational problem in which the template is transformed via the diffeomorphism used as a change of coordinate to minimize a squared-error matching condition between the transformed template and the target. The diffeomorphisms are generated via smooth flows \\\\phi_t, t \\\\in [0,1] , with \\\\varphi \\\\doteq \\\\phi_1, satisfying the Lagrangian and Eulerian specification of the flow field associated to the ordinary differential equation, : \\\\frac{d}{dt} \\\\phi_t=v_t \\\\circ \\\\phi_t , \\\\ \\\\phi_0=id , with v_t, t \\\\in [0,1] the Eulerian vector fields determining the flow.

She had a successful fashion design career, with innovative designs such as her Tanagra dress. Rosa Genoni was the Italian delegate at the International Congress of Women, The Hague, Netherlands, 28 April - 10 May 1915. Her activism efforts along with her desire to make Italy a fashion leader were thwarted under Fascism. Biography Rosa Genoni (1867‚Äì1954) was born in the town of Tirano in Lombardy, about 40 miles from Milan. She was the eldest of 19 children, 12 surviving. She moved to Milan at ten years old to look for a job, and found one at a relative's dressmaker shop. By the age of eighteen, she qualified as a master seamstress. During this time she began to associate with those in Milan's socialist circles. She was a strong advocate for emancipation of women, and for their right to have access to education. Between 1884 and 1885, Genoni was sent to Paris as a delegate of the Italian Workers' Party, the predecessor to the Italian Socialist Party. She was the only woman to attend. Genoni remained in Paris and found work in a small Italian seamstress shop. While there, she immersed herself in the fashion world, perfecting her tailoring and embroidery techniques and going on to work in well-known and established fashion houses. Genoni soon moved back to Milan, determined to develop a 'Made in Italy' sensibility and bring awareness to the creative production in her home nation. Her activism pursuits unabated, she advocated on behalf of women's wage demands and participated in the protests against the exploitation of women's labor. While active in those causes, she met other women involved in socialist and feminist movements. The journalist, Anna Maria Mozzoni invited Genoni to participate in the Socialist-Labourist International Congress in Zurich. Genoni was also active with other women at the early days of the Lega femminile, which grouped seamstresses and milliners. This organization was an important advocate linking women's work in the clothing industry and production, to the wider context of the women's movement towards emancipation, the right to education, and equality. At one of the seamstress' protests Genoni met feminist and socialist leader, Anna Kuliscioff. Kulischoff became a customer of Genoni and a loyal friend. From the 1880s onwards, Genoni became more and more involved in the feminist movement, first with the radical left of Abigail Zanetta (1875‚Äì1945) and then with the more moderate and reformist ideas of Anna Kulishoff. Continuing the parallel threads of activism and fashion in her life, she was hired in 1895 by Maison H. Haardt et Fils, at that time an important Milanese fashion house with branches in Sanremo, Lucerna and St. Moritz. Genoni was promoted to Premiere in 1903, the same year her daughter Fanny was born out of her relationship with her companion, the lawyer Alfredo Podreider, who she met when she was part of the circle of Pietro Gori. In 1905, Genoni added teaching the history of costume at the Professional School for Women at the Societa Umanitaria in Milan to her job at Maison H. Haardt et Fils and to her commitment to activism for peace and women's rights. She also directed the dress-making department at the Societa Umanitaria, a job she held until 1925, at which time she refused to swear an oath of loyalty to fascism. Milan International (1906) At the time of the Milan Expo in 1906, Genoni was still working as a Premiere at the Milanese branch of Maison Haardt et Fils, mainly reproducing Parisian models. When she suggested participating, her boss responded that it was impossible because they were known for copying Parisian fashions. Yet, he did add that she can exhibit on her own behalf, which she did proudly. Genoni ended up preparing designs twice for the Expo. After a fire broke out on the grounds of the fair, devastating the building that housed Genoni's creations along with others, Genoni scrambled to complete new dresses for the Expo in a very short amount of time. Ultimately, Genoni achieved the recognition for her talents as a designer of dresses 'Made in Italy' that she craved: she was awarded the International Jury Grand Prix for two creations that were put on show at the Expo. Genoni documented her participation in the Expo in a booklet, Al visitatore (To the visitor 1906). In this booklet, Genoni expressed her intention to create a homegrown Italian fashion and style as an integral part of the rebirth of the arts in Italy at the time and a contribution to the building of a national identity. Fashion Rosa Genoni's inspiration came from three distinct periods: early Renaissance, Greco-Roman and classical antiquity, and the modern. Evening wear were inspired by the Renassaince painters Sandro Botticelli (Primavera) and Pisanello. She incorporated draping, folding, girding and pinning, building in the ability for the wearer to transform her Tanagra dress. The Tanagra dress was inspired by draping in the Tanagra figurines. The third period inspired by the modern energy exemplified in transportation and mobility led to a collection of casual wear, including dresses suitable for air travel. center Activism International Congress of Women in 1915. left to right:1.

In April, 1906, the first National Congress of Italian Women took place in Rome. This was the first official national meeting of the various women's associations and groups from all over Italy, grouped together as a council, Consiglio Nazionale delle Donne Italiane (CNDI). Founded in 1903, CNDI was the Italian branch of the International Council of Women founded in Washington in 1888. The Roman Congress was the first public and national forum in Italy of the women's feminist movement. The week long congress was organized around six themes: 1) Education and Instruction; 2) Assistance and Prevention; 3) Moral and Juridical Condition of Women; 4) Hygiene; 5) Art and Women's Literature; 6) Emigration. Rosa Genoni was one of the official speakers in the fifth section and delivered a speech entitled, \\"The Art of Dressing.\\" Along with many other notable women, including Jane Addams and Rosika Schwimmer, Rosa Genoni attended the International Congress of Women, 28 April - 1 May 1915, The Hague, Netherlands.Paull, John (2018) The Women Who Tried to Stop the Great War: The International Congress of Women at The Hague 1915, In A.

Rosa Genoni was monitored by the local security forces due to her pacifist activities and involvement in the anti-war campaign.

Despite the surveillance that she was subjected to and under threat during the years of the Great War and Fascism, Genoni continued to advocate for peace. She attacked the Futurists' position in favor of the war and wrote plainly about her stance in articles published in a socialist paper, L'Avanti. By 1935, the fascist regime was controlling Italian daily life. Under these circumstances, Genoni had abandoned her dream of building an \\"Italian fashion\\" and a more democratic and egalitarian society that defended the rights of the lower classes. Anthroposophy Rosa Genoni was a keen anthroposophist interested in the spiritual teachings of the Austrian philosopher Rudolf Steiner. She introduced the youngest of her siblings, the Italian artist Ernesto Genoni, to the Anthroposophy Society meetings in Milan.Paull, John (2014) \\"Ernesto Genoni: Australia‚Äôs pioneer of biodynamic agriculture\\", Journal of Organics, 1(1):57-81. Ernesto subsequently migrated to Australia where he introduced his brothers, farming in Western Australia, to Anthroposophy, he cofounded the first Anthroposophy group and established the first biodynamic farm in Melbourne, Australia. So Rosa had a seminal role in disseminating the teachings of Rudolf Steiner to Australia.Paull, John (2014) \\"Ernesto Genoni: Australia‚Äôs pioneer of biodynamic agriculture\\", Journal of Organics, 1(1):57-81.

Life Dawson was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, but would eventually spend much of his career at the University of Southern Mississippi's Gulf Coast Research Laboratory in Ocean Springs, Mississippi, where he worked early as an administrator, then researcher, and museum curator. Over his long career Dawson wrote 150 publications, on the majority of which he was the sole author. He recognized 52 Syngnathid genera and provided systematic reviews of most of them. His work culminated with his extensive review of all Indo- Pacific pipefishes. He died as a result of a branchioloalveolar carcinoma in combination with other long-term lung ailments. Dawson served in the Canadian Army during World War II, losing an eye in the Battle of Dieppe, France. He also served in the United States Army and became a naturalized citizen in 1946.

Anti-Tibetan sentiment has been present in various regions of Bhutan, China, India, and Nepal at various points in time. Anti-Tibetan sentiment in South Asia is due to the presence of Tibetan immigrants in those countries. Anti-Tibetan sentiment in China is due to the fact that Tibet has been annexed by China on several occasions over the centuries (Tibet is currently under the administration of the People's Republic of China) which has created tension between the Tibetans and the Han Chinese. Bhutan The government of Bhutan agreed to take in 4000 Tibetan refugees. Ordinary Bhutanese became increasingly resentful of the Tibetan refugees because of their refusal to assimilate into Bhutanese culture.  China  Ever since its inception, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), the sole legal ruling political party of the PRC (including Tibet), has been distributing historical documents which portray Tibetan culture as barbaric in order to justify Chinese control of the territory of Tibet. As such, many members of Chinese society have a negative view of Tibet which can be interpreted as racism. The traditional view is that Tibet was historically a feudal society which practiced serfdom/slavery and that this only changed due to Chinese influence in the region. The CCP also promotes the view that some ancient Chinese historical figures strongly influenced many aspects of Tibet's fundamental culture as part of its campaign to legitimize Chinese control of Tibet. One such figure is Princess Wencheng, an ancient Chinese princess who purportedly married king Songsten Gampo of Tibet and introduced Buddhism as well as many other forms of \\"civilization\\" to Tibet. Evidence for the legitimacy of the claims made about Princess Wencheng is limited. Some extremists in China believe that the Han Chinese, Tibetans, and Mongols belong to the same ethnic group and/or race and that their differences are only regional rather than genetic. India In Arunachal Pradesh, a region bordering Tibet and is claimed by China as being South Tibet, there was a xenophobic campaign and a motion by the state government to expel around 12,000 Tibetans that received much support from the local population, but the Indian government was \\"angered\\" by the state government's initiatives. The Monpas, a people who are ethnically and culturally related to Tibetans, are opposed to Tibetan refugees in their state. Nepal Tibetans and Himalayan ethnic groups of Tibetan origin such as the Sherpa and Tamang are at times derogatorily called \\"bhotey\\", which is the Nepali word for someone from Tibet, but is used as a slur.

The company stopped offering regular bus service on June 1, 2017. It formerly connected the central, eastern, and southeastern areas of the state (Carbon, Grand, Emery, Juab, San Juan, Sanpete, and Sevier counties) with the Wasatch Front, specifically Provo and Salt Lake City. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of Wasatch Transportation and is an official Greyhound Connect company. Description Elevated Transit provided daily routes in both directions throughout its service area, plus some additional roundtrip runs Thursday through Monday. Its headquarters were at 42 North 100 East, Suite 1 in American Fork. Its parent company, Wasatch Transportation, had (as of 2016) been in operating in Utah for nearly 30 years, but specialized in special needs and school transportation. Elevated Transit's slogan was Travel the HIGH way. Seating was is first-come, first-served and smoking was prohibited on Elevated Transit vehicles. The bus line was created to provide bus service to the central, eastern, and southeastern areas of the state that previously lacked public transportation. It began operating with substantial financial support from the Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) and Greyhound Lines. Between UDOT and Greyhound, Elevated Transit received $864,000 per year for its first five years of operation. According to CEO Steven Fuller, it was hoped that the initial funding will allow the company to grow \\"to the point that public funds are no longer needed and it will self-sustain.\\" The service was intended to connect with existing Greyhound service, as well as other transit systems along the routes. In 2017, Utah‚Äôs Department of Transport withdrew funding therefore effectively ending those services relying on public subsidy. =Former Fleet= Elevated Transit Thomas HDX bus interior Elevated Transit's fleet included two models of 35-passenger buses (Glaval Synergy and Thomas HDX) with three of each model. The Glaval Synergy had compartments with the capacity to hold a limited number of bicycles. However, in anticipation of multiple passengers desiring to transport bicycles to the Moab area, the buses had the ability to tow a bicycle trailer.The Thomas HDX model were most often used for school buses, but occasionally modified (as for Elevated Transit) for commercial transport. Both buses had Wi-Fi, available satellite TV, lavatories, wheelchair access, additional space for baggage and bicycles History Decades ago, Greyhound provide more extensive bus service in rural Utah than it does today, but most of these routes were abandoned years ago For quite a few years replacement service has been sought and a similar proposed bus service was close to realization in 2012. This service was to be provided by the Salt Lake Express, however, the proposal fell through when Salt Lake Express's buses couldn't meet the required Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) standards. The contract was opened again for bidding, with the proposal from Wasatch Transportation being accepted. About a year later the new subsidiary company (Elevated Transit) received its transportation license on 3 October 2013. After several false starts, Elevated Transit began operating on 13 August 2014. Original plans were to commence operations in late April, then mid June, but buses did not begin running until August. The later-than-planned start was due, in part, to delays in the delivery of it vehicles. For the first three days of operation 13‚Äì15 August), passengers were allowed to ride fare free to encourage familiarity with the service as well as identify any possible problems with the service (\\"beta testing\\"). In 2015, Elevated Transit was awarded the Best Brand Design by the American Institute of Graphic Arts. The company's logo and brand design were developed with help from Cocoa Productions (Midway, Utah). Routes As of June 1st 2017, Elevated Transit has discontinued its former routed between Salt Lake City and Blanding as well as Richfield and no scheduled service remains.

These additional roundtrips made most of the same stops along the route and run each Thursday thru Monday. They started in the mid afternoon in Richfield with a 30-minute layover in Salt Lake City in the early evening before returning to Richfield. There was also a 10-minute layover in Gunnison on the northbound leg only and no layover in Nephi for either direction. These roundtrips did not stop in either direction at the following: Snow College in Ephraim, Fairview, and Mount Pleasant. One of the intended purposes for this additional trip was to facilitate access from the Wasatch Front to the Central Utah Correctional Facility (CUCF).

Wildlife habitat The island contains a mixture of shrubs, open areas and mature forests. It is a known wintering area for bald eagles. A nearby area of the Saint Lawrence River, known as the Galop Island Pools, remains free of ice during the winter due to strong river currents and turbulence. The approximately of open water is utilized by eagles and other migratory birds as a winter food source. The availability of open water during the winter is limited within the region; only three other areas within the Saint Lawrence River remain similarly free of ice. Approximately of shallow bays along the river channel south of the island include spawning habitat for muskellunge, causing the area to be a regionally important sport fishing destination.

Among these were the 1950 incident of the Norwegian ship Crown Prince Olav when she suddenly caught fire outside the coast of Halland, located along the west coast of Sweden. Despite no sight due to heavy fog, with only help of the radar system, Captain John Nordlander managed to fetch and tow the deteriorating vessel and its 120 passengers safely back to the nearest port.Aftonbladet, 20 December 1959, p. 6 Furthermore, in 1955 the British 7 000 tons heavy Argobeam also caught fire in the sea outside Ireland, rescued by Captain Nordlander.

The story tells the tale of a friendship that develops between two young girls of separate ethnicities; Christy the narrator is Caucasian while her friend Kyra is of African descent. Conflict is created within the story when Kyra's family, the Kirks, move into Christy's neighborhood and racism threatens to tear their relationship and neighborhood apart. However, the story comes to a close when both Christy and Kyra's families develop a mutual trust and reliance on one another. Written with a socially conscious agenda, Black Like Kyra, White Like Me endeavors to tackle racism and racist prejudices within a text suitable for young children. However, Vigna's writing has received criticism for using perceived stereotypes of black culture.  Plot  When Christy's friend Kyra moves out of a violent neighborhood and relocates into Christy's own residential area, Christy's family and friends react negatively and are hesitant to meet Kyra's family, the Kirks. As the story progresses, tension further escalates when the Kirks are socially rejected at a neighborhood block party and vandalism occurs. However, tension is relieved when Cristy's father apologizes to the Kirks for the racism they have endured and Christy's mother offers to call the police after the Kirk's van has been vandalized. As the story comes to a close the relationship between Kyra's and Christy's families is improving, for Christy's mother drives both her daughter and Kyra to gymnastics and allows her daughter to see as much of Kyra as she wants. Moreover, Matt, Julie and their father move out of Christy and Kyra's neighborhood and thus reduce the racial tension.  Reception  Black Like Kyra, White Like Me has received both positive and negative reviews ever since publication in 1992. Often included on lists of controversial children's literature, Black Like Kyra, White Like Me has received backlash for its perceived \\"racial insensitivity and insincerity \\". Moreover, in 2000 Vigna was accused of \\" reinforcing negative stereotypes about blacks and positive stereotypes about whites \\" by a customer of the Toronto Public Library, however Black Like Kyra, White Like Me still remained on the library's shelves for public access. Nevertheless, Black Like Kyra, White Like Me, has received praise for being both a teaching tool about racism and a reflection of racial conflict and divide. In addition, in Pittman 's Whited Out: Unique Perspectives on Black Identity and Honors Achievement, Vigna's Black like Kyra, White Like Me is stated to be fundamental in producing and teaching empathy in early childhood development. Furthermore, Vigna's illustrations have been praised for their attractiveness and ability to lighten up the story's heavy mood.

He was married to Teodegonza, a relative of Rudesind, founder of the monastery of Celanova. He was probably a brother of Piniolo Gundem√°riz and thus an uncle of Count Gundemaro Pini√≥liz. Little is known of Suero's early life. His earliest appearance in the historical record is as a witness in a document of 968 pertaining to the monastery of Sobrado. He attended the court of King Ramiro III in 974, witnessing two royal diplomas. In 985‚Äì86, he witnessed five diplomas of King Vermudo II, all pertaining to churches in Le√≥n proper and Galicia. His interests clearly lay in eastern Galicia; and not a single document places him in Portugal. In 986, Suero led a revolt against the King Vermudo II. He was joined by Count Gonzalo Men√©ndez and Osorio D√≠az. This rebellion disturbed a peace which, as King Vermudo had proudly declared, reigned throughout the length and breadth of the kingdom as of 1 January 986. It also coincided with an invasion from the south by the Caliphate under al- Mansur. During the revolt, Suero managed to build a villa without royal permission at Veyga on the river Mi√±o. In 994, after Suero's death, King Vermudo gave the villa to the monastery of Celanova. In documenting this gift, the king recorded how Suero, \\"puffed up with pride and led by a malicious spirit, rebelled against me and disturbed my land and my rights equally and my castles too, as did his other accomplices, whom he led against me.\\" A document dated 1032, from the reign of King Vermudo III, describes the revolt led by Suero during the time of his grandfather (Vermudo II). It says that Suero held the fortress of Lugo and that the rebels built many illegal castles, all of which save for Lapio (now Labio) were torn down after the rebellion was defeated. Suero made his peace with the king in 988, and was re-admitted to the royal court. Despite the fact that his rebellion was remembered for decades on account of its gravity, he was shown tremendous leniency, although his lands were at least partially confiscated. On 23 December 988, in a royal diploma for Celanova, he appears atop the list of lay witnesses. On 1 March 991, in his last appearance in the records, he confirms Vermudo II's grant of the conmiso (district) of Mera to the cathedral of Lugo. He died later that year. On 10 August 992, some estates that had been confiscated after the rebellion were conferred on his widow. His widow was alive as late as 18 December 1016, when she donated half the villa of Meil√°n to the cathedral of Lugo. One of Suero's nephews, Rodrigo Rom√°niz, led a rebellion from the region of Monterroso during the reign of King Vermudo III, and seized the castle of Lapio.

Etymology The generic name \\"Munduruku\\" comes from the Munduruku people, who inhabited the region where the types were collected. The specific name \\"bicoloratum\\" comes from Latin, meaning \\"two-coloured\\" referring to the abdominal colours. Classification Munduruku bicoloratum could be placed in the genus Plesiopelma, but its characteristics show that this would broaden the diagnostic features of this genus too much, therefore causing it to become a nonmonophyletic group.Miglio, L.

Cram, Edith Bryce Cram and Mrs. J.S. Cram (May 6, 1880 - February 28, 1960), was an American peace activist and heiress. She founded Peace House, which produced anti-war and peace movement lectures, newspaper advertisements, and other propaganda to promote peace. She was a benefactor for the War Resisters League. During World War I, she expressed her pacifist views in newspapers in Chicago, New York, and Washington. She wrote an open letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt during World War II, in which she asked him to mediate. She also promoted women's rights, specifically advocating for birth control. She was on the Advisory Council at Cooper Union for women's educational fields. Early life Edith Claire Bryce was born on May 6, 1880 in New York, New York. Her parents were General Lloyd Stephens Bryce, the United States Ambassador to the Netherlands, and Edith (n√©e Cooper) Bryce, the only child of New York City Mayor Edward Cooper, the son of prominent industrialist Peter Cooper. The family house, Bryce House, was located in Roslyn on Long Island, New York. Her mother, a millionairess, died on April 29, 1916 leaving a large estate to her family in her will. The main beneficiaries were her brother and her father. Her father died on April 2, 1917, and according to the will, the bulk of the estate, calculated at $6,667,136 in 1918, went to her children and grandchildren, with Peter the main beneficiary. Edith inherited $957,645 (). Her sister, Cornelia Elizabeth Bryce (1881‚Äì1960), was married to conservationist Gifford Pinchot (1865‚Äì1946), the first Chief of the United States Forest Service under Theodore Roosevelt, in 1914. Her brother, Peter Cooper Bryce (1889‚Äì1964), married Angelica Schuyler Brown (1890‚Äì1980), of the Brown banking family, in 1917. Pacifist A World War I-era female peace protester During World War I, she became a pacifist and used the print media to promote her views. She created advertisements and content for religious pages of Chicago, New York, and Washington newspapers. After the French and Belgian invasion of the Ruhr, Albert Einstein expressed his displeasure of the League of Nations' response. She sent a telegram to him in Berlin on April 12, 1923, thanking for his \\"stand for peace\\" and offered him a trip to the United States, with expenses paid by two peace societies. A leader in the pacifist movement, she founded Peace House, dedicated to the advancement of peace.Life and Labor Bulletin, Vol 5, No. 6, Serial no. 52 (May 1927), p. front Also engaged in anti-war activities, it was established in 1923 in New York City. The organization conducted plays, lectures, and exhibits. It counseled conscientious objectors. The War Resisters League, of which she was a benefactor, helped her with anti-war advertisements and peace propaganda. Funded totally by her, the Peace House reached millions as the result of its propaganda campaigns. A common message on posters was \\"Too young to vote but not too young to be killed.\\" During World War II, she advocated for complete neutrality in the armed conflict. She held a meeting at Carnegie Hall in 1939 where senators and representatives of Congress, who wanted to lift the arms embargo, addressed calls for peace. During World War II, she wrote an open letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt asking him to be a mediator for a peaceful resolution. It was published as an advertisement. Devoted to the pursuit of world-wide peace, she was called a \\"one-woman campaign for peace\\". In 1946, the Peace House property was sold.

It has been an important town since the colonial Gold Coast days in Ghana's History, then referred to as Pruano (on the riverbank of Pru-river) but spelled as Pulliano in colonial Gold Coast maps. The Japekromhene has direct blood relations with the Gyamanhene, the overlord of the 'Bono' Kingdom, who currently resides in la C√¥te d'Ivoire. The township was built on a foundation of solid stone and as a result of resistance to any form of suppression or oppression. During the pre-colonial and early post-colonial years, Japekrom became one of the central places of convergence of the people of the Gyaman 'Bono' Kingdom. The current Gyamanhene, His Royal Majesty Nana Kwasi Adinkra Agyemang IV, had some of his early education at Japekrom. Traditional leaders of the Japekrom strongly uphold the principles of truth, fairness, hard work, a welcoming heart, inclusion and preservation of culture. The people of Japekrom are very welcoming of people from other tribes and cultures. The original settlers on the riverbank of Pru (Pruano) prospected for gold and other minerals along the banks of river Pru. Two major rivers in the Japekrom city are Pru and Papasu. The chiefs and people of Mpuasu-Japekrom Traditional Area are known for the celebration of the annual Munufie Festival (annual yam harvest festival). This is usually celebrated at Japekrom in the last quarter of every year and brings together chiefs, queen mothers, dignitaries and several people (both in Ghana and abroad) to participate and witness the events. It is celebrated to mark the close of the farming season and to set the tone for the commencement of the yet another farming season. It is the major festival of the Mpuasu-Japekrom Traditional Area.

Commercialized GM sugar beets make use of a glyphosate-resistance modification developed by Monsanto and KWS Saat. These glyphosate-resistant beets, also called 'Roundup Ready' sugar beets, were developed by 2000, but not commercialized until 2007. All sugar beets has a Maximum Residue Limit of glyphosate of 15 mg/Kg in the final harvest for international trade. As of 2016, GMO sugar beets are grown in the United States and Canada. In the United States, they play an important role in domestic sugar production. Studies have concluded the sugar from glyphosate-resistant sugar beets is molecularly identical to and so has the same nutritional value as sugar from conventional (non-GMO) sugar beets. The United States imports 30% of its sugar, while the remaining 70% is extracted from domestically grown sugar beets and sugarcane. More than 1 million acres of sugar beets are cultivated annually in the United States, with a market value at harvest exceeding $1 billion. GM sugar beets are grown by more than 95 percent of the nation's sugar beet farmers. Of the domestically grown sugar crops, over half of the extracted sugar is derived from sugar beets, and the rest from sugarcane. The glyphosate sprayed on GM beet fields significantly reduces weed growth, and thus has decreased the demand for migrant workers, who have historically been employed as seasonal workers to pull weeds on conventional sugar beet farms in the United States. According to Monsanto, more than 37,000 acres of Roundup Ready sugar beet have been planted in Canada.http://www.monsanto.com/newsviews/pages/genuity- roundup-ready-sugarbeets.aspx History Glyphosate-resistant sugar beets were initially developed by Monsanto and KWS Saat prior to 2000. Food companies raised concerns about consumer response to GM-sourced sugar, and as a result seed companies chose not to pursue commercialization at that time. In 2005, the US Department of Agriculture-Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA-APHIS) deregulated glyphosate-resistant sugar beets after it conducted an environmental assessment and determined glyphosate-resistant sugar beets were highly unlikely to become a plant pest. Sugar from glyphosate-resistant sugar beets has been approved for human and animal consumption in multiple countries, but commercial production of biotech beets has been approved only in the United States and Canada. In 2007, GM sugar beets were commercialized and GM seed sold in the United States. In 2008/2009, 60% of the sugar beets grown in the US were GM. By 2009/2010, the percentage of GM beets had grown to 95%. In August 2010, commercial planting of GM sugar beets was suspended following a lawsuit and US district court revocation of their approval. In February 2011, the USDA-APHIS allowed GM sugar beet planting under a set of monitoring and handling requirements. In July 2012, after completing an environmental impact assessment and a plant pest risk assessment, the USDA deregulated Monsanto's Roundup Ready sugar beets. In 2015, The Hershey Company, historically a major buyer of beet sugar, switched to cane sugar for many products due to consumer concern about GMOs. Controversies =Litigation over commercial regulation= On January 23, 2008, the Center for Food Safety, the Sierra Club, and the Organic Seed Alliance and High Mowing Seeds filed a lawsuit against USDA-APHIS regarding their decision to deregulate glyphosate-resistant sugar beets in 2005. The organizations expressed concerns regarding glyphosate-resistant sugar beets' ability to potentially cross-pollinate with conventional sugar beets. On September 21, 2009, U.S. District Judge Jeffrey S. White, US District Court for the Northern District of California, ruled that USDA-APHIS had violated federal law in deregulating glyphosate-resistant sugar beets without adequately evaluating the environmental and socioeconomic impacts of allowing commercial production. The USDA estimated a sugar shortage would cost consumers $2.972 billion in 2011. On August 13, 2010, Judge White revoked the deregulation of glyphosate-resistant sugar beets and declared it unlawful for growers to plant glyphosate-resistant sugar beets in the spring of 2011. As a result of this ruling, growers were permitted to harvest and process their crop at the end of the 2010 growing season, yet a ban on new plantings was enacted. After the ruling, glyphosate-resistant sugar beets could not be planted until USDA-APHIS filed an environmental impact statement (EIS), the purpose of which is to determine if environmental issues have negative effects on humans and the environment, and it may take two to three years to complete the study. After the EIS is completed, USDA-APHIS may petition to deregulate glyphosate-resistant sugar beets. After Judge White's ruling, USDA-APHIS prepared an environmental assessment seeking partial deregulation of glyphosate-resistant sugar beets. The assessment was filed based on a request received from Monsanto and KWS SSAT AG, a German seed company. Both companies, as well as the sugar beet industry employees and growers, believed a sugar shortage would occur if glyphosate-resistant sugar beets could not be planted. As a response to this concern, USDA-APHIS developed three options in the environmental assessment to address the concerns of environmentalists, as well as those raised by the industry. The first option was to not plant glyphosate- resistant sugar beets until the EIS was completed. The second option was to allow growers to plant glyphosate-resistant sugar beets if they obtained a USDA-APHIS permit and followed specific mandates. Under the third and final option, glyphosate-resistant sugar beets would be partially deregulated, but monitored by Monsanto and KWS SSAT AG. USDA-APHIS preferred the second option. They placed the environmental assessment in the Federal Register on November 4, 2010, and received public comment for 30 days. In November 2010, in response to a suit by the original parties, Judge White ordered the destruction of plantings of genetically modified sugar beets developed by Monsanto after ruling previously that the USDA had illegally approved the biotech crop. In February 2011, a federal appeals court for the Northern district of California in San Francisco overturned the ruling, concluding, \\"The Plaintiffs have failed to show a likelihood of irreparable injury. Biology, geography, field experience, and permit restrictions make irreparable injury unlikely.\\" On February 4, 2011, the USDA-APHIS announced glyphosate- resistant sugar beets had been partially deregulated and growers would be allowed to plant seed from spring 2011 until an EIS is completed. USDA-APHIS developed requirements that growers must follow if handling glyphosate- resistant sugar beets and will monitor growers throughout the partial deregulation period. The requirements are classified into categories which include planting glyphosate-resistant sugar beets for seed production, planting for sugar production, and transporting sugar beets across state lines. Failure to follow the requirements set by USDA-APHIS may result in civil or criminal charges and destruction of the crop. In July 2012, after completing an environmental impact assessment and a plant pest risk assessment the USDA deregulated Monsanto's Roundup Ready sugar beets. =Potential for cross-pollination= In 2011, some growers of chard seed in Oregon have raised concerns about the possibility of cross-pollination with GM sugar beets via windblown pollen. =Glyphosate-resistant weeds= As with other glyphosate- resistant crops, GM sugar beet farming may contribute to the growing number of glyphosate-resistant weeds. GM Corn, GM soybeans and GM cotton are grown on many times the acreage devoted to sugar beets and these crops are most affected.

It is about southeast of Eugene on Fall Creek, immediately upstream from Unity Bridge, a covered bridge. The communities of Unity, at the bridge site, and Lowell, south of Unity, are near the lake. The unincorporated community of Jasper is further downstream, below the confluence of Fall Creek with the Middle Fork Willamette River. Fall Creek Dam, high, impounds up to of water in the reservoir. The embankment dam is of the rockfill type with a gated concrete spillway and outlet controls for regulating lake levels. The lake includes two arms, one along the Fall Creek main stem and one along Winberry Creek, a tributary entering from the south. History Fall Creek Lake is one of 13 multi-purpose water projects managed by the United States Corps of Engineers in the Willamette Valley. The reservoir, completed in 1966, functions mainly to control downstream flooding on the Willamette River but is also heavily used for recreation when the lake is full. The Corps keeps water levels high‚Äîup to ‚Äî in the lake during the spring and early summer but draws them down by up to below maximum in late summer through winter. This creates storage capacity for potential flood water in the rainy season. Mud flats that appear during the drawdown make recreational uses less feasible. Recreation In addition to a variety of campsites, amenities at the lake include picnic tables, boat ramps, swimming areas, toilets, and a fishing pier. Activities on the lake also include waterskiing and jet-skiing. Winberry Creek Road runs along the Winberry arm and meets Lowell‚ÄìUnity Road (Lowell‚ÄìJasper Road) near the covered bridge. Big Fall Creek Road and Peninsula Road branch off Winberry Creek Road and, along opposite shores, follow the Fall Creek arm upstream to the end of the lake. Each road leads to one or more of the many day-use sites and campgrounds around the lake. Forest Road 18 begins at the head of the lake and follows Fall Creek upstream for many miles to other campgrounds and hiking trails in the Cascade Range.

It typically is used to stabilize to some degree power grids, to help them stay on the grid frequency, and to serve as a short-term compensation storage. Unlike common storage power plants, such as the pumped storage power plants with capacities up to 1000 MW, the benefits from flywheel storage power plants can be obtained with a facility in the range of a few kW to several tens of MW. Schwungrad- Speicherkraftwerk in Hazle Township, Pennsylvania (USA), Betreiberseite beaconpower They are comparable in this application with battery storage power plants. Possible areas of application are places where electrical energy can be obtained and stored, and must be supplied again to compensate for example, fluctuations in the seconds range in wind or solar power. These storage facilities consist of individual flywheels in a modular design. Energy up to 150 kW can be absorbed or released per flywheel. Through combinations of several such flywheel accumulators, which are individually housed in buried underground vacuum tanks, a total power of up to several tens of MW can be achieved. The electrical connections power low voltage motors via a DC intermediate circuit and the power converter systems are comparable to those found in plants used in the high-voltage direct current transmissions application.

Bendolph is associated with The Quilts of Gee's Bend and her work has been considered more conceptual because of her use of vibrant color.  Art  Bendolph's work begins with sketches, and ultimately moves to fabric through innovation and improvisation. Her quilts typically start out as housetop, a pattern based on concentric squares resembling a birds-eye-view of a roof of a house, but during her quilting process, take on new shapes. Bendolph's creations have exhibited at the Addison Ripley Gallery in Washington D.C. and in Seattle at the Greg Kucera Gallery. Her work in the exhibition \\"Gee's Bend: The Architecture of the Quilt\\" was on display at the Walters Art Museum in 2007. Bendolph also produces prints from etchings. Her print \\"American Housetop (for the Arnetts)\\" (2005), which is dedicated to the family who linked Gee's Bend with the museum world, was on display at Lehman College Art Gallery in 2015 along with 14 quilts and photographs. Her 2013 work, entitled As I Leave I Shall Return, is also on display at the Baltimore Museum of Art.  Personal life  Louisiana Bendolph was born to Rita Mae Pettway and Samuel Small. Bendolph grew up on a farm, along with her two siblings, David and Hazel. In her childhood, Bendolph was fascinated by quiltmaking. The artist later would describe fond memories of watching her mother and other relatives sew, while the children would play under the quilts. At nineteen, the artist gave birth to a daughter (Sonda). A year later, Louisiana married Sonda's father. They had their second daughter, Melinda, in 1982. And in 1990 she gave birth to Merrianna. She had her last daughter, Alleeanna, in 1997. In 1991, Louisiana Bendolph got a job at the Lee company. She worked at Lee, putting zippers and pockets into jeans, until the company moved that part of their operation abroad in 1997. Quilt making remained an important part of Louisiana's world throughout her adult life. In the year following the birth of her first child, the artist made about eight quilts (which were mostly pattern quilts). When Louisiana moved from Gee's Bend to Mobile, she brought her quilt with her. The artist continued to make quilts in their new home. In 2002, Louisiana attended a quilt exhibit in Houston with her mother. When they arrived in Houston, she saw a quilt book there with one of her pieces in it. The realization shocked her, and is something that the artist still has not gotten over when she sees her work on display.

Ultimately, however, she turned to the guitar and began composing her own material at the age of twelve. Between the ages of five and fifteen she traveled Europe, as a professional high diver. Qualifying for a wide range of diving competitions, she won Euromeeting in Strasbourg (2002), but was forced to abandon the sport due to a knee injury. Music gradually became an alternative to sport and Villy started playing in Tbilisi clubs at the age of sixteen. Following the Russo-Georgian War of 2008, Villy moved to Kiev, as she has both Georgian and Ukrainian ancestors. Here she finished studying tourism at university and formed her first group, Backstage. The band was a short-lived project and Villy began a solo career. She began playing in regional festivals, now as an independent singer-songwriter. Open-air performances included Koktebel Jazz Festival.

In Ukraine, \\"Dress\\" was declared Album of the Year by influential Ukrainian webzine Comma.Com.UA. In 2015 Villy presented her side-project \\"Philosophie\\" in Europe and the United States, while opening for Mercury Prize and Brit Awards nominee Anna Calvi in Budapest. Also in 2015, she played at the SXSW festival in Texas. She has toured America on five occasions, headlining Fall Arts Festival in Florida, including a show (School Night) at New York's Brooklyn Bowl with Lana Del Rey's ex drummer Ryan Voughn, hosted by Chris Douridas and with onstage support in Los Angeles from Tom Waits' guitarist Omar Torrez.

It is separated from what is now the modern St Mellons suburb by the B4487 main road to Newport. Lying to the east of the Rhymney River it forms part of the historic county of Monmouthshire. The population of the community in 2011 was 2,367 and one of the smallest in Cardiff.https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/localarea?compare=W04000888 History and description St Mellons Parish Church Old St Mellons is made up largely of 19th-century housing, a village hall and several pubs and shops. The village had a school, converted in 1854 from the 17th-century Poor House, but this was demolished after it closed in the 1980s. There are 15 nationally listed buildings and structures in the village, including St John's College, St Julian's Manor and two public houses. As of 2007 there were four pubs, indicating the importance of St Mellons as a resting point on the route to London. Because St Mellons lay in Monmouthshire, it also avoided having to abide by the Welsh Sunday Closing Act. St Mellons Church is the Church in Wales parish church and dates from the 14th-century, noted for its unusual plan and double arch to the chancel. It is Grade I listed, while the lychgate to the churchyard is listed Grade II. Bethany Presbyterian Church is also located in the village. Old St Mellons was designated a Conservation Area in 1976, giving Cardiff Council statutory powers to prevent certain changes, while preserving and improving the historical character of the village. Government Location of the Old St Mellons community within Cardiff The Old St Mellons community was created from the eastern part (largely the Old St Mellons ward) of the previously existing St Mellons community in 1996. The remaining part of the St Mellons community became Pontprennau. The village is part of the Cardiff Council ward of Pontprennau & Old St. Mellons, which in turn is part of the UK Parliament/Senedd Cymru constituencies of Cardiff North. The new St Mellons to the south is part of a different ward and parliamentary constituencies. Known variously as St MelansKelly's Directory of Monmouthshire 1901 (reproduced on Rootsweb). Retrieved 13 February 2016. or Llaneurwg, St Mellons was previously governed by Monmouthshire County Council between 1889 and 1974, and St Mellons Rural District Council between 1894 and 1935, which included other villages and settlements as far as the edge of Newport. Between 1935 and 1974 the Rural District was merged with that of Magor. = Community Council = Old St Mellons elects a community council, comprising seven councillors, with two further seats available for co-option (April 2020). The council is funded by a local precept on council tax bills in Old St Mellons and provides a range of community support. Elections are held every five years. The last election was held at the same time as the 2017 Cardiff Council election and the next election is due to be held in May 2022. St Edeyrn's Village Plans were unveiled in 2014 to build yet more modern housing on open fields within the Old St Mellons community. As part of Cardiff's Local Development Plan a new village of over 1,000 homes is being built by Persimmon Homes, and will include new shops, play areas and allotments.

After a short time at school, he worked as a carpenter in Frankfurt.Biographical notes @ Hessische Biografie. Later, he went to Paris to learn the art of wallpaper painting, which was very popular among the aristocracy at that time. When his studies were completed, he set up a studio in Frankfurt. In 1749, he and his brother Johann Heinrich took a study trip to Italy. For many years thereafter, he created oil paintings based on the sketches and watercolors made during that trip. In 1764, he moved to Hamburg, opened a private art school and was married in 1766. Five years later, he wrote a textbook on painting (Unterricht zu gr√ºndlicher Erlernung der Malerey) which, in 1780, earned him a place as an instructor at the Gelehrtenschule des Johanneums. He also painted several murals at Wandsbek Castle, which was demolished in 1861. A street is named after him in Hamburg's Barmbek-Nord district.

Individuals can also use the health insurance information contained in the form/forms to help them fill out their tax returns. The individual forms are Form 1095-A \\"A Health Insurance Marketplace Statement\\", Form 1095-B \\"Health Coverage\\", and Form 1095-C \\"Employer-Provided Health Insurance Offer and Coverage\\". Individuals may receive one or multiple versions of Form 1095.  Background  The Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, includes both the individual mandate and the employer mandate. The individual mandate requires that most Americans have qualifying healthcare coverage or potentially face a fine. The employer mandate requires employers with 50 or more full-time equivalent employees to offer healthcare coverage to their full-time employees or potentially face a fine. Form 1095 determines whether the employee or the employer have to pay a fine for failing to meet the individual mandate and the employer mandate, respectively. Form 1095 is filed by whoever provided health insurance coverage to an individual, which means that individuals don't have to fill out Form 1095 themselves. Form 1095 contains individual health insurance information. Individuals can use the information on Form 1095 to fill the \\"Health care: individual responsibility\\" line on Forms 1040, 1040A or 1040EZ. For example, if an individual fails to meet adequate medical coverage, and does not qualify for any exemptions, they will enter the shared responsibility payment amount on that line in the 1040 Forms. Form 1095 is also used to fill out Form 8962 (premium tax credit) and Form 8965 (health coverage exemptions).  Receiving Form 1095  Form 1095 is sent to the individual by whoever provides them with health insurance, be it the health insurance marketplace for Form 1095-A, a small self-funded group or small business for Form 1095-B, or by their (50+ full-time employees) employer for Form 1095-C. Form 1095 is only sent to the individual and for his or her own reference; the individual does not need to send Form 1095 to the IRS, their employer, or anyone else for that matter. Form 1095 is typically to be received by the individual by the beginning of February; however, in 2015 many individuals received Form 1095 later than expected, due to delays. 2016 is likely to have less delays.  Individual shared responsibility provision  Starting January 2014, an individual and his or her family must have health insurance coverage throughout the year. Individuals may be exempt from health insurance coverage if: * The minimum amount they must pay for annual premiums is more than eight percent of their household income, * They have a gap in coverage for less than three consecutive months, * They belong to a group that is explicitly exempt from participating in the Affordable Care Act, * They qualify for an exemption for one of several other reasons, such as a hardship that prevents them from obtaining coverage. If an individual and his or her family don't have health insurance and don't qualify for any exemptions, they will be required to make the individual shared responsibility payment.  Form 1095-A Health Insurance Marketplace Statement  Individuals with a health insurance marketplace plan receive Form 1095-A. Note that this form comes from the marketplace, not the IRS. The form includes the individual's and their dependents' name, the amount of coverage they have, any tax credits they are entitled to and whether they used them to pay for health insurance, and the amount they paid in total for coverage. An individual can use the Form 1095-A they receive to complete their income tax filing, adjust tax credit payments, and claim any premium tax credits that may be due or repaid.  Form 1095-B Health Coverage  Employers with fewer than 50 full-time employees that offer health coverage, as well as health care insurance providers, send the 1095-B form to members of their health insurance plans. 1095-B includes the type of coverage the individual has, dependents covered, and the period of the coverage. Form 1095-B is used to verify on tax returns that an individual and his or her dependents have at least minimum essential coverage (MEC).  Form 1095-C Employer-Provided Health Insurance Offer and Coverage  Form 1095-C is used by larger companies with 50 or more full-time or full-time equivalent employees. This form is used by the employee to report the healthcare coverage offered to them by his or her employer. The IRS uses the information on it to determine whether the employee or the employer have to pay a fine for failing to meet the healthcare coverage requirements under the ACA.

It has smooth bark, sometimes with rough, ribbony bark near the base, lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, creamy white, pale yellow, sometimes pink or red flowers, and cylindrical, barrel-shaped or bell-shaped fruit. Description Eucalyptus incrassata is a single stemmed or multi-stemmed mallee that typically grows to a height of but can reach as high as . It will usually grow to a width of and it forms a lignotuber. The bark is smooth pink to grey or brownish, sometimes with rough grey to brown ribbons near the base. Young plants and coppice regrowth have dull bluish green, elliptic to egg- shaped leaves that are long and wide. The adult leaves are arranged alternately, the same glossy green on both sides, lance-shaped, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of seven on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are oblong to pear-shaped, long and wide with a conical operculum. It blooms between August and April producing cream-white-yellow blossoms. The fruit is a woody, cylindrical to barrel-shaped or bell-shaped capsule long and wide with the valves below rim level. Taxonomy Eucalyptus incrassata was first formally described by the botanist Jacques Labillardi√®re in 1806 in his two-volume treatise, Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen. The name incrassata is from the Latin 'incrassatus' meaning thickened referring to the plants thick leaves. Distribution Lerp mallee is often found along sandplains and hillsides and is distributed from the Mid West, through the Wheatbelt and along the south coast in the Great Southern and Goldfields-Esperance regions of Western Australia where it grows in sandy soils. It is also found in the south of South Australia extending into Victoria and New South Wales. This is one of the most widespread mallee species in Australia. It is associated with the western mallee subgroup which is characterised by several eucalypts including E. oleosa, E. moderata, E. eremophila, E. foecunda, E. redunca and E. uncinata. The understorey is predominantly shrubby with species of Melaleuca and Acacia along with the occasional Triodia. Ecology This eucalypt attracts nectar-eating birds and insects that use it for food and habitat. Use in horticulture E. incrassata is used as a shade tree, mass planting will offer good screening, good for erosion control or as a windbreak. It is suitable mediterranean and bush style gardens and responds well to coppicing. It is tolerant of both drought and light frost. Able to grow in ordinary soil or enriched soil that is either acidic to alkaline and prefers a position in the full sun. Seeds will germinate in 2 to 6 weeks and it can be grown from cuttings. The tree is susceptible to powdery mildew in the wetter months of winter, it can also be affected by myrtle rust and by dieback. It is also suitable to produce large amounts of biomass, able to make per hectare per year. In wheatbelt regions it is also beneficial as the tree will reduce salinity, give shade to stock, act as a windbreak and reduce erosion.

Early life and family Born in Wellington, New Zealand, on 31 July 1922, Clark was the son of Aubrey Sherman Clark, a farms inspector, and his wife, Annie Barbara Louisa Clark (n√©e Inman). Through his mother, Clark was a great-grandson of William Inman, founder of passenger shipping company, the Inman Line. On his father's side, he was related to the 18th-century English architect, John Carr. Clark spent most of his childhood in Nelson and was educated at Nelson College from 1937 to 1941, where he won several prizes for drawing. In World War II, he initially enlisted in the 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force, but subsequently transferred to the Royal Navy. He was present during the Normandy landings, and was mentioned in dispatches. Ceramics After the end of the war, Clark remained in Britain and took up an ex-serviceman's scholarship at London's Slade School of Art, where his teachers included Stanley Spencer. He continued his studies at the Central School of Arts and Crafts, being taught by Dora Billington, Clark went on to teach there himself for 25 years, as well as at Goldsmiths' College. In 1953, Clark and Ann Wynn Reeves, whom he married the following year, founded Kenneth Clark Ceramics in the London district of Fitzrovia. The studio relocated to Lewes in 1989. The couple used their complementary skills in their practice: Ann designed many of the motifs and decorative emblems that Kenneth applied to his ceramics, and he used his technical knowledge to recreate glazes used by William De Morgan. He reproduced decorative tiles for Debenham House, as well as the dairy at Windsor Castle following the 1992 fire. As well as tiles, Clark made single hand-thrown domestic ware items, and in the 1960s designed for the Denby and Bristol Potteries, including the \\"Mooncurve\\" range for the latter. Clark served as chairman of the Society of Designer Craftsmen. In the 1980s he assisted the Romanian government with the revitalisation of the pottery industry in that country, and later played a similar role in Afghanistan. In the 1990 Queen's Birthday Honours Clark was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire for services to art and design. The following year he was awarded the Society of Designer Craftsmen's centennial medal. Writings Clark wrote four books on pottery, including The Potter's Manual (1983), regarded as a standard reference work in the field, and The Tile: Making, Designing and Using, published in 2002.

Li Xin is primarily known for his role in assisting Qin Shi Huang in his conquest of the six Warring States. Aside from his career in the Warring States campaigns, he is also a fifth generation ancestor of the Han dynasty \\"Flying General\\" Li Guang. Early life As a son of the governor of Nanjun Commandery, Li Yao, he achieved his accomplishments in battlefields, mainly during Qin Shi Huang's reign. Conquest of Zhao He was commanded by Wang Jian to capture Handan to finalize the fall of Zhao. He obliged, and captured the Zhao capital. Conquest of Yan After the fall of Zhao in 228 BCE, Wang Jian's army stationed in Zhongshan started preparations for an offensive war against Yan. Ju Wu (Èû†Ê≠¶), a Yan minister, proposed to King Xi of Yan to form alliances with the Dai, Qi, and Chu states, and make peace with the Xiongnu in the north, as a preemptive measure in preparation for the Qin invasion. However, Crown Prince Dan felt that the alliance strategy was unlikely to succeed, so he sent Jing Ke to assassinate Ying Zheng, the king of Qin. Jing Ke entered Qin disguised as an envoy, bringing with him a map of Dukang and the head of Fan Wuji, a turncoat Qin general. The assassination attempt failed and Jing Ke was killed. In 227 BCE, using the assassination attempt as casus belli, Ying Zheng ordered Wang Jian to lead an assault against Yan, with Meng Wu (ËíôÊ≠¶) as Wang's deputy. The Qin defeated the Yan army as well as Yan's reinforcements from Dai in a battle on the eastern bank of the Yi River (ÊòìÊ∞¥), after which they captured the Yan capital, Ji (Ëñä; present-day Beijing). King Xi of Yan and his son, Crown Prince Dan, fled with their remaining forces to the Liaodong Peninsula. A Qin army led by Li Xin pursued the retreating Yan to the Yan River (Ë°çÊ∞¥; present-day Hun River, Liaoning), where they engaged with enemy forces and destroyed the bulk of Yan army. Later, King Xi ordered Crown Prince Dan's execution and sent his son's head to Qin as an \\"apology\\" for the assassination attempt. Qin accepted the offer and did not attack Yan for the next three years. In 222 BCE, Wang Ben (ÁéãË≥Å) led a Qin army to invade Liaodong, destroying Yan's remaining forces, capturing King Xi, bringing an end to the state of Yan. The former territories of Yan were partitioned and re-organised into the Qin dynasty's Yuyang (ÊºÅÈôΩ), Beiping (ÂåóÂπ≥), Liaoxi (ÈÅºË•ø) and Liaodong (ÈÅºÊù±) commanderies. Conquest of Chu In 224 BCE, Qin began preparations for an invasion of Chu, its most powerful rival among the six states. During a discussion between Ying Zheng and his subjects, the veteran general Wang Jian claimed that the invasion force needed to be at least 600,000 strong to succeed against Chu, but the younger general Li Xin believed that 200,000 men would be sufficient. Ying Zheng put Li Xin in command of the Qin army to attack Chu. The Chu defenders, led by Xiang Yan, took Li Xin's army by surprise with a 500,000 men army and defeated the Qin invaders in the unfamiliar territory of Huaiyang, modern-day northern Jiangsu and Anhui provinces. Xiang Yan achieved victory by luring the Qin army away through allowing them a few initial victories. But then Li Xin's army was surprisingly ambushed by Lord Changping's army (Lord Changping was the former prime minister of the Qin state). Xiang Yan's army burnt two large Qin camps, and killed seven commandants.Shi Ji, chapter 5 This incident was considered the greatest setback out of all of Qin's campaigns. Henceforth, Ying Zheng assigned Wang Jian the command of a 600,000 strong army in the following year as he had requested and ordered him to lead another attack on Chu. High in morale after their victory in the previous year, the Chu forces were content to sit back and defend against what they expected to be a siege of Chu. In response, Wang Jian decided to lull the Chu garrisons into a false sense of security by appearing to idle in his fortifications while secretly training his troops to fight in Chu territory. After a year, a great portion of the Chu garrisons decided to disband and demobilize due to apparent lack of action from the Qin. Wang Jian invaded at this point, having prepared for war the entire time, and overran Huaiyang and the diminished Chu forces. Chu was swept away by the momentum of the swift assault and could only sustain local guerrilla-style resistance until it was fully conquered with the capture of Shouchun and the death of its last leader, who was either Lord Changping or Fuchu depending on different accounts, in 223 BCE. Conflicting narratives of the battle in the Records of the Grand Historian state that Xiang Yan was either killed in action or committed suicide. Thus the state of Chu was brought to an end. In 222 BCE, the Qin army advanced southward and annexed the Wuyue region (covering present-day Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces).  Conquest of Qi  In 264 BCE, Tian Jian ascended the throne of Qi and was assisted by his mother, the queen dowager, in managing state affairs. Qin bribed Hou Sheng, the Qi chancellor, to dissuade King Jian from helping the other states while they were being attacked by Qin. By 221 BCE, Qi was the only state in China that had yet to be conquered by Qin. Qi hurriedly mobilised its armies to its western borders as a safeguard against a possible Qin invasion. In the same year, Ying Zheng used Qi's rejection of a meeting with a Qin envoy as an excuse to attack Qi. Li Xin led the Qin Army along with Wang Ben, avoided direct confrontation with enemy forces stationed on Qi's western borders, and advanced into Qi's heartland via a southern detour from Yan. The Qin forces met with little resistance as they passed through Qi territory and eventually arrived at Linzi (north of present-day Zibo, Shandong), the capital of Qi. King Jian was caught by surprise and, after being persuaded by Hou Sheng, he surrendered to Qin without putting up a fight. The former territories of Qi were reorganised to form the Qin Empire's Qi and Langya commanderies. Aftermath He retired after the Qin's unification. He was given the area near modern Gansu. In popular culture He, alongside Ying Zheng are protagonists of the Kingdom manga, anime and its 2019 live action film adaptation. In the manga he goes by the name Shin, and later Ri Shin.

Occident was designed primarily for freight work, and did not have passenger accommodations. This Occident should not be confused with the smaller steam launch Occident, apparently propeller-driven, which operated out of Astoria, Oregon in the 1890s. Design and construction Occident was considered a twin vessel to the sternwheeler Orient Occident was described as a freight steamer. Occident was built at Portland, Oregon in 1875. In the fall of 1888, Occident had a draft of 22 inches. Occident was given the official merchant vessel registry number 19448. In 1885, Occident was exclusive of the extension of the main detail over the stern, called the ‚Äúfantail‚Äù on which the stern- wheel was mounted. The beam (width) of the vessel was exclusive of the protective wooden timbers running along the top of the hull called the guards. The depth of hold was . The overall size of the vessel, in 1885, measured in tons, a unit of volume and not weight, was 586.95 gross tons and 429.76 net tons. In November 1879, Occident was described as having ‚Äútastefully furnished‚Äù staterooms and berths which were very wide. Engineering Occident was driven by a stern-wheel, turned by twin steam engines, horizontally mounted, each with bore of and a piston stroke of or In 1879, Occident had two different stern-wheels which could be mounted on the steamer, one used for the seasonal low-water periods,and another for deeper water. Ownership Occident was originally built for the Willamette River Transportation Company. However, Occident did not remain long under the original ownership. In 1875, the Oregon Steam Navigation Company was planning to reenter the steamboat business on the Willamette River, which they had stayed away from since 1864, when an accommodation had been reached between O.S.N. and its then chief competitor on the Willamette, the People‚Äôs Transportation Company. To effect this business plan, on December 29, 1875, O.S.N. set up a subsidiary corporation, the Willamette Transportation and Locks Company, with a capitalization of $1,000,000. The officers of the new corporation were some of the most prominent businessmen in the state of Oregon: John C. Ainsworth, president; R.R. Thompson, vice-president; Theodore Wygant, Bernard ‚ÄúBarney‚Äù Goldsmith, and Frank T. Dodge, directors. The Willamette River Transportation Company was dissolved, and all of its assets, including the steamer Occident, were transferred to the new corporation. Operations = Officers = Almost every prominent steamboat men on the Willamette served on Occident at one time or the other. In November 1879 the officers of Occident were: Miles Bell, captain; James Gist, pilot; W.N. Holmes, purser, Charles Jennings, engineer; George Goward, steward. At various times other officers included: * Captain. Henry Carter, Nat H. Lane, Jr., ; John Kelly, George Reynolds, Other captains of Occident included Sherman V. Short, J.D. Tackaberry (d.1900), and William R. Turnbull (1844-1877). * Chief engineer: Charles E Gore, William Lewis, William J. Maher, and E. Vickers (1844-1893). * Mate: George Benson, Alexander J. ‚ÄúA.J.‚Äù Spong. * Purser: Frank W. Goodhue. * First assistant engineer: Charles H. Jennings. =Work on the Santiam River= On the morning of Thursday, January 13, 1876, Occident arrived at Jefferson, Oregon, a small settlement in Marion County, Oregon on the Santiam River. Jefferson, at river mile 9.0 was considered the head of navigation on the Santiam. No steamer had called at Jefferson since the Calliope, several years before. To reach Jefferson ‚Äúwas something of an accomplishment, since the Santiam, rapid and dashing, was practically unnavigable except during extreme high water and then only for a few days at a time.‚Äù The entire local population turned out to greet Occident. anvils were beaten as a welcome signal. The steamer Champion also arrived at Jefferson at about the same time. Both vessels brought in merchandise to the city and took away, between them, several thousand bushells of wheat from the Granger warehouse. =Sinking of the Dayton= Oregon City, probably in the late 1870s. On Saturday, May 13, 1876, the sternwheeler Dayton was moored at Oregon City, when Occident, then owned by the Willamette River Transportation and Locks Company came into the boat basin at full steam to unload a cargo of wheat for the Oregon City Mills. Dayton, at 203.4 gross tons, was much smaller than Occident. While passing the boat yard, where Dayton was moored, Occident threw up a wake which pushed Dayton onto a snag, knocking a hole in the hull, and sinking Dayton almost immediately. The following Monday, May 15, three pumps were placed into Dayton, and worked from the sternwheeler Bonanza. After a full day of pumping, they were able to raise Dayton. =Low water service= On September 1, 1876, which was the start of the usual fall low water period on the Willamette, the steamer Bonanza was placed on a schedule of running three times a week between Salem and Corvallis, connecting with Occident at Salem. =Race with S.T. Church= At about 5:00 p.m. on October 31, 1878, Occident and another sternwheeler, S.T. Church arrived at Salem on their way upriver. Both of steamers had departed Portland simultaneously, and raced the whole way to Salem, with Church arriving about 3 minutes before Occident. Both boats then departed upriver to pick up freight, and about 7:00 a.m. on the next morning, November 1, they passed by Salem coming downriver. =Sale to Oregon Railway and Navigation Company= In 1879, the Oregon Steam Navigation Company, an extremely profitable company, dissolved and sold its entire fleet of steamers, including Occident, and all of its other assets, to a newly formed corporation, the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company, which was capitalized at $6,000,000. In this manner, the O.R.&N;, as the new company was known, gained control of every significant steamer operating on the Columbia River system. =Rescue of a wood cutter= By November 11, 1876, Occident had switched over to its deep-water stern-wheel. On November 22, 1879, a newspaper, the Salem Daily Talk, reported that on the afternoon of the previous day, November 21, when Occident was coming downriver, just below Eola, Oregon, a man was seen clinging on to a snag in the river. There appears to be an error in the electronic documents of this issue of the newspaper. The document for the first page of the November 21, 1879 issue is correct. The subsequent documents for pages 2‚Äì4 are pages 2‚Äì4 of the November 28, 1879 issue. The second page, which is the source of this information, has the date November 28, 1879, which is consistent with the news items reported on that page. There are no electronic documents for the November 28, 1879 issue. Captain Miles Bell was in command of Occident, and he ordered the steamer stopped, and a boat put out to rescue the man. It turned out the man, named Ross, had been cutting wood with another man, John Cline, and using a skiff, they were coming downriver to Salem, when the skiff overturned, throwing them into the water. Ross grasped hold of the snag, but he had been in the water several hours was nearly exhausted by the time Occident came along. His partner Cline had been able to climb back onto the skiff and floated downstream, where he was rescued by a man on the Polk County, Oregon side of the Willamette, just upriver from Salem. =Fast running time= On Friday, January 31, 1880, Occident ran from Portland, Oregon to Corvallis in 14 hours and 30 minutes running time (probably exclusive of time transiting the Willamette Falls Locks), the fastest time yet between those two cities. On Friday, June 4, 1880, at about 9:00 a.m., William R. Gillmore, a deckhand of the Occident, fell overboard and drowned. The incident occurred near the Boonville warehouse, about four miles upriver from Corvallis. Gilmore‚Äôs body could not be immediately recovered. The body was found floating in the river on June 26, 1880 about four miles south of Corvallis. Gilmore left a wife and two children in Salem. On the Tuesday before February 3, 1882, Occident loaded 2,000 sacks of wheat at Corvallis. As of May 29, 1885, Occident had been seized by the sheriff of Marion County, Oregon for $2,300 in unpaid taxes assessed against the ‚ÄúNarrow Gauge Road.‚Äù The steamer was tied up at Salem. Occident at the time was owned by the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company. =Record wheat harvest= In late October 1888, the fall rains were anticipated to soon raise the level of the Willamette River. There was then reported to have been ‚Äúan enormous quantity of wheat stored along the river awaiting shipment.‚Äù This was said to be a greater amount of wheat, by at least 30%, than any other year in the history of the state. Occident and three other steamers, Bonanza, Champion, and Orient were to transport the accumulated harvest. All the steamers were reported to be ‚Äúin excellent condition, having been thoroughly overhauled recently for the winter.‚Äù When the water has at its highest, all the steamers could easily proceed as far as Harrisburg, Oregon The 1888 shipping season opened on October 29, when Occident came up to Salem from Portland in just 12 hours, including time waiting to transit the locks at Oregon City for two other boats to pass. Disposition Occident was dismantled in Portland in 1891 or 1892. Another source reports that Occident was condemned by the government in 1889 and removed from service.

The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in February 2016. The bridge is long, has a span length of , and a width of . It is faced with Platteville limestone. The area was originally part of the George W. Baird farm, but in the 1920s, much of the farmstead was sold off for development. In 1922 the Edina Country Club housing subdivision was platted, just north of the bridge and north of 50th Street. The Edina Country Club, west of the bridge, was opened in 1923, and other portions of Edina were being developed as well. As traffic increased, the original steel beam bridge was no longer sufficient to accommodate all the vehicles, so the city of Edina sought a replacement in 1937. On March 8, 1937, the Edina City Council accepted the proposal by Lyle Culvert & Pipe Company to build an Armco multi-plate arch bridge. The facing was proposed to be irregularly coursed boulder stone, designed in the WPA Rustic style. Construction began in May 1937, but in July 1937, the design of the stone facing was changed from boulder stone to limestone. This was done to harmonize with the limestone veneer on the nearby St. Stephen's Episcopal Church. The construction schedule did not appear to be set back. Construction was largely complete in August 1937, and a city newsletter published in September 1937 shows the completed bridge. Detail of the underside of the bridge, showing the corrugated steel The multi-plate arch bridge design was introduced in 1931 by the Armco Culvert Manufacturer's Association. The plates are made of galvanized corrugated steel, manufactured in curved segments, and assembled on site to build an arch. The corrugations, about wide and deep, formed a very strong bridge. The multi-plate arch design was popular in the 1930s as an alternative to reinforced concrete slab-and-girder construction for bridges with a short span. The bridge could also be assembled by unskilled labor, and the stone masonry was labor-intensive, so the Works Progress Administration was able to employ a number of people in its construction. While many multi- plate arch bridges were built in Minnesota during the Great Depression, bridges of that type are increasingly rare. A 1988 survey found 35 surviving multi-plate arch bridges in the state, but in 2014, only eight of these bridges were left.

In 1993, John Hare was offered by a Russian exploration team to research the status of the wild Bactrian camel in Mongolia, a critically endangered species of camel. It only survives in the Gobi Desert. In 1994, he presented his findings at an international conference in Ulan-Bator. in 1995 he received permission to enter Lop Nur, the first foreigner to get such permission in 45 years. Lop Nur was also the natural habitat of the wild Bactrian camel and also a former nuclear testing site. The wild Bactrian camels are also able to tolerate salt water with a higher salt content than sea water, explaining their residence in Lop Nur. He undertook expeditions in 1995, 1996, 1997 and 1999 to Lop Nur. In 1995 he became the first foreigner in recorded history to cross the Gashun Gobi Desert from north to south. In 1997, John Hare with Kathryn Rae founded the Wild Camel Protection Foundation, a UK registered charity. The foundation proposed for the establishment of the Lop Nur Wild Camel National Nature Reserve in Xinjiang Province in the former nuclear test site, to which the Chinese government later agreed. The WCPF became responsible for helping the Chinese to establish one of the largest nature reserves in the world, protecting not only the wild Bactrian camel but many other IUCN Red Book listed endangered fauna and flora. John Hare is the sole international consultant for the Reserve. Between 2001-2002 Hare crossed the Sahara Desert from Lake Chad to Tripoli, a journey of 1500 miles, which lasted 3.5 months, to raise awareness for the wild camel. This route had not been followed in its entirety by a foreigner for 100 years. This journey was undertaken to raise funding and awareness of the plight of the wild camel. In 2006 John Hare made the first recorded complete circling by camel of Lake Turkana (Rudolph), in Kenya. This involved swimming 22 camels across River Omo in Ethiopia. In 2005 and 2006 he made two more expeditions into the Chinese and Mongolian Gobi deserts, on domestic Bactrian camels. In 2004 the WCPF established the Hunter Hall Captive Wild Camel Breeding Centre at Zakhyn Us in Mongolia, housing twelve wild camels, which had been rescued from being captured by Mongolian herdsmen. This is the only place in the world where the wild camel is held in captivity apart from two zoos in China. In 2010 the population had increased to twenty-five. The Veterinary University of Vienna published a paper after 5 years of genetic tests on samples from these camels, stating that they were of a \\\\previously unknown species of camel which separated from any other known form of camel over 700,000 years ago and was different from the Bactrian camel. The findings of this paper was accepted by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature which listed the wild camel (Camelus ferus) as critically endangered. In 2013 and 2015 two successful translocation of wild camels was made from the Mongolian Wild camel Breeding Centre into the Gobi Desert. John Hare is also the author of various books, such as The Fearless Four series and various books relating to his travels in the Gobi and the Sahara. Dan Fulani Dan Fulani is a pseudonym for John Hare, allowing him to identify as a Nigerian fiction writer. As Fulani, he published 16 books since 1981, some of which try to highlight development issues through popular fiction. His first published works told the adventures of a young northern Nigerian boy called Sauna and the Sauna stories spread throughout Africa and were in high demand as readers in Southern and East African schools. He later wrote on more contentious themes in particular, 'The Price of Liberty', which told the story of a pesticide, banned in the US, being dumped on Africa. Other themes included a campaign against milk powder, 'The Fight for Life', and drugs, 'Sauna and the Drug Pedlars'. His books have been published by many of the UK's leading publishers including Macmillan, Hodder and Stoughton, Longman and Nelson and also in Nigeria by Bounty Press and Safari. The Sauna series featured in a northern Nigeria television series.

Her memoir for children, When Denver and I Were Young (1956), went through two printings, and she published over 100 poems. She was posthumously inducted into the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame in 1989. Early life and education East High School, Denver Edwina Hume Fallis was born in Denver, Colorado and grew up in a house at the corner of West 14th and Acoma Streets, which is now the site of the Denver Public Library. Her mother's father, Daniel Hurd, was president of the Denver school board. Fallis studied in the Denver public school system and graduated from East High School in 1895. She spoke at the graduation ceremony on \\"Ideas Stronger Than Armies\\", discussing \\"great historical ideas\\". She went on to graduate from the Colorado State College of Education. She also studied at the University of Denver and Columbia University, and took advanced courses in teaching in Chicago. She took her first job as an assistant kindergarten teacher in Denver. During story hour, she found she was able to hold the children's attention if the group was small, but if the group was big, her job was harder. She started creating toys and props to help her students follow the plots of classic stories such as \\"Three Billy Goats Gruff\\", \\"Goldilocks and the Three Bears\\", \\"Chicken Little\\", and \\"The Three Little Pigs\\". When she noticed that the children were using the toys to create scripts of their own, she created animal figurines and \\"wagons, automobiles, trains, [and] airplanes\\", producing about 80 figurines applicable to more than two dozen children's stories. In the late 1930s, Edwina and her sister Bella, who designed the figurines, opened the Fallis Toy Shop in Denver. Seeing the prohibitive cost of manufacturing toys, Edwina wrote a book, The Child and Things (1940), which reproduced images of the toys, and sent a copy to the Association for Childhood Education convention in Milwaukee. The book was seen by a toy manufacturer who arranged for the Judy Company of Minneapolis to manufacture the figurines and send royalty checks to the Fallis Toy Shop. Writer and poet During her 42 years as a kindergarten teacher, Fallis wrote textbooks and articles for teachers. Following her retirement, she penned stories for Child Life magazine and published over 100 poems, many of which appeared in anthologies. During her convalescence from a heart attack, she began writing When Denver and I Were Young (1956), a colorful memoir for children about growing up in Denver between 1876 and 1890. She described such sights as horse-drawn vehicles and the gravity streetcar, school life, and family life such as home canning and \\"patching their clothes until they wore too thin even for patches\\". She also described meeting Baby Doe Tabor outside a store. The book sold out its first printing and went into a second. Other activities Fallis was president of the Denver Woman's Press Club and a board member of the Fox Street Community Center. Honors and awards She was posthumously inducted into the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame in 1989 and the East High Hall of Fame in 2010. Personal life Fallis did not marry. She died at the age of 80 in Denver and was buried in the Riverside Cemetery. In 1961 the Denver school district named the Edwina Hume Fallis Elementary School in her honor.

Baker and his brother became the models for the Kamehameha Statues. Early life and family Baker was born in 1852 at Kailupe, on the island of Oahu, of part Hawaiian, Tahitian, and English descent. His parents were Adam C. Baker, an English sea captain, and Luka Pruvia, daughter of an early Tahitian missionary to Hawaii. His adopted brother was Robert Hoapili Baker. He was educated at Lahainaluna School, an institution founded by the American Protestant missionaries on the island of Maui. He married the High Chiefess Ululani Lewai Pelei≈çh≈çlani, who served as Governess of the Island of Hawaii from 1886 to 1888. Modeling the Kamehameha Statue In 1879, Baker and his brother Robert Hoapili Baker became the model for the Kamehameha Statues by American sculptor Thomas Ridgeway Gould. The statue was commissioned by King KalƒÅkaua in honor of the centennial of James Cook's landing in the Hawaiian Islands. The original statue was cast in 1880 but lost at sea. A second cast was installed in 1883 at Ali ªi≈çlani Hale while the recovered original cast was installed at Kapa ªau, Kohala, the birthplace of Kamehameha I. According to Walter M. Gibson, \\"[t]he artist has copied closely the fine physique of [Robert] Hoapili [Baker]...and it presents a noble illustration and a correct type of superior Hawaiian manhood\\". Two photographs of John modeling as Kamehameha survive, one in its original form and another in the form of a composite photograph with the bare legs of a Hawaiian fisherman.; ; ; ; Political career Running as a member of the Hawaiian National Party, Baker was elected to the House of Representative, the lower house of the legislature of the kingdom. He sat in on the legislative assembly of 1886 and 1890. King KalƒÅkaua appointed him as high sheriff of the Island of Hawaii in 1886 at the time of his wife's appointment as Governess. He also served as a member of the Privy Council of KalƒÅkaua and his successor Queen Liliuokalani.; On March 14, 1891, he was appointed to the staff of Queen Liliuokalani and was elevated to the rank of Colonel. The Royal Governorship of Hawaii Island held originally by his wife Ululani had been abolished by the legislature after the Bayonet Constitution. In 1892, Liliuokalani revived this political position and appointed Baker as Governor of the Island of Hawaii. He served from February 8, 1892 to February 25, 1893. After the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii, the Provisional Government of Hawaii passed an act abolishing the island governorships again; this act passed on February 27 and went into effect on February 28.; ; ; ; ; Baker was an anti-annexationist.  1907 travels in the Pacific  In 1907, Baker journeyed throughout the Pacific and to Asia. He visited Tahiti, the Cook Islands, Tonga, Samoa, Fiji, New Zealand, the Philippines and Japan. During his travels, he met and conversed with many indigenous leaders and colonial government officials including Tongan King George Tupou II, Queen Makea Takau Ariki of Rarotonga in the Cook Islands. Historian Lorenz Gonschor noted that Baker's voyage was \\"far more than a tourist venture\\" and \\"was an act of quasi- diplomacy in the name of the then US-occupied Hawaiian Kingdom\\".  Later life and death  Baker became a successful cattle rancher and businessman in Hilo on the island of Hawaii. He established Pu ªu  ª≈å ª≈ç Ranch at Pi ªihonua and at one time, raised six hundred head of cattle including some longhorns. During the funeral ceremonies in 1917 for Queen Liliuokalani, he helped carry the former queen's crown jewels and orders during the funeral procession from Iolani Palace to her burial at Royal Mausoleum of Hawaii. Baker died on September 7, 1921, at the residence of Elizabeth Booth, in the Pauoa Valley. He was buried at the Homelani Memorial Park in Hilo, Hawaii.

Background For this album, Sybil worked with different producers, including Mike Stock and Pete Waterman, Denise Rich, Prince Charles Alexander and others. The album was released in the US and Canada only. In Europe during the same year, Sybil released a different album titled Good 'N' Ready that shares four songs with Doin' It Now!: \\"You're the Love of My Life\\", \\"The Love I Lost\\", \\"Guarantee of Love\\" and \\"Now or Never\\", but otherwise both albums go in a different musical direction. Next Plateau, Sybil's label in the US, decided to showcase Sybil's R&B;/soul sensibilities for the American market (which was popular at the time), whereas in Europe, PWL Records, Sybil's UK label, decided to release a more dance-orientated album with some Eurohouse sound as well as her soul music showcase. The album includes two covers: the Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes song \\"The Love I Lost\\" and the standard \\"What a Diff'rence a Day Makes\\", first made famous by Dinah Washington in 1959. Two songs on Doin' It Now! had previously been released on other Sybil albums, although the versions included are different mixes: \\"Love's Calling\\" had previously been released on her 1989 album Sybil and \\"Let It Rain\\" had first been released on her 1990 album Sybilization, and released as a single in 1991. Singles The first single from the album was a double A-side single of \\"You're the Love of My Life\\" (co-written by Sybil) and \\"The Love I Lost\\", which was released on its own in the UK and became Sybil's biggest hit there, peaking at #3. The single peaked at #90 on the US Billboard Hot 100, but both songs were bigger hits on other charts: \\"You're the Love of My Life\\" peaked at #37 on the R&B; charts, while \\"The Love I Lost\\" peaked at #18 on the Dance chart. No further singles from the album were released in the US. However, \\"Beyond Your Wildest Dreams\\", a song included on the European Good 'N' Ready album, was released as a single in September 1993 in the US. The European version of the song was a ballad, whereas for the US market the song was given a hip-hop makeover and a male rapper was added to the song, making it a mid- tempo hip-hop/R&B; song. It peaked at #90 in the R&B; charts. Critical and commercial reception Justin Kantor of AllMusic praised Sybil's voice but criticized the inconsistent material. The album failed to chart in the US.

An earthquake occurred in Christchurch on 14 February 2016 at 1:13 p.m. local time (00:13 UTC) and initially recorded as 5.9 on the Richter scale, but subsequently reviewed as 5.7. Often referred to as the Valentine's Day earthquake, it was centred in the sea off New Brighton at a depth of . It was the first large earthquake that the Christchurch area had experienced since May 2012, and it was part of the earthquake sequence that started with the 4 September 2010 Canterbury earthquake. A number of cliffs collapsed at Scarborough (Godley Head and Whitewash Head), Richmond Hill, and Sumner (Peacock's Gallop). The shipping containers that were still placed along Peacock's Gallop on Main Road stopped falling rocks from hitting passing cyclists. Two surfers were below Whitewash Head and had car-size rocks crash into the sea around them. Impact Westfield Riccarton, Eastgate Mall, The Palms, and Ballantynes were evacuated and closed for engineering inspection. There was confusion at Northlands Shopping Centre as Police encouraged some shopkeepers to evacuate, but the alarm was not sounded as is otherwise done when the mall is to be cleared. Some shop keepers were told by mall management staff that there would be financial penalties if they did not keep their shop open. Nearly 50 shops in the mall closed, partially due to the fact that stock had fallen out of shelves and into the aisles. On the Saturday after the earthquake, The Press in its editorial was very critical of mall management, stating that \\"management's response to the entire incident profoundly and completely misses the point\\". Shortly after the earthquakes, it was found that seven of the forty historic fa√ßades in the central city's New Regent Street were unstable. The buildings were cordoned off, and that stopped the heritage tram from running, which had a major impact on those businesses that remained open. The tram started operating again in May 2016. Liquefaction occurred in Bexley, Parklands, and New Brighton. Power was lost to around 500 houses. The CoCA Art Gallery, which had opened for the first time since the 2011 Christchurch earthquake on 13 February 2016, the day prior to this earthquake, was closed again. Little structural damage has been reported in the Christchurch Central City. There were no reports of serious injury, and St. John Ambulance deactivated its emergency operations centre later in the day. The National Crisis Management Centre in Wellington was also stood down, with the emergency response to be managed by Christchurch City Council. Some tracks in the Port Hills were closed due to rockfall, including Rapaki Track and the Bridle Path. Psychologists argued that survivors of the 2011 Christchurch earthquake, especially those who lost their homes or friends, experience painful memories during aftershocks. The Canterbury District Health Board (CDHB) had sought additional funding for mental health since shortly after the February 2011 earthquake. Despite the proven need of the area, the Ministry of Health proposed to further cut the mental health budget of the CDHB while on average, other district health boards were to receive increased funding; this information was revealed two days after the Valentine's Day earthquake. Responding with an editorial, The Press called the situation \\"both disgraceful and distressing\\" and challenged the health minister, Jonathan Coleman, to come to Canterbury and see for himself. In early March, Coleman announced that officials are working on a package that would assign millions in additional funding to Canterbury for mental health. Coleman cited the February 2016 as the reason for the additional funding: > As soon as the Valentine's Day quake hit I was sitting up in Auckland and > thought, this is going to be big in terms of the health sector. Christchurch mayor Lianne Dalziel talked about her reaction to the Valentine's Day earthquake: > You know, it was a shock. I haven't been proud to admit to everyone that I > did scream. I didn't expect to be shocked by an earthquake. I actually got > so used to them that I don't mind them ... but this one came from nowhere.

The scope of body shaming is wide, and can include, although is not limited to fat-shaming, shamning for thinness, height-shaming, shaming of hairiness (or lack thereof), of hair-color, body-shape, one's muscularity (or lack thereof), shaming of looks (facial features), and in its broadest sense may even include shaming of tattoos and piercings or diseases that leave a physical mark such as psoriasis. In a study of children's film and books regarding messages about the importance of appearance, media targeted for children were heavily saturated with messages emphasizing attractiveness as an important part of relationships and interpersonal interaction. Among the movies used in the study, two Disney movies contained the highest number of messages about personal beauty. This study also found 64% of the videos studied portrayed obese characters as unattractive, evil, cruel, and unfriendly, and more than half of the portrayals involved the consideration or consumption of food. Some forms of body shaming have ancient origins in popular superstition, such as prejudice against red (or ginger) hair.Dettmar, Esther Katherine. Revising identification: fairy tales that transform tradition from within. Diss. University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2016. Forms of discrimination may also differ significantly depending on age group. For example, among preadolescents, tall tweens are sometimes depicted as awkward, and sometimes face derogatory pejorative terms such as \\"lanky\\". However, upon adulthood, such unflattering attitudes typically undergo a reversal as height is typically valued among adults.Chen, Hong, and Todd Jackson. \\"Are cognitive biases associated with body image concerns similar between cultures?.\\" Body Image 2.2 (2005): 177-186. Sometimes body shaming can extend to a perception that one does not sufficiently display masculinity or femininity. For example, men with wide hips or prominent breasts or lack of facial hair are sometimes shamed for appearing feminine.Namaste, Ki. \\"Genderbashing: Sexuality, gender, and the regulation of public space.\\" Environment and Planning D: Society and Space 14.2 (1996): 221-240. Similarly, women have been body-shamed for their lack of femininity for appearing to have a man- bulge,https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/that-your-d-bella-thorne-body-shamed-posing- see-through-bra-top-boxer-1633094 or for having broad shoulders, traits that are typically associated with men. Extensive levels of body-shaming can have negative emotional effects, including a reduction in self-esteem and other issues such as eating disorders, anxiety, body dysmorphia and depression.Matheson, Mikayla. \\"Women‚Äôs Body Image in the Media: An Analytical Study of Recent Body Image Movements across Media Platforms.\\" (2017).

The ancestor of what became the St. Roch Market was a city market originally constructed in 1838 in the \\"New Marigny\\" neighborhood of New Orleans, Louisiana, United States, as an open-air market on Washington Avenue (later renamed St Roch Avenue). The neighborhood itself was originally called the \\"New Marigny\\", an extension of the slightly older Faubourg Marigny neighborhood on the other side of St. Claude Avenue. After a yellow fever epidemic in the early 1870s in which many neighborhood residents survived, the street, neighborhood, and the market itself was renamed as the St. Roch neighborhood after Saint Roch for the saint's patronage of incurable diseases and lost causes. Interior, October 1937, before WPA renovations Interior, July 1938, after WPA renovations The building itself has been renovated several times. In 1875, the current building was constructed and the market renamed the St Roch Market (post epidemic). It was next renovated and enclosed after World War I. Then in the 1930s through the Works Progress Administration, the building was once again restored and extensively remodeled. Up until the 1950s the market had been a multi-vendor market selling fresh produce, prepared foods, butchered items, and sundries of all varieties. After World War II, it was renovated to again and became the popular Lama's Supermarket, predominantly known for seafood and plate meals. Shuttered St. Roch Market with its pre-Katrina signage, January 2006 In the 1990s it had fallen into disrepair, but was still an active part of the neighborhood. For a time it housed a Chinese food restaurant . In 2005 it was serving inexpensive seafood and po-boy sandwiches until the evacuation of the city for Hurricane Katrina. Like most of the city it was damaged in the hurricane and extensive Federal levee failure floods that followed, and the market did not reopen. In the 10 years that followed Katrina the building was gutted but sat vacant until 2012, when the city of New Orleans, under Mayor Mitch Landrieu began a campaign to obtain state and federal funding to restore the building. In August 2014 the city leased the building to a private business who returned the building to a multi-tenant \\"food hall\\" which is a modernization of the building's original use selling both prepared and fresh foods in a multi-vendor format.

He was the first Coast and Geodetic Survey Corps officer to reach flag rank. Early life Patton was born in DeGraff, Ohio, on 29 December 1882, the son of Oliver Patton and the former Ida M. Cloninger. After primary and secondary education at public schools in Sidney, Ohio, he studied engineering at Coast Guard Academy. At Western Reserve University, he graduated with a Bachelor of Philosophy degree in June 1904.Profiles in Time: C&GS; Biographies: Raymond Stanton Patton Career =Early career= Within a month of his graduation, Patton accepted a position in 1904 in the Field Corps of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, which at the time was an entirely civilian organization. He began field work in August 1904, serving along the United States East Coast as a civilian junior officer aboard the Coast and Geodetic Survey survey launch USC&GS; Hydrographer; during his tour aboard Hydrographer, he participated in survey work to update the United States Coast Pilots publications and accompanied a shore party as it conducted topographic surveys in Virginia. In 1906 he reported aboard the Coast and Geodetic Survey ship USC&GS; Thomas R. Gedney for survey work along the southeast coast of the Territory of Alaska. From the spring of 1907 to 1910, Patton served in the Philippine Islands aboard two survey ships owned by the Insular Government of the Philippine Islands and operated by the Coast and Geodetic Survey, USC&GS; Romblon and USC&GS; Research. During this tour, he took part in hydrographic surveys of the Ta√±on Strait, the north coast of Negros, and the southeast coast of Luzon and was a member of shore parties engaged in surveys of Mindanao, Bohol, and Camiguin and nearby islets. Returning to operations along the U.S. East Coast, Patton took part in projects such as triangulation in Massachusetts and resurveys of the Delaware Bay and Albemarle Sound from 1910 to 1911. In the summer of 1911 he became executive officer of the survey ship USC&GS; A. D. Bache, operating along the United States Gulf Coast. Later in 1911, he transferred to the survey ship USC&GS; Carlile P. Patterson to serve as her executive officer, initially for operations along the Alaskan coast, but before the year was over also including survey work along the United States West Coast and in the Pacific Ocean approaches to the Panama Canal. In 1912, he became a commanding officer for the first time, taking command of the survey ship USC&GS; Explorer; for the next three years, he commanded her during survey operations along the coast of the Territory of Alaska, among the most important of which was survey work along the approach to the Kuskokwim River in Southwest Alaska. In 1915, Patton took charge of the Coast and Geodetic Survey office in Washington, D.C., responsible for compilation and publication of the United States Coast Pilots, overseeing both field and office work necessary for the periodic revision and updating of the publications. During this tour, he also authored two Coast Pilots, the 1916 edition of the Coast Pilot for the Alaskan coast from Yakutat Bay to the Arctic Ocean and the 1917 edition of the Coast Pilot for the U.S. West Coast. =World War I= The United States entered World War I on the side of the Allies on 6 April 1917, and on 22 May 1917 a new uniformed service of the United States, the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey Corps, was created within the Coast and Geodetic Survey. Patton was commissioned as a lieutenant in the new service, serving as a commissioned hydrographic and geodetic engineer. In accordance with Executive Order 2707, he was among a number of Coast and Geodetic Survey Corps officers transferred to the jurisdiction of the United States Department of the Navy on 24 September 1917 for wartime service with the United States Navy. He was enrolled as a lieutenant in the United States Naval Reserve Force on 19 November 1917.NOAA History: World War I Military Records of Coast & Geodetic Survey Personnel: Raymond S. Patton Patton was assigned to the U.S. Navy's Bureau of Navigation, with which he took up duty at the United States Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C., as Assistant in the Time Service and Nautical Instrument Division. He became chief of the division on 1 March 1918. The division was responsible for purchasing and distributing to U.S. Navy vessels all navigational instruments except compasses and compass fixtures; for the cleaning, compensation rating, and issue of all U.S. Navy marine chronometers; and with sending out the daily time signal by telegraph and radio. Before World War I broke out, the U.S. Navy had obtained most of its navigational instruments from foreign manufacturers, and their production in the United States had only become a major effort since then, making the division's efforts to procure such instruments in a timely manner a challenging task. Patton received a promotion to lieutenant commander on 1 October 1918. After the war ended on 11 November 1918, he remained on duty in the Navy until 31 March 1919, when he received an honorable discharge. =Nautical chart production reforms= Patton returned to the Coast and Geodetic Survey on 1 April 1919 to resume duties as a commissioned officer in the Coast and Geodetic Survey Corps. His first assignment upon his return was as Chief of the Chart Division, which at the time was under criticism for the length of time it took to produce new or updated nautical charts after the completion of field survey work. Until his arrival, Coast and Geodetic Survey officials viewed this delay as an inevitable consequence of the need for painstaking work to ensure the accuracy of new or updated charts, but Patton instituted a number of reforms ‚Äì including a complete reorganization of the division, the adoption of a comprehensive production schedule for charts, and the introduction of more efficient techniques and equipment ‚Äì that allowed the Chart Division to produce its charts in one-third the time it required before he took charge without any sacrifice of quality. =Shoreline preservation work= In 1921, the State of New Jersey's Board of Commerce and Navigation asked United States Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover to assign a member of the United States Department of Commerce to serve on an engineering advisory board created to study beach erosion in New Jersey and recommend better means of protecting valuable coastal areas from erosion. The Coast and Geodetic Survey was a component of the Department of Commerce, and Patton had conducted extensive research into beach erosion since taking charge of the Chart Division, so Hoover appointed him to serve on the advisory board while continuing his duties as chief of the Chart Division. Patton played an active role on the board, which published two reports ‚Äì in 1922 and 1924 ‚Äì which provided the State of New Jersey with information that allowed it to play an active role in protecting its beaches from erosion. While remaining Chief of the Chart Division, Patton became a member of the National Research Council's Committee on Shoreline Investigations in 1925, and in 1926 he became the committee's Chairman. The Committee suspected that other states in addition to New Jersey faced beach erosion problems and that beach erosion might constitute a national problem for the United States that therefore was a matter of interest to the National Research Council. During Patton's tenure on the committee, it found that almost every state along the U.S. East and Gulf Coasts faced beach erosion problems and was struggling to cope with them independently. In order to bring together the funding and personnel necessary to address the beach erosion problem on a national scale, the Committee on Shoreline Investigations and the governors of the states along the East and Gulf Coasts organized through joint action the American Shore and Beach Preservation Association in December 1926, with Patton playing a major role in its formation and serving as its secretary-treasurer until June 1929 and as one of its directors until his death in 1937. Possessing extensive knowledge of beach erosion issues and shoreline preservation efforts ‚Äì he was considered one of the foremost experts on the subject in the United States ‚Äì as well as of the activities and records of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, Patton frequently served as an expert witness in litigation concerning riparian property boundaries. =Director= The first director of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, Colonel Ernest Lester Jones, died on 9 April 1929. Patton, who had by then reached the rank of captain, saw his long tour as chief of the Chart Division finally come to an end on 29 April 1929, when Herbert Hoover, by then President of the United States, selected him to succeed Jones as director. During his tour as director, which lasted until his death in 1937, Patton continued and accelerated reforms Jones had begun to modernize the Coast and Geodetic Survey's surveying methods and equipment and increase the efficiency of its operations, in many cases championing the adoption and testing of experimental methods that proved successful as their use was refined and expanded. After the onset of the Great Depression, Patton procured emergency funds to expand the Coast and Geodetic Survey's coastal operations between 1933 and 1935, using the expansion as a vehicle to both put unemployed Americans, especially engineers, to work and to catch up on a backlog of urgently needed survey work that had been awaiting the Coast and Geodetic Survey's attention. In 1936, Patton received a promotion to rear admiral, becoming the first officer of the Coast and Geodetic Survey Corps to reach flag rank. Personal and professional life Patton married Virginia Mitchell (1889-1980)Find-A-Grave Virginia M Patton of Seattle, Washington on November 7, 1912. They had a son, Raymond S. Patton, and two daughters, Helen M. Patton and Virginia M. Patton. During his Coast and Geodetic Survey career, Patton earned a reputation for having a brilliant mind and a wide range of interests ‚Äì he authored numerous articles on a wide variety of subjects for the Coast and Geodetic Survey and for scientific and engineering journals ‚Äì and as a modest and unassuming colleague and leader with high ideals and integrity. Patton was elected a member of the American Society of Civil Engineers on 11 July 1921. At the time of his death, he was past president of the Washington Society of Engineers, a director of the American Shore and Beach Preservation Association, a life trustee of the National Geographic Society, a trustee of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, and a member of the Association of American Geographers, the American Geophysical Union, the American Astronomical Society, the Cosmos Club of Washington, D.C., and the National Research Council's Engineering Advisory Committee on Coast Erosion to the New Jersey Board of Commerce and Navigation, Death Patton died on the morning of 25 November 1937 at his home in Washington, D.C. He was buried with full military honors on 27 November 1937 at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia. In tribute to Patton after his death, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Daniel C. Roper wrote: > In the death of Admiral Patton the Government has lost one of its most > capable officials and the engineering profession one of its outstanding > leaders.

It protects both lake shore and the source of the Lena River. The reserve stretches along the western coast of Lake Baikal for about 120 km, with an average width of 65 km. The reserve is situated in the Kachugsky District of Irkutsk Oblast. As of December 1996, the Baikal-Lena Reserve (combined with the Barguzin and Baikal Reserves) is included in the list of sites of World Cultural and Natural Heritage, and a World Heritage Site with Pribaikalsky National Park. The Baikal-Lena Reserve is managed jointly with Pribaikalsky National Park, which is immediately to the south, thus protecting a continuous 580 km of shoreline on Lake Baikal. Topography The Baikal-Lena Reserve has three sectors: the coast (\\"The shore of brown bears\\"), the Upper Lena River, and the Kirengsky sector. Because of its position on the lake shore with a mountain ridge to the west to screen the prevailing winds, Baikal-Lena is the driest reserve on the lake. The Lena River originates in the reserve, running for 250 km within the borders. Rivers on the east slope of the Baikal Mountains are short and shallow, and at times their flow is insufficient to reach the lake and the water drains into the ground. Lena River in Biakal-Lena Zapovednik Climate and Ecoregion Baikal-Lena Reserve is located in the East Siberian taiga ecoregion. Between the Yenisei River and Lena River. Its northern border reaches the Arctic Circle, and its southern border reaches 52¬∞N latitude. The dominant vegetation is light coniferous taiga with larch (Larix gmelinii forming the canopy in areas with low snow cover. This ecoregion is rich in minerals. The climate of Baikal-Lena is Subarctic climate, without dry season (K√∂ppen climate classification Subartic climate (Dfc)). This climate is characterized by mild summers (only 1-3 months above ) and cold, snowy winters (coldest month below ). During the warmest month in Baikal-Lena, August, the average temperature is + 14 C; in January the average is -18 C. Precipitation ranges from 250 mm per year on the coast to 1,000 mm on the mountain tops. Fogs are frequent in the first half of summer. Flora and fauna 86% of the Reserve is forested, with taiga characteristics. The territory has 6 species of conifers (including Siberian larch, pine, Siberian pine, Siberian fir, spruce) and 5 species of hardwood (including white birch, willow, aspen, and poplar). There are swamps and marshes on the lowland river floodplains. There are 58 species of mammals in the reserve. The common predators are the sable, ermine, weasel, otter, and the wolverine. Swamp in Baikal-Lena Ecotourism As a strict nature reserve, the Baikal-Lena Reserve is mostly closed to the general public, although scientists and those with 'environmental education' purposes can make arrangements with park management for visits. There are three 'ecotourist' routes in the reserve, however, that are open to the public, but written permits must be obtained in advance at the reserves main offices in Irkutsk. The boundaries of the reserve do not extend over the waters of the lake, so it is possible to undertake water tours along the coast. The reserve also permits group rafting trips on the Lena River upon written application and approval.

The Waaltje (common name; Dutch for Little Waal) is a dammed river in the western Netherlands, southeast of Rotterdam. Historically it used to be the western end of the Waal river, hence its official name continues to be Waal, although the intermediate Waal sections, Boven Merwede, Beneden Merwede, and a subsection of the Noord, have long changed their names. The water The Waaltje marks the border between the Zwijndrechtse Waard, formerly a separate island, and the historic Island of IJsselmonde. Ever since this section of the Waal was dammed, IJsselmonde also encompasses the Zwijndrechtse Waard (see map to the right). The Waaltje runs from Hendrik-Ido-Ambacht, along Oostendam, through Rijsoord, and along Barendrecht to Heerjansdam. In Heerjansdam it now connects to the Oude Maas through a pumping station. In 1332 William I, Count of Hainaut had the Waal dammed at Oostendam. The Waaltje connected to the Noord through the old port of Ambacht and a lock that enabled riverboats to pass the Oostendam until the 20th century. Since then, no sailing connection is available. More recently, the old port of Ambacht has also been dammed on the northeast side, transforming it into another enclosed section of the old Waal. Bridges, roads and paths The Waaltje is crossed by a highway, the A16, the railway between Rotterdam and Dordrecht, the HSL and the Betuweroute. The A15 runs between the A16 and the Noord to the north of the Waaltje. Along the eastern bank of the Waaltje in Heerjansdam, between the clubhouse of the business association and the restaurant, volunteers from among others the environmental association Heerjansdam created an educational nature trail named Waalpad. Other walking trails along the Waaltje can be found in Hendrik- Ido-Ambacht, along the Kerkstraat and between Oordenweg and Jaapgpad. Nature development Wevershoek in Barendrecht also offers opportunities to walk along the Waaltje. Management and direct uses The Waaltje is managed by the water board Hollandse Delta.

History In 1211, D. Afonso II awarded the \\"lands of Avis\\" to the Knights of √âvora, under the dependency of the Order of Calatrava, in the person of D. Fern√£o Anes, with the condition that the knight settle the lands and erect a castle. This edict resulted in the settlement of the Military Order of S√£o Bento in Avis, three years later, and the construction of a castle and fortified walls by Master-Prior D. Fern√£o Anes and Master D. Fernando Rodrigues Monteiro. Immediately, in April 1214 there was an agreement between Fern√£o Eanes and the Bishop of √âvora, D. Soeiro, over the use of the land rents in √âvora and settlement of Benavente to support the construction. On 12 January 1215, D. Mafalda, daughter of D. Sancho I, bequeathed to the Master of Avis the settlement of Seia. By the middle of the year (10 July) D. Afonso II had granted the settlers of Avis a foral (royal charter) similar to that established for √âvora, which was confirmed in August 1218 by the King. Martim Fernandes, Master of the Order of Avis signed a new settlement foral on 20 August 1223. By 1331, Gil Peres, Master of the Order obtained a judgment against the Moor, Mafamede Francelho, who had been appointed alcalde and judge of Avis, thereby making them alcaldes of the castle. By the 15th century, the fortifications are rehabilitated by the Condest√°vel D. Pedro. It was during this century that the construction of the keep, addorsed to the conventual buildings, and the painting of the same, by order of Master D. Pedro. In 1473, D. Afonso V authorized the partial demolition of the tower of the √âvora Gate, in order to transform it into a dovecote. Sometime during the 16th century, there were alterations made to the fortifications, while a new foral issued by King D. Manuel. By 1556, the convent record, written by Jorge Lopes, referred to the Keep being the possession of the Masters of Avis. In the 17th century, the old Porta do Arco de Baixo was concealed and a new Porta do Arco was constructed. The Agiol√≥gio Lusitano (1625), authored by Father Jorge Cardoso, referred to the existence of five towers and six gates. On 19 October 1654, friar Ambr√≥sio Marques requested that the castle tower addorsed to the convent be demolished, since it threatened the destruction of the building: rubble had previously destroyed the chicken coup as it fell. By the end of the century, during the reign of King John IV, the towers in the northeast and southeast were demolished, and its materials used in the construction of two ravelins in the south and southwest. In 1708, Father Carvalho da Costa referred to the existence of five towers and six gates, that included the Anjo, Baixo (Queen's Gate), √âvora (with a cross), Santo Ant√≥nio (also known as the Porta Nova), S√£o Roque and Postigo. In 1730, a description by D. Francisco Xavier do Rego, referred to the existence of six towers (Queen's, √âvora, S√£o Roque, Porta de Santo Ant√≥nio, Santo Ant√≥nio and keep tower) with their associated gates (Anjo, Baixo, √âvora, S√£o Roque, Santo Ant√≥nio and Postigo). The Parochial Memories of 1758, signed by friar Gaspar Xavier Leit√£o, referred to a walled town, constituted by a regular square, and by 17th century, two forts that protected the √àvora and the Santo Ant√≥nio Gates. The towers were high, but in ruin since the stones were reused in the construction of the forts, making the castle a constant profile. At this time, the castle included four towers remained unscathed throughout this period, specifically, the Keep Tower, Porta de Santo Ant√≥nio Tower, Porta de S√£o Roque Tower and the Masters' Tower (where the friars were incarcerated). The castle was encircled by a river and cliffs, creating a natural barrier and difficult access. By 4 December 1892, in an article within the newspaper O S√©culo, the castle was described as a very old tower, with Gothic windows, each with its own bell. At the time of the disbanding of the religious orders in Portugal (1834), the Order of Avis had in its possession the control of 18 villages, 49 commendations and 128 priories. As a consequence, the lands controlled by the Order of Avis, in addition to possessions and properties, were sold to individual property- owners and the State. Between 1915 and 1918, the historic keep tower, which was addorsed to the Convent of S√£o Bento de Avis was demolished. In 1921, part of the walls alongside the lands of the Monastery of Avis fell apart. On 30 May 1941, there was a debate to maintain the continuity between the towers, Castle and Hospital of the Miseric√≥rdia, and that the property should not be alienated. On 25 November 1943, a letter from the DGEMN was published over the necessity to expropriate some the buildings, in order to remove from the walls and towers of the castle. For many years, homes, buildings and structures were being constructed against the walls, potentially destroying the value and importance of the historical properties. Ant√≥nio Pais da Silva Marques wrote to the DGEMN (8 November 1944), where he ridiculed the utopian ideal and pretension in reconstructing the primitive castle, since it would be necessary to demolition the entire settlement, including many of the addorsed houses. On 20 January 1945, it was decided to survey the town and the walls, to analyze the possibility of demolitioning some properties, but by 5 March 1947, the investigation had not been concluded nor were there any buildings designated for demolition. Joana Proc√≥pio issued a request on 24 November 1953 for intervention by the DGEMN to restore the wall destroyed during a bad storm, since it put here residence in risk of destruction. During a visit to the area in December, it was decided to consolidate the corners of the towers, which were falling apart due to water infiltration. On 16 June 1955, the municipal council indicated their intention to construct a tourist path over the walls. But, in 1959, the DGEMN reconstructed the walls, and many of the curtains along the Rua dos Muros were consolidated owing to their terrible state. The job was tendered to Odilom Martind Garcia. A letter from Jo√£o Lopes Cravitas dated 2 April 1965 solicited the authorization to consolidate the walls near many of the buildings in risk, a project that was budgeted for 500$000 escudos. It was authorized, but with the condition that the public works would be carried through, accompanied by the DREMS. Yet, these repairs were insufficient, and a letter from president of the municipal council (dated 7 August 1970), noted the importance of proceeding with repairs to the walls alongside the hospital of the Santa Casa da Miseric√≥rdia. On 29 August, the volunteer firefighters of Avis requested permission to erect a siren on the south tower of the castle. Architecture The castle is addorsed and integrated in to the residential buildings at the top of a hill, dominated by a valley. This high place permitted observation across the vast landscape and visual communication with many of the local fortifications, including the castles of Alter do Ch√£o and Pavia. The fortification is an example of medieval and transitional architecture, composed of masonry and stone, with mortar and clay limestone. The perpendicular walls and broken by rectangular towers, with bastions. Of the original six towers constructed during its history, only three remains: the tower of S√£o Roque, Santo Ant√≥nio and the Queen's tower. The primary/dominant tower tower keep that include two halls with vaulted ceilings, with sills providing illumination. These spaces were decorated in cork, had a chimney, places for flags and one grated window surmounted by the coat-of-arms of the Avis with inscription. In reality there two historic inscriptions. One on a limestone plaque: :\\"Era de 1330, a 6 dias de Fevereiro, come√ß√°r√£o a fazer este Castello por mandado do Mestre de Aviz Dom Louren√ßo Affonso, e elle pos a primeira pedra, M.C.C.B.III.C Castello\\" : It was in 1330, on 6 days of February, they started to make this Castle by order of the Master of Aviz Dom Louren√ßo Afonso, and he placed the first stone in M.C.C.B.III.C Castille The second is situated on the keep tower, over the cross of the Order of Aviz: :\\"Era de 1336 annos a 25. dias andados de Fevereiro, fez este Castello Dom Louren√ßo Affonso Mestre de Aviz √† honra, e Servi√ßo de Deos, e de Santa Maria sua Madre, e das Ordens do muito nobre Senhor Dom Diniz Rey de portugal, e do Algarve, Reynante em aquelle tempo, e em defendimento de seus Reynos.

His sculptures are located within public parks, museums and schools throughout Maine and the United States. Some of Lyford's best known pieces includes \\"My Mother the Wind,\\" which was placed on the waterfront in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, in 1975, and \\"Life Force,\\" a seven- ton dolphin sculpture created from Deer Isle granite, which stands outside the Regency Hotel in Portland, Maine. Examples of his work are housed within the permanent collections of the Portland Museum of Art, the Colby College Museum of Art, the Farnsworth Art Museum, and the Ogunquit Museum of American Art in Maine. Biography =Early life and career= Lyford was born in 1925 in Sayre, Pennsylvania, to Frederic Eugene and Eleanor (n√©e Cabot) Lyford. He was raised in the nearby village of Waverly, New York before moving with his parents to Upper Darby, Pennsylvania, and then Scarsdale, New York. He graduated from Scarsdale High School in 1942. He enrolled in Cornell University for architecture after high school, but left early to enlist in the United States military during World War II. He served in combat as a rifleman, runner and scout, with the 96th Infantry Division during the Battle of Leyte in the Philippines. He was transferred to the Army Signal Corps in early 1945 and stationed in Cebu City for the remainder of World War II. He re-enrolled at Cornell University in January 1946 with the aid of the G.I. Bill, switched majors, and received a Master of Fine Arts in 1950. Prior to graduating from Cornell, Lyford completed the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture summer artists residency in 1947, which marked his first serious artistic endeavour. Lyford relocated to New York City after graduating from Cornell, where he wrote, directed and produced television commercials for NBC and J. Walter Thompson, an advertising agency. He married his wife, Joan Richmond, in 1957. They relocated to Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1957, where Lyford was hired to create educational television programming at WGBH-TV, Boston's PBS affiliate. He also helped to launch WENH-TV in Durham, New Hampshire (now New Hampshire Public Television). =Art and sculpture= Lyford transitioned from television back to the arts in 1963, when he was hired as an art history and sculpture teacher by Phillips Exeter Academy, a selective private school, and moved to Exeter, New Hampshire. He eventually became the head of the academy's art department and director for the Lamont Gallery during his 23-year tenure at Phillips Exeter. During this time, he established his art studio, first in a garage in Durham, New Hampshire, and then in an old chicken coop. This allowed him to begin his focus on large sculptures, often crafted from black granite, but also marble and wood as well. One of his first major large sculptures was a wooden sculpture of geese, which was installed at the Mount Sunapee Resort in New Hampshire. Lyford retired from Phillips Exeter Academy in 1986 after a 23-year teaching career as the school. He and his wife then moved to their summer home in Pemaquid, Maine, on Pemaquid Harbor, which the couple had originally purchased for $7,000. Lyford maintained art studios in both New Hampshire and New Harbor, Maine. Four of his large, public sculptures can be found in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. \\"The Whale\\", which now stands in Prescott Park, was carved from a massive block of black granite from Australia, which had originally been imported during the construction of a large Portsmouth high rise. Lyford had purchased the leftover Australian granite to create \\"The Whale\\", as well as another landmark Portsmouth monument, \\"My Mother the Wind\\", which was installed on Four Tree Island on the city's waterfront in 1975, facing the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. \\"My Mother the Wind\\", now a city landmark, is composed of seven tons of Australian black granite. According to his son, Matt Lyford, \\"My Mother the Wind\\" is an anti- war sculpture which shows a mother and child escaping a battle. In Maine, one of Lyford's best known sculptures is \\"Life Force\\", which stands outside the Regency Hotel in Portland. The sculpture, which was created from seven tons of black granite from Deer Isle, Maine, shows three dolphins leaping from the water. \\"Remember\\", a black granite sculpture of a goose, stands in the peony garden at the headquarters of Maine Audubon in Falmouth, Maine. Lyford created \\"Remember\\" in the aftermath of the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill. He chose black granite because the color recalls a seabird covered in oil. He originally called the sculpture \\"Thanks, Exxon\\", but changed the name to encourage people to remember the costs of environmental, manmade calamities. Elsewhere in Maine, his sculptures can be found within the terminal at the Portland International Jetport. A large sculpture of a mother seal and her pup stands outside the main entrance of the Vivian E. Hussey Elementary School in Berwick, Maine. His pieces have also been installed at museums in neighboring states, including the USS Albacore museum in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and the New Bedford Whaling Museum in New Bedford, Massachusetts. Lyford was a resident of New Harbor, Maine, where he kept his studio for many years. He suffered from arthritis, which prevented him from sculpting during his later life. In 2014, Lyford was the subject of an episode of the Maine Masters called \\"Cabot Lyford: Portrait of a Man as Artist\\", by filmmaker Dale Schierholt.

It is an erect shrub with large, clustered leaves and large, attractive lilac-coloured or purple flowers, sometimes so densely clustered that they appear like compound heads of terminal flowers. Description Eremophila magnifica is an erect shrub which grows to a height of . Its leaves, which smell strongly of nutmeg when crushed, are densely clustered near the ends of the branches, bluish-green, lance-shaped, mostly long and wide. The edges of the leaves are hairy. The flowers are borne in groups of 2 to 4 in, clustered near the ends of the branches in leaf axils on hairy stalks which are long. There are 5 green to dull purple, hairy, linear to triangular sepals which are mostly long. The petals are long and are joined at their lower end to form a tube. The petal tube is lilac-coloured on the outside and deep lilac on the inside of the petal lobes. There are translucent spots on the petal tube and lobes, the outer surface is hairy, the inner surface of the lobes is glabrous and the inside of the tube is filled with long, soft hairs. The 4 stamens are fully enclosed in the petal tube. Flowering occurs from August to November and the fruits which follow are dry, oval-shaped and long. Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described by Robert Chinnock in 2007 and the description was published in Eremophila and Allied Genera: A Monograph of the Plant Family Myoporaceae. The specific epithet (magnifica) is a Latin word meaning \\"noble\\", \\"eminent\\" or \\"splendid\\", in reference to the large, attractive flowers. In the same book, Chinnock described two subspecies and the names are accepted at the Australian Plant Census: *Eremophila magnifica Chinnock subsp. magnifica which has glabrous branches and leaf surfaces (other than the margins); *Eremophila magnifica subsp. velutina Chinnock which has velvety branches and leaves Distribution and habitat Subspecies magnifica occurs on the tops and slopes of the Hamersley Range in the Pilbara biogeographic region where it grows on rocky slopes and hilltops; subspecies velutina occurs between Marandoo and Newman in the Gascoyne and Pilbara biogeographic regions where it grows on slopes and ephemeral creeks in loamy soils. Conservation status Eremophila magnifica is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife but subspecies magnifica is classified as \\"Priority Four\\" meaning that is rare or near threatened and subspecies velutina is classified as \\"Priority Three\\" meaning that it is poorly known and known from only a few locations but is not under imminent threat. Use in horticulture The highly-scented leaves and large, well-displayed flowers are attractive features of this eremophila. It can be propagated by grafting onto Myoporum rootstock and grown in well-drained soil in full sun. It is drought tolerant but very sensitive to frost and should be only lightly pruned.

She is best known as the founding benefactor of the Govett-Brewster Art Gallery. Early life Born on 10 February 1886 in New Plymouth, New Zealand, she was the youngest of four daughters. Her father was Clement Govett, barrister and founder of the Govett-Quilliam law firm. Her paternal grandfather was Henry Govett, vicar of St Mary's Church and first archdeacon of Taranaki. Her mother was Frances Elizabeth Atkinson. Brewster's maternal grandfather was Harry Atkinson, Premier of New Zealand for five terms during 1876 to 1891. She attended Wanganui Girls' College, and Chetwode School in New Plymouth. She married Rex Carrington Brewster at Wanganui on 21 September 1920. A doctor, he had served as a medical officer with the New Zealand Medical Corps in Palestine during World War I, and was awarded the Military Cross in February 1918. His grandfather was the surveyor Octavius Carrington, who was the brother of Frederic Carrington, regarded as the \\"father of New Plymouth\\". Career With a privileged background and as a major benefactor of her father's estate (her parents died in 1914 and 1918), Brewster had the means to pursue her interests in travel, the arts and culture. Brewster was active in the Taranaki Women's Club, established in 1926, becoming president in 1931. She was a representative on the National Council of Women and helped found the Pukeiti Rhododendron Trust. In 1939, in the months preceding World War II, Brewster and her friend, Elsie Andrews, courted controversy when they publicly declared that they were conscientious objectors. Rex Brewster died in 1952 and the couple did not have any children. In 1962, she transferred ¬£50,000 by trust deed to New Plymouth Council to establish an art gallery. The then-unused Regent cinema building in Queen Street was purchased and the Govett-Brewster Art Gallery was opened in 1970. Brewster later gifted $72,000 to create a collection. Brewster died of pneumonia on 13 December 1973, and her ashes were buried at Te Henui Cemetery.  Legacy  Govett-Brewster Art Gallery The Govett-Brewster Art Gallery continues as a successful and well-regarded contemporary art gallery. In 2015, a cafe at the Gallery was opened and named \\"Monica's Eatery\\" after Brewster.

Primus (1842‚Äì1916) was an African-American artist, known for his portrait painting. Biography Nelson Augustus Primus was born March 25, 1842 in Hartford, Connecticut. He was the only son of Mehitable (Jacobs), a dressmaker and Holdridge Primus, a grocery store clerk at R.S and G. Seyms Co. Mehitable was the granddaughter of Jeremiah Jacobs, the head of the first black family to settle in Hartford. Along with her dressmaking business, she managed an employment service, finding domestics and seamstresses for local employers. Primus's artistic talents were recognized early in his life. He won a drawing award twice at the Hartford County Fair, first when he was nine years old and the second time when he was seventeen. When he was fifteen, Primus was apprenticed to carriage painter, George Francis. Later, he studied art with Elizabeth Gilbert Jerome, a local portrait artist. On June 18, 1864, Primus married Amoretta Prime, of Norfolk, Connecticut. Their daughter Leila was born six months later, on December 22, 1864. In the spring of 1865, the family moved to Boston so that Primus could study art and find work as an artist. He first studied art with Edward Mitchell Bannister, a prominent African-American portrait painter and landscape artist. Primus stayed with Bannister only three months, as he felt the older artist was not interested in promoting the younger artist's work. He went on to study with lithographer, Charles Stetfield, who worked in the same building as Bannister. Stetfield was not as talented as Bannister, but he was a better teacher and mentor. Nelson worked part-time as a carriage painter, general painter, photo colorist, and waiter. He painted portraits when he was not working day-jobs, and often struggled to sell his work. His parents were supportive of Primus' aspirations and helped the family financially, often sending gifts of money or food. In July 1876, Primus' wife, Amoretta, died from complications of childbirth. He remarried Mary G. Wheeler of Nantucket, MA in 1877. In 1893, his daughter, Leila, died of pneumonia. In 1895, Primus and his wife Mary moved to the west coast, initially living in Seattle for a few years. Several portraits from that time period have been identified as Primus's work. The couple moved to San Francisco, California sometime around 1900, living near Chinatown. He worked at a delicatessen, and in his free time, he painted cityscapes, landscapes and portraits. While in San Francisco, he created Fortune Teller in 1898, A realistic portrayal of life in San Francisco in the late 1800s. Many of Primus's paintings were lost in the 1906 earthquake in San Francisco. By 1910, Primus's wife, Mary had died. Very little is known of his life after 1910. He died of tuberculosis on May 29, 1916 in a San Francisco hospital.

Topography The reserve covers mountains ranging from 1,800 meters in the river valleys to the highest point on Mt. Dykh-tau (5,204 meters). 60% of the reserve is alpine zone above the tree line. The territory consists of three ridges separated by deep valleys of Chegem River, the Cherek-Bezengi River, and Cherek-Balkaria River. The western-most ridge is called Kargashilsky ridge. Climate and Ecoregion Kabardino-Balkarski is located in the Caucasus mixed forests ecoregion. This ecoregion is located along the Caucasus Mountains between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. It has one of the highest levels of species endemism and diversity in the world: 23% of vascular species, and 10% of vertebrates. The climate of Kabardino-Balkarski is Humid continental climate, cool summer (K√∂ppen climate classification (Dfb)). This climate is characterized by large swings in temperature, both diurnally and seasonally, with mild summers and cold, snowy winters. The climatic effects in the reserve are highly affected by altitude: at 2,000 meters, the minimum temperature in January can reach -30 C degrees, while at 4,000 meters the minimum temperature might reach -50 C degrees. Flora and fauna The biodiversity of the plants is due to the wide range of altitude zones and the complexity of the terrain. In the nival zone, above 3,600 meters, there is no vegetation at all. In the sub-nival zone from 3,000 to 3,500 the sparse and non-continuous vegetation is that of tundra: lichens, creeping willow, saxifrage. From 2,300 meters to 3,000 meters is low-grass alpine meadows (up to 30 cm in height). The sub-alpine zone, 1,400 to 2,600 meters, is alpine meadows of hazel, alder, and rhododendron. From 1,000 to 2,400 meters is a forest belt of broad leaf trees to 1,600 meters and conifers above. Below 1,000 meters is pine, birch and oak forest. Kabardino-Balkarsky The representative mammal is the endangered West Caucasian tur. It is found in two separate sub-species in the Chegem and Bezengi gorges, representing the Western Caucasus and Dagestan. Brown bears are very common. Other common animals are fox, jackal, wild cat, martens, ermine, weasels, Altai squirrel, hare, and several species of rodents, shrews, and bats. The only fish found in the streams are brook trout. Ecotourism The Bezengi Wall seen from the Georgian side of the border. As a strict nature reserve, the Kabardino- Balkaria Reserve is mostly closed to the general public, although scientists and those with 'environmental education' purposes can make arrangements with park management for visits. There are several 'ecotourist' routes in the reserve, however, that are open to the public, but require permits to be obtained in advance. Three popular tourist routes are: * To the Bezengi Glacier. A high mountain path to the Bezengi Glacier (at 18 km long one of the longest glaciers in the Caucasus), with information placards along the way and an observation tower, past the Xu Chukhur waterfall and alpine shrub land. * Mijirghi. Three kilometer mountain path to a lake at the foot of the Miirghi Glacier. * Narzan Source. Hike through mountain forest to the source; see the flora and fauna of the Chegem forest and sample the natural mineral waters. The main office is in the city of Kashkhatau.

In 1929 he won the seat of Burke, replacing Darby Riordan who had resigned the seat to successfully contest the House of Representatives seat of Kennedy in the federal parliament. In 1932 Burke was abolished and for the next seven years he was an investigation officer with the Department of Labour and Industry. In 1939, the member for Charters Towers, William Wellington, died of pneumonia and Jones easily won the resulting by-election.

It has smooth, brownish bark, lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven and conical to cup-shaped fruit. Description Eucalyptus jimberlanica is a mallet or a tree that typically grows to a height of and does not form a lignotuber. It has smooth, glossy dark brown to copper-coloured bark on the trunk and branches. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, the same glossy green on both sides, narrow lance-shaped to lance-shaped, long and wide tapering to a petiole up to long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of seven on an thick, flattened, unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are oval to more or less spherical, long and wide with a hemispherical operculum that is about the same length as the floral cup. The fruit is a more or less sessile, woody, conical to cup-shaped capsule long and wide with the valves below rim level. This eucalypt is one of nine species of gimlet in the genus Eucalyptus. It is regarded by some as a possible hybrid between E. terebra and E. ravida. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus jimberlanica was first formally described by Lawrence Johnson and Kenneth Hill in 1991 and the description was published in the journal Telopea. The type specimen was collected from Jimberlana Hill, north east of Norseman by Hill, Johnson and Donald Frederick Blaxell in 1983. Distribution and habitat The Norseman gimlet is found on valley edges in a small area in the Goldfields-Esperance region of Western Australia near Norseman where it grows in loamy soils. Conservation status This eucalypt is classified as \\"Priority One\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that it is known from only one or a few locations which are potentially at risk.

Retrieved 14 February 2016. It was first opened in October 2013 in Dunedin as part of a project spearheaded by Abe Gray, former deputy leader of the Aotearoa Legalise Cannabis Party (ALCP), and Julian Crawford, former ALCP regional spokesperson. In 2019 Whakamana relocated to Shand's Emporium in Christchurch as a new project directed by Abe Gray and Cookie Time founder Michael Mayell. Following revenue issues and a failure to find suitable investors, the Christchurch location was closed. As of April 2020, Gray is attempting to establish a new site in central Wellington, the capital city of New Zealand. As a political hub which houses New Zealand's parliamentary buildings, Gray considers the location to be more effective in the lead-up to the referendum. Whakamana was designed to be a national information centre on aspects of the science, history, and legislation surrounding cannabis, with an aim to educate, particularly in the lead up to the 2020 New Zealand cannabis referendum. It operates within New Zealand's laws and does not sell cannabis. However, Whakamana previous stated they would setup a dispensary provided the law allows it to following the referendum. Under the direction of the 2019 project, Whakamana sought to establish itself as a social club, an authority for cannabis education and events (i.e. lectures by figures in the cannabis industry), and an alcohol- free music venue and eatery producing hemp-based foods. In late 2019, the museum attempted to raise funds via PledgeMe, a crowdfunding platform for New Zealand-based businesses, to help complete restoration of their new site. The campaign failed to raise its minimum target of $1 million NZD, therefore investors were refunded and the campaign was voided.  Early formation  leftOriginally located in Dunedin, the museum was first operated in the Legalise Cannabis House on David Street. The museum served as an information service to educate the public about all aspects of cannabis, including books that are unavailable at other libraries. In addition to acting as a museum and serving as a centre for drug law reform advocacy, the museum promoted open-source computer software. It also featured meeting rooms and a digital multimedia studio. The museum was opened in 2013 by Abe Gray, known for his cannabis activism as the former deputy leader of the Aotearoa Legalise Cannabis Party and leader of cannabis lobby group Otago NORML, and Julian Crawford, the former ALCP regional spokesperson.Chilton-Towle, J., \\"Dunedin marijuana museum planned\\", Otago Daily Times, 1 September 2013. Retrieved 14 February 2016. It was reportedly a venture between the ALCP and Otago NORML. Dunedin has had a long history of advocacy for marijuana law reform largely through the latter organisation. Gray, who is originally from the United States of America, has a Masters in Botany.Doyle, C., \\"\\", Critic (magazine), 17 September 2018. Retrieved 21 September 2018. He has spoken out about the discrimination of cannabis users and has been described as a lobbyist and an activist for cannabis. Gray publicly left his role as the president of the ALCP to support The Opportunities Party (TOP) in 2017, believing the organisation to be the most viable political platform to help effect cannabis law change at the time. Gray hoped that support from former ALCP voters would help TOP to enter parliament without requiring an electorate seat. Gareth Morgan, then the party leader, praised Gray for supporting the party's Real Deal Cannabis reform. In 2018 the museum left its original home in South Dunedin to occupy a new central city premises in the Eldon Chambers Building in Princes Street. During this time, comedian Guy Williams documented the museum in a segment for the comedy programme Jono and Ben. Gray stated that the presence of the museum in Dunedin would put it in the ideal position to become a centre for cannabis tourism should the drug ever be legalised in New Zealand, referencing the city's history of support for law change relating to drug use and possession. However, the museum moved again in 2019, this time to Christchurch; Gray had hoped to keep a branch of the museum running in Dunedin, but found the idea unsustainable due to a reliance on volunteers.  2019 Christchurch project  Mayell (left) and Gray speaking at the University of Canterbury, October 2019. In mid-2019 the museum left Dunedin and relocated to Christchurch. Gray teamed with Michael Mayell, a social entrepreneur and environmentalist known for founding the snack company Cookie Time. Mayell has an interest in the emerging hemp economy and argues that it could allow New Zealand to reduce its reliance on dairy farming. Shand's Emporium being restored next to Trinity Church in 2018. The museum was housed in Shand's Emporium building on Manchester Street in Christchurch, having been relocated from its original site in Hereford Street and adjoined to the neighbouring Trinity Church, with plans to restore the church as the central space for the museum. Both buildings are among the oldest in Christchurch and had required restoration following the 2011 Christchurch Earthquake. The organisation operated a Cannabis Social Club, which was New Zealand's only functioning club in 2019. In 2020 the club raised funds to move to an independent location with the help of Whakamana. Whakamana had intended to establish an education centre to provide public access to science, literature, and experiences to promote cannabis education. The museum held hosted events featuring notable individuals and experts on cannabis including activist and green fairy\\"Green fairy\\" is an informal term for someone who supplies medical cannabis product to people. Rose Renton. In May 2020, Mayell revealed that revenue issues had forced the museum to close its Christchurch location. Whakamana would move to Wellington in the form of a new project. The building remains in the hands of the Christchurch Heritage Trust. = Crowdfunding campaign = In a press release, Gray and Mayell announced plans to raise $1 million NZD via the crowdfunding platform PledgeMe to complete the church restoration and expand their services and resources, offering one share per dollar at a minimum of fifty shares.The campaign went live in late 2019. By the end of the fundraising period the campaign had raised $214,616 (NZD) from 299 people. However, the campaign had failed to raise its minimum target of $1 million NZD, therefore the total amount was returned to investors in accordance with the terms of PledgeMe. Gray initially attributed the failure of the campaign to a lack of awareness about the project among the local cannabis community, but argued in a later interview that prevailing cannabis stigma had played a role. Following the failure of the campaign, Gray and Mayell said they were approaching investors and seeking alternative means of funding, and would seek overseas investors if suitable New Zealand investors could not be found.  2020 Wellington project  In January 2020, Whakamana Museum posted on their Facebook page that they were seeking volunteers to set up a temporary pop-up museum in Wellington, intending to keep it running until the 2020 New Zealand cannabis referendum is resolved. Gray moved to Wellington to facilitate the project. Whakamana had planned to have a location setup in time for April, however this was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. After deciding it was untenable to continuing leasing the Manchester Street premises, Whakamana announced they would close their Christchurch premises permanently to focus resources on the Wellington project.

It lies between the vastus intermedius and the vastus lateralis. The structure has been previously reported but has not been described nor illustrated in any textbook. The term tensor vastus intermedius was given by Grob et al. in 2016.  Structure  The tensor vastus intermedius muscle originates from the proximal part of femur specifically from the anterior part of the greater trochanter. The muscle lies anterior to the vastus intermedius but deep to the rectus femoris. The tendinous part of the muscle is closely related to, and sometimes fuses with, the aponeurosis of the vastus intermedius. Distally, it joins the quadriceps tendon and inserts to the medial aspect of the patella. It is supplied by the femoral nerve and the lateral circumflex femoral artery. = Variations = This muscle is categorised into five types according to morphology: the independent type, VI-type, VL-type, common type and two-belly type. The independent type of the tensor vastus intermedius, also the most frequent type, has its tendon lying between the vastus intermedius and the vastus lateralis. For the VI-type and the VL-type, the tendinous part of the muscle is integrated into the fascia of the vastus intermedius and the vastus lateralis respectively. For the common type, it has a non-separable origin between the intertrochanteric line and greater trochanter. Two separate muscle bellies can be found for the two-belly types.  Functions  The tensor vastus intermedius muscle tenses on the aponeurosis of the vastus intermedius and also medialises the action of the muscle. It also acts as a second tensor in addition to the tensor fasciae latae. =Muscle Architecture= Recently, ultrasound studies have provided insight into the muscle architecture of this musculature and its long tendonSahinis C, Kellis E, Ellinoudis A, Dafkou K (2020) In Vivo Assessment of the Tensor Vastus Intermedius Cross-sectional Area Using Ultrasonography.

Retrieved February 16, 2016, from http://www.dsl.ac.uk/entry/snd/maud Description A maud is a rectangular, woollen blanket with fringed ends. It is characteristically woven in small checks of dark and light wool; for example, black, blue or dark brown, and white, cream or light grey. The most common pattern is often called shepherd's check but some mauds are woven in a houndstooth pattern. A maud also commonly has a border or inset border of the darker wool and between one and six bars of the darker wool at the ends. An analysis of various written and artistic works puts dimensions between 0.9m to 1.5m wide and between 2.5m and 3.5m long. While commercially-produced mauds are often of one piece, many older and home-produced mauds woven on smaller looms are of two narrow lengths sewn lengthwise together. When woven to be joined, each length has a border along only one length, as pictured above. Use =Traditional Use= The Craigy Bield by David Allan, 1786, showing shepherds of the Lothians in mauds. Statue of Robbie Burns, Dumfries, by Amelia Hill. The Rev. George Gunn provides an early reference of the maud as a shepherd‚Äôs garment. Drawing from barony records of Stichill, Roxburgh from 1655-1807, he said, ‚ÄúThe maud, or shepherd‚Äôs plaid, and the blue bonnet marked the peasant‚Äôs dress.‚Äù (p.10). Gunn, G. (1905). Records of the baron court of Stichill 1655-1807. Edinburgh: Scottish Historical Society. Supporting the maud being used by the common folk, whilst also noting it as a male garment, the Rev. Archibald Craig, writing in the New Statistical Account of Scotland for Roxburghshire, said, ‚ÄúThe dress of the peasantry is neat and becoming. The plaid or maud of the border, consisting of black and white, or blue and white checks, is almost universal among the men, and they arrange it with a good deal of taste.‚Äù (p. 292). Craig, A. (1837). Parish of Bedrule. New Statistical Account of Scotland (vol. 3). Edinburgh: Blackwood. A description of the appearance, age and use of the maud is best summed up by Walter Scott, when he wrote, ‚ÄúThe plaid was never in use among the Borderers, i.e. the Highland or tartan plaid; but there was, and is still used, a plaid with a very small cheque of black and grey, which we call a maud, and which, I believe, was very ancient; it is the constant dress of the shepherd, worn over one shoulder, and then drawn round the person, leaving one arm free.‚Äù (p.63). Scott, W. (1811). Mr Bird‚Äôs picture ‚Äì Chevy Chase. Blackwood‚Äôs Edinburgh magazine (vol. 33). Edinburgh: Blackwood. On another occasion he described the wearing of what must have been a longer maud, writing, ‚Äú‚Ä¶ a Maud or Low Country plaid. It is a long piece of cloth about a yard wide wrapped loosely round the waist like a scarf & from thence brought across the breast & the end thrown over the left shoulder where it hangs loose like a Spanish Cloak. It is not of Tartan but of the natural colour of the wool with a very small black check which gives it a greyish look ‚Ä¶ A broad belt about his waist is also part of his costume ‚Äì it served to retain one end of the Maud & occasionally to carry a large knife or dagger.‚Äù (p. 112). Letters of Sir Walter Scott, in Hill, R. J. (2013). Picturing Scotland through the Waverly novels. Farnham, UK: Ashgate. The maud was therefore the outer garment of the shepherd or common man. It provided warmth amongst the Border hills, protection from the rain and was his blanket at night. The voluminous nature of the wrapped maud also meant that pockets or nooks, known as ‚Äòmaud neuks/nuiks‚Äô, could be fashioned for the carrying of ‚Äòfairns‚Äô (food), other provisions and even lambs.Maud. Retrieved February 16, 2016, from http://www.dsl.ac.uk/entry/snd/maud The method of carrying the maud was dictated by its size and possibly local custom. A Cumberland Shepherd, painted by Joshua Cristall in 1816 shows a short maud carried wrapped around the waist. The Shepherd's Sweetheart by Thomas Brooks (1846) and The Craigy Bield, above, show a medium-length maud carried over the left shoulder and tied in a half-knot at the right hip. Scott's first description, above, and many portraits and statues of Scott, James Hogg and Robbie Burns, show a long maud draped over the left shoulder, brought diagonally around the body and passed over the left shoulder, with both ends reaching about waist height. In some pictures, the same length maud is wrapped in the same manner but over the right arm, instead of under, to form a sort of mantle. Scott's second description, above, describes the carrying of a long maud, wrapped around the waist and passed diagonally over the chest to fall behind the left shoulder. =Popular Use= James Hogg wearing a maud, by Sir John Watson Gordon, 1830. The maud gained popularity as a symbol of the Scottish Borders from 1820 due to its mention by fashionable Border Scots such as Walter Scott, James Hogg and Henry Scott Riddell and their wearing of it in public.Moffat, A. (2015). Scotland: A history from the earliest times. Edinburgh: Birlinn. Together with Robbie Burns, they can be seen wearing a maud in portraits, etchings and statues. This romantic revival may have prolonged the use of the maud and saved it from extinction; writing in 1808, Allan Ramsay said, \\"The wide great- coat, and the round hat, are, frequently, adopted for the grey checked plaid or mawd, and the broad blue bonnet with its scarlet rim;\\" (p. 396). Ramsay, A. (1808). The gentle shepherd; A pastoral comedy. Edinburgh: Abernathy & Walker. =Modern Use= It would seem that use of the maud on the Borders fell away towards the end of the 19th century and today, early mauds are relatively rare. One possible explanation is that England‚Äôs Burying in Woollen Acts 1666-80 required the dead to be shrouded and buried in pure English wool. The Acts were in force until 1814 so rural folk being buried in their mauds may have accounted for many disappearing. Two more likely explanations were that mauds, as working garments, simply wore out; and that 19th century changes in fashion rendered the maud obsolete in favour of coats and then jumpers. In either case, old and un-needed mauds were probably thrown out. In more recent decades, mauds have seen a modest revival as a part of Border Scots and Northern English traditional dress. The maud is often worn by Northumbrian pipers, and many Borderers choose to wear trews in their clan tartan rather than the Highland kilt, and some of these will pair their tartan trews with a checkered maud. The Littles of the Border. VHS. (1998). Carlisle: Border Heritage. A very few others may be seen at gatherings wearing a maud with Western clothes. In any case, to the discerning observer, the maud is as much an item of cultural identity as is the kilt. Few mills now weave mauds in the Border region. One has produced mauds in non-traditional and fashionable colours (such as light and dark orange, jade and red) in an attempt to attract modern buyers whilst another has positioned their product as a traditional Northumbrian collectable.

Biotechnology Fundamentals; CRC Press; Boca Raton, 2011 Like many other forms of nanoparticles, a copper nanoparticle can be formed by natural processes or through chemical synthesis. These nanoparticles are of particular interest due to their historical application as coloring agents and their modern-day biomedical ones.  Historical uses  Figure 1: The luster effect is caused by interference effects of light reflecting off two layers of copper nanoparticles in the pottery's glaze. One of the earliest uses of copper nanoparticles was to color glass and ceramics during the ninth century in Mesopotamia. This was done by creating a glaze with copper and silver salts and applying it to clay pottery. When the pottery was baked at high temperatures in reducing conditions, the metal ions migrated to the outer part of the glaze and were reduced to metals. The end result was a double layer of metal nanoparticles with a small amount of glaze in between them. When the finished pottery was exposed to light, the light would penetrate and reflect off the first layer. The light penetrating the first layer would reflect off the second layer of nanoparticles and cause interference effects with light reflecting off the first layer, creating a luster effect that results from both constructive and destructive interference.  Synthesis  Figure 2: One method of synthesizing copper nanoparticles involves the copper (II) hydrazine carboxylate salt which undergoes a radical reaction with radical hydrogen produced by ultrasounds to form nanoparticles, hydrogen peroxide, and hydrazine carboxylic acid. Various methods have been described to chemically synthesize copper nanoparticles. An older method involves the reduction of copper hydrazine carboxylate in an aqueous solution using reflux or by heating through ultrasound under an inert argon atmosphere. This results in a combination of copper oxide and pure copper nanoparticle clusters, depending on the method used. A more modern synthesis utilizes copper chloride in a room temperature reaction with sodium citrate or myristic acid in an aqueous solution containing sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate to obtain a pure copper nanoparticle powder. While these syntheses generate fairly consistent copper nanoparticles, the possibility of controlling the sizes and shapes of copper nanoparticles has also been reported. The reduction of copper(II) acetylacetonate in organic solvent with oleyl amine and oleic acid causes the formation of rod and cube-shaped nanoparticles while variations in reaction temperature affect the size of the synthesized particles. Another method of synthesis involves using copper (II) hydrazine carboxylate salt with ultrasound or heat in water to generate a radical reaction, as shown in the figure to the right. Copper nanoparticles can also be synthesized using green chemistry to reduce the environmental impact of the reaction. Copper chloride can be reduced using only L-ascorbic acid in a heated aqueous solution to produce stable copper nanoparticles.  Characteristics  Copper nanoparticles display unique characteristics including catalytic and antifungal/antibacterial activities that are not observed in commercial copper. First of all, copper nanoparticles demonstrate a very strong catalytic activity, a property that can be attributed to their large catalytic surface area. With the small size and great porosity, the nanoparticles are able to achieve a higher reaction yield and a shorter reaction time when utilized as reagents in organic and organometallic synthesis. In fact, copper nanoparticles that are used in a condensation reaction of iodobenzene attained about 88% conversion to biphenyl, while the commercial copper exhibited only a conversion of 43%. Copper nanoparticles that are extremely small and have a high surface to volume ratio can also serve as antifungal/antibacterial agents. The antimicrobial activity is induced by their close interaction with microbial membranes and their metal ions released in solutions. As the nanoparticles oxidize slowly in solutions, cupric ions are released from them and they can create toxic hydroxyl free radicals when the lipid membrane is nearby. Then, the free radicals disassemble lipids in cell membranes through oxidation to degenerate the membranes. As a result, the intracellular substances seep out of cells through the destructed membranes; the cells are no longer able to sustain fundamental biochemical processes. In the end, all these alterations inside of the cell caused by the free radicals lead to cell death.  Applications  Copper nanoparticles with great catalytic activities can be applied to biosensors and electrochemical sensors. Redox reactions utilized in those sensors are generally irreversible and also require high overpotentials (more energy) to run. In fact, the nanoparticles have the ability to make the redox reactions reversible and to lower the overpotentials when applied to the sensors.234x234px One of the examples is a glucose sensor. With the use of copper nanoparticles, the sensor does not require any enzyme and therefore has no need to deal with enzyme degradation and denaturation. As described in Figure 3, depending on the level of glucose, the nanoparticles in the sensor diffract the incident light at a different angle. Consequently, the resulting diffracted light gives a different color based on the level of glucose. In fact, the nanoparticles enable the sensor to be more stable at high temperatures and varying pH, and more resistant to toxic chemicals. Moreover, using nanoparticles, native amino acids can be detected. A copper nanoparticle-plated screen-printed carbon electrode functions as a stable and effective sensing system for all 20 amino acid detection.

He was paid 400 zecchini by the Cardinal Cardinal Bernis for a canvas depicting Joshua commanding Sun to stand still. He painted for the churches of Purgatorio and Santa Lucia in Sciacca, Sicily. In 1766, he was called to paint frescoes for the royal court in Turin. He then returned to Rome, where he painted a fresco in the grand salon of the Villa Borghese. During 1775-1779, he painted a large ceiling fresco depicting Marcus Furius Camillus Fighting Brennus and his Gauls, while Romulus Entreats Jupiter to Help Rome.

(\\"Voluntary departure\\"); Hashish v. Gonzales, 442 F.3d 572, 577-78 (7th Cir. 2006); Matter of Arguelles, 22 I&N; Dec. 811 (BIA 1999) (en banc). There is a related process called voluntary return or, in more formal parlance, administrative voluntary departure. This refers to a case where an alien is stopped from entering at a land border (by United States Border Patrol) and agrees to voluntarily return instead of undergoing expedited removal. A key difference between voluntary departure and voluntary return is that in the case of voluntary return, the alien never enters the United States, and therefore accrues no unlawful presence. The time between the alien arriving at the port and agreeing to return voluntarily can vary between a few hours and a few days, and throughout that duration the alien is under the supervision of either U.S. Customs and Border Protection or the carrier. Nonetheless, a number of commentators use the term voluntary return to refer to both voluntary departure and voluntary return. To add to the confusion, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) uses the term \\"return\\" when reporting the number of voluntary departures. Voluntary departure should also not be confused with withdrawal of application for admission, that occurs when an Arriving Alien who would be denied entry at a port of entry or deferred inspection site is asked to withdraw his or her application instead of receiving an order of removal. The term voluntary departure is also used in immigration enforcement in other countries, such as the United Kingdom, with a broadly similar meaning. However, the precise meaning and details surrounding the term differ significantly by country. This page is specifically about voluntary departure in the United States context.  Types of voluntary departure  There are three stages at which voluntary departure may happen: * Voluntary departure while in removal proceedings prior to immigration court hearing. This requires the consent both of the alien and the ICE officer processing the alien. * Voluntary departure at the first appearance in court, i.e., during the Master Calendar Hearing. This requires the consent of the alien as well as the Immigration Judge (IJ). * Voluntary departure at the conclusion of the removal proceedings, after the alien has been found removable from the United States. This requires the consent of both the alien and the IJ, and the alien needs to satisfy more requirements to be allowed to depart voluntarily at this stage. In addition, it is possible for an alien to proactively contact the ICE office and request voluntary departure despite not currently being in removal proceedings. As in the other cases, the ICE may not grant the voluntary departure request and may instead put the alien in removal proceedings. This option is therefore rarely used, but it can help aliens who wish to leave the United States after a brief unauthorized entry establish more clearly the duration of their stay, and make for a more transparent immigration record for the future. = Voluntary departure while in removal proceedings prior to the hearing = This form of voluntary departure is used after the alien has been given a Notice to Appear (NTA) for removal proceedings, along with a list of charges against the alien. At this point, the responsibility for the alien falls with the ICE. In some cases, the ICE may detain the alien at a detention center. In other cases, the alien may be free on parole but still required to show up for the court hearing. The ICE may, in its discretion, offer the alien the option of voluntary departure. From the perspective of ICE, the reasons for offering this option could include: * Reducing the backlog of immigration cases * Cutting down on the costs of detaining or monitoring aliens waiting for their hearing From the perspective of the alien, the main reason to accept voluntary departure is: * It does not carry with it the penalties associated with a removal order. * It allows the alien to reunite with family and avoid the perils of being detained and in unlawful status. * It prevents the alien from accumulating additional days of unlawful presence. However, it is important to note that if an alien voluntarily departs at this stage, unlawful presence accrued up to that point is part of the alien's immigration record, and may create bars to re-entry depending on the length of unlawful presence. In particular, if the alien believes that his or her presence was not unlawful, or the alien believes that he or she may be eligible for some relief from removal (such as cancellation of removal or asylum) or may be eligible for Adjustment of Status despite unlawful presence (for instance, through the Legal Immigration Family Equity Act), then voluntary departure could be a bad choice from the alien's perspective. This is because these forms of relief or adjustment of status are only available if the alien is physically present in the United States. Another option offered to some aliens, that is sometimes confused with voluntary departure, is stipulated removal. Stipulated removal means that the alien is removed prior to the hearing, and requires the consent of both the alien and the Immigration Judge. However, unlike voluntary departure, stipulated removal carries with it all the penalties associated with a removal order, including a five-year re-entry bar and the possibility of reinstatement of removal upon subsequent re-entry. = Voluntary departure during the Master Calendar Hearing = During the Master Calendar Hearing (the first day of the alien's appearance before the IJ) the alien may request to depart voluntarily. The Immigration Judge can decide whether to grant this request. As part of the request for voluntary departure, the alien concedes removability. = Voluntary departure at the conclusion of court proceedings = Here, the IJ allows the alien to depart voluntarily after concluding, at the end of the court proceedings, that the alien is indeed removable. This form of voluntary departure is the hardest to obtain. In order to be eligible for this, the alien must: * have been present in the U.S. for at least one year * produce the required travel documents * show the financial means to depart * have been a person of good moral character for the previous five years, and * post a bond in an amount set by the immigration judge.  Steps  = The alien and the authorities agree that the alien will depart voluntarily = The original suggestion for voluntary departure may come from the authorities or from the alien. Either way, both the alien and the authorities must agree to the voluntary departure. The order of voluntary departure has a date that may be determined flexibly based on the alien's request (but a maximum of 120 days after the date that the order is issued), giving the alien enough time to arrange his or her affairs prior to departing the United States. = The alien departs the United States = The alien must depart the United States by the date stated on the order of voluntary departure. = Failure to depart the United States has significant consequences for the alien = If the alien fails to depart on time, the following happen: * The alien might have to pay a civil penalty between $1,000 and $5,000. * The order of voluntary departure automatically becomes an order of removal, and may be executed as such by ICE. In particular, there is no scope for the alien to request removal proceedings. * Ten-year bar to immigration relief, even, for instance, in cases where the Legal Immigration Family Equity Act would otherwise apply. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 eliminated some exceptional circumstances where the penalties were waived. The only permissible exceptions are where the alien was not properly notified of the voluntary departure order.  History  = Prior to the IIRIRA = Voluntary departure began as an administrative process and was incorporated into the statutes in 1940. The 1940 statute provided for voluntary departure before removal proceedings in lieu of deportation to any alien \\"who has proved good moral character for the preceding five years.\\" The alien could then \\"depart the United States to any country of his choice at his own expense.\\" The Attorney General was granted the right to deny such relief to any individual whom the Attorney General reasonably believed fell into statutorily specified categories, including drug dealers, document falsifiers, subversives, criminals, and participants in Nazi persecutions. The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 additionally precluded the grant of voluntary departure to an alien convicted of an aggravated felony. Voluntary departure orders had a set date and most of them stated that, if the alien did not depart by the set date, the order would become a deportation order. The Immigration Act of 1990 amended the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 to indicate that anybody who failed to depart by the date specified on the voluntary departure order would be ineligible for discretionary forms of relief such as voluntary departure, suspension of deportation (that would later be called cancellation of removal), Adjustment of status, registry, and change of nonimmigrant status for 5 years after the scheduled date of departure or the date of unlawful entry. = Changes with the IIRIRA = The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 imposed dramatic restrictions on voluntary departure. This included the addition of civil penalties for failure to depart voluntarily, an increase in the ineligibility period for various forms of relief from 5 to 10 years, and a removal of various exceptional circumstances. = Substitution away from voluntary departure towards removal = In the mid-2000s, the United States, under President George W. Bush and U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff, made a number of changes to ramp up immigration enforcement. Examples of this ramp-up included completing the rollout of expedited removal to the entire border zone, phasing out catch and release, and starting Operation Streamline for criminal prosecution of repeat unlawful entrants and unlawful entrants with criminal backgrounds. These changes were continued by the next President, Barack Obama, with the support of DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement director John T. Morton. A consequence of these change was an increasing degree of substitution away from voluntary departure and towards various forms of removal (included expedited removal and stipulated removal). Due to these changes, the total number of people who were subject to removal from the United States increased significantly, while the number of people \\"returned\\" (which includes voluntary departure) decreased; the total of the number of people removed and returned appears to have fallen since the recession of 2008.  Reception  = Reception of the existence of voluntary departure as an option = Voluntary departure as an option is highlighted by sources of legal advice as a better option than being removed. Commentators have pointed out that voluntary departure is not really voluntary and that in some cases it can be a bad option to exercise. = Reception of the decrease in use of voluntary departure = Groups supportive of greater rights for immigrants and expanded opportunities for immigration have been critical of the move away from voluntary departure and towards the use of removal. Correspondingly, groups interested in combating illegal immigration welcome the shift away from voluntary departure towards removal orders. = Effect on the interpretation of deportation statistics = Groups supportive of greater rights for immigrants have viewed the increase in removals since the mid-2000s, that started under Bush and continued under Obama, as problematic, even though the total of removals and returns declined. The reasoning is that an order of removal carries significantly greater penalties than a voluntary departure. On the other hand, groups interested in combating illegal immigration, while supportive of the shift away from voluntary departures to removals, have been critical of looking only at the increase in removal numbers rather than looking at the total of removals and returns, arguing that the sharp increase in removal numbers overestimates the increase in immigration enforcement under Obama.

The spring is a rare variety known as an ebb-and-flow spring, and its output varies rhythmically and independently of external moisture conditions. Hydrologists with the Missouri Geological Survey measured the spring's flow in 1963 through 1965 and determined its flow to be at between 6,000 and 258,000 gallons per day. Six men from Jackson, Missouri incorporated a company on September 29, 1905 to establish a mineral bath spa with the intention that the resort might one day become as famous as Hot Springs, Arkansas. They purchased 147 acres and hired civil engineer J.W. Bain to lay the tract into lots. The resort faced financial difficulties within a few years of opening and the account book for the hotel showed operations were in the red despite respectable occupancy.

The radically styled fiberglass concept, designed to resemble a rocket on wheels, was revised several times and displayed at various other auto shows, most notably at the 1957 Paris Motor Show where it generated much fanfare, 18 months after it was first revealed. The car was featured in the promotional short film Design for Dreaming along with the rest of the 1956 General Motors lineup.  Overview  = Exterior = Similar to other Space Age show cars, the Golden Rocket was heavily influenced by the themes of aviation and space exploration. Its sleek, aerodynamic body was made entirely of lightweight fiberglass and finished in metallic bronze paint. Bullet-shaped chrome pieces resembling Dagmar bumpers were integrated into the front fenders in place of headlights as well as the sweeping rear fenders, giving the car an overall rocket-like appearance. Other notable features include a swept-back wrap-around windshield, which had already become a common design element by the mid-1950s, less prominent tailfins by contemporary standards and a split-window fastback roof design presaging the 1963 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray. It rode on unique \\"dotted- line\\" whitewall tires. A later photo taken inside the GM Design Center in Warren, Michigan shows the car sporting a blue paint scheme. = Interior = The leather upholstery was finished in blue and gold. When a door was opened, the two-piece roof panel rose automatically in a similar manner to the Mercedes-Benz 300 SL's gull-wing doors. The seats were raised up by three inches and swiveled outwards by 45 degrees, enabling easier access to the passenger compartment. One of its most pioneering innovations was the button- controlled tilt steering wheel, making it one of the first vehicles with such a feature. The speedometer was placed at the center of the foldable two-spoke steering wheel. The futuristic center console and control levers were inspired by an aircraft cockpit. = Powertrain = The car was powered by an upgraded 324-cubic inch Rocket V8 engine tuned to produce . According to interior photos, the Golden Rocket had an automatic transmission like all other Motorama show cars. Details on other internal components, however, are unavailable. = Design legacy = Early pre-production prototype of the 1958 Chevrolet Corvette An early styling mock-up of the 1958 Chevrolet Corvette, built around 1956, depicted a fixed-roof fastback coupe with a rear design taken almost directly from the Golden Rocket show car, right down to the torpedo-shaped rear fenders and subtle tail fins. However, this design proposal never reached beyond the clay model stage and a more conventional design was used on the production model instead. Seven years later, under the direction of General Motors head of design Bill Mitchell, the split rear window design would reappear on the 1963 Corvette Stingray coupe. It lasted for one model year before being changed to a single-piece rear window due to a problem of poor rear visibility.  Current status  It is unclear if the Golden Rocket still exists today. A common practice of General Motors in the 1950s was to destroy show cars after they fell out of usage in order to avoid liability concerns; however, the Golden Rocket is still unaccounted for with no confirmation it was crushed. There is photographic evidence that the car still existed as late as 1962, while several other show cars were scrapped earlier in 1959. The car was reportedly located somewhere in New Jersey, however the rumor still remains unconfirmed even after extensive investigation. Motorama historian David W. Temple believes that the Golden Rocket, along with other lost show cars, will likely never resurface again.

Its headquarters are on the campus of the University of the West Indies (UWI), at St. Augustine in Trinidad and Tobago and it also has national offices throughout the region. History CARDI‚Äôs roots are to be found in the Imperial College of Tropical Agriculture (ICTA), run by the British in Trinidad. In 1955 a Regional Research Centre (RRC) was established as part of ICTA. With withdrawal of British funding foreseen in the late-1960s, RRC‚Äôs staff was transferred to the Faculty of Agriculture of UWI. The RRC had become particularly known for carrying out soil surveys and for the production of soil maps of Caribbean countries, as well as for research on traditional food crops and on pests, diseases and weed management. Within the context of the Treaty of Chaguaramas, which promoted regional cooperation, the region‚Äôs Heads of Government appointed a team to examine both RRC and regional agricultural research in general. This concluded that RRC should be replaced by a new regional organization that would be independent of UWI and be responsible to the CARICOM Standing Committee of Ministers of Agriculture. Following acceptance of these recommendations CARDI was established in 1975. At its inception, 12 CARICOM member countries signed the agreement to establish CARDI: Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Montserrat, St Kitts‚ÄìNevis, St Lucia, St Vincent and the Grenadines and Trinidad and Tobago. These provide funds for the Institute‚Äôs core budget, while funding for projects comes from donor agencies. Activities CARDI is charged with a wide range of development activities, in addition to the strengthening of regional collaboration for agricultural research. These include the upgrading of facilities for intra-regional agricultural trade and transport and the evaluation of investment opportunities, as well as the provision of market intelligence.

Biography Wexler grew up in Minneapolis, Minnesota and started playing at age five. He is a cousin of singer-songwriter Peter Himmelman. Archived at rubyharrismusic.com. In 1975, Wexler became one of the founding members of the Diaspora Yeshiva Band, along with Avraham Rosenblum, Ben Zion Solomon, Simcha Abramson, Ruby Harris, and Gedalia Goldstein. The group, which played rock and bluegrass with Jewish lyrics, was highly influential in Jewish music and released six albums before disbanding in 1983. Wexler was an associate of Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach, performing on several albums in the 1980s and early 1990s. Shortly after Carlebach's death in 1994, Wexler and fellow Carlebach devotee Yehuda Katz co-formed the band Reva L'Sheva. Combining a Carlebach influence with a jam band rock sound, the band was a forebearer of the post- Carlebach Jewish rock scene, preceding bands like Moshav, Soulfarm, and Blue Fringe. The band released six studio albums before disbanding in 2004. In 2005, Wexler released his debut solo album, A Million Voices. Child molestation case On December 23, 2004, Wexler was indicted and later jailed on charges he had sexually abused an eight-year-old girl in his neighborhood. The charges, most of which Wexler admitted to, included three instances of \\"rape, indecent acts, and indecent assaults\\" committed between 1994 and 1996.

Background Solomon graduated from Berklee College of Music, where he studied music history. While living in San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury neighborhood in the early 1970s, Solomon attended gatherings at The House of Love and Prayer. There, he met the shul's founder, Rabbbi Shlomo Carlebach, who convinced him to move to Israel.

He is the 2011 winner of the Zindagi Live National Award given by IBN-7. The 2015 Indian biographical Hindi film Laxman Gole is based on Gole's life and his journey. The film is written and directed by Faisal Hashmi.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1zTYboIYOohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D2Q-SIw358https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6458294 He is the subject of a documentary film by award-winning documentary filmmaker Madhavi Tangella. Prayaschit, Gunahon Ke Zakhm, a TV show on Sony Entertainment Television, hosted by Tisca Chopra had an episode based on his life.  Conflict with the law  The time Gole spent in jail gave him a bad reputation and brought him in contact with criminals. He said, \\"To some extent I blame the police for making me a criminal.\\" He spent over seven years in jail as an undertrial and prisoner for assault, attempt to murder and extortion, with 19 cases filed against him.  Encounter with Gandhi's philosophy  While being held in Nashik jail under Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act Gole came across Gandhi's autobiography: The Story of My Experiments with Truth. (A story in The Telegraph compares this with the incident in the film Lage Raho Munna Bhai in which Gandhi \\"appears\\" to the protagonist of the film, Munna Bhai.) Reading the book made Gole realise the fruitlessness of violence, falsity, crime and hatred. He was impressed by Gandhi's courage in coming to terms with his mistakes and seeking forgiveness for them, to get on with life. Gole decided to plead guilty to the charges laid against him. He wrote a letter to the judge sitting over his case admitting the charges against him and expressed regret for them. The judge warned him that doing so could result in him being sent to prison for seven years, but Gole declared that he was prepared to bear whatever punishment he deserved. Gole also wrote letters to those he had hurt ‚Äî apologising to them. Impressed by Gole's admission of his guilt and his desire for atoning for his wrongdoings, the judge gave him a sentence reduced to half. He was acquitted in 18 cases, sentenced for four years in one case and for two months in another. This sentence, too, was reduced to two years.  After release from jail  After release from Nasik jail, Gole began working for the Bombay Sarvodaya Mandal, lecturing on Gandhian philosophy in Indian jails including Tihar jail. He has trained in computers and runs his own NGO: Saksham Peace Soundation.  Personal life  Gole under the influence of Gandhian philosophy gave up consuming meat and alcohol. He is married and has two children.  Popular culture  =Biographical film= The 2015 Indian biographical Hindi film Laxman Gole is based on Gole's life and his journey.

The film premiered at South by Southwest on March 11, 2016 and was released to theaters on December 2, 2016. Production It was announced in August 2015 that filming had begun with actors Dominic Monaghan, Ksenia Solo, Jennette McCurdy, and Nathan Parsons. Plot Seth is a severely introverted man who works at an Animal Control department. He has developed an obsession with Holly, a waitress and former high school classmate of his he saw writing in her journal on the bus. Seth asks security guard Nate for advice, and Nate tells him to be confident and approach her. Seth extensively researches her online profiles for information and tries to ask her out, but she rebuffs him. At home, Holly talks about the encounter with her friend Claire, and takes a drunken phone call from her ex- boyfriend Eric, who cheated on her. Holly receives a large bouquet of roses at work the next day, and assuming they are from Eric, goes to visit the bar where he works. Seth, who has been following her, confronts her, leading to a physical confrontation when he refuses to accept her rejection. Eric beats Seth up, but Seth is able to steal Holly's journal. He spends the next several days reading every detail. As his performance slips at work, Seth discovers a trapdoor to a room in an abandoned wing of the animal shelter, where he sets about constructing a steel cage. He follows Holly home, breaks into her apartment, and kidnaps her. After she awakens in the cage, Holly vows to survive, speaking to an image of Claire. Seth informs Holly that he loves her and has imprisoned her to \\"save\\" her. He says he has heard her talking in both her own and Claire's voices in the past. He reveals that he knows the truth about her: Holly discovered that Eric had slept with Claire, and confronted her about it during a car ride. An angry Holly continued accelerating the car until they were hit by a truck. Although injured, Claire was alive until Holly stabbed her with a glass shard; Claire's death was attributed to the crash. Since then, Holly has committed a series of gruesome murders and written about them in her journal. When Seth realized the stories were real, he formulated a plan to save Holly to prevent her from hurting anyone else, claiming that he finally felt a purpose in life. Over the next several days, they engage in psychological mind games against each other as Holly begins to slip details to draw Seth in. Seth maintains that Holly committed the other murders from guilt of not being caught over Claire, but Holly counters that she kills simply because she enjoys it. A suspicious Nate follows Seth and discovers Holly. She deliberately distracts Nate so that Seth has time to overpower him. At Holly's urging, he smashes Nate's skull with a cinder block, then follows her instructions to dispose of the body. The police become suspicious of Seth's role in Nate's disappearance. Holly convinces him that he can save her if he proves his love to her by cutting off his finger. He does, but this leads to Holly grabbing his knife and threatening to kill herself if he doesn't release her. She says she finally believes that he loves her before slitting his throat. Some time later, Holly is back together with Eric, and the \\"fictional\\" events from her journal are being published by a vanity press. Holly finds evidence that Eric has been cheating again, but declines to hurt him. Instead, she travels to a warehouse, where it is revealed that Seth is being kept in a cage, still alive but horribly mutilated and tortured; she thanks him for \\"saving\\" her by allowing her to take out her murderous impulses on him instead.

Release Pet was released to 9 theaters on December 2, 2016 with total gross of $8,004 since then. Reception Reviews for Pet have been mixed, with critics alternatively praising the subversive themes and strong leading performances, or lamenting the implausible twists. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 56% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 18 reviews, with an average rating of 5.16/10. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 48 out of 100 based on 8 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Reviews that have criticized the twists include Screen Anarchy, which wrote \\"Without spoiling anything more, the twists push past the merely unlikely into a strange minefield of 'what in the world?'\\", and RogerEbert.com, which noted \\"The rank, idiotic implausibilities continue to mount...\\" The Hollywood Reporter gave the bottom line of \\"This graphically violent horror thriller features too many plot twists for its own good\\", but the review has also words of praise for the direction and cast: \\"Still, the film is engrossing, thanks to the director‚Äôs skill at delivering sustained tension, and the excellent performances.\\" An entirely positive review came from The A.V. Club's Alex McCown, who stated: \\"Part of the wicked fun of Pet, a dark little exercise in sadism and black humor, is how it upends the traditional conventions of the 'wronged woman turns the tables on her abuser' narrative. (...) The films zigs where you expect a depraved zag, resulting in a smart and unsettling tale.\\" Another overall positive review has been given by Katie Walsh of Los Angeles Times, who wrote: \\"The constant power flipping allows for some interesting explorations of both the misogyny and misandry demonstrated by the main characters, and the way they justify their actions through the philosophical lens of love and sacrifice. 'Pet' is a modern-day fable of unchecked desire that descends quickly into a bloody, morbid cautionary tale.\\" References External links  Category:2016 films Category:2016 horror films Category:2016 horror thriller films Category:2016 crime thriller films Category:2016 psychological thriller films Category:American films Category:Spanish films Category:American independent films Category:Spanish independent films Category:American psychological thriller films Category:Spanish thriller films Category:English-language films Category:Films scored by Zacar√≠as M. de la Riva Category:2016 independent films ","title":"Pet (film)"},{"id":"49423631","text":"Catoryctis polysticha is a moth in the family Xyloryctidae.

Due to its natural water resistance, teak is sought out for a variety of uses including furniture-making and shipbuilding.‚ÄúTectona Grandis\\" in Teak grows throughout much of Burma, but was first exploited in the Tenasserim (now Tanintharyi) region in the southeast of Burma on the Malay Peninsula Bryant, 1997, p. 23 Though it has long been used by locals, teak has been important to the economy of Myanmar since British Colonization and remains a political issue today. Leaves of Tectona grandis Ecology Teak is indigenous to much of Myanmar, Laos, Thailand and parts of India. In Myanmar, it is naturally found in areas between the 25¬∞30'N and 10¬∞N lines of latitude. Teak mostly grows in hilly areas below 900 meters in elevation. Within the country, teak is most common in mixed deciduous forests as well as evergreen and semi evergreen forests.Gyi and Tint, 1995 In the south of Myanmar, major teak forests existed in the Pegu and Tenasserim Hills. Other notable areas of teak growth include the Arakan Mountains in the west of the country and the Shan Hills in the East. While teak is still abundant in many of these locations, native forests have been significantly threatened in the late twentieth century. In the 1990s, the Myanmar state attempted to increase revenue by cutting more teak. This uptick in logging increased deforestation throughout the country, of which the Pegu Hills were particularly affected.Mon, 2012, p. 190‚Äì98, 191 History =Beginning of Colonial Rule= In the nineteenth century, the British Empire was the largest naval power in the world. As such, they were in constant need of shipbuilding supplies, including teak. After its victory in the First Anglo-Burmese War in 1826, Britain found in its newly conquered Burmese territory an ample source of teak. Bryant, 1997, p. 23 Extracting this resource, however, proved a puzzle. Though the British Government had initially held a monopoly over all Burmese teak, in 1829 it chose to open it up to private industry. This move was supposedly made to ensure the harvest and sale of sufficient wood, but in reality was a surrender by the government to well-connected timber merchants. Bryant, 1997, p. 24 Entrepreneurs of all types flocked to Tenasserim to make their fortunes from teak. The government imposed few rules on these loggers and by 1841 they had exhausted the majority of teak stocks in the region. In response to this over-harvesting, the colonial rulers of Burma chose to take more direct control of teak exploitation. The British colonial government would not take a laissez faire, hands off approach to teak management again. =Reforming Teak Exploitation= In 1841 the first Superintendent of Forests for Tenasserim was appointed.Bryant, 1997, p. 33 This appointment represented a change from indiscriminate to considered teak exploitation in Burma. Other areas with major teak stocks, such as the Pegu (now Bago) Hills, were placed under the control of the British Government.Bryant, 1997, p. 37 However, even though, on paper, the British government owned the land the teak was situated on, it did not necessarily control it. Taking control of this land conveniently dovetailed with a particular method of teak cultivation. This method was shifting cultivation or taungya.Bryant, 1994, p. 225‚Äì50, 227 Taungya is the practice of removing the teak from stretches of forest, burning the remainder, planting teak and other crops in their place and nurturing both together until the teak is mature enough to grow on its own, at which point another section of forest can be started on.Bryant, 1994, p. 226 This practice meant that the laborers who planted teak and tended crops would be strongly tied to the British colonial authorities, from whom they received salaries. In addition to creating a British presence in the lives of locals, taungya was quickly taken up due to being cheaper than the creation of teak plantations.Bryant, 1994, p. 239 =Resistance by the Karen= Early efforts to introduce taungya to Burmese teak productions started in the Pegu Hills, between the Irrawaddy and Sittaung rivers in central Burma. The people that the British imagined would implement their taungya system of teak cultivation were ethnic Karens who had been residents of the region for generations without incorporation into the lowland Burman culture. Avoidance of the lowland has long been key to the identity and survival of the Karen people. Some, like the political scientist James C. Scott, argue that Karen civilization has been carefully organized with the goal of lessening the influence of the dominant empire of the time, be it Burmese or BritishScott, James C. The Art of Not Being Governed. Yale Agrarian Studies Series. New Haven & London: Yale University Press, 2009, 179 This tendency often meant that Karens choose to live in upland areas where they would be out of immediate reach of such states.Scott, 182 Given this heritage, many Karen living in the Pegu Hills were reluctant to integrate themselves into the taungya system that the British devised.Bryant, 1994, p. 232 In addition to opposing it for the political power it gave the British, they found the practice of a form of agriculture unpracticed by their fore- bearers culturally threatening.Bryant, 1994, p. 234 While the taungya system of simultaneously growing teak and other crops was espoused by the British, shifting cultivation was and has remained the norm in Burma. Due to its precolonial roots and perceived inefficiencies, it is often characterized as backwards. However, some scholars find this assessment to be flawed given the political independence that it gave to its practitioners Scott, 190, While the taungya system did entail shifting cultivation, it ran counter to the goals of the Karen. The initial steps of logging and burning meant the destruction of the native forest. The forest, along with the hills, naturally isolated the Karen from the rest of Burma. Taungya also meant that the British or their agents would return to the previously cut areas after some years to harvest the newly planted teak. This increased traffic through their territory would also impact their secluded status. Given their suspicion of the lowland states they were isolated from, the British included, the Karen were reluctant to lose this protection.Bryant, 1994, p. 232 =Implementation of Taungya= Because the Karen were more interested in maintaining their independence than uniting economically with the British, the implementation of Taungya required the use of force. The British government seized on the fact that the Karen had no legal title to the land that they occupied, and had occupied for generations.Bryant, 1994, p. 235 Teak tracts in the Pegu Hills were pronounced state property.Bryant, 1997, p. 37 The government also made it illegal to burn or damage teak trees within these forests. This law effectively criminalized traditional Karen agricultural practices. Due to the wide distribution of teak in the Pegu Hills, almost any location that a Karen farmer could choose to clear would contain some trees.Bryant, 1997, p. 69 The British government now found itself in a position to fine or prosecute most of the people living in the area. However, the new laws were difficult to enforce. Breakage was rampant and the British criminal justice system was underfunded and ineffectual.Bryant, 1997, p. 70 It took until 1869 for a concrete and successful push to implement taungya to be made. At this point, the colonial government, tired of Karen resistance, began to make deals with villages promising them plots of land for permanent cultivation in return for their labor in the taungya system.Bryant, 1994, p. 237 This arrangement was a major concession for Karen villagers as it entailed abandoning the shifting cultivation they had traditionally practiced. =Transition from to Taungya to the Myanmar Selection Systems= Almost directly on the heels of taungya came another form of teak exploitation. This system, which eventually came to be known as the Myanmar Selection System reduced the British Empire's dependency on the local Karen people. This method entails dividing an area of forest into thirty sections of roughly equal area, one of which is logged every thirty years.Hla Maung Thein, Kanzaki Mamoru, Fukushima Maki, and Yazar Minn. Structure and Composition of a Teak-Bearing Forest under the Myanmar Selection System: Impacts of Logging and Bamboo Flowering. Southeast Asian Studies 45, no. 3 (December 2007): 303‚Äì16, 304 However, to put this system into place, the colonial government needed greater control of the forest than the taungya system entailed. To do so, in 1870, the British government created the first enclosure that prevented natives from cutting teak and other woods.Bryant, 1997, p. 74 Without locals interfering with teak and other woods, the government was free to enact new forestry policies. By 1879 it had reserved 1,410 square miles of forest. Between the 1870s and the 1930s, the taungya system became less and less supported as a method for harvesting teak. In 1885, the British Empire won the Third Anglo-Burmese War and took control of Upper Burma. Control of this region gave the Empire access to an even larger supply of teak. However, taungya was not the most effective manner to exploit this newly acquired bounty. Most of Upper Burma was remote, and the British Forest Department did not have the resources to administer the taungya systems in the area. Instead the government selectively felled teak without the providing continuous employment for locals.Bryant, 1997, p. 113 Taungya also suffered in the Pugu Hills. As the British consolidated their control of Burma, they depended less and less on the cooperation of the Karen people to retain their power. Therefore, they were able offer less beneficial terms to taungya practitioners. Over time, this led to a decline in its use among Karen in the Pegu Hills.Bryant, 1997, p. 112 =Consequences for the Karen People= While the Karen people of the Pegu Hills had initially been unwilling to adopt the taungya system, increased enclosure and agreements with British Colonial authorities meant that by the 1890s most Karen had no choice but to adapt. These same people came to feel left in the lurch when the British Government began to shift its focus to cheaper and less labor-intensive methods of teak extraction in Upper Burma. Karen who had bought into the taungya system felt sold out when they could no longer count on the government to pay them for their compliance.Bryant, 1994, p. 247 Those who had avoided adopting the system and continued shifting cultivation found that most was either under permanent cultivation or taungya.Bryant, 1994, p. 248 These feelings were heightened when taungya was phased out in 1935.Bryant, 1997, p. 113 =Privatization of Teak Extraction= In the twentieth century, private enterprise, which had been discouraged since the disaster in the Tenasserim region, was allowed back into the teak trade. Several companies, of which the largest was the British Bombay Burmah Trading Corporation Limited leased teak forests from the British government and felled them using the Myanmar Selection System.Bryant, 1997, p. 99 These new companies cut teak at a much faster rate than the government had in the nineteenth century and sped up even more after World War I.Bryant, 1997, p. 103 Many European timber merchants were able to influence Forest Department policy, which left out native Burmans, who did not enjoy the same connections. The British Forest Department also preferentially awarded contracts to European traders and companies. This meant that most of the valuable teak leases in Burma were sold to outsiders.Bryant, 1997, p. 106 =Burmese People's Response= There was strong Burmese pushback against the international exploitation of teak and its negative effects on locals. This is evidenced by several failed attempts by Burmese politicians to change British forestry policy with respect to teak and other woods. One of the effects of the enclosure policies that the Forestry Department had adopted was that local villagers were no longer allowed to cut their own firewood for free, as they had for generations. Burmese nationalist politicians attempted to convince the colonial Legislative Council of Burma to expand local's rights to free forest products in 1926. This effort, however, was voted down.Bryant, 1997, p. 137 In 1937, under the Government of Burma Act, Burma was administratively separated from the colony of India. While this theoretically would give the Burmese people a greater ability to govern themselves, the powers they gained were limited Taylor, Robert H. The State in Myanmar. Honolulu: University of Hawai\`i Press, 2007, 70. Burmese did become more represented in the formally predominantly European Forest Service, making up about one quarter in 1942.Bryant, 1997, p. 144 Native Burmans took more control over the Forest Service during the Japanese occupation, as all British officials were forced to flee the country.Bryant, 1997, p. 146 =Independence= Since Burma received independence in 1948, teak has been a major economic resource for all of its governments. However, it took some time for the government to attain the kind of control of the teak trade that the British colonial state had. World War II and its aftermath left the new Burman government with little control over much of its territory, or forests. However, due to the lucrative nature of the teak trade, Prime Minister U Nu's Forestry Department resumed cutting teak as soon as practicable.Bryant, 1997, p. 158-159 =Socialist Rule and Nationalization= During the years of socialist rule in Burma, teak was an important part of the economy. Nationalization of timber in Burma led to the creation of a new State Timber Board, controlled by Ne Win, the Burman socialist head of state. While other industries declined during this period, the teak trade was one of the only major sources of funds for the government.Bryant, Raymond L. Burma and the Politics of Teak. In: A History of Natural Resources in Asia: The Wealth of Nature, edited by Greg Bankoff and Peter Boomgaard. Houndsmill, Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2007, 150 In the early 1980s one third of national export earnings came from teak.Perry, Peter John. Myanmar (Burma) since 1962: The Failure of Development. Aldershot, England: Ashegate, 2007, 82 To make up for decreased rice exports, the State Timber Board encouraged greatly increasing teak production.Bryant, 1997, p. 174 This new demand led to destructive extraction practices in easily accessible areas, like the southern Pegu hills.Bryant, 1997, p. 176 Burma became even more dependent on the teak trade after the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) (later known as the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC)) took power from Ne Win in 1988. In need of money to purchase military equipment in case of more uprisings like the one that led to deposition of Ne Win, the government had little choice but to cut more and more teak.Bryant, 1997, p. 178 The frequency of cutting within the Myanmar Selection System was increased and with it the rates of forest degradation and deforestation.Mon, 2012, p. 191 =Thai Logging Concessions and the KNU= Neighboring Thailand had been not regulated teak extraction as robustly as Burma or its British rulers, and by 1988 suffered from major deforestation. Thai timber companies no longer had sources of teak within their own country and needed new resources to exploit to stay viable.Bryant, 1997, p. 177 The state in Myanmar responded by selling them permission to log in territory controlled by the militant Karen National Union (KNU). The KNU was a longtime antagonist of the Myanma state that had been able to thrive due to its inaccessible location near the Thai border, as well as its connections to cross-border smuggling. The Thai logging and the infrastructure it would bring to the area considerably diminished the KNU's strategic advantage.Bryant, 1997, p. 178 In addition to weakening the KNU, Thai loggers also replicated the deforestation and ecological damage that they had wreaked in their own country. =Teak in the Twenty-First Century= The process of democratization in Myanmar has brought reforms to the logging industry as well. In an attempt to preserve existing forests from the rampant logging of the 1990s, the government banned the export of raw timber laws in 2014.Jared Ferrie, Myanmar's log export ban to hurt businessmen but help forests. Reuters, March 20, 2014, retrieved October 25, 2016. Being that the vast majority of teak from Myanmar was sold in this format, this action largely amounts to a ban on teak exports. However, even the ban has not been totally successful in preventing forest degradation. Illegal loggers, many of them Chinese, have continued to cut teak in remote areas of the Kachin State, near the Chinese border.Tom Phillips, Surge in Illegal Logging by Chinese in Myanmar Alarms Activists; Quantity of Illegal Timber Flowing into China Now close to Peak Level Hit a Decade Ago as Loggers Reach Deeper into Country‚Äôs Forests. The Guardian, September 17, 2015, retrieved October 25, 2016. The Myanma government has attempted to discourage this practice by meting out draconian punishments to captured loggers. In 2015, 153 Chinese loggers were given life sentences for illegal logging.Myanmar jails 153 Chinese illegal loggers for life. BBC, July 23, 2015, retrieved October 25, 2016.

Abby Wambach heads the ball during a match against England in February 2015. A header is a technique that is used in association football to control the ball using the head to pass, shoot or clear. This can be done by standing, jumping or diving position. Header is a common technique and is used by players in almost every match. In general, a forward uses a header to score a goal while a defender usually uses a header to prevent the scoring of a goal by the opponent. A header is the only option when the ball is in air, because of the rule that a player can‚Äôt make contact with the ball using their hands. Most header goals are scored as a result of a cross or a corner. The playmaker passes the ball across the goal in the air, and the attacking player (either standing, jumping or diving position) strikes the ball with his head. Footballers such as Marco van Basten, Fernando Torres, Cristiano Ronaldo, Andy Carroll, Harry Kane, Olivier Giroud, Gareth Bale, Javier Hernandez, Sergio Ramos, Peter Crouch, Giorgio Chiellini, Ali Daei and Abby Wambach are some examples of players who are notable for their quality headers.

The impetus for a dedicated skatepark came following the death of a skateboarder in Albany's main street in the mid-1970s. In 1975 a group of students from Albany Senior High School formed a committee with the idea of building a skatepark. The group started fundraising and soon accumulated 3,000. The Albany Town Council donated of land that was once a gravel quarry and donated 10,000 to the project. The track was opened in February 1976 by the American skateboarder Russ Howell. The run is made from concrete and is in length running downhill. The track is curved downward and lipped with a wall on first turn with lower rises on the next two turns and finishing with a drained bowl at the end.

Plot  A wanna be actress Julie (Raai) struggles through sleazy innuendos before caving in and getting embroiled in the shadowy world that purportedly finances the film industry. Her first love Mohit abandons her at the first sign of trouble while her second (Ravi Kisshen) uses her and moves on to his next conquest. The third one is Dubai Don Lala (Dev Gill) and her fourth a cricketer who thinks she won't suit the sati savitri image his parents expect of his bride. So that leaves Julie in a huddle and egged on by her woman Friday, Annie (Rati Agnihotri) she chooses Jesus ‚Äì only to be gunned down the day after her symbolic baptism. The rest of the film has a ferocious looking ACP Dev Dutt (Aditya Srivastava) trying to arrive at a decent enough reason for her murder. Of course, the power broker with CM aspirations and a dead wife who looks like Julie's doppelganger, may have something to do with it. https://www.freepressjournal.in/entertainment/julie-2-review-cast-story- director/1176213 Cast * Shakil Akhtar as Director Rohan * Raai Laxmi as Julie / Sumitra Devi * Gulshan Kumar nandani as Film Director Mohit * Dev Gill as Dubai Don Lala * Ravi Kishan as Ravi Kumar * Asad Raza Khan as Ambani * Aditya Srivastava as ACP Devdutt * Pankaj Tripathy * Rati Agnihotri * Yuri Suri Production Initially Paoli Dam was approached for the titular role after her success in Hate Story but she refused as she did not want to be stereotype.

It was declared a nature reserve in 1998 and is designated a Site of Local Conservation Interest. A wildlife corridor runs through the site. Owned by Newcastle City Council and managed by Urban Green Newcastle, it is often referred to as Havannah and Three Hills Nature Reserve, so called after the drift mine and the slag heaps, which were located at the site when Hazlerigg Colliery was operational, from 1892 to 1964. Location The site is an oblong area roughly east-west and north-south, with Hazlerigg forming the east boundary; Main Road the western boundary between it and the eastern extent of Newcastle Airport; and Coach Lane the northern boundary. A triangular extension of the site descends south to a point on the boundary with the Sage Group campus. Ecology It is one of only two areas of lowland heath in Newcastle. Much of the landscape is a result of the site's industrial past and many of the wet areas result from subsidence associated with mining activity. There is great biodiversity within the site, which has around 40 hectares of habitat including woodlands, meadows, scrub, grazed fields, marshland and ponds. Several smaller ponds have been added in recent years and the hydrology of the site has changed much due to subsidence associated with mining activity. The diverse range of habitat provides for populations of plants and animals of local, regional and national importance. The woodland consists of broadleaf and coniferous trees. An abundance of coniferous trees provides habitat for red squirrels, which are breeding successfully in the reserve. A section of land has been fenced off at the top of the Three Hills part of the reserve, to keep dogs and people separate from the squirrels' breeding area. Newcastle is one of the last urban areas with a population of red squirrels and Havannah Nature Reserve is one of only three places within the city area that supports them. The red squirrel is a legally protected species and is covered by Schedules 5 and 6 of the Wildlife & Countryside Act 1981. The other two sites that provide red squirrel habitat in Newcastle are Woolsington Woods and Gosforth Park Nature Reserve. In 2011, housing developer Bellway Homes submitted a planning application to North Tyneside Council for proposed development adjacent to Gosforth Park Nature Reserve, approximately 2 miles southeast of Havannah Nature Reserve. The local group Save Gosforth Wildlife campaigned against the plans, which did not go ahead and as a result there is a local precedent for concerns about housing developments adjacent to red squirrel habitat. In 2014, a planning application was submitted for a housing development at Woolsington, which will involve felling over 1,000 trees in Woolsington Woods, approximately 3 miles north of Havannah Nature Reserve. Havannah Nature Reserve also provides habitat for the Dingy Skipper butterfly, which is covered under section 41 (England) of the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act (2006) and on the UK list of Priority Habitats and Species. The ponds and ditches provide habitat for breeding populations of great crested newt, which is a European protected species. Yellowhammer birds, a species on the UK red list of Birds of Conservation Concern, can be seen and heard in the bushes and hedgerows around the scrubland within the reserve. Development proposal In 2015, the Banks Property Group developer submitted a planning application for permission to build up to 500 houses directly opposite Havannah Nature Reserve. Local wildlife conservation groups objected to the plans, including the Northumberland Wildlife Trust, the Natural History Society of Northumbria and the campaign groups Save Gosforth Wildlife and Save Newcastle Wildlife. In 2018, a large housing development is being built directly north of Havannah on the other side of Coach Lane, to be called Havannah Park.

The original location is in a renovated Bai style courtyard home, one of Xizhou's heritage sites protected at the national level. The site itself was first constructed in 1948 and has changed hands several times until Brian and Jeanee Linden began renovations in 2007. The hotel has one courtyard with facilities for public use like a library with a large collection of Chinese and English books and two private courtyards housing 14 guest rooms. History A businessman from Xizhou named Yang Pinxiang (Êù®ÂìÅÁõ∏) became very wealthy in the early 1900s from trading silk, tea, and dyes on the Tea Horse Road and built a luxurious home in eastern Xizhou. Mr. Yang was educated in Shanghai and incorporated styles from eastern China into his traditionally inspired Bai courtyard home, along with custom facades inspired by Xizhou artists who studied overseas. After the Communist Revolution in 1949, Mr. Yang's home was turned over for military use as a barracks for several years and housed over 100 soldiers. Decades later during the Cultural Revolution (1966 - 1976) the building was repurposed as a military hospital. Although many historical structures and homes of opulence in China suffered devastating damage or were destroyed altogether during this era, Mr. Yang's home was spared due to its continued use by the Chinese military. The site changed hands again in the 1990s and became a kindergarten for over a decade. The Linden Centre as seen from outside. Mr. Yang's home became protected at the Yunnan provincial level in 1987, and gained a nationally protected status in 2001. The property today is managed and operated by two Americans, Brian and Jeanee Linden, who are the only foreigners to have possession of a nationally protected heritage site in China. They have been operating the site as The Linden Centre since renovations began in 2007. Renovations The property has been continuously occupied and has changed hands several times since 1948, with very little structural upkeep until renovations began in 2007. Along with necessary safety installations (pipes replaced, fire extinguishers installed) the Linden Centre added glass ceilings to protect original artwork from the wind, rain, and sun damage, re-levelled floors and walkways, and restored the original living spaces. Description The upper facade of a Bai reflecting wall in the Linden Centre. Although the site has been renovated and refurnished, all of the wall art, reflecting walls, structure, and facades are original. The style is typical for its era of construction, this time is characterized as an economic boom in Xizhou and many large courtyard homes were built in a similar size and with the same attention to detail. The Linden Centre's main courtyard and facilities are open to the public while the second, third, and exterior courtyard are for the hotel's guests. Locations In 2013 and 2015, the Linden Centre expanded to renovate and restore two other nationally protected heritage sites in Xizhou. Yang Zhuoran (Êù®ÂçìÁÑ∂) and Bao Chengfu (ÂÆùÊàêÂ∫ú) are two other properties built in the same era and in a similar style. Yang Zhuoran is composed of dorms, classrooms, and a library, serving as a facility for education programs while Bao Chengfu has 14 guest rooms, but highlights its public space and facilities for community involvement.

He also composed church music. Early career The organ at Exeter Cathedral, 2008 He was born in Exeter in 1729, son of Charles Langdon and a grandson of Tobias Langdon (1683‚Äì1712), Vicar choral of Exeter Cathedral. In the summer of 1738, Richard became a chorister at Exeter Cathedral and retained this until spring 1748; by then he had become a secondary. Sub-chanter John Hicks was ordered to teach Richard the organ on 1 December 1744. On 16 June 1753, he was appointed as Vicar choral of Exeter Cathedral following the death of former organist John Silvester; soon after, on 23 June, was also appointed the cathedral's organist. Langdon's early career was marked without complaints over him or his competence and he taught writing and arithmetic to the choristers. From 1757 to 1769, large sums of money were paid to Richard for subscriptions to volumes of William Boyce's compositions. The only criticism of Langdon by the cathedral was on 3 March 1759 due to his \\"frequent\\" absence and disobedience of the sub-chanter. Soon after on 7 April 1759, he was given permission for five weeks of absence. It is possible that the amount of absence from Langdon was related to his time studying at Oxford University. He graduated BMus at Exeter College, Oxford on 13 July 1761.Past organists: Richard Langdon BMUS 1782‚Äì1794 Saint Patrick's Cathedral Armagh, accessed 12 February 2016. Due to failing health, Hicks resigned his position of master of the choristers and Langdon was appointed the position on 8 May 1762 This marked the first time since 1608 (excepting a brief period in 1661) that the position master of the choristers and organist were held by the same person. On 28 August 1770 he married Susanna Evans. Langdon resigned his position and was replaced by Jackson of Exeter, who said this on the matter \\"he resigned, for a pecuniary consideration, in my favour\\". Bristol and Armagh In November 1777 he was elected organist of Ely Cathedral; soon after in December, he was made organist of Bristol Cathedral; he resigned in June 1781. His last appointment was as organist of Armagh Cathedral in 1782. In 1794, in poor health, he left Armagh and retired to Exeter, where he died on 8 September 1803. A plain white marble tablet was placed in his memory at his resting place in St Paul's Church, Exeter. The church was demolished in 1936 and the memorial moved to Cathedral Close. Works Langdon's works include, besides several anthems, Twelve Songs and Two Cantatas, opus 4 (London, unknown date); and Twelve Glees for Three and Four Voices (London, 1770). In 1774 he published Divine Harmony, being a Collection in score of Psalms and Anthems. At the end of this work are twenty chants by various authors, all printed anonymously; the first, a double chant in F, has usually been assigned to Langdon himself.

Chris Elmore of the Labour Party won the by-election with 52.6 percent of the vote. The by-election was held on the same day as the 2016 Welsh Assembly election as well as elections for the Scottish Parliament, the Northern Ireland Assembly, for the Mayor and Assembly of London and in numerous local authorities in England. A by-election for Sheffield Brightside and Hillsborough was also held on the same day. Background The seat fell vacant after the incumbent MP, Huw Irranca-Davies of the Labour Party, chose to resign following his selection to contest the coterminous Ogmore constituency in the Welsh Assembly election. On 23 March 2016, Irranca-Davies was appointed Crown Steward and Bailiff of the Manor of Northstead the process by which resignations from the House of Commons are permitted. Irranca-Davies had been the MP for the seat since a previous by- election in 2002. Irranca-Davies has originally announced that he would seek Labour's nomination for the Welsh Assembley's Ogmore in October 2015, stating that if he was selected he would resign his Westminster seat. Irranca-Davies successfully contested his Assembly election. Irranca-Davies was not obliged to resign upon his nomination, though following the Wales Act 2014, which came into effect during the 2016 Assembly election, he would have had to resign his Westminster seat following his Assembly victory. Given that in both the Assembly and Westminster Ogmore was considered a safe seat for Labour his early resignation allowed the by-election to be held on the same day rather than forcing voters to go to the polls again a few weeks later. Candidates Bridgend County Borough Council published the statement of persons nominated on 8 April 2016. This showed that five candidates that contested the election. Councillor Chris Elmore, currently Cabinet Member for Children's Services and Schools in the Vale of Glamorgan Council, represented Labour. Elmore contested the Vale of Glamorgan constituency in 2015 general election, where he lost to the Conservatives. The Conservatives selected Alex Williams, a town councillor in Ogmore. Glenda Davies was the candidate for UKIP, she also stood for the seat at the 2015 general election. She was the UKIP's candidate for the Aberavon constituency in the Welsh Assembly election held on the same day. Abi Thomas stood for Plaid Cymru. The Liberal Democrats selected Janet Ellard, a former teacher and now volunteer manager for a youth homeless charity. The incumbent party (Labour) selected Chris Elmore as their candidate; Elmore prevailed in the election, winning the seat.

It did not go into production. Design Although the main r√¥le of the Potez 51 was as an intermediate trainer Potez, with their very successful Potez 25 in mind, hoped that it would also serve as a photographic reconnaissance aircraft, an air- ambulance and, in the civil sphere, a grand tourer. It was a monoplane with a constant chord parasol wing with about 2.5¬∞ of sweep. The tips were semi- circular and there was a deep, rounded cut-out in the trailing edge over the cockpits. High aspect ratio ailerons occupied the whole trailing edge. The wing was built around wooden box-spars and was fabric covered. It was braced to the lower fuselage by parallel struts to the wing beyond mid-span. Four cabane struts from the upper fuselage on each side braced the wing centre section. Its fuselage was largely wooden, with spruce longerons and ply skin, though the forward section, which contained the Potez 9A radial engine, had metal bearers and removable metal sheet covering. The engine was enclosed by a NACA long chord engine cowling. Behind the engine the fuselage was flat sided, though with rounded decking both forward and aft of the two open cockpits, the forward one under the trailing edge cut-out and the other close behind. Fairings ahead of each gave protection from the slipstream and dual controls were fitted. Both fin and tailplane were essentially triangular and carried balanced control surfaces. The tailplane was mounted on top of the fuselage and its angle of incidence could be adjusted in flight; it was braced on each side at the apex of a V-strut from the lower fuselage. The Potez 51 had fixed landing gear, with mainwheels on cranked axles and drag struts from the lower fuselage; near vertical shock absorbing legs were attached to the forward wing struts, reinforced at their tops by struts inwards to the upper fuselage. The wheels were enclosed in semi-circular fairings. There was a short tailskid. Development The trainer was on display, unflown, at the 1932 Paris Salon. Its first flight was made towards the end of January 1933. Trials continued into 1934, though by August 1933 the aircraft was well harmonized. In November the propeller had to be modified to meet homologation requirements, as Potez had initially underestimated the full power of their new engine, at 2,100 rpm. Finally in March 1934 the factory testing was done and the Potez 51 went to Villacoublay for official evaluation. Its fate is not recorded in the contemporary French aviation journals, but it seems no more were built.

Attempts to rescue her by her destroyer escort failed and she went on the rocks off Tory Island, County Donegal, Ireland. Ten of her crew were lost but the remaining 18 were rescued the following day by Arranmore Lifeboat and landed safely in Burtonport. The rescue of the survivors was conducted in terrible weather conditions and both the RNLI and Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands awarded medals to the Irish lifeboat crew. Construction and History The steamship was launched on 30 October 1919 by Werf De Noord at Alblasserdam as Kongsgaard for the Norwegian shipowners A/S Vestlandske Lloyd, managed by Br√∏drene Olsen (A G & J C Olsen) of Stavanger, and completed in January 1920. She measured and , with a cargo capacity of 4,100 DWT. Her length was , beam and depth of hold . The ship was powered by a triple expansion steam engine of 1200 IHP, made by NV Machinefabriek 'Kinderdijk', driving a single propeller. In 1921, in a shipping recession, Kongsgaards owners were bankrupt and the ship was sold to the Rotterdam shipping company NV Maatschappij SS Rijswijk, managed by the firm Erhardt & Dekkers. She was transferred form Norwegian to Dutch flag and re-measured as 2,499 GRT and 1,533 NRT, and with a cargo capacity of 4,175 DWT. Erhardt & Dekkers' ships were all named after towns and villages that ended with \\"wijk\\", in this case Stolwijk in South Holland. Stolwijk ran aground at √Öhus, Sk√•ne County, Sweden, on 25 April 1922. She was refloated on 29 April 1922. In 1930 ownership was transferred to NV Stoomvaart Maatschappij 'Wijklijn', still under Erhardt & Dekkers management. Stowijk was at sea when the Netherlands fell to Germany in May 1940 during World War Two. She could not return to her home base of Rotterdam, but continued to operate as part of the large Dutch merchant marine. Other Convoy Activity Stolwijk was part of outbound Convoy OB 188 in July 1940, steaming from Liverpool to North America; German submarines sank four of the convoy‚Ä≤s ships. She returned in August 1940 as part of Convoy SC 01; again, four ships were lost during the journey. In October 1940 Stolwijk went back to North America as part of Convoy OB 232.

Violent storms beset the convoy from the outset. On 3 December 1940, the convoy diverted northwest to try to escape the storm and in so doing avoided being intercepted by German submarines that had been attacking convoy HX 90U-Boat.Net reference website, http://uboat.net/ops/convoys/battles.htm?convoy=HX-90 The stranding of Stolwijk At 10:30am on 5 December 1940 Stolwijk‚Ä≤s rudder broke. Many attempts were made to repair it but they were futile due to the weather. The anchor was dropped but the chain snapped and even going in full reverse did not halt the ship‚Ä≤s steady drift toward the rocky Irish coastline. One of the escorting destroyers, , risked her own safety in trying to rescue the crew of StolwijkSir Peter Gretton, Convoy Escort Commander (1964) had this to say about the involvement of the Sabre in the failed rescue attempt when he assumed command of the boat in early Jan 1941: Recently she had been badly damaged in a brave attempt to rescue the crew of a Dutch ship which had run ashore on Tory Island on the nor-Western coast of Ireland in a full gale. Sabre went in so close that she was almost among the breakers; and one great wave swept he decks, flattening the bridge and taking with it all the upper- deck fittings. The Captain had been badly injured and was still in hospital, but his was the worst case and fortunately no-one had been lost. and was herself nearly destroyed.Western Approaches War Diaries, 6‚Äì8 December 1940 Stolwijk lost one of her lifeboats at this stage suffered damage to the other. A massive wave washed her radio operator overboard and Stolwijk hit the rocks at 11:30 p.m. Nine sailors made an attempt to reach the lifeboat that had been washed overboard. According to the official court report, some made it to the lifeboat, but the storm capsized it and only three bodies were subsequently recovered. The remaining 18 survivors remained on board and radioed for help.Nationaal Archief 2.16.31 Archief van de Buitengewone Raad voor de Scheepvaart te Londen 1940 - 1946, inv.nr. 23: dossier inzake de stranding van het s.s. Stolwijk The rescue of the survivors Arranmore Lifeboat were notified late in the evening of 6 December 1940 of the ship in distress and given an approximate location. It was too late and stormy to depart immediately. The all-volunteer lifeboat crew departed Arranmore Island at 6:30am on 7 December in a hurricane-force gale. Witnesses claim the lifeboat K.T.J.S. went over one wave and through the next' on the outward journey. Stowijk had gone aground on rocks called Carraignacrubog (\\"The Rock of Crabs\\") just north of Inishdooey and south of Inisbeg. The National Archives in the Netherlands Nederlands Instituut voor Militaire Historie (NIMH), Commissie Onderscheidingen Koopvaardij (080), inv.nr. 2, Stolwijk has this information of the rescue from the secretary of the RNLI (C.R. Satterthwaite) in April 1941: * The lifeboat reached Stolwijk at noon in very stormy conditions. * The crew of Stolwijk were huddled at the stern of the ship and waves were breaking over them. * The lifeboat anchored to windward and drifted close to the boat and then fired a line to the crew so a breeches buoy could be used to transfer the men. This procedure was repeated three times as the line kept breaking. It took four hours for all eighteen survivors to be rescued in this way, each spending upwards of five minutes in the water. * It took the lifeboat a further five hours to reach Burtonport on the mainland during which she was nearly swamped by heavy seas. * The coxswain John Boyle was awarded the Gold Medal by the RNLI, which according to the report is the Victoria Cross of the Institution. * The motor mechanic Teague Ward was awarded the Silver Medal and the Bronze Medal was awarded to the other crew members: Philip Boyle, acting second-coxswain, Philip Byrne, acting bowman, Neil Byrne, assistant motor- mechanic, Patrick O‚ÄôDonnell, Joseph Rodgers, and Bryan Gallagher. Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands awarded the Dutch gold medal for gallantry in saving life to Coxswain John Boyle, the silver medal to Teague Ward and the bronze medal to each of the six other members of the crew.Elder, Michael (1963), For Those in Peril: The Story of the Life-boat Service, publisher J. Murray The Immediate Aftermath The three bodies recovered following the tragedy were originally buried in the Church of Ireland graveyard in Killult (Donegal, Ireland). In October 2000 the bodies were exhumed and re-interred at the National Cemetery of Honours in Loenen (Netherlands). Sabre put into Londonderry, also known as Derry, with sea damage on 7 December 1940. Her commander, Lieutenant Commander Brian Dean, suffered a fractured skull in the rescue attempt and was retired from the sea. Sabre sailed to Belfast for repairs and resumed activity on 18 January 1941 under the command of Peter Gretton. The British ship SS Ashcrest 5,652 tons, was also part of SC 13 and also experienced a broken rudder during the storm. She radioed for help but the message was intercepted by a German submarine. She was torpedoed by U-140 on 8 December 1940 with the loss of all 38 men. 75 Anniversary song: I'll Go On 7 December 2015, Arranmore publican and singer/songwriter Jerry Early released a song on iTunes called I'll Go to commemorate the actions of the lifeboat crew.iTunes single by Jerry Early 'I'll Go', 2015; https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/ill-go-single/id1065363792 He co-wrote the song with his cousin John Gallagher.

He served for most of his life as part of the missions in Colombia where he worked with lepers and the children of outcast lepers. He was ordained as a priest while serving there and made it his mission to provide both relief and consolation. He established his own religious congregation - the Daughters of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary - with the intention of allowing lepers and the children of lepers the chance to enter the religious life. Pope John Paul II beatified Variara on 14 April 2002. Life Luigi Variara was born in 1875 in Asti to Pietro Variara and Livia Bussa. Variara entered a Salesian Oratory in Turin at the age of 12 for studies. His father heard John Bosco preach in 1856 and took Variara to Valdocco to complete his studies; Variara met Bosco for a brief period in 1887 before Bosco died in 1888 and the encounter with Bosco left a deep imprint upon Variara. When the two met, Bosco gazed into Variara which the latter took as a confirmation of his future Salesian vocation, considering Bosco's gaze as the approval for such a decision. After Variara finished high school he asked permission to become a Salesian. Variara joined the Salesians of Don Bosco on 17 August 1891 and commenced his period of novitiate. Variara underwent philosophical studies at Valsalice where he met the Andrew Beltrami who died not long after; Variara was inspired with Beltrami's docile attitude to his suffering. He made his solemn profession of his religious vows in the hands of Bosco's successor Michael Rua. In 1894 the priest Michele Unia came to look for a cleric to take with him to Colombia to assist at the Salesian missions for the lepers. Out of the 188 candidates Unia was most impressed with Variara and the two embarked and arrived in Colombia in Agua de Dios on 6 August 1894. When Unia chose him out of all others Variara said of it: \\"I said 'yes', and it seemed to me a dream\\". He carried out his apostolate in the leper colonies of Agua de Dios in the mission that numbered 2000 people of whom 800 were lepers that he would tend to. Variara was ordained to the priesthood in 1898 in Colombia. Variara also served for a period of time as the spiritual director to the Sodality of the Children of Mary. He often served in the confessional booth for around four to five hours. Unia died in 1895 and allowed for Variara to work with his fellow Salesian Father Crippa. In 1905 he established the Father Michele Unia Kindergarten in honor of Unia whom Variara had a great admiration for. Seeing that the lepers and - indeed the children of lepers - could not enter the religious life he decided at the suggestion of Rua to establish a religious congregation to allow them to do so. He also decided to do this with the permission of the Archbishop of Bogot√° Bernardo Herrera Restrepo and formal approval for the establishment allowed for it to be erected as such on 7 May 1905. It received diocesan approval from Restrepo's successor Isamel Perdomo Borrero on 2 October 1930 and the papal decree of praise from Pope Pius XII in 1952; Pope Paul VI granted formal pontifical approval on 6 April 1964. In 1919 he was diagnosed to have contracted the disease that he had worked alongside for so long; this diagnosis proved to be quite inaccurate. In 1921 he agreed to go to Tariba in Venezuela but arrived in poor health. The doctors there that attended to him requested he go back to Colombia to Cucuta. He died in 1923 in Cucuta; his remains were transferred to Agua de Dios in 1932 where he now rests. Legacy At present the congregation that Variara established operates across several continents such as Europe and Africa and spread at a rapid pace across South America where Variara operated. It now operates in states such as Cameroon and Spain. As of 2005 there have been around 382 religious of the congregation operating in a total of 71 houses. Beatification The beatification process was initiated on two fronts in both Bogota and in Girardot and commenced in a diocesan process that spanned from 10 August 1959 until 12 September 1959 - the beginning of the cause allowed for Variara to be granted the posthumous title Servant of God. The process was declared valid on 21 April 1989 and allowed for the Congregation for the Causes of Saints to initiate their own line of investigation in what was known as the so-called \\"Roman Phase\\" of the proceedings. The postulation later compiled the Positio extolling the works and the virtues of the late Salesian priest and submitted it to Rome in 1989 for further investigation. Pope John Paul II approved these findings and recognized that the late priest had in fact lived a model Christian life of heroic virtue; because of this the pope conferred upon Variara the title of Venerable on 2 April 1993. The pope also approved a miracle attributed to his intercession and celebrated his beatification on 14 April 2002. The current postulator of the cause is the Salesian Father Pierluigi Cameroni.

They also gathered acorns from the surrounding oak trees in which they grinded for food. Prosperous, the tribes lived in the center of a commerce that extended up and down the coast, as far west as the California Channel Islands. The Spaniards were the first Europeans to arrive here when they arrived in the 1500s. During the colonization, the Spanish established various nearby missions to claim the territory for Spain.

Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus jutsonii was first formally described in 1919 by Joseph Maiden from a specimen collected from Comet Vale by John Thomas Jutson and the description was published in Journal and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New South Wales. The specific epithet honours the collector of the type specimen. In 2007, Dean Nicolle and Malcolm French described two subspecies and the names have been accepted by the Australian Plant Census: * Eucalyptus jutsonii Maiden subsp. jutsonii has adult leaves that are wide and fruits long; * Eucalyptus jutsonii subsp. kobela D.Nicolle & M.E.French has adult leaves that are wide and fruits long. Distribution and habitat Jutson's mallee grows in open shrubland on sand or sandy loam in a restricted area north of Kalgoorlie. Subspecies kobela is only known from two populations east of Morawa. Conservation status Subspecies jutsonii is listed as \\"Priority Four\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that it is rare or near threatened. Subspecies kobela is classified as \\"Priority One\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that it is known from only one or a few locations which are potentially at risk.

It is one of the 31 Upanishads attached to the Atharvaveda, and classified as one of the 14 Vaishnava Upanishads. This is a late Upanishad exclusively devoted to the Hindu god Rama, dated to have been composed in the modern era. The text is largely recited by Hanuman, who states that Rama is identical to the supreme unchanging reality Brahman, same as major Hindu deities, and the means to satcitananda and liberation. The text also includes sections on Tantra suggesting beej mantra based on Rama. History Neither the author nor the date of composition of this text is known. Moriz Winternitz makes a passing mention in a footnote stating that it belongs to the same period as the other Rama-related Upanishads. Catherine Ludvik ‚Äì a professor at the Stanford University, dates the Rama-rahasya Upanishad to the 17th-century. Not much is known about this text, states Ramdas Lamb, and it is to a large extent different from the other Rama-related Upanishads. The Ramarahasya Upanishad, along with the Rama tapaniya Upanishad, presents Rama as an avatar of Vishnu, and these are therefore classified as Vaishnava Upanishads. The Christian missionary in colonial British India, Farquhar included it in the list of 123 Upanishads. The Vedanta philosophy had a major influence on this and other Rama-related Upanishads, states Lamb, along with the 12th century Rama-related Agastya Samhita text. In the Telugu language anthology of 108 Upanishads of the Muktika canon, narrated by Rama to Hanuman, it is listed at number 54. The Upanishad is not part of the anthology of 52 popular Upanishads in north India by Colebrooke, nor is it found in the Bibliotheca Indica anthology of popular Upanishads in south India by Narayana. The first chapter of the text, states Paul Deussen, is also known as Hanumadukta-Ramopanishad. Contents Ramapanchayan, the five associated with Rama ‚Äì Sita, Lakshmana, Bharata, Shatrughna and Hanuman. The narration of the text is presented as replies by Hanuman to the questions posed to him by many rishis seeking true knowledge. Hanuman states god Rama is the supreme reality, the Brahman and the Atman (soul), and he is the medium to attain moksha or emancipation. The text presents goddess Sita, the wife of Rama, as the cause of creation, and Hanuman as the completely absorbed example and ideal devotee of Rama. Together, Rama and Sita are asserted to be the source of all existence. Rama is, asserts the text, same as other major Hindu deities. The other divinities mentioned in the text, states Dalal, as angas (aspects) of Rama are Ganesha, the Sun god, the moon god, and other avatars of Vishnu (Narayana, Narasimha, Vasudeva, Varaha). The characters of the Hindu epic Ramayana such as Lakshmana, Shatrughna, Bharata and Vibhishana are also asserted by the text to be aspects of Rama. The Upanishad adds that goddesses such as Saraswati (knowledge and arts) and Durga (fierce form of mother goddess Parvati) are manifestations of Rama, the supreme truth and reality symbolized as the Pranava (Om). Hanuman advocates the importance of reciting the six syllabled Rama Mantra, Ram Ramaya namah. In section 1.13, states Lamb, Hanuman informs Vibhishan that constant recitation of Ramnam mantra removes the bad karma of a person accrued from committing the sin of killing his father, his mother, his guru or a Brahmin. The text also recommends the reading of the Rama Gita. The text enumerates many mantras, assigning them tantric powers, which it forms by combining root mantras. All these mantras are associated with Ram, but each formulation connotes a different role. The syllables in the mantras vary from 1 to 24, and evolves mantras like Om Ramaya hum phat swaha and Om srim Ram Dassarathaya Sita vallabbhaya sarvabhita daya namah. Out of these mantras those with two to six syllables are claimed by the text to be most beneficial, states Lamb. In contrast, Mahadevan interprets the text as glorifying eight syllable mantra, in the form \\"Sri Ramah, sa-ra-nam ma-ma\\" or \\"Sri Rama is my refuge\\". The single syllable Ram signifies the supreme reality Brahman, whereas split into two syllables \\"ra ‚Äì ma\\", it emancipates according to the text. The Upanishad text has verses that relate to dhyana or the contemplation of Rama. The text, states Dalal, asserts that the \\"rahasya\\" or secret of \\"energising the body\\" (Nyasa) is to recite Rama mantra it discloses while touching different body parts. The Upanishad, states Dodiya, asserts that the roots of syllables \\"‡§∞, ‡§Ü, ‡§Æ‡§æ\\" or \\"r+aa+ma\\" form the word Rama. In relation to the evolution of the mantras ‡§∞ r is stated to indicate the incarnation of the Satcitananda and as 'r' is a consonant it is indivisible and hence beyond maya or Mayatita, implying the unchanging reality that is Brahman. The syllable ‡§Ü Aa suggests swarup and which is influenced by maya (mayavishist) element or principle. This mantra Rama is the Bija or seed of Rama Mantra. Hence Rama as Brahman, states Dodiya, is endowed with Maya or the observed empirical universe.
