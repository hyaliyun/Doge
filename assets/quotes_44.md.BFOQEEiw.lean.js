Loophole  The United States District Court for the District of Wyoming is currently the only United States district court to have jurisdiction over parts of multiple states. This is due to the fact that its jurisdiction includes all of Yellowstone National Park, which extends slightly beyond Wyoming's boundaries into Idaho and Montana. In addition, the federal government has exclusive jurisdiction over the park, so crimes committed in the park cannot be prosecuted under any of the states' laws. Trials in the district court are normally held at the federal courthouse in Cheyenne, Wyoming. However, the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution decrees that juries in federal criminal cases must be made up of citizens who are from both the district state where the crime was committed. Because of this, charges for a crime alleged to have been committed in the area of the park in Idaho would have to be tried before a jury consisting entirely of residents of that area, and the trial would also have to take place in that area. As the Idaho portion of the park has no courthouses and is uninhabited, no such jury could be assembled. Thus the defendant would be unable to have a fair trial, and could not receive legal punishment for any alleged crimes.  Discovery  The constitutional loophole in this area was discovered by Michigan State University law professor Brian C. Kalt while he was planning to write an essay about technicalities of the Sixth Amendment, which entitles citizens to a fair and quick trial. Kalt wondered about a hypothetical place where there were not enough eligible citizens to form a jury and theorized that there could be no trial and therefore no punishment for major crimes in that area. He later realized that there was such a place: the Idaho section of Yellowstone National Park. Horrified by his realization, Kalt shifted his focus to writing an essay about the area to persuade the government to fix the loophole. The essay, which is called \\"The Perfect Crime\\", was published in 2005 in the Georgetown Law Journal. Kalt feared that criminals might read the essay and commit a crime in the Zone before the loophole was fixed.  History  After Kalt discovered the loophole, he worked to have the government close it. He suggested to lawmakers in Wyoming that the Zone of Death be included as part of the federal district court for the District of Idaho instead of the Wyoming district, which would fix the issue. However, the lawmakers ignored Kalt's suggestion. In 2007, author C. J. Box wrote a novel called Free Fire that featured the Zone, which Box hoped would increase governmental awareness. The novel did succeed in alerting Wyoming Senator Mike Enzi to the issue. However, Enzi was unable to convince Congress to discuss it. No known felonies have been committed in the Zone of Death since Kalt's discovery. However, a poacher named Michael Belderrain illegally shot an elk in the Montana section of Yellowstone. While that section of the park does have enough residents to form a jury, it might be difficult to put together a standing and fair one due to travel or unwillingness of members of the small population there to serve. A federal judge ruled that Belderrain could be tried in the U.S. District Court for the District of Wyoming, despite the Sixth Amendment problem. Belderrain cited Kalt's paper \\"The Perfect Crime\\" to explain why he believed it was illegal to have his trial with a jury from a state other than where the crime was committed. The court dismissed this argument, Belderrain took a plea deal conditioned on him not appealing the Zone of Death issue to the 10th Circuit, and the issue was left unresolved.

Hilye-i sharif, written by the s√ºl√ºs-nesih line, by Esm√¢ ƒ∞bret Hanƒ±m. Museum of Turkish and Islamic Works  Life and work  In the 18th-century Ottoman period, calligraphy was a male-dominated profession. However, a small number of female calligraphers, such as Esm√¢ Ibret and ≈ûerife Fatma, successfully trained as calligraphers and were able to make valuable contributions in their field.Emel Doƒüramacƒ± Status of Women in Turkey Meteksan, 1984, p. 168 Esm√¢ Ibret Hanim was born in Istanbul in 1194 (1780).Turkish Biographical Index, Walter de Gruyter, 2011, p. 362 Her father was Serhasekiyan-i hassa Ahmed Aƒüa, an official in the Royal Palace. She was an only child, and special attention was given to her education. From early childhood she showed an interest in calligraphy, writing in s√ºl√ºs-nesih and ic√¢zet and copying the work of Mahmud Cel√¢leddin Efendi.

His treatment sparked an international incident with the Philippines. Gamboa enlisted in the United States Army in 1941, and was evacuated to Australia the following year after the Japanese invasion of the Philippines. He married an Australian woman, Joyce Cain, and fathered two children, both born while he was serving overseas. He was discharged from the U.S. Army in 1945 and joined his family in Australia, but was refused permission to settle permanently and forced to leave the country. Gamboa became a naturalised U.S. citizen in 1946 and rejoined the army. He applied to re-enter Australia in 1948, but was refused even a visitor's visa. Immigration Minister Arthur Calwell stated that allowing Gamboa into the country would promote miscegenation, and granting an exception because of his U.S. citizenship would force the government to allow in racially undesirable groups such as African-Americans. In 1949, following Gamboa's chance encounter with journalist Denis Warner, the Australian media began to criticise Calwell's handling of the issue and pressed for Gamboa to be allowed to reunite with his family. The \\"Gamboa case\\" sparked outrage in the Philippines. President Elpidio Quirino said that Filipinos had been \\"deeply humiliated\\" by the Australian government's actions, and the Philippine House of Representatives passed a bill that would have banned Australians from the country. After a change of government at the 1949 federal election, the new immigration minister Harold Holt overturned Calwell's decision and allowed Gamboa to rejoin his family; he settled permanently in Australia in 1952. The incident had a lasting impact on Australia‚ÄìPhilippines relations. Early life Gamboa was born on 11 November 1918 in Mangaldan, Pangasinan. He left school at the age of 16 to work in a coal mine, while also studying electrical engineering at night school. After the passage of the National Defense Act of 1935, he had to complete compulsory military training every year. Gamboa was a talented boxer, and in 1940 won a boxing competition that had a scholarship to National University as its prize. He did not meet the educational requirements for the scholarship, and so began attending night classes to complete his secondary education. His entrance to university was interrupted by the outbreak of the Pacific War. In late 1941, Gamboa enlisted in the United States Army. He was immediately caught up in the Battle of the Philippines, narrowly escaping a Japanese bombing raid before being hospitalised with a hernia a few weeks later. He left the country on 31 December aboard the hospital ship Mactan, again narrowly escaping a bombing attack while his ship was in the harbour. He was sent to Australia via Celebes, arriving in Darwin on 13 January 1942. He was subsequently moved on to Melbourne and housed in a military camp at Royal Park, while working as a guard at the Port of Melbourne. Gamboa rejoined the U.S. Army in July 1942. He was posted to Port Moresby, New Guinea, a few months later, and served as an orderly for General Douglas MacArthur. He was then attached to MacArthur's headquarters in Brisbane. In 1944, he returned to the Philippines with the army, and was stationed in Leyte for a period. He visited his mother in March 1945, who did not recognise him; he had been listed as missing in action and was presumed dead. Gamboa arrived in Yokohama in August 1945, to take part in the occupation of Japan. His term of service expired in November 1945 and he opted to be discharged in Australia to rejoin his family. Marriage and children Gamboa married Joyce Cain in Melbourne on 9 October 1943. In March 1942, Gamboa was taking a train back to his barracks when he met Joyce Cain, a 16-year-old Australian girl who worked at a biscuit factory. She invited him back to her parents' home in Brunswick West, at the time a common gesture of goodwill towards soldiers. They subsequently began dating. Joyce later recounted that her family and friends had been overwhelmingly accepting of their relationship, as mixed-race couples were not uncommon in war-time Melbourne. The couple became engaged in August 1942 and married on 9 October 1943, spending their honeymoon at a hotel. Their first child, Raymond, was born in Melbourne in November 1944, when Gamboa was stationed in Leyte. A second child, Julie, was born in Melbourne in January 1947, when he was stationed in Tokyo. Immigration issues After being discharged from the army in 1945, Gamboa's father-in-law found him work with the Victorian Railways, and he settled in Melbourne to live with his wife and son. His continued presence was discovered by the Department of Immigration in early 1946, after he attempted to collect a ration book, and he was subsequently given three months to leave the country. He left for the United States in June 1946, travelling alongside Australian war brides joining their non-white American husbands. On arrival in the U.S., Gamboa was detained for entering the country without a passport. His military service entitled him to American citizenship, which he adopted on 26 July 1946. He subsequently re-enlisted in the U.S. Army and was posted back to Japan, joining General MacArthur's headquarters in Tokyo. Gamboa applied to re-enter Australia in October 1948, hoping to return to his family after his discharge in August 1949. His preference was for permanent residence, but he also applied for a tourist visa as a back-up; he assumed that as a U.S. citizen he would not face the same difficulties as before. However, the Department of Immigration informed the Australian Mission in Tokyo that he would not be allowed to enter the country at all, as he was non-white and his case would be a precedent for other Asian war evacuees to remain in Australia. In early 1949, Gamboa encountered Australian Associated Press journalist Denis Warner while waiting in an army post office in Tokyo. Warner's article about the case sparked a media frenzy, with coverage in popular daily newspapers and weekly magazines overwhelmingly sympathetic to the Gamboas and hostile to the government. Lorenzo was quoted as asking \\"why did they let me marry an Australian girl if they wouldn't let me into the country to see her?\\". =Resolution= Arthur Calwell, Australian Minister for Immigration 1941‚Äì1949 The media coverage of the Gamboa case and other similar cases made the government's immigration policy an issue in the lead-up to the 1949 federal election. Calwell defended his actions during a campaign rally at the Brunswick Town Hall in November 1949, stating \\"there is nothing wrong with the Labor Party's administration of the White Australia policy\\". He said \\"I am sure we don't want half-castes running over our country\\", and told the audience that \\"if we let in any U.S. citizen, we will have to admit U.S. Negroes [...] I don't think mothers and fathers would want to see that\\". He believed that allowing compassionate exceptions to the White Australia policy would lead to a slippery slope in which thousands of other non-white immigrants would be allowed entry. The same reasoning was behind the passage of the War-time Refugees Removal Act 1949, which allowed the government to deport non-whites who had entered Australia as refugees during the war. The government was not only accused of cruelty towards the Gamboas, but also of endangering the White Australia policy through an overly heavy- handed approach that was likely to antagonise Asian countries. Opposition Leader Robert Menzies attacked the immigration department's \\"singularly unpleasant process of victimisation\\", but reaffirmed the basic principles of the White Australia policy. In March 1949, two Filipino golfers arrived in Australia to play in a tournament in Sydney. Harold Holt, the opposition spokesman for immigration, accused the government of hypocrisy, observing in parliament that \\"it is incredible that Filipino golfers are on a golfing tour of Australia while Minister for Immigration Mr. Calwell is keeping out one of their own countrymen who wants to discuss the future with his wife\\". He accused Calwell of adopting a \\"pig-headed and inhuman stand\\". At the election, Calwell's Labor Party was defeated by Holt's Liberal Party. Holt was subsequently appointed as the new Minister for Immigration in the Menzies Government. Two days after the election, in December 1949, he cabled Joyce Gamboa and told her that her husband would be allowed to settle in Australia; an official announcement was made in February 1950. As he was still on a tour of duty with the U.S. Army, he did not actually return to Australia until December 1951, and did not permanently return until early 1952. =Reaction in the Philippines= Australia and the Philippines were on friendly terms after the end of World War II, and President Elpidio Quirino sought out Australia as a potential regional partner, hoping to lessen his country's dependence on the United States. However, the relationship between the two countries was severely damaged when the Australian government's treatment of Gamboa was made public. In April 1949, President Quirino expressed his disappointment \\"that our neighbour, to whom we looked for friendship, should exclude us because of our colour\\", and stated that \\"we, the people of the Philippines, have been deeply humiliated\\". The Department of Foreign Affairs revoked its Australian consulate's authority to issue visas, forcing potential Australian visitors to seek a visa on arrival. Author Hal Porter was subjected to a six-hour visa interview, in which he was asked his opinions of the Gamboa case and the White Australia policy. Keith Waller, the Australian Consul-General in Manila, received death threats. In March 1949, Congressman Hermenegildo Atienza introduced House Bill No. 2613 (the \\"Reciprocity Immigration Bill\\") into the Philippine House of Representatives, which would have banned Australians from entering the country. His colleague Domingo Paguirigan put forward a motion calling on President Quirino to close the country's consulate in Sydney. In the ensuing debate, Cipriano Primicias called Australians \\"the biggest hypocrites in the world\\", and said that the Philippines should invade Australia to preserve its honour. Atienza's bill was passed by the House of Representatives on 27 April. The Senate added an amendment exempting Australian wives of Filipino citizens, but a sudden adjournment prevented a final vote on the bill. It had not been revived by the time Calwell's decision was overturned, and subsequently lapsed. Australian officials attempted to downplay the significance of the Gamboa case. Calwell claimed it had aroused \\"very little real interest\\" in the Philippines, while Waller dismissed it as a \\"trivial case\\". However, the Gamboa case remained a problem for bilateral relations for a number of decades. One Australian diplomat found that \\"all Filipinos from Manila to the most distant hinterlands knew of Gamboa and the White Australia Policy; in some cases these two items constituted their only knowledge of Australia\\". In 1957, Ambassador Mick Shann sent a communique to the Department of External Affairs recording his dismay at the number of times the Gamboa case had been raised with him, and emphasised the need to counteract the impressions given. Ambassadors Bill Cutts and Francis Stuart expressed similar sentiments in the 1960s. Later life Gamboa visited the Philippines in 1971 for the first time in 20 years, along with his wife, daughter, and son-in-law. In June 1973, Immigration Minister Al Grassby announced that he would allow Gamboa to become an Australian citizen. Gamboa rejected the offer, as it would have required him to renounce his U.S. citizenship, and said that government officials had approached him to take up citizenship on a number of previous occasions. In 1977, Gamboa and his wife retired to the Gold Coast, Queensland, building a home at Coombabah. Their two children predeceased them, but as of 2002 they had four grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren. After their daughter's death from cancer in 1995, they raised their youngest granddaughter, who was 12 years old at the time. In 2001, the Filipino Communities Council of Australia awarded Gamboa the title of \\"Filipino-Australian of the Millennium\\". He died in September 2012, aged 93.

In Elamite, his name means \\"Great (-≈°a) God (napir)\\"; in cuneiforme texts, the word is written using the ideogramme GAL (meaning \\"great\\" in Sumerian), which was without a correct interpretation for some time. Napirisha is depicted as an anthropomorphic deity, often with a snake figure that symolises primordial waters. It is thus identified with the Mesopotamian god Enki/Ea, who rules the primordial waters of the abyss. In Elam, he was close to the character of Humban, the great god of the Awan region, which he replaced as a titular deity of Elamit kings around 2000 BCE. In Anshan, Napirisha did not have a main temple. Napirisha was in all likelihood worshiped in large, open stone sanctuaries, such as Kurangun; he is probably the deity depicted on bas- reliefs with his consort (Kiririsha?) and other deities, providing life water. A large temple dedicated to Napirisha was built in Dur-Untash (Choga-Zambil), in Susa, shared with the local titular god Inshushinak. The template was next to a large ziggurat.

It is the most northern minaret left from Ottoman rule in Europe. The minaret is 40 metres (131 feet) high and built from red sandstone. It was built in the early 17th century as part of the Djami of Kethuda mosque and used for the Muslim call to prayer (Adhan). The mosque no longer exists, but the minaret survives as a preserved monument of Hungary and a major tourist attraction of Eger. There are 97 steps on the spiral staircase inside, which leads to a balcony at 26 meters from the ground offering unique views of the surrounding city. Eger minaret is one of three surviving Ottoman era minarets in Hungary. It is the highest and the best preserved of them. The other two minarets are the √ârd minaret and P√©cs minaret. In 2016, a Turkish Muslim resident of Eger was permitted to call the Muslim prayer from the minaret balcony after 327 years. History When exactly the minaret was constructed is still unknown and a number of theories exist about it. The Ottomans took control of Eger city in 1596. Eger minaret is believed to have been built at the beginning of Ottoman rule in the early 17th century. =Djami of Kethuda mosque= The Eger minaret was built as a minaret of the Djami of Kethuda mosque to call out the Islamic call to prayer five times a day for the faithful to come for congregational prayers. The mosque has been mentioned by Evliya √áelebi, who visited Eger in 1664 when it was under Ottoman rule. Former Djami of Kethuda mosque location behind minaret with 1841 church building. The Ottomans were driven out of Eger in 1687 by an Austrian Imperial Army led by Charles of Lorraine. The mosque was converted into a Catholic church dedicated to St. Joseph after the Turkish rule. In 1726, the mosque premises was transformed into the Brothers of Mercy Hospital. The mosque served as the chapel of the hospital and the monastery. The mosque building was finally pulled down in 1841, and was replaced by the present St. Sebesty√©n's Martyrs' Church of Eger. The minaret was entered through the mosque and evidence on the minaret still indicate where it joined the mosque. Not much details is known about the mosque during Ottoman time except for the brief note by Evliya √áelebi. However a more detailed description of the mosque can be constructed from later writings, after its conversion into a St. Joseph church. Gorove and later Ferenc M√©sz√°ros have left some descriptions of the former mosque building, when it was a church, along with the minaret. According to these, the mosque had a regular square plan except for a few minor architectural details. It was a meticulously assembled Turkish structure built in stone with carved windows and doors. It was made of the same reddish sandstone as the minaret and covered by a vaulted roof or dome according to Gorove. The main facade of the mosque had a courtyard surrounded by polished stone. The minaret formed an integral part of the mosque according to Ferenc M√©sz√°ros description. =Minaret Demolition Attempt= After Ottoman rule ended, an attempt was made to tear down the tower as a symbolic closure of the past. After human force failed, an attempt was made pull it down using 400 oxen with ropes fixed to the structure. When the tower proved too resilient to demolition efforts it was allowed to remain after placing a cross on top of the surmounting crescent. The Eger minaret is the only minaret remaining of an estimated 17 that were built in Eger during the 91-year Ottoman rule of the city. A 17th-century illustration of the city shows the abundance of minarets. =Preservation of Minaret= Eger skyline with minaret in 1935In the early 19th century the minarets roof, called the original dome, had collapsed as a result of a lightning strike. It deteriorated the condition of the tower. In 1829, a tin roof was placed on the tower by Archbishop Pyrker J√°nos L√°szl√≥ preserving it from the complete destruction. In 1897, restoration work was carried out on the minaret by the National Committee of the Monuments according to plans of Istv√°n M√∂ller. The National Monumentary Inspectorate again carried out some minor conservation work in 1962. In the past, the minaret was seen as a symbol of occupation. Today, it is a celebrated monument of the good relations between Hungary and Turkey. In 2016, a Turkish national named Demir Hikmet was permitted to become the muezzin (Caller) of the minaret and perform the Adhan or Muslim call to prayer after 327 years. Demir Hikmet climbed the tower three times a week in a silk caftan and recited the call to prayer from the tower balcony. The minaret was renovated again in 2018 due to deterioration in recent years which had greatly reduced its load-bearing capacity and placed the monument in danger. It was closed for visitors for during the renovation and opened again in Summer 2018. During the renovation expert had found ceramic dishes dating back to the Turkish era. Architecture Overlapping ornamental rings round the balcony and roof. Eger minaret is a 14 sided planed structure which is unusual and makes it very strong. It is built using carved reddish sandstone to a height of 40 metres (131 feet). There is a narrow spiral staircase in the interior with 97 steps leading to the minaret balcony. The minaret balcony circling the tower is situated 26 meters up from the ground. On the tower plinth a row of mirror fields with a repeating double-edged dwarf pattern run around. The entrance to the minaret is on the north side of the pedestal. It was originally not out in the open but the entrance was from within the mosque. The entrance to the tower has a semicircular closure. The space inside is small with a steep narrow stone staircase leading to the balcony. The balcony has a door with a semicircular closure, similar to the entrance. The balcony entrance faces the direction of Mecca. There minaret balcony bottom is also ornamented with a recessed overlapping circular belt of rings. It is again repeated around the tower roof with recessed overlapping rings of ornaments. Tourism The Eger minaret is a popular attraction for tourist in Eger. Tourist are allowed to climb the 97 steps to the Minaret balcony and view the panorama of surrounding city and Eger Castle. Those who suffer from claustrophobia and fear of heights are advised to be cautious in climbing the narrow staircase to the tower balcony.

VGG is co- owned by Transdev Germany (49%) and the town council of G√∂rlitz (51%), and is a member of ZVON transport association.  History  VGG was founded in 1996 as a subsidiary of the public services company Stadtwerke G√∂rlitz, then wholly owned by the town council. In April 2001, the town council decided to sell the majority of its shares in Stadtwerke G√∂rlitz to Vivendi Environnement, known since 2003 as Veolia. As part of this deal, VGG became co-owned by Connex (later known as Veolia Transport; since 2011, part of Transdev Germany).  Operations  VGG operates the two tram lines and six bus routes in G√∂rlitz. In 2005, the operator carried 4,217,222 passengers, corresponding to 13,916,833 person-kilometers. Throughout 2010, the operator's services amounted to a total of 556,000 km on the two tram lines, and a total of 504,000 km on the bus routes. In the same year, the subsidies from the town council to VVG amounted to ‚Ç¨ 3,218,507.58. A study, performed in 1997 by the G√∂rlitz town council and funded by the state of Saxony, confirmed that the share of public transport in the overall urban traffic in G√∂rlitz is higher (16%) than in other cities in eastern Saxony, such as Bautzen (about 8%).

KNDy neurons in the hypothalamus coexpress kisspeptin, neurokinin B (NKB) and dynorphin. They are involved in the negative feedback of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release in the hypothalamic‚Äìpituitary‚Äìgonadal (HPG) axis. Sex steroids released from the gonads act on KNDy neurons as inhibitors of kisspeptin release. This inhibition provides negative feedback control on the HPG axis. KNDy peptide colocalization was first discovered in 2007 in sheep and was later confirmed to be present in mice, rats, cows and nonhuman primates. KNDy neurons are thought to be located in the hypothalamus region of human brains due to conservation across most mammalian species. Other roles of KNDy neurons include influences on prolactin production; puberty; stress' effects on reproduction; and the control of thermoregulation.  GnRH pulse regulation  KNDy neurons control GnRH pulse generation by through release of three known peptides: neurokinin B (NKB), dynorphin and kisspeptin. NKB and dynorphin are the two peptides that regulate the secretion of kisspeptin. NKB is the stimulating peptide that initiates the pulsatile release of GnRH by activating NKB receptors, called TACR3, on mutually connected KNDy neurons to release kisspeptin in an autocrine signalling pathway. Kisspeptin then activates the GPR54 receptors on GnRH neurons inducing the pulsatile release of GnRH and on KNDy neurons, adding to the stimulatory effect of NKB. Eventually the pulse is terminated by dynorphin, which acts on Œ∫-opioid receptors (KOR) in KNDy neurons to inhibit NKB and kisspeptin secretion and inhibits GnRH secretion acting directly on GnRH neuron receptors.  Sexual dimorphism in KNDy neuron populations  KNDy neurons are most densely located in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the hypothalamus, but also exist in the rostral periventricular area of third ventricle (RP3V) and the preoptic area (POA). Expression of the KNDy peptides highlighted has been shown to differentiate between species, sexes, and with fluctuating steroidal hormonal levels. Improvements in immunohistochemistry and deep-brain imaging techniques have revealed information about KNDy cell populations and sexual dimorphism. Larger populations appear in the female ARC than in the male ARC. The RP3V is composed of the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (APVN) and the preoptic periventricular nucleus, where KNDy neurons are sexually dimorphic. KNDy populations and sexual dimorphism appear in most species studied, including humans, but presence in the RP3V is primarily associated with rodents, with similar sexual dimorphism.  Steroid hormone feedback  Negative feedback of steroid hormones in both males and females controls the pulsatile nature of GnRH secretion, subsequently increasing or decreasing the release of LH and FSH from the anterior pituitary. This is mediated by estrogen receptor Œ± (ERŒ±), expressed on KNDy neurons. The binding of estrogen or testosterone to this receptor in the ARC region inhibits KNDy neurons and therefore prevents GnRH release. KNDy neurons are involved in positive feedback of the HPG axis. This mechanism is best exemplified by the LH surge in the female reproductive cycle, where the increase of estrogen from the growing ovarian follicle causes positive feedback in the AVPV region, and subsequently a rise in LH from the pituitary.

Professor Eleonora Gabrielian is the president of the Armenian Botanical Society. She is a specialist in the fields of taxonomy, geography, evolutionary morphology and anatomy of plants. She has been awarded numerous awards and prizes during her career.  Biography  thumb = Early life = Eleonora Gabrielian was born in Yerevan on February 22, 1929 to Tzolak Gabrielian and Zvart Cholakian. Her mother was an English teacher, her father was an electrical engineer who was repressed in 1937, rehabilitated posthumously in 1956. In 1946, Gabrielian completed secondary school and entered the Biology and Soil Faculty of the Yerevan State University, where at that time A. L. Takhtajan was teaching. After 2 years, she transferred to the Biology and Soil Faculty of Moscow State University, where she graduated with honors in 1951. In 1952-1955, she completed her doctorate in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) at the Komarov Botanical Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences (Russian: –ë–æ—Ç–∞–Ω–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π –∏–Ω—Å—Ç–∏—Ç—É—Ç –∏–º. –í. –õ.–ö–æ–º–∞—Ä–æ–≤–∞ –†–ê–ù), in the plant systematics and geography department. During her doctorate studies, she met her future husband Vladislav Agababian, also a botanist, future professor, who would become one of the founders of the Armenian school of palynology. Under the guidance of A. L. Takhtajan, she successfully completed her Ph. D. thesis on \\"Caucasian representatives of the genus Sorbus L.\\". = Career = In 1955, Gabrielian returned to Armenia and entered the Institute of Botany of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Socialist Republic of Armenia as a junior researcher in the Department of Plant Systematics and Geography. In 1960, she became a senior researcher, in 1986 a leading researcher and in 1989 the head of the department of Plant Taxonomy and Geography in the Institute of Botany. Since 1989 she has been in charge of the Department of Systematics and Geography of the Institute of Botany of the Republic of Armenia and heading a multivolume edition of the Flora of Armenia. Thanks to numerous expeditions in Armenia and other regions of the Caucasus, as well as by studying extensive materials in various herbaria worldwide, Gabrielian successfully completed in 1974 a doctoral thesis on the topic \\"The genus Sorbus L. of western Asia and the Himalayas\\". In 1978, she published the fundamental monograph \\"Sorbus L. (Western Asia) and the Himalayas\\" \\"... which constitutes the gold fund of world literature on the systematics of flowering plants ...\\" (Bot. Journ. 1999\\\\. 84 (9): 133). In 1984 the book was awarded the Komarov Prize, the highest award of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. Being one of the main authors of the multivolume edition of Flora of Armenia, and later heading the edition, she has always intensively continued the systematic research of numerous complex groups of plants, such as ferns, Scrophulariaceae, Compositae, Liliaceae and Poaceae families. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the last volumes (9, 10, 11) of the \\"Flora of Armenia\\" were published abroad, through the publishing house Koeltz Scientific Books. During the times of the Iron Curtain, she worked with botanists from multiple Western countries. At the request of prof. P. H. Davis, Gabrielian prepared a revision of the genus Sorbus L. for the multivolume edition of \\"Flora of Turkey and the East Aegean Islands\\". Together with prof. W. Greuter, a modern catalog of Pteridophyta of the Armenian flora was compiled. Cooperation with Israeli colleagues prof. D. Zohary and O. Fragman-Sapir resulted in the publication of \\"Wild relatives of food crops native to Armenia and Nakhichevan\\" (2004) ‚Äì the first detailed list of descriptions and maps of wild relatives of cultivated plants, and \\"Flowers of Transcaucasus and Adjacent Areas\\" (2008), the first scientific publication, illustrated by color photographs of plants and landscapes. At the initiative of Gabrielian, a multi-year project began in order to create a compressed, easy-to-use, single-volume edition of the Flora of Armenia in three languages (Armenian, Russian, English) for the identification of plants. Long time collaboration with Carolyn Mugar and financial support of the Armenia Tree Project (ATP). = Protection of the nature in Armenia = Gabrielian is the author of the first \\"List of rare and endangered plants of Armenia\\" (1979), second edition of \\"Red Data Book\\" (1988) and author and scientific advisor of the last publication of \\"The Red Book of Armenia\\" (2010). Other works include: \\"Nature protection in Armenia\\" (1988), essays on all the protected territories of Armenia, in the book \\"Reserves of the Caucasus\\" (1990). In the 1980s, together with A. L. Takhtajan, she organized a series of speeches on television, radio and in the all-Union press to prevent the construction of a pumped storage power plant on the territory of the Khosrov Reserve. She took contributed to the set up of the Erebuni Reserve. She prevented the Artanish Reserve from being transferred to management under the military unit of the Ministry of Defense of Armenia, where it would have been used to construct a military facility. Since 2002, she has been a consultant in the two major organizations for nature protection: The Foundation for the Preservation of Wildlife and Cultural Assets (FPWC) and WWF participating in numerous projects on the study, conservation and sustainable use of natural resources of Armenia. In 2016, in collaboration with O. Fragman-Sapir and K. Manvelyan, the book \\"Green Armenia\\" was published with notes and illustrations of representatives of Armenian flora. = Personal life = During her student years, she traveled alone, with a herbarium bag on her shoulder, walking on foot throughout the Caucasus discovering the region with a very rich flora. Later on her travels took her throughout Great Britain, the Baltic states, the Carpathians, Central Asia, Iran and Kamchatka. She spent 5 months in the Indian Ocean on the research vessel \\"Acad. Vernadsky\\" in 1981. A year later, she participated in the expedition organized by A. Cronquist in the United States together with A. L. Takhtajan. In 1980, in Spain (Seville), she participated for the first time in the conference on the study of the Mediterranean flora OPTIMA. In 1989, she was elected a member of the Executive Council of the organization. Gabrielian was friends with Armenian artists such as Martiros Saryan (a portrait of her from his brush is kept in the National Gallery of Armenia), Minas Avetisyan, and Haroutiun Galentz.

Constance Qu√©niaux (9 July 1832 ‚Äì 7 April 1908) was a dancer at the Paris Opera Ballet and the likely model for Gustave Courbet's painting L'Origine du monde. Life and career Constance Qu√©niaux was born to Marie Catherine Qu√©niaux in Saint-Quentin on 9 July 1832. Her mother was unmarried and she grew up in poverty. She joined the ballet corps of the Paris Opera in 1847, performing minor roles in its repertoire. She rose to secondary soloist position along with Claudina Couqui, receiving acclaim. She combined her dance career with prostitution. By the age of 34, she had retired from the Opera and was eyeing the favour of an Ottoman diplomat, Halil ≈ûerif Pasha. Qu√©niaux was a model for several works, including the Portrait de Mademoiselle Constance Qu√©niaux, de l'Acad√©mie Imp√©riale de Musique (1867), by Jules-√âmile Saintin, Qu√©niaux in later life was well-off, owning a villa in Cabourg. She became a philanthropist, actively supporting, for instance, the Orphelinat des Arts, an institution for orphaned or abandoned children of artists. She died in Paris on 7 April 1908. In her will, she left a Courbet painting of camellias. This flower, since the publication of Alexandre Dumas fils' La Dame aux Cam√©lias had been associated with courtesans. L'Origine du monde  Halil ≈ûerif Pasha was a notable collector of arts. He commissioned Gustave Courbet to paint Qu√©niaux, whom he called his \\"lucky charm\\". The work L'Origine du monde hides the model's face. While her identity was known at the time, as Qu√©niaux grew respectable, the information was lost. Indeed, experts long identified the model with Joanna Hiffernan, an Irish model who was Courbet's lover. Correspondence between Alexandre Dumas and George Sand was discovered in 2018 by a French historian, Claude Schopp, referring to this painting. It mentions ‚ÄúOne does not paint the most delicate and the most sonorous interior of Miss Queniault (sic) of the Opera.‚Äù This combined with Qu√©niaux's bequest of Courbet's painting of camellias (associated with courtesans) strongly suggests that Constance Qu√©niaux was Courbet's model.

Biography McEvoy was born in Freshford in Somerset and studied at the Slade School of Art in London. Between 1900 and 1906 she was a regular exhibitor with the New English Art Club. In 1902 she married the artist Ambrose McEvoy and in due course gave up a full-time art career although she worked with her husband on at least one major project. In 1909 Ambrose McEvoy was commissioned to paint a series of decorations for St Columba's Church, Long Tower in Derry which were to consist of three original works and twenty- two copies of bible scenes as depicted by Old Masters. While Ambrose created the three original pieces, it is believed that Mary worked on the twenty-two copies, finding suitable sources, making cartoons and then painting enlarged versions onto copper panels for the church. After Ambrose died in 1927 Mary resumed painting and began exhibiting her work again. Between 1928 and 1938 she exhibited twelve works at the Royal Academy in London and also had works shown at the Paris Salon. During the 1930s Knoedlers Gallery in London showed a series of, mostly female, portraits by McEvoy. The Tate collection holds her 1901 painting Interior: Girl Reading and also a bust of her by the sculptor Jacob Epstein. Both the Hugh Lane Municipal Gallery of Modern Art in Dublin and the Southampton City Art Gallery hold examples of her later works.

It was designed by Nangle and Nurzey subsequently known as Henry E Budden & Nangle. and built from 1909 to 1946 by Michael Byrne. It is also known as The Renaissance Centre between 1985 and 1992. The property is privately owned. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 21 November 2003.  History  The Sisters of Charity were the first Order of Nuns to be established in Australia with their convent being founded at Parramatta in 1838. In the late 1890s the Sisters of Charity were seeking to found an order in the Blue Mountains to provide a place of respite for exhausted nuns \\"where they might find fresh vigour for God's work\\". It was also noted that there was no Catholic school in or near Katoomba, hence there was an opportunity for the nuns to regain their health and energy whilst conducting their appointed work. The Sisters rented a small cottage close to the Catholic Church and Presbytery in Katoomba and moved in in 1900. A new college called Mount St Mary's opened on the main Street of Katoomba in 1901, and in 1903 Mother Mary Eulalia was appointed Rectress of the college. The Mount St Mary's premises in town eventually proved inadequate for the rapidly increasing student base, so, in 1907, it was decided to purchase substantial acreage to the north of the railway station on which to build a brand new boarding house for girls and convent accommodation for the Sisters. Bridget McGuigan, Julia O'Connor and Helena Bourke of the Congregation of the Sisters of Charity (but denominated on the title deeds as spinsters) purchased the subject site (Lots 26 - 35) from Frank Grimley (The Grimley Subdivision) on 10 June 1907. The site included the cottage known as \\"The Rocks\\" (designed by Varney Parkes for John Fletcher M.A.) which was located in the south west corner of the site. The cottage and the lands the Sisters were to purchase are associated with Fletcher who had established a boarding college for boys in the mid 1880s called Katoomba College (later known as the Priory and then The Royal Palace) which was located on the opposite side of the road to where St Mary's now stands. Fletcher had purchased additional lands (future St Mary's lands) presumably to provide land for sporting activities, however, the depression of the 1890s led to the closure of his college and the sale of Lots 26 - 35 to Frank Grimley. When the Sisters made their purchase the land had largely been cleared and was characterised by open paddock with the exception of a number of mature eucalypts and \\"The Rocks\\". The following year on 24 June 1908, an additional were purchased from Frank Grimley adding orchards and vegetable gardens to an already spacious landscape. The land on which St Mary's College and Convent were to stand was first described in 1814 by George William Evans, Surveyor. The land purchased by the Sisters is associated with John Fletcher M.A. The foundation stone for the college and convent was laid by His Eminence, Cardinal Moran on 12 April 1909. At the foundation ceremony Cardinal Moran proposed that the college would be a monument to the district and further noted that \\"It would be would be difficult to find, in the many beautiful spots which Australia presents, anything which nature has lavished such an abundance of beautiful sights as the surroundings of Katoomba\\". The local community were encouraged to take a personal interest in the college which \\"not only will be an ornament to the town, but a living monument to that higher and better eductation without which no community could be considered progressive.\\" The building of Mount St Mary's Ladies' College, Katoomba, was completed with remarkable speed with boarding pupils being accepted by February, 1910. The original building was three floor levels, constructed of rendered brick with painted corrugated iron roof sheeting, and featuring decorative stucco, a tower housing the main staircase, and recessed colonnaded balconies at the first and second floor levels. Also included were small wings on both the eastern and western sides, as well as a Chapel on the western side. The building was designed by the architectural firm Nangle and Nurzey. The Architect James Nangle was responsible for the design of a number of projects for the Catholic Church, including the Sacred Heart Church, Darlinghurst, St Columba's Seminary, Springwood, and St Mary's Cathedral Girls School. With the establishment of the College the grounds were gradually developed to form a landscape with elements that were complementary to the style and character of the building, yet supplementary to the building form. This included low stone garden walls forming a series of informal grassed and cultivated terraces where ornamental trees and shrubs were placed. Linking these terraces were a series of paths and steps. A number of landscape features were progressively implemented including urns, a fountain, grotto and gazebo (thought to have come from the demolished \\"Royal Palace\\" across the road). By the 1940s the landscape around the College was well established with a mixture of exotic and native species. The exotic plantings to the south and the open pasture like qualities to the north were designed to ensure that the building dominated both the sphysical site and its surrounds. The original prospectus for the College highlighted the Sisters' progressive educational philosophy, curriculum, the therapeutic benefits of the location and the grandeur of the college. The college included an infant school and kindergarten, a middle school and the college which provided University classes to prepare students for entry to Arts, Science, Medicine, and Law or Teaching Training. The college prospered as an educational establishment through all the economic, political and social permutations of two World Wars. In 1923 the College sold a series of subdivided blocks including its Tennis Courts. The Tennis Courts were purchased by Katoomba Council. Also sold at this time was the cottage \\"The Rocks\\" which had been relocated to the north east corner of the property. In 1926 Mount St Mary's celebrated its silver jubilee and in commemoration a grotto was built in the front garden of the convent, housing a Carrara marble statue of Our Lady of Lourdes. The Sisters of Charity and pupils at the College were held in high esteem by the local community who felt a strong sense of connection and community ownership of the splendid college on the hill. The eight foot cross on the roof of the tower was illuminated in 1938 at the suggestion of a non Catholic community member and the costs defrayed by the local community. The illuminated cross was visible from many surrounding points to residents and travellers alike. Mount St Mary's provided a place of refuge in times of war and fire. When Australia and the Allies declared war on Japan on 9 December 1941, fears were held for those Orders living and working in close proximity to Sydney Harbour. As a consequence St Vincent's Convent which was located near war ships in the harbour decided to transfer the Novices, Postulants and the boarders temporarily to Katoomba. In 1957 when devastating bushfires gutted much of the township of Leura, the College became the temporary home for some of the Sisters and juniors of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart, from the Little Company of Mary, Leura, and other members of the Mountains community left homeless by the fires. Apart from the perceived dangers of city living the War years drew parents' attention to the safety of the Mountains and led to an increase in enrolments at the College. Hence, there was a need to increase accommodation for both students and Sisters. Works commenced in 1946 on a four-story extension to the original building to accommodate the increased demand. In 1965 Mount St Mary's became a regional girl's school catering for forms 1 - 4 and, with the closing of St Bernard's College, Katoomba, St Mary's became \\"co- educational\\". By 1973 the operation of the school appeared to be non viable and the Sisters withdrew from the education ministry at Mount St Mary's. The Archdiocese of Sydney took over at the end of 1973, however, as a result of declining enrolments (180 students) the school was finally closed down in 1974. The Sisters of Charity entered into an agreement with the Archdiocese whereby the premises would be used as centre for religious teaching and training purposes. In January 1978 the Congregation of the Sisters of Charity in Australia generously offered the property to the Archdiocese of Sydney as a gift, thus ending the congregation's historic ownership of the Mount St Mary's property. The Archdiocese continued to use the premises as an educational and religious retreat centre until 1984 when a fire order was placed on the building by the Board of Fire Commissioners and the building was closed down. As the cost of bringing the building up to standard was considered prohibitive the Church decided to sell and the college and land were put out to public tender. The tendering process failed and the property was eventually put on the market for $425,000. The fate of the site generated significant community concern in Katoomba and a number of options including the purchase of the site by the local Council were mooted but not realised. In 1985 the property was purchased by John Patterson, Pamela Ruth Patterson and Liborio Donivito with the intention of transforming Mount St Mary's into a tourist attracting \\"Creativity Centre\\" housing 30 craft areas, shops studios, galleries, performance and teaching areas. Work began in late 1985 to restore the site. The Renaissance Centre was opened by the Premier, the Hon Barrie Unsworth on 29 March 1987. In his speech the Premier said that \\"the Renaissance Centre represented a creative and valuable transformation of an historic building into a multi-functional community and tourist centre.\\" The property was subsequently sold to Crestown Pty Ltd in December, 1992. Since then, and despite the restoration and community goodwill, tenants began to vacate the Renaissance Centre. The last tenant to leave was the Ann Barker College of English. The restored property has since been vacant, and has been the subject of substantial vandalism in recent years.  Description  Mount St Marys Ladies College, early 1900s The property is located at 10 - 14 Civic Place Katoomba. The site is located at the northern side of the railway line, north- east of the Blue Mountains City Council complex and north-west of the Court House. The 1.652 hectare site is trapezoid in shape, with the former school and convent built into the western slope, facing north. The southern facade of the former school comprises the official entrance, and addresses a formal garden and courtyard with vehicular access. The building is built in the Federation Free Classical style. Its original form and composition is still evident and is a distinguished landmark in Katoomba, despite a modern extension. = Landscape = = Condition = As at 20 March 2003, 1910 Convent and College Building - Exterior / Interior: The building has been very badly vandalised both internally and externally. *1946 Convent extension - Exterior: Generally the 1946 extension appears in fair condition, although heavily vandalised. *1946 Convent extension - Interior: Internally the 1946 extension is in fair condition, although again heavily vandalised. *1960s Science Block: Generally the building is in fair condition, although vandalised. *1950s Primary School Bungalow: Externally the building appears in fair condition. Landscape: The majority of the landscape features established during the college years are in the main existent, despite being in poor condition. The landscape to the site as at November, 2002, is in the main particularly to the southern entry area, overgrown. The landscape layers of both pre and post College occupation are evident on site. Essentially the building retains a high degree of integrity in its external form, scale and character despite later alterations and additions, and vandalism over the recent years. The external materials of rendered brick walls. Decorative stucco elements, painted corrugated iron roof sheeting or terra cotta tiles, and timber windows essentially remains. The building retains its pattern and profile of balconies, althgough those on the northern side have either been infilled or obscured by the later restaurant addition. Similarly the tower remains as a dominant feature of the building, retaining its distinct and decorative elements. Windows at basement level along the southern fa√ßade have been infilled with brick forming vents. Internally the building has undergone some alteration, primarily during its incarnation as the Renaissance Centre. Many of the original features remain, however, including the moulded plaster and timber boarded ceilings to the original 1910 building, the chapel, profiled joinery and timber floors. There remains a number of fireplaces located throughout the building, which are in various states of integrity. The bathrooms located within the former convent at first and second floor levels also appear to date from their 1946 construction. The arched openings to the original northern and southern side walls at ground and first floor levels replaced the original pattern and profile of the 1910 windows and doors. There remains evidence of the original dividers, although the folding partitions have been removed, save for the ceiling beams which mark the locations. In 2003 a series of fires caused damage to some elements of the site including the central tower. = Modifications and dates = *1909 - 1910: Construction and opening of the College. *1920s: Construction of the porte cochere in front of the main entrance to the building on the southern side, including alterations to the original balustrade of the entrance stair (this structure was demolished in the 1980s). *1923: Relocation of the cottage The Rocks to the north east corner of the property. *1926: A grotto was built in the front garden of the convent to commemorate the Silver Jubilee of Mount St Mary's College. *1920s - 1930s: Infilling of the balconies at the ground and first floor level along the northern side of the 1910 building. *1946: The original building complex was extended to include a four-storey extension, constructed on a north-south axis, at right angles to the original school building, and projecting to form an informal north east facing courtyard. *1960s: A science wing was subsequently erected adjoining the east wing of the original 1910 building, and continuing in the same east-west plane. Alterations to provide internal access at the ground and first floor level. *1980s: Alterations for Renaissance Centre including: *Construction of a Kiosk and walkway from Civic Place; *Alterations to the partitions at basement floor 1910 building; *Alterations to the internal partitions, southern end of the 1946 extension. *New arched openings to the northern and southern side walls of the ground floor classroom, first floor dormitory and adjacent to the Chapel. *Construction of the glazed restaurant addition at basement level on the northern side of the 1910 building.  Heritage listing  As at 25 March 2003, Statement of Significance The place known as Mount St Mary's College and Convent and subsequently the Renaissance Centre is of State significance because of its connection over an extended period of time with the Congregation of the Sisters of Charity in Australia, the oldest such order in Australia, and with its unbroken association with education from 1909 - 1991. The physical location, expansive modified landscape setting, and imposing complex of ecclesiastical buildings dominated by a tower, lends Mount St Mary's great aesthetic significance in the cultural landscapes of the Blue Mountains. It remains a visually significant landmark at the eastern gateway to Katoomba and has great social significance for the former religious community, students, and wider Blue Mountains communities. The complex of buildings elegantly demonstrate the Federation Free Classical style ecclesiastical architectural language. In addition, the extensive hard and soft landscape design elements define a number of official, religious, utilitarian and recreational zones associated Catholic institutions. The scale and setting of Mount St Mary's reflects a significant period in the growth and development of Catholic educational institutions in NSW and their subsequent decline as a regional presence across the State. Mount St Marys College and Convent was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 21 November 2003 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Mount St Mary's College and Convent is associated with the significant historic stage in the development of the Blue Mountains as a place for education, accommodation, recreational activities, cultural extension, and pastoral care in the form of religion, all in a natural environment conducive to good health. Mount St Mary's shows evidence of the establishment (1909), growth (1946) and later decline (1964 - 1974) of a Catholic secondary school which for the majority of its existence was dedicated to the progressive education of young women. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Mount St Mary's College and Convent is of State significance for its association with the Congregation of the Sisters of Charity in Australia, and their progressive role in the education of young women in NSW during the 20th Century. Mount St Mary's is also associated with Mother Mary Michael McGuigan, Mother Superior of the Congregation in Sydney, Mother Mary Eulalia the first Rectress of the new college and Cardinal Patrick Moran who laid the foundation stone. Moran's episcopacy notably heralded a significant expansion of catholic educational services. The purpose built Mount St Mary's College and Convent is also associated with the ecclesiastical architectural works of the firm Budden and Nangle. The site on which St Mary's was established and developed is directly associated with the European founders of Katoomba - John Britty North, James Henry Neale, and Frank Grimley who contributed significantly to the development of Katoomba in the mid to late 19th century. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Mount St Mary's College and Convent is aesthetically distinctive as a visually prominent purpose built Catholic college and convent designed in the Federation Free Classical Style, set in an expansive and largely modified landscape designed to complement and enhance the visual prominence of the architecture. Due to its scale, prominent tower and siting on high ground it forms a significant landmark and civic presence at the eastern entrance to Katoomba. The view lines both into and out from the site are of high aesthetic significance. The Federation Free Classical style in uncommon in eastern Australia, and Mount St Mary's is a notable example of its use in country New South Wales. The unusually rapid construction programApril 1909 - February 1910 that enabled enrolments to be taken from February 1910 was a technical achievement given the magnitude of the development. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Mount St Mary's College and Convent has an important association with the Congregation of the Sisters of Charity in Australia and the broader Roman Catholic Church. Mount St Mary's has a strong association with the general community and other educational communities of the Blue Mountains through engagement via academic, sporting, cultural and economic activities, and the pastoral care of the Sisters of Charity. Mount St Mary's has an important association for female students from around the State who were entrusted to the care of the Sisters of Charity, evacuees from St Vincent's College Sydney during World War II, and members of the Blue Mountains community who were given shelter at the college following the catastrophic bushfires of 1957. Mount St Mary's also has significance to the broader Christian community of the Blue Mountains as attested to by the illumination of the cross on top of the tower, which was suggested by and paid for by the general community in 1938. As a significant religious and educational institution and prominent landmark, Blue Mountains residents have a strong sense of community ownership of the site by virtue of their engagement with the site over many years and its aesthetic appeal and dramatic visual prominence. As the Renaissance Centre, its association with artists, performers and the hospitality industry ensured its continuing importance to the social and cultural life of the Katoomba and wider Blue Mountains communities. In its phases of non-use, the vacated site has evoked strong community responses, reflecting a sense of ownership and concern, and a drive for the restoration of the landmark buildings and site. The Mount St Mary's College and Convent, in its phase as The Renaissance Centre, has had local representative social significance for the community of the Blue Mountains, and for its continued use for commercial purposes. It has local social significance for its contribution to the character and identity of the streetscape of the immediate vicinity, and as a focal point for the wider Blue Mountains communities, and regional and international tourists and students. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Research into the history of the Mount St Mary's site reveals its earlier association with education through its use, by pupils from John Walter Fletcher's Boys' College, as a sporting area. The site is also the last remaining significant parcel of land remaining from James Henry Neale's grant by purchase in 1876, which contributes to an understanding of the pattern of subdivisions in and around Katoomba. The site is also significant through its associative importance for the Katoomba and broader Blue Mountains communities, as a significant topographical feature and aesthetically appealing landmark The expansive landscape of St Marys College and Convent is significant both as a designed landscape and as an archaeological landscape. The largely intact curtilage provides significant evidence of the designed official, religious contemplative and recreational zones associated with Roman Catholic institutions, once an integral part of such institutions. The site has the potential to yield further information about significant garden and design elements such as the elegant gazebo which is thought to have come from the demolished \\"Royal Palace Katoomba\\" formerly the Katoomba College for Boys which was built and operated by John Fletcher MA. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Mount St Mary's College and Convent has rare significance as a purpose built boarding college for young women, with a progressive academic educational focus set within a framework of Roman Catholic spiritual ideology. The Mount St Mary's site represents one of the last large parcels of land to survive the subdivision patterns resulting naturally from the urban development and expansion of Katoomba. Mount St Marty's is the only surviving example of such a college for girls and convent complex in the Blue Mountains. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Mount St Mary's site is representative of, and attests to the importance of education to the local areas' economic growth, both as a Roman Catholic College, and subsequently, as The Renaissance Centre cultural centre for artists, including the Ann Barker College for English. The subject building and landscape have representative significance for their contribution to the development of structures designed for the purposes of offering regional private education.

It includes artificial materials with optical properties springing inspiration from living organisms. This differs from biophotonics which is the field of study on the development and application of optical techniques to observe biological systems. In living organisms, colours can originate from pigments and/or unique structural characteristics (structural coloration). Molecular biomimetics Molecular biomimetics involves the design of optical materials based on specific molecules and/or macromolecules to induce coloration. Pigment-inspired materials aiming for specific molecular light absorption have been developed as for example melanin-inspired films prepared by polymerization of melanin precursors such as dopamine and 5,6-dihydroxyindole to provoke color saturation. Materials based on the multi- layer stacking of guanine molecular crystals found in living organisms (e.g. fish and chameleons) have been proposed as potential reflective coatings and solar reflectors. Protein-based optical materials, for instance self- assembling reflectin proteins found in cephalopods and silk, have incited interest in artificial materials for camouflage systems, electronic paper (e-paper) and biomedical applications. Non-protein biological macromolecules such as DNA have also been utilized for bio-inspired optics. The most abundant biopolymer on earth, cellulose, has been also utilized as a principal component for bio-optics. Modification of wood or other cellulose sources can mitigate scattering and absorption of light leading to optically interesting materials such as transparent wood and paper. Bioinspired periodic/aperiodic structures Structural color is a type of coloration that arises from the interaction of light with nano-sized structures. This interaction is possible because these photonic structures are of the same size as the wavelength of light. Through a mechanism of constructive and destructive interference, certain colors get amplified, while others diminish. Photonic structures are abundant in nature, existing in a wide range of organisms. Different organisms use different structures, each with a different morphology designed to obtain the desired effect. Examples of this are the photonic crystal underlying the bright colors in peacock feathers or the tree-like structures responsible for the bright blue in some Morpho butterflies. An example of bio-inspired photonics using structures is the so-called moth eye. Moths have a structure of ordered cylinders in their eyes that do not produce color, but instead reduce reflectivity.

Three main forms of programming that occur due to changes in the maternal environment are: * Changes in development that lead to greater disease risk; * Genetic changes which alter disease risk; * Epigenetic changes which alter disease risk of not only the child but also that of the next generation - i.e. after a famine, grandchildren of women who were pregnant during the famine, are born smaller than the normal size, despite nutritional deficiencies having been fulfilled. These changes in the maternal environmental can be due to nutritional alteration, hormonal fluctuations or exposure to toxins.  History  = Dutch famine 1944‚Äì45 = In 1944‚Äì45, the German blockade of the Netherlands led to a lack of food supplies, causing the Dutch famine of 1944‚Äì45. The famine caused severe malnutrition among the population, including women in various stages of pregnancy. The Dutch Famine Birth Cohort Study examined the impact of lack of nutrition on children born during or after this famine. It showed that over the course of their life, these children were at greater risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and other non-communicable diseases. = Barker Hypothesis = In the 1980s, David Barker began a research study on this topic. The Barker Hypothesis, or Thrifty phenotype, forms the basis for much of the research conducted on fetal programming. This hypothesis states that if the fetus is exposed to low nutrition, it will adapt to that particular environment. Nutrients are diverted towards the development of the heart, brain, and other essential organs of the fetus. The body also undergoes metabolic alterations that ensure survival in spite of low nutrition but may cause problems in situations with normal or high nutrition. This leads to increased risk of metabolic syndrome.  Nutritional status  The developing fetus forms an impression of the world into which it will be born via its mother's nutritional status. Its development is thus modulated to create the best chance of survival. However, excessive or insufficient nutrition in the mother can provoke maladaptive developmental responses in the fetus, which in turn manifest in the form of post-natal diseases. It is possible that this has such a profound effect on the fetus‚Äô adult life that it can even outweigh lifestyle factors. = Excessive nutrition = Body mass index prior to pregnancy and weight gain during pregnancy are both linked to high blood pressure in the offspring during adulthood. Mouse models suggest that this is due to high levels of the fetal hormone leptin, which is present in the blood of individuals that are overweight or obese. There is a theory that this hormone has a negative impact on the regulatory systems of the fetus, and renders it impossible to maintain normal blood pressure levels. = Insufficient nutrition = Pre-eclampsia, involving oxygen deprivation and death of trophoblastic cells that make up most of the placenta, is a disease which is often associated with maladaptive long-term consequences of inappropriate fetal programming. Here, an inadequately developed and poorly functioning placenta fails to meet the fetus‚Äô nutritional needs during gestation, either by altering its selection for nutrients which can cross into fetal blood or restricting total volume thereof. Consequences of this for the fetus in adult life include cardiovascular and metabolic conditions.  Hormonal influence  A delicate balance of hormones during pregnancy is regarded as being highly relevant to fetal programming and may significantly influence the outcome on the offspring. Placental endocrine transfer from the mother to the developing fetus could be altered by the mental state of the mother, due to affected glucocorticoid transfer that takes place across the placenta. = Thyroid = Thyroid hormones play an instrumental role during the early development of the fetus's brain. Therefore, mothers suffering from thyroid-related issues and altered thyroid hormone levels may inadvertently trigger structural and functional changes in the fetal brain. The fetus is able to produce its own thyroid hormones from the onset of the second trimester; however, maternal thyroid hormones are important for brain development before and after the baby is able to synthesize the hormones while still in the uterus. Due to this, the baby may experience an increased risk of neurological or psychiatric diseases later in life. = Mental state = Mental state of the mother during pregnancy affects the fetus in the uterus, predominantly via hormones and genetics. The mother's mood, including maternal prenatal anxiety, depression and stress during pregnancy correlates with altered outcomes for the child. That being said, not every fetus exposed to these factors is affected in the same way and to the same degree, and genetic and environmental factors are believed to have a significant degree of influence.  Depression  Maternal depression poses one of the greatest risks for increased vulnerability to adverse outcomes for a baby that is developing in the uterus, especially in terms of susceptibility to a variety of psychological conditions. Mechanisms that may explain the connection between maternal depression and the offspring's future health are mostly unclear and form a current area of active research. Genetic inheritance that may be rendering the child more susceptible may play a role, including the effect on the intrauterine environment for the baby whilst the mother suffers from depression.  Stress  Stress suffered by the mother during pregnancy can have an adverse effect on the developing baby; it can manifest in the form of early labor and low birth weight, and can also induce a risk for psychiatric complications later in life. The new mother may suffer from after- effects too, such as postpartum depression, and subsequently may find parenting more difficult as compared to those who did not experience as much stress during their pregnancies.  Toxins  Toxins such as alcohol, tobacco and certain drugs to which the baby is exposed to during its development are thought to contribute to fetal programming, especially via alterations to the HPA axis. If the exposure occurs during a critical phase of fetal development, it could have drastic and dire consequences for the fetus. = Alcohol = Prenatal and/or early postnatal exposure to alcohol (ethanol) has been found to have a negative effect on child's neuroendocrine and behavioral factors. Alcohol passes through the placenta on being ingested by the mother during her pregnancy, and makes its way to the baby in utero. Changes posed to the fetus through ethanol exposure may significantly effect growth and development; these are collectively known as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). The exact interaction between ethanol and the developing fetus is complex and largely uncertain, however, several direct and indirect effects have been observed as the fetus matures. Predominant among these are irregularities in the fetus's endocrine, metabolic and physiological functions. = Smoking = The negative consequences of smoking are well-known, and these may be even more apparent during pregnancy. Exposure to tobacco smoke during pregnancy, commonly known as in utero maternal tobacco smoke exposure (MTSE), can contribute towards various problems in babies of smoking mothers. About 20% of mothers smoke whilst pregnant and this is associated with increased risk of complications, such as preterm birth, decreased fetal growth leading to lower birth weight, and impaired fetal lung development. = Drugs = There is evidence pointing towards pharmacological programming of the fetus during the first trimester. One type of drugs which is suspected of influencing the developing baby when used during pregnancy is anti-hypertensive drugs. Pre- eclampsia (a condition of hypertension during pregnancy), is a serious problem for the majority of pregnant mothers and can predispose the mother to a variety of complications, including increased risk of mortality and problems during parturition.

The detailed information eases morphological selection of embryos with high implantation potential to be used in In-Vitro Fertilisation treatment.  Technology  The traditional method for selection of embryos to be used for embryo transfer in fertility treatments such as IVF, involves assessing the morphology of a fertilized egg at crucial time points under a microscope. The incorporation of time lapse imaging tools in an incubator is a novel technology that allows images of embryo development to be captured frequently. This together with softwares allows embryologists and clinicans to interpret the embryo development information captured and select embryos for transfer in IVF treatment. Research for an algorithm to select a single embryo that would lead to the best clinical pregnancy outcome is underway.  Morphology  Morphology of the embryo is studied in scientific research and often marked by stages. A flow chart summarizing the stages in morphology of the embryo. For further details of the processes that occur within each stage, see Human embryogenesis. 1\\\\. Fertilization After the egg is fertilized by the sperm, a zygote (single diploid cell) is formed. At this stage, it should have two pronuclei, one of each derived from the egg and the sperm cell respectively and two tiny cells called polar bodies. 2\\\\. Cleavage This begins when the zygote divides into two cells via mitosis. The division continues such that each cell divides into another two cells, which results in a multiplying effect. 3\\\\. Morula The ball of cells formed after the multiple divisions is called a morula. It consists of about 16-32 cells in a ball within a translucent, elastic layer called the zona pellucida. It will then undergo compaction which is a process where the cells bind firmly together and continue to develop into a blastocyst. 4\\\\. Blastocyst Blastulation is marked by the appearance of a fluid-filled cavity (blastocoel) surrounded by a single layer of cells called the trophectoderm and the inner cell mass. The fetus is developed from the inner cell mass while the placenta is derived from the trophectoderm. File:Zygote1.jpgZygote File:Human Embryo.pngCleavage Stage Embryo File:Blastocyst English.svgBlastocyst  Benefits  Morphokinetics has the potential advantage over standard morphological evaluation as it does not use a static form of observation to evaluate a highly dynamic process. High resolution images obtained at frequent time points provides greater detail of the events involved in embryo development. This higher degree of detail and parameters used to assess embryo viability reduces the biased variability in embryo selection by an embryologist, allowing for a more standardised method of embryo quality evaluation and selection for implantation. This also provides a quantifiable method for analysis rather than just qualitative. Clinicians are given more time to evaluate an image rather than a time pressured evaluation of an embryo which must be quickly put back into incubation; resulting in a reduced degree of human error. Potential damage to otherwise viable embryos is also reduced due to minimized fluctuation of optimal culture conditions . These factors such as pH and temperature, if altered, have been shown to influence preimplantation development of a blastocyst. Both the mother and child may benefit from this new method of IVF treatment. Transfer of the single, highest potential embryo into the mother reduces the likelihood of multiple gestations, which limits future complications such as preterm labour. This method reduces time spent and consequently lowering overall costs. Greater understanding and evidence for embryo morphokinetics can help improve current knowledge of embryo development and factors influencing successful clinical pregnancy outcome.  Limitations  Although morphokinetics has its advantage in terms of selecting embryos for implantation, the technology is unable to deselect all abnormal embryos. There is also a struggle to find a universal algorithm as attempts to validate published algorithms have proved unsuccessful. More work needs to be done in the scientific community, working as a cohesive unit to define the best possible algorithm that could lead to a single successful pregnancy. The benefits of using morphokinetics in terms of improving clinical outcomes of IVF is still very unclear. A meta-analysis published in 2017, supported the idea of clinical benefits of time-lapse culture with morphokinetic embryo selection in IVF, reporting reduced early pregnancy loss, higher ongoing pregnancy and higher live birth rates. However, the studies included in the meta analysis were carried out in selected populations and were of dubious quality, meaning we can not rely on this as conclusive evidence that IVF outcomes are improved by using morphokinetic embryo selection and time-lapse technology instead of standard morphological evaluation. Apart from this, there is limited reviewed evidence to support the clinical benefits of morphokinetics and so robust prospective studies reporting clinical outcomes must be carried out before it can be concluded that morphokinetics when combined with time-lapse technology has the ability to improve clinical outcomes of IVF.

It has been renovated into apartments. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. History John C. Berridge was born in Flint in 1879 to Walter Berridge, who owned a local store dealing in groceries, drugs, and meats. John attended the Detroit College of Medicine, graduating in 1900, and went on to become a pharmacist. He returned to Flint in 1908 and became a partner in the Flint Drug Company, eventually becoming sole owner of the company. Flint at the beginning of the twentieth century was experiencing explosive growth tied to the growth of the automotive industry. The city's population increased from under 40,000 in 1910 to over 150,000 in 1930. This increase in population severely crimped the housing supply in the area, particularly for auto workers newly arrived in town. Berridge first entered the real estate market in 1919, when he purchased and moved into the Tinlinn Apartments, an upscale apartment building on Garland Street. In 1926, he hired contractor John A. Pearl of Detroit to construct a large hotel/apartment building on the lot next door to the Tinlinn. The Berridge Hotel opened in 1928 as a lower-end residence hotel, offering reasonable weekly rates; it was likely marketed toward newcomers to town. Berridge operated the hotel until 1938, when Citizens Bank foreclosed on both it and the Tinlinn. C.J. Buehlmann, manager of Flint's Capital Hotel, purchased the hotel and ran it until his death in 1957, after which it was run by his wife and daughter. After the Buehlmanns, a series of reality companies operated the hotel until 1980, when Mr. and Mrs. Walter Drawl purchased the hotel. The Drawls ran it until 2006, with ling haul truck drivers forming much of their clientele. The hotel was purchased by the Genesee County Land Bank in 2006. After a $6 million renovation that converted it into 17 loft apartments, the building reopened as the Berridge Place in 2008. Description The Berridge Hotel is a 3-1/2-story, flat-roof, red-orange brick hotel building, built in a U shape. The main facade is seven bays wide, with a single central entrance framed with limestone pilasters. The center entrance is flanked by two storefronts, each one story high and three bays wide, with limestone piers at the corners. A brick signband with a limestone cornice separates the first floor from the upper floors. The upper floors have window openings with limestone sills, and limestone quoining on the corners of the building. An architrave band, brick frieze, and projecting cornice runs along the top.

The public learned of Dragonfly's existence in August 2018, when The Intercept leaked an internal memo written by a Google employee about the project. In December 2018, Dragonfly was reported to have \\"effectively been shut down\\" after a clash with members of the privacy team within Google. However, according to employees, work on Dragonfly was still continuing as of March 2019, with some 100 people still allocated to it. In July 2019, Google announced that work on Dragonfly had been terminated.  Development  The Dragonfly search engine was reportedly designed to link users' phone numbers to their search queries and censor websites such as Wikipedia and those that publish information about freedom of speech, human rights, democracy, religion, and other issues considered sensitive by the Chinese government. It is not designed to notify searchers when the information they want has been censored. On September 21, 2018, The Intercept reported on an internal memo authored by a Google engineer which contained details about the project. According to a transcript of a July 18 meeting published by The Intercept, Google's search engine chief Ben Gomes stated that although the future was \\"unpredictable\\", he wanted the app to be ready to launch in \\"six to nine months\\". Google executives stated in 2018 that Dragonfly was \\"exploratory\\", \\"in early stages\\" and that Google was \\"not close to launching a search product in China\\". In a mid-October 2018 presentation, Google CEO Sundar Pichai discussed Dragonfly, stating, \\"We don't know whether we could or would do this in China, but we felt it was important for us to explore.\\" He praised the prototype, saying it would provide better information to users than do the other search engines currently operating in China. He specifically highlighted Google's ability to provide accurate search results regarding the efficacy of certain medical treatments, alluding to the death of Wei Zexi, a Baidu user who died after receiving an experimental cancer treatment that he had learned of via a promoted result on that search engine. He also said that the scope of the censorship carried out by the Dragonfly prototype would be limited: if launched, the search engine would return results for 99% of queries by Chinese citizens and leave only 1% unanswered. He acknowledged that, at one point, 100+ people were working on Dragonfly. In late November 2018, an engineer who worked on Dragonfly told The Intercept that Google had shut their privacy and security teams out of the project. However, a director of security and privacy at Google said she \\"saw no sidelining whatsoever.\\" Google issued a statement, saying privacy reviews were \\"non-negotiable\\". In late November, an open letter to the public was published on Medium signed by hundreds of Google employees in opposition to the ‚ÄúDragonfly‚Äù search engine. The employees felt that this search engine violated the user's privacy and did not align with the values of the company that they agreed to work for. The employees felt that this search engine would cause oppression among the Chinese citizens and abused human rights‚Äîwhich is not a part of Google's company values. Previously, Google stayed out of the Chinese market because they did not want to have to alter their values on human rights and privacy to comply with the Chinese government, so when the news broke about the search engine, many employees agreed to publicly sign a letter to show their alliance with Amnesty International to show their opposition to the project.  Historical background and precedent  Google's relations with China have been fraught since the tech giant's arrival there in 2006. Google's first China-specific platform, Google.cn, was also a self-censored one: like the Dragonfly prototype, it was engineered so as not to return results for topics blacklisted by the Chinese government. Unlike Dragonfly, though, Google.cn was set up to notify searchers when the results they sought had been removed. In response to criticism over Google.cn at the time of its launch, Google asserted that \\"while removing search results is inconsistent with our mission, providing no information is more inconsistent with our mission,\\" referring to the alternative of not servicing Chinese users at all. Google also downplayed the extent of the new search engine's censorship, reminding users that it also removes search results from its German, French, and U.S. platforms in order to comply with local government regulations in those countries. Ultimately, Google.cn received tepid acceptance: some commentators even praised the search engine with the logic that Chinese citizens, through conducting searches and observing which results had been removed, could better their understanding of what it was their government did not want them to see. In January 2010, Google fell victim to Operation Aurora, a sophisticated series of cyberattacks carried out by Chinese hackers who targeted a number of major U.S. corporations, including Yahoo, Adobe, Dow Chemical, and Morgan Stanley. The hackers stole Google source code and gained access to the Gmail accounts of several prominent Chinese human rights activists who were living abroad. In response to both the attack and what then-Google-CEO Sergey Brin called a \\"broader pattern\\" of China's surveillance of human rights activists, Google discontinued Google.cn and began rerouting Chinese users to Google.hk, an uncensored (at least on Google's end) search engine based out of Hong Kong. Almost immediately, the Chinese government blocked Chinese users' access to certain results produced by that engine. Brin justified Google's sudden policy switch by arguing that operating a search engine in China no longer aligned with Google's goals of advancing internet freedom, as the company had been seeing a daily increase in requests for certain topics or search terms to be censored, rather than the other way around. Google faced widespread criticism for the decision which some commentators called a \\"face saving capitulation\\": an attempt by Google to take a stand for internet freedom while still preserving their share of the Chinese market. Other critics alleged that Google's shuttering of Google.cn was simply a well-timed business move‚Äîmade because the company had only a 35% market share after four years in China‚Äîthat had little to do with either Operation Aurora or Beijing's growing demands for censored content.  Risks and rewards  From March 2010, when Google stopped servicing China via Google.cn, to 2018, China's internet user population has increased by 70%, to 772 million users. This means that, for Google, who makes most of its revenue from advertisements run on its search engines, the potential profits of reentering the Chinese search engine market are enormous. Yet, analysts have suggested that if Google does reenter China‚Äîeither with the Dragonfly prototype or a different search model‚Äîit might initially struggle to meet its revenue goals. Google's advertising strategy is highly targeted: it involves collecting data on users' search histories and using that data to present users with advertisements which are applicable to them. Google has missed out on nearly a decade of data on prospective Chinese users, making that advertising strategy difficult to execute, at least immediately. Additionally, it is not clear that Google's search product would be able to outcompete Chinese search engines like Baidu and Sogou, which have coveted partnerships with the technology platforms Windows and WeChat, respectively. Because Google is not available for users in China, the company wanted to find a way to become a part of the Chinese market. The Google search engine was designed specifically to be used on an Android smartphone. With the download of this application on the smartphone, the application would easily be allowed to track an individual's searches. This could cause a concern for the consumers in China because if they were to search for something that was illegal within the Chinese government, this information could cause interrogation or other legal consequences for the users in China. The Google search engine was also planning to alter the accuracy of the weather and air quality index that would be provided to the consumers in China. The change in information would downplay the actual air pollution to keep the citizens in China less informed about the actual quality of their air.  Responses to the project  = Criticism = Project Dragonfly has been subject to harsh criticism, particularly from Google employees and users. Shortly after publication of The Intercept article leaking details of the project, 1,400 Google employees signed a letter demanding more transparency about Dragonfly, as well as more say in the nature of the work done by Google in general. In September 2018, Amnesty International released an open letter to Google's management condemning the project as an \\"alarming capitulation by Google on human rights\\" and calling for its cancellation. At the end of November 2018, a number of Google employees authored a Medium article in support of Amnesty International's letter. They argued that a Dragonfly launch would set a precedent for the implementation of censored Google services in other countries, and expressed concern about Dragonfly's potential to contribute to a program of widespread state surveillance in China. China is rumored to have been developing a \\"social credit system\\" which assigns each citizen a \\"score\\" based on their actions, conducted both online and offline. Purchasing alcohol and jaywalking reduce a citizen's score, for example, while purchasing diapers increases it. Chinese corporations are required by law to disclose the consumer data they collect to the government, presumably in part so it can be used to calculate these scores. Analysts have theorized that, if Dragonfly becomes a reality, Google could be compelled to do the same. Following the publication of a second The Intercept article about the project, which alleged that Google bypassed standard security and privacy checks of Dragonfly, Google engineer Liz Fong-Jones tweeted a proposal for Google employees worldwide to go on strike. She wrote that the \\"red line\\" for initiating the strike will be crossed if Google launches Dragonfly without conducting a thorough security and privacy review, or if evidence emerges that members of Google's Security and Privacy team were coerced into approving the project. Fong-Jones has started a preemptive \\"strike fund\\" intended to support Google employees should they leave their positions, to which Google employees have already donated over $200K. Politicians have also spoken out. In early October 2018, Mike Pence called for an end to the development of Dragonfly, and said that, if launched, it would strengthen Communist Party censorship and compromise the privacy of Chinese customers. In early December 2018, Senator Mark Warner (D-VA) criticized both Beijing and Google over the project, stating that Dragonfly evidences China's success at \\"recruit[ing] Western companies to their information control efforts.\\" Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph Dunford also criticized Google, stating that \\"it‚Äôs inexplicable\\" that Google continues investing in autocratic communist China, which uses censorship technology to restrain freedoms and crackdown on online speech, and has long history of intellectual property and patent theft that hurts U.S. companies, while simultaneously not renewing further research and development collaborations with the Pentagon. He said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure that people at Google will enjoy a world order that is informed by the norms and standards of Russia or China.‚Äù He urged Google work directly with the U.S. government instead of making controversial inroads into China. = Support = Amid widespread backlash, one contingent of Google employees has expressed its support for the project. In late November 2018, a Google employee submitted an unsigned letter to TechCrunch, an online technology news platform, calling for work on Dragonfly to continue because the project aligns with Google's mission to \\"organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful.\\" The letter states that, although Dragonfly has the power to \\"do more harm than good,\\" it is valuable in that it can shed light on \\"how different approaches may work out in China.\\" Three anonymous Google employees from China said they supported the project, citing a need for a competitor to the Chinese search engine Baidu.  Termination of project  In testimony given to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee in July 2019, Karan Bhatia, the vice president of public policy at Google, announced that work on Dragonfly had been \\"terminated\\". While the launch of the Google search engine, ‚ÄúDragonfly‚Äù was terminated, Google did not promise that any work with Chinese censorship in the future will be out of the question. However, there are no current plans in the making. Bhatia made a comment during his U.S. Senate Judiciary hearing that ‚Äúany decision to ever look at going back into the China search market is one that we would take only in consultation with key stakeholders.‚Äù This leaves the door open for further projects if they choose to do so in the future, however, ‚ÄúDragonfly‚Äù has been terminated, and there are no current plans to begin another project at the moment.

Abd al-Rauf ibn Ali al- Fansuri al-Sinkili (spelling variation Abdurrauf Singkil, 1615‚Äì1693 CE) was a well-known Islamic scholar and the mufti of Aceh Sultanate. He was the confidant of Sultana Safiyat al-Din. He was considered the first person to spread the Shattari Sufi order in Indonesia and Southeast Asia. Many of his students also became disseminators of Islam. Al-Sinkili was believed to be a native of Singkil, a town on the western coast of Aceh. Beside being called Al-Sinkili, his other attribution (Arabic: nisba) was Al-Fansuri, which relates him to the town of Barus. He could be related to another prominent Sufi poet and writer from that town, Hamzah Fansuri.  Education  Al- Sinkili was thought to depart to Arabia around 1642. He studied various knowledge of Islamic teaching for around twenty years in many places, including in Doha, Yemen, Jeddah, Mecca, and mostly Madina. He listed in his book Umdat al-Muhtajin ila Suluk Maslak al-Mufridin 19 teachers and 27 other scholars with whom he had personal contacts. His two most respected teachers were Ahmad al-Qushashi and Ibrahim al-Kurani. Al-Qushashi gave Al-Sinkili authorization (ijazah) as the formal successor (khalifa) for Shattariyya and Qadiriyya. After Al-Sinkili went back to Aceh, he maintained correspondence with Al-Kurani, and asked for Al-Kurani's opinions regarding religious matters.  Works  Al-Sinkili wrote in Malay and Arabic, with topics including Qur'anic interpretation (tafsir), scholastic theology (kalam), sufism (tasawwuf), and Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh). He wrote around twenty- two books. One of his famous book was titled Mir'√¢t al Thullab fi Tasyil Ma'rifah al Ahk√¢m al Syar'iyyah li al M√¢lik al-Wahhab. The book discusses the many aspects of fiqh, such as rules and issues concerning marriage, financial transactions, and inheritance. Some selected titles of his works, as follows: * Mir'√¢t al Thullab fi Tasyil Ma'rifah al Ahk√¢m al Syar'iyyah li al M√¢lik al- Wahhab (fiqh rules for various activities) * 'Umdat al-Muhtajin ila Suluk Maslak al-Mufridin (sufism) * Lubb al-Kashf wa al-Bayan li Ma Yarahu al- Muhtadar bi al-'Iyan (dhikr prayer for death preparation) * Kitab al-Fara'idh (inheritance law) * Tarjuman al-Mustafid (Qur'an exegesis, mostly from tafsir al-Jalalayn) * Al-Arba'in Haditsan li al-Imam al-Nawawiyah (explanation of Al- Nawawi's forty hadiths) * Al-Mawa'iz al-Badi' (hadith qudsi collection) * Kifayat al-Muhtajin ila Masharab al-Muwahhidin al-Qa'ilin bi Wahdat al-Wujud (sufism) * Daqa'iq al-Huruf (sufism) * Risalah Adab Murid akan Syaikh (sufism) * Risalah Mukhtasarah fi Bayan Shurut al-Shaykh wa al-Murid (sufism)  Teaching  His interpretation shows tendency of neo-sufism, and combining exoteric and esoteric aspects of Islam. As a sheikh of the Shattariyya, Al- Sinkili did not approve of wujudiyya (pantheism) teaching, but he did not openly oppose it like Al-Raniri.

She is the first female physicist to be given this honour.  Life and career  Aditi Sen De was born in Kolkata, India to Lakshmi Dey, a school teacher and Ajit Kumar Dey, a state-government employee. She did her schooling at Sarada Ashrama Balika Bidyalaya, Kolkata, and completed her higher secondary from Sakhawat Memorial Govt. Girls High School, Kolkata in 1992. With a strong passion and high proficiency for mathematics, she joined Bethune College, University of Calcutta to obtain a Bachelor of Science with honours in Mathematics. Subsequently, she joined the prominent Applied Mathematics department of the Rajabazar Science College, University of Calcutta, where she pursued her interests in quantum and statistical physics. She received her master's degree in 1997, and after a short period of research work in India, moved to Gda≈Ñsk, Poland to work with Marek ≈ªukowski at the University of Gda≈Ñsk, where she received her PhD in January 2004. Following her doctoral studies she moved to Hannover, Germany as a Humboldt Research Fellow to work with Maciej Lewenstein at the Leibniz University. Thereafter, she joined ICFO - The Institute of Photonic Sciences at Barcelona, Spain to continue her research on quantum information theory, condensed matter and statistical physics. She won the prestigious Ram√≥n y Cajal research fellowship during her time in Spain. Upon returning to India in 2008, she briefly joined the School of Physical Sciences at Jawaharlal Nehru University as an Assistant Professor in Physics, before moving to Harish-Chandra Research Institute, Allahabad in 2009, where she is currently a Professor in Physics. Aditi De has published more than 100 research articles in eminent peer-reviewed journals, and has also collaborated with several world-renowned physicists. She is married to fellow physicist Ujjwal Sen, who is also a Professor of Physics at Harish-Chandra Research Institute in Allahabad, India.  Research  De started her research in the field of quantum information theory during her postgraduate studies in Kolkata, and went on obtain her doctorate in 2004 at the University of Gda≈Ñsk. The field of quantum information and computation was still in its early days, and Gda≈Ñsk, Poland was one of the main research centres in the world, where important work on the theory of quantum entanglement was being done. In collaboration with her supervisor Marek ≈ªukowski, and other eminent physicists such as Ryszard Horodecki, Pawe≈Ç Horodecki, Micha≈Ç Horodecki and her husband, Ujjwal Sen, she worked on some fundamental problems on entanglement theory, quantum cryptography and quantum communication. After her stint in Gda≈Ñsk, she joined the group of Maciej Lewenstein in Hannover, Germany and later in ICFO - The Institute of Photonic Sciences in Castelldefels near Barcelona, Spain, where she spend a considerable period of her early research career. During this period, De consolidated her research on quantum information, while contributing heavily to new research directions that were opening in the interface of quantum information and many-body quantum physics. In particular, her research focused on the study of quantum phase transitions using entanglement as a key figure of merit. After a brief stint as a faculty member in Jawaharlal Nehru University, De moved to Harish-Chandra Research Institute in Allahabad, where along with physicists Ujjwal Sen and Arun Kumar Pati, she started the Quantum Information and Computation group in 2009, under the Physics Division at the institute. Over the last few years, several young researchers have completed their doctoral as well as postdoctoral research at the group, resulting in more than 50 publications in well-known journals in physics. The group has also hosted several conferences and workshops, with participants and speakers from all around the world. In recent years, De has contributed significantly to the understanding of quantum information and communication, in particular the formulation of a computable entanglement measure and a novel density- matrix recursion method.

The track is also known as the Warragamba Dam - Burragorang Valley - Wentworth Falls Track. The property is owned by the Sydney Catchment Authority, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 November 1999.  History  One of the first places in the Gundungurra traditional homelands that most appealed to the Anglo-Celt settlers were the river flats of the Burragorang Valley (now flooded under Warragamba Dam). Even before the valley was officially surveyed in 1827-8, many early settlers were already squatting on blocks that they planned to officially occupy following the issue of freehold title grants. From the Burragorang Valley and using Aboriginal pathways, other valleys to the west were occupied and developed by the settlers with construction of outstations and stock routes. These cattle entrepreneurs were then followed by cedar-wood extractors and miners. The Gundungurra traditional owners resisted the taking of their lands, and, relying on various laws of the colony at the time, continually applied for official ownership. Although their individual claims failed, in some kind of recognition of the significance of the designated tracts of land claimed, six Aboriginal Reserves (under the control of the NSW Aborigines Protection Board) were formally declared in the Burragorang Valley. Even after these reserves were revoked, many of the traditional owners remained, quietly refusing to leave their traditional homelands. Finally pushed into the \\"Gully\\", a fringe development in West Katoomba from about 1894, the Gully community stayed together for more than 60 years until dispossessed of the Gully by the then Blue Mountains Shire Council so a group of local businessmen could develop a speedway that became known as the Catalina Race Track. The Gully people kept talking about areas of land they had walked in as children - the nearby Megalong and Kanimbla Valleys and the Burragorang Valley. They knew of the profound significance of these valleys for their parents and grandparents.Johnson, 2009, 4  Description  The track was built by the Pearce family around 1870 using packed stone and earth. The track is substantially intact. The track leads to the Wentworth Falls in the Burragorang Valley. The heritage listing by the New South Wales Office of Environment and Heritage gives the primary address of the track as \\"Coxs River Arms, Lake Burragorang, Warragamba Dam, NSW.\\" However, when the co-ordinates provided in the article (Lat: -33.8548514027 Long: 150.3385892100) are searched in Google maps, the point is shown as being on the western side of the Kedumba River, near its junction with Coxs River Arm. The river must be crossed to walk to Wentworth Falls. A logical starting point for the track is at the point where Kedumba Valley Road nearly touches Coxs River Arm, at co- ordinates -33.860317, 150.349545 (provided by Google maps). From this point, Kedumba Valley Road proceeds to its junction with Tableland Road, which then proceeds to the Great Western Highway at Wentworth Falls, a distance of about 25km. The heritage listing states that the track is a \\"former walking track and road.\\" The Kedumba River crossing campground is situated about 16km from Wentworth Falls and 9km from Coxs River Arm. Public access is prohibited along part of the track, below the campground.  Heritage listing  The track is a historically significant archaeological relic built by Europeans as a route of transportation on settlement of the Burragorang Valley. It is representative of a very early form of road construction, evidenced by its design and siting. It has immense historical value as it facilitated the European exploration and expansion of the valley. There are anecdotal linkages to the Pearce family, who were active settlers within the upper reaches of the Blue Mountains. It is a significant component of the cultural landscape and is understood to be exceedingly rare because of the high level of intactness noted in the remaining fabric. Track was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 November 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. This item is assessed as historically rare statewide.

A successful self-made man, Khoury managed to build a large commercial and industrial empire, and was one of Lebanon's most well-established businessmen from the 1950s to the 1970s. Khoury was an important figure of the Lebanese ruling elite in the second half of the 20th century. He played a decisive role in the development of economic legislation, and used his expertise in the resolution of several major national crises. Biography = Early life = Boutros el-Khoury as a child, with his mother. Boutros el-Khoury with his spouse and children. Khoury was born in 1907 in the village of Karm Sadde, in the Zghorta District (North Lebanon), the son of Salim and Myriam el-Khoury. His family hailed from the Lebanese diaspora in the French colonies of West Africa, with some members, including his father, residing in Senegal . Khoury lost his parents at an early age: his father died abroad on the day he was born, while his mother died when he was three years old. Khoury was subsequently raised first by his grandparents and then by his paternal aunt, Sayde Khoury, while his father's uncle, Abbas Abboud, who resided in Senegal, supported him financially. It was Abboud who initiated Khoury to the world of business and commerce early on in his life. =Education= Khoury studied at the Mar Yaacoub school in his home village and graduated from the al-Alam school in the village of Daraya, Zghorta. Business career Khoury pursued a career in business, and by the 1960s had become one of the wealthiest men in Lebanon thanks to his investments in various sectors of the economy. Khoury's career began at the age of 20. He started out in the oil business, dividing his time between his home village and Tripoli until, the beginnings of the 1930s, he moved permanently to North Lebanon‚Äôs capital, where it was easier for him to run his business and broaden his contacts. He then shifted easily from trade to industry and conducted many successful partnerships with well-established businessmen in various fields, founding companies such as the Stephan and Khoury company (created with Joseph and Sayed Stephan of Kfarsghab), the Kfoury‚ÄìKhoury company (founded with Al Kfoury from Khenchara, Metn District), the \\"Al Ghazzal Transports\\" with Ghattas el-Murr, and Fadel Al-Ghandour from Tripoli, among others. =La Kadisha= In front of \\"La Kadisha\\" with various political figures. Over the course of the 1920s, Khoury gained a thorough understanding of financial investment. In accordance with the traditional role played at that time by the Lebanese diaspora in the country's economy, the young sheikh reinvested the money he received from his family abroad, including his great-uncle Abboud from Senegal, in various local businesses. In this respect, his experience in the hydroelectric company \\"La Kadisha\\" highlighted early on his innate talents as a businessman. The company had been founded in 1924 by prominent figures in Bsharri, such as the Keirouz and Geagea families, with the Maronite Archbishop of Tripoli, Anthony Peter Arida, also playing an important role. Under the French Mandate, the company had obtained the concession to provide electricity from the Kadisha Valley to the rest of North Lebanon. First introduced into the company through his uncle Abbas, Khoury quickly rose through its ranks, and in 1929, at the age of 22, was elected to the administrative council. In 1929, La Kadisha merged with the Abu Ali hydroelectric plant, the power concession for which had been granted to the Stephan brothers. On 10 August 1930, Khoury was re-elected to the new council. He gradually acquired a majority stake in the company, until on 14 May 1953, he bought the majority of shares owned by the French shareholders of the companies La Pyr√©n√©enne and La Toulousaine. He then became president of the company. Khoury's years working in the administration of La Kadisha had a significant impact on his economic and political outlook. The economic thought of Albert Naccache, author of La Kadisha hydroelectric project, was especially influential. Naccache advocated greater industrial development in Lebanon, contrary to the widespread ideology at the time that was influenced by the ideas of Michel Chiha, according to which Lebanon was a \\"merchant republic\\" devoid of any raw materials. Naccache called for the establishment of a large network of hydroelectric power plants across the country that would be financed and managed entirely by Lebanese capital and executives. This experience gave Khoury a taste for industrial adventure and contributed to his grander vision for the national economy. =Agriculture= The young Sheikh Boutros el-Khoury. Khoury's interest in agriculture also began at an early age, due to his rural upbringing. He started trading in agricultural products, beginning with olive oil, which he sold through North Lebanon before committing to the purchase and resale of flour and wheat to the whole of Lebanon. From the late 1940s onward, he negotiated the cost price per kilogram of both flour and wheat with the Ministry of National Economy. His concern for the agricultural industry and the rural world was evident from the start of his parliamentary career: He was elected as head of the Commission of Agriculture and Food Supply for two consecutive terms in 1946 and 1947, as well as head of the Commission of Public Works in 1947. In the 1950s, Khoury became involved in the fight against the monopolization of staple foods and rising prices and became one of the leading figures in the world of trade. He was often consulted by authorities in times of national emergency. During the 1958 Lebanon crisis, he belonged to the group of traders that sounded the alarm about the paralysis of commercial activity in the country, and publicly encouraged the unloading of boats in the Port of Beirut to avoid food shortages. In addition to his involvement in the wheat trade, Khoury also revolutionized sugar production in Lebanon. In 1963, in his capacity as representative of sugar refiners, he advised Prime Minister of Lebanon Rashid Karami on the measures to be taken to meet the country's sugar requirements for the following year. His suggestion was to encourage the production of sugar beet, almost nonexistent in Lebanon at the time, in order to boost domestic output and allow the country to move towards self-sufficiency in sugar production. He was also one of the largest shareholders in the Anjar sugar factory, playing a key role in the resolution of the sugar beet crisis that lasted from December 1964 to June 1965 and which saw the Bekaa peasants clashing with the management of the factory itself. Khoury's stature and position as a prominent industrialist made him inclined to a traditional and benevolent social paternalism towards the peasants. To help Lebanese farmers and combat rural exodus, he was actively involved with the Banque de Cr√©dit Agricole, Industriel et Foncier (BCAIF), founded in 1954, becoming chairman in 1958. During the banana crisis caused by the violent storm of 20 November 1964, which destroyed production for an entire season, Khoury offered long- term loans to banana growers in order to alleviate their difficulties. =Industry and commerce= Boutros el-Khoury with Lebanese President Camille Chamoun, Maronite Archbishop of Tripoli Antoine Abed and Mufti of Tripoli Kazem Mikati. Khoury was one of the pillars of Lebanese industry during the second half of the 20th century, and he was a keen supporter of investment of Lebanese capital in the industrial sector, which he advocated as a means of increasing the national income and curbing unemployment. He was also president of the Association of Industrialists from 1965 to 1975, and called for the establishment of a Ministry of Industry. Khoury's first industrial ventures were in the electricity sector. He invested at an early stage in the La Kadisha company, and in 1948 founded another hydroelectric company, Al-Bared, with two other partners . Through these two companies, Khoury helped to solve the electricity crisis that plagued Lebanon between 1952 and 1954. He proposed linking Beirut to the networks of Qadisha, Nahr el-Bared and Nahr el-Joz to overcome the power cuts in the capital, with Al-Bared handling the operation. In an effort to strengthen the energy sector, he demanded in 1956 a government loan of 5 million LBP to La Kadisha in order to avoid an increase in electricity tariffs. Khoury was also involved in the cement industry. In 1963, he became a shareholder in the Lebanese Cement Company, founded in 1929 by the Maronite Patriarchate in Chekka, having supplied its factories with electricity through the Al-Bared company since 1956. Boutros el-Khoury at one of his factories. In 1952, through several companies founded in conjunction with various business partners from Tripoli Khoury helped establish a free zone in the Port of Tripoli, building port facilities and warehouses and supplying the necessary machinery for the transfer of goods. This expanded the port significantly, as well as strengthening North Lebanese industry in general. He then founded several import‚Äìexport companies with his partners to encourage trade and transit operations, which inevitably led him to become more closely involved in the maritime transport sector. He became a ship owner and founded the Maritime Boutros S. El-Khoury Agency in the 1960s. Khoury also invested in numerous other areas, founding or co-founding over 50 companies both in Lebanon and abroad. Sectors to which he contributed included aluminum and pressed wood production, the petroleum industry, the drinks industry (notably juices and sparkling water), the hospitality industry (hotels), the insurance sector, and the land and real estate industry. =Banking= The Association of Lebanese Industrialists with Lebanese President Suleiman Frangieh. Khoury's involvement in the Lebanese banking sector contributed to the emergence of the \\"Golden Age\\" in the domestic banking industry in the 1950s. He became one of the main figures of the Lebanese banking sector, alongside people like Pierre Edde, Hussein Al Oweini and Philippe Takla. In addition to his role in the BCAIF, which played a leading role in the economic affairs of the country, he also participated in the establishment of many banking institutions, including the project \\"Bank Al-Ahli Al-Mahjar\\", which never took shape but whose purpose was to link the capitals of the diaspora to those of the motherland. Following the same principle, the BLOM Bank (Banque du Liban et d‚ÄôOutre-Mer) was created a year later in 1951. The Sheikh was one of its founders, also serving as its vice-president. BLOM Bank remains one of the leading banks in Lebanon. He was also one of the founders of Al-Madina Bank, established in 1982. He was a shareholder in the Bank of Industry and Labor and invested momentarily funds in Al-Mahjar Bank and Bank of the Mediterranean (Banque de la M√©diterran√©e) in the 1980s. The success of BLOM attracted Arab and foreign capital to the institution. In May 1960, Khoury secured a US$5 million loan for the BCAIF, largely through his personal negotiations with Hart Perry, director of the American Bank Institution known as the Credit Fund. Also through the BCAIF, he led similar negotiations on behalf of the Lebanese government to obtain a US wheat loan in 1964, efforts which resulted in the agreement of a $17 million deal in July 1966. The Sheikh also maintained relations with leading personalities in the international banking community, including David Rockefeller, adviser to the World Bank. In his capacity as chairman of the BCAIF's board of directors, Khoury also worked closely with the Lebanese government in efforts to alleviate problems in the banking sector. In 1964, he chaired the banking consortium that regulated the resolution of the \\"Land Bank\\" crisis. He was also involved in the 1966 project to establish a Development Bank, for the financing of industrial and tourism projects. Additionally, he was a key figure in the resolution of the \\"Intra- banking crisis\\" of 1968, during which Lebanon's central bank, the Banque du Liban (BDL), asked the BCAIF to handle the management and liquidation of 10 banks in distress. =Contribution to social dialogue= Boutros el-Khoury at the press conference of the Association of Lebanese Industrialists. Khoury's role in the Lebanese business world gave him a decisive voice in the dialogue that emerged between trade unionists and managers in the second half of the 1960s. As a representative of the industrialists, he was commonly invited by the ruling class to participate in the settlement of social crises. While usually chosen to represent the employers in these discussions, Khoury often adopted a conciliatory position, reflecting his role as a mediator in both politics and business. On the question of wage increases in the private sector, demanded by unions as early as November 1964, Khoury welcomed the adoption in January 1965 of the wage increase law, which in his opinion guaranteed continued cooperation between employers and workers, as well as increasing living standards. Khoury was also committed to improving worker productivity, providing funds for vocational training and collaborating with the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs on the modernization of the Dekwaneh accelerated vocational training center. Khoury's conciliatory tendencies did not outweigh his economic liberalism, however, and while he was sensitive to worker well-being, he believed that the state should also work in the interests of employers in order to improve the whole economic sector. He remained a proponent of free trade, which also led him to defend the interests of industrialists and capitalists. During the fruit crisis of June 1966, he condemned the measures of the Union of Farmers‚Äîdefended by Kamal Jumblatt and the leftist parties‚Äîas an attempt to nationalize the fruit industry.

He established himself at an early age as an influential figure in his home village of Karm Sadde, and received as a consequence the honorary title of \\"Sheikh\\". He was therefore elected mayor of the village at a very young age. Khoury's reputation, in North Lebanon and across the country, grew as a result of his business successes and growing leadership skills, along with his participation in the Lebanese independence movement led by Bechara El Khoury against the French Mandate. He rapidly became established as an important political leader in Zghorta, and was elected member of the Lebanese Parliament from 1943 to 1947. He showed little interest in a purely political career, however, retiring from parliament and instead adopting a role as an advisor and mediator in political circles.

Sheikh Boutros el- Khoury was known as \\"the man and friend of all regimes.\\". Khoury built strong ties with Lebanon's most prominent post-independence political figures, including Camille Chamoun, Fouad Chehab, Rashid Karami, Charles Helou, Suleiman Frangieh and Elias Sarkis. He often acted as an intermediary and conciliator between different factions, holding frequent social events to this end at either his residence or St. George's Hotel in Beirut. His prominence and influence in political circles earned him the title of \\"the man and friend of all regimes.‚Äù Khoury's political connections also afforded him various business advantages, thanks in large part to the government contracts he was able to obtain. In 1964, in close cooperation with Lebanese President Fouad Chehab, he negotiated with the United States a US$25 million wheat loan. Contracts such as this gave Khoury the opportunity to play a decisive role in the country's political economy. =The 1974 crisis and civil war= Boutros el-Khoury attends a Lebanese Front meeting. Khoury's authority and influence within both the economic and the political establishment was particularly evident during the social crisis of 1974 and the subsequent Lebanese civil war. The social unrest that shook the country in the early 1970s was driven in part by the activities of the General Confederation of Lebanese Workers (Conf√©d√©ration G√©n√©rale des Travailleurs Libanais, CGTL). The CGTL protested against the deterioration of living conditions, and in June 1974 presented the government with a list of demands, which included the amendment of Article 50 of the Labor Code, authorizing arbitrary dismissal. In response, the president of the Association of Industrialists resigned on 11 July 1974 to signify his total rejection of trade union demands, and refused any negotiation, a move that prolonged the crisis considerably. Khoury's position during this conflict was in line with that of the rest of the Lebanese business world, traditionally committed to private initiative and individual and contractual freedom, which were endorsed by the constitution. His commitment to the Lebanese Front during the civil war was thus consistent with his pre-1975 stance: he financed the purchase of weapons used by the Al-Tanzim militia and Camille Chamoun's National Liberal Party, which were fighting the Islamist- progressive militas calling for reforms in the economic and political spheres. Charity Work Sheikh Boutros El-Khoury with the Maronite Archbishop of Tripoli Antoine Abed at El-Khoury's residence. Mar Yaacoub monastery in the background. tarboush. Khoury was also renowned for his philanthropic activities and generous donations to charity. He was always committed to help in times of humanitarian crisis or natural hazards and used his influence for fundraising purposes: during the floods of North Lebanon on 22 December 1955, he participated in the committee of dignitaries organizing the relief efforts in Tripoli. Similarly, he was one of the first to donate money during the earthquake of 16 March 1956, which affected the Chouf and South Lebanon regions, and formed a committee to organize fundraising among industrialists. In March 1960, he donated to the Red Cross for the benefit of the victims of the Agadir earthquake. In 1974, he became a member of the National Committee for Victims of Cyprus. Personal life Khoury married Najibe Abboud, a relative of his mentor Abbas, on 19 September 1926. The couple had seven children. Death and legacy Commemorative statue of Boutros el-Khoury in Karm Sadde. Khoury died in 1984 in Beirut at the age of 77. Caricature by Pierre Sadek published in An-Nahar. Khoury has since become established in Lebanese collective memory as the quintessential self-made man, due to his rural origins and his impressive social ascent during his work in Tripoli, Lebanon and Beirut. His legacy has been examined in various books, both fiction and non-fiction. Similarly, a commemorative statue was erected in his home village of Karm Sadde to honor him. Khoury was also known for wearing the tarboush, which became his trademark, both in the newspapers and in the political cartoons made of him by the famous Lebanese cartoonist Pierre Sadek. He was also known for his great sense of humor.

It is also used as a diagnostic tool in some heart diseases. Indications The main reason for performing an EMB is to assess allograft rejection following heart transplantation and sometimes to evaluate cardiomyopathy, some heart disease research and ventricular arrhythmias, or unexplained ventricular dysfunction. =Transplant monitoring= Visualising the microscopic appearance of the heart muscle allows the detection of cell-mediated or antibody-mediated rejection and is recommended episodically during the first year after heart transplantation. Occasionally, monitoring continues beyond one year. The use of EMB in heart transplant rejection surveillance remains the gold standard test, although the pre-test predictors of rejection cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) and gene expression profiling, are increasingly used. = Myocardial diseases= EMB has a role in the diagnosis of viral myocarditis and inflammatory myocarditis. Procedure EMB of the right ventricle via the internal jugular vein is standard after heart transplant. A bioptome is used to gain access to the heart via a sheath inserted into the right internal jugular or less commonly the femoral vein. Monitoring during the procedure consists of performing ECGs and blood pressures. Guidance and confirmation of correct positioning of the bioptome is made by echocardiography or fluoroscopy before the biopsy specimen is taken and in the case of transplants, usually three or four or more samples are taken. Endomyocardial fibrosis can occur if biopsies are performed repeatedly. This risk is reduced if the operator is experienced. Unlike for rejection detection, for diagnosing heart disease, different biopsy sites within the heart are targeted. It is possible but less common to biopsy the left ventricle via the femoral arteries. Limitations The accuracy of diagnosis by EMB depends on whether the correct site is biopsied. There is a risk that a diagnosis can be missed if the biopsy misses the diseased part of heart muscle, particularly with myocardial inflammation or fibrosis. An experienced pathologist trained in biopsy analysis and interpretation also reflects EMB‚Äôs reliability. Variability between pathologists has been observed. Complications A frequent concern regarding EMB has been its safety. However, it has a low risk of less than 1% when performed by an experienced physician in a specialist centre. Possible complications, which almost all occur at time of procedure, include rupture of the right intraventricular septum, conduction block, arrhythmias, pneumothorax, tricuspid regurgitation, and pulmonary embolism. Death has been reported, but is rare. History Early heart biopsies, sampling pericardium, in the latter half of the 1950s were performed through a cut in the left intercostal space at the costochondral junction. However this method risked lung and coronary blood vessel damage, cardiac tamponade and arrythmias. EMB, sampling myocardium, has evolved since it was first pioneered in Japan by S. Sakakibra and S. Konno in 1962. The concept of introducing a biopsy needle through the right internal or external jugular vein to reach the right intraventricular septum for the purpose of sampling the heart muscle was initiated in 1965 by R. T. Bulloch. In 1972, the bioptome and procedure was modified by Philip Caves. This was to allow access percutaneously.

Many pits and postholes belong to this period. About ten groups of postholes can be reconstructed to small rectangular structures, that are common at other late Iron Age sites too and that are interpreted at raised granaries.Philp: The Roman Villa Site at Keston, Kent, First Report, p. 29 The next period of the settlement dates to the Roman period, from about AD 50 to 160. A small cemetery belongs to this period and the remains of two enclosures. The evidence is of some special importance. This is an Iron age settlement still functioning under Roman rule without major break. Around AD 160 the first houses were constructed that might be called villas. There are three larger wooden buildings. One in the North, one in the South and the largest in the West. The latter building was once about 16 to 6 m large and was most likely the main residence of the villa complex. Plaster fragments show that some rooms were painted. The building burned down around AD 160.Philp: The Roman Villa Site at Keston, Kent, First Report, p. 61 Around AD 200 the main building on the west was rebuilt in stone. The new house had a bath and parts of the floors were covered with tesserae.

The main building is a round mausoleum that was once covered with red plaster. Two smaller structures were found next to it. Three sarcophagi were found here, one of them decorated on the outside. In one of the tombs was found a small, well preserved lead coffin.Philp: The Roman Villa Site at Keston, Kent Second Report, pp. 45-60, 143-44 Around 300 the south building was also rebuild in stone. Its function remains unclear. The Northern building was no longer used. The western, main villa still functioned till about AD 400.

The name \\"Isinuka\\", means \\"place of smell\\", which refers to the odour of the sulphur which diffuses from the springs. This name was given by the Mpondo people of the Eastern Cape who regard this site as a sacred area. The springs are also visited by thousands of tourists who seek relief from various ailments yearly.Ndze Denis Jumbam. Indilinga African Journal of Indigenous Knowledge Systems, Volume 11, Issue 1, Jun 2012, p. 20 - 31 Uses The white soil clay from the springs is used for cosmetic and dermatological applications by the people of Isinuka, Port St Johns and the surrounding towns in Pondoland of the Eastern Cape province. The presence of sulphur, copper and zinc may play a significant role in their antibacterial and antifungal properties. The clays are particularly used by local women to protect their skin from the ultra violet rays. The presence of zinc and TiO2 are likely responsible for protection against the sun. The minor presence of Arsenic also aids in healing properties however, Arsenic is a human carcinogen and may be extremely toxic at high concentrations. Description The springs are located in a densely forested region a few kilometers from Port St John‚Äôs. In order to reach the pure spring water, the people need to climb large rocks and use a strong fig tree as an improvised staircase.https://www.wheretostay.co.za/topic/3581-isinuka-springs Accessed 24 September 2018 The Isinuka cave is below a rock outcrop and water drips from the roof of the cave onto a slippery white clayey sedimentary material which is the material used for the treatment of skin diseases such as acne. The most popular pond like spring (which is about 3 square meters) is located above the rock outcrop. The spring emits a foul smelling hydrogen sulfide like odor. The water is turbid and dark grey in colour.Ndze Denis Jumbam. Indilinga African Journal of Indigenous Knowledge Systems, Volume 11, Issue 1, Jun 2012, p. 20 - 31 Mineralogical and biochemical properties Analytical sample studies have been done using X-ray diffraction techniques. The pH range of samples range between 7.94 and 10.05 which indicates alkaline clay. The pH of normal human skin ranges between 5.4 and 5.9, this variability brings into the question the viability of using these clays to treat acne as highly alkaline substances often have an adverse effect on the skin when applied without premedication or neutralization. Additionally, Cutibacterium acnes, bacteria which play a role in the development of acne, thrives on skin with high alkalinity. Therefore, the continuous application of alkaline clay on skin will increase the skin Ph resulting in the development of acne. The local people often mix these clay materials with other plant and animal extracts in order to make the clay suitable for application to the skin. The particle sizes vary between silt, loam and silt loam. Large particle sizes when used cosmetically, may cause abrasion and damage to the skin. The smaller particles have a large potential to be used as a cleanser. The clays and soils particle size influences the refractive index (light) which allows for them to be used a s skin protectors. There are 17 minerals identified in Isinuku clay namely quartz (SiO2), mica, calcite (CaCO3), interstratified ilite ( K0,6(H3O)0.4Al1.3Mg0.3Fe2+0.1Si3.5)O10(OH)2.(H2O)), aragonite (CaCO3), gypsum CaSO4.2(H2O), rozenite Fe2+SO4.4(H2O), K-feldspar (KAlSi3O8), plagioclase (Na,Ca)(Si,Al)4O8), kaolinite (Al2SiO5(OH)4), chlorite (ClO2), halite (NACl), pyrite (FeS2), pyrophyllite (Al2Ai4O10(OH)2), spinel (MgAl2O4) and smectite (NaO3(Al,Mg)2SiO10(OH)2xH2O). The three dominant mineral phases are quartz, mica and calcite followed by interstratified illite and smectite. The alkaline nature of the clay can be attributed to calcite. Quartz, mica and illite are very stable substances however, due to their particle size, can cause abrasions when applied topically. Illite is applied topically and orally. The use of sulphur in various skin preparations in the field of dermatology due to sulphur's antifungal, antibacterial and keratolytic properties. The sulphur content in the springs ranges from 0.8% to 1.3%. Furthermore the continued saturation of the sulphur containing clay with the saline water which drips from the roof of the cave results in an improvement of the clay‚Äôs medicinal properties. The clay also has components which include bromide and arsenic, the latter was used to treat syphilis, yaws and other bacterial infections before the development of penicillin. Other trace elements found include cobalt, chromium, copper, zinc, uranium and radioactive Sr.Ndze Denis Jumbam. Indilinga African Journal of Indigenous Knowledge Systems, Volume 11, Issue 1, Jun 2012, p. 20 - 31 Although the clay may be useful for therapeutic and cosmetic purposes, the clay may also constitute a health risk resulting from repeated and unsupervised exposure.

Built in 1803 but never actually used as a tavern, it is well-preserved example of early 19th-century Federal period architecture. It is now maintained as a museum by a local historical society. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009. Description and history The Medad Stone Tavern is located in a rural-residential setting west of Guilford Center, on the west side of Three Mile Course just south of a stream which feeds the West River. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gambrel roof and clapboarded exterior, set on a sloping lot which exposes the entire front of the basement level. The roof is pierced by five gabled dormers, with brick chimneys set near the ends. The front facade is covered by a shed-roof porch that appears two stories in height due to the basement frontage. The main facade is five bays wide, with sash windows and a central entrance. The entrance is flanked by wide sidelight windows. The house is set on about along with a barn, corn crib, and garage. The structure was built in 1803 by Medad Stone, along what was then a proposed new route for the Boston Post Road. Stone intended to operate a tavern here, but because the road was never realigned, he never did so, and it was only used as a private residence. It was occupied by the Davis family, who farmed the surrounding land for nearly 200 years. In 2001, the Davises gave the house to the Guilford Keeping Society, which has restored it and opened it as a museum.

The insurrection was carried out by members of the Gambia Socialist Revolutionary Party and disaffected staff of the Gambia Field Force. At the time, President Dawda Jawara was in the United Kingdom attending the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer. The failure of the coup precipitated the creation of the Senegambia Confederation in 1982.  Origins  = Dissatisfaction in the Field Force = The British colonial government had disbanded the Gambia Regiment due to cost concerns in 1958 and created a paramilitary unit of 140 police called the Gambia Field Force. By 1981, the Force was officially made up of 358 police, but may have actually numbered as many as 500. On 27 October 1980, Deputy Commander E. J. Mahoney was murdered by Private Mustapha Danso, at the Bakau Depot. The government explained the incident as a solitary act of mutiny, but still invoked the 1965 common defence agreement with Senegal, leading to the deployment of 150 troops on a joint training exercise called 'Operation Foday Kabba I' for one week. Furthermore, that between one-third and one-half of the Field Force would subsequently participate in the attempted coup, including the recently retired assistant commissioner Ousman Bojang, suggested that dissatisfaction within the Force was widespread. = Opposition = The Gambian government was concerned at foreign policy of socialist Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in the region. The Libyan embassy in Banjul had been increasing in size and it was believed that it was supporting local dissidents, including the socialist newspaper The Voice. As early as July 1980, the Libyans had been accused of providing military training to Gambians who had been recruited by Senegalese rebel leader, Sheikh Ahmed Niasse of Kaolack. On 29 October 1980, the Libyan embassy was shut down and diplomatic relations were broken off. The background for the rebels involved in the attempted coup came from the Gambia Socialist Revolutionary Party (GSRP), founded in early 1980 by Gibril L. George, a former businessman. This party was joined by Kukoi Sanyang, a former NCP politician who had traveled to Libya and the Soviet Union. After being declared unlawful on 30 October 1980, the party became the Gambia Underground Socialist Revolutionary Workers Party (GUSRWP), and committed itself to overthrow of the Gambian government. Supposed members of the GUSRWP who swore to overthrow the Gambian government included 10 civilians and 36 Field Force officers. The ideology of the group was a \\"woolly and vulgarized form\\" of Marxist and radical pan-Africanist thinking. They spoke of \\"Victory for the Gambian revolutionary struggle under the dictatorship of the proletariat and the leadership of a Marxist-Leninist party\\" and of \\"Death to neocolonialism, racism and fascism.\\"  The 30 July Coup  = Build-up = Covert meetings in Serekunda were held in late July, led by Kukoi Sanyang, to plan the coup. Of the 15 members of this group, at least five had been involved in the Field Force. A number were also employed as taxi drivers - lending the name 'taxi driver's coup'. The plotters waited until President Dawda Jawara was out of the country in England before launching the coup d'√©tat. = 30 July 1981 = In the early hours of the day, the coup began. Kukoi Sanyang and 10 accomplices made their way on foot to the Bakau Field Force Depot from Serekunda, five miles away. They broke into the depot using wire cutters and met up with a conspirator in the Field Force - Momodou Sonko - who let them into the armoury. Armed with Kalashnikov assault rifles, the group were able to take the Depot and collected Ousman Bojang, the former Assistant Commander. A number of disaffected Field Force officers also joined them, but the greater number fled. Once the Depot was taken, the rebels moved onto other targets of importance. By dawn, they had secured the Radio Gambia buildings, Yundum airport, and the State House in Banjul. Civilian supporters of the group were given weapons at the armoury in order to assist the coup.

Geologic History, Stratigraphy & Tectonics Although the island chain comprises Saint Croix, Saint Thomas and Saint John, the most research has focused on the origins of Saint John. The island began to form with keratophyre and pillow basalt below water, creating the two kilometer thick Water Island Formation in the Early Cretaceous on oceanic plateau crust. Radiolarian chert deposited along with the submarine volcanic activity, accompanied by dikes and small plutons in the Careen Hill Intrusive Suite. An extensional environment is inferred by the presence of sheeted dikes. Geologists have debated the origins of keratophyres, suggesting a back-arc basin environment, although this is challenged by high-levels of silica in the rocks. Local hydrothermal alteration was proposed as a reason for metal anomalies in the Lameshur Volcanic-Intrusive Complex. The 1.5 kilometer thick Louisenhoj Formation contains clasts which record a shift toward clinopyroxene andesite and basalt more typical of island arcs, above the Water Island Formation. Except as pillow basalt on Ramgoat Cay, primary volcanic units are scarce from this time period. Given the boulder-sized clasts and different mineralogy, geologists have inferred that these clasts must have originated from several different large vents close by. Unlike Saint John, on Saint Thomas, radiolarian chert exists but is much rarer. Pyroclastic flows are preserved on Saint Thomas, together with limited fossil-bearing limestone deposits and calcite cement in upper rock units. The Outer Brass Limestone deposited during a lull in volcanic activity in the Turonian and Santonian. The limestone unit also contains calc-silicate rocks, marble and conglomerate bound together with calcareous cement and including both marble and andesite clasts. In the Late Cretaceous, the overlying Tutu Formation took shape with volcanic turbidite and rare pyroxene basalt. Silt or sand-sized material is most common unlike the Louisenhoj Formation boulders, suggesting a more distant volcanic source. In fact, sediments become finer, ascending upward into the Picara Member and Mandal Member. Striking slump folds and deformation of limestone and conglomerate beds is common. On Saint John, the Tutu Formation is the youngest stratified unit, although volcanism continued on the neighboring British Virgin Islands until the Eocene. On Saint John, a large dike swarm formed in formed in the early or mid-Cenozoic. Broad folds formed due to north-south compression, likely due to the collision of the Greater Antilles arc with the Bahama Platform of the North American Plate. Deformation increases northward across Saint John. The Narrows pluton and Virgin Gorda batholith, which are dominated by tonalite followed the episode of compression, forming around 39 million years ago in the Eocene. East-west compression brought brittle fractures filled with veins of calcite and limonite. Spreading at the Cayman Trough may explain north-plunging late folds, due to eastward movement of the Caribbean plate. The formation of the Cayman Trough produced the last significant tectonic feature on the islands after 39 million years ago, with sinistral strike-slip faults. A structural block produced as a result creates a 5.7 kilometer sinistrally offset contact between the Water Island and Louisenhoj formations. https://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/p1631/P1631-tag.pdf Hydrogeology One of the most in-depth studies of groundwater in the U.S. Virgin Islands was conducted by the U.S. Geological Survey in 1995, focused on Saint Croix. The south-central part of the island is underlain by alluvium and carbonate rocks, including lenses of silt and clay. The Oligocene to Miocene Jealousy formation, the Miocene and Pliocene Kingshill Limestone and Pliocene Post-Kingshill Limestone are all a single hydrological unit. The water-table aquifer ranges between five and 68 feet below the grounds surface and overall groundwater in the area contained comparatively high sodium chloride concentrations. https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/wri934162 References +U.S. Virgin Islands Category:Geography of the United States Virgin Islands ","title":"Geology of the United States Virgin Islands"},{"id":"58582689","text":"Cl√©ment Petit (born 11 January 1998) is a Belgian football player.

Located on Ledge Hill Road, the district includes two churches (along with their appended halls and parsonages), a cemetery, and Ledge Hill Road itself, which dates to the early 18th century. The arrangement is reflective of a spirit of religious tolerance that manifested in the early 19th century, allowing churches from two different congregations (Congregationalist and Episcopalian) to heal long- standing divisions. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. Description and history North Guilford was an agricultural outpost of the town of Guilford from its early settlement. In 1705, land was set aside for a common, and in 1717 land was allocated for a meeting house and cemetery. The local population was at the time strongly Congregationalist, and the town levied church taxes that supported the Congregational church that was built there. In 1747, a segment of the North Guilford population formally declared itself for the Church of England, and built a second church at a location to the south. These adherents objected to the church tax, leading to acrimonious disputes in the town. In the early 19th century, a spirit of reconciliation prevailed, and the Congregationalists agreed to permit the Episcopalian successors to the Anglicans to build their church on land adjacent to theirs. With Meetinghouse Hill is located in rural northern Guilford, occupying a prominent hilltop location. It is accessed via Ledge Hill Road, which was laid out in the early 18th century to provide access to the site. The cemetery is on the west side of the road, and the buildings of the two churches are located on the east side. The North Guilford Congregational Church is the northern of the two churches: it is a Federal style building constructed in 1812-14 by Abraham Coan. To its south stands St. John's Episcopal Church, also built about 1812-14, is a more eclectic mix of Classical and Gothic elements, reflective of alterations made in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Congregational church is accompanied by an 1823 parsonage and a Victorian (1887‚Äì88) parish hall that now houses a school. Adjacent to St. John's stands its former rectory, a Greek Revival house built in 1851.

First published in 1947 in England and the United States, it was her third novel. It is the first of her novels in which one of the main characters is a creative artist. The relationship of the artist to society and other people was to be an important theme in Taylor's subsequent work. The narrative, which is set in a postwar English seaside town, is told from the points of view of several characters. The story involves an abortive love affair between the husband of Beth, a novelist, and her best friend and next door neighbour, as well as the comings and goings of Bertram, a retired naval officer who has come to town intending to take up painting. The novel was favourably reviewed when first published, and has been reissued in the 2010s in the Virago Modern Classics and NYRB Classics series. Plot The novel is set in a fictional English seaside town soon after the end of World War II. Several characters' points of view alternate in the narration. The story begins with the arrival of Bertram Hemingway, a retired naval officer and amateur painter who soon becomes acquainted with most of the other protagonists. These include Beth Cazabon, a novelist, her husband Robert, the town doctor, and Beth's best friend and next door neighbour Tory Foyle. Robert and Tory, a divorc√©e, are secretly in love with each other. The Cazabons have two daughters: a little girl named Stevie, and Prudence, who has finished school and is living at home. Prudence eventually learns of the relationship between her father and her mother's friend, but does not tell anyone. However, Tory and Robert know they have been discovered. Other characters include Mrs. Bracey, a widowed invalid, and her two adult daughters. Mrs. Bracey spends her time watching the view from her window and speculating on the behaviour of the townspeople. She is a patient of Robert Cazabon and is visited by Bertram Hemingway, who enjoys listening to her gossip. When she develops pneumonia Bertram takes turns with her daughters sitting with her, and is present when she dies. Bertram also briefly befriends Lily Wilson, a young war widow who owns a waxworks exhibition. He meets her at the pub where he is lodging and gets into the habit of walking her home in the evenings. Lonely and depressed, Lily is disappointed when his attention shifts to Tory Foyle, to whom he eventually proposes marriage. In order to end her affair with Robert, Tory decides to move to London and unexpectedly agrees to marry Bertram. Before leaving the town Bertram presents the pub owner with a painting depicting a view of the harbour. Tory's departure for London takes place on the same day as Mrs. Bracey's funeral. Major themes The relationship of the creative artist to other people and to society is a major theme in Taylor's work, and more than half of her novels have a writer or visual artist as a main character. A related theme is the relationship between creative imagination and self-deception. A View of the Harbour is the first of Taylor's books to centre on a creative artist. Beth, a novelist, is portrayed as \\"blind to external reality\\", not noticing that her husband is having an affair with her best friend and next-door neighbour. Taylor describes Beth writing a detailed description of a fictional funeral, when she has never attended a real funeral and refuses to attend Mrs. Bracey's, protesting \\"I shouldn't know what to do. I should hate it.\\" On the other hand, she realises that her talent is limited and that the real value of her work is the pleasure and fulfilment it gives her. Bertram, the other artist character, has a vision of himself as a successful painter, but does not paint very much or with much success, instead spending much of his time visiting. A View of the Harbour also deals with the details of domestic life and the traditional activities of women's work, including cooking, cleaning and child care. Beth's novel writing takes place in the context of her family responsibilities as the doctor's wife and the mother of two daughters. Among the characters whose inner lives are described are the Cazabons' \\"daily woman\\" and Mrs. Bracey's daughter, who serves drinks at the pub. Publication history A View of the Harbour was first published in 1947 by Peter Davies Ltd. in England and by Alfred A. Knopf in the United States. Virago Press published it in the Virago Modern Classics series in 1987. In 2018 it was one of 12 novels included in a new Virago series published in celebration of Virago's fortieth anniversary. NYRB Classics republished A View of the Harbour in the United States in 2015. Reception A View of the Harbour was favourably reviewed on its publication in 1947. In The New York Times Orville Prescott described the novel as characteristically English in being \\"all wit and charm on the surface and unexpectedly penetrating underneath\\". Also in the New York Times, Donald Barr placed Taylor in the tradition of Jane Austen for her humour, and praised her talent for characterisation while finding \\"flaws of technique\\" including \\"laconic settings of scene\\". Nelson Algren also commented on her gift for characterisation, describing the novel as \\"deft and witty\\" while \\"almost plotless\\", and compared Taylor's technique to Henry James's.

Kubie had several celebrity patients, including Tennessee Williams, Leonard Bernstein, Moss Hart, Kurt Weill and Sid Caesar. Life After graduating from Harvard College in 1916, Kubie took a medical degree from Johns Hopkins University in 1921 and later became a Freudian psychoanalyst. He was a faculty member at Johns Hopkins University, Columbia University, the Yale School of Medicine and the New York Psychoanalytic Institute, and was on the staffs of the Neurological Institute of New York and Mount Sinai Hospital. Kubie wrote two books, Practical and Theoretical Aspects of Psychoanalysis and Neurotic Distortion of the Creative Process, and many articles. He was the editor of The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease. He was formerly president of the New York Psychoanalytic Society and the American Psychosomatic Society, secretary of the American Psychoanalytic Association and a member of the New York Academy of Medicine. In articles of 1930 and 1941, Kubie proposed a theory of 'closed reverberating circuits' underlying neurosis which was later drawn upon by Warren McCulloch, and discussed by John Z Young at the 9th Macy conference. Kubie attended the Macy conferences from 1942 to 1953. After 1941 he studied hypnosis, particularly in collaboration with Richard Brickner and Milton Erickson, and it was Kubie who invited Erickson to a Macy conference in 1942. The playwright Tennessee Williams entered analysis with Kubie in 1957. In a New York Review of Books controversy about the treatment, Gore Vidal said that many people of the time saw Kubie as 'a slick bit of goods on the make among the rich, the famous, the gullible.' Vidal charged Kubie with attempting to discourage Williams from his homosexuality, though John Lahr's biography of Williams disputes the claim.Jennifer Schuessler, A Playwright Named Desire: The Battle for Art and Sanity, The New York Times, September 1, 2014.

Completed in 1823, it was first printed in 1826. The work is regarded as a pinnacle of musical prose. Eichendorff created an open form with epic and lyrical elements, incorporating several poems and songs in the text. It was freely translated to English as Memoirs of a Good- for-Nothing, first published in 1866.  Plot  A miller sends his son away, calling him a good-for-nothing. The young man takes his fiddle along and leaves happily, without a specific destination. Soon two ladies in a carriage, who are interested in his music, take him along to their palace close to Vienna, where he gets a job as a gardener. He falls in love with the younger lady. Promoted to tax collector, he plants flowers in the garden of the tax house instead of potatoes, placing them regularly for his beloved. He plans to make money, but when he sees his beloved with an officer, he realizes that she is not available for him and leaves. Further travel takes him to Italy, with adventures on the way and in Rome. Back at the palace, several mysteries about identities are revealed, and he can marry his beloved Aurelie, who is not a noble woman but an orphan. The couple are given a house with a garden and vineyards, and they plan a honeymoon in Italy, travelling again.  Narration  The story is told in the first person from the perspective of the young man. The story has fairy-tale elements in its simple and intentionally naive language, unexpected events, and images of romantic landscapes. The young man's \\"Wanderlust\\" is motivated externally by his father and internally by his desire for the \\"weite Welt\\" (\\"big, wide world\\"), fleeing sedentary life. Combining elements of dream and reality, it has been called a \\"high point of Romantic fiction\\".  Legacy  The poem \\"Der Taugenichts\\" by Gottfried Keller was inspired by the novella. Charles Godfrey Leland, whose translation appeared in 1866 The novella was freely translated to English as Memoirs of a Good-for-Nothing, first by Charles Godfrey Leland, published in New York in 1866 by Leypohlt & Holt. A translation by Bayard Quincy Morgan was published in New York by Ungar in 1955. A translation by John Calder was first published in 1966 and reprinted in 2015 by Alma Books. In 1957, an audio play was produced by Bayerischer Rundfunk, adapted by and directed by Gert Westphal, with music by Bernd Scholz and speakers Erik Schumann, , , , among others. The novella has been the basis for three films.Good-for-Nothing is a 1922 silent film directed by Carl Froelich. ' is a 1973 free adaptation by DEFA, directed by with Dean Reed as the Taugenichts. The Rome episode was cut, possibly to avoid nurturing any desires to travel by residents of the GDR.

One quadruple mount was positioned on the aft superstructure and two twin-gun mounts were fitted on platforms in front of the bridge. The torpedo boat carried six above-water torpedo tubes in two triple mounts amidships and could also carry 30 mines; the full complement of 60 mines made the ships top- heavy which could be dangerous in bad weather. For anti-submarine work she was fitted with a S-Ger√§t sonar and four depth charge launchers. By the end of the war, T-35 was equipped with a FuMO 21 radar on the foremast, a FuMO 63 K Hohentwiel radar on the searchlight platform and various FumB radar detectors.Friedman, p. 205; Whitley 1991, pp. 52‚Äì55; Whitley 2000, p. 73 Construction and career T35 was ordered on 20 January 1941 from Schichau, laid down at their Elbing, East Prussia, shipyard on 20 April 1943 as yard number 1517, launched on 12 December 1943 and commissioned on 7 October 1944. After working up for the next several months, the boat was one of the escorts for the heavy cruiser as the latter ship supported a German counterattack against advancing Soviet forces near Cranz, East Prussia, on 29‚Äì30 January 1945. On 5 May, T35 helped to ferry 45,000 refugees from East Prussia to Copenhagen, Denmark, and returned to transport 20,000 more to Gl√ºcksburg, Germany, on the 9th. The boat was allocated to the United States when the Allies divided the surviving ships of the Kriegsmarine amongst themselves in late 1945. T35 was taken to the United States for testing and renamed DD-935. She was towed to France in 1947 where she cannibalized for spare parts. The ship was stricken from the Navy List on 3 October 1952 and subsequently scrapped.Rohwer, pp. 387, 414; Whitley 1991, pp. 188‚Äì189, 191, 199, 213 Notes Citations References    External links * T35 at german navy.de Category:Type 39 torpedo boats Category:1943 ships Category:Ships built by Schichau Category:Ships built in Elbing ","title":"German torpedo boat T35"},{"id":"58583028","text":"First edition (publ.

In 2019, she briefly served as the acting County Attorney for Maricopa County after the appointment of Bill Montgomery to the Arizona Supreme Court. Previously, she was the Chief Deputy County Attorney, and chief of the Special Victims Division. In 2018, Mitchell rose to national prominence when she was requested by the Senate Judiciary Committee to serve as Nomination Investigative Counsel and question both Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh on September 27, 2018 during Kavanaugh's widely publicized confirmation hearings for Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.  Early life and education  Mitchell is a first-generation Arizonan whose father grew up on a farm in Arkansas and whose mother grew up in a small town in Pennsylvania. Mitchell attended Arizona State University in 1985, took a course at Phoenix College in the summer of 1987, and got a bachelor of science degree from Grand Canyon College, now known as Grand Canyon University. She earned her J.D. degree in 1992 from the ASU's College of Law. Mitchell worked at the Arizona Capitol Times newspaper in the late 1980s. She interviewed candidates running for elected office and wrote summaries of decisions by the courts. Mitchell later worked as adjunct faculty at Grand Canyon University, where she taught a three-credit course on the court system.  Legal career  Mitchell has been a current, registered member of the Arizona bar since 1993. In 2003, Mitchell was recognized by Arizona Governor Janet Napolitano as \\"Outstanding Arizona Sexual Assault Prosecutor of the Year.\\" She was promoted to the Maricopa County prosecutor's office sex crimes division chief by newly elected county attorney Andrew Thomas in 2004 to replace previous chief Cindi Nannetti.Leonard, Christina. New Maricopa County attorney shakes up staff, Arizona Republic (Phoenix, Arizona) January 10, 2005, page 19 - accessed via Newspapers.com Mitchell spent 12 years in charge of the sex-crimes bureau, which prosecutes crimes including adult sexual assault and child molestation. In 2014, a commission recommended her as a possible judicial candidate in Arizona. Mitchell has overseen and assisted in prosecuting some high-profile sexual assault cases in Arizona, including ones against churches, youth camps, law enforcement, and members of clergy. Her most prominent case was the 2005 conviction of Rev. Paul LeBrun. In her position in Maricopa County, she has advocated strengthening sex assault laws in the state and has pushed for changes in the courtroom to comfort victims testifying in abuse cases. Mitchell made headlines in 2016 after allowing a golden retriever mix named Sam to assist children when they were testifying about traumatic episodes. Mitchell's name appears on a list of Arizona \\"lobbyist updates\\" for the week of March 26, 2018. = Senate Judiciary Committee hearings (2018) = In September 2018, Mitchell took a leave of absence from the Maricopa County Attorney's Office in order to serve as Investigative Counsel for the Senate Judiciary Committee, during the confirmation hearings of Brett Kavanaugh for Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. She participated in the September 27, 2018 hearings of Christine Blasey Ford and Kavanaugh, concerning Ford's allegations of sexual assault towards Kavanaugh. Mitchell was brought in by the Republican senators in the Committee, and questioned Ford and Kavanaugh. The Committee's Democratic senators questioned Ford and Kavanaugh themselves. During the coverage of the hearing, CBS News described Mitchell as \\"a career prosecutor with decades of experience prosecuting sex crimes\\". Following the hearing, she issued a memorandum concluding a reasonable prosecutor would not file charges based on the evidence before the committee. The memo was criticized for drawing conclusions based on too little evidence. On September 29, 2018 and October 6, 2018, Mitchell was portrayed by actress Aidy Bryant in the Saturday Night Live opening sketch, and referred to in the \\"Weekend Update\\" segment. = Acting County Attorney = In August 2019, Montgomery promoted Mitchell to Chief Deputy at the county attorney's office. Mitchell got the job after Montgomery's longtime chief deputy Mark Faull left on medical leave and his replacement Michael McVey was accused of having an inappropriate relationship with another county employee. After Montgomery resigned to take a seat on the state supreme court, Mitchell became acting county attorney until the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors selects an interim to fill out the remainder of Montgomery's term. Mitchell, along with Jon Eliason, Allister Adel, Rodney Glassman, John Kaites, Gina Godbehere, Chris DeRose, and Lacy Cooper, applied for the position. After the Board selected Adel for the County Attorney role, Ken Vick became chief deputy and Mitchell became the deputy chief for the criminal group.

J. C. Morton. The contest was won by the Conservative Party candidate John Lockie. Vacancy The by-election in Devonport was caused by the death on 3 October 1902 of one of the sitting Liberal MPs, Edward John Chalmers Morton. There were two seats in the constituency, which had both been won by Liberals in the 1900 general election. Morton was a barrister who had held the seat since the 1892 general election, and had been re-elected in 1895 and in 1900. Candidates John Lockie had contested the constituency for the Conservative party in the previous election, and had kept a residence there with a view to stand again. As he was the declared candidate for the party no other names were put forward. Leckie was a shipbuilder from Glasgow, who had previously lived in Edinburgh and Newcastle before he moved south. He was the founder of the National Industrial Association, an organization which sought to promote British trading interests by reconciling the claims of capital and labour. Several names were mentioned as candidates for the Liberal Party, including Augustine Birrell and Rufus Isaacs. By 8 October Thomas Brassey was stated to be the most likely candidate, and at a meeting the following day of the council of the Liberal party, he was adopted as such. Brassey was a volunteer officer who had recently returned from South Africa following the end of the Second Boer War. He had unsuccessfully contested the Epsom division in 1892, and the Christchurch division in 1895 and 1900. His father Thomas Brassey (later 1st Earl Brassey) was briefly an MP for Devonport in 1865. Issues ;Education Following the successful campaign in the Leeds North by-election in July 1902, the Liberal party spent much time on the government‚Äôs plans for an Education Bill to replace school boards with local education authorities, which included proposals to bring church schools into the public system. Many Liberals were strongly nonconformist and the idea that Church of England and Roman Catholic schools should be funded from the rates, a form of local taxation, was anathema to them. It provided the battle slogan ‚ÄòRome on the Rates‚Äô and united the party against the government.David Dutton, A History of the Liberal Party in the Twentieth Century; Palgrave Macmillan, 2004 p14 The bill was debated in the House as the campaign in Devonport took place, and Brassey \\"heartily approved of the strenuous resistance ... offered by the Liberal party\\", making it one of the main issues of the election. Lockie defended the government¬¥s position, stating that the bill promoted ‚Ä≥efficiency in education and the more equitable distribution of it¬¥s cost‚Ä≥. ;Other issues Lockie used the recent peace following the Second Boer War in South Africa to mobilize government supporters in a constituency heavily influenced by military industry, stating that with a continued Conservative government would the dockyard in the city receive adequate recognition. He had spent the years after his 1900-defeat showing a great deal of attention to the dockyard and the conditions of the men working there, and was known to favor dialogue between capital and labour. Brassey worked to give attention to dockyard grievances. Brassey raised his concern on the growth of national expenditure , attributing much of it to \\"insufficient control and supervision of the public departments\\". Leckie promised to vote ‚Ä≥against any tax on corn and other commodity of every-day life‚Ä≥. Result Lockie won the seat for the Conservatives by a wafer-thin majority of 28 votes (0.4%). Lockie was troubled by ill-health, and resigned less than two years later, in June 1904. He died in January 1906. In the following by-election the Liberal candidate re-took the seat.

It follows Mailhot through her troubled childhood, early and tumultuous motherhood, and into her adult struggles with mental health and personal identity. Maillot's memoir covers many topics relevant to the lives of Indigenous women, including Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women. It reached 14 on The New York Times Best Seller list for hardback non-fiction, and was a finalist for the Hilary Weston Writers' Trust Prize for Nonfiction. A number of critics have noted, both positively and negatively, the unique style of the piece, yet despite or because of this, it has received a warm reception and overall praise. Overview The first edition opens with a foreword by Spokane-Coeur d'Alene-American novelist Sherman Alexie, offering what one reviewer characterized as \\"glowing introduction\\", and praising Mailhot as the \\"biological child of a broken healer and a lonely artist.\\" The main body proceeds as a series of essays which explore Mailhot's experiences growing up on the Seabird Island Indian Reservation in British Columbia, including her first marriage as a teenager, and the loss of custody of her first child on the same day she gave birth to her second. It offers insight into Mailhot's struggle with her mental health, including PTSD and bipolar disorder. It explores her experience after committing herself to a mental institution following a breakdown. It was there that she began writing Heart Berries, according to an interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, \\"In those spaces of mental health, there weren't any First Nations counsellors and there weren't any people who understand genocide and what it looks like to come from a culture that has thrived in spite of so much.\\" She then turned to her writing as \\"a way to avoid my workbook and group therapy ‚Ä¶ but ultimately writing the truth of what I experienced was something kind of shocking\\". The book explores Mailhot's familial connections with her mother, father, and grandmother, her mother's habit of bringing predatory men into the lives of her family, and her fathers reckless lawlessness, culminating eventually in his own violent death. It also follows her growing relationship with writer Casey Gray, the white man who would become her second husband, and thematically, at once \\"a figure of the beloved and a symbol of persecution\\". After reading Heart Berries himself, Grey comments that, ‚ÄúIt did kind of open up and help me understand her more and the depth of what she‚Äôs gone through and frankly the hurt I caused her,‚Äù he says. It was really beautiful and really hard to read, frankly. And I knew it was powerful and I knew it was amazing.‚Äù The afterword for the book is a question and answer session between Mailhot and Inupiaq American poet Joan Naviyuk Kane.  Family  Terese Marie Mailhot's mother, Karen Joyce Bobb Wahzinak, was featured as a character in Paul Simon's play. Terese Marie Mailhot's father Ken Paquette starred in a documentary Hope which was directed by filmmakers Stuart Reaugh and Thomas Buchan. Reception The Los Angeles Times described Heart Berries as \\"poetic, urgent, short, brutal and at times darkly humorous\\". The New York Times described it as \\"a sledgehammer\\", and although perhaps lacking in some focus, ultimately determined \\"give me narrative power and ambition over tidiness any day.\\" Writing in The Guardian, Diana Evans dubbed the book \\"startling\\", and full of, > ...raw and ragged pain, the poisonous effects of sexual abuse, of racial > cruelty, of violence and self-harm and drug addiction. But it is not without > a wry, deadpan humour and clever derision. Its quiet rage is directed > outwards towards the intangible yet definitive (white supremacy, male > supremacy), the unjust shape of the world, while a deep tenderness and > empathy are shown to those who share in the author's vulnerability... The Atlantic's Joe Fassler criticized the book's lack of exposition, writing that it \\"does everything it technically shouldn't, brushing off the familiar regimen prescribed by MFA programs, and slipping the strictures of commercial publishing.\\" However, he continues, that \\"the thrilling part is, it works,\\" and in the end is \\"a reminder that, in the right hands, literature can do anything it wants.\\" The Star Tribune similarly noted the unique style of the work, describing it as having an effect that is both \\"spooky and powerful,\\" but adding that, \\"although many critics have described this book with stuttering superlatives, readers will differ on whether it's poetic or incoherent, brilliant self-examination or wordy narcissism.\\" As of April 2018, Heart Berries had reached number 14 on The New York Times Best Seller list in the hardback non-fiction category. It was a finalist for the 2018 Hilary Weston Writers' Trust Prize for Nonfiction, with the winner to be announced on November 7, 2018. It was also named one of the best non-fiction books of 2018 by TIME, and reached number 10 on the Toronto Star's best seller list for Canadian non-fiction.

Overview This orbital mission will simulate and test two greenhouses that could be scaled up and assembled inside a lunar or Martian habitat to provide the crew with a local source of fresh food, while recycling human urine into fertiliser. Some microorganisms will be added to convert synthetic urine into easily digestible fertilisers for the tomatoes. The aim is to develop a stable, closed-loop, bio-regenerative life support system functioning in low gravity. In more detail, porous lava stones will be fitted in trickle filters and dried soil containing normal soil microbial colonies. Microbes then use nitrite () to convert the harmful ammonia () into nitrate (), which is then added to six tomato seeds as liquid fertiliser. In addition, the system incorporates a colony of the single-cell microorganism Euglena gracilis, which is a photosynthetic algae able to produce oxygen and biomass while protecting the whole system against high ammonia concentrations. This oxygen is necessary for the conversion of urine to nitrate until the photosynthetic oxygen production by the tomatoes is sufficient. Initially, the spacecraft will replicate lunar gravity on one greenhouse for a period of six months before simulating Martian gravity on the second greenhouse for the next six months. The level of gravity on the Moon (0.16 g) and Mars (0.38 g) are simulated by rotating the spacecraft's cylindrical body around its longitudinal axis. The experiments on different payloads are realized in different positions within the cylinder. Tomato seeds will germinate and plant growth will be monitored with 16 cameras, while radiometers called RAMIS (RAdiation Measurement In Space) will monitor the radiation inside and outside the spacecraft. The greenhouse is made of clear polycarbonate, with an approximate volume of . The closed system features moisture, pH, oxygen, pressure and temperature sensors, and is capable to control these parameters. Four small fans create airflow through a cooling device to maintain a stable \\"atmospheric\\" temperature. On top of the greenhouse, three lamps provide light in the correct spectrum for photosynthesis. Scanners and fluorometers measure cell density and photosynthetic yield. The fluids are monitored with seven electrodes to measure ammonium, nitrite, nitrate, pH, chloride, sodium, and potassium. To monitor the health of Euglena gracilis, the system also analyse the microbes' mRNA to determine which proteins ‚Äîand therefore which genes‚Äî are being commanded into action. Objectives The aim is to develop a stable, and symbiotic biological life support system while being exposed to gravity levels similar to those on the lunar surface as well as the surface of Mars. Both phases of experimentation will last for six months. With water being the only component that has been recycled so far and all other components being extracted and disposed, processing of urine is an issue in human space flight. Eu:CROPIS is intended to examine the possibility of using not only water, but also previously disposed waste to grow fruits and vegetables after proper conversion. Two life support systems (a nitrifying trickle filter system and the single-celled algae Euglena gracilis) within the satellite will be used for producing biomass out of artificial urine in a closed system. Furthermore, the algae Euglena gracilis will protect the biosystem against high levels of ammonia present in urine. Supporting science payloads * PowerCell (Payload 2, from NASA Ames Research Center) will investigate the performance of microbial mini-ecologies. These will contain the carbohydrate (sugar) products of photosynthesis, which will feed Bacillus subtilis, a robust bacterium commonly found in soil and the gut, which has already proven that it can withstand the rigors of space while in the spore form. A second objective of the PowerCell Payload is to conduct synthetic biology remotely in outer space. The basic technique for introducing genetic material into a living cell, called transformation, involves the transfer across a cells encasing membrane of genetic material. The PowerCell payload will examine if and how reduced gravity levels affect transformation processes. The third objective is to test protein production under different gravity regimes. Using the tools of synthetic biology, B. subtilis was engineered to produce several proteins which will be produced at the three different space gravity regimes. The ability to make proteins in space will be fundamental for human exploration, as proteins will be used to produce a range of critical substances, from on- demand food and vaccines to building materials. * Radiation Measurement in Space (Payload 3) has the goal of collecting data on long-term exposure to cosmic radiation over the course of the space flight * SCORE (Payload 4) is a technology demonstrator for next generation on-board computing in hardware and software developed by the DLR Institute of Space Systems. It is complemented by a set of three cameras that are commanded via SCORE. Satellite characteristics Both the satellite and the experiment are called Eu:CROPIS. The satellite features four gyroscopes, two magnetometers, three magnetic torque rods and a sun sensor in combination with a single-frequency Phoenix GPS receiver for attitude control.Attitude Control System of the Eu:CROPIS Mission.

It understands politics and policy making in a polity by focusing on governing challenges and strategic choices by the leadership at the top of government. Toby James used Bulpitt's original work to develop a neo-statecraft approach which could be used to understand politics and policy making across many political systems.  Origins  The origins of statecraft theory is in the work of British academic Jim Bulpitt. He argued the Conservative government of the early 1980s, under the leadership of Margaret Thatcher, were not motivated by ideological position. Instead, he controversially argued that they were motivated by winning power. What motivates politicians, he argued, was their objective of statecraft. This was defined as the ‚Äòart of winning elections and achieving some necessary degree of governing competence in office‚Äô.. In response to criticisms of the approach, later scholars sought to reflect on the philosophical underpinnings, provided more information about how it could be applied using empirical research and introduced new concepts. The term neo- statecraft was coined to capture the revised approach.  Neo-Statecraft Theory  The more recent neo-statecraft variant has a number of core assumptions. # The primary focus is on the political leader of the state and their closest advisers. The group is referred to as the leadership 'Court'. # The Court is a unitary, rational and self-interested actor with the primary governing objective of winning and maintaining power. Rather than seeking to achieve any ideological goals, the Court seeks to achieve statecraft. # In order to achieve statecraft, they have to undertake five key tasks: * Governing competence ‚Äì governments and leaders need to be seen as competent at managing the country‚Äôs affairs, particularly the economy. * Party management ‚Äì managing parliamentary backbenchers, constituency associations and pressure groups carefully. * Developing a winning electoral strategy ‚Äì creating a set of policies and image that creates momentum in the polls. * Political argument hegemony ‚Äì winning the battle of ideas in elite debates * Bending the rules of the game ‚Äì they will seek to tilt the political game by introducing constitutional reforms that makes statecraft easier. The Court will find itself in a strategically selective context, which might make statecraft easier or more difficult to achieve. It has been argued, for example, that Gordon Brown faced a particularly difficult context to govern in because of the financial crisis. The approach is premised in critical realism and compatible with work historical institutionalism, rather than positivist and behaviouralist approaches to political science. Applications The approach has been used in a variety of settings, such as a method for assessing political leaders. Using the approach, assessments have been made of Tony Blair and Nicolas Sarkozy. It has also been applied to understand how and why elites change electoral laws and the British policy towards the European Union References Category:Political science Category:Public policy ","title":"Statecraft (political science)"},{"id":"58583404","text":"Klimovichskiy Uyezd () was an administrative unit of the Mogilev Governorate, Russian Empire, which existed between the years of 1777 and 1927.

All of his victims wore pantyhoses, which became known as the killer's \\"calling card.\\"–ë–∞–∑–∞ –¥–∞–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö  Biography  Tsiuman was born on January 30, 1969 in the city of Taganrog. He had a difficult childhood: his parents were chronic alcoholics who constantly beat him, and even threatened to kill him, something for which his father was repeatedly tried for. When his father became seriously ill and lay helplessly in one of the rooms, his mother began to bring in lovers and engaged in sex with them in front of her son. During his childhood Yuri practically did not communicate with peers, but was considered a quiet and calm character, always sitting on the bench at the entrance at his grandmother's house. He was even instructed to roll children in wheelchairs around the yard. As an adult, he was considered an intelligent person, but he had a passion for thriller films (for watching novelties he even specially provided himself with cable TV), was an alcoholic and had problems in dealing with the opposite sex. The first murder was committed in 1986, attacking a girl on the night of December 24 to 25. At first, she resisted, but then suggested that the maniac go to her home - in the hope that there was somebody there, but there was nobody. In the apartment, Tsiuman tied her up, then beat, raped and strangled her (or tried to strangle her). Before leaving, he robbed and set fire to the apartment. Information about the fate of Tsiuman's first victim differs: in one source it is said that the arson failed and the girl survived; in the other, that she died. From 1987 to 1989 there were no murders, as he served in the army at the time. In late June 1989, he committed a new attack on another girl and tried to rape her, but she managed to escape from the maniac and run away. Between 1990 and 1991, he raped and killed four girls in Taganrog (night from May 12 to 13, night from May 26 to 27, night from September 14 to 15, 1990 and June 2, 1991). As victims, he chose girls who wore black pantyhoses, which he left on the bodies of the strangled victims. Yuri Tsiuman was not very cautious of his actions: on November 26, 1992 the maniac was detained by random passers-by when attempting to commit a new murder. By this time the investigation had a lot of evidence against Tsiuman, including a blood group, hair samples and fingerprints. On February 11, 1994, Tsiuman was sentenced to death for 4 murders, but since a moratorium was imposed on the death penalty, it was replaced with life imprisonment. He is currently in the Black Dolphin Prison in Sol-Iletsk. In 2011, he unsuccessfully tried to challenge the replacement of the death penalty with life imprisonment in the Supreme Court of Russia, considering imprisonment as a deterioration of his position.‚Ññ –ì–ö–ü–ò11-747 ‚Äî –ó–∞—è–≤–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å (–∏—Å—Ç–µ—Ü): –¶—é–º–∞–Ω –Æ—Ä–∏–π –õ–µ–æ–Ω–∏–¥–æ–≤–∏—á. –û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç—á–∏–∫: –ü—Ä–µ–∑–∏–¥–µ–Ω—Ç –†–§  In the media  * Episode \\"A look inside\\" from the series \\"Russian psychiatrist\\" (1996). * Episode \\"The Triangle of Death\\" from the series \\"Unexplained, but fact\\" (2005). * Episode \\"Dashing 90's\\" from the series \\"Chikatilo's Successors\\" (2007). * \\"Hunting for maniacs\\" - Channel First (2008). * Episode \\"Black Tights Killers\\" from the series \\"The investigation was conducted..\\" (2011). * \\"Your bitch\\" - song by performer ZAMAI (2016).

It was built from 1828 to 1835 by Thomas Michael Pembroke. It is also known as Woodmans Inn, King's Arms Inn, Buss's Inn, Woodford House and Woodford Academy. The property is owned by the National Trust of Australia (NSW). It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 1 March 2002.  History  The site was that of an early road gang's encampment.Jack, 2014. In November 1824 Thomas Michael Pembroke was promised a land grant of . In the late 1820s the site was occupied by William James. By 1830 James had erected improvements on the land.CLP, 1984. In November 1830 Pembroke was promised of land. he applied for his land at Twenty Mile Hollow (Woodford). By 1831 Pembroke had made a selection of land at the site partly including James' improvements. By September 1832 Pembroke was given possession of the land. By 1833 Pembroke's hut existed (on the right hand (north) side of the road adjacent to James' improvements. His weatherboard 'Woodman's Inn' possibly existed by 1833; it definitely existed by 1835 (Licensee Michael Pembroke)Australian Almanac & Directory, in CLP, 1984. when described by Messrs. Backhouse and Walker as \\"a miserable hovel adjoining a public house which we declined entering some weeks before from the wretched appearance of the place\\". On 28 October 1835 Pembroke was granted of land. By 1835 Woodman's Inn (in weatherboard) existed on the site of the early road gangs' encampment at Twenty Mile Hollow. In 1836 William James stood trial for the murder of his wife. Pembroke called it \\"The Woodman Inn\\" and he lived there with his wife and 6 children. The inn provided food and lodgings for travellers from Sydney on their way to Bathurst and the Western Plains. Soldiers and colonial officials were some of their guests. Pembroke was granted a further at what was then known as \\"Twenty Mile Hollow\\". He fell on hard times, heavily mortgaging the property and being sentenced to two years on a road gang for stealing slabs of wood at Springwood. His sentence was later reduced to one year but forced him to sell \\"The Woodman Inn\\" in 1839.BMACHO, 2014. In 1839 he sold it to Michael Hogan. At the time it was leased by G. K. Bryant. His weatherboard building was developed into a stone inn, the Kings Arms, under Michael Hogan in 1842 (the present west wing). In 1841 the grant measured . An 1842 sketch of the \\"Inn at Twenty Mile Hollow\\" shows a building unlike the present buildings. From 1842-44 Col.John Edward Bull had a camp for a road gang nearby. It is possible families stayed at the Inn. In 1843 James Nairn was licensee of the King's Arms Hotel, succeeded in 1846 by William Barton, 1847 by John Cobcroft and 1854 by Thomas James. In 1855 Hogan sold the property to William Buss. From 1856-57 Buss held the license of 'The King's Arms' Hotel. The inn was more popularly known as \\"Buss\\" Inn'. a Police Lock Up was built to the inn's west (now demolished). By 1862, during William Buss's occupancy, the kitchen wings were added. From 1867 until 1897 it was a private country retreat, owned by Alfred Fairfax, and from 1897 to 1907 it was a boarding house. In 1863 a railway plan denotes the buildings as the 'King's Arms Inn' showing the main building and dairy building in their existing form. The kitchen building is in three parts. Nearby there are a number of other timber buildings, now demolished. In 1867 Buss left a life interest in the property to his wife, Bridget Buss. In 1868 the railway line reached the Weatherboard Inn at Wentworth Falls. In August 1868 the widow Mrs Buss sold the property to Alfred Fairfax. A March 1869 sketch of \\"Buss's\\" by John Vine Hall shows the present complex. In October 1869 it was advertised as 'Mountain air Woodford (late Buss's) Apartments vacant J.Sheils'. In 1869 Woodford was possibly occupied by caretaker Sheils. The property was then . An 1869 drawing by Vine Hall shows the main and dairy buildings in their present form. The dairy has a shingled roof and green-painted shutters. A picket fence had been built. A pear tree (Pyrus communis cv.) has been identified on a (now) adjacent block of land that appears to date directly from the Fairfax period of ownership of the property (1860/70), suggests local horticulturist teacher with TAFE, Doug Knowles. The tree is most likely to be the last remnant of an orchard and garden planted for Fairfax, who developed the property as a gentleman's residence. Fairfax renamed his home \\"Woodford House\\" and built the second storey east wing, primarily to accommodate his Sydney friends and their servants. It became an exclusive retreat for he and his friends. During his time here he bought more land and then owned 90 acres on which he created an orchard and house garden to provide fresh food for his guests. Fairfax had \\"house and servants\\" at Woodford. In 1874 an observation was made of the transit of Venus 200 yards to the west of Woodford. Members of the scientific community visited the Fairfax property to observe the phenomenon. Portable observatories were set up in tents for the observations. In 1876 the property was leased or at least in the possession of Mr. Hague- Smith. In 1879 the house was still described as Mr. Fairfax's \\"commodious residence and large gardens namded Woodford\\". In Hague-Smith made additions to the kitchen building and opened the property as a guest house: \\"Woodford House\\". From October 1881 until 1907 it is said to have been a fashionable guest and function house. Names of clients included George Walker, Arnott, Sir William Patrick Manning and Sir Archibold Philip Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery. On 29 June 1897 (Fairfax losing money in his financial dealings in mining ventures) the property was put up for auction and sold to David Flannery. At this time it was described as a sanatorium with two blocks of land and . 'buildings are substantial...accommodation is large...pleasure grounds and orchard extensive...' Flannery subdivided and sold some of the land. Pre 1902 the railway zig zag at Lapstone was bypassed. A March 1903 inventory of the contents was made, with the rooms named and another made in 1905. Pre 1906 the property was used as a private hospital by Dr. Mark Henry Long. In November 1906 it was sold under the Real Property Act (occupied by Edward Graves). =Use as a school= From 1907 to 1934 under lessee (and distinguished classics scholar) John Frazer McManamey, it became a significant school, the Woodford Academy, in competition and then in succession to Cooerwull Academy at Lithgow, the other major Presbyterian school outside Sydney, where McManamey had previously taught. John McManamey was a Scottish policeman's son from Wellington, educated at an Anglican boarding school, All Saints' College in Bathurst, then at the University of Sydney, where he lived at St. Andrew's College. At University and College he was enabled to indulge his passions for classical literature, and extended them into English literature, while living a vigorous outdoor and sporting life. After graduation he was founding headmaster of Dr. Aspinall's Scots College in Sydney (now in Bellevue Hill). He left to found his own school, the Australian College and then went to Queensland to be senior classics master at the renowned Ipswich Grammar School. In 1903 he returned to NSW's central west to be rector of Cooerwull Academy, but again ventured out to create a school of his own in 1907. This was Woodford Academy, directed, like Cooerwull, towards the Sydney University entry examination and elite learning generally. This was a significant school, in competition and then in succession to Lithgow's Cooerwull Academy (which McManamey had been rector of from 1903-7). Woodford Academy was a case of adapting much older buildings to school use, while supplementing the old with a custom-made wing. Over 300 students were educated in the Blue Mountains location between 1907 and 1925, benefitting from a curriculum based on the liberal arts with commercial subjects available for those intending to enter business life. There are tales of daily morning swims, even in the winter months, to encourage hygiene and develop character. Confident that his students would \\"make their mark on history\\", McManamey encouraged his boys to engrave their initials into their school desks and the rock shelves that surround the school buildings. They did so, but many made their mark in ways unimaginable at the time, distinguishing themselves for their actions in both world wars.Burgess, 2014, 8 In December 1908 it was subdivided and the greater part sold to Mary Jane Waterhouse, mother of Eben Gowrie Waterhouse, later of Sydney University and Eryldene, Gordon. In 1910 the timber concert room was blown over. In 1913 Mrs McManamey died. In July 1914 the remainder of including the buildings was sold to John Frazer McManamey. Over the duration of World War I, fifty four boys from Woodford Academy enlisted to serve King and country. Their names are listed on an Honour Roll Call, and the National Trust's Woodford Academy Management Committee hopes family and friends will recognise names and come forward with additional information on the boys. This will be added to research carried out as the basis for a display at the Academy commemorating the centenary of the Anzacs from August 2014 to November 2018. Interactive ebooks are progressively developed and displayed at the Academy museum on the centenary of the month each boy enlisted for the Great War. From 1924-1965 the Academy Dining Hall was used for Presbyterian church services. Between 1924 and 1968 the land was further subdivided. The Academy closed in 1925 and McManamey used the building as a private residence. He reopened the school for local children in 1930, closing it again in 1936.BMACHO #30, 2013, 17. After the Academy closed to all but private tuition in 1936,Jack, 2014: says 1934 the McManamey family lived privately in the house. John Frazier McManamey died in 1946. In February 1949 Miss Gertrude McManamey inherited it. The kitchen verandah was reconstructed in s. From the 1950s-70s the east wing was used as a shop on two occasions. The kitchen wing was used as a flat. In 1961 land to the academy's east was donated to the Presbyterian Church. In 1976 the kitchen verandah was removed. In 1978 the Department of Main Roads proposed road widening which slightly reduced the area of the site. From 1978-82 repair and conservation works were done for the National Trust of Australia by Clive Lucas P/L, including conversion of s5 to a bathroom; conversion of s9 to a kitcken; repair of windows to s9, s10 and s6; repair of rear door s8, removal of a vine and repair of stone walls to the dairy building; repair of the roof and eaves to the main building and providing new downpipes and gutters; reconstruction of the chimney over space 8. =Management by the National Trust of Australia= In April 1979Jack: 2013 says 1978 Miss Gertrude McManamey gifted the property to the National Trust of Australia (NSW). BMACHO suggests Miss McManamey's gift was on condition she could live there until she died. She died in 1988, having left the property in 1986 to be cared for at the Queen Victoria Homes, .O'Keefe & McCann, August 2014, 14. Barry O'Keefe , former President of the Board of the National Trust of Australia (NSW), regularly visited Woodford Academy, which he loved and had visited since the Trust first negotiated with Gertrude McManamey over its acquisition, when it was falling down around her. He used his own money, spending a substantial amount to restore parts of the building particularly the eastern part of the main building. He did this unheralded and in the manner which marked his ethos of service. The National Trust received a $1m Centenary of Federation grant from the Australian Government in 2001 which O'Keefe had a major part in obtaining, to help restore the property.BMACHO, August 2014, 14. Visitation to Woodford Academy increased 600 per cent in 2013/14 due largely to a widely expanded programme of events showcasing local artists, performers and historians and partnerships in local events. New primary and high school programmes have been launched, museum displays have been updated, the dining hall repainted, sandstone re- laid on the front verandah and external timberwork repaired.Silink & Hayes, 2014. A lively new volunteer team at Woodford Academy have turned the fortunes of the property around from 2013-2015, also making it a centre for Blue Mountains artistic innovation. Cutting-edge performances using local talent to interpret the historic complex with sound, light, coour, taste - in new ways not before contemplated. Ghosts provide evening entertainment. The \\"Make your mark in history\\" project, developed to commemorate students of the Academy who fought in World War I received a 2015 National Trust Heritage Award. The Norman Lindsay Gallery, Everglades and Woodford Academy were all represented in the Blue Mountains Winter Magic street festival which attracted over 30,000 people.National Trust of Australia, 2015, 4.  Description  =Site= The features contemporary with the construction of the building such as sandstone flagging, the stone tank, make a large contribution to the significance of the complex and should be considered as an integral part of the buildings. Not much seems to have survived from the Fairfax and guest house periods with the possible exception of some of the paving and perhaps the water pumps. These are also important as parts of this phase of the development of the buildings. Of all the site features however, the engraved (with boy students of the Academy's names: there are many such, e.g. RSBS who was Ralph Sanders Barclay Sillar, a student in 1909 and after World War I, a successful lawyer, who lived on until 1970) on the massive rock shelves at the site's rear (east) are probably the most interesting because they graphically demonstrate the use of the building as a school in the early 20th century. The various names personalise the history of the building (sic: site). In addition to any inherent significance the landscape at the site may have (not surveyed) the existing landscape does provide an aesthetically pleasing setting for the historic buildings. A number of the mature trees are clearly remnants of the Victorian and Edwardian period(s). Four Monterey pine trees (Pinus radiata) flank the south-west edge of the property onto the Great Western Highway. A large mature and significant eucalypt tree grows close to the centre of the main building facing the highway. Three more Monterey pines, two poplars, a lemon-scented gum and two paths - one stone, one brick, comprise the southern front boundary plantings, running roughly from mid-main building to both sides of the rough driveway and the property's eastern boundary shared with the Presbyterian church. To the west of the building complex an area of poplars, suckers and undergrowth with Nile lilies (Agapanthus orientalis/praecox), weeds and other undergrowth existed. To the north (rear) of the building complex a similar area of poplar suckers, undergrowth, rubbish tip, septic tank, piles of building debris, a fruit tree and black bean (Castanospermum australe) fill the \\"courtyard\\" space between wing buildings which are located at right angles to the main building. Areaas of sandstone paving are also part of this \\"space\\". A concrete drive and garage building are located to the main building complex's east, the former located close to the Presbyterian church across the boundary.Stuart Read, from plan in CLP, 1984 Inspection of the site indicates curtilage lines other than the boundaries of the present land ownership are appropriate. The mid-range views of paddocks from the rear of the property are pleasant and it would be unfortunate if this area were developed. The boundary here is very close and a more suitable line is at the old fence line further to the north. The lot to the east (Presbyterian church) is the most intrusive of the neighbouring properties and here the boundary is also very close. A more suitable line is the west side of the church. None of the neighbouring buildings are particularly detrimental to the character of the Woodford Academy. The most significant surviving feature of the site is the maintenance of the historic link between the buildings and the Great Western Highway. Here the curtilage should extend to the railway property on the other side of the road with the view of controlling development directly opposite the site. =Building complex= The Woodford Academy shows layers of growth from the original two-roomed inn at the east end of the south block to the present footprint. Original South Wing The original south wing (i.e., east end) is a symmetrical single storey sandstone building facing south to the Great Western Highway. The gabled roof is clad in galvanised iron (Moorewood & Rogers) tiles and has a brick chimney at the east end. A verandah on the south side is broken back to the main roof and has a beaded verandah plate, stop chamfered columns and a flagged floor. A 6-panel door with bead flush lower panels, fielded top panels and a diagonally divided toplight is at the centre of the wing. It is flanked by 8 over 8 pane double hung windows. The north wall of the original wing has 2 no. 6 over 6 pane double hung windows. Floor is abutted boards (not tongue-and-groove). West Extension (South Wing) The west extension of the south wing is an L-shaped gabled wing with a sandstone chimney at the west end. The verandah roofline is an extension of the original verandah but is skillioned. The galvanised iron (Moorewood & Rogers) tile roof is also used on this extension and has boxed eaves. A pair of french doors with bead flush lower panel and a toplight open to the east end of the verandah. A pair of 2 panelled doors with a toplight are off centre in the south wall opening to the verandah. 6 over 6 pane double hung windows with 3 pane toplights are also in this wall. A 4-panel door opens from the east side of the west leg of the wing. 6 over 6 pane double hung windows are in the north and south gabled wails with 4 over 6 pane double hung windows built to imitate casements, in the gable above. The windows in the south wall are shuttered. The west wall of the wing has 6 over 6 pane double hung windows. 2 no. hipped roof bay form dormers are in the west roof slope and have double hung windows detailed to look like casements. The sandstone verandah flagging extends around the wing. = Condition = As at 20 June 2013, the property in early 1984 (both site and buildings) were in very poor condition pre repair and conservation works). The buildings were however in very intact state and some repairs had been done to the main building. The Trust's Garden Committee had commenced a preliminary clearing of undergrowth. This site has a very high archaeological significance and potential. The fabric is almost entirely original and of the last century. The Woodford Academy retains the intact layout and significant amounts of furniture and memorabilia of an early 20th century private boarding school typical of the period prior to the introduction of government secondary school education in NSW .McDonald, 1998. = Modifications and dates = *1828The Colonial Georgian Style building *1840A larger \\"T\\" shaped wing with attic was added to the five bay section. *1860Building was added to in 1860.

Heritage listing  As at 29 March 2001, the earliest house in the mountains, Woodford Academy has had a distinguished history as a major private school as well as a Victorian country retreat, a significant inn and a seventy-year association with the McManamey family. There is a fair degree of complexity in the evolution of this site and it is therefore of high archaeological significance in its ability to reveal details about possibly William James' hut, the Woodman's Inn, the King's Arms Inn, the grave yard, Woodford House, and Woodford Academy. These include matters such as the earlier configurations of the buildings and other features and the lifestyle of the occupants over time. The site has considerable historical archaeological value and research potential to demonstrate the general character of its types of occupation from the early nineteenth century onwards. Previous monitoring of works indicates that significant archaeological deposits survive here which will provide evidence of the specific construction, form, nature, function and occupation of this former buildings and other structures on this site and its environs. Woodford Academy was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 1 March 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The earliest house in the mountains, Woodford Academy has had a distinguished history as a major private school as well as a Victorian country retreat, a significant inn and a seventy- year association with the McManamey family. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Woodford Academy is the only surviving example of a Victorian Georgian sandstone inn in the Blue Mountains. It has been extended and altered for its various uses but still retains its essential Georgian character especially in the south verandahs and their sandstone flagging. The south wing of the house retains its original small pane window sashes and attic window designed to appear as casements. The building has some unusual features such as the bay form dormer windows in the westem roof slope. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Anecdotal evidence further suggests that it is regarded as a heritage icon by both the Blue Mountains community and passing traffic, being highly visible from the main road.Levins, 1990. Of social significance being a well known Inn along the Western Road for much of its early history and more recently having various other uses including a school, Woodford Academy and a private residence. Overall the use and construction of place reflects the social history of the Blue Mountains. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. There is a fair degree of complexity in the evolution of this site and it is therefore of high archaeological significance in its ability to reveal details about possibly William James' hut, the Woodman's Inn, the King's Arms Inn, the grave yard, Woodford House, and Woodford Academy.

The field developed from comparative psychology where early studies focused more on animal behavior. Researchers have examined insect cognition in bees, fruit flies, and wasps. Research questions consist of experiments aimed to evaluate insects abilities with perception, attention, memory (wasp multiple nest), spatial cognition, tools use, problem solving, and concepts. Unlike in animal behavior the concept of group cognition plays a big part in insect studies. It is hypothesized some insect classes like ants and bees think with a group cognition to function within their societies; more recent studies show that individual cognition exists and plays a role in overall group cognitive task. Insect cognition experiments have been more prevalent in the past decade than prior. It is logical for the understanding of cognitive capacities as adaptations to differing ecological niches under the Cognitive faculty by species when analyzing behaviors, this means viewing behaviors as adaptations to an individual's environment and not weighing them more advanced when compared to other different individuals.  Insect foraging cognition  Insects foraging on a yellow flower Insects inhabit many diverse and complex environments within which they must find food. Cognition shapes how an insect comes to find its food. The particular cognitive abilities used by insects in finding food has been the focus of much scientific inquiry. The social insects are often study subjects and much has been discovered about the intelligence of insects by investigating the abilities of bee species. Fruit flies are also common study subjects.  Learning and memory  = Learning biases = Through learning, insects can increase their foraging efficiency, decreasing the time spent searching for food which allows for more time and energy to invest in other fitness related activities, such as searching for mates. Depending on the ecology of the insect certain cues may be used to learn to quickly identify food sources. Over evolutionary time insects may develop evolved learning biases that reflect the food source they feed on. Biases in learning allow insects to quickly associate relevant features of the environment that are related to food. For example, bees have an unlearned preference for radiating and symmetric patterns ‚Äî features of natural flowers bees forage on. Additionally, bees that have no foraging experience tend to have an unlearned preference for the colours that an experienced forager would learn faster. These colours tend to be those of highly rewarding flowers in that particular environment. = Time-place learning = In addition to more typical cues like colour and odour, insects are able to use time as a foraging cue. Time is a particularly important cue for pollinators. Pollinators forage on flowers which tend to vary predictably in time and space, depending on the flower species, pollinators can learn the timing of blooming of flower species to develop more efficient foraging routes. Bees learn at which times and in which areas sites are rewarding and change their preference for particular sites based on the time of day. These time-based preferences have been shown to be tied to a circadian clock in some insects. In the absence of external cues honeybees will still show a shift in preference for a reward depending on time strongly implicating an internal time-keeping mechanism, i.e. the circadian clock, in modulating the learned preference. Moreover, not only can bees remember when a particular site is rewarding but they can also remember at what times multiple different sites are profitable. Certain butterfly species also show evidence for time-place learning due to their trap-line foraging behaviour. This is when an animal consistently visits the same foraging sites in a sequential manner across multiple days and is thought to be suggestive of a time-place learning ability. = Innovation Capacity = 489x489px Insects are also capable of behavioural innovations. Innovation is defined as the creation of a new or modified learned behaviour not previously found in the population. Innovative abilities can be experimentally studied in insects through the use of problem solving tasks. When presented with a string-pulling task, many bumblebees cannot solve the task, but a few can innovate the solution. Those that initially could not solve the task can learn to solve it by observing an innovator bee solving the task. These learned behaviours can then spread culturally through bee populations. More recent studies in insects have begun to look at what traits (e.g. exploratory tendency) predict the propensity for an individual insect to be an innovator.  Social aspects of insect foraging  = Social learning of foraging sites = Insects can learn about foraging sites through observation or interaction with other individuals, termed social learning. This has been demonstrated in bumblebees. Bumblebees become attracted to rewarding flowers more quickly if they are occupied by other bumblebees and more quickly learn to associate that flower species with reward. Seeing a conspecific on a flower enhances preferences for flowers of that type. Additionally, bumblebees will rely more on social cues when a task is difficult compared to when a task is simple. Ants will show conspecifics food sites they have discovered in a process called tandem running. This is considered to be a rare instance of teaching, a specialized form of social learning, in the animal kingdom. Teaching involves consistent interactions between a tutor and a pupil and the tutor typically incurs some sort of cost in order to transmit the relevant information to the pupil. In the case of tandem running the ant is temporarily decreasing its own foraging efficiency in order to demonstrate to the pupil the location of a foraging site. = Evidence for Cumulative culture = Studies in bumblebees have provided evidence that some insects can engage in cumulative culture, the act of refining existing behaviours into more efficient forms. Bumblebees are able to improve upon a task where they must pull a ball to a particular location, a previously socially learned behaviour, by using a more optimal route compared to the route that their demonstrator used. This demonstration of refinement of a previously observed existing behaviour is a rudimentary form of cumulative culture.  Neural basis of insect foraging  = Role of mushroom bodies = 334x334px One important and highly studied brain region involved in insect foraging are the mushroom bodies, a structure implicated in insect learning and memory abilities. The mushroom body consists of two large stalks called peduncles which have cup-shaped projections on their ends called calyces. The role of the mushroom bodies is in sensory integration and associative learning. They allow the insect to pair sensory information and reward. Experiments where the function of the mushroom bodies are impaired through ablation find that organisms are behaviourally normal but have impaired learning. Flies with impaired mushroom bodies cannot form an odour association and cockroaches with impaired mushroom bodies cannot make use of spatial information to form memories about locations.  Mushroom body plasticity  Mushroom bodies can change in size throughout the lifespan of an insect. There is evidence these changes are related to the onset of foraging as well as the experience of foraging. In some Hymenoptera mushroom bodies increase in size when nurses become foragers and begin to forage for the colony. Young bees begin as nurses tending to the feeding and sanitation of the hive‚Äôs larvae. As a bee ages it undergoes a shift in tasks from nurse to forager, leaving the hive to collect pollen. This shift in job leads to changes in gene expression within the brain which are associated with an increase in mushroom body size. Some butterflies have also been shown to undergo an experience-dependent increase in mushroom body size. The period of greatest increase in brain size typically is associated with a period of learning through experiences with foraging demonstrating the importance of this structure in insect foraging cognition. = Mushroom body evolution = Multiple insect taxa have independently evolved larger mushroom bodies. The spatial cognition demands of foraging has been implicated in cases where more sophisticated mushroom bodies have evolved. Cockroaches and bees, which are in different orders, both forage over a large area and make use of spatial information to return to foraging sites and central places which likely explains their larger mushroom bodies. Contrast this with a dipteran such as the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, which has relatively small mushroom bodies and less complex spatial learning demands.

He is remembered for his relationship and marriage to Margaret Winster or Vinstar, a Danish woman who helped him escape from prison.William Fraser, Memorials of the family of Wemyss of Wemyss, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1888), 62-4.: Robert Chambers, Domestic Annals of Scotland, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1848), pp. 239-240. Duke of Lennox on Edinburgh's High Street Quarrel with the Duke of Lennox In 1590 James VI gave him ¬£333 Scots from the subsidy money that Queen Elizabeth had given him.Miles Kerr-Peterson & Michael Pearce, 'James VI's English Subsidy and Danish Dowry Accounts, 1588-1596', Scottish History Society Miscellany XVI (Woodbridge, 2020), p. 56, 59. On 7 January 1591 he came to the attention of Robert Bowes, the English diplomat in Edinburgh who described a fight on Edinburgh's Royal Mile. Logie had upset or made Ludovic Stewart, 2nd Duke of Lennox jealous in an incident in the king's bed chamber. Bowes said the offence was \\"his disobedience\\" shown to the Duke. Lennox confronted Logie on the street and hit him on the head with his sword. King James, who was walking behind Logie, was dragged into a shop for safety.Robert Chambers, Domestic Annals of Scotland, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1848), p. 222. Lennox was commanded to leave the court for a while, for fighting near the king's person.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 450. Some further details were recorded by David Calderwood. In his version Logie's offence was to refuse to leave the bedchamber at Lennox's command, (Lennox was Chamberlain), Alexander Lord Home helped Lennox attack Logie, and the king's refuge was a skinner's shop where he .Thomas Thomson ed., History of the Kirk of Scotland by David Calderwood, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1844), pp. 116-7. Soon after, Lennox was returned to court by the queen's intervention.Leeds Barroll, Anna of Denmark (Pennsylvania, 2001), p. 17. Logie remained in favour, and was probably the valet who attended the king at the wedding of Lilias Murray, the Laird of Tullibardine's daughter, and John Grant of Freuchie on 21 June 1591.Jemma Field, Anna of Denmark: The Material and Visual Culture of the Stuart Courts (Manchester, 2020), p. 135. The king and his valet changed into costumes with helmets and masks and performed a masque for the guests at Tullibardine.Michael Pearce, 'Anna of Denmark: Fashioning a Danish Court in Scotland', The Court Historian, 24:2 (2019) p. 149. Escape from Dalkeith Later in 1592 Logie helped Francis Stewart, 5th Earl of Bothwell who was a rebel against the king.Alan Stewart, The Cradle King (London, 2004), p. 133. In August Lennox arrested Logie with Michael Balfour of Burleigh. Logie confessed to planning four different attempts to capture the king. One involved Margaret Winstar, Danish maid of honour to the queen, and Logie's mistress and fianc√©. She would steal the keys to the back gate of Dalkeith Palace and let in Bothwell's men. When James interrogated him, Logie was immediately cooperative and withheld nothing, saying that many other servants were allies of Bothwell, in part because they had not been paid. Logie said that Bothwell had received money from Spain, but the Laird of Burleigh said this was only a rumour intended to show that Bothwell had Spanish backing and so encourage his faction. Bowes thought that James would want to have Logie executed, but the queen and Margaret Winster, who was from a well-connected family and thought to be related to the queen, would work to save his life.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 751: Thomas Thomson ed., History of the Kirk of Scotland by David Calderwood, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1844), 207. Logie was imprisoned in Dalkeith Palace. He escaped with the help of Margaret Winster who slept in the queen's bedchamber. Winster asked the guards to bring the prisoner to the queen, and then led him through the queen's bedchamber to a window where she had left a rope (or a pair sheets). An accomplice was waiting below with a horse.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), pp. 752-5: Calendar of Border Papers, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1894), 405: Thomas Thomson ed., History of the Kirk of Scotland by David Calderwood, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1844), pp. 173-4. The story of the escape is the basis of the ballad, \\"The Laird of Logie\\". The queen was asked to send Winster back to Denmark but she refused, instead she stayed at Wemyss for a while. On 9 November 1592 Anne of Denmark wrote to the Laird of Wemyss to thank him for looking after her.William Fraser, Memorials of the family of Wemyss of Wemyss, vol. 3 (Edinburgh, 1888), p. 31 and plate. David Moysie wrote an account of the escape in Scots, here given with a modernised version; > the same nycht that he was examinat, he escapit out by the meanis of a > gentlewoman quhom he loved, a Dence, quho convoyed him out of his keiperis > handis throw the Queinis chalmer, quhaire his Majestie and the Queine wer > lyand in thair beddis, till a wyndow in the backsyde of the plaice, quhair > he gead doun upone a tow, and schot thrie pistoletis in takin of his > onlouping, quhaire sum of his servants with the laird of Nithrie wer > awaiting him. > > the same night that he was examined, he escaped out by the means of a > gentlewoman he loved, a Dane, who conveyed him out of his keeper's hands > through the Queen's chamber, where his majesty and the queen were lying in > their beds, to a window at the back of the place, where he climbed down on a > rope, and shot three pistols as a sign of his getaway, where some of his > servants with the Laird of Niddry were waiting for him.James Dennistoun, > Moysie's Memoirs of the Affairs of Scotland (Edinburgh, 1830), p. 95. Logie was pardoned by James VI on 29 November 1592.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), pp. 818, 821. He was in Scotland in April 1594 and married in May, a charter of December 1594 names his wife as \\"Margaret Weiksterne\\". A chronicle states that Sir Peter Young, the king's almoner and ambassador to Denmark, paid her dowry.William Fraser, Memorials of the family of Wemyss of Wemyss, vol. 1, pp. 178-9; vol. 3, p. 31; Annie Cameron, Warrender Papers, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1932), p. 53. Their marriage contract was dated November 1593 and March 1594, for Logie to inherit Myrecairnie, Wester Cruivie, Brighouse, and Logie. James VI also planned to make the lands of Logie a barony.Acts of the Parliaments of Scotland, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1817), pp. 124-5; see the register of the privy seal, PS1/67 f.62-3. The story of the escape is also told in the contemporary narrative The Historie and Life of King James the Sext. The author calls Margaret \\"Twynstoun\\", although her Danish family name may have been \\"Venstermand\\".Thomas Riis, Should auld acquaintance be forgot, vol. 2 (Odense 1988), pp. 296-7. He draws attention to her role in the rescue as an act of charity and a good example for posterity, concluding that by \\"hir gude cheritable help he happilie escapit be the subteltie of loove\\".Thomas Thomson ed., The Historie and Life of King James the Sext (Edinburgh, 1825), pp. 253-4. The author of the Historie may have been Mr John Colville, who was also an ally of Bothwell, and mentioned Logie in a letter to Henry Lock, a poet and agent of Sir Robert Cecil.Dierdre Serjeantson, 'English Bards and Scotch Poetics', in Crawford Gribben & David George Mullan,Literature and the Scottish Reformation (Farnham, 2009), pp. 164-5. In June 1593 Robert Bowes described Logie's role in another much less romantic incident. James Gray, a servant of king James and brother of the Master of Gray, had abducted and married Catherine Carnegie daughter of John, Laird of Carnegie. She protested and was given a refuge in house of Robert Jousie in Edinburgh, a cloth merchant and business partner of Thomas Foulis. Gray sent his friend Logie to quietly break into the house. When he discovered that she was still inside, he signalled to James Sandilands and other accomplices to break down the doors and carry her back to Gray, while Lord Home and his followers prevented rescuers. Catherine eventually married Sir John Hamilton of Lettrick.Annie I. Cameron, Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 98 no. 69: Scots Peerage, vol. 8 (Edinburgh, 1911), p. 58. Intrigue and execution Logie was in London in March 1594. William Keith of Delny wrote to the Scottish resident agent in London, James Hudson, that both James VI and Anna of Denmark had told him that Logie had no diplomatic mission from them.Thomas Birch, Memorials of the Reign of Queen Elizabeth, vol. 1 (London, 1754), pp. 161-2. In April 1594 James VI came to Rossend Castle in Fife to arrest those suspected of intrigue with Bothwell, including Logie and Archibald Wauchope of Niddrie. Logie gave himself up to the king and was released into the custody of his kinsman the Laird of Wester Wemyss.Annie I. Cameron, Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 11 (London, 1936), pp. 308-10. In August 1594 he was again implicated in Bothwell's rebellion and was arrested on his way to Stirling Castle for the banquet at the baptism of Prince Henry. He was imprisoned at Blackness Castle then in Edinburgh Castle, and threatened with execution.David Laing, Original Letters of John Colville (Edinburgh, 1858), pp. 120, 123, 128: Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 420 no. 336. Again the queen intervened for his life and he was released. Margaret, now called \\"Lady Logie\\", had gone to Denmark or Holstein in June to see her family and returned to Scotland after a year in July 1595. Roger Aston heard she had been to see the queen's mother Sophie of Mecklenburg-G√ºstrow and brought back the message that the queen ought to obey the king in all things.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1936), nos. 346, 360, 373, 636. Logie had been in London in June 1595 when James Hudson wrote to Sir Robert Cecil that he had gone Holland with Mr Andrew Hunter, Bothwell's former chaplain. Logie had information on Bothwell's movements and offered to broker peace with the Catholic earls Huntly and Errol, by 'delivering them from Spanish hopes' so that Elizabeth could intercede for them with James VI.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 11 (London, 1936), no. 568. Logie's own letter of 3 October 1595 to an unknown recipient in the circle of Sir Robert Cecil describes his journey from England and a meeting with an Italian at Kiel in Holstein. He had news that the Scottish diplomat Colonel Stewart was in Mecklenburg, and Christian IV of Denmark had been to Braunschweig to meet his future wife, Anne Catherine of Brandenburg.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 12 (Edinburgh, 1952), pp. 29-30. Logie plotted to blow up the Gunpowder Tower at the harbour of Veere and was caught and executed. The tower collapsed into the sea 35 years later. Logie was incriminated by a letter he had written to Sir Robert Cecil, when the English bearer passed it to the Jesuit Father Holt and Sir William Stanley who gave it to the Governor of the Habsburg Netherlands, the Count de Fuentes. In December 1595 was imprisoned in Brussels for nine months. He was thought to have some information about Spanish affairs, matters within the \\"King's bounds\\". A letter of credit for Logie sent by Robert Bowes may have secured his release, or the intercession of John Lesley.Calendar State Papers Scotland vol. 13 part 1 (Edinburgh, 1969), pp. 43-4. Eufame Wemyss, Logie's sister, was banished from Anna's household on 21 November 1595.Register of the Privy Council, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1882), p. 240. Sir Robert Sydney spoke to Logie in October 1596 at Middelburg, and mentioned him in letters to Cecil and Earl of Essex, as \\"a man of good wit; but men of his profession will ever praise their own commodities\\".Calendar of the Cecil Papers in Hatfield House, 1596, vol. 6 (London, 1895), 16 Oct. 1596. On 30 November Logie wrote from Veere in Zeeland to the Earl of Essex mentioning that he had been quietly in Germany, and then travelled to Brabant hoping to do Queen Elizabeth good service, and would like to meet the earl.Calendar of the Cecil Papers in Hatfield House, 1596, vol. 6 (London, 1895), 30 Nov. 1596. On the same day he was arrested at Veere. Logie, who was then said to be 27 years old, was questioned about his movements, his connections to Jesuits, and to the Earl of Essex. Logie answered that he had been travelling to see his wife in Holstein but had missed seeing her.Calendar of the Cecil Papers in Hatfield House, 1596, vol. 6 (London, 1895), 1 & 9 & 10 Dec. 1596; R. B. Wernham, List and Analysis of State Papers: January to December 1596 (London, 2000), 92, 117. He was accused of planning to capture for Spain the Gunpowder tower, the \\"Kruittoren\\", that overlooked the harbour at Veere. He confessed immediately when he was shown the rack, and blamed a Scottish Jesuit Dr Hamilton and two Spanish men who had approached him while he was in prison in Brussels.Thomas Birch, Memoirs of the Reign of Queen Elizabeth, vol. 2 ( London, 1754), pp. 216-7; Emmanuel van Meteren (trans. J. D. L. Haye), Belgica, l'histoire des Pays-Bas d'Emanuel de Meteren (Amsterdam, 1670), f. 397v., \\"James Wimes fils de Baron Loggey.\\" Robert Sydney requested a stay of execution on 5 December. John Wemyss of Logie was beheaded at Middelburg on 8 January 1597 (NS).Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 12 (Edinburgh, 1952), pp. 29-30, 153, 219, 419: Thomas Birch, Memoirs of the reign of Queen Elizabeth vol. 2 (London, 1754), pp. 216-7. Another Scot, named Nicholson, was approached by Juan de Mancicidor secretary to Albert of Austria to help the Spanish take Veere.Calendar State Papers Scotland vol. 13 part 1 (Edinburgh, 1969), p. 45. Robert Sydney and Mr Andrew Hunter, the Scottish preacher and informer, sent copies of Logie's confession to Cecil. Hunter had recommended Logie to Henry Lock, who noted that the laird was cunning and had received a letter from the Earl of Essex.R. B. Wernham, List and Analysis (London, 2000), 41, 117, 414. Elizabeth saw in Logie's confession a declaration of James VI's favour to the Catholic party, and in 1599 James VI was required to repudiate the detail of Logie's confession and what he called Andrew Hunter's slander, for Robert Bowes and Elizabeth, which he did on the grounds that Logie died banished and was not of his counsel.Calendar of State Papers, Scotland, vol. 13 part 1 (Edinburgh, 1969), pp. 458, 489-90.

She is known in particular for her work on Greek tragedy, especially Aeschylus. Bacon is also well known for her work on classical themes in the poetry of Robert Frost and in the mythological writing of Edith Hamilton. Bacon was president of the American Philological Association in 1985.  Career  Bacon spent her childhood first in Berkeley and then in Florence where her father, the poet Leonard Bacon, and her mother, the painter Martha Stringham Bacon, had settled amongst a group of fellow artists. The family returned to the US in 1932 and Bacon went on to read classics at Bryn Mawr College, gaining her BA in 1940. In 1942 Bacon paused her graduate studies at the University of California, Berkeley (1940‚Äì1941) and Harvard University (1942) to join the United States Naval Reserve as a Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service (WAVES). She worked in the Navy's Communications Annex in Washington, D.C. where she was a cryptanalysist decoding Japanese radio communications. Bacon was one of a number of classicists employed by the Navy in this field of work, including her Bryn Mawr College professor, Richmond Lattimore. Bacon was known as \\"Bake\\" by her colleagues. Following World War II, Bacon returned to graduate studies at Bryn Mawr College and completed her PhD in 1955 with a dissertation entitled \\"Barbarians in Greek Tragedy\\", which was published by Yale University Press in 1961. Bacon taught at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, then the Woman's College of the University of North Carolina. Bacon also held a Fulbright Fellowship for a year to study at the American School of Classical Studies at Athens (1952‚Äì1953). Bacon then taught at Smith College from 1953 to 1961. While still untenured in 1960, Bacon organised support amongst Smith College faculty and wider academic community for two junior colleagues who had been reported and arrested for possessing homosexual pornography. Although the two were subsequently exonerated, Smith College fired them. Bacon succeeded in getting the college to pay her colleagues back pay but not the reinstatement of their jobs. Bacon gained tenure after this episode but decided to leave Smith College shortly afterwards. The events of the time were recounted in Barry Werth's The Scarlet Professor Newton Arvin: A Literary Life Shattered by Scandal (2001). The American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts awarded Bacon the David Burres Award in a ceremony at the Smith College Archives on April 29, 2002, stating that Bacon was amongst those: > heroes who speak out for civil liberties when it counts most‚Äîat the moment > when individual rights are violated. Bacon spent the rest of her career at Barnard College, where she taught classics from 1961 to her retirement in 1989. She had permanent impact on the department when as chair Bacon made modern Greek a permanent part of the curriculum and started the tradition of the annual Barnard College Greek or Latin play. During this time, Bacon was a director of the American Philological Association (1976‚Äì79) and became president in 1985, the third woman elected as president. Bacon taught graduate courses regularly at Columbia University and was a visiting professor at Harvard University and Hampshire College. During her summer vacations, Bacon taught classics in translation at the Bread Loaf School of English at Middlebury College, and she was awarded an honorary doctorate there in 1970. With Pulitzer Prize poet Anthony Hecht, Bacon translated Aeschylus' Seven Against Thebes, which was nominated for a National Book Award in 1973. During her retirement, Bacon was a trustee of Meekins Library in Williamsburg from 1996 to 2001.  Work  In her presidential address to the American Philological Association in 1985, Bacon talked about her \\"lifelong preoccupation with the importance of the esthetic and literary features of Plato's work\\". The content summary note for the Helen H. Bacon Papers, held at the library of Barnard College, describes her work as focusing on Aeschylus, Plato, Vergil, and Apuleius and the comic novel on the classical side, but including work on Robert Frost and Edith Hamilton which is more properly categorized as classical reception studies. An obituary in scholarly journal The Classical World, written by Nancy Felson, Deborah Roberts, and Laura Slatkin described her as \\"well ahead of her time\\", a \\"pioneer\\", and \\"anticipat[ing] subsequent directions in the field\\", on account of Bacon's engagement with literary theory and psychoanalytic theory.

The exclusive economic zone (EEZ) was declared in 1977 after North Korea had contested the validity of the Northern Limit Lines (NLL) set up after the Korean War as maritime borders. The EEZ has not been codified in law and North Korea has never specified its coordinates, making it difficult to determine its specific scope. In the Yellow Sea, the EEZ remains unspecified in the Korean Bay because China has not determined its own EEZ in the area. The border between the North Korean and South Korean EEZs in the Yellow Sea cannot be determined because of potential overlap and disputes over certain islands. In the Sea of Japan, the North Korean EEZ can be approximated to be trapezoidal-shaped. The border between North Korea and Russia's respective EEZs is the only such border that has been determined in Northeast Asia. Here, the EEZ does not cause many problems, even with regards to South Korea, because the sea is not thought to be rich in resources. History The Northern Limit Line (NLL) in the Yellow Sea The Korean Armistice Agreement specified a Military Demarcation Line as a land border between North and South Korea, but failed to determine a maritime border. The United Nations Command of the Military Armistice Commission (UNCMAC), however, unilaterally set two maritime borders, one at the Yellow Sea and one at the Sea of Japan, known as Northern Limit Lines (NLL). Ever since the legal status of the NLLs has been contested and clashes have taken place. In 1973, North Korea explicitly challenged the validity of the Yellow Sea NLL. UNCMAC had accused North Korea of intruding to the south of the NLL, to which North Korea responded by claiming that its maritime boundary lies south of the NLL. On 18 January 1952, Soth Korean President Syngman Rhee declared a \\"Peace Line\\" establishing a wide area of maritime sovereignty around the entire Korean Peninsula, including North Korea, on the basis his was the legal government for all of Korea. It claimed an area averaging 60 nautical miles from the Korean coast. This claim, generally called the Syngman Rhee Line, was not internationally accepted. On 21 June 1977, North Korea declared an economic zone of 200 nautical miles. The zone become effective on 1 August. That day, North Korea also declared 50-nautical mile Military Boundary Zones in both the Yellow Sea and the Sea of Japan. The North Korean exclusive economic zone (EEZ) had been born. South Korea objected to North Korea's EEZ plans, and has given a statement: \\"The [South] Korean government makes it clear that it is not recognizing North Korea's Military Boundary Zones and 200-nautical mile EEZs because they may bring about change in the status quo of the Korean Peninsula since armistice in 1953\\". Japan protested the move as well, but China did not. Extent North Korea has not passed a law on its EEZ. For this reason, it is not possible to define its outer limits. The country has, however, stated that the EEZ between neighboring countries or countries that are opposite one another \\"should be determined by consultation in accordance with the principle of an equidistant line or a median line\\". North Korea has never specified the geographical coordinates of its EEZ claims. =Yellow Sea= The border between the North Korean and Chinese EEZs is not clear. It can be inferred from North Korean statements that the limit of its EEZ in the Yellow Sea coincides with the limit of its Military Boundary Zone. Because the Yellow Sea is fairly narrow, the combined 400-nautical mile EEZs of North Korea and China will overlap. The China‚ÄìNorth Korea border on land has not been formally defined, but from treaties and statements it can be inferred to be the Yalu (Amnok) river. North Korea disputes with China a number of small islands at the mouth of the Yalu. The ownership of these islands affects the possible course that the maritime border between the two countries, and thus the border of their respective EEZs, will take. North Korea has specified its EEZ using the equidistant line method, while China, in general, prefers the natural prolongation of land territory method. In the Korean Bay in the Yellow Sea, however, China also prefers the equidistant line method, because that would give it the maximum share of the waters. Chinese academician Ji Guoxing has argued that the EEZs should take into account the specific conditions of the Korean Bay, such as China's longer coastline and historical fishing activities, and be based on the principles of equity and proportionality. On the other hand, because China has not determined its EEZ in the Yellow Sea, North Korea has probably adopted a similarly vague position so as to be flexible toward China. Some kind of agreement about the maritime border reportedly exists between North Korea and China, but it is unclear if this pertains to the EEZ or the continental shelf boundary. Which of the islands in the Yellow Sea belong to North and which to South Korea will also affect the boundaries of the EEZs of the three countries there. Even if the issue with the islands were to be resolved, the North and South Korean EEZs would overlap, necessitating either one party to reduce its claim or the two to share some of the EEZ. According to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the EEZs in both the Yellow Sea and the Sea of Japan should be divided so as to leave no international waters between them, because the sea areas are less than 400 nautical miles in breadth. The Yellow Sea NLL would probably not legal as a permanent boundary of territorial waters because it violates the non-encroachment principle of the convention by cutting of North Korea from the open seas. This also has implications for the EEZ. North Korea has signed the convention but not ratified it. =Sea of Japan= The EEZ in the Sea of Japan is trapezoidal-shaped. The area is not a source of great confrontation between North and South Korea because South Korean vessels avoid it. It is also not thought to be rich in natural resources. The border between North Korea's EEZ with that of Russia is the only determined border of its EEZs, and indeed the only fully determined border of EEZs in all of Northeast Asia. It was determined in 1986. The problem with it is however that its terminus is not equidistant with South Korean or Japanese territory. North Korea is geographically disadvantaged when it comes to the determination of EEZs, especially in the Sea of Japan where it is sandwiched between Russia and South Korea. This fact might contribute to North Korea's reluctance to commit fully to the EEZ regime and negotiate EEZ boundaries with its neighbors. Economy North Korea conducts fishing in its EEZ, mainly for the industrial sector. Some fishing for the artisanal sector takes place, too. Subsistence fishing has declined considerably over the years. A 2000 agreement between non-governmental fishing organizations of North and South Korea allowed South Koreans to fish inside the North Korean EEZ in the Sea of Japan until 2005. About 400 South Korean fishing vessels conducted fishing in the area. Although China did not initially protest the establishment of the North Korean EEZ, it has subsequently accused it of hampering economic development on the mouth of the Yalu River, especially at Bohai Bay. North Korea sells fishing quotas to its EEZ to foreigners through agents China. North Korean fishermen who are deprived of quotas to the EEZ then resort to poaching in the waters of China and Russia.

Often referred to as a \\"flying car\\" the aircraft was developed by its inventor as a means to cope with heavy road traffic in Manila. Background The Milenya ultralight aircraft was developed by Kyxz Mendiola, a Filipino drone enthusiast. Mendiola, who taught himself engineering and aircraft design, cited his \\"extreme\\" feeling towards the concept of flying as his motive for pursuing the project and was motivated even more as he learns about efforts from different countries in developing similar endeavours. He also named the deteriorating traffic situation in Metro Manila as a motivator in developing the Milenya and envisioned people flying to their destination in minutes instead them spending two to three hours riding traditional road transport. Milenya's inventor has described his creation as a \\"flying sports car\\". Development Kyxz Mendiola began developing Milenya in the early 2010s, using his own money to fund his project in its early years of development. Friends and relatives later helped him in his project. Millions of pesos and at least six years has been spent for the development of the aircraft. Mendiola has named \\"disappointment, mocking and discouraging words\\" as a hindrance to the development of the Milenya. He intends the vehicle to be similar to a sports car; a \\"flying Lamborghini\\". Trial and error method is used with Mendiola experimenting with different parts. In at least one test, his vehicle caught fire. In September 2018, the aircraft had its first public maiden flight in Batangas. After a video featuring the aircraft went viral in social media, Australian firm Star8 has expressed interest in partnering with Mendiola to develop Milenya for mass production. Specifications The vehicle is a single-seater vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft. Milenya is reinforced by a metal frame covered with carbon fiber shell. As of September 2018, the aircraft can carry a payload of and can fly at . It has flown at a height of and has flown 10 to 15 minutes at a time. It is powered by six lithium-ion batteries, taking around two and a half hours to charge completely. The vehicle is controllable by its lone passenger through a portable radio frequency controller; the vehicle controls its altitude through a button while it can maneuver through a steering stick. Devising \\"multicopter\\" technology frequently used in drones, Milenya achieves flight through its 16 rotary motors which is designed in a way that the vehicle can still fly safely even if one or two motors are compromised.

The garden was designed by Paul Sorensen (possibly in collaboration with Henri van de Velde) and the design of the house is also attributed to Paul Sorensen; and built from 1915 to 1938 by Ted Cohen. It is also known as Everglades Gardens. The property is owned by the National Trust of Australia (NSW). It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 1 March 2002.  History  =Indigenous history= =Colonial history= Until 1813 the Blue Mountains proved a restriction to the expansion of settlement in Australia. In that year Blaxland, Wentworth and Lawson made the first successful crossing and opened the vast interior of the country to settlement. The construction of a road soon followed and in 1863 a railway was built as far as Penrith and extended as far as Mount Victoria by 1868. By the 1870s it has become fashionable for elite families to acquire mountain retreats with magnificent views where in summer the air was considerably cooler than Sydney. Villages such as Leura developed to serve these retreats which over time developed large European gardens. The Everglades had borne that name for at least a decade before 1933 (when Henry van de Velde acquired it) and had formed part of a more extensive estate in Leura for over half a century, ever since Captain Reynolds took out a series of conditional leases of Crown land in 1880 and 1881. Reynolds' acquisitions included portion 91, where Everglades is situated. The face of modern south-east Leura was shaped by the activities of Reynolds and his successors. Intensive subdivision of Reynolds' estate by Ernest Nardin, continued by his widow Ellen, created both residential and recrecational possibilities. More people bought and built in south-east Leura and the golf course which plays an important role in Everglades' story was created on Nardin land.Jack, I., in Higham et al, 2009, 5 This in turn was the context which tempted Georgina Stonier to move to the heartland of the present Everglades, which the percipient Nardins had retained for themselves. Mrs Stonier's shrewd appraisal of the landscape led her to build her large home in 1915-16 in that part of the estate where the van de Veldes erected their house 20 years later and enjoying similar spectacular views to the south. The Everglades was, moreover, given its name by Georgina Stonier and it was she who first manipulated its environment, cleared some of the bush, planted exotics and fruit trees, creating terraces and a driveway supported by low stone walls. Henry and Una van de Velde did not acquire an empty canvas in 1933. The decisions which created the present house and garden were in debt to Captain Reynolds, Ernest and Ellen Nardin and Georgina Stonier. Nor were these decisions of the 1930s made unaided by van de Velde and Paul Sorensen. The van de Velde connections within the Sydney suburb of Manly and at Leura and the significance of Una van de Velde and her Maitland sisters are important antidotes to the simplistic and rather triumphalist story which centres around the two major male figures.Jack, I., in Higham et al, 2009, 6 Henry van de Velde, born in Belgium in 1875, was a modest but wealthy man of astute business ability with boundless energy and wide interests. His main business activity was as owner of Australian felt and Textiles, manufacturers of among other things Feltex Floor covering. =Development of Everglades estate= As a regular visitor to the mountains he decided in 1932 to purchase Everglades which previously had been an orchard destroyed by a bushfire in 1910. Almost immediately he began discussions with Paul Sorensen regarding the garden he proposed to build. The work was eventually to be extended to include the design of the house as well as the garden. Van de Velde spent every weekend tirelessly working in the gardens, frequently extracting labor from his many guests. Sorensen estimated that Van de Velde spent thousands on the development of the Everglades and considered him to be the greatest patron of landscaping gardening that Australia ever had. Paul Sorensen (1890-1983) commenced landscape training in Copenhagen in 1902 with the final two years of his training under the direction of Lars Nielsen, a leading Danish Horticulturist responsible for the design of much of the open space system of Copenhagen. This period included maintenance work at Villa Hvdore, the summer place of Queen Alexandra of Denmark. In 1914 Sorensen decided to emigrate and left for Australia. He managed to gain a position as gardener at the Carrington Hotel, Katoomba and began remodeling the garden there before (by 1917) setting up his own nursery and garden design business in the Blue Mountains. In 1933 Sorensen met Henri van de Velde through a client R. J. Wilson of \\"Dean Park\\". Wilson encouraged van de Velde to buy the Everglades property and engage Sorensen for the design of the garden. At everglades he paid homage to the magnificent views of the Jamison Valley below and to the Blue Mountains beyond. The Terraces he constructed were accordingly aligned with the natural slope and to take advantage of the views in a way, which did not allow the scale of the scene to overwhelm the garden. He held that the form of the garden was more important than colour and considered that Australian gardens generally were only interested in colour with the result that the form was often neglected. Also unusual for the time was his retention of native species such as banksias and eucalyptus within the garden. As few nurserymen were at that time propagating native species, he tended to draw upon the palette of exotic species with which he had become familiar in Europe, many of them he supplied from his own nursery or imported from around the world for the particular project. Trees and shrubs were always seen by Sorensen as the most important elements of a garden and were always placed to create a feeling of mystery as to what was behind them, as well as giving the usual feeling of enclosure and shelter. The idea of development over time is a commonly recurring theme in many of his gardens and displayed a profound awareness of the ecological impossibility of fixing the character of a landscape permanently in every detail. The aim was to create a final landscape, which, although having different qualities of beauty at different times in its development period, would achieve a state of ecological balance in which its continuing maintenance would be relatively minimal. This planned continuity of change and development over many years was quite revolutionary when Sorensen began his work and even today is not always accepted. There is little visible evidence of the immense physical difficulties encountered in building the garden. Construction took place before the days of heavy earth moving equipment and consequently all earthworks and the movement of the heavy stone were carried out by manpower alone. Fortunately for Everglades, the Depression was at its height and manpower was readily available albeit unskilled. Sorensen saw the first task as deciding on the qualities of the site most desirable for retention. Existing trees were marked to be kept, only mishapen or damaged ones were to be removed. Sorensen must have been keenly aware of the opportunities to exploit the dramatic outlook over the Jamison Valley from the lower part of the site. The view of distant cliffs and valley floor carpeted with dense eucalpyt forest, all softened by the gentle atmospheric blueness so characteristic of the mountains, was one to stir the imagination of all but the most unromantic. Sorensen decision not to use this view as part of the formal garden but to limit intensive development to the area previously disturbed for the orchard was made very early in the design stage. The fact that this view could not be obtained from any of the formal terraces must have seem strange to many people, but this decision was in line with Sorensen's belief that it was wrong to be able to perceive the total of his design from any point and that element of surprise that would come from arrival at his lookout points would add an incredible quality of delight to the garden. He also realised that the grandeur of the scene was such that it would be out of scale with anything he could construct and that it was possible that any attempt to make this view a dominant feature in the formal part of the garden would detract from both the view and the garden. Apart from the problems of the slope, the other major difficulty encountered was the thinness and rocky nature of the soil. The very factors that made the Blue Mountains such a desirable destination for the holiday maker- the spectacular cliffs and the rugged grandeur of the scenery- created immense problems for the garden builder. The whole area was formed from sandstone, which belongs to the Narabeen group of Triassic sandstones. Much of the stones character comes from its richness in iron oxide which gives it its rich, dark red or purple coloured narrow bands and layers which, over eons have been warped by geological movement. The iron oxide makes the layers containing it much harder than the surrounding stone so that with erosion of the softer stone the so- called ironstone is exposed on cliff faces in quite incredible forms ranging from flat stones through curves to tubes. The soils formed from this parent material are very sandy, lacking in nutrients and full of the harder ironstone fragments. Sorensen turned this physical character of the soil into an advantage by hand-digging the whole of the cultivated area to the depth of and removing all ironstone found in the process, stockpiling it according to quality and colour and eventually for packing and filling. The walls formed from this stone exhibit an extremely high quality of workmanship. In many places Sorensen left pockets in the walls where he could plant small growing shrubs to soften the walls. The walls formed terraces filled level with soil, stepping down the slope to the lookout point, with the garden continuing down to the Grotto pool, created by the placing of a 40-ton rock in its present position. Sorensen was retained to carry out maintenance work on the gardens even when development work was not in hand. Work on the garden continued with an interruption due to the War until 1947 when Van de Velde died. Following Van de Velde's death the property was purchased firstly by Mr E. E. Bristow who sold to Mr Harry Pike, a grazier who in turn sold to Swain & Co. Pty Ltd, whose then principal Mr A. N. Swain was a garden lover. After acquiring Swain & Co, Angus and Robertson, Booksellers and publishers attempted to dispose of the property, advertising in Britain and Europe, in an attempt to attract a purchaser with sufficient means to maintain the garden. That attempt failed and it was aging offered for auction in Australia, but was again passed in. The National Trust purchased the property in 1962. During this period of private ownership there was a gradual deterioration of the garden resulting from the lack of an enthusiastic owner/occupier and the loss of Paul Sorensen's services.Ratcliffe, 1994:4 During its era of private ownership there was a gradual deterioration of the garden from the lack of an enthusiastic owner/occupier and the loss of Sorensen's services. Everglades was one of the Trust's earliest acquired properties and the first with a garden. Members were invited to visit from 1962. From 1962-70 the Trust managed it directly, a period marked by unsuccessful attempts to exploit the place and uneven decline. In 1963 the Trust requested the NSW Government resume undeveloped lots to the south of Everglades. Approval was given in 1964. The Trust was appointed trustee in 1964. =Management under the National Trust of Australia= Until 1981 the Trust endeavoured by various attempts to make the property a financial asset. The squash court became part of the renamed Studio Terrace and exhibitions were held there as well as in the house. Sorensen was re-employed in 1974-5 for creation of the new azalea garden, but the property went into increasing debt. Attempts to find suitable tenants were unsuccessful, as were attempts to have the Government take it over. From 1981-87 Blue Mountains City Council leased the property, re- employing Sorensen to replant and thin out other areas. Council established a creative arts centre here in 1982 and visitation increased.Higham et al, 2009 In 1983 after almost 50 years in the garden, a bronze statue \\"Boy with a thorn in his foot\\" was stolen. At the same time, another Everglades sculpture of Pan went missing and the Trust has as yet been unable to locate it or find a replacement.Russell, 2013, 6 Between 1987-98 it was leased to Albech a development company. Mawland Holdings took over Albech's interest, increased maintenance of the garden and proposed development of a 20-room guesthouse on lot 8. This failed to occur and in 1998 the property returned to direct control of the National Trust. In 2007 a comprehensive tree survey was undertaken. In 2008 access and safety issues were reassessed and above-ground water tanks were installed. On 28 July 2012, a function was held to celebrate the (re-)installation of an authenticated copy of a bronze stateue called \\"Boy with a thorn in his foot\\". This restored the bronze to its place under the Japanese maple (Acer palmatum) in the courtyard where it had been since the 1930s. In 2011 the National Trust started a campaign to raise funds so a new \\"Boy\\" could be cast to replace the artwork. Then news came that an exact replica was about to be auctioned in Melbourne. Fortuitously the sum of donations enabled the Trust to bid on it and gain it. The \\"Boy\\" or \\"Il Spinario\\" is a bronze cast from a 1st-century BC statue now in the Palazzo dei Conservatori in Rome. The original was given to the city of Rome by Pope Sixtus IV in the 12th century and stood for centuries outside the Lateran Palace. It was taken in the Napoleonic Wars, and triumphantly paraded into Paris. In 1816 it was repatriated to Rome. In the late 19th century, a number of foundries in Naples were licensed to produce casts of ancient statues. One of these was the Fonderia G. Sommer, Napoli, the maker of our new \\" Boy\\". It's possible that the stolen boy may have come from the same foundry. Extensive upgrades to facilities and grounds in recent years have enabled this property to be a major focus for tourists and the local community. A continuous programme of exhibitions at the gallery and events ranging from cutting-edge theatre (an annual Shakespeare Festival) to major family events, to home- cooked meals and invitations to picnic and wander in the grounds continue to attract over 30,000 visitors a year to Everglades. It is a highlight of the annual Leura Garden Festival each spring.Silink & Hayes, 2014. Theatre performances have again been held in the garden theatre for some years. The annual January Leura Shakespeare Festival 2015 sold out for all evening performances at Everglades. The Leura Garden Festival was the biggest revenue- raiser, bringing around 5000 visitors over a nine-day period. A continuous program of art exhibitions runs from September to May each year and grows in popularity. Art sales are increasing and the gallery is booked out until 2018. The Norman Lindsay Gallery, Everglades and Woodford Academy were all represented in the Blue Mountains Winter Magic street festival which attracted over 30,000 people.NTA, 2015, 4.  Description  Everglades garden, pictured in 2012. =Garden= Everglades is separated from Everglades Avenue (formerly Denison Street) by a low stone wall, the house not being visible from the street. The driveway entrance is located at the highest point of the site and was at first something of a problem, owing to the steep fall of the land. Sorensen overcame the difficulty by routing it along the upper level of the land for much of the width of the site before leading it in a series of sweeping curves down through the garden, passing firstly through areas of open lawn and flower beds and then past enormous banks of rhododendrons before sweeping around the rear of the house to end at the garages which are situated beneath it. To the left of the upper drive huge rocks rise from the soil to form the structure of an alpine garden whilst to the right, beyond the formal lawn and annual beds, stone walls drop the levels down the slope in a series of unseen terraces only hinted at by the tops of mature trees appearing over the walls. Everglades contains many species of trees rare to the Blue Mountains at the time for, in his search of perfection; Sorensen was to seek plants from a large number of nurseries. Many of the plants were imported specifically for Everglades, some trees as far afield as Holland but many more from Duncan and Davies nursery in New Zealand. Other plants came from Victoria, in particular from Nobelius Nursery and Remington's Nursery. Each of the terraces has its own character and qualities. Outstanding among them is the studio terrace. From the studio end of the terrace the vista is over the swimming pool to the far end of the terrace where the distant view of the mountains is framed by a brick pergola of slender and delicate portions which is made more delightful in spring when its covering wisteria vine blooms in profusion. From the studio viewpoint the garden theatre cannot be seen and it is not until the southern end of the terrace is approached that its presence is revealed. The backdrop to this theatre is framed by the reconstructed red sandstone entrance porch from the London Chartered Bank of Australia building, designed and built by Architect J.F.Hilley in George Street Sydney in 1866 and demolished in 1938 to make way for Feltex House, the new headquarters of Henri's business activities. Carefully taken down, transported to Leura and re-erected as the backdrop to the garden theatre, the archway of the entrance porch was flanked with tall Bhutan cypress (Cupressus torulosa) hedges, clipped formally to form the wings of the storage area. Another major terrace approximates the ground floor level of the house. A grass and stone paved courtyard formed by the angle of the house and matching stuccoed walls is linked to this terrace via an arched opening which gives focus to a large stone urn at the far or northern end of the terrace. Other openings are in this enclosing wall is filled with free form art deco wrought iron grilles also designed by Sorensen. The court was designed as the home for several pieces of classical sculpture, collected by Van de Velde on his travels around the world to add unexpected interest to the garden. Unfortunately these have been stolen or broken in recent years. On leaving the court via the archway, a stone flagged area is crossed leading to a broad flight of shallow steps descending to the level of the terrace proper, which comprises a large smooth lawn lined with weeping Japanese flowering cherry trees. Originally the canopy of the cherries was supported on a pergola which continued at least until the 1960s. These trees have been replaced. A further terrace is reached at the level of the lower drive before the formal terraces and exotic plantings merge with the natural bushland. Pathways become more informal as they lead down to the lookout, which gives extensive views over the valley of the Gordon Falls and out in the Jamison Valley. From this point one path leads down past a fern-covered cliff face rich in ironstone to end at the Grotto Pool, which fits so perfectly into its setting that is difficult to believe that it is not a natural feature retained in the garden by Sorensen. The pool is fed by a waterfall, which tumbles over the cliff, its watercourse having traversed the full southern side of the property. The other path from the lookout leads through bushland to a simple timber bridge, which spans the watercourse immediately above the falls and provides another view of the Grotto pool. As the path is followed from the bridge the character of the garden changes once more to the gentle slopes, well grassed and dominated by stands of deciduous trees such as maples, poplars and birch before the patterns back to itself to climb a hill through drifts of rhododendron and azaleas back to the driveway.Ratcliffe, R., 1994. =House= An image of the interior, pictured in 2016. The house is of masonry construction, built on three floors incorporating a basement, ground and first floors. It sits on a site sloping quite steeply to the southwest, allowing only half the general floor area in the basement, while part of the first floor is attic space. The roof is terra cotta tile and the walls are cavity brick finished in a Mediterranean style stucco; windows are steel framed except for those enclosing Bedroom G.3 The exterior of the house has been painted and rainwater gutters and downpipes replaced. Walls have been painted in a colour similar to biscuit, rainwater goods similar to Venetian red, and windows have been painted black. The roof tiles are muntz, but are heavily covered with lichen. Floors are a combination of concrete and timber originally covered with either pale green (ground floor) or mauve (first floor) carpet. Internal walls are plastered, with a flat finish in utilitarian rooms and a textured finish in the others. Ceilings are plastered or rendered and exhibit a hierarchy of embellishment of the plaster cornices, from nothing or a small cove in halls and bathrooms to elaborate Art Deco treatment in the living and bedrooms. Most rooms retain the carpet, which is in relatively good condition. Where this has been removed the boards have been painted with a gloss finish jade green paint. The bathrooms are highly intact and are a particular feature of the house with their generous layout and unusual decor. Other significant details of the exterior and interiors of the building have been noted in tables Appendix 2-Exterior Fabric Survey and Appendix 3 Interior Fabric Survey. (.Murphy, 1998) =Studio= Located near the front gate, in an elevated position hard against the northern boundary and opening onto the swimming pool terrace this building is clearly linked to the European Modern Movement with echoes of the Bauhaus and Le Corbusier. Casneaux photographs indicate that it was furnished with fine imported furniture. External character: A fine example of the 30s modern style, with endered waves banding the building and roof lights illuminating the squash court. The space occupied by the squash court originally was windowless, presenting a plain uninterrupted face to the garden. The windows later cut through the walls is unsympathetic to the building and its era, in particular the upper window, which breaks the ornate, wave banding. The inlaid timber floor survives intact. Originally the building was elegant, simple and functional with the squash court on the ground floor, overlooked by an upper level gymnasium. A small washroom facility served squash court, gym and swimming pool. =Structure= Presumed to be reinforced concrete, rendered brick work, timber frame. A reinforced concrete cantilever supports the Gym and provides a structural feature of period interest. =Log cabin= The log cabin, pictured in 2016. This is a typical rustic structure common in large gardens throughout history. It is constructed with a standard timber frame overlaid with elaborately hewn planks. It consists of two rooms with a central chimney structure housing fireplace and stove. Its condition is sound. A plan of this building taken from the previous conservation plan by Knox and Tanner is at figure 4. Brick Shelter: This small building, constructed of brick with a clay shingle roof appears in very early photographs of the garden. Its exact purpose has not been determined but it is a finely detailed structure, which adds to the character of the garden. Its condition is sound and it is presently being used as an information centre for the garden. National Trust Magazine NSW November 2008-January 2009: completion of much needed work at Everglades funded by a $100,000 grant reinstatement of the traditional internal paint scheme, upgrading of pathways and the production of new interpretative material. = Condition = As at 23 December 2008, the physical condition is good. While the garden was neglected approximately 1947 (Van der Velde's death) until 1962 when bought by the National Trust, and subject to varying degrees of maintenance during that period and since, it retains its overall layout, major design features such as driveways, paths, terrace walls and steps, major built structures, and major plantings. Funding and standards of maintenance have never equalled those pre-1947, however the National Trust has reversed this trend in recent years, implementing a program of staged garden and structural repair works, to conserve, repair and reinstate important features. Due to the dynamic nature of gardens, and changing levels of shade and moisture under maturing tree cover, ground level plantings have changed since the initial design. Further tree and shrub pruning work is required in terms of removing risks to visitors and structures, removing dead wood, and reinstating views of significance. A lack of funds has to date not enabled the Trust to repair the pump on the grotto pool, although this is proposed. Further research work is required to clarify the roles and contribution made to the place by Henri van der Velde and Paul Sorenson, to identify the changes made to the garden post 1947 (cf those made pre-1947), and clarify the relative significance of each, in order to prioritise conservation and other works required to the garden. This work is currently underway. = Modifications and dates = Everglades was acquired by the National Trust in 1962 and immediately began a two-year restoration program under the supervision of Paul Sorensen. *Studio Terrace and Vista - Note conifer hedge between terrace and house (now overgrown) *The Garden Theatre 1989 - Note conifer \\" wings\\" becoming overgrown *1994 - Everglades House additions and cracking *1994 - Path problems *1994 - Unsympathetic Concrete paving to house entryEnvironment Design Associates 1994 *2008 - reinstated traditional internal paint scheme; upgraded paths.

Heritage listing  As at 3 March 2010, Everglades is significant as a largely intact modernist garden, as an important development in garden design in Australia and as reputedly the most important garden of Paul Sorensen, a notable garden designer, in collaboration with Henri van de Velde the owner. It has significance due to its unusually rich collection of exotic flora. It also has associations with Henri van de Velde, an important businessman of the immediate pre-World War II years. It has significance as an example of a mountain retreat illustrating the way of life of its period. It has significance due to the aesthetic regard held for the garden in the local community. It has significance through the technical excellence of its construction, particularly the stonewalling, and through its design quality. The house has significance as one of only a few buildings attributed to Paul Sorensen. It also has significance for the technical and design quality of its interiors. The studio has significance as an important element in the garden and as an early Australian example of the influence of the European Modern Architecture Movement.Ratcliffe, 1994: 20.HO 2002 Everglades was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 1 March 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Everglades is of historic value as an largely intact modernist garden, reputedly an example of the earlier work of Paul Sorensen, one of the most accomplished landscape/garden designers in Australia in the period 1920-1970, in collaboration with Henri ven de Velde the owner. It also has associations with Henri van de Velde, an important businessman of the immediate pre-war years. It has significance as an example of a mountain retreat illustrating the way of life of its period.National Trust 1993 The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Everglades has associations with Henri van der Velde, an important businessman of the immediate pre-war years, and Paul Sorenson, notable garden designer and contractor active mainly in NSW. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The setting is mainly natural with surrounding exotic trees evident to the north of the garden. The design qualities of Everglades are of a very high order: the garden is structured to provide a diverse range of spaces, each with a different character, with the unifying theme of the ironstone walls. Near the house the spaces are structured into a series of formal terraces with statuary and other ornaments, while areas of the garden that adjoin the bushland have a more natural feel. The unusual richness and design excellence of its landscape features such as the use of local ironstone for retaining walls, the incorporation of natural rock formations and indigenous trees, the carefully arranged planting schemes, the use of ornaments such as vases, urns, statues and fountains, and the skilful borrowing of natural scenery all give it major aesthetic significance. So too does the architectural design and interation of the residence, studio, garden theatre, water features and decorative iron grilles. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Everglades has social value for its possible role in initiating what has become the Leura Gardens Festival, and in influencing the development of high- quality cool-climate gardens in the upper Blue Mountains. It also has social value for its status as a much opened and visited private garden, known to the public and visited since publicity and occasional open days in the 1930s, and particularly since the 1960s when the National Trust took over the property and opened it to the public full-time. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Everglades presents the potential to yield information about the transmission, implementation and dispersal of ideas of the modern movement in relation to both house and garden design, as practised in Europe in the early twentieth century, into Australia. It also presents the potential to yield information on the range of skills and relative contribution of Henri van der Velde, Paul Sorensen and others to a complex, layered place, designed and constructed to high standards of quality, and subject to varying degrees of maintenance and neglect over time. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The house has significance as one of only few buildings attributed to have been designed by Paul Sorensen. It has significance also for the technical design quality of its interiors. The garden has significance as a rare, large, elaborate and relatively intact modernist garden design in NSW, reflecting European tastes and developments of the period. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Everglades is representative of a mountain retreat of high design quality illustrating the way of life of its period. It is also representative of a large and elaborate modernist garden design, with building structures of a functionalist style.

Biography  Smirnov was the only child in the family. His father died early, and his mother indulged in every possible way Vasily and said that he was the best, yet did not allow him to communicate with peers, go to dances or meet with girls. At the age of 18, he hit his mother on the head with a hammer and tried to rape her, but she did not let him. After serving in the army, he raped an elderly woman. For this, Smirnov was sent to prison, here he was raped by another inmate. While serving his sentence, his mother passed away. On 3 September 1979, on the bank of the Izhora River, the body of 8-year-old Marina Koshkina was found. She had been brutally murdered, and raped before her death. A nail was found hammered in her head. Smirnov had attacked and raped the victim, after which he demanded that she not tell her mother. The girl refused, and he then proceeded to slaughter her. The investigation into this case was very active, but they couldn't catch the killer. Soon the corpse of a small boy named Andrei Lopatin was found at the Silver Lake. He had been raped and then stabbed. Smirnov wanted to cut off a piece from the boy's body and use it for food, but a passing bicyclist frightened him off. Horrifying rumors of a vampire who has been drinking blood from children quickly arose in Gatchina. Smirnov did not always kill his victims, but the raped women did not report anything to the police because of shame. The next victim was an elderly woman, who was considered rich in the city. He tore off her head, then robbed and set her house on fire. After this, Smirnov went to Petergof, where he raped a pregnant girl who did not report it to the police. The fourth victim was Tatyana Emshova, a mother of two children and teacher, who had come to Gatchina for a seminar. The maniac raped and then killed her. On the same day, a search was announced for the maniac, and Smirnov went into hiding. At that moment, a woman who was raped by Smirnov contacted the police. The crime had occurred on the same day when Smirnov killed Emshova. He was exposed on an old conviction. The investigators came to Smirnov's house, but found only a burnt house. And soon, the killer attacked a group of children in the middle of the day, raping one girl. He was arrested soon afterwards. While under arrest, Smirnov happy talked about his crimes, confessing about a fifth murder of an elderly woman, whom he had raped. He had left her purse on the road, and moved her corpse by car, the victim's death being initially written off as a traffic collision. Smirnov always left a sign on the bodies of the murdered - he drove nails into their heads. Smirnov did not get scared after the announcement of the death sentence, saying he is above the law. In 1980, he was executed by firing squad. There were conspiracy theories that Smirnov was not shot, but left alive so his psychopathic nature could be studied.

Lee previously held executive positions at Apple, then SGI, Microsoft, and Google before creating his own company, Sinovation Ventures.  AI arms race  According to Kai-Fu Lee, \\"If data is the new oil, then China is the new Saudi Arabia.\\" Lee advances several arguments for why he thinks the artificial intelligence industry in China will excel in the artificial intelligence arms race: # Training deep learning models requires more of a brute force method than innovation; well suited to China's supposedly higher quantity but lower quality of software engineer compared to the US # China has fewer data protection regulations (e.g., the General Data Protection Regulation in Europe) than other countries, so Chinese software collect more data on users. # Chinese tech startup culture is more \\"aggressive\\" than that of other countries', with fewer intellectual property restrictions and fewer barriers to vertical integration # The participation of China's central government in funding and raising the status of the AI industry AI threat to employment Lee proposes that knowledge workers are generally under greater threat of unemployment due to advances in AI, in a similar manner to the effect of the Industrial Revolution on physical laborers. The book includes examples of the most and least threatened jobs both in mental and physical labor. Least threatened cognitive labor jobs include criminal defense attorney, public relations director, concierge, social worker, psychiatrist, and CEO because those jobs are highly social and are based on creativity or strategy. Cognitive jobs with the greatest threat to being made redundant by AI include: basic translator, radiologist, consumer loan officer, consumer tax prep, telemarketer, and customer service rep because those jobs are asocial and optimization-based. Physical jobs at low risk of irrelevance in the AI era include elder caregiver, physical therapist, hairstylist, and dog trainer because those roles are social and require high dexterity in an unstructured environment. Physical jobs most likely to suffer job losses or extinction include assembly line inspector, fruit harvester, truck driver, dishwasher, clothing factory worker, fast food and restaurant cooks and cashiers because these are asocial jobs in structured environments and don't require dexterity.  Reception  US Senator Mark Warner named AI Superpowers as his recommended book for The 2018 POLITICO 50 Reading List. On the other hand, American magazine Foreign Affairs criticized the book for promoting zero-sum thinking and hyping Chinese state investment in tech ventures that often underperform relative to expectations; for focusing on deep learning to the exclusion of other forms of artificial intelligence; and for overgeneralizing the usefulness of Chinese data sets.

It was built from 1888 to 1920 by David Davis, Sydney builder. It is also known as Rennie House. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The first land grant in the area of Wentworth Falls was of to Edward Dougherty in 1857. The property on which Davisville was built was originally part of Dougherty's grant. In 1858 the land was bought by Archibald Campbell who owned it while the subdivision of Brasfort was formed. His daughters sold the Davisville subdivision to David Davis in 1888. Davis was an early purchaser of land along Falls Road (then Boonara Street). He appears to have built/ developed or owned a number of houses along Falls Road including no. 69, 74, 85 and 63.Integrated Design Associates, 2010 David Davis, a Sydney builder, erected his eponymous holiday home in 1888 just north of the laid-out village of Brasfort, later Wentworth Falls. Davis clearly used materials from older houses in the building of Davisville, which has confused interpretation of the interior. There seem to have been additions made to the footprint of the house after 1913, if a rough sketch of that date can be trusted. A photo of Davisville indicates the presence of the current footprint of the house including the verandah enclosures to the south, the Monterey pine (Pinus radiata) plantings along the northern boundary (large by this time), the tennis court on the north lawn and the Monterey pine tree adjacent to the tennis court. The Monterey pine on the southern side of the garden is not present in this photo. Davis finally sold the house in 1920 to the Young Women's Christian Association, which used it as a holiday home under the name Rennie House. Miss M. Stephens was resident at the house on behalf first of the YWCA and then their successors, the Christian Alliance of Women and Girls, from 1920 until after 1947. In 1974 the Anglican church was using Rennie House and considered building a retirement village on the site. This project was abandoned and Robert Bunda, the antique dealer of Springwood, (cf. SP 030) bought the property around 1975. Alterations were made to the house about 1976 and it was soon sold to Mr and Mrs Seymour who leased it to a young commune around 1979. It is currently being conserved by new owners in preparation for the opening of a bed-and-breakfast establishment. An interim conservation order was placed on Davisville in 1984 after community concern was raised over its fate and the adjacent \\"Mon Repos\\" in relation to a proposed development on the adjacent land. This resulted in subdivision of the rear of Davisville to its current layout which was established as the curtilage for the house at this time. A permanent conservation order was placed on the house in 1985. Mon Repos was not saved and has been replaced by a new house. Significant alterations to the house occurred in 1985 under the ownership of Mrs G. Rawles which included alterations to the verandah, the demolition of rear outbuildings, replacement of all corrugated roofs including the bull-nosed verandah, the rewiring of all electrics and removal of pull cords, conversion of the central room along the north verandah to a bathroom (removed by the current owners). The garage was an addition under the ownership of the Westgarths in 1985. In 1998 the house was altered internally with the placement of a number of ensuites and room divisions for conversion of the house into a bed and breakfast. In 2006, under standard exemptions from the Heritage Council, Davisville underwent alterations to remove some of the 1998 Ensuites and alterations, and repair the surrounding verandah, in order to allow for the continued usage of the house as a private.  Description  =Garden= Mature Monterey pines (Pinus radiata) along the northern Falls Road boundary of the property (approx. 80 years old, over high) are remnants of shelter belts around the property (mainly to the north, one tree to the south (since removed) and one beside the tennis court on the north lawn. The general layout of the 1920s garden remains discernable today. The tennis court netting is gone but the flat area north of the house remains, as do surrounding windbreak trees, mainly (as noted above) Monterey pines. Large shrubs in the garden are likely to remain from the 1920s including a large mature Rhododendron sp./cv. near the front verandah, camellias etc. Dry stone walls also contribute to the mature landscape setting. The garden itself contributes to the leafy setting of Falls Road as a precinct. The site contains a small gazebo to the west of the rear court, with a sandstone pond, both of these are said to be modern, c.1950 additions. There is also a garage added c.1985 in the northwest corner. The frontage trees (east) sitting to the north and south of the house enframe it in a mature landscape setting, along with the northern windbreak treesa long the boundary. The northern windbreak tree closest to the garage is leaning over that. Windbreak trees to the western boundary form a backdrop to the house. These consist of s Leyland false cypresses added during the 1980s subdivision of the rear of the property, to provide privacy. A double width driveway leads from Falls Road to the garage.Integrated Design Associates, 2010, slightly abridged by Stuart Read, 1/12/2010 =House= The original cottage (1888) was front four rooms only with an attached service wing to the rear with two fireplaces (only one survives). Now it is a three bay gabled cottage on north-south axis facing east to Falls Road, extended south -20 with a dining room (with decorative pressed metal walls and ceiling), to five bays. Corrugated galvanised steel roof with fretwork barge boards in clubs and diamonds pattern and finials and exposed collar tie to gables. 3 no. brick-corbelled chimneys.

The seventeenth named storm, tenth hurricane, and seventh major hurricane of the 2018 Pacific hurricane season, Rosa originated from an Atlantic tropical wave that crossed the West African coast on September6. The wave proceeded westward across the Atlantic, traversing Central America before entering the Gulf of Tehuantepec on September 22. There, the weather system acquired cyclonic features and became a tropical storm on September 25. Within a favorable atmosphere, Rosa entered a period of rapid intensification on September 27, peaking as a Category4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 150 mph (240 km/h) a day later. Over the next few days, Rosa turned north and then northeast while steadily weakening, making landfall in Baja California as a tropical depression on October 2. After crossing over into the Gulf of California, the remnant system split apart and merged with an upper-level low off the coast of California by October 3. Rosa prompted the issuance of tropical storm watches and warnings along the coast of Baja California, as well as various flood watches and warnings throughout the Southwestern United States. The impact of Rosa was relatively minor, as a combination of wind shear and cooler seas had weakened the storm significantly by the time it made landfall. Widespread flooding throughout northwestern Mexico, mainly in Sonora and Baja California, led to one drowning and minor damage. In Arizona, rainfall peaked at and caused flash floods that killed two people. Flood damage from Rosa and its remnants totaled $50 million (2018 USD) in the Southwestern United States and $530,000 in Baja California. Meteorological history Hurricane Rosa originated from a vigorous tropical wave that departed from the west coast of Africa on September 6. The wave traveled across the tropical Atlantic with minimal associated weather and became difficult to track after interacting with a mid-level trough in the Caribbean Sea. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) issued a Tropical Weather Outlook on September 19, anticipating that an area of low pressure would form in the Gulf of Tehuantepec over the weekend. The wave crossed Central America and entered the gulf on September 22, where it produced a surface circulation with convective activity aloft. Though broad in structure, the system consolidated as it proceeded slightly north of west. It was officially classified as Tropical Depression Twenty-E on September 25, at 06:00 UTC, located 350 mi (565 km) south-southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico. At the time of its formation, the depression was located within a favorable tropospheric environment of warm sea surface temperatures and minimal vertical wind shear, featuring a well- defined center of circulation under an expanding area of strong convection. The depression maintained a trend of steady strengthening over the 24 hours: it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Rosa six hours after being classified, and became the tenth hurricane of the season a day later, at 12:00 UTC on September 26. The NHC remarked that Rosa's structure was well developed at the middle levels of the troposphere, with distinct rainbands wrapped around the southern semicircle of the cyclone. The hurricane leveled in intensity for eighteen hours before proceeding into another phase of rapid intensification; it reached major hurricane status at 18:00 UTC on September 27, peaking in intensity with maximum sustained winds of 150 mph (240 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 936 mbar (27.64 inHg). This made Rosa the seventh Category4 hurricane of the year's season. After Rosa reached its peak, the hurricane's eyewall ‚Äì an inner ring of clouds around the eye ‚Äì began to warm considerably, signaling the start of an eyewall replacement cycle. Rosa turned to the northwest on the afternoon of September 28 in response to an approaching mid- to upper-level trough, which would continue to influence the remainder of the hurricane's development. Now tracking over cooler seas, Rosa steadily weakened down to Category 2 by 00:00 UTC, September 29, while undergoing its eyewall replacement. Once the replacement cycle was completed, the storm briefly restrengthened because of its much-improved structure, with expanding outflow to the northeast of the eye. However, Rosa began to experience impinging wind shear from the developing trough, causing a misalignment between the upper and lower levels of the hurricane, as well as coinciding with a final weakening phase. Rosa turned to the north on September 29, ahead of the trough. The unrelenting wind shear ‚Äì combined with progressively cooler seas and drier air ‚Äì quickly eroded Rosa's core, disrupting the eye and convection over the southern half of the hurricane. At 12:00 UTC on September 30, the diminishing hurricane dropped to Category1 while being steered towards the northeast between the trough and a subtropical ridge. Rosa lost its hurricane status twelve hours later, proceeding towards the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm. It further weakened to a tropical depression on October 2, after the convection became displaced from the elongating center. At 11:00 UTC on October 2, Rosa made landfall about 70 mi (115 km) southeast of Punta San Antonio in Baja California, becoming the first tropical cyclone to move over the state since Nora of 1997. During its approach towards the Gulf of California, Rosa exhibited an increasingly unwound and diffuse structure, prompting the NHC to declassify it as a tropical cyclone at 15:00 UTC. Shortly after, forecasters at the Weather Prediction Center (WPC) noted that the low- and mid-level circulations of Rosa's remnant had decoupled; the mid-level remnants proceeded into northeast Arizona, while the lower segment traced behind it over the Gulf of California. On October 3, in their final advisory on the system, the WPC reported that the remnants had been absorbed into a deepening non-tropical low off the coast of California. Preparations and impact =Mexico= alt=Satellite image of Category 2 Hurricane Rosa approaching Baja California Peninsula on September 29 The Government of Mexico issued a tropical storm watch on September 29 for the Pacific Coast of the Baja California Peninsula from Punta Abreojos to Cabo San Quint√≠n. The watches on the west coast of Baja California were changed to tropical storm warnings, and watches were issued for the east coast of Baja California from Bahia de los Angeles to San Felipe on the next day. All the watches and warnings were discontinued after Rosa weakened to a tropical depression. The State Unit of Civil Protection of Sonora issued a yellow alert (imminent severe weather) for 11 municipalities and a green alert (possible severe weather) for 19 municipalities on September 30. A red alert was issued for San Felipe on October1 as Rosa approached Baja California. On the same day, schools were closed in several communities throughout Baja California as well as in the neighboring state of Sonora. The Marine Plan, an evacuation and rescue plan, was activated in the states of Baja California, Baja California Sur, Sonora, and Sinaloa. Because of its significant weakening before landfall, Rosa had a relatively minor impact in Mexico. Rainfall was heaviest in Baja California, peaking at in Percebu and at in San Felipe. Floods in San Felipe collapsed part of a highway and opened up a sinkhole in the city's port. The port suffered MX$10 million (US$530,000) in losses following a five- day shutdown of its operations. In Los Cabos, Sonora, rainstorms triggered power outages and floods swept away vehicles. In Puerto Pe√±asco, dozens of homes and businesses suffered from flooding after an estimated of rain fell. Many of the town's roads were closed, and four bridges became impassable. A woman drowned in Caborca after being swept away by floodwaters. Farther south, in the state of Colima, floodwaters swept through the city of Manzanillo, causing sinkholes, rupturing underground pipes, and inundating buildings. Landslides in and around the city blocked roads and buried three vehicles in mud. Throughout the state of Michoac√°n, the combined effects from Rosa and nearby Tropical Storm Sergio destroyed of crops. After Rosa's passage, states of emergency were issued for the cities of Ensenada, Mexicali, and Puerto Pe√±asco. =United States= alt=Map of rainfall totals in Arizona for rain generated by Rosa's remnants from October 1‚Äì2 Exiting the Gulf of California, the remnants of Rosa tracked northward, spawning showers and thunderstorms in the Four Corners region. Damage from flooding in the Southwestern United States totaled about $50 million (USD). Flood watches and warnings were issued on September 30 for Southern California, Arizona, southwest Colorado, Utah, central Nevada, and a small portion of southeast Idaho. On October 1, an interaction between Rosa's remnants and a Pacific low produced severe thunderstorms in San Bernardino County. Surging floodwaters carried rocks onto portions of U.S. Route 95 and coated parts of state routes 62 and 127 in mud and debris. Effects from the severe weather extended into Nevada, where flash floods inundated buildings and deposited rubble along Pioche's Main Street. By the time of Rosa's absorption on October 3, a total of of rain was recorded at Towers Mountain, Arizona, located about 85 mi (135 km) north of Phoenix; other areas throughout the state reported up to of rain. The remnants of Rosa caused flash floods throughout the communities of Guadalupe, Glendale, Scottsdale, Fountain Hills, Deer Valley, and Sun City and knocked out power in Yuma. As rainfall exceeded , the National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning for the Phoenix area. Though over two dozen roads, as well as schools and businesses, had been closed, 80 car accidents occurred during the torrential rains. Outside the Phoenix area, weather-related traffic accidents resulted in the deaths of a 26-year-old woman just north of Cameron and a 34-year-old man in Kingman. At Menagers Dam near Sells, Arizona, rainfall from Rosa brought the water level within a foot (0.3 m) of maximum capacity on October 2, raising concerns about the dam's structural integrity. Saying dam failure was imminent, the National Weather Service in Tucson urged residents of Ali Chuk to evacuate immediately. Later that day, 162 people were evacuated from Ali Chuk, as well as 32 from Kohatk and 23 from the Menagers Dam community. Engineers were recruited to carry out assessments of the dam, and authorities continued to monitor the water level for two weeks before allowing residents to return to their homes on October 17.

Plot The married coup Jean and Danielle Duprey receive a letter from a prince, an old friend of Jean's. The letter is in the form of a riddle, which references Les Fleurs du mal by Charles Baudelaire, which the prince gave him years ago. The Duprey's decide to leave and go to the prince's castle where Rita Lernod, the prince's wife, tells them that her husband is very ill. The prince appears to be afflicted with a disease unfamiliar to his doctors. The prince says that the disease affects everyone in his family for three generations, over thirty- five years of age. The couple find a strange painting featuring someone dying at the stake which disturbs Danielle. Danielle begins to have nightmares about dying at the stake. The prince tells Jean that the truth behind everything is in the library and gives him a ring. At night, the prince dies and the next day a girl is found dead, with large scratches on her chest. The police identifies her as a cousin of the prince, who had been seen the night before in Strasbourg, hundreds of miles from there. The following night, Jean finds a book in the library about black magic, which references the amethyst, like the ring the prince had given him. The book states that it is the most effective remedy against witches. Another death occurs in similar fashion to the girl, with the police identifying her as the sister of the first victim. Jean finds a card in the library, which is a copy of a public act of a sorcery process of 1650, against a certain Tarin Drole. Jean discovers that this is an anagram for Rita Lernod. In the deed, it is written that the President of the Tribunal was an ancestor of the prince. Jean begins to explore the castle further while Rita takes Danielle with her, giving her something to drink, but after Danielle sees a flame in her glass and runs off looking for Jean. The ghost of the prince and Danielle appears and is brought over an altar to be sacrificed. Rita is about to slash her on the chest, when Jean throws a boulder on a part to stop it, which makes Rita grow old, revealing herself to be a witch and dies. Jean and Rita find themselves outside and hear the explosion of the castle. The two return home, when another letter arrives from another prince but this time Danielle burns it. Production Towards the end of the 1960s, director Filippo Ratti became involved with the short-lived production company Primax and directed two films written by Aldo Marcovecchio that were shot on the same sets: Erika and The Night of the Damned. The Night of the Damned went into production as Il castello dei Saint-Lambert. The film was shot in Ceri, Cerviteri and at Elios Studios in Rome. The film's score by Carlo Savina is predominantly recycled from his music made for Malenka. Release The Night of the Damned was initially released in Italy on 10 September 1971 where it was distributed by Panta Cinematografica. Compared to Erika which grossed 300 million Italian lire, The Night of the Demon grossed considerably less and by the time it had been sent to the board of censors in Italy, Primax had gone bankrupt. Film historian and critic Roberto Curti described the film's gross as \\"a modest sum\\" of 82,772,000 lire. When the film was released in France as Les nuits sexuelles on April 23, 1975 which featured more explicit scenes such as one where females are tickled by naked handmaidens while lesbian and heterosexual couplings take place around them. At a screening in Genoa, a version described as the \\"nude version\\" was accidentally screened which led to the projectionist to apologize and offer refunds.

Typically it has a violet semi-translucent body with a bright opaque white margin to the mantle. The violet colouration can be absent and replaced by milky white or present just as a more intense inner border to the mantle. In these pale colour forms there is usually a brown patch in the middle of the back, edged with violet. The gills are pale at the base becoming orange or brown towards the tips. The rhinophores have orange or brown clubs and usually have purple bases. A characteristic which distinguishes this species from similar coloured species in the Hypselodoris bullocki clade is that the mantle behind the gills is quite abruptly narrowed and contain a concentration of subcutaneous defensive glands.

Astromaterials are classified as either non-restricted or restricted, depending on the nature of the Solar System body. Non-restricted samples include the Moon, asteroids, comets, solar particles and space dust. Restricted bodies include planets or moons suspected to have either past or present habitable environments to microscopic life, and therefore must be treated as extremely biohazardous. Overview Spacecraft instruments are subject to mass and power constraints, in addition of the limitations imposed by the extreme environment of outer space on the sensitive science instruments, so bringing extraterrestrial material to Earth is desired for extensive scientific analyses. For the purpose of planetary protection, astromaterial samples brought to Earth by sample-return missions must be received and curated in a specially-designed and equipped biocontainment facility that must also double as a cleanroom to preserve the science value of the samples. Samples brought from non-restricted bodies such as the Moon, asteroids, comets, solar particles and space dust, are processed at specialized facilities rated Biosafety level-3 (BSL-3).

NASA is also assessing a 2017 proposal to build a mobile and modular BSL-4 facility to secure a sample return capsule at the landing site to conduct preliminary biohazard analyses.Mobile/Modular BSL-4 Facilities for Meeting Restricted Earth Return Containment Requirements. M. J. Calaway, F. M. McCubbin, J. H. Allton, R. A. Zeigler, and L. F. Pace. (PDF) NASA. 2017. After completion of biohazard testing, decisions could be made to sterilize the sample or transport all or portions to a permanent quarantine storage facility anywhere in the world. The systems of such facilities must be able to contain unknown biohazards, as the sizes of any putative alien microorganisms or infectious agents are unknown. Ideally it should filter particles of 0.01 Œºm or larger, and release of a particle 0.05 Œºm or larger is unacceptable under any circumstance.European Science Foundation - Mars Sample Return backward contamination - Strategic advice and requirements The reason for this extremely small size limit of 0.01 Œºm is for consideration of gene transfer agents (GTAs) which are virus-like particles that are produced by some microorganisms that package random segments of DNA capable of horizontal gene transfer. These randomly incorporate segments of the host genome and can transfer them to other evolutionarily distant hosts, and do that without killing the new host. In this way many archaea and bacteria can swap DNA with each other. This raises the possibility that Martian life, if it has a common origin with Earth life in the distant past, could swap DNA with Earth microorganisms in the same way. Another reason for the 0.01 Œºm limit is because of the discovery of ultramicrobacteria as small as 0.2 Œºm across. Robotic advocates consider that humans represent a significant source of contamination for the samples, and that a BSL-4 facility with robotic systems is the best way forward.

United States, No. 17-646, 587 U.S. ___ (2019), was a United States Supreme Court case about the separate sovereignty exception to the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which allows both federal and state prosecution of the same crime as the governments are \\"separate sovereigns\\". Terance Martez Gamble was prosecuted under both state and then federal laws for possessing a gun while being a felon. His argument that doing so was double jeopardy was found unpersuasive due to the exception. In June 2019, the Supreme Court affirmed the lower court decision 7‚Äì2, with the majority opinion stating that there was not sufficient cause for overturning the dual sovereignty doctrine.. Legal background The separate sovereigns doctrine holds that because the federal and state government are \\"separate sovereigns\\", the Double Jeopardy Clause does not apply to prosecution of the same crime under both federal and state laws. The doctrine is more than 150 years old. States can (and some do) have \\"economy of prosecution\\" policies, which make it a policy to not concurrently expend resources to prosecute offenses against their State laws where an alleged perpetrator is arrested and being tried for equal or greater offenses, similar or identical to alleged offenses against the laws of the prosecution's State. In those States, the District or States' Attorneys will only move to prosecute an alleged perpetrator should (1) the initial prosecution fail to convict, or (2) the case is abandoned before a verdict. In all such instances, the separate Sovereigns doctrine retains the authority to prosecute at the discretion of the State, sister State, or Federal government. In the 1959 cases of Abbate v. United StatesAbbate v. United States, . and Bartkus v. Illinois,Bartkus v. Illinois, . the Supreme Court affirmed the doctrine. The doctrine has been criticized by many scholars as having no basis in the text of the clause. Case background In November 2015, Terance Martez Gamble was pulled over in Mobile, Alabama for a damaged headlight. After a search of the vehicle, a handgun was found which was illegal under both Alabama state and federal laws because he was a felon. He was convicted under Alabama state law and given a one-year sentence. He was also prosecuted under federal laws, and after the district court concluded that double jeopardy did not apply in this case, he pled guilty and received a 46-month sentence. Gamble appealed to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, who affirmed the district court's decision based on the precedent of Abbate. Supreme Court In June 2018 the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case. Gamble's petition to the Supreme Court noted that in 2016, Supreme Court Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Clarence Thomas argued for a review of the separate sovereigns doctrine in a concurring opinion in Puerto Rico v. Sanchez Valle;Puerto Rico v. Sanchez Valle, . Ginsburg's opinion stated that \\"The matter warrants attention in a future case in which a defendant faces successive prosecutions by parts of the whole USA.\\" =Amicus briefs= According to The Atlantic, the U.S. federal government contended that \\"overturning the dual-sovereignty doctrine would upend the country‚Äôs federalist system\\", and that the increasing number of federal criminal laws means that it is important that states be allowed to \\"preserve their own sphere of influence and prevent federal encroachment on law enforcement\\". The American Civil Liberties Union, the Cato Institute, and the Constitutional Accountability Center filed a joint amicus brief on the case, arguing that there is no textual basis for the doctrine in the Double Jeopardy Clause, which states that \\"[n]o person shall be ... subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb\\", and that the rising amount of federal criminal laws and state-federal task forces means there will be more dual state-federal prosecution. The case has been analysed in the context of the Special Counsel investigation into the Trump campaign; if the separate sovereigns doctrine had been overruled, a pardon for federal crimes from President Donald Trump would have prevented state prosecution. United States Senator Orrin Hatch filed an amicus brief in the case, arguing against the separate sovereigns doctrine. A spokesperson for him denied any relation of the brief to the investigation, saying that Hatch wants the doctrine to be overturned due to \\"the rapid expansion of both the scope and substance of modern federal criminal law\\". Columbia Law professor Daniel Richman wrote that state and federal charges usually have \\"no overlap, or almost no overlap, that would ring Fifth Amendment chimes in the absence of the dual sovereign analysis\\", and so the impact of overturning the separate sovereigns doctrine would be minimal. =Oral arguments= Oral arguments were originally scheduled to be heard on December 5, 2018, but were postponed due to a day of mourning for George H. W. Bush, who died on November 30, 2018. Oral arguments were heard on December 6. Observers found the Court to be concerned about overruling 170 years of the doctrine and the instability that would result with this change, but did affirm that there is concern from academics and judiciaries on the doctrine's effects. =Decision= The Supreme Court issued its decision on June 17, 2019, affirming the lower court's decision. Justice Samuel Alito wrote the 7‚Äì2 majority opinion, stating that there was not sufficient cause for overturning the dual sovereignty doctrine. Alito highlighted that it is written into law that a person may be tried for the same offense in both national and international courts, so the exception for double jeopardy between state and federal trials already exists. Justice Clarence Thomas, who joined Alito's opinion, wrote a concurring opinion to state that the historical record of the double jeopardy clause does not justify overturning the dual sovereignty principle from this case, but urged the court to be more willing to overturn precedents when they are \\"demonstrably erroneous\\". Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Neil Gorsuch wrote separate dissenting opinions. Ginsburg wrote citing The Federalist Papers in the \\"Different parts of the 'WHOLE' United States should not be positioned to prosecute a defendant a second time for the same offense\\". Gorsuch wrote \\"When governments may unleash all their might in multiple prosecutions against an individual, exhausting themselves only when those who hold the reins of power are content with the result, it is the poor and the weak, and the unpopular and controversial, who suffer first‚Äîand there is nothing to stop them from being the last.\\" References External links * Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Roberts Court Category:United States Double Jeopardy Clause case law Category:2019 in United States case law Category:United States firearms law Category:Mobile, Alabama ","title":"Gamble v.

Career  In 1944 he was Vice Consul in Washington, D.C. He was then employed by Jo√£o Alberto Lins de Barros's Rubber Army company, which raised the Brazilian production of natural rubber for sale during the war. From 4 July 1955 to 1 November 1957, he was an extraordinary envoy and plenipotentiary minister in Helsinki. From 1957 to 1959 he was ambassador in Asunci√≥n. From 19 December 1959 to 26 March 1962, he was ambassador in Quito. From 18 January 1965 to 9 September 1966 he was Ambassador in Bogot√°. From 16 November 1966 to 17 October 1968 he was Ambassador in Algiers. From 19 October 1968 to 20 April 1973, he was Ambassador to the Holy See.Senado Federal, Subsecretaria de Anais do Senado, 1968, p. 101  Personal life  Jos√© Jobim was the son of Francisco Antenor Jobim and Joaquina Pinheiro Jobim. He had an older brother, Danton, who assumed the presidency of the Brazilian newspaper √öltima Hora, which opposed the military dictatorship in Brazil, when its creator, Samuel Wainer, was exiled by the dictatorship, and in 1970 he was elected senator for the Brazilian Democratic Movement, an opposition party to the regime; Danton died in 1978. Jobim was married to a sister of Leda Collor, mother of Fernando Collor de Mello. They had a daughter, Lygia Collor Jobim, also a diplomat.  Death  On 15 March 1979, Jobim attended the inauguration of Jo√£o Figueiredo as President of Brazil. During his stay, he mentioned that he was writing a memoir in which he would detail irregularities in the work of the Itaipu Dam, including an overbilling of ten times the original value. Jobim was Brazil's ambassador to Paraguay from 1957 to 1959 at the beginning of negotiations on the creation of the dam, was sent by President Jo√£o Goulart in February 1964 (just before the 1964 coup d'etat in Brazil), to a mission with Paraguayan ministers to discuss the issue, and in 1966, while he was ambassador of Brazil in Colombia, he participated in the signing of the Ata das Cataratas (\\"Falls Act\\"), the initial document of the construction of Itaipu, as a consultant. On 22 March, Jobim went to visit a friend and did not return. The next morning, the owner of a pharmacy in Barra da Tijuca called Jobim's family and reported that Jobim had given her a note half an hour earlier. Jobim claimed that he had been abducted in his own car and that he would be taken to \\"just after the Joatinga Bridge.\\" Jobim's body was found on the morning of 24 March 24, less than a kilometer from the bridge, hung by the neck with a nylon rope by the branch of a tree. However, his feet touched the ground and his legs were bent, raising suspicion about the hypothesis of suicide that the authorities claimed. On 21 September 2018, the Brazilian government issued a new death certificate for Jobim, as a result of the work of the Special Commission on the Dead and Disappeared Politicians and the National Truth Commission of Brazil, which in its final report in December 2014, recommended that the country rectify the cause of death of people who died as a result of human rights violations, including forced disappearances. The new certificate, which gives 24 March 1979 as his date of death, acknowledges that Jobim was kidnapped, tortured, and murdered, giving his cause of death as \\"unnatural, violent death, caused by the Brazilian State, in the context of the systematic and widespread persecution of the population identified as political opponents to the dictatorial regime from 1964 to 1985\\".

It is also possible to purchase tobacco from convenience stores and alcohol from several licensed stores. The most commonly consumed intoxicants on the island are normally made from tobacco, cannabis, opium, toddy or arrack.

Arrack is often combined with popular mixers such as cola, soda water, and lime juice.SL‚Äôs Sin Industry and Sin Tax, W. A. Wijewardena Daily Ft ThinkWorth, Accessed 2015-10-11  Production  Other than water, the entire manufacturing process revolves around the fermentation and distillation of a single ingredient, the sap of unopened flowers from a coconut palm (Cocos nucifera). Each morning at dawn, men known as toddy tappers move among the tops of coconut trees using connecting ropes not unlike tightropes. A single tree may contribute up to two litres per day. Due to its concentrated sugar and yeast content, the captured liquid naturally and immediately ferments into a mildly alcoholic drink called \\"toddy\\", tuak, or occasionally \\"palm wine\\". Within a few hours after collection, the toddy is poured into large wooden vats, called \\"wash backs\\", made from the wood of teak or Berrya cordifolia. The natural fermentation process is allowed to continue in the wash backs until the alcohol content reaches 5-7% and deemed ready for distillation. Distillation is generally a two-step process involving either pot stills, continuous stills, or a combination of both. The first step results in \\"low wine\\", a liquid with an alcohol content between 20 and 40%. The second step results in the final distillate with an alcohol content of 60 to 90%. It is generally distilled to between 33% and 50% alcohol by volume (ABV) or 66 to 100 proof. The entire distillation process is completed within 24 hours. Various blends of coconut arrack diverge in processing, yet the extracted spirit may also be sold raw, repeatedly distilled or filtered, or transferred back into halmilla vats for maturing up to 15 years, depending on flavor, color and fragrance requirements. Premium blends of arrack add no other ingredients, while the inexpensive and common blends are mixed with neutral spirits before bottling. Most people describe the taste as resembling \\"‚Ä¶a blend between whiskey and rum\\", similar, but distinctively different at the same time.  Products  According to the Alcohol and Drug Information Centre's 2008 report on alcohol in Sri Lanka, the types of arrack are: * Special arrack, which is produced in the highest volume, nearly doubling in production between 2002 and 2007. * Molasses arrack is the least-processed kind and considered the common kind. Nevertheless, as a whole, arrack is the most popular local alcoholic beverage consumed in Sri Lanka and produced as a wide variety of brands that fit into the following three categories: * Premium aged, after distillation, is aged in halmilla vats for up to 15 years to mature and mellow the raw spirit before blending. Premium brands include Ceylon Arrack, VSOA, VX, Vat9, Old Reserve and Extra Special. * Premium clear is generally not aged, but often distilled and/or filtered multiple times to soften its taste. Premium clear brands include Double Distilled and Blue Label. * Common is blended with other alcohols produced from molasses or mixed with neutral spirits as filler.  Producers  Sri Lanka's largest manufacturers, listed in order based on their 2007 annual production of arrack, are: * DCSL (Distilleries Company of Sri Lanka), 37.25 million litres * IDL (International Distilleries Ltd), 3.97 million litres * Rockland Distilleries (Pvt) Ltd, 2.18 million litres * Mendis, 0.86 million litres Ceylon Arrack, a brand of Sri Lankan coconut arrack, was launched in the UK in 2010. It is also available in France and Germany.Ceylon Arrack Bottled in UK Retrieved 18 September 2009 White Lion VSOA entered the American market soon after. = Toddy = Toddy is a white liquor created from fermenting the sap of the coconut flower. It is considered to be the island's most popular drink and it is often spiced up with onions and chilli. The liquid ferments quickly and must be drunk on the same day that it is tapped. Its sale is limited to local toddy taverns.  Production  The people who make Toddy are known as \\"Toddy Tappers\\". # Thalanawa. The flower is beaten for three days. # Labu Katey. A container is tied to the plant and the flower is cut, allowing the sap to drain into the container. # The sap is fermented to produce Toddy. It can then be mixed with chilli or onions to create a 'masala' style drink. = Beer = Lion is the most popular beer on the island and it is domestically produced by a local subsidiary of the Carlsberg Group. It can be bought in 4.8% and 8.8%. Lion Brewery, the largest brewer in Sri Lanka  History  Brewing began in Sri Lanka in 1881 primarily to meet the needs of the colonial tea planters. Despite the country's tropical weather the preferred beer styles have remained relatively unchanged, with strong stouts remaining popular.  Market  In 2011 Sri Lanka‚Äôs beer market was estimated to be around 51 million litres per annum, with per capita beer consumption at around 2.7 litres. An increase from 50 million litres and 2.45 litres in 2009. The beer market only represents 39% of the total legitimate alcohol market, the market share, however, is growing compared to the hard liquor segment. In 2011 the beer industry grew by 23 per cent in volumes against 10 per cent growth in the hard liquor segment. Out of the beer consumed in Sri Lanka 90% is manufactured locally with the remainder imported from Asian markets such as Vietnam, Singapore and India. The local beer market is currently occupied by three main brewers. The largest of Sri Lanka's brewers is the Lion Brewery, which is also the oldest brewery in the country. It produces over 80% of Sri Lanka's beers. In 1988 it constructed a new brewery at Biyagama to replace the century-old facility at Nuwara Eliya. In 1993 the brewery became a subsidiary of Carson Cumberbatch & Co Ltd, and in 1996 the Carlsberg Group acquired a 25% share of the company. The brewery's portfolio includes lagers, strong beers and stouts, notably Lion, Lion Strong and Lion Stout. The company also brews Carlsberg and Guinness under licence. The brewery exports its beers to the U.S., Europe, Japan, Australia and the Maldives. Sri Lanka's second largest brewer is Asia Pacific Brewery Lanka Limited, which acquired local brewer, United Brewery, in 2005. Asia Pacific Breweries is a Singaporean-based joint venture between Heineken International and Fraser and Neave. It has a brewery in Mawathagama where it produces a range of King beers, including Bison XXtra, Kings Lager, Kings Pilsner and Kings Stout. The country's third and smallest brewer is the McCallum Brewery, which was established in 1963 in Meegoda. In 2011 the brewery was acquired by Cargills Ceylon PLC. It produces a number of lagers, ales and stouts, notably Three Coins and Sando Stout.  Herbals  = Cannabis = Cannabis is widely consumed in Sri Lanka due to its historic use in traditional medicine and religious festivities. It was also given a boost culturally due to the booming opium trade during colonialism, though nevertheless the product was banned during the latter stages of colonialism and furthermore subject to UN sanctions. It has however remained in use through this period as part of religious/celebratory customs and traditional medicine. The only legal method for a common person to obtain cannabis is through a licensed traditional medicine shop, and often cannabis will only be sold as part of a mixture/solution containing other herbs. These medicine shops obtain cannabis from the Ministry of Health, mostly sourced from the seizures of illegal cannabis by the police.  Legality  Cannabis is criminalized under the Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance of 1935 but it has been amended several times to allow the medical and scientific use of what is calls 'hemp' for 'galenical' purposes, the latter term translating roughly to the use of herbs to create medicines.http://www.nddcb.gov.lk/Docs/acts/25345.pdf It is notable that these 'galenical medicines' include products that can induce euphoria and heightening sexual satisfaction.http://www.unodc.org/pdf/india/publications/south_Asia_Regional_Profile_Sept_2005/13_srilanka.pdf Its consumption and sale has further been legalized under the Ayurveda Act, which allows traditional medicine practitioners and herbal shops to legally sell hemp to consumers as long as they have a valid ayurvedic license. The herbal shops are only allowed to obtain hemp through the Ministry of Health, which in turn obtains the drug from the police (seizures of illegally imported drugs) or from government-sanctioned cannabis farms on the island.  Use  The cannabis infusion Madana Modaka is sold in \\"petti kades\\" near schools, and are known to be purchased by school boys for \\"kicks\\". = Opium = Opium is legally allowed to be bought and sold by herbal practitioners as per the Ayurveda Act. The Poisons, Opium and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance of 1935 also allows for the medicinal and scientific use of opium. = Tobacco =  Market  Ceylon Tobacco Company PLC (CTC) is a Sri Lankan tobacco company engaged in the manufacture, marketing and export of cigarettes. It is a subsidiary of British American Tobacco. CTC is the second largest company traded on the Colombo Stock Exchange. CTC enjoys a virtual monopoly in the manufacture of cigarettes in the country. Cigarette brands marketed by CTC in Sri Lanka include Bristol, Capstan, Dunhill, John Player Gold Leaf, Lucky Strike, Pall Mall and Three Roses.  Social Issues  The island face problems with patrons frequenting illicit moonshine brewers and bootleggers in order to purchase illegal alcohol. This is promoted through prohibitive laws that ban people from purchasing alcohol on many days, and high taxes that make much alcohol legally expensive. Due to the monopoly on many narcotics, there are concerns that many government officials engage in corruption through the distribution of cannabis and opium by asking for kickbacks, albeit there is not illegality to the sale of cannabis through the Ministry of Health.

Early life and education Geoff Dench was born in Brighton on 14 August 1940 to Herbert, a dental technician, and Edna, who had trained as an accountant. He did not see his father until he was five years old due to the Second World War. His parents divorced when he was 18.

There he met Michael Young, later author of The Rise of the Meritocracy (1958), and together they established the Cambridge Sociology Society. He completed his PhD at the London School of Economics on the Maltese community in Soho in the 1950s. Career Dench helped to create the Department of Social Policy and Sociology at the University of Middlesex and subsequently became professor there.

In The New East End (2006) he explored, with co-authors Kate Gavron and Michael Young (died 2002), the attitudes of the white working class to Bangladeshi immigrants in the London area of Tower Hamlets and particularly the tensions between the two over the allocation of social housing. The book was an updating of Young's East End, Family and Kinship (1957). The authors concluded that the alienation of the white community in the area was partly an unintended consequence of policies designed to help the poorest in society but which ignored the legitimate expectations of other communities such as the white working class.Lost horizons.

Function microRNAs (miRNAs) are short (20-24 nt) non-coding RNAs that are involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in multicellular organisms by affecting both the stability and translation of mRNAs. miRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II as part of capped and polyadenylated primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs) that can be either protein- coding or non-coding. The primary transcript is cleaved by the Drosha ribonuclease III enzyme to produce an approximately 70-nt stem-loop precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA), which is further cleaved by the cytoplasmic Dicer ribonuclease to generate the mature miRNA and antisense miRNA star (miRNA*) products. The mature miRNA is incorporated into a RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which recognizes target mRNAs through imperfect base pairing with the miRNA and most commonly results in translational inhibition or destabilization of the target mRNA. The RefSeq represents the predicted microRNA stem-loop. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2009].

Early life Lade was the fifth but third surviving son of Thomas Lade of Warbleton and his wife Mary Nutt, daughter of John Nutt, DD, of Selmeston, Sussex and was baptized on. 29 May 1662. He became a brewer at Southwark and a member of the Leathersellers Company. He built up a fortune from brewing and invested widely in overseas trading enterprises. Career Politically Lade was to start with a strong Jacobite and become involved in local politics on the Tory side as early as 1695. There was a powerful contingent of Whig brewers at Southwark, in particular Charles Cox, and Lade decided to challenge them. He stood at the general election at Southwark in July 1702. Although defeated, he petitioned and the election was declared void. However he did not fare any better in the rerun of the election in November 1702. He did not stand at the 1705 general election, but Charles Cox and his fellow Whigs launched a campaign to discredit him before the 1708 general election. In March 1709 he suggested to Henry Sacheverell that he put himself forward for the vacant office of chaplain at St Saviour's, Southwark and after launching a vigorous campaign, Sacheverell was successful. Lade went to St. Paul's to hear Sacheverell deliver a controversial sermon for which he was later impeached. The campaign at Southwark and the sermon antagonized the Whigs and stirred up Tory support which lead them to victory at the 1710 general election. Lade did not share the triumph as he was defeated at Southwark again. In 1710 he became Master of the Leathersellers‚Äô Company for a year and in 1711 he was appointed a Commissioner for. taking subscriptions to the South Sea Company. He was an assistant of the. Royal African Company in 1712 and 1713. At the 1713 general election he was elected Member of Parliament for Souhthwark. The election was declared void in April 1714 but he topped the poll in a re-election on 3 May 1714. Lade was returned unopposed as MP for Southwark at the 1715 general election. By 1719 he was a Governor of St Thomas‚Äô Hospital. and was a director of the South Sea Company from 1721 to 1724. He did not stand at Southwark in 1722 but was returned at a by-election on 17 January 1724. He did not stand at the 1727 general election. In 1728 he was Master of the Leathersellers‚Äô Company again for a year. He was created baronet on. 11 March 1731. From 1733 to 1739, he was a director of the South Sea Company again. Death and legacy Lade died unmarried on 30 July 1740. He was succeeded in the baronetcy according to remainder by his great nephew, John Whithorne, who took the name of Lade.

This town is said to have been founded by Deucalion, and from it the Delphian nobles, at all events, derived their origin. Hence, Plutarch tells us that the five chief-priests of the god, called osioi (·ΩçœÉŒπŒøŒπ), were chosen by lot from a number of families who derived their descent from Deucalion.Scholiast of Apoll. Rhod. 2.711Plutarch Quaest. Graec. 9, p. 380. It appears the inhabitants of Lycoreia were Dorians, who had spread from the Dorian Tetrapolis over the heights of Parnassus. At all events, we know that a Doric dialect was spoken at Delphi; and the oracle always showed a leaning towards the Greeks of the Doric race. Moreover, that the Delphians were of a different race from the Phocians is clear from the antipathy which always existed between the two peoples. The location of Lycoreia has not been fixed with precision, although some identify it with the modern village of Liakouri, where some ruins of ancient walls remain.

It closed later that century but reopened as the Cambridge Festival Theatre from 1926 until 1935. The building, in which part of the interior of the theatre survives, is Grade II* listed.  19th century  William Wilkins (1751‚Äì1815), a building contractor, was proprietor of a chain of theatres in East Anglia known as the Norwich circuit. Performers included the Norwich Company of Comedians, and performances had been given since the late 18th century on Stourbridge Common, north of the city of Cambridge, at the annual Stourbridge fair. Wilkins and his son, also William (1778‚Äì1839), built a theatre in 1807 at Sun Street, Barnwell. The younger Wilkins ‚Äì a prominent architect who had designed Downing College and went on to work at other colleges and the National Gallery ‚Äì designed a new theatre nearby to replace the 1807 building. The building is on the south side of the Newmarket Road in the northeastern Cambridge suburb of Barnwell. Completed in 1816, the theatre was sited outside the boundary of the town owing to prohibition of theatrical entertainment by the University authorities (a 1737 act \\"for the More Effectual Preventing the Unlawful Playing of Interludes within the Precincts of the Two Universities ...\\" forbade the performance of all plays and operas within five miles of the town). On his father's death in 1815, Wilkins inherited the leases of the new site and six other theatres ‚Äì Norwich, Bury St Edmunds, Colchester, Yarmouth, Ipswich and King's Lynn ‚Äì and continued to run them. Proprietorship passed to his son, W Bushby Wilkins, and a succession of lessees, but the Norwich circuit declined. The theatre closed in 1878 and became a nonconformist chapel.  Cambridge Festival Theatre  Terence Gray (1895‚Äì1986) leased the building in 1926 and reopened it as the Cambridge Festival Theatre. The alleyway between the street and the building was enclosed to form a foyer. The interior was modernised, with the proscenium arch widened by the removal of the private boxes, and the introduction of electric lighting, a brick cyclorama and an early example of a revolving stage. The theatre was the country's \\"first permanent indoor performing space to be based on the design of a Greek open-air theatre\\". The 'Festival' name reflected Grey's intention (unfulfilled) to promote summer festivals. The opening production on 22 November 1926 was Oresteia, with choreography by Ninette de Valois. Grey retired from the theatre in 1933 and went on to write on Taoism under the pseudonym \\"Wei Wu Wei\\". Norman Marshall worked at the theatre from 1926 and was its director from 1932 to 1933. From 1927, Joseph Macleod was an actor and producer at the theatre, and in 1933 he became the theatre's director and lessee. Five of Macleod's plays were staged there, including Overture to Cambridge (1933) and A Woman Turned to Stone (1934). Under Macleod, the theatre became known for its avant-garde productions, and staging of lesser known works by great playwrights. Macleod staged some of Ezra Pound's Noh plays, and also some Ibsen and Chekhov (his company, The Cambridge Festival Players, was one of the first in the UK to stage Chekhov's play The Seagull). The theatre was obliged to close due to financial difficulties in June 1935. The building was recorded as Grade II* listed in 1950. From 1962 it was used by the Arts Theatre as a workshop and store.  Today  Entrance in 2013 The building is in use as a Buddhist centre. Historic England describe the interior as \\"a virtually complete example of a Georgian theatre with a three- tiered horsehoe auditorium with the galleries supported on cast iron columns.\\" and state that a painting of the Royal Arms remains above the proscenium.

Biography  Sibiryakov was born in Leningrad on February 28, 1964. At a minor age, he was first convicted of hooliganism, and after release he married. The absence of any prospects and reluctance to work, eventually led Sibiryakov on the criminal path. By the time of the attacks and murder series, he lived in the city of Pushkin (a municipal town in St. Petersburg).Documentary film \\"The Elusive\\" from the series \\"Sledstvie veli...\\" (\\"The Investigation Was Conducted By...\\") featuring Leonid Kanevsky (in Russian) Subsequently, the interior minister of the homicide department of the Central Internal Affairs Directorate of St. Petersburg, Alexander Malyshev, who directly participated in the investigation of Sibiryakov's crimes, said the following about him: Sibiryakov was characterized as extremely cowardly, being too afraid to confess to his wife that he had been fired from his job for absenteeism. Every day he spent hours walking around Pushkin, and after some time stumbled upon the burial site of Grigori Rasputin. According to Sibiryakov, at that moment he felt that he deserved more in his life, and afterwards came more than once to Rasputin's grave. He decided that at this point he gets \\"energy feeding\\". Sibiryakov committed assaults in the same way: he introduced himself as an employee of the municipal engineering company \\"Lenenergo\\", then penetrated into apartments where there were only single women, killing and robbing them afterwards. In just a few weeks, he committed six attacks: five of them (on Nadezhda Mironovich, Elena Aleksandrova, two women named Deyeva and Valentinova, and Tatyana Pavlova) were fatal. In one more case, the victim, Viktoria Bodumyan, miraculously survived, because, after striking her with a knife, the maniac broke the handle. During another attack, Sibiryakov was frightened off, and did not manage to finish the crime. His modus operandi in many respects was similar to that of Vladimir Ionesyan, who had murdered 25 years before. = Arrest = When he learned that his crimes were on the popular TV show \\"600 Seconds\\", Sibiryakov was so filled with pride for what he had done and, believing in his own impunity, sent an anonymous letter to the Central Internal Affairs Directorate of Leningrad demanding 50,000 rubles for stopping the crimes. He demanded an answer through the same telecast. In one of the issues, the presenter of \\"600 Seconds\\" Alexander Nevzorov said: The next day, Sibiryakov called and appointed a meeting point on the railway platform \\"Prospect Glory\\" in Pushkin. He dressed in construction clothes and wore a helmet, which remained from his previous job. Snatching money from the police car, the maniac rushed to get away, crossing the railway tracks right in front of a train in order to escape law enforcement officers. However, on the other side, there was an on-duty policeman who rushed after him in pursuit. They noticed that the killer disappeared into a basement, and blocked him. At the time he changed clothes in the basement and tried to get out of the entrance, but was detained. Soon after his arrest, the maniac confessed to his crimes. At his home, most of the stolen items were found, and Sibiryakov's neighbors subsequently seized gold items which had been robbed from them. The court sentenced Andrei Sibiryakov to death, and he was executed by firing squad, but the exact date of the execution is unknown.

Life and career Williams was born in Liverpool. He played football for Lancashire Combination club St Helens Recreation and Stafford Rangers of the Birmingham & District League before joining Glossop ahead of the 1912‚Äì13 Football League season. He made seven Second Division appearances, scoring twice, in the first two months of the season and then moved up a division to join Notts County for a \\"substantial\\" fee which was later reported as ¬£700. Williams' contribution was not enough to save Notts County from relegation from the First Division, but he was prepared to sign on for a further season when some of his teammates were still arguing for higher wages if they were to remain with a second-tier club. By the end of the 1913‚Äì14 season, he had scored 5 goals from 31 league appearances and Notts were back in the First Division. In May 1914, Williams signed for Belfast Celtic of the Irish League. He scored prolifically for the team, including a league record five goals in a match against Cliftonville, and was selected for the Probables in an Irish League representative team trial played as a charity match in aid of the Prince of Wales' National Relief Fund. With gate receipts reduced because of the war, the League decided to impose a 25% wage cut on its players. Williams successfully appealed to the Irish Football Association on the grounds that \\"the reduction was excessive, and held that no third party could break a contract between club and player.\\" While accepting the need for a reductionthe player was prepared to accept 12.5%the Association felt it had \\"no option but to uphold the contract\\". Belfast Celtic won the 1914‚Äì15 Irish League title, and Williams was a member of the team that reached the final of the Irish Cup. During the First World War, Williams worked in the munitions factories in Liverpool before joining the Royal Field Artillery. While serving as a corporal, he captained his unit's football team. When his other duties allowed, he played wartime football for Liverpool (the Liverpool Echo suggested that the local clubs' failure to sign him before the war had been a mistake), broke his arm while representing Preston North End in late 1915, and scored 4 goals from 16 appearances for Arsenal in the 1916‚Äì17 London Combination. Select season required. After his demobilisation, Williams joined Luton Town. Although Notts County had retained his Football League registration, the Southern League no longer recognised the retain and transfer system, so Luton were able to sign him without paying a fee. He was appointed captain, and the Luton Reporter described him as \\"one of the most earnest of players\\", but his 23 matches produced only 5 goals, and he was allowed to leave for another Southern League club, Brighton & Hove Albion, in March 1920 for a ¬£200 fee. He played at wing half as well as in all forward positions for Brighton, making 10 appearances in what remained of the 1919‚Äì20 season, and a further 21 in the next, of which all but one were in the newly formed Football League Third Division. The signing of Andy Neil in late 1920 reduced Williams' first-team opportunities considerably, and he was given a free transfer at the end of the season. His last known club was Maidstone United of the Kent League.

She met Stefan George in 1898, becoming the only woman to publish in his Bl√§tter fur die Kunst, and staying in close touch until 1914. Kantorowicz also became a disciple and assistant to Georg Simmel, and his secret lover. In 1907 she bore Simmel a daughter, a fact hidden until after Simmel's death in 1918. Before the First World War she published a study on 15th century Sienese art, and a German translation of Henri Bergson's Creative Evolution. In the mid-1920s she re- established contact with George. However, her work on the conceptual foundations of classical Greek art was only published posthumously. Although she was in England in 1938, she chose to return to Germany during the Czechoslovak crisis. After the outbreak of war, she managed to arrange a post at Skidmore College in the United States, but could not manage to leave Germany legally. Along with her aunt, the mother of Ernst Kantorowicz, she unsuccessfully tried to cross the border to Switzerland near Bregenz, and was sent to Theresienstadt. She died there in April 1945.

It measures of the capacity an antibiotic to select for transfected (resistant) cells that contain a selectable marker, while killing untransfected (sensitive) cells that do not contain a selectable marker. A selectivity factor higher than 10 is optimal. This means the concentration of antibiotic is sufficient to kill untransfected cells but not toxic enough to kill transfected cells. A selectivity factor lower than 10 means the concentration of antibiotic needed for selection is too close to the toxic concentration for the transfected cells. As a result, fewer transfected cells survive and more untransfected cells survive. In this case an alternative antibiotic should be considered. Calculating the selectivity factor The method uses a modified MTT assay. The MTT assay is a colorimetric assay used to assess cell metabolic activity. The assay is based on the reduction of yellow tetrazolium salt (MTT) by active cells to produce purple formazan crystals which accumulate in living cells. Cells are lysed, the crystals are dissolved, and the absorbance of the solution is analysed on a spectrophotometer as a measure of cell viability. In situations where the use of MTT is problematic, PI or Sytox Green screening in a fluorescence plate reader can be considered. The next step is to generate a kill curve which defines the ideal concentration of a selection antibiotic to kill untransfected cells (Fig 1A). Curves are generated for both sensitive cells and resistant cells. The half-maximal Inhibitory Concentration (IC50) can be calculated, which measures the potency of the antibiotic. The selectivity factor is calculated as follows: SF = IC50R/IC50S whereas SF = selectivity factor; IC50 = half-maximal inhibitory concentration; R= resistant cells; S = sensitive cells Advantages of the selectivity factor The selectivity factor has the following advantages: it is quantitative thus can be reported numerically using a microplate reader, it streamlines the process of generating stable cell lines (assay can be completed in 3 days), it considers both sensitive and resistant cells, and it allows comparison of the consistency and quality of antibiotics from different batches, vendors, and manufacturing methods. Practical uses of the selectivity factor The selectivity factor can be used for the creation of stably transfected cell lines, an important tool in drug discovery, biomedical research, and biological pathway investigation. Cell line creation involves transfection (transferring the gene into the cell line), and selection (applying selective pressure in the form of an antibiotic. Transfection efficiency is dependent on cell type, cell density, vector, and transfection method. Selection efficiency depends on the capacity of the antibiotic to kill the parental cells but not the transfected cells.

Completed in mid-1944, the boat was assigned to convoy escort duties and supporting German forces in the Baltic. She escorted a heavy cruiser in January 1945 as she bombarded Soviet troops and helped to evacuate troops and refugees from advancing Soviet forces in May. T33 was allocated to the Soviet Union after the war and was renamed Primerny. She served with the Baltic Fleet until 1954 when the ship was converted into an accommodation ship and renamed PKZ-63. She was turned over to be scrapped on 9 November 1956 and subsequently broken up. Design and description The Type 39 torpedo boat was conceived as a general-purpose design, much larger than preceding German torpedo boats.Whitley 1991, p. 52 The boats had an overall length of and were long at the waterline. They had a beam of , a draft of at deep load and displaced at standard load and at deep load.Gr√∂ner, p. 195 Their crew numbered 206 officers and sailors.Gardiner & Chesneau, p. 239 The Type 39s were fitted with a pair of geared steam turbine sets, each driving one propeller, using steam from four high-pressure water-tube boilers. The turbines were designed to produce which was intended give the ships a maximum speed of . They carried enough fuel oil to give them a range of at .Whitley 1991, pp. 54, 203 As built, the Type 39 ships mounted four SK C/32 guns in single mounts protected by gun shields; one forward of the superstructure, one between the funnels, and two aft, one superfiring over the other. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by four SK C/30 AA guns in two twin-gun mounts on platforms abaft the rear funnel and a dozen C/38 guns. One quadruple mount was positioned on the aft superstructure and two more were fitted on the bridge wings. They carried six above-water torpedo tubes in two triple mounts amidships and could also carry 30 mines; the full complement of 60 mines made the ships top-heavy which could be dangerous in bad weather. For anti-submarine work the boats were fitted with a S-Ger√§t sonar and four depth charge launchers. The Type 39s were equipped with a FuMO 21 radar and various FumB radar detectors were installed late in the war.Friedman, p. 205; Whitley 1991, pp. 52‚Äì55; Whitley 2000, p. 73 Construction and career T33 was ordered on 20 January 1941 from Schichau, laid down at their Elbing, East Prussia, shipyard as yard number 1515, launched in 1943 and commissioned on 16 June 1944. After working up, the boat was deployed to support German forces operating in the Baltic. She was one of the escorts for the heavy cruiser as the latter ship supported a German counterattack against advancing Soviet forces near Cranz, East Prussia, on 29‚Äì30 January 1945. Together with a pair of destroyers, T33 bombarded Soviet positions near Kolberg from 11 to 18 March to cover the evacuation of the city. The boat screened evacuation convoys from Hela, to friendly territory in early April. On 10 April, T33 towed the destroyer after she had been badly damaged by a mine. On 5 May, she helped to ferry 45,000 refugees from East Prussia to Copenhagen, Denmark, and returned to help transport 20,000 more to Gl√ºcksburg, Germany, on the 9th.Grooss, p. 279, 321; Rohwer, pp. 387, 395, 398, 410, 414; Whitley 1991, p. 180 T33 was allocated to the Soviet Union when the Allies divided the surviving ships of the Kriegsmarine amongst themselves in late 1945,Whitley 1991, pp. 191, 199, 212 and was assigned to the Baltic Fleet on 5 November. She was taken over by a Soviet crew on New Year's Day 1946, who raised the Soviet naval jack aboard her four days later. Renamed Primerny on 13 February 1946, the newly reclassified destroyer joined the North Baltic Fleet two days later. She served with the latter until 30 November 1954, when she was removed from combat duty and converted into a floating barracks before being renamed PKZ-63 on 28 December.

History  Czechoslovak People's Army tanks heading for the border during a training exercise, 1960s or 1970s The 13th Tank Division was formed on 9 May 1955 by renumbering the 3rd Tank Division, based at Mlad√°, Milovice in Bohemia. At the same time it was given the Kiev‚ÄìDukla‚ÄìOstrava historical designation in commemoration of battles that Czechoslovak forces fought in under Soviet command during World War II; to this was added the Czechoslovak-Soviet friendship honorific on 6 October 1959. Following the suppression of student demonstrations by the police during the Strahov events, the division's 8th Motor Rifle Regiment began a snap mobilization on 4 December 1967, during which 3,430 reservists were called up and 578 vehicles from Prague, Central Bohemia, and North Bohemia were mobilized. The reservists were released on 11 December and the regiment conducted training on the western border of Czechoslovakia until 18 December. By 1968, the division was part of the Western Military District and included the 13th Tank Regiment at ƒå√°slav, the 15th and 103rd Tank Regiments at Mlad√°, the 8th Motor Rifle Regiment at Mlad√° Boleslav, the 3rd School Tank Battalion at Lu≈°tƒõnice, the 361st Artillery Regiment at Turnov, and the 3rd Anti-Aircraft and 13th Separate Rocket Launcher Battalions at Mlad√°. The division headquarters was visited by Soviet Marshal Kirill Moskalenko in May 1968, ostensibly for Liberation Day, while other senior Soviet commanders went to other Czechoslovak units. When the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia began on 21 August 1968 the regimental anti-aircraft batteries of the division and the anti-tank missile battery of the 8th Motor Rifle Regiment were at the Jince Military Training Area, which was not occupied by Soviet troops. Other units that who were not blockaded by Soviet troops included a company of the 13th Reconnaissance Battalion and a tank battalion from the 13th Tank Regiment at the Mimo≈à Military Training Area. However, the main units of the division at Mlad√° and Mlad√° Boleslav were blockaded by the Soviet 20th Tank Division. After the establishment of the Soviet Central Group of Forces, the division was relocated to Topoƒæƒçany in Slovakia, where it was assigned the 10th Tank Regiment in Martin and the 64th Tank Regiment in Levice, transferred from the 14th Tank Division. In Bohemia it left behind the 13th Tank Regiment, which became part of the 4th Tank Division. In Slovakia, the division became a training unit, with 4,000 permanent personnel and 2,400 trainees. The 3rd School Tank Battalion was disbanded in 1968, followed by the 13th Helicopter Squadron in 1969. Additional units included the 3rd Chemical Defense Company, 13th Supply Company, 53rd Motor Transport Battalion, 3rd Medical Battalion, 13th Reconnaissance Battalion, 1st Engineer Battalion, 13th Communications Battalion, 8th Motor Rifle Regiment, 15th Tank Regiment, 3rd Artillery Regiment, and the 13th Technical Repair Shop. In 1989, as the Czechoslovak Army transitioned to a defensive posture, its 15th Tank Regiment was disbanded. With the fall of Communism in Czechoslovakia, the division's Soviet-era honorifics were modified by the removal of the Czechoslovak-Soviet friendship honorific and Kiev from the historical designation in 1991. On 1 January 1993, with the Dissolution of Czechoslovakia, the division became part of the Army of the Slovak Republic. The division was reorganized into the 1st Army Corps on 1 October 1994, and the headquarters of the latter became the Militia Headquarters on 1 April 2000.

Career  Andor Krausz was born on 12 January 1904 in Szombathely, Hungary, to Adolf Krausz and Iren Krausz (n√©e Rosenberge). After studying at the local Roman Catholic high school, he enrolled in the Technical Institute in Munich in 1922 and a year later moved to the School of Photography and Cinematography at Munich University. He edited Wilhelm Knapp's Filmtechnik after 1926, and lived in Germany until 1937, when he emigrated to the United Kingdom. As a student, he had become interested in publishing, but turned his hand to writing; by the late 1930s, he was an experienced writer on photography. After arriving in the United Kingdom, he began his own publishing house, Focal Press, which published its first books in 1938; one of those, W. D. Emanuel and F. L. Dash's The All-in- One Camera Book, would be reprinted in 81 editions. Thus began a series of books about the topic; he went on to publish 1,200 books on photography, cinematography and broadcasting, which sold 50 million copies.\\"Andor Kraszna- Krausz\\", Science Museum.

Across his career, Kraszna-Krausz also developed a reputation for predicting technological change in photography, with The Times calling him a \\"prophet of the camera arts\\". His works were especially popular in Germany, where he won the German Society for Photography's Culture Award in 1979. In the United Kingdom, he received an honorary DLitt from the University of Bradford.

A historical marker as well as a memorial honor her in Miami Beach. Barbara Baer Capitman Memorial in Lummus Park, Miami Beach, FL.  Early Life  Capitman was born in Chicago. Her father was a children's clothing manufacturer and her mother was an industrial designer of cars, planes, and appliances. The family moved to Westchester County, New York when Capitman was 3 years old. She graduated from New York University and worked as a reporter for the Atlantic City Daily World and wrote advertising copy. Her husband, William Capitman, was a market researcher and economist who died in 1975. In 1973, she moved to Miami Beach, Florida.  Historic Preservation  In 1976, Capitman and a group of historic preservationists formed the Miami Design Preservation League. They began a fight to save the long-neglected art deco buildings in Miami Beach. She lobbied politicians and developers with her forceful personality, in flowing dresses and tennis shoes. She and her supporters held candlelight vigils, protest marches and stood in front of bulldozers that were about to demolish buildings. Several of the buildings the group sought to preserve were torn down including the Senator and New Yorker Hotels. However, many more were saved. The group's efforts were rewarded when Miami Beach's Art Deco District was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. The renewed interest in the area led to an economic and cultural rebirth in the city with new investments in hotels, apartments and restaurants. It became a favorite destination of tourists, artists and moviemakers. Capitman's son Andrew bought several art deco buildings in the area including the Cardozo Hotel on Ocean Drive. Artists, designers and writers were frequently found in the hotel's caf√©.  Publications  In 1988, Capitman's book, Deco Delights: Preserving the Beauty and Joy of Miami Beach Architecture, was published. Rediscovering Art Deco: A Nationwide Tour of Architectural Delights, which she wrote with Michael D. Kinerk and Dennis W. Wilhelm, was published in 1994.  Death and tributes  Capitman died in Miami Beach at Mount Sinai Medical Center of congestive heart failure. She suffered from diabetes and heart tremors and died after two years of declining health. At the time of her death, she was working to create the first World Congress on Art Deco. It was to be held during the Miami Design Preservation League's Art Deco Weekend, a festival that drew 420,000 in 1990. In 1996, 10th Street between Washington Avenue and Ocean Drive in Miami Beach was renamed Barbara Capitman Way. A memorial featuring a bronze bust of Capitman was dedicated in Miami Beach's Lummus Park during Art Deco Weekend on January 16, 2016. It sits in the park across from the Cardozo Hotel at 13th Street and Ocean Drive.

It is most commonly associated with Northern Ireland where it is used by both unionists and nationalists to mark territory. It is an offence to paint kerbs in Northern Ireland, though there have been few prosecutions. Highways authorities have trialled the use of plastic paint-resistant kerbs to counter the problem.  Northern Ireland  Kerb painting is used in Northern Ireland by members of the unionist and nationalist communities. It is used to mark territories and boundaries and declare the sectarian affiliations of residents, in a similar fashion to sectarian murals. Street lights, litter bins and roundabout chevron stones have also been painted. Unionists use the colours of red, white and blue from the British Union flag, and nationalists the green, white and orange of the Irish tricolour. Painting of kerbs increases during the annual marching season. They are a source of annoyance for some residents of both political allegiances. There is an adage in Northern Ireland that one should never buy a house in a street where kerbs are painted, and the practice is said to have an adverse impact on local house prices. Leading Northern Ireland political parties Sinn F√©in (nationalist) and the Democratic Unionist Party have both stated that they oppose the practice of kerb painting. Kerb painting is prohibited by the Roads (Northern Ireland) Order 1993 and punishable by a fine of up to ¬£500, though offenders are rarely prosecuted. Highways authorities have the right to remove or replace affected items. Occasionally council workers tasked with restoring the kerbs to their original, neutral colours have been prevented from doing so by residents. Kerb painting has been treated by the Police Service of Northern Ireland as a sectarian hate crime. This is somewhat rare, as to be classified as such the person making the crime report must perceive themselves to have been targeted as a result of their beliefs. = Paint resistant kerbs = Paint resistant plastic kerbs have been developed for the Northern Ireland market. These are made from recycled plastics and can be cleaned of paint by a road sweeper. The Roads Service carried out a trial of the products from 2005 and since then 15 councils have also used the product, though there has been no large scale replacement of existing kerbs.  Elsewhere  Red painted kerbs (at right) in a Seattle street Kerbs in Granby Street in Liverpool have been painted in the Rastafarian colours of green, yellow and black. Some highway authorities in America including those in California, Honolulu and Salt Lake City have painted kerbs to denote parking or waiting restrictions. For example, in California, red kerbs denote fire lanes, where vehicle parking is prohibited. Painted kerbs have also been used to denote no parking restrictions in the approach to crosswalks. Across the US the painting of house numbers on road kerbs is relatively common. It can be run as a business and as a fundraiser for non-profit organisations. In some cases the practice is illegal, the kerb being considered the property of the highway authority.

Riddle was born in Louisville, Kentucky. At the age of 11, he moved with his family to Indianapolis. (part 2 of article) There, he eventually started working in his father's trucking and manufacturing businesses. By 1936, he was involved in an Indianapolis-area nightclub with illegal gambling, which was linked to mobster Al Capone and his Chicago Outfit. In 1940, he became involved with another gambling club in Moline, Illinois. Around this time, he was romantically linked to mob figure Virginia Hill. Riddle moved to Chicago in the 1940s. Riddle made a fortune in the 1930s and 1940s with an oil and gas drilling company in Texas. He also owned a trucking company in Evansville, Indiana from 1937 to 1954. Riddle started his Las Vegas casino career in 1956, when he took over the Dunes. Riddle and his co-investors substantially expanded the hotel using loans from the mob-influenced Teamsters pension fund. He was also noted for booking the first topless showgirl revue in Las Vegas, Minsky's Follies, into the casino. He opened the Silver Nugget casino in North Las Vegas in 1964. Around 1975, he took over the Riata Club and reopened it as the Silver City Casino. In 1977, he took over operation of the Thunderbird hotel casino and renamed it as the Silver Bird. In 1978, he opened the casino at the Holiday International, under a lease from the hotel. In 1963, Riddle wrote The Weekend Gambler's Handbook, a book of advice for casino gamblers. It became popular, despite containing some advice that was based on superstition rather than mathematics. Riddle's son, Charles, died of suicide in 1966 at the age of 18. Riddle died on July 8, 1980 at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, from pneumonia after suffering from a rare blood disease. Soon after his death, Riddle's casinos went into bankruptcy. The Silverbird and the Holiday International closed down, and the Silver Nugget and Silver City were sold off. Riddle's estate sold his remaining shares in the Dunes around 1984.

She was designed, built, and commissioned in Toulon, France. She was in commission from 9 August 1970 until 2 January 2006. History Mangro (S133) was laid down on 8 July 1968 and launched on 7 February 1970 at Toulon in France. She was commissioned in the Pakistan Navy on 8 August 1970. In 1971, her crew began receiving training in France, and became involved in events surrounding the East Pakistan when a mutiny took place in the ship to defect to India. At the time her crew were receiving training thirteen of the crew were East Pakistanis who planned an operation to take over the submarine and try to defect to India from France. Mangro was ordered to report back to submarine base in Karachi on 1 April 1971 but her plan to depart was interrupted when the 13 East Pakistani enlists decided to seized the submarine. Their plan, however, was foiled due to the advanced knowledge gained by the Naval Intelligence, leading the Navy SSG to undertake an armed action plan to counter the mutiny, resulting the death of one mutineer while the others escaped from the base in France and took refuge in the Indian Embassy in Geneva in Switzerland. Later during the war (see main article:Operation Jackpot) these 13 East Pakistani mutineers would contribute during the operation which saw between 60-100 Pakistani ships sunk. After the incident, Mangro sailed to Pakistan under the command of Lieutenant-Commander Shamim Khalid and reported to its base in Karachi. On 22 November 1971, Mangro was deployed under the command of Lieutenant-Commander Shamim to patrol off the Arabian Sea, and eventually detected the Indian Navy's armada that was sent to attack Karachi. No attack was carried out as both nations had not officially declared war, but she tracked the squadron. On 2 December 1971, Mangro reported back to her base, only to witness the attack on Karachi by the squadron she had tracked earlier had been commenced. During its war operations, Mangro continued her operations and reported back to base safely after the ceasefire between the two nations was reached. On 2 January 2006, she was decommissioned having completed 34-years of service with the Pakistan Navy.

Career  Born in London on 19 May 1939 to musician parents, Margaret Anna Eastoe (who was known professionally after 1964 by her husband Giles Gordon's surname), studied at St Martin's School of Art, but moved to Camberwell College of Arts because, she said, all the women at Saint Martin's were there to find husbands and she wanted to be an artist, and the Central School of Arts and Crafts. She then became a part-time teacher in Bexhill, but continued to paint, exhibiting her first work in 1965. She illustrated a number of books for Macmillan, including George MacBeth's Noah's Journey, before producing her own picture book The Green Children (with Macmillan's Kevin Crossley-Holland) in 1966. This won the best children's book prize from the Arts Council in 1968. She and Crossley-Holland published The Callow Pit Coffer and The Peddler of Swaffham in 1968 and 1971 respectively, and she then published Walter and the Balloon with her husband. As well as her usual colour work, she also produced black and white sketches to illustrate Alison Jezard's series of Albert books about a teddy bear. Her most well-known illustrations were for Elisabeth Beresford's The Wombles series of books, first published in 1968 and later adapted into the popular television series. Beresford provided more Womble stories in response to their popularity, and Margaret worked long hours, seven days a week to complete the accompanying illustrations for twenty books. For this reason, after the Wombles, she would only illustrate a book if she was paid a royalty rather than an outright fee. The demand for more Womble books meant additional illustrators were enlisted by the publisher Ernest Benn, but the definitive visual interpretation of the animals was Margaret Gordon's. Gordon's original cover illustration for \\"The Wombles to the Rescue\\" (ink and gouache) In the mid-1980s, she began to both write and illustrate books, including her successful series about a mischievous bear named Wilberforce. She intensely disliked the razzamatazz of the publishing world and was utterly uninterested in its gossip. She was particularly happy to be taken up by Walker books in the last years of her life as she much admired their books. She was a versatile artist and excelled in both black and white line drawings, where she combined detailed backgrounds with cartoon-like simplification of the principal figures, and in coloured work. Original Mousetale Illustration (ink and gouache)  Personal  She was born and brought up in Battersea, London, by her professional musician parents, with her younger brother, the harpsichord tuner John Eastoe, and sister Jane Eastoe. She claimed this gave her an artistic temperament but ensured she did not take up music as a career. She met Giles Gordon in a publishing house when she was touting her portfolio of illustrations around publishers. She was married to him from 1964 to 1987, when she left him and moved to Oundle, Northamptonshire, to be near her sister. She said she should have left him years earlier when he published thinly veiled accounts of their marriage as novels. In Oundle she began a new relationship and had the \\"Happiest months of my life,\\" before her untimely death from Bronchopneumonia and Dermatomyosistis. She died aged 50 on 31 December 1989 and is survived by her children Callum Gordon and Hattie Gordon. Her son Gareth Gordon committed suicide in 1994.

Neurons from the medulla project to the nucleus centralis and the nucleus ventrolateralis in the torus semicircularis, providing afferent auditory and hydrodynamic information. Research suggests that these nuclei interact with each other, suggesting that this area of the brain is bimodally sensitive. In the Gymnotiform fish, which are weakly electric fish, the torus semicircularis was observed to exhibit laminar organization. It receives afferent input, specifically electrosensory, mechanical, and auditory stimuli. In frogs, researchers have studied how neurons in the torus semicircularis prefer certain characteristics of sound differentially. Single neurons fire selectively based on the auditory parameters of a stimulus. Functionally, this can allow members of a species to distinguish whether a call is of the same (conspecific) or a different species. This has been observed to play a role in mate selection. In the Tungara frog, which produces a species-specific mating call, scientists studied responses in the laminar nucleus of the torus semicircularis to various parts of the call. They came to the conclusion that this part of the brain acts as a feature detector (a neuron/neurons that respond to a certain feature of a stimulus) for the parts of the auditory stimulus that are conspecific. From an evolutionary standpoint, research has been conducted in turtles to connect the distribution of calcium-binding proteins in the torus semicircularis among birds and mammals to a common reptile predecessor.

Early life 1664 painting of New Amsterdam, by Johannes Vingboons, painted in the year Nicolls came to America. Nicoll was born in the village of Islip, Northamptonshire, in 1657. He was the son of Abigail (n√©e Johns) Nicoll and Matthias Nicoll, who served as the 6th Mayor of New York City from 1672 to 1673. His sister, Margaret Nicoll, was married to Col. Richard Floyd Jr., the colonel of provincial troops of Suffolk County and judge of the Court of Common Pleas and grandfather of William Floyd. Nicoll came to America in 1664 with his father and Richard Nicolls, the 1st Colonial governor of the Province of New York. His father, Richard's secretary and reportedly also his nephew, was present for the Peter Stuyvesant's surrender of Dutch New Amsterdam to the English. William was educated by his father and studied law with him. When Edmund Andros returned to England in 1681 to receive a knighthood, William went with him, served in the English Army and saw active service in Flanders. Career After returning to America, Nicoll was admitted to the bar and was appointed Clerk of Queens County and in 1683, he became Register of the Court of Admiralty. On April 11, 1687, he was appointed Attorney General of the Province of New York. He held this office for only a year due to James II annexation of New York to the Dominion of New England on May 7, 1688. Nicoll was vehemently opposed the Leisler Rebellion (May 1689 to March 1691) and refused to surrender his commission as Justice of the Peace, therefore, Jacob Leisler imprisoned him. Nicoll was jailed for 14 months until March 1691 when Governor Henry Sloughter arrived from New York and squashed the rebellion. Upon his release from prison, Nicoll was appointed to the Governor's Council and named King's Counsel during Leisler's Treason Trial. In 1695, the Assembly sent Nicoll and Chidley Brooke, a fellow Council member, to London to urge the English government to require the other English colonies to help pay for a force to defend against the French. While traveling, Nicoll and Brooke were captured by French privateers, robbed, and he was again imprisoned, this time in St. Malo. He was eventually released and in 1701, he was elected as a member of the New York General Assembly, representing Suffolk County, serving until his death in 1723. From October 20, 1702 until May 27, 1718, when he resigned due to ill health, he also served as the Speaker of the Assembly. Personal life On November 29, 1683, Governor Thomas Dongan granted Nicoll a royal patent of 50,000 acres on the Long Island. In later years, received further land grants and his manor became the largest on Long Island totaling . In 1701, he built a mansion on the Great South Bay in present-day Islip, New York in honor of his birthplace in England. In 1718, Nicoll sold his father's estate, Plandome Manor, then over 1,000 acres. The manor house on his father's estate was torn down in 1998 by its new owner. Nicoll was married to Anna van Rensselaer (1665-1723). She was the widow of the patroon Kiliaen van Rensselaer, and the daughter of Jeremias van Rensselaer and Maria (n√©e Van Cortlandt) Van Rensselaer. Among her large family were uncles Stephanus Van Cortlandt and Jacobus Van Cortlandt, both of whom served as mayor of New York City. Together, William and Anna were the parents of: * Mary Nicoll (b. 1689), who married Scottish immigrant Robert Watts (1678‚Äì1750). * Benjamin Nicoll (1694‚Äì1724), who married his cousin, Charity Floyd (1692‚Äì1758).

Nicoll died at his home, the manor of Islip Grange, on November 20, 1723. =Descendants= As William Nicoll Jr. died unmarried and without issue, the Nicoll estate was inherited by William's grandson, William Nicoll III (d. 1778), the eldest son of Benjamin, who became the third family member to be elected to the General Assembly where he served from 1768 until 1769. Through his daughter Mary, he was the grandfather of John Watts, himself the father of U.S. Representative John Watts.

The Council confirmed the deposition of former Patriarch Ignatius of Constantinople, and his replacement by Photios. Several dogmatic, ecclesiological and liturgical questions were also discussed, and seventeen canons were produced. Decisions of the Council were initially approved by papal legates, but their approval was later annulled by the Pope. In spite of that, the Council is considered as valid by the Eastern Orthodox Church. History Representation of Jesus Christ on the golden solidus of Byzantine Emperor Michael III (842-867) In 860, Byzantine Emperor Michael III (842-867) and Patriarch Photios I of Constantinople decided to convene a major church council in order to resolve several doctrinal, ecclesiological and liturgical questions. They approached Pope Nicholas I (858-867), who decided to send his representatives to the Council. Papal legates, bishops Radoald of Porto and Zachary of Anagni, were well-received in Constantinople, and soon upon their arrival the Council was convened in the spring of 861. Among major issues discussed at the Council, the most significant were various questions regarding earlier (858) deposition of former Patriarch Ignatius of Constantinople, and in connection with that the questions regarding canonical validity of appointment and speedy promotion of his successor, Patriarch Photios. After extensive deliberation, the Council confirmed the validity of earlier deposition of Ignatius and election of Photios. Such conclusions were also approved by papal legates at the Council, but their approval was later (863) annulled by the Pope.

It is set in the Arrowverse, sharing continuity with the other television series of the universe, and is a spin-off of Arrow. The episode was written by Todd Helbing and Lauren Certo, directed by Tom Cavanagh, and is the series' 100th episode. Grant Gustin stars as Barry, and is joined by principal cast members Candice Patton, Danielle Panabaker, Carlos Valdes, Hartley Sawyer, Danielle Nicolet, Jessica Parker Kennedy, Chris Klein, Cavanagh, and Jesse L. Martin. The episode sees Barry and his daughter Nora travel back in time and take a trip down memory lane where they cross paths with several of the show's past speedsters in order to gather some key necessities to stop Cicada. Several recurring guest stars make appearances, including Michelle Harrison, John Wesley Shipp, Teddy Sears, and Tony Todd. Shipp also reprises his role as Barry Allen / Flash from the 1990 television series in a pre- credits scene that ties-in with the Arrowverse crossover \\"Elseworlds\\". \\"What's Past Is Prologue\\" originally aired on The CW on December 4, 2018, and was watched by 1.78 million viewers according to Nielsen Media Research. The episode received a positive critical response. Plot Barry Allen and Nora West-Allen travel back in time to gather several items to create a power dampener to stop Cicada: a highly magnetic alloy from Savitar's armor, Harry Wells' Speed Force transmitter, and dark matter. They first travel to Barry's final battle against Savitar and, despite the intervention of a Time Wraith, manage to retrieve a piece of the armor. They next travel to when Hunter Zolomon stole Barry's speed with the transmitter, which Barry obtains from Harry. As Barry and Nora attempt to travel back to the night of the particle accelerator explosion, Zolomon discovers them and gives chase before being stopped by a Time Wraith, causing Barry and Nora to land on the day that Barry's 2016 self went back in order to get faster instead. Nora convinces a reluctant Barry to ask Eobard Thawne for help in repairing the transmitter, which was damaged during their landing. Thawne ultimately fixes the transmitter after Barry threatens to disrupt his plans. Barry and Nora travel to the night that the particle accelerator exploded to collect the dark matter released and complete the power dampener. Barry reveals to Nora that Thawne killed his mother, and they subsequently hide the dampener inside a hospital's pillar before returning to the present day so they can confront Cicada there. Cisco Ramon separates Cicada from his dagger with the dampener only for the latter to re-summon it. As Cicada prepares to kill Barry, Caitlin Snow transforms into Killer Frost and subdues him, forcing him to flee. Meanwhile, Sherloque Wells continues to investigate Nora's true intentions for being in 2018 by translating the strange symbols in her journal, which Nora claims that she created in order to keep track of changes to the timeline. Sherloque returns the journal but hides an already deciphered message that reads, \\"The timeline is malleable.\\" Later, Nora travels to Iron Heights Penitentiary in 2049 to confront Thawne, whom she has secretly been sending her journal entries to. In a pre-credits scene, the Flash of Earth-90 fails to stop a mysterious individual from using a powerful book to destroy his universe and is forced to run. Production =Development and writing= At the 2018 San Diego Comic-Con, it was announced that the eighth episode of The Flashs fifth season and the series' 100th episode would not be taking place during the annual Arrowverse crossover event like had been the case with the previous seasons' eighth episodes. The Arrowverse showrunners \\"flipflopped\\" the placement of the crossover in order to make the milestone 100th episode separate, with the ninth episode being part of the crossover instead. Cast member Tom Cavanagh was also revealed to be directing the episode. Executive producer and showrunner Todd Helbing said the episode will act as a sort of midseason finale and be \\"a little bit different,\\" with \\"a big twist to carry us over\\". Ahead of the premiere of the fifth season, Helbing explained that \\"[they] wanted to do something special\\" for the episode by \\"taking the audience on a trip to remind everybody of all the cool stuff we've done for five years now. We wanted to relive the coolest moments on our show, so we came up this concept and it both honors what we've done so far and also propels the show for the rest of the season.\\" Cast member Candice Patton also commented that the episode \\"kind of really revisits what makes our show special\\" and \\"there are a lot of special things happening in [the] episode\\". At the end of October 2018, Tony Todd, who voiced Zoom in the second season, revealed the episode would feature \\"all the [past] speedster villains\\" returning \\"wanting a piece of Barry\\". In mid-November 2018, The CW announced that the episode was titled \\"What's Past is Prologue\\", written by Helbing and Lauren Certo, and released the synopsis revealing that Barry and Nora would be travelling back in time to \\"gather some key necessities\\" to stop Cicada. The episode's title was taken from a line in William Shakespeares play The Tempest. Two weeks later, Jessica Parker Kennedy revealed that in the episode Nora gets to see a special moment between her mom and dad \\"that like really breaks her heart\\". Patton added, \\"She gets to see Barry and Iris as we've known to love them over the past four seasons,\\" with Parker Kennedy concluding that \\"the episode really brings the three of them closer.\\" Grant Gustin said the episode \\"felt like Back to the Future style time travel, seeing ourselves see ourselves in these other moments through a new lens. It was really cool.\\" =Casting= Main cast members Grant Gustin, Candice Patton, Danielle Panabaker, Carlos Valdes, Hartley Sawyer, Danielle Nicolet, Jessica Parker Kennedy, Chris Klein, Tom Cavanagh, and Jesse L. Martin appear in the episode as Barry Allen / Flash, Iris West-Allen, Caitlin Snow / Killer Frost, Cisco Ramon / Vibe, Ralph Dibny / Elongated Man, Cecile Horton, Nora West-Allen / XS, Orlin Dwyer / Cicada, Sherloque Wells and Joe West, respectively. Cavanagh also plays Harry Wells of Earth-2 and Eobard Thawne / Reverse-Flash. Martin appears in the episode only in archived footage due to a back injury he sustained prior to the start of filming of the season. LaMonica Garrett as Mar Novu / Monitor and John Wesley Shipp as Barry Allen / Flash from the 1990 television series appear in a pre-credits scene. =Filming= Filming of the episode began on September 26, 2018, and concluded by early October. Gustin thought it was great that they were able to have Cavanagh direct the episode, saying \\"[Cavanagh] took such good care; he understands the journey... we've found a lot of details that probably wouldn't have been found otherwise.\\" = Arrowverse tie-ins= In November 2018, it was revealed that the eighth episodes of The Flash, Arrow, and Supergirl would feature \\"puzzling events\\" that lead to the events of the annual Arrowverse crossover event, titled \\"Elseworlds\\". A pre-credits scene teasing the events of crossover aired at the end of The Flashs \\"What's Past Is Prologue\\", Arrows \\"Unmasked\\", and Supergirls \\"Bunker Hill\\". The scene also confirmed Earth-90 as the earth for the Flash from the 1990 television series. Marc Guggenheim, who acted as the showrunner for the crossover, felt the tease was \\"cool because we‚Äôve never... setup the crossover in the previous episodes before.\\" The tease was meant to be one of two options for the \\"Elseworlds\\" cold opening. The writers could not choose which they wanted to use, with Guggenheim explaining someone decided to \\"take one cold open, move that and make that the post-credit tag, like the way The Flash typically does, at the end of all three shows, and then have the other cold open at the beginning of hour one.\\" Supergirl co-showrunner Robert Rovner added that the tease was only supposed to air with The Flashs eighth episode, before being added to the other two episodes to make things easier for viewers since they \\"are coming to [the crossover] from our separate shows and we wanted something that [connects them together].\\" Release \\"What's Past is Prologue\\" was first aired in the United States on The CW on December 4, 2018. It became available for streaming on Netflix in Canada on December 6, 2018, while it was first aired in the United Kingdom on Sky One on December 6, as well. Reception =Ratings= In the United States, the episode received a 0.7/3 percent share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, meaning that it was seen by 0.7 percent of all households, and 3 percent of all of those watching television at the time of the broadcast. It was watched by 1.78 million viewers. The episode improved 17% in the 18‚Äì49 rating on the previous episode, \\"O Come, All Ye Thankful\\". The episode attracted a total of 644,700 viewers within seven-days of its British premiere, making it the most watched programme on Sky One for the week. =Critical response= The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 93% approval rating for the episode, based on 14 reviews, with an average rating of 8.31/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"'What's Past is Prologue' takes viewers on a Flash- tastic journey back in time with a series of flashbacks that make for an eventful, charming, and commemorative 100th episode.\\" Jesse Schedeen of IGN gave the episode a rating of 6.7/10, with the verdict being \\"As exciting as it is to see The Flash celebrate its 100th episode, [it] didn't fully realize its potential. The time travel premise worked whenever the focus remained on Harrison Wells, but too much of this material played out as if Barry and Nora were watching a clip show of past seasons.\\"  Notes  References External links  Category:2018 American television episodes Category:The Flash (2014 TV series) episodes Category:Television episodes about time travel ","title":"What's Past Is Prologue (The Flash)"},{"id":"58586457","text":"Lugonjo is a neighborhood in Entebbe Municipality, Busiro County, Wakiso District, in the Buganda Region of Uganda.

Johnson was a well-known and respected entrepreneur, noted for his successful ranching operation that spanned a large area of central Oklahoma, including parts of what would eventually become Oklahoma City.  Family Background  Montford Johnson's father, Charles \\"Boggy\\" Johnson, was an English Shakespearean actor. Charles Johnson came to the United States with his brother when he was 19 years old and traveled in the South with a theater production... Charles Johnson married Chickasaw citizen Rebekah Courtney Johnson, Montford's mother. She was half Chickasaw and half Scottish. After marrying, Rebekah and Charles migrated with the Chickasaws to Indian Territory during the Chickasaw Removal.... Charles received his nickname, ‚ÄúBoggy,‚Äù while on the [Removal trail]. After crossing the [Mississippi River], the Chickasaws found themselves mired in the marshes and swamps of Arkansas. Charles, using a technique learned while growing up in England, organized men into groups to cut down saplings and lay them along the route, thereby allowing the livestock and wagons to pass through the quagmires. By assisting them with getting through this boggy country, Chickasaws gave Charles the name \\"Boggy.\\" Once in Indian Territory, Boggy and Rebekah built their home north of Tishomingo, near present-day Connerville, Oklahoma  Early life  Montford was born in November 1843, about two years after his older sister, Adelaide. A few months after he was born, his mother became ill with pneumonia and died. Boggy, distraught by his wife's passing, decided to take the children and return east. As it was customary for Chickasaw families to take in motherless children and raise them as their own, Boggy's Chickasaw in-laws insisted on raising the children. Boggy left without Adelaide and Montford, leaving them in the care of their grandmother, Sallie Tarntubby. Montford grew up with his grandmother's family, learning Chickasaw traditions and how to take care of livestock. Montford and Adelaide both attended school, Adelaide at Bloomfield Academy and Montford at Chickasaw Manual Labor Academy. There, Montford learned farming techniques necessary to yield successful crops. Montford and Adelaide lived under the care of their grandmother Sallie until her death in 1858. At the end of that school year, they moved to the home of their next nearest relative, Sallie's half-brother, U.S. Army Captain Townsend Hothliche. He was stationed at Fort Arbuckle, and had a house nearby on the South Bank of the Washita River. On a trip to Fort Arbuckle, Adelaide befriended the Campbell family, who were living at the fort. The Campbells moved to Indian Territory when the father, a U.S. Army Sergeant, was transferred to Fort Arbuckle, near present-day Davis, Oklahoma. Adelaide fell in love with and married Micheal Campbell, one of Sergeant Campbell's sons.  Civil War Years  The outbreak of the Civil War forced major changes in Indian Territory and affected Montford and his family as well. The Union Army evacuated Indian Territory to Kansas, allowing Confederate troops from Texas to occupy many of the forts in the territory. The Chickasaws sided with the Confederates and also supplied their own troops to maintain order and defense. Michael Campbell joined the Chickasaw battalion as a Major and spent much of the war away from home or stationed at Fort Arbuckle. Montford oversaw the duties of the homestead and worked as a partner with Michael. It was during this time that Montford met and fell in love with Adelaide's sister-in-law, Mary. In the fall of 1862, they were married. A year later, Edward Bryant Johnson (E.B.), Montford's first child, was born. In 1864, Michael was stationed at Fort Arbuckle and regularly made the trip home in the evening to spend the night. The trip required several crossings over the Washita River, which was a dangerous endeavor. One evening, on the way home, Michael was swept away in the current and drowned, leaving Adelaide widowed with their small son and unborn daughter. At 22 years old, Montford became the head of the homestead, including his sister's young family. In July 1865, the Chickasaws were officially the last Confederate tribe to surrender, marking the end of the United States' greatest tragedy. The Chickasaw Nation was devastated. Schools had been converted to barracks or hospitals and would not be returned to teaching until the 1870s. Confederate debts incurred during the war were worthless, leaving the Chickasaws largely impoverished.  Johnson Starts Ranching  With Montford in charge of the homestead, he set to work getting the ranch business in order. First, he purchased branding rights from his relatives. Second, he made an agreement with the men of the neighboring farms to round up cattle that had been set loose in the mountains during the war so they would not be taken by warring armies. Montford offered to pay for each of the cattle he found in the mountains, and any unbranded cattle would be his outright. While rounding up cattle, Montford noticed the wild cattle desired salt. Using salt licks, he devised pen-traps that allowed cattle to enter but did not allow them to escape. This greatly increased the number of cattle Montford was able to corral with relatively little effort. Around this time, Montford hosted his friend Jesse Chisholm on a buffalo hunt on the western range of Chickasaw territory, south of present-day Norman, Oklahoma. At that time, the area was largely undeveloped, and Montford thought it would be perfect to range cattle there. Jesse Chisholm suggested Montford negotiate agreements with the tribes indigenous to the area. With Chisholm's help, Montford was able to make a deal with the tribes that allowed him to use the land as long as he did not hire white men as ranch hands. Montford began his first ranch in the spring of 1868, taking a team of men to [Walnut Creek], the same location of the buffalo hunt. Montford placed ranch hand Jack Brown in charge of the Walnut Creek Ranch. As payment for his services, Jack received every fourth calf born on the ranch, making Jack Brown possibly the first sharecropper of Oklahoma. By fall 1869, Montford moved his family to a new homestead at the site of Camp Arbuckle. Montford began farming a 50-acre plot in 1870. He used the practice of burning fields to rid the land of old growth, as well as to prevent diseases and ticks. Montford used the burn technique his entire life.  Johnson Establishes Additional Ranches  Around 1870, cattlemen from [Texas] stopped using the Shawnee Trail and began driving their herds to Kansas on the Western Shawnee Trail, what would become the Chisholm Trail. In 1870, Montford's sister, Adelaide, married her second husband, Jim Bond, a trader and stockman. Montford settled his business with her (which was started while he oversaw her homestead during the war), giving her 15 cows and calves and several steers, worth approximately $1,100 at that time. Montford was pressed by distant relative Chub Moore to take in several orphans. He agreed, taking in seven children, two of whom were almost adults. To lessen the burden of adopting so many children, Adelaide agreed to take two of them, and Granny Vicey Harmon (a family friend and Chickasaw) agreed to take three of the children. Montford and Mary took in the last two and Chub Moore. Granny Vicey Harmon had lived with her Cherokee husband, Sampson Harmon, about 10 miles west of the Camp Arbuckle ranch until his death, after which she requested that Montford assist her to take over Jesse Chisholm's trade post at Council Grove, in present-day Oklahoma City. Montford declined to help her with the trading post, but eventually convinced her to take charge of a new ranch at Council Grove, making her the first permanent resident of the Oklahoma City metro area. In the spring of 1874, Charley Campbell, a brother of Adelaide's late husband, became a partner of Montford's and took over the Walnut Creek Ranch.  Boggy Johnson Returns  In the summer of 1877, Montford received a letter from his estranged father. They arranged to meet at a hotel in Denison, Texas. The men spent two days catching up and telling their respective stories, though Montford found it odd that Boggy had not been able to contact them up to that point. The visit did offer an important opportunity for Montford. There were a number of Native Americans captured in the Red River War that had been taken from Fort Sill to Fort Marion in St. Augustine, Florida. The conditions of the 300-year-old fort were poor. Boggy claimed to have many friends in Washington D.C., and Montford thought a trip to St. Augustine might prompt Boggy to ask those friends to help improve conditions for the prisoners. Boggy contacted Montford the following summer, and they planned to meet in Jacksonville, Florida. Montford was accompanied by Charley Campbell and his son, E.B. They rode to Atoka, Oklahoma, and boarded the train. For E.B., it was his first train ride, and he was anxious on the first leg of the journey, convinced that they would crash. When they arrived in Jacksonville, E.B. met his grandfather for the first time. The following morning, they went by boat to St. Augustine and to the fort. There, they found the condition of the Native Americans to be poor. Montford received permission from Capt. Pratt to host a barbecue for the prisoners, and sent E.B. to find a cow for the feast. After finding a cow, E.B. had a butcher prepare and bring the beef to the fort. The prisoners were especially grateful to E.B. for bringing the beef. There was nothing more Montford could do in Florida, but after the trip, Boggy went back to Washington D.C. to work with his contacts.  Montford's Ranching Continues  Montford returned to his ranches and his son, E.B., returned to school in Tishomingo. Montford's Camp Arbuckle homestead was in the vicinity of the growing town of Johnsonville, and Montford became uncomfortable with the more crowded conditions of the area (all lands in Chickasaw territory were held in common, so there were no defined properties). In 1878, Montford worked out a trade with his friend, Caddo Bill Williams, exchanging eight geldings and an old stallion for Williams' ranch east of Snake Creek, near Old Silver City (just north of present-day Tuttle, Oklahoma). After Montford moved his family to Silver City in the fall of 1878, Adelaide and her husband, Jim Bond, moved nearby. They built their own home a couple miles west of the Chisholm Trail on the southern bank of the South Canadian River. Their homestead location was a suitable place for crossing the river, and cattle drivers often stopped at their home for the night. A major problem for Montford during the 1870s and 1880s was the threat posed by Texas cattle being driven north to the Kansas railroads. The Texas Longhorns brought ticks that carried [Texas cattle fever] to Montford's herds. While the Longhorns were immune, Montford's cattle were not, and he had difficulty keeping his herds separated from the Texas herds. In August, 1880, Montford's wife, Mary, became ill with a fever. The doctor at Ft. Reno, 25 miles away, was summoned. He reported that she was suffering from [ergotism]. Mary died on Aug. 27 and was buried in the family burial grounds at Silver City. Upon hearing of her death, Boggy Johnson asked to have E.B. join him in [New York City] to go to school. Montford agreed, and E.B. soon left to join his grandfather. Montford visited E.B. several times in New York City, and on a visit in late 1882, informed his son of his intent to marry his cousin-in- law, [Addie Campbell]. Addie was much younger than Montford, and E.B. objected to the marriage. Montford was unmoved, and E.B. eventually relented. By the 1880s, Montford was grazing his cattle on land between [Pottawatomie] country to the east, the [North Canadian River] to the north, the [Wichita Reservation] to the west and the Washita River to the south. Conflict quickly arose when settlers known as ‚Äú[Boomers]‚Äù made attempts to enter the [Unassigned Lands] prior to the [Indian Appropriations Act of 1889]. They often burned ranch lands in an attempt to remove food for cattle. The ranchers, in turn, built fireguards using [controlled burns]. These fireguards were typically made perpendicular to creeks to reduce the effort required to make effective barriers. The barriers were made by plowing two parallel lines, then burning the grass between the lines, which created a barrier roughly 50 yards wide. Creating the fireguards was dangerous, as the fires could quickly turn against the ranchers if the wind shifted toward them.  Edward Bryant Takes Over Montford's Business Affairs  E.B. returned from New York in February 1885 and immediately set to work getting Montford's businesses in order. Montford was a generous man, having allowed numerous lines of credit through his store in Silver City. Montford had also invested $25,000 in the New York City liquor business Boggy Johnson was involved in, which never produced a profit. Montford offered E.B. a 50 percent share of the Silver City store, and he set out to collect some of the overdue bills, which amounted to approximately $15,000. E.B. collected cash and livestock as payments for the various debts owed to the Silver City store E.B.'s actions made Montford's business partners uneasy, and they decided to end their partnerships. E.B. assisted closing out business with their partners, which included Jim Bond, Montford's brother-in-law. Montford and E.B. continued ranching despite continued encroachment by Boomers. New ranches were being established along Montford's periphery, creating sometimes dangerous situations. Occasionally, they would find cattle that had their brand covered up by a new brand, an obvious sign that cattle had been stolen. On one occasion, Montford and E.B. were fired upon after one of their men, [Adam Ward], was shot in a dispute over a steer. There were numerous similar incidents in which ranchers were killed in arguments over cattle ownership.  Land Rush of 1889  In the spring of 1889, the Indian Appropriations Act of 1889 stated that 1.8 million acres of the Unassigned Lands were to be opened up to settlement for claimants, in what became known as the Land Rush of 1889. Some of Montford's holdings were in this region, but this occasion had been foreseen. In preparation for the land rush, the Army ordered all cattlemen to remove their livestock from Oklahoma Territory. E.B. gathered some men and began herding his cattle back into the Chickasaw Nation. During this cattle drive, the herd and several of E.B.'s men were captured by a group of soldiers and were to be taken to Fort Reno. E.B. caught up to the herd and forced the soldiers to retreat. After a while, a large group of cavalry placed the entire group under arrest. E.B. and his men were taken to the fort, where he discussed the issue with fort authorities. They decided the soldiers had acted on contradictory orders. E.B. was able to gather the herd and they departed, making it to Chickasaw Nation lands the morning of April 22, just hours before the rush was to begin  Late Life  With the land run, as well as the new barbed wire fencing-in of the prairie, Montford and the family had defined areas of land they controlled. Despite these major changes, they continued the business as usual. The dramatic increase in population also meant towns were growing. Montford, along with friends and family, soon became founders of several banks in Chickasha and Minco, Oklahoma Montford remained primarily interested in ranching and continued to seek new lands to graze his livestock. He established a lease agreement with the Kiowa, Comanche and Wichita tribes. The lease proved to be a difficult agreement. Inconsistent positions of the federal government concerning leasing of Indian lands as well as cattle rustling made the lease a failed venture. After two years of trying to succeed on the lands amid legal battles and significant livestock losses, Montford consolidated his herd back to his ranches that were clearly inside the Chickasaw Nation. Montford attempted to recover his losses from the federal government, but never received compensation In November 1893, the Dawes Commission was formally established, with the intent of allotting the Chickasaw Nation lands into holdings owned by individual Chickasaws. Montford considered the commission to be a treachery, especially after their apparent stonewalling over his losses in the leased district. Most distressing was the fact the commission's proposals forbade Chickasaws from purchasing more land than was allotted, though white settlers were not restricted from purchasing as much land as they pleased. Despite much protest from the Chickasaw and Choctaw Nations, the Commission persisted.  Death  Montford suffered from poor health for many years, including malaria. He made several trips to Eureka Springs, Arkansas, and took various medicines to try to alleviate some of his ailments. In the winter of 1895-1896, Montford suffered from numerous ailments at once, and after being bed-ridden for several months, died on Monday, February 17, 1896. The following day, every business in Minco closed to show their respects, and the headline of the February 21 issue of the Minco newspaper read \\"A Good Citizen Gone.\\" He was 52 years old. Montford was buried in the Silver City cemetery with his first wife, Mary. E.B. took over his father's affairs and looked after his numerous younger siblings, most of whom were still children. Addie, Montford's widow, died in 1905, and E.B. arranged for her to be buried next to Montford.

(Similar in color to EA 34.) (high-resolution expandable photo) Amarna letter EA 34, titled: \\"The Pharaoh's Reproach Answered\\"Moran, William L. 1987, 1992. The Amarna Letters. EA 34, \\"The Pharaoh's Reproach Answered\\", pp. 105-107. is a moderately tall clay tablet Amarna letter from the King of Alashiya. (See here: ) Besides a complicated story line to EA 34, the letter is shown to be in Very Good condition. It is a bright color, and the cuneiform is finely inscribed. The scribe has some distinct techniques: clarity of the cuneiform; because of a listing, use of non-common cuneiform; a technique with \\"7 and 7 times\\" that is non-standard; and some specific signs that are also artful (i.e. the simple multiple use of \\"tug2\\" (t√∫g)), which is used for types of clothing. Besides the interesting use of two verticals for ka4 (100x24px), see as: ( 100x24px100x24px ), \\"tug2\\" (t√∫g)) is distinctive, in the Gift Listing, because in a grouping of more uncommon-use cuneiform, \\"tug2\\" is dramaltically simple. It is similar to this (100x24px), when the added second horizontal up-stroke is added (like an open \\"pair of scissors\\"). \\"Tug2\\" (t√∫g) is found on the Obverse, lines: 22, 23, and 25; six times. It is found once on the tablet Reverse, line 47. EA 34 is numbered 29789 in the British Museum. The Amarna letters, about 300, numbered up to EA 382, are a mid 14th century BC, about 1360 BC and 20‚Äì30 years later, correspondence.

He was a member of the Tasmanian House of Assembly from 1903 to 1906, representing the electorate of New Norfolk. Brown was born in Hobart, later moving to New Norfolk to work for businessman Thomas Allwright. He then established his own successful general store and orchard there, operating it until his retirement. He was a member of the New Norfolk Municipal Council, a justice of the peace, chairman and treasurer of the road trust, and a trustee of the Methodist Church. He was also a co-founder of the New Norfolk Masonic and Oddfellows' Lodges, and was involved in the foundation of the Tasmanian Fruitgrowers' Association. He was elected to the House of Assembly at the 1903 election, having been endorsed in his campaign by the Reform League. He defeated long-serving New Norfolk MP George Leatham, who he had previously unsuccessfully challenged in 1893 and 1900. He was defeated by Leatham at the 1906 election. Brown initiated a petition challenging the result in April 1906, which led to Leatham agreeing to resign and cause a by-election if Brown discontinued legal proceedings. Leatham then defeated Brown in the resulting by-election in June. He was seriously injured in a coach accident on 18 December 1906. He suffered permanent damage to his ankle, and sued the proprietor of the coach line in the Supreme Court of Tasmania in late 1907, but was unsuccessful.

History The M1877 was first designed and produced by the Obukhov State Plant in Saint Petersburg and was fairly conventional for its time and most nations had similar guns with similar roles such as the Mortier de 220 mm mod√®le 1880 or Mortaio da 210/8 D.S. Design The M1877 was a short barreled breech-loading mortar. The barrel was a typical built-up gun of the period with reinforcing hoops which was built from cast iron and steel. The mortar had an early form of Krupp horizontal sliding-block breech and it fired separate-loading, bagged charges and projectiles. There were also two other similar and mortars that were also designed in 1877. =Coastal Defense= In the coastal defense role, the M1877's theory of operation was that a low-velocity mortar firing a large shell at a high-angle was more likely to destroy an enemy ship by penetrating its thin deck armor than a high-velocity low-angle naval gun attempting to penetrate its thicker belt armor. The downside was that high-angle indirect fire was harder to aim correctly so more mortars would be needed to defend an area from attack. However, if the area was constrained by geography like a port at the mouth of a river the navigation channels could be measured ahead of time and firing ranges calculated. A complicating factor was as naval artillery progressed their size and range soon eclipsed the mortar's range. In the coastal defense role, the M1877 was mounted on a garrison mount which sat on a concrete slab behind a parapet. The mount consisted of a rectangular steel firing platform with a pivot at the front and two wheels at the rear to give a limited amount of traverse. The recoil system for the M1877 consisted of a U shaped gun cradle which held the trunnioned barrel and a slightly inclined firing platform with a hydro-gravity recoil system. When the gun fired the hydraulic buffers under the front slowed the recoil of the cradle which slid up a set of inclined rails on the firing platform and then returned the gun to position by the combined action of the buffers and gravity. These garrison mounts were used in both the coastal defense and fortress gun roles. =Fortress Gun= In addition to its coastal defense role, the M1877 was also used as a fortress gun. The theory of operation was that a heavy mortar would be useful to defend forts because its large shell and high angle fire could destroy an enemies assault trenches during siege operations. The heavy shell and high angle fire would also be useful for counter-battery fire against enemy siege artillery. =Siege Gun= Another role for the M1877 was as a siege gun. The M1877 was designed with the lessons of the Franco-Prussian and Russo-Turkish war in mind where field guns with smaller shells and limited elevation had difficulty overcoming fortifications. What was needed was a mortar capable of high-angle fire which could fire a large shell to drop inside the walls of enemy fortifications to destroy enemy gun emplacements, command posts and magazines. In the siege gun role, the gun cradle could be removed from its garrison mount and an axle with two wooden spoked wheels could be attached to the front. The rear of the cradle could then be hooked up to a limber so the mortar could be towed by a horse team or artillery tractor. To facilitate towing on soft ground the wheels were often fitted with Bonagente grousers patented by the Italian major Crispino Bonagente. These consisted of twelve rectangular plates connected with elastic links and are visible in many photographs of World War I artillery from all of the combatants. Once on site the axle could be removed and a set of small wheels could be fit to the front of the cradle. A piece of ground could then be leveled and a wooden firing platform assembled and the mortar placed on the firing platform. The firing platform had an external recoil mechanism which connected to a steel eye on the firing platform and a hook on the gun cradle between the wheels. Lastly, a set of wooden ramps were placed behind the wheels and when the gun fired the wheels rolled up the ramp and was returned to position by a combination of the buffers and gravity. However, there was no traversing mechanism and the gun had to be levered into position to aim. A drawback of this system was the gun had to be re-aimed each time which lowered the rate of fire. World War I The majority of military planners before the First World War were wedded to the concept of fighting an offensive war of rapid maneuver which in a time before mechanization meant a focus on cavalry and light horse artillery firing shrapnel shells. Unlike the Western Front which quickly degenerated into Trench Warfare the Eastern Front remained fluid and large swathes of territory were won and lost because the length of the front and the sparseness of transport networks presented an open flank. Although the majority of combatants had heavy field artillery prior to the outbreak of the First World War, none had adequate numbers of heavy guns in service, nor had they foreseen the growing importance of heavy artillery. Since aircraft of the period were not yet capable of carrying large diameter bombs the burden of delivering heavy firepower fell on the artillery. The majority of combatants scrambled to find anything that could fire a heavy shell and that meant emptying the fortresses and scouring the arms depots for guns held in reserve. It was under these conditions that M1877's in fortresses in European Russia were sent to the front in order to support Russian armies assaulting German and Austro-Hungarian frontier fortresses. However, due to a string of Russian defeats in the first year of the war, a number of M1877's were captured by the Germans. In 1916 the Germans transferred twenty M1877's to the Western Front where they were assigned to heavy artillery battalions of the army and these soldiered on in declining numbers until the end of the war. In German service the mortars had better range due to more efficient smokeless powder and more aerodynamic German projectiles.

Frances was born in Bangor, Maine, to British mining engineer Colonel Charles Duff (d. circa 1920) and his wife Sarah Robinson (d. 1934), a native of Bangor who, after the couple separated, moved to Chicago and later to Paris, becoming a noted opera singer and singing teacher under the name Sarah Robinson-Duff; her first pupil was future opera star Mary Garden. From an early age, Frances wanted to teach dramatic arts, but her mother insisted that she first gain experience in the craft of acting. After being instructed in the Delsarte system by a drama teacher in Chicago, Frances was invited to join the touring company of famed Shakespearean actress Julia Marlowe. In 1898 she made her Broadway debut with Miss Marlowe at the Knickerbocker Theatre in New York, and subsequently appeared in numerous productions in New York and London. After eleven years of acting, she joined her mother in Paris, where they enjoyed the company of performers and composers such as Enrico Caruso, Sarah Bernhardt and Camille Saint-Saens. Frances began her teaching career in Paris, and during World War I, she volunteered her services to teach wounded soldiers how to regain the use of damaged lungs. Shortly after the end of the war, mother and daughter moved to New York City, where Frances established herself as a leading voice teacher, whose many famous pupils included Mary McCormic, Dorothy Gish, Helen Hayes, Kenneth MacKenna, Catherine Calvert, Ina Claire, Miriam Hopkins, Ruth Chatterton, Mary Pickford, Clark Gable, Norma Shearer, and Katharine Hepburn. The Robinson-Duff approach to voice training involved elaborate vocal and breathing exercises focused on the use of the diaphragm, a method humorously recounted by Hepburn (who never mastered it) in her autobiography, Me: Stories of My Life (1991).

Islands such as Saipan show a variety of rock types including volcanic rocks, breccia, tuff, conglomerate, sandstone, clay and extensive limestones. Geologic History, Stratigraphy & Tectonics The bulk of geological research in the Northern Mariana Islands has focused on the large, populous island of Saipan. The U.S. Geological Survey first mapped the island in 1956 and it was remapped again in 2007. The oldest rocks exposed at the surface are Eocene volcanic rocks, belonging to the Izu-Bonin-Mariana (IBM) arc system. Saipan is on the frontal arc of the system and experienced periodic uplift and subsidence since then. Volcaniclastic and carbonate rocks overly the IBM volcanics. The Sankakuyama Formation is the oldest individual rock unit, which includes Eocene rhyolite found mainly on north-central part of the island. Radiometric dating gives an age of 45 million years ago. During mapping in 1956, it was subdivided into flow rock, breccia, tuff and pyroclastic rocks. Originally called the Hagman andesite by R. Tayama during initial research efforts in 1938, the Hagman Formation is exposed as cliffs along the Hagman Peninsula and deposited during the early development of the Mariana fore arc. The andesite lava flows, conglomerate and sandstone of the unit date to between 26 and 28 million years ago, during the Oligocene. The Densinyama Formation includes andesitic breccia, conglomerate, tuff sandstone and tuff limestone, centered around Mount Talafofo and discontinuously exposed by Achuguo Spring in the west. It overlies the Hagman Formation and is present close to Papago. The Matansa Limestone grades laterally to a pure shallow- marine limestone and like other units shows conflicting results when biostratigraphy and isotope dating are compared. The Tagpochau Limestone is the second most extensive rock unit near the surface on Saipan after the Mariana Limestone. It include a limestone, marl and tuff facies. Calcareous marine tuff and interbedded volcanic flow rocks near the village of As Lito and the Fina Sisu hills was named the Fina-sisu Formation in 1956. The tuff is well bedded with numerous plankton fossils. Geologists have inferred that the rock formed during the Oligocene and is overlain by the Tagpochau Limestone. The Donni Sandstone Member of the Tagpochau Limestone is informally known as the Donni formation. It is exposed near the village of I Donni and throughout the eastern end of the island. The formation overtops the Miocene Tagpochau rocks with an angular unconformity. Talus, marsh sediments and limestones such as the Mariana Limestone are common across the surface, resulting from deposition and mass-wasting during the Pleistocene and Holocene. Structural geology Normal faults are common on the island, particularly the Angingan fault which places Fina-sisu Formation volcanic rocks against younger limestones. Geologists have identified breccia near Mount Tapkpochao as the trace of a normal fault. The Angingan, Obyan and Dago faults may be part of a larger, anastomosing fault system, running on both sides of the central highlands and connecting with faults in the area of Suicide Cliffs and Fanonchuluyan Bay. Most faults trend north-south and even young rocks from the Holocene show signs of offset. https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/ofr20111234 References +Northern Mariana Islands Category:Geography of the Northern Mariana Islands ","title":"Geology of the Northern Mariana Islands"},{"id":"58586887","text":"Jesse February (born 1997) is a South African chess player who holds the title of Woman International Master (WIM, 2016).

Plot  Incipit and first four lines of the Biblioth√®que nationale de France manuscript. Crestiiens is the first word of the first line. King Guillaume and his wife Gratiiene are good Christians. After years of waiting, Gratiiene gets pregnant. While she is heavily pregnant, Guillaume has a vision telling him to go into exile. While in exile, they take shelter in a cave and Gratiiene gives birth to twins. The next day, Guillaume goes out to look for food and comes across a group of merchants. Instead of helping them, they take Gratiiene and the two children with them, leaving Guillaume behind. Guillaume witnesses one of the twins being taken by a wolf. The merchants pursue the wolf, and the child is found miraculously unharmed. Guillaume, however, thinks the child is dead. Guillaume becomes a servant to another merchant. Meanwhile, Gratiiene, traveling with the merchants, meets a valiant knight called Gleolais. Gleolais's wife has died and he has no heir, so he asks Gratiiene to marry him. The story now passes to the two children, called Lovel and Marin, who have been raised by two of the merchants, unaware that they're brothers. They rebel against their 'fathers' (as they believe them to be) and leave. On their travels, they encounter a king who asks them to join his court. Guillaume travels to Bristol, England. When he attempts to leave, his boat is caught in a storm. Guillaume and his helmsman end up at an unknown port. The queen comes down from the castle to inspect their vessel and, upon seeing a ring he's wearing, realizes that he's her husband. Guillaume decides to go hunting but accidentally crosses into an enemy kingdom. Two knights confront him and threaten to kill him. In order to stop them, he tells them he's a king and tells them his story. Upon hearing it, they realize that he's their father and that they are in fact brothers. They're reunited with Gratiiene, their mother.  Authorship  F. J.

The first building was demolished in 1886 and its replacement opened in 1887. History St John's, Halifax Street c. 1875 St John's, Halifax Street c. 1890. The two storey house next door is the Rectory. In 1840 the first Anglican church building, Trinity Church, was erected on North Terrace, Adelaide, but soon demands arose for a second place of worship to cater for members in and around Unley and the foothills, and to that end Osmond Gilles donated to the Church Building Society of South Australia half an acre of his section 581 on Halifax Street near the corner of East Terrace and South Terrace. The location could not have been much further Trinity Church without leaving the city square, and between the two was little more than rough scrub and tracks that became a quagmire in winter. For many years after its establishment it was known colloquially as \\"St John's in the Wilderness\\". On 19 October 1839 the foundation stone was laid by Governor Gawler The foundations had been laid using ‚Ç§540 that had been collected in Adelaide, then for over a year little progress was made due to a shortage of funds. Generous friends in England raised some more and church, which seated around 300, was erected for around ‚Ç§2,100. and the first service was held on 24 October 1841, conducted by the Rev'd James Farrell and the Colonial Chaplain C. B. Howard. The parsonage was a Manning prefabricated cottage brought out by Gilles as his first residence, dubbed \\"Hexagon Cottage\\", which sported a brass door-knocker. Farrell inherited the title of Colonial Chaplain, meaning he had to take over Trinity Church and in December 1843 closed the doors of St John's for services, weddings and baptisms excepted, until a replacement could be found. That man was the Rev'd W. J. Woodcock, who came out on the barque Emu with the Rev. James Pollitt (both reputed Puseyites), and took his first service at St John's on 17 May 1846. In 1848 an organ, built by Samuel Marshall, was installed. In May 1849 Woodcock transferred to the newly completed Christ Church, North Adelaide and Matthew B. Hale, Archdeacon of Adelaide, took over St John's. Hale was followed by a succession of priests, none of whom succeeded in generating much interest, and only one (Rev'd D. J. H. Ibbetson) stayed for any length of time, see list below. The church was lit by gas in 1869. The Rev. F. Slaney Poole was elected in June 1874 and inducted on 4 September. The parish hall was built by John Wark in 1880 to a design of Daniel Garlick; St John's Grammar School opened there and, with additional classrooms, operated until 1942. Poole was also responsible for building the parsonage in 1884 and replacing the original church building, which had been declared unsafe by the City Surveyor. The adjoining block 582 was purchased and the old building demolished in November 1886. The foundation stone of the new building was laid by Bishop Kennion on 14 May 1887 and the structure erected by Walter Rogers to a design by R. G. Holwell at a cost of ¬£3,000. Kennion consecrated the completed church on 6 October 1887 and the first services were held on 9 October 1887. A mission church, St Mary Magdalene's, was built on nearby Moore Street (between Angas and Carrington streets) using material recovered from the old building and opened in 1887. Canon Poole resigned in 1895, and Canon W. S. Hopcraft, from Port Augusta, was appointed in his place. He found the church's finances in a precarious state, with an annual income barely ¬£500, and the church debt of nearly ¬£2,000. During his thirteen years of rectorship he managed to double the church's income and reduce the church debt by nearly ¬£1,000, while spending nearly ¬£2,000 on improvements, notably an organ by Josiah Dodd, which cost ¬£800. It was renovated in 1996 by George Stephens and is highly regarded by enthusiasts. Ministers *James Farrell 24 October 1841 ‚Äì December 1843.

Under federal human resources regulations, career employees at the State Department must be evaluated and managed on the basis of merit. Discrimination based on ethnicity, religion or perceived political beliefs is prohibited. (Political appointees, however, may be selected for their views regarding administration policy.) When an employee who had been inaccurately attacked in a conservative news outlet, her manager, political appointee Brian Hook, refused to help her clear up the inaccurate information and instead removed her from her role. The OIG noted that Brian Hook had sent an email to himself commenting on various career employees with labels such as ‚Äúleaker,‚Äù ‚Äútroublemaker,‚Äù and ‚Äúturncoat.‚Äù While Brechbuhl disputed the report's findings related to the employee's mistreatment, stating that Hook acted appropriately in creating his own team, the OIG concluded that the career employee had been unfairly targeted by Trump administration appointees, and recommended that the State Department should discipline staff members and officials who violated non-discrimination policies. In response, Brechbuhl noted that there is now a department requirement for all political appointees to receive instruction related to required personnel policies and practices. In the meantime, a separate department, United States Office of Special Counsel, with jurisdiction over personnel matters throughout the executive branch, is undertaking its own review of the situation in question.The Wall Street Journal, \\"Career Staffer Was Targeted at State Department for Perceived Political Beliefs,\\" September 14, 2019 Secretary Pompeo Swears in Brian Bulatao as the new Under Secretary of State for Management with Ulrich Brechbuhl looking on =Ukraine controversy= After Ukraine's newly elected President Volodymyr Zelensky was unable to convince President Donald Trump or Vice President Mike Pence to attend his inauguration, Zelensky attended a June 4, 2019 dinner hosted by the United States Ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland.

Benny was sighted several times over the ensuing weeks after his discovery in the Estuary, and appears to be healthy despite appearing alone. As of December 2018, Benny appeared to have taken residence in the estuary, as sightings continued. His continued presence caused the development of the Thames Tunnel to be delayed. Scientists later concluded that the whale departed the Thames Estuary in early 2019. Background While sightings of Belugas have been reported in the temperate waters of the Atlantic Ocean at latitudes similar to that of the UK, the species is normally social, and it is unusual for an individual of the species to be found alone. Beluga sightings in the vicinity of the Thames are especially rare; the most recent appearance of the species in the area was in 1913. Various species of Cetacean have been found in the Thames over the years, the most famous of which being the River Thames whale, a juvenile northern bottlenose whale which entered the Thames in January 2006, and became stranded after travelling as far as Chelsea before dying from complications associated with its stranding. Sightings On 24 September 2018, Benny was first sighted by people near Coalhouse Fort, Essex. Ecologist Dave Andrews reported that it had been feeding near a group of barges, and 'hasn't moved more than 200 metres in either direction.' Sightings continued throughout the day as speculation began to arise as to why the Beluga had chosen to travel to the Estuary. On 25 September 2018, Benny was sighted further inland, off the shore at Gravesend, Kent. Conservationists and biologists feared that the whale may be lost and in danger of becoming stranded if it continued its course west towards London. Later that day, the RSPCA reported that Benny had changed course and was now heading east and appeared to be 'swimming strongly and feeding normally'. The whale is being monitored closely by the RSPCA and the British Divers Marine Life Rescue, while the Port of London Authority advised that boats on the estuary take care to avoid getting too close to the whale. A fibreglass rib operated by the BDMLR kept watch. A sighting on 28 September 2018 revealed that Benny had moved slightly further upstream. It is currently thought that the whale's movements are the result of it travelling around the same area to look for food. That day, BBC News reported that Benny is likely to be a sub- adult, and that medics from the BDMLR had concluded that \\"it had been exhibiting foraging behaviour, likely feeding, as well as surfacing and diving consistent with a healthy animal.\\" On May 13, 2019, local experts concluded that Benny left the estuary.

Early life Isabella Charlotte de Rohan-Chabot was born Isabella Charlotte FitzGerald on 16 July 1784 in Leinster House, Dublin. She was the fourth daughter of William Robert FitzGerald, 2nd Duke of Leinster, and Emilia Olivia (n√©e St. George). Her uncle was Lord Edward FitzGerald. During her childhood she lived at the various family homes of Leinster House, Carton House, County Kildare, and Frescati House, Blackrock. The family fled to Dublin during the 1798 Rebellion. Personal life She moved to Cheltenham, Gloucestershire in 1805, where she met and fell in love with William Henry Lyttleton. Her family did not approve of the match, and thus the couple did not marry. She visited London frequently staying with her sister, Lady Olivia Kinnaird, and becoming known in fashionable society. She married Louis William de Rohan-Chabot, vicomte de Chabot (1780‚Äì1875), son of the comte de Jarnac, a French officer living in London in June 1809. His mother was Elizabeth Smyth of Tinna Park, County Wicklow. Chabot travelled with her husband to Portugal in 1811, where they lived with Marquis d'Anjega at Belem. When her husband became ill, the couple returned to England travelling through a violent storm in the Bay of Biscay. During the voyage their infant son, who was also ill, died. Court life Chabot returned to Ireland in 1812 to visit, and again in 1813 for the birth of her daughter, Olivia. Following the restoration of the French monarchy in 1814, her husband was appointed aide-de-camp to the duc d'Orl√©ans and Chabot became a lady-in- waiting to the duchess, Maria Amalia of Naples and Sicily. The family lived in Paris, where as part of French society she met the future George IV at a soir√©e. After Napoleon escaped from Elba in 1815, Chabot left France and returned to Carton House. There, she gave birth to another son, Philippe. Following the defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo, Chabot returned to France taking up her duties as a lady-in-waiting to the duchesse d'Orl√©ans and living at the Ch√¢teau de Villiers and the Palais-Royal. In 1819, she visited Ireland for a long period, travelling with George IV in 1821 as he returned to England on the royal yacht after the Irish royal visit. Chabot's marriage broke up in 1825, and she became depressed. She remained in service as a Dame du Palais, and when the duc d'Orl√©ans was crowned as King Louis-Philippe of France, she became premi√®re dame d'honneur to Queen Marie-Am√©lie. Chabot died in 1868. Legacy A descendant, the comte de Chambrun of Ch√¢teau Lagrange, discovered her diaries in 1984, which covered the period from 1806 to 1825. The diary covered her early life in Ireland, her experience of living through the 1798 Rebellion, and her life in France and England.

It was the fourth consecutive above-normal Atlantic hurricane season. The season officially began on June 1, 2019 and ended on November 30, 2019. These dates, adopted by convention, historically describe the period in each year when most tropical systems form. However, storm formation is possible at any time of the year, as demonstrated in 2019 by the formation of the season's first named storm, Subtropical Storm Andrea, on May 20\\\\. The final storm of the season, Tropical Storm Sebastien transitioned to an extratropical cyclone on November 25\\\\. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's 2019 seasonal outlook called for 10-17 named storms, including 5-9 hurricanes and 2-4 major hurricanes. Altogether, the season produced 18 named storms, including six hurricanes of which three intensified into major hurricanes. Two major hurricanes, Dorian and Lorenzo, became Category 5 storms, causing the season to become the fourth consecutive with at least one Category 5 hurricane. Dorian inflicted catastrophic damage across the Bahamas. The hurricane killed at least 70 people and caused at least US$3.4 billion in damage, making it the costliest hurricane in the country's history. This timeline documents tropical cyclone formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, and dissipations during the season.

In Senegal, women have the same legal rights as men. However, it is still the case today that women are disadvantaged in many respects.  Women in the family  Despite governmental laws, outdated and incorrect perceptions of Sharia Law still enjoy a higher profile in many parts of Senegal. For example, they believe this law prohibits women from owning property or inheriting land from their fathers and husbands, although Islamic inheritance jurisprudence is widely disputed and has many laws that encourage women's inheritance. Many Senegalese women also have the problem of being denied access to the labor market. There are different views on why the woman is more likely to stay at home and not to provide for a second income in the household. On the one hand, many Senegalese men do not want their wives to go out to work and make money, as this could potentially erode the power dynamic between husband and wife. The men are in their eyes still the ones who have to raise the money and financially to take care of the family. They want to prevent the women from being able to make any claims. Among other things, it is important to many men that the woman stays at home with the children to teach them the Muslim values.  Girls' and boys' education  In Senegal, gender roles are clearly defined at home, and the opportunity cost of schooling tends to be higher for girls than for boys, and more so in rural areas. In Senegal, especially in rural areas, girls are having more challenges in getting access to education than boys are. In addition to traditional norms that are being kept, it is the lack of education and illiteracy that prevents women from advancing. Many families rather send boys to school. Many girls that still go to school tend to drop out early, often due to drivers like marriage or early pregnancy. Nevertheless, over the past decade in Senegal, the enrollment of girls for secondary school has increased. The gender parity index (GPI) of primary enrollment worldwide has improved from below 0.9 in 1990 to 0.97 in 2012. Gender parity often indicates that in many countries in the world girls are under-enrolled, while the recent improvement of the GPI also implies a rising dropout rate for boys in some countries In Senegal, 81 boys for every 100 girls dropped out in 1999, whereas 113 boys for every 100 girls dropped out in 2011.  Child marriage  Between 2000 and 2009, nearly 40% of Senegalese girls surveyed said they were married before their 18th birthday. This practice has been proven to have serious emotional and psychosocial consequences for those affected. They enter sexual relationships, which are often not consensual, and have to go directly from child to adulthood without adolescence. These weddings are also harmful because the girls very often have no say in choosing their future husband. A Driver of this is education. Child marriage is one of the main causes of girls dropping out of school which therefore reduces overall economic productivity and increases gender inequality. Women with secondary education or higher are less likely to getting married before the age of 18 than women with no education and with simply primary education.  Senegalese Law on Parity  Women represent 52% of the total Senegalese population, but only 23% of the representatives in the National Assembly, approximately 10% of the government officials, and about 13% of regional council members. Many female politicians from across the political spectrum felt marginalised within their own political parties and saw the need for a common arena where women's attendance and work in politics could be discussed. Therefore, In 2010, the Senegalese women's movement, being considered one of the strongest in Africa, was able to push for the adoption of the Law of parity. This law was later signed by former President Abdoulaye Wade. The aim of the law is to achieve equal female-male ratio in political parties candidate lists. Parties that do not comply with the law can be void. Already in 2012 the national election saw an increase of female parliamentarians from 22,7% to over 42% in the National Assembly. In the 2014 local election an increase from 16% to 47% was able to be seen in local legislatures. However, the law could not be implemented in all respects. The second largest city in Senegal, Touba, presented an all-male candidate list of 100 candidates for the first elections since the law was introduced in 2014. As a result, the electoral commission was forced to exclude the party for failing to comply with the law of parity. Since the city of Touba, however, is a Muslim city and there, in contrast to other Senegalese cities, not the political parties but the Muslim Khalif created the candidate list, this injury referred to the laws of Sharia. Paritiy, he says, will never be in this city. The conflict between the sociological reality and the development project remains a major topic in Senegal.

Located in the Mountain View section of Wayne Township, New Jersey, the station was at the Parish Drive bridge over the tracks. The station was away from its terminus at Hoboken Terminal on the shores of the Hudson River, where connections would be made to New York City via ferry and the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad. The western terminus. Denville, was away, where connections with the Morris and Essex Railroad were available. Just west of the station was Mountain View junction, where a connection was made to the Erie Railroad's New York and Greenwood Lake Railway was made.  History  Construction of the railroad through the Mountain View section of Wayne began in 1869 when the Morris and Essex Railroad began building a freight line. Mountain View station opened on May 12, 1877 after construction began in the summer of 1873 with the North Bergen Tunnel through Bergen Hill. The new tunnel would get service on the Lackawanna to Hoboken for its new terminal. The station was rebuilt in 1909 by the railroad. The Parish Drive overpass was built north of the station in 1939 as part of work for the Works Progress Administration. The station closed in April 1963 after the right-of-way through Paterson was purchased for the construction of Route 20 and Interstate 80\\\\. Mountain View was one of three stops closed when the Erie-Lackawanna Railroad moved service to the Main Line of the former Erie north of Paterson. The others were Totowa-Little Falls and Paterson's Marshall Street station. Mountain View station on both the Lackawanna and the Erie served as connector points with bus service to the nearby Packanack Lake. People could commute to the lake by taking the train to either station, meeting with the free bus.

The Wilderness Society has designated the area as a ‚ÄúMountain Treasure‚Äù.Virginia's Mountain Treasures, report issued by The Wilderness Society, May, 1999 One of the largest interior spaces in the Mount Rogers National Recreation area, Feathercamp offers a more primitive recreation than the Mount Rogers High Country. Trails include the Appalachian Trail, the Iron Mountain Trail and Feathercamp Branch. The area is part of the Mount Rogers Cluster. Location and access Boundary of the Feathercamp wildarea as identified by the Wilderness Society. The area is located in the Appalachian Mountains of Southwestern Virginia about 2.4 miles northeast of Damascus, Virginia between USFS Rd 90 on the east, US 58 on the south, and Va 605 on the west. It lies on the southwest side of the Shaw Gap wild area. The Appalachian Trail extends for 4.6 miles through the area, entering from US 58 on the east, climbing to Feathercamp Ridge and then exiting to US 58 on the south. Other trails into the area include: *Beech Grove, FS 4552, 3.7 miles, moderate, yellow diamond blaze, hiking, mountain biking horses, motorcycles *Buzzard Den, FS 4582, 1.6 miles, difficult, yellow triangle blaze, hiking, mountain biking, horses *Clark Mountain Trail, FS 4549, 2.4 miles, decommissioned *Feather Camp, FS 169, 3.3 miles, moderate, blue blazed, hiking *Feather Camp Ridge Trail, FS 4550, 0.58 miles, hiking, mountain biking *Iron Mountain, FS 301, 0.1 miles, easy, blue blaze, hiking, mountain biking, horses, motorcycles *Iron Mountain Spur, FS 4640, 0.1 miles, easy, blue blaze, hiking, mountain biking, horses, motorcycles *Sawmill, FS 4548, 2.8, moderate, yellow diamond, hiking, mountain biking, horses *Wright Hollow, FS 4558, 3.0 miles, difficult, yellow square blaze, hiking, mountain biking Several roads provide access to the area, some open seasonally. These include Beech Grove Road (Rt 49510), Feathercamp Rd. (Rt. 90), Buzzards Den Rd. (Rt. 835), Sturgill Rd (Rt. 615), and Cuckoo Rd (Rt. 4038). The forest service vehicle use map shows that the Cuckoo Rd. may be closed. The boundary of the wildland as determined by the Wilderness Society is shown in the adjacent map. Additional roads and trails are given on National Geographic Maps 786 (Mount Rogers). and Map 318 (Mount Rogers High Country) A great variety of information, including topographic maps, aerial views, satellite data and weather information, is obtained by selecting the link with the wild land‚Äôs coordinates in the upper right of this page. Beyond maintained trails, old logging roads can be used to explore the area. The Appalachian Mountains were extensively timbered in the early twentieth century leaving logging roads that are becoming overgrown but still passable. Old logging roads and railroad grades can be located by consulting the historical topographic maps available from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The Feathercamp wildarea is covered by USGS topographic maps Konnarock and Damascus. Natural history Old growth forest have been identified near Cuckoo Knob and on Feathercamp Ridge.. The area contains coves in which leaf rot has accumulated that supports an array of mushrooms‚Äîthe chanterelle, Caesar, yellow and violet corals, and milky white. Two streams in the area, Rush Creek and Feathercamp Branch, are recognized for their water quality. Wild natural trout streams in Virginia are classified by the Department of Game and Inland Fisheries by their water quality, with class i the highest and class iv the lowest.9VAC25-260-370. Classification Column.: 9VAC25-260-370. Classification Column., accessdate: April 23, 2018 Rush Creek and Feathercamp Branch are class ii streams. Topography As part of the Southern Blue Ridge Mountains Subsection within the Central Appalachian Broadleaf Coniferous Forest-Meadow Province, there are tectonic uplifted mountain ranges composed of igneous and metamorphic rock with many high gradient, deeply incised streams. Feathercamp Ridge (3274 feet) , Cuckoo Knob, highpoint on the southern end of the ridge, and Clark mountain (3041 feet) are dominant peaks. Forest Service management The Forest Service has conducted a survey of their lands to determine the potential for wilderness designation. Wilderness designation provides a high degree of protection from development. The areas that were found suitable are referred to as inventoried roadless areas. Later a Roadless Rule was adopted that limited road construction in these areas. The rule provided some degree of protection by reducing the negative environmental impact of road construction and thus promoting the conservation of roadless areas. Feathercamp was not inventoried in the roadless area review, and therefore not protected from possible road construction and timber sales. The forest service classifies areas under their management by a recreational opportunity setting that informs visitors of the diverse range of opportunities available in the forest. Areas in Feathercamp include ‚Äúsemi-primitive motorized‚Äù around the Iron Mountain Trail, ‚Äúsemi- primitive-2‚Äù on the north and south, ‚Äúdispersed recreation ‚Äì suitable‚Äù, and ‚Äúbackcountry ‚Äì few roads‚Äù in the center, as well as the Appalachian Trail corridor and part of the Whitetop Laurel Special Area.

It is part of a Benedictine monastery founded in 724, located on the island of Reichenau on Lake Constance in southern Germany. The island is home to the churches of Saint Mary, Marcus, Peter and Paul. The Church was built in the late 9th century to house the relic head of Saint George, a gift from Pope Gregory II, which commemorated a visit to Rome by Abbot Hoito in 896. The church is owned and run by the Catholic Church of Saint George Fund. The church interior is decorated with wall paintings that depict stories and figures from scripture and was designed for those who dedicate their lives to prayer and worship.  Frescoes  The church hosts frescoes were added in the 10th century. The wall paintings typify artistic expression from the Middle Ages and are unique for their age and location. They are the only preserved complete set of wall paintings produced north of the Alps before 1000 AD. The frescoes are divided into three zones. The first and lowest zone is located between the nave and the arches. The second zone is above the arches. Tthird and highest zone is located above the windows. The lowest panel depicts the monasteries at Reichenau Island. The second is the most researched zone. It portrays Christ's miracles. The top panel depicts Old Testament prophets and New Testament apostles. Each fresco details a specific story from the life of Christ. Descriptive inscriptions, or Tituli, accompany the paintings. = The eight miracles and their Titular = #The Healing of the Demon-Possessed Man () ‚ÄúThe demon is driven out, which bears the name Legion.

According to UNESCO, the island, including the frescoes of the Church at St. George, are protected based on the following criteria: the remains bear witness to the role of Medieval Benedictine monasteries; they are a strong example of monastic architecture in Central Europe from the 9th to 11th centuries; and they held great artistic significance in Europe at the time.  Restoration and recent damage  Following their discovery in 1856, the Frescoes significantly faded. The paintings depicting the life of Christ were to be preserved in an authentic state and not restored, reflecting their historic and artistic value. The Swiss technique of Bildtapeten, or picture wallpaper, was introduced to the church as a way to display a clean mural without restoring the original work. Depending on the visitors, the Bildtapeten could be raised and lowered from a mechanism installed in the ceiling. For example, the Bildtapeten might be lowered for mass to provide a complete picture of the paintings, then raised to reveal the original Frescoes when art historians or other experts are inspecting the walls. Academic painter Carl Schilling began creating and installing the Bildtapeten in 1889 and completed the project in 1891. In 1909, the Bildtapeten was removed after a part of the mechanism broke. A restoration that included partial repainting and artificial patination was completed by Victor Mezger between 1921 and 1922. A subsequent rise in visitors damaged the Frescoes, requiring the church to closely monitor their state. This increase has led to climate change within the church building. As more bodies enter the church each year, the humidity and pollution levels in the building increase. This humidity and pollution created an environment ideal for the growth of mold and bacteria, further damaging the frescoes. The frescoes are monitored by Landesamt f√ºr Denkmalpflege and the University of Stuttgart, Institute for Materials of Architecture. These groups collect data on indoor climate, microclimate impacts, air motion, radiation, and visitation. These data were expected help prompt new methods by which to regulate the indoor climate, including visitor access.

The company was founded in the late 1940s by Emanuel Bronner and continues to be run by members of the Bronner family. The company's products are known for their text-heavy labels and the variety of their advertised uses for a single product (e.g. one soap advertises eighteen uses, from toothpaste and shampoo to toilet scrubber and insecticide). The company's 2017 annual revenue was $120 million.  History  Dr. Bronner's Magic Soaps was founded by Emanuel Heilbronner, a Jewish immigrant soap-maker (not a physician) who fled Nazi Germany in 1936 to the US and dropped the \\"Heil\\" from his name because of its associations with Hitler. His family who stayed behind perished in the Holocaust. In 1946, while promoting his \\"Moral ABC\\" philosophy at the University of Chicago, Bronner was arrested for speaking without a permit, despite the fact he was invited to the campus to lecture by a local student group, and then committed to the Elgin Mental Health Center, a mental hospital in Elgin, Illinois, from which he escaped after shock treatments.. After his escape, he went into business producing different varieties of castile soap. Bronner was a fervent promulgator of his own syncretic spiritual ideology and originally distributed the soap to those who attended lectures on his 'All One' philosophy, but soon became convinced that attendees were seeking soap rather than spiritual enlightenment. After this realization, Bronner began to print key tenets of his teachings on the soap bottles as a way to proselytize. The labels still include lengthy diatribes on the unity of mankind and the need to \\"unite spaceship earth\\". In 2006, a documentary film entitled Dr. Bronner's Magic Soapbox was released, and in 2017 the company released a spoken word album of Emanuel Bronner's spiritual teachings. For a period of time, Bronner ran the company as a tax-exempt religious organization but was found to be out of compliance with this designation and was levied with $1.3 million in back- taxes in 1985. When this occurred, Jim Bronner, Emanuel's son, began to work for the company and recapitalized it as a for-profit company in 1988. In 1997, Jim Bronner's son David began working for the company, followed by his brother Michael in 2000. Michael Bronner assumed presidency of the company in 2015 and promoted his brother David Bronner to the position of CEO (or Cosmic Engagement Officer).  Supply chain  The major ingredients in Dr. Bronner's Magic Soaps products are organic and fair trade. The company has developed a number of fair trade and organic production systems in Ghana, Sri Lanka, Samoa, India, and Kenya through its sister LLC, Serendiworld.  Activism and philanthropy  Dr. Bronner's Magic Soaps has championed a number of causes related to drug policy reform, animal rights, genetically modified organisms and fair trade practices. The company has self-imposed caps on executive pay, with executive salaries not to exceed 5 times the wage of its lowest paid workers. Roughly a third of the company's profits are dedicated to charitable giving and activist causes annually. In 2018, the company joined Patagonia, Inc. and the Rodale Institute in promoting the development of the Regenerative Organic Certification label, a more stringent certification than 'organic' that requires companies to utilize only ingredients that have been produced under conditions that foster workers' rights, animal welfare, and environmental sustainability. In 2013 the company donated $1.8 million to the campaign to pass a proposition requiring the labeling of foods containing genetically modified organisms in Washington State. In 2017, Dr. Bronner's Magic Soaps donated $600,000 to animal rights causes. Notably, the company purchased a boat for Sea Shepherd Conservation Society operations in Germany, the MV Emanuel Bronner. CEO David Bronner is a critic of drug prohibition and an activist for the legalization of a number of psychoactive substances. In 2004 the company sued the Drug Enforcement Administration with the goal of changing rules regarding the importation of hemp oil. A federal judge ruled in favor of the plaintiffs. David Bronner has been arrested twice for civil disobedience protesting limitations on the domestic production of hemp. In 2004 he planted hemp seeds on the lawn of the Drug Enforcement Administration headquarters, and in 2012, he harvested hemp while locked in a metal cage in front of the White House. In 2015 he was named Cannabis Activist of the Year by the Seattle Hempfest. Bronner is a member of the Board of Directors of the organization Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, and at his behest the company has pledged to donate five million dollars to the organization between 2017 and 2022, principally for their work in support of the therapeutic use of MDMA for post-traumatic stress disorder. In 2019, David Bronner pledged company contributions of $1 Million to Oregon‚Äôs statewide ballot initiative to legalize psilocybin assisted therapy and allied organisations like SPORE.

The show was held in Arena Naucalpan, Naucalpan, State of Mexico, which is IWRG's primary venue. As the name indicates the event commemorates the anniversary of IWRG, which was founded on January 1, 1996. All matches on the show were held inside a steel cage match, combining that stipulation with a second stipulation as well. The main event saw Imposible defend the IWRG Rey del Ring Championship against Dr. Cerebro where the steel cage stipulation was combined with a ladder match. The show also featured two Luchas de Apuestas, or \\"bet matches\\" where X-Corp and Obett both had their hair shaved off as a result of their losses. The event introduced the IWRG Rey del Aire Championship (\\"King of the Air\\") and saw Aram√≠s crowned as the first champion. Production =Background= Wrestler-turned-promoter Adolfo \\"Pirata\\" Moreno began promoting wrestling shows in his native Naucalpan de Ju√°rez, Mexico, bringing in wrestlers from Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre (EMLL) to Naucalpan as well as featuring wrestlers from the Mexican independent circuit. Later on he would promote shows mainly in \\"Arena KO Al Gusto\\" and served as the Universal Wrestling Association (UWA) partner, using the name Promociones Moreno as the business name for his promotional efforts. In 1977 Moreno bought the rundown Arena KO Al Gusto and had Arena Naucalpan built in its place, an arena designed specifically for wrestling shows, with a maximum capacity of 2,400 spectators for the shows. Arena Naucalpan became the permanent home for Promociones Moreno, with very few shows held elsewhere. In late 1995 Adolfo Moreno decided to create his own promotion, creating a regular roster instead of relying totally on wrestlers from other promotions, creating the International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG; sometimes referred to as Grupo Internacional Revoluci√≥n in Spanish) on January 1, 1996. From that point on Arena Naucalpan became the main venue for IWRG, hosting the majority of their weekly shows and all of their major shows as well. The first IWRG Anniversary Show was held on January 1, 1997 with all subsequent shows being held on or right after January 1 each year, all at Arena Naucalpan. =Storylines= The event featured five professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre- existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines.

Drymaea or Drymaia () or Drymus or Drymos (ŒîœÅœçŒºŒøœÇ) or Drymea or Drymia (ŒîœÅœÖŒºŒØŒ±) or Drymiae was a frontier town of ancient Phocis, on the side of Doris, whence it is included in the limits of Doris by Livy. Pausanias describes it as 80 stadia from Amphicleia: but this number appears to be an error of the copyists, since in the same passage he says that Amphicleia was only 15 stadia from Tithronium, and Tithronium 15 stadia from Drymaea, which would make Drymaea only 30 stadia from Amphicleia. He also speaks of an ancient temple of Demeter at Drymaea, containing an upright statue of the goddess in stone, in whose honour the annual festival of the Thesmophoria was celebrated. Its more ancient name is said to have been Nauboleis (ŒùŒ±œÖŒ≤ŒøŒªŒµ·øñœÇ), which was derived from Naubolus, an ancient Phocian hero, father of Iphitus., 10.33.11. It was one of the Phocian towns destroyed in the Greco-Persian Wars by the army of Xerxes I in 480 BCE. In 348/7 BCE, it was destroyed in the Third Sacred War and the inhabitants settled in nearby villages. During the First Macedonian War, Philip V of Macedon conquered the town in 208 BCE. The site of Drymaea is near the modern village of Glunitsa (renamed Drymaia in 1915). William Martin Leake visited the site in the 19th century and noted that is indicated by some ruins, situated midway between Kamares and Glunista, and occupying a rocky point of the mountain on the edge of the plain. \\"Some of the towers remain nearly entire.

Winning a mask is considered a bigger accomplishment in lucha libre than winning a professional wrestling championship and usually draws more people and press coverage. Losing a mask is often a watershed moment in a wrestler's career, they give up the mystique and prestige of being an enmascarado (masked wrestler) but usually come with a higher than usual payment from the promoter.

Production =Background= Professional wrestling has been a generational tradition in lucha libre since its inception early in the 20th century, with many second- or third-generation wrestlers following in the footsteps of their fathers or mothers. Several lucha libre promotions honor those traditions, often with annual tournaments such as Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre's La Copa Junior. The Naucalpan, State of Mexico-based International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG) in 2011 created the IWRG Junior de Juniors Championship, a championship where only second- or third-generation wrestlers are allowed to wrestle for it. In addition to real-life second- or third-generation wrestlers there are a number of wrestlers who are presented as second- or third-generation wrestlers, normally masked wrestlers promoted as \\"Juniors\\". These wrestlers normally pay a royalty or fee for the use of the name, using the name of an established star to get attention from fans and promoters. Examples of such instances of fictional family relationships include Cien Caras Jr. who paid Cien Caras for the rights to use the name. In March 2011, only weeks after the creation of the Junior de Juniors Championship IWRG held their first IWRG Rebeli√≥n de los Juniors show, with the focal point being the Junior de Juniors Championship and \\"Junior\\" competitors.

In 2005 IWRG created a specific spring-time show promoting the steel cage match concept under the name Guerra del Golfo, or \\"Gulf War\\", referring to the Gulf of Mexico (not the Gulf War in the middle east). The Guerra del Golfo shows featured two \\"qualifying\\" multi-man steel cage matches where the loser would later be forced to face off against each other in the main event of the show. In the final cage match the two wrestlers would wrestle where the loser would be forced to either unmask or, if they are not wearing a mask, have his hair shaved off. The use of the steel cage in three matches distinguishes the Guerra del Golfo event from other Steel cage matches held throughout the year such as the IWRG El Castillo del Terror'(\\"The Tower of Terror\\"), IWRG Guerra de Sexos (\\"War of the Sexes\\"), or IWRG Prison Fatal (\\"Deadly Prison\\") shows. The first two Guerra del Golfo steel cage matches are contested under elimination match rules, which means wrestlers escape the cage by climbing over the top of the steel cage to the floor. The last wrestler in the cage will be put in the final match of the night. Unlike the first two steel cage matches the final match is normally contested under pinfall rules. At the 2012 Guerra del Golfo the final match ended up differently than announced. Oficial Factor and Oficial 911 were supposed to face off one on one, but Factor's teammates Oficial Rayan and Oficial Spartan as well as Oficial 911's teammates Oficial AK-47 and Oficial Fierro all climbed into the cage to turn it into an elimination match.

Phosphasilenes or silylidenephosphanes are a class of compounds with silicon-phosphorus double bonds. Since the electronegativity of phosphorus (2.1) is higher than that of silicon (1.9), the \\"Si=P\\" moiety of phosphasilene is polarized. The degree of polarization can be tuned by altering the coordination numbers of the Si and P centers, or by modifying the electronic properties of the substituents. The phosphasilene Si=P double bond is highly reactive, yet with the choice of proper substituents, it can be stabilized via donor-acceptor interaction or by steric congestion.146x146px The landmark discovery of the first phosphasilene by NMR spectroscopy was made in 1984 by Bickelhaupt et al. The first phosphasilene came with bulky aryl substituents at the phosphorus and silicon atoms. Almost a decade after this spectroscopic observation, the first structural characterization of phosphasilene was achieved in 1993 by Niecke et al. The successful isolation of phosphasilenes with silicon-phosphorus double bonds represents one of the discoveries that challenged and disproved the \\"double-bond rule\\".  Synthesis  = Synthesis via Œ≤-elimination = 478x478px An important synthetic pathway towards phosphasilene is the 1,2-elimination reactions of silylphosphane derivatives. The first metastable arylphosphasilenes were accessed by Bickelhaupt et al. via the deprotonation of in situ formed (chlorosilyl)phosphanes ArP(H)‚Äì(Cl)SiAr2 using organolithium bases. As shown in the scheme on the left, it is also possible to use pre- formed lithium phosphanides Ar'P(H)Li as both a phosphorus source and a base. However, the latter synthetic pathway involves formation of primary phosphines ArPH2, which can be difficult of be separated from phosphasilenes. Despite such a drawback, this strategy has been successfully applied by Niecke et al. to obtain a series of 1,3-diphospha-2-silaallyl anions, which serve as precursors for 2-phosphanylphosphasilenes. 532x532px Applying an analogous strategy, Driess and coworkers developed an effective approach for synthesizing P-silyl phosphasilenes via the thermal elimination of LiF from corresponding lithium (flouorosilyl)phosphanides. 731x731px = Synthesis based on reactivities of stable silyene = 479x479px Phosphasilenes with 4-coordinate silicon, which can also be viewed as silylene-stabilized phosphinidene, can be synthesized based on the reactivities of stable silyene complexes. For example, Inoue and coworkers demonstrated that benzamidinate- stabilized phosphanylsilylene can give rise to corresponding Si- and P-trimethylsilyl-substituted phosphasilene via thermal rearrangement, while the reaction can also yield 4-disila-1,3-diphosphacyclobuta-diene with the addition of a mild chlorinating agent Ph3PCl2. In these phosphasilenes with four-coordinate silicon, even though formally five bonds are drawn around silicon, the Si‚ÄìP œÄ bonds are calculated to be strongly polarized towards the P atoms. The contribution from phosphorus and silicon to the œÄ orbitals are calculated to be 87.53% and 12.47%, respectively.  Structure and bonding  = The parent phosphasilene H2Si=PH = AIM analysis.400x400px The unstable parent phosphasilene H2Si=PH has been generated in the gas phase by the reacting atomic silicon with phosphine PH3, and identified via matrix isolation spectroscopy methods. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggests that in the ground state, H2Si=PH exists in a singlet spin state, with Cs-symmetric planar geometry. At the B3LYP/6-311+G level of theory, the Si=P bond length and the Si-P-H bond angle are calculated to be 2.084 √Ö and 90.7o. The Si=P bond dissociation energy is 75.0 kcal mol‚àí1 at the B97-D/6-31G(d) level of theory; while the œÄ-bond energy, DœÄ(Si=P) is 36.6/35.9 kcal mol‚àí1. The frontier orbitals of the parent phosphasilene consists of the œÄ bonding and œÄ anti-bonding orbitals: œÄ(Si=P) and œÄ*(Si=P) correspond to the HOMO and LUMO, respectively. HOMO-1 was calculated to be the lone pair on phosphorus n(P). = \\"Half-Parent\\" Phosphasilene R2Si=PH = Driess and coworkers prepared thermally stable \\"half\\"-parent phosphasilene R2Si=PH (R2Si = (tBu3Si)(iPr3C6H2)Si), which is the first example of phosphasilene with a terminal PH group. This species was obtained as a mixture of E/Z isomers, thus its 31P NMR spectrum featured two doublets with 29Si satellites (Œ¥=123.1, 1J (P, H)=123 Hz, 1J (P, Si)=157 Hz and Œ¥=134.2 ppm, 1J (P, H)=131 Hz, 1J (P, Si)=130 Hz). These 1J (P, H) coupling constants are much smaller compared to those of secondary phosphanes (R2PH) and phosphaalkenes with a PH group, which indicates that the phosphasilene phosphorus atom possesses more 3p character. X-ray crystallography of this \\"half\\"-parent phosphasilene species shows that the silicon atom occupies a trigonal-planar coordination environment. The Si=P bond distance was reported to be 2.094(5) √Ö, which is about 7% shorter than a typical silicon-phosphorus single bond, but only slightly longer than that of P-silyl-substituted phosphasilenes, which suggests that the potential of Si=P bond on a potential energy surface is relatively shallow. = œÄ-conjugated phosphasilenes = 518x518px Tamao et al. reported a series of œÄ-conjugated phosphasilenes stabilized by Eind groups (Eind=1,1,3,3,5,5,7,7-octaethyl-s- hydrindacen-4-yl). These systems feature Si=P units that are highly coplanar with the aromatic ring, allowing strong œÄ ‚Üí œÄ* absorptions. The coplanarity is made possible by the rigidity of the two Eind groups that are oriented trans and perpendicular with respect to the Si=P bond. The Si=P bond length observed by X-ray crystallography are ca. 2.09-2.10 √Ö, which are typical for phosphasilenes. 773x773px The bonding of œÄ-conjugated phosphasilenes has been probed by DFT calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G level. The HOMO was calculated to represent mostly the 3pœÄ(Si‚ÄìP), while the LUMO featured significant contribution from the 3pœÄ*(Si‚ÄìP)‚Äì2pœÄ*(phenyl) conjugation. The HOMO-1 orbital involves the 3n‚Äì2pœÄ conjugation, which originate from the presence of lone pair on the phosphorus atom and the œÄ-orbital on the Eind benzene ring. = \\"Push-pull\\" phosphasilene = By installing electron-donating substituents on silicon and electron-withdrawing substituents on phosphorus, the Si=P bond polarization can be decreased and even reversed through the \\"push-pull\\" interaction of the substituents with opposing electronic effects. Applying this design strategy, Escudi√© et al. prepared stable \\"push-pull\\" phosphasilene (tBu2MeSi)2Si=PMes* (Mes* = 2,4,6-tri-tertbutylphenyl) with electron-donating silyl groups on Si and an electron-withdrawing aryl group on P. Computations on the model compound (Me3Si)2Si=PMes (Mes = 2,4,6-trimethylphenyl) demonstrate that n(P) and œÄ*(Si=P) correspond to the HOMO and LUMO, respectively. The relatively small energy gap between the interacting occupied (n(P)) and vacant (œÄ*(Si=P)) molecular orbitals gives rise to a large paramagnetic contribution, which explains the extreme deshielding of the doubly bonded Si and P atoms, as well as the red shift in the UV spectrum that are observed in (tBu2MeSi)2Si=PMes*. In the \\"push-pull\\" phosphasilene prepared by Escudi√© and co-workers, the Si=P bond length was reported to be 2.1114(7) √Ö, which is longer than what was observed in most other reported phosphasilenes (2.062(1)‚Äì2.094(5) √Ö). = Metallophosphasilenes R2Si=PM = Driess et al. demonstrated that stable metallophosphasilenes of the type R2Si=PM can be prepared from metalation reaction of \\"half\\"-parent phosphasilenes R2Si=PH (R2Si = (tBu3Si)(iPr3C6H2)Si). NMR spectroscopic studies demonstrated that metalation led to the deshielding of the 31P nucleus, while the low coordinate 29Si atom in the metallophosphasilene became more shielded. Driess and coworkers explained this observation by proposing that the stabilization of the non-bonding orbital at phosphorus through n(P) ‚Üí œÉ*(Si-Si) hyperconjugation is more effective after metalation. This is due to the higher negative partial charge at the phosphorus atom in the metallophosphasilene. As shown in the scheme below, this shielding effects is analogous to what has been observed for related alkali-metal-substituted disilenylides of the type [M(R3Si)Si=Si(SiR3)2]. The Si=P distance in the metallophosphasilene that Driess et al. synthesized was reported to be 2.064(1) √Ö, which is significantly shorter than that of the \\"half\\"-parent compound (R2Si=PH) from which R2Si=PM was derived. This contraction of the Si=P bond, together with a slight elongation of the Si‚ÄìSi bond and a shrinkage of the P-Si-Si angle, has been rationalized by the increased hyperconjugative interactions in the R2Si=PM system. 401x401px = Phosphasilene with amino- substituents at Si = 418x418px Due to the n(N)‚ÄìœÄ*(Si=P) orbital interaction, there exists strong delocalization of electron density from nitrogen to phosphorus in phosphasilene with amino-substituents at silicon. Among the resonance structures shown in the figure on the left, the structure in the middle with zwitterionic structure was calculated to have a significant contribution. Therefore compared to the parent phosphasilene, the double bond character of the Si‚ÄìP is significantly reduced in phosphasilene with amino- substituents at Si, giving rise to longer Si‚ÄìP bond distance.  Reactivity  = Reaction with Lewis acids and bases = Due to the higher electronegativity of phosphorus and the polarized nature of the Si=P moiety, phosphasilene tend to react with Lewis acids and bases at the phosphorus atom and silicon atom, respectively. The reaction of phosphasilene with Lewis acids, which usually occurs at the Lewis-basic two-coordinate phosphorus atom, is also dependent upon the nature of the reactants. Lewis bases have been shown to react with both three-coordinate and four-coordinate silicon atoms. The coordination of Lewis bases to the three-coordinate silicon atom of phosphasilene can lead to effective stabilization of the Si=P moiety. For example, it has been demonstrated that unstable phosphasilene can react with DMAP and small N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) to afford the corresponding stable complexes. In phosphasilenes stabilized by NHC, the Si=P bonds are elongated and the negative charge gets localized on the phosphorus atom. Among the resonance structures shown in the figure below, Natural Resonance Theory (NRT) indicates that the third structure with a Si‚ÄìP single bond is predominant, carrying a resonance weight of 76.3%. Therefore these stabilized phosphasilene can also be interpreted as a silyene-phosphinidene adduct. 463x463px For donor-stabilized phosphasilene with four coordinate silicon, the reaction with Lewis bases may lead to ligand exchange at the silicon atom. = Metalation = Metalation of phosphasilenes gives rise to either complexes featuring the coordination of the phosphorus lone pair to a metal center or P-metalated phosphasilenes. In the former case, the binding of the phosphasilenes to transition metals via the phosphorus lone pair reduces the double-bond character of the Si‚ÄìP bond. Some examples of this type of phosphasilene transition metal complexes are shown below. 630x630px Driess and coworkers first observed the formation of P-metalated phosphasilenes of the latter case: P-ferrio-substituted phosphasilene R2Si=P[Fe(CO)2(Œ∑5-C5H5)] (R = 2,4,6-iPr3C6H2). They further demonstrated that P-metalated phosphasilenes R2Si=PM can be obtained by metalating \\"half\\"-parent phosphasilenes, which substitutes the R2Si=PH hydrogen atom with transition metal-containing fragments. = Phosphinidene transfer = Phosphasilenes with significant zwitterionic characters undergoes facile hemolytic cleavage of the fragile Si=P bond. This can be utilized for the liberation and transfer of phosphinidene (:PH) to unsaturated organic molecules. Driess et al. demonstrated that a fragile \\"half\\"-parent phosphasilene LSi=PH (L = CH[(C=CH2)CMe(NAr)2]; Ar = 2,6-iPr2C6H3) with highly shielded PH moiety is capable of transferring :PH to NHC. alt= 262x262px Theoretical investigation by DFT (B3LYP/6-31G(d) level) revealed that this phosphasilene bears two highly localized lone pairs on the phosphorus atom due to the LSi=PH ‚Üî LSi‚ÄìP+H‚àí resonance. Based on natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis, the œÉ bond of Si=P involves even contributions from Si and P, while the œÄ bond (HOMO-1) is strongly polarized to the phosphorus atom. This indicates that the œÄ bond between silicon and phosphorus is not predominant, supporting the significance of the zwitterionic resonance structure in the description of Si‚ÄìP bonding. = Small molecule activation = 368x368pxThe Si=P moiety of phosphasilene has been reported to demonstrate small molecule activation reactivities analogous to those observed in Si=Si, P=C, and other heavier alkene analogues. For example, phosphasilene with silyl substituents has been shown to activate white phosphorus (P4) under relatively mild reaction conditions to form 1,2,3-triphospha-4-silabicyclo[1.1.0]butanes, which is similar to disilenes' reactivity. Analogous to the behavior of phosphaalkenes, phosphasilene can also activate chalcogens such as S8 and Te to form unstable three-membered ring compounds. Using a fragile zwitterionic \\"half-parent\\" phosphasilene L'Si=PH (L' = CH[(C=CH2)CMe(NAr)2], Ar = 2,6-iPr2C6H3), Driess and coworkers demonstrated that an unusual N-H activation reactivity can be achieved by the Si=P moiety in ammonia, affording L'Si(NH2)PH2 species. This represent a rare example of catalyst-free 1,2-hydroamination reaction that's been reported in heavier alkene analogues. 285x285px  References  Category:Silicon compounds Category:Phosphorus compounds ","title":"Phosphasilene"},{"id":"58587851","text":"Russ Gray Pond is a small lake east of Beerston in Delaware County, New York.

Specimens belonging to the genus include the heaviest known birds, and were originally considered to be large Aepyornis specimens. The genus was erected in 2018 after a detailed morphometric analysis. Taxonomy and naming Tibiotarsus Vorombe titan was first described by Charles William Andrews as Aepyornis titan in 1894. It was synonymized with the type species of Aepyornis, A. maximus, by American paleontologist Pierce Brodkorb in 1963. In 2018, James Hansford and Samuel Turvey, two researchers from the Zoological Society of London, found that it was sufficiently distinct from Aepyornis and allocated it in the new genus Vorombe. They also recognized Aepyornis ingens as a synonym of Vorombe titan. The study by Hansford and Turvey is the first taxonomic reassessment of elephant birds in over 50 years. The genus name Vorombe is derived from the Malagasy word vorombe meaning \\"big bird\\" while the specific name titan is derived from the Ancient Greek word Œ§ŒπœÑŒ¨ŒΩ (Titan), which refers to the Greek gods that preceded the Twelve Olympians. Specimens and features Comparison of the aepyornthids, Mullerornis (front), Vorombe titan (largest), and Aepyornis (back), of Holocene Madagascar. The syntype series of Vorombe titan includes a femur (NHMUK A439) and tibiotarsus (NHMUK A437) found in Itampolo (Itampulu V√©), Madagascar. The femur of Vorombe is significantly larger than that of Aepyornis and Mullerornis in all measurements. Notable features include enlarged proximal and distal ends, a more acute curvature in the medio-distal margin of the femoral head (caput femoris), the presence of a marked lateral supracondylar ridge, and a medial condyle (condylus medialis) that is expanded medially and flatter than in Aepyornis. The tibiotarsus is extremely large in comparison to Aepyornis and Mullerornis. The proximal and distal ends are enlarged, particularly medio-laterally. It has a more marked narrowing transition into the shaft, which is narrower in proportion to the total length compared to Aepyornis. The tarsometatarsus is significantly larger and more expanded medio-laterally than in other genera, mainly at the proximal and distal ends. The lateral portion of the proximal articular surface protrudes proximally to the medial portion, creating a prominently angled proximal articular surface similar to that of A. hildebrandti. The tarsometatarsus is larger than Mullerornis in all measurements, and larger than Aepyornis in most measurements. Samples from two femora assigned to Vorombe titan (specimens MNHN MAD 364 and NHMUK A2142) were sent for accelerator mass spectrometer carbon-14 dating at the Oxford Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit and calibrated using ShCal13. Both specimens were dated to the Holocene (3,680 to 2,352 BP). Size Vorombe stood tall and weighed , with a mean of . This is greater than the mass estimates of other extinct Quaternary giant birds such as Dinornis, which was between , and Dromornis, between , making it the largest known bird. The largest femur (MNHN MAD 368) measured by Hansford and Turvey could not be formally assigned to a cluster (group) as it was incomplete. The specimen is thought to belong to Vorombe on the basis of its size. It had a least-shaft circumference of , which gives a weight estimate of , making it the largest known bird individual ever recorded. This is comparable to or greater than the mass estimates of the smallest (insular dwarf) sauropod dinosaurs: Europasaurus, at ; and Magyarosaurus, between . Ecology Vorombe titan, Aepyornis maximus and Mullerornis modestus were found across much of Madagascar, and were sympatric in the arid spiny forests in the south, succulent woodlands in the southwest, and grassland/subhumid forest mosaic in the Central Highlands. The significant size differences between the three taxa indicates that they exploited different dietary niches and plant interactions. Elephant birds shared the Quaternary ecosystems of Madagascar with dwarf hippos, giant lemurs and giant tortoises.

Processes A fictive preparation of the nervous system is achieved by surgical removal or chemical fixation, to observe behavior in response to experimental stimuli. Fixation allows for observation of target areas without interference from undesired neural signals or behavioral movement, which leads to more precise data collection. However, fictive behavior does not entirely resemble in vivo behavior because the true system has been altered. In some cases, surgery or measurement devices lessen the intensity of cellular signals. The goal of measuring localized behavior is to discover and or understand the circuitry further. The type of neural circuitry that is most commonly observed with fictive behavior are those that underlie rhythmic-behavior patterns. Here is an example of how fictive feeding behavior is observed in a great pond snail (Lymnaea stagnalis). The lip and tentacle areas are bisected and isolated, by removing all other peripheral nerves, but the lip/tentacle and buccal nerves remain connected to the cerebral ganglia. Now establishing the buccal nerve pathway as the only way for signals to pass back and forth to the cerebral ganglia, sucrose (the food stimuli) is introduced to the lip and tentacle areas while intracellular recordings are taken simultaneously.

Out of 89,000 Jews in the country in 1940, around 69,000 were murdered in the Holocaust. After the September 1938 Munich Agreement, Slovakia unilaterally declared its autonomy within Czechoslovakia, but lost significant territory to Hungary in the First Vienna Award, signed in November. The following year, with German encouragement, the ruling ethnonationalist Slovak People's Party declared independence from Czechoslovakia. State propaganda blamed the Jews for the territorial losses. Jews were targeted for discrimination and harassment, including the confiscation of property and businesses. The exclusion of Jews from the economy impoverished the community, which encouraged the government to conscript them for forced labor. On 9 September 1941, the government passed the Jewish Code, which it claimed to be the strictest anti-Jewish law in Europe. In 1941, the Slovak government negotiated with Nazi Germany for the mass deportation of Jews to German-occupied Poland. Between March and October 1942, 58,000 Jews were deported to Auschwitz concentration camp and the Lublin District of the General Governorate; only a few hundred survived. The Slovak government organized the transports and paid 500 Reichsmarks per Jew for the supposed cost of resettlement. The persecution of Jews resumed in August 1944, when Germany invaded Slovakia and triggered the Slovak National Uprising. Another 13,500 Jews were deported and hundreds to thousands were murdered in Slovakia by Einsatzgruppe H and the Hlinka Guard Emergency Divisions. After liberation by the Red Army, survivors faced renewed antisemitism and difficulty regaining stolen property; most emigrated after the 1948 Communist coup. The postwar Communist regime censored discussion of the Holocaust; free speech was restored after the fall of the Communist regime in 1989. The Slovak government's complicity in the Holocaust continues to be disputed by far-right nationalists.  Background  New Synagogue in ≈Ωilina shortly after completion, Before 1939, Slovakia had never been an independent country. Its territory was part of the Kingdom of Hungary for a thousand years. Seventeen medieval Jewish communities have been documented in the territory of modern-day Slovakia, but significant Jewish presence was ended with the expulsions following the Hungarian defeat at the Battle of Moh√°cs in 1526. Many Jews immigrated in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Jews from Moravia settled west of the Tatra Mountains, forming the Oberlander Jews, while Jews from Galicia settled east of the mountains, forming a separate community (Unterlander Jews) influenced by Hasidism. Due to the schism in Hungarian Jewry, communities split in the mid-nineteenth century into Orthodox (the majority), Status Quo, and more assimilated Neolog factions. Following Jewish emancipation, complete by 1896, many Jews had adopted Hungarian language and customs to advance in society. Although they were not as integrated as the Jews of Bohemia and Moravia, many Slovak Jews moved to cities and joined the professions; others remained in the countryside, mostly working as artisans, merchants, and shopkeepers. Jews spearheaded the nineteenth-century economic changes that led to greater commerce in rural areas and by the end of the century comprised some 70 percent of the bankers and businessmen in the Slovak uplands. Although a few Jews supported Slovak nationalism, by the mid-nineteenth century antisemitism had become a theme in the Slovak national movement, Jews being branded \\"agents of magyarization\\" and \\"the most powerful prop to the [Hungarian] ruling classes\\", in the words of historian Thomas Lorman. In the western Slovak lands, anti-Jewish riots broke out in the wake of the Revolutions of 1848; more riots occurred due to the Tiszaeszl√°r blood libel in 1882‚Äì1883. Traditional religious antisemitism was joined by the stereotypical view of Jews as exploiters of poor Slovaks (economic antisemitism), and national antisemitism: Jews were strongly associated with the Hungarian state and accused of sympathizing with Hungarian at the expense of Slovak ambitions. After World War I, Slovakia became part of the new country of Czechoslovakia. Jews lived in 227 communities (in 1918) and their population was estimated at 135,918 (in 1921). Anti-Jewish riots broke out in the aftermath of the declaration of independence (1918‚Äì1920), although the violence was not nearly as serious as in Ukraine or Poland. Slovak nationalists associated Jews with the Czechoslovak state and accused them of supporting Czechoslovakism. Blood libel accusations occurred in Trenƒçin and in ≈†alavsk√Ω Gemer in the 1920s. In the 1930s, the Great Depression affected Jewish businessmen and also increased economic antisemitism. Economic underdevelopment and perceptions of discrimination in Czechoslovakia led a plurality (about one-third) of Slovaks to support the conservative, ethnonationalist Slovak People's Party (: HSƒΩS). HSƒΩS viewed minority groups such as Czechs, Hungarians, Jews, and Romani people as a destructive influence on the Slovak nation, and presented Slovak autonomy as the solution to Slovakia's problems. The party began to emphasize antisemitism during the late 1930s following a wave of Jewish refugees from Austria in 1938 and anti-Jewish laws passed by Hungary, Poland, and Romania. Slovak independence Protection Zone in (5). (1) annexed by Czechoslovakia after the war. Administrative regions of the Slovak State (1939‚Äì1945) The September 1938 Munich Agreement ceded the Sudetenland, the German-speaking region of the Czech lands, to Germany. HSƒΩS took advantage of the ensuing political chaos to declare Slovakia's autonomy on 6 October. Jozef Tiso, a Catholic priest and HSƒΩS leader, became prime minister of the Slovak autonomous region. Catholicism, the religion of 80 percent of the country's inhabitants, was key to the regime with many of its leaders being bishops, priests, or laymen. Under Tiso's leadership, the Slovak government opened negotiations in Kom√°rno with Hungary regarding their border. The dispute was submitted to arbitration in Vienna by Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. Hungary was awarded much of southern Slovakia on 2 November, including 40 percent of Slovakia's arable land and 270,000 people who had declared Czechoslovak ethnicity. HSƒΩS consolidated its power by passing an enabling act, banning opposition parties, shutting down independent newspapers, distributing antisemitic and anti-Czech propaganda, and founding the paramilitary Hlinka Guard. Parties for the German and Hungarian minorities were allowed under HSƒΩS hegemony, and the German Party formed the militia. HSƒΩS imprisoned thousands of its political opponents, but never carried out a sentence of capital punishment. Un-free elections in December 1938 resulted in a 95-percent vote for HSƒΩS. On 14 March 1939, the Slovak State proclaimed its independence with German support and protection. Germany annexed and invaded the Czech rump state the following day, and Hungary seized Carpathian Ruthenia with German acquiescence. In a treaty signed on 23 March, Slovakia renounced much of its foreign policy and military autonomy to Germany in exchange for border guarantees and economic assistance. It was neither fully independent nor a German puppet state, but occupied an intermediate status. In October 1939, Tiso, leader of the conservative-clerical branch of HSƒΩS, became president; Vojtech Tuka, leader of the party's radical fascist wing, was appointed prime minister. Both wings of the party struggled for Germany's favor. The radical wing of the party was pro-German, while the conservatives favored autonomy from Germany; the radicals relied on the Hlinka Guard and German support, while Tiso was popular among the clergy and the population.  Anti-Jewish measures (1938‚Äì1941)  =Initial actions= Government propaganda ordering Jews to \\"Get out of Slovakia!\\" Immediately after it came to power in 1938, the autonomous government began firing Jewish government employees. The Committee for the Solution of the Jewish Question was founded on 23 January 1939 to discuss anti-Jewish legislation. The state-sponsored media demonized Jews as \\"enemies of the state\\" and of the Slovak nation. Jewish businesses were robbed, and physical attacks on Jews occurred both spontaneously and at the instigation of the Hlinka Guard and . In his first radio address following the establishment of the Slovak State in 1939, Tiso emphasized his desire to \\"solve the Jewish Question\\"; anti-Jewish legislation was the only concrete measure that he promised. The persecution of Jews was a key element of the state's domestic policy. Discriminatory measures affected all aspects of life, serving to isolate and dispossess Jews before they were deported. In the days after the announcement of the First Vienna Award, antisemitic rioting broke out in Bratislava; newspapers justified the riots with Jews' alleged support for Hungary during the partition negotiations. Adolf Eichmann, a Nazi official who had been sent to Bratislava, coauthored a plan with Tiso and other HSƒΩS politicians to deport impoverished and foreign Jews to the territory ceded to Hungary. Meanwhile, Jews with a net worth of over 500,000 Czechoslovak koruna (Kƒçs) were arrested in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent capital flight. Between 4 and 7 November, 4,000 or 7,600 Jews were deported, in a chaotic, pogrom-like operation in which the Hlinka Guard, the , and the German Party participated. The deportees included young children, the elderly, and pregnant women. A few days later, Tiso canceled the operation; most of the Jews were allowed to return home in December. More than 800 were confined to makeshift tent camps at Veƒæk√Ω K√Ωr, Miloslavov, and ≈†amor√≠n on the new Slovak‚ÄìHungarian border during the winter. The Slovak deportations occurred just after Germany's deportation of thousands of Polish Jews, attracted international criticism, reduced British investment, increased dependence on German capital, and were a rehearsal for the 1942 deportations. Temporary passport issued in 1940 to a Jew who fled to Italy Initially, many Jews believed that the measures taken against them would be temporary. Nevertheless, some attempted to emigrate and take their property with them. Between December 1938 and February 1939, more than 2.25 million Kƒçs were transferred illegally to the Czech lands, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom; further amounts were transferred legally. Slovak government officials took advantage of the circumstances to purchase the property of wealthy Jewish emigrants at a significant discount, a precursor to the state-sponsored transfer of Jewish property as part of Aryanization. Interest in emigration among Jews surged after the invasion of Poland, as Jewish refugees from Poland told of atrocities there. Although the Slovak government encouraged Jews to emigrate, it refused to allow the export of foreign currency, ensuring that most attempts remained unsuccessful. No country was eager to accept Jewish refugees, and the tight limits imposed by the United Kingdom on legal emigration to Mandatory Palestine prevented Jews from seeking refuge there. In 1940, Bratislava became a hub for operatives organizing illegal immigration to Palestine, one of whom, Aron Gr√ºnhut, helped 1,365 Slovak, Czech, Hungarian, and Austrian Jews emigrate. By early 1941, further emigration was impossible; even Jews who received valid United States visas were not allowed transit visas through Germany. The total number of Slovak Jewish emigrants has been estimated at 5,000 to 6,000. As 45,000 lived in the areas ceded to Hungary, the 1940 census found that 89,000 Jews lived in the Slovak State, 3.4 percent of the population. = Aryanization = Aryanization in Slovakia, the seizure of Jewish-owned property and exclusion of Jews from the economy, was justified by the stereotype (reinforced by HSƒΩS propaganda) of Jews obtaining their wealth by oppressing Slovaks. Between 1939 and 1942, the HSƒΩS regime received widespread popular support by promising Slovak citizens that they would be enriched by property confiscated from Jews and other minorities. They stood to gain a significant amount of money; in 1940, Jews registered more than 4.322 billion Slovak koruna (Ks) in property (38 percent of the national wealth). The process is also described as \\"Slovakization\\", as the Slovak government took steps to ensure that ethnic Slovaks, rather than Germans or other minorities, received the stolen Jewish property. Due to the intervention of the German Party and Nazi Germany, ethnic Germans received 8.3 percent of the stolen property, but most German applicants were refused, underscoring the freedom of action of the Slovak government. The first anti-Jewish law, passed on 18 April 1939 and not systematically enforced, was a four-percent quota of the numbers of Jews allowed to practice law; Jews were also forbidden to write for non-Jewish publications. The Land Reform Act of February 1940 turned of land owned by 4,943 Jews, more than 40 percent of it arable, over to the State Land Office; the land officially passed to the state in May 1942. The First Aryanization Law was passed in April 1940. Through a process known as \\"voluntary Aryanization\\", Jewish business owners could suggest a \\"qualified Christian candidate\\" who would assume at least a 51-percent stake in the company. Under the law, 50 businesses out of more than 12,000 were Aryanized and 179 were liquidated. HSƒΩS radicals and the Slovak State's German backers believed that voluntary Aryanization was too soft on the Jews. Nevertheless, by mid-1940 the position of Jews in the Slovak economy had been largely wiped out. Tiso and Adolf Hitler at the Salzburg Conference, 1940 At the July 1940 Salzburg Conference, Germany demanded the replacement of several members of the cabinet with reliably pro-German radicals. Ferdinand ƒéurƒçansk√Ω was replaced as interior minister by Alexander Mach, who aligned the anti-Jewish policy of the Slovak State with that of Germany. Another result of the Salzburg talks was the appointment of SS officer Dieter Wisliceny as an adviser on Jewish affairs for Slovakia, arriving in August. He aimed to impoverish the Jewish community so it would become a burden on non-Jewish Slovaks, who would then agree to deport them. At Wisliceny's instigation, the Slovak government created the Central Economic Office (√öH√ö), led by Slovak official and under Tuka's control, in September 1940. The Central Economic Office was tasked with assuming ownership of Jewish-owned property. Jews were required to register their property; their bank accounts (valued at 245 million Ks in August 1941) were frozen, and Jews were allowed to withdraw only 1,000 Ks (later 150 Ks) per week. The 22,000 Jews who worked in salaried employment were targeted: non-Jews had to obtain Central Economic Office permission to employ Jews and pay a fee. A second Aryanization law was passed in November, mandating the expropriation of Jewish property and the Aryanization or liquidation of Jewish businesses. In a corrupt process overseen by Mor√°vek's office, 10,000 Jewish businesses (mostly shops) were liquidated and the remainder ‚Äì about 2,300 ‚Äì were Aryanized. Liquidation benefited small Slovak businesses competing with Jewish enterprises, and Aryanization was applied to larger Jewish-owned companies which were acquired by competitors. In many cases, Aryanizers inexpert in business struck deals with former Jewish owners and employees so the Jews would keep working for the company. The Aryanization of businesses did not bring the anticipated revenue into the Slovak treasury, and only 288 of the liquidated businesses produced income for the state by July 1942. The Aryanization and liquidation of businesses was nearly complete by January 1942, resulting in 64,000 of 89,000 Jews losing their means of support. Manufactured Jewish impoverishment was a pressing social problem for the Slovak government until unemployed Jews were deported in 1942. Aryanization resulted in immense financial loss for Slovakia and great destruction of wealth. The state failed to raise substantial funds from the sale of Jewish property and businesses, and most of its gains came from the confiscation of Jewish-owned bank accounts and financial securities. The main beneficiaries of Aryanization were members of Slovak fascist political parties and paramilitary groups, who were eager to acquire Jewish property but had little expertise in running businesses. During the Slovak Republic's existence, the government gained 1,100 million Ks from Aryanization and spent 900‚Äì950 million Ks on enforcing anti-Jewish measures. In 1942, it paid the German government another 300 million Ks for the deportation of 58,000 Jews. = Jewish Center = When Wisliceny arrived, all Jewish community organizations were dissolved and the Jews were forced to form the √östred≈àa ≈Ωidov (Jewish Center, √ö≈Ω, subordinate to the Central Economic Office) in September 1940. The first outside the Reich and German-occupied Poland, the √ö≈Ω was the only secular Jewish organization allowed to exist in Slovakia; membership was required of all Jews. Leaders of the Jewish community were divided about how to respond to this development. Although some argued that the √ö≈Ω would be used to implement anti-Jewish measures, more saw participation in the √ö≈Ω as a way to help their fellow Jews by delaying the implementation of such measures and alleviating poverty. The first leader of the √ö≈Ω was Heinrich Schwartz, who thwarted anti-Jewish orders to the best of his ability: he sabotaged a census of Jews in eastern Slovakia which was intended to justify their removal to the west of the country; Wisliceny had him arrested in April 1941. The Central Economic Office appointed the more cooperative Arpad Sebestyen as Schwartz's replacement. Wisliceny set up a Department for Special Affairs in the √ö≈Ω to ensure the prompt implementation of Nazi decrees, appointing the collaborationist Karol Hochberg (a Viennese Jew) as its director. = Forced labor = Restored barracks at Sereƒè concentration camp Jews serving in the army were segregated into a labor unit in April 1939, and were stripped of their rank at the end of the year. From 1940, male Jews and Romani people were obliged to work for the national defense (generally manual labor on construction projects) for two months every year. All recruits considered Jewish or Romani were allocated to the Sixth Labor Battalion, which worked at military construction sites at Sabinov, Liptovsk√Ω Sv√§t√Ω Peter, L√°b, Sv√§t√Ω Jur, and Zohor the following year. Although the Ministry of Defense was pressured by the Ministry of the Interior to release the Jews for deportation in 1942, it refused. The battalion was disbanded in 1943, and the Jewish laborers were sent to work camps. The first labor centers were established in early 1941 by the √ö≈Ω as retraining courses for Jews forced into unemployment; 13,612 Jews had applied for the courses by February, far exceeding the programs' capacity. On 4 July, the Slovak government issued a decree conscripting all Jewish men aged 18 to 60 for labor. Although the √ö≈Ω had to supplement the workers' pay to meet the legal minimum, the labor camps greatly increased the living standard of Jews impoverished by Aryanization. By September, 5,500 Jews were performing manual labor for private companies at about 80 small labor centers, most of which were dissolved in the final months of 1941 as part of the preparation for deportation. Construction began on three larger camps ‚Äì Sereƒè, Nov√°ky, and Vyhne ‚Äì in September of that year. = Jewish Code = Headline of 21 September 1941 propaganda-ministry publication: \\"We've dealt with the Jews! The strictest laws against Jews are Slovakia's.\\" In accordance with Catholic teaching on race, antisemitic laws initially defined Jews by religion rather than ancestry; Jews who were baptized before 1918 were considered Christian. By September 1940, Jews were banned from secondary and higher education and from all non-Jewish schools, and forbidden from owning motor vehicles, sports equipment, or radios. Local authorities had imposed anti-Jewish measures on their own; the head of the ≈†ari≈°-Zempl√≠n region ordered local Jews to wear a yellow band around their left arm from 5 April 1941, leading to physical attacks against Jews. In mid-1941, as the focus shifted to restricting Jews' civil rights after they had been deprived of their property through Aryanization, Department 14 of the Ministry of the Interior was formed to enforce anti-Jewish measures. The Slovak parliament passed the Jewish Code on 9 September 1941, which contained 270 anti-Jewish articles. Based on the Nuremberg Laws, the code defined Jews in terms of ancestry, banned intermarriage, and required that all Jews over six years old wear a yellow star. The Jewish Code excluded Jews from public life, restricting the hours that they were allowed to travel and shop, and barring them from clubs, organizations, and public events. Jews also had to pay a 20-percent tax on all property. Government propaganda boasted that the Jewish Code was the strictest set of anti-Jewish laws in Europe. The president could issue exemptions protecting individual Jews from the law. Employed Jews were initially exempt from some of the code's requirements, such as wearing the star. The racial definition of Jews was criticized by the Catholic Church, and converts were eventually exempted from some of the requirements. The Hlinka Guard and increased assaults on Jews, engaged in antisemitic demonstrations on a daily basis, and harassed non-Jews judged insufficiently antisemitic. The law enabled the Central Economic Office to force Jews to change their residence. This provision was put into effect on 4 October 1941, when 10,000 of 15,000 Jews in Bratislava (who were not employed or intermarried) were ordered to move to fourteen towns. The relocation was paid for and carried out by the √ö≈Ω's Department of Special Tasks. Although the Jews were ordered to leave by 31 December, fewer than 7,000 people had moved by March 1942.  Deportations (1942)  =Planning= Jews forced to dig their own graves in Zboriv, Ukraine, 4 July 1941 The highest levels of the Slovak government were aware by late 1941 of mass murders of Jews in German-occupied territories. In July 1941, Wisliceny organized a visit by Slovak government officials to several camps run by Organization Schmelt, which imprisoned Jews in East Upper Silesia to employ them in forced labor on the Reichsautobahn. The visitors understood that Jews in the camps lived under conditions which would eventually cause their deaths. Slovak soldiers participated in the invasions of Poland and the Soviet Union; they brought word of the mass shootings of Jews, and participated in at least one of the massacres. Some Slovaks were aware of the 1941 Kamianets-Podilskyi massacre, in which 23,600 Jews, many of them deported from Hungary, were shot in western Ukraine. Defense minister Ferdinand ƒåatlo≈° and General Jozef Turanec reported massacres in Zhytomyr to Tiso by February 1942. Both bishop Karol Kme≈•ko and papal Giuseppe Burzio confronted the president with reliable reports of the mass murder of Jewish civilians in the Ukraine. However, the Slovak government was not aware of the Nazi plan to murder all Jews. In mid-1941, the Germans demanded (per previous agreements) another 20,000 Slovak laborers to work in Germany. Slovakia refused to send gentile Slovaks and instead offered an equal number of Jewish workers, although it did not want to be burdened with their families. A letter sent on 15 October 1941 indicates that plans were being made for the mass murder of Jews in the Lublin District of the General Government to make room for deported Jews from Slovakia and Germany. In late October, Tiso, Tuka, Mach, and ƒåatlo≈° visited the Wolf's Lair (near Rastenburg, East Prussia) and met with Adolf Hitler. No record survives of this meeting, at which the deportation of Jews from Slovakia was probably first discussed, leading to historiographical debate over who proposed the idea. Even if the Germans made the offer, the Slovak decision was not motivated by German pressure. In November 1941, the Slovak government permitted the German government to deport the 659 Slovak Jews living in the Reich and the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia to German-occupied Poland, with the proviso that their confiscated property be passed to Slovakia. This was the first step towards deporting Jews from Slovakia, which Tuka discussed with Wisliceny in early 1942. As indicated by a cable from the German ambassador to Slovakia, Hanns Ludin, the Slovaks responded \\"with enthusiasm\\" to the idea. Tuka presented the deportation proposals to the government on 3 March, and they were debated in parliament three days later. On 15 May, parliament approved Decree 68/1942, which retroactively legalized the deportation of Jews, authorized the removal of their citizenship, and regulated exemptions. Opposition centered on economic, moral, and legal obstacles, but, as Mach later stated, \\"every [legislator] who has spoken on this issue has said that we should get rid of Jews\\". The official Catholic representative and Bishop of Spi≈°, J√°n Vojta≈°≈°√°k, only requested separate settlements in Poland for Jews who had converted to Christianity. The Slovaks agreed to pay 500 Reichsmarks per Jew deported (ostensibly to cover shelter, food, retraining and housing) and an additional fee to the for transport. The 500 Reichsmark fee was equivalent to about USD$125 at the time, or $ today. The Germans promised in exchange that the Jews would never return, and Slovakia could keep all confiscated property. Except for the Independent State of Croatia (which paid 30 Reichsmarks per person), Slovakia was the only country which paid to deport its Jewish population. =First phase= Restored train car used to transport Slovak Jews. S≈Ω stands for Slovensk√© ≈Ωeleznice (Slovak Railways). The original deportation plan, approved in February 1942, entailed the deportation of 7,000 women to Auschwitz and 13,000 men to Majdanek as forced laborers. Department 14 organized the deportations, while the Slovak Transport Ministry provided the cattle cars. Lists of those to be deported were drawn up by Department 14 based on statistical data provided by the Jewish Center's Department for Special Tasks. At the border station in Zwardon, the Hlinka Guard handed the transports off to the German . Slovak officials promised that deportees would be allowed to return home after a fixed period, and many Jews initially believed that it was better to report for deportation rather than risk reprisals against their families. On 25 March 1942, the first transport departed from Poprad transit camp for Auschwitz with 1,000 unmarried Jewish women between the ages of 16 and 45. During the first wave of deportations (which ended on 2 April), 6,000 young, single Jews were deported to Auschwitz and Majdanek. Members of the Hlinka Guard, the , and the gendarmerie were in charge of rounding up the Jews, guarding the transit centers, and eventually forcing them into train cars for deportation. A German officer was stationed at each of the concentration centers. Official exemptions were supposed to keep certain Jews from being deported, but local authorities sometimes deported exemption-holders. The victims were given only four hours' warning, to prevent them from escaping. Beatings and forcible shaving were commonplace, as was subjecting Jews to invasive searches to uncover hidden valuables. Although some guards and local officials accepted bribes to keep Jews off the transports, the victim would typically be deported on the next train. Others took advantage of their power to rape Jewish women. Jews were only allowed to bring of personal items with them, but even this was frequently stolen. =Family transports= Reinhard Heydrich, the head of the Reich Main Security Office, visited Bratislava on 10 April, and he and Tuka agreed that further deportations would target whole families and eventually remove all Jews from Slovakia. The family transports began on 11 April, and took their victims to the Lublin District. During the first half of June 1942 ten transports stopped briefly at Majdanek, where able-bodied men were selected for labor; the trains continued to Sobibor extermination camp, where the remaining victims were murdered. Most of the trains brought their victims (30,000 in total) to ghettos whose inhabitants had been recently deported to the Be≈Ç≈ºec or Sobibor extermination camps. Some groups stayed only briefly before they were deported again to the extermination camps, while other groups remained in the ghettos for months or years. Some of the deportees ended up in the forced-labor camps in the Lublin District (such as Poniatowa, Dƒôblin‚ÄìIrena, and Krych√≥w). Unusually, the deportees in the Lublin District were quickly able to establish contact with the Jews remaining in Slovakia, which led to extensive aid efforts. The fate of the Jews deported from Slovakia was ultimately \\"sealed within the framework of Operation Reinhard\\" along with that of the Polish Jews, in the words of Yehoshua B√ºchler. Trenches at Majdanek where Jews were shot during Operation Harvest Festival on 3 November 1943. Transports went to Auschwitz after mid-June, where a minority of the victims were selected for labor and the remainder were killed in the gas chambers. This occurred for nine transports, the last of which arrived on 21 October 1942. From 1 August to 18 September, no transports departed; most of the Jews not exempt from deportation had already been deported or had fled to Hungary. In mid-August, Tiso gave a speech in Holiƒç in which he described Jews as the \\"eternal enemy\\" and justified the deportations according to Christian ethics. At this time of the speech, the Slovak government had accurate information on the mass murder of the deportees from Slovakia; an official request to inspect the camps where Slovak Jews were held in Poland was denied by Eichmann. Three more transports occurred in September and October 1942 before ceasing until 1944. By the end of 1942, only 500 or 600 Slovak Jews were still alive at Auschwitz. Thousands of surviving Slovak Jews in the Lublin District were shot on 3‚Äì4 November 1943 during Operation Harvest Festival. Between 25 March and 20 October 1942, almost 58,000 Jews (two-thirds of the population) were deported. The exact number is unknown due to discrepancies in the sources. The deportations disproportionately affected poorer Jews from eastern Slovakia. Although the ≈†ari≈°-Zempl√≠n region in eastern Slovakia lost 85 to 90 percent of its Jewish population, ≈Ωilina reported that almost half of its Jews remained after the deportation. The deportees were held briefly in five camps in Slovakia before deportation; 26,384 from ≈Ωilina, 7,500 from Patr√≥nka, 7,000 from Poprad, 4,463 from Sereƒè, and 4,000 to 5,000 from Nov√°ky. Nineteen trains went to Auschwitz, and another thirty-eight went to ghettos and concentration and extermination camps in the Lublin District. Only a few hundred survived the war, most at Auschwitz; almost no one survived in Lublin District. = Opposition, exemption, and evasion = The Holy See opposed deportation, fearing that such actions from a Catholic government would discredit the church. Domenico Tardini, Vatican Undersecretary of State, wrote in a private memo: \\"Everyone understands that the Holy See cannot stop Hitler. But who can understand that it does not know how to rein in a priest?\\" According to a Security Service (SD) report, Burzio threatened Tiso with an interdict. Slovak bishops were equivocal, endorsing Jewish deicide and other antisemitic myths while urging Catholics to treat Jews humanely. The Catholic Church ultimately chose not to discipline any of the Slovak Catholics who were complicit in the regime's actions. Officials from the √ö≈Ω and several of the most influential Slovak rabbis sent petitions to Tiso, but he did not reply. Ludin reported that the deportations were \\"very unpopular\\", but few Slovaks took action against them. By March 1942, the Working Group (an underground organization which operated under the auspices of the √ö≈Ω) had formed to oppose the deportations. Its leaders, Zionist organizer Gisi Fleischmann and Orthodox rabbi Michael Dov Weissmandl, bribed Anton Va≈°ek, head of Department 14, and Wisliceny. It is unknown if the group's efforts had any connection with the halting of deportations. Many Jews learned about the fate awaiting them during the first half of 1942, from sources such as letters from deported Jews or escapees. Around 5,000 to 6,000 Jews fled to Hungary to avoid the deportations, many by paying bribes or with help from paid smugglers and the Zionist youth movement Hashomer Hatzair; about one third of those who fled to Hungary survived the war. Many owners of Aryanized businesses applied for work exemptions for the Jewish former owners. In some cases this was a fictitious Aryanization; other Aryanizers, motivated by profit, kept the Jewish former owners around for their skills. About 2,000 Jews had false papers identifying themselves as Aryans. Some Christian clergy baptized Jews, even those who were not sincere converts. Although conversion after 1939 did not exempt Jews from deportation, being baptized made it easier to obtain other exemptions and some clergy edited records to predate baptisms. After the deportations, between 22,000 and 25,000 Jews were still in Slovakia. Some 16,000 Jews had exemptions; there were 4,217 converts to Christianity before 1939, at least 985 Jews in mixed marriages, and 9,687 holders of economic exemptions (particularly doctors, pharmacists, engineers, and agricultural experts, whose professions had shortages). One thousand Jews were protected by presidential exemptions, mostly in addition to other exemptions. As well as the exempted Jews, around 2,500 were interned in labor camps, and a thousand were serving in the Sixth Labor Battalion. When the deportations were halted, the government knew the whereabouts of only 2,500 Jews without exemptions. Hiatus (1943) During 1943, enforcement of anti-Jewish laws lessened, and many Jews stopped wearing the yellow star. Nevertheless, the remaining Jews ‚Äì even those with exemptions ‚Äì lived in constant fear of deportation. The √ö≈Ω worked to improve conditions for laborers in the Slovak camps and to increase productivity, to strengthen the incentive to keep their workers in Slovakia. In 1943, the labor camps earned 39 million Ks for the Slovak State. The halt in deportations from Slovakia enabled the Working Group to launch the Europa Plan, an unsuccessful effort to bribe SS chief Heinrich Himmler to spare the surviving Jews under German occupation. It also smuggled aid to Jews in Poland, and helped Polish Jews escape to Hungary via Slovakia. In late April 1944 two Auschwitz escapees, Rudolf Vrba and Alfred Wetzler, reached Slovakia. The Working Group sent their report to Hungary and Switzerland; it reached the Western Allies in July. After the Battle of Stalingrad and other reversals in the increasingly unpopular war in the east, Slovak politicians realized that a German defeat was likely. Some HSƒΩS politicians (especially those in the radical faction) blamed economic setbacks on the Jews and agitated for the deportation of the remaining population. On 7 February 1943, Mach announced at a rally in Ru≈æomberok that the transports would soon resume. In early 1943, the Hlinka Guard and Department 14 prepared for the resumption of deportations: registering Jews, canceling economic exemptions, and hunting down Jews in hiding. A plan to dispatch four trains between 18 and 22 April was not implemented. In response to the threatened resumption, Slovak bishops issued a pastoral letter in Latin on 8 March condemning antisemitism and totalitarianism and defending the rights of all Jews. Germany put increasing pressure on the Slovak State to hand over its remaining Jews in 1943 and 1944, but Slovak politicians did not agree to resume the deportations. Jews from Carpathian Ruthenia arrive at Auschwitz, May 1944 In late 1943, leading army officers and intelligentsia formed the Slovak National Council to plan an insurrection; the council united both Communist and democratic opponents of the regime. Other anti-fascists retreated to the Carpathian mountains and formed partisan groups. Preparations for the uprising evoked mixed feelings in the remaining Slovak Jews, who feared that an uprising would bring about a crackdown on their community. Underground groups organized at the Sereƒè and Nov√°ky labor camps. Slovak authorities began to re-register Jews in January 1944, prompting some to flee to Hungary. On 19 March 1944 Germany invaded Hungary, including Carpathian Ruthenia and the areas ceded by Czechoslovakia in 1938. The Slovak Jews who had fled to Hungary tried to return, but many were arrested at the border and deported directly to Auschwitz. The Slovak ambassador in Budapest, J√°n Spi≈°iak, issued documents to 3,000 Jews allowing them to legally cross the border, bringing the total number of Jews in Slovakia to 25,000. Between 14 May and 7 July 437,000 Jews were deported from Hungary, most to Auschwitz; including many Slovak Jews in the country. To counter the perceived security threat of Jews in the ≈†ari≈°-Zempl√≠n region with the front line moving westward, on 15 May 1944 the Slovak government ordered Jews to move to the western part of the country.  Resumption of deportations (1944‚Äì1945)  = German invasion = Situation during the first days of the Slovak National Uprising Concerned about the increase in resistance, Germany invaded Slovakia; this precipitated the Slovak National Uprising, which broke out on 29 August 1944. The insurgent forces seized central Slovakia but were defeated on 27 October at Bansk√° Bystrica. Partisans withdrew to the mountains and continued their guerrilla campaign into 1945. A new government was sworn in, with Jozef Tiso's cousin ≈†tefan as prime minister; Jozef remained president. The papal Burzio met with Tiso on 22 and 29 September, reportedly calling Tiso a liar when the president denied knowledge of deportations. Pius XII instructed Burzio to tell Tiso that the Vatican condemned the persecution of individuals for their race or nationality. The United States and Switzerland issued formal protests against the deportation of Jews. Slovak propaganda blamed the Jews and Czechs for the uprising. Nevertheless, the Slovak government preferred the concentration of Jews in concentration camps in Slovakia to their deportation. Tiso asked for the Germans to spare at least baptized Jews and those in mixed marriages, but his requests were ignored. The uprising provided the Germans with an opportunity to implement the Final Solution in Slovakia. Anti-Jewish actions were nominally controlled by the Slovak Ministry of Defense, but in practice the Germans dictated policy. Unlike the deportations of 1942, the roundups of Jews were organized and carried out by German forces. SS officer Alois Brunner, who had participated in the organization of transports of Jews from France and Greece, arrived in Slovakia to arrange the deportation of the country's remaining Jews. The SS unit Einsatzgruppe H, including Einsatzkommandos 13, 14, and 29, was formed to suppress the uprising immediately after it began and round up Jews and Romani people. Local collaborators, including (HS), and the Hlinka Guard Emergency Divisions (POHG), were essential to Einsatzgruppe H's work. Collaborators denounced those in hiding, impersonated partisans, and aided with interrogations. After the uprising began, thousands of Jews fled to the mountainous interior and partisan-controlled areas around Bansk√° Bystrica, including many who left the labor camps after the guards fled. Around 1,600 to 2,000 Jews fought as partisans, ten percent of the total insurgent force, although many hid their identity due to antisemitism in the partisan movement. Anti-Jewish legislation in the liberated areas was canceled by the Slovak National Council, but the attitude of the local population varied: some risked their lives to hide Jews, and others turned them in to the police. Unlike in 1942, the death penalty was in effect for rescuers; the majority provided help for a fee, although there were also cases of selfless rescues. Many Jews spent six to eight months in makeshift shelters or bunkers in the mountains, while others hid in the houses of non-Jews. Regardless, Jews required money for six to eight months of living expenses and the help of non-Jews willing to provide assistance. Some of the Jews in shelters had to return home later in the winter, risking capture, because of the hunger and cold. Living openly and continuing to work under false papers was typically only possible in Bratislava. = Roundups = Jews who were captured were briefly imprisoned at local prisons or the Einsatzgruppe H office in Bratislava, from which they were sent to Sereƒè for deportation. Local authorities provided lists of Jews, and many local residents also denounced Jews. In the first half of September there were large-scale raids in Topoƒæƒçany (3 September), Trenƒç√≠n, and Nitra (7 September), during which 616 Jews were arrested and imprisoned in Ilava and Sereƒè. In ≈Ωilina, Einsatzkommando 13 and collaborators arrested hundreds of Jews over the night of 13/14 September. The victims were deported to Sereƒè or Ilava and thence to Auschwitz, where most were murdered. Einsatzgruppe H reported that some Jews were able to escape because of insufficient personnel, but that both Germans and Slovaks generally supported the roundups and helped track down evaders. After the defeat of the uprising, the German forces also hunted the Jews hiding in the mountains. Although most victims were arrested during the first two months of occupation, the hunt for the Jews continued until 30 March 1945, when a Jewish prisoner was taken to Sereƒè just three days before the camp was liberated. Some Jews had been arrested in Bratislava by 20 September. The largest roundup was carried out in the city during the night of 28/29 September by Einsatzkommando 29, aided by 600 HS and POHG collaborators and a Luftwaffe unit that guarded the streets: around 1,600 Jews were arrested and taken to Sereƒè. The United States embassy organized protection for some 300 Jews with foreign citizenship, housing them in a castle in Marianka. Brunner raided the castle on 11 October; all but three of the prisoners were taken to Sereƒè and deported to Auschwitz on 17 October. In mid-October, an office was established at the former Jewish Center to hunt down Jews in hiding, which tortured captured Jews into revealing the names and addresses of other Jews. The one to two thousand Jews left in Bratislava were ordered to turn themselves in on 20 November or face imprisonment, but few did so. Half of the Jews arrested after 19 November were in Bratislava, most in hiding with false papers. Henri Dunand of the Red Cross provided funding for a clandestine group led by Arnold Lazar, which provided money, food, and clothing to Jews in hiding in Bratislava. =Deportation= Jewish women and children from Carpathian Ruthenia walking towards the gas chambers Sereƒè concentration camp was the primary facility for interning Jews before their deportation. Although there were no transports until the end of September, the Jews experienced harsh treatment (including rape and murder) and severe overcrowding as the population swelled to 3,000 ‚Äì more than twice the intended capacity. Brunner took over the camp's administration from the Slovak government at the end of September. About 11,700 people were deported on eleven transports; the first five (from 30 September to 17 October) went to Auschwitz, where most of the victims were gassed. The final transport to Auschwitz, on 2 November, arrived after the gas chambers were shut down. Later transports left for Sachsenhausen, Bergen-Belsen, Ravensbr√ºck, and Theresienstadt. Two small transports left ƒåadca for Auschwitz on 1 and 5 September; Fatran estimates that the total number of deportees was about 400. In September and October, at least 131 people were deported from Slovakia via Zakopane; two of the transports ended at Krak√≥w-P≈Çasz√≥w and the third at Auschwitz. A transport from Pre≈°ov, departing 26 November, ended up at Ravensbr√ºck. According to a Czechoslovak criminal investigation, another 800 Jews were deported in two transports from eastern Slovakia on 16 October and 16 December. Details on the transports leaving from locations other than Sereƒè is fragmentary, and the total number of deportees is not known. Slovak historian Ivan Kamenec estimated that 13,500 Jews were deported in 1944 and 1945, of whom 10,000 died, but Israeli historian Gila Fatran and Czech historian Lenka ≈†indel√°≈ôov√° consider that 14,150 deportees can be verified and the true figure may be higher. The Slovak regime also transferred several hundred political prisoners to German custody. Deported to Mauthausen concentration camp, many died there. = Massacres = After the German invasion, about 4,000 people were murdered in Slovakia, mostly by Einsatzgruppe H, but with help from local collaborators. About half (2,000) of the victims were Jews; other victims included partisans, supporters of the uprising, and Romani people. One of the first executions occurred in the Topoƒæƒçany district, where Einsatzkommando 14 began its mass roundups of Jews. Many of the arrested Jews were taken to Sereƒè for deportation, but 53 were shot in Nemƒçice on 11 September. The largest execution was in Kremniƒçka, a small village away from Bansk√° Bystrica. Upon the capture of the rebel stronghold, Jews, partisans, Romanis, and others arrested in the area were held in the prison in the town. Of these, 743 people were brought to Kremniƒçka for execution in a series of massacres between November and March, by Einsatzgruppe H and the POHG. Victims included 280 women and 99 children; half were Jewish. Hundreds of people were murdered at the nearby village of Nemeck√°, where the victims' bodies were burned after they were shot. Zvolen's Jewish cemetery was used as an execution site; 218 bodies were exhumed after the end of the war.  Aftermath  Names of murdered Jews at the former Sereƒè concentration camp The Red Army captured Slovakia by the end of April 1945. Around 69,000 Jews, 77 percent of the prewar population, had been murdered. In addition to the 10,000 to 11,000 Jews who survived in Slovakia, 9,000 Jews returned who had been deported to concentration camps or fled abroad, and 10,000 Jews survived in the Hungarian- annexed territories. By the end of 1945, 33,000 Jews were living in Slovakia. Many survivors had lost their entire families, and a third suffered from tuberculosis. Although a postwar Czechoslovak law negated property transactions arising from Nazi persecution, the autonomous Slovak government refused to apply it. Heirless property was nationalized in 1947 into the Currency Liquidation Fund. Those who had stolen Jewish property were reluctant to return it; former resistance members had also appropriated some stolen property. Conflict over restitution led to intimidation and violent attacks, including the September 1945 Topoƒæƒçany pogrom and the Partisan Congress riots in August 1946. Polish historian Anna Cichopek-Gajraj estimates that at least 36 Jews were murdered and more than 100 injured in postwar violence. , the commander of Einsatzgruppe H, committed suicide in 1946 during extradition to Czechoslovakia; Wisliceny was tried, convicted and executed in Bratislava in 1948; and Brunner escaped justice in Syria. Tiso (who had fled to Austria) was extradited to Czechoslovakia, convicted of treason and collaboration, sentenced to death on 15 April 1947, and executed three days later. According to the court, his \\"most immoral, most unchristian, and most inhuman\\" action was ordering the deportation of the Slovak Jews. Other perpetrators, including Tuka, were also tried, convicted, and executed. Both Tiso and Tuka were tried under Decree 33/1945, an law that mandated the death penalty for the suppression of the Slovak National Uprising; their roles in the Holocaust were a subset of the crimes for which they were convicted. The authors of some of the more egregious antisemitic articles and caricatures were prosecuted after the war. The trials painted Slovak State officials as traitors, thereby exonerating Slovak society from responsibility for the Holocaust. The Czechoslovak government supported Zionism, insisting that Jews assimilate into Czechoslovak culture or emigrate to Palestine. Jews who had declared German or Hungarian nationality on a prewar census were stripped of their citizenship, losing any right to restitution, and were threatened with deportation. Most Jews in Slovakia emigrated to Israel or other countries in the years after the war. Emigration accelerated in 1948 after the Communist coup and nationalization of many businesses after the war. The number of Jewish communities decreased from the postwar high of 126 to 25, while the population decreased by 80 percent. Only a few thousand Jews were left by the end of 1949. Many of those who chose to stay changed their surnames and abandoned religious practice to fit in with the Slovak middle class. In 2019, the Jewish population was estimated at 2,000 to 3,000. Legacy Holocaust Memorial at Rybn√© n√°mestie in Bratislava The government's attitude to Jews and Zionism shifted after 1948, leading to the 1952 Sl√°nsk√Ω trial in which the Czechoslovak government accused fourteen Communists (eleven of them Jewish) of belonging to a Zionist conspiracy. Political censorship hampered the study of the Holocaust, and memorials to the victims of fascism did not mention Jews. In the 1960s, which were characterized by a liberalization known as the Prague Spring, discussion of the Holocaust opened up. The Academy Award-winning 1965 film, The Shop on Main Street, focused on Slovak culpability for the Holocaust. Following the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, authorities cracked down on free expression, while anti-Zionist propaganda, much of it imported from the Soviet Union, intensified and veered into antisemitism after Israeli victory in the 1967 Six-Day War. A nationalist resurgence followed the fall of the Communist regime in 1989, leading to the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993 and the nationalist Meƒçiar government. After Meƒçiar's fall in 1998, the Slovak government promoted Holocaust remembrance to demonstrate the country's European identity before it joined the European Union in 2004. During the 1990s, many memorials were constructed to commemorate Holocaust victims, and in October 2001 Slovakia designated 9 September (the anniversary of the passage of the Jewish Code) as Holocaust Victims and Racial Hatred Day. The National Memory Institute was established in 2002 to provide access to the records of both the Slovak State and Communist state. The post-Communist government enacted laws for the restitution of Jewish property, but residency and citizenship requirements prevented emigrants from filing claims. In 2002, ten percent of the value of the nationalized heirless property was released into a fund that paid for Jewish education and Holocaust memorials. , Yad Vashem (the official Israeli memorial to the Holocaust) has recognized 602 Slovaks as Righteous Among the Nations for risking their lives to save Jews. Holocaust relativism in Slovakia tends to manifest as attempts to absolve the Tiso government of blame by deflecting responsibility onto Germans and Jews. A 1997 textbook by Milan Stanislav ƒéurica and endorsed by the government sparked international controversy (and was eventually withdrawn from the school curriculum) because it portrayed Jews as living happily in labor camps during the war. Tiso and the Slovak State have been the focus of Catholic and ultranationalist commemorations. The neo-Nazi Kotleba party, which is represented in the national parliament and the European Parliament and is especially popular with younger voters, promotes a positive view of the Slovak State. Its leader, Marian Kotleba, once described Jews as \\"devils in human skin\\". Members of the party have been charged with Holocaust denial, which has been a criminal offense since 2001.

The focal point of the Cabellera vs. Cabellera series of shows is one or more traditional Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"Bet matches\\", where all competitors in the match risk their hair on the outcome of the match. The Lucha de Apuestas is considered the most prestigious match type in lucha libre, especially when a wrestlers mask is on the line, but the \\"hair vs. hair\\" stipulation is held in almost as high regard. For the June 2018 Cabellera vs. Cabellera event the recently unmasked Black Dragon defeated Oficial Spartan by disqualification, forcing Spartan to have all his hair shaved off as a result. Black Dragon would later go on to headline and win the February show. The show also featured Emperador Azteca successfully defending the IWRG Intercontinental Welterweight Championship against Cerebro Negro. The show featured five additional bouts. Production =Background= In Lucha libre the wrestling mask holds a sacred place, with the most anticipated and prestigious matches being those where a wrestler's mask is on the line, a so- called Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"bet match\\" where the loser would be forced to unmask in the middle of the ring and state their birth name. Winning a mask is considered a bigger accomplishment in lucha libre than winning a professional wrestling championship and usually draws more people and press coverage. Losing a mask is often a watershed moment in a wrestler's career, they give up the mystique and prestige of being an enmascarado (masked wrestler) but usually come with a higher than usual payment from the promoter. By the same token a wrestler betting his hair in a Lucha de Apuestas is seen as highly prestigious, usually a step below the mask match. =Storylines= The event featured five professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

Days before her disappearance, she had accused four men of gang-raping her at a party she had attended. On October 25, 2015, she placed an erratic phone call to her older brother, Trevor; this was the last known contact anyone had with her. On October 27, her abandoned car was discovered in Chalamont Park in west Little Rock. Searches of the woods in the park were undertaken, but no sign of Steppach was found. She remained a missing person for nearly three years before her body was discovered in a drainage pipe in Chalamont Park in May 2018, in the immediate vicinity of where her car had been found. She was dead since the time her car was found. Her death has been classified as a homicide. Timeline =Background= Ebby Jane Steppach was an eighteen-year-old high school student in Little Rock, Arkansas who was completing her senior year at Little Rock Central High School. She had previously attended a private school, but transitioned to a public school that year. Wanting independence from her parents, Steppach decided to move out of her family's home at the beginning of the school year, but was mainly staying with her grandparents and friends. On October 21, 2015, Steppach missed school. On Friday, October 23, she attended a party at some point during the evening. The following day, October 24, 2015, Steppach arrived at her mother's home, and informed her stepfather that she had been gang raped by four individuals at the party and wanted to report the incident to authorities. She also alleged that the rape had been recorded on a cell phone. Later that evening, when Steppach's mother, Laurie Jernigan, and stepfather attempted to reach her by phone, they got no response; her stepfather suspected she had gone to retrieve the video of her rape. That evening, two brief calls lasting approximately one minute each were placed to the Little Rock Police Department from Steppach's cell phone, though the police department would state they had no record of receiving a report. Throughout the evening, cell phone records showed Steppach sent text messages to several of the men she had implicated in her rape, threatening to report them to police. =Disappearance= Steppach last had contact with her older brother, Trevor, around 2 p.m. on October 25, 2015, in a phone call. Trevor described her as seeming \\"disoriented\\" during their conversation. She initially told him she was parked outside his house, but upon hanging up and walking out to the street, he did not see her car. When he called her back, she answered, this time telling him she was in her car but was unsure where she was parked. After she told him \\"I'm fucked up,\\" the phone call ended. This was the last known contact anyone had with her. On October 27, Steppach's 2015 Volkswagen Passat was discovered by a security guard abandoned in a parking lot near a wooded area in Chalamont Park, a neighborhood park in west Little Rock. The security guard notified police and waited approximately 2 hours for an officer to arrive however none did. The next day after seeing the vehicle still there as he did his rounds he once again called and waited for police, who finally arrived around an hour later and discovered it belonged to Steppach. The car had an empty gas tank as well as a dead battery, and the key had been left in the ignition. =Investigation= Several searches of Chalamont Park were undertaken after the discovery of Steppach's car, though no additional evidence was found in the surrounding woods. Per a 2017 report, the men Steppach had accused of sexual assault had all spoken to police, though no formal searches of their cell phones were done for the alleged video of Steppach's rape. In an attempt to bring publicity to her case, Steppach's mother and brother Trevor appeared on Dr. Phil in December 2017. The Steppach family offered a reward of $50,000 with information leading to their daughter's discovery. = Discovery of body = Around 10 a.m. on May 24, 2018, while performing another search of Chalamont Park, police discovered skeletal remains in a drainage pipe in the vicinity where Steppach's car had been discovered. These remains were subsequently confirmed to be those of Steppach. Extensive searches for Steppach at Chalamont Park had been held in the past. Margie Foley, a family friend and mother of one of Steppach's best friends, claimed that she had smelled decomposition while doing a private search of the area, and alerted the authorities. Upon the arrival of police at the scene, Foley claimed she was \\"kind of dismissed by [the officers]\\", who told her the park had been searched with recovery canines who would have picked up on the scent of human decomposition, and assured her it \\"must be an animal or something\\".  Media depictions  In 2017, her case was profiled on the podcast The Vanished.

He was the Leader of the Opposition for the beginning of the Apollo Milton Obote government, and then he changed parties and was appointed to the powerful role of Ugandan Minister of Internal Affairs. He was imprisoned, tortured, and was one of the first political prisoners to be executed by the Idi Amin regime. Early life = Birth = Basil Kiiza Bataringaya was born in 1927, in the village of Kantojo, in the county of Igara, in the Bushenyi District of the Ugandan Protectorate. His father was Marko Kiiza, who was the Ssaza Chief of Bunyaruguru at the time. A Ssaza was the equivalent of a county in the newly created administration divisions after the absorption of the Ankole Kingdom in to the British Protectorate of Uganda, as a part of the Ankole Agreement of 1901. The Ankole Agreement set the boundaries of the Bunyaruguru Ssaza as \\"On the north-west by the Dweru Channel; on the east by the Chambura River, the recognized Bunyaruguru-lgara and Kamsura-Igara boundaries; on the south by the Rwenchwera River; on the west by Lake Albert Edward\\", and gave Bataringaya's father a powerful position in southwestern Uganda during the early 20th century. = Education = Bataringaya attended St. Leo's College, Kyegobe, a residential boys' secondary school of Catholic curriculum, located in Fort Portal, Kabarole District in the Western Region of Uganda from 1945 to 1947. He then attended the Government Teacher Training College of Uganda (TTC) from 1948 to 1949. He then attended Makerere University, Uganda's top university, from 1953 to 1956. It was at Makerere University that Bataringaya began his political career, becoming the University College Guild president for the 1955 to 1956 term. =Teaching career= After graduating from Makerere University, Bataringaya became a secondary school teacher. He taught at Ntare Secondary School, a residential single-sex all boy's secondary school located in Mbarara, Mbarara District, Uganda. He then became the school supervisor of the Ankole Catholic Schools from 1959 to 1961, when he was first elected to the Parliament of Uganda. Political career = Transitional Government = Bataringaya ran as a member of the Democratic Party of Uganda for the legislative seat for the Ankole District to the Uganda Legislative Council in the transitional government between the colonial-era Uganda Protectorate and the Republic of Uganda in the first Ugandan nationwide direct elections, the March 1961 Ugandan General Elections. Bataringaya quickly became popular within the Democratic Party of Uganda that controlled government following its win of 44 of the 82 contested seats, and Bataringaya was appointed to be the first Minister of Local Government for Uganda's first post-colonial independent government under Benedicto Kiwanuka. = Leader of the Opposition = Following agreements made by 48 Ugandan representatives at a September 1961 Constitutional Convention meeting in London, United Kingdom, the Ugandan Legislative Council of the transitional government between the colonial-era Uganda Protectorate and the Republic of Uganda became the Parliament of Uganda, which was then formally dissolved so that the 1962 Ugandan General election could occur on 25 April 1962, the first elections held under an entirely independent Ugandan government. Bataringaya ran again as a member of the Democratic Party of Uganda in his Ankole constituency and was reelected. Bataringaya lost his ministerial positions as a result of the election, as the Ugandan People's Congress won 37 of the 82 seats and formed an alliance with the Kabaka Yekka party that won 21 of 82 seats, giving this new alliance 58 of the 82 seats in the Parliament of Uganda, taking control away from the Democratic Party of Uganda who won 24 of the 82 seats and became the official party of the opposition.Nohlen, D, Krennerich, M & Thibaut, B (1999) Elections in Africa: A data handbook, p934 Bataringaya was recently elected Secretary General of the Democratic Party of Uganda in 1961, and became the second most powerful member of the Democratic Party after the Prime Minister of the transitional government between the colonial-era Uganda Protectorate and the Republic of Uganda, Benedicto Kiwanuka. Benedicto Kiwanuka did not run for the Parliament of Uganda in the 1962 Ugandan General election and thus was ineligible for any parliamentarian positions in the first government of the Republic of Uganda. As the highest ranking member of the Democratic Party of Uganda still in the Parliament of Uganda, Bataringaya became the second ever Leader of the Ugandan Opposition, replacing newly-elected prime minister Apollo Milton Obote, and the first ever Ugandan Opposition Leader of the new Republic of Uganda. As Opposition Leader, Bataringaya worked as the chief representative of the Democratic Party of Uganda which was operating as the resistance to the Apollo Milton Obote regime and the joint Ugandan People's Congress and Kabaka Yekka government. Bataringaya had little power as opposition leader, but worked during his tenure as Leader of the Ugandan Opposition to protect opposition MPs from censorship, arrest, and violence. His most significant act was to protect Democratic Party MP Vincent Rwamwaro of the Tororo East constituency from an arrest that Bataringaya described as a political arrest. On August 16, 1962, MP Vincent Rwamwaro was arrested in his home at 6:20 am, tied with rope, thrown in the back of a pick-up truck, and sent in only his underwear and sandals before a magistrate in the court in Nakawa on charges of failing to pay his graduation tax, a charge Rwamwaro denied. In both the 19 September 1962 and 26 September 1962 sessions of the Parliament of Uganda, Bataringaya gave lengthy speeches describing the value of opposition in government, decrying threats against the opposition, and attacking both the manner and political nature of the arrest of MP Rwamwaro. = Party-Switch and Obote Government =  Defection  During Bataringaya's time as Secretary General of the Democratic Party of Uganda and as the Leader of the Opposition and the highest ranking Democratic Party member in government, he clashed frequently with party leader and former Prime Minister Benedicto Kiwanuka. Bataringaya reportedly saw Benedicto Kiwanuka as arrogant and as an obstacle to the Democratic Party of Uganda and their efforts to re-obtain control as the majority party in the Parliament of Uganda. Bataringaya attempted an intra-party coup and had the top-ruling committee of the Democratic Party call for Kiwanuka to step down, but in the subsequent internal elections Kiwanuka won and retained control of the Democratic Party of Uganda, further exacerbating the conflict between the two men. This conflict between Basil Kiiza Bataringaya and Benedicto Kiwanuka ultimately led to Bataringaya crossing the aisle along with five other Democratic Party MPs and joining the Ugandan People's Congress, in the first high profile party-switching in Ugandan history. In addition to the conflict between Bataringaya and Benedicto Kiwanuka within the Democratic Party of Uganda, Bataringaya's moderate political beliefs, nationalism, and desire to serve his country more efficiently have also all been cited as reasons for his decision to defect from the Democratic Party of Uganda.  Minister of Internal Affairs  After Bataringaya's high profile defection from the Democratic Party of Uganda to the Ugandan People's Congress, Bataringaya was rewarded by the leader of the Ugandan People's Congress Prime Minister Apollo Milton Obote and appointed to be the new Minister of Internal Affairs of Uganda. Bataringaya quickly earned the trust of Prime Minister Apollo Milton Obote, and earned a spot in Obote's small inner circle of trusted advisors and amassed a large policy portfolio as one of the most powerful ministers in the Obote government. Bataringaya traveled internationally, representing Uganda on a tour of the United States and visiting Disneyland in Anaheim, California with his wife Edith Mary Bataringaya who headed the Ugandan Council for Women. He also represented the Ugandan government to the media of the world following the kidnapping of Brian Lea, a British diplomat who was kidnapped in Uganda in 1970. As a high profile Catholic involved in the administration, Bataringaya also served as a liaison between the Catholic Church of Uganda and the Obote regime, helping open Catholic hospitals and Catholic schools throughout Uganda. Also as one of Obote's five most trusted ministers, Bataringaya was in charge of putting out numerous crises throughout his tenure as Minister of Internal Affairs. One such crisis was the 1966 Buganda Crisis, where Ugandan troops commanded by Idi Amin attacked Lubiri and exiled the Kabaka of Buganda, Mutesa II of Buganda, after the Bugandan regional parliament voted to suspend Buganda's incorporation into Uganda, thus leading to Obote and Bataringaya reunifying Uganda by force and sending Mutesa II of Buganda into exile in the United Kingdom via Burundi. This use of troops was criticized and faced resistance, and Bataringaya took much of the blame as the implementer of the crisis and the killer of several other Bugandan Kabaka loyalists. = Idi Amin and Downfall =  Attempted Arrest of Amin  Idi Amin, the Ugandan military official who eventually led a successful coup d'√©tat against the Apollo Milton Obote government and became the third President of Uganda, was the eventual undoing of Basil Kiiza Bataringaya's political career and ultimately his life. A rift developed between Idi Amin and President Apollo Milton Obote that was exacerbated by Idi Amin's involvement in the First Sudanese Civil War from Idi Amin's base in the West Nile region of Uganda and Amin's alleged support for an attempted 1969 assassination attempt on Obote, a rift that ultimately led to Obote demoting Amin from his role as commander of all the armed forces of Uganda to the commander of the Army of Uganda. Idi Amin was seen as a threat to the Obote government, and Apollo Milton Obote had Basil Kiiza Bataringaya put in charge of the last minute attempted covert arrest of Amin. President Obote went to a January 1971 conference with British Conservative Prime Minister Edward Heath alongside other African leaders like President Julius Nyerere of Tanzania and President Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia to discourage Prime Minister Heath of lifting the ban that the United Kingdom had on selling arms to the apartheid government of South Africa. While there, Obote learned about another attempt on his life by Amin, and tasked Basil Bataringaya to lead an 'assassination' committee that ultimately set out to arrest Amin. On the 24th of January, 1971 Bataringaya attempted to use the Ugandan National Police to storm Amin's Command Post Kololo in Kampala and arrest Amin on charges related to the assassination attempt and a 1969 court martial for misappropriating military funds. Amin learned about this plan through spies within the Obote government, and then launched his coup d'√©tat that night, overthrowing the Obote regime on the 25th of January, 1971 and detaining Bataringaya.  Arrest and Detention  Bataringaya was one of the first Ugandans to be detained by the new Idi Amin government. In the week after Idi Amin's coup d'√©tat, Amin dismissed all of the ministers of Obote government but did not immediately imprison anybody except for Bataringaya. On the 28th of January, 1962, three days after the coup d'√©tat, Idi Amin brought fifty-five political prisoners imprisoned by the Apollo Milton Obote government to the Entebbe International Airport and freed them, while also bringing Bataringaya to the event in an army Jeep under armed guard, and was the only political prisoner not freed despite Amin's comment that \\"you need not fear for your safety since the new government is more interested in uniting Ugandans than anything else\\". Bataringaya was personally interrogated by Amin, where he likely revealed the other officers working to arrest Amin on the 24th of January, 1971. Death While in detention, Bataringaya was tortured and was imprisoned in Makindye Prison. Bataringaya was then sent to the outskirts of the town of Mbarara, where he was dismembered alive. His severed head was then displayed on a pole, and paraded around the town of Mbarara until ultimately his severed head was displayed in the Mbarara barracks. A photograph of Amin's soldiers leading Bataringaya on a military Jeep to his execution was taken and circulated, one of the few photographs still existing that show proof of Idi Amin executing political opponents. Immediately after Bataringaya was executed, his loyal cabal of associates were executed as well, including Tibayunga, Katuramu, Riwbashoka, Bekund, Kanyonyore, Kiherere, Rukare, Bitarisha, Kabaterine, Kanisi, and Marengane. Edith Mary Bataringaya, Bataringaya's wife and former head of the Uganda Council of Women, was executed in 1977 during a later purge by Idi Amin, allegedly at the hands of Juma Bashir, the governor of the Western Province of Uganda. Her burnt body was later found on land in Mbarara owned by the Bataringaya family.  Family and Personal Life  = Marriage to Edith Mary Bataringaya = Basil Kiiza Bataringaya married Edith Mary Bataringaya, who took an active role in his life and the Ugandan political scene. Edith Mary Bataringaya was born Edith Mary Kaijuka in the town of Kabale in the Western Region of the Ugandan Protectorate, and was the daughter of Reverend Kaijuka of Bugongi Hill. Edith Mary Bataringaya traveled frequently with her husband on his international trips representing Uganda abroad, traveling to the United States with him. Edith Mary Bataringaya also started the Uganda Women's Union and the Uganda Council of Women alongside Rhoda Kalema and Theresa Mbire. Edith Mary Bataringaya continued her husband's work with the Catholic Church in Uganda after Basil Kiiza Bataringaya's murder. Edith Mary Bataringaya was ultimately burned alive and executed by the Amin government, allegedly at the hands of Juma Bashir the Governor of the Western Province of Uganda. = Family = Basil Kiiza and Edith Mary Bataringaya had eight children, Dr. Geoffrey Basil Bataringaya, Basil Bataringaya Jr., Grace Bataringaya, Kenneth Bataringaya, Jackie Bataringaya, Janet Bataringaya, Juliet Wavamunno, and Dr. Aisha Bataringaya-Ssekalala. The children were orphaned in 1977 as both parents were killed by the Amin regime. Edith Mary Bataringaya's brother, Dr. Emmanuel Kaijuka who later served as the Ugandan Commissioner of Health, raised the children who were still young when they were orphaned following their parents' murders. In 1985, the eight children reunited for the first time since their mother's murder in the town of Muyenga, Uganda. Their children all went on to successful careers as of 2003: Grace Bataringaya is a veterinary doctor and events manager, Kenneth Bataringaya is a businessman who manages the family estate, Jackie Bataringaya is a doctor for Action Aid working in Harare, Zimbabwe, Janet Bataringaya is working in Public Health in Boston, Massachusetts in the United States, Juliet Wavamunno (n√©e Bataringaya) is a doctor working for the World Health Organization, and Aisha Bataringaya- Ssekalala (n√©e Bataringaya) was studying at the University of Western Cape in South Africa. = Religious Views = Bataringaya was a Catholic and involved with the Catholic Church in Uganda throughout his career in both academia and politics. Bataringaya attended a Catholic school at St. Leo's College, Kyegobe in Ankole, and eventually ran all Catholic schools in Ankole before entering politics. Bataringaya also acted as a liaison between the Catholic Church in Uganda and the Ugandan government as well, working with the Catholic Church in Uganda to build schools and hospitals throughout Uganda.
