Biography  Poo (nicknamed 'Cranky Sam') was a Chinese emigrant to Australia during the Gold Rush, but instead of mining took to highway robbery on the road between Gulgong and Mudgee. A skilled and elusive bushman, he evaded capture from the authorities for several weeks. He often targeted solitary travellers on foot, both East Asians and Europeans, and was also responsible for the rape of a settler's wife. On 3 February 1865, Senior Constable John Ward of the New South Wales Police Force was returning to Coonabarabran from a prisoner escort to Mudgee. Near the locality known as Barney's Reef he was informed that a Chinese man had been robbing passing travellers in the vicinity, and was nearby in the scrub. Following a short search, Ward located the offender's camp and approached him. When the offender saw the constable he dived into the bush. A long foot chase ensued, during which the pursued shot the constable in the chest, mortally wounding him. The murderer was later identified as Poo. Two weeks after the incident, Poo was finally tracked down. When confronted by police troops he attempted to escape, but was shot in the thigh.http://hillendfamilyhistory.com/bushrangers/sam.php Continuing to fire from the ground, he was finally subdued, and taken to a prison hospital in Mudgee. When he recovered nine months later, he was taken to Bathurst, where he was tried by Judge Edward Hargreaves and hanged on 19 December 1865. Notes References *Anonymous 'New South Wales News'.

The station, owned by Bell Media, has an antenna system input power of 10,000 watts, as a class B station. The station airs a news, talk and sports format. It broadcasts the Western Ontario Mustangs college football team, serving as its flagship station. As of 2016, it also broadcasts Toronto Maple Leaf games. Minor co-channel interference is common on CJBK at night from WHIO in Dayton, Ohio, which also broadcasts on 1290 AM (1290 kHz). History CJBK went on the air January 25, 1967 as CJOE. \\"JOE\\" in the call letters stood for H. J. McManus, the founder of the station (under the banner of Middlesex Broadcasters, Ltd.). The station originally featured a Beautiful Music format. Eventually CJOE began to supplement the easy listening music with soft rock and then Top 40 music during the evening hours, but the station remained unprofitable. In 1972, McManus sold the station to Rick Richardson (two-thirds Baron Communications, Ltd. and one-third Bruce Communications, Ltd.). On September 6, 1972, Richardson took control of CJOE and changed the call letters to CJBK and the format to full-time Top 40 hit music. Richardson wanted a \\"CJ\\" call sign to distinguish the new AM 1290 from its competitors CFPL and CKSL, but it has also been suggested (by who?) that the CJBK calls were a personal tribute to former Detroit Top 40 station WJBK-AM, which had been a favourite station of Richardson's while he lived and worked in Windsor. CJBK's main catchphrase in the 1970s was \\"Have a Good Day!\\" In 1980, CJBK added an FM sister with country-formatted CJBX-FM 92.7. In 1987, CJBK and CJBX were acquired by Middlesex-Lambton Broadcasters Ltd., and CJBK shifted from its CHR format to adult contemporary in August of that year. The station began broadcasting in AM stereo in 1989. In early 1992, the station changed format from AC to oldies. London Communications, Inc. acquired CJBK and CJBX in September 1993 and shifted CJBK from oldies to the current news/talk format on August 12, 1996. The stations were sold again in 1999 to Telemedia, which already owned AC CIQM-FM and would purchase CKSL the following year. Standard Radio acquired Telemedia's London stations in 2002. In October 2007, Astral Media acquired Standard Broadcasting's terrestrial radio and television assets, including CJBK. As part of Astral's merger with Bell Media on June 27, 2013, CJBK is owned by Bell Media. Morning host Steve Garrison had been a fixture on CJBK since the late 1970s. After a stint as station promotion manager, Garrison became a mid-day DJ in January 1984, and began co-hosting a morning show in 1990 with future CBC News anchor Heather Hiscox. After moving back to middays for a few years, he began hosting his current morning show when the news/talk format was adopted in 1996. In December 2015 Bell Media let the London radio icon go as part of a company-wide restructuring. Starting in mid-2014 after the Bell Media purchase, CJBK began airing newscasts from the CTV London newsroom and simulcasting the audio from the flagship 6pm CTV News. The station currently features live local talk shows with Ken Eastwood and Stephanie Vivier in the morning, Tom McConnell between 9 and noon (from sister station 610 CKTB in St. Catharines), London Lunch from 12pm to 12:30 pm, and Ask The Experts from 12:30 pm to 1pm and TKO with Kara Ro from 1pm to 2pm from sister station 800 CKLW AM in Windsor. CTV News Room from 4pm to 5pm. Power Play with Don Martin from 5pm to 6pm and CTV News London from 6pm to 7pm and other syndicated shows at night CJBK also broadcasts live sports, Western Ontario Mustangs football and NFL Football. On evenings and weekends, the station carries a variety of news-talk programming from other Bell Media stations including CFRB in Toronto, CJAD in Montreal, and CFRA in Ottawa.

This account is given in Andrew Nelson Lytle's Bedford Forrest and His Horse Critters. William then joined Company E of the 50th Alabama Infantry Regiment, and was again wounded at Chickamauga. He was paroled in April 1865 in Marietta, Georgia.\\"The Lure and Lore of Limestone County,\\" by Chris Edwards and Faye Axford, (Tuscaloosa, AL: Limestone County Historical Society, 1978), page 11; \\"To Lochaber Na Mair\\": Southerners View the Civil War,\\" (Athens, AL: Athens Publishing Co., 1986), Page 214n.  Political office  After the war, Richardson returned to Limestone County and served in the Alabama House of Representatives between 1865 and 1867 from that district. He studied law and was admitted to the bar at Huntsville in 1867. Between 1875 and 1886, he served as judge of the probate and county courts of Madison County. Richardson played a major role in the election of George Smith Houston as governor the next year. He was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1904. He was elected as a Democrat to the Fifty-sixth congress to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Joseph Wheeler. He was reelected to the Fifty- seventh and to the six succeeding Congresses. He served until his death.\\"Biographical directory of the United States Congress.\\"  Personal life  Richardson married his cousin, Elizabeth Rucker, of Lynchburg, Virginia in 1872, and they were the parents of five children. Richardson was often troublesome to the Union victors after the Civil War. He was wanted by the North, but was never caught. Once, he tarred and feathered a Union carpetbagger, tied him to his horse, and dragged him through the streets of Huntsville. He later ran to a cave and hid for about a year. Soon after, he was elected to the House. Richardson was also very large. He was considered a giant by many people of the time period. Portraits of him exist which depict him seated on a large horse with his feet nearly touching the ground. Though his actual height was never recorded, he was said to be somewhere between 6' 9\\" and 7' 2\\". Richardson died on March 31, 1914 in Atlantic City, New Jersey, where he had gone for his health, and is buried in Maple Hill Cemetery in Huntsville.Congressional Biography.

It was composed of escaped slaves from South Carolina and Florida. It was one of the first black regiments in the Union Army. Department of the South staff officer James D. Fessenden was heavily involved in efforts to recruit volunteers for the 1st South Carolina. Although it saw some combat, the regiment was not involved in any of the war's major battles. Its first commander was Thomas Wentworth Higginson, wholike all the other officerswas white. A proclamation by Confederate President Jefferson Davis had ordered that members of the regiment would not be treated as prisoners of war if taken in battle: The enlisted men were to be delivered to state authorities to be auctioned off or otherwise treated as runaway slaves, while the white officers were to be hanged. Colonel Higginson wrote \\"We, their officers, did not go there to teach lessons, but to receive them. There were more than a hundred men in the ranks who had voluntarily met more dangers in their escape from slavery than any of my young captains had incurred in all their lives.\\" The regiment was particularly effective at conducting raids along the coast of Florida and Georgia, due to their familiarity with the terrain. The regiment was a step in the evolution of Union thinking towards the escaped slaves who crossed their lines. Initially they were returned to their owners. Next they were considered contraband and employed as laborers. Finally the legal fiction that they were property was abandoned and they were allowed to enlist in the Army, although in segregated units commanded by white officers. Harriet Tubman served with these men as a cook, nurse, spy, and scout. Susie King Taylor, whose husband and other relatives fought with the regiment, also served as a laundress and nurse for the men from August 1862 until mustering out on February 9, 1866. As a holdover from the \\"contraband\\" days, black privates were paid $10 per month, the rate for laborers, rather than the $13 paid to white privates. The men served as the precedent for the over 170,000 \\"colored\\" troops who followed them into the Union Army. Col. Higginson, a minister, author and abolitionist, documented the Gullah dialect spoken by the men and made a record of the spirituals that they sang. Captain Seth Rogers was regimental surgeon and wrote extensive war time letters. His nephew, Captain James Seth Rogers, previously of the 51st Massachusetts, was captain of Company B. Higginson later wrote a book about his experiences title \\"Army Life in a Black regiment\\". The regiment was re-designated the 33rd United States Colored Infantry Regiment on February 8, 1864.

Kelley (December 6, 1916, Kansas ‚Äì November 26, 1999, Berkeley, California) was an American mathematician at the University of California, Berkeley, who worked in general topology and functional analysis. Kelley's 1955 text, General Topology, which eventually appeared in three editions and several translations, is a classic and widely cited graduate level introduction to topology. An appendix sets out a new approach to axiomatic set theory, now called Morse‚ÄìKelley set theory, that builds on Von Neumann‚ÄìBernays‚ÄìG√∂del set theory. He introduced the first definition of a subnet. After earning B.A. (1936) and M.A. (1937) degrees from the University of California, Los Angeles, he went to the University of Virginia, where he obtained his Ph.D. in 1940. Gordon Whyburn, a student of Robert Lee Moore, supervised his thesis, entitled A Study of Hyperspaces. He taught at the University of Notre Dame until the outbreak of World War II. From 1942 to 1945, he did mathematics (mainly exterior ballistics, including ballistics for the atomic bomb) for the war effort at the Aberdeen Proving Grounds, where his work unit included his future Berkeley colleagues Anthony Morse and Charles Morrey. After teaching at the University of Chicago, 1946‚Äì47, Kelley spent the rest of his career at Berkeley, from which he retired in 1985. He chaired the Mathematics Department at Berkeley 1957-60 and 1975‚Äì80. He held visiting appointments at Cambridge University and the Indian Institute of Technology in Kanpur, India. An Indian Mathematician, Vashishtha Narayan Singh, was among those mentored by Kelley. In 1950, Kelley was one of 29 tenured Berkeley faculty (3 of whom were members of the Mathematics Department) dismissed for refusing to sign a McCarthy-era loyalty oath mandated by the UC Board of Regents. He then taught at Tulane University and the University of Kansas. He returned to Berkeley in 1953, after the California Supreme Court declared the oath unconstitutional and directed UC Berkeley to rehire the dismissed academics. He was later an outspoken opponent of the Vietnam War. Kelley's interest in teaching extended well beyond the higher reaches of mathematics. In 1960, he took a leave of absence to serve as the National Teacher on NBC's Continental Classroom television program. He was an active member of the School Mathematics Study Group (SMSG), which played an important role in designing and promulgating the \\"new math\\" of that era. In 1964, he led his department to introduce a new major called Mathematics for Teachers, and later taught one of its core courses. These endeavors culminated in the text Kelley and Richert (1970). In 1977‚Äì78, he was a member of the U.S. Commission on Mathematical Instruction. His doctoral students include Vashishtha Narayan Singh, James Michael Gardner Fell, Isaac Namioka, and Reese Prosser.  Books by Kelley  * 1953 (with Edward J. McShane and Franklin V. Reno).

It is the birthplace of St. Thomas Aquinas. History The history of Roccasecca is tightly bound to its strategic position, a \\"dry rocca\\" at the entrance to two narrow defiles that give access to the Valle di Comino below the slopes of Monte Asprano, whose elevation at provides a natural position to control the wide Valle del Liri. Remains of archaic perimeter walling attest to an early fortified presence around the site. Roccasecca served as a way station for ancient Roman legions and invading armies crossing the River Melfa, spanned by three ancient bridges there, remains of which still exist. However, the Medieval commune truly began in the early Middle Ages. It is commonly remembered that St. Thomas Aquinas was born at Roccasecca in 1225, in the castle of his father Landulf, Count of Aquino, which was an important defensive structure that Manso, Abbot of Monte Cassino erected in 994 as part of the outward defenses of the Abbey, it being some kilometres distant. The Abbot entrusted the fortified rocca to a collateral branch of the Counts of Aquino, whose primary seat at Aquino lies to the south; they retained their custody of the fortification through numerous battles, throughout the centuries. After the middle of the sixteenth century, some of the inhabitants descended to the valley to erect permanent housing there, giving rise to the frazioni Roccasecca Centro, Castello, and Caprile. In the ensuing centuries the rocca of Roccasecca passed between the Angevin kings of Naples or the Aragonese, in intermittent contention with the Papal States, for the resulting power over the Valle del Liri. Only in 1583 did Roccasecca gain some permanent security, when the Counts of Aquino sold the rights to Giacomo Boncompagni, Duke of Sora, the illegitimate son of Pope Gregory XIII (born Ugo Boncompagni), who made of it for the first time a Papal fief. In the seventeenth century Roccasecca fell with the remainder of southern Italy into Spanish Habsburg control. In the eighteenth century, droughts, disease, and excessive fiscal pressures drastically reduced the number of inhabitants. In the nineteenth century, the illusory Napoleonic promises of liberty were dissolved in Carbonaria and brigandage. After the unification of Italy in 1860 and the arrival in 1902 of a railroad line to Avezzano that linked Roccasecca with the larger world, emigration to the industrial north and farther abroad became more practical. But the agricultural life of Roccasecca remained unbroken until World War II. The war was a tragic episode: Roccasecca was chosen, due to its rail station and railroad bridge across the Melfa, as the headquarters for the German XIV Panzer Corps under General Fridolin von Senger und Etterlin, with the consequence of repeated Allied bombing, which heavily damaged the commune's population and culminated in a ferocious attack on the rail station. In the post-war period, reconstruction brought some industry for the first time and modern redevelopment in the demolished area around the restored railroad station. The seventh centennial of St. Thomas Aquinas' death was honoured with the visit of St. Paul VI on 14 September 1974.

Places of Interest Kannathal temple Nattarasankottai is believed to be the first place of settlement of the Nagarathars, after they moved out from the Chola Kingdom in the early 7th century. Nattarasankottai is famous world over for the Kannathal temple. The Kannathal Temple is said to have built in the mid-18th century. One could find names like 'Kannappan' (for male children), 'Kannathal', 'Kannammai' and 'Kanmani' (for female children) abundant in the community. The temple is managed by the village Nagarathars. As per mythology, Kannathal emerged with blessings she obtained from Lord Siva (the God of Creation, Sustenance and Destruction of evil, in Hindu Mythology) to vanquish Mahishan, who was giving trouble and anxiety to the people. Mahishan had a rare blessing from Brahmadeva that he will not die in the hands of men and he will only be executed by a woman. After heeding to the voices of the tortured people and Devathas, Kannathal appeared in Simmavahanam (Lion as vehicle) and executed him by stabbing in his heart. She is praised by many devotees who have experienced her blessings. The temple is famous for its architectural marvel and Golden Kumbhams over the Temple tower. The deity, Kannudaya Nayaki Amman alias Kannathal is seen with eight hands and has an udukkai (a percussion striking instrument) and muvizhai sulam in her hands. Her left leg stamps the Asura by name Mahishan. Kannathal is famous for healing eye ailments and correcting eye sight, and also other illnesses. Mavilakku, a flour made offering for the Goddess is offered by the devotees to appease her and to get her blessings. Vaikasi Visakam festival, celebrated for 10 days, is famous for the temple and on the 8th day, the Goddess in the form of KaliattaKannathal decorated by 'Kazhuthu Uru' (a Nagarathar Ornament) is taken in the silver adorned chariot around the temple. Also, Amman is taken in Golden chariot on 7th day on and Wooden Chariot on 9th day. On 10th day night the function is called as \\"Mosa kuthu\\" (Muyal-Rabbit in English) one rabbit will be killed by using the long knife by poosari every year on this 10th day.Crowd of people will be there in the particular place to see this function. Kaliattam, a festival celebrated once in 60 years was celebrated in 1996 with much pomp and pageantry. The first 'Kumbabishekam' (Consecration of the temple) took place on 12 September 1938, the second on 6 September 1976 and the third on 1 May 1989 and also last kumbabishekam was on 2005. 'Sevvai Pongal' during the Tamil month Thai, is a festival that is celebrated by Nagarathars of this village, during which tickets will be pooled and drawn and based on that places near the temple are allotted to all the nagarathar families for making Pongals. Non-Nagarthars also contribute a lot to this festival. Other festivals of the temple include 'Muzhalkuttu Thiruvizha' during the Tamil month of Aadi, 'Navarathri' during the Tamil month of Purattasi and 'Thailakkappu Utsavam' during the Tamil month of Thai. There are many temples in Nattarasankottai of which a Sivan temple is also famous. Ashtami Thiruvizha and Sivarathri are the famous festivals of this temple. Kambar tomb The famous poet Kambar, who translated Valmiki Ramayana to Tamil, spent his last days in Nattarasankottai and his tomb is situated here. It is not famous and very few of the public know of this. It is said that Kambar after having differences with the Chola king, left the Chola kingdom and roamed around. When he arrived at Nattarasankottai, he was very thirsty and asked for water in one house. When he was offered buttermilk in return he became very happy and decided to stay there itself and spent his last days there. Every year Kamban vizha (function) is conducted at this place to felicitate Kambar. Other places of interest The renowned town of Kalayarkovil which is famous for Kaleeswarar temple, is situated few miles away there. The famous Kollangudi Vettudaiyar Kali temple is also nearby.

The novel was published in mass market paperback in October 1993 and re-released in February 2008 to coincide with the release of the film adaptation. It tells the story of David, a teenager who escapes an abusive household using his ability to teleport. As he tries to make his way in the world, he searches for his mother (who left when he was a child), develops a relationship with a woman from whom he keeps his ability secret, and is eventually brought into conflict with several antagonists. Plot One evening, while being physically abused by his father, David \\"Davy\\" Rice unexpectedly teleports (or \\"jumps\\") and finds himself in the local library, the Stanville Library. This is a place that Davy is familiar with and spends a lot of time in, which is why he was able to easily teleport there. The origin of this power is never explained, but he ends up using this power continually throughout the novel. Vowing never to return to his father's house, Davy makes his way to New York City. After being mugged and discovering that he can't get a job without a birth certificate and/or social security number, Davy robs a local bank by teleporting inside the safe, stealing nearly a million dollars. He then begins a life of reading, attending plays, and dining in fancy restaurants. At a play, he meets a 21-year-old woman named Millie Harrison, and they spend some time touring New York before she returns to college in Stillwater, Oklahoma. Davy later visits her in Oklahoma, and they attend a party, where he accidentally runs into Millie's ex-boyfriend, Mark, who tries to fight him, forcing David to jump Mark away, unnoticed. Feeling bad for Davy, Millie invites him to stay the night at her place. The two officially start a romantic relationship and make love. Millie and Davy continue to see each other and begin to fall in love. Davy also manages to locate and reunite with his long-lost mother, Mary Niles. Mary left the family after being severely beaten by David's father, and all her attempts to contact David over the years were intercepted by his father. The New York police start investigating Davy after he saves a neighbor from an attack by jumping her abusive husband to a park; the husband turns out to be a police officer. The investigation drives Davy to move to Oklahoma, where he gets an apartment near Millie. One night while Davy is out, the police are in his New York City apartment when Millie calls. The police inform her of their investigation of him. Davy confronts Millie and tries to explain, but Millie breaks up with him and tells him to go. Out of anger, Davy jumps in front of her, back to his apartment in Stillwater. After a few weeks, Davy finds himself missing Millie and starts receiving letters from her, a way of reconciling. Mary, who was on a business trip, is murdered by terrorists when her plane is hijacked. Davy sets out to find Rashid Matar, the terrorist responsible for his mother's death. Davy starts jumping to Algeria to search for Matar, having to dodge the police almost every time he is there. While at Mary's funeral, Davy meets his father for the first time in years and is interrogated by the police again. While he is searching for the terrorist, he and Millie go out on their first date in months together. Davy tells her everything, even the bank robbery, which she's a little upset about. Despite everything that he has told her, his ability to jump and the money he stole, Millie confesses that she misses him and is deeply in love with him. Davy and Millie officially restart their relationship. However, the National Security Agency, led by veteran agent Brian Cox, becomes suspicious when it finds out he can get from Algeria to the United States in only a few hours. When he is questioned, Davy jumps out of the NSA office, witnessed by Cox and several other agents. Cox and the NSA then become determined to capture Davy so they can use his powers. David has Millie go stay with her parents, while at the same time they see each other in secret. After numerous failures to grab Davy, Cox takes Millie hostage in order to get to him. Davy strikes back by grabbing Cox, and later captures Matar and his abusive father‚Äîthereby putting him in the unique position of controlling the fates of all three of his tormentors. This experience has profound effects on all four of them. Davy finds himself unable to kill his captives despite their crimes against him and ultimately releases them. Davy turns Matar over to the authorities, threatening to come after him again if he isn't found guilty of his crimes. His father is forced to acknowledge his abuse of Davy and Mary and enters alcoholic counseling. Cox is forced to see the similarities between his actions and those of the terrorist and the wife-beating alcoholic, has Millie released, and agrees to stop hunting Davy. Both Davy and Millie go away with each other. Afterward, Millie comforts Davy as he realizes that he cannot escape his pain through teleportation or vigilante action, and he enters counseling as well.

Adaptation A film by the same title, released on February 14, 2008, was directed by Doug Liman, with a screenplay adapted by David S. Goyer, Jim Uhls and Simon Kinberg. It starred Hayden Christensen, Samuel L. Jackson, Rachel Bilson, Jamie Bell, and Diane Lane. The beginning of the film follows the early plot of the novel with respect to David's home life and discovery of jumping, but deviates significantly from there. Most of the characters are presented differently than in the book, and the film introduces another Jumper, Griffin O'Conner. Also new are a group, the Paladins, who hunt and kill Jumpers on religious grounds; Cox's character, renamed Roland Cox, is not an NSA agent, but rather the leader of the Paladins. A new novel was written as a tie-in to the movie, titled Jumper: Griffin's Story. This book gives the backstory of the new character, and as noted in an introduction by the author, is not entirely consistent with the original Jumper or with Reflex. A sequel TV series to the movie based upon the novel Impulse was released on June 6, 2018 on Google's YouTube Premium subscription service. The second season renewal was announced shortly after the series' release.The series third season was cancelled in March 2020.

Gould said: \\"considering that it wasn't published until the latter half of 1992, it had to work extra hard.\\" The book was listed for the graphic description of David's abuse at the start of the book (page 2) and the description of David's debate about killing his passed out father (page 10-11). Sequels *A 2004 sequel to the novel, Reflex, continues the story of David and Millie as adults. *The 2008 short story \\"Shade\\" takes place after the events in Reflex. *A 2013 sequel, Impulse, tells the story of their daughter, Cent. *Released September 9, 2014, Exo continues the series after Impulse and mainly follows Cent. *The 2008 novel Jumper: Griffin's Story tells the tale of another \\"jumper\\" character from the film inspired by the novel, and serves as a prequel/spin-off. There is also a video game of the same name, which was released in 2008. Both titles take place in the film's world, and not that of the novels.

The majority of the population is Roman Catholic and the religion still has an important role on people's daily life. Historical Monuments Alvelos has many historical monuments of which most are associated with religious purposes. The Alvelos Church is probably the most important historical site of the parish.

The main goal of this association is to promote sport and cultural activities among the inhabitants of Alvelos and surroundings. The organization of the annual \\"Carnaval de Alvelos\\" has been one of the main activities of the \\"Mais Juventude\\". It has attracted numerous people from several other parishes of Barcelos. The Carnival has been one of the central events (along with the annual \\"Festa da nossa Senhora das Dores\\") for many artists who spend several days getting ready for the Sunday parade. As a street parade and festival, the show is full of vibrant color. Its theme is often centered in social, cultural and political events. Statues The construction of two public sculptures (Nossa Senhora das Dores and S. Loren√ßo) has begun to replace two other monuments located in front of the Church. Although these new landmarks are funded by public donations, their relevancy for the parish are still a controversial issue among the population, especially due to their large initial budget.

The college operates under the trusteeship of the Minister Provincial and Definitory of the Franciscan Province of Ireland. In September 2014 the school moved from being a fee-charging school to the free school scheme. The college is situated in eastern County Meath approximately 32 kilometres (20 miles) north of Dublin City. In 2018-2019, there were 434 students: 288 boys and 146 girls. The college offers boarding and day facilities. Boarding at Gormanston is a mixture of five-day and seven- day boarding options for boys. Girls are admitted and welcome to the school as day students. International students must have an Irish contact either through an Agency or Guardianship. Gormanston College is a public, coeducational Catholic secondary school under the trusteeship of the Franciscan Province of Ireland. It is located at Gormanston Castle (built 1789), near Gormanston, County Meath, about north of Dublin, Ireland. The college motto is Dei Gloriae, Hiberniae.  Grounds  The college consists mainly one building and is attached to the residential castle. The grounds, straddling County Meath and County Dublin, contain a river, a wood and a small 9-hole golf course. There are several playing fields, in two different locations but contiguous with the college. The college and grounds are located between the Dublin‚ÄìBelfast motorway and the old main Dublin‚ÄìDrogheda road. The eastern face of Gormanston Castle looks to the sea, down a long straight field, known as \\"Cromwells Avenue\\". A \\"yew walk\\" leads down to the graveyard, where several of the Order, both priests and nuns, as well as some students, are buried. The old coach road from Dublin to Belfast runs alongside the eastern college boundary walls.  History  The apostolate of education has been a core ministry throughout the 800-year history of the Franciscan Order. Prior to the Reformation schools attached to the local Franciscan abbey/friary were a common feature of Franciscan ministry. With the closure of the monasteries in the reign of Henry VIII this apostolate came to an abrupt end. The gradual relaxation of the Penal Laws saw a re-structuring of the Order in Ireland and the opening of a number of schools, notably in Clonmel and Athlone. The ministry of education carried out in Gormanston has its immediate roots in the Seraphic College opened at Capranica 50k North of the city of Rome in 1883. Originally intended as a training college for aspirants to the Franciscan Order it was decided to transfer the college to Multyfarnham Abbey Co. Westmeath in 1896 where it was to evolve into a secondary school. The new college dedicated to St. Louis was opened in 1899. By the 1940s Multyfarnham in size and location was deemed no longer adequate by the Order. The Order had purchased the Gormanston Estate in 1947 and its proximity to Dublin made it an ideal and accessible location for a modern college. The first boarders were received in Gormanston in 1954 and the new college was opened in 1956. The first boarding students were received in 1954 and the new college was opened in 1957. The first students graduated from the College in 1957, a number of whom returned to become rectors at the College, Pat McSweeney OFM, Bob Doyle OFM, Paddy \\"Paddy\\" Timothy OFM. Prior to the establishment of the school, Gormanston Castle and demesne had been in the possession of the Preston family who have been Viscounts Gormanston since the fourteenth century. The current principal of Gormanston College is Dermot Lavin. In 2014, the school elected to enter the Free Education scheme, previous to that they had been a fee paying school. Fees are still charged for boarders.

It is based on the 1956 science fiction novel The Power by Frank M. Robinson. The storyline concerns two men who have the ability to control or slay others with their minds. Plot Professor Henry Hallson, an anthropologist, discovers evidence of a person with psychic abilities among his co-workers in a research laboratory. His colleagues include biologist Dr. Jim Tanner, geneticist Dr. Margery Lansing, physicist Dr. Carl Melnicker, biologist Dr. Talbot Scott and chairman Norman Van Zandt, all working for government liaison Arthur Nordlund. After a warning from Hallson that one of them possesses a super-intellect beyond human measurement, and capable of controlling other human minds, the assembled co- workers conduct a telekinesis test using a simple psi wheel, which spins once all of them concentrate on it together. Later that night, Hallson is found murdered in the laboratory's human centrifuge, with the name \\"Adam Hart\\" scrawled on a piece of paper in his office. Hallson's widow Sally Hallson tells Tanner that \\"Adam Hart\\" was the name of her husband's childhood friend. The police make routine checks of the backgrounds of the members of the committee of which Hallson was a member, and Tanner immediately becomes the prime suspect in his murder when it is found that he has apparently lied about his distinguished academic credentials. In fact, all records documenting his past have been erased by some inexplicable method. Tanner visits Hallson's hometown and learns that Adam Hart is a superhuman, with different people providing different descriptions of his appearance, and others still obeying commands that Hart gave them years earlier. As Tanner tries to uncover the superhuman, Melnicker and Van Zandt are methodically murdered. Talbot Scott, panicked by what is happening, is eventually shot in a confrontation with the police. In a final showdown, Tanner confronts the apparently undefeatable Adam Hart, who is revealed to be Arthur Nordlund. Hart's psychic assault awakens Tanner's own latent psychic powers, and Tanner kills Hart instead. Tanner realizes that he was the superhuman uncovered by Hallson's tests, and that Hart was trying to eliminate any competition from others like himself. Cast Production The source novel's plot was substantially changed in John Gay's screenplay, moving the location to San Marino, California, changing most of the characters' names (although retaining the surnames of Tanner, Nordlund, and department head Professor Van Zandt), and eliminating several subplots and characters, presumably to fit the film's 108-minute run time. Hamilton starred as Professor Jim Tanner, with Pleshette as his teammate and romantic interest Margery Lansing (Marge Hanson in the novel), and Michael Rennie (famous among science fiction film fans as Klaatu in The Day the Earth Stood Still) as new government liaison Mr. Nordlund. Otherwise, the story unfolds in a fashion similar to the novel, except for a somewhat different twist to the conclusion. In the film Tanner defeats Hart but retains his humanity; in the novel, Tanner sheds his humanity after killing Hart, and looks forward to \\"playing God\\" with normal humans, just as Hart did. This film is memorable for a number of intriguing scenes, including murder by centrifuge, a seemingly possessed \\"Walk/Don't Walk\\" pedestrian sign, toy soldiers firing with real gunpowder, and \\"winking out\\" inanimate objects (the last two also in the novel). The soundtrack also memorably features a beating heart to signal the mind-control attempts and eerie music from a cymbalum (a hammered dulcimer-like instrument) accompanying the film's more suspenseful moments. The music, written by Oscar-winning composer Mikl√≥s R√≥zsa, contributes an amusing fourth wall-breaking moment when Tanner, hearing the haunting tune, seems to expect a new disaster, only to be visibly relieved when he finds a cymbalum-violin duet being performed in the hotel lobby. This was R√≥zsa's final score for a film produced by MGM, for which he had scored numerous films throughout his career. Legacy There is a scene of what may be the first appearance and operation by telekinesis of a psi wheel in a film. Also, the psi wheel scene can be seen in the film's trailer on YouTube.

Eligibility In principle the following members of the following overseas bodies are eligible via Mutual Recognition Agreements (MRAs) : *CPA Australia *Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand (CAANZ) *CPA Canada (CPAC) *Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA) *Chartered Accountants Ireland (CAI) *Instituto Mexicano de Contadores Publicos (IMCP) *Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland (ICAS) *South African Institute of Chartered Accountants Those who have acquired their overseas membership through mutual recognition or reciprocity are not eligible. For example, an Australian or Irish Chartered Accountant who originally qualified as a member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales would not be eligible. Those from recognized overseas bodies who are not eligible to sit for IQEX may apply to a U.S. State Board of Accountancy to sit for the Uniform CPA Exam under normal rules. The Colorado State Board of Accountancy, Delaware State Board of Accountancy and Illinois State Board of Accountancy are popular choices for overseas qualified accountants. Details on IQEX eligibility, IQEX training programs and CPA licensure are available at Administration The administration of the IQEX exam is similar to that for the Uniform CPA Exam, with a few key differences: * Application is made directly to NASBA, not to a state board of accountancy * The exam can be sat at Prometric test centers outside the United States (although Canada is the only other country in which the exam is normally offered) * Instead of being available all year round, IQEX is only offered for three weeks in October or November each year. * Results are sent directly to the candidate by NASBA (normally in February, following the exam in November) The fee to sit IQEX is USD845 as a first time candidate, and USD795 as a re-examination candidate. Australian CPAs required to sit the AUD section of the Uniform CPA Exam must pay USD1,030 as a first time candidate, and USD795 for re-examination. Should AUD be applied for on its own the fee is USD185. Licensure or certification as a CPA After successfully passing IQEX, candidates must still meet the requirements of one of the 55 State Boards of Accountancy in order to be licensed or certified as a CPA. Although state boards are not involved in the IQEX examination itself, they still reserve the right to decide on CPA licensure and certification. * Most successful IQEX candidates (who do not need a license from a particular state) apply for a CPA certificate from the Illinois State Board of Accountancy. This is the most straightforward option, as Illinois does not require any further educational, ethics or work experience requirements for certification. * Some state boards do not accept IQEX, or only accept it under certain conditions.

Palahniuk has indicated that Rant is the first in what will become a three-book series. Rant is told in the form of an oral biography. When the story begins, the reader discovers that the main character, Buster Landru \\"Rant\\" Casey, is already deceased. Throughout the book various people discuss their memories of Buster and the world he lived in, presenting stories in an occasionally conflicting timeline. The paperback edition became a national bestseller in May 2008 and remained on the New York Times Paperback Fiction Bestseller List for six weeks. Author and anthropologist Victor Turner is briefly quoted as one of the contributors. Author Chloe Lucero (who wrote The Death Of The American Dream) reportedly inspired the character. Plot summary Buster Casey is born in the rural town of Middleton with the senses of smell and taste far more advanced than any other human. He acquires the nickname \\"Rant\\" from a childhood prank involving animal organs which results in numerous people becoming ill. The sound of the victims vomiting resembles the word \\"rant\\", which becomes a local synonym for \\"vomit\\" and therefore Buster's nickname. As a child Rant discovers a massive wealth that turns the small town's economy on its head. He becomes obsessed with getting bitten by rabid animals along with venomous snakes and spiders. After his first bite from a black widow spider, Rant discovers that toxic spider bites cause him to get an erection. He uses this effect to leave school and eventually threatens his way to an early diploma and a rather large check that he uses to leave town. When Rant arrives in the city, it becomes clear to the reader that the novel takes place in a dystopian future, where urban dwellers are forcefully divided by curfew into two separate classes: the respectable Daytimers and the oppressed Nighttimers. Rant becomes a Nighttimer and finds himself swept up in the Nighttimer lifestyle that revolves around \\"Party Crashing\\", a covert demolition derby played out on city streets at night. The game is organized by an unknown entity and is set during a designated window of time. The object of the game is to crash, not too forcefully, into other players who sport a certain \\"flag\\", such as a Christmas tree on their car's roof or the words \\"Just Married\\" scrawled on their rear windshield. Rant meets Echo Lawrence, a fellow Crasher and the girl with whom he falls in love. Rant also starts a nationwide rabies epidemic that eventually erupts into zombie-invasion-like proportions that calls for those infected with rabies to be shot and killed on sight. Rant eventually dies during a Party Crashing event. His death is viewed and listened to by millions on national television and the Graphic Traffic radio show. However, when the car is pried open, his body is missing. After his \\"death\\", many interviewees share their speculations about Rant's strange fate and its implications for society along with the rabies outbreak. Some interviewees and friends of Rant speculate that crashing a car while in a given state of mind will jar a person outside of time. Once this is accomplished, they can then go back and kill off all of their ancestors, in turn making them immortal. Or they can, through incest, make themselves into something more than human. The latter is believed to have happened to Green Taylor Simms, a fellow Party Crasher, who is implied to be Buster Casey in some form. Film adaptation On September 11, 2014, Palahniuk announced that James Franco had optioned the film rights to Rant. On April 12, 2016, a screenwriter pitched the novel's screenplay adaptation through an online video, written and ready for production. Whether or not the pitch achieved its goal has yet to be announced.

Use Pendimethalin protects crops like wheat, corn, soybeans potatoes, cabbage, peas, carrots and asparagus. It is used to control annual grasses and certain broadleaf weeds which interfere with growth, development, yield and quality of agricultural and horticultural crops by competing on nutrients, water and light. In areas where weed infestation is particularly high, yield losses can render wheat production economically unviable.Clarke, Wynn, Twinning, Berry, Cook, Ellis and Gladders Pesticide availability for cereals and oilseeds following revision of Directive 91/414/EEC; effects of losses and new research priorities.

Mode of action Pendimethalin acts both pre-emergence, that is before weed seedlings have emerged, and early post-emergence. Pendimethalin inhibits root and shoot growth. It controls the weed population and prevents weeds from emerging, particularly during the crucial development phase of the crop. Its primary mode of action is to prevent plant cell division and elongation in susceptible species. In the HRAC classification of herbicides according their mode of action, pendimethalin is listed in group K1.  Risk factor for developing pancreatic cancer  Pendimethalin exposure has been shown to substantially increase the risk of developing pancreatic cancer, one of the most lethal forms of cancer. A study published in the International Journal of Cancer revealed a three-fold increase among applicators in the top- half of lifetime use of the herbicide.  Resistance  Herbicide resistance typically increases production costs and limits options for herbicide selection, cultivations and rotations. Up to now Pendimethalin does not show resistance. It is not cross-resistant with other grass weed herbicides. This means that Pendimethalin supports the effects of other supplementary grass weed herbicides that use a different mode of action.Moss, S. R. and R. Hull: The value of pre-emergence herbicides for combating herbicide-resistant Alopecurus myosuroides (blackgrass). In: Aspects of Applied Biology. Nr. 91, 2009.

It is operated by the Manitoba Jockey Club and is the site of the annual Manitoba Derby. The track is located on the western edge of the city, near the intersection of the Perimeter Highway and Portage Avenue. It was opened on June 10, 1958, replacing the former Polo Park Racetrack, which was demolished to make way for Polo Park Shopping Centre. The main track is a six-and-one-half furlong oval. Assiniboia Downs mural (25239033942) Thoroughbred racing season events run from May and end in September. Harness racing events operate during the winter months.  History  Preparations were underway in September 1957 to construct a (est.) $4 million new horse racing venue in the Greater Winnipeg area, with seating capacity for 5,000 spectators. The width of the track would be with a six- furlong and 1‚Öõ-furllong chutes. Assiniboia Downs would be located in the RM of Assiniboia at 3975 Portage Avenue. The racetrack took but seven weeks to complete construction. Harness racers had shown an interest at using the new racetrack, and if they couldn't, would use one in St. Vital instead. Construction of Assiniboia Downs would be competed in time for the beginning of the 1958 season in June, where 42 races would take place. Assiniboia Downs installed a state-of-the-art \\"tote\\" machine at the new racing venue which displayed betting information in real-time.  Off-track betting  In December 1987 Videon Cable-TV and Westman Cable's application to the CRTC to telecast live horse racing from Assiniboia Downs was approved. On January 23, 1988, Videon Cable-tv began telecasting Assiniboia Downs live harness racing to allow for off-track betting via telephone (Telephone Account Betting). Twenty phone lines were installed to handle incoming calls and they were frequently full. The signal was uplinked to the Anik C3 satellite. Initial telecasts on VSP-7 were a success, though Videon stated that on-air presentation between races could have been improved. Across the Red River, cable company Greater Winnipeg Cablevision did not telecast the harness racing and did not (initially) apply to the CRTC to do so. Today the Assiniboia Downs Racing Network is available on MTS TV ch. 179 and 180 and on the Internet via the HPIbet website.

Nehtaur is an ancient and well known town because of its culture and educational backgrounds. Nehtaur Town was established by the Taga Minister family of Ajmer state when they came from Ranthambhor,Rajasthan after it was captured by Kutubuddin Aibak and the place was called Nai+thour = NEHTAUR (New Abode). This is how Nehtaur derived its name[Ref.Book-History of Islam in India]. During the British period also, Tyagi/Taga (called Chaudghary, Hindu & Muslim) & Syed were the main Jageerdar (estate) and Nehtaur became upper class community hub. Syed and Tyagi dominated town and both community hold the entire economy. During that time, Nehtaur was very famous town in the state because of its higher educational status and its many people were graduates. Its Sanskrit pathshalas and Arabic madrasas were famous in the region [1] When India was under the British Administration that time only Nehtaur was single town which had its own administration called \\"BARA TOPI SARKAR\\" 12 prominent and educated personalities belong from Syed community were run their own Government in Nehtour but unfortunately many people are not aware about it even majority of the Nehtauri's do not know about their own town history. It is a proud for us as well as for the nation; Nehtaur had independent administration during the British period. When Sir Syed Ahmad Khan visited Nehtaur and asked people for their support and donation for Aligarh College. He was impressed by the town and its citizens due to their positive response and called the town as \\"Danishmand\\" or wise.  Syeds of Nehtaur  Most of the Syeds of Nehtaur are descendants of Syed Kamaluddin Tirmizi, who migrated to India in 587 AH/1191 AD for preaching Islam in the Subcontinent, as had many other Aulias done at that time, such as Khawaja Moinuddin Chisti Gharibnawaz Aulia. At that time, Shahabuddin Ghouri was preparing for his First raid on India. When Shahabuddin learnt about Kamaluddin Tirmizi's, plans of also going to India, he offered him to travel under his protection. Kamaluddin Tirmizi, however declined the offer, saying that \\"Our missions are different. You are going there to conquer land; and my intentions are to propagate the teaching of Islam to the inhabitants\\". Kamaluddin Tirmizi, however directed one of his eleven sons, Mir Malik Syed Ibrahim Shah to join Shahabuddin Ghori. Shahabuddin Ghori was defeated by the then ruler of Delhi, Prithivi Raj Chauhan. Although his forces captured the Hansi Fort (100 miles West of Panipat and about 130 miles West of Delhi on Delhi-Hisar-Sirsa Road), however Mir Malik Syed Ibrahim Shah attained Shahadat, and was buried within the Fort premises (South West area), where, reportedly, it still exists and is known as Nishanchi's Mazar. Shahabuddin again returned to India in 1192 after preparing for one year and defeated Prithivi Raj Chauhan in the second battle of Tarain and, subsequently, became the first Muslim ruler to conquer Delhi and establish a Muslim rule in India. He was very happy to find Kamaluddin well settled and in his honour gave him land in Sialgarh in Karnal. Subsequently, Kamaluddin Tirmizi settled down in Kaithal, where he is buried. Most sons of Kamaluddin spread themselves throughout the length and breadth if India on preaching mission, as follows: # Mir Jalaluddin Ghazi (Rohaikhand) # Mir Syed Hissamuddin (Kaithal) # Mir Syed Rukunuddin (Ahmedabad, Gujarat) # Mir Syed Saeeduddin (Batan, Madras) # Mir Syed Azizuddin (Nehtaur) # Mir Syed Aleemuddin (Qannouj) # Mir Malik Syed Ibrahim Shah with Shahabuddin Ghouri # Mir Syed Nizamuddin (Delhi) # Mir Syed Naseeruddin (Tir Hat, Sylhet) # Mir Syed Naatuddin (Kaithal) # Mir Syed Qutubuddin (Kaithal) # Mr. Zeeshan Ahmad (Delhi) # Mr Gulfam Ahmad Subsequently, the ruler made Syed Jalaluddin Ghazi (the eldest son), or one of his descendants, who were settled in Rohailkhand, a Chaar-Hazari (In those days the King kept a nominal army. Suitable individuals were awarded land ‚Äì usually consisting of a number of villages ‚Äì and they were required provide a designated number of fully equipped soldiers ‚Äì usually under the individual's command ‚Äì whenever the King required. Such nominees were known as Seh-Hazari (3000), Char-Hazari (4000), Panj-Hazari (5000)...Das-Hazari (10000), etc.). One of the descendants of Syed Jalaluddin Ghazi, Syed Ziauddin (also known as Syed Haya Shaheed) ‚Äìalso a Chaar-Hazari, was killed while on a mission to quell Rohilla uprising. He was buried in Doaba, Allahbad. His mazar is known as Mazar-e-Haya Shaheed, where, reportedly, people bring their sick, particularly children for healing and return satisfied. Son of Ziauddin, Syed Hasan, relinquished the Char-Hazari title/commitment and shifted to and settled down permanently in Mohalla Teergran of Nehtor.

In 1921, journalist Heywood Broun described her as \\"the best farce actress in New York\\". Early years Kennedy was born in Chicago. Her father was a judge in a criminal court. After she and her family lived in California, she moved to New York City with her mother to paint. She studied two years at the Art Students League, planning to be an illustrator. Luis Mora saw her art work and recommended that she go to Siasconset (in Nantucket, Massachusetts) for a summer. Career Theater The Siasconset colony was evenly divided among actors and artists, and painters often gave theatrical performances. Kennedy appeared in a skit written by Kenneth and Roy Webb and impressed professional Harry Woodruff, who commented, \\"She could act rings around anybody.\\" As a result, she was offered the lead opposite Woodruff in The Genius. Soon she was in Cleveland, Ohio, where Robert McLaughlin gave her work with his stock company. Kennedy first appeared on Broadway in Little Miss Brown (1912), a farce in three acts presented at the 48th Street Theater. Critics found Kennedy's performance most pleasing, writing, \\"Miss Kennedy's youth, good looks, and marked sense of fun helped her to make a decidedly favorable impression last night.\\" That same year she appeared in The Point of View. 1914 saw her in the popular Twin Beds, and in 1915 she scored a sensational hit at the Eltinge Theater as Blanny Wheeler opposite John Cumberland in Avery Hopwood's classic farce, Fair and Warmer, which ran 377 performances. Critic Louis Vincent DeFoe wrote, \\"Madge Kennedy proves anew that consummate art is involved even in farcical acting.\\" In the late Teens she would leave the stage for three years to appear in moving pictures for Samuel Goldwyn (see \\"Films\\" below). Kennedy returned to the New York stage in November 1920, playing in Cornered, staged at the Astor Theatre. Produced by Henry Savage, the play, taken from the writing of Dodson Mitchell, offered Kennedy a dual role. In 1923 she starred opposite W.C. Fields in Poppy, where she enjoyed top billing. In the comedy, Beware of Widows (1925), which was produced at Maxine Elliott Theatre, a reviewer for The New York Times noted, once again, Kennedy's physical beauty as well as her skill as a comedian. Later, she starred in Philip Barry's Paris Bound (1927) and in No√´l Coward's Private Lives (1931), having succeeded Gertrude Lawrence. After an absence of 33 years, she returned to Broadway in August 1965, appearing with her good friend Ruth Gordon in Gordon and Kanin's A Very Rich Woman. Films Frank Morgan and Madge Kennedy in a publicity still for the 1917 silent comedy Baby Mine. In 1917, Sam Goldwyn of Goldwyn Pictures signed Kennedy to a film contract. She starred in 21 five-reel films, such as Baby Mine (1917), Nearly Married (1917), Our Little Wife (1918), The Service Star (1918) and Dollars and Sense (1920). Kennedy told a reporter in 1916, \\"I have discovered that one of the best ways to act is to make your mind as vacant as possible.\\" In 1918, Our Little Wife premiered with Kennedy playing the role of Dodo Warren. The story is about a woman whose marriage is both humorous and sad. The screenplay was adapted from a comedy by Avery Hopwood. A Perfect Lady (1918) was released in December and was taken from a stage play by Channing Pollock and Rennold Wolf. Kennedy co-starred with James Montgomery. In 1923, she starred in The Purple Highway. The screenplay is an adaptation of the stage play Dear Me, written by Luther Reed and Hale Hamilton. The 1920s were a productive period for Kennedy. Following The Purple Highway, she had prominent roles in Three Miles Out (1924), Scandal Sheet (1925), Bad Company (1925), Lying Wives (1925), Oh, Baby! (1926), and Walls Tell Tales (1928). She was out of motion pictures until she resumed her career in The Marrying Kind (1952) and Main Street to Broadway (1953).

Hanley was an actor and radio personality. The couple resided in Los Angeles, California. Kennedy retired temporarily after her marriage before returning to work in entertainment. The couple would remain married until Hanley's death in 1959. She enjoyed outdoor activities such as playing golf, horseback riding and driving cars. She owned a Willys-Knight Great Six which she drove avidly at the time she was touring in 1929 in the play, Lulu. In August 1929, she was sued in a Norwich, Connecticut court for damages she caused in a car accident on the Boston Post Road near Groton, Connecticut, in June 1928. The plaintiffs asked for $13,000.\\"Madge Kennedy Is Sued $13,000\\". San Mateo Times, 31 August 1929, p. 8.

Development In the late thirties, there had been several projects to improve the Renault R35 light infantry tank. One of these was directed to the improvement of the horizontal rubber spring suspension system that, apart from being less reliable than originally hoped for, caused an uncomfortable ride, high track and tread wear and an unfavourable weight distribution. The type tended to get stuck in soft terrain. Several solutions were proposed, among them an overdrive, new wheel tyres, a freewheel in the gear box, the fitting of grousers or studs on the existing tracks, or the adoption of a new track type. None of these were satisfactory.Pascal Danjou & Fran√ßois Vauvillier, 2018, \\"Le char l√©ger R 40 ‚Äî premi√®re signature AMX\\", Histoire de Guerre, Blind√©s & Mat√©riel N¬∞ 125: 37-46 Apart from Lorraine, whose proposal based on the Lorraine 37L suspension was rejected as too heavy and complicated to refit, both the AMX factory and the Renault design bureau developed several solutions to this problem from 1937. AMX had its origin in a nationalisation of parts of the Renault company, which resulted in a natural rivalry between the two design bureaux. Renault proposed a type with doubled wheels on the original bogies (which thus would result in ten road wheels per side) combined with a new track using shorter links, a second type with vertical coil springs and a third type lengthened with a sixth road wheel at the rear, which would also entail a larger wheel diameter. The systems with the six larger wheels or the ten smaller ones could also be used to upgrade existing vehicles. However, after tests from 19 May until 26 December 1938, an AMX design using six vertical coil springs covered with 8 mm armour plating with twelve road wheels per side, was selected on 16 February 1939. The type superficially resembled the suspension of the earlier Char D1 and Char D2 but was in fact inspired by the Char B1 suspension. It also used the same track as the Char B1, reducing the number of track links compared with the R 35 from 125 to 56. The AMX suspension resulted in a superior speed on varied terrain and could climb steeper slopes. The Renault system with ten wheels to the contrary slowed the tank and led to a higher fuel consumption. This was not compensated by a discernible improvement of the steering qualities. However, the AMX system also had its drawbacks. It added a weight of 1.1 tonne to the tank, while the weight penalty was just seven hundred kilogrammes with the Renault six-wheel suspension and only 110 kilogrammes for the ten wheel system. Also, the longer track links caused a heavy clattering during road travel, reminiscent of the noise made by the Renault FT. Fuel consumption was 40% higher. The variant was named the Char l√©ger mod√®le 1935 R modifi√© 1939. At first, it was literally envisaged as a modification, also to be retrofitted to existing vehicles, but the emergency caused by the outbreak of war in September led to a change in policy: the new suspension would only be implemented on the R 35 production run, from the 1501st vehicle onwards, to take place in February 1940. In late 1939, retrofitting the existing vehicles with the cheaper Renault vertical coil suspension was considered, as it could be done by field workshops and thus pose less of a burden to French industry. Production The change, however, was delayed and went only in effect in May 1940 from the 1541st vehicle onwards. It coincided with a number of other improvements, such as a longer and thus much more powerful SA38 Long 35 37 mm gun in the adapted cast APX-R1 turret, giving the type a good antitank capacity, and a tail to facilitate climbing. The number of rounds carried decreased from 102 to 90. A fundamental advance in tactical effectiveness compared to the R 35 was that the R 40s were equipped with a radio set, which had not been standard for any French light tank until then. In May, about sixty R40s were manufactured out of a total R 35/40 production that month of 91.Fran√ßois Vauvillier, 2006, \\"Nos Chars en 1940: Pourquoi, Combien\\", Histoire de Guerre, Blind√©s & Mat√©riel N¬∞74, p.48 It is uncertain how many R 40s were produced before production was halted in June 1940; certainly 130 and probably 145 hulls were manufactured, but likely these did not all have their turret fitted. It had been intended to keep production levels at 120 per month for the duration of the war and introduce the lighter welded FCM turret in the second half of 1940. In May 1940, the R 35 had the largest production of any Allied (or indeed Western) tank but it was planned to having it surpassed by that of the much faster \\"H 39\\", reflecting the emphasis on the formation of new armoured divisions, for which the slow R 40 was less than ideal; the \\"new\\" suspension was really rather old-fashioned and could not be combined with a high speed, as earlier experience with the Char D3 and Renault VO projects had shown. Nevertheless, apart from donations to allies and units already formed in June, another 800 vehicles were needed to replace the Renault FTs of eight existing battalions and raise eight new battalions to bring their number to the planned final total of fifty light tank BCCs (Bataillions de Chars de Combat), forty of these equipped with Renault tanks.Fran√ßois Vauvillier, 2006, \\"Nos Chars en 1940: Pourquoi, Combien\\", Histoire de Guerre, Blind√©s & Mat√©riel N¬∞74, p.44 As the new vehicles looked quite differently from the original R 35, they were very generally, also in army documentation, called the \\"R 40\\"; however, this was never their official type designation; officially these were still Renault R35s and their production was subsumed under the R 35 run in the statistics; their serial numbers are continuous with the older R 35 run. Operational history Two new tank battalions, originally intended and trained to be equipped with Hotchkiss tanks to form the half-brigade of the new 4e DCR ( fourth armoured division of the Infantry), the 40e Bataillion de Chars de Combat and the 48e BCC, were during the campaign of 1940 from 19 May as an emergency measure partly equipped with the R 40 (30 and 29 respectively) and attached to the 2e DCR. This reflects the large mat√©riel reserve of Renault tanks. Some R 40s perhaps replaced losses in the older battalions. One of the two tank battalions of the Polish 10th Armoured Cavalry Brigade being formed in France was also partly equipped with first 24 R 40s, which were then on 31 May given to 25 BCC, after which the Polish battalion received another 28 R 40s, the last thirteen on 19 June. There are no known surviving R 40 vehicles.

He was selected at full-forward on the Football Team of the Millennium in 1999. Langan joined the team during the 1943 championship and was a regular member of the starting fifteen until his retirement following the conclusion of the 1956 championship. During that time he won two All- Ireland medals, five Connacht medals and two National League medals. Playing career Langan was born in Ballymachugh, Ballycastle, County Mayo. Despite his youth, Langan helped Ballycastle to win the Mayo senior championship of 1937. In 1938, he made his first appearance for Mayo's minor team in the All- Ireland Minor Football Championship. Five years later, he made his senior debut, playing at centre-half-forward. Langan was at his best during Mayo's golden period from 1948 to 1955, as they won five Connacht Senior Football Championships and two All-Irelands. Langan's first All-Ireland Final was in 1948, but a strong Cavan team beat Mayo by one point. In 1950, Langan was selected at full-forward for the first time in the All-Ireland semi-final against Armagh. He scored two goals in a Mayo win. Mayo also won the final against Louth, and Langan had his first All-Ireland medal. From then on, he won fame as one of the greatest full-forwards in football history. Langan's fielding and goals were again crucial in 1951. Mayo won the Connacht championship for the fourth successive time and advanced to the All-Ireland seni-final against Kerry. With Mayo behind in injury-time, Langan was switched to full-forward against the great Kerry full-back Paddy Bawn Brosnan. He scored a vital goal and Mayo went on to force a replay, which they won. They completed their second consecutive All-Ireland title by beating Meath by five points in the final, with Langan netting another fine goal. Langan also represented Connacht in the Railway Cup, earning a winner's medals against Munster in the 1951 Final. Langan's last appearance in county football was against Galway in the Connacht Championship of 1956. He retired following Galway's victory in that game. Post-Retirement Tom Langan was a Garda detective in Dublin at the time of his death in 1974, on the eve of his 53rd birthday. In 1984, the Gaelic Athletic Association centenary year he was honoured by being named on their Football Team of the Century. In 1999 he was again honoured by the GAA by being named on their Gaelic Football Team of the Millennium. On 16 September 1984, the Tom Langan Park was officially opened by Dr. M. Loftus, then President-elect of the G.A.A. It remains the home ground of the local Ballycastle club.

Historical places  Asirgarh Fort The Asirgarh Fort, at a distance about 17 km by road, has its importance in history and was known as 'Gateway to South (Dakshin ka Dwaar)'. It was so because whoever wants to win south had to win and pass through it. A victory over this fortress meant the kingdom of Khandesh, which in turn meant a smooth road to Deccan. It was considered as an impregnable fortress during Mugal Period. The ownership of the fort between 14th-16th Century was in hands of Adil Shah Farouqui. After him the fort passed on to his successor Bahadur Shah Faroqui who was not considered as a farsighted king. As soon as Akbar came to know of this he dispatched an army to conquer Asirgarh Fort. Bahadur Shah got the wind of Akbar's plans and he too proceeded swiftly and fortified his fortress. Consequently, the armies of the Mughal emperor were stuck here laying siege to the fort for almost 10 years. It is evidence of how well-stocked the fortress was during that time that people and army inside had enough provision for food and water. Every attempt to take the fort was repulsed by the soldiers of the Shah. Finally sick of the battle, Akbar one day called Bahadur Shah to his camp for a meeting and there had him summarily dispatched to happy hunting grounds above. When the dying king accused Akbar of treachery, the emperor replied with that age-old lesson, \\"Everything is fair in Politics and government.\\" Later Akbar showered gold and silver on Bahadur Shah's generals and won his way through to the fort. Finally on 17 January 1609 Akbar became the lord of the Asirgarh fort. Since then the fort remained in the hands of the Mughals. The fortress is home to a tenth-century temple of Shiva. Asha mandir of Hindu Goddess Asha- devi is located on the hills of this village. In the vicinity of Asirgarh, there is a tomb of Shah Nomani Asiri, a saint, a believer of Sufism. Moti Mahal, the burial place of Moti Begam, beloved of Shah Jahan is to the left of the fort and situated at the bank of Pandhar River.  Mythology  'Sita- Nahaani' in the nearby village 'Bid' has its relations with 'Ramaayan'. It is said that Lord Shri Ram while in 'Vanvaas' once stayed at this place where Sita took bath. The source of sweet water here is said to be made by the arrow of Lord Shri Ram. The Shiv Temple at Asirgarh Fort is known by the people as the place where 'Ashwaththama' (Son of Dronacharaya, Mahabharat epic) use to visit regularly (even today) to worship Lord Shiv. In 1970 Shri Veerabhadreshwar Swamy temple has been established by Veershaiva Lingayata community. Temple is inaugurated (pranpratishtha) by Sri 1008 Jagadguru doctor Chandrashekhar Shivacharya Mahaswamiji, pithadhipati (director) of Sri Jagadguru Vishvaradhya Gyanasimhasana Jangamavadi math, Varanasi, India.

Rahman led a group of junior army officers who overthrew Sheikh Mujib's regime and installed Khondaker Mushtaque Ahmed as president. On 28 January 2010, Rahman was hanged along with Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, A.K.M. Mohiuddin Ahmed, Mohiuddin Ahmed, and Mohammad Bazlul Huda in Old Dhaka Central Jail.  Career  In 1974, Rahman was placed in charge of recovering weapons in Demra, Munshiganj District, Narayanganj District, and Narsingdi District. He had experienced some things which made him critical of the Bangladesh Awami League government. In 1975 Rahman was a Major in the Bangladesh Army. He spoke against Sheikh Mujibur Rahman to his fellow Army officers. He also told them that Sheikh Mujibur Rahman would give Bangladesh to India and that Sheikh Mujibur Rahman would establish a monarchy in Bangladesh. He and Major Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan discussed ways of removing Sheikh Mujibur Rahman from power and asked Brigadier General Ziaur Rahman for support. Zia expressed his inability to support them. Zia asked them to do what they think is necessary. They were supported covertly by senior cabinet minister Khondaker Mushtaque Ahmed who was introduced to Rahman by Major Khandaker Abdur Rashid. On 12 August 1975 he discussed the plans with his fellow officers at his wedding anniversary party at the Officers Club, Dhaka. There the officers finalised 15 August 1975 as the day they would launch the coup. On 14 August 1975, Syed Faruque Rahman met Captain Abdul Aziz Pasha, Captain Bazlul Huda, Major Khandaker Abdur Rashid, Major Shariful Haque Dalim, Major S.H.M.B Noor Chowdhury, Major Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan, Major Rashed Chowdhury, and other officer met in his office to finalize the plan. According to the plan Rahman commanded the tanks of the Bengal Lancers. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was killed in his house by Captain Bazlul Huda and Major Noor on 15 August 1975. Immediately after the killing, the officers rendezvoused at the Bangladesh Betar office, and installed Khondakar Mushtaque Ahmed as the new president of Bangladesh. Khondakar Mushtaque called the assassins Surja Santan (the gallant sons) and passed the Indemnity Ordinance which protected the assassins from legal prosecution. Rahman was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel and held a position of power in the new regime until it was overthrown in a counter-coup by pro-Mujib officers led by Maj. Gen. Khaled Mosharraf, who ousted Khondakar Mushtaque. However, 7 November 1975 coup against the Mosharraf by Lt. Col. Abu Taher brought Maj. Gen. Ziaur Rahman to power. Ziaur Rahman was freed by Major Mohiuddin Ahmed. Ziaur Rahman after assuming power appointed the assassins in the diplomatic corps in foreign posts with the exception o Syed Faruque Rahman and Sultan Shahriar Rashid Khan refused to accept the diplomatic posts. In 1979, the Bangladeshi parliament under Ziaur Rahman's Bangladesh Nationalist Party converted the Indemnity ordinance into an official act of parliament. Faruque Rahman was dismissed from Bangladesh Army for his role in Mutinies in Savar Cantonment and Bogra Cantonment and sent abroad. The assassins were removed from government service after they tried to launch a coup against Ziaur Rahman in 1980. After the assassination of Ziaur Rahman in 1981, Rahman returned to active politics by founding the Freedom Party and running for the presidency against Lt. Gen. Hussain Muhammad Ershad in 1986. He maintained ties with ULFA in Assam, India. Trial and execution In 1996, the Awami League under the leadership of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's daughter, Sheikh Hasina won the general election and became the Prime Minister of Bangladesh. Under her party's majority, the Indemnity Act was repealed and a court case initiated over the killing of Mujib and his family. In August 1996 he was arrested by the Bangladesh Police. In 1998, the Dhaka High Court sentenced Syed Faruque Rahman to death. After the Awami League's defeat in the 2001 general election, the BNP government of Begum Khaleda Zia slowed down the proceedings in the Mujib murder case. In October 2007 he filed an appeal with the Bangladesh Supreme Court. After Sheikh Hasina returned to power in 2009, the court case was restarted. After Rahman's plea for clemency was denied by the Supreme Court of Bangladesh, he was executed along with other plotters on 28 January 2010.

The Institute represented over 33,000 members in New Zealand and overseas. Most accountants in New Zealand belonged to the institute. New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants and the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia (ICAA) amalgamated to become Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand. The Institute adopted the name Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand in 1996. Prior to that, it was known as the New Zealand Society of Accountants. In November 2013 Members of The Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia and the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants voted yes on a proposal to create One New Institute: \\"Institute of Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand\\". Structure There are three \\"Colleges\\" or membership groupings within the institute. New Zealand is unusual among the major CA Institutes worldwide in offering both Chartered Accountant and Associate Chartered Accountant designations. Chartered Accountants The Chartered Accountant designation denotes an accountant who has completed the CAANZ program including the exams and practical components and is a full member of the institute. Members who complete a further examination and practical experience are qualified to offer accountancy services to the public. Members of the CA College term themselves Chartered Accountants and use the designatory letters CA. Associate Chartered Accountants Members of the Associate Chartered Accountant College use the designatory letters ACA. The Associate Chartered Accountant designation is a mid-level qualification. Members of the ACA College must complete professional education requirements, but are not entitled to offer service to the public. The designation Associate Chartered Accountant is not directly comparable to the Associate Chartered Accountant (ACA) designation offered by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales and the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland. Accounting Technicians NZICA includes among its members persons qualified at accounting technician level who belong to the College of Accounting Technicians and may use the designatory letters AT. New Zealand's practice in this respect is not followed in other countries. For example, in the United Kingdom, accounting technicians generally belong to the Association of Accounting Technicians. Mutual recognition agreements The institute has mutual recognition agreements with the following Institutes: * Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants * Institute of Chartered Accountants of Australia * Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales * Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants * Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland * Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland * South African Institute of Chartered Accountants * American Institute of Certified Public Accountants NZICA members may admit to full memberships of the above institutions after passing an aptitude test or subject to other specific requirements. (As per regulations). Membership of NZICA through a mutual recognition agreement is subject to meeting certain criteria, including knowledge of New Zealand tax and law. Members of the following professional associations are given limited advanced standing by NZICA: * Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) Exemptions to ACCA have been removed altogether recently. * CPA Australia * Institute of Chartered Accountants of India NZICA terminated mutual recognition agreements with ACCA and CPA Australia in 2003. Members of the Association of Accounting Technicians may obtain advanced standing for membership of the College of Accounting Technicians. Fellowship Fellowship, or senior membership, of NZICA may be awarded to a member of the CA College for service to the institute, or high achievement in the profession. Public practice Members of the College of Chartered Accountants may apply for a Certificate of Public Practice. Every member of the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants who offers accounting services to the public must be a Chartered Accountant and hold a Certificate of Public Practice (CPP). The requirements for the issuing of this certificate are that (amongst others) a member must have had two years of acceptable practical experience while a member of the College of Chartered Accountants and have attended a course for new practitioners.   History  Accounting in New Zealand ‚Äì Timeline *1894 ‚Äì Incorporated Institute of Accountants of New Zealand *1898 ‚Äì New Zealand Accountants' and Auditors' Association [based in Auckland and had female members at the time of the formation of the Society in 1908. Early minutes are held in offsite storage. Auckland Branch have details.] *1908 ‚Äì New Zealand Society of Accountants Act (sponsored by both the above bodies). Established the Society with the purpose \\"to control and regulate the practice of the profession of accountancy in New Zealand\\". Note that there is a copy of the Act in the Library's archive of Institute and Society publications. The new Act became law on 15 September of that year with Peter Barr, one of the earliest advocates of unity of the profession in New Zealand, as the society's first president. Note: the Bill was introduced by Premier, Sir Joseph Ward, himself an accountant.Teara *1909 - First members admitted in 1909. Member no. 1 George Abercrombie. There is an entry for Peter Barr, the Society's first president, in the Dictionary of NZ Biography. Early in 1909, advertisements appeared in the national press inviting applications for admission to the Society for those with the qualifications set out in the Act. On 7 December the Board delivered a letter to the first meeting of the Council sitting in the Chamber of Commerce Hall. A copy of this letter is on p. 26 of Graham's 'First Fifty Years.' *1910 ‚Äì Had reached agreement with the University of New Zealand for the subjects on its education syllabus to be included in the new Bachelor of Commerce degree. *1922 ‚Äì Society establishes The Accountants Journal (TAJ). *1933 ‚Äì Companies Act 1933 restricts the appointment of company auditors to members of the Society. There was no regulation of corporate financial reporting by the Society prior to World War II. Reporting was largely open to individual interpretation as the Companies Acts of 1903, 1908 and 1933 imposed only \\"lightweight external regulation\\" (Keenan, 2000, p. 97). *1944 ‚Äì New Zealand Institute of Cost Accountants founded. Affiliated with the NZSA in 1960; in 1966 it ceased to exist, with its activities being assumed by the NZSA. *1946 ‚Äì Council of the NZSA adopted seven of the ten recommendations on accounting principles issued by ICAEW. These were issued to members in a booklet titled Recommendations on Accounting Principles (NZSA, 1946).See Zeff (p.13) for a list of the seven adopted. Alterations to the originals were minor. *1948 ‚Äì British Companies Act 1948 \\"prefigured a new and more onerous external regulation of corporate financial reporting in New Zealand\\"Keenan, 2000, p. 97 *1950 ‚Äì Accounting Practice and Procedure Committee (APPC). Its functions were to \\"make pronouncements for the guidance of members\\" and \\"give evidence to on behalf of the Society before various [Government] committees\\" (TAJ, August 1950, p. 271, Cited in Keenan, 2000, p. 98). The committee's first two meetings discussed the development of accounting and auditing standards, and revisions to Recommendations on Accounting Principles. This however stalled and fell off the agenda. Keenan (2000) suggests that this was due to poor resourcing of the APPC as well as contention over the respective strengths of a collegiate vs individual approach to regulation. Also in 1950 the NZ Accountants' and Auditors' Association merged with the Society. *1955 ‚Äì Companies Act 1955 *1958 ‚Äì New Zealand Society of Accountants Act 1958. Contained provision authorising Society to \\"regulate the practice of the profession\\" in NZ. This was seen as grounds for the Society to establish accounting and auditing standards (Zeff, 1979, p. 1). *1959‚Äì60 ‚Äì University of New Zealand establishes chairs of accounting at each of its four main colleges. *1961 ‚Äì APPC replaced by the Board of Research and Publications (BRAP). Contained mixed membership of academics and practitioners. *1962 ‚Äì May 1962 the BRAP approved commencement of a long-term project entitled Recommendations on Standards of Best Accounting Practice (TAJ, July 1962, p. 374, cited in Keenan, 2000, p. 100). *1964 ‚Äì 1969 BRAP releases eight Tentative Statements on Accounting and Auditing Practice. Preamble to each Tentative Statement explained that statements issued in sequel to these would not be mandatory in any way. This highlights the continued predominance of individual over collegial regulation (Keenan states eight but Bradbury only mentions four). *1964 ‚Äì The first of the eight Tentative Statements, Presentation of Balance Sheet and Profit and Loss, was published in October 1964. This statement was the first official recommendation on an accounting standard that was not a transcription or pure adaptation of an English Institute Recommendation (Bradbury, 1999, p. 7). Note: The first Tentative Statements on Auditing appeared in October and November 1964. *1966 ‚Äì At the AGM of the NZ Institute of Cost Accountants held on 17 May 1966, it was resolved to wind up the Institute and transfer the funds and property remaining at 30 June 1966 to the New Zealand Society of Accountants. As part of the agreement, members of the institute, at the date of winding up, would become members of the newly formed Cost and Management Accounting Division of the New Zealand Society of Accountants. [see CMA section for full details] *1966 ‚Äì Second tentative statement on deferred tax issued in October 1966. This adopted a position closer to the US's Accounting Research Bulletin No 44. *1966 ‚Äì First Statement on Accounting Practice released in September 1966 by BRAP. *1967 ‚Äì BRAP recommendations on various measures to encourage compliance with generally accepted accounting principles and standards. Zeff (1979, p. 43) suggests that the Board may have been influenced by recent granting of authority by the Council of the AICPA to its Accounting Principles Board. *1968 ‚Äì Editorial in TAJ entitled \\"Improving Accounting Standards\\" gave strong support to requiring members' compliance with collegiate regulation. The editorial uses the threat of external enforced regulation by suggesting that a failure to enforce compliance will result in the widening of the role of the Registrar of Companies, or the creation of an independent organisation such as the US S.E.C. *1969 ‚Äì Council accepts BRAP proposal due process. Proposed due process: A Statement, after being exposed as a Tentative Statement and revised, if necessary, by the BRAP, would be submitted to Council for consideration. Council could refer back to the BRAP. Council could pronounce, within twelve months of receipt, that the Statement was required (mandatory), or recommended (voluntary), or that the Statement be approved for publication without comment. *1970 ‚Äì 1973 Above proposal comes into force. Three more Tentative Statements issued. Most significant was the Tentative Statement on Auditing Practice No.5: Auditing Standards. *1972 ‚Äì The Incorporated Institute of Accountants of New Zealand wound up its affairs and transferred its funds to the NZSA. The Society was now the only national organisation in the field. *1973 ‚Äì Council (NZSA) established a Professional Standards Committee to issue Statements of Standard Accounting Practice. Supersedes BRAP (?). *1973 ‚Äì Formation of International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC) in June 1973. *1974 ‚Äì Council approves Standard 7: Auditing Practice. This attempts to enforce adoption of financial reporting statements by linking compliance to Statements on Accounting Practice in the preparation of company accounts to a standard of auditing practice. For although not all company directors were members of the NZSA, creating a gap in the mandatory regime, all company auditors were members of the NZSA. Departures from the standards were to be referred to in the audit report and, where appropriate, result in a qualified opinion. The standards still did not have legal backing, however. This didn't come until 1993 with the passing of the Financial Reporting Act 1993. *1974 ‚Äì NZSA became associate member of the IASC. Required NZSA to distribute IASC exposure drafts and transmit comments back to the IASC. See Bradbury (1999, p. 7) for a comparative table of the first ten standards issued by the ARSB and IASC. *1989 ‚Äì July 1989 the Public Finance Act passed. Requires Crown government departments and Crown agencies to prepare financial statements in accordance with GAAP and have them audited. Similar requirements placed on local authorities in the same year. [source: CAJ, July 2004, p. 26] *1990 ‚Äì 2 NZSA's Accounting Research and Standards Board issues seven exposure drafts which together comprised a proposed conceptual framework for financial reporting in NZ [A Proposed Framework for Financial Reporting in New Zealand, December 1991]. This framework proposed a set of concepts intended to apply to all sectors, i.e. sector neutral. The framework drew on the Australian (AARF) and US (FASB) conceptual frameworks and also corresponds with IASC framework. See Hooper et al. (1999, Ch. 7) or Mathews & Perera (1996, Ch.6) for further detail. *1993 ‚Äì Statement of Concepts for General Purpose Financial Reporting to cover all general purpose financial reports from 1 January 1995. *1993 ‚Äì The Financial Reporting Act 1993 established the Accounting Standards Review Board (ASRB) to approve FRSs. Provides overt legislative backing to financial reporting standards. The council of the NZSA appoints the Financial Reporting Standards Board (FRSB) to coordinate the development of financial reporting standards (FRSs), formerly known as statements of standard accounting practice (SSAPs). Generally accepted accounting practice (GAAP) in NZ is defined by all FRSs and SSAPs on issue. These FRSs and SSAPs are to be issued by the FRSB of the Society of Accountants and then approved by the ASRB under the Financial Reporting Act 1993, which effectively gives them legal backing. *1994 ‚Äì Fiscal Responsibility Act 1994. Reinforces requirement on central government to use GAAP. *1996 ‚Äì Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand Act 1996 *1997 ‚Äì FRSB decides to pursue policy of international harmonisation. *1999 ‚Äì In May the first two exposure drafts based on IASB pronouncements are issued (EDs 86 and 87). *2001 ‚Äì International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) assumed responsibility (from the IASC) for setting accounting standards and designated International Financial Reporting Standards on 1 April 2001. *2002 ‚Äì Financial Reporting Council (FRC) in Australia announces that from January 2005 international accounting standards would be adopted in Australia. October 2002 ‚Äì Accounting Standards Review Board (ASRB) recommends to NZ government that listed issuers should comply from January 2007, with the option to adopt in January 2005. Samkin (2005, p. 9) notes: This recommendation departs from that made by the FRSB in ED-92, issued in June 2002, to the effect that financial reporting standards would be developed from international standards and that departures from these would only be made in rare and exceptional circumstances. No departures would now be permitted. December 2002 ‚Äì ASRB announced that for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2007, New Zealand reporting entities would be required to apply International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in the preparation of their external financial reports. However, entities would have the option to adopt IFRS early from 1 January 2005. New standards will apply to all general purpose financial reports, defined as: reports intended to provide information to meet the needs of those external users who are unable to require, or contract for, the preparation of special reports to meet there specific information needs. *2004 ‚Äì 24 November the Accounting Standards Review Board approved the stable platform of New Zealand Equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards (NZ IFRS). *2005 ‚Äì Voluntary adoption of NZ IFRS from 1 January. It appears that in the main only larger listed companies have taken the opportunity to adopt early. *2005 ‚Äì The Institute of Chartered Accountants began operating as the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants in August 2005. *2007 ‚Äì January 2007 NZ IFRS take mandatory effect for periods beginning on or after 1 January. NZ IFRS replaces the FRSs and SSAPs that defined pre-2007 GAAP. Institute of Cost Accountants #At the AGM of the NZ Institute of Cost Accountants held on 17 May 1966, it was resolved to wind up the Institute and transfer the funds and property remaining at 30 June 1966 to the New Zealand Society of Accountants. As part of the agreement, members of the institute, at the date of winding up, would become members of the newly formed Cost and Management Accounting Division of the New Zealand Society of Accountants. #Following considerable debate over the preceding two years, this CMA Division was wound up and a National Corporate Sector Committee established in June 1988. It was noted in the Accountants Journal of May 1988 that : \\"Members of the CMA Division will be entitled to use the CMA designation as long as they are members of the Society\\". #The rules passed in 1996 when the NZSA became the Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand allowed for three designations ‚Äì CA, ACA and AT. There does not appear to be any reference to CMA. It would appear from this that former members of the Institute of Cost Accountants are now regular members of the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants. Notes Bibliography *Accounting.

Kerrigan in 1911. Joseph Michael Kerrigan (16 December 1884 ‚Äì 29 April 1964), better known as J. M. Kerrigan, was an Irish character actor. Life Kerrigan was born in Dublin, Ireland. He worked as a newspaper reporter until 1907 when he joined the famous Abbey Players. There he became a stalwart, appearing in plays by Lady Gregory, William Butler Yeats and John Millington Synge (for whom he played the role of Shawn Keogh in The Playboy of the Western World. His first screen appearance was in the 1916 silent film Food of Love. By the 1920s he was appearing on Broadway, often in plays by Shakespeare, Ibsen, and Sheridan. He settled permanently in Hollywood in 1935, having been recruited along with several other Abbey performers, to appear in John Ford's The Informer. In that film and in Ford's The Long Voyage Home, he plays similar roles, that of a leech who attaches himself to men until they run out of money. Perhaps his best known role was in The General Died at Dawn, where he plays a character actually named Leach, in which he steals scenes from Gary Cooper, Madeleine Carroll and William Frawley. In it he plays a sinister little petty thief who, holding a gun on Cooper, says, \\"I may be fat, but I'm agile.\\" He had little screen time in films which he starred as minor roles, such as the \\"First Drayman\\" in Merely Mary Ann (1931) with Janet Gaynor. One of his most recognizable minor roles was in Gone with the Wind (1939), in which he played John Gallegher, the seemly jovial mill owner who whips his convict labour in to \\"co-operation\\". He appeared in Walt Disney's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954), the famous film version of Jules Verne's Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea in a minor role at the beginning of the film. In 1946, he tried breaking into Broadway shows, playing the discombobulated leprechaun Jackeen J. O'Malley in the show \\"Barnaby and Mr. O'Malley\\", based on the Crockett Johnson comic strip. J.M. Kerrigan died in Hollywood on 29 April 1964, aged 79.

The founder of Nilakottai Kulappa Nayajar came from Vijayanagaram in the year of 1366 A.D before the period of Vishwanatha Nayak.  Kulappa Nayak  Nilakottai was a very fine palayam, consisting mainly of arable lands. For his military help to the emperor of Vijayanagar in repelling an invasion, Makkala Nayaka, of the Kambala caste, was rewarded with lands west of Madura where, with the Krishna Devaraya Raya's permission, he built the mud fort of Nilakkottai in 1366 A.D. He ruled for 12 years and was succeeded by his son Kulappa Nayaka. Along with the Pandya King Chandra Sekara of Madura, Kulappa was dispossessed by a Chola Prince named Veera Sekara Chozha, and both defeated rulers appealed to the Krishna Deva Raya for help. Krishna Deva Raya sent Kotikam Nagama Nayakar to his aid. Nagama Nayakka suppressed the Chozha ruler and took Madurai,but suddenly he threw off his allegiance and declining to help the Pandya king, usurped the throne . The Vijaya Nagar Emperor demanded that someone cure the defection. Nagama's own son Viswanaha volunteered. He overthrew his father and handed him over to the emperor. As a reward for his loyalty the emperor appointed Viswanha as the governor of Madurai. When Vishwa Natha Nayakka ruled Tamil Nadu Kulappa Nayakkar helped him in many wars with his troops. For example,when Pandiya was giving trouble to Madurai country,Kulappa Nayakkar controlled their revolt with his troops. After Vishwanatha Nayak, Madurai was ruled by Krishappa nayakkar(1554‚Äì72). Under British Rule There is not enough rain for agriculture in Nilakotttai so Kulappa Nayakar could not pay his tribute to British government.

These actions were elsewhere called the Rape of Belgium. The Manifesto galvanized support for the war throughout German schools and universities, but many foreign intellectuals were outraged. Wilhelm Foerster soon repented having signed the document and soon with Georg Friedrich Nicolai they drew up the Manifesto to the Europeans. They argued \\"it seems not just a good thing, but a dire necessity, that educated men of all nations direct their influence in such a way that the terms of the peace not become the wellspring of future wars - uncertain though the outcome of the war may now still seem. The fact that this war has plunged all European relations into an equally unstable and plastic state should rather be put to use to create out of Europe an organic whole.\\" Whilst various people expressed sympathy with these sentiments, only Otto Buek and Albert Einstein agreed to sign it and it remained unpublished at the time. It was subsequently brought to light by Einstein. A report in 1921 in The New York Times found that of 76 surviving signatories, 60 expressed varying degrees of regret.

During a particularly cold New York winter, George starts to suspect that he is not himself but the creation of someone else, someone he calls \\"Mr. Sunshine.\\" Sunshine and George enter into a battle of wits to determine who should be called \\"creator.\\" Did George create himself?

There is the mysterious Cornell student Aurora Borealis Smith with whom Stephen Titus George falls in love. There is the Norse God Ragnarok wielding his Pollaxe. There are the Bohemians, a dog named Luther, a cat named Blackjack, Puck, and Calliope, a fire-breathing paper dragon. And let's not forget evil forces like Rasferret the Grub, a mannequin called Rubbermaid, and an army of rats.

It is also commonly used to clean black-powder weapons after use, since the lack of petroleum-based oil and the presence of vegetable oil lessens the amount of sludge that is created when cleaning black powder residues from weapons.

Murphy Oil Soap is also an excellent lubricant to use with water when throwing clay on a potter's wheel.

Miller and Dashiell were also the host-announcer team for Top Card, the quiz show that 10 Seconds replaced on the schedule following its cancellation. Maingame Two contestants, one usually a returning champion, competed in a game of identifying songs. Nine categories were displayed. Each category was the clue to the title of a song, and each one hid a point value. The player in control chose a category, revealing how many points the category was worth. The higher the points were, the more difficult the song would be to identify. After a category was chosen, Miller would tell the players the year the song was released, the singer's music style, whether the singer was a man or woman (or in other cases, whether it was sung by a duo or group), and the song's peak position on the Billboard music charts; if the song was a country song or pop song, the contestants were told of the peak position on either of those charts, while if the song reached the Billboard Hot 100 its peak position on that chart would be revealed. Once all that information was revealed, it was up to the opposing player to decide how long the player would have to listen to the song. The opponent would choose a number of seconds of music to be played, between 1 and 10 seconds. At that point, the player who chose the category decided to play that song or pass it to their opponent. The clip would be played; answering correctly won the points while failure to come up with a correct answer gave the points to the opposing player. A player could only give each number of seconds once per round. The player that's trailing get the next category. Two rounds were played. In the first round categories were worth between 10 and 50 points, in five-point increments, and it was possible for the same number to appear multiple times on the board. In the second round, points ranged from 20 to 100, still in five-point increment, and in addition, the last category left on the board at the end of the second round was played for double its value for a possible 200 points. Catch-Up round In the third and final round, called the \\"Catch-Up Round\\", the trailing player had a chance to earn up to 400 points. A ten-second medley of three songs were played and the player had to identify the artist behind each song. Each correct answer was worth 100 points, and a bonus of 100 points was given if the player got all three. If the trailer was able to catch and/or pass the leader, the leader was given his/her own ten second medley to try to regain the lead and win the game. Whichever player was ahead at the end of the Catch-Up round won the game, an additional prize and played the bonus round for a chance at a cash jackpot. Note: The Catch-Up round was not played if the trailing player did not have enough points to be in catch-up range. Bonus round In the bonus round, the winning player was given 60 seconds to name nine songs. As before, there were nine categories on the game board. Unlike the front game, the categories were played in order, moving from left to right, top to bottom. The song fitting the category was played for several seconds. For each song the champion correctly identified, he/she won a prize and the prizes grew in value for each correct answer. If the champion could not identify the song fitting the category, it was blocked and could be tried again after all nine categories had been played (time permitting). Getting all nine songs before time expired won the champion a cash jackpot, which started out at $2,500 (later $1,000) and increased by $500 each day until it was claimed. The highest jackpot won was $10,500. Champions continued until defeated or the jackpot was won.

Early life Picture of the Qahqaheh Castle. Ismail was the son of Shah Tahmasp I by an Iraqi Turkoman mother from the area of Mosul, Sultanum Begum Mawsillu.Andrew J. Newman, Safavid Iran (IB Tauris, 2004) p. 42 In 1547, he was appointed governor of the province of Shirvan where he led several expeditions against the Ottomans. In 1556 he became governor of Khorasan but one of his father's leading courtiers, Masum Beg Safavi, convinced the shah that Ismail was plotting to overthrow him. Ismail spent the next 20 years in the prison at Qahqaheh Castle.Savory p. 68. On 18 October 1574, Tahmasp became ill‚Äîduring his illness, he was close to dying two times, and he still hadn't chosen a successor. Thus the main chieftains of the Qizilbash arranged a meeting to discuss about who should be the successor. The Ustajlu clan, and the Shaykhavand clan (which was related to the Safavid family) favored Haydar Mirza Safavi. The Georgians also supported him, since his mother was Georgian. The Rumlu, Afshar, and the Qajar clan favoured Ismail, who was still jailed in the Qahqaheh Castle. Tahmasp's favorite Circassian daughter Pari Khan Khanum also favoured him. While Tahmasp was still ill, those who supported Haydar Mirza, sent a message to the castellan of Qahqaheh Castle, named Khalifa Ansar Qaradghlu. They requested him to have Ismail killed. However, Pari Khan Khanum managed to find out about it and told Tahmasp about the plot. Tahmasp, who still had some feelings for Ismail due to the courage he used to have in the battles with the Ottoman Empire, sent a group of Afshar musketeers to the Qahqaheh Castle to protect him. Two months later, Tahmasp recovered from the life-threatening illness he had. Two years later, on 14 May 1576, he died in Qazvin. Haydar Mirza was the only son who was with him when he died, and thus the following day, he announced himself as the new king. Normally, some Qizilbash tribes would guard the royal palace and take turns with other others‚Äîunfortunately for Haydar Mirza, on that day all the Qizilbash guards were either from the Rumlu, Afshar, Qajar, Bayat, or the Dorsaq tribe‚Äîall loyal supporters of Ismail. When Haydar Mirza found out about the dangerous position he was in, he took Pari Khan Khanum (who was also in the palace) \\"into custody as a precautionary measure\\" (Parsadust). Pari Khan Khanum then \\"threw herself at her brother's feet in the presence of Haydar Mirza's mother\\", and tried to urge him to let her leave the palace, stating that she was the first to acknowledge his rule by making a prostrating to him‚Äîshe vowed that she would attempt to persuade Ismail Mirza's supporters to change their mind, which included her full brother Suleiman Mirza and uncle Shamkhal Sultan. Haydar Mirza accepted her request, and gave her permission to leave the palace. However, after she left the palace, she broke her oath and gave Shamkhal the keys to the gate of the palace. When the supporters of Haydar Mirza found out about the threat their king was in, they hurried to his royal residence to save him. However, the palace guards, who disliked Haydar Mirza (although he had tried to win them to his side by making several promises) closed the entrances of the palace. At the same time, the supporters of Ismail Mirza, entered the palace and went to its inner part. However, Haydar Mirza's supporters shortly managed to break through the gate, but did not reach there in time‚ÄîIsmail Mirza's supporters found Haydar Mirza, dressed as a woman in the royal harem. He was immediately captured and beheaded. His bloody head was then thrown down to Haydar Mirza's supporters, who stopped their resistance, which thus meant that Ismail Mirza could safely ascend the throne. During the dynastic struggle between the two brothers, Pari Khan Khanum became the de facto ruler of the state; it was she who ordered all the princes and top- ranking members of the realm to gather at Qazvin's main mosque on 23 May 1576, where a famous cleric named Mir Makhdum Sharifi, read the khutbah in the name of Ismail Mirza, thus confirming him as the new king of the Safavid dynasty. Ismail Mirza, who was still in the Qahqaheh Castle, was shortly escorted out of the place with thousands of Qizilbash warriors and reached the countryside of Qazvin on 4 June 1576. During the 31 days since the death of Tahmasp I, the courtiers and leaders of the Qizilbash clans had visited the palace of Pari Khan Khanum everyday and according to Iskandar Beg Munshi, \\"informed her of the urgent business of the realm be it fiscal or financial or to do with politics of the day and nobody had any inclination or dared to disobey her command\\". After entering Qazvin, Ismail Mirza did not advance to the royal palace directly since the astrologists had stated that the time was ominous. He thus stayed for 14 days at the house of Husaynquli Khulafa, the leader of the Rumlu clan, and the Khalifat al-Khulafa (administrator of Sufi affairs). Although Ismail Mirza held the title of king, the majority of the Qizilbash commanders and high-ranking statesmen persisted to visit Pari Khan Khanum's palace ordinarily. At the same time, Pari Khan Khanum had managed to organize a remarkable court for herself \\"where her attendants and ladies-in-waiting acted as if they were serving at a proper royal court\\" (Parsadust).  Reign  right Ismail Mirza ascended to the throne under the dynastic name of Ismail II in 22 August 1576. His 19 years of imprisonment in the Qahqaheh castle had deeply affected him, and thus he was not inclined to allow displays of authority by any other person at his own cost. He announced that it was prohibited for Qizilbash chieftains, commander, and high-ranking officials to enter Pari Khan Khanum's palace. He dissolved the services of her guards and her court attendants and seized an extensive space of properties belonging to her. Moreover, he embraced a cold and non-approachable behaviour when he allowed her an audience. Furthermore, he began executing members of the faction who had opposed him, and also turned on some of his other supporters besides Pari Khan Khanum. He killed or blinded five of his own brothers and four other Safavid princes, including Ibrahim Mirza, so they would be unable to take the throne from him. Ismail, in his campaigns in the Caucasus, brought another 30,000 Georgians and Circassians captives to Iran, further setting on the program of creating a new layer in Persian society, which was already initiated by his father Tahmasp I.Oberling, Pierre, Georgians and Circassians in Iran, The Hague, 1963; pp.127-143 Described as being a \\"Sunni in sympathy,\\" he also implemented a pro-Sunni policy and began reversing the imposition of Shi'ism in Iran (which he ultimately sought to abolish) and appointed Sunni- leaning ulema. One belief is that the aim of his pro-Sunni measures was to strengthen his own internal and external political position by appealing to the still strong Sunni sympathies of the Persian population and to placate the Ottomans. Having fought so hard to make Ismail II king of the Safavid dynasty, Pari Khan Khanum was now met with lack of gratitude from him. The way she was treated by Ismail II made her hostile towards him, and made her prepare to exact vengeance. On 25 November 1577, Ismail II died abruptly and without any initial signs of bad health. The court doctors, who checked the corpse, suspected that he may have died from poison. The general agreement was that Pari Khan Khanum had resolved to poison him with the help of concubines of the inner harem in retaliation for his bad behaviour towards her. Ismail was a poet, painter and calligrapher, who supported the arts.

It is arguably one of the highest lakes in the United States, after the evaporation of Ka Wai o Pele in 2018 the only lake on Hawai ªi Island, and one of very few lakes at all in the state of Hawai ªi. It is relatively small, only about 100 m across, and varies in size as the water level rises and falls. At high water levels a small outlet stream appears at the northwest end, but it is absorbed into the ground after a short distance. The name means \\"swirling water\\" in Hawaiian, though it is usually rather placid. It usually freezes in winter, but aquatic insects such as midges and beetles can be found breeding in the water.  Description  Lake Waiau is located inside the Pu'u Waiau cinder cone at an altitude of 3970 m. It is approximately heart shaped and its diameter reaches about 100 m. The average surface area of the lake is around 6000 m2. The size of its surface area fluctuates significantly over the year. It reaches its peak during spring with a maximal depth between 2 m and 2.5 m and by the end of the summer it often has shrunk to one third of its original size with a maximal depth below 1 m. A spillover into the Pohakuloa Gulch occurs when the lake depth is more than 2.3 m. The lake is only fed by precipitation which occurs primarily during the winter; its catchment area is about 135,000 m2 mostly located within the Pu'u Waiau cinder cone. The lake is an anomaly in the peak region of Mauna Kea as everywhere else the ground is unable to retain water. The exact nature of the impermeable ground layer of the lake is still unknown. It is assumed that fine-grained densely compressed ash, basalt rock or a small permafrost layer may play a role. No permafrost layer has been established so far for the lake area itself, but it was found at another location in the peak area. Established however is a 7.5 m thick sediment layer at the bottom of the lake.  Temporary shrinkage 2010-2014  Between 2010 and 2013 the lake shrank significantly, and by September 2013 the lake was reduced to a mere puddle with less than 2% of its original surface size. The exact causes for the water loss are unknown. The suspects are drought conditions and the thawing of an assumed permafrost layer under the lake leading to increased seepage. However, after the particularly wet winter of 2013/2014, the lake was back to around 75% of its original size by May 2014, and subsequently returned to its normal size. Therefore, it is currently assumed that the primary reason for the water loss were the drought conditions on Mauna Kea from 2010 to 2013.Chelsea Jensen: Lake Waiau atop Mauna Kea nearly full or full since fall 2014 . Eest Hawaii Today, 2017-03-22  Mythology  The lake is of some importance in Hawaiian mythology. Aside from Poli ªahu, there are two additional snow deities, Lilinoe and Waiau, who are associated with Mauna Kea, and according to Westervelt, the lake was probably named after the goddess of the same, who used to bathe in it. Originally Hawaiians considered the whole peak region of Mauna Kea, including Lake Waiau, a sacred site, and only priests and chieftains were allowed to access it. Later, after the formation of the Hawaiian kingdom, the peak region was occasionally visited by members of the royal family. The last one to do so was Queen Emma in 1881, who also took a bath in the lake during her visit.

It belongs to the early dialogues, written while the author was still young. Its precise date is uncertain, although a date of c. 390 BC has been suggested; its authenticity has been doubted. In the Hippias Major, Socrates and Hippias set out to find a definition for \\"beauty\\", but are destined to fail due to their inability to formulate an answer which encompasses the entire concept. The actual Greek term that is used in the dialogue is Œ∫Œ±ŒªœåŒΩ, which as an adjective often means fine or noble as well as beautiful. For this reason, translators such as Paul Woodruff typically translate the term (œÑ·Ω∏ Œ∫Œ±ŒªœåŒΩ‚Äîthe abstract noun of the adjective) as \\"the Fine\\" (things) instead of \\"Beauty.\\" As in Charmides, Lysis and Euthyphro, Hippias Major has an \\"anatreptic\\" purpose, that is, the result of the dialogue is to defeat commonly held opinions, without necessarily offering a resolution. The concept of something good in and of itself (if only obliquely) makes its first appearance in this work. The dialogue can be read as much as a serious philosophical work as a light satirical comedy with two actors. The astuteness of Socrates in taking refuge under the authority of a supposed third protagonist in order to direct biting criticism at Hippias, endows the dialogue with humour. Personalities * Socrates. * Hippias of Elis: Hippias was a well known Sophist, originally from Elis. Known throughout Ancient Greece, he was reputed to have mastered mathematics, astronomy and rhetoric; he boasted that he could speak on any subject at Olympia without preparation. He is presented by Plato, perhaps somewhat caricatured, as vain, narrow, and of limited intellect; much as he is in Hippias Minor. Dialogue summary Hippias meets Socrates Hippias, whose business had kept him away from Athens for a long time, arrives in the city to give a lecture at Pheidostratus'sThis name occurs only in Hippias Major; no reference in Smith's Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology; the only other noted occurrence is as an Archon in 238 BC (see the list of eponymous archons); far too late to be contemporary. school in the next few days. He meets Socrates, and the latter asks him why such a precious and wise man as Hippias has deprived the Athenians of his presence for so long. It is, explains the great Sophist, because his native Elis was so in need of his services, and entrusted him with several important diplomatic missions to different cities; notably in Sparta. He made use of his travels throughout the Greek world to educate a large number of youth and earn large sums of money. One such example was the small town of Inycus, in Sicily, where the modest inhabitants sacrificed a good part of their savings to see their children educated. Could excessive application of the law lead to lawlessness? Socrates ironically assures him that this is all admirable. And if Hippias has spent such a large part of his time in Sparta, he asks, this must be where he earned the most? But Hippias demurs: he did not touch an obolus there. It was not because the Spartans did not wish the best possible education for their children, and not because they did not comprehend the true value of Hippias. The only reason was that \\"it is not the inherited usage of the Lacedaemonians to change their laws or to educate their children differently from what is customary.\\" However, Socrates emphasized, the law is precisely made for use and happiness of the citizens, two things to which Hippias would have been greatly able to contribute. By being too attached to the law and refusing the services of Hippias, the Spartans contradict the aim of their own laws and thus therefore could be considered as being unlawful. Hippias agrees. Socrates then asks him then how he nevertheless had so much success in this severe city of Laconia. It is not, Hippias answers, for his knowledge of arithmetic or astronomy, but rather \\"They are very fond of hearing about the genealogies of heroes and men, Socrates, and the foundations of cities in ancient times and, in short, about antiquity in general...[these being] beautiful pursuits\\". Socrates reveals his problem Socrates is happy that Hippias came to reminisce on beautiful things, because this is a subject that interests Socrates greatly and with good reason. Recently, according to the latter, while criticising the beauty or ugliness of part of speeches, he claims to have been harassed by an acquaintance, who reproached him for not really knowing the definition of beauty. Thus embarrassed by this exposure, Socrates claims to be delighted that finally one as competent as Hippias will be able to provide his opinion on the nature of beauty. The great Sophist, flattered, does not object; and is goaded on by Socrates, who offers to reprise the discussion, playing the part of the harasser. This role-play on the part of Socrates adds to the comic nature of dialogue. Hippias' three definitions First definition: beauty is a pretty girl Hippias first response is: \\"For be assured, Socrates, if I must speak the truth, a beautiful maiden is beautiful \\". Socrates estimates this to be, with his usual irony, a brilliant answer. But cannot they say that a lyre, a horse or even a pot is beautiful? The most beautiful of pots of course would not stand up to comparison with a beautiful girl, but then in turn what is the beauty of a girl in comparison to that of a goddess? In short, there is an infinite number of beautiful things besides beautiful girls. In any case, this is not really the question; it is not a question of knowing what is beautiful and what is not, but rather to define beauty and to say what makes beautiful things \\"beautiful\\". Second definition: beauty is gold The second response offered by Hippias is: \\"This that you ask about, the beautiful, is nothing else but gold... For we all know, I fancy, that wherever this is added, even what before appears ugly will appear beautiful when adorned with gold.\\"No doubt, replies Socrates, but what to make then of the great statue of Athena at the Parthenon? This masterpiece of Phidias is mostly made of ivory and precious stones, and not of gold. Yet the statue is magnificent. Besides, gold or any other precious metal only gives rise to beauty if it is properly used. In the case of the pot, for instance, who is to say whether a wooden spoon or a golden spoon would be better to stir with, or which would be more beautiful? Third definition: beauty is to be rich and respected This time Hippias thinks that he understands: Socrates wants to know what no man will ever find ugly: \\"I say, then, that for every man and everywhere it is most beautiful to be rich and healthy, and honoured by the Greeks, to reach old age, and, after providing a beautiful funeral for his deceased parents, to be beautifully and splendidly buried by his own offspring.\\" A scene follows, where Socrates shows his fear of the beating with a stick he would receive from his harasser if he had given that answer. What then of Achilles or Heracles? Was it beautiful for these two heroes, sons of the immortals, to be buried before their parents, before the gods? Was there no beauty in their lives because they were not buried by their offspring? Beauty in this sense then applies to ordinary men, but it would be ugliness for heroes. The definition is thus incorrect. Socrates' four definitions First definition: beauty is that which is appropriate Tiring of the errors of Hippias, Socrates offers a definition in his turn, which he holds came from his famous harasser: the beautiful is simply that which is appropriate. This response pleases Hippias. But further examination is needed: first of all, is it the appropriateness which makes things beautiful, or does it simply make them appear to be beautiful? The second hypothesis is tempting: even a ridiculous man, dressed in nice clothing, will appear more beautiful. But inside he would still be ridiculous; thus appropriate and beautiful are not the same. Hippias suggests that appropriateness provides at the same time the reality and the appearance of beauty. But then, nothing could be less sure; if everything was that simple, citizens and politicians would no longer have to quarrel to decide which action was the nicer. Second definition: beauty is that which is useful Socrates proposes a second solution: if it is beautiful, is it useful? But here again problems surface: it is through power that men make things useful. Nevertheless, as is well known, power can as much serve evil as it serves good. And there is difficulty in qualifying actions as bad or good. Which in turn requires that the definition be refocused; beauty is only usefulness applied to good ends, or those that are \\"favourable\\". Third definition: beauty is that which is favourable Identifying the beautiful and the favourable leads to a paradox: the favourable procreates the beautiful, as a father procreates a son. Since the favourable and the beautiful are thus considered to be one and the same, they arrive at the finding that beauty is the reason of goodness. In logic, a cause and an effect are two different things, as a father is different from the son. And thus they must conclude that Beauty is not good, and good is not beauty; an assertion which pleases neither Socrates nor Hippias. Fourth definition: beauty is the pleasure that comes from seeing and hearing To conclude, Socrates brings out a final definition; at first glance quite amazing: \\"[what] if we were to say that that is beautiful which makes us feel joy ; I do not mean all pleasures, but that which makes us feel joy through hearing and sight?\\" This hypothesis, while appealing, contains according to Socrates himself a fundamental flaw; that it ignores the beauty of the more noble pleasures, drawn from the studious occupations or the study of laws. On the other hand, it seems striking that only the senses of sight and hearing are taken into account. Is this a way to submit to common opinion, which is that touch, taste and smell are somehow more shameful and base than the other senses? Finally, it is not simply because pleasure comes from seeing or hearing that it is beautiful. Socrates throws himself into a series of considerations: taking into account pairs of objects, in the Majority of cases the term which they apply to both objects (A and B are beautiful, A and B are just) can apply also to an object taken separately (A is beautiful and B is beautiful). But in some rare cases it can happen that it this is not the case, notably when the sum of A and B forms an even number and A and B, taken in isolation, are two odd numbers. In the case of beauty, it is the first category that is appropriate, because if a pair of two objects is beautiful, it stands to reason that each of them is. But a new paradox appears, since the beautiful, in discreet definition, must belong to both pleasures of sight and hearing, taken jointly, and cannot belong to only one of them. The definition as a result proves to be flawed. Exhausted by the many questions they have considered, Hippias berates Socrates and urges him instead of \\"with mere talk and nonsense\\" to seek beauty in \\"the ability to produce a discourse well and beautifully in a court of law or a council-house or before any other public body before which the discourse may be delivered.\\" Socrates, taking his leave, pretends to feel bad about the situation, cornered between the attacks of Hippias and those of his mysterious opponent. His only certainty, he concludes with a sense of humour, is that from now on he better understands the Greek proverb \\"beautiful things are difficult\\" Authenticity The authorship of Hippias Major has been disputed. Although some works previously attributed to Plato have been determined to be inauthentic, this is one where authorship has still not been firmly established, though academic consensus tends toward its authenticity. The argument is summarized in (Sider 1977): \\"Dorothy Tarrant is the foremost advocate for the cause of spuriousness: cf. her edition of The Hippias Major Attributed to Plato (Cambridge, 1928). Opposing her in a series of articles is G.M.A. Grube, who wrote in 1926 and 1927. W. K. C. Guthrie, in A History of Greek Philosophy (Cambridge 1975) also argues for its genuineness.\\"Sider, David. Plato's Early Aesthetics: 'The Hippias Major'. Journal of Aesthetics & Art Criticism; June 1977, Vol. 35 Issue 4, page 465, paragraph 6. Sider, writing in 1992 states that G. R. Ledger, in Re-counting Plato (Oxford 1989) carried out a computer text analysis and though not conclusive \\"On balance the evidence for genuineness is fairly convincing\\". He goes on to state that amongst other recent works, P. Woodruff, Plato: Hippias Major (Oxford 1982) also argues for authenticity and dates the document to \\"around 390\\" BC. C. H. Kahn, \\"The Beautiful and the Genuine,\\" OSAP 3 (1985:261‚Äì87) is the lone modern figure maintaining spuriousness.David Sider, Fordham University, reviewing Ivor Ludlam, Hippias Major: An Interpretation. in the Bryn Mawr Classical Review 3.5.11; accessed 29 June 2006Paul A. Vander Waerdt (ed.), The Socratic Movement, Cornell University Press, 1994, p. 109. The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy states \\"Of those [of Plato's works] we listed as authentic, above (in the early group), only the Hippias Major continues occasionally to be listed as inauthentic.

It was built in 1872 like an Italian chateau on neoclassical lines, at a time when modernism had set in. It belonged to the Nawabs of Bahawalpur princely state, during British Raj.The Bahawalpur.com - Noor Mahal History thumb There are various stories regarding its construction. According to one legend, Nawab Adnan Abbasi IV had the palace made for his wife; however, she was only there for one night, as she happened to see the adjoining graveyard from her balcony, and refused to spend another night there, and so it remained unused during his reign.History of Noor Mahal Bahawalpur - daaira.com Noor Mehal is one of the hidden gems of Bahawalpur, due to the lack of publicity. The palace is open to public. It is currently in the possession of the Pakistan Army and is used as a state guest house for holding state durbars and meetings with foreign delegations. Architecture Interior of the Noor Mahal Mr. Heennan, an Englishman who was the state engineer, designed the building. The foundation of Noor Palace was laid in 1872. A map and coins of the state were buried in its foundation as a good omen. Most of the palace's materials and furniture were imported from England and Italy. The construction of the palace was completed in 1875 at a cost of Rs. 1.2 million. Considering the amount of silver in the Indian Rupee Coin at 11.66 Grams in 1862, this amount in 2016 would come to about 8.1 million US dollars. Noor Palace covers an area of . It has 32 rooms including 14 in the basement, 6 verandas and 5 domes.Noor Mahal - History The design encompasses features of Corinthian and Islamic styles of architecture with a tinge of subcontinental style. The Corinthian touch is visible in the columns, balustrade, pediments and the vaulted ceiling of Durbar Hall. The Islamic style is evident in the five domes, whereas the angular elliptical shapes are a stroke of subcontinent style. Nawab Muhammad Bahawal Khan the fifth added a mosque to the palace in 1906 at the cost of Rs. 20,000. The design is based on the mosque of Aitchison College. In 1956, when Bahawalpur State was merged into Pakistan, the building was taken over by the Auqaf department. The palace was leased to the army in 1971; in 1997 the army purchased it for the sum of 119 million. The building was declared a ‚Äúprotected monument‚Äù in September 2001 by the Government of Pakistan's Department of Archeology, and it is now open for general visitors, students trips and other interested persons. Things to see There are a lot of old things present in it. It includes many Nawabs' used things. There are many old swords, old currency notes and coins, old laws that were made in that time, an old piano that Nawabs used to play, old furniture used by Nawabs etc. There is also a long wall in it that contains imaginary pictures of Nawabs. Only one picture is real, all others are imaginary. There is also a prison cell aside the Mahal.

The western part of the town is called Sil-Sako because it still contains a small stone-built bridge over a stream. The eastern part is known as Raja-duar (king's gate), which shows that the Raja's palace was there. The second copper-plate of Dharma Pala was found in the village of Rangmahal about two miles to the north of Raja-duar. This is another indication that the capital was then at North-Guwahati.

William T. Sherman's army had steadily advanced towards Atlanta in the spring and summer of 1864, fighting a series of battles against the Confederate Army of Joseph E. Johnston. Sherman continually flanked the Confederate positions and slipped ever closer to his goal. Howard's IV Corps pursued the retreating Confederates along the Western & Atlantic Railroad, with General Thomas J. Wood's division in the lead. They encountered very little resistance until the head of column reached Vining's Station. From that point, a road led to the east toward Atlanta, crossing the Chattahoochee River at Pace's Ferry, where the Confederates had constructed a pontoon bridge over the deep and swift flowing river. Wood's skirmishers encountered a brigade of dismounted cavalry, which had its front covered by rail barricades along a ridge at right angles to the road, a quarter mile from the railroad station. Wood quickly drove the Confederates from these barricades and pushed on to the river. Despite Confederate efforts to destroy the bridge to prevent it from falling into enemy hands, Wood's men arrived in time to save the greater part of the bridge. Confederate attempts to burn the structure had failed, and mooring ropes had been cut on the Confederate side so that the pontoon bridge drifted in the river.OR, Series I, Vol. XXXVIII, Part 1, p. 200, Maj.

It covers the lives of the five children in their native state and develops with their rescue by a wealthy gentleman who takes an interest in the family. Series overview The Five Little Peppers and How They Grew tells how the Peppers live, learn, and play in their little brown house. They are poor, and Mamsie must work constantly to keep the wolf from the door, but their lives are unexpectedly happy. When the youngest, Phronsie, is kidnapped by an organ grinder, she is rescued by young Jasper King and his dog Prince, both of whom soon become fast friends with the Peppers. The family so charms Jasper and his father that one by one they are invited to visit the Kings' home in the city and soon the entire family is living there. Mr. King makes Mrs. Pepper his housekeeper and does everything in his power to entertain and educate the children. Though the Kings surround the Pepper children with luxuryin 5 years Phronsie collects 200 dollsthe values of hard work, humility, and togetherness are still firmly enforced by their mother. This puts them in a curious position in society. Though they live with an upper- class father and son, the older children are aware they‚Äôll someday work for their livings. This makes them willing to befriend anyone, from street girls to grocers‚Äô sons. The stories continue with the Peppers' adventures in school, abroad, and even back in the little brown house where their thoughts and hearts will always turn. The series spans 17 years, beginning with Phronsie as a three-year-old and finishing with her as a 20-year-old young lady. Characters Mrs. Pepper (Later Mrs. Fisher): Called \\"Mamsie\\" by her children, Mrs. Pepper is a widow struggling to keep her five children healthy and educated. She is the family's moral backbone and her children are completely devoted to her. She eventually weds Dr. Adoniram Fisher with her brood's full approval. Ben (Ebenezer): The eldest of the five. Ben is an avid scholar but willingly puts aside schooling in favor of providing for the family. With his sister he manages the younger children and will sacrifice anything for them. He is eleven at the start of ‚ÄúThe Five Little Peppers and How They Grew.‚Äù Polly (Mary) The elder Pepper girl, aged 10 at the start of ‚ÄúThe Five Little Peppers and How They Grew.‚Äù Polly is a busy, bright, cheerful girl who makes the family's life as happy as possible. She loves music, flowers, and her baby sister with equal passion. Joel: The middle Pepper, the middle boy, the most active. He is 8 in ‚ÄúThe Five Little Peppers and How They Grew.‚Äù Joel is an enthusiastic sportsman who loves treats, parties, and entertainment. He is the most troublesome, often getting himself into mischief or causing the others grief with the things he says. He settles down somewhat in college and becomes active in a student church group. Davie (David): The youngest boy and the quietest sibling. Davie allows the world to go on around him as he calmly absorbs the family's doings. An obedient student, he's equally willing to give up anything to make Joel or Ben happy. Somewhat of a dandy in late adolescence, he is teasingly nicknamed \\"Davina\\" by other students. Phronsie (Sophronia): The baby and pet of the family. The series opens with Phronsie as a wide-eyed blonde three-year-old who sees the good in nearly everyone and is anxious to aid anyone in need. She calls her dolls, Baby and Seraphina, her children and treats them as such. She is especially devoted to Polly and Mr. King. Mr. J. Horatio King, Senior: The Pepper family‚Äôs benefactor. He is an older widower and in uncertain health at the beginning of the series. Bringing the Peppers into his household revitalizes him. Though quick of temper and firm of opinion, \\"Grandpapa\\" is a family man who seeks to ease every pain and concern in the lives of his children and the Peppers. Jasper (Jasper, Junior, called \\"Jappy\\"): Mr. King‚Äôs son. Jasper is an eager boy who is just as willing to go sledding with Ben as to bake pies with Polly. Jasper and his dog Prince befriend the Peppers when he rescues Phronsie from an organ grinder, and his affection for them ultimately leads him to request their company permanently in the household by marrying Polly. The Whitneys: Marian King Whitney, Mr. King‚Äôs adult daughter, and her boys Percy, Van, and Dick Whitney make up the rest of the King household. Mr. Whitney ultimately turns out to be Mrs. Pepper‚Äôs cousin, making the Peppers distant relatives of the family. Mrs. Whitney is a second mother to the Pepper children. The three boys, while infatuated with Polly, are frequently at odds both with one another and with Joel.

Letters from readers around the world prompted her to continue writing about the Peppers, which she did for another nineteen years. All of the later books take place much before the third book in the original series. In chronological order, rather than by publication date, the six key books would be read approximately in this sequence: * Five Little Peppers and How They Grew * Five Little Peppers Midway * Five Little Peppers Abroad * Five Little Peppers and Their Friends * Five Little Peppers Grown Up * Five Little Peppers: Phronsie Pepper The other six books are \\"background\\" and are set about the time of the first three books listed above chronologically. Since they were written many years later, some situations in them are at variance with those same situations as described in the earlier written books. Adaptations The Pepper books were the inspiration for a brief series of feature films produced by Columbia Pictures in 1939 and 1940. The four films were vehicles for Columbia's juvenile star Edith Fellows, who played Polly. The rest of the children were Charles Peck as Ben, Tommy Bond of Our Gang as Joey, Robert Boyce \\"Bobby\\" Larson as Davie, and Dorothy Ann Seese as Phronsie. The first film was devoted mostly to Fellows as the senior member of the Pepper brood, and was not an exact reflection of the book. The other three films were homespun family stories with elements of comedy and drama. Edith Fellows carried the series, although by the time it lapsed, five-year- old Dorothy Ann Seese had become an audience favorite and was billed at the head of the cast, second only to Fellows. The Pepper screenplays had little to do with the original books, but the four films were popular with moviegoers. The films remained in circulation for many years, and were frequently scheduled for children's film festivals and weekend matinees. * Five Little Peppers and How They Grew (1939) * Five Little Peppers at Home (1940) the kids trapped in a mine * Out West with the Peppers (1940) the kids at a lumber camp * Five Little Peppers in Trouble (1940) the kids at a snobbish school The Pepper books are referenced in the TV series Fargo Season 2, Episode 1.

Gold rushes Edward Hargraves made the discovery of gold in Bathurst in 1851 The discovery of gold, beginning in 1851 first at Bathurst in New South Wales and then in the newly formed colony of Victoria, transformed Australia economically, politically and demographically. The gold rushes occurred hard on the heels of a major worldwide economic depression. As a result, about two per cent of the population of Britain and Ireland immigrated to NSW and Victoria during the 1850s. There were also large numbers of continental Europeans, North Americans and Chinese. The rushes began in 1851 with the announcement of the discovery of payable gold near Bathurst by Edward Hargraves. In that year New South Wales had about 200,000 people, a third of them within a day's ride of Sydney, the rest scattered along the coast and through the pastoral districts, from the Port Phillip District in the south to Moreton Bay in the north. In 1836 a new colony of South Australia had been established, and its territory separated from New South Wales. The gold rushes of the 1850s brought a huge influx of settlers, although initially the majority of them went to the richest gold fields at Ballarat and Bendigo, in the Port Phillip District, which in 1851 was separated to become the colony of Victoria. Victoria soon had a larger population than New South Wales, and its upstart capital, Melbourne, outgrew Sydney. But the New South Wales gold fields also attracted a flood of prospectors, and by 1857 the colony had more than 300,000 people. Inland towns like Bathurst, Goulburn, Orange and Young flourished. Gold brought great wealth but also new social tensions. Multiethnic migrants came to New South Wales in large numbers for the first time. Young became the site of an infamous anti-Chinese miner riot in 1861 and the official Riot Act was read to the miners on 14 July‚Äîthe only official reading in the history of New South Wales. Despite some tension, the influx of migrants also brought fresh ideas from Europe and North America to New South Wales‚ÄîNorwegians introduced skiing in Australia to the hills above the Snowy Mountains gold rush town of Kiandra around 1861. A famous Australian son was also born to a Norwegian miner in 1867, when the bush balladeer Henry Lawson was born at the Grenfell goldfields. In 1858 a new gold rush began in the far north, which led in 1859 to the separation of Queensland as a new colony. New South Wales thus attained its present borders, although what is now the Northern Territory remained part of the colony until 1863, when it was handed over to South Australia. The separation and rapid growth of Victoria and Queensland mark the real beginning of New South Wales as a political and economic entity distinct from the other Australian colonies. Rivalry between New South Wales and Victoria was intense throughout the second half of the 19th century, and the two colonies developed in different directions. Once the easy gold ran out by about 1860, Victoria absorbed the surplus labour force from the gold fields in manufacturing, protected by high tariff walls. Victoria became the Australian stronghold of protectionism, liberalism and radicalism. New South Wales, which was less radically affected demographically by the gold rushes, remained more conservative, still dominated politically by the squatter class and its allies in the Sydney business community. New South Wales, as a trading and exporting colony, remained wedded to free trade. Swearing Allegiance to the Southern Cross on 1 December 1854‚Äîwatercolour by Charles Doudiet Eureka Stockade leader Peter Lalor in later life as Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Victoria Gold produced sudden wealth for a few, and some of Australia's oldest wealthy families date their fortunes from this period, but also employment and modest prosperity for many more. Within a few years these new settlers outnumbered the convicts and ex-convicts, and they began to demand trial by jury, representative government, a free press and the other symbols of liberty and democracy. Contrary to popular myth, there was little opposition to these demands from the colonial governors or the Colonial Office in London, although there was some from the squatters. New South Wales had already had a partly elected Legislative Council since 1825. Spencer Street tram, 1889.jpg The Eureka Stockade of 1854, an armed protest by miners on the Victorian goldfields, and the debate that followed, served as a significant impetus for democratising reforms. The rebellion came about as a result of opposition to government mining licences. Licence fees had to be paid regardless of whether a digger's claim resulted in any gold and less successful operators found it difficult to pay their licence fees. Official corruption was another concern. In November 1854, thousands of diggers rallied to call for the abolition of the licence fee and the vote for all males. A Reform League was formed, with some of its leaders linked to the Chartist movement in England. On 30 November, a mass burning of licenses took place and protesters marched to the Eureka Diggings and constructed a stockade. Led by Peter Lalor, 500 men swore an oath under a flag featuring the Southern Cross and prepared to defend the stockade. On 3 December, the colonial troops attacked the stockade and a twenty-minute battle ensued in which 22 diggers and 5 soldiers were killed. Thirteen diggers committed for trial were all acquitted and the following year the government granted the demands of the rebels. In the subsequent 1855 elections, Peter Lalor became the first Member of the Legislative Council for the seat of Ballarat. In 1855 New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania (as Van Diemen's Land was renamed) were granted full responsible government, with bicameral parliaments in which the lower houses were fully elected. The upper houses (Legislative Councils) remained dominated by government appointees and representatives of the squatters, worried that the radical democrats might try to seize their vast sheep-runs. Their fears were partly justified, with the Selection Acts of the 1860s, in particular the Robertson Land Acts of 1861, beginning the slow breakup of the squattocracy in Australia's more settled areas. The arrival of Old World diseases were a catastrophe for the Aboriginal Australians. Between first European contact and the early years of the 20th century, the Aboriginal population dropped from an estimated 500,000 to about one tenth of that number (50,000). Smallpox, measles and influenza were major killers, many others added their toll; for a people without the thousands of years of genetically evolved resistance to diseases that Europeans had, even chickenpox was deadly. The Bushrangers William Strutt's Bushrangers in the St Kilda Road (1887), scene of frequent hold-ups during the Victorian gold rush by bushrangers known as the St Kilda Road robberiesNed Kelly's armour on display in the State Library of Victoria Bushrangers, originally referred to runaway convicts in the early years of the British settlement of Australia who had the survival skills necessary to use the Australian bush as a refuge to hide from the authorities. The term \\"bushranger\\" then evolved to refer to those who abandoned social rights and privileges to take up \\"robbery under arms\\" as a way of life, using the bush as their base. These bushrangers were roughly analogous to British \\"highwaymen\\" and American \\"Old West outlaws,\\" and their crimes often included robbing small-town banks or coach services. More than 3,000 bushrangers are believed to have roamed the Australian countryside, beginning with the convict bolters and drawing to a close after Ned Kelly's last stand at Glenrowan. Bold Jack Donahue is recorded as the last convict bushranger. He was reported in newspapers around 1827 as being responsible for an outbreak of bushranging on the road between Sydney and Windsor. Throughout the 1830s he was regarded as the most notorious bushranger in the colony. Leading a band of escaped convicts, Donahue became central to Australian folklore as the Wild Colonial Boy. Bushranging was common on the mainland, but Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania) produced the most violent and serious outbreaks of convict bushrangers. Hundreds of convicts were at large in the bush, farms were abandoned and martial law was proclaimed. Indigenous outlaw Musquito defied colonial law and led attacks on settlers The bushrangers' heyday was the Gold Rush years of the 1850s and 1860s. There was much bushranging activity in the Lachlan Valley, around Forbes, Yass and Cowra in News South Wales. Frank Gardiner, John Gilbert and Ben Hall led the most notorious gangs of the period. Other active bushrangers included Dan Morgan, based in the Murray River, and Captain Thunderbolt, killed outside Uralla. The increasing push of settlement, increased police efficiency, improvements in rail transport and communications technology, such as telegraphy, made it increasingly difficult for bushrangers to evade capture. Among the last bushrangers was the Kelly Gang led by Ned Kelly, who were captured at Glenrowan in 1880, two years after they were outlawed. Kelly was born in Victoria to an Irish convict father, and as a young man he clashed with the Victoria Police. Following an incident at his home in 1878, police parties searched for him in the bush. After he killed three policemen, the colony proclaimed Kelly and his gang wanted outlaws. A final violent confrontation with police took place at Glenrowan on 28 June 1880. Kelly, dressed in home- made plate metal armour and helmet, was captured and sent to jail. He was hanged for murder at Old Melbourne Gaol in November 1880. His daring and notoriety made him an iconic figure in Australian history, folklore, literature, art and film. Some bushrangers, most notably Ned Kelly in his Jerilderie Letter, and in his final raid on Glenrowan, explicitly represented themselves as political rebels. Attitudes to Kelly, by far the most well-known bushranger, exemplify the ambivalent views of Aussie regarding bushrangers. Exploration of the interior John Longstaff, Arrival of Burke, Wills and King at the deserted camp at Cooper's Creek, Sunday evening, 21st April 1861, oil on canvas, 1907, National Gallery of Victoria European explorers made their last great, often arduous and sometimes tragic expeditions into the interior of Australia over the period‚Äîsome with the official sponsorship of the colonial authorities and others commissioned by private investors. By 1850, large areas of the inland were still unknown to Europeans. Trailblazers like Edmund Kennedy and the Prussian naturalist Ludwig Leichhardt, had met tragic ends attempting to fill in the gaps during the 1840s, but explorers remained ambitious to discover new lands for agriculture or answer scientific enquiries. Surveyors also acted as explorers and the colonies sent out expeditions to discover the best routes for lines of communication. The size of expeditions varied considerably from small parties of just two or three to large, well equipped teams led by gentlemen explorers assisted by smiths, carpenters, labourers and Aboriginal guides accompanied by horses, camels or bullocks. In 1860, the ill-fated Burke and Wills led the first north-south crossing of the continent from Melbourne to the Gulf of Carpentaria. Lacking bushcraft and unwilling to learn from the local Aboriginal people, Burke and Wills died in 1861, having returned from the Gulf to their rendez-vous point at Coopers Creek only to discover the rest of their party had departed the location only a matter of hours previously. Though an impressive feat of navigation, the expedition was an organisational disaster which continues to fascinate the Australian public. In 1862, John McDouall Stuart succeeded in traversing Central Australia from south to north. His expedition mapped out the route which was later followed by the Australian Overland Telegraph Line.Tim Flannery; The Explorers; Text Publishing 1998 Uluru and Kata Tjuta were first mapped by Europeans in 1872 during the expeditionary period made possible by the construction of the Australian Overland Telegraph Line. In separate expeditions, Ernest Giles and William Gosse were the first European explorers to this area. While exploring the area in 1872, Giles sighted Kata Tjuta from a location near Kings Canyon and called it Mount Olga, while the following year Gosse observed Uluru and named it Ayers Rock, in honor of the Chief Secretary of South Australia, Sir Henry Ayers. These barren desert lands of Central Australia disappointed the Europeans as unpromising for pastoral expansion, but would later come to be appreciated as emblematic of Australia. Impact on indigenous population Aboriginal Farmers at Parker's Protectorate, Mt Franklin, Victoria in 1858. Aboriginal people who lost control of their lands were generally pushed into reserves or missions. The steady encroachment of European explorers and pastoralists into the lands of the Aborigines met with a variety of responses, from friendly or curious to fearful or violent reactions. Very often, early European exploratory expeditions only succeeded by means of the assistance rendered by Aboriginal guides or negotiators or by advice from tribes encountered along the expeditionary route. Nevertheless, the arrival of Europeans profoundly disrupted Aboriginal society. According to the historian Geoffrey Blainey, in Australia during the colonial period: \\"In a thousand isolated places there were occasional shootings and spearings. Even worse, smallpox, measles, influenza and other new diseases swept from one Aboriginal camp to another ... The main conqueror of Aborigines was to be disease and its ally, demoralisation\\".Geoffrey Blainey; A Very Short History of the World; Penguin Books; 2004; Pastoralists often established themselves beyond the frontiers of European settlement and competition for water and land between indigenous people and cattlemen was a source of potential conflict‚Äîespecially in the arid interior. In later decades Aboriginal men began working as skilled stockmen on outback cattle stations. Christian missionaries sought to convert Aboriginal people. Prominent Aboriginal activist Noel Pearson (born 1965), who was raised at a Lutheran mission in Cape York, has written that Christian missions throughout Australia's colonial history \\"provided a haven from the hell of life on the Australian frontier while at the same time facilitating colonisation\\". Some Anthropological work was also conducted among the Aborigines during the period. A pioneering and landmark work on indigenous Australia was conducted by Walter Baldwin Spencer and Frank Gillen in their renowned anthropological study The Native Tribes of Central Australia in (1899) earned international renown and provides a valuable 19th-century study of an indigenous Australian society. Around this time, Aboriginal welfare advocate and anthropologist Daisy Bates commenced her work among the Aborigines after reading an allegation in The Times about atrocities against Aboriginals in north-west Australia. Bates came to fear that the Aboriginal race was destined for extinction. Once Europeans had gained control of Aboriginal territory, the local Aborigines who had not been affected by disease or conflict were generally pushed into reserves or missions. Others settled on the fringes of white settlement or worked as station hands for white farmers. Some either intermarried or bore children with Europeans. European diet, disease and alcohol adversely affected many Aboriginal people. A relative few remained living traditional lives un-affected by Europeans at the close of the 19th century‚Äîmainly in the far North and in the Centralian deserts. Booms, depressions and trade unions Shearing the Rams (1888‚Äì1890) by Tom Roberts The rapid economic expansion which followed the gold rushes produced a period of prosperity which lasted forty years, culminating in the great Land Boom of the 1880s. Melbourne, in particular, grew rapidly, and briefly became Australia's largest city and for a while the second-largest city in the British Empire, before being overtaken by a population boom in Sydney in the early 1900s: the grand Victorian buildings of both cities are a lasting reminder of the period. The traditional craft of Stonemasons in Melbourne were the first organised workers in the Australian labour movement and in the world to win an eight-hour day in 1856. Melbourne Trades Hall was opened in 1859 with Trades and Labour Councils and Trades Halls opening in all cities and most regional towns in the following forty years. During the 1880s trade unions developed among shearers, miners, and stevedores (wharf workers), but soon spread to cover almost all blue-collar jobs. Shortages of labour led to high wages for a prosperous skilled working class, whose unions demanded and got an eight-hour day and other benefits unheard of in Europe. Eight-hour day march, , outside Parliament House in Spring Street, Melbourne Australia gained a reputation as \\"the working man's paradise.\\" Some employers tried to undercut the unions by importing Chinese labour. This produced a reaction which led to all the colonies restricting Chinese and other Asian immigration. This was the foundation of the White Australia Policy. The \\"Australian compact\\", based around centralised industrial arbitration, a degree of government assistance particularly for primary industries, and White Australia, was to continue for many years before gradually dissolving in the second half of the 20th century. The Great Boom could not last forever, and in 1891 it gave way to the Great Crash, a decade-long depression which created high unemployment, and ruined many businesses, and the employers responded by driving down wages. The unions responded with a series of strikes, particularly the bitter and prolonged 1890 Australian maritime dispute and the 1891 and 1894 shearers' strikes. The colonial ministries, made up for the most part of liberals whom the unions had long seen as allies, turned sharply against the workers and there were a series of bloody confrontations, particularly in the pastoral areas of Queensland. The unions reacted to these defeats and what they saw as betrayals by liberal politicians by forming their own political parties within their respective colonies, the forerunners of the Australian Labor Party. These parties achieved rapid success: in 1899 Queensland saw the world's first Labor Party parliamentary government, the Dawson Government, which held office for six days. The industrial struggles of the 1890s produced a new strain of Australian radicalism and nationalism, exemplified in the Sydney-based magazine The Bulletin, under its legendary editor J. F. Archibald. Writers such as A B \\"Banjo\\" Paterson, Henry Lawson and (a little later) Vance and Nettie Palmer and Mary Gilmour promoted socialism, republicanism and Australian independence. This newfound Australian consciousness also gave birth to a profound racism, against Chinese, Japanese and Indian immigrants. Attitudes towards indigenous Australians during the period varied from the outright armed hostility seen in earlier times to a paternalistic \\"smoothing the pillow\\" policy, designed to \\"civilise\\" the last remnants of what was considered a dying race. Development of Australian democracy South Australian suffragist Catherine Helen Spence (1825‚Äì1910). In 1895 women in South Australia were among the first in the world to attain the vote and were the first to be able to stand for parliament. By the mid 19th century, there was a strong desire for representative and responsible government in the colonies of Australia, fed by the democratic spirit of the goldfields evident at the Eureka Stockade and the ideas of the great reform movements sweeping Europe, the United States and the British Empire. The end of convict transportation accelerated reform in the 1840s and 1850s. The Australian Colonies Government Act [1850] was a landmark development which granted representative constitutions to New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania and the colonies enthusiastically set about writing constitutions which produced democratically progressive parliaments‚Äîthough the constitutions generally maintained the role of the colonial upper houses as representative of social and economic \\"interests\\" and all established Constitutional Monarchies with the British monarch as the symbolic head of state. In 1855, limited self-government was granted by London to New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. An innovative secret ballot was introduced in Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia in 1856, in which the government supplied voting paper containing the names of candidates and voters could select in private. This system was adopted around the world, becoming known as the \\"Australian Ballot\\". 1855 also saw the granting of the right to vote to all male British subjects 21 years or over in South Australia. This right was extended to Victoria in 1857 and New South Wales the following year. The other colonies followed until, in 1896, Tasmania became the last colony to grant universal male suffrage. Propertied women in the colony of South Australia were granted the vote in local elections (but not parliamentary elections) in 1861. Henrietta Dugdale formed the first Australian women's suffrage society in Melbourne, Victoria in 1884. Women became eligible to vote for the Parliament of South Australia in 1895. This was the first legislation in the world permitting women also to stand for election to political office and, in 1897, Catherine Helen Spence became the first female political candidate for political office, unsuccessfully standing for election as a delegate to the Federal Convention on Australian Federation. Western Australia granted voting rights to women in 1899. Legally, Indigenous Australian males generally gained the right to vote during this period when Victoria, New South Wales, Tasmania and South Australia gave voting rights to all male British subjects over 21‚Äîonly Queensland and Western Australia barred Aboriginal people from voting. Thus, Aboriginal men and women voted in some jurisdictions for the first Commonwealth Parliament in 1901. Early federal parliamentary reform and judicial interpretation, however, sought to limit Aboriginal voting in practice‚Äîa situation which endured until rights activists began campaigning in the 1940s. Though the various parliaments of Australia have been constantly evolving, the key foundations for elected parliamentary government have maintained an historical continuity in Australia from the 1850s into the 21st century. Push for federation Sir Henry Parkes (1815‚Äì1896), the 'Father of Federation' The 1890s depression (the most severe Australia had ever faced) made the inefficiencies of the six colonies seem ever more ridiculous, and, particularly in border areas, a push for an Australian Federation began. Other motives for Federation were the need for a common immigration policy (Queensland was busy importing indentured workers from New Caledonia, known as Kanakas, to work in the sugar industry: both the unions and the other colonies strongly opposed this), and fear of the other European powers, France and Germany, who were expanding into the region. British military leaders such as Horatio Kitchener urged Australia to create a national army and navy: this obviously required a federal government. It was also no coincidence that in the 1890s for the first time the majority of Australians, the children of the gold rush immigrants, were Australian-born. Amid calls from London for the establishment of an intercolonial Australian army, and with the various colonies independently constructing railway lines, New South Wales Premier Sir Henry Parkes addressed a rural audience in his 1889 Tenterfield Oration, stating that the time had come to form a national executive government:http://www.abc.net.au/rural/content/2007/s1847396.htm > Parkes' vision called for a convention of Parliamentary representatives from > the different colonies, to draft a constitution for the establishment of a > national parliament, with two houses to legislate on \\"all great subjects\\". > Though Parkes would not live to see it, each of these things would be > achieved within a decade. Like many in the Federation movement, Parkes was > an Imperial loyalist, and at a Federation Conference banquet in 1890, he > spoke of blood-kinship linking the colonies: > The commemoration of the Federation of Australia at the Sydney Town Hall in > 1900 Parkes was the initial leader of the federation movement, but the other > colonies tended to see it as a plot for New South Wales dominance, and an > initial attempt to approve a federal constitution in 1891 failed. In 1890, > representatives of the six colonies and New Zealand had met in Melbourne. > They passed a resolution calling for the union of the colonies and requested > that the colonial legislatures nominate representatives to attend a > convention to consider a federal constitution. The following year, the > month-long 1891 National Australasian Convention was held in Sydney.

The cast also includes superfan Forrest J. Ackerman in one of his many bit roles in science-fiction films. The film inspired the 1966 TV series The Time Tunnel, as well as the 1967 remake Journey to the Center of Time. The plot involves a group of scientists who find their time-viewing screen allows them to travel through time. American International Pictures released the film as a double feature with Atragon. Plot Scientists Dr. Erik von Steiner (Preston Foster), Dr. Steve Connors (Philip Carey), and Carol White (Merry Anders) are testing their time-viewing device, drawing enormous amounts of power. Danny McKee (Steve Franken), a technician from the power plant, has been sent to tell them to shut down their experiment. During the test, odd shadows quickly cross the room before the screen shows a stark, barren landscape. Danny discovers the screen has become a portal and steps through. As the setting is becoming unstable, the others enter the portal to bring him back. The portal disappears, stranding them. Then they are pursued by hostile primitives, ending up in a cave, where they find an underground city ‚Äì all that is left of civilization in a future devastated by nuclear war. The year is 2071 AD. City leader Dr. Varno (John Hoyt) explains that Earth is unable to support life. The residents are frantically working on a spacecraft that will take them to a planet orbiting Alpha Centauri. The four time travelers, told they may not join that space voyage, are allowed to work on recreating their time portal to return to their time. Before the colony residents can lift off, the degenerate mutant humans break in and destroy the ship and encroach on the city. Dr. Varno determines that now the only hope is the time portal, so he commits the city's remaining resources to help von Steiner, Connors, White, and McKee rebuild the time portal with future technology. As they feverishly work, the mutants are invading the colony; along with a few people from the future, the four travelers escape back to the present just ahead of the mutants. One person throws an object back through the portal that damages the equipment on the other side and shuts down the portal. The survivors return to the lab, where they make a strange discovery. Their past selves are still in the lab, yet to pass through the portal, but they appear frozen. Through some error, the travelers are experiencing time at an accelerated rate; the rest of the world, including their past selves, is moving in extremely slow motion. Their only option is to travel to the date the portal had briefly been set to before being set to 2071 AD, a date over 100,000 years in the future, but the screen is dark and what lies ahead is unknown. They quickly cross the room, casting their shadows. When the last one goes through, the screen flashes on briefly and shows the travelers walking in a clearing with trees and grass with the surface of the Earth habitable again and people able to build a future there. The film then shows their past selves moving at normal speed again, repeating the actions seen at the beginning of the film. The sequence of events of the entire movie is rapidly reshown, and repeats with ever briefer and fewer clips, leaving the viewer in a loop until it abruptly ends without further explanation.

His work, however, was notable in that later reviewers regarded the production as secondary. \\"In spite of the low budget, this still looks pretty good thanks to intelligent use of the resources available.

Retrieved: October 29, 2014. A number of well known magic tricks are used as special effects in The Time Travelers. Cameo At 44 minutes into the film, Forrest J Ackerman appears briefly in a scene depicting several technicians. Ackerman's only line in the film is, \\"Don't worry. I'm keeping our spacemen happy. Getting things squared away\\". The joke is that his character works on a device that turns a circular frame into a square frame. At the time, Ackerman was editing a science-fiction magazine titled Spacemen. The Time Travelers was heavily promoted in his magazine on the basis of Ackerman's cameo appearance in the film. Reception The Time Travelers was a B film, evident by its meagre production values, although both the plot and actors were singled out for mention by critics. Leonard Maltin considered the film \\"not bad with a downbeat ending, one of the first American films photographed by Vilmos Zsigmond\\".Maltin, Leonard. Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide 2009.

Since the title was a first-party game and came out very early in the system's life cycle, it was used as a showcase for the system at trade shows before its release. The game was considered the first survival horror release on the PlayStation 2 and generated some hype amongst critics, but Extermination only received mostly average reviews. Former members of the development team joined Access Games. There are significant differences between the European and North American versions of the game including a redesign of the main protagonist, and entirely rerecorded dialogue using different voice actors. Gameplay Extermination is a survival horror game, and as such players are encouraged to run whenever they can. This idea is reinforced by the fact that ammunition is limited for the main character's weapons (unlimited ammo refills are located in very few places), and most enemies, especially the larger or human descended types, typically take a lot of damage before being defeated. Another element of survival horror that holds true is that ammo for special weapons (such as the shotgun, flamethrower, grenade launcher, and the rocket launcher) is limited from the get-go. The game also features an Infection System. Along with a conventional health bar, there is also an \\"Infection Rate\\". Enemies in the game have the potential to both deal damage to Dennis' health and raise his Infection Rate. When the rate reaches 100%, Dennis becomes completely infected by the virus, and his maximum health is not only reduced to 60%, but also constantly depletes. Additionally, things that would usually not harm Dennis (i.e. infected puddles) or would only infect him now inflict damage. This can be fought against using a special machine called the MTS Bed, located in certain areas of the game, which cures the infection and restores his health to full, but this also requires an MTS vaccine, a limited item. If Dennis' health reaches zero when infected, he will mutate into a creature and die, the results of which are game over. In the beginning, Dennis is equipped with a Special Purpose Rifle, or \\"SPR-4\\" assault rifle, a weapon traditionally given to the armed forces in the game's setting. This weapon is highly customizable and can be fitted with gadgets such as a zoom scope, flashlight grip, radar, and parts which convert it to different types of weapons such as a flame thrower, shotgun, or rocket launcher. Dennis also has a Combat Knife and can do either a single strong slash or multiple weak slashes. Another unique factor in Extermination's gameplay is the \\"Battery Pack\\". Found near the beginning of the game, Dennis uses this rechargeable battery to activate various machinery, and execute functions common to most video games such as saving the game. The battery pack can be upgraded to hold more power by collecting cells found in various locations around the Fort. Plot Extermination takes place on December 24, 2005, at a top secret American research facility in Antarctica. The game focuses on U.S. Marine Corp's Force Recon member Sergeant Dennis Riley, as part of \\"Team Red Light\\". His squad receives a distress call from the aforementioned base named Fort Stewart. The distress call requests an immediate air strike on the base. Instead, Team Red Light is sent in via C-17 to investigate. En route, the plane malfunctions, scattering the team and crashing into the tundra. All are ordered to regroup at Ground Facility Building B. Dennis, with teammate Roger Grigman, arrive outside the fort. They enter the fort through the ventilation shaft. After discovering that it \\"looks like a battlefield,\\" they try to get the drawbridge lowered to proceed to Building B. After Dennis lowers the drawbridge, Roger comes under attack by Hydras (in the North American release, these enemies are referred to as, \\"Bugs,\\"). He becomes infected and rapidly mutates in front of Dennis. A mysterious woman in a contamination suit arrives and fires at Roger, seemingly killing him. She throws Dennis an extra magazine for his rifle, and an MTS vaccine, shouting: \\"Use it if you don't want to end up like your friend!\\" Thereafter, she orders him to tell his team to escape the fort. Dennis crosses the drawbridge and pursues the mysterious woman, who has initiated a lock-down protocol. Eventually, he gets the door open and finally meets the woman face-to-face without her mask. The woman is Cindy Chen, whom Dennis was concerned about when coming to Fort Stewart. She was the girlfriend of Dennis' fallen comrade, Andrew, whom he served with in Cambodia. She has not spoken to Dennis since she received the news during that tour of duty. Cindy tells Dennis that the Marines must leave the fort as soon as possible and to \\"tell your government that their dirty little secret has become a nightmare.\\" Dennis heads toward Building B and is stopped by a journalist named Travis Miller, who reveals in conversation that he has been undercover for five years, then gives Dennis his card. He finds the Water Filtration Plant on his way to Building B and meets Carl Morris, an overseer of the project that started the entire thing. He tells Dennis that \\"there's something strange about the water, though you can't tell by looking at it.\\" Before he can finish, Carl succumbs to his injuries. Dennis, confused, advances to Building B. Once there, Dennis encounters Major Mike Madigan, who briefs Dennis on the situation thus far. He says that the Pentagon's decision is to now destroy the facility. To that end, three detonators need to be activated. However, the detonators can only be activated manually. Madigan remarks that he has already dispatched a few members of the team, but they had trouble. The remainder of the team goes to the helicopter outside, where a mutated human is drinking from a water tower. After taking it down, the water inside the tower moves around as though alive, but just when it attacks, it freezes in place. Madigan sends Dennis off, alone, to activate the detonators. Inside Building B, a woman named Sonja Leone tells him that the area holding the detonators can be unlocked from Building B with metal tags. Upon arrival, Cindy tells Dennis to leave her alone. Dennis, knowing full well why she is so dismissive, is irritated and tells Cindy: \\"On that day Andrew sacrificed his life to save mine. Now I've sworn to protect yours, no matter what happens.\\" Dennis receives a distress call from a Team Red Light marine. Dennis picks up their trail only to find them dead. He acquires the metal tag, and heads to the Level 2 detonator center, which Cindy mentions as having little power and no lighting whatsoever. He has another run-in with Miller, who says that he has all the evidence and information that he needs, and is on his way out. Miller is not seen or heard from for the remainder of the game. Although, in journals scattered throughout the game, it is revealed that others escaped with Miller from Antarctica. Dennis comes across a wounded Marine, Gary. Giving Dennis a metal tag and later heading on to Building B, Dennis radioes the number to Cindy, and he recollects the earlier battle with the humanoid mutant on the water tower and how the water had frozen as it reached out. Cindy foreshadows this as a clue. Dennis continues to the Level 1 detonator center and uncovers documents revealing that this plague is really caused by a bacterium dubbed HO213, and grows rapidly on contact with water. He reads on about how further testing revealed a pivotal weakness; all traces of the bacteria strain are wiped out when the master strain is destroyed. Once the detonator is activated, Dennis radios Cindy who immediately informs him of Sonja's recent disappearance, later found dead. Dennis and Cindy deduce that the bacterium is susceptible to cold. The cold itself will not actually destroy it, rather preserve it in a state of cryogenic suspension. However, if the master strain (Origin) were to be destroyed, the strain would die out on its own. Cindy checks her computer and tells Dennis that the HO213 requires a certain temperature in order to be incubated. The infested water heading towards the coolant is where Major Madigan and his team is heading. Their goal was to sabotage the coolant reactor, letting H0213 freeze out to temporarily buy time. Dennis rushes to his team's aid. On the way, Dennis comes across an injured Filel (The game had the character's name spelled and pronounced Filel at first, and then it was changed to Felil mid-game), who dies from a gunshot wound, but not before telling Dennis that Madigan had shot him. Dennis climbs a small mountain and meets up with Madigan, who orders Dennis to retrieve an explosive device made by Gary that's in the downed C-17. Dennis obtains the explosive and receives a communique from Madigan, instructing him to regroup. Seconds later, a scream is heard. Dennis takes the elevator to Madigan's position, and he is shocked to find Roger, now hideously mutated into a superior fighting machine. Dennis engages Roger in a knockdown drag-out fight and emerges victorious. He comes across a gravely injured Madigan, who tells him that Felil was a CIA agent and the only person who was supposed to come back alive. Madigan reveals that he knew about the bacteria the entire time, and was given a secret objective by the government to destroy it. Other factions in the government, such as the CIA, ordered Felil to preserve the bacteria. Madigan takes on the suicidal task of delivering the explosive to the coolant reactor, but not before leaving Dennis the new leader of Team Red Light. Meanwhile, back in Building B, Gary tells Cindy that he was there when Andrew had died, mentioning that \\"The fighting was so fierce that Dennis couldn't even bring back his body.\\" Cindy confesses that when Dennis had informed her, she said things to Dennis she later came to regret. However, each time she had seen Dennis, she could not bring herself to apologize. Cindy and Gary agree that they are relying on Dennis to help them come out alive, and resolve to support him. Dennis arrives in Building B and hands Cindy the disk given to him by Madigan. Cindy deciphers it, whereupon she learns that project \\"Extermination\\" is a test of H0213's potential. This entails that everybody in the facility, including the Marines, are \\"guinea pigs\\" to the experiment, both to test infection against civilians and fighting capabilities when engaging the Marines. Dennis heads towards the last detonator, and is stopped at gunpoint by Dr. Yan Falken, a scientist who is obsessed with the bacteria, calling it his son. The room quakes and falling debris fatally strikes Falken. Dennis activates the last detonator and hurries back to Cindy and Gary who have boarded an LCAC Carrier. The facility explodes, and the master DNA strain Origin takes the form of a gigantic aquatic creature, and chases the LCAC holding the trio. Dennis mans the machine guns on the vessel and takes down Origin's fish form. It changes form into a gigantic beast and another battle commences on the LCAC, with Dennis the victor. The Origin then takes one last stand and creates a doppelganger of the Marine who caused the strain so much trouble. Dennis triumphs over the odds, ensuring the destruction of the master DNA strand and silencing the threat of the HO213 once and for all. After a brief conversation over the victory, Cindy apologizes to Dennis about the things she said to him. Dennis assures her that it is alright, as he also hated himself for never being able to help her. He continues to say: \\"So from now on if you ever need anything from me, you let me know and I'll be there. This time, I promise...\\" Development The development of Extermination was initially helmed by Tokuro Fujiwara's company Whoopee Camp prior to its dissolution. Reception Extermination received a generally average to positive reception from critics. Reviewers from both GameSpot and IGN praised the game for offering some originality to the genre, making some minor improvements over similar gameplay found in Resident Evil, the soundtrack and suitable graphics. However, they criticized the sometimes awkward, straightforward gameplay and voice acting, and how the game did not really offer anything that could top other survival horror releases. These publications rated the game 7.1 and 6.9 out of 10 respectively.http://ps2.ign.com/articles/164/164249p1.html IGN: Extermination Review. Created July 27, 2001.

It lies on the National Highway 248 (NH 48) or Gurgaon-Sohna-Alwar highway about from Gurgaon.  History  According to Mahabharata (900 BCE), the area was granted by the eldest Pandava king Yudhishthira to their teacher Dronacharya. Later is passed in the hands of Maurya empire to invaders like Parthian and Kushan, and Yaudheya after they expelled Kushanas from the area between Yamuna and Satluj. Yodheyas was subjugated by king Rudradaman I of Indo-Scythians and later by Gupta Empire and then by Hunas, who were overthrown by Yashodharman of Mandsaur and then by Yashovarman of Kannauj. The area was also ruled by Harsha (590 - 467 CE), Gurjara-Pratihara (mid 7th century CE to 11th century). Tomara dynasty, who founded Dhillika in 736 CE, were earlier tributaries of Partiharas, overthrew Partiharas. In 1156 CE, it was conquered by king Visaladeva Chauhan of Chauhan Dynasty. After the defeat of Prithviraj Chauhan conquered the area of Gurugram, Nuh, Bhiwani and Rewari in 1182 CE. After the defeat of Prithviraj Chauhan in 1192 CE, the area came under Qutb al-Din Aibak (1206 CE) of Delhi Sultanate who defeated and killed Prithviraj's son Hemraj who had invaded Mewat are from Alwar. Meo who were all Hindus during those times, killed Sayyid Wajih-ud-din who was sent to subjugate Meos, but they were later suppressed by nephew of Aibak called Miran Hussain Jang and those Meo who remained Hindus were forced to pay Islamic religious tax Jizya and others were forced to convert to Islam. In 1249 CE, Balban killed 2000 rebellious Meos. Meo rebels took away large number of camels of Balban's army in 1257-58 CE. In 1260 CE, Balban retaliated by overrunning the area and killing 250 Meo prisoners and slaughtered 12,000 women, children and surviving men.  Khanzada Rajput Era  At the time of invasion of Timur in 1398 CE,Bahadur Nahar formerly known as Sonpar Pal, of Hindu Jadu clan was the prominent king of the area, who constructed the fort called Kotla Bahadur Nahar near Kotla lake at Kotla village of Nuh. Sonpar Pal converted to Islam in 1355 and was given a new name of Raja Nahar Khan (not to be confused with Jatt king Nahar Singh) by Sultan Firuz Shah Tughlaq. He became founder of Khanzada Rajputs. After the fall of Tughlaq dynasty in 1398, Nahar Khan reconciled with Timur. In 1420, during the era of Nahar Khan's grandson, Khanzada Feroz Khan, Mewat was attacked by Sultan Khizr Khan of Delhi Sayyid dynasty .The Mewati army fortified themselves for one year in Kotla Fort, after which the Delhi army retreated. In 1425, great grandsons of Bahadur Nahar named Khanzada Jalal Khan and Khanzada Abdul Qadir Khan (Jallu and Qaddu) revolted against Dehli Sultanate, they were defeated by Delhi Sultan Mubarak Shah ( 1421‚Äì 1434 CE) who overran Mewat and killed Qaddu. Jallu continued the native Mewati rebellion against the Delhi sultanate,in 1427, the Mewati army fortified themselves for one year in the hills of Tijara, after which the Delhi army retreated.In 1527, Hasan Khan Mewati, a descendant of Raja Nahar Khan, sided with Rajput king Rana Sanga and they were defeated by Babur at Battle of Khanwa where Hassan Khan Mewati was killed by Mughals and his son Naher Khan II ruled Mewat as a vassal of Mughals.  Mughal Era  Aurangzeb sent Jai Singh I to crush the revolting Khanzada chief Ikram Khan,Jagirdar of Tijara a descendant of Raja Nahar Khan(through his son Malik Alaudin Khan). After the death of Aurangzeb, Bahadurgarh and Farrukhnagar in the north were under the Baloch nawabs who were granted jagir in 1713 CE by Mughal king Farrukhsiyar, central area of Badshapur was under Hindu Badgujar Rajput king Hathi Singh and south including Nuh were under the great Jat king of Bharatpur State, Maharaja Suraj Mal. During Maratha Empire the area was conquered by their French generals in late 18th century and they granted Farukhnagar to George Thomas and Jharsa (Badshahpur) to Begum Sumro and south area including Nuh stayed under the Bharatpur Jat Kings and their vassal relatives, one of whom was Nahar Singh.Gazeteer of Gurgaon 1983 , Haryana Revenue Department, Chapter II, pp.35-45.Gazeteer of Gurgaon 1910\\" , Haryana Revenue Department, Section B, pp.19-24.Gazeteer of Gurgaon 1883-84\\" , Haryana Revenue Department, Chapter II, pp.19-25.

Journal of Biogeography. doi:10.1111/jbi.13380 The queen is 7‚Äì9 mm long, males 3‚Äì4 mm and workers 2‚Äì4 mm. Their colour varies from yellow to brown, with queen and males being slightly more darkly colored. The species lives primarily underground in meadows and very commonly, lawns. The nests are often completely overgrown by grass, however, often their presence is betrayed by small mounds of loose soil material between the grass stalks. They will also nest under large rocks or concrete slabs. Lawn nesting will eventually become obvious as the aphids clear sections of grass or portions of gardens. The yellow meadow ant feeds on the honeydew from root aphids, which they breed in their nests. During winter, the aphids themselves are sometimes eaten. As a consequence of their feeding habits, the species only occasionally forages outside the nest. Evidence of their underground lives is their lack of pigmentation and the smaller size of their eyes, compared to closely related species like the black garden ant. They are a timid species and will often simply barricade their tunnels to fight off invaders. Alates (winged, unmated queens and males) can be seen on warm days and evenings of July and August. This is one of the rare times that they are seen, as workers open up their nest entrances and herd the young winged ants out of the nest. Colonies are often founded by multiple queens (pleometrosis). Later on, when the first workers emerge, fights between the founder queens will erupt, with only one queen left (monogyne). However, this species is also known to have single colonies with multiple queens and up to 250,000 workers, when they are spread out over multiple interconnected nests.

The following year, he was the original penciler of the revival of Doom Patrol,Manning \\"1980s\\" in Dolan, p. 229: \\"October [1987] saw a new Doom Patrol series, by writer Paul Kupperberg and artist Steve Lightle.\\" but he left after the first five-issue story arc due to creative differences. Much of Lightle's work since then has been as a cover artist for which he typically inks his own penciled artwork. In 1989 and 1990, Lightle was the regular cover artist for Classic X-Men (later retitled X-Men Classic). He produced new covers and frontispieces to accompany the reprinted stories.

It is endemic to China. It is named after the British naturalist John Reeves, who first introduced live specimens to Europe in 1831. Description Male Males measure long and weigh . The male is brightly plumaged with a scaled golden white and red body plumage, grey legs, brown iris and bare red skin around the eye. The head is white with a black narrow band across its eyes. The male has an extremely long silvery white tail barred with chestnut brown. This pheasant is mentioned in the 2008 edition of Guinness World Records for having the longest natural tail feather of any bird species; a record formerly held by the crested argus pheasant. The tail can measure up to long. Females measure long and weigh . They are brown with a blackish crown, a buff face and greyish brown barred tail feathers. The females are about the same size as a male common pheasant. There are no known subspecies, but there is some variation in plumage. Distribution and habitat Male The Reeves's pheasant is endemic to evergreen forests of central and eastern China. Where introduced, they also inhabit farmland close to woodlands. The tail of the male bird grows approximately every year. They have been introduced for sport and ornamental purposes to the United States, Czech Republic, France and the United Kingdom. In the latter three countries, they have built up small breeding populations, and are still released on a small scale for shooting, often alongside common pheasants. Due to ongoing habitat loss, and overhunting for food and its tail plumes, the Reeves's pheasant is evaluated as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. There are thought to be only around 2000 birds remaining in the wild. Behaviour Male Reeves's pheasant, green pheasant, Lady Amherst's pheasant and golden pheasant (front to back). The Reeves's pheasant is a hardy bird and is able to tolerate both hot and cold weather. They prefer higher ground for nesting. The female lays a clutch of 7‚Äì14 eggs in April or May; the incubation period is 24‚Äì25 days. Reeves's pheasants are often aggressive towards humans, animals, and other pheasants, particularly during the breeding season. Their call is unlike other game birds in that it is a musical warble, sounding more passerine than a galliform bird. Their diet is vegetable matter, including seeds and cereals. They are fairly common in aviculture.

Philip \\"Phil\\" Peter Dalhausser (born January 26, 1980) is an American professional beach volleyball player, playing as a blocker. He and his former playing partner, Todd Rogers, were the 2007 AVP Tour and FIVB world champions. Dalhausser and Rogers dominated both the domestic US tour and now the FIVB international tour winning #1 team honors on both tours in 2010. Dalhausser and Rogers were Olympic gold medalists at the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics. He also won gold in Rio for beach volleyball with a fellow FSU volleyball coach and competitive player.  Personal life  Dalhausser was born in Baden, Aargau, Switzerland, to a German father, Peter, and a Swiss mother, Marianne. His brother Mark lives in Brooklyn, New York. He now calls his hometown Ventura, California. He attended Mainland High School in Daytona Beach, Florida. Dalhausser did not start playing volleyball until his senior year in high school. He attended the University of Central Florida and joined Lambda Chi Alpha, where he was named \\"Most Valuable Player\\" and received the William G. Morgan Award for most outstanding player. He earned a business degree at UCF and played for the club volleyball team.\\"Bio: Phil Dalhausser \\" UCF. After college, he worked for a concrete company and then worked a short time for a firm that painted stripes on Florida highways. In 2011, Dalhausser married Jennifer Corral, who was also a professional beach volleyball player. The couple has two children.  Volleyball Career   AVP  Dalhausser has previously teamed up with Nick Lucena. At 6'9\\" (206 cm), Dalhausser led the 2005‚Äì2010 AVP tour in blocks. In 2005 he was sixth in kill percentage. In 2006, Dalhausser teamed up with Todd Rogers. Rogers, an 11 years veteran of professional beach volleyball, thought he needed someone to help him get to the next level and believed Dalhausser had the potential to become the best player in the world. Rogers plays two roles, both partner and coach to Dalhausser. In 2007, Dalhausser and Rogers won the Beach Volleyball World Championships in Gstaad, Switzerland, becoming the first U.S. beach team to win the gold medal at the tournament.  Olympics  Dalhausser qualified for the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics to represent the United States with his teammate Todd Rogers by being the top seeded American team through the international qualification process. Dalhausser and Rogers had a record of 6‚Äì1 in their first Olympics, being upset in their opening match by 23rd-ranked Latvia. They proceeded to win the rest of their games, coming back from 6-0 in the third set to beat 20th-seeded Switzerland. Dalhausser and Rogers won the gold medal match two sets to one against M√°rcio Ara√∫jo and Fabio Luiz Magalh√£es of Brazil. Newly crowned women's beach volleyball champions and compatriots Misty May-Treanor and Kerri Walsh were watching from the stands in the final. Dalhausser made nine blocks in the championship match, with five coming in the deciding third set, putting the US up to a 9-1 lead and eventually winning it 15-4. Dalhausser was named tournament MVP. This made the United States the only country to win gold medals in men's and women's beach volleyball at the same Olympics.

It originally appeared in the June and July 1954 issues of magazine Astounding Science Fiction, and was later reprinted in 1956 as part of Ace Double D-199 under the title Planet of No Return, and again as a stand-alone Ace novel in February 1978 under the original title. Planet Troas Anderson was approached in 1953 by Twayne Press editor Fletcher Pratt with a story proposal: a scientist would create a world, and then he, Isaac Asimov and James Blish (Asimov thought the third writer might have been Blish's then- wife, Virginia Kidd)Asimov, Isaac, In Memory Yet Green, Section 55, Subsection 8. () would write novellas set in that world. The three novellas would then be published as a book, together with an essay by the scientist who created the scenario. This formula, which Pratt called a Twayne Triplet, had already resulted in the 1952 book The Petrified Planet. The scenario created was that of a binary star system in the Messier 13 globular cluster with an Earthlike planet called Troas (or more informally, Junior) located at one of the system's Lagrangian points. An earlier expedition to Troas had suffered some mysterious disaster, and a second expedition was being mounted to determine if the planet was suitable for colonization, and to find out what happened to the first expedition. Anderson finished his story, and Asimov finished a story called \\"Sucker Bait\\", but Blish (or Kidd) never completed the third story, and the proposed book never saw print. Anderson was able to sell Question and Answer to Astounding (where it appeared a few months after \\"Sucker Bait\\") and later to Ace Books. Plot summary John Lorenzen is an astronomer from Lunopolis who is recruited by the Lagrange Institute for the second expedition to Troas. At this time, Earth is still recovering from a two-century-long era of war and chaos that began with the Soviet conquest of North America in World War III and ended with the unification of the Solar System at the conclusion of a war between Mars and Venus. Twenty-two years after the discovery of a faster-than-light drive, Troas is the only Earthlike world to be discovered, and enthusiasm for interstellar travel is waning. If Troas is not opened to colonization, humanity may give up interstellar travel altogether. The effort to mount a second expedition to Troas is plagued with difficulties. The Lagrange Institute is unable to charter a starship and must build its own, the Henry Hudson. The construction of the Hudson is hampered by delays, cost overruns, and at least one act of outright sabotage. The voyage of the Hudson to Troas is also troubled, as tension rises among the members of the expedition. Edward Avery, the expedition's psychomed, is unable to maintain group harmony aboard the ship, and at least one fight breaks out. Upon arrival at Troas, the crew of the Hudson find no trace of the first expedition. After it is determined that there are no harmful microorganisms on Troas, a base camp is established on the planet. Eighteen days later, a group of aliens appears. Avery is assigned to learn the aliens' language, and he reports that it is extremely difficult to understand. He is eventually able to determine that the aliens are called the Rorvan, and that they are native to Troas. This is bad news for the expedition, since planets with native intelligent species are off limits to colonization. The Rorvan invite a small group of humans, including Avery and Lorenzen, to accompany them to their settlement. As the group of humans and Rorvan travel, Lorenzen listens to Avery's conversations with the aliens and realizes that their language is not nearly as difficult to understand as the psychomed claims. By the time they reach the Rorvan settlement, Lorenzen has learned through his eavesdropping that Avery and the Rorvan are conspiring to deceive the other humans. When Lorenzen finally confronts Avery, the psychomed admits that he and his clique within Earth's government have been deliberately stifling interstellar travel, since they feel that humanity is not ready for it. The members of the first expedition were interned after returning to the Solar System, and the Rorvan are not native to Troas after all. Avery pleads with Lorenzen to help him maintain the deception, but Lorenzen refuses. He wants humanity to expand into the galaxy. Psychotechnic League Although \\"Question and Answer\\" is similar in background to the stories that make up Anderson's Psychotechnic League future history, Anderson himself did not include \\"Question and Answer\\" in a timeline of the Psychotechnic League stories that he created to accompany the novella \\"The Snows of Ganymede\\" in the Winter 1955 issue of Startling Stories, even though the story had already been published in Astounding by then. He also failed to mention any connection in his introduction to the 1978 Ace Books edition of the story.Anderson, Poul, Question and Answer (Ace Books, 1978), Introduction. () Further, the outcome of World War III, as well as events in the centuries immediately following the war, is inconsistent between \\"Question and Answer\\" and the Psychotechnic League stories. In the book, as noted, the Soviet Union conquered North America and Europe fell into a centuries-long devastation and chaos; conversely, in the Psychotechnic League history, the Soviet Union was totally destroyed, the survivors of its population reduced to the condition of \\"howling cannibals\\", while Europe recovered from its war devastation within a single generation. In \\"Question and Answer\\" there is no mention of the Psychotechnic Institute. (In \\"Marius\\" it is noted that psychotechnics was started by the Finnish Professor Valti - a staunch opponent of the Soviets, who had a major role in freeing Europe from their occupation; obviously, Valti's life and scientific career would be completely different in a history where the Soviet Union won the war). In Psychotechnic League stories and books, psychotechnics stands for human peace and prosperity, for unification of Earth and afterwards of the entire Solar System - as against the forces of militarism, nationalism, political and religious extremism, which have caused World War III and might, if not stopped, cause \\"another war which humanity may not survive\\" (as described in \\"Marius\\"). On these terms, Anderson is obviously on the side of psychotechnics and the characters representing the author's point of view act accordingly. In \\"Question and Answer\\", however, psychotechnics - having succeeded in establishing peace and stability - sets itself squarely against spaceward expansion, seeking to keep humanity within the protecting cocoon of the Solar System and prevent its spread throughout the Galaxy. With this at stake, Anderson (and the character representing his point of view) turns against psychotechnics and for galactic expansion. This is inevitable, given Anderson's staunch support and advocacy of space flight in all periods of his fiction and non-fiction writing. The basic theme of the book is similar to that of Asimov's The End of Eternity - though this similarity becomes evident only towards the respective ends of both books. In both - one dealing with spaceflight and exploration and the other with time-travel - an organization of well-meaning meddlers interferes to \\"guide\\" and manipulate the course of human history, with the aim of promoting safety, security and stability, and with the price being to stifle spaceflight and galactic exploration and colonization. And in both, the protagonist finally decides to abort these efforts and opt for galactic expansion, even at the cost of instability and uncertainty.

They are a 16-membered macrocyclic lactone derivatives with potent anthelmintic and insecticidal properties. These naturally occurring compounds are generated as fermentation products by Streptomyces avermitilis, a soil actinomycete. Eight different avermectins were isolated in four pairs of homologue compounds, with a major (a-component) and minor (b-component) component usually in ratios of 80:20 to 90:10. Other anthelmintics derived from the avermectins include ivermectin, selamectin, doramectin, eprinomectin, and abamectin. Half of the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to William C. Campbell and Satoshi ≈åmura for discovering avermectin, \\"the derivatives of which have radically lowered the incidence of river blindness and lymphatic filariasis, as well as showing efficacy against an expanding number of other parasitic diseases.\\"  History  In 1978, an actinomycete was isolated at the Kitasato Institute from a soil sample collected at Kawana, Ito City, Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan. Later that year, the isolated actinomycete was sent to Merck Sharp and Dohme Research Laboratories for testing. Various carefully controlled broths were fermented using the isolated actinomycete. Early tests indicated that some of the whole, fermented broths were active against Nematospiroides dubius in mice over at least an eight-fold range without notable toxicity. Subsequent to this, the anthelmintic activity was isolated and identified as a family of closely related compounds. The compounds were finally characterized and the novel species that produced them were described by a team at Merck in 1978. In 2002, Yoko Takahashi and others at the Kitasato Institute for Life Sciences, Kitasato University, and at the Kitasato Institute, proposed that Streptomyces avermitilis be renamed Streptomyces avermectinius.  Dosing A commonly used therapy in recent times has been based on oral, parenteral, topical, or spot topical (as in veterinary flea repellant \\"drops\\") administration of avermectins. They show activity against a broad range of nematodes and arthropod parasites of domestic animals at dose rates of 300 Œºg/kg or less (200 Œºg/kg ivermectin appearing to be the common interspecies standard, from humans to horses to house pets, unless otherwise indicated). Unlike the macrolide or polyene antibiotics, they lack significant antibacterial or antifungal activities.  Mechanism of action  The avermectins block the transmission of electrical activity in invertebrate nerve and muscle cells mostly by enhancing the effects of glutamate at the invertebrate-specific glutamate-gated chloride channel, with minor effects on gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors. This causes an influx of chloride ions into the cells, leading to hyperpolarisation and subsequent paralysis of invertebrate neuromuscular systems; comparable doses are not toxic for mammals because they do not possess glutamate-gated chloride channels.  Toxicity and side effects  Resistance to avermectins has been reported, which suggests moderation in use. Research on ivermectin, piperazine, and dichlorvos in combinations also shows potential for toxicity. Avermectin has been reported to block LPS-induced secretion of tumor necrosis factor, nitric oxide, prostaglandin E2, and increase of intracellular concentration of Ca2+. Adverse effects are usually transient; severe effects are rare and probably occur only with substantial overdose, but include coma, hypotension, and respiratory failure, which can lead to death. No specific therapy exists, but symptomatic management usually leads to a favorable prognosis. Avermectin biosynthesis Diagram showing the schematic synthesis of avermectins The gene cluster for biosynthesis of avermectin from S. avermitilis has been sequenced. The avermectin biosynthesis gene cluster encodes enzymes responsible for four steps of avermectin production: 1) production of the avermectin aglycon by polyketide synthases, 2) modification of the aglycon, 3) synthesis of modified sugars, and 4) glycosylation of the modified avermectin aglycon. This gene cluster can produce eight avermectins which have minor structural differences. Organization of the avermectin polyketide synthase The avermectin initial aglycon is synthesized by the polyketide synthase activity of four proteins (AVES 1, AVES 2, AVES 3, and AVES 4). The activity of this enzyme complex is similar to type I polyketide synthases. Either 2-methylbutyrl CoA or isobutyrl CoA can be used as starting units and are extended by seven acetate units and five propionate units to produce avermectin ‚Äúa‚Äù series or ‚Äúb‚Äù series, respectively. The initial aglycon is subsequently released from the thioesterase domain of AVES 4 by formation of an intramolecular cyclic ester. The avermectin initial aglycon is further modified by other enzymes in the avermectin biosynthetic gene cluster. AveE has cytochrome P450 monooxygenase activity and facilitates the furan ring formation between C6 and C8. AveF has NAD(P)H-dependent ketoreductase activity which reduces the C5 keto group to a hydroxyl. AveC influences the dehydratase activity in module two (affecting C22-C23), although the mechanism by which it does this is not clear. AveD has SAM-dependent C5 O-methyltransferase activity. Whether AveC or AveD acts on the aglycon determines whether the resulting avermectin aglycon will produce avermectin series ‚ÄúA‚Äù or ‚ÄúB‚Äù and series 1 or 2, respectively. Nine open reading frames (orf1 and aveBI-BVIII) are downstream of aveA4, which are known involved with glycosylation and sugar synthesis. AveBII-BVIII are responsible for synthesis of dTDP-L-oleandrose and AveBI is responsible for glycosylation of the avermectin aglycon with the dTDP-sugar. The sequence of orf1 suggests that its product will have reductase activity, but this functionality does not appear to be necessary for avermectin synthesis.  Other uses  Abamectin is the active ingredient in some commercial ant bait traps.

Andrew Lang included it in The Orange Fairy Book. Synopsis A goat herder and his wife had three sons and a daughter. One day, the daughter vanished while tending the kids. The kids came home. Her parents could not find her. Ardan, the eldest son, declared he would set out in search of his sister. His mother reproved him for not asking his father first. But since he had made a vow, she made two cakes, a large one and a little one, and asked which one he wanted, the big one without her blessing or the little one with it. He picked the large cake. When a raven asked him for some, he refused it. Then he came to an old man in a cottage, with a young woman combing her hair of gold. The old man offered to let him watch his three cows for a year. The young woman warned against it, but he refused her advice rudely and took the service anyway. The old man told him to follow the cows, because they knew good pasture, and to never leave them. But the first day watching the cows, he saw a golden cock and a silver hen, and let them distract him, and also a staff of gold and a staff of silver. When he brought them back, the cows had no milk, only water. The old man turned Ardan to stone. Then Ruais, the second son, set out in the same manner, and suffered the same fate. Finally, Covan the Brown-haired, the youngest, asked leave to go after his brothers. His father gave him his blessing, and Covan took the smaller cake and gave the raven some. When he came to the cottage, he thanked the maiden for her advice, though he did not take it. He followed the cows and sat down when they came to pasture. There he heard music and listened to it. A boy ran to him and claimed his cows were in the corn; Covan said he could have driven them out in the time it took to come to him. Then the boy returned with the claim that dogs were worrying the cows; Covan said he could not have driven the dogs out in the time it took to reach him. Then the cows went on. They went through a barren pasture, on which a mare and her foal were fat; a lush pasture with a starving mare and her foal, and a lake with two boats, one with happy youths going to the land of the Sun, and the other with grim shapes, going to the land of Night. The cows went on, and it grew so dark he could not see the cows. The Dog of Maol-mor, whom he had heard of, bade him stay the night. He did. In the morning, the dog was grateful, because he took what was offered and did not mock him, and so said he could call on him for aid. The next day, the cows ended in a barren plain. The raven offered him hospitality and he took it. The raven was grateful that he took it and did not mock it, and so said he could call on him for aid. The next day, the cows ended by a river. The famous otter Doran-donn offered Covan his hospitality, and he took it, and the otter offered to come to his aid. Then the cows returned, and they had milk instead of water. The old man was pleased and wanted to know what Covan wanted as a reward. Covan wanted to know how to get his brothers and sister back. The old man warned him that it would be hard, but told him where to get a roe with white feet and a deer's antlers, a duck with a green body and a gold neck, and a salmon with silver skin and red gills. If he brought those to the old man, he could get his brothers and sister back. The dog helped him catch the roe; the raven, the duck; and the otter, the salmon. The old man gave him back his sister, and restored his brothers, though they would be fated to wander forever for their idle and unfaithful ways. Covan asked him his name. He said he was the Spirit of Age.

It is the site of the school's indoor track facilities, ROTC offices and classes, and Cornell Police. It also served as the location of the former band room, once used by the Cornell Big Red Marching Band and the Cornell Big Red Pep Band. However, the summer of 2013 saw the completion of a new building for the Big Red Bands adjacent to Schoellkopf Field. For a long time, Barton Hall was the largest unpillared room in existence. The interior of the building covers almost , and includes a 1/8 mile (200m) indoor track. Building The New York State Drill Hall was designed by the official State Architect of New York, Lewis Pilcher. It was built to provide military instruction to Cornell students, as required by Cornell's status as a land- grant institution. Its drill shed originally contained 362 x 228 feet of open floor space, large enough to accommodate 1,000 men. The building is made of local limestone with double trusses spaced 40 feet apart to support the roof. The Architectural Record called the \\"splendid drill hall\\" a \\"notably modern achievement in American architecture.\\" History It was built in 1914 and 1915 and was originally designed as a drill hall for the Department of Military Science. Upon its completion it was often referred to as the \\"New Armory\\", as opposed to the Old Armory, a building on the now Engineering Quadrangle that has since been demolished and replaced by Hollister Hall. In January 1940, it was named for Col. Frank A. Barton, Class of 1891. Colonel Barton was one of the first two Cornell students to receive an army commission in Cornell's Military Science Program, and was the first ROTC commandant at Cornell from 1904 to 1908. During World War I, Barton Hall functioned as an airplane hangar and it served the ROTC as an armory during World War II. Barton Hall was well known to all Cornellians. In the days prior to online course registration, each student would come to Barton Hall at the start of the semester to register for classes. This process would involve placing punched cards into bins for each class positioned on tables throughout the hall. Student organizations would also recruit members at these events. In the first part of the 20th century, \\"drill\\" was mandatory for all male students, and it would be conducted in Barton Hall. Also, until 1974, graduation was conducted in Barton Hall, until it was moved outdoors to Schoellkopf Field. For many years, it also hosted graduation ceremonies for Ithaca High School. Barton Hall was home to Cornell Basketball between 1919 and 1990 when the new field house, later named Bartels Hall, was completed. In 1995, Barton received another major change with the construction of the H. Hunt Bradley Track Center under the south bleachers. The center includes a Hall of Fame/meeting room/study facility for track, an office, a library and a weight room. Occupations and protests In the Spring of 1969 members of the Afro- American Society (AAS) occupied Willard Straight Hall, the Cornell Student Union, in protest against judicial sanctions against several black students and to demand a black studies program. Two days after the students left Willard Straight Hall, a Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) meeting became a \\"student takeover of Barton Hall\\" and the Barton Hall Community was formed. On May 11, 1972, Barton Hall was again the site of anti-war protests, and one protester threw a rock through a window. The rock thrower was mistakenly identified as physics major James R. Bean, who was later suspended and placed on trial for first degree riot, a class E felony. Bean was acquitted after a four-day trial. Before the end of the trial, the District Attorney subpoenaed the defense witnesses to appear before the grand jury to further investigate the protest. The Bean trial was a high point in political tensions between the town and the campus and marked an end to efforts to prosecute anti-war protesters off-campus. ROTC training For many years, Barton Hall had a non-operational deck gun used in Navy ROTC Training which was fenced off from the general public. On May 1, 1969, as a protest against the Vietnam War, members of the Students for a Democratic Society broke into the fenced area and painted anti-war slogans on the gun . In a departure from the practice of handling student disciplinary issues with the campus judicial system, eight of the protesters were prosecuted in the city courts for trespassing, but charges against them were dropped. In September 1969, the week-long trial attracted great publicity because the defense called as witnesses a large number of administrators, trustees, President Dale Corson, and former President James A. Perkins to testify. Concerts Barton Hall also serves as a concert venue for the Cornell Campus, with concerts produced by the Cornell Concert Commission. It has hosted acts such as The Grateful Dead, Santana, Ludacris, Bob Dylan, Death Cab For Cutie, Franz Ferdinand, The Cribs and The Flaming Lips. The Grateful Dead's concert at Barton Hall on May 8, 1977 is considered by some to be the greatest of their career. In 2011, a recording of the concert was one of 25 recordings selected that year for preservation in the National Recording Registry at the Library of Congress. The concert is available in full on the band's 2017 live album Cornell 5/8/77. Renovation In 2009‚Äì2011, Barton Hall underwent a $8 million renovation, including structural repairs, work on the gutters and masonry, and replacement of the roof and windows. Current uses Interior windows of Barton Hall Barton Hall now contains a 200 m track, basketball courts, the Hart Memorial Library, and the Wortham Museum. After the opening of Newman Arena, the building was remodeled into a premier indoor track facility. The Recaflex track features eight 42-inch lanes, one of the few indoor 200-meter tracks in the country with eight such lanes. Barton also contains a throwing cage with a cement circle and crusher dust landing sector surrounded by a high chain link fence. The interior of the track has a Recaflex runway for the pole vault, two long and triple jump pits and multiple high jump areas. The track itself has a raised aluminum curb and a common finish line. Barton Hall is also home to the three ROTC Detachments on campus: Army, Navy, and Air Force. Each branch has a dedicated corner of the building where classes are held in their respective fields. Lead labs and drill labs also occur in Barton Hall whether on the track floor or within the detachment buildings themselves. Barton Hall also contains an indoor challenge course, that has similar elements to those found outside at the Hoffman Challenge Course owned and operated by Cornell Team & Leadership Center. The Barton Hall Challenge Course has several unique, exciting elements.

Motor nerve cell from ventral horn of medulla spinalis of rabbit. The angular and spindle-shaped Nissl bodies are well shown. A Nissl body, also known as Nissl substance and Nissl material, is a large granular body found in neurons. These granules are of rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) with rosettes of free ribosomes, and are the site of protein synthesis. It was named after Franz Nissl, a German neuropathologist who invented the Nissl staining method. Nissl bodies can be demonstrated by a method of selective staining developed by Nissl (Nissl staining), using an aniline stain to label extranuclear RNA granules. This staining method is useful to localize the cell body, as it can be seen in the soma and dendrites of neurons, though not in the axon or axon hillock. Due to RNA's basophilic (\\"base-loving\\") properties it is stained blue by this method. Nissl bodies show changes under various physiological conditions and in pathological conditions such as axonotmesis they may dissolve and disappear (chromatolysis) in an attempt to upregulate protein synthesis for axonal repair and Nissl bodies would reappear after a successful repair. Chromatolysis means disappearance of Nissl bodies. Function The functions of Nissl bodies is thought to be the same as that of the rest of the ER and the Golgi apparatus: the manufacture and release of proteins and amino acids. The ultrastructure of Nissl bodies suggests they are primarily concerned with the synthesis of proteins for intracellular use.

The young nation joined Britain in the First World War, suffered through the Great Depression in Australia as part of the global Great Depression and again joined Britain in the Second World War against Nazi Germany in 1939. Imperial Japan launched air raids and submarine raids against Australian cities during the Pacific War. Federation The First Fleet of British ships had arrived at Sydney Harbour in 1788, founding the first of what would evolve into six self-governed British colonies: New South Wales, Tasmania, South Australia, Western Australia, Victoria and Queensland. The last British garrisons had left Australia in 1870.C.E.W Bean; ANZAC to Amiens; Penguin Books; 2014 Edition; p.5 At the beginning of the 20th century, nearly two decades of negotiations on Federation concluded with the approval of a federal constitution by all six Australian colonies and its subsequent ratification by the British parliament in 1900. This resulted in the political integration of the six Australian colonies into one federated Australian Commonwealth, formally proclaimed on 1 January 1901. Melbourne was chosen as the temporary seat of government while a purpose-designed capital city, Canberra, was constructed. The future King George V, then the Duke of York, opened the first Parliament of Australia on 9 May 1901, and his successor (later to be King George VI) opened the first session in Canberra during May 1927. Australia became officially autonomous in both internal and external affairs with the passage of the Statute of Westminster Adoption Act on 9 October 1942. The Australia Act 1986 eliminated the last vestiges of British legal authority at the Federal level. (The last state to remove recourse to British courts, Queensland, did not do so until 1988). Early 20th century Opening of the first Parliament of Australia in 1901 The Commonwealth of Australia came into being when the Federal Constitution was proclaimed by the Governor General, Lord Hopetoun, on 1 January 1901. The first Federal elections were held in March 1901 and resulted in a narrow majority for the Protectionist Party over the Free Trade Party with the Australian Labor Party (ALP) polling third. Labor declared it would offer support to the party which offered concessions and Edmund Barton's Protectionists formed a government, with Alfred Deakin as Attorney-General. Barton promised to \\"create a high court,... and an efficient federal public service.... He proposed to extend conciliation and arbitration, create a uniform railway gauge between the eastern capitals,however it was not until the 1960s that this occurred to introduce female federal franchise, to establish a... system of old age pensions.\\"Frank Crowley(1973)Modern Australia in Documents; 1901‚Äì1939. Volume 1.p.1. Wren Publishing, Melbourne. He also promised to introduce legislation to safeguard \\"White Australia\\" from any influx of Asian or Pacific Island labour. The Labor Party (the spelling \\"Labour\\" was dropped in 1912) had been established in the 1890s, after the failure of the Maritime and Shearer's strikes. Its strength was in the Australian Trade Union movement \\"which grew from a membership of just under 100,000 in 1901 to more than half a million in 1914.\\"Stuart MacIntyre (1986) p.86. The platform of the ALP was democratic socialist. Its rising support at elections, together with its formation of federal government in 1904 under Chris Watson, and again in 1908, helped to unify competing conservative, free market and liberal anti-socialists into the Commonwealth Liberal Party in 1909. Although this party dissolved in 1916, a successor to its version of \\"liberalism\\" in Australia which in some respects comprises an alliance of Millsian liberals and Burkian conservatives united in support for individualism and opposition to socialism can be found in the modern Liberal Party. To represent rural interests, the Country Party (today's National Party) was founded in 1913 in Western Australia, and nationally in 1920, from a number of state-based farmer's parties.Aitkin, (1972); Graham, (1959) Edmund Barton (left), the first Prime Minister of Australia, with Alfred Deakin, the second Prime Minister. Procession in support of an eight-hour work day, 4 October 1909 In writing about the preoccupations of the Australian population in early Federation Australia prior to World War One, the official Great War historian Charles Bean included the \\"White Australia Policy\\", which he defined as \\"a vehement effort to maintain a high Western standard of economy, society and culture (necessitating at that stage, however it might be camouflaged, the rigid exclusion of Oriental peoples).\\"C.E.W Bean; ANZAC to Amiens; Penguin Books; 2014 Edition; p.5 The Immigration Restriction Act 1901 was one of the first laws passed by the new Australian parliament. Aimed to restrict immigration from Asia (especially China), it found strong support in the national parliament, arguments ranging from economic protection to outright racism.Frank Crowley(1973)p.13 The law permitted a dictation test in any European language to be used to in effect exclude non-\\"white\\" immigrants. The ALP wanted to protect \\"white\\" jobs and pushed for more explicit restrictions. A few politicians spoke of the need to avoid hysterical treatment of the question. Member of Parliament Bruce Smith said he had \\"no desire to see low- class Indians, Chinamen or Japanese... swarming into this country.... But there is obligation...not (to) unnecessarily offend the educated classes of those nations\\"Bruce Smith (Free Trade Party) Parliamentary Debates cited in D.M.Gibb (1973) The Making of White Australia.p.113.

End of the 1940s  H V Evatt (left) and Ben Chifley (middle) with Clement Attlee (right) at the Dominion and British Leaders Conference, London, 1946 In 1944, the Liberal Party of Australia was formed, with Robert Menzies as its founding leader. The party would come to dominate the early decades of the post-war period. Outlining his vision for a new political movement in 1944, Menzies said: In April 1945, Prime Minister John Curtin despatched an Australian delegation which included attorney-general and minister for external affairs H V Evatt to discuss formation of the United Nations. Australia played a significant mediatory role in these early years of the United Nations, successfully lobbying for an increased role for smaller and middle-ranking nations and a stronger commitment to employment rights into the U.N. Charter. Evatt was elected president of the third session of the United Nations General Assembly (September 1948 to May 1949). When Labor Prime Minister John Curtin he passed away on July 1945. Frank Forde served as Prime Minister from 6‚Äì13 July, before the party elected Ben Chifley as Curtin's successor. Chifley, a former railway engine driver, won the 1946 election. His government introduced national projects, including the Snowy Mountains Scheme and an assisted immigration program and pursued centralist economic policies ‚Äì making the Commonwealth the collector of income tax, and seeking to nationalise the private banks. At the conference of the New South Wales Labor Party in June 1949, Chifely sought to define the labour movement as having: With an increasingly uncertain economic outlook, after his attempt to nationalise the banks and the coal strike by the Communist-dominated Miners Federation, Chifley lost office at the 1949 federal election to Menzies' newly established Liberal Party, in coalition with the Country Party.  Immigration and the post-war boom  Sir Robert Menzies, founder of the Liberal Party of Australia and Prime Minister of Australia 1939‚Äì41 (UAP) and 1949‚Äì66 After World War II, Australia launched a massive immigration program, believing that having narrowly avoided a Japanese invasion, Australia must \\"populate or perish.\\" As Prime Minister Ben Chifley would later declare, \\"a powerful enemy looked hungrily toward Australia. In tomorrow's gun flash that threat could come again. We must populate Australia as rapidly as we can before someone else decides to populate it for us.\\" Hundreds of thousands of displaced Europeans, including for the first time large numbers of Jews, migrated to Australia. More than two million people immigrated to Australia from Europe during the 20 years after the end of the war. From the outset, it was intended that the bulk of these immigrants should be mainly from the British Isles, and that the post-war immigration scheme would preserve the British character of Australian society. Although Great Britain remained the predominant source of immigrants, the pool of source countries was expanded to include Continental European countries in order to meet Australia's ambitious immigration targets. From the late 1940s onwards, Australia received significant waves of people from countries such as Greece, Italy, Malta, Germany, Yugoslavia and the Netherlands. Australia actively sought these immigrants, with the government assisting many of them and they found work due to an expanding economy and major infrastructure projects. The Australian economy stood in sharp contrast to war-ravaged Europe, and newly arrived migrants found employment in a booming manufacturing industry and government assisted programs such as the Snowy Mountains Scheme. This hydroelectricity and irrigation complex in south- east Australia consisted of sixteen major dams and seven power stations constructed between 1949 and 1974. It remains the largest engineering project undertaken in Australia. Necessitating the employment of 100,000 people from over 30 countries, to many it denotes the birth of multicultural Australia. In 1949 the 1941‚Äì1949 Labor government (led by Ben Chifley after John Curtin's death in 1945) was defeated by a Liberal-National Party Coalition government headed by Menzies. Politically, Menzies Government and the Liberal Party of Australia dominated much of the immediate post-war era, defeating the Chifley Government in 1949, in part over a Labor proposal to nationalise banksJan Bassett (1986) p.18 and following a crippling coal strike influenced by the Australian Communist Party. Menzies became the country's longest-serving Prime Minister and the Liberal party, in coalition with the rural based Country Party, won every federal until 1972. As in the United States in the early 1950s, allegations of communist influence in society saw tensions emerge in politics. Refugees from Soviet dominated Eastern Europe immigrated to Australia, while to Australia's north, Mao Zedong won the Chinese civil war in 1949 and in June 1950, Communist North Korea invaded South Korea. The Menzies government responded to a United States led United Nations Security Council request for military aid for South Korea and diverted forces from occupied Japan to begin Australia's involvement in the Korean War. After fighting to a bitter standstill, the UN and North Korean signed a ceasefire agreement in July 1953. Australian forces had participated in such major battles as Kapyong and Maryang San. 17,000 Australians had served and casualties amounted to more than 1,500, of whom 339 were killed.

Postwar migrants arriving in Australia in 1954 During the course of the Korean War, the Menzies Government attempted to ban the Communist Party of Australia, first by legislation in 1950 and later by referendum, in 1951.See Menzies in Frank Crowley (1973) Modern Australia in Documents, 1939‚Äì1970. p.222-226. Wren Publishing, Melbourne. While both attempts were unsuccessful, further international events such as the defection of minor Soviet Embassy official Vladimir Petrov, added to a sense of impending threat that politically favoured Menzies‚Äô Liberal-CP government, as the Labor Party pushed centralist economics and split over concerns about the influence of the Communist Party over the Trade Union movement, resulting in the a bitter split in 1955 and the emergence of the breakaway Democratic Labor Party (DLP). The DLP remained an influential political force, often holding the balance of power in the Senate, until 1974. Its preferences supported the Liberal and Country Party.Jan Bassett (1986) p.75-6 The Labor party was led by H.V. Evatt after Chifley's death in 1951. Evatt retired in 1960, and Arthur Calwell succeeded him as leader, with a young Gough Whitlam as his deputy. Menzies presided over a period of sustained economic boom and the beginnings of sweeping social change ‚Äì with the arrivals of rock and roll music and television in the 1950s. In 1956, television in Australia began broadcasting, Melbourne hosted the Olympics and, for the first time, performing artist Barry Humphries performed the character of Edna Everage as a parody of a house-proud housewife of staid 1950s Melbourne suburbia (the character only later morphed into a critique of self-obsessed celebrity culture). It was the first of many of his satirical stage and screen creations based around quirky Australian characters. In 1958, Australian country music singer Slim Dusty, who would become the musical embodiment of rural Australia, had Australia's first international music chart hit with his bush ballad \\"Pub With No Beer\\", while rock and roller Johnny O'Keefe's Wild One became the first local recording to reach the national charts, peaking at #20. Before sleeping through the 1960s Australian cinema produced little of its own content in the 1950s, but British and Hollywood studios produced a string of successful epics from Australian literature, featuring home grown stars Chips Rafferty and Peter Finch. Menzies remained a staunch supporter of links to the monarchy and British Commonwealth and formalised an alliance with the United States, but also launched post-war trade with Japan, beginning a growth of Australian exports of coal, iron ore and mineral resources that would steadily climb until Japan became Australia's largest trading partner. In the early 1950s, the Menzies government saw Australia as part of a \\"triple alliance\\", in concert with both the US and traditional ally Britain.Glen Barclay and Joseph Siracusa (1976) Australian American Relations Since 1945. p.35-49. Holt, Rinehart and Winston, Sydney. At first, \\"the Australian leadership opted for a consistently pro-British line in diplomacy\\", while at the same time looking for opportunities to involve the US in South East Asia.Glen Barclay and Joseph Siracusa (1976) p.35 Thus, other than the Korean War, the government also committed military forces to the Malayan Emergency and hosted British nuclear tests after 1952.See Adrian Tame and F.P.J Robotham (1982) Maralinga; British A-Bomb, Australian legacy. p.179 Fontana Books, Melbourne. Australia was also the only Commonwealth country to offer support to the British during the Suez Crisis.E.M. Andrews (1979) A History of Australian Foreign Policy. P.144 Longman Cheshire, Melbourne. Menzies oversaw an effusive welcome to Queen Elizabeth II on the first visit to Australia by a reigning monarch, in 1954. However, as British influence declined in South East Asia, the US alliance came to have greater significance for Australian leaders and the Australian economy. British investment in Australia remained significant until the late 1970s, but trade with Britain declined through the 1950s and 1960s. In the late 1950s the Australian Army began to re-equip using US military equipment. In 1962, the US established a naval communications station at North West Cape, the first of several built over the next decade.Glen Barclay and Joseph Siracusa (1976) p.63Also see Desmond Ball (1980) A suitable piece of real estate; American Installations in Australia. Hale and Iremonger. Sydney. Most significantly, in 1962, Australian Army advisors were sent to help train South Vietnamese forces, in a developing conflict the British had no part in. The ANZUS security treaty, which had been signed in 1951, had its origins in Australia's and New Zealand's fears of a rearmed Japan, but found new impetus through anti- communism. Its obligations on the US, Australia and New Zealand are vague, but its influence on Australian foreign policy thinking, at times significant.See discussion on the role of ANZUS in Australia's commitment to the Vietnam War in Paul Ham (2007) Vietnam; The Australian War. p.86-7 Harper Collins Publishers, Sydney. The SEATO treaty, signed only three years later, clearly demonstrated Australia's position as a US ally in the emerging cold war. On 26 November 1967, Australia became the seventh nation to put a satellite into Earth orbit, launching WRESAT from Woomera. When Menzies retired in January 1966, he was replaced as Liberal leader and Prime Minister by Harold Holt. The Holt Government increased Australian commitment to the growing War in Vietnam; oversaw conversion to decimal currency and faced Britain's withdrawal from Asia by visiting and hosting many Asian leaders and by expanding ties to the United States, hosting the first visit to Australia by an American president, his friend Lyndon Johnson. Significantly, Holt's government introduced the Migration Act 1966, which effectively dismantled the vestigial mechanisms of the White Australia Policy and increased access to non-European migrants, including refugees fleeing the Vietnam War. Holt also called the 1967 Referendum which removed the discriminatory clause in the Australian Constitution which excluded Aboriginal Australians from being counted in the census ‚Äì the referendum was one of the few to be overwhelmingly endorsed by the Australian electorate (over 90% voted 'yes'). Holt won the 1967 election with the largest parliamentary majority in 65 years, but Holt drowned while swimming at a surf beach in December 1967 and was replaced by John Gorton (1968‚Äì1971). The Gorton Government began winding down Australia's commitment to Vietnam, increased funding for the arts, standardised rates of pay between the men and women and continued moving Australian trade closer to Asia. The Liberals suffered a decline in voter support at the 1969 election and internal party division saw Gorton replaced by William McMahon (1971‚Äì1972) and, facing a reinvigorated Australian Labor Party led by Gough Whitlam, the Liberals entered their final stretch in office of a record 23 straight years period. 1960s and 1970s: The \\"Australian New Wave\\" \\"Australian to the bootheels\\": Prime Minister John Gorton established government support for Australian cinema. The Sydney Opera House was officially opened in 1973. From the mid-1960s, evidence of a new and more independent sense of national pride and identity began to emerge in Australia. In the early 1960s, the National Trust of Australia began to be active in preserving Australia's natural, cultural and historic heritage. Australian TV, while always dependent on US and British imports, saw locally made dramas and comedies appear, and programs such as Homicide developed strong local loyalty while Skippy the Bush Kangaroo became a global phenomenon. Liberal Prime Minister John Gorton, a battle scarred former fighter pilot, described himself as \\"Australian to the bootheels\\" and the Gorton Government established the Australian Council for the Arts, the Australian Film Development Corporation and the National Film and Television Training School. The late 1960s and early 1970s are often associated with a flowering of Australian culture. Indigenous Australians achieved greater rights, immigration restrictions and censorship laws were swept aside, theatre and opera companies were established across the country, and Australian rock music blossomed. The 1971 Springbok rugby tour was influential in raising awareness of Aboriginal injustice in Australia and also led Australia to become the first Western nation to cut sporting ties with South Africa. In a significant move against South Africa's apartheid regime, many Australians (including Wallabies) demonstrated against tours by the racially selected South African team. The Australian media tycoon Kerry Packer altered the traditionalist ethos of the game of cricket in the 1970s, inventing World Series Cricket from which have evolved many aspects of the various modern international forms of the game. The iconic Sydney Opera House finally opened in 1973 after numerous delays. In the same year, Patrick White became the first Australian to win a Nobel Prize for Literature.Geoffrey Bolton (1990) p.229-230 Australian History had begun to appear on school curriculums by the 1970sRichard White (1981) Inventing Australia; Images and Identity, 1688‚Äì1980. p.169 George Allen and Unwin, Sydney. and from the early 1970s, the Australian cinema began to produce the Australian New Wave of feature films based on uniquely Australian themes. Film funding began under the Gorton government, but it was the South Australian Film Corporation that took the lead in supporting filmmaking and among their great successes were quintessential Australian films Sunday Too Far Away (1974) Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975), Breaker Morant (1980) and Gallipoli (1981). The national funding body, the Australian Film Commission, was established in 1975. Significant changes also occurred to Australia's censorship laws after the new Liberal Minister for Customs and Excise, Don Chipp, was appointed in 1969. In 1968, Barry Humphries and Nicholas Garland's cartoon book featuring the larrikin character Barry McKenzie was banned. Yet only a few years later, the book had been made as a film, partly with the support of government funding.Anne Pender (March 2005) The Australian Journal of Politics and History. \\"The Mythical Australian: Barry Humphries, Gough Whitlam and new nationalism\\" The Mythical Australian: Barry Humphries, Gough Whitlam and \\"new nationalism\\" Australian Journal of Politics and History, TheFind Articles at BNET Anne Pender suggests that the Barry Mckenzie character both celebrated and parodied Australian nationalism. Historian Richard White also argues that \\"while many of the plays, novels and films produced in the 1970s were intensely critical of aspects of Australian life, they were absorbed by the ‚Äònew nationalism‚Äô and applauded for their Australianness.\\"Richard White (1981) p.170  Australia and the Vietnam War  Personnel and aircraft of RAAF Transport Flight Vietnam arrive in South Vietnam in August 1964 The Menzies Government despatched the first small contingent of Australian military training personnel to aid South Vietnam in 1962, so beginning Australia's decade long involvement in the Vietnam War. Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám, the leader of the government in South Vietnam, had requested security assistance from the US and its allies. The Australian government supported the commitment as part of global effort to stem the spread of communism in Europe and Asia. Ph√°p Hoa Temple, a Vietnamese Buddhist temple in Adelaide. Thousands of Vietnamese refugees were resettled in Australia following the communist victory in Vietnam. Initially popular, Australia's participation in Vietnam, and particularly the use of conscription, later became politically contentious and saw massive protests, though they were for the most part peaceful. The United States launched a major escalation of the war in 1965 and the Holt Government which succeeded Menzies, increased Australia's military commitment to the conflict. Holt won a massive majority in the 1967 Election. By 1969 however, anti-war protests were gathering momentum and opposition to conscription was growing, with more people believing the war could not be won. The Gorton Government (returned with a reduced majority at the 1969 Election) ceased to replace Australian personnel from 1970. There were large Moratorium marches in 1970 and 1971 and Australia's troop commitment continued to wind down through 1971 with the last battalion leaving Nui Dat in November. The election of the Whitlam Government in 1972 brought Australia's small remaining involvement in the war to an official close in June 1973 with the withdrawal of the last platoon guarding the Australian Embassy in Saigon. Australian forces were largely based at Nui Dat, Ph∆∞·ªõc Tuy Province, and participated in such notable battles as the Battle of Long Tan against the Viet Cong in 1966 and defending against the 1968 Tet Offensive. Almost 60,000 Australians had served in Vietnam and 521 had died as a result of the war. As the war became unpopular, protestors and conscienscious objectors became prominent and soldiers often met a hostile reception on their return home in the later stages of the conflict. In early 1975 the communists launched a major offensive resulting in the fall of Saigon on 30 April. The Royal Australian Airforce assisted in final humanitarian evacuations. In the aftermath of the communist victory, Australia assisted in re-settlement of Vietnamese refugees, with thousands making their way to Australian through the 1970s and 1980s. Papua New Guinea and Nauru independence Australia had administered Papua New Guinea and Nauru for much of the 20th century. British New Guinea (Papua) had passed to Australia in 1906. German New Guinea was captured by Australia during the First World War, becoming a League of Nations mandate after the war. Following the bitter New Guinea campaign of World War II which saw occupation of half the island by Imperial Japan, the Territory of Papua and New Guinea was established by an administrative union between the Australian-administered Territory of Papua and Territory of New Guinea in 1949. Under Liberal Minister for External Territories Andrew Peacock, Papua and New Guinea adopted self-government in 1972 and on 15 September 1975, during the term of the Whitlam Government in Australia, the Territory became the independent nation of Papua New Guinea. Australia had captured the island of Nauru from the German Empire in 1914. After Japanese occupation during World War II, it became a UN Trust Territory under Australia and remained so until achieving independence in 1968. In 1989 Nauru sued Australia in the International Court of Justice in The Hague for damages caused by mining. Australia settled the case out of court agreeing to a lump sum settlement of A$107 million and an annual stipend of the equivalent of A$2.5 million toward environmental rehabilitation.  Whitlam, Fraser and the dismissal  Gough Whitlam during the 1972 federal election. Elected in December 1972 after 23 years in opposition, Labor won office under Gough Whitlam and introduced a significant program of social change and reform. Whitlam said before the election: \\"our program has three great aims. They are ‚Äì to promote equality; to involve the people of Australia in ‚Ä¶ decision making‚Ä¶; and to liberate the talents and uplift the horizons of the Australian people.\\"Gough Whitlam, Bankstown Speech.13 November 1972. Cited in Sally Warhaft (Ed.) (2004) Well may we say‚Ä¶ The Speeches that made Australia. p.178-9 Blac Inc, Melbourne. Whitlam's actions were immediate and dramatic. Within a few weeks the last military advisors in Vietnam were recalled, and national service ended. The People's Republic of China was recognised (Whitlam had visited China while Opposition Leader in 1971) and the embassy in Taiwan closed.Geoffrey Bolton (1990) p.215-216.Jan Bassett (1986) p273-4 Over the next few years, university fees were abolished and a national health care scheme established. Significant changes were made to school funding, something Whitlam regarded as \\"the most enduring single achievement\\" of his government.Gough Whitlam (1985) p.315 Divorce and family law was liberalised. Whitlam's radical and imperious style eventually alienated many voters, and some of the state governments were openly hostile to his government. As it did not control the senate, much of its legislation was rejected or amended. The Queensland Country Party government of Joh Bjelke-Petersen had particularly bad relations with the Federal government. Even after it was re-elected at elections in May 1974, the Senate remained an obstacle to its political agenda. At the only joint sitting of parliament, in August 1974, six keys pieces of legislation were passed. Government House, Canberra, also known as \\"Yarralumla\\". It was here that Sir John Kerr dismissed Gough Whitlam as Prime Minister of Australia on 11 November 1975 ‚Äî the culmination of the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis. In 1974, Whitlam selected John Kerr, a former member of the Labor Party and presiding Chief Justice of New South Wales to serve as Governor-General. The Whitlam Government was re-elected with a decreased majority in the lower house in the 1974 Election. In 1974‚Äì75 the government thought about borrowing US$4 billion in foreign loans. Minister Rex Connor conducted secret discussions with a loan broker from Pakistan, and the Treasurer, Jim Cairns, misled parliament over the issue. Arguing the government was incompetent following the Loans affair, the opposition Liberal- Country Party Coalition delayed passage of the government's money bills in the Senate, until the government would promise a new election. Whitlam refused, Malcolm Fraser, leader of the Opposition insisted. The deadlock came to an end when the Whitlam government was dismissed by the Governor-General, John Kerr on 11 November 1975 and Fraser was installed as caretaker Prime Minister, pending an election. The \\"reserve powers\\" granted to the Governor General by the Australian Constitution, had allowed an elected government to be dismissed without warning by a representative of the Monarch.There are numerous books on the Whitlam dismissal. For example, see Paul Kelly's November 1975: The Inside Story of Australia's Greatest Political Crisis. St Leonards, NSW: Allen & Unwin. . At elections held in late 1975, Malcolm Fraser and the Coalition were elected in a landslide victory. Malcolm Fraser and U.S. President Jimmy Carter (1977) The Fraser Government won two subsequent elections. Fraser maintained some of the social reforms of the Whitlam era, while seeking increased fiscal restraint. His government included the first Aboriginal federal parliamentarian, Neville Bonner, and in 1976, Parliament passed the Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976, which, while limited to the Northern Territory, affirmed \\"inalienable\\" freehold title to some traditional lands. Fraser established the multicultural broadcaster SBS, welcomed Vietnamese boat people refugees, opposed minority white rule in Apartheid South Africa and Rhodesia and opposed Soviet expansionism. A significant program of economic reform however was not pursued and, by 1983, the Australian economy was in recession, amidst the effects of a severe drought. Fraser had promoted \\"states‚Äô rights\\" and his government refused to use Commonwealth powers to stop the construction of the Franklin Dam in Tasmania in 1982. A Liberal minister, Don Chipp had split off from the party to form a new social liberal party, the Australian Democrats in 1977 and the Franklin Dam proposal contributed to the emergence of an influential Environmental movement in Australia, with branches including the Australian Greens, a political party which later emerged from Tasmania to pursue environmentalism as well as left-wing social and economic policies. 1980s and 1990s The new Parliament House in Canberra was opened in 1988. Bob Hawke, a less polarising Labor leader than Whitlam, defeated Fraser at the 1983 Election. The new government stopped the Franklin Dam project via the High Court of Australia. The 1980s saw severe concerns about Australia's future economic health take hold, with severe current account deficits and high unemployment at times. Hawke, together with treasurer Paul Keating undertook micro-economic and industrial relations reform designed to increase efficiency and competitiveness. After the initial failure of the Whitlam model and partial dismantling under Fraser, Hawke re-established a new, universal system of health insurance called Medicare. Hawke and Keating abandoned traditional Labor support for tariffs to protect industry and jobs. They moved to deregulate Australia's financial system and ‚Äòfloated‚Äô the Australian dollar. An agreement was reached with trade unions to moderate wage demands and accept more flexible working condition arrangements by accepting tax cuts in return. Ultimately, many of the reforms, continued by successive governments, appear to have been successful in pushing the economy along. The Australian Bicentenary was celebrated in 1988 along with the opening of a new Parliament House in Canberra. The following year the Australian Capital Territory achieved self-government and Jervis Bay became a separate territory administered by the Minister for Territories. A supporter of the US alliance, Hawke committed Australian naval forces to the Gulf War, following the 1990 invasion of Kuwait by Iraq. After four successful elections, but amid a deteriorating Australian economy and rising unemployment, the intense rivalry between Hawke and Keating led the Labor Party to replace Hawke as leader and Paul Keating became Prime Minister in 1991. Unemployment reached 11.4% in 1992 ‚Äì the highest since the Great Depression. The Liberal-National Opposition had proposed an ambitious plan of economic reform to take to the 1993 Election, including the introduction of a goods and services tax. Keating shuffled treasurers and campaigned strongly against the tax and won the 1993 Election. During his time in office, Keating emphasised links to the Asia Pacific region, co-operating closely with the Indonesian President, Suharto, and campaigned to increase the role of APEC as a major forum for economic co- operation. Keating was active in indigenous affairs and the High Court of Australia's historic Mabo decision in 1992 required a legislative response to recognition of Indigenous title to land, culminating in the Native Title Act 1993 and the Land Fund Act 1994. In 1993, Keating established a Republic Advisory Committee, to examine options for Australia becoming a republic. With foreign debt, interest rates and unemployment still high, and after a series of ministerial resignations, Keating lost the 1996 Election to the Liberals' John Howard. Full sovereignty from the United Kingdom The Australia Act 1986 led to the severing of nearly all constitutional ties between Australia and the UK. This was achieved by the passing of the which removed the right of the British Parliament to make laws for Australia and ended any British role in the government of the Australian States. It also removed the right of appeal from Australian courts to the British Privy Council in London. Most important, the Act transferred into Australian hands full control of all Australia's constitutional documents. Indigenous Australia Campaigns for indigenous rights in Australia have a long history. In the modern era, 1938 was an important year. With the participation of leading indigenous activists like Douglas Nicholls, the Australian Aborigines Advancement League organised a protest \\"Day of Mourning\\" to mark the 150th anniversary of the arrival of the First Fleet of British in Australia and launched its campaign for full citizenship rights for all Aborigines. In the 1940s, the conditions of life for Aborigines could be very poor. A permit system restricted movement and work opportunities for many Aboriginal people. In the 1950s, the government pursued a policy of \\"assimilation\\" which sought to achieve full citizenship rights for Aborigines but also wanted them to adopt the mode of life of other Australians (which very often was assumed to require suppression of cultural identity).The First Australians: A Fair Deal for a Dark Race par SBS TV 2008. Picture of Albert Namatjira at the Albert Namatjira Gallery, Alice Springs. Aboriginal art and artists became increasingly prominent in Australian cultural life during the second half of the 20th century. From left: Ian Thorpe, Cathy Freeman and Jeff McMullen were among some of the speakers at the Close the Gap launch in 2007. The campaign aims to achieve health equality between indigenous and non-indigenous Australia. Noel Pearson is an Aboriginal lawyer, rights activist and essayist. From the 1950s onwards, Australians began to rethink their attitudes towards racial issues. An Aboriginal rights movement was founded and supported by many liberal white Australians and a campaign against the White Australia policy was also launched. The 1967 referendum was held and overwhelmingly approved to amend the Constitution, removing discriminatory references and giving the national parliament the power to legislate specifically for Indigenous Australians. Contrary to frequently repeated mythology, this referendum did not cover citizenship on Aboriginal people, nor did it give them the vote: they already had both. However, transferring this power away from the State parliaments did bring an end to the system of Indigenous Australian reserves which existed in each state, which allowed Indigenous people to move more freely, and exercise many of their citizenship rights for the first time. From the late 1960s a movement for Indigenous land rights also developed. Various groups and individuals were active in the pursuit of equality and social justice from the 1960s. In the mid-1960s, one of the earliest Aboriginal graduates from the University of Sydney, Charles Perkins, helped organise freedom rides into parts of Australia to expose discrimination and inequality. In 1966, the Gurindji people of Wave Hill station (owned by the Vestey Group) commenced strike action led by Vincent Lingiari in a quest for equal pay and recognition of land rights.Geoffrey Bolton (1990) p.193 and 195 Indigenous Australians began to take up representation in Australian parliaments during the 1970s. In 1971 Neville Bonner of the Liberal Party was appointed by the Queensland Parliament to replace a retiring senator, becoming the first Aborigine in Federal Parliament. Bonner was returned as a Senator at the 1972 election and remained until 1983. Hyacinth Tungutalum of the Country Liberal Party in the Northern Territory and Eric Deeral of the National Party of Queensland, became the first Indigenous people elected to territory and state legislatures in 1974. In 1976, Sir Douglas Nicholls was appointed Governor of South Australia, becoming the first Aborigine to hold vice-regal office in Australia. Aiden Ridgway of the Australian Democrats served as a senator during the 1990s, but No indigenous person was elected to the House of Representatives, until West Australian Liberal Ken Wyatt, in August 2010. In 1984, a group of Pintupi people who were living a traditional hunter-gatherer desert-dwelling life were tracked down in the Gibson Desert in Western Australia and brought in to a settlement. They are believed to be the last uncontacted tribe in Australia. In 1985, the Hawke Government returned ownership of Uluru (formerly known as Ayers Rock) to the local Pitjantjatjara Aboriginal people. In 1992, the High Court of Australia handed down its decision in the Mabo Case, declaring the previous legal concept of terra nullius to be invalid. That same year, Prime Minister Paul Keating said in his Redfern Park Speech that European settlers were responsible for the difficulties Australian Aboriginal communities continued to face: ‚ÄòWe committed the murders. We took the children from their mothers. We practiced discrimination and exclusion. It was our ignorance and our prejudice‚Äô. In 1999 Parliament passed a Motion of Reconciliation drafted by Prime Minister John Howard and Aboriginal Senator Aden Ridgeway naming mistreatment of Indigenous Australians as the most \\"blemished chapter in our national history\\". A great many indigenous Australians have been prominent in sport and the arts. Several styles of Aboriginal art have developed in modern times, including the watercolour paintings of Albert Namatjira's Hermannsburg School, and the acrylic Papunya Tula \\"dot art\\" movement. The Western Desert Art Movement became a globally renowned 20th-century art movement. Oodgeroo Noonuccal (1920‚Äì1995) was a famous Aboriginal poet, writer and rights activist credited with publishing the first Aboriginal book of verse: We Are Going (1964). Sally Morgan's novel My Place was considered a breakthrough memoir in terms of bringing indigenous stories to wider notice. Leading Aboriginal intellectuals Marcia Langton (First Australians, 2008) and Noel Pearson (\\"Up From the Mission\\", 2009) are active contemporary contributors to Australian literature. 1955's Jedda, was the first Australian feature film to star Aboriginal actors in lead roles and the first to be entered at the Cannes Film Festival. 1976's The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith directed by Fred Schepisi was an award-winning historical drama from a book by Thomas Keneally about the tragic story of an Aboriginal Bushranger. The canon of films related to Indigenous Australians also increased over the period of the 1990s and early 21st century. In 2006, Rolf de Heer's Ten Canoes became the first major feature film to be shot in an indigenous language and the film was recognised at Cannes and elsewhere. In sport Evonne Goolagong Cawley became the world number-one ranked tennis player in 1971 and won 14 Grand Slam titles during her career. In 1973 Arthur Beetson became the first Indigenous Australian to captain his country in any sport when he first led the Australian National rugby league team, the Kangaroos. In 1982, Mark Ella became Captain of the Australian National rugby union team, the Wallabies. Olympic gold medalist Cathy Freeman lit the Olympic flame at the 2000 Summer Olympics opening ceremony in Sydney. In the early 21st century, much of indigenous Australia continued to suffer lower standards of health and education than non- indigenous Australia. In 2007, the Close the Gap campaign was launched by Olympic champions Cathy Freeman and Ian Thorpe with the aim of achieving Indigenous health equality within 25 years. In 2007, Prime Minister John Howard and Indigenous Affairs Minister Mal Brough launched the Northern Territory National Emergency Response. In response to the Little Children are Sacred Report into allegations of child abuse among indigenous communities in the Territory, the government banned alcohol in prescribed communities in the Northern Territory; quarantined a percentage of welfare payments for essential goods purchasing; despatched additional police and medical personnel to the region; and suspended the permit system for access to indigenous communities. During much of the twentieth century, Australian governments had removed many aboriginal children from their families. This practice did great damage to the Aboriginal people, culturally and emotionally, giving rise to the term stolen generation to describe these families. Since the publication in 1997 of a federal government report, Bringing Them Home all state governments have followed the recommendation of the report in issuing formal apologies for their past practices to the Aboriginal people, as have many local governments. The Howard government refused to make such an apology on behalf of the federal government, despite pleas from the Aboriginal people and from many sections of the wider community, saying that it implied intergenerational guilt on modern non-indigenous Australia. However, the new government under Kevin Rudd led a formal bi-partisan apology on 13 February 2008. Republicanism In the early 21st century, Australia remains a constitutional monarchy under the Australian Constitution adopted in 1901, with the duties of the monarch performed by a Governor-General selected by the Australian Government. Australian republicanism which had been a feature of the 1890s faded away during the First World War.Mark McKenna, Captive Republic: A History of Republicanism in Australia 1788‚Äì1996 (1997) Support for the Monarchy in Australia peaked during the Menzies years with the wildly successful 1954 tour by Queen Elizabeth II. Prince Charles attended school in Australia during the 1960s. The issue of a republic did not arise again until the 1970s. In the 1990s it was brought to the forefront of national debate by Prime Minister Paul Keating, who promised in 1993 to introduce an \\"Australian federal republic\\" by the centenary of Federation in 2001. The Howard Government called a Constitutional Convention to examine the issue in 1998. Delegates included appointees and elected representatives representing republicans, monarchists and neutral parties. The Convention proposed a republican model and a referendum was called for the approval of the Australian electorate. The referendum held on 6 November 1999 failed to achieve the support of either a majority of voters or a majority of states. The national vote of the electors in favour of Australia becoming a republic was 45.13%, with 54.87% against.http://www.michaelkirby.com.au/images/stories/speeches/2000s/vol46/2000/1670-Lessons_from_the_Republic_Referendum.pdf The Australian Labor Party advocated for the republic, while the Liberals permitted members to campaign for either side. Notable campaigners for the republic included all the living former Labor Prime Ministers and former Liberal Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser and incumbent Treasurer Peter Costello. Notable Monarchists included Prime Minister John Howard, Justice Michael Kirby of the High Court of Australia, former Labor opposition leader Bill Hayden and Liberal Aboriginal elder Neville Bonner. Future leaders of the Liberal Party Malcolm Turnbull who led the Australian Republic Movement and Tony Abbott who supported Australians for Constitutional Monarchy took opposing views. Justice Michael Kirby (a monarchist and leading figure in progressive Australian jurisprudence) ascribed the failure of the republic referendum to ten factors: lack of bi-partisanship; undue haste; a perception that the republic was supported by big city elites; a \\"denigration\\" of monarchists as \\"unpatriotic\\" by republicans; the adoption of an inflexible republican model by the Convention; concerns about the specific model proposed (chiefly the ease with which a Prime Minister could dismiss a president); a republican strategy of using big \\"names\\" attached to the Whitlam era to promote their cause; strong opposition to the proposal in the smaller states; a counter-productive pro- republican bias in the media; and an instinctive caution among the Australian electorate regarding Constitutional change. Some republicans blamed the conservative and monarchist Prime Minister John Howard (elected in 1996), whose leadership certainly did not aid the republican cause. But there were other significant factors, including a split between \\"minimalist\\" republicans who wanted an Australian president to be chosen by the federal Parliament (as happens in, for example, Germany), and more \\"radical\\" republicans who wanted a directly elected President, as in the Irish Republic. Public opinion suggested that a republic would only be acceptable if a president was directly elected. Since the referendum proposal was for an indirectly elected president, many radicals opposed it. The Gillard Labor Government which took power in a hung parliament following the 2010 Australian Election has indicated an intention not to revisit the issue of a vote for an Australian republic during the reign of Queen Elizabeth II, while the Opposition Liberal-National Coalition is led by Tony Abbott, a supporter of the constitutional monarchy. Cultural interest in the Royal Family endures, with 7 million Australians (one third of the population) tuning in to watch the Wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton in April 2011. In 2011, Australian public support for a republic fell to its lowest level since March 1994. Support for a republic outright was 41%, with support rising to 48 per cent of respondents in a scenario with Charles on the throne and his wife, Camilla, as princess consort. Military engagements in the late twentieth century Major General Peter Cosgrove (right) Australian commander of the United Nations backed peace keeping operation (INTERFET) to East Timor. Following the Vietnam War, Australian military forces were largely kept at home through the rest of the 1970s and 1980s, other than service in United Nations peacekeeping missions. RAAF helicopters operated in the Sinai; and Australian forces assisted in a British Commonwealth operation when Zimbabwe won its independence; as well as a similar operation in Namibia. Bob Hawke was Prime Minister at the time of the Fall of the Berlin Wall and end of the Cold War which ushered in a new era of international relations. Royal Australian Navy warships were deployed to the Gulf War by the Hawke Government in 1991 and remained in the region to enforce UN-imposed sanctions against Iraq. Peacekeeping Australian forces were very active in UN peacekeeping through the 1990s. In 1993, Foreign Minister Gareth Evans was active in the search for a settlement to ongoing troubles in Cambodia in the aftermath of the genocidal 1970s Pol Pot regime. Australia contributed the force commander and the operation's communications component to the UN operation. In the ultimately unsuccessful Somalia intervention, a battalion-level Australian contingent was employed to aid in the delivery of humanitarian aid in the Baidoa area. In 1994, Australia deployed medical staff to the UN force in Rwanda sent to deal with the aftermath of the Rwandan genocide. A UN Peacekeeping engagement in Bougainville began in 1997, to aid in resolving the long-running conflict between the Papua New Guinea government Bougainville separatists. There have been a number of other peacekeeping and stabilisation operations: notably in Bougainville, including Operation Bel Isi (1998‚Äì2003); as well as Operation Helpem Fren and the Australian led Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI) in the early 2000s; and the 2006 East Timorese crisis East Timor Australia led an important international military mission to East Timor in 1999. Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 and annexed the former Portuguese colony.by Irena Cristalis, East Timor: A Nation's Bitter Dawn (2009) Successive Australian governments, concerned to maintain good relations with Indonesia, had accepted Indonesia control of the territory, however the fall of Indonesian President Suharto and a shift in Australian policy by the Howard Government in 1998 precipitated a proposal for a referendum on the question of independence. New Indonesian President B. J. Habibie was prepared to consider a change of status for East Timor. In late 1998, Australian Prime Minister John Howard with Foreign Minister Alexander Downer drafted a letter Indonesia setting out a major change in Australian policy, suggesting that the East Timor be given a chance to vote on independence within a decade. The letter upset President Habibie, who saw it as implying Indonesia was a \\"colonial power\\" and he decided in response to announce a snap referendum. A UN sponsored referendum held in August 1999 showed overwhelming approval for independence. After the result was announced, violent clashes, instigated by a suspected anti-independence militia, sparked a humanitarian and security crisis in the region. John Howard consulted UN Secretary General Kofi Annan and lobbied U. S. President Bill Clinton to support an Australian led peace keeper force to end the violence. Australia, who contributed 5,500 personnel and the force commander, Major General Peter Cosgrove, to the UN-backed International Force East Timor and began deploying on 20 September 1999 and successfully restored order. The operation had been politically and militarily tense. Australia re-deployed frontline combat aircraft northward and detected an Indonesian submarine within the vicinity of Dili Harbour as INTERFET forces approached. While the intervention was ultimately successful, Australian-Indonesian relations would take several years to recover. al-Qaeda Australian and Afghan soldiers patrol the poppy fields in the Baluchi Valley Region, April 2010 In 1998, a wealthy dissident Saudi Islamist, Osama bin Laden, declared a fatwa calling for the killing of \\"Americans and their allies  civilians and military... in any country in which it is possible to do it\\" in order to bring to an end the ongoing enforcement of the sanctions against Iraq and presence of US troops in the Arabian Peninsula, thus bringing Australians into the line of fire in what would latterly grow to be defined as the War on Terror. Following the 11 September terrorist attacks by Al-Qaeda in 2001, On 14 September 2001, the Australian Government cited the terrorist attacks against the US as sufficient basis for invoking the mutual-defence clauses of the ANZUS Treaty. This was the first time the Treaty's clauses on acting to meet a common danger had been invoked since it was enacted in 1952.Australian involvement in AfghanistanThe Howard Government committed troops to the Afghanistan War (with bi- partisan support) and the Iraq War (meeting with the disapproval of other political parties). SAS troops formed the most high-profile part of Operation Slipper, Australia's contribution to the invading force in the 2001 United States war in Afghanistan. A small number of Australians, including David Hicks, were captured in and around the Afghan Theatre having spent time training or fighting with Al-Qaeda aligned Islamist paramilitaries. Islamists following the Al-Qaeda modus operandi bombed a nightclub in Bali in 2002 and killed 88 Australian civilians. The following year, the Iraq War was launched by a U.S.-British led coalition to overthrow the Saddam Hussein government of Iraq for its non-compliance with the 1991 Gulf War Peace Treaty. Australian contribution to the 2003 invasion of Iraq lasted until 2009 and was highly controversial. Following the death of Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden at the hands of US forces in May 2011, Prime Minister Julia Gillard announced that Australian forces would remain in Afghanistan and said that Bin Laden's death offered a \\"small measure of justice\\" to the families of the 105 Australians who been killed in Al-Qaeda attacks in New York, Bali, London and Mumbai since the commencement of the conflict.War against terrorism not over: Gillard - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) As of May 2011, a further 24 Australian military personnel had been killed while serving in the Afghanistan conflict (including one with the British Armed Forces). Turn of the century Olympic colours on the Sydney Harbour Bridge in 2000 World leaders with Prime Minister John Howard in Sydney for the 2007 APEC conference Julia Gillard (left) and Kevin Rudd deliver their first press conference as leaders of the Australian Labor Party, 4 December 2006. Rudd won the 2007 election and was replaced by Gillard in 2010. John Howard served as Prime Minister from 1996 until 2007, the second-longest prime ministerial term after Robert Menzies. One of the first programs instigated by the Howard Government was a nationwide gun control scheme, following a mass shooting at Port Arthur. The government sought to reduce Australia's government deficit and introduced industrial relations reforms, particularly as regards efficiency on the waterfront. After the 1996 election, Howard and treasurer Peter Costello proposed a goods and services tax (GST) which they successfully took to the electorate in 1998. In 1999, Australia led a United Nations force into East Timor to help establish democracy and independence for that nation, following political violence. The government also accelerated the pace of privatisation, beginning with the government-owned telecommunications corporation, Telstra. Howard's government continued some elements of the foreign policy of its predecessors, based on relations with four key countries: the United States, Japan, China, and Indonesia. The Howard administration strongly supported US engagement in the Asia-Pacific region. Australia hosted the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney to great international acclaim. The Opening Ceremony featured a host of iconic Australian imagery and history and the flame ceremony honoured women athletes, including swimmer Dawn Fraser, with Aboriginal runner Cathy Freeman lit the Olympic flame.

He is an area manager for Permanent TSB and has recently been a political candidate for Fianna F√°il in the constituency of Dublin North. O'Leary has a biography of his sporting career with Dublin (co-written with Martin Breheny and published by Blackwater Press in 1997), entitled Back To The Hill. Playing career His inter-county began with Dublin in 1978, where he was a member of the panel that won the 1978 Leinster Minor Football Championship and were beaten in the All-Ireland Minor Football Championship final to Mayo. He had only appeared as a substitute for Dublin in 1978 and he became the first choice goalkeeper for Dublin in 1979. This proved to be a successful year for him, as he went on to claim his second Leinster minor medal and his first all-Ireland minor medal with Dublin. O'Leary made his championship debut for Dublin in 1980 against Offaly in the Leinster championship final. Dublin lost the game at Croke Park by 1-10 to 1-8 with O'Leary his first goal in a Dublin shirt against Offaly with a Matt Connor goal in front of a packed crowd of 50,276. This proved to be Dublins first loss in the Leinster championship since losing to Louth in 1973. This proved a less than satisfactory debut but 1980 also brought success to the O'Dwyer's man. He won his first and only Leinster U21 Football Championship in 1980 only to be defeated in the final to Cork. 1981 proved to be another unsuccessful year for O'Leary with Dublin being knocked out of the Leinster Senior Football Championship to Laois by 2-09 to 0-11 in Tullamore. O'Leary conceded two goals in the game to Tom Prendergast (penalty) and John Costello. In the previous round of the Leinster championship O'Leary made an amazing save from Wicklows Pat O'Byrne which proved the difference between the sides. He received the save of the season award for the save. 1982 proved to be another unsuccessful year in the blue jersey, with Dublin losing out to Offaly in a repeat of the 1980 Leinster final. O'Leary won his first All- Ireland Senior Football Championship with Dublin in 1983. He got to exact his revenge on Offaly in the Leinster final by defeating them by 2-13 to 1-11. Matt O'Connor managed to repeat his goal scoring against O'Leary but it was enough to stop Dublin at Croke Park. Dublin went on to play Cork in the semi final at Croke Park which finished on 2-11 a-piece. The replay proved to be a more one-sided affair, with Dublin winning the game by 4-15 to 2-10 at a packed (43,433) P√°irc U√≠ Chaoimh. O'Leary then played in his first all-Ireland final at Croke Park in front of a crowd of 71,988. Dublin defeated Galway by 1-10 to 1-08 with O'Leary claiming his first all-Ireland senior medal. After a very successful 1983, a lot was expected of the Dublin senior football team in 1984. O'Leary won the Leinster Senior Football Championship with a memorable win over rivals Meath in the final. O'Leary pulled off an amazing save against Wexford in the previous round which resulted in him receiving the save of the season award. After the Leinster final, Dublin met Tyrone in the semi final. This game proved controversial as the Tyrone side tried to have their pre- match kickaround in front of Hill 16 where Dublin traditionally warm up before games at Croke Park. These attempts to unsettle the Dublin side were in vain as Dublin proved eventual winners by 2-11 to 0-8. The final in Croke Park against Kerry proved to be Dublins first championship loss in over two years. Despite a clean sheet by O'Leary in the game, Dublin lost by 0-14 to 1-06. O'Leary was awarded his first All Stars Award for Dublin and was also called up to the Ireland Compromise rules side for the first time. In 1986 O'Leary won his first Railway Cup medal for Leinster as captain. In the championship Dublin were knocked out by rivals Meath in the final for the first time since 1964. O'Leary who was the Dublin captain in 1986, had managed to keep a clean sheet for the game but it wasn't enough to stop a 0-09 to 0-07 win over Dublin. In 1986 he toured with the Ireland compromise rules team in Australia. By 1987, he returned to winning medals for Dublin by claiming his first ever National Football League medal with a memorable 1-11 to 0-11 win over rivals Kerry. Despite this sign of pre-championship form, Dublin lost out to bitter rivals Meath in their second consecutive Leinster final in Croke Park in July 1987. Meath won the game by 1-13 to 0-12 with Mattie McCabe scoring the goal against O'Leary. O'Leary captained the 1987 Ireland compromise rules team against Australia. 1988 was a disappointing year for Dublin and O'Leary, his side failed to retain their NFL title by losing in the final with a replay against Meath in a game that finished at 2-13 to 0-11. Dublin were knocked out of the Leinster championship by Meath during the same year and Dublins intense rivalry with Meath would continue to grow. The Leinster championship was returned to Dublin in 1989 with O'Leary exacting revenge against Meath for the NFL loss. Dublin won the Leinster final by 2-12 to 1-10 in Croke Park with Mattie McCabe scoring the goal against O'Leary once again. Dublin were then knocked out in the semifinal of the all-Ireland by Cork despite an early lead of 1-04 to 0-00. The game finished on a scoreline of 2-10 to 1-09. Dublin had a comfortable win over Louth in their opening game in the 1990 Leinster Senior Football Championship with a 1-13 to 1-08 win in Drogheda. Dublin faced Wicklow in the semi final and O'Leary claimed another clean sheet in Dublins 2-14 to 0-12 win. The Leinster final once again featured what was becoming the fiercest of rivalries between Dublin and their neighbours Meath. Dublin failed to retain their title and lost the game by a Colm O'Rourke goal, the game finished on a scoreline of 0-14 to 1-14. 1991 was to prove to be one of the most interesting years in the career of Dublin goalkeeper O'Leary. The year began with an NFL final win over Kildare by 1-09 to 0-10. After the NFL win, a lot was expected of Dublin for 1991. Dublin were drawn against their neighbours and rivals Meath in the first round. This was a worry for the Leinster council who were in financial trouble and this tie saw the possibility of Dublin going out in the first round with seasons worth of ticket sales over in one game. Dublin had been noted for their large attendances at championship games and a loss for Dublin would mean a loss of earnings for the Leinster council who were considering closing their headquarters due to financial difficulties. The opening game against Meath finished on a draw which proved great news for the Leinster council as the first game had an attendance of 51,144 and more would be expected for a replay. The game finished on a scoreline of 1-12 to 1-12 with Brian Stafford scoring the goal against O'Leary. The second game which had an attendance of 60,960 finished on a scoreline of 0-10 a-piece after 70 minutes and the game was forced into extra time. In extra-time David Beggy managed to beat O'Leary to score a goal but it proved irrelevant as Jack Sheedy scored a goal for Dublin and the game finished on all level at 1-11 a-piece. The third game had the highest attendance in the series with 63,730 packing Croke Park. The game also finished all-level after 70 minutes at 0-10 to 1-07 with Bernie Flynn scoring the goal. The game went into extra-time and finished at 1-14 to 2-11 with Colm Coyle scoring the goal for Meath. Once again a replay was needed to decide the outcome of the game. The GAA was losing popularity in Ireland at the time especially after the successes of the Ireland soccer team at the FIFA world cup in Italy and this series of draws would prove a great success story to revive the fortunes of the GAA. The final game in the series finished with Meath winning by a scoreline of 2-10 to 0-15. The game had an attendance of 60,543 and proved yet another dramatic game. In the dying minutes of the game, Dublin were winning the game by three points despite Dublin's Keith Barr missing a penalty. This win was turned in a matter of minutes with Kevin Foley scoring the equalising goal against O'Leary and the game finished with a spectacular point by David Beggy of Meath. Meath went on to retain the 1991 Leinster Senior Football Championship and were defeated by Down in the final and the first round game against Dublin was often given as a reason for Meath for the all-Ireland loss due to fatigue. 1992 saw Dublin's return to Leinster glory with O'Leary winning his fifth medal. It would have been fitting for a Dublin Meath final once again but Meath had been defeated in the first round by Laois. Dublin defeated Kildare in the final by 1-13 to 0-10 with a clean sheet by O'Leary. Once again, like the Kerry game a few years before, O'Leary maintained a clean sheet in the final but it failed to materialise as a win with Donegal finishing the game on a high scoreline of 0-18 to 0-14. O'Leary was appointed as captain of the Dublin senior football panel in 1993. He became by captaining Dublin to NFL glory against with revenge over the previous years all-Ireland winners Donegal in the final. Dublin then went on to claim the Leinster title with a win over Kildare in the final. Dublin had previously beaten Meath in the semi final by 1-10 to 0-12. After a semi final win over Munster champions Clare Dublin went on to be defeated by Ulster opposition for the second year in a row. Derry defeated O'Leary's Dublin by 0-15 to 0-14 at Croke Park in the semi final much to O'Learys disappointment after having successfully maintained five clean sheets in a row. This series of performances earned him his third all-star award. In 1994 O'Leary continued as Dublin captain and claimed his second Leinster title in that role. This proved another clean sheet for him in a national final. Dublin then went on to retain their Leinster title by defeating Meath once again in the final. Dublin won by 1-09 to 1-08 in a close game with O'Leary conceding the goal to Graham Geraghty of Meath. After a semi final win over Connacht champions Leitrim Dublin went on to be defeated by Ulster opposition for the third year in a row. Dublin played Down in the final in a game that finished on 1-12 to 0-13 in Croke Park. 1995 was to prove another personal milestone in the football career of O'Leary. Dublin easily beat Meath in the Leinster final by 1-18 to 1-08 which paved the way for a semi final showdown with Cork. A clean sheet for O'Leary in the semi final gave Dublin the win over Cork with great performance by Mick Galvin and Jason Sherlock. Dublin finally managed to beat Ulster opposition in the all-Ireland phase of the championship by beating Tyrone by 1-10 to 0-12. This was Dublin and O'Learys first all-Ireland since 1983 and being captain made it all the more special for him. He was then awarded his fifth and final all-star award for his performance with Dublin, most notably clean sheets in the semi-final and the final at Croke Park. 1996 was a much quieter year for O'Leary, the two in a row dream died in Croke Park during the Leinster final. It was typical of the history between the sides that Meath recovered from 1995's huge loss to beat the Dubs by 0-10 to 0-08. The following year Dublin met Meath in the first round of the championship and were beaten by 1-13 to 1-10 with Paul Bealin missing a penalty in the dying minutes of the game. O'Leary retired after the Meath game, after having played an incredible 70 consecutive championship matches in the championship between 1980 and 1997.His record of 70 consecutive appearances hasn't been replicated by any other GAA player let alone a Dublin player. In his impressive inter- county career he appeared in Croke Park on 47 occasions. Mattie McCabe of Meath was the most successful player against O'Leary, scoring a total of three goals. He conceded just 51 goals in his 70-game championship career for Dublin. Management career He re-entered the Inter County scene as a Dublin team selector to Tommy Carr. When Carr lost his position as Dublin manager O'Leary took charge of his mother's native county Wicklow as the new senior football manager and later went on to manage 2004. O'Leary is a part of the 2012 coaching team with Louth, he trains the Louth goalkeepers and backs. Political career In November 2006, it was announced that he would contest the 2007 general election on behalf of Fianna F√°il in the Dublin North constituency in place of retiring TD Jim Glennon. At the 2007 general election, O'Leary was unsuccessful in his bid for a D√°il seat. He received 5,074 first preference votes giving him a 9.3% of the vote during his first election campaign. His two running mates Michael Kennedy and Darragh O'Brien were elected with help from O'Leary's transfer. Other 'celebrity' candidates, such as Graham Geraghty and Colm O'Gorman, were also unsuccessful.

He died suddenly at age 34, after only two of his five books had been published. He was the first U.S.-born winner of the annual Newbery Medal, recognizing his third novel The Dark Frigate (1923) as the year's best American children's book. Reviewing the Hawes Memorial Prize Contest in 1925, The New York Times observed that \\"his adventure stories of the sea caused him to be compared with Stevenson, Dana and Melville\\".  Life  Hawes was the elder son of Charles Taylor Hawes and Martha Tibbetts Boardman. Born in Clifton Springs, New York, he was raised in Bangor, Maine, and graduated from Bowdoin College in 1911 where he was \\"editor of The Quill and a devoted student of the classics\\". He was a graduate student at Harvard for one year, on the staff of The Youth's Companion to 1920, and associate editor of The Open Road to his death in 1923. On June 1, 1916, Hawes married Dorothea Cable of Northampton, Massachusetts, the youngest daughter of the novelist George Washington Cable and Louise Stewart Bartlett. At that time he lived in Cambridge and worked for The Youth's Companion. Hawes' first book was an adventure novel published by Atlantic Monthly Press and Little, Brown and Company in 1920: The Mutineers: a tale of old days at sea and of adventures in the Far East as Benjamin Lathrop set it down some sixty years ago. His second book, The Great Quest: a romance of 1826 [...] was first runner-up for the inaugural Newbery Medal in 1922, the first American award for children's books. Hawes died suddenly of pneumonic meningitis in Springfield, Massachusetts, on July 16, 1923, two days before the publication of Gloucester, by Land and Sea, a 226-page mainly historical book about his chosen home city of Gloucester, Massachusetts. He was survived by his wife and two sons. He had recently delivered the completed manuscript of The Dark Frigate: wherein is told the story of Philip Marsham [...], a 17th-century adventure set in England and Barbados as well as at sea. It was published by Atlantic in October and was a Boston Globe fiction best-seller that fall.Boston Daily Globe. October 27 and December 29, 1923. The children's librarians voted him \\"author of the most distinguished contribution to American literature for children\\", winner of the third annual Newbery Medal and the first for a writer born in the U.S. Hawes dedicated The Dark Frigate to his father-in-law G. W. Cable and his widow received the Newbery Medal at the American Library Association conference next summer. The Atlanta Constitution remarked, \\"Mr. Hawes' great gift was the ability to write sea stories ... His literary skill in capturing the style and atmosphere of the eighteenth century gained him many adult admirers ... The loss of Mr. Hawes is irreparable. But it is to be hoped that this posthumous recognition may stimulate others to perpetuate the standard he has created.\\" In 1962 The Dark Frigate was named to the Lewis Carroll Shelf Award list. Two articles by Hawes were posthumously published in The Atlantic Monthly. His wife completed one more book, Whaling, published in 1924. One review of the 358-page history highlighted the remark by Hawes, \\"Time has given the business a glamour that would astound the luckless victims of its reality\\".  Hawes Memorial Prize Contest  In September 1923, Atlantic Monthly Press opened a contest with $2000 prize, plus royalties, for \\"an adventure story of not less than 60,000 words, of the characters and excellence of the works of the late Charles Boardman Hawes\\" (quoting a newspaper) The winner was a novel by Clifford MacClellan Sublette, The Scarlet Cockerel (March 1925). His research before writing concerned \\"the French‚ÄìSpanish difficulties in Florida\\". Sublette was \\"an agricultural field worker in the summer\\" who had toured the American West and written adventure short stories.

Its ancient name was Pava where Lord Buddha took his last meal. It is the place where Lord Rama spent a few days of his life. After passing from Padrauna, Lord Rama reached at Ramkola where he made a hut with his wife Sita and younger brother Lakshman to stay. Padrauna is also the place of ancient Malla Kshatriyas who were following a democratic form of government from their Santhagara.It is situated 21 kilometers east of Kushinagar town. Connectivity The town is connected to many important cities through National Highway 28B and State Highway No. 64. One of the Shatabdi bus daily runs from Padrauna to Kanpur. Also, Janrath bus connects Padrauna to Lucknow. Padrauna Railway Station is on a broad gauge railway that connects to major cities of the country. Currently, trains run for cities like Chhapra, Gorakhpur, Lucknow, Siddharthnagar, Delhi, Katihar, Jalandar, Delhi and other important cities. It is expected to be a part of the proposed Kushinagar International Airport. The proposed Buddha Expressway between Kushinagar and Sarnath will provide connectivity with south eastern cities in the state like Varanasi, Allahabad, Azamgarh as well as Kolkata through National Highway 2 in Varanasi. Economy The economy of Padrauna mainly consists of Agriculture followed by Services and a little contribution is made by Industrial sector. There are many family run businesses, shops, vendors, hawkers, etc., in Padrauna. A number of small and mid-size hotels exist in Padrauna. Earlier there were few industries (Cawnpore Sugar Works, sugar factory for example) which are no more operational. The shutting down of factories led to poverty and backwardness of this region. The backwardness is further soared by the power shortage in this region. Landmarks and geography Sugar Factory in dis use Notable landmarks are: Subhash Chowk, Tilak Chowk, Ambay Chowk, Chawani, Ravindra Nagar, Nahar, Rajdarbar, Gudaribajar, Lajpat Nagar, Durgamandir, Jataharoad, Belawan chungi, Bawali Chowk Sugar Factory etc.Though Padrauna is a district headquarter yet almost all the offices like Kutchery, Vikas Bhavan, Income Tax Office, Collectorate, District Hospital etc. are situated in Ravindra Nagar Dhoos. It lies in the Great Plains and is Terai area, very close to piedmont plains of Himalayas, and is very close to borders of Nepal and Bihar. It is located on the bank of river Bansi, a Ganges tributary originating in Nepal. The town presents characteristics distinct from natural features of the western districts of Uttar Pradesh. This difference is due primarily to the relative proximity of the Himalayas, the outermost foothills of which are only a few kilometres from the northern borders. The peak of Dhaulagiri, some 8,230 meters above sea-level, is visible under favourable climatic conditions as far south as Padrauna itself. Below the outer hills is a dry boulder-strewn tract, corresponding to the Bhabar of Kumaun and Garhwal and here the bulk of the moisture contributed by the rainfall and the small streams is absorbed by the soil, to reappear through seepage in the damp and unhealthy tract, known as the terai. The climate is extreme temperate climate, with soaring temperatures in summer crossing 40 degrees and in winters temperatures as low as 3 to 4 degrees. There are a number of cinemas and malls and supermarkets in Kanhaiya Takij, Krishna Takij, Sahu Palace, Padrauna such as Unik Bazar, V2, Super Market, City Cart, and V Mart. A city mall has also been proposed. It is currently under construction.

It is used to prevent the horse from lowering its head beyond a fixed point. A variation called a side check passes beside the ears through loops at the top of the bridle cheekpieces. It can be attached to the surcingle of a horse harness, or to the harness saddle. An overcheck or bearing rein shares some function with side reins, draw reins, and the de Gogue, and has the opposite function to a chambon and martingale. It can be attached to the same bit as the reins, or to a second, separate bit. Use Head shot of an overcheck on a harness racing horse, with separate bit The modern overcheck is often a necessary piece of safety equipment for certain types of harness and is an aid to the driver in keeping a horse's head properly positioned. An overcheck has a practical purpose; if a horse lowers its head too far when in harness, particularly if moving quickly, it can catch the bridle on the shafts of the carriage or wagon, risking an accident. Properly adjusted and when used for a limited period of time, an overcheck does not significantly impede the motion of the horse or cause discomfort. If too tight, however, an overcheck rein can be uncomfortable because it puts strain on the neck muscles and ligaments. On a hard-working draft horse, it generally is not used at all, as it puts the animal off balance by preventing it from lowering its head when trying to pull significant weight. A horse pulling weight normally lowers and extends its neck in order to distribute the load. If an overcheck is inappropriately used, or used for too long a period, spinal strain resulting in neck or back injury can occur. An overcheck used on a harness racing horse. The overcheck is also used today in some equestrian riding activities, and for certain types of horse training. In particular, it is used on certain saddle seat horses while on the longe line as part of a bitting rig that assists the horse in learning the proper high set head position for competition that also emphasizes high knee action. While not normally used by a rider in the saddle, it is common in some places to put an overcheck on ponies when being ridden by very young riders in order to prevent the pony from putting its head down and grazing while being ridden, an act of disobedience that a small child often lacks the physical strength to prevent. The overcheck is generally not used to train dressage horses, because it can lead to the horse traveling with a hollow frame, the opposite of the rounded frame encouraged in dressage. A device that looks similar, the chambon, is sometimes used in training of dressage horses. However, the chambon encourages the horse to lower, not raise, its head. The Gogue is a related training tool. History In the 18th and 19th centuries, the overcheck, then called a \\"bearing rein,\\" was commonly used on stylish carriage horses to keep their heads up, at times to an extreme degree, depending on the fashion of various periods. Today it is used primarily for horse show or exhibition use, particularly in the schooling and showing of fine harness horses and certain types of carriage horses. Historically, improper use and overuse created chronic problems with the spine and back that in some cases made certain horses useless as working animals. The fashion extremes of the 18th and 19th centuries at times tightened a bearing rein to the degree that it made breathing difficult. This is highlighted in the novel Black Beauty by Anna Sewell, and in the years after the book's release the reins became less popular and fell out of favor. The \\"Anti-Bearing Rein Association\\" was formed to try and stop the practice of using such reins.The Times March 1, 1906 About that time, the cause was also taken up by the Canadian Society of Cruelty to Animals.Edmonton Bulletin, March 12, 1907, p. 11 The term bearing rein is derived from the definition of \\"bearing\\" which means \\"the manner in which one bears or conducts one's self; mien; behavior; carriage.\\" The reference suggested that high head carriage was a sign of nobility or pride. However, 19th century critics of the bearing rein applied a pejorative meaning to the word, meaning \\"patient endurance; suffering without complaint\\". Modern harness trainers prefer the more accurate terminology \\"overcheck\\" and \\"check rein\\". Related equipment Related types of checkrein often used in conjunction with an overcheck are side reins, a pair of reins which run simply from the bit to a surcingle or saddle, intended to keep the horse's head tucked in. Side reins are a very common training tool for working horses on the longe, also considered standard safety equipment in the sport of equestrian vaulting, but rarely if ever are used by a mounted rider.

In addition to writing popular children's stories, she ran her husband Daniel Lothrop's publishing company after his death. After they bought The Wayside country house, they worked hard to make it a center of literary life.The National Cyclopaedia of American Biography, Vol 8 (1898) James T. White & Co., New York. Biography Harriett Mulford Stone was born in New Haven, Connecticut, in 1844. The daughter of New Haven architect, Sidney Mason Stone, she was ‚Äúbrought up in an atmosphere of culture and learning enhanced by free access to her father‚Äôs large library.‚ÄùJames, Edward T., et al.

From early girlhood she ‚Äúdelighted in creating imaginary people‚Äù.Lothrop, Margaret M., The Wayside: Home of Authors, American Book Company, New York, 1940, unpaged. She was educated at seminaries near her home and graduated from Miss Dutton's School at Grove Hall in New Haven in 1862.Miss Dutton‚Äôs School at Grove Hall, List of Teachers and Pupils 1847‚Äì1863, on file at the New Haven Colony Historical Society Library. While a student there ‚Äúshe displayed such mental alertness, combined with retentive memory and a great imaginative and poetic talent that she was marked for future success.‚ÄùHartford Courant, April 6, 1924, p. 3D. She traveled extensively in the United States, and began creating literary compositions early in life. According to a Hartford Courant article, \\"she wrote constantly but destroyed manuscripts\\". She published nothing until 1878 when, at the age of 34, she began sending short stories to Wide Awake, a children's magazine in Boston. Two of her stories, \\"Polly Pepper's Chicken Pie\\" and \\"Phronsie Pepper's New Shoes\\", proved to be very popular with readers. Ella Farman, the editor of the magazine, requested that Stone write more. The success of Harriett's short stories prompted her to write Five Little Peppers and its 11 sequels. The original novel was first published in 1881, the year that Stone married Daniel Lothrop. Daniel had founded the D. Lothrop Company of Boston, who published Harriett's books under her pseudonym, Margaret Sidney. Harriett and Daniel may have both had an interest in history and in famous authors. In 1883, they purchased the house in which both Louisa May Alcott and Nathaniel Hawthorne had lived. Nicknamed The Wayside, the house is located in Concord, Massachusetts. The year after Harriett and Daniel moved into the house, Harriett gave birth to their daughter, Margaret, at the age of 40. Daniel Lothrop died on March 18, 1892, when Harriett was 48 and their daughter was just 9 years old. There was a gap in the release of the Five Little Peppers books from 1892 to 1897, while Harriett continued to run the publishing company Daniel founded. Eventually, she sold the company, which later became Lothrop, Lee & Shepard Co. It continued to publish Harriett's books under the name Margaret Sidney when Harriett resumed writing the Five Little Peppers series. She died at the age of 80. Children of the American Revolution Lothrop is known as the founder of the Children of the American Revolution. She first proposed the idea at the 4th Continental Congress of the Daughters of the American Revolution on February 22, 1895. The organization was soon chartered and was officially founded on April 5, 1895. Her intention was \\"for the training of young people in true patriotism and love of country\\". Lothrop was the lifeblood of this organization, she served as the first Senior National President from 1895-1901 and her daughter Margaret was \\"Member #1\\". Other interests Lothrop circa 1900 Harriett was an early member of the Massachusetts Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR). In 1891, only one year after the founding of the DAR, she was the founder and first regent (president) of the newly formed Old Concord Chapter of the DAR in Concord. She loved traveling overseas, but spent many winters in California where the climate was more agreeable. Alongside her writing career, Stone had a deep interest in historical homes and buildings and worked hard to preserve them. These include: * The Wayside, where she lived with her family * Orchard House, which belonged to the Alcott family and was next door to the Wayside * Grapevine Cottage, where Ephraim Wales Bull developed the Concord grape * The Tolman House in Dorchester, Massachusetts built during the colonial period In later years, Stone's daughter Margaret Lothrop championed to have her childhood home, The Wayside, declared a National Historic Landmark. It was made so in 1963.

Born Eustochium Julia at Rome, she was the daughter of Paula and is also venerated as a saint and was an early Desert Mother. She was the third of four daughters of the Roman Senator Toxotius, for whom Jerome made a lot of fanciful claims of ancestry.According to Jerome, Toxotius was believed to belong to the noble Julian race, while St. Paula traced her ancestry through the Scipios and the Gracchi (Jerome, Epistle cxviii). Modern genealogists don't buy into these claims. After the death of her husband around 380 Paula and her daughter Eustochium lived in Rome as austere a life as the fathers of the desert. Eustochium had three sisters, Blaesilla, Paulina, and Rufina, and a brother, Toxotius.\\"Saints Paula and Eustochium\\", Christian Iconography When Jerome came to Rome from Palestine in 382, they put themselves under his spiritual guidance. Hymettius, an uncle of Eustochium, and his wife Praetextata tried to persuade the youthful Eustochium to give up her austere life and enjoy the pleasures of the world, but all their attempts were futile. About the year 384 she made a vow of perpetual virginity, on which occasion Jerome addressed to her his celebrated letter De custodia virginitatis (Ep. xxii in P.L., XXII, 394‚Äì425). A year later Jerome returned to Palestine and soon after was followed to the Orient by Paula and Eustochium. In 386 they accompanied Jerome on his journey to Egypt, where they visited the hermits of the Nitrian Desert in order to study and afterward imitate their mode of life. In the fall of the same year they returned to Palestine and settled permanently at Bethlehem. Paula and Eustochium at once began to erect four monasteries and a hospice near the spot where Christ was born. While the erection of the monasteries was in process (386‚Äì9) they lived in a small building in the neighbourhood. One of the monasteries was occupied by monks and put under the direction of Jerome. The three other monasteries were taken by Paula and Eustochium and the numerous virgins that flocked around them. The three convents, which were under the supervision of Paula, had only one oratory, where all the virgins met several times daily for prayer and the liturgy of the hours. Jerome testifies (Ep. 308) that Eustochium and Paula performed the most menial services. Much of their time they spent in the study of Holy Scripture under the direction of Jerome. Eustochium spoke Latin and Classical Greek with equal ease and was able to read the scriptures in the Hebrew text. Many of Jerome's Biblical commentaries owe their existence to her influence and to her he dedicated his commentaries on the prophets Isaias and Ezekiel. The letters which Jerome wrote for her instruction and spiritual advancement are, according to his own testimony,De Viris Illustribus, cap. cxxxv. very numerous. After the death of Paula in 404, Eustochium assumed the direction of the nunneries. Her task was a difficult one on account of the impoverished condition of the temporal affairs which was brought about by the lavish almsgiving of Paula. Jerome was of great assistance to her by his encouragement and prudent advice. In 417, a crowd of ruffians attacked and pillaged the monasteries of Bethlehem, destroyed one of them by fire, besides killing and maltreating some of the residents. It is alleged that this was instigated by John II, the Patriarch of Jerusalem and the Pelagians against whom Jerome had written what were considered sharp polemics. Both Jerome and Eustochium informed Pope Innocent I by letter of the occurrence, who severely reproved the patriarch for having permitted the outrage.

This indicated that they were troops attached directly to First Canadian Army.Soldiers of the 5th Medium Regiment of the Royal Canadian Artillery during the Second World War The 5th Medium Regiment, Royal Canadian Artillery, was one of six Canadian medium regiments that saw service in Britain and continental Europe in the Second World War, the others being the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 7th Medium Regiments. (There was no 6th Medium.) The 5th Medium Regiment was formed in England from two non-permanent batteries, namely the 7th Medium Battery (Montreal, Quebec) and the 23rd Medium Battery (Toronto, Ontario), on 22 September 1941. The regiment at this time was temporarily placed under the command of Major A. Bruce Matthews, who subsequently was promoted to Lt. Colonel. Prior to the creation of the 5th Medium Regiment, the 7th Medium Battery had been paired with the 2nd Medium Battery (Charlottetown, PEI) of the 1st Medium Regiment RCA. Similarly, the 23rd Medium Battery also belonged to the 1st Medium Regiment RCA and had been paired with the 3rd Medium Battery (Kingston, Ontario). It was not uncommon for members of each Battery to identify themselves by geographic location instead of by Battery number (e.g., as an Islander if 2nd Battery, or from Kingston, if 3rd Battery). Throughout the war there was always a friendly rivalry between these Medium batteries. After the completion of the regiment's formation in England, in a manner of questionable legality, the 5th Medium became the first fully armed medium regiment in the UK. Paraphrased from the 5th Medium unpublished diary: in an \\"alcoholic orgy of bargaining,\\" two Battery captains, Reiner and Hogarth, 'bought' eight new 5.5 inch guns from an officer in charge of the supply gun park for the bargain price of 300 cigarettes. All the guns arrived by the end of September 1941 making the 5th Medium the first regiment to be fully outfitted with armaments. Similarly, Lt. General AGL McNaughton was interested in conducting user trials of this new weapon. The 5th Medium conducted the user trials of the new artillery piece in January 1942 at Larkhill, England. By October 1942, Lt. Colonel Matthews left the unit and was replaced by Lt Colonel Suttie. In this time before Christmas, the 5th Medium conducted a live fire demonstration for Lt. General AGL McNaughton and continued further training at Sennybridge. After two lively Christmas parties, the 5th Medium settled down for more training in the New Year. At 0830 on 24 October 1943, Major Reiner informed the regiment of their anticipated movement towards a theater of action. The 23rd Battery, along with the Regimental HQ and the Signals section entrained at Leatherhead Station, while the rest of the 7th Battery at Woking station bound for Glasgow. According to the official orders outlining the operation (Code named \\"Timberwolf\\"), it was stated that all \\"units will be on 12.00 notice to entrain, from 0001 21 October 1943.\\" On the afternoon of 26 October 1943 the 5th Medium boarded the Dutch liner, Sloterdijk (or Sloterdyk) in Glasgow along with elements of the 5th Canadian Armoured Division, HQ 1st AGRA, 2nd Medium RCA, and 11th Field Regiment RCA. On the evening of the 27th, the ship set sail in its convey in a northerly direction. The troop ship continued into the North Atlantic causing a great deal of sea sickness. By estimates, it was documented that the waves and swells were 15-20+ feet in height. To keep the men occupied, pamphlets were given out detailing hygiene in tropical countries and notes for troops heading to North Africa. The convey traveled unmolested by aircraft or U-boat attack through the Atlantic and reached the straits of Gibraltar early in the evening of 4 November 1943. On 6 November 1943, at 18:07, while north of Philippevile, North Africa (now known as Skikda), the men had just completed a treasure hunt for 100 playing cards hidden throughout the ship when the convey was attacked by German aircraft. The predetermined Bren gun defenses were effective at creating a wall of tracers around the ship. The convey shot down two bombers and the all clear was called at 20:00. The only casualty aboard the Sloterdijk was an American sailor who was shot (by accident) in the leg by Grn Greenshields. Later, it was found that No. 14 Hospital Ship had been damaged and disabled in the attack, and two other ships were lost, none carrying Canadians. The No. 14 Hospital Ship was towed towards Philippevile but sunk en route without loss of life on board. By 8 November 1943, the Sloterdijk docked outside of Palermo Harbour, Sicily at 02:10. An advanced party left the ship at about 08:30 and the rest of the 5th Medium disembarked at 11:00 and marched outside the city to the staging point in a swampy field. As American trucks began to bring up supplies, the 5th Medium moved to a rock quarry as it was drier than the swamp. A rock slide, caused by heavy rains, killed Grn. Chiasson when he was struck by a falling boulder. Two others required hospitalization, one of which required the amputation of a leg. The 5th Medium spent the rest of the night without cover, tents or food in torrential downpours of rain. After boarding box cars, the 5th Medium left Lolli Station, Palermo, on 10 November 1943 towards their more permanent area in Zafferana. Traveling by train, the entire 5th Medium reached the Villa Angela on the slope of Mount Etna by 11 November 1943. The next few days in Zafferana consisted of continued training and inspections (and numerous swims in the Mediterranean Sea). On the 16‚Äì17 November 1943, the 7th and 23rd Batteries moved to Ionia. The training and checking of equipment continued, with events like mail arriving from Canada and even a minor earthquake occurring. The discipline was very strict, although it was noted that members of the 5th Medium were able to send a few parties into the city of Catania to gather wine. Also the amount of dysentery from men trading cigarettes for contaminated figs, oranges, dates and nuts were numerous because of the unsanitary handling of the food by the peasants. As the winter approached the 5th Medium moved to Altamura on 11 January 1944. On 24 February, eight new 4.5 inch guns arrived. Now complete with armament and equipment, the 5th Medium moved forward along the Adriatic coast to the river Sangro towards the Ortona line. The night of the 24 February 1944, the 5th Medium remained behind the line in outside of Lanciano awaiting the movement into the front. The 5th Medium found action in the Adriatic front held by the 5 British Corps. At this point, the 5th Medium had little to do but the odd counter-battery and in support of the 8th Indian Division's attempt at capturing German soldiers in the houses across the Moro. By mid-April, the 5th Medium received its orders to move again for a spring offensive on Cassino in the Liri Valley. On 27 April 1944, the 5th Medium began moving under the cover of darkness, stopping during the day in order to conceal their movements. By 11 May 1944, everything was in order for the assault on the German held Gustav line. At 23:00 on 11 May 1944 (Operation Honker), almost 2,000 Allied artillery pieces began firing on Cassino and the Gustav line. The 5th Medium's task during the attack was predetermined fire plans, shoots on hostile batteries, nebelwerfers and other targets of opportunity. By 3 June 1944, the regiment came out of action and began its move towards Pofi. By 11 June 1944, the regiment had returned to its old concentration area in Guardia. Training continued and by 3 August 1944, the regiment began to move again to an area near Spolatto. On 15 August 1944, Brigadier Huckvale, Commander of 1st Army Group Royal Artillery informed the regiment that it was going back into action north of Jesi, close to the Gothic Line. The 5th Medium found the Germans dug in along the Metauro and moved into a forward position on 24 August 1944. On 25 August 1944 at 24:00, the regiment participated in a large artillery barrage, but nowhere near the size conducted at Cassino. The fighting in this area continued for another week and the 5th Medium went out of action again on 2 September 1944 and took up a position outside of San Giovanni. They remained in this position for 13 days, in part due to the stiff resistance the 5 British Corps were facing from the Germans. Movement again occurred on 16 September 1944 to Coraino. On the night of 21 September 1944, the rain reduced the hillside the regiment was located into a \\"mass of mud\\". The Germans also were laying accurate fire on the roads leading from the area, thus restricting the regiment's movement. Equally, all equipment was \\"stuck at all possible angles and places\\" in the mud necessitating a postponement of movement until the next day. Eventually, after much winching and digging, the equipment was freed from the mud and the regiment made its way to a position south of Rimini. The regiment spent four days at the position in Rimini suffering many counter-battery attacks from German artillery. They then moved through the ruins of Rimini on the north side. The regiment remained in this position until 12 October 1944 when the advance on the front was again slowed at Savio. The regiment remained in action, doing little firing until 11 November 1944 when it moved into a rest area at Cesenatico. After spending two weeks at Cesenatico, Operation \\"Chuckle\\" began with intentions to capture Bologna and contain the 28 German Divisions in Italy. Bagnacavallo and Ravenna were eventually taken and the 5th Medium halted its advance along the Senio River which was decided would be the winter front line. The 5th Medium was eventually shifted to a new location near Godo. By 19 February 1945, the regiment came out of action and moved back to Cesenatico for movement to a new theater of action. On 23 February 1945 the 5th Medium learned that it was leaving Italy for North-West Europe. The regiment spent a week and a half in a camp outside of Naples (Camp Lammie) before boarding the ship, Ville D'Oran, on 12 March 1945 in Naples harbour. On 13 March 1945, at 10:30, the 5th Medium disembarked in Marseilles and was transported to a camp outside the city. The next day, in convoy, the 5th Medium moved through the Rhone Valley of France, into Belgium. On 19 March 1945, the regiment settled in the town of Waregam. After numerous cancelled movement orders, the 5th Medium eventually received orders to move into the Netherlands, outside of Nijmegen, firing on 1 April 1945 at 23:00 on targets along the Rhine and IJssel. By 15 April 1944, the 5th Medium moved to a new position north of Valberg, remaining there until 19 April 1945 when the regiment took up its last offensive position near Barneveld. On 26 April 1945, the 5th Medium received orders that it would not fire again, unless in retaliation. By 2 May 1945 a local truce had been declared to allow food conveys through to the Dutch citizens. On the evening of 4 May 1945, the regiment received word that the cessation of hostilities would occur on the following day and subsequently, a double issue of rum was authorized within the regiment to all personnel. After VE Day on 8 May 1945, the regiment moved towards Hippo and eventually to Doorn. The last day of the regiment's official existence was 30 June 1945.

In a general sense, \\"depressionism\\" is the practice of manipulating social ideas and conventions in such a way as to elicit an emotional or intellectual effect from the audience.

A distinctive feature of the Grabber was its adjustable pickup, which could be positioned by the player to simulate a neck or bridge pickup position, or in between, to provide further tonal variation. The pickup was brighter than the traditional Gibson style humbuckers. The Grabber had one volume and tone control each, and a removable bridge cover. The Grabber was originally built with a thin, maple body, but it was changed to alder in 1975. 1975 was a peak year for Grabber sales, with 2,637 units sold, due largely to its high-profile use by Kiss bassist Gene Simmons. The Grabber was available in wine red, ebony, natural, walnut and white finishes. It was discontinued in 1982, though small numbers were produced as late as 1984.http://www.gibsonbass.com/grabber.php Later, another model of the Grabber was produced, called the Gibson G3.

Normally, a nodule has a warty or knobby surface and exists as a discrete mass within the host strata. In general, they lack any internal structure except for the preserved remnants of original bedding or fossils. Nodules are closely related to concretions and sometimes these terms are used interchangeably. Minerals that typically form nodules include calcite, chert, apatite (phosphorite), anhydrite, and pyrite.Neuendorf, KKE, JP Mehl, Jr., and JA Jackson, eds. (2005) Glossary of Geology (5th ed.). Alexandria, Virginia, American Geological Institute. 779 pp. Boggs S, Jr. (2009) Petrology of Sedimentary Rocks. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom. 600 pp. In sedimentology and geology, nodular is used to describe a sediment or sedimentary rock composed of scattered to loosely packed nodules in matrix of like or unlike character. It is also used to describe mineral aggregates that occur in the form of nodules, e.g. colloform mineral aggregate with a bulbed surface. Nodule is also used for widely scattered concretionary lumps of manganese, cobalt, iron, and nickel found on the floors of the world's oceans. This is especially true of manganese nodules. Manganese and phosphorite nodules form on the seafloor and are syndepositional in origin. Thus, technically speaking, they are concretions instead of nodules. Chert and flint nodules are often found in beds of limestone and chalk. They form from the redeposition of amorphous silica arising from the dissolution of siliceous spicules of sponges, or debris from radiolaria and the postdepositional replacement of either the enclosing limestone or chalk by this silica.

In the 1960s and '70s, Milford developed further with the construction of the Westfield Connecticut Post Mall, one of the state's largest shopping malls, and the extensive commercial development of the town's stretch of the Boston Post Road. The city also became host to several headquarters of multinational corporations during the same period. Milford is home to the operational headquarters of the Subway fast-food corporation. The town also hosted the U.S. headquarters of the Bic Corporation, which has in recent years moved most of its operation outside of the city. In December 2005, the Mountain Development Corporation bought many of Bic's former manufacturing facilities, and is in the process of finding tenants.

Agriculture Agriculture has a great history in Palladam right from the introduction of modern farming in the early 1980s to the plantation of variety of medicinal and other trial based plantation till date. The people here are involved mainly in Agriculture like Cotton and Tobacco. The people of Palladam have always relied upon Agriculture like many other towns in INDIA. The association with Agriculture hasn't largely diminished over the years due to the continuous involvement of community & the participation from the younger generation. The primary vegetation was cotton in the early 1970s and 1980s at the time of the textile boom. Later the town adopted the Maize crop with the boom in the Poultry industry thus aiding the industries with local supplies to compete with both quality and pricing. Other vegetation are largely based on the local demands like common vegetables consumed by the house holds like the Onions (both small & big), Tomatoes, Brinjal, Okra, Peas, etc. Large amount of Cattle & Poultry in the region also leads to vegetation consumed by them. Currently this industry is not doing well due to insufficient and un-timely rains along with the decrease in the ground water levels by significant amount in the recent years.  Windmill  The Windmills installed here ranges from as low as 200 Kw to 2000 Kw. The power generated by these windmills largely accounts for the State's Electricity Supply & INDIA's highest installed wind capacity is in and around this town.

The troll is, as commonly depicted, not very intelligent and has poor vision, while the boy is clever, outwitting the troll to win an eating contest. Synopsis A farmer sent his sons to cut wood in a forest he owned, to pay off debts. A troll threatened them as they came, one by one; the two older ones allowed themselves to be chased off, but the youngest son (known in Norwegian as Askeladden 'Ash-lad', or called Boots in some versions), asked his mother for food before going out. When the troll threatened him, the boy pulled out some cheese, claiming it was a stone, and squeezed it until whey came out. When he threatened to deal with the troll as he had with the \\"stone\\", the troll offered to help him with the wood-cutting. The troll suggested that the boy come home with him. Then he went to build up the fire and sent the boy for water. The boy realized he could not carry the huge buckets, so he declared they were too small, and said he would just fetch the entire spring. The troll, not wanting to lose his spring, exchanged chores with him. When the porridge was made, they had an eating match, but the boy put more into his scrip than into his stomach, and when it was full, he cut a hole in it. The troll said he could eat no more. The boy suggested that he cut a hole in his stomach, which would let him eat as much as he liked, and it didn't hurt much. The troll did so, and died, and the boy took his gold and silver and paid off the family debt. Film The story was adapted into a 1967 puppet animation directed by Ivo Caprino, titled Gutten som kapp√•t med trollet. The film credits Peter Christen Asbj√∏rnsen as having collected the tale, despite Norwegian Folktales attributing it to J√∏rgen Moe.

Located in proximity to the IT industry in Old Mahabalipuram Road, Chennai's central business districts and the automobile hub in GST road has attracted more population to Pallikaranai in the 2000s. Pallikaranai became a part of the Chennai Corporation in July 2011. Pallikaranai place surrounded by various natural lands, water resources ponds, lakes and different varieties of birds. According to a 2012 report by global property consultant Knight Frank, the neighborhood has emerged as India's 11th largest destination for investment in the residential real estate, in the list of 13-top residential destinations in the country from an investment point of view, where housing prices are expected to increase by 93 percent over the period 2012‚Äì2017. Demographics India census, Pallikaranai had a population of 22,503. Males constitute 52% of the population and females 48%. Pallikaranai has an average literacy rate of 74%, higher than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 80%, and female literacy is 67%. In Pallikaranai, 13% of the population is under 6 years of age. Pallikaranai area contains several water bodies and many lakes and is also the home for the reputed National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT), which is the real technical arm under Govt of India. This institute has developed In-house Desalination Plant at Kavaratti under Mr Robert Singh and Dr Kathiroli. There are also many temples, parks and schools. In July 2011, Pallikaranai was joined with the Corporation of Chennai. A central grant for sewage system construction in Pallikaranai is awarded to State Government of Tamil Nadu under JnNURM scheme for which the tender and construction is expected to complete by February 2013. The effectiveness of the new sewage scheme is still in question due to the substandard contract approvals and usage of low quality construction materials. Most of the streets report damages to the underground laid sewage clay pipes and soil sinking. Way back from the start of project in 2009, most of the street roads in Pallikaranai are damaged for laying sewage pipes and then left untarred causing inconvenience for transportation. Location Pallikaranai is surrounded by Madipakkam in the northwest, Velachery in the north, Perungudi in the northeast, Kovilambakkam in the west, Thuraipakkam in the east, Nanmangalam in southwest, Medavakkam in the south and Karapakkam in the southeast on ECR. It is part of Chennai from year 2012 which has 3 wards, 189,190 and 191 under zone 14. ward 189 has Sree Balaji Dental college and Jerusalem Engineering College. ward 191 has Asan memorial college, St. Johns Memorial college, Bethotal School, Holley Bells in Saiganesh Nagar. Location in context Chennai monorail-Pallikaranai The Chennai monorail, which is in planning stage is likely to have a station in Pallikaranai in the Velachery-Vandalur route Pallikaranai Marsh Pallikaranai Marsh Pallikaranai wetland is a fresh water swamp adjacent to the Bay of Bengal situated in south Chennai with a geographical area of 80 km2. In 2007, a major portion of the Pallikaranai marshland was declared a reserve forest area and brought under the Tambaram range of the Forest department. The swamp is helpful in charging the aquifers of the region. It is one of the last few remaining natural ecosystems in the city of Chennai. Pallikaranai is a vast, marshy area bounded by -Velachery in north -Medavakkam in south -Kovilambakkam in west and -Okkiyampettai Thuraipakkam in east The swamp is helpful in charging the aquifers of the region. This blessing in fact has become a curse to the local residents. There are many unauthorized, private water supply companies like VVK, JK, RKS, Balaji water packaging etc., backed by politicians, counselor and government officials who pumps out gallons of water from wells and bores from the swamp surrounding like Ambal Nagar for commercial distribution within the city limits branding it as drinking water. The untreated water is being pumped out from abandoned wells filled with filth and then filled in tankers or cans for distribution. Many representations have been made by residents to officials like Chennai Mayor, CM, Kancheepuram Collector and even to local police for which no action has been taken so far. This unattended issue is causing many water borne diseases in the locality and deaths in Pallikaranai. See: http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/article3859667.ece Transportation Air The nearest airport of Pallikaranai is Chennai International Airport near Meenambakkam which is at a distance of ~13.5 km.http://www.distance.co.in/distance-from-chennai-international-airport-to- meenambakkam/by-road/ The shortest way to reach Pallikaranai is by using the Velachery Main Road. The other two ways are to go via Pallavaram-Thoraipakkam Radial Road. MTC buses also ply on this route, but you have to break the journey and change buses. Road Roads on both the sides are largely encroached and sight of seeing cattle on roads is very common and there has been a lot of accidents happened and no action taken by corporation or police yet. Pallikaranai has connectivity to various parts of the city. There are two arterial roads: Velachery Main Road, connects Tambaram, Solinganallur and Pallavaram-Thoraipakkam Radial Road. The Rs. 38.5 crore ROB in Tambaram completed in March 2009 and the Rs. 13.2 crore grade separator at Pallikaranai The grade separator in Pallikaranai at the intersection of Velachery Main Road and Pallavaram - Thoraipakkam Radial Road has been completed and has helped in reducing traffic. The Minister would be taking part in a function in Tambaram on that day and he would lay the foundation for a road overbridge at Tambaram and for the Pallikaranai grade separator. While the bridge at Tambaram is estimated to cost Rs. 34 crore, Rs. 14 crore is to be spent on the Pallikaranai grade separator as on 2010. The State Highways Minister, Mr. Saminathan announced the construction of this project in February after an inspection of Pallikaranai, where work on minor bridges was in progress. As per the design, vehicles towards Pallikaranai and Velachery would ply on the bridge, while motorists proceeding to Pallavaram and Thoraipakkam would be using the road beneath, according to senior engineers of the Highways Department.

Flora and fauna The topography of the swamp is such that it always retains some storage, thus forming an aquatic ecosystem. It has been a home for naturally occurring plants (61 species), fish (50 species), birds (106 species), butterflies (7 species), reptiles (21 species) and some exotic floating vegetation such as water hyacinth and water lettuce, which are less extensive now and highly localized. Recent reports of the appearance of the white- spotted supple skink, for the first time in Tamil Nadu, and Russell's viper, the largest and the most widespread among Asian vipers, confirm its invaluable ecological status. Fish such as Dwarf gourami and Chromides that are widely bred and traded worldwide for aquaria, occur naturally in Pallikaranai. Besides, the Windowpane oyster, Mud crab, Mullet, Halfbeak and Green chromide are some of the estuarine fauna present in the marsh. Environment Dumping of solid waste, discharge of sewage, construction of buildings, construction of a railway station and a new road to connect old Mahabhalipuram road and Pallavaram are causing the Pallikaranai marsh to shrink. Cognizant Chennai is located here now. Cognizant at Pallikaranai A major portion of the Pallikaranai marshland in south Chennai has been declared a reserve forest area and brought under the Tambaram range of the Forest department, according to a draft notification issued on 9 April 2007. The notification says: \\"The proposal of the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests sent in his letter for publication of the notification under Section 4 of the Tamil Nadu Forest Act, 1882 is approved\\". Senior department officials said a special tahsildar had been appointed to specify the boundaries and the extent of the marshland to be brought under their control. From now on, it would be known as \`Pallikaranai Swamp Forest Block.' They said of the marshland had been classified as reserve forest area. Earlier, it was classified under the Revenue records of the Kancheepuram district administration. For several years, nature lovers, environmentalists and civic groups had been pressing for protecting the area, as it was a natural habitat with rich flora and fauna. With the department taking over the marshland, it would be possible to take stringent action against trespassers and those dumping and burning garbage there, the officials said. Provisions of the Tamil Nadu Forest Act and Wildlife Protection Act could be invoked against them. Pallikaranai is the 17th reserve forest area in the Tambaram Range, whose reserve forest area goes up to .the Hindu The Union Environment Ministry is considering the approval of an adaptive management plan for the Pallikaranai marshland.Finally, a plan to save Pallikaranai marsh Famous temples There are many famous temples in Pallikaranai, with visitors from all parts of the city.

Lovecraft, written in March 1926 and published in the March 1928 issue of Tales of Magic and Mystery. Plot The narrator offers a story to explain why a \\"draught of cool air\\" is the most detestable thing to him. His tale begins in the spring of 1923, when he was looking for housing in New York City. He finally settles in a converted brownstone on West Fourteenth Street. Investigating a chemical leak from the floor above, he discovers that the inhabitant directly overhead is a strange, old, and reclusive physician. One day the narrator suffers a heart attack, and remembering that a doctor lives overhead, he climbs the stairs and meets Dr. Mu√±oz for the first time. The doctor demonstrates supreme medical skill, and saves the narrator with a combination of medications. The fascinated narrator returns regularly to sit and learn from the doctor. As their talks continue, it becomes increasingly evident that the doctor has an obsession with defying death through all available means. The doctor's room is kept at approximately 56 degrees Fahrenheit (13 degrees Celsius) using an ammonia-based refrigeration system; the pumps are driven by a gasoline engine. As time goes on, the doctor's health declines and his behaviour becomes increasingly eccentric. The cooling system is continuously upgraded, to the point where some areas of his rooms are sub-freezing, until one night when the pump breaks down. Without explanation, the panic-stricken doctor frantically implores his friend to help him keep his body cool. Unable to repair the machine until morning, they resort to having the doctor stay in a tub full of ice. The narrator spends his time replenishing the ice, but soon is forced to employ someone else to do it. When he finally locates competent mechanics to repair the pump, it is too late. He arrives at the apartment in time to see the rapidly decomposing remains of the doctor, and a rushed, \\"hideously smeared\\" letter. The narrator reads it; to his horror, he learns that Dr. Mu√±oz died 18 years previously. Refusing to surrender to death, he maintained the semblance of life past the point of death using various methods, depending upon refrigeration to retard decomposition. Inspiration Lovecraft wrote \\"Cool Air\\" during his unhappy stay in New York City, during which he wrote three horror stories with a New York setting. In \\"Lovecraft's New York Exile,\\" David E. Schultz cites the contrast Lovecraft felt between his apartment, crammed with relics of his beloved New England, and the immigrant neighborhood of Red Hook in which he lived as an inspiration for the \\"unsettling juxtaposition of opposites\\" that characterizes the short story. Like the story's main character, Shultz suggests, Lovecraft, cut off from his native Providence, Rhode Island, felt himself to be just going through the motions of life.David E. Schultz, \\"Lovecraft's New York Exile\\", Black /lForbidden Things, p. 55. The building that is the story's main setting is based on a townhouse at 317 West 14th Street where George Kirk, one of Lovecraft's few New York friends, lived briefly in 1925.S. T. Joshi and Peter Cannon, More Annotated Lovecraft, p. 159. As of 2006, the house was still standing. The narrator's heart attack recalls that of another New York Lovecraft friend, Frank Belknap Long, who dropped out of New York University because of his heart condition.Joshi and Cannon, p. 162. The narrator's phobia about cool air is reminiscent of Lovecraft himself, who was abnormally sensitive to cold.Joshi and Cannon, p. 158. Schultz indicates that \\"Cool Air\\"'s main literary source is Edgar Allan Poe's \\"The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar\\", described as Lovecraft's favourite Poe story after \\"The Fall of the House of Usher\\". Lovecraft had just finished the Poe chapter of his survey \\"Supernatural Horror in Literature\\" at the time that he wrote the short story.Schultz, p. 55. Lovecraft, however, stated years later that the story that inspired \\"Cool Air\\" was Arthur Machen's \\"The Novel of the White Powder\\", another tale of bodily disintegration.H. P. Lovecraft, letter to Henry Kuttner, July 29, 1936; cited in S. T. Joshi and David E. Schultz, \\"Cool Air\\", An H. P. Lovecraft Encyclopaedia, p. 47. Characters *Doctor Mu√±oz: A Spanish physician of \\"striking intelligence and superior blood and breeding\\", he is described as \\"short but exquisitely proportioned\\", with a \\"high-bred face of masterful though not arrogant expression\\", \\"a short iron-grey full beard\\", \\"full, dark eyes\\" and \\"an aquiline nose\\".Lovecraft, \\"Cool Air\\", pp. 201‚Äì202. He calls himself \\"the bitterest of sworn enemies to death\\", and one who had \\"sunk his fortune and lost all his friends in a lifetime of bizarre experiment devoted to its bafflement and extirpation.\\"Lovecraft, \\"Cool Air\\", p. 202. Saying he feels a \\"repugnance\\" on first meeting Mu√±oz that \\"nothing in his aspect could justify\\", the narrator remarks on \\"the ice-coldness and shakiness of his bloodless looking hands\\" and that his breathing was imperceptible. :An H. P. Lovecraft Encyclopaedia suggests that Mu√±oz may have been modelled on Lovecraft's Brooklyn neighbour, described by Lovecraft as ‚Äúthe fairly celebrated Dr. Love, State Senator and sponsor of the famous 'Clean Books bill' at Albany...evidently immune or unconscious of the decay.\\"H. P. Lovecraft, letter to B. A. Dwyer, March 26, 1927; cited in Joshi and Schultz, p. 47. This is presumably William L. Love, a Brooklyn physician and freemason who was a state senator from 1923 until 1932.\\"Index to Politicians: Love to Lovegrove\\", The Political Graveyard. *The unnamed narrator who has come to New York to do \\"some dreary and unprofitable magazine work\\". He has drifted from one cheap boarding house to another before finding that the one on West Fourteenth Street \\"disgusted [him] much less than the others he had sampled.\\"Lovecraft, \\"Cool Air\\", pp. 199-200. After being treated by Mu√±oz, his upstairs neighbor, he becomes \\"a disciple and devotee of the gifted recluse\\".Lovecraft, \\"Cool Air\\", p. 203. Reception Submitted to Lovecraft's regular outlet, the pulp magazine Weird Tales, \\"Cool Air\\" was rejected by editor Farnsworth Wright, a decision that has been called \\"inexplicable...since it would appear to be just the sort of safe, macabre tale that he liked.\\" It's possible that Wright feared that \\"its gruesome conclusion would invite censorship\\". Peter Cannon calls \\"Cool Air\\" Lovecraft's \\"best story with a New York setting\\", proving him \\"capable of using an understated, naturalistic style to powerful effect.\\"Peter Cannon, \\"Introduction\\", More Annotated Lovecraft, p. 6. Adaptations *Issue #62 of Warren Publishing's Eerie features a comic adaptation of \\"Cool Air\\" by Berni Wrightson. It was later reprinted several times, first by Warren, then by Pacific Comics. *The story \\"Baby... It's Cold Inside!\\" in EC Comics' Vault of Horror #17 is a loose comic adaptation of \\"Cool Air.\\" *\\"Cool Air\\" has been adapted for film or television at least three times: a 1971 episode of Night Gallery directed by Jeannot Szwarc with a teleplay by Rod Serling (where the narrator was changed to the daughter of a MIT colleague of Mu√±oz's, in order to accommodate a romantic plot for the story) \\"The Cold\\", directed by Shusuke Kaneko from a screenplay by Brent V.

One, ex GNR 251, later LNER 2800, survives in preservation. Much like their small boiler cousins, they were capable of reaching speeds of up to 90 mph (145 km/h).  Development  The C1 Class, as it was known under both GNR & LNER classifications, was designed by Henry Ivatt as an enlarged version of what became the LNER C2 Class. The principle of the design was to produce a powerful, free-steaming engine to haul the fastest and heaviest express trains on the Great Northern. They could thus be seen as the start of the East Coast 'Big Engine' policy. None were ever named.  First engine and improvements  The first engine, No. 251, was introduced in 1902, with eighty more being built at Doncaster Works between 1904 and 1908. Although they suffered from a number of teething troubles, the Atlantics were generally very successful. They were originally fitted with slide valves, but later gained piston valves, which produced a notable improvement in performance. The Atlantics remained in front-line service for many years, sometimes being called upon to haul trains of over . They were known for reaching speeds of up to 90 miles per hour. Variants On the GNR, the classification C1 was used for all of their 4-4-2 tender locomotives, but there was considerable variation within the 116 locomotives making up this group. The LNER divided them into two classes: C2 for the 22 locomotives built in 1898‚Äì1903 with boilers of diameter; and C1 for the remaining 94, which mostly had boilers of diameter ‚Äì but there were several locomotives within the latter group that differed significantly from the others. The \\"standard\\" variety of large-boiler C1 was represented by nos. 251, 272‚Äì291, 293‚Äì301, 1400‚Äì20 and 1422‚Äì51 built at Doncaster between 1902 and 1908. These had boilers producing saturated steam at a pressure of and two outside cylinders, having a diameter of and a stroke of using simple expansion driving the rear coupled wheels and fed through slide valves. No. 292, built at Doncaster in 1904 (but not entering service until 1905), was a four-cylinder compound. The high-pressure cylinders, having a diameter of and a stroke of , were outside the frames, driving the rear coupled wheels; and the low-pressure cylinders, were inside, driving the front coupled axle. The valves were arranged so that the locomotive could work either as a compound or as a four-cylinder simple. The boiler pressure was , but whilst the boiler was under repair, the locomotive used a boiler from 1910 to 1912. This locomotive was withdrawn in 1927 and scrapped in 1928. No. 1300, another four-cylinder compound, was an experimental locomotive which differed greatly from all of the others. It was built by Vulcan Foundry in 1905, largely to their own design although to Ivatt's specifications. The boiler had a narrow firebox, a diameter of and a pressure of . As with no. 292, the high-pressure cylinders were outside, driving the rear coupled wheels, whilst the low-pressure cylinders were inside, driving the front coupled axle; but their dimensions were and respectively. The engine worked as a two-cylinder simple on starting, changing over to compound expansion automatically. A superheater was fitted in 1914, and the engine was rebuilt as a two-cylinder simple in 1917; the new cylinders were outside, of the type used on class H3, driving the leading coupled wheels. It was withdrawn in 1924. No. 1421, built at Doncaster in 1907 was again a four-cylinder compound, but differed from no. 292 in a number of ways; in particular, the inside cylinder diameter was increased to . It was superheated in 1914 and rebuilt in 1920 as a two-cylinder simple with piston valves. It was then generally similar to the standard engines after they had been superheated, and it ran until 1947. The last ten, nos. 1452‚Äì61 built at Doncaster in 1910, had boilers producing superheated steam at , and the cylinders were fed through piston valves. No. 279 was rebuilt in 1915 with four cylinders utilising simple expansion and driving the rear coupled axle. It was rebuilt back to a two-cylinder simple in 1938, but using cylinders of the type used on class K2 having the piston valves above the cylinders; in this form it ran until 1948. No. 1419 (renumbered 4419 in May 1924) was equipped with a booster engine on the trailing axle in July 1923; to accommodate this, the frames were lengthened at the rear, which also allowed a larger cab to be fitted. At the same time, the locomotive was given a superheater and piston valves, in line with others of the class. The booster was removed temporarily between July 1924 and February 1925, and it was permanently removed in November 1935.  Later years  No. 2825 on a stopping train at Seven Sisters, 1946 They were eventually superseded on the heaviest trains by Gresley A1 Pacifics in the early 1920s. They continued to haul lighter expresses up until 1950, although this did include the Harrogate Pullman for a period during the 1920s and 1930s. They were often called upon to take over trains from failed Pacifics and put up some remarkable performances with loads far in excess of those they were designed to haul. One once took over the Flying Scotsman from a failed A3 at Peterborough and not only made up time but arrived early. Accidents and incidents : *On 19 September 1906, locomotive No. 276 was hauling a sleeper train which was derailed at , Lincolnshire due to excessive speed through the station after passing signals at danger. Fourteen people were killed and seventeen were injured. *On 13 February 1923, locomotive No. 298 was hauling an express passenger train that overran signals and was in a rear-end collision with a freight train at , Nottinghamshire. Three people were killed. : *On 15 June 1935, locomotive No. 4411 was hauling a passenger train that was run into by an express passenger train at due to a signalman's error. Fourteen people were killed and 29 were injured.  The last trip  Seventeen C1s made it to serve British Railways, albeit for a short time. According to The Railway Magazine, the last engine in service was BR 62822, ex GNR 294. On 26 November 1950 she hauled a train one way from Kings Cross to Doncaster to mark the end of the C1s. Among the many on board was the son of H.A. Ivatt, Mr. H.G. Ivatt who received one of the builder's plates. On display at Doncaster was pioneer sister ex GNR 251, already preserved, and a number of modern engines. The return trip to London was hauled by A1 Pacific 60123 named, suitably enough, H.A. Ivatt.  The first becomes the last, No. 251  Pioneer 251, LNER 2800, had been saved for the UK National Collection even before the last one was withdrawn from revenue service in 1950. Restored to GNR livery, she is the only C1 to survive. She joined preserved sister GNR 990 \\"Henry Oakley\\" on two weekends of trips entitled Plant Centenarian in 1953, celebrating the 100th anniversary of the Doncaster Works. On 20 September the two engines, 990 leading, hauled the train from Kings Cross to Doncaster carrying nearly 500. LNER Class A4 2509 Silver Link (BR 60014) brought the train back to Londonhttps://www.sixbellsjunction.co.uk/50s/530920pc.html. A similar trip a week later operated from Kings Cross to Leeds with a stop at Doncaster, with the GNR veterans again hauling one leg of the trip. No. 251 steamed poorly on these trips, because the superheater had been removed although the boiler flues had not been replaced with small tubes to compensate. Further trips followed, the last being on 12 September 1954, but it was not until March 1957 that the locomotive was placed in York museum. Two C1 boilers, one of them once belonged to No. 3287, was discovered at a factory at Essex in 1986 by Steve Dymond and Nick Pigott, the revelation that the boiler once belonged to No. 3287 wasn't revealed until 2005 by a pressure washer. The boiler that once belonged to No. 3287 was in good condition and was purchased by the Bluebell Railway for their H2 project while the other boiler was scrapped due to it being very bad condition.

John Reynell (9 February 1809 ‚Äì 15 June 1873) was an English- born emigrant to the colony of South Australian where he became established as a wheat farmer, a sheep and cattle breeder, and a vigneron and winemaker. Reynell was born in Ilfracombe in 1809 from a Devonshire farming family. The Reynell family became established at East Ogwell in Devon in the 14th century.Vivian, Lt.Col. J.L., (Ed.) The Visitations of the County of Devon: Comprising the Heralds' Visitations of 1531, 1564 & 1620, Exeter, 1895, pp.643-5, pedigree of Reynell; Prince, John, (1643‚Äì1723) The Worthies of Devon, 1810 edition, London, pp.692-7 Accompanied by his cousin Samuel Reynell (c. 1818‚Äì1892), he arrived in South Australia in October 1838 aboard Surrey and established his property about 20 kilometres south of the main settlement of Adelaide near the area that became known as McLaren Vale. Reynell is thought to have established the first commercial vineyard and winery in South Australia by planting vine cuttings in 1839 that he had bought at the Cape of Good Hope. Other sources say that in 1841 he planted the first vineyard with 500 cuttings from Tasmania, and made wine in 1843. Reynell employed a young man named Thomas Hardy (who also became a famed winemaker) to help him to tend to the vineyards. They became the largest wine producers in the McLaren Vale region. The first vintage was produced in 1842. He built the Old Cave cellar in 1845 - the cellar survives to the present day. He pioneered the export of claret and burgundy to New Zealand. In 1839 Reynell was one of the fifty settlers who formed the Agricultural and Horticultural Society of South Australia. On 31 January 1839 Reynell married Mary Anne Lucas and had three children: a daughter Lucy Reynell (1842‚Äì1921) (who married Ross T. Reid of Gawler), Lydia Reynell (d.1904 aged 60 years), and a son Walter Reynell (1846‚Äì1919) (who married Emily Bakewell (1851‚Äì1887), a daughter of William Bakewell MP. Walter's daughter Gladys Reynell became one of Australia's earliest studio potters.

Gelbvieh were originally known as ‚Äúred-yellow Franconian cattle‚Äù and were developed from several local breeds. Gelbviehs were originally bred to be triple purpose cattle (used for milk, beef, and draught), but the modern Gelbvieh is primarily used for beef production.  Characteristics  Gelbvieh literally means \\"yellow cattle\\" in German, and the breed originated as golden brown cattle with dark hooves and full body pigmentation. Through selective breeding, polled and black genetics are now also prevalent in the breed. Gelbvieh cattle are known for their high rate of gain and feed efficiency, and were originally selected for easy growth, quick maturity, length of loin, leanness, docility, and longevity. They are able to adapt to many different rangelands and climate conditions. Gelbvieh females were selected to be very maternal with strong fertility, mothering instincts, good udders, and strong milk production. They are also known to have smaller bodied offspring, allowing for ease of calving.  Purebred and full blood  Full blood Gelbvieh cattle are direct descendants of those registered in the German herdbook and originally imported to Canada and the United States. Purebred Gelbvieh have been bred using outside genetics for certain breed improvements, but both males and females must remain 88% Gelbvieh. Those animals that are less than 88% Gelbvieh are known as percentage Gelbvieh.  History  In the mid-19th century, several breeds of local German cattle began to be combined into what would eventually be the Gelbvieh. The new breed was officially formed by 1920. Gelbvieh have been introduced to several countries around the world, including Spain, Portugal, Great Britain, Canada, the United States, Australia, and South Africa, primarily through the use of artificial insemination and some live export. The first Gelbvieh genetics reached Canada in 1972 from Germany. Gelbvieh are currently the 6th largest beef breed in Canada with 3500 head registered yearly. The first Gelbvieh cattle were imported to the United States from Germany in 1971 by Leness Hall. The American Gelbvieh Association was formed the same year. There are currently 45,000 registered Gelbvieh cows in the United States. In January 1977, the first American National Gelbvieh Show was held in conjunction with the National Western Stock Show in Denver, Colorado.

Commission (2007) T-201/04 is a case brought by the European Commission of the European Union (EU) against Microsoft for abuse of its dominant position in the market (according to competition law). It started as a complaint from Sun Microsystems over Microsoft's licensing practices in 1993, and eventually resulted in the EU ordering Microsoft to divulge certain information about its server products and release a version of Microsoft Windows without Windows Media Player. The European Commission especially focused on the interoperability issue. Headquarters of the European Commission, which has imposed several fines on Microsoft Facts In 1993, Novell claimed that Microsoft was blocking its competitors out of the market through anti-competitive practices. The complaint centered on the license practices at the time which required royalties from each computer sold by a supplier of Microsoft's operating system, whether or not the unit actually contained the Windows operating system. Microsoft reached a settlement in 1994, ending some of its license practices. In 1998, Sun Microsystems raised a complaint about the lack of disclosure of some of the interfaces to Windows NT. The case widened when the EU examined how streaming media technologies were integrated with Windows. Judgment  Citing ongoing abuse by Microsoft, the EU reached a preliminary decision in the case in 2003 and ordered the company to offer both a version of Windows without Windows Media Player and the information necessary for competing networking software to interact fully with Windows desktops and servers. In March 2004, the EU ordered Microsoft to pay ‚Ç¨497 million ($794 million or ¬£381 million), the largest fine ever handed out by the EU at the time, in addition to the previous penalties, which included 120 days to divulge the server information and 90 days to produce a version of Windows without Windows Media Player.Commission Decision of 24.03.2004 relating to a proceeding under Article 82 of the EC Treaty (Case COMP/C-3/37.792 Microsoft)date=2007-06-02. Official Journal of the European Union. The next month Microsoft released a paper containing scathing commentary on the ruling including: \\"The commission is seeking to make new law that will have an adverse impact on intellectual property rights and the ability of dominant firms to innovate.\\" Microsoft paid the fine in full in July 2004. In 2004, Neelie Kroes was appointed the European Commissioner for Competition; one of her first tasks was to oversee the fining brought onto Microsoft. Kroes has stated she believes open standards and open source are preferable to anything proprietary: Significance Microsoft has a compliant version of its flagship operating system without Windows Media Player available under the negotiated name \\"Windows XP N\\". In response to the server information requirement, Microsoft released the source code, but not the specifications, to Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 (SP1) to members of its Work Group Server Protocol Program (WSPP) on the day of the original deadline. Microsoft also appealed the case, and the EU had a week-long hearing over it. Neelie Kroes stated: Microsoft stated in June 2006 that it had begun to provide the EU with the requested information, but according to the BBC the EU stated that it was too late. On 12 July 2006, the EU fined Microsoft for an additional ‚Ç¨280.5 million (US$448.58 million), ‚Ç¨1.5 million (US$2.39 million) per day from 16 December 2005 to 20 June 2006. The EU threatened to increase the fine to ‚Ç¨3 million ($4.81 million) per day on 31 July 2006 if Microsoft did not comply by then. The case of Microsoft v Commission shed light on the difference of judgments between the US Antitrust Laws and EU Competition Law. In regard to Competition Law, when the commission, incorrectly decides that a behavior by a firm is abusive (when in fact it is not), the business of the firm is harmed, and the consumers lose out by missing out on the products or services offered by the business. In this situation, the law is over- inclusive, and is known as a ‚ÄòFalse Positive‚Äô. The US Antitrust Laws are more concerned with false positives and the authorities are more likely to step back. The second scenario, where the Commission concludes that a behavior by a firm is not abusive (but it is), the firm is left alone to its own devices and to its anti-competitive practices, which may affect the competition process and cause irreparable damages, and ultimately the consumers are harmed. As a result of the law being under-inclusive, the firms get away with their anti- competitive practices. This is known as a ‚ÄòFalse Negative‚Äô, and the European Union Competition Commission is more concerned with this, and it would rather interfere than step back. The US court's fear of false positives was seen in the case of Verizon Communication Inc v Law offices of Curtis Trinko (2004) which was about refusal to supply.The US Supreme court stated that it had to include a realistic comparison between the costs and the benefits of antitrust intervention. It stated that mistaken conclusions and false condemnations are very costly and that they negate the purpose which antitrust laws are designed to protect. In the EU, the case relevance is IMS Health GmbH & Co. OHG v NDC Health GmbH & CO. kg, in which the Court of Justice laid down limited conditions under which a dominant firm's refusal to license IP to a competitor constitutes an abuse of a dominant position in violation of Article 82 of the Treaty establishing the European Community (Now Article 102 TFEU). The main concern raised in Microsoft v Commission was whether two distinct products were a subject of a tie. Tying is a specific type of exclusionary abuse which refers to the situation where customers that purchase one product (the tying product) are also required to purchase another product from the dominant undertaking (the tied product). This is intended to provide the customers with better products in the most cost-effective ways. However, an undertaking which is dominant in one product market can harm consumer benefit through tying by foreclosing the market for other products. The commission's findings showed that Microsoft had tied its Windows Media Player to its personal computer operating system. There was serious evidence to point out that Microsoft advertised the Windows Media Player as a standalone product and download it by itself, it was designed to work with competitor's operating systems, separate licensing agreements for the media player. Alden F. Abbott (U.S. Federal Trade Commission) while visiting the Center for Competition Law and Policy at the University of Oxford, in his paper on 'A Brief comparison of European and American Antitrust Law' talked about the early intervention of the European enforcers in regard to bundling/tying practices which conforms to the idea about the European Union and its concern for False Negatives. He states that bundling carried out by a dominant firm is likely to be found more concerning by the EU than the American Enforcers.Neelie Kroes, the then Commissioner for EU Competition Policy stated that Microsoft had continued to abuse its powerful market position and hindering innovation by charging extraordinary royalties to companies for providing crucial data to computer users around the world. She also goes on to state that main aim of the competition policy is to avoid consumer harm and to produce consumer benefits. However, the Assistant Attorney General at that time for Antitrust, R. Hewitt Pate issued a statement on the EC's decision in its Microsoft investigation. He commented that the US Antitrust Laws are enforced to protect the consumers by protecting the competition, not competitors. The commission's Guidance on Article 102, states that the commission will normally only intervene where the conduct concerned has already been or is capable of hampering competition from competitors which are considered to be as efficient as the dominant undertaking. The commission is mindful that what really matters is protecting an effective competition process and not simply protecting competitors. This may well mean that competitors who deliver less to consumers in terms of price, choice, quality and innovation will leave the market. With regards to tying of the WMP, the commission found out that customers were unable to buy windows without WMP, and they install any alternative software alongside WMP. Microsoft argues that customers need not use it and that they did not have to pay extra for it. Microsoft argues that tying of WMP allowed the consumers to have their personal computers running with default options, out of the box, which lowered the transaction cost by reducing time and confusion. The decision highlighted that tying in this particular case would result in foreclosing the competition in this market. There was evidence that even though the other media players were rated higher in quality, WMP's usage increased due to the tying process. The commission ordered that Microsoft should sell in Europe, a full functioning version of windows without WMP. It also asked Microsoft to refrain from promoting WMP over competitors through Windows or providing selective access to Window's API's. Microsoft was also restricted from giving discount to customers who were buying the operating system together with WMP, which would restrict the user's choice to select the version without the player, and unbundled version had to have similar performance with the bundled version. Richard Whish in his textbook goes on to say that the way in which Article 102 has been construed, has led academic commentators to compare it with ordoliberalism, which is capable of having negative effects on the competition process, but disagrees by stating that at the heart of Article 102, the main objectives of EU commission are competition, efficiency, and welfare. On 17 September 2007, Microsoft lost their appeal against the European Commission's case. The ‚Ç¨497 million fine was upheld, as were the requirements regarding server interoperability information and bundling of Media Player. In addition, Microsoft has to pay 80% of the legal costs of the commission, while the commission has to pay 20% of the legal costs by Microsoft. However, the appeal court rejected the Commission ruling that an independent monitoring trustee should have unlimited access to internal company organization in the future.Microsoft loses anti-trust appeal.

On 27 February 2008, the EU fined Microsoft an additional ‚Ç¨899 million (US$1.44 billion) for failure to comply with the March 2004 antitrust decision. This represented the largest penalty ever imposed in 50 years of EU competition policy until 2009, when the European Commission fined Intel ‚Ç¨1.06 billion ($1.45 billion) for anti-competitive behaviour. This latest decision follows a prior ‚Ç¨280.5 million fine for non-compliance, covering the period from 21 June 2006 until 21 October 2007. On 9 May 2008, Microsoft lodged an appeal in the European Court of First Instance seeking to overturn the ‚Ç¨899 million fine, officially stating that it intended to use the action as a \\"constructive effort to seek clarity from the court\\".Update: Microsoft to appeal $1.3B EU fine In its 2008 Annual Report Microsoft stated: On 27 June 2012, the General Court upheld the fine, but reduced it from ‚Ç¨899 million to ‚Ç¨860 million. The difference was due to a \\"miscalculation\\" by the European Commission. The commission's decision to fine Microsoft was not challenged by the court, saying the company had blocked fair access to its markets. E.U. competition commissioner, Joaqu√≠n Almunia, has said that such fines may not be effective in preventing anti-competitive behavior and that the commission now preferred to seek settlements that restrict businesses' plans instead. As such, The New York Times called the Microsoft decision \\"a decision that could mark the end of an era in antitrust law in which regulators used big fines to bring technology giants to heel.\\" A spokesperson for Microsoft said the company was \\"disappointed with the court‚Äôs ruling\\" and felt the company had \\"resolved [the commissions'] competition law concerns\\" in 2009, making the fine unnecessary. He declined to say whether Microsoft would file an appeal or not. Almunia called the ruling a vindication of the crackdown on Microsoft and warned \\"The judgment confirms that the imposition of such penalty payments remains an important tool at the commission‚Äôs disposal.\\" He also claimed that the commission's actions against Microsoft had allowed \\"a range of innovative products that would otherwise not have seen the light of day\\" to reach the market. The fines will not be distributed to the companies that lost income due to Microsoft practices. The money paid in fines to the European Court goes back into the EU budget. Related investigations In May 2008, the EU announced it was going to investigate Microsoft Office's OpenDocument format support. In January 2009, the European Commission announced it would investigate the bundling of Internet Explorer with Windows operating systems from Microsoft, saying \\"Microsoft's tying of Internet Explorer to the Windows operating system harms competition between web browsers, undermines product innovation and ultimately reduces consumer choice.\\" In response, Microsoft announced that it would not bundle Internet Explorer with Windows 7 E, the version of Windows 7 to be sold in Europe. On 16 December 2009, the European Union agreed to allow competing browsers, with Microsoft providing a \\"ballot box\\" screen letting users choose one of twelve popular products listed in random order. The twelve browsers were Avant, Chrome, Firefox, Flock, GreenBrowser, Internet Explorer, K-Meleon, Maxthon, Opera, Safari, Sleipnir, and SlimBBC, Microsoft offers browser choices to Europeans, 1 March 2010 which are accessible via BrowserChoice.eu. The automatic nature of the BrowserChoice.eu feature was dropped in Windows 7 Service Pack 1 in February 2011 and remained absent for 14 months despite Microsoft reporting that it was still present, subsequently described by Microsoft as a \\"technical error\\".

The series follows Adrian Monk (Tony Shalhoub), a private detective with obsessive‚Äìcompulsive disorder and multiple phobias, and his assistant Natalie Teeger (Traylor Howard). In this episode, Monk has to link two different cases while an actor hired to play him in a film emotionally disturbs him. Written by Hy Conrad and Joe Toplyn, and directed by Randall Zisk, \\"Mr. Monk and the Actor\\" guest starred Stanley Tucci. The staff envisioned the episode after imagining the possibility of Monk becoming a famous detective. When the episode first aired in the United States on the USA Network on July 7, 2006, it was watched by over 5.1 million viewers. Critics gave it positive reception, praising specially Tucci's performance. It also led Tucci to win the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series. Plot While a man, Jack Leverett (Greg Grunberg), is cheating on his wife with a woman named Michelle Cullman (Susan Ward), he finds a hidden camera and, while fighting for the camera, accidentally kills her. The following day, Monk (Tony Shalhoub) announces to his therapist, Dr. Charles Kroger (Stanley Kamel), he will go on his first vacation since the murder of his wife, Trudy. Later, Monk goes to the crime scene to investigate and is informed by Captain Stottlemeyer (Ted Levine) and Lieutenant Disher (Jason Gray-Stanford) that a film about him will be produced. As method actor David Ruskin (Stanley Tucci)‚Äîset to play Monk in the film‚Äîis there to observe his mannerism, Monk tries to impress him. The next day, Ruskin follows Monk again as he investigates a case at a pawnshop in which its owner was shot during a robbery. Monk is intrigued as to why the burglar entered through the wall and only stole a small amount of money and a wristwatch. After discussing if Ruskin's presence can harm Monk, Natalie (Traylor Howard) and Monk find the crime's weapon. Monk finds the same glitter he found on Cullman's hair in the gun and argues the thief stole the watch to replace his one, deducing that the same person committed both crimes. Later, Stottlemeyer and Disher watch the film's shooting and Natalie's prediction is right: Ruskin has impersonated Monk to the point that he is unable to complete the sequence because he is hassled by the setting's disorder (or rather, the inconsistent \\"pattern\\" in how some crew members are wearing their hats). He leaves the studio, goes to Monk's house to know what are his reasons to do his job, and explores Monk's files on Trudy's murder, grieving Monk. An afflicted Monk goes to Natalie's house, where he solves the case when he sees a paper torn up by Julie to prevent Natalie from reading it. The pawnshop is adjacent to a restaurant, where clients are drawn on the wall. On the crime's night, Leverett and Cullman were sketched and Leverett tried to destroy the evidence. Meanwhile, Ruskin is at the scene of Trudy's murder when a guard, believing Ruskin to be Monk, informs him Leverett is the killer (meaning the killer of Cullman and the pawnshop owner) David, however, believes this to mean that Leverett is Trudy's killer. When Stottlemeyer and Disher arrive at Leverett's car dealership to arrest him, Ruskin has already arrived and is keeping him as a hostage. Monk enters the dealership and stops Ruskin but is emotionally shaken when Ruskin says he could have saved Trudy. At the end, he talks with Dr. Kroger and cancels his trip. Production Stanley Tucci, who was \\"always our first choice for the actor role,\\" guest starred in this episode. His performance was highly praised by television critics, and led Tucci to win the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series. \\"Mr. Monk and the Actor\\" was co-written by Hy Conrad and Joe Toplyn, and was directed by Randall Zisk. The concept for the episode first emerged while the staff was working on fourth season episode \\"Mr. Monk and the Astronaut\\", and they wondered if Monk would become famous. The first idea was to use the same set and actors from \\"Mr. Monk and the Astronaut\\" to create an episode in which a made-for-TV film is recorded about that case. It was not done but writers still wanted to create an episode focusing on a TV film, which eventually became \\"Mr. Monk and the Actor\\". On its original script, it exceeded the runtime by about six minutes so a scene involving a child mistaking a gun for a toy was cut. It would be the murder weapon, and even though a six-year-old actor was hired for the scene it was not filmed. Shalhoub and Tucci had been friends since they met each other at the Yale Repertory Theater in 1989 when they acted on John Guare's play Moon Over Miami. In 1996, they co-starred in the film Big Night, which Conrad said was the main reason Tucci was \\"always our first choice for the actor role.\\" Tucci said it was a \\"funny thing\\" since the role of Monk was offered to him after Big Night but he declined it. Shalhoub affirmed he had requested Tucci to appear on Monk for a long time before this episode but Tucci had theretofore rejected due to scheduling conflicts. Another guest star for the episode, Peter Weller, was on set to direct \\"Mr. Monk, Private Eye\\" and volunteered for the role of the actor who plays Captain Stottlemeyer. Release and reception \\"Mr. Monk and the Actor\\" was first available via video on demand service on June 30, 2006, and its television premiere through USA Network was on July 7, 2006 at 9 pm EST. According to an USA's press release, the episode was viewed by an estimated number of 5.3 million viewers, while Nielsen Media Research indicated a viewership of 5.1 million and a 3.89 rating. Gary Levin of USA Today called it a \\"shy\\" if compared to season four premiere's figure of 6.4 million. USA, however, said it was the most watched scripted hour in basic cable ever from its time slot. The episode was well-received; IGN's Colin Moriarty gave it a score of 9 out 10, it was deemed \\"excellent\\" by John White of The Digital Fix, and it was elected by The Futon Critic's Brian Ford Sullivan the 49th best television episode of the year. Kevin McDonough, a critic for the United Feature Syndicate, called it \\"a great episode\\" and compared it to a Seinfeld episode with a similar premise. Several critics praised Tucci's performance and his interactions with Shalhoub. Diane Werts wrote for Newsday, \\"Which one's nuttier? It's a toss-up, and a fascinating one with the terrific Tucci as Shalhoub's emotional tango partner.\\" An anonymous reviewer for Times Colonist commented \\"Watching Shalhoub pretend to be Monk pretending to be a suave, sophisticated sleuth is a delight in its own right. Watching Tucci take Monk's nervous tics to ridiculous extremes is even more of a delight, especially when its appears that Monk's nervous disorder may be catching.\\" In contrast to other reviewers, Adam Finley of AOL TV elected the best moment of the episode Disher's reaction to the fact his role is played by a woman who dates Stottlemeyer. Moriarty, Matt Crowley of The A.V. Club and Varietys Paula Hendrickson used it as example of how Monk can fit comedy scenes during dramatic ones. Ann Zivotsky, a writer for the North County Times, commented, \\"Watching Tucci and Shalhoub play this for laughs would have been enough for some shows, but the Monk writers take the opportunity to let the movie actor share with Monk the insights he's learned about the detective, which may help, or hurt, Monk.\\" Finley and David Kronke of Los Angeles Daily News also highlighted the line \\"[Ruskin] wanted to play a character that wasn't so depressing and dark. He's in England doing Hamlet.\\" Criticism to the episode was done by Finley who said, \\"So much of this show is dependent on Monk's subtle mannerisms, but he exaggerates them to an absurd degree as he tries to impress the actor who's playing him.\\" Similarly, Werts said \\"Shalhoub pushes a tad too far with the compulsions.\\" Robert Bianco of USA Today was also critical of its \\"excessive quirks and overall credibility-busting silliness.\\" Although praised Shalhoub‚ÄìTucci dynamic, Rich Heldenfels of Akron Beacon Journal criticized it as \\"the actor-imitating-life thing has been done before on TV and in the movies, and the gag well is pretty dry.\\" At the 59th Primetime Emmy Awards, Tucci won the award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series for his role on this episode.

Murugan Computer center  History  Legend has it that Panagudi got its name from its abundance of palm trees, known in Tamil as Panai Maram. The name Panagudi directly derives from Panaikudi, the names of its post office and railway station.  Economy  As of 2007, Panagudi was a fast-developing town at the centre of many important industries. The town was becoming a business hub for various corporations such as KKNPP and ISRO, as well as tile factories, wind farms, and other projects. Demographics India census, Panagudi had a population of 29,895. Males constituted 49% of the population and females constituted 51%.

They were well known as palm climbers in earlier days, but currently, they depend more on business activities. Nadars are categorized as Hindu Nadars and Christian Nadars Climate, Geography, Nature, Wildlife Surrounded by mountainous terrain, Panagudi is located in a windy area, which has led to the development of several wind farms around the area. Panagudi experiences two monsoons, the southwestern monsoon and the northeastern monsoon. Panagudi has the Western Ghats (Mahendragiri) running on the west side and is surrounded by a chain of mountains. The mountains form natural waterfalls named Kuthara Paanjan and Kani Maram Thoppu, both of which receive water when the season is favourable. A waterfall is located in the area which is known to everyone as Kuthira Panchan, in Mahendragiri of the Western Ghats, just 9 km away from the Panagudi Police Station. The waterfall is located outside of the town limits, though there is an approach road. There are no signboards, so people who wish to visit the place must find the falls with the help of locals in the area. The fall is seasonal in nature, and hence the best time to visit is after the monsoon, when the flow is good.[3] The other popular areas in the mountains are Kanchi Paarai, Kunni Muthu Solai, Sengamaal, and Iyar Thottam. There are farms and plantations of various crops, fruits, cashew nuts, and mangos around Panagudi. Nature is well protected and maintained in this area. Paddy and banana are cultivated and Vazhai Thoppu is famous for banana cultivation. The Panagudi forest is a habitat of various animals such as tigers, elephants, different species of deers including Sambar deers, fox, Indian wolves, red dogs, bears, rabbits, porcupines, and various species of snakes and birds.

The Professional Karate Association was formed in 1974 by Don and Judy Quine in association with Mike Anderson.Corcoran, John and Farkas, Emil. Martial Arts: Traditions, History, People. Gallery Books, New York (1983) p. 317 It was launched with the initial world championships in 1974 at the Los Angeles Sports Arena, and was telecast on ABC's Wide World of Entertainment. The winners of the initial championship were Joe Lewis (heavyweight), Jeff Smith (light heavyweight), Bill \\"Superfoot\\" Wallace (middleweight), and Isiasis Duenas (lightweight). Additionally, Vernon Mason (also called Vernon \\"Thunder Kick Mason\\") would become US PKA's first bantamweight champion after knocking out Sonny Onowa. Joe Corley joined the PKA in 1977 and together with Jerry Piddington organized the committees that would control the sport of full contact karate for the next 9 years. The PKA went on to have a long term relationship with ESPN that lasted until 1986, while also airing a series of fights on CBS under the watch of CBS Sports VP Barry Frank and on NBC via Sean McManus. The PKA was by far the most visible sanctioning body for what became better known as kickboxing in the United States, in 1982 sanctioning 43% of events worldwide. and producing more than 1,000 hours of television content. The PKA signed many fighters to exclusive contracts in order to build its brand in the sport, just as most other sports organizations sign athletes to exclusive contracts. Some fighters chose to go to other competing organizations, but the PKA was by far the most well known, as were its fighters. The PKA sanctioned fights exclusively with what has become known as \\"full contact rules\\" which permit kicks only above the waist as opposed to the \\"international rules\\" advocated by other organizations. In 1989 Joe Corley gained the rights to PKA in an out of court settlement ending a 3-year dispute with his PKA partners. The PKA has since operated as a promotion company. The PKA hosted fights with SHOWTIME through the 90s and held its first pay per view event with SHOWTIME featuring Jean Yves Theriault vs Rick Roufus, Dennis Alexio vs Dick Kimber and Paul Vizzio vs Juan Torres, but folded shortly thereafter.

Stereoscopic photograph of the falls by Benjamin Franklin Upton Settlers moved in, and by 1830 logging and wheat farming were common in the Willow River Valley. The river was invaluable for the former, as logs were floated downstream to the St. Croix. A German immigrant, Christian Burkhardt, realized the river could also be harnessed for the latter industry, and built a grist mill here in 1868. Burkhardt became a wealthy landowner and followed developments in water-powered industry. He traveled home to Germany to examine hydroelectric power plants and returned in 1891 to build his own on the Willow River. Burkhardt eventually built four power plants and dams on the river, which provided electricity to Hudson. Northern States Power purchased Burkhardt's power company in 1945 and operated its sites until 1963, when damage to one of the plants from a lightning strike prompted the company to liquidate their Willow River holdings. In 1967 Northern States Power sold the land to the Wisconsin Conservation Commission for a state park, and stabilized the dams at a financial loss. The state park opened in 1971.

The station is a community outreach ministry of Cornerstone University. WCSG claims to be \\"the most listened-to Christian radio station in West Michigan\\", providing contemporary inspirational Christian music and programming to the local market and streaming ‚Äúlive‚Äù on the Internet. WCSG is rebroadcast on three other stations throughout West Michigan: * 90.9 WCFG - Springfield/Battle Creek * 88.3 WCXK - Kalamazoo (Formerly WAYK) * 89.9 WCXB - Benton Harbor (Formerly WAYO) History WCSG began broadcasting after five years of preparation on June 9, 1973, with an easy listening and fine arts format. In 1981, WCSG's programming changed to a primarily Christian format and three years later, the station began broadcasting inspirational programming and music twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, before evolving into its present Christian AC- based format. The vision of WCSG is to encourage, participate and equip the media for Christ and Christians in Western Michigan. Advertising As WCSG and its affiliates broadcasts on frequencies allocated in the United States for non-commercial educational use, WCSG is forbidden from broadcasting traditional, pre-recorded commercials. Instead, WCSG hosts regularly recognize both corporate and individual sponsors, similar to the approach used by other non-commercial and public radio stations. A typical \\"recognition\\" involves the host reading a slogan and a brief description of the goods and services offered by a corporate sponsor, or reading a personalized message written by an individual sponsor. The contributions of these sponsors account for 30% - 40% of WCSG's funding. Awards and honors The station received a special recognition at the National Association of Religious Broadcasters convention in February 2001, when Focus on the Family selected WCSG from among 987 U.S. radio stations for its Station of the Year Award. In April 2001, the Gospel Music Association nominated WCSG for a Dove Award for Station of the Year. In 2007, R&R; magazine recognized WCSG as 2007 Christian Station of the Year, Markets 26-100.

It presently consists of over 40 member organizations. CAF's stated objectives include protecting civil liberties and human rights as well as combating racism and hate within Canada. It has been most vocal against anti- Arab and anti-Muslim activities in Canada, and has issued many position papers to the government with respect to its policies in the Southwest Asia and its domestic immigration policies. It discharges its political tasks by building media and government relations and grassroots support through various capacity-building projects within the Canadian Arab community, and promoting Muslim and Arab culture. Its current president is Farid Ayad, who replaced Khaled Mouammar, who was elected in early 2006. Mouammar was also president in the 1970s, and again from 1980 to 1982. Omar Alghabra was president from 2004‚Äì2005, an MP then Parliamentary Secretary for the Minister of Foreign Affairs for the Justin Trudeau government in Canada. History Since its founding in 1967, the CAF has represented the Arab community with regard to a range of foreign and domestic issues. The CAF opposed the Camp David Accord signed by Egyptian President Anwar El Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin on September 17, 1978, and protested Begin's visit to Canada shortly thereafter.\\"Peace inevitable, may take time, Begin says\\", The Globe and Mail, November 10, 1978; Jon Ferry, \\"Toronto Palestinian sees humiliation in treaty signing\\", The Globe and Mail, March 27, 1979, 13. In 1982, the CAF commissioned a study on the depiction of Arabs in political cartoons published between 1972 and 1982 in Canadian dailies. Published in 1986, the study determined that Arabs were repeatedly portrayed in a stereotypical fashion as bloodthirsty terrorists, untrustworthy, ignorant, cruel, and backward. The researcher pointed to the danger of such pervasive negative imagery, recalling the role played by German caricaturists in their similar depictions of Jews as laying the basis for the Holocaust. In The Holocaust, Israel, and Canadian Protestant Churches (2002), Haim Genizi writes of the CAF's participation in a 1982‚Äì83 initiative of the Canadian Council of Churches (CCC) to launch a tripartite Southwest Asian discussion group for the CCC, the Canadian Jewish Congress (CJC), and the CAF. When the CJC declined to dialogue with Arabs, meetings between the CAF and the CCC alone continued on for eight months, ending with agreement on the need to educate Canadians to dispel anti-Arab stereotyping. For the churches, there was also recognition of the need to formulate a clear policy on Southwest Asia situation. During the Gulf War, CAF documented over 100 violent anti-Arab incidents, calling the security roundup of more than 1,000 Arab-Canadians the most encompassing security sweep in Canada's history. On June 14, 2004, the CAF, in cooperation with the Canadian Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-CAN), presented before the Arar Commission, a Canadian special commission set up to investigate the extraordinary rendition and torture of Maher Arar. A Canadian citizen of Syrian origin, Arar was detained by American immigration officials at a New York airport on a stopover there between Geneva and Toronto. He was sent to Syria, where he was imprisoned and tortured for a year before being released. The CAF and CAIR-CAN reminded the special commission that there need, \\"be no contradiction between security and the fundamental values we share as Canadians\\". The joint submission continued: > Democratic and legal rights and liberties, pluralism, respect for human > dignity and the rule of law are the principles that define us as Canadians. > These are the 'basic tenets' of our legal system that find their explicit > affirmation in the Charter. They are what safeguard democracy. If, in the > name of fighting terrorism, we sacrifice these values for the sake of > security, we lose our character, our identity, the very essence of a free > and democratic society. We lose the war on terrorism if we become that kind > of state that represses democratic rights and freedoms. Israel-Palestinian conflict activism 1970s‚Äì80s The CAF opposed Prime Minister Joe Clark's 1979 pledge to move the Canadian embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, and welcomed Clark's eventual retreat on the issue. CAF President Khaled Mouammar said that moving the embassy would have meant recognizing territory that was taken by force.\\"Arabs in Canada hail PM's change of heart\\", The Globe and Mail, October 30, 1979, 8. In 1980, Mouammar said he would call for a boycott of stores selling Dedy Toys, which imported materials from a settlement in the occupied West Bank.\\"Toronto firm to import West Bank toys\\", The Globe and Mail, September 1, 1980, 5. In 1981, the CAF hosted a press conference for two Palestinian mayors who had been deported by Israel from the West Bank. The mayors called for Canada to put pressure on the government of Israel to permit them to return.\\"Mayors deported from West Bank plead for aid in bid to return home\\", The Globe and Mail, May 18, 1981, 5. Khaled Mouammar condemned Israel's attack on Iraq's Osirik nuclear reactor later in the year, and described Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin as an \\"unrepentant terrorist\\" who was a constant threat to the region.K.L. Mouammar, \\"Israel's action\\" [letter], The Globe and Mail, June 11, 1981, 6. In September 1982, the CAF led a non-violent demonstration in Toronto against the massacre of between 762 and 3,500 civilians, mostly Palestinians and Lebanese Shiites, in Sabra and the Shatila refugee camp in Beirut, Lebanon.Kevin Cox, \\"5,000 plan to join protest rally over refugee massacre in Beirut\\", The Globe and Mail, September 27, 1982, 5. The organization later partnered with the Arab- Palestine Association to find sponsors for children who had been orphaned in the attacks.Zuhair Kashmeri, \\"Sponsors sought for 900 orphans\\", The Globe and Mail, July 16, 1983, S10. When Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau recognized the right of Palestinians to a homeland in 1983, his statement was supported by the Canadian Arab Federation. Rashad Saleh, Mouammar's successor as CAF president, said that Canada's Arab community would strongly support any peace efforts brought forward by the prime minister.Zuhair Kashmeri, \\"PLO increasing attacks on Israelis\\", The Globe and Mail, December 12, 1983, 1. Prominent members of the Canadian Arab Federation criticized the Very Rev. Canon Borden Purcell in 1984, for comments that he made about anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism. Purcell, who was chair of the Ontario Human Rights Commission at the time, had remarked that \\"public expressions of anti-Zionism have now replaced public expressions of anti-Semitism\\". Saleh responded that most Arabs oppose Zionism because of its pivotal role in the foundation of the State of Israel and of the \\"present plight of the Palestinians\\", adding that it was \\"not directed at Jews or their religion.\\" Purcell later clarified that he did not believe \\"being anti-Zionist is necessarily anti-Semitic\\".\\"Rights panel head will address Arabs\\", The Globe and Mail, February 23, 1984, 23. In March 1984, the Canadian Arab Federation reported that a Montreal company hiring aircraft technicians to work in Israel was using discriminatory practices against Muslims. According to the CAF, LPL Engineering Services Ltd. informed an applicant that he was disqualified for the position because of his religion. A spokesperson for the company subsequently said, \\"There's a war going on out there, so why should the Israelis employ Arabs to work on secret projects. Would the Americans employ Russians?\\" The CAF indicated that it would consider filing an application before the Canadian Human Rights Commission or the Quebec Provincial Human Rights Commission.Denys Horgan, \\"Jobs in Israel Firm discriminating, Arab group says\\", The Globe and Mail, March 29, 1984, M2. In the same year, the CAF criticized the Canadian government for its refusal to allow into Canada the Most Rev. Archbishop Hilarion Capucci, titular archbishop of Caesarea for the Melkite Greek Catholic Church, who served several years in prison in Israel in the 1970s for using his diplomatic status to smuggle arms to the Palestine Liberation Army. The federation argued that his exclusion was part of \\"a strategy to keep articulate and informed spokesmen for the Palestinian cause ... out of the public eye.\\"\\"Shut-out of cleric assailed by Arabs\\", The Globe and Mail, April 5, 1984, M4. Also in 1984, the CAF undertook a fundraising campaign to build a cultural centre in the Israeli Arab community of Nazareth. Saleh asserted that the Israeli government was not providing the city with adequate infrastructure.Michael Swan, \\"Stoking the fires back home\\", The Globe and Mail, July 5, 1984, CL1. Support for boycott of Israeli goods In a press release responding to the recent stepped up Israeli attacks on Gaza known as Operation Summer Rains, the CAF urged the Canadian government to \\"join Canadian churches and unions by boycotting Israeli goods, divesting from Israeli companies, and imposing sanctions until Israel withdraws from all the occupied Arab territories, dismantles all settlements and tears down the Apartheid Wall.\\" CAF's president, Khaled Mouammar, has referred to Israel as \\"the Israeli apartheid regime\\". In \\"Impressions of Palestine ‚Äì 1948 Today\\", he wrote of a \\"racist ideology that guides the Apartheid State of Israel\\" and of his conviction \\"that one day the nightmare brought about by Zionism and colonialism will come to an end.\\" Mouammar criticized Toronto Mayor David Miller for participating in Toronto's \\"Walk for Israel,\\" stating that Israel is \\"a pariah state,\\" and that Israel \\"systematically violates international law and practices racism\\". In a letter published in The Globe and Mail, Mouammar clarified that the CAF's stance on anyone who supports Israel is that \\"we [the CAF] assert that any support for Israel is support for apartheid, occupation and war crimes.\\"\\" In his capacity as president of the Canadian Arab Federation, Mouammar has condemned Zionist organizations in Canada for their support of Israel. In January 2007, he wrote that Bnai Brith Canada and the Jewish Defence League were using \\"bullying and intimidation tactics to silence criticism of Israel\\" and had launched \\"a vicious campaign of intimidation\\" against movements that call for boycotts of Israel within the Canadian political landscape. He also wrote that as more people support boycotts of Israel, \\"the more difficult it becomes for pro-Israel groups such as B'nai Brith and the JDL to spew their propaganda.\\" Regarding an October 2007 Hamilton Declaration which stated \\"We further specifically caution you against any recognition of Israel as a 'Jewish state.' Such a recognition would give Israel the fa√ßade of moral and legal legitimacy\\". Khaled Mouammar stated that he \\"certainly agrees\\" with the declaration. However, the CAF did not sign the declaration because it \\"does not qualify,\\" since the document was endorsed at a convention for Palestinians, and not for Arabs in general. In January 2008, the CAF and the Canadian Islamic Congress stated that \\"[the] Apartheid regime of the Jewish state escalated its genocidal crimes against the indigenous people of Palestine\\" and that \\"Palestinians continue to endure death, deprivation and destruction under more than 40 years of brutal Israeli occupation that has become an insidious and unremitting genocide.\\" In March 2008, the CAF and the Canadian Islamic Congress stated that \\"Israel was founded upon the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people. Between 1947 and 1948, nearly 800,000 Palestinians were expelled from their homes and lands and over 500 Palestinian villages and neighborhoods were destroyed, and their inhabitants prevented from ever returning to their homeland.\\" In May 2008, on the 60th anniversary of Israel's founding, CAF president Khaled Mouammar stated that > CAF applauds the growing isolation of Israel through the boycott and > divestment campaign that has been embraced by many labour, academic and > religious organizations in Canada and abroad, and the growing realization > among youth and students that Israeli practices and policies mirror those of > Apartheid South Africa. CAF believes that popular awareness of the plight of > Palestinians will bring the day when the Israeli occupation will end and the > refugees will return to Palestine. Criticisms of Canadian-Israel relations Israel-Canada free trade agreement In July 2006, CAF president Khaled Mouammar wrote that: > The Canadian government has been a major supporter of the Israeli Apartheid > Regime, both economically (Canada has a Free Trade Agreement with Israel > that grosses over 1 billion dollars) and diplomatically (Canada voted > against the Palestinian Refugees Right of Return at the UN in March of this > year, Canada was also the first country to declare sanctions against the > Democratically elected Hamas government). \\"Israel's values are Canada's values\\" In April 2007, Mouammar criticized Bob Rae for supporting Israel, stating in the Vancouver Sun that: > Canadians have a duty to criticize politicians like Bob Rae who support an > apartheid state that commits serious human rights violations, and those like > Paul Martin and Stephen Harper who shamefully declare that \\"Israel's values > are Canada's values.\\" Canadian opposition to UN resolution lifting blockade of Gaza In February 2008, Mouammar criticised the Conservative Government of Stephen Harper, stating that: > The Harper government's decision to boycott and starve the democratically > elected government of the Palestinians under occupation, and its opposition > to a UN resolution calling for the lifting of the siege of Gaza, has given > Israel the green light to intensify and escalate its crimes against the > Palestinian people. The Harper government's silence, while Israel commits > these massacres against the Palestinian people and engages in an ongoing > campaign of assassinations in Lebanon and Syria, makes the government > morally complicit in these crimes. Canadian support for Israel's 2008‚Äì09 attacks in Gaza In January 2009, Ali Mallah, a CAF Vice-President, sharply criticized the Conservative Government of Stephen Harper for its position on the 2008‚Äì2009 Israel‚ÄìGaza conflict. At a protest outside the Israeli Consulate in Toronto, Mallah stated, in a speech to the crowd, that: > [Canadian Minister of Transport] John Baird was quoted as saying the > resisters in Palestine are cowards. Well I have news for you John Baird and > Stephen Harper, the only coward we know is Stephen Harper and his > government.Gaza protests draw thousands across Canada, The Canadian Press > (reprinted by The Globe and Mail), January 10, 2009. Hezbollah Ali Mallah, a CAF Vice-President stated Hezbollah \\"is seen as a symbol of the struggle against Israeli oppression, injustice and occupation.\\" During the 2006 Israel/Hezbollah conflict, CAF President Khaled Mouammar criticized the Canadian Government stance on Hezbollah, stating that: > By refusing to deal with Hezbollah, a political party represented in the > Lebanese government whose resistance to Israel's aggression is supported by > 87 per cent of Lebanese citizens, Peter MacKay is parroting the Bush > administration's stand and is emboldening Israel to launch further wars > against its neighbours. Hamas In a policy paper released in November 2006, the CAF defended Hezbollah and Hamas, stating that \\"Both of these groups are legitimate political parties, with grassroots support, and are represented in the legislature and the cabinets of Lebanon and the Palestinian Authority respectively. Both groups are resisting the illegal Israeli occupation of Lebanon and Palestine respectively which right is guaranteed under international law\\" and called on the Canadian Government to \\"remove Hezbollah and Hamas from the list of banned organizations.\\" Canadian boycott of Durban II Conference In January 2008, the Canadian government announced it was planning to boycott the 2009 World Conference against Racism (referred to commonly as \\"Durban II\\"). The Government justified its decision by stating that the first Durban Conference of 2001 \\"turned into an embarrassing promotion of racist attitudes\\" and became \\"a bit of a circus for intolerance and bigotry, particularly but not exclusively directed at the Jewish people.\\" The Canadian Arab Federation strongly opposed this decision, stating in a news release that \\"Canada's outright rejection of the conference sends a clear message to the Canadian public that the current government is disinterested [sic] in promoting human rights and anti-racism.\\" As for the activities of the first Durban conference in 2001 in relation to Israel, the CAF argued that this \\"indicates that the international community and human rights organizations are in agreement that the occupation of Arab lands, the mistreatment and killing of Palestinians, and the denial of the right of Palestinian refugees to return is in violation of international law and will be condemned and no longer accepted\\" and that \\"It is ironic that the Canadian government is so outspoken about shunning the conference due to the fear of hearing criticisms against the Israeli occupation, given its own past with hate and bigotry\\". Statement on racism in Israel In January 2007, CAF President Khaled Mouammar wrote in the Toronto Star that: \\"for the Jewish president of Israel to believe that he is being targeted because of his Middle Eastern origin speaks volumes about the racism permeating Israeli society. This does not come as a surprise to the 1.2 million Palestinian Arab citizens of Israel who are Christians and Muslims. The racism they face is a result of official racist policies by the Israeli government.\\" Mouammar concluded that \\"Racism in Israel is becoming mainstream.\\" B'nai Brith Canada, a Canadian Jewish organization, criticized CAF President Khaled Mouammar for his comments on Israel. B'nai Brith Executive Vice-President Frank Dimant wrote that: > Israel is a vibrant, democratic society founded on the principles of > tolerance and respect for all of its citizens. This includes the more than 1 > million Arabs who call Israel home, who participate in the political process > and who have obtained top-level positions in society. This is in stark > contrast to Israel's neighbouring Arab nations. While Mouammar may speak of > discrimination of Arabs in Israel, it is curious that these same > Palestinians have time and again expressed their preferred desire to live in > Israel rather than be placed under the control of the Palestinian Authority. Flyer on Bob Rae's political positions on the Middle East During the Liberal Leadership contest (where delegates met to vote for the new leader of Liberal Party of Canada), a flyer circulated electronically among convention delegates denounced candidate Bob Rae for: # Having delivered a speech to the Jewish National Fund (JNF). The flyer stated that \\"the Jewish National Fund manages all state lands in Israel and allows only Jews to live on such land, a 'practice that amounts to ethnic cleansing,' and added that 'Canadians have the right to know who supports the JNF in Canada.'\\" # That his wife served as vice-president of the Canadian Jewish Congress, a lobby group, according to the flyer that \\"supports Israeli apartheid. It was produced and disseminated to all Canadian Members of Parliament by Ron Saba, the editor of the website Montreal Planet. The CAF, in a news release, supported the contents of the flyer stating that \\"CAF believes that Canadians have the right to know the factual information provided.\\" The Canadian Jewish Congress condemned the flyer and its circulation by the \\"president of the Canadian Arab Federation.\\" Both CJC's President Ed Morgan and CJC's CEO said the purpose behind raising the fact that Rae's wife is a member of the Congress's board was \\"strictly to say that his wife is a Jew.\\" Mouammar countered that the CJC response was \\"a pitiful attempt to discredit\\" the CAF and that the flyer \\"nothing to do with Bob Rae's and his wife's religion and ethnicity but has a lot to do with their political views.\\" Mouammar also denied that the CAF had any role in distributing the flyer. However, the Canadian Press noted that it had procured a copy of an email from Mouammar forwarding the flyer to others.< Yoine Goldstein, a Canadian Senator and the Vice President of the Jewish National Fund sharply criticized Mouammar for distributing the letter saying that it was racist and that it was \\"brazenly anti-Canadian.\\" Tarek Fatah and the CAF In February 2009, Tarek Fatah, founder of the Muslim Canadian Congress (MCC) sharply criticized the Canadian Arab Federation (CAF) in an article published in the National Post. Fatah, who received the CAF's highest award in December 2001, stated that the CAF's current leadership has turned the organization \\"into a mouthpiece for Hamas and Hezbollah in Canada.\\" Fatah stated that the CAF used to sponsor debates on the pros and cons of the Oslo peace accord but today labels \\"any backer of the two-state solution [as] a traitor to the Muslim cause.\\" Fatah claimed that CAF's vice-president in Ontario, Ali Mallah, referred to the Muslim Canadian Congress in an online forum as \\"house negros\\" and had stated that Fatah himself has \\"no shred of decency of integrity left\\" and that he serves \\"Zionist masters.\\"Tarek Fatah: Stop funding fundamentalism by Tarek Fatah, National Post, February 20, 2009. In response to Fatah's article, CAF Vice-President Ali Mallah subsequently emailed a response to a large group of recipients. In the email, which was later republished by the National Post, Mallah wrote that: Awards ;Zafar Bangash, Former Editor Crescent International In June 2007, the CAF honoured Zafar Bangash at a gala dinner for his \\"unwavering\\" support of Palestine. Bangash was the former editor of Crescent International, an Islamist newsletter, based in Ontario. According to Licia Corbella of Sun Media, Bangash is a supporter of Hezbollah and uses the term kuffar (non-believers) to refer to non-Muslims derogatorily. When reached in Toronto by phone by Corbella, Mouammar refused to believe that Bangash used the term kuffar stating: \\"He's a man of dignity. He has no blood on his hands like those Israeli war criminals who come to Canada and are received by our politicians, like Ariel Sharon.\\" ;Sid Ryan, CUPE President The CAF has also granted awards to CUPE Ontario president Sid Ryan, whose union passed a resolution to boycott Israel at their annual convention. ;Ehab Lotayef, Montreal Activist Another CAF award winner is Ehab Lotayef, a Montreal activist who started a boycott of Chapters and Indigo book stores because of Heather Reisman and Gary Schwartz' support for the Heseg Foundation for Lone Soldiers, a charity that provides university scholarships for former IDF soldiers who were classified as a Lone soldier during their service in the Israel Defense Forces.Tabar, Vivian, Behind the boycott, The Dominion, accessed January 1, 2008 2008 essay competition In 2008, the Canadian Arab Federation and the Canadian Islamic Congress (CIC) launched an essay contest that \\"invites Canadian high school and university students (ages 17 through 27) to write an essay on the theme \\"The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine\\" and is part of activities commemorating the 60th anniversary of Al Nakba ‚Äì the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians from their homeland in 1947‚Äì48.\\" ;Criticism from Bnai Brith Canada Bnai Brith Canada, a Canadian Jewish Organization, criticized the contest, stating that it is a \\"blatant [propagandistic] initiative that distorts reality, delegitimizing the existence of the Jewish state in any shape or form\\". The national essay contest announced by these groups encouraging youth to write on \\"Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine\\", is based on the false assumption that the Jewish presence in the Jewish People‚Äôs ancestral homeland is illegal\\" and that \\"This sham of a contest joins together Canadian-Arab groups, which purport to reflect mainstream positions, but which clearly hold extremist notions that deny Israel‚Äôs right to exist.\\" Bnai Brith Canada also stated that the contest \\"intentionally distorts reality and serves only to engender hate against Israel, its Jewish citizens and supporters here in Canada. Rather than constructively look for creative ways in which to address the complex politics of Southwest Asia, the leaders of these Canadian-Arab organizations appear intent on fostering malevolence towards Israel, based on lies and distortions.\\" Bnai Brith Canada called on Universities and high schools \\"to issue clear directives to staff that the contest, an exercise in hate targeting the Jewish State, is contrary to the equity and human rights policies of these institutions.\\" ;Response to Bnai Brith Canada criticism The Canadian Arab Federation and Canadian Islamic Congress (CIC) responded to Bnai Brith Canada, stating that \\"This call to shutdown academic research and free speech is typical of B'nai Brith's contempt for the basic principles of academic institutions. These tactics of intimidation are becoming an all too common refrain of pro-Israel organizations, and are simply designed to stem the growing public awareness of Israel‚Äôs apartheid policies.\\" They also stated that \\"B'nai Brith's response to this essay competition is one further confirmation that pro-Israel organizations fear the wide support amongst Canadians for justice in Palestine. The myths surrounding Israel's establishment are being exposed for what they are, and thousands of high school and university students across the country are active in solidarity campaigns with the Palestinian people\\" and that \\"B'nai Brith has once again proven that its claim to support human rights is nothing but a rhetorical device designed to obfuscate their support of Israel‚Äôs policies of discrimination, apartheid and ethnic cleansing.\\" Dispute with Jason Kenney and Federal funding In February 2009, Immigration Minister Jason Kenney announced that he would review and possibly reduce or eliminate federal funding to the Canadian Arab Federation (CAF). Reportedly, this was prompted when CAF president Khaled Mouammar called Kenney a \\"professional whore\\" for supporting Israel and criticizing the presence of Hezbollah and Hamas flags at recent protests in Toronto. Kenney justified the decision by stating groups whose leaders say \\"intolerant or hateful things\\" should be denied taxpayer funding. Kenney stated that \\"We should not be rewarding those who express views that are contrary to Canada's best liberal values of tolerance and mutual respect.\\"Jonathan Kay applauds Jason Kenney for smacking down the Canadian Arab Federation. One question: What took him so long? by Jonathan Kay, National Post, February 17, 2009.Funds lost over hatred by Elizabeth Thompson, Sun Media (published in the Toronto Sun), February 17, 2009.Kenney says some Canadian Arab groups express hatred toward Jews, CBC News, February 17, 2009. CAF President Mouammar responded that Kenney's decision was \\"vindictive\\" and accused him of promoting Islamophobia internationally. He also stated that the government of Stephen Harper \\"is anti-Arab and anti- Muslim.\\" He also criticized the government for refusing to meet with the Canadian Arab Federation or the Canadian Islamic Congress since it came to power in 2005. Mouammar also stated that the proposed cuts would damage settlement programs run by the CAF in Toronto which teach new immigrants language and job searching skills. CAF executive director Mohamed Boudjenane suggested that the government's motive for punishing the CAF was political, stating that \\"They maybe decided to go after the Zionist vote, like Reisman and Schwartz and Tannenbaum ‚Äì people who used to be Liberal.\\" He also stated that the \\"Government cannot tell one group that they deserve tax money and another that they don't. We just want to be able to express our views like all citizens.\\"Say what you want ‚Äì just don't expect taxpayers to pay by Margaret Wente, Globe and Mail, February 28, 2009. Jonathan Kay, writing in the National Post, stated that the CAF is \\"a radicalized embarrassment to Canadian Arabs\\" and the government was justified in removing its funding. Kay recounted a meeting with Mouammar and a CAF colleague with the National Post editorial board in 2008 during which Kay claimed that the CAF \\"laid blame for virtually every problem the world faces on Israel‚Äîincluding the alienation of Arab- Canadian children in Canada's public school system.\\" Kay also stated that one of the representatives stated that he had sent his daughter for education overseas \\"because the inclusion of Israel in Canadian textbooks was too traumatic for her to endure.\\" Margaret Wente wrote in The Globe and Mail that the CAF should be free to express its opinions but that it should not be entitled to government funding due to its anti-Israel views. The Canadian Jewish Congress (CJC) also supported cutting funding to the CAF, stating that it \\"has shown poor judgment and disgraceful behaviour.\\"Arab group's 'narrow worldview' unworthy of funding by Bernie Farber, National Post, February 20, 2009. B'nai Brith Canada issued a press release supporting Kenney's proposal, stating that the CAF \\"has engaged in inflammatory rhetoric, and the promotion of antisemitic and pro-terrorist propaganda.\\"‚ÄòGrowing acknowledgment that Canadian Arab Federation is sowing seeds of hatred,‚Äô says B‚Äônai Brith Canada , B‚Äônai Brith Canada, Press release, February 20, 2009. In a subsequent interview with the Canadian Jewish News (CJN), Kenney again criticized CAF President Mouammar, stating that: > The more Mr. Mouammar... speaks, the more clear it is that he doesn‚Äôt speak > for the vast majority of Canadians of Arab origin, who are honest, decent, > thoughtful, democratic, moderate people; most of whom came to this country > seeking life in a stable, liberal democracy, not this kind of shrill, > cartoonish voice of extremism that he too often represents.Arab group calls > Kenney 'professional whore' By Andy Levy-Ajzenkopf, Canadian Jewish News > (CJN), February 26, 2009. Regarding the CAF's claim that the funding cuts would damage settlement programs for immigrants, Kenney stated that this was \\"complete baloney\\" and that \\"There are no shortage of worthy organizations out there that can help us deliver solid settlement [programming] without us having to help finance the distribution of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad videos.\\" Jim Karygiannis, a Liberal Party Toronto Member of Parliament, criticized Kenney for proposing to cut funding to the CAF and asked parliamentary ethics commissioner, Mary Dawson, to investigate whether Kenney is abusing his position. Karygiannis' complaint stated \\"I believe for the Minister to use his position and exert undue influence and or in this case instruct his officials to hold funding from such an NGO; this sets a bad precedent which clearly should not be allowed to stand. With this move the Minister sends out a signal to community- based NGOs to toe the line or risk losing their funding.\\" Catherine MacQuarrie, assistant ethics commissioner, said the ethics office will assess Karygiannis' complaint. Kenney's assistant, former American Enterprise Institute lobbyist Alykhan Velshi, responded that Karygiannis' complaint was \\"ridiculous\\" and suggested that it was \\"disturbing\\" for an MP to stand up for a group that, in Velshi's perspective, had made \\"anti-semitic\\" comments.Threat to cut Arab group's funding has Grit fuming by Elizabeth Thompson, Toronto Sun, March 4, 2009. The National Post newspaper, owned by the Asper family's CanWest Global Communications, also criticized Karygiannis, accusing him trying to \\"[score] political points with the many Arab and other ethnic voters in his riding.\\"Editorial: Subsidizing hatred, National Post, March 5, 2009. In early March 2009, CAF President Mouammar subsequently stated, in an email to Arab groups, that the CAF was the victim of a \\"well-planned Zionist campaign.\\" Mouammar wrote that: > The Zionist campaign is being waged by the Canadian Jewish Congress and > B'nai Brith supported by some politicians...The campaign of intimidation > launched by the Israeli lobby and their supporters is seeking to de- > legitimize Arab Canadian institutions, services, access to public funds and > to silence all criticism of Israel.CAF chief alleges 'Zionist campaign' by > Kathryn Blaze Carlson, National Post, March 9, 2009. The email sharply criticized Jason Kenney, stating that he had made \\"inflammatory remarks\\" which have \\"inflamed a campaign to marginalize and demonize the already targeted Arab and Muslim Canadian communities.\\" The email concluded with a request for Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper to \\"put an end to his [Jason Kenney's] dangerous campaign of attacking CAF with slanderous and damaging accusations for which he has provided no evidence.\\" Mouammar's letter was later signed by approximately two dozen Arab organizations from across Canada, including the Palestine House, Canadian Lebanese for Dialogue and the Ottawa-based Ahlul Bayt Centre.Letter asks PM to muzzle minister by Megan O'Toole, National Post, March 10, 2009. The CAF later stated that it is undemocratic and dangerous for a cabinet minister to \\"bully\\" an elected president and board of directors. CAF executive director Mohamed Boudjenane stated that he was \\"amazed\\" by Kenney's statements and that both sides should \\"agree to disagree on foreign policy,\\" but that Kenney was \\"pouring oil on a fire.\\" Mouammar stated that Kenney's threat to cut funding \\"means a minister of a crown ... depending on the people he likes or dislikes, he will grant taxpayer money for services... I think all settlement agencies should be very concerned with this issue.\\" In response to the email, a spokesperon from Jason Kenney stated that \\"this e-mail, by specifically naming the Canadian Jewish Congress and B'nai Brith, again shows he does not just disdain Zionists, but the Jewish community as a whole\\" and that \\"It's the ugliest, most vile sort of language. It's not surprising to us that he is again engaged in this sort of reprehensible rhetoric trying to pit community against community.\\" Kenney's office later stated that the groups that signed the letter were \\"unrepresentative... of the grassroots of the community. Most of them barely exist even on letterhead, some don't have Web sites, or any ongoing operations or programs.\\" Kenney's office specifically noted that the National Council on Canada-Arab Relations and the Islamic Society of North America had not signed the letter and that the groups that did sign represented a \\"tiny\\" and \\"quite radicalised minority\\" of Arab-Canadian organizations. Kenney also repeated his proposal to cut government funding to the CAF, stating that \\"Groups that promote hatred and anti-Semitism don't deserve a single red cent of taxpayer support. End of story.\\" The Canadian Jewish Congress (CJC) stated that Mouammar's accusations were \\"bizarre\\" and that the CAF \\"was a once-proud organization that has turned into nothing but a group whose sheer focus seems to be to attack Jews and Israel.\\" B'nai Brith Canada stated that Mouammar's accusations \\"that Jewish groups have co-opted media outlets, such as the National Post, and even the government, to do their bidding smacks of age-old anti-Semitic conspiracy theories.\\" It also stated that \\"we are Zionists who wear the label proudly. We will continue to oppose each and every effort that seeks to delegitimize the Jewish state and its supporters. We will denounce those voices promoting hate, whether emanating from Canadian universities, unions or from the head of an Arab organization whose mandate to settle newcomers to this country has been seriously put into question.\\"Zionists 'wear the label proudly' by Frank Dimant executive vice- president, B'nai Brith Canada, National Post, March 10, 2009. On March 13, 2009 Kenney gave an interview with the Canwest News Service and Global National in which he stated that a final decision about cutting funding to the CAF will be made soon. Kenney again sharply criticized the CAF, stating that \\"I can tell you, at my ministry, I have no intention of funding that organization as long as it has the current leadership that apologizes for groups like Hezbollah and Hamas, says they should be able to operate legally, that promotes hateful and extreme views, particularly the most pernicious and durable form of hatred, which is anti-Semitism.\\" He also stated that there are many moderate organizations that can fulfil the projects that were contracted to the CAF. However, he suggested that the threat to cut funding could be removed if more moderate leaders were in place, stating that \\"I think if the character of the organization were to change and there were to be a leadership of that group that was much more in keeping with our Canadian values, broadly understood, I would be entirely comfortable with them being a service delivery partner of our ministry.\\" Kenney was accompanied to and from the interview by two RCMP bodyguards due to \\"threat assessment\\" conducted by the RCMP reportedly concluded that he needs full-time personal security.Interview: Jason Kenney ‚Äì Immigration minister exchanges volleys with the Canadian Arab Federation by Juliet O'Neill, Canwest News Service, March 13, 2009. (also published in the National Post as Arab group risks funding, Immigration Minister says by Juliet O'Neill, National Post, March 14, 2009.) The CAF' member organizations issued a statement supporting CAF President Khaled Mouammar, although it did state that Mouammar's accusation that Kenney was a \\"professional whore\\" was \\"unfortunate.\\" Wahida Valiante, President of the Canadian Islamic Congress stated that Kenney should \\"not use his position to intimidate or pummel his critics and potentially cause enormous collateral damage in the process.\\" She also compared the feud between Kenney and Mouammar to the actions of former Quebec Premier Maurice Duplessis who intervened to arrange the revocation of the liquor license of Frank Roncarelli, an action which was eventually deemed unlawful by the Supreme Court of Canada.Jason Kenney and Mr. Khaled Mouammar's Internecine War by Wahida Valiante, Canadian Islamic Congress, March 12, 2009. On March 18, 2009 the Rick Stewart, associate assistant deputy minister, operations, sent a letter CAF President Khaled Mouammar which stated that the government will not renew a two-year, $2.1-million contract, which expires at the end of March, for immigrant language instruction provided by the federation. A $473,873 contract for immigrant job search assistance may not be renewed when it expires March 31, 2010, although a final decision on this has not been made. Stewart's letter included a statement from Kenney justifying the decision to halt funding. Kenney wrote that the decision not based solely on Mouammar's description of him as a \\"professional whore\\" but rather that: > Serious concerns have arisen with respect to certain public statements that > have been made by yourself or other officials of the CAF. These statements > have included the promotion of hatred, anti-Semitism and support for the > banned terrorist organizations Hamas and Hezbollah. The objectionable nature > of these public statements in that they appear to reflect the CAF's evident > support for terrorist organizations and positions on its part which are > arguably anti-Semitic raises serious questions about the integrity of your > organization and has undermined the government's confidence in the CAF as an > appropriate partner for the delivery of settlement services to > newcomers.Government cuts off Arab federation funding, National Post, March > 19, 2009. In late March 2009, the CAF announced that it is filing a court challenge against Kenney over his decision to revoke the CAF's federal funding. The CAF court documents stated that Kenney's decision erred in law by breaching an agreement to fund the language programs and also breached the principle of fairness. The CAF is asking the Court to quash the decision and, in the interim, for an injunction to keep the funding coming while the case is heard.

In a later interview, CAF executive director Mohamed Boudjenane stated that Mouammar's comment was misconstrued, explaining that: > A political whore, in the Oxford dictionary, is someone who is willing to > sell his political principles for gain. It has nothing to do with the > derogatory term. Court ruling on denial of funding In January 2014, Federal Court Justice Russel Zinn upheld the government's decision to halt funding to the CAF. In denying the CAF's challenge to the Government's decision, Zinn wrote that > All of the statements and actions raised by the Minister can, in my view, > reasonably lead one to the view that CAF appears to support organizations > that Canada has declared to be terrorist organizations and which are > arguably anti-Semitic.\\" The government had cited six incidents to support > its claims against the CAF; although the CAF insisted that none of these > incidents had been authorized or approved by the organization, Zinn ruled > that \\"this defense ignores the maxim that ‚Äòone is known by the company one > keeps. Zinn also wrote that \\"the CAF cannot completely disassociate itself from the content of web links it includes in its materials, or from comments, distribution of materials, or attendances at meetings and conference by its executives.\\" The court also rejected the CAF's argument that Kenney decision was motivated by the CAF's advocacy for the Palestinians.Federal Court upholds government stopping funding to Canadian Arab Federation over concerns it appears to support terrorist organizations by Stewart Bell, January 7, 2014.Court approves de-funding of Canadian Arab Federation by Paul Lungen, Canadian Jewish News, January 9, 2014.Jason Kenney‚Äôs decision to cut funding to the Canadian Arab Federation was reasonable, court rules by Debra Black, Toronto Star, January 7, 2014. Among the incidents cited was the CAF's decision to honour Zafar Bangash, who the court noted \\"has referred to Canadians as ‚Äòinfidels or non-believers‚Äô in the past and reported on the September 11 attacks in a way that was unsympathetic to the victims.\\" The court also noted that the CAF had linked videos of Hamas operatives and displayed the flags of Hamas and Islamic Jihad on their webside; both organizations are banned in Canada. Several Jewish groups, including B'nai Brith Canada and the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, expressed support for the ruling. Kenney later stated that the ruling was \\"a vindication of common sense\\" and sent a clear message that \\"groups who express apparently hateful views or who defend terrorist organizations should not receive taxpayer funding, period. This is especially true for organizations charged with the integration of newcomers.\\" Following the ruling, CAF national President Dr. Farid Ayad, announced that he would appeal the decision, but declined further comment. Statements by Omar Shaban On June 30, 2009, Omar Shaban, CAF's executive vice-president for Western Canada, allegedly wrote on his Facebook page that Canada was a \\"genocidal state\\" and referred to Canada's national holiday as \\"Fuck Canada Day\\" and added that \\"It's finally Canada Day...Couldn't be more ashamed to be Canadian.\\" The CAF subsequently released issued a press release disassociating itself from Shaban's comments and stating that his words \\"in no way reflect of CAF nor its feelings towards Canada.\\"CAF Disassociates Itself From Recent Comments , CAF Press Release, July 1, 2009.Canadian Arab Federation vice-president under fire for anti- canadian webpost, National Post, July 2, 2009.An Arab Canadian‚Äôs way of celebrating Canada Day , by Tarek Fatah, Averroespress, July 1, 2009.Arab group exec's anti-Canada tirade by Brett Clarksona and Joe Warmington, Sun Media, July 2, 2009.

Opposition to Canada's Membership on the UN Security Council In September 2010, CAF President Khaled Mouammar released a statement (which was later published by Al-Jazeerah), calling for \\"all Arab and Muslim Missions at the United Nations to vote against Canada's bid to have a seat at the UN Security Council.\\" Mouammar stated that \\"The evidence has been accumulating about the anti-Arab and anti-Islamic Canadian government [of Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper] to the extent it is feared that if Canada gains a seat in the UN Security Council, it may be used against Arabs and Muslims around the world.\\" Mouammar concluded by stating \\"granting Canada a seat on the UN Security Council would be tantamount to rewarding Canada for discriminating against Arab and Muslim Canadians, and for its unconditional and blatant support for Israel‚Äôs war crimes and violations of international law.\\"Evidence Accumulating About the Anti-Arab, Anti-Islamic Canadian Government by Khaled Mouammar, Al-Jazeerah, September 27, 2010. In addition, Mouammar also circulated an email which linked to an article in The Tyee by author Murray Dobbin, which accused Canada, among other things, of working closely with Colombia, which is \\"virtually a U.S. military base,\\" and that Canadian rescue efforts in Haiti following the 2010 Haiti earthquake are in fact a \\"neo-colonial effort.\\" Matt Gurney, writing in the National Post, criticised the CAF endorsing Dobbin's \\"anti-Canadian position\\" and wrote that \\"Dobbin‚Äôs anti-Canadian views are music to their [the CAF's] ears.\\"Matt Gurney: Canadian Arab Federation casts its vote against Canada by Matt Gurney, National Post, October 12, 2010.

Originally the mascot of Marvel's Not Brand Echh, he is the alter-ego of Irving Forbush, a fictional employee of \\"Marble Comics\\" (a parody of Marvel). Forbush was devised in 1955 by Marvel editor Stan Lee to refer to an imaginary low-grade colleague who was often the butt of Lee's jokes. In his guise of Forbush-Man, he first appeared in 1967. According to Marvel Comics' Alternate Universes 2005, Forbush Man is a native of Earth 665, as opposed to Marvel's regular Earth-616. Publication history Irving Forbush was introduced in Marvel's short-lived satirical comic book Snafu as a mascot. Forbush was given a line in the magazine's content page where he was credited as Snafu's founder.Lee, Stan. \\"Bullpen Bulletins: Stan's Soapbox,\\" Marvel Two-in-One #49 (Marvel Comics, Mar. 1979). Another Forbush family member, Melvin, was mentioned in the letters column reference, \\"Losted [sic] by his cousin, Melvin Forbush\\". During Snafu's three-issue run, starting in November 1955, the \\"actual face\\" of Irving Forbush was often shown, though this face was of someone not named Irving Forbush. Forbush-Man first appeared on the cover of the first issue of the satirical Not Brand Echh (cover-dated Aug. 1967), drawn by Jack Kirby and featuring Doctor Doom, the Fantastic Four and the Silver Surfer cowering in fear as Forbush Man approaches. Forbush-Man is a wannabe superhero with no superpowers who wears a costume comprising red long johns with the letter F on the front and a cooking pot with eye-holes on his head. Forbush-Man's first major appearance was in the lead story of Not Brand Echh #5 (Dec. 1967): \\"The Origin of Forbush-Man\\", which was \\"conceived, created and cluttered-up\\" by Lee and Kirby. In this story, Forbush-Man's secret identity is revealed as Irving Forbush, the fictitious office gofer at Marble Comics. The character has a shrewish maiden aunt (Auntie Mayhem) who is indirectly responsible for her nephew becoming a superhero: In a fit of pique, she slams the fabled cooking pot over Irving's head, inadvertently providing him with the disguise he'd been looking for. The fictional October 13, 1939, edition of the Daily Bugle claims an \\"Irving Forbush\\" was born on Friday the 13th, his parents Stan and Jacqueline wanting a daughter instead. Like his better-known Marvel contemporaries, Forbush-Man triumphs over a number of super powered adversaries, starting with 'The Juggernut' in Not Brand Echh #5. All of his victories are purely accidental; lacking superhuman powers, dumb luck plays a major role in all his adventures. Forbush-Man's next appearance came in Not Brand Echh #8 (June 1968), when he applies for membership with the Avengers parody the Revengers, the S.H.I.E.L.D. parody S.H.E.E.S.H, and finally the X-Men parody The Echhs-Men. His third major appearance came in Not Brand Ecch #13 (May 1969, the comic's final issue), which finds him in a loose parody of Silver Surfer #5 (April 1969). Writer Lee himself puts in an appearance as Marble Comics' \\"Fearless Leader\\" in the final two panels.  Continued references  On page 3 of Fantastic Four Annual #3 (1965) while Patsy Walker and her rival Hedy Wolfe eye Tony Stark and search for Millie the Model as the crowd gathers for the wedding of Reed Richards and Sue Storm, chants of \\"We Want Irving Forbush, We Want Irving Forbush\\" are seen in the background. He is mentioned by Spider-Man in The Amazing Spider-Man #35 (April 1966) as what Spider-Man calls an in-joke. When Molten Man tells Spider-Man that when he beats him, nobody would stop him, Spider-Man remarks, \\"There's always Irving Forbush\\". In the 1978 instructional paperback How To Draw Comics The Marvel Way, Chapter Five focuses on drawing a humanoid figure. The introduction states, \\"...Most anyone can draw a stick figure. (Even Irving Forbush!)\\"Lee, Stan and Buscema, John. How To Draw Comics the Marvel Way (Marvel Fireside Books, 1978). . In the early 1990s, when Comics Buyer's Guide begin their annual fan awards, Marvel came up with its own award for assistant editors as they were ineligible for the CBG awards. Some ballots, which appeared on Marvel's letters pages, listed Forbush as a choice for top assistant editor. Later appearances  During the 1980s and 1990s, Forbush Man became the mascot of the Marvel Age news magazine for much of its nine-year run. He also was a staple cast member in the satirical title What The?!, an ensemble book that encompassed and poked fun at the Marvel Universe. In 1993, What The?! published a story chronicling the death of Forbush Man. The story was a parody of DC Comics' \\"Death of Superman\\" story arc, and featured Forbush Man dying in battle against the villain Dumsday, a parody of DC's Doomsday. Forbush Man appeared in the 2006 series Nextwave: Agents of H.A.T.E. as a member of \\"The New Paramounts\\", a team consisting of Not Brand Echh characters including The Inedible Bulk. These characters were either misguided or evil. Forbush Man was willing to hurt others for mocking his hat. This Forbush Man was apparently killed by Tabitha Smith after he failed to mind control her (she apparently had no mind). Nextwave and the Beyond Corporation¬© exist within the mainstream Marvel Universe. Forbush Man later appeared in the 2010 one-shot \\"Captain America: Who Won't Wield the Shield\\". He attacks and injures several Marvel employees, angered they have turned comics grim and dark. In defense of the injured people, Forbush is slain. Moments later, he returns as a flesh hungry zombie. Powers and abilities While the original Forbush Man had no superpowers, the Forbush Man who appeared in Nextwave (who may or may not have been a Broccoli Man) had the power to project utterly realistic visions (credited as \\"Forbush-vision\\") into the minds of others when he removed the cast-iron pot on his head. The hallucinations typically depicted a reality that was hellish to each victim, slowly killing them as they struggled against it. This power had no effect on Tabitha Smith as, in Nextwave, she has no apparent mind at all. It is also possible that he has powers far beyond this: he cites during his recruitment to the New Paramounts several occasions on which he claims to have saved the Earth from certain doom so quickly and efficiently that nobody realized he'd done anything. He also purports to be \\"mighty with women,\\" though whether this is one of his many powers is debatable. Forbush Man even goes so far as to purport that he is \\"the greatest power in human history\\", although the veracity of these claims is unverified, and Tabitha Smith defeated him with apparently very little effort. Other versions During the DC/Marvel Amalgam Universe crossover, Irving Forbush was fused with DC's AL to form Al Forbush, proprietor of Lobo the Duck's favorite diner in the series' parody installment. He wears Forbush Man's trademark cooking pot with eye holes on his head. In other media Television * Forbush Man is referenced in The Super Hero Squad Show episode \\"Tales of Suspense\\".

The name \\"French Rock\\" dates back to India's Pre-Independence days, the place was used as the camping ground by the French army, which came to help Tippu Sultan in his war against the British. It is believed that French named the small town as \\"French Rocks\\", as the town is in the vicinity of two rocky hills. After Indian Independence, these rocky hills called as \\"Kunti Betta\\" by locals. There was another smaller hill called \\"Kauravara betta\\" on the western side of the town which has been mined out of existence for its stones. Pandavapura is approximately 130 km from Bangalore and 25 km from Mysore.  About the Town  Pandavapura town is surrounded by beautiful paddy and sugar cane fields. Agriculture is the main occupation around the town. The town is surrounded by many villages and the town is the central point for farmers everyday business. Every Thursday, a farmer's market (called as \\"Santhe\\" in Kannada) is held in the heart of the town, where farmers directly sell their agricultural products. Apart from agricultural products, you can also find handicrafts, ayurvedic products etc., Surrounding villages have Jaggery manufacturing units and it is a nice experience to watch the process of making Jaggery out of sugar cane. The Visweswarayya Canal (VC Canal) flows in the heart of the town, by dividing the town into two halves. The water for this canal is sourced from the Krishnaraja Sagar (KRS), which is Reservoir across the river Cauvery.  Harohalli French Cemetery  There is a French cemetery in Harohalli, in the outskirts of Pandavapura, where the French who came to aid Tipu Sultan are buried. The beautiful cemetery is more than 250 years old, has fallen into neglect and vandalism. The French soldiers and family members mostly died from malaria, fatigue or in battle. The land for the French cemetery was granted by Tippu Sultan. Only 35 graves remain, most in a bad state. Iron grilles, bricks, metal plaques and expensive marble have been removed from the graves, and many have no headstone.  Transport  Pandavapura railway station Pandavapura is well connected by trains and buses. Most of the trains which run between Bangalore and Mysore stop in Pandavapura. The Pandavapura railway station is 4 km away from the town. There are very few direct buses runs from Bengaluru to Pandavapura. However, travelers from Bengaluru can reach Mandya town by bus, and change for a Pandavapura bus at the Mandya KSRTC bus stand. The train is the best and easiest mode of transportation to Pandavapura from Bangalore. .  Tourism  Pandavapura town is surrounded by well-known tourist spots. Following are tourist spots: 1\\\\.

S.) is a mystic society founded in 1843 in Mobile, Alabama (during Mobile's first American period) Mobile's Mardi Gras history spans over 300 years, as customs changed with the ruling nations: Mobile was the capital of French Louisiana in 1702, then British in 1763, then Spanish in 1780, entered the Republic of Alabama, was declared American in 1812 (captured in 1813), a U.S. state in 1819, then Confederate in 1860, then became American again in 1865. and participated in Carnival during New Year's Eve and New Year's Day celebrations. It is the oldest remaining mystic society in America but no longer hosts an annual parade.  History  The Strikers Independent Society was formed initially by young men in Mobile who had been refused membership to the older Cowbellion de Rakin Society (which had been formed in year 1830 by \\"more sedate and astute men of the city\\"). In the beginning, it was designated as a bachelor-only society, and if a member married, then they were out of the society. The Strikers, like the Cowbellions, paraded only on New Year's Eve and held their ball on New Year's Day. In 1852, they became the first mystic society to hold a ball at the Battle House Hotel. By 1881, the Strikers Independent Society had discontinued their annual street parades, but continued to hold a grand ball on New Year's Eve, though in 1884, they paraded once more. In 1902, their theme was \\"Colonial Mobile\\" celebrating the bicentennial of Mobile's founding (1702). Members wore costumes representing the French, British, Spanish, and American periods of Mobile's history.  Offshoots in New Orleans  Just as New Orleans became the capital of French Louisiana (Louisianne) about twenty years (1723) after Mobile (1702), the mystic societies of New Orleans were created by Mobile society members about 20 years after the original Mobile societies had been founded: * 1850: Joseph Ellison, a Mobile Cowbellion, is one of six Mobilians who moved to New Orleans and organized the Crescent City‚Äôs first mystic societies; Ellison forms \\"The Mystick Krewe of Comus\\" in New Orleans (1850). * 1870: Sidney Smith, the son of a Striker (in Mobile), organized the \\"Twelfth Night Revelers\\" in New Orleans, nearly 30 years after the Strikers Independent Society was formed in Mobile. The other mystic societies had a reciprocal effect in Mobile from New Orleans, when they paraded in 1865 while Mobile parades had been discontinued due to the Civil War, for they inspired Joe Cain to return to Mobile, in the midst of the Union Army occupation, and revive the Mardi Gras celebration in Mobile, where it had started back in 1703.

He composed it in Leipzig for the second Sunday after Epiphany and first performed it on 20 January 1726.  History and words  Bach wrote the cantata in his third year in Leipzig for the Second Sunday after Epiphany. The prescribed readings for the Sunday were taken from the Epistle to the Romans, we have several gifts (), and from the Gospel of John, the Marriage at Cana (). The text is taken from Georg Christian Lehms' annual of cantatas, published in Darmstadt in 1711. The single idea from the gospel is the word of Jesus: \\"Mine hour is not yet come\\". The text is divided into two parts of three movements each, the first dealing with the distress of someone feeling abandoned, the second with hope for God's help. Both parts are closed by a chorale. Movement 3 is the second stanza of Johann Heermann's hymn \\"\\", the closing chorale is the final stanza of Paul Fleming's \\"\\". According to Alfred D√ºrr, it is unlikely that they were performed before and after the service, considering the brevity of the work.  Scoring and structure  The cantata in six movements is intimately scored for four soloists, soprano (S), alto (A), tenor (T), and bass (B), a four-part choir (SATB) in the chorales, two recorders (Fl), oboe da caccia (Oc), two violins (Vl), viola (Va), and basso continuo. The continuo is playing throughout.  Music  The cantata is opened by an aria, a lamento accompanied by soft recorders and the dark sound of the oboe da caccia which leads frequently. It is a da capo form, but the middle section is again divided in two parts. In it, the voice shows the \\"\\" (road to death) by several downward steps. D√ºrr points out that this composition \\"illustrates how the imagination of the Baroque musician is particularly fired by texts dealing with sighing and pain\\". The following short secco recitative ends as an arioso on the words \\"\\" (plead in vain). In the chorale, the woodwinds play the cantus firmus in unison with the alto voice, while the strings play independent figuration in F major, illustrating hope, although the text says that hope is not yet in sight. John Eliot Gardiner terms it \\"confident diatonic harmonies\\" as an \\"optimistic, wordless answer\\" to the voice's \\"prayer for comfort\\". A second expressive recitative leads to a second aria, which is accompanied by violin I and the recorders, playing in unison an octave higher. The lamenting text of the beginning \\"\\" (groaning and pitiful weeping) is stressed by intervals such as augmented second, diminished fifth and diminished seventh. The ritornello has two distinctly different parts, a lamenting section and a hopeful one, full of fast runs and passages. In the middle section, the text \\"\\" (he who looks towards heaven) is accented by an octave leap upwards in the voice and upwards runs in the instruments, contrasting the downward line in movement 1. The closing chorale is a four-part setting of the melody of \\"\\" by Heinrich Isaac, which is featured twice in Bach's St Matthew Passion in movements 10 () and 37 ().

Economics Pandhurna is a typical Indian village with farming as the major occupation. Many farmers grow oranges and cotton as the Kharif crop since the black soil is suitable for its production. Other crops are soybean, groundnut, cauliflower, gram and wheat. The village also has a few oil and cotton mills and food processing plants, as well as many cotton ginning and pressing factories. Pandhurna is basically surrounded by Vidharbha, so the local language is Marathi. Ppandhurna is also known for orange farms; oranges are sold in the markets of Nagpur. Villages like Teegaon and Marud are the major producers of oranges. Gotmar Gotmar literally means stone throwing ('got' = stone and 'mar' = beat). \\"Gotmar Mela\\" was celebrated every year on the second day of Bhadrapad, which is New Moon day, on the banks of the Jam River. A long tree was erected in the middle of the river with a flag at its very top. The residents of the villages of Savargaon and Pandhurna gathered on either bank of the river, and started pelting stones at the persons of the opposite village who tried to cross into the middle of the river and remove the flag on top of the tree trunk. The village whose resident succeeds in removing the flag would be considered victorious. The whole activity happened amidst the chanting of the sacred name of \\"Maa Durgaji.\\" People were often left either dead or injured, so the festival was banned in 2009 and 2011, after failed attempts in 2001 and 2002 to get the villagers to use rubber balls instead of stones.

History College of the Mainland was launched in late 1966 when the voters of Dickinson, Hitchcock, La Marque, Santa Fe, and Texas City approved a building-bond issue of $2,850,000, having been largely an idea since 1935. Herbert F. Stallworth, who previously had helped establish two colleges, was selected to head the new college in April 1967, and Fred A. Taylor was appointed dean of instruction. Classes were begun in temporary quarters in 1967. On March 21, 1970, the administration building, learning-resources center, math and science building, and technical-vocational building were completed, and the College of the Mainland moved to its new campus on Palmer Highway. On May 16, 1970, residents of the college district approved $4,750,000 for a second phase of construction. The campus was expanded to include a fine arts building, a physical education complex, and a student center. The math-science and technical-vocational buildings were improved.

Parangipettai is located on the north bank of the mouth of the Vellar river at a distance of 30 km from Cuddalore. From the state capital city of Chennai, Parangipettai can be reached through the National Highway NH45A stretch between Cuddalore and Chidambaram. Due to its strategic location on the Coromandel Coast, Parangipettai has long been a major trading centre. In particular, it was an important trading destination for the Arabs, especially the Yemenis. During the colonial era the Portuguese, Dutch and then the English successively colonized the area. The first iron and steel industry in India was constructed in Porto Novo in the year 1830. Even today the iron pillars at the Egmore railway station in Chennai, Tamil Nadu have the imprint ' Made in Porto Novo'. There is also a Gandhian connection to this place. Anne Marie Petersen became in 1909 a missionary in the so-called Loventhal Mission. The foundation stone was laid by Gandhi himself in 1921, and a few years later the school was officially opened under the name Seva Mandir at a place called Porto Novo, near Chidambaram in Tamil Nadu, South India. Today, Parangipettai has evolved into a well-developed town with nearly all basic necessities such as healthcare, education and transport. It also hosts a Marine Biology Station affiliated with the Annamalai University. Parangipettai is an important pilgrimage centre for both Muslims and Hindu. History Porto Novo Iron Works, 1848 Memorial for the Battle of Porto Novo, 1781 at Porto Novo Through history, Parangipettai has taken many different names. During the Portuguese rule it was - 'Porto Novo'. During the period of the Nayyakar rule it was renamed Muthukrishna Puri and then 'Mohammed Banthar' during the era of the Mughal Empire. In Tamil, Parangiar refers to Europeans, while Pettai means place. Thus, Parangipettai literally translates to the abode of the parangiars or Europeans in Tamil. Parangipettai finds mention in Classic Tamil literature as \\"Varunapuri\\", meaning the place where the rain god Varuna had worshipped Lord Shiva (still today this is a place known for its rainfall). The Portuguese were the ones who actually named this place \\"Porto Novo\\" (\\"New Port\\" in Portuguese) as they set up a port here and made it their trading stronghold. Muslims living in Parangipettai have a unique ancestry. Tamil is their mother tongue but it has been heavily influenced by Urdu and Arabic. Previously, especially during the Tamil Chola rule of Tamil Nadu, Arab traders used to heavily trade around the Coromandel coast in which Parangipettai is located. Some traders, throughout time decided to settle down here. And hence, Muslims of Parangipettai tend to resemble Arab features. During the Muslim rule of India under the Mughal Empire, Muslims from Hyderabad began settling in Parangipettai. Thus the Islamic culture in Parangipettai was influenced by Urdu and Mughal practices. In 1733, the Swedish East India Company established a factory in Porto Novo though after a month it was destroyed by the British and the French. A large trace of the Hyderabad people are found in Singapore and Malaysia. In 1801 Sir George Leith, who was then Lieutenant Governor of Penang,Malaysia, appointed a prominent Indian Muslim leader, Cauder Mohudeen, as Captain of the South Indian \\"Keling\\" community. He granted a piece of land to build a mosque on the south side of Malabar Street (Chulia Street).at penang now the mosque known as yusof kapittan mosque(monument of Malaysia) Cauder Mohudeen (born c. 1759) was a ship mandoor or foreman from Porto Novo, which the Tamils called Parangipettai. The Battle of Porto Novo was fought here in 1781 during the Second Anglo-Mysore War. The conflict pitted the forces of the Kingdom of Mysore under Karim Khan Sahib, accompanied by his father Hyder Ali, against forces belonging to the British East India Company under Sir Eyre Coote. Though they were outnumbered 5 to 1, the British prevailed. The town flourished as a sea port with connections to southeast Asia and as an industrial centre during British rule, when iron made here was exported to England. The powerful Nawab of Arcot had his mint at Porto Novo and the gold coins struck in this mint came to be called the Porto Novo Pagoda. Later the English followed the same design when they minted the 'Negapatam' (Nagapatnam) Pagoda; the Dutch minted their coin in the same design at Tuticorin and Colombo mints. There is a Gandhian connection also. A European disciple of Mahatma Gandhi established a school, \\"Seva mandhir\\", based on Gandhian principles. In early 1875 Meir was born to later lead the great revolution to appoint hockey as the National Sport of India. Climate Religion in Parangipettai Parangipettai is an wonderful example for Religious harmony. People of various faiths live together in peace. Muslims and Hindus forms the nearly equal population. Christians also live along with in harmony. Among the Muslims there are clans or family groups which holds no major bar while social interactions like marriages and mutual livings. Some of them are Maraicars, Sahibs, Ravuthtars, Pattans. The most common being Maraicar. Maraicar the name said to have derived from the old Tamil term Marakkalangalin aayargal meaning Kings of Ships a Title said to be given by the Southern Tamil King Vijaya Raghunadha Sedhupathy Thondamaan (shortly King Sethu) to the Arab traders from Yemen and Arabia now Saudi Arabia who were then reigning the most of the coastal areas with their trade. (ref. Book : Maritime history of Coromendal Muslims by Raja Mohammed, Govt. Mueseum Publication) The First and only book about the Muslims of Parangipettai was written in Tamil and published by Jenifah Academy on December 2017.

There are two main holidays in Islam: Eid al- Fitr, Ramadan and Eid al-Adha. Eid al-Fitr is celebrated at the end of Ramadan (a month of fasting), and Muslims usually give zakat (charity) on the occasion. Eid al-Adha is celebrated at the end of Hajj (the annual pilgrimage to Mecca), which is one of the Five Pillars of Islam, and Muslims usually sacrifice an animal and distribute its meat among family, friends and the poor. All Islamic holidays follow the lunar calendar, and thus move each year relative to the solar calendar. The Islamic calendar has 12 months and 354 days on a regular year, and 355 days on a leap year.

Prior to that he was best known from various independent promotions as one half of a masked tag team with Frank Vizi known as The Texas Hangmen, where he portrayed Killer alongside Vizi's Psycho. Professional wrestling career Beninghaus began his career as a masked wrestler, part of a team of masked wrestlers known as \\"the Texas Hangmen\\", with Beninghaus being billed either as \\"Texas Hangman #2\\" or as \\"Killer\\". Beninghaus teamed with Frank Vizi, who was known as \\"Texas Hangman #1\\" or \\"Psycho\\" as the two competed all over the independent circuit. Their ring character, or gimmick, included them wearing executioners' hoods to hide their faces bringing hangman's nooses with them to the ring and at times using them on their opponents during or after matches. In 1990 the Texas Hangmen wrestled in Puerto Rico for the World Wrestling Council (WWC), including defeating Los Super M√©dicos (Super M√©dico I and Super M√©dico III) to win the WWC World Tag Team Championship on September 29, 1990. The duo lost the championship to El Bronco and Invader I on February 3, 1991 but regained them a week later. The end of their second title run on March 2 at the hands of El Bronco and Invader I also marked the end of their tour with WWC. The Texas Hangmen next turned up in the United States Wrestling Association (USWA) where they defeated the team of Jeff Jarrett and Jerry Lawler to win the USWA Tag Team Championship. Their run ended 48 days later when Jarrett and Robert Fuller defeated them to take the titles off them. In 1996 the two returned to WWC to win the WWC Tag Team Championship for a third time when they defeated Ray Gonz√°lez and Ricky Santana. 161 days later Santana and a wrestler known as \\"La Ley\\" ended the Texas Hangmen's run at the top of the WWC tag team division. In 1996 and 1997 Benninghaus worked for Big Japan Pro Wrestling under various masked identities, including Grey Skull and Mighty Kodiak. In 1997 Beninghaus took on Mike Moran as his partner and began working for World Championship Wrestling (WCW), in WCW he was renamed \\"Tough Tom\\" while his partner became \\"Mean Mike\\", collectively known as \\"Disorderly Conduct\\". On occasion, Beninghaus and Moran would take on the guises of The Texas Hangmen, with Beninghaus again playing Killer while Moran took on the role of Psycho. The duo mainly worked to help other teams look good, especially younger talent, with the highlight of their time in WCW being an unsuccessful challenge for the WCW World Tag Team Championship, losing to champions The Steiner Brothers (Rick Steiner and Scott Steiner) on an episode of Monday Nitro.

Political views Khaldi said there is still a long way to go before the Bedouin minority achieves full equality in Israel but the situation is improving, and more Bedouins are graduating from high school, entering universities and getting better jobs than ever before. \\"There are differences in tradition and religion between us, but at the end of the day we are all Israeli citizens\\". He considers himself a proud Bedouin and regards a Jewish state as beneficial to his community. He says it is through the alliance with Israel that the Bedouins have begun to transcend the isolation created by their nomadic traditions.

It continues from that point concurrent with I-985 for the entire length of that freeway. Eventually, U.S. Route 23 (US 23) also joins the concurrency. The highway heads northeast through Gainesville and Toccoa, before it terminates at the South Carolina state line, southwest of Westminster, South Carolina. Route description Gwinnett County In Gwinnett County, SR 365 begins concurrent with I-985 at an interchange with I-85 on the southeastern edge of Suwanee. The two highways head northeast to Buford, at an interchange with US 23/SR 20 (Buford Drive N.E.). Here, US 23 joins the concurrency. Hall County The three routes head northeast into Hall County and have an interchange with SR 347\\\\. In Flowery Branch they have an interchange with Spout Springs Road at the Rankin Smith Interchange. Then they enter Oakwood, and have an interchange with SR 53 (Mundy Mill Road); access to SR 53 from southbound I-985/US 23/SR 365 is handled by the next junction. Just after that interchange, they enter Gainesville, where they have an interchange with SR 13 (Atlanta Highway); this interchange has access to both SR 13 and SR 53\\\\.

US 129/SR 11 heads south toward Jefferson, while US 129 joins the concurrency through the rest of the city. Meanwhile, US 129 Business/SR 11 heads north into the heart of Gainesville. Nearly later US 129 departs the concurrency to the north with SR 369 on Jesse Jewell Parkway. About later, I-985 ends, while US 23/SR 365 continues north. This segment of US 23/SR 365 is an example of an unfinished freeway.

The road then intersects Ramsey Road and White Sulphur Road, the latter of which connects the communities of White Sulphur to the north and White Sulphur Springs to the south. East of there, it passes a Kubota RTV manufacturing plant, and a cold storage warehouse. The road runs over a pair or railroad bridges over the same Southern Railway line it got close to in Duluth before the intersection with Cagle Road.

After leaving Toccoa, the two highways continue to the northeast until they meet SR 365's northern terminus, the South Carolina state line at the Tugaloo River, southwest of Westminster, South Carolina, where US 123 continues toward the town. National Highway System Except for the extreme northern section, all of SR 365 is included as part of the National Highway System, a system of roadways important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility. History 1920s The roadway that would eventually become SR 365 was built in 1920 as SR 13 from Buford to the South Carolina state line, along the same alignment as it travels today. A reconfiguration of the SR 13 and SR 15 intersection in the Baldwin‚ÄìCornelia area, caused the two routes to travel concurrently between the two cities. By the end of 1926, a small section in Gainesville was paved. By 1929, US 23 was designated along the section from Buford to Gainesville. 1930s and 1940s By 1932, US 23 was designated along the route all the way to Cornelia. In addition, the entire route, from Buford to the South Carolina state line, was paved. The next month, US 23, and possibly SR 13 was extended south from Buford. In 1935, after a long series of improvement projects the section just south of Buford was paved. Between 1946 and 1948, US 123 entered the state, being routed on a concurrency with SR 13 between Toccoa and the state line. Prior to April 1949, US 123's concurrency with SR 13 was extended to Cornelia. During this time, US 441 was extended along SR 15, thus beginning a concurrency with SR 13. 1950s‚Äì1970s Between 1955 and 1957, a freeway (presumably I-85) was under construction from northeast Atlanta northeast to Suwannee, paralleling US 23/SR 13. Between 1957 and 1960, I-85 was completed as far north as what is now known as SR 317, which is located just southwest of what is now the southern terminus of I-985/SR 365, and by 1966, it was completed northeast of Atlanta within the state. In 1966, SR 365 was being projected as a freeway from its current southern terminus northeast and curving around the southeastern side of Gainesville. In 1969, the whole freeway section, with the exception of the southernmost portion from I-85 to US 23/SR 20, was completed. Also, the entire completed section was designated as SR 365. The next year, the southernmost segment was completed. By 1979, the SR 365 freeway was listed as \\"under construction\\" from the northern terminus of the freeway northeast to US 23/US 441/SR 15 near Cornelia. 1980s and 1990s Between 1980 and 1982, SR 365 was extended along the \\"under construction\\" section, but it was not a freeway. Also, US 23/SR 13 from Gainesville to Cornelia was moved onto this new highway. By 1986, the entire freeway segment was designated as I-985. In 1988, SR 365 was proposed to be extended to a point southwest of Toccoa. In 1991, SR 13 was decommissioned north of Gainesville. SR 365 was extended to the South Carolina state line. Major intersections Habersham County spur route State Route 365 Spur (SR 365 Spur) was a spur route of SR 365 that was proposed in 1988 to travel from the SR 365 mainline west-northwest of Toccoa to US 23/US 441/SR 15/SR 17 in Hollywood. In 1991, it was built, but was only as an eastward re-routing of SR 15 and possibly US 23.

Many Swedes came to Argentina for economic reasons and in order to start a new life. Swedes also helped build Argentina, in particular helping to build Argentina's railroads in the mid 19th century. The first Swedes to arrive in Argentina were registered as new converts by Jesuits in C√≥rdoba in 1763. Many of the Swedes who showed up during the first half of the 19th century were adventurers who fought in the civil war between the Unitarians and Federalists (on both sides). A good number of them were sons of prominent families who were fleeing a debt or had some other reason to make themselves scarce. They became the black sheep of the Pampas. Back home in northern Sweden, they had hunted moose. In Misiones Province's subtropical rainforest, they hunted tapir. Argentina is home to the largest Swedish community in Latin America. History In 1845 Sweden formally recognized Argentine sovereignty and shortly afterwards the warships Lagerbjelke and Eugenie paid a visit to the new country while also checking out trade routes on the South American continent. They happened to arrive in Buenos Aires just in time for the rebellion against Governor Juan Manuel de Rosas. But the travel accounts written by two naval officers aboard were as much, if not more, about the beautiful porte√±a women of Buenos Aires, as they were about the dramatic political events taking place. Misiones Swedes Swedes were drawn to the province Misiones at the beginning of the 20th century, at the prospect of growing yerba mate, used to make the herbal tea that is Argentina's national addiction. They moved from Brazil, where they had been lured by German-based recruitment offices. The new arrivals to Brazil soon discovered that the recruitment officers propaganda was nothing more than empty promises. Around 1913 word started going around that across the border, in the Argentinian territory of Misiones, the land was more fertile and the government was providing incentives for farmers to grow a profitable cash crop known as the green gold - yerba mate. Two contingents of emigrants made the voyage south. In 1890-91, most of the 2 000 were workers and families from the crisis-ridden industries in Stockholm and Sundsvall. In 1909-11, most of the 700 were miners from the far north who left after the failure of a nationwide strike. The first Swedes to cross the border to Argentina found not only Brazilian, Paraguayan and German colonists, but also a group of Finnish intellectuals who had fled their country in 1906 for political reasons. After the town of Ober√° was officially founded in 1928, the Swedes soon became a minority, but as they had come first there are today neighbourhoods that carry the names of those pioneering farmers - Villa Kindgren, Villa Fredriksson, Villa Erasmie. In 1914 ten men cleared a 20-kilometre path (picada) through the jungle between the first Swedish settlement, Villa Svea and a German colony. The road is still known as the Picada Sueca. Around 500 Swedes were estimated to have settled in the area by the 1920s and they organized a school, an ethnic-based association and a congregation. Swedes in Argentina today In September many Swedish descendants still participate in the Ober√° Immigrants Festival. The Swedish Club The Swedish Club is located in Buenos Aires. It is centrally located in the seven-story Sweden House which also houses the Swedish Embassy and Swedish Argentine Chamber of Commerce. In the Asociaci√≥n Sueca restaurant and bar Swedish lunches are provided. Svenska F√∂reningen was founded in 1898 by a group of Swedish professionals. The Society had several different homes until the Swedish shipping magnate Axel Axelsson Johnson made a substantial donation for a building in 1920. Notable Swedes in Argentina Henrik √Öberg and Carl August Kihlberg Henrik √Öberg (Enrique Aberg)Article on √Öberg in Nordisk Familjebok. and Carl August Kihlberg (Carlos Kihlberg) were the designers of the Presidential Palace of Argentina, the Casa Rosada. They were also appointed as Argentina's first (and only) national architects in 1875; √Öberg also drew the blueprints for various hospitals, the Museum of National History in La Plata, and the Jos√© de San Mart√≠n mausoleum inside Buenos Aires Cathedral on Plaza de Mayo. Scientists Among the first Swedes to step ashore in Argentina were Daniel Solander and Anders Sparrman. They were disciples of botanist Carl von Linn√© and accompanied Captain Cook on his world expeditions to pick exotic flowers and record anomalies. Several other Nordic scientists were drawn to this area at the beginning of the century. Most remembered among them all is the geologist and polar explorer Otto Nordenskj√∂ld who, along with his crew, survived two winters in Antarctica after a shipwreck. The Argentine government pulled off a successful rescue expedition in 1903. Thousands of people in Buenos Aires celebrated the return of the marine officials and the Swedish scientists. Today the vessel used in the rescue, the corvette Uruguay, is a floating museum in Dock 1 of Puerto Madero. Gustaf de Laval Gustaf de Laval patented the milk separator that separated cream from milk in 1878. When former sea captain Erik Adde started marketing the Separadora in Argentina, less than one percent of the cows were being milked. Cattle was synonymous with meat and hides and Argentina imported dairy products like butter and cheese from Denmark and France. The Swedish inventor spurred the birth of an Argentine dairy industry and the first salted butter to be exported to England was called La Escandinava and was produced by three Swedes. The Addes Pavilion at the La Rural Fairground Exhibition in 1886 also showcased Sandvik steel, paper samples and Eskilstuna knives, and marked the kick-off for Swedish exports to Argentina. Sweden's industrial giants - Asea (ABB), Ericsson, AGA etc. - were in many cases initially represented by individuals, young entrepreneurs who settled down and set up companies in Buenos Aires, Rosario, Santa Fe and C√≥rdoba. In 1900 10% of Argentina's engineers were from Sweden. Evert Taube For many people in Sweden, Argentina is both a familiar and a mythological place brought to life by the lyrics of the popular singer-songwriter Evert Taube who lived in the South American country for five years between 1910-1915. Contrary to widespread perceptions, Taube did not work as a gaucho (cowboy) on the Pampas but as a foreman supervising workers who were digging canals designed to prevent flooding on the vast plains. David Emanuel Wahlberg David Emanuel Wahlberg was a Swedish sports writer and editor who covered the 1912 Summer Olympics and became president of the sports organization LAIF from 1937 to 1939. In 1923 he became a pastor in Buenos Aires, Argentina. On September 15, 1927, his wife Jenny Katarina W√•gberg died and on February 28, 1929 he left Argentina with his four children and returned to Sweden where he married his housekeeper, Bertha Debora Engstr√∂m. He worked for a few different congregations until 1936 when he moved to L√•ngsele. King Carl XVI Gustaf King Carl XVI Gustaf has made several private visits to Argentina in recent years. The King and Queen make visits to neighbouring Brazil, but the visits to Argentina have been to check on large tracts of undervalued land that the King has acquired during the last few years. His ancestor Jean Baptiste Bernadotte who became Karl XIV Johan also had an interest in Argentina. It is believed that he sent the soldier Johan Adam Graaner to Argentina in 1816 to find out what his chances were of claiming the throne of a potential Argentine monarchy. Graaner was the only foreigner present at the declaration of independence from Spain, and his questions raised suspicion.

They were active from 1986 to the early 1990s, releasing primarily live albums recorded in Europe. Sharrock's death in 1994 caused the dissolution of the band, though touring had not occurred for several years before his demise. The band is unrelated to the 1970s British jazz fusion band of the same name. History The band was known for its uncompromising musical ferocity, fueled by the band members' confrontational attitudes. Greg Kot wrote that they brought a level of \\"volume and violence that makes most rock bands sound tame.\\"Trouserpress.com Their music was largely improvised; John Dugan wrote \\"Granted, one person's free improvisation is another's tuneless chaos, but Last Exit, due primarily to the skill of its individuals, only infrequently fell off the precipice into the netherworld of arty wanking ... The playing is intricate, wildly adventurous, frequently funny, and, perhaps most important, a tribute to musical democracy in action.\\"[ Allmusic.com] Far louder than most jazz bands (even than most free jazz groups) Last Exit found a modest following among some more open- minded hardcore punk fans. The band released five live albums, one of which contains guest appearances from Herbie Hancock and Akira Sakata. Most of their albums were released on Enemy Records, but the band's sole studio effort, Iron Path, was released on Venture, a sublabel of Virgin Records. Enhanced by Laswell's studio atmospherics, Iron Path found the band somewhat more restrained. It contains less of their blistering live sound, focusing more on studio textures and experiments. Most of Last Exit's albums have been out of print for years; however, in 2005, Atavistic Records's Unheard Music Series reissued K√∂ln.

Plot After serving a five-year prison sentence for marijuana possession, Daniel \\"Poke\\" Jackson returns to his hometown in Texas where he is greeted by the man who convicted him, Sheriff Duke Calley. Poke assures Duke that he will soon be leaving to go to California, but Duke warns Poke that he is under close watch. Poke calls his old girlfriend Mary Lee Carter and arranges a meeting to see their son Kevin, whom he was never met. However, Duke warns him off and Poke discovers that Duke and Mary Lee are now sleeping together. However, Poke visits her anyway to confront her and the two end up making love. Later, Duke arrives at the mansion of county political boss C.J. Crane and is assigned to guard congressman-elect Jesus Mendez, who is scheduled to speak at a barbecue. After Mendez delivers the speech, however, he is shot and killed by a man in a police uniform. Poke watches as Duke kills the assassin, extracts an envelope and hides it in a trashcan. Duke later returns and retrieves the envelope but finds it empty, and concludes that only Poke could have witnessed the incident and taken the contents. An alert goes out to arrest Poke for marijuana possession. Meanwhile, Poke shows his friend and auto mechanic Boogie the $25,000 he found in the envelope. When Duke's deputy Lenny arrives at the garage looking for Poke, Boogie stalls him long enough for Poke to escape on a motorcycle, initiating a police chase. When two deputies are killed in the chase, Poke becomes wanted for murder. Poke asks junk dealer Cloetus for refuge and he agrees. Early the next morning, Boogie collapses at the door, names Duke as his assailant and dies. Poke hides in the back of Cloetus's truck and manages to get through the police cordon and into Mary Lee's house, where he explains Duke's role in the Mendez assassination to her. Poke, Mary Lee and Kevin then escape in a stolen police car. Another chase ensues which ends with Poke driving into a pond and getting captured. While being driven to the police station, Poke tells Lenny about Duke's role in the assassination. Duke retrieves the $25,000 and begins beating Poke, but when Lenny intervenes Poke is able to escape. Crane tells Duke that the sheriff's career is over unless he retrieves the money. Poke and his family reach the home of Bull Parker, a former bootlegger and family friend, who offers to drive them out of state in his truck which has been customized to evade the law. When Bull runs a roadblock another chase begins, during which Bull falls from the truck but tells Poke to drive on without him.

It is best remembered as the group Sting was in before finding stardom with The Police. Biography Keyboardist Gerry Richardson and bassist Sting originally were members of the Newcastle Big Band. Frustrated by the band's lack of ambition and conservative repertoire, and influenced by more modern jazz ensembles like Weather Report and Return to Forever, they decided to form their own group. The band's name came from Hubert Selby Jr.'s novel Last Exit to Brooklyn. The original line-up was drummer Ronnie Pearson (also of the Phoenix Jazzmen), guitarists John Hedley (later replaced by Terry Ellis), Richardson and Sting. The band was a leading act around Newcastle for several years. They released a single in 1975, \\"Whispering Voices/Evensong\\" (two Richardson compositions) on the Wudwink label, and later a tape called First from Last Exit featuring nine original songs. In 1976, Carol Wilson, Head of Richard Branson's music publishing company, saw Last Exit play in the Gosforth Hotel in Newcastle and signed them. Virgin financed the recording of a demo in the Pathway Studios in London. Wilson organised a number of gigs, including Dingwalls, and a double page feature in Sounds and played the demo to every major record label. Most A&R; men liked it but could not see an obvious category to market the band, so no record deal materialised. In 1977, Last Exit moved to London but after a few gigs, half of the band returned to Newcastle, and Sting and Richardson started looking for other jobs. Richardson worked with Billy Ocean's band as musical director, while Sting joined Stewart Copeland and Henri Padovani and formed The Police. Several Last Exit songs were later reworked by Sting, to feature in The Police's and Sting's solo albums: *\\"Night at the Grand Hotel\\" was performed by The Police in their early incarnation in 1977 but never recorded. *\\"I Burn for You\\", \\"The Bed's Too Big Without You\\", and \\"Oh My God\\" were recorded by The Police under the same name, the first being on the Brimstone & Treacle soundtrack, the second on Reggatta de Blanc, and the third on Synchronicity; *\\"Carrion Prince\\", \\"Truth Kills\\", and \\"Savage Beast\\" are early incarnations of \\"Bring on the Night\\" (from Reggatta de Blanc), \\"Truth Hits Everybody\\" (from Outlandos d'Amour), and \\"We Work the Black Seam\\" (from The Dream of the Blue Turtles) respectively; *The lyrics of \\"Fool in Love\\" were reused in The Police song \\"So Lonely\\" (from Outlandos d'Amour). The songs \\"Don't Give Up Your Daytime Job\\" and \\"Don't You Look at Me\\" were considered for The Police album Ghost in the Machine, but were not used. They are, however, available as demos on several bootlegs. In 1996, Sting invited Gerry Richardson to play organ on his album Mercury Falling. In 2003, Richardson formed a band called The Big Idea, with Garry Linsley on sax and Paul Smith on drums. Sting sang as guest vocalist a rendition of Graham Bond's \\"Springtime in the City\\" on the band's second album, This ... Is What We Do (2010).

Early years She was born Margaret Ann Knudsen in Duluth, Minnesota. Her father was Conrad Knudsen, Duluth's fire chief. Her ancestors were Irish and Norwegian.  Stage  Knudsen made her Broadway debut in My Sister Eileen (1940). She replaced Jo Ann Sayers, who had originated the role of a girl who couldn't decide whether to be an actress or get married. Finding herself in that situation in real life, Sayers married a naval officer. The show's producer saw Knudsen working in a stage door canteen and chose her to take over the role.  Film  Knudsen began her film career in 1946 in A Stolen Life opposite Bette Davis. (In a February 15, 1948, newspaper column, entertainment writer Louella Parsons quoted Knudsen saying, \\"My first picture was Shadow of a Woman with Helmut Durante. I played his ex- wife.\\") That same year, she appeared in bit parts in several films including The Big Sleep and Humoresque with Joan Crawford. In 1948, Knudsen ventured into a different genre of film, doing comedy instead of drama and leaving Warner Bros. to do freelance work. She also took vocal lessons from Kay Thompson. Despite appearing in big budget features with established stars, Knudsen's career never took off and she was relegated to smaller roles in B movies. Her last film role was in the 1957 film Istanbul with Errol Flynn. Radio Knudsen played Lois Graves in the radio version of Junior Miss,Terrace, Vincent (1999).

Productions The play premiered on Broadway at the ANTA Washington Square Theatre on January 23, 1964, and closed on May 29, 1964 after 208 performances. Directed by Elia Kazan, who collaborated with Miller on the script, the cast starred Barbara Loden as Maggie and Jason Robards Jr. as Quentin, along with Ralph Meeker as Mickey, Salome Jens as Holga, and an early appearance by Faye Dunaway as Nurse. Barbara Loden, Kazan's wife, won the 1964 Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play, and Jason Robards was nominated for the 1964 Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play. In 1984, the play was revived Off-Broadway at Playhouse 91, where it ran from October 4 to December 2 that year. Directed by John Tillinger, the cast starred Frank Langella and Dianne Wiest. In 2004, the play was revived on Broadway at the American Airlines Theatre in a Roundabout Theatre Company production from June 25 (previews) to September 12 that year. Directed by Michael Mayer, the cast starred Peter Krause and Carla Gugino. The play was nominated for the 2005 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Set Design of a Play (Richard Hoover). Analysis After the Fall, one of Miller's more personal plays, is a thinly veiled personal critique centered on Miller's recent divorce from Marilyn Monroe: the plot takes place inside the mind of Quentin, a New York City Jewish intellectual who decides to reexamine his life in order to determine whether or not he should marry his most recent love, Holga. The play has been roundly criticised for being too similar to Miller's actual life because Maggie's suicide is very similar to that of Miller's former wife, Monroe. In fact, the feelings of the protagonist, Quentin, are often believed to be Miller's own reflections about his failed marriage. For example, according to Sarah Bradford, in her biography America's Queen: The Life of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, ‚ÄúJackie, who had admired Arthur Miller enough to seat him at her table at the Malraux dinner, turned on him for his betrayal of Marilyn in his play After the Fall, which opened in New York on January 23, 1964. For [Jackie Kennedy] loyalty was the ultimate test of character, and in portraying Marilyn as a self-destructive slut whom he had abandoned for her own good, Miller had dismally failed it.‚Äù Although After the Fall remains very unpopular with critics, it is revered in the academic arena as a deep and intellectual play, albeit difficult to follow because it does not follow the conventional sequence of events found in typical works. The play remains one of Miller's less popular works, attributed in part to the non-linear, often surrealistic nature of the plot and setting; all but the initial and final seconds of the play take place in the protagonist's brain, which is reflected by a set comprising a single chair before a concentration camp guard tower, which is surrounded by a giant, winding ramp made up of crevices, pits, and abutments. The plot unfolds over a period of time, and due to the non-linear nature of the story, characters and occurrences appear as the protagonist remembers them. Reflecting the nature of the mind, they often disappear and their stories remain unresolved until later in the play, when they spontaneously reappear again. Frank Rich noted: \\"Quentin is a witness to alarming public and personal catastrophes: the stock market crash, the Holocaust, the McCarthy witchhunts and the self-destruction of a show business idol to whom he is married.\\" Television A television production of the play was shown in December 1974 on NBC. It starred Faye Dunaway, Christopher Plummer, Bibi Andersson, and a young Brooke Shields, and was directed by Gilbert Cates. Arthur Miller wrote the teleplay based upon his original stage play.

As Bishop, he built a preparatory seminary, several high schools, and an orphanage, and reorganized the system of Catholic charities. He was active as an organizer the national level, and chaired the Department of Lay Organizations of the National Catholic Welfare Conference. As a young priest, he sometimes confronted people who claimed to expose evil practices within the Catholic Church. He would ask the alleged former priest or nun to which order he or she belonged and request that he or she recite specific prayers; some questions were posed in Latin.

One of the highest-paid actors in India, he has won many awards, including six Filmfares, four for Best Actor and one each for Best Debut and Best Actor (Critics). Starting in 2012, he appeared in Forbes India Celebrity 100 based on his income and popularity. Roshan has frequently collaborated with his father, Rakesh Roshan. He made brief appearances as a child actor in several films in the 1980s and later worked as an assistant director on four of his father's films. His first leading role was in the box- office success Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai (2000), for which he received several awards. Performances in the 2000 terrorism drama Fiza and the 2001 ensemble melodrama Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... consolidated his reputation but were followed by several poorly received films. The 2003 science fiction film Koi... Mil Gaya, for which Roshan won two Filmfare Awards, was a turning point in his career; he also appeared in its sequels: Krrish (2006) and Krrish 3 (2013). He earned praise for his portrayal of a thief in the 2006 adventure film Dhoom 2, Mughal emperor Akbar in the 2008 historical romance Jodhaa Akbar and a quadriplegic in the 2010 drama Guzaarish. He played the lead in the 2011 drama Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, the 2012 revenge film Agneepath, the 2014 action comedy Bang Bang!, the 2019 biopic Super 30, and the 2019 action thriller War. The lattermost ranks as his highest-grossing release. Roshan has also performed on stage and debuted on television with Just Dance (2011). As a judge on the latter, he became the highest-paid film star on Indian television. He is involved with a number of humanitarian causes, endorses several brands and products and has launched his own clothing line. Roshan was married for fourteen years to Sussanne Khan, with whom he has two children.  Early life and background  Roshan was born on 10 January 1974 in Bombay to a family prominent in Bollywood. He is of Punjabi and Bengali descent on his paternal side. Hrithik's paternal grandmother Ira was a Bengali. His father, film director Rakesh Roshan, is the son of music director Roshanlal Nagrath; his mother, Pinky, is the daughter of producer and director J. Om Prakash. His uncle, Rajesh, is a music composer. Roshan has an older sister, Sunaina, and was educated at the Bombay Scottish School. Although Roshan practices Hinduism, he says that \\"I'm not religious. I don't visit temples. But I hope there is a superpower.\\" Roshan pictured with father Rakesh at the alt=Hrithik Roshan photographed with his father, Rakesh Roshan. Roshan felt isolated as a child; he was born with an extra thumb fused to the one on his right hand, which led some of his peers to avoid him. He has stammered since the age of six; this caused him problems at school, and he feigned injury and illness to avoid oral tests. He was helped by daily speech therapy. Roshan's grandfather, Prakash first brought him on-screen at the age of six in the film Aasha (1980); he danced in a song enacted by Jeetendra, for which Prakash paid him 100. Roshan made uncredited appearances in various family film projects, including his father's production Aap Ke Deewane (1980). In Prakash's Aas Paas (1981), he appeared in the song \\"Shehar Main Charcha Hai\\". The actor's only speaking role during this period came when he was 12; he was seen as Govinda, the title character's adopted son, in Prakash's Bhagwaan Dada (1986). Roshan decided that he wanted to be a full-time actor, but his father insisted that he focus on his studies. In his early 20s, he was diagnosed with scoliosis that would not allow him to dance or perform stunts. Initially devastated, he eventually decided to become an actor anyway. Around a year after the diagnosis, he took a chance by jogging on a beach when he was caught in a downpour. There was no pain, and becoming more confident, he was able to increase his pace with no adverse effects. Roshan sees this day as \\"the turning point of [his] life.\\" Roshan attended Sydenham College, where he took part in dance and music festivals while studying, graduating in commerce. Roshan assisted his father on four films‚ÄîKhudgarz (1987), King Uncle (1993), Karan Arjun (1995) and Koyla (1997)‚Äîwhile also sweeping the floor and making tea for the crew. After pack-up, Roshan would enact Shah Rukh Khan's scenes from Koyla and film himself to make a judgement about his performance as an actor. While he assisted his father, he studied acting under Kishore Namit Kapoor.  Film career  2000‚Äì2002: Debut, success and setback Roshan was originally scheduled to make his screen debut as a lead actor opposite Preity Zinta in the cancelled film Shekhar Kapur's Tara Rum Pum Pum. Instead, he starred in his father's romantic drama Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai (2000) opposite another debutante, Ameesha Patel. Roshan played dual roles: Rohit, an aspiring singer brutally killed after witnessing a murder, and Raj, an NRI who falls in love with Patel's character. To prepare, he trained with the actor Salman Khan to bulk up physically, worked to improve his diction and took lessons in acting, singing, dancing, fencing and riding. With global revenues of , Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai became the highest-grossing Indian film of 2000. His performance was acclaimed by critics; Suggu Kanchana on Rediff.com wrote, \\"[Roshan] is good. The ease and style with which he dances, emotes, fights, makes one forget this is his debut film ... He seems to be the most promising among the recent lot of star sons we have been subjected to.\\" For the role, Roshan received Best Male Debut and Best Actor Awards at the annual Filmfare Awards, IIFA Awards, and Zee Cine Awards. He became the first actor to win both Filmfare Best Debut and Best Actor awards the same year. The film established Roshan as a prominent actor in Bollywood. The actor found life hard after his overnight success, particularly the demands on his time. In his second release, Khalid Mohammed's crime drama Fiza, Roshan played Amaan, an innocent Muslim boy who becomes a terrorist after the 1992‚Äì93 Bombay riots. Roshan appeared in the film to expand his horizons as an actor. Co-starring Karisma Kapoor and Jaya Bachchan, Fiza was moderately successful at the box office, and Roshan's performance earned him a second nomination for Best Actor at the Filmfare ceremony. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama praised him as the production's prime asset, commending his \\"body language, his diction, his expressions, [and] his overall persona.\\" Roshan next appeared in Vidhu Vinod Chopra's action drama Mission Kashmir (2000) alongside Sanjay Dutt, Preity Zinta, and Jackie Shroff. Set in the valley of Kashmir during the Indo-Pakistani conflicts, the film addressed the topics of terrorism and crime, and was a financial success. Roshan was drawn to his complex role of a young man traumatised by the discovery that his adoptive father had been responsible for the death of his entire birth family. In Adarsh's opinion, Roshan \\"brightens up the screen with his magnetic presence. His body language, coupled with his expressions, is sure to win him plaudits.\\" alt=A picture of Hrithik Roshan taken in 2001. In 2001, Roshan appeared in two films, the first of which was Subhash Ghai's Yaadein, a romantic drama which paired him with Kareena Kapoor and reunited him with Shroff. Although highly anticipated, Yaadein was reviled by critics; in The Hindu, Ziya Us Salam criticised the director for relying on Roshan's commercial appeal. Roshan next had a supporting role in Karan Johar's ensemble melodrama Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... alongside Amitabh Bachchan, Jaya Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan, Kajol and Kareena Kapoor. He was cast as Rohan Raichand‚Äîthe younger son of Bachchan's character who plots to reunite him with his adopted son (played by Khan)‚Äîafter Johar had watched a rough cut of Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai. Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... finished as India's second highest-grossing film of the year, and among the most successful Bollywood films in the overseas market, earning over worldwide. Writing for Rediff.com, Anjum N described Roshan as \\"the surprise scene-stealer\\", praising him for holding his own against the established actors. Roshan received a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance. In 2002 Vikram Bhatt's romance Aap Mujhe Achche Lagne Lage reunited him with Ameesha Patel but failed at the box office, as did Arjun Sablok's romance Na Tum Jaano Na Hum (2002). Roshan's final role that year was in a Yash Raj Films production, the high-profile Mujhse Dosti Karoge! co-starring Rani Mukerji and Kareena Kapoor. The romantic drama was heavily promoted before its release and made money internationally, though not in India. In another commercial failure, Sooraj R. Barjatya's Main Prem Ki Diwani Hoon, Roshan was cast alongside Kareena Kapoor for the fourth time, and Abhishek Bachchan. The press labelled Roshan a \\"one-trick pony\\" and suggested that the failure of these films would end his career. 2003‚Äì2008: Revival and awards success Roshan's career began to revive with a starring role in Koi... Mil Gaya (2003). The film, directed and produced by his father, centers on his character Rohit Mehra, a developmentally disabled young man, who comes in contact with an extraterrestrial being‚Äîa role that required him to lose nearly . Roshan recalls the experience of starring in the film fondly: \\"I could live my childhood [again]. I could eat as many chocolates as I wanted. I became a baby and everybody was so caring towards me.\\" In the book Film Sequels, Carolyn Jess-Cooke drew similarities between the character and Forrest Gump, portrayed by Tom Hanks in the titular film, but this idea was dismissed by Roshan. Film critics were polarised on their view of the film‚Äîsome of them negatively compared its storyline to the 1982 Hollywood release E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial‚Äîbut were unanimous in their praise for Roshan. In a 2010 retrospective of the Top 80 Iconic Performances of Bollywood, Filmfare noted \\"how flesh and blood Hrithik's act is. Simply because he believes he is the part. Watch him laugh, cry or bond with his remote controlled alien friend and note his nuanced turn.\\" A Rediff.com critic agreed that Roshan was \\"the turbojet that propels the film to the realm of the extraordinary.\\" Koi... Mil Gaya was the most popular Bollywood film of the year, earning , and Roshan won both Filmfare Awards for Best Actor and Best Actor (Critics). The following year, Roshan collaborated with Amitabh Bachchan and Preity Zinta on Farhan Akhtar's Lakshya (2004), a fictionalised coming-of-age story set against events from the 1999 Kargil War. He also featured in the item number \\"Main Aisa Kyun Hoon\\" (choreographed by Prabhu Deva) which proved popular with audiences. The film earned Roshan Best Actor nominations at the Filmfare and Zee Cine ceremony. Manish Gajjar of the BBC praised Roshan's versatility and his transformation from a carefree youth to a determined and courageous soldier. Roshan was not seen on screen again until 2006, with three new releases, including a cameo at the end of the year in the romance I See You. He co-starred with Naseeruddin Shah and Priyanka Chopra in his father's superhero production Krrish. A follow-up to his family's production Koi... Mil Gaya, it saw him play dual roles‚Äîthe title superhero and his character from the original film. Before production, Roshan travelled to China to train with Tony Ching for the cable work that would be needed to make his character fly. He sustained several injuries during production. For example, he tore the hamstring in his right leg and broke his thumb and toe. Krrish became the second-highest-grossing Bollywood film of 2006 with a worldwide revenue of . It garnered him Best Actor awards at the 2007 Screen and the International Indian Film Academy Awards. Ronnie Scheib of Variety considered Roshan a prime asset of the film, noting that he \\"pulls off the pic's wilder absurdities with considerable panache.\\" For his role as an enigmatic master thief in Dhoom 2 (2006)‚Äîan action sequel co-starring Aishwarya Rai, Bipasha Basu and Abhishek Bachchan‚ÄîRoshan won his third Filmfare Award for Best Actor. The film critic Rajeev Masand called him \\"the heart, the soul, and the spirit of the film\\", and praised his stunts, concluding that he \\"holds the film together and even manages to take your attention away from its many flaws.\\" Bored by playing the \\"good guy\\", Roshan was excited to play a villain for the first time. At the request of the film's producer Aditya Chopra, Roshan lost for the role, and learned skateboarding, snow boarding, rollerblading and sand surfing. With earnings of , Dhoom 2 became the highest-grossing Indian film of all time, a distinction it held for two years. In the 2007 melodrama Om Shanti Om, he made a cameo alongside several Bollywood stars. In 2008, Roshan was cast in Ashutosh Gowariker's Jodhaa Akbar, a partly fictionalised account of a marriage of convenience between the Mughal emperor Jalaluddin Muhammad Akbar (played by Roshan) and the Rajput princess Jodha Bai (played by Rai). Gowariker believed Roshan possessed the regal bearing and physique required to play the role of a king. For the role, Roshan learned sword-fighting and horse-riding, and also took Urdu lessons. Jodhaa Akbar earned worldwide. Roshan's performance earned him his fourth Filmfare Best Actor Award as well as his first international award ‚Äì\\"Best Actor\\" at the Golden Minbar International Film Festival in Kazan, Russia. Critics were generally appreciative of Roshan's performance. Raja Sen of Rediff.com thought that Roshan \\"proves a very good Akbar. There are times when his inflection seems too modern, but the actor gives the performance his all, slipping into the skin of the character and staying there.\\" Roshan ended 2008 with an appearance in the popular item number \\"Krazzy 4\\" from the film of same name. 2009‚Äì2012: Critical acclaim Following a small role in Zoya Akhtar's Luck by Chance in 2009, Roshan starred in and recorded \\"Kites in the Sky\\" for the multi-national romantic thriller Kites (2010). In the film, produced by his father, he played a man running a green card scam in Las Vegas in which he has married 11 different women in exchange for money. Kites opened on a record- breaking 3000 screens, and became the first Bollywood film to break into the North American top 10. However, the film eventually underperformed at India's box office and received negative reviews from critics. The website Box Office India attributed this failure to its multilingual dialogues. In a review for Rediff.com, Matthew Schneeberger thought that Roshan \\"overacts. A lot. In Kites, he nails a few scenes, but bungles many more, particularly the film's catastrophically bad ending.\\" Roshan with co-star Aishwarya Rai promoting Guzaarish. A popular on-screen couple, they also starred together in Dhoom 2 and Jodhaa Akbar. Roshan then collaborated with director Sanjay Leela Bhansali on the drama Guzaarish (2010) in which he had the role of Ethan Mascarenhas, a former magician suffering from quadriplegia, who after years of struggle, files an appeal for euthanasia. Roshan had reservations about the role but agreed to the project after reading the film's story. To understand his role better, he interacted with paraplegic patients. In his own words, \\"I used to spend six hours with the patients, initially once a week and then once a month. I used to go to understand what they go through, what they think, what their needs are. They have taught me a lot of things.\\" He also trained with a Ukrainian magician to perform the film's magic stunts, and put on weight to look the part. The film failed at the box office, though it and Roshan's performance were positively received by critics. A writer for Zee News praised the chemistry between Roshan and Rai, adding that they \\"break the Bollywood mould of stereotypes.\\" Roshan received the Zee Cine Award for Best Actor (Critics) and nominations for Filmfare, IIFA and Zee Cine Award for Best Actor. In 2011, Roshan appeared in Zoya Akhtar's ensemble comedy-drama Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara alongside Abhay Deol and Farhan Akhtar as three friends who embark on a bachelor trip where they overcome their insecurities. Zoya cast Roshan in the role of an uptight workaholic as she considers him her favourite actor. For the film's soundtrack, Roshan recorded the song \\"Se√±orita\\" with his co-stars and Mar√≠a del Mar Fern√°ndez. Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara was released to positive reviews and Roshan's performance was praised. Rajeev Masand wrote, \\"Hrithik Roshan once again brings real depth to his character with a spectacular performance. He's shy and restrained, then lets go with such fantastic intensity that you make the inward journey with his character.\\" The film grossed worldwide and became Roshan's first commercial success in three years. He was nominated for another Filmfare Award for Best Actor for his performance. Later that year, he made a special appearance in Farhan's Don 2. Roshan's only screen appearance in 2012 was in Karan Malhotra's Agneepath, a retelling of the 1990 film of the same name. Cast alongside Rishi Kapoor, Sanjay Dutt and Priyanka Chopra, Roshan reinterpreted the character Vijay Deenanath Chauhan (originally played by Amitabh Bachchan), a common man who seeks revenge against an unscrupulous man for framing and murdering his father. Roshan was initially sceptical of taking up a role earlier played by Bachchan, and thought hard before accepting. He did not watch the original film for inspiration as he found his role to be completely different. In one of several accidents to happen during production, Roshan suffered a painful back injury. He deemed Agneepath \\"the hardest [project] I've ever worked in my life\\" owing to the exhaustion he felt while filming. The film broke Bollywood's highest opening-day earnings record, and had a worldwide gross of . A Firstpost reviewer thought Roshan \\"breathes fire and soul into Agneepath\\". The actor was rewarded with another Filmfare nomination and a third consecutive Stardust Award for Best Actor in a Drama, having won previously for Guzaarish and Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara. 2013‚Äìpresent: Krrish 3 and beyond Roshan appeared in the third instalment of the Krrish film series‚ÄîKrrish 3 (2013) which also starred Priyanka Chopra, Vivek Oberoi and Kangana Ranaut. During production, Roshan was injured when he fell down, which resulted in back pain. Critics thought that the film was entertaining but lacking in originality, though Roshan's performance garnered praise. The editor Komal Nahta lauded Roshan for playing three different characters in the film, and the actor received his eleventh Filmfare nomination for Best Actor. Krrish 3 grossed worldwide, becoming one of the highest-grossing Indian films of all time. Mohenjo Daro in 2016alt=Hrithik Roshan is looking towards the camera. Roshan received a fourth consecutive Filmfare nomination for his performance in the 2014 action comedy Bang Bang!, a remake of the 2010 Hollywood release Knight and Day and one of the most expensive Bollywood films. Playing the role of an eccentric secret agent who plots to track down a terrorist, Roshan became the first actor to perform a flyboarding stunt in film. While filming in Thailand, Roshan suffered a head injury from a stunt accident and underwent brain surgery to relieve a chronic subdural hematoma. The critic Mohar Basu noted that Roshan was \\"pitch perfect\\" and \\"breez[ed] through his part brilliantly.\\" The film earned in global ticket sales, making it among the highest-grossing Indian films. For playing the role of a farmer in 2016 BC who travels to Mohenjo-daro in Ashutosh Gowariker's Mohenjo Daro (2016), Roshan was paid , a record-breaking remuneration for an Indian actor. He underwent a three-month training to achieve the \\"lithe\\" and \\"agile\\" physique required for his role. Despite being a highly anticipated release, it failed commercially, and critics were generally unenthusiastic. Dismissing the film as an \\"unintentional comedy\\", Anupama Chopra wrote that Roshan \\"pours his soul into every scene. But the burden of carrying this leaden, cartoon-like narrative proves too much even for his Herculean shoulders.\\" Roshan was next seen alongside Yami Gautam in Sanjay Gupta's Kaabil (2017), a romantic thriller about a blind man who avenges the rape of his blind wife. To ensure authenticity in his portrayal, Roshan locked himself in a room for four days and avoided contact with people. Reviews for the film were generally positive with particular praise for Roshan's performance. Meena Iyer of The Times of India found his performance to be his best to date, and Shubhra Gupta on The Indian Express considered him \\"the only bright spot in this dispirited mess of a movie.\\" The film accumulated worldwide. After two years of screen absence, Roshan's career prospects improved in 2019. He first starred in Vikas Bahl's biographical film Super 30, based on the mathematician Anand Kumar and his educational program Super 30. Roshan hired a trainer from Bhagalpur to learn Bihari accent. The film was released to commercial success, but received mixed reviews. While NDTV's Saibal Chatterjee found Roshan miscast in his role, Michael Gomes of Khaleej Times called it one of his best performances. Roshan next starred alongside Tiger Shroff in Yash Raj Films' (with which he previously collaborated in 2006 in Dhoom 2) War, an action thriller which emerged as his highest-grossing release. He will also appear in the fourth instalment of the Krrish series ‚Äî superhero film Krrish 4 expected to release in Christmas 2020. Other work Roshan has performed on stage, appeared on television, and launched a clothing line. His first tour (Heartthrobs: Live in Concert (2002) with Kareena Kapoor, Karisma Kapoor, Arjun Rampal and Aftab Shivdasani) was successful in the United States and Canada. At the end of that year, he danced on stage with Amitabh Bachchan, Sanjay Dutt, Kareena Kapoor, Rani Mukerji and Shah Rukh Khan at Kings Park Stadium in Durban, South Africa in the show Now or Never. In 2011, Roshan served as a judge alongside Farah Khan and Vaibhavi Merchant for the dance competition reality show, Just Dance. He became the highest-paid film star on Indian television after he was paid per episode. The show ran from June to October 2011. In November 2013, Roshan launched his clothing line, the casual wear brand HRx. Provogue Spring Summer Catalogue in 2011 Roshan is vocal about his childhood stammer. He actively supports the Dilkhush Special School for mentally challenged children in Mumbai. In 2008, he donated to the Nanavati Hospital for the treatment of stammering children. Roshan set up a charity foundation in 2009 that aims to work for handicapped people. He donates roughly for charity every month, and believes that people should publicise their philanthropic work to set an example for others. In 2013, he took part in a festivity at Ghatkopar, whose proceeds went to an NGO supporting tribal girls suffering from malnutrition and starvation. Also that year, he donated to help the victims of the 2013 North India floods. Alongside other Bollywood stars, Roshan played a football match for charity organised by Aamir Khan's daughter, Ira, in 2014. The following year, he appeared with Sonam Kapoor in the music video for \\"Dheere Dheere\\", whose profits were donated to charity. Later that year, Roshan became the Indian brand ambassador for UNICEF and the Global Goals campaign's World's Largest Lesson that aims to educate children in over 100 countries about the Sustainable Development Goals. In 2016, Roshan and other Bollywood actors made donations for building homes for families affected by the 2015 South Indian floods. Following his debut film, Roshan signed on for endorsement deals with Coca-Cola, Tamarind and Hero Honda, all for three years and for at least . As of 2010, he is celebrity endorser for such brands and products as Provogue, Parle Hide and Seek, Reliance Communications and Hero Honda and recently roshan has completed six years with Rado.The Times of India reported that Roshan received to for each endorsement, making him one of the highest-paid male celebrity endorsers. In 2016, Duff & Phelps estimated his brand value to be US$34.1 million, the eighth highest of Indian celebrities. In 2017, Roshan was signed as the brand ambassador of a Health and wellness startup Cure.fit and is touted as one of the largest endorsement deal signed by an Indian startup.  Personal life  alt=Hrithik Roshan with his wife, Sussanne Khan. On 20 December 2000, Roshan married Sussanne Khan in a private ceremony in Bangalore. Despite their religious difference‚ÄîRoshan is a Hindu and Khan is a Muslim‚ÄîRoshan says that he equally valued her beliefs. The couple has two sons, Hrehaan (born in 2006) and Hridhaan (born in 2008). They separated in December 2013 and their divorce was finalised in November 2014. Roshan and Sussanne maintained that they parted amicably. In 2016, he filed a lawsuit against his Krrish 3 co-star Kangana Ranaut, accusing her of cyber stalking and harassment. Denying the charges, Ranaut filed a counter-charge against Roshan, claiming that his lawsuit was an attempt to cover up their affair. Owing to a lack of evidence, the Mumbai Police closed the case later that year. Roshan considered quitting the film industry after two assailants fired bullets at his father in 2000. Later that December, he was involved in a controversy when Nepalese newspapers accused him of stating in a Star Plus interview that he hated Nepal and its people. This led to protests in the country, a ban on screening of his films, and four people's deaths after street violence. Nepalese people threatened to \\"bury [him] alive\\" if he ever visited the country. Star Plus, for its part, stated that Roshan \\"did not touch upon Nepal.\\" The violence calmed down after Roshan wrote a two-page rejoinder in which he denied having made any claim against the country. Nepali actress Manisha Koirala helped distribute it to newspapers and a local television station. Artistry and media image As the son of the filmmaker Rakesh, Roshan faced the media spotlight from a young age. Discussing nepotism in Bollywood, Shama Rana views him as one of several actors who managed film careers with the help of family relations in the industry. On the other hand, Roshan is acknowledged in the media as one of the most talented Indian actors of his generation, for his devotion to his work and for his ability to commit heavily to each role. He insists on learning any necessary skills and performing stunts himself, and is particularly known for his professionalism. The director Ashutosh Gowariker praised Roshan when he continued filming Mohenjo Daro despite several injuries and being in a troubled state of mind. Zoya Akhtar, who considers Roshan her favourite actor, and directed him in Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, remarks on his ability to display a range of emotions on screen. Roshan with his wax sculpture at alt=Hrithik Roshan is pictured with his wax sculpture at the Madame Tussauds museum. Roshan intentionally takes on diverse parts in an attempt to not be typecast. He looks at the scripts as a platform to inspire with the strength and courage of his characters and to make his audiences smile. Roshan was noted by critics for his versatility in portraying a variety of characters in Koi... Mil Gaya (2003), Lakshya (2004), Jodhaa Akbar (2008), and Guzaarish (2010). Box Office India ranked him first on its top actors listing in 2000 and later included him in 2003, 2004, 2006 and 2007. Roshan topped Rediff.com's list of best Bollywood actors in 2003, and was ranked fourth in 2006. Filmfare magazine included two of his performances‚Äîfrom Koi... Mil Gaya and Lakshya‚Äîon its 2010 list of 80 Iconic Performances. In March 2011, Roshan placed fourth on Rediff.com's list of Top 10 Actors of 2000‚Äì2010. Roshan's dancing ability has also drawn praise from the media, an opinion he disagrees with. The Los Angeles Times finds him to be \\"a sensational dancer\\" who \\"has the dashing, chiseled looks of a silent movie matinee idol.\\" Some critics also believe that he is only able to dance and act in his father's films. His inclination towards \\"glamorous, albeit empty parts\\", which conform to character stereotypes, has been criticised. Roshan is among Bollywood's highest-paid actors. Discussing his success ratio at the box office in a 2014 article, Daily News and Analysis credited him as \\"the most bankable star\\" in Bollywood. One of the most high-profile Indian celebrities, he was named the second most powerful Indian film star by Forbes in 2001. He ranked fourth in Filmfare Power List in 2007. In a 2009 poll conducted by Daily News and Analysis Roshan was voted one of India's most popular icons. At the 2009 FICCI-IIFA Awards, Roshan was one of the ten recipients of the most powerful Bollywood entertainers of the 2000s. From 2012‚Äì2018, Roshan was placed on Forbes India Celebrity 100‚Äîa list based on the income and popularity of Indian celebrities‚Äîpeaking at ninth position in 2014 with an annual income of . Roshan has established himself as a sex symbol and a style icon in India. In 2006, Roshan was one of the four Bollywood actors, along with Priyanka Chopra, Kajol and Shah Rukh Khan, whose miniature dolls were launched in the United Kingdom, under the name of \\"Bollywood Legends\\". He topped The Times of India listing of 50 Most Desirable Men in 2010 and ranked among the top five for the next five years. In 2010 and 2012, the Indian edition of GQ included him in their listing of Bollywood's best dressed men. A life-size, wax figure of him was installed at London's Madame Tussauds museum in January 2011, making him the fifth Indian actor to have been replicated as a wax statue there. Versions of the statue were installed at Madame Tussauds' museums in New York, Washington and other cities in the world. Roshan regularly features in the magazine Eastern Eye listing of the 50 Sexiest Asian Men. He topped the list in 2011, 2012 and 2014, and featured among the top five in 2010, 2013 and 2015 to 2018.

They make up about 1% of angiosperms and are found in almost every biome. All parasitic plants have modified roots, called haustoria, which penetrate the host plant, connecting them to the conductive system ‚Äì either the xylem, the phloem, or both. For example, plants like Striga or Rhinanthus connect only to the xylem, via xylem bridges (xylem- feeding). Alternately, plants like Cuscuta and Orobanche connect only to the phloem of the host (phloem-feeding). This provides them with the ability to extract water and nutrients from the host. Parasitic plants are classified depending as to the location where the parasitic plant latches onto the host and the amount of nutrients it requires. Some parasitic plants are able to locate their host plants by detecting chemicals in the air or soil given off by host shoots or roots, respectively. About 4,500 species of parasitic plant in approximately 20 families of flowering plants are known.Nickrent, D. L. and Musselman, L. J. 2004. Introduction to Parasitic Flowering Plants. The Plant Health Instructor.  Classification  Parasitic plants occur in multiple plant families, indicating that the evolution is polyphyletic. Some families consist mostly of parasitic representatives such as Balanophoraceae, while other families have only a few representatives. One example is the North American Monotropa uniflora (Indian pipe or corpse plant) which is a member of the heath family, Ericaceae, better known for its members blueberries, cranberries, and rhododendrons. Parasitic plants are characterized as follows: *1a. Obligate parasite ‚Äì a parasite that cannot complete its life cycle without a host. *1b. Facultative parasite ‚Äì a parasite that can complete its life cycle independent of a host. *2a. Stem parasite ‚Äì a parasite that attaches to the host stem. *2b. Root parasite ‚Äì a parasite that attaches to the host root. *3a. Hemiparasite ‚Äì a plant parasitic under natural conditions, but photosynthetic to some degree. Hemiparasites may obtain only water and mineral nutrients from the host plant; many obtain at least part of their organic nutrients from the host as well. *3b. Holoparasite - a parasitic plant that derives all of its fixed carbon from the host plant. Commonly lacking chlorophyll, holoparasites are often colors other than green. Mistletoe, an obligate stem hemiparasite For hemiparasites, one from each of the three sets of terms can be applied to the same species, e.g. *Nuytsia floribunda (Western Australian Christmas tree) is an obligate root hemiparasite. *Rhinanthus (e.g. Yellow rattle) is a facultative root hemiparasite. *Mistletoe is an obligate stem hemiparasite. Holoparasites are always obligate so only two terms are needed, e.g. *Dodder is a stem holoparasite. *Hydnora spp. are root holoparasites. Plants usually considered holoparasites include broomrape, dodder, Rafflesia, and the Hydnoraceae. Plants usually considered hemiparasites include Castilleja, mistletoe, Western Australian Christmas tree, and yellow rattle. Evolution of parasitism Striga witchweeds (white, centre, attached to roots of host) are economically important pests of the crop plants that they parasitise. Parasitic behavior evolved in angiosperms roughly 12-13 times independently, a classic example of convergent evolution. Roughly 1% of all angiosperm species are parasitic, with a large degree of host dependence. The taxonomic family Orobanchaceae (encompassing the genera Tryphysaria, Striga, and Orobanche) is the only family that contains both holoparasitic and hemiparasitic species, making it a model group for studying the evolutionary rise of parasitism. The remaining groups contain only hemiparasites or holoparasites.Westwood, James H., John I. Yoder, Michael P. Timko and Claude W. Depamphilis. \\"The Evolution of Parasitism in Plants.\\" Trends in Plant Science 15.4 (2010) 227-35. Web. The evolutionary event which gave rise to parasitism in plants was the development of haustoria. The first, most ancestral, haustoria are thought to be similar to that of the facultative hemiparasites within Tryphysaria, lateral haustoria develop along the surface of the roots in these species. Later evolution led to the development of terminal or primary haustoria at the tip of the juvenile radicle, seen in obligate hemiparasitic species within Striga. Lastly, holoparasitic plants, always forms of obligate parasites, evolved over the loss of photosynthetis, seen in the genus Orobanche. To maximize resources, many parasitic plants have evolved 'self-incompatibility', to avoid parasitizing themselves. Others such as Triphysaria usually avoid parasitizing other members of their species, but some parasitic plants have no such limits. The albino redwood is a mutant Sequoia sempervirens that produces no chlorophyll; they live on sugars from neighbouring trees, usually the parent tree from which they have grown (via a somatic mutation). Seed germination Parasitic plants germinate in several methods. These can either be chemical or mechanical and the means used by seeds often depends on whether or not the parasites are root parasites or stem parasites. Most parasitic plants need to germinate in close proximity to their host plants because their seeds are limited in the amount of resources necessary to survive without nutrients from their host plants. Resources are limited due in part to the fact that most parasitic plants are not able to use autotrophic nutrition to establish the early stages of seeding.Scott, P. 2008. Physiology and behavior of plants: parasitic plants. John Wiley & sons pp. 103‚Äì112.Runyon, J. Tooker, J. Mescher, M. De Moraes, C. 2009. Parasitic plants in agriculture: Chemical ecology of germination and host-plant location as targets for sustainable control: A review. Sustainable Agriculture Reviews 1. pp. 123-136. Root parasitic plant seeds tend to use chemical cues for germination. For germination to occur, seeds need to be quite close to the host plant. For example, the seeds of witchweed (Striga asiatica) need to be within 3 to 4 millimeters (mm) of its host to receive chemical signals in the soil to trigger germination. This range is important because Striga asiatica will only grow about 4 mm after germination. Chemical compound cues sensed by parasitic plant seeds are from host plant root exudates that are leached in close proximity from the host‚Äôs root system into the surrounding soil. These chemical cues are a variety of compounds that are unstable and rapidly degraded in soil and are present within a radius of a few meters of the plant exuding them. Parasitic plants germinate and follow a concentration gradient of these compounds in the soil toward the host plants if close enough. These compounds are called strigolactones. Strigolactone stimulates ethylene biosynthesis in seeds causing them to germinate. There are a variety of chemical germination stimulants. Strigol was the first of the germination stimulants to be isolated. It was isolated from a non-host cotton plant and has been found in true host plants such as corn and millets. The stimulants are usually plant specific, examples of other germination stimulants include sorgolactone from sorghum, orobanchol and alectrol from red clover, and 5-deoxystrigol from Lotus japonicus. Strigolactones are apocarotenoids that are produced via the carotenoid pathway of plants. Strigolactones and mycorrhizal fungi have a relationship in which Strigolactone also cues the growth of mycorrhizal fungus.Schneeweiss, G. 2007.

European Society for Evolutionary Biology. 20 471-478. Stem parasitic plants, unlike most root parasites, germinate using the resources inside their endosperms and are able to survive for some time. For example, the dodders (Cuscuta spp.) drop their seeds to the ground. These may remain dormant for up to five years before they find a host plant. Using the resources in the seed endosperm, dodder is able to germinate. Once germinated, the plant has 6 days to find and establish a connection with its host plant before its resources exhaust. Dodder seeds germinate above ground, then the plant sends out stems in search of its host plant reaching up to 6 cm before it dies. It is believed that the plant uses two methods of finding a host. The stem detects its host plant's scent and orients itself in that direction. Scientists used volatiles from tomato plants (Œ±-pinene, Œ≤-myrcene, and Œ≤-phellandrene) to test the reaction of C. pentagona and found that the stem orients itself in the direction of the odor. Some studies suggest that by using light reflecting from nearby plants dodders are able to select host with higher sugar because of the levels of chlorophyll in the leaves.Lesica, P. 2010. Dodder: Hardly Doddering. Kelseya Newsletter of Montana Native Plant Society. Vol 23. 2, 6 Once the dodder finds its host, it wraps itself around the host plant's stem. Using adventitious roots, the dodder taps into the host plant's stem with a haustorium, an absorptive organ within the host plant vascular tissue. Dodder makes several of these connections with the host as it moves up the plant.  Seed dispersal  There are several methods of seed dispersal, but all the strategies aim to put the seed in direct contact with, or within a critical distance of, the host. # The Cuscuta seedling can live for 3‚Äì7 days and extend out 35 cm in search of the host before it dies. This is because the Cuscuta seed is large and has stored nutrients to sustain its life. This is also useful for seeds that get digested by animals and are excreted. # Mistletoe use a sticky seed for dispersal. The seed sticks to nearby animals and birds and then comes into direct contact with the host. # Arceuthobium seeds have a similarly sticky seed as the mistletoe but they do not rely on animals and birds, they mainly disperse by fruit explosiveness. Once the seed makes contact with the host, rain water can help position the seed into a suitable position. # Some seeds detect and respond to chemical stimulations produced in the host‚Äôs roots and start to grow towards the host.  Obstacles to host attachment  A parasitic plant has many obstacles to overcome to attach to a host. Distance from the host and stored nutrients are some of the problems, and the host's defenses are an obstacle to overcome. The first hurdle is penetrating the host, since the host has systems to reinforce the cell wall by protein cross-linking so that it stops the parasitic progress at the cortex of the host's roots. The second hurdle is the host's ability to secrete germination inhibitors. This prevents germination of the parasitic seed. The third hurdle is the host's ability to create a toxic environment at the location where the parasitic plant attaches. The host secretes phenolic compounds into the apoplast. This creates a toxic environment for the parasitic plant, eventually killing it. The fourth hurdle is the host's ability to ruin the tubercle using gums and gels or injecting toxins into the tubercle.Walters, D. (2010). Plant Defense Warding off attack by pathogens, herbivores and parasitic plants. Hoboken: Wiley. Host range Some parasitic plants are generalists and parasitize many different species, even several different species at once. Dodder (Cassytha spp., Cuscuta spp.) and red rattle (Odontites vernus) are generalist parasites. Other parasitic plants are specialists that parasitize a few or just one species. Beech drops (Epifagus virginiana) is a root holoparasite only on American beech (Fagus grandifolia). Rafflesia is a holoparasite on the vine Tetrastigma. Plants such as Pterospora become parasites of mycorrhizal fungi. There is evidence that parasites also practice self-discrimination, species of Tryphysaria experience reduced haustorium development in the presence of other Tryphysaria. The mechanism for self-discrimination in parasites is not yet known. Aquatic parasitic plants Parasitism also evolved within aquatic species of plants and algae. Parasitic marine plants are described as benthic, meaning that they are sedentary or attached to another structure. Plants and algae that grow on the host plant, using it as an attachment point are given the designation epiphytic (epilithic is the name given to plants/algae that use rocks or boulders for attachment), while not necessarily parasitic, some species occur in high correlation with a certain host species, suggesting that they rely on the host plant in some way or another. In contrast, endophytic plants and algae grow inside their host plant, these have a wide range of host dependence from obligate holoparasites to facultative hemiparasites.Dring, M. J. The Biology of Marine Plants. London: E. Arnold, 1982. Print. Marine parasites occur as a higher proportion of marine flora in temperate rather than tropical waters. While no full explanation for this is available, many of the potential host plants such as kelp and other macroscopic brown algae are generally restricted to temperate areas. Roughly 75% of parasitic red algae infect hosts in the same taxonomic family as themselves, these are given the designation adelphoparasites. Other marine parasites, deemed endozoic, are parasites of marine invertebrates (molluscs, flatworms, sponges) and can be either holoparasitic or hemiparasitic, some retaining the ability to photosynthesize after infection. Importance Species within Orobanchaceae are some of the most economically destructive species on Earth. Species of Striga alone are estimated to cost billions of dollars a year in crop yield loss annually, infesting over 50 million hectares of cultivated land within sub-Saharan Africa alone. Striga can infest both grasses and grains, including corn, rice and Sorghum, undoubtedly some of the most important food crops. Orobanche also threatens a wide range of important crops, including peas, chickpeas, tomatoes, carrots, lettuce, and varieties of the genus Brassica (e.g. cabbage and broccoli). Yield loss from Orobanche can reach 100% and has caused farmers in some regions of the world to abandon certain staple crops and begin importing others as an alternative. Much research has been devoted to the control of Orobanche and Striga species, which are even more devastating in developing areas of the world, though no method has been found to be entirely successful. *Mistletoes cause economic damage to forest and ornamental trees. *Rafflesia arnoldii produces the world's largest flowers at about one meter in diameter.

It mistakes the cables for host roots and tries to parasitize them using its sclerenchymatic guillotine.Sclerenchymatic guillotine in the haustorium of Nuytsia floribunda Some parasitic plants are destructive while some have positive influences in their communities. Some parasitic plants damage invasive species more than native species. This results in the reduced damage of invasive species in the community.Newly emergent snow plant (Sarcodes sanguinea), a flowering plant parasitic on mycorrhizal fungi In many regions, including the Nepal Eastern Himalayas, parasitic plants are used for medicinal and ritual purposes. Plants parasitic on fungi About 400 species of flowering plants, plus one gymnosperm (Parasitaxus usta), are parasitic on mycorrhizal fungi. This effectively gives these plants the ability to become associated with many of the other plants around them. They are termed myco-heterotrophs. Some myco- heterotrophs are Indian pipe (Monotropa uniflora), snow plant (Sarcodes sanguinea), underground orchid (Rhizanthella gardneri), bird's nest orchid (Neottia nidus-avis), and sugarstick (Allotropa virgata). Within the taxonomic family Ericaceae, known for extensive mycorrhizal relationships, there are the Monotropoids. The Monotropoids include the genera Monotropa, Monotropsis, and Pterospora among others. Myco-heterotrophic behavior is commonly accompanied by the loss of chlorophyll.Judd, Walter S., Christopher Campbell, and Elizabeth A. Kellogg. Plant Systematics: A Phylogenetic Approach.

Pattiveeranpatti has an average literacy rate of 83%, higher than the national average of 59.5%. Male literacy is 86%, and female literacy is 79%. 8% of the population of Pattiveeranpatti are under 6 years of age. History The history of the village dates back almost 1500 years. It was part of the ancient Pandyan Empire and later came under the reign of the Chola empire and the Vijayanagara Empire, before coming under the rule of the Madurai Nayak dynasty. The village is occupied by coffee growers who own the coffee estates in the Thandikudi hills area, which is part of the Palani Hills. By 1860, coffee cultivation in the Western Ghats (Lower Palani Hills range) had gained momentum and the estate owners in Pattiveeranpatti became pioneers in the development and cultivation of coffee plantations. They also developed banana and orange plantations. Their success in the cultivation of coffee coupled with their entrepreneurship paved the way for developing Pattiveeranpatti as a trading hub for coffee, cardamom, pepper, and other spices. It grew into a prosperous rural town with many large heritage bungalows that once belonged to these planters. Educational institutions Nadar Sundara Vishalakshi Vidhyasala (NSVV) Higher Secondary School is one of the oldest institutions in Tamil Nadu state. The school was started in 1910 after a resolution was passed at the Mahajanam Conference at Poraiyar, adopting a resolution that all associations must start a school, as education was the only path to prosperity and upward caste mobility. The first administrator was W.P.A.P. Punnaivannam. In 1936 W. P. A. Soundarapandian persuaded his childless uncle W.P. Sundara to donate his coffee plantation and other assets in order to improve the school. Started in 1910 as a primary school, the school became a Higher Secondary School (10+2) in the year 1978. The schools bear the names of local figures Thiru Sundara and his wife Vishalakshi Ammal, who donated all their assets for the education of the poor in and around the village. The Hindu Uravinmurai Paribalana Sangam currently runs a nursery school, primary school, NSVVHSS for boys, NSVVHSS for girls and NSVV Matriculation School.

The name refers to the portion of the examination in which the candidate being examined flies in an aircraft with the Designated Pilot Examiner or other authorized examiner to demonstrate competency in the skills that are required for the certification. Although \\"checkride\\" is the most commonly used term, it is considered informal and is technically known as a Practical Test by the FAA and in all its literature, and the specific objectives which the candidate must meet are called the Airman Certification Standards, or ACS. Other positions that often include checkrides include air traffic controllers and flight dispatchers. In addition to successfully completing a checkride, one must also complete an oral examination (which happens before, and often, to some extent, during the checkride), and meet certain basic aeronautical experience requirements (such as number of hours flown) as well as pass a separate multiple-choice computer-administered test that is quite consistently called the \\"written test.\\" During a checkride, an examiner takes on a role more like that of a passenger rather than an instructor. That is, it's the examiner's job to observe that the candidate demonstrates good decision-making skills, rather than to teach or to act as a crewmember, although an examiner is likely to offer advice during the ride if so inclined. The examiner usually does not touch any of the aircraft controls unless necessary to maintain the safety of the flight ‚Äî in which case the candidate usually fails the examination instantly, except for the part when the examiner acts as a safety pilot during operations with a view limiting device. While the Airman Certification Standards outline very specific tolerances that a prospect must adhere to, the examiner has a certain amount of subjective control over whether the student passes or fails. When a candidate fails a checkride, the examiner has the discretion to either (a) end the checkride immediately, or (b) allow the student to complete the remaining objectives of the checkride, and defer the failed task to a retake. The checkride may not continue without the consent of the applicant. During the retake, the examiner is only required to test the previously failed or uncompleted items, but is at liberty to retest any items previously passed, as well as fail the candidate again based on them. If the checkride has to be stopped due to any reason besides student pilot failure, e.g. weather setting in, the examiner will issue a letter of discontinuance, which will state which maneuvers have been completed, so that the re-take checkride can be limited only to the maneuvers that haven't been completed yet.

It is the sixth of seven novels in the Shadow Children series. Plot introduction The general plot revolves around the government's lies about an overpopulated world in order to gain control of the Earth's resources. In this turmoil, the democratic government has been overthrown and a totalitarian government has been put in its place. Laws established by the regime prohibit a family from having more than two children to lower the rate of birth. Children born after the second child - referred to as \\"shadow children\\" - will be killed. Plot summary Matthias, Percy, and Alia, (from Among the Betrayed) are introduced once again. At Niedler School they are apprehended along with many other children and put in a truck to be taken, supposedly, to a work camp. They are saved when Matthias finds a nail, slashes the tires and crashes into a tree that falls, injuring Alia in the process, and allows them to escape. They run immediately to the forest, and Percy is shot in a crossfire between Population Police and Rebels while they are trying to find a place to hide. Matthias is able to drag Percy and Alia, now both critically ill, into a rebel hideout cabin, whose dwellers are killed by the Population Police, and then he runs to Mr. Hendrick's cottage to get help. He returns from Mr. Hendrick's cottage with Mrs. Talbot, a talented doctor and wife of a rebel leader, Mr. Talbot. Finding Alia and Percy missing, Matthias then ends up saving a Population Police Officer Tidwell, called Tiddy by his friends, from a deadly shootout. They end up at Population Police headquarters, where he finds an expected favor from the commander of the base as a result of his association with Tiddy, a favorite of the commander's. Tiddy goes to the forest and reports upon his return that he torched the entire area. Unexpectedly, he dies from poison soon afterward. Matthias grieves for Percy and Alia who he believes are now dead, though makes it appear as though he is grieving for Tiddy instead. The commander provides Matthias with special allowances, believing that Matthias is devastated by Tiddy's death, and Matthias pretends to enjoy the commander's company to avoid getting into trouble. Matthias soon encounters Nina, working undercover at the headquarters, and she reluctantly reveals what she, Lee (Luke Garner), and several other allies are doing in hopes of overthrowing the Population Police. The commander also takes the boy to a warehouse full of food, where Matthias realizes that he must stop grieving over Percy and Alia and help Nina and her friends. Thanks to Matthias, they are soon able to overhear many of the commander and the Population Police's plans, including one involving Jason Barstow, a boy who betrayed Nina to the Population Police. Matthias eventually escapes from headquarters to aid Nina and the others but is caught by Mike, a Population Police agent and Tiddy's best friend. However, Mike soon reveals that he is actually a double-agent, having previously saved Matthias and Nina when they were caught during a secret meeting to exchange information. They make their way to the warehouse and empty it of all its food by \\"lending\\" it to the local population. The warehouse, which also contains fake ID cards as well as the local population's real ID cards, is destroyed to prevent the Population Police from exacting a plan that would expose illegal thirds and other people targeted by the Population Police as enemies. The pair remain in hiding for several days before returning to Mr. Hendricks' house, where Matthias hopes to apologize to Mr. Talbot for abandoning Mrs. Talbot in the forest where Percy and Alia perished. However, when they arrive, Matthias is relieved and overjoyed to discover his friends and Mrs. Talbot are safe and alive. Mike reveals himself to be Nedley, an ally from Among the Brave. Matthias decides to remain at the Mr. Hendricks' cabin with his friends until he decides what he will do next with his life, though he is content to remain with Percy, Alia, and everyone else.

For some reason, Sir Henry's entry, \\"Og Livet g√•r\\" with music composed by S√∏ren and Leif Pedersen was disqualified and Kirsten took their place in the final, but in a somewhat consolation-prize style they sang as backing vocals for Kirsten. S√∏ren later decided to leave Sir Henry in favor of further cooperation with Kirsten, and the duo entered the Dansk MGP in 1984 as Hot Eyes with the song \\"Det' lige det\\" with music by S√∏ren and lyrics by Keld Heick (who also penned lyrics to all other Hot Eyes' Dansk MGP entries). The song became known in Denmark as the \\"swimming pool song\\", as at the end of the Dansk MGP performance Kirsten threw S√∏ren into a swimming pool by the stage. They won the contest and therefore represented Denmark at the Eurovision Song Contest 1984, taking the fourth place, even though they were unable to replicate the swimming pool gimmick. This was Denmark's best placing since 1963, when the country's entry won the contest. Kirsten was actually pregnant with her first son while singing at Eurovision. Riding on their popularity, they went on to win the Dansk MGP again in 1985 with \\"Sku' du sp√∏rg' fra no'en?\\" - the only ever second win in a row. It was only then that Kirsten decided to give up her work in the bank and embark on a full-time career in entertainment with Hot Eyes. The song was notable for featuring S√∏ren's nine-year-old daughter, Lea Bundgaard, who played a vital role in the performance. This time, however, they took only eleventh place at the ESC. In 1986 and 1987 Kirsten & S√∏ren entered the Dansk MGP as well, but did not win, coming fourth with \\"Sig det, som det er\\" and fifth with \\"Farvel og Tak\\" respectively. In the meantime, Kirsten began her theatrical career, appearing in a theatre play as well as musicals such as Chess or Les Mis√©rables. 1988 brought though was lucky for Hot Eyes, when their entry, \\"Ka' du se, hva' jeg sa'?\\" won the Dansk MGP again, making them record three-time winners of the contest (Tommy Seebach equalled this record in 1993). At the Eurovision Song Contest 1988 (where they were actually billed as Kirsten & S√∏ren), they also placed very favorably, coming third, which was Denmark's best placing in twenty five years. Kirsten was pregnant again (with her second son), but this time much more visibly - she gave birth only three weeks after the performance. Even though the duo did not split officially until 1991, they did not record together after 1988. In 1989, S√∏ren and Keld Heick wrote another song for the Dansk MGP together, but this time for Birthe Kj√¶r, winning the contest again. They both appeared on stage as backing singers for Birthe, along with Lei and Lupe Moe, who supported no fewer than ten Danish ESC entries from 1981 to 2002. \\"Vi maler byen r√∏d\\" came third again at the Eurovision. S√∏ren also tried his luck as composer in the 1993 and 1999 Dansk MGP, but did not win, and currently runs a recording company called \\"SB Studio\\" in Aalborg. Kirsten entered the Dansk MGP again in 1990 with \\"Inden L√¶nge\\" by another composer and different in style, but failed to secure another ticket to Eurovision. The phone number viewers were using to vote for this song was later revealed to have had technical problems, though it was too late to do anything about it. In 1992, she formed a trio named \\"Swing Sisters\\" with opera singer Kirsten Vaupel and actor Lise-Lotte Norup, with whom she toured Denmark and several other European countries. She also performed with S√∏ren on several special occasions later, reprising some of the Hot Eyes hits. Kirsten's solo career has gone from strength to strength. Famous in Denmark for her award-winning portrayal of √âdith Piaf in 1991. A new tour has been launched in January 2014 of a musical play called Spurven (the sparrow). The play focuses on the last 5 years of Piaf's life and starts at the time of the car crash that Piaf was involved in.

He is a patron saint of the city. Born of a noble Roman family, he became a convert to Christianity and subsequently a priest. As bishop of Bologna, he built the Church of Santo Stefano. Life The only certain historical information we possess concerning him is derived from a letter written by Bishop Eucherius of Lyon (died 450-455) to Valerianus (in P. L., L, 711 sqq.) and from Gennadius' De viris illustribus, XLI (ed. Czapla, M√ºnster, 1898, p. 94). Eucherius writes that the holy Bishop Petronius was then renowned in Italy for his virtues. From Gennadius we receive more detailed information: Petronius belonged to a noble family whose members occupied high positions at the imperial Court at Milan and in the provincial administrations at the end of the fourth and the beginning of the fifth centuries. His father (also named Petronius) was probably praefectus praetorio, since a Petronius filled this office in Gaul in 402-408. Eucherius seems to suggest (P. L., L, 719) that the future bishop also held an important secular position. Even in his youth Petronius devoted himself to the practices of asceticism, and seems to have visited the Holy Places in Jerusalem, perhaps on a pilgrimage. About 432 he was elected and consecrated Bishop of Bologna, where he erected a church to Saint Stephen (Santo Stefano), the building scheme of which was in imitation of the shrines on Golgotha and over the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. The buildings belong approximately to the period when Pope Leo I had basilicas erected in Rome and Galla Placidia in Ravenna. Petronius is believed to have written a work on the life of the Egyptian monks (Vit√¶ patrum √Ügypti monachorum); the author of this work, however, is Rufinus of Aquileia. The treatise De ordinatione episcopi, bearing the name of Petronius as author, is by the elder Petronius, who was a man of eloquence and wide acquaintance with the secular sciences. Morin has published a sermon entitled \\"In die ordinationis vel Natale episcopi\\" (Revue b√©n√©dictine, 1897, 3 sq.), which Gennadius ascribes to Bishop Petronius of Verona, whom Czalpa holds is Petronius of Bologna, but this assignment is not certain. According to Gennadius, Petronius died during the reign of Emperor Theodosius II and Valentinian III, i. e., before 450. In the twelfth century appeared a legendary life of the saint, whose relics were discovered in 1141. Shortly afterwards a church was erected in his honour at Bologna; a second, planned on a large seal, was begun in 1390 (see San Petronio Basilica). The feast of St. Petronius is celebrated on 4 October. In iconography, he is depicted as a bishop holding a model of Bologna in his hand.

It is a center of market and trade for the surrounding smaller villages and connects the smaller villages to cities like Nagpur, Chandrapur, Bhandara and Gondhia.

It also bears an inscription of the Naga Mucalinda (Fig. 3)\\" The excavations at Pauni have shown that the area was a center of Buddhism from the Maurya and Satavahana times, and coins of the early Satavahana ruler Satakarni I were discovered in connection with archaeological finds.\\"The excavations at Pauni, a village in the Bhandara district of Maharashtra, conducted jointly with the ASl, deserve a prominent mention in this connection. These excavations have revealed that Pauni was an important centre of the Hinayana Buddhism from the Maurya to the Satavahana period. Remains of some stupas, one of them of a larger diameter than that of the main stupa at Sanchi, were uncovered. The Buddhism establishment, which had a beginning in the Maurya period, enjoyed great prosperity under the Satavahanas as can be inferred from the excavated objects. Some interesting Satavahana and Kshtrapa copper and potin coins were also discovered. Of these particular preference must be made to a unique potin coin which has to be attributed to one of the early Satakarnis, preferably Satakarni l.\\" in One of the excavated stupas, the Suleman Tekri stupa, had a diameter of 41.6 meters, larger than the main stupa at Sanchi. Jagannath Tekri Stupa. There is an earthen mound to the south of Pauni, outside the fort-wall on the bank of the Balasamudra water body. A temple to Jagananath is built on the mound. Nagpur University has carried out archeological excavations around the Jagannath temple in 1969. These excavations unearthed the remains of a large stupa of the early historic period. The stupa has a diameter of 38.1 meters and seems to have been worshipped from the 3rd century BCE to the 3rd century CE, undergoing several waves of enlargements and renovations. The excavations revealed also a number of carved pillars, some on the site, and other pieces now in the National Museum of India and the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya. A number of the pieces of this railing carry Brahmi inscriptions. Four gateways seemingly rather similar to those of Bharhut were also erected. The majority of the inscriptions record donations to the stupa, but one inscription mentions Mucalinda, the earliest reference to this deity in India.

Another potin coin of Sri-Satakarni has been recently discovered at Pauni 2.

Rupiamma is probably related to the Saka Western Satraps. This memorial pillar is thought to mark the southern extent of the conquests of the Western Satraps, much beyond the traditionally held boundary of the Narmada River. As a \\"Great Satrap\\", Rupiamma may alternatively, or jointly, have been a feudatory or representative of the Kushan Empire, which would suggest that Kushan control also extended this far south, beyond the generally accepted southern boundary formed by the Narmada river. The use of the word \\"Kumara\\" may also mean that Rupiamma was the son of a Great Satrap, rather than holding the title himself.\\"The pillar inscription of Rupiamma from Pauni (1-41) may present a similar example. In it, Rupiamma is described as Mahakhattava-kum√§ra ; he is a son or prince of the mah√§ksatrapa; the title in itself is felt to be sufficient identification\\" Demographics Pauni (Bhandara District).

It was built in 1898-1902 and was restored after World War II. It is still operational and currently houses the Warsaw Jewish Commune, as well as other Jewish organizations. History Before World War II the Jewish community of Warsaw, one of the largest Jewish communities in the world at that time, had over 400 houses of prayer at its disposal. However, at the end of 19th century only two of them were separate structures, while the rest were smaller chapels attached to schools, hospitals or private homes. The synagogue in 1909 The earliest Round Synagogue in the borough of Praga served the local community since 1839, while the Great Synagogue (erected in 1878) was built for the reformed community. Soon afterwards a need arose to build a temple also for the orthodox Jewry. Between 1898 and 1902 Zalman No≈ºyk, a renowned Warsaw merchant, and his wife Ryfka financed such temple at Twarda street, next to the neighbourhood of and Grzybowski Square. The building was designed by a famous Warsaw architect, Karol Koz≈Çowski, author of the Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra Hall.Virtual Shtetl The fa√ßade is neo-romanticist, with notable neo-Byzantine elements. The building itself is rectangular, with the internal chamber divided into three aisles. Interior of the synagogue The synagogue was officially opened to the public on May 26, 1902. In 1914 the founders donated it to the Warsaw Jewish Commune, in exchange for yearly prayers in their intention. In 1923 the building was refurbished by Maurycy Grodzie≈Ñski, who also designed a semi-circular choir that was attached to the eastern wall of the temple. In September 1939 the synagogue was damaged during an air raid. During World War II the area was part of the Small Ghetto and shared its fate during the Ghetto Uprising and then the liquidation of the Jewish community of Warsaw by the Nazis. After 1941 the Germans used the building as stables and a depot. Restoration After the war the demolished building was partially restored and returned to the Warsaw Jewish Commune, but the reconstruction did not start. It was completely rebuilt between 1977 and 1983 (officially opened April 18, 1983). It was also then that a new wing was added to the eastern wall, currently housing the seat of the commune, as well as several other Jewish organizations. Currently it is in use daily as both a place of worship as well as a place of gathering.

When the sheriff discovers Gator is working for the federal government, Connors sends his enforcer, Big Bear, after him. Gator decides to go after the sheriff, leading to an epic car chase finale.

It was announced by Levy-Gardner-Laven in October 1971 as part of a seven-picture slate they intended to make for United Artists over two years. It was an original script by Norton, who often wrote for the producers. The villain of the script was based on the real life Sheriff Marlin Hawkins. Burt Reynolds' casting was announced in February 1972. He had worked with the writer and producers previously on Sam Whiskey (1969). Reynolds called the film \\"the beginning of a whole series of films made in the South, about the South and for the South. No one cares if the picture was ever distributed north of the Mason-Dixon line because you could make back the cost of the negative just in Memphis alone. Anything outside of that was just gravy. It was a well done film. Joe Sargent is an excellent director. He's very, very good with actors. And it had some marvellous people in it whom nobody had seen before. Ned Beatty for example. I had to fight like hell to get Ned in the film.\\"Workaholic Burt Reynolds sets up his next task: Light comedy Siskel, Gene. Chicago Tribune 28 Nov 1976: e2. The film was almost directed by Steven Spielberg. He had made Duel, Something Evil and Savage and decided to direct White Lightning the same year. \\"I spent two-and-a-half months on the film,\\" said Spielberg, \\"met Burt once, found most of the locations and began to cast the movie, until I realized it wasn't something that I wanted to do for a first film. I didn't want to start my career as a hard-hat, journeyman director. I wanted to do something that was a little more personal.\\" So he quit White Lightning and went to do Sugarland Express, which he found more challenging for three reasons, \\"the changing relationships among the trio in the car, the nature of 'the chase,' and how to handle the digressions.\\" Joseph Sargent signed to direct in May. Filming began July 15, 1972. Shooting took place in and around Little Rock, Arkansas. Hal Needham did stunts on the film. The film's music was written by Charles Bernstein. Some of this score was also used by Quentin Tarantino in his 2003 film Kill Bill: Volume 1 and his 2009 film Inglourious Basterds. Bernstein's score was released by Intrada Records in May 2010. Reception The film has a score of 86% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 7 reviews. Roger Greenspun of The New York Times called it \\"a fairly awful movie\\" with \\"endless car chases, which are a crushing bore.\\"Greenspun, Roger (August 9, 1973). \\"'White Lightning' Strikes Local Houses\\". The New York Times. 30. Variety characterized the film as \\"hit- and-miss,\\" adding, \\"Reynolds is quite up to all the demands of his smashing role, as he forges toward his goal. Too often, though, too much footage is devoted to incidentals that detract.\\"\\"Film Reviews: White Lightning\\". Variety. June 6, 1973. 18. Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film three-and- a-half stars out of four and wrote that \\"what sets 'White Lightning' apart from a demolition derby is the special work of the entire cast in creating a totally believable world out of characters that we've seen countless times before ... Only an abrupt ending keeps 'White Lightning' from achieving some level of greatness.\\"Siskel, Gene (July 17, 1973). \\"Burt mixes 'shine and fists in 'White Lightning'\\". Chicago Tribune. Section 2, p. 4. Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times called it \\"that scarce commodity, a stirring, satisfying summer-weight entertainment ... Reynolds delivers a varied, screen-commanding star turn which is a pleasure to watch.\\"Champlin, Charles (August 16, 1973). \\"A Star Turn in 'Lightning'\\". Los Angeles Times. Part IV, p. 11. Gary Arnold of The Washington Post wrote that the film \\"begins straight and then starts messing around at random. The inevitable result is an expendable movie, neither straightforward crime melodrama nor consistent shaggy-dog comedy.\\"Arnold, Gary (July 19, 1973). \\"'Lightning' Strikes Out\\". The Washington Post. B15. Clyde Jeavons of The Monthly Film Bulletin declared, \\"Moonshine melodrama with a veneer of serious intent which is rapidly planed away by Burt Reynold's frivolous acting and Joseph Sargent's weakness for car chases.\\" A sequel, Gator, was released in 1976. Legacy On the TV series Archer, the film and its sequel are favorites of the title character, Sterling Archer, though he believes Gator to be the stronger installment. He gets the films easily confused, though, as he believes several key scenes from White Lightning to be in the sequel. Reynolds later said the film \\"was a breakthrough in that area of blending comedy and action. And it made a lot of money, so other people began trying to do the same thing. They thought, 'Well, he smashed up sixty cars and it made a lot of money, so we'll do a hundred crashes.' But that had nothing to do with its success as a comedy.\\" See also * List of American films of 1973 References External links   * Encyclopedia of Arkansas History & Culture Category:1973 films Category:1970s action comedy films Category:American films Category:American action comedy films Category:English-language films Category:Films about alcoholic drinks Category:Films about automobiles Category:Films directed by Joseph Sargent Category:Films scored by Charles Bernstein Category:Films set in Arkansas Category:Films set in prison Category:United Artists films Category:1973 comedy films ","title":"White Lightning (1973 film)"},{"id":"5806118","text":"Pavagada or Pavgada is a taluk in the Tumkur district in Karnataka, India.http://www.pavagadatown.mrc.gov.in/ Historically it was part of the Mysore kingdom.

At its peak of popularity during the 1980s, it had become a form of \\"illegal\\" public transportation. Subsequently, due to unauthorized use of the vans, the government banned them as a form of public transportation and required all existing nanny vans to register and operate on designated routes. All nanny vans in service today are required by the government to have both the Chinese text \\"Â≠∏Ê†°ÁßÅÂÆ∂Â∞èÂ∑¥\\" and the English text \\"SCHOOL PRIVATE LIGHT BUS\\" in capital letters painted on the sides of the vans. There were 1769 such buses registered with the Transport Department in 2014.\\"LCQ6: Provision of school bus services.\\" Chan Hak-kan, Anthony Cheung Bing-leung. Press Releases. Government. 2 July 2014. Retrieved 2017-06-12. History Nanny vans were originally a small van operated in Hong Kong to ferry pre-school children from their homes to their nurseries and kindergartens. Most of these vans were run by private agreement between the schools and the drivers. These original nanny vans seated four to five adults; other seats in the van were removed and replaced with a narrow sofa around the cabin. With such an arrangement, the van could transport 10‚Äì12 children. During the 1980s, when living standards in Hong Kong were rising, some drivers wanted to earn extra income with their vans. Therefore, when it was time for secondary schools to have their lunch break, the vans started to transport the younger children back to school. Each student paid about $1‚Äì2, which was about half the price for them to share a taxi. Most of these vans served North Point, where they either stopped at the North Point Pier or under Fortress Hill. They picked up school children until all the seats were occupied and traveled along the Cloud View Road, making stops at each school. Regulated service In the early 1990s, there was an accident in North Point involving a nanny van and its passengers were injured. The accident exposed the illegal service and the government issued a ban and required all nanny vans to run only along designated routes. Nanny vans are still available in Hong Kong. Many schools are able to afford their own vans. Less affluent schools continue to sign agreements with van drivers. These drivers provide school bus services for the more remote areas of Hong Kong, transporting school children from rural villages to schools in urban areas. The nanny vans have grown to the size of a mini bus. School private light buses are one of three legal classified vehicles for transport of schoolchildren. The other two are non- franchised public buses and private buses operated by schools directly. There were similar services introduced also elsewhere, for example in Richmond, Virginia.

He made his name at the Boom Boom Room and was, for a time, synonymous with the cabaret nightclub as its resident performer. Having spent nearly two decades as an entertainer, he has amassed a string of television, stage, and film credits. Currently, he is a regular performer at Hard Rock Caf√©. He released his biographical book, Kumar: From Rags To Drag, in September 2011. In his book, he publicly came out as gay, making him the first entertainer in Singapore to come out. He is one of the few openly-gay public figures in Singapore. Early life Kumar was born on 10 August 1968 in a South Indian Mudaliar family from Madras and a Singaporean mother. His father, Chinna Dorai, arrived in Singapore in the mid-1960s and worked as a caretaker for the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA). When Kumar was four, his parents divorced; he was raised by his mother‚Äôs younger sister, Rani Vyarakannoo, a policewoman, who eventually became his step-mother. Kumar grew up in a terrace house on Paterson Road with his parents, three siblings ‚Äì three older sisters, and six dogs. He went to Cairnhill and Selegie Primary schools and later attended Monk‚Äôs Hill Secondary School. As a child, he aspired to be a classical Bharathanatyam dancer and joined the Indian Dance Society in his secondary school. After his O levels, Kumar worked for six months as a cashier at a convenience store before enlisting for National Service, where he served as a combat signaler in the army and held the record for one of the fastest times in his cohort for the completion of the 2.4 km run. Stand Up Comedy In 1987, after serving his conscription, Kumar had his first exposure to the entertainment industry at 22 years old as a singing waiter at Cheers! The Fun Pub at the Novotel Orchid. Two years later, he began a stint as an entertainer at Haw Par Villa. In 1991, Kumar landed a gig at the now defunct Laughs Comedy Club in Tanglin Shopping Centre playing the role of an Indian drag queen. It was then when he realized comedy was his calling. Kumar‚Äôs big break came in 1992 when he was offered the starring role at the newly established Boom Boom Room in New Bugis Street which opened on National Day the same year. At Boom Boom Room, Kumar‚Äôs routines included song and dance, in addition to stand-up comedy. He wrote most of his own material and had initially started with clean jokes which proved unpopular, drawing chilly responses from his audience; that led him to go with more risqu√© ones for which he is now known. His cross-dressing which came about as a comic device and a gimmick eventually became his trademark as he came to be Singapore‚Äôs most well-known drag queen with his caustic wit and biting observations about life in Singapore, particularly about politics, race, and sex. Because of the provocative nature of his shows, Kumar‚Äôs performances were subjected to scrutiny and monitoring by the police. Once a year, he had to perform his entire show for an audience of police officers before he was allowed to put it up for the public. After moving to Far East Square in 2000, Boom Boom Room closed for good in 2005, and Kumar started performing at a theatre-bar called Gold Dust (of which he was part-owner) in Orchard Towers. In 2007, he sold his share of the club and has since been splitting his time between Hard Rock Caf√© and 3-Monkeys Caf√© where he performs regularly for four nights a week. Kumar is also a regular performer at Chameleon Lounge Club on Dempsey Road.  Television  Kumar made his television debut in 1993 as one of the three hosts of The Ra Ra Show, a comedy chat show which started airing in April 1993. The show proved to be short-lived and ended its run after ten months when viewers complained about the liberal use of Singlish and perceived sexual innuendoes in the show. It would be eight years before he returned to television, starring opposite Hong Kong actress Carol Cheng in the English sitcom, Oh Carol!, in 2001. Since then, Kumar has appeared in various English television programs such as My Sassy Neighbour and Front; he also hosted three seasons of Rusiyo Rusi, a travelogue cooking show, and played the titular character in the crime comedy series P.I.K. (Private Investigator Krish) on Vasantham Central. One of the most salient differences between Kumar‚Äôs appearances on television and his shows in clubs is that he does not perform in drag on television.  Stage/Theatre  Kumar‚Äôs first foray into theatre was in 1997 when he was offered a role in Dick Lee‚Äôs musical, Hot Pants. This was quickly followed by Kumar: A Life Alive, a comedy musical based on his own journey to stardom. His other stage credits include Meena and Me (1999), ABUSE SUXXX!!! (2001), and Not Guilty (2004). Kumar has also taken his stand-up comedy to the stage, putting up a number of one-man shows both abroad and at home, such as his performance at Wallpaper* magazine‚Äôs first anniversary party in London, and, at home, a semi-annual series of shows produced by Dream Academy, from Kumar The Queen (2007), Crazy Christmas (annual), Kumar: Stripped Bare & Standing up (2009-2010), Kumar‚Äôs Amazing Race (2011-2012), Kings and Queens of Asia (2011-2012) by Comedy Club Asia and Kumar: What makes a man a man? (2013-2014). Filmography Kumar has been increasingly sought after on the silver screen. His latest major role was as Minister of Toilets, Kumari Kuppusamy in Everybody's Business (2013). He also played mother to Vernon in One Leg Kicking (2001). Personal Life From childhood, Kumar had dressed at home as a girl. When his parents discovered him cross-dressing as an adult for his work, his father did not speak to him for seven years, and his mother thought he was a prostitute. Due to transgender discrimination in Singapore, it is common for trans women to work as prostitutes. While he first came out to fans as gay in his 2009 performance Kumar: Stripped Bare and Standing Up, Kumar made it official in his 2011 biography. Kumar has hinted at his sexual orientation and gender identity through his comedy routines and televised interviews. He has stated that he is \\"half man half woman\\", that he is \\"more woman than man\\", and that he has been called out by children as transgender. In Singaporean culture, the \\"drag queen\\" identity falls under the transgender umbrella, and a scholar from the National University of Singapore noted that Kumar was the first transgender celebrity to serve as an ambassador to the annual LGBT Pride event in Singapore called Pink Dot. Same-sex sexual activity, as well as being openly gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender in Singapore, remains illegal. For these reasons, Kumar keeps the identities of his significant others private.

Geology  Flora and fauna Name Origin The name \\"Bouquet\\" is the name of the Californian historic ranch established upland from the crossing of Bouquet Canyon Road and 'Newhall' Ranch Road, and founded by a French vacher who landed in California off a Spanish ship. Buque is Spanish for \\"ship\\" and bouquet derives from the ranch's French origins. Bouquet Ranch is the only section of historic St. Francis ranch that was legally parceled off and continued under the terms of the Protocol of Quer√©taro, specified in the Californian Constitution, before agents of the Northeastern Establishment were sent West to take control of lands and cities in the wake of the American Civil War. Today, the canyon is nicknamed the \\"Hangman's Canyon\\" or \\"Dead Man's Canyon\\", after an event in the Castaic Range War where a young cowboy was lynched.Boston, John.

It is the seventh and final book in the Shadow Children series. Plot summary Luke Garner is an illegal third child along with Trey, Nina, Matthias, Percy, and Alia. He has been working from within the Population Police at the stables in hopes of slowly overthrowing them and bringing about freedom. When he is chosen to accompany a sergeant on a mission to distribute new identification cards to citizens, Luke unknowingly brings about the catalyst of change when he refuses to shoot a defiant old woman and runs away, leaving his sergeant in the hands of a group of angry villagers who despise the Population Police. After several days of surviving alone, haunted by the memory of his friend Jen Talbot, run-ins with a selfish stable boy who was with Luke and his sergeant at the time of the incident, and attempting to avoid the Population Police at all costs, Luke finds his way to another village filled with starving people. They save Luke from being executed by the Population Police when they arrive; one man in particular named Eli reveals that the village no longer cares about their own lives and will do anything to help those in need like Luke. In the past, Eli and other villagers willingly betrayed a family with a third child in order to obtain food for their own families. That villagers realize their wrongs much too late and found many of their family members taken away by the Population Police with nothing in return. When people are heard coming to the village, Eli helps Luke escape with a quilt made by his daughter Aileen. Luke wanders into another village and discovers the Population Police has finally been overthrown. With many villagers, they travel to the government headquarters as large groups of people reveal and relate their own stories on television. Luke, on the other hand, is apprehensive and discovers Oscar Wydell, Smits Grant's former bodyguard intends to claim leadership and collaborates with Aldous Krakenaur, former Population Police leader, to blame Third Children for all the Population Police's crimes. While the news broadcast originally intended to allow people voice their opinions, Luke sees that the leaders are already beginning to poison the unwitting populace with propaganda and it is impossible for any opinion other than one that blames Third Children for all crimes to be heard. Desperate, Luke rides one of the horses (Jenny, he called it in memory of Jen) onto the stage to avoid the security guards and voices his opinion and reveals to the world what he is saying is the absolute truth as he is a third child. Protected by Philip Twinings, a prominent news anchor from before the era of the Population Police who had hoped that opinions could have been openly shared, Luke tells his life story (chronicling the events from the beginning of the series to the present) and the stories of his friends Trey, Nina, and Matthias, and of Smits and how Oscar was his bodyguard, and people come to realize that the government is undeniably at fault. Shortly after, the people discover that Oscar escaped with Krakenaur during Luke's speech. Luke finally finds his friends Nina and Trey in the crowd and finds out that all his friends met up at Mr. Hendricks home. Luke thinks about all the things he's always wanted to do and realizes that it is all possible.

It is sometimes referred to as the Chihuahuan hook-nosed snake because it is commonly found in the Chihuahuan Desert. Taxonomy The Western hooknose snake was originally described as a species new to science in 1860 by Edward Drinker Cope, who at that time named it Gyalopion canum. However, in 1883 Samuel Garman reassigned this species to the genus Ficimia, changing its scientific name to Ficimia cana. (Because Gyalopion is neuter, and Ficimia is feminine, the ending of the specific name had to be changed from \\"-um \\" to \\"-a \\"). After slightly more than 100 years, Robert C. Stebbins in 1985 returned this species to the genus Gyalopion, as Gyalopion canum, due to distinct morphological characteristics. Geographic range G. canum is found in the United States, from western Texas to southeastern Arizona, and into northern and central Mexico. Description The Western hooknose snake is a small species, growing to in total length (including tail). It is gray or grayish brown in color, with 25-48 dark brown or black blotches down the back,Smith HM, Brodie ED Jr (1982). Reptiles of North America: A Guide to Field Identification. New York: Golden Press. 240 pp. (paperback). (Gyalopion canum, pp. 174-175). and a cream-colored underside. It has a slightly upturned snout, to which the common name, \\"hooknose\\", refers. The smooth dorsal scales are arranged in 17 rows at midbody. Behavior G. canum is a nocturnal burrower, most often found under rocks. Habitat The Western hooknose snake prefers slightly sandy habitats, near a permanent water source. Diet The diet of G. canum consists primarily of spiders and centipedes, but it will also eat small snakes and scorpions.Stebbins RC (2003). A Field Guide to Western Reptiles and Amphibians, Third Edition. The Peterson Field Guide Series ¬Æ. Boston and New York: Houghton Mifflin. 533 pp. (paperback). (Gyalopion canum, p. 396 + Plate 47 + Map 174). Reproduction The Western hooknose snake is oviparous. Sexually mature females may lay up to 5 eggs in June. Defense One of the primary defensive behaviors of G. canum is to make a popping noise with its cloaca, i.e., farting. According to an article in the August, 2000 issue of Discover magazine, during a laboratory experiment carried out by Bruce Young, a morphologist at Lafayette College, the snakes only farted when they felt threatened, and some farted so energetically that they lifted themselves off the ground.Glausiuz J (August 2000). \\"A Pop a Day Keeps the Predators Away\\".

The Hindu genealogy registers at Peohwa, Haryana are kept here at the Pruthudak Tirath on the banks of Sarasvati river. History Pehowa is an ancient city and its religious significance is mentioned in several puranas, such as Skanda Purana (1st to 5th century CE), Markandeya Purana (4th to 6th century CE) and Vamana Purana (5th to 11th century CE).Kurukshetra Development Board can get the responsibility of Saraswati Tirtha, Dainik Jagran, 4 Feb 2019. Two inscriptions dated ninth Century CE found at Pehowa mention that the place was controlled by Mahendrapala, of Kanauj and a Vishnu temple was constructed at this place by Tomara family, but such historic temple is not found in present day Pehowa. The earliest extant historical reference to the Tomara dynasty occurs in the Pehowa inscription issued during the reign of the Pratihara king Mahendrapala I (r. c. 885-910 CE) [Tomars of Delhi were vassals of Partiharas of Kannauj]. This undated inscription states that Jaula of the Tomara family became prosperous by serving an unnamed king. His descendants included Vajrata, Jajjuka, and Gogga. The inscription suggests that Gogga was a vassal of Mahendrapala I. It records the construction of three Vishnu temples by Gogga and his step-brothers Purna- raja and Deva-raja. The temples were located at Prithudaka (IAST: P·πõth≈´daka; Pehowa), on the banks of the river Sarasvati. No information is available about the immediate successors of Gogga. The Pehowa inscription suggests that this particular Tomara family was settled around the Karnal area. However, F. Kielhorn suggested that this Tomara family actually resided in Delhi: they may have visited Pehowa on pilgrimage, and built a temple there.

In Pehowa, 11.72% of the population is under 6 years of age. Punjabi and Haryanvi dialects are spoken in the countryside, while Hindi is the most commonly spoken language. Religious significance Pehowa is considered religious place of high importance and to highlight the sanctity of the place, Haryana State Government has banned sale, possession, consumption and purchase of non- vegetarian food in the town limits. Slaughtering of animals is also banned in the town through the court orders. The town is considered sacred to Hindus and Sikhs. Places of significance Sarawati River and Temple - Pitrudhak Teerth - Pehowa Prithudak Teerth Pehowa is a very ancient town, believed to pre-date the Mahabharat War by many centuries as it flourished on the banks of now dried up Saraswati River in those days. By the time of the Mahabharata war, the river had long dried up, yet was still a very holy place where people offered \\"Pinda Pradhan\\" to their ancestors. It is still called as \\"Pitrudhak Teerth\\" and was the holiest place for these oblations to be done much before Prayag or Gaya as the local legend goes. Lord Krishna is believed to have taken the Pandavas to this place before the war started and made them take the blessings of Sarasawati Mata and of their ancestors. Presently, the river does not have any inflows nor outflows and is stagnant. The Pillars on the entrance to the Saraswati Temple date many centuries. Saraswati Sarovar is located in this town, where people perform pooja and religious rituals. Prithudak is one of the important point in the 48 kos parikrama of Kurukshetra.

Habitat and Ecology The Dowagiac River is unusual in southern Michigan, being similar in temperature and flow to northern trout streams such as the Au Sable River. High groundwater contributions along much of the Dowagiac River‚Äôs length provide cold temperatures and steady base flow throughout the summer season. In July river temperatures range in the middle 60's which is ideal for non-native brown trout (Salmo trutta). There are two dams in the watershed: Lower Mill Pond Dam on Dowagiac Creek upstream from the city of Dowagiac and Barron Lake Road Dam on McKinzie Creek. Pucker Street Dam was the only dam on the Dowagiac River mainstem, located upstream from the confluence with the St. Joseph River.

This program was created in response to the September 11, 2001 attacks, in recognition of the fact that the individuals who piloted the hijacked aircraft first learned to fly at US flight schools. The mission of the program is to ensure that foreign students seeking training at flight schools regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) do not pose a threat to aviation or national security. Section 612 of the Vision 100 ‚Äì Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act (Public Law 108-176, December 12, 2003) prohibits flight schools regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) from providing flight training to a foreign student unless the Secretary of Homeland Security first determines that the student does not pose a threat to aviation or national security. Vision 100 transferred responsibility for conducting security threat assessments for foreign students seeking flight training from the Department of Justice to the Department of Homeland Security. On September 20, 2004, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) issued an interim final rule establishing the Alien Flight Student Program (AFSP). Persons seeking flight training must submit a request if they are not citizens or nationals of the U.S. and: *They wish to receive flight training in the U.S. or its territories, regardless of whether training will lead to an FAA certificate or type rating; and/or *They wish to receive flight training from an FAA-certificated facility, provider, or instructor that could lead to an FAA rating whether in the U.S. or abroad. (NOTE-Certain exemptions to AFSP published in 2004 and 2005 are still in effect.) The rule as written has a broad scope, and at first seemed to pilots to extend to required regular flight reviews as well proficiency training given to non-citizen private pilots. After consultation with the pilot community, the TSA issued clarifications restricting the scope of the program: for example, in small airplanes, it only applies to pilots undergoing training for an initial certificate, a multi-engine rating, or an instrument rating. Candidates log onto the AFSP Candidate website to submit their background information and flight training request(s). Once the application process is completed, the AFSP performs a security threat assessment to determine whether the Candidate poses a threat to aviation or national security.

Time magazine's millennium issue recognized him as second to Thomas Edison in this regard.http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,998676,00.html The article omitted non-US citizens. De Groote invented and patented many of the de-emulsifying agents that separate crude oil from salt, sulfur, and water. Without de-emulsification, most of the oil pumped in the US for the last century would have been too corrosive for pipelines or tankers and would have been discarded. Petrolite was De Groote's employer of 36 years. De Groote was recruited to the firm from the Mellon Institute in 1924 upon the death of the company's founder, William S. Barnickel. Of Dutch-Jewish ancestry, De Groote was born in Wheeling, West Virginia on February 27, 1895, to Luis De Groote and Jennie De Groote (n√©e Fuld). He attended the Sistersville, West Virginia High School. De Groote graduated from Ohio State University in 1915 with a degree in chemical engineering. He took a second chemical engineering degree in 1942, also from Ohio State, and was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Science in 1955. He was awarded the Lamme Medal in 1950 by the College of Engineering for \\"meritorious achievement in engineering and the chemical arts\\". He was also a member of Tau Beta Pi, an engineering society. De Groote, in his work in flavorings at the Mellon Institute, was rumored to have been hired by Coca-Cola to re-formulate its syrups to eliminate the alcoholic ingredients that were outlawed during prohibition (the company does not acknowledge any changes to its recipes).

Dowie's \\"Piccanniny\\" drinking fountain, in the form of an Aboriginal child and made out of coloured concrete with a bronze water container, is near the playground. The park has been a site for many cultural and sporting events including Carnevale in Adelaide, the Adelaide International Horse Trials, Aerobic Challenge and various events in the Adelaide Festival, Adelaide Fringe and Feast festivals. The Fringe location in Rymill Park is known as \\"Gluttony\\". New master plans (2019‚Äì2020) In late 2019, the Council published a draft Master Plan and Community Land Management Plan (CLMP), inviting comment from the community both online and at a public meeting on 8 December. History Early history of the area Before European settlement, the eastern parklands were used by the Kaurna people, as a meeting and camping area. In the late 19th century, Poltpalingada Booboorowie, a personality well-known among the European settlers as Tommy Walker, a Ngarrindjeri man, and other Aboriginal people sometimes referred to as the \\"fringe-dwellers\\" camped in the area. They were forced to move from the area, first to the Adelaide Botanic Garden area and then to Glenelg. Creation of park (1960) Keith Conlon described the area as \\"bare, swampy in winter, and populated by cows\\" from the time that Adelaide was founded and the parklands established by Colonel Light, and 120 years later. The Adelaide Bowling Club moved to its present location, with its entrance off Dequetteville Terrace, in 1958. In 1959‚Äì60, Adelaide City Council made many improvements to the park area. Following a tour overseas, Town Clerk William Veale suggested an artificial lake, playground and picnic area. The new facilities were opened by Lord Mayor Charles John Glover in late 1960. The park was named after Sir Arthur Rymill, Lord Mayor of Adelaide from 1950 to 1954 and council member for 23 years, who had actively supported the extension and improvement of Adelaide‚Äôs parklands. The lake was constructed in 1959 and the rose gardens were created in the 1960s by excavating what was then the Bartels Road rubbish tip. Dual naming (2003) Following the Council's Reconciliation Vision Statement in 1997, it set about applying dual naming of many city sites and features, deciding on a Kaurna name in collaboration with appropriate authorities and community organisations. In 2003 the final group of names were endorsed, and the name Mullawirraburka was applied to Rymill Park. The name Mullawirraburka was the name of a Kaurna man, known to settlers as \\"King Jack\\" or \\"Onkaparinga Jack\\". His name derived from Kaurna words mulla ‚àí dry and wirra ‚Äì forest, which together made the name of Mullawirra, the \\"territory\\" in the Aldinga-Willunga area which Mullawirraburka inherited from his father ; and burka ‚Äì old man. Lake repair (2008) After being drained in November 2007 to make repairs addressing the leaking of per week, the lake was refilled in September 2008.  O-Bahn extension (2015‚àí2017)  The O-Bahn Busway tunnel passes under Rymill Park. In 2015, a plan to realign Rundle Road as part of a plan to extend O-Bahn bus services to and from the city of Adelaide created controversy. The plan would result in the removal of numerous long established regulated and significant trees. Critics of the plan included Mark Parnell MLC, Nick Xenophon and former Australian Democrats leader, Ian Gilfillan. Public objections to the redevelopment prompted the creation of the Rymill Park Alliance and the Save Adelaide's Rymill Park campaign and Facebook page. However, construction went ahead and was completed in 2017 December. Rymill Park and nearby Rundle Park was closed and a tunnel was built underneath them.  Flora and fauna  Many of the park's larger trees provide hollows and roosts which are utilised by various species for nesting and residence. Native birds species commonly seen in the park include crested pigeons, magpies, magpie-larks, eastern rosellas, rainbow lorikeets, Australian white ibis and various species of duck. Ducks are present year- round at the artificial lake which provides a permanent water source. Pacific black ducks and Australian wood ducks are the most commonly sighted species. Marsupials such as the brushtail possum rest in tree hollows by day and emerge at night to forage and feed.

Economy After partition of India, many skilled weavers of Dhaka came and settled in West Bengal around Shantipur in Nadia district and Ambika Kalna of Bardhaman district, both traditionally renowned centres for hand-woven fabrics. With government encouragement and support, the talented weavers soon revived their ancestral occupation and the art of exquisite weaving once again flourished. Today, finely woven feather-touch textiles and saris in exotic designs and colours are being produced in the vast weaving belt of Shantipur, Phulia, Samudragarh, Dhatrigram and Ambika Kalna‚Äîeach centre producing superb fabrics in its own unique weaving style. Dhatrigram produces jacquards and jamdanis while Kalna is famous for tangails and gorgeous jamdanis. Phulia and Samudragarh specialize in a combination of jacquard and jamdani work which are based on Tangail Saree Culture of Bangladesh while Santipur is known for superfine dhotis and jacquards.The produce is marketed through some whole sellers & co-operatives and various undertakings. But nowadays, the main problem in making the handicraft is the rising price of raw materials and inadequate supply of skilled labour (mainly from Cooch Behar district of West Bengal and Assam region). So, the economy based on Tant Saree is a diminishing economy and the next generation is not so much interested in this crafts. The weavers need some economic and administrative supports from the Government.

Pichhore has an average literacy rate of 52%, lower than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 63%, and female literacy is 40%. In Pichhore, 17% of the population is under 6 years of age. History It was a Jat principality before the rise of Scindias.Its rulers belong to deoderiya clan.Raja Pahar Singh helped Maharaja Jawahir Singh To expel Maratha from the Gird. Like their Bambrolia Kinsmen in Gohad the Doderiyan Jats of Pichhore were also reluctant emigrants from the Punjab. About the year 1340 A.D. Raja Bhagirath founded a settlement around the village of Keo some 35 miles South East of Gwalior, which subsequently became famous as Pichhor. Raja Bhargirath had four sons. namely Chandermani, Sinhmani, Akshamani and Mado Singh. Chandermani the eldest succeeded his father. On Chandermani's death, his only on Dhruve Angad became the ruler of Pichor. He started the building of Pichor fort in 1448 which was completed by his son Raja Hamir Deo the First, whose reign partly coincided and probably overlapped the reign of the famous Tomar chief Raja Man Singh. Hamir Deo the First saw hard days in his conflicts with the chiefs of Narwar and Orcha. But by the very able stratagem of his wife Ganga Kumari he was able to over come his problems and continued to rule Pichor for many years and was probably still alive when Babar appeared on the Indian scene. After that there is a hiatus in the Doderiyan tradition. During the rule of Hamir Deo the second, a contemporary of Shah Jahan I (1628-58 A.D.), the Pichor principality grew into a modest size. His just rule and martial exploits are to this day extolled by the itinerant bards of Northern Bundhel Khand. Hamir's sense of Justice is reputed to have led him to sentence his own beloved son to death for an unintentional misdemeanor in a hunting field. Hamir Deo was succeeded by Raja Padam Singh, who ruled Pichor during The greater part of Aurangzeb's reign. Padam Singh had two sons. Hindupati and Prithvipati. Hindupati was a reputed scholar and poet. He wrote a religions tract called Tattva-Bodha which is still extant. Hindupati was succeeded by his son Pahar Singh. During 1767, Pahar Singh had joined forces with Jawahar Singh for expelling the Maratha troops from the Bhind area and in the latter's expedition to Ajmer and Pushkar. However, about the year 1783-84 Pahar Singh had accepted a feudatory status under Mahadji Sindhia. Chhattar Singh successor of Pahar Singh was treacherously deprived of Pichor by Daulat Rao Sindhia. His wife's blood stained palm impression in the citadel at Pichor still commemorates her exile from that ancient fortress.

St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands Soil series as established by the National Cooperative Soil Survey of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service are a level of classification in the USDA Soil Taxonomy classification system hierarchy. The actual object of classification is the so-called soil individual, or pedon. Soil series consist of pedons that are grouped together because of their similar pedogenesis, soil chemistry, and physical properties. More specifically, each series consists of pedons having soil horizons that are similar in soil color, soil texture, soil structure, soil pH, consistence, mineral and chemical composition, and arrangement in the soil profile. These result in soils which perform similarly for land use purposes. The soil series concept was originally introduced in 1903. Soil series were originally intended to consist of groups of soils which were thought to be the same in origin but different in texture. Soils were thought to be alike in origin if they were derived from the same kind of rocks or if they were derived in sediments derived from the same kind of rocks and deposited at the same time. A soil series name generally is derived from a town or landmark in or near the area where the soil series was first recognized. For example, the Haugan Series was first identified near Haugan, Montana. The distribution of a given series is not necessarily restricted to the boundaries of only one county or state‚Äîfor example, the Hagerstown Series was first described near Hagerstown, Maryland, but has also been found as far away as Tennessee and Kentucky. Relationship to soil mapping Depending on the context, a soil series may be defined as either a taxonomic unit or a mapping unit. A taxonomic unit is a category belonging to a specific level of a classification system. It is a conceptual entity that describes the \\"central nucleus\\" or essential characteristics of a class. On the other hand, a mapping unit delineates areas of soil in the landscape (i.e. adjacent pedons or polypedons) that possess similar characteristics. The characteristics of a soil series (taxonomic unit) may or may not overlap either fully or partially with the characteristics of pedons within a given mapping unit. Mapping units consist of one or more components. Each component represents polypedons that belong to a particular soil series. The name of a map unit is usually named after the dominant component within the mapping unit. For example, the dominant component of the mapping unit LhE‚ÄîLily sandy loam, 15 to 35 percent slopes, very stony in the Greenbrier County, West Virginia soil survey is the Lily series, which comprises 80% of the mapping unit. The remaining 20% of the mapping unit consists of the Dekalb series, Berks series, and \\"soils that have stones covering less of the surface\\" than the Lily series.

It is famous for its textile products and handloom industry. Originally founded as a village, Pilkhuwa has by now grown to the size of a town. It is located on National Highway-24, which connects the National Capital Territory of Delhi to Lucknow, the capital city of Uttar Pradesh. History In the 12th century A.D., the city of Delhi was ruled by the Rajput King Raja Anangpal Singh Tomar. The etymology of \\"Pilkhuwa\\" lies in the story of an elephant named \\"Pil\\", that disappeared from Delhi state, after which the king sent his son to find it. When the search team made a stop at the village of Pilkhuwa, people gathered around them and began saying \\"Pil- Khuwa\\", meaning \\"Pil is lost\\". It was in the year 1235 that the village of Pilkhuwa was established by the Tomar Kings. However, in the 14th century, when the Tomar Kings were defeated by the Mughals, the Rajput population of Pilkhuwa was affected and they converted to Islam. Until 1976, Pilkhuwa fell into the Meerut district. In 1976, on the anniversary of Jawaharlal Nehru's birth, the then-chief minister N. D. Tiwari declared Ghaziabad as a new district. Later on, Ghaziabad was divided into two districts as Ghaziabad and Panchsheel Nagar by Bahujan Samaj Party chief minister Mayawati on 28 September 2011, and Pilkhuwa became part of Panchsheel Nagar. At the time, Panchsheel Nagar was the newly-given name to the city of Hapur by Mayawati; local people were unhappy about the name change, however. Due to political clashes between the Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party, the subsequent chief minister Akhilesh Yadav changed the district name to Hapur on 23 July 2012, retaining the original name. Finally, Pilkhuwa became part of Hapur district. Demographics As of 2011 Indian Census, Pilkhuwa had a total population of 83,736, of which 44,226 were males and 39,510 were females. Population within the age group of 0 to 6 years was 12,468. The total number of literates in Pilkhuwa was 55,936, which constituted 66.8% of the population with male literacy of 73.3% and female literacy of 59.5%.

In 303 or 304, at the beginning of the Diocletian persecution, a deacon called Romanus of Caesarea in Palestine suffered martyrdom at Antioch. He was taken prisoner, was condemned to death by fire, and was bound to the stake; however, as Emperor Galerius was then in Antioch, Romanus was brought before him. At the emperor's command Romanus' tongue was cut out. Tortured in various ways in prison he was finally strangled. Eusebius speaks of his martyrdom in De martyribus Palaestinae. PrudentiusPeristephanon, X in P.L., LX, 444 sqq. or page 235 of this PDF relates other details and gives Romanus a companion in martyrdom, a Christian by name Barulas. On this account several historians, among them Baronius, consider that there were two martyrs named Romanus at Antioch, though more likely there was but the one whom Eusebius mentions. Prudentius has introduced legendary features into his account, and his connection of the martyrdom of Barulas with that of Romanus is probably arbitrary.

Geography Pinarayi is from the district headquarters Kannur. The nearest town and railway station is Thalassery which is away. The village is surrounded by rivers on three sides, and the remaining boundaries consist of five panchayats: Kadirur, Dharmadom, Peralasseri, Vengad, Kottayam and Eranholi. The Arabian sea is just away. For administrational purposes the panchayat is divided into two villages Eruvatty and Pinarayi. Pinarayi consists of 15 wards and almost all wards contains one or more primary schools. History Hundreds of years ago feudal fights between Kottayam- Malabar and Kolothunadu rulers were common in this village and many people died during these fights. Thus it is believed that the name Pinarayi derived from pinam (Malayalam from \\"dead body\\") and Azhi means fire where cremations carried out. In the 1920s peasant and teachers organizations were strong in this village and there was widespread support for the freedom movement. As a part of the independence struggle, a boycott of foreign clothes was conducted in 1930, its leaders being AKG, AK Sankaran Nambiar, Kacherikkandi Chathukkutty and Thattari Kunhiraman. In 1938 seven thousand peasants marched from Pinarayi to Kottayam kovilakam for reducing varam and pattam (rent paid by peasants to landlords). The population of Pinarayi during that time was around 10,000. This was considered as the first instance of unified mass movement against landlordism. NE Balaram, NE Nanu, AK Gopalan, Kundancheri Kunhiraman master, Pandyala Gopalan Master, Pinarayi Krishnan master and TV Govindan Nair were the leaders. Pinarayi is considered as a CPI(M) bastion after the division of CPI in 1964, and the first meeting of the Communist party of India was held at a place called ParaParam in Pinarayi and communist party formally constituted in this meeting.

This residential 'township', located close to Chandigarh, is set over 1,800 feet above the sea level in a valley, overlooking the Sivalik Hills. Pinjore is known for Pinjore Gardens, Asia's best 17th Century Mughal garden, and the Hindustan Machine Tools (HMT) factory. History Etymology The town is named after the five Pandava brothers from Mahabharta, who during the time of their exile had stayed here for some time, hence the name Panchpura which later got corrupted to its current form, Pinjore.Haryana Samvad , Oct 2018, p38-40. Panchpura baoli Panchpura baoli, a step well has an inscription. Alexander Cunningham, founding Director-general of ASI, decipher the worn out letters of Pinjore Baoli inscription, which mentions that the old name of the place was Panchpura.Alexander Cunningham : Archaeological Survey of India, Report XIV, p.70. This inscription in the Pinjore Baoli (‚ÄòBaoli‚Äô means \\"step well\\") described this place as Panchpura (now known by the shorter name Pinjore). Prehistoric stone age era Neolithic Stone Age (7000 BCE - 5500 BCE) find were excavated from the banks of the stream (paleochannel of Saraswati river) flowing through HMT complex,Manmohan Kumar : Archaeology of Ambala and Kurukshetra Districts, Haryana, 1978, Mss, pp.240-241. by the Guy Ellcock Pilgrim who was a British geologist and palaeontologist, who discovered 15 million years (1.5 crore) old prehistoric human teeth and part of a jaw denoting that the ancient people, who were intelligent hominins dating as far back as 1,500,000 ybp Acheulean period, lived in Pinjore region near Chandigarh.Pilgrim, Guy, E. 'New Shivalik Primates and their Bearing on the Question, of the Evolution of Man and the Anthropoides, Records of the Geological Survey of India, 1915, Vol.XIV, pp. 2-61. Quartzite tools of lower Paleolithic period were excavated in this region extending from Pinjore in Haryana to Nalagarh (Solan district in Himachal Pradesh. Early medieval era Some parts of current Pinjore town are situated atop an early medieval era mound. Artifacts belonging to 9th century CE to 12th century CE, which show the development and diversity of Hinduism and Jainism, were excavated from here. These include ornamental structural pieces, pillars, sculptures and inscriptions, ; two figures of Ayudha Puras, fragments of a colossal image of Vishnu, statue of Shiva, another four armed Shiva, large head of Bhairava (hindu tantric deity), Kubera, seated Ganesha, head of Surya (sun god), Shakti images of Saivi (feminine form of Shiva), Durga, Parvati, Chamunda, standing Tirthankaras, another headless Tirthankara statue and other minor sculptures. Some of these have bene displayed in the Bhima Devi Temple, the old temple was destroyed by the islmic invaders and the present 8-11th CE temple is likely built on the same place under the old name, and the nearby ancient baoli still has old Hindu pillars. The excavation of the ancient temple in 1974 was a historic discovery linking the antiquarian finds to the establishment of the temple to the period between 8th and 12th centuries of Gurjar Pratihara School of Art. The excavations have revealed five ancient plinths or pedestals and over 100 beautiful sculptures. The direction of these plinths indicate that the temple was stylized to the Panchayatan group of temples, where the main shrine is surrounded by four subsidiary shrines, which is contemporaneous to the temples of Khajuraho and Bhubaneshwar. Erotic images of the Bhima Devi temple contemporary to Khajuraho temples, have earned it a nickname of Khajuraho of North India. In keeping with Hindu tradition of temple architecture, the outer walls of the temple complex are adorned with statues Ashta-Dikpalas like, Indra, Agni, Vayu, Varun & Ishan in the cardinal directions. The idols of Hindu gods and goddesses such as Shiva, Parvati, Vishnu, Ganesha and Kartikeya have been unearthed and most of them are now displayed in the museum (spread over an area of ) here. From these findings, the Archaeological Department has conjectured that the main deity at the temple may have been of Lord Shiva. Late medieval era In 1254 CE, Sultan Nasiruddin Mahmud (grandson of Iltutmish) captured and plundered the area around Pinjore, as recorded in Minhaj-ud-din bin Siraj-ud-din's Tabaqat-i Nasiri.Elliot and Dowson : The History of India As Told by its Own Historians, 1969, vol. II, P. 353 (Reprinted part). In 1399 CE, Pinjore was once again plundered by the forces of Timur on his way back from Delhi.Haryana Gazateer, Revennue Dept of Haryana, Capter-V.

It was constructed between 8th and 12th century AD. It is under protection of Haryana government. Pinjore Garden Rajasthani Mughal Gardens in Pinjore in Haryana Pinjore Gardens, also called Yadavindra Gardens, represent one of the most travelled excursions from Chandigarh. Located at Pinjore, in the state of Haryana, they fall at a distance of about 22 km from the 'City Beautiful', on the Chandigarh-Kalka Road. The gardens lie at the foothills of the lower Shivalik ranges and stands as an apt example of the Mughal Garden style. Spread over an area of 100 acres, Pinjore Garden serve as the venue of the annual Mango Festival. The gardens house a mini zoo, historic places, Japanese garden, nursery and a number of picnic spots. According to the Hindu Mythology, the Pandava Brothers rested here during their exile. History Early in the 17th century, Nawab Fidai Khan, a reputed architect and the cousin of Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb, made the design for the Pinjore Gardens. At that time, the Nawab was the Governor of the Province and during one of his tours, he happened to visit the Pinjore valley. He was so enchanted with the beauty of the place that he thought of making a beautiful garden there and this is how the concept of the gardens came into being. The Nawab designed the garden as per the classical Charbagh pattern and introduced a central waterway in the area. He planned both sides of the waterway to be planted with the patches of green bordered with flowers, along with cover the entire place with a number of trees, like traditional palm, cypress and magnolia. While Pinjore Gardens were still being created, goiter struck the women of the place. The courtiers of the Nawab immediately left the place, which forced him to quit as well. The palace later fell first under the reign of Raja of Sirmaur and finally, in 1775 AD, under Maharaja Amar Singh of Patiala. The latter consolidated Pinjore to his lands. He had a great admiration for the beauty engulfed in the garden and used to visit the place frequently. Amar Singh is credited with to improve the garden manifold. In 1966, Haryana was declared as an independent state and Pinjore Garden was handed over to it. Today, the garden continues to be one of the prime attractions of Haryana. Features Pinjore Garden is built in the typical Mughal style. It has a sloping ground and is adorned with fountains and grand pavilions. However, it differs from the other Mughal Gardens in respect that the seven terraces at Pinjore, instead of ascending, descend into a distance, creating a magical sight. The garden is full of varied species of beautiful, aromatic flowering plants, big trees, mango orchards, litchi orchards and several shrubs. The garden presents cool, shady walks and flagged pathways, which run to the reaches of the creeper-covered walls. Recently, the end structure of the doorway was made into a disc-like open-air theatre. The stiff outer wall of the garden is suggestive of the fort walls, which has now all around dieter pavilions housing the zoo. A watercourse traipsing from level to level sparkles in the sunlight, its pools reflecting white shining pavilions and balconies etched high against a blue sky. The stylishly arched balconies and shining fountains, luxuriant green lawns and murmuring watercourse, limpid pools, shady walks and colorful flowerbeds, unusual descending terraces and monumental gateways - all are carefully planned to give the magic effect. Besides the greenery and nature, one can find other attractions within Yadavindra Gardens, like a mini zoo, historic places, Japanese garden, nursery, and a number of picnic spots. The gardens are brightly illuminated at night. There is a Jalmahal within the garden, which is presently used as a restaurant. The garden is open from 7am to 10pm. The entry ticket for the garden is Rs.20 per head. Special programs are organized in the garden during the festivals, like Baisakhi and Mango Festival, which attract visitors from every corner of the country.

Biography  Roy Williams was born in Milam, Texas on February 14, 1883. His family moved to Many, Louisiana when he was five years old. Williams was not exposed to religion during his childhood; however, at the age of 16 he attended a revival at a Methodist church. It was then that he began practicing Methodism, and although he was originally ridiculed by his family for his decision, they eventually converted to Methodism themselves. In 1908, Williams attended the second General Assembly of the Church of the Nazarene at Pilot Point Texas with his wife Eunice Harvey Williams and was ordained a minister by Nazarene general superintendent Hiram F. Reynolds. Among the first graduates at Texas Holiness University, Williams became the president of the university in 1911 at the age of 28. As president, he changed the name to Peniel University, and it was renamed Peniel College by a later president. Williams resigned in 1913 to become an evangelist, which he continued until 1916 when he was named the General Superintendent of the Church of the Nazarene after the deaths of the two current superintendents. At 33 years old, he was the youngest person to hold that position, and a later General Assembly set the age limit to 35. He served from 1916 until the end of his life in 1946, the longest time that anyone had ever served. Williams was to give a speech in Columbus, Georgia on October 21, 1945; however, he woke up that morning feeling ill and unable to talk, so the pastor of the church, Rev. Joseph Bierce, took him to the hospital. When he was fit to travel again, he was taken to his cabin in Missouri. He died on March 25, 1946, days after his arrival at his cabin. The library on the campus of Southern Nazarene University is named after him.  External links  * Biography of Dr. Roy T.
