It was used in commercial computer games that were stored on Compact Cassette tape and loaded using the Datassette. Invade-a-Load allowed the user to play a small clone of the famous Space Invaders game while the main game was loading. This initial minigame was loaded in under a minute, providing entertainment while waiting for the actual game to load, which could take a further five to ten minutes. On at least one occasion, a reviewer expressed their preference for Invade-a-Load over the main game itself. It mostly appeared in games sold in the United Kingdom, as, by the time it was written, the Commodore market in the United States had mostly switched to floppy disk media.  History and use  The loader was written by Richard Aplin for Mastertronic's own use. The loader itself has a copyright date of 1987, but the first games that used the loader showed up in 1988. Over the following years, Mastertronic used the loader in dozens of titles. The loader was also memorable for the soundtrack, originally made by Rob Hubbard for the Mastertronic title One Man and His Droid.

It is the seat of the Archbishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Mobile. The cathedral is named for Mary, mother of Jesus, under her title, Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a contributing property to the Church Street East Historic District and Lower Dauphin Street Historic District and is listed on the Historic Roman Catholic Properties in Mobile Multiple Property Submission History Mobile‚Äôs Cathedral Parish was established on July 20, 1703, by Jean-Baptiste de la Croix de Chevri√®res de Saint-Vallier, Bishop of Quebec. Bishop de Saint- Vallier named Father Roulleaux de La Vente, first pastor of the parish church, which was located at the French settlement of Mobile at the citadel of Fort Louis de la Louisiane.Higginbotham, Jay, Old Mobile: Fort Louis de la Louisiane, 1702-1711. (Museum of the City of Mobile, 1977) pp. 106-107. . The parish is the first established on the Gulf Coast. When the Mobile settlement was relocated to its present site in 1711, a new parish church was built and was known as Notre Dame de la Mobile (Our Lady of Mobile).Hamilton, Peter J., Colonial Mobile: A Study of Southwestern History, (1897, First National Bank of Mobile, reprint 1952) p. 148. In 1781, during the Spanish occupation of Mobile, the parish took its current name, Immaculate Conception.Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception Retrieved June 2007. Mobile was elevated to a diocese in 1829, and Frenchman, Michael Portier, was named its first bishop. Bishop Portier‚Äôs first ‚Äúcathedral‚Äù was a small wooden structure located in the Old Spanish Burying Ground, site of the present cathedral. Portier soon set out to construct a \\"real\\" cathedral. Construction The cathedral, designed in 1833, by Claude Beroujon, a former seminarian turned architect, is laid out in a Roman basilica design. Construction began in 1835, but the Panic of 1837, caused a shortage of funds and delayed progress. The cathedral was consecrated for public worship in 1850, by Bishop Portier, though Beroujon‚Äôs design was not yet fully realized. The portico and towers were to come later. The classical portico, with eight massive columns of the Roman Doric order, was added in the 1870s, under the direction of Bishop John Quinlan. The two towers were completed in 1884, during the watch of Bishop Jeremiah O'Sullivan. Location and dimensions Located on South Claiborne Street in downtown, it is bounded by Dauphin Street on the north, Franklin Street on the west, and Conti Street on the south. The front of the church faces east, toward the Mobile River, and overlooks Cathedral Square. The building, laid out in an east-west axis, is long and wide. The ceiling is at its highest point, and its twin towers rise to . Stained glass windows Window depicting the Immaculate Conception One of the cathedral‚Äôs finest attributes is its stained glass windows. The windows were made in Munich, Germany by Franz Mayer & Co., and installed beginning in 1890. The last window was installed in 1910, during the time of Bishop Edward Patrick Allen. The twelve main windows, six on the south wall and six on the north wall, are approximately wide and tall. Each window depicts an event involving Mary in the life of her son, Jesus. The subjects of the south wall windows are Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception, the Presentation of Mary at the Temple, the Annunciation, the Visitation, the Nativity of Jesus, and the Holy Family. The themes of the north wall are the Finding of the Child Jesus at the Temple, the Marriage Feast of Cana, the Crucifixion of Jesus, Pentecost, the Assumption of Mary into Heaven, and the Coronation of Mary, Queen of Heaven. Two large windows flank the portico, one under each of the two towers. The Baptism of Jesus in the River Jordan, by John the Baptist is the subject of the window in the Reconciliation Room, under the north tower. The window under the south tower, in the stairway to the choir loft, appropriately depicts St. Cecilia, patron saint of musicians. Smaller windows are found in each of the eight doors in the foyer, behind the cathedral‚Äôs main doors, at the church‚Äôs front entrance. These depict, from left to right, St. Augustine of Hippo, Our Lady of Mount Carmel, the Presentation of Mary at the Temple, St. Louis IX, King of France, St. Patrick, Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception, St. Agnes of Rome, Virgin & Martyr , and the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus. Above the four middle doors is the Holy Spirit window.Buck, Sharon V., \\"The Stained Glass Windows of Mobile's Cathedral Basilica of the Immaculate Conception\\", The Stained Glass Quarterly, (Stained Glass Association of America, Fall 1997). The interior in 2009 Fire and other damage Over the course of time, the cathedral experienced its share of disasters, including an explosion, a fire, an airplane hit, and hurricanes. On May 25, 1865, a Union Army ammunition depot exploded, killing some 300 persons, and burning much of Mobile. The windows and sashes on the north side of the cathedral were blown in by the explosion. Fortunately, there were no services being held in the cathedral at the time. During World War II, a pilot-in-training, flying low, clipped one of the towers, resulting in damage. Disaster struck on March 19, 1954, when a homeless man, seeking shelter in the church, caused a fire that destroyed the sanctuary. The church still stood, but the interior suffered damage from fire, smoke, and water from the firefighters‚Äô attempt to control the blaze. Repair, renovation and restoration The south tower in 2009 After the 1954 fire, Bishop Thomas Joseph Toolen had the damaged stained glass windows sent to the Franz Meyer workshops in Munich for repair. Here the craftsmen used the original drawings as a guide in their restoration efforts. He replaced the fire-damaged cathedra and pulpit with new ones made of mahogany. A replacement organ, built by the Wicks Organ Company, was installed and is in use today. At this time, Toolen added a massive bronze baldachin above the altar, supported by four marble columns. In the 1970s, Bishop John L. May made modifications to the sanctuary in compliance with the 1970 General Instruction of the Roman Missal. The altar was moved forward and the altar rails were removed. The cathedra was moved to its present location on the south end of the sanctuary facing the congregation. At this time, Bishop May also added a bronze representation of the Risen Christ above the baldachin and a large crucifix over the tabernacle. Archbishop Oscar Hugh Lipscomb led the most recent restoration effort in the 2000s. Under his direction, the cast iron fence was restored and repaired, and the cathedral exterior was cleaned and repaired. An interior overhaul, executed by Conrad Schmitt Studios, included a coffer ceiling above the main aisle. The coffers are decorated with alternating gold-leafed fleur-de-lis and shamrock, symbolically representing the Trinity, as well as the contributions of the French and Irish religious to the life of the Archdiocese. New lighting and a new color scheme brightens the interior. White marble flooring was installed in the aisles and the heart pine floors under the pews were refinished. Embedded in the marble floor of the main aisle are the coats-of- arms of the Mobile bishops and archbishops. A mural of the Tree of Jesse was installed above the pipe organ.  Basilica designation  In 1962, Pope John XXIII elevated the cathedral to a minor basilica, a title bestowed, only by the pope, on churches of historical and spiritual importance. A basilica is entitled to have its own coat-of-arms. Other basilica insignia include Pope John XXIII's personal coat-of-arms installed above the cathedral entrance, the yellow and red umbracullum (umbrella) and tintinnabulum (bell) in the sanctuary.

Indoor household gas heaters can be broadly categorized in one of two ways: flued or non-flued, or vented and unvented.  History  The first gas heater made use of the same principles of the Bunsen burner invented in the previous year. It was first commercialized by the English company Pettit and Smith in 1856. The flame heats the air locally. This heated air then spreads by convection, thus heating the whole room. Today the same principle applies with outdoor patio heaters or \\"mushroom heaters\\" which act as giant Bunsen burners. Beginning in 1881 the burner's flame was used to heat a structure made of asbestos, a design patented by Sigismund Leoni, a British engineer. Later, fire clay replaced the asbestos because it is easier to mould. Modern gas heaters still work this way although using other refractory material. Modern gas heaters have been further developed to include units which utilize radiant heat technology, rather than the principles of the Bunsen burner. This form of technology does not spread via convection, but rather, is absorbed by people and objects in its path. This form of heating is particularly useful for outdoor heating, where it is more economical than heating air that is free to move away. Flued heaters Flued heaters would always be permanently installed. The flue, if properly installed with correct overall height, should extract most heater emissions. A correctly operating flued gas heater is usually safe. Non-flued heaters Another example of a non-flued gas heater, running on natural gas. Non-flued heaters ‚Äì also known as unvented heaters, ventfree heaters or flueless fires may be either permanently installed or portable, and sometimes incorporate a catalytic converter.Flueless gas fires Non-flued heaters can be risky if appropriate safety procedures are not followed. There must be adequate ventilation, they must be kept clean, and they should always be switched off before sleeping. If operating correctly the main emissions of a non-flued gas heater are water vapour and carbon dioxide and nitrogen dioxide. =Operation= Home gas heating controls cycle using a mechanical or electronic thermostat. Gas flow is actuated with a valve. Ignition is by electric filament or pilot light. Flames heat a radiator in the air duct but outside the flue, convection or a fan may distribute the heat.

Cartridges of the World. DBI Books, 1976, p.146 patented in 1910 and introduced in 1914 by Franz Pfannl, an Austrian watchmaker, with financial support from Georg Grabner. It was designed to accompany the Kolibri semi-auto pistol or single shot pistol, both marketed as self-defense weapons. The name is derived from Kolibri, the German word for hummingbird, which is among the smallest of birds. Background The cartridge weighs 5.3 grams (82 grains), measures 3 millimeters (0.12 in) at its widest point, and 11 mm (0.43 in) from the base of the primer to the tip of the bullet. The cartridge is headspaced on the mouth of the case. The bullet itself masses 0.2g (3 grains), and is estimated to have a normal muzzle velocity of , resulting in a muzzle energy of 4.0J (3 ft-lbs).*Wilson, R. K. Textbook of Automatic Pistols, p.262. Plantersville, SC: Small Arms Technical Publishing Company, 1943. For perspective, an average person's punch measures 10-15 joules, meaning that the round has less energy than a punch. The round was not well accepted. The 2mm Kolibri's small size makes handling and loading individual cartridges difficult, and the bullet itself is fairly weak, with literature at the time suggesting the round was capable of penetrating only of pine board. The round also suffers some accuracy issues, since the technology of the time was incapable of applying rifling to the bore of such a small caliber, resulting in no spin on the bullet. Due to the weakness and inaccuracy of the firearm, the 2mm Kolibri was advertised as a ladies self-defense weapon that was small enough to fit inside a handbag. While probably not effective against a mugger if shot at the chest or limbs, it could potentially inflict some damage if shot at the attackers face. The series, and most weapons by Franz Pfannl, were discontinued in 1938. As with the related firearm series, this gun is now a collector's item with about 1000 ever produced. It is notable for being the smallest centerfire cartridge ever produced.

It is often credited with helping re-define the performance of wind band music. At the time, concert bands used all their players for every piece, regardless of whether the composer had written a part for that instrument. If there was no part for an instrument you had in the band - for example, a contrabass clarinet or a string bass - the conductor or the publisher would have an arranger add one. Or you would simply have that instrument double another instrument - the string bass could play the tuba part, for instance. Also, bigger was better, and even though there would normally be three clarinet parts, many university concert bands would have 20 or 30 clarinets, or more. Fennell turned these practices around. The Eastman Wind Ensemble would have one player on each part, and used only the instrumentation for each piece specified by the composer. Fennell coined the term wind ensemble to refer to this specific kind of wind band. The repertoire of the group included standard concert band pieces, but also chamber music for winds, and the instrumentation varied as required. In contrast to typical concert band practice, the Eastman Wind Ensemble kept its focus on original wind music rather than orchestral transcriptions. The Eastman Wind Ensemble has premiered over 150 works, including works by composers Bernard Rands and Joseph Schwantner. A series of commercial recordings on the Mercury label spread the influence of Fennell's wind ensemble concept far beyond the geographic reach of the group's concerts, and helped form a new generation of wind band educators and musicians far beyond Rochester. Many of these recordings are still commercially available (now on CD and download) almost seven decades after they were recorded. In 1987, the Eastman Wind Ensemble was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Classical Performance - Instrumental Soloist or Soloists (with or without orchestra) for its 1986 album Carnaval, a collaboration with trumpeter Wynton Marsalis.

This is the only first-person account of a \\"freedom suit\\" and one of the few slave narratives published in the post-Emancipation period. The memoir recounts her mother Polly Berry's legal battles in St. Louis, Missouri, for her own and her daughter's freedom from slavery. For her daughter's case, Berry attracted the support of Edward Bates, a prominent Whig politician and judge, and the future US Attorney General under President Abraham Lincoln. He argued the case of Lucy Ann Berry in court and won in February 1844. Their cases were two of 301 freedom suits filed in St. Louis from 1814 to 1860. Discovered in the late twentieth century, the case files are held by the Missouri Historical Society and are searchable online. Early life For decades little was known of Lucy Ann Delaney beyond her memoir. In the 1990s her mother's and her freedom suits were among the brief case files found for 301 freedom suits in St. Louis, dating from 1814‚Äì1860. Related material is available online in a searchable database created by the St. Louis Circuit Court Historical Project, in collaboration with Washington University.\\"History of Freedom Suits in Missouri\\" , St. Louis Circuit Court Historical Records Project, September 1, 2004, accessed January 4, 2011. In addition, scholars have conducted research into censuses and other historic material related to Delaney's memoir to document the facts. Born into slavery in St. Louis, Missouri in 1830, Lucy Ann Berry was the second daughter of slaves Polly Berry (born Polly Crocket) and a mulatto father whose name she did not note. Their first daughter was named Nancy. Polly Crocket and Lucy's father (and the girls) were held by Major Taylor Berry and his wife, Frances. Lucy said that Polly Berry had been born free in Illinois (a free state), but was kidnapped as a child by slave catchers and sold into slavery in Missouri.Lucy A. Delaney, From the Darkness Cometh the Light: or Struggles for Freedom, Electronic edition, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 2001; accessed April 22, 2009. (In her freedom suit, Polly Berry deposed that she was held as a slave in Wayne County, Kentucky by Joseph Crockett, and was brought by him to Illinois. There they stayed for several weeks while he hired her out for domestic work. As Illinois was a free state, he was supposed to lose his right to hold slave property by staying there, and Polly could have been freed. It was on this basis that she was later awarded freedom, as witnesses were found to testify as to her having been held illegally as a slave in Illinois. When Delaney wrote her memoir late in life, she remembered the Major and his wife Fanny Berry as kind slaveholders. The major told Polly and her husband that they and his other slaves would be freed upon his death and the death of his wife. After the major died in a duel, the widow Fanny Berry married Robert Wash, a lawyer later appointed as a Missouri State Supreme Court judge. When Fanny Wash died, the Berry slave family's fortunes changed. Judge Wash sold Lucy Ann's father to a plantation down the Mississippi River in the Deep South. Polly Berry became concerned for the safety of her daughters, and determined they should escape. Lucy Ann's older sister Nancy slipped away while traveling with a daughter of the family, Mary Berry Cox, and her new husband on their honeymoon in the North. Nancy left them at Niagara Falls, took the ferry across the river, and safely reached Canada and a friend of her mother's. After having conflict with Mary Cox in 1839, Polly Berry was sold to Joseph A. Magehan, but escaped about three weeks later. She reached Chicago, but was captured by slave catchers. They returned her to Magehan and slavery in St. Louis. On returning, Polly Berry (also known as Polly Wash after her previous master) sued for her freedom in the Circuit Court in the case known as Polly Wash v. Joseph A. Magehan in October 1839. When her suit was finally heard in 1843, her attorney Harris Sproat convinced a jury of her free birth and kidnapping as a child. Wash was freed. She remained in St. Louis to continue her separate effort to secure her daughter Lucy Ann Berry's freedom, for which she had filed suit in 1842, shortly after Berry fled her master. Trial and freedom By 1842, Lucy Ann was working for Martha Berry Mitchell, another of the married Berry daughters. They came into conflict in part because of the slave girl's inexperience at heavy domestic tasks, including laundry. Martha decided to sell her, and her husband David D. Mitchell arranged the sale. The day before she was to leave, Lucy Ann escaped and hid at the house of a friend of her mother's. That week, Polly Wash filed suit in Circuit Court in St. Louis for Lucy Ann Berry's freedom, as a \\"next friend\\" to the minor girl. Since her own case had not been settled, Wash was still considered a slave with no legal standing, but under the slave law, she could bring suit on behalf of a minor as \\"next friend\\". The law provided a slave with the status of a \\"poor person\\", with court-appointed counsel when the court determined the case had grounds. Delaney's memoir suggests that her mother's attorneys suggested her strategy of filing separate suits for her and her daughter, to prevent a jury's worrying about taking too much property from one slaveholder.Wong, p. 135. The case was prepared primarily by Francis Butter Murdoch, who litigated nearly one third of the freedom suits filed in St. Louis from 1840‚Äì1847.Eric Gardner, \\" 'You have no business to whip me': the freedom suits of Polly Wash and Lucy Ann Delaney\\", African American Review, Spring 2007, accessed January 4, 2011. Francis B. Murdoch had served as the Alton, Illinois district attorney, and prosecuted the murder of the printer Elijah Lovejoy by anti- abolitionists.Wong, p. 132. Wash also attracted the support of Edward Bates; a prominent Whig politician and judge, he argued Lucy Ann's case in court. Bates later served as the US Attorney General under President Abraham Lincoln. While waiting for trial, Lucy Ann Berry was remanded to the jail, where she was held for more than 17 months without being hired out. It was customary to lease out slaves to offset expenses and earn money for such slaves' masters. In February 1844 the case went to trial. By then her mother's case had been settled, and Polly Wash was declared free, based on her free birth in Illinois. In addition, Wash had affidavits from people who knew her and her daughter. Judge Robert Wash (Fanny Berry Wash's widower and Polly's previous master) testified that Lucy Ann was definitely Polly Berry Wash's child. The jury believed the case for freedom had been proved, as the girl had been born to a legally free mother. The judge announced Lucy Ann Berry was free. She was approximately 14 years old. Lucy Ann and Polly Berry lived in St. Louis after gaining her freedom. They had to get certificates as free blacks and deal with other restrictions of the time against free people of color. They worked together as seamstresses. Marriage and family In 1845, Lucy Ann met and married steamboat worker Frederick Turner, with whom she settled in Quincy, Illinois. Her mother lived with them. Turner died soon after in a boiler explosion on the steamboat The Edward Bates. (It was named for the lawyer who had helped secure Lucy Ann's freedom two years before.) Polly Wash and Lucy Ann returned to St. Louis. In 1849, Lucy Ann met and married Zachariah Delaney. They were married for the rest of their lives, and her mother lived with them. Though the couple had four children, two did not survive infancy. The remaining son and daughter both died in their early twenties. Later life As Delaney recounted in her memoir, she became active in civic and religious associations. Such organizations developed rapidly in both the African- American and white communities nationally in the years following the Civil War. She joined the African Methodist Episcopal Church in 1855, founded in 1816 in Philadelphia as the first independent black denomination in the US. In addition, Delaney was elected president of the Female Union, an organization of African-American women. She also served as president of the Daughters of Zion, as well as a women's group affiliated with the Freemasons, to which her husband belonged. They often supported community education and health projects. Delaney belonged to the Col. Shaw Woman's Relief Corps, No. 34, a women's auxiliary to the Col. Shaw Post, 343, Grand Army of the Republic (GAR). The veterans' group was named after the white commanding officer of the 54th Massachusetts Infantry, the first of the United States Colored Troops and a unit that achieved renown for courage in the Civil War. Delaney dedicated her memoir to the GAR, which had fought for the freedom of slaves. In the late nineteenth century, many blacks migrated to St. Louis from the Deep South for its industrial jobs. Delaney met with new arrivals to try to track down her father. Learning that he was living on a plantation 15 miles south of Vicksburg, Mississippi, she wrote and asked him to visit her. Her sister Nancy from Canada joined their reunion in St. Louis. Their father was glad to see them, but, as his wife Polly had died by then, he returned to Mississippi and his friends of 45 years. Nothing was recorded about the year or circumstances of Lucy Delaney's death. Memoir In 1891, Delaney published her From the Darkness Cometh the Light, or, Struggles for Freedom, the only first-person account of a freedom suit. The text is also classified as a slave narrative, most of which were published prior to the Civil War and Emancipation. Delaney devoted most of her account to her mother Polly Berry's struggles to free her family from slavery. Though the story is Delaney's, she features her mother as the lead protagonist. The narrative is steeped in spirituality, as was typical of the genre and people's lives. Delaney delebrated what she considered God's benevolent role in her own life, and she attacked the hypocrisy of Christian slave owners. From the Darkness emphasizes the strength of the African Americans who suffered under slavery, rather than recount its abuses. By continuing her memoir after she gained freedom at age 14, Delaney could demonstrate her fortitude as a young widow, and after the deaths of each of her four children. She portrayed her mother Polly Berry as serving as an adviser and role model. By celebrating her political and civic activities, Delaney stated the way African Americans fully participated in US democracy. Publication history From the Darkness was originally published in St. Louis in 1891 by J.T. Smith. After the rise of the mid-20th-century Civil Rights Movement and feminism, and new interest in historic black and women's literature, in 1988 the book was reprinted in the collection Six Women's Slave Narratives by Oxford University Press. It is available in full for free online by Project Gutenberg, as well as by the University of North Carolina in its Documents of the American South website . Literary critic P. Gabrielle Foreman suggested that author Frances Harper based her character of \\"Lucille Delaney\\", in the novel Iola Leroy (1892), on Delaney's memoir published the year before.

Upon completion of high school, he decided to attend California Institute of the Arts, a Disney-funded college specializing in animation. Career He gained an internship on an animated feature, The Pagemaster, and moved on as an assistant animator on the film Cats Don't Dance. While there, he sold a pilot to Fred Seibert (then president of MTV Networks and Hanna-Barbera), for the What a Cartoon! series titled Godfrey and Zeek. This transitioned into doing story work for Hanna-Barbera's other series, Johnny Bravo. Moncrief went on to open his own company, creating animation on several CD-ROMs, as well as a commercial work featuring Warner Bros.' Road Runner, the Carl's Jr. spot featuring Dennis Rodman, as well as animation for a GM-sponsored ride at Walt Disney World. Soon after, Seibert came calling again with a new series on Nickelodeon called Oh Yeah! Cartoons. There, Moncrief created the shorts Kitty the Hapless Cat, Baxter and Bananas, and also worked on other shorts such as The Fairly OddParents and the Emmy winning short Max and His Special Problem. He spent his remaining time at Nickelodeon storyboarding in season one of the game-changing series, Dora the Explorer. Shortly thereafter, he was asked to teach at his alma mater (CalArts) and by Walt Disney Television Animation to storyboard on Teacher's Pet, the series (and its theatrical release), as well as direct-to-videos for Lilo & Stitch, Kim Possible, and the network's newest show, Brandy and Mr. Whiskers. Next, it was off to help bring back a series that has continued to be one of the strongest animated sitcoms in television history, Family Guy. The show's DVD sales had done so incredibly well that 20th Century Fox Television decided to bring the series back for season 4. Moncrief started as an Assistant Director and quickly moved into a Director role working on some of Seth MacFarlane's favorite episodes, such as \\"The Griffin Family History\\" and \\"Barely Legal\\". He then followed fellow Family Guy director Dan Povenmire back to Disney again to help direct over 50+ episodes of the hit Disney television series Phineas and Ferb. His job titles allowed him to be involved in every aspect from breaking stories to writing, from storyboarding to design and color, from editing to calling retakes. He was even involved in writing a few of the songs created for this groundbreaking show. After his long run at Disney, he spent three years working at Bento Box as the Supervising Director on Comedy Central's hit show Brickleberry, while also helping to develop shows at Nickelodeon. In December 2013, he joined Warner Bros. Animation to produce and revamp the twelfth series in the Scooby-Doo franchise, titled Be Cool, Scooby-Doo!, which debuted in the fall of 2015. After producing close to 52 episodes and almost 2 seasons for Warner Bros., he joined the Nickelodeon family as a Supervising Producer in the fall of 2017 to help oversee and launch a cartoon series based on the hit Dan Schneider television show Henry Danger. This new animated series, titled The Adventures of Kid Danger, debuted on January 15, 2018 as a sneak peek, before its official premiere on January 19. Its ratings were constantly in the top 25, performing better than expected. On its final premiere episodes during the week of June 11‚Äì17, 2018, it was the #1 program for K6‚Äì11 (it received at 2.91 for boys aged 2‚Äì5 and a 3.15 for boys aged 6‚Äì11). The show is currently not slated for more episodes. His latest adventure has been the lead on the television adaption of the popular Lego augmented reality game app Hidden Side, with the title of supervising director. While working with Pure Imagination Studios, Moncrief created 19 different shorts for Lego, and launched off a 44 minute movie as a way to introduce its newest IP. This IP was ground breaking due to the incredible AR game that could be downloaded and used with the toys once they were built. The game would bring the toys to life when viewed for this interactive game. The television adaption is set to premiere sometime in 2020. = Phineas and Ferb = In 2007, Moncrief returned to Disney to work as a director and writer for Phineas and Ferb. As of December 2012, he had directed over 50 episodes in the series and been credited on over 90+ different credits. = Family Guy = In 2005, Moncrief left Disney to become a director on the Fox television series Family Guy for Fox Animation Studios. He directed six episodes over a two-year span. Those six episodes were: * \\"Peter's Got Woods\\", first aired on September 11, 2005 * \\"Brian Sings and Swings\\", first aired on January 8, 2006 * \\"Untitled Griffin Family History\\", first aired on May 14, 2006 * \\"Barely Legal\\", first aired on December 17, 2006 * \\"It Takes a Village Idiot, and I Married One\\", first aired on May 13, 2007 * \\"Peter's Daughter\\", first aired on November 25, 2007 * \\"Blind Ambition\\", first aired on May 15, 2005 (assistant director) During this period, he also returned to CalArts as a teacher.

Example: If two separate entities can be said to be \\"water\\", then combining them into one entity will yield more \\"water\\". If two separate entities can be said to be \\"a house\\", their combination cannot be said to be \\"a house\\". Hence, \\"water\\" has cumulative reference, while the expression \\"a house\\" does not. The plural form \\"houses\\", however, does have cumulative reference. If two (groups of) entities are both \\"houses\\", then their combination will still be \\"houses\\". Cumulativity has proven relevant to the linguistic treatment of the mass/count distinction and for the characterization of grammatical telicity. Formally, a cumulativity predicate CUM can be defined as follows, where capital X is a variable over sets, U is the universe of discourse, p is a mereological part structure on U, and \\\\oplus_p is the mereological sum operation. (\\\\forall X\\\\subseteq U_p)(CUM(X)\\\\iff \\\\exists x,y(X(x) \\\\wedge X(y) \\\\wedge x eq y) \\\\wedge \\\\forall x,y(X(x) \\\\wedge X(y) \\\\Rightarrow X(x \\\\oplus_p y))) In later work, Krifka has generalized the notion to n-ary predicates, based on the phenomenon of cumulative quantification. For example, the two following sentences appear to be equivalent: : John ate an apple and Mary ate a pear. : John and Mary ate an apple and a pear. This shows that the relation \\"eat\\" is cumulative. In general, an n-ary predicate R is cumulative if and only if the following holds: (\\\\forall x_1,\\\\ldots, x_n, y_1,\\\\ldots, y_n)(R(x_1, \\\\ldots,x_n)\\\\wedge R(y_1, \\\\ldots,y_n)) \\\\rightarrow R(x_1\\\\oplus y_1, \\\\ldots,x_n\\\\oplus y_n) References Krifka, Manfred (1989). \\"Nominal reference, temporal constitution and quantification in event semantics\\".

He was one of the eight regents appointed by the Xianfeng Emperor to assist his successor, the Tongzhi Emperor. Life Zaiyuan was born in the Aisin Gioro clan as a descendant of Yinxiang (1686‚Äì1730), the 13th son of the Kangxi Emperor. He inherited his ancestors' peerage, \\"Prince Yi of the First Rank\\", in 1852 during the reign of the Daoguang Emperor (r. 1820‚Äì50). Zaiyuan took up important positions during the reign of the Xianfeng Emperor (r. 1850‚Äì61), including a minister in the Imperial Clan Court and an imperial guard commander. In 1860, during the Second Opium War, Zaiyuan and Muyin (Á©ÜËî≠) travelled to Tongzhou to replace Guiliang (Ê°ÇËâØ) in the peace negotiations with the British and French. When the negotiations failed, the Mongol general Sengge Rinchen captured the British diplomats Harry Smith Parkes and Henry Loch, Thomas William Bowlby (a journalist for The Times), and their escorts. The majority of the group ‚Äì except the two diplomats ‚Äì died from torture or disease; the survivors were released later. The Anglo-French expeditionary force closed in on Beijing. On 18 October, in retaliation for the capture and deaths of the peace delegation, the British and French destroyed the Old Summer Palace (Yuanmingyuan). Zaiyuan had already fled with the Xianfeng Emperor to the Chengde Mountain Resort in Hebei. Prince Gong, who was ordered to remain behind to make peace with the invaders, successfully concluded the Convention of Beijing with the British, French and Russians. Before the Xianfeng Emperor died in 1861, he appointed Zaiyuan, Sushun, Duanhua and five others as regents to assist his son, who succeeded him as the Tongzhi Emperor (r. 1861‚Äì75). Later that year, Prince Gong, with support from the Empress Dowagers Ci'an and Cixi, launched the Xinyou Coup and seized power from the eight regents. Zaiyuan was arrested, imprisoned, and given a piece of white silk cloth to commit suicide by hanging himself with the cloth. After Zaiyuan's death, the Prince Yi peerage was inherited by Zaidun (ËºâÊï¶), one of his distant relatives.

He is well known for building immense temples out of recycled wood sheets (discarded from making toys and other punch-outs) for the Burning Man festivals, where they are then burnt to the ground in a spectacle of light and heat. Career Best received a master's degree in sculpture from the San Francisco Art Institute, where he first took classes at the age of six. His commitment to public art seems rooted in 1960s-era idealism. His works ‚Äî ceramic sculpture, collages and more ‚Äî have been shown at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Oakland Museum, the Crocker Art Museum in Sacramento, the San Jose Museum of Art, di Rosa and elsewhere. Best first began collaborating with others, 20 years ago, when he embarked upon a sideline: stripping down vehicles and giving them total sculptural makeovers, using recycled materials and found objects, often retrieved from dumps and dumpsters. Since then, he has created sculptures from the skeletons of 36 cars and two buses, and worked with more than 10,000 people. Best built his first Burning Man Temple in 2000, The Temple of the Mind. During construction it became a memorial to Michael Hefflin, a member of the crew who died in a motorcycle accident just prior to the event, and as such became a sacred space for remembering others. In 2001, Burning Man helped fund the Temple projects and David, along with Jack Haye who was also responsible for the construction of the Temple of the Mind, built the much larger Temple of Tears. 2001 marked the beginning of a new and profound ritual for the tens of thousands of participants who attend Burning Man each year. After days of writing prayers on the structures, of affixing offerings from one's life such as pictures, paintings, etc., or of leaving the ashes of loved ones, etc. the Temple was burned on Sunday night. In 2002, Best returned with a new project: the Temple of Joy. In 2003, David departed from the wood temples and created the ornate paper Temple of Honor. In 2004, the Temple of Stars was a quarter mile long and almost 120‚Äô high. David took a break in 2005 and 2006 to work on personal projects, including the Hayes Green Temple in San Francisco. Returning in 2007, David, Tim Dawson and the temple crew built the Temple of Forgiveness. Best originally suggested he might create one more temple in 2010 or 2011, however the 2010 Temple of Flux and the 2011 Temple of Transition were designed and built by other artists. Best returned in 2012 to design and coordinate the building of the Temple of Juno. In 2014, Best and crew constructed the Temple of Grace. In January and February 2019 Best traveled to Coral Springs and Parkland, Florida to build ‚ÄúThe Temple of Time‚Äù in remembrance of the 17 lives lost at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on February 14th, 2018 from a School Shooting. The temple was unveiled on February 14th, 2019 and will remain in place until it is burned in May.

Designed in 1936, the Colonel served as the teams' official sideline mascot from 1979 until 2003. The university replaced him in 2010 with a new on-field mascot, the Black Bear. Origin James \\"Blind Jim\\" Ivy (1872-1955), possible inspiration for Colonel Reb Several theories exist as to who originally designed Colonel Reb, a cartoonish, older-aged white male in Confederate garb who many said represented a plantation owner and perpetuated racist symbolism of the Old South.https://mississippitoday.org/2020/05/21/theres-a-story-behind- this-44-year-old-photo-of-colonel-reb-and-miss-ole-miss/ One theory proposes that Billy Hix, the art editor for the 1936-1937 Ole Miss yearbook in which the Colonel first appeared, created the image as an illustration for the university's new athletics sobriquet. Another theory postulates that the student group responsible for publishing The Rebel humor magazine designed the Colonel, as this group‚Äìknown as the \\"Rebel Club\\"‚Äìwas founded in 1937 shortly after the University adopted the \\"Rebels\\" nickname and featured on the magazine's masthead an illustration of the Colonel was identical to the one found in the 1937 annual.\\"The Rebel: The Magazine of Ole Miss,\\" Initial Issue, September 1939 Still others maintain that the printing company that published the Ole Miss annual was responsible for the design. University of Mississippi historian David Sansing has noted that \\"Blind Jim [Ivy] may have been the model for Colonel Rebel,\\" citing the late Frank Everett, Jr., a Mississippi historian and prominent alumnus (B.A. '32, LLB '34) of the university. Ivy, blinded as a teenager while working with tar on the Tallahatchie Bridge, originally made his way to Oxford in 1896 and became a peanut vendor. During a baseball game between Ole Miss and the University of Texas, a student told Ivy that Mississippi was losing badly. At that point, ‚ÄúIvy began cheering the home team on in his famous loud booming voice. The team was strangely inspired by Mr. Ivy‚Äôs enthusiastic cheering, and won the game decisively.‚Äù From that point on, ‚ÄúBlind Jim‚Äù became a campus fixture at the University for the next sixty years and was regarded as one of the most passionate fans of its sports teams, known to proudly tell others that he had \\"never seen Ole Miss lose.\\" Concrete evidence has not been found, however, to support the conclusion that Mr. Ivy was the inspiration for Colonel Reb's design. Additionally, if Mr. Ivy, an African-American, was the basis for Colonel Reb's design, the University of Mississippi has not provided an explanation for why they chose to represent Colonel Reb as Caucasian and not African-American, like Mr. Ivy. Ivy was very much a part of the university scene when the editor of the school newspaper, The Mississippian, proposed a contest in April 1936 to produce a new nickname for the Ole Miss athletic teams. Prior to this, the teams had been called by various names‚Äìthe Red and Blue, the Oxfords, the Mighty Mississippians, the Southerners, the Crimson and Blue‚Äìand most recently and most popularly up until 1936, the Flood. The Mississippian received many entries and subsequently placed several names‚Äìincluding Rebels, Raiders, Confederates, Stonewalls, and Ole Miss (without a nickname appendage)‚Äìin the hands of 21 sportswriters. Ultimately, \\"Rebels\\" was the choice of 18 out of the 21 sportswriters, a nickname alluding to the University Greys. After five months of contest and polling, the university's athletics committee formally approved the name, and its sports teams have been known as the Rebels ever since. A copy of the 1947 \\"Ole Miss\\" yearbook. The look of the Colonel has been modified several times since those early years, however. The 1941-1942 Ole Miss features a depiction of Colonel Reb that looks much more like the well- known image that is used to this day. The earliest and most widely recognized version of the ‚Äúmodern‚Äù Colonel, however, appeared on the 1946-1947 Ole Miss, adorning the cover in full color and in much more detail. Ole Miss campus bookstore owner Carl Coers and famous New Orleans cartoonist John Churchill Chase may have also had a hand in revising and modifying the Colonel image during those early years.The Mississippian: That Famous Little Old Man, Colonel Rebel, Was Born 17 Years Ago in a State-Wide Contest, October 9, 1953. The California company Angelus Pacific also claims that it designed the Colonel; during this era, ex-Disney artist Art C. Evans illustrated dozens of collegiate mascots that became hugely popular across America and are still widely recognizable today. Colonel Reb on Campus = Honorary Title = In 1940, Ole Miss students began voting for \\"Colonel Rebel\\" as the highest honorary position for male students on campus (not to be confused with the mascot). This title had previously been called \\"The King of Mardi Gras,\\" but this name was changed by the Associated Student Body executive council in the fall of 1939.The Mississippian: \\"Schneller and Dunagin Run For 'Colonel Rebel' Tuesday\\" December 9, 1939. This distinction was made in addition to the female equivalent (\\"Miss Ole Miss\\"), which had been bestowed upon female students on campus for over a decade. Several distinguished Ole Miss alumni have been elected to one of these two positions, including former University of Mississippi Chancellor Robert Khayat. In 1975, former National Football League standout Ben Williams became the first black student to be elected \\"Colonel Reb.\\" \\"Gentle Ben\\", as he is affectionately known by many in the Ole Miss community, was also the first black football player at Ole Miss. In 1989, star Ole Miss women's basketball player Kimsey O'Neal became the first black student to gain the title \\"Miss Ole Miss.\\" One year later, in 1990, Roy Lee \\"Chucky\\" Mullins, the Rebel athlete who suffered a devastating football injury in 1989 that left him a quadriplegic, was elected \\"Colonel Reb\\" by the student body. In 2013, the Associated Student Body at the University officially changed the name of this honorary title from \\"Colonel Reb\\" to \\"Mr. Ole Miss.\\" =Mascot= As was the trend among many American colleges and universities during the 1970s, the university adopted a costumed mascot, based on its popular \\"Colonel Rebel\\" design. Thus, in 1979, Colonel Reb advanced from his 40-year history on paper to a living caricature on the field. The role was filled by a male cheerleader, and the character was first called \\"Johnny Reb.\\" Throughout the early 1980s, the Ole Miss cheerleading team gained widespread recognition as one of the \\"top squads\\" in the nation: the Colonel was named \\"Best Mascot in the S.E.C.\\" in his first year, and he also helped lead the Rebels to third- and first-place distinctions by the National Cheerleading Association (\\"NCA\\") and the Universal Cheerleading Association (\\"UCA\\"), respectively, among 99 competing universities. The Colonel was also on hand to welcome former President Gerald Ford when he visited the University of Mississippi in 1981. For a brief period during the early 1980s, the Colonel also joined members of the Rebel cheerleading squad in traveling to several NBA games to perform at halftime shows, in which the group would use mini- trampolines and perform flashy, acrobatic slam-dunks and other basketball stunts. (This group, which featured Colonel Reb in its earliest performances, was originally known as the \\"Dixie Daredevils,\\" but it eventually rebranded as the \\"Bud Light Daredevils\\" after obtaining a sponsorship from Budweiser.) Colonel Reb (Jeff Hubbard) performs with fellow Ole Miss cheerleaders Ty Cobb, Sam Martin, and John White The Colonel would continue to turn in strong performances throughout the 1980s: in 1986, he earned \\"SEC Mascot of the Year\\" honors and was named the Runner-Up for \\"National Mascot of the Year\\" (finishing only behind Cocky of the South Carolina Gamecocks). During that same year, he was also honored as the \\"National Mascot Fundraiser Champion\\" for his fundraising efforts for juvenile diabetes research and charitable appearances for United Way. Mascot search In 2003, the administration‚Äìconcerned about some in the public who perceived a connection between the character and the Old South‚Äìremoved Colonel Reb from the sidelines at Ole Miss athletic events as the official on-field mascot, though he was allowed at tailgates and other unofficial university functions. A contest was held in which fans were invited to design a replacement. The athletic department chose two finalists, Rebel Bruiser and Rowdy Rebel, and encouraged fans to vote on their favorite. The limited fan response, as well as ridicule from fans of rival schools, prompted the administration to cancel the poll. In 2010, the University announced it would establish a student committee to choose a new mascot for the school's teams. A website was then established by the committee in an effort to promote transparency throughout the process. After months of analyzing responses and feedback, including the final poll, the committee ultimately selected the Black Bear as the new on-field mascot and named it \\"Rebel\\". The Colonel Reb Foundation, a student group founded in support of reinstating Colonel Reb as the university's mascot, has sponsored the unofficial appearances of the mascot in The Grove on game day. The University has reclassified the Colonel Reb trademark as historical and still retains ownership of the trademark.

This strategy can be executed in a single planned pivotal battle, called a \\"battle of annihilation.\\" A successful battle of annihilation is accomplished through the use of tactical surprise, application of overwhelming force at a key point, or other tactics performed immediately before or during the battle. The end goal of a battle of annihilation is to cause the leaders of the opposing army to sue for peace due to the complete annihilation of its army and thus inability to further engage in offensive or defensive military action. It is not necessary to kill or capture all, or even most, of an opposing army's forces to annihilate it in the sense used here. Rather, the destruction of the enemy army as a cohesive military force able to offer further meaningful military offense or defense, even if temporarily, is the objective.  Significance of the term  In ancient and classical times, many battles ended with the annihilation of one of the opposing forces, the battles of Cannae, Zama and Adrianople being famous examples. From the Renaissance onward, however, the battle of annihilation strategy fell into disuse, at least in Europe. The greatest exception is seen in the battles of Napoleon Bonaparte, and it is with Napoleon that the battle of annihilation in the modern sense is most closely associated, so that term \\"Napoleonic battle of annihilation\\" is sometimes used, and the Battle of Austerlitz is often cited as the paragon of the modern battle of annihilation.  After Napoleon  Napoleon's victories at Austerlitz (1805) and Jena (1806) are often cited as the classic battles of annihilation. Napoleon himself was unable to again achieve such decisive results, partly because his enemies subsequently adjusted to his tactics. For example, Borodino, while a victory, did not result in the desired destruction of the Russian army. Nevertheless, strategists, influenced by those of the Napoleonic era, most notably Antoine-Henri Jomini, held the Napoleonic battle of annihilation to be the proper objective of modern military campaigns. This interpretation was later accredited to the more renowned Carl von Clausewitz, initially by Helmuth von Moltke the Elder who supported arguments for strategies of annihilation with quotes from Clausewitz. Clausewitz, who disliked Jomini personally, as well as his concepts, may have instead emphasized the primacy of the political in warfare, and remained indifferent to theories arguing for any absolute solutions via the application of military force. Nevertheless, this set the stage for mass confusion down the line of strategic thinkers.J. Nagl, (2005), p. 19. Clausewitz's trilogies (albeit used out of context) are contested by Liddell Hart, who claims in Strategy that a poor choice of words by Clausewitz led his interpreters to overestimate the value of annihilation battles.Hart, B. H. Liddell, (1991), p. 319. Consequently, at the beginning of the American Civil War, many top military commanders expected a battle of annihilation to quickly end the war. This did not occur. Already, the size and firepower of armies were making the battle of annihilation harder to achieve. A contrast may be seen between the Confederate general Robert E. Lee and the Union general Ulysses S. Grant. Lee, when on the offensive, usually maneuvered with the intent of forcing a battle of annihilation. His archetypal attempt was at the Battle of Chancellorsville, where a classic Napoleonic flanking maneuver defeated but was not able to destroy the Union Army under Joseph Hooker. Lee may be faulted for attempting to achieve a battle of annihilation, particularly at Gettysburg. In contrast, Grant was noted for waging campaigns of maneuver. In the Vicksburg campaign, he forced Pemberton's army into a siege position where it was forced to surrender without a battle. In the Virginia campaign of 1864 against Lee, he continually maneuvered around Lee, forcing him to withdraw further and further south until he had to choose between abandoning the Confederate capital of Richmond or withdrawing into siege lines. William Tecumseh Sherman may also be cited. Rather than pursuing the chimera of destroying Hood's army, he chose to operate directly against the Confederate economy. His famous march through Georgia, directly away from Hood, was basically the opposite of a Napoleonic strategy. During the Franco-Prussian War, the Prussians (and later Germans) made their own version of the battle of annihilation by destroying entire armies in a relatively short time by means of rapid troop movement and rapid encirclement of the enemy. This tactic came into fruition during the decisive battles of Metz and Sedan where two main French armies were completely annihilated at the same time and in a relatively short span of time, rendering France almost completely defenseless against the German invasion. This tactic later served as an inspiration for the blitzkrieg during World War II where highly mobile formations would execute a battle of annihilation by charging straight into the enemy's weak point and attempt to encircle and destroy separate enemy pockets; this tactic became spectacularly successful during the German invasions of Poland, France and the Soviet Union until they themselves became annihilated by the Soviets in battles such as Stalingrad, Belorussia and Berlin. The Napoleonic ideal was still alive at the beginning of World War I. In fact, the Germans were able to execute a battle of annihilation against the Russian 2nd Army at the Battle of Tannenberg in the war's opening weeks. But attempts to create such a result on the Western Front resulted in great slaughter to no effect. Armies were now too large to have flanks to turn, and had too much firepower and too much defensive depth to be broken by assault. During the Pacific War, the Imperial Japanese Navy's strategy was fixated on the goal of luring the numerically superior United States Pacific Fleet into a single decisive battle of annihilation, which would force the United States to sue for peace. This was at least partially the motivation behind the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor and the Battle of Midway, but was loosely followed for as long as the IJN was capable of offensive operations. This goal was never achieved for several reasons. First, the US Navy was wary of committing all of its forces to one major battle. Further, the IJN concentrated so much of its efforts on preparing for a single massive showdown (which never truly occurred) that it neglected devoting resources towards protecting its naval supply lines, which soon fell prey to a Fabian strategy when they were extensively targeted by US submarines. Even Japanese victories such as the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands failed to utterly annihilate their opponents. The hoped-for \\"decisive battle\\" against the US Navy never came, and the IJN was gradually ground down through attrition. Since World War I, the paradigm of armies maneuvering in the empty countryside for weeks and then meeting in a battle lasting (usually) a single day no longer applies (at least to wars between major powers). Instead, armies are deployed in more-or-less continuous lines stretching perhaps hundreds of miles. Thus, the battle of annihilation may be considered to be mainly of historical interest, except for secondary campaigns.  Alternatives to the battle of annihilation  Initially, it might seem that annihilation of the opposing army is the obvious object of any military campaign. However, many battles have been fought to cause an enemy army simply to retreat, or to suffer attrition, and many campaigns have been waged to avoid, rather than seek, such a battle. Reasons for not seeking a battle of annihilation include the following: :* Avoidance of the risk and cost associated with such a battle :* Lack of means to attempt such a battle :* Ability to achieve desired objectives through other means :* Accepted practice :* Political concerns :* The enemy might declare fight to the death :* Fear of repercussions = Risk and cost = A successful battle of annihilation usually requires exposing one's own army to loss in a way that more conservative tactics do not. For example, attempting to turn an enemy's flank generally requires one to separate the flanking force from one's main body. This exposes the attacking force to defeat in detail. Attempting to pierce the enemy's center is usually costly in itself, and also exposes the vanguard force to a destructive counterstrike. This was an especially important consideration during the pre-Napoleonic era, when armies were relatively small forces composed of professional career soldiers and losses were difficult to replace. Besides, weakening one's own army might expose it to other enemies, or political struggles, and even internal enemies: a pretender to the throne or a coalition of nobles might challenge the king, a province might rebel to the central government or a third nation could exploit the situation, while the main army suffered heavy casualties after the battle. Winning a battle with a high cost is commonly referred to as a Pyrrhic victory. Pyrrhus of Epirus obtained a decisive battle against the Romans, but suffered so heavy casualties that was unable to continue the campaign and went instead to Sicily, trying to raise new forces and form a coalition of Greek cities. Later the Romans were able to train new levies and avenge the battle by defeating Pyrrhus. = Lack of means = From the Renaissance until the advent of military mechanization, armies were slow on the battlefield (not necessarily slow operationally). This was due to the declining efficacy of cavalry and to the advent of artillery, which is difficult to move. This made it difficult to move quickly enough to prevent an enemy from countering a battle stratagem, or, failing that, to withdraw safely. = Using other means = If the object of war is to destroy the enemy's ability to resist politically, this may be achieved by other, less expensive, methods. For example, one may attempt to maneuver one's army in such a way as to cut off the enemy from its base of supplies. If this is done successfully, the enemy may be forced to seek terms with its army intact. This sort of campaign was typical of Enlightenment armies, and is especially associated with the campaigns of Frederick the Great. The French Campaign of 1940 offers an example. After the Germans broke into the French rear at Sedan, they were able to surround the main Allied armies and render their position untenable. No great battle of annihilation was required. (Alternatively, the Germans considered instead striking toward Paris. Capture of Paris might have broken the French morale and political will to resist). During antiquity, an example is the Battle of the Caudine Forks. Despite the name, it was not a battle: the Samnites managed to trick and deceive a Roman army, leading it inside a valley surrounded by mountains. The Romans were trapped and could only surrender. = Accepted practice = In warfare, as in many avenues of human endeavor, the optimal application of material means is sometimes limited by the failure of imagination. A successful battle of annihilation generally requires great skill and daring on the part of the attacking commander. If a commander's training, experience, and peer relationships have not prepared him to expect a battle of annihilation, this alone may prevent him envisioning such a battle. For example, during the American Civil War, several Union Army generals were not able to imagine a battle of annihilation even during opportunities when the Union Army of the Potomac had sufficient strength in forces and the material means to conduct such a battle. = Political considerations = A war with limited political objectives may require the adoption of a limited military strategy, including the avoidance of a battle of annihilation. During the Battle of the Caudine Forks, the Samnite commander, Gaius Pontius was persuaded to send a letter to his father, Herennius, asking what to do with the trapped Roman forces. The reply came back that the Romans should be sent on their way unharmed as quickly as possible because if the Samnites let the Romans free without harm, they would gain the Romans' friendship. However, his advice was rejected, and Herennius then proposed to kill the entire Roman army so that Rome would be so weakened that they would not pose a threat for many generations. He insisted that any middle way would be utter folly and would leave the Romans smarting for revenge without weakening them. The Battle of the Catalaunian Plains is commonly referred to as a victory of the coalition led by the Roman general, Flavius Aetius, and the Visigothic king, Theodoric I, against the Huns and their vassals commanded by their king Attila. However, the battle was tactically inconclusive: although the Romans stopped the Huns' attempt to establish vassals in Roman Gaul and installed Merovech as king of the Franks, the defeated Hunnic army retained much of its manpower, and the Huns successfully looted and pillaged much of Gaul and crippled the military capacity of the Romans and Visigoths. It has been speculated that Aetius wanted not to destroy the Huns but to settle down an agreement with Attila, pacify the horde and maybe even draft mercenaries from it while Aetius maintained order among his Germanic allies by the threat of a common enemy. Without the Huns, the Germans would later turn against the Romans. However, Aetius' death prevented such a plan to develop, if sought. In the Gulf War, the Allied forces could have sought and won a battle of annihilation against the Iraqi Republican Guard. It was decided, however, that the annihilation of the Republican Guard might have led to the dissolution of the Iraqi state. = Fight to death = If a side in a war is willing enough, such as by religious zeal, nationalism or ideological belief, defeat or surrender to the enemy can be seen as worse than death and thus being rejected. Humiliation and war honor are common reasons, but also fear of torture, pillage, enslavement or other crimes might convince that fighting to the end is better than surrendering. Military forces fighting fanatically have also been documented to be common after reports of brutal treatment, such as murder and rape, against the civilians of that nation. That can be especially true when the opposing side is seen as ultimately untrustworthy or despicable, and bloodshed in a merciless battle can feed that opinion. Suffering such a defeat might rise up morale and determination in the defeated side, which, instead of surrendering, might spend all its manpower and resources into war seeking revenge and ultimate victory. If surrounded and without means of recover, the defeated side might force the enemy to lay siege to an important fort or city before claiming victory, leading to unwanted casualties, attrition and delay. That can turn the aftermath of a victorious battle of annihilation into a slow strategic and political defeat. The Punic Wars are a common example of war fury and obstinacy, especially after a ruining defeat. During the Second Punic War, the Carthaginian commander Hannibal was able to defeat the Romans in four major battles, culminating in the Battle of Cannae in which an army of 80,000 Roman legionaries was annihilated with a huge number of deaths from soldiers to important officers and senators. However, Hannibal's proposals of peace were rejected, and the Romans started to fortify the city for a supposed final assault. Hannibal's forces never laid siege to Rome and instead moved to Capua. Many historians agree that the decision was due to Hannibal's army not having enough manpower and machines to lay siege since promised reinforcements from Carthage never came. The Romans later recovered, defeated Hannibal at the Battle of Zama, and in the end won the war. During the Texas Revolution, Mexican troops launched an assault to a fort in the Battle of Alamo, killing all of the Texan defenders and annihilating the whole militia and garrison forces. General Santa Anna's cruelty during the battle inspired many Texans, both Texas settlers and adventurers from the United States, to join the Texan Army. Buoyed by a desire for revenge, the Texans defeated the Mexican Army at the Battle of San Jacinto, on April 21, 1836, ending the revolution. During Operation Barbarossa, German forces encountered friendly partisans and volunteers called Hilfswillige who joined them to oppose the Soviet Union. An example is the Russian Liberation Army. However, the Nazi policy of occupation and colonization with exploitation, pillaging, massacre of eastern civilians seen as slaves and inferior beings (Generalplan Ost), the acts of the Einsatzgruppen, and the lack of mercy against prisoners and defeated enemies ultimately alienated any definitive support that they could have had from Russians and other ethnicities in Soviet Union against their leaders. That behaviour led Stalin to proclaim the Great Patriotic War, gaining consensus in the face of the enemy invader and raising population and morale against the enemy.

It is the administrative center of Bikoro Territory. In 2012, the estimated population was 7,426. Bikoro was the episcopal see of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Bikoro (which started as a mission sui iuris in 1931) until its suppression in 1975. In 2018, Bikoro was affected by an outbreak of Ebola virus disease, the ninth in the DRC's history. Trivia There is an airfield called Bikoro Airport found in official registers with the ICAO-Code FZBC. Bikoro never had an airport as various old maps and aeronautical charts confirm. It is instead served by the airfield of Yembe-Moke (FZEM) located 7 miles north-east of the town. Additionally, the third letter \\"B\\" in the code indicates that the airport is located the former province of Bandundu. Bikoro is located in the former province of Equateur. It is therefore assumed that FZBC is actually the ICAO code intended for Bokoro airport that has been wrongly assigned due to a spelling error.

The main character, Simon \\"Piet\\" Van der Valk, was played by Barry Foster from 1972 to 1992, and by Marc Warren in 2020. The original five series were produced for the ITV network between 1972 and 1992. In April 2020 there was a new series, again produced for ITV, and starring Marc Warren in the title role. Adaptations of the original stories have also been made for film and radio. Original series (1972‚Äì1992) The DVD Box-set of the original series =Cast= * Barry Foster as Commissaris Simon \\"Piet\\" Van der Valk * Michael Latimer as Inspecteur Johnny Kroon (Series 1‚Äî2) * Susan Travers as Arlette Van der Valk (Series 1‚Äî2) * Joanna Dunham as Arlette Van der Valk (Series 3) * Meg Davies as Arlette Van der Valk (Series 4‚Äî5) * Martin Wyldeck as Hoofd-commissaris Samson (Series 1) * Nigel Stock as Hoofd-commissaris Samson (Series 3) * Ronald Hines as Hoofd- commissaris Samson (Series 4‚Äî5) * Sydney Tafler as Hoofd-commissaris Halsbeek (Series 2) * Richard Huw as Wim Van der Valk (Series 4‚Äî5) * Dave Carter as Brig. Stribos (Series 1‚Äî2) * Natasha Pyne as Janet (Series 4‚Äî5) * Alan Haines as Brig. Mertens (Series 1) =Setting and characters= The television series was based on the characters and atmosphere, but not the plots, of the original novels. The stories mostly take place in and around Amsterdam, where Commissaris van der Valk is a cynical yet intuitive detective. Drugs, sex and murder are among the gritty themes of the casework, presented in contrast to the picturesque locations and the upbeat theme music (see below). In the opening credits of the first series Van der Valk is standing inside the tower of the Westerkerk. Van der Valk contrasts with his na√Øve assistant, Inspecteur Johnny Kroon, played by Michael Latimer (only in the first three series), and his superior, Hoofd-commissaris Samson, who deals with the political fallout of the cases. (Samson was played by three actors over the course of the show: Martin Wyldeck for two episodes in 1972, Nigel Stock for 12 episodes in 1977, and Ronald Hines for the revival in 1991‚Äì92.) Van der Valk's French wife Arlette was played by three actresses over the course of the show's twenty- year run: initially by Susan Travers, Joanna Dunham for the third series, and finally Meg Davies for the revival in 1991-92. Other actors in the series included Alan Haines, who played Brig Mertens, and Richard Huw, who played Van Der Valk's son Wim, also a police detective, in the revival. =Theme music= The signature tune, \\"Eye Level\\", was composed by Jack Trombey (a pseudonym of a Dutch composer, Jan Stoeckart) and was performed by the Simon Park Orchestra. It reached number one in the UK singles charts in 1973. Also that year Matt Monro charted with a vocal version titled \\"And You Smiled\\". In the final TV series the theme was played at a slightly faster tempo than previously. =Production details= The original series were all produced by Thames Television for the ITV network. The first and second series were recorded on 2\\" quadruplex videotape at Thames' Teddington Studios in London, with location scenes shot in Amsterdam on 16mm film. The third series was generally made on location, entirely on 16mm film, by Thames's subsidiary Euston Films. The fourth series was recorded on Panasonic MII videotape, with location shooting on 35mm film. Series five was similarly shot, but with the studio recording on D-3 videotape. The final two series were transmitted in stereo sound using the NICAM system. Network released all five series on Region 2 DVD on 22 October 2007. =Episodes= Series 1 (1972) { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"width100%;\\" - ! style=\\"background:#FF5C72;\\" Episode ! style=\\"background:#FF5C72;\\" Title ! style=\\"background:#FF5C72;\\" Written by ! style=\\"background:#FF5C72;\\" Directed by ! style=\\"background:#FF5C72;\\" Original airdate } Series 2 (1973) { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"width:100%;\\" - style=\\"color:#fff;\\" ! style=\\"background:#005d46;\\" Episode ! style=\\"background:#005d46;\\" Title ! style=\\"background:#005d46;\\" Written by ! style=\\"background:#005d46;\\" Directed by ! style=\\"background:#005d46;\\" Original airdate } Series 3 (1977) { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"width:100%;\\" - style=\\"color:#fff;\\" ! style=\\"background:#00A1D7;\\" Episode ! style=\\"background:#00A1D7;\\" Title ! style=\\"background:#00A1D7;\\" Written by ! style=\\"background:#00A1D7;\\" Directed by ! style=\\"background:#00A1D7;\\" Original airdate } Series 4 (1991) { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"width:100%;\\" - style=\\"color:#fff;\\" ! style=\\"background:#FF623B;\\" Episode ! style=\\"background:#FF623B;\\" Title ! style=\\"background:#FF623B;\\" Written by ! style=\\"background:#FF623B;\\" Directed by ! style=\\"background:#FF623B;\\" Original airdate } Series 5 (1992) { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"width:100%;\\" - style=\\"color:#fff;\\" ! style=\\"background:#070065;\\" Episode ! style=\\"background:#070065;\\" Title ! style=\\"background:#070065;\\" Written by ! style=\\"background:#070065;\\" Directed by ! style=\\"background:#070065;\\" Original airdate } Four Oaks Mystery Van der Valk also appears in the second and final parts of The Four Oaks Mystery, part of the 1992 ITV Telethon.

Gameplay The player starts the game with a party of four characters, who can be either the default characters or ones created by the player. Alternatively, the player may import characters from The Bard's Tale trilogy into Dragon Wars. During the game, the seven character slots can be filled with any combination of the starting characters, recruited characters, and summoned creatures. Plot The story from the back of the original box: Development During the initial design process for Bard's Tale III: Thief of Fate, one of the designers came up with a list of enhancements and improvements for the game. With the possibility that Interplay would soon be parting ways with Electronic Arts, it was decided to save these for a future game and stick closer to the original engine, though the auto-mapping feature did make it into Bard's Tale III. These design improvements came in this next game, Dragon Wars. In essence, the game was a fusion of Bard's Tale and design philosophy pioneered in Wasteland.Rebecca Heineman Interview. Digit Press, 2006. Until a month before release, the game was developed as Bard's Tale IV. However, the rights to the title were still held by Electronic Arts, and thus a new title and setting were needed for the game. It was derived in part from the Sumerian legends of Gilgamesh, with the chief villain of the game being named Namtar. Since to this point the game didn't feature any dragons, the new title meant that Heineman had to add one. Interplay advertisements displayed the slogan \\"Bard's Tale Fans Rejoice!\\" above the game's name, and mentioned Dragon Wars ability to import Bard's Tale characters. The designers all felt it was a better game than Bard's Tale III, and indeed, better than any of the Bard's Tale series, but without the tie-in to the old title and without Electronic Arts's marketing muscle, the game did not fare as well. To defend against pirated copies of the game, Dragon Wars included a collection of numbered paragraphs within their manual.Copyright protection paragraph reference Classicgaming.cc 2016 Players would receive an in-game message (i.e. \\"Read paragraph 23\\"), and have to refer back to the printed material. The game is very difficult to play without references to the paragraphs, and many parts become meaningless. This form of security was widely used at the time. Reception Dragon Wars was reviewed in 1989 in Dragon #152 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in \\"The Role of Computers\\" column. The reviewers gave the game 5 out of 5 stars. Scorpia gave the game a positive review in Computer Gaming World in 1989, noting improvements over the Bard's Tale series, saying that, \\"Tighter design, attention to detail, balanced combat, and a carefully constructed plotline all combine to produce a CRPG well worth playing.\\" In 1993 she stated that the game was \\"a good choice when you want something a bit more than a standard slicer/dicer\\". The game was later included in the Interplay's 10 Year Anthology Classic Collection released in 1993.

Early and personal life Brian Macdonald was born in Montreal, Quebec on May 14, 1928. His father Ian was Irish and worked at Dominion Glass Co. as a sales manager while his mother Mabel Lee was Scottish. Macdonald was a child actor for Radio-Canada and studied piano. In 1959 Macdonald's first wife Olivia Wyatt died in an automobile accident. Macdonald became a single father, raising his three-year-old son. Macdonald met his second wife Annette av Paul while the artistic director of the Royal Swedish Ballet. They married in 1964. He died on November 29, 2014 in Stratford, Ontario of bone cancer. Professional career =Dancer= Macdonald was taking a B.A. in English at McGill University when he began ballet classes with noted teachers Gerald Crevier and Elizabeth Leese. From 1947-1949 he was music critic for the Montreal Herald. Macdonald joined the National Ballet of Canada in 1951 and was one of its founding members. He left the company in 1953 due to a serious arm injury. =Ballet choreographer= Early on in his dance training Macdonald was inspired to study choreography, affected by the Ballets Russes rehearsal of Concerto Barocco by George Balanchine in Montreal. He was struck by the way the ballerinas were dancing en pointe and in high heels. In 1956 he established his own company called the Montreal Theatre Ballet. He went on to create works for the Royal Winnipeg Ballet such as The Darkling in 1958 and Les Whoops De Doo in 1959. One of his most acclaimed works was Time Out of Mind created for Joffrey Ballet in 1963. He choreographed Rose Latulippe in 1966, which was Canada's first evening-length ballet performance and the first full-length colour production filmed by the Canadian Broadcasting Company. He was artistic director of the Royal Swedish Ballet from 1964‚Äì1967 and artistic director of Harkness Ballet from 1967-1968, during which time he choreographed Canto Indio. He then moved on to become artistic director of Israel's Batsheva Dance Theatre from 1971‚Äì1972 and Les Grands Ballets Canadiens from 1974-1977, where he choreographed Tam Ti Delam in 1974 and Lignes et Pointes. In 1978 Macdonald choreographed Double Quartet which features a young woman and her admirers dancing to the string quartets of Schubert and R. Murray Schafer. Macdonald's last choreographic work was Requiem 9/11, which premiered at the National Arts Centre in 2002. The piece was Macdonald's perspective of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, performed to Giuseppe Verdi's Requiem. The ballet was danced in front of images of violent events from history. The dancers were covered in ash-looking makeup to reflect the appearance of survivors fleeing the World Trade Center buildings. The dance was well received by audience members and critics. Hugh Winsor from The Globe and Mail, who was present at the inaugural performance, wrote that the audience gave the show \\"an extended standing ovation.\\" =Musical theatre choreographer and director= In 1957, Macdonald and his wife, Olivia choreographed the satirical revue My Fur Lady which went on a national tour of over 400 performances. In 1968 Macdonald directed Maggie Flynn for its premiere on Broadway. Macdonald moved to Stratford, Ontario and became an associate director of the Stratford Festival. He became known for reviving Gilbert and Sullivan operettas to critical acclaim. He directed The Mikado in 1982 which toured the world until it made its debut on Broadway. It earned Macdonald Tony Award nominations for Best Choreography and Best Direction of a Musical. Macdonald's last directed musical at the Stratford Festival was The Music Man in 1996, ending 17 seasons with the Stratford Festival. =Opera= Macdonald's debut as an opera director was Cosi fan tutte by Wolfgang Mozart in 1972. This was followed by Massenet's Cendrillon in 1979 and Madama Butterfly in 1990. His final work was a revival his 1990 staging of Madama Butterfly with the Canadian Opera Company in 2014. The show was praised for the talent of the cast in their vocal abilities. The show was criticised for a lack of emotional connection between the performers, with Richard Ouzounian of the Toronto Star saying, \\"[T]he whole thing now has that \\"paint by the numbers\\" kind of feel about it, with everyone coughing up lungfuls of emotion, but rarely connecting to each other at all in any genuine way.\\" Robert Harris of The Globe and Mail commented that the show struggled to overcome issues of racism and prejudice that exist in the opera. =Dance teacher= In 1982 Macdonald became the head of the Banff Centre's Summer Dance Program. He split the program into a training section and a professional section which performed remounted works by Macdonald, George Balanchine and winners of the Clifford E Lee Choreographic Award. Some of his students have included Johnny Wright, the male lead in the West End production of Dirty Dancing, and Crystal Pite. He was head of the program until 2001 when he became artistic advisor from 2001-2007.

It is a waxy white solid with a sweet odor. Its primary use is to couple amino acids during artificial peptide synthesis. The low melting point of this material allows it to be melted for easy handling. It is highly soluble in dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile and dimethylformamide, but insoluble in water. Structure and spectroscopy The C-N=C=N-C core of carbodiimides (N=C=N) is linear, being related to the structure of allene. The molecule has idealized C2 symmetry. The N=C=N moiety gives characteristic IR spectroscopic signature at 2117 cm‚àí1. The 15N NMR spectrum shows a characteristic shift of 275 ppm upfield of nitric acid and the 13C NMR spectrum features a peak at about 139 ppm downfield from TMS. Preparation Of the several syntheses of DCC, Pri-Bara et al. use palladium acetate, iodine, and oxygen to couple cyclohexyl amine and cyclohexyl isocyanide. Yields of up to 67% have been achieved using this route: : C6H11NC + C6H11NH2 \\\\+ O2 ‚Üí (C6H11N)2C + H2O Tang et al. condense two isocyanates using the catalyst OP(MeNCH2CH2)3N in yields of 92%: :Homogeneous catalysis DCC has also been prepared from dicyclohexylurea using a phase transfer catalyst by Jaszay et al. The disubstituted urea, arenesulfonyl chloride, and potassium carbonate react in toluene in the presence of benzyl triethylammonium chloride to give DCC in 50% yield. :Phase transfer catalysis Reactions =Amide-, peptide-, and ester formation= DCC is a dehydrating agent for the preparation of amides, ketones and nitriles. In these reactions, DCC hydrates to form dicyclohexylurea (DCU), a compound that is nearly insoluble in most organic solvents and insoluble in water. The majority of the DCU is thus readily removed by filtration, although the last traces can be difficult to eliminate from non-polar products. DCC can also be used to invert secondary alcohols. In the Steglich esterification, alcohols, including even some tertiary alcohols, can be esterified using a carboxylic acid in the presence of DCC and a catalytic amount of DMAP. In protein synthesis (such as Fmoc solid-state synthesizers), the N-terminus is often used as the attachment site on which the amino acid monomers are added. To enhance the electrophilicity of carboxylate group, the negatively charged oxygen must first be \\"activated\\" into a better leaving group. DCC is used for this purpose. The negatively charged oxygen will act as a nucleophile, attacking the central carbon in DCC. DCC is temporarily attached to the former carboxylate group forming a highly electrophilic intermediate, making nucleophilic attack by the terminal amino group on the growing peptide more efficient. =Moffatt oxidation= In combination with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), DCC effects the Pfitzner-Moffatt oxidation. This procedure is used for the oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes and ketones. Unlike metal-mediated oxidations, such as the Jones oxidation, the reaction conditions are sufficiently mild to avoid over-oxidation of aldehydes to carboxylic acids. Generally, three equivalents of DCC and 0.5 equivalent of proton source in DMSO are allowed to react overnight at room temperature. The reaction is quenched with acid. =Other reactions= *Reaction of an acid with hydrogen peroxide in presence of DCC leads to formation of peroxide linkage. *Alcohols can also be dehydrated using DCC. This reaction proceeds by first giving the O-acylurea intermediate which is then hydrogenolyzed to produce the corresponding alkene: :RCHOHCH2R' + C6H11N)2C ‚Üí RCH=CHR' + (C6H11NH)2CO *Secondary alcohols can be stereochemically inverted by formation of a formyl ester followed by saponification. The secondary alcohol is mixed directly with DCC, formic acid, and a strong base such as sodium methoxide. Biological action DCC is a classical inhibitor of ATP synthase. DCC inhibits ATP synthase by binding to one of the c subunits and causing steric hindrance of the rotation of the FO subunit. Safety DCC is a potent allergen and a sensitizer, often causing skin rashes. See also * Carbodiimide References External links * An excellent illustration of this mechanism can be found here: .

Before official release, K750 was known by its codename Clara. There also was a T-Mobile exclusive version called D750i. Its hardware was similar to the K750i had T-Mobile branding with a light blue/white body and looked very similar to the Sony Ericsson W800. Design The K750i is a candybar style phone that weighs 99 grams (3.5 ounces), with its buttons that can be used with any finger. It has the 'dual-front' design common to most Sony Ericsson mobile phones since the T610, with the back of the mobile phone designed like a digital camera and intended to be held sideways to take photographs. The K750i is available in four colours, Blue, Oxidized Black, metallic red and Blasted Silver (the latter of which is exclusive to Vodafone in the United Kingdom) with a red version later released. The central joystick button is used for selecting options and navigating menus, with the \\"C\\" button as an 'undo' or 'delete' button, and the arrow-labelled button as a 'return' or 'back' button. The two buttons labelled by white horizontal lines, known as 'hotkeys' or 'soft keys' perform the function of making binary decisions, labelled on the phone's display. The button in between of these 'soft keys' acts as a shortcut key, which brings up a user-customisable shortcut menu when pressed. The on/off button is located on the top of the phone next to the IrDA port. right side ; shows: camera button, volume up/down button 2 megapixel camera There is one side key on the left of the phone; when pressed in standby mode, it opens either the RDS FM radio or the Media Player as selected by the user, allowing playback of WAV/MP3/AAC audio files, and 3GP/MPEG-4 video files. A press of this button in media player mode plays or pauses the selected media. The RDS FM radio has 20 user-configurable presets. The phone also features Sony's Mega Bass technology. The left-hand side of the phone also houses the Memory Stick PRO Duo slot for external solid state memory, which is protected by a flexible rubber cover. On the right-hand side of the phone there are three keys - two for controlling volume, skipping through tracks in the Media Player and zooming in and out when in camera mode. If the button is pressed when the headset isn't attached the phone displays a phone status screen showing profile, memory usage, battery level, and, on some mobile networks, phone number. The included handsfree headset is also required to listen to the radio since it functions as the antenna.

AAC support is good, and the phone can only properly handle LC AAC. HE-AAC (a.k.a. AAC+, a.k.a. eAAC) will play since HE-AAC is designed to be backwards compatible, however the SBR component will be ignored. The same is true with HE-AAC v2 (a.k.a. eAAC+), only the normal LC component of the file will be played. The SBR and parametric stereo (introduced with HE-AAC v2) is ignored. Since HE-AAC v2 encodes the sound as a mono-aural track and the stereo separation is recreated through the PS data, HE-AAC v2 files played on a K750 actually play back in mono. The phone can also be used as a modem via Bluetooth, Infrared or USB. According to the Sony Ericsson website, the K750 has a talk time battery life of 9 hours and a standby time battery life of 600 hours. Modding Since K750i and W800i are essentially two phones with exactly same hardware specifications, soft modifications are available to convert a K750i to a W800i by using flashing software and the firmware files of the W800i model. Such modified phone will be able to use the Walkman feature which is available to W series phones only. Such phone can also use the flight mode option which allows the phone to work only as a media player while other functions, like cellphone radio system, are turned off. This option is useful when in places where mobile phone transmitters should be turned off. The Activity Menu will not be present which appears when the button between the left and right softkey is pressed. Instead the Walkman player appears when it is pressed. This modification will revoke any remaining warranty for the phone. Modding also called as flashing is done by software such as XS++ or Far Manager or SE tool.

According to John Kroknes, creative director at Amuze, the game was strongly influenced by 1980s action movies and Paul Verhoeven's science fiction films. For the majority of the game, the gameplay is that of a third-person shooter as players control protagonist Jack Wade. Jack travels between the main levels of the game on his motorcycle, and these sections take the form of a racing game, with the motorbike's acceleration and braking controlled using the sensitive analogue trigger buttons of the Dreamcast control pad. A sequel was released in 2004 called Headhunter Redemption and it was released on PlayStation 2 and Xbox. Plot The game takes place in the near future in a city similar to Los Angeles, California. Criminals are punished for their crimes not only by serving time in prison but by having their internal organs surgically removed (if they lost to another prisoner in an underwater arena) and transplanted to benefit the wealthier members of society. Officially responsible for law enforcement are the Anti-Crime Network (ACN) organisation and their employees, the bounty hunter-like Headhunters. In order to prevent damage occurring to the criminals' organs as they are apprehended, conventional firearms have been banned, replaced by Electric Neural Projectile (ENP) guns that fire special bullets which do not damage flesh but instead emit an electrical charge that causes severe pain in victims, paralyses muscles and eventually kills the brain. According to the game, ENP technology was developed by Biotech and the main manufacturer of ENP handguns is Smith & Easton (a reference to the firearms manufacturer Smith & Wesson), although the technology can also be used with grenades, proximity mines, rocket launchers and other explosives. The game begins with Jack escaping from a secret laboratory, but soon after going outside he faints and falls unconscious. He wakes up in hospital and learns that he is suffering from amnesia and that although he was once the very best Headhunter, his license has now been revoked. In order to investigate the murder of ACN founder Christopher Stern, he must re-earn his Headhunter licence by taking part in virtual-reality tests (called LEILA tests) and capture some of the most dangerous criminals in the city. Throughout the game, Jack is aided by Christopher Stern's daughter Angela and his old boss Chief Hawke; although he also finds that his main rival to the title of best Headhunter is the unpleasant Hank Redwood. The game's storyline progresses through standard FMV cutscenes, propaganda commercials and satirical news broadcasts (presented by the fictional Bill Waverley and Kate Gloss). Reception The Dreamcast version received \\"generally favourable reviews\\", while the PlayStation 2 version received \\"average\\" reviews, according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. The Dreamcast version received a highly favourable review from Eurogamers Tom Bramwell. He noted that it had been compared to Metal Gear Solid, but considered the setting and story to be superior in Headhunter. The game was described as \\"a masterpiece of modern videogame development\\".

The Palazzo della Ragione is a medieval market hall, town hall and palace of justice building in Padua, in the Veneto region of Italy. The upper floor was dedicated to the town and justice administration; while the ground floor still hosts the historical cover market of the city. The palace separates the two market squares of Piazza delle Erbe from Piazza dei Frutti. It is popularly called \\"il Salone\\" (the big Hall). Details The building, with its great hall on the upper floor hence the name \\"Salone\\" (\\"big Hall\\"), is believed to be one of the largest medieval halls still extant; the hall is nearly rectangular, its length 81.5m, its breadth 27m, and its height 24 m; the walls are covered with allegorical frescoes. The building stands on arches, and the upper storey is surrounded by an open loggia, not unlike that which surrounds the Basilica Palladiana in Vicenza, that was indeed inspired by Padua's Palazzo della Ragione. The Palazzo was begun in 1172 and finished in 1219. In 1306, Fra Giovanni, an Augustinian friar, covered the whole with one roof; originally there were three roofs, spanning the three chambers into which the hall was at first divided; the internal partition walls remained until the fire of 1420, when the Venetian architects who undertook the restoration removed them, throwing all three spaces into one and forming the present great hall, the Salone. The new space was refrescoed by Nicol√≤ Miretto and Stefano da Ferrara, working from 1425 to 1440. Some of the frescoes depict the astrological theories of Pietro d'Abano, a professor at Padua University in the 13th century. The gigantic wooden horse on the western side of the hall was built in 1466 and is modelled on Donatello's Equestrian statue of Gattamelata which is in place on Piazza del Santo. On the eastern side there is a contemporary version of a Foucault pendulum.Province of Padua Tourism website.

It extended the philosophies of an earlier Yorkshire Society which, in 1818, wished to encourage people born, working or living in the County of Yorkshire to join and then help improve several aspects of the area, including the social welfare of its people as well as Yorkshire's physical environment. Traditionally, the patron of the Yorkshire Society is the Duke of York, and its current Chairman is Sir Rodney Walker. History Earlier Societies of the same name included the organisation which ran the Yorkshire Society's Schools on Westminster Road in London. The Yorkshire Society referenced in 1818 was headed by wealthy Yorkshire gentry who were keen to provide charity to the working class and poor throughout much of Yorkshire. As is the case today, the organisation's patron was the Duke of York. Goals Although there has long been an implication that the organisation is embedded with wealthy \\"Society\\" members, its membership is open to all who are interested in the following: *To improve the beauty, attraction and amenities in the Yorkshire countryside, towns, villages, historic houses and monuments of all kinds by encouraging and assisting local branches of the Society to prepare, fund and carry through projects in their own areas. *Working with other established organisations in their efforts to generate and promote tourism in the County. *Supporting efforts to study and solve some of the industrial, commercial and unemployment problems in the area. *Drawing together in fellowship Yorkshire folk by mounting regional and local events and providing a forum for discussion and debate.  Charitable works The Yorkshire Awards, held in Autumn each year, generate substantial funds for many charities. The Society co-sponsors the annual Yorkshire Awards alongside Yorkshire Television, Joshua Tetley, Asda, Aon, Bain Hogg, Yorkshire Electricity and the Yorkshire Bank. The Society's award category is the Yorkshire Lifetime Achievement Award. To date recipients have included Lawrence Batley, Ken Morrison, Victor Watson, Lord Harewood, Roy Mason, Baron Mason of Barnsley, Professor Tom Kilburn, Brian Rix, Lord Rix, Michael Parkinson, Barry Cryer, Brian Turner and Ashley Jackson.

The school was the first fully authorised institution in Italy to offer all three of the programmes of the International Baccalaureate: Primary Years Programme, Middle Years Programme and Diploma Programme, for students aged 2 to 19. The International School of Milan is the largest and oldest school in a group of International Schools in Italy run by the Inspired Group: the others are Monza, Modena, Siena and Bergamo although there are many other schools within the organization's global network. It has a partner school in Aliso Veijo, California, and supports educational projects in India, Zambia, Cambodia, Ethiopia as well as local projects. In addition, the school is part of a range of international school organizations and networks. The school is the largest and oldest international curriculum school in Milan and sends graduates to universities in the UK, US, Italy and all over the world. The current Headmaster of the school is Stephen Rogers who joined from the English International School, Prague in 2017. History Founded in 1958, the school initially offered the British O Levels/GCSE and A Levels. The International Baccalaureate was gradually adopted as the main curriculum after the Italian government recognized the IB as equivalent to the Maturit√† (the Italian equivalent of A Levels) during the late 1980s to early 1990s. The British curriculum is no longer taught and ISM is solely an IB World School. In September 2013, the school opened a brand-new purpose-built campus in Baranzate, northern Milan which united the Primary, Middle and High School sections of the school. International School of Europe The network was founded in 2008. ISM, as well as its sister schools in Monza (1984), Rome (1988) and Modena (1998), are part of the network.

Life Little is known of Meletus' life beyond what is portrayed in the Socratic literature, particularly Plato's dialogues, where he is named as the chief accuser of Socrates. In the Euthyphro, Plato describes Meletus as the youngest of the three prosecutors, having \\"a beak, and long straight hair, and a beard which is ill grown,\\" and being unknown to Socrates prior to the prosecution.Plato, Euthyphro, 2b Meletus is also mentioned briefly in the Theaetetus. The later Greek historian Diogenes La√´rtius dubiously reported that after the execution of Socrates \\"Athenians felt such remorse\\" that they executed Meletus and banished his associates from the city.Diogenes La√´rtius, 2.43 He also argues that it was Antisthenes, the disciple of Socrates and founder of Cynicism, who was largely thought responsible for the execution of Meletus.Diogenes La√´rtius, 6.9 Trial of Socrates During the first three hours of trial, Meletus and the other two accusers each stood in the law court in the center of Athens to deliver previously crafted speeches to the jury against Socrates. No record of Meletus' speech survives. However, within the Apology we do have Plato's record of Socrates' cross-examination of Meletus, per the Athenian legal convention allowing the defendant to cross-examine the accuser. Using his characteristic Socratic method, Socrates makes Meletus to seem an inarticulate fool. He says that Socrates corrupts the young, and that Socrates is the only one to do so, but he can not provide a motive for why Socrates would do this.Plato, Apology, 24c‚Äì28a Socrates shows that if he were to do this it must surely be in ignorance, for no good man would intentionally make bad those living around him. Concerning the accusation that Socrates believed in strange spirits and not the gods of the state, Socrates shows that Meletus is saying that spirits are the offspring of gods, and since no one believes in flutes playing without flute players, or in horses' offspring without horses, Socrates could not believe in the offspring of gods without believing in gods.

The town had a population of 220 as of the 2010 Census. Bodega is located on Bodega Highway, about west of Freestone, California. Salmon Creek flows through the town. History Watson School The town of Bodega was known historically as Bodega Corners or Bodega Roads, to distinguish it from the Port of Bodega or Bodega Bay, as it is known today, which is about four miles from Bodega. Bodega and Bodega Bay are named for discoverer of the bay, Juan Francisco Bodega y Caudra, who first sailed into the harbor in 1775. There were formerly two Coast Miwok villages in the area: one (called Kennekono) sited near the current town and another (called Suwutenne) further north. The first Europeans in the area were Russians who established temporary settlements at Bodega Bay and the Salmon Creek Valley, in the vicinity of Bodega, in 1809. In 1843, Captain Stephen Smith established the first West Coast lumber mill near Bodega. Around the same time, John A. Sutter bought land from the Russians, an area that included Bodega. His land purchase included \\"some hunting rights, a small boat, several rusty cannons, and some old muskets.\\" In 1859, shipbuilders constructed Saint Teresa of Avila Church. Open from 1856 to 1967, Watson School, once served as Bodega's school, and is located in a Sonoma County Regional Parks Department historic park about 2 miles east of Bodega. In 1963, much of Bodega was used for exterior filming in Alfred Hitchcock's film, The Birds, where it was presented as the nearby shore village of Bodega Bay. Bodega's Potter School, now a private residence, was used as the Bodega Bay School in the movie; and Bodega's general store also appeared \\"as itself\\", though it has since been moved from its original site.

Also in the context of video games, ‚Äúnuking‚Äù may also describe the act of using a nuclear weapon while playing the game, such as the atomic bomb in Call of Duty games. The term is notably dissimilar in different genres. In an MMORPG, nuking may differ in meaning between different communities. For example, to some individuals, to ‚Äúnuke‚Äù is to deal the most possible damage to the most enemies possible (almost exclusively by means of an area of effect skill), whereas other individuals use the term by referring to the highest possible damage to a single target in the shortest amount of time, also known as a spike. Some individuals believe that the player, or players, nuking must do so by means of ranged combat (that is, out of melee range); others make no such distinction. It can also mean to critical hit often or just to deal high standard damage. In a real-time or turn-based strategy game, the term \\"nuke\\" has one distinct use. It can describe the tactic of attacking an opponent's specific (often high-priority) units with high-damage spells in order to kill them or force (or strongly encourage) the opposing player to remove them from battle. Such usage is common in Warcraft III, in which \\"Heroes\\" are frequently the targets and attackers due to their relative high priority and common faculty for high-damaging spells.

She sued for her own freedom based on having been held illegally as a child slave in the free state of Illinois. In 1842 Berry sued for the freedom of her daughter Lucy Ann Berry, as the girl had legally been born to a free woman. That case was argued by Edward Bates, the future U.S. Attorney General under President Abraham Lincoln. Polly Berry's life is primarily known through her daughter's memoir, From the Darkness Cometh the Light, or, Struggles for Freedom (1891), the only first-person account of a freedom suit. She published her memoir under her married name of Lucy Delaney. In the 1990s, the case files of these two suits were among more than 300 freedom suits discovered among nineteenth-century Circuit Court records in St. Louis. The Missouri State Archives and Washington University have created a searchable online database of the freedom suit files containing scanned images of the complete case files (which tend to be brief documents) held by the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis and the Missouri Historical Society.\\"Freedom Suits\\" , \\"St. Louis Circuit Court Records\\", Missouri State Archives and Washington University, accessed 4 January 2011 and 21 October 2012 Biography In her case which she filed in 1839, Polly deposed that she was held as a child in slavery in Wayne County, Kentucky by Joseph Crockett.Wong (2009), p. 138 When she was about fourteen, he migrated west and took her with him to Illinois, where they stayed for several weeks. Illinois as a free state held that slaveholders who brought slaves into the state for extended periods forfeited their rights to their \\"property,\\" and the slaves became legally free. During that time, Crockett hired out Polly for domestic servant tasks, and she was known as Polly Crockett. Next he took her up the Missouri River for about five years within the slave state of Missouri. Polly was sold to a Major Taylor Berry in St. Louis, Missouri. She married one of his slaves, said to be a mulatto, and they had two daughters, Nancy and Lucy Ann Berry. (Much of this information came initially from Lucy Ann's memoir From the Darkness Cometh the Light, or, Struggles for Freedom (1891). She had mistakenly said that her mother was born free in Illinois, kidnapped and sold into slavery.) Following the Major's death, his widow Fanny Berry married Robert Wash, one of three Missouri State Supreme Court justices. Fanny Wash died a few years later. Despite Major Berry providing in his will to free his slaves after his and his wife's deaths, Fanny's widower Robert Wash sold Polly's husband to a plantation in the Deep South. The Berry daughters reclaimed Polly Berry (also called Polly Wash at the time, in reference to her master's name) and her daughters from Wash. Fearing another sale, Polly Berry prepared her daughters for escape. While Nancy Berry was accompanying Mary Berry Coxe and her new husband on their honeymoon to Niagara Falls, New York, she fled successfully across the river by ferry to Canada, which had abolished slavery. There she first stayed with a friend of her mother's; she settled in Toronto, where she married and had her own family in freedom. After conflict in the household of Mary Berry Coxe, Polly Berry was sold to Joseph M. Magehan, a lumberman. She escaped in 1839, reaching Chicago before being captured by slave catchers under the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793. They returned her to St. Louis and her master Magehan. She resolved to protect her daughter Lucy Ann, who was 12 years old. Berry/Wash filed a freedom suit in the St. Louis Circuit Court on October 3, 1839, on the basis that, as a child, she had been illegally held as a slave in the free state of Illinois (Polly Wash v. Joseph M. Magehan). Her attorney was Harris Sprout. It was not until 1843 that her case was tried, but she successfully proved her case in court. While the case was pending, Wash was hired out as a laundress to earn money against her upkeep. Her daughter suggested in her memoir that Wash's attorneys proposed the strategy of filing separate suits for her and her daughter, to prevent a jury's worrying about taking too much property from one slaveholder.Wong (2009), p. 135 Martha Berry Mitchell, another of the married daughters of the late Major Berry, claimed the slave girl Lucy Ann Berry as a domestic servant. Angered over the girl's lack of skills with laundry, Mitchell confronted her physically, which Lucy Ann resisted. Martha and her husband David D. Mitchell decided to sell the young slave downriver. (Mitchell was serving in St. Louis as the US regional Superintendent for Indian Affairs.) Before being shipped away, Lucy Ann escaped to a friend of her mother.Wong (2009), p. 141 Polly Berry (then known as Polly Wash) immediately filed suit on September 8, 1842 as a \\"next friend\\" of her daughter against David D. Mitchell. Her own case had not yet been tried, and as a slave she had no individual legal standing, but the law allowed her to file a suit on behalf of her minor daughter. According to the rule of partus sequitur ventrem, which had been adopted into US slave law, the status of children followed that of the mother. Since Lucy Ann was born to a woman considered free at the time in Illinois, she should also have been free. Lucy Ann was remanded to jail, where she was held for 17 months. Unusually, she was not hired out. Wash's attorneys wanted to ensure that Lucy Ann Berry was kept in St. Louis until the trial, but it also appeared that Mitchell enforced her imprisonment. Usually enslaved prisoners were hired out, with the wages given to the owner. On June 6, 1843, Polly Wash was declared a free woman by an all-white jury, on the basis of witnesses who testified she had been held as a slave in Illinois, where the law ruled slaveholders' forfeited their rights to slaves if they stayed voluntarily in the state. This precedent of \\"once free, always free\\" had been set in the 1824 Missouri case of Winny v. Whitesides. Wash's suit for her daughter had yet to be heard. Lucy Ann's case was not heard until February 7 and 8, 1844. Her attorneys argued that Lucy Berry's freedom was based on her birth to a woman who had been proven to be free based on having been held illegally years before in Illinois. Francis Butter Murdoch, the former district attorney for Alton, Illinois, prepared the case. He was highly involved in freedom suits in St. Louis. (He had prosecuted the murder of Elijah Lovejoy in Alton by anti- abolitionists.)Edlie L. Wong, Neither Fugitive nor Free: Atlantic Slavery, Freedom Suits, and the Legal Culture of Travel, New York University Press, 2009, p. 132, accessed 26 January 2011 Wash also gained the aid of the prominent Whig politician Edward Bates. Although a slaveholder, he argued the case in court. He was later appointed as the US Attorney General under President Abraham Lincoln.Eric Gardner, \\"'You have no business to whip me': the freedom suits of Polly Wash and Lucy Ann Delaney\\", African American Review, Spring 2007, accessed 4 January 2011. Note: Murdoch filed almost one- third of the freedom suits filed between 1840 and 1847, all on behalf of enslaved persons. With Wash's case settled by the principle of \\"once free, always free,\\" Bates was able to convince the jury that her daughter Lucy Ann Berry should be considered free as well. As the scholar Eric Gardner writes, > To Batesas to the majority of the Missouri Supreme Court for several years > such a principle actually depended on recognizing and allowing legal > slavery: if an individual African American was not \\"once free\\"through > birth to a free mother, residence, manumission, or other circumstances > carefully specified in state lawthen she or he had no legal right to > demand freedom. This syllogism, of course, explains why Bates could be a > slaveholder and still support Lucy [Berry] Delaney; this premise is why, he > argues by extension, the jury could do the same. The record of the decision said, \\"it is therefore considered by the Court that said Plaintiff be liberated and entirely set free from the Defendant and from all persons claiming by, through, or under him by title derived since the commencement of this suit.\\" Lucy Ann was 14 years old. Wash filed a second suit on behalf of her daughter, for $1000 in damages against David D. Mitchell for false imprisonment. The information in the two case files does not entirely agree with the account in Lucy Delaney's autobiography. By this suit, Wash and Murdoch may have been trying to preclude Mitchell from appealing the court's decision, in addition to seeking reparations. They later dropped the suit without trial. Lives in freedom Polly Berry lived with her daughter Lucy Ann for the rest of her life. At first they worked together as seamstresses. Polly Berry visited her daughter Nancy and grandchildren in Toronto in 1845, and the younger woman offered to settle her there. Berry chose to return to Lucy Ann and her familiar St. Louis roots. She died without seeing her husband again. More than 45 years later, after a life of civic activism, in 1891 Lucy Ann Berry Delaney (then married) published her memoir From the Darkness Cometh the Light, or, Struggles for Freedom. The only first- person account of a freedom suit, it is also considered a slave narrative, recounting the journey to freedom. She told of her mother's struggles to use the courts to gain their freedom. Delaney dedicated the book to the Grand Army of the Republic, which had secured the freedom of slaves throughout the South by its victory in the American Civil War. She described her adult life and activism in a variety of religious and civic organizations. It was not until the 1990s that the Wash and Berry case files were discovered among hundreds of freedom suits . Although some‚Äîsuch as the Dred and Harriet Scott files‚Äîhad been set aside, most freedom suits were filed by case number together with all the other circuit court case files; surviving indices generally listed them under the broad rubric of \\"trespass.\\" Some early suits had been filed against the leading families of St. Louis, such as Chouteau, Cabann√©, Sarpy, and Papin, who were slaveholders before and after the Louisiana Purchase. Under the St. Louis Circuit Court Historical Records Project, the case files are available to scholars for research, and a searchable database with digitized images of each case file is online.

The Corton vineyards on this side of the hill are located in Aloxe-Corton. Corton is an Appellation d'origine contr√¥l√©e (AOC) and Grand Cru vineyard for red and white wine in C√¥te de Beaune subregion of Burgundy. It is located on a hill shared between the three villages of Aloxe-Corton, Pernand-Vergelesses and Ladoix in the C√¥te de Beaune, Burgundy. The appellation covers the lower parts of the Corton hill and includes several subordinate vineyard names, or climats, within the AOC. Because of the size of the AOC and the variability of these climats, it is the rule rather than the exception that the name of the climat is indicated together with that of the Corton AOC, leading to designations such as Corton Clos du Roi and Corton Les Bressandes. Corton is rare in this aspect, as the 'climat' is seldom used for other Grand Cru appellations in C√¥te d'Or. The AOC was created in 1937. Corton wines are mostly red (around 95 per cent of the total production in the AOC) and made from the Pinot noir grape, however a smaller quantity of white Corton from Chardonnay is also produced. Around 500,000 bottles a year are produced from the vines. The Corton appellation itself is the C√¥te de Beaune's only Grand Cru appellation for red wine, and is the largest Grand Cru of Burgundy. Production A view over Pernand- Vergelesses and surrounding vineyards, with the Corton hill on the left side. In 2008, of vineyard surface was in production within the AOC, and 2,984 hectoliter of wine was produced, of which 2,822 hectoliter red and 162 hectoliter white.BIVB: Les Appellations d‚ÄôOrigine Contr√¥l√©e de Bourgogne, accessed on October 30, 2009 This corresponds to just under 400,000 bottles, of which just over 21,000 were white Corton. Producers Corton wine from the Les Mar√©chaudes climat. As with most Burgundy vineyards, several different producers own parts of the vineyard and produce and sell their own finished wines, or sell their grapes or wines to n√©gociant-√©leveurs for vinification or bottling and distribution. Corton, Corton-Charlemagne and Charlemagne There are three partially overlapping Grand Cru AOCs that cover the vineyards on the Corton hill; Corton for red and white wine, Corton-Charlemagne for white wine, and the little used Charlemagne for white wine.

A traditional Lucky Bag has a collection of photos taken around the academy and photographs of each graduating officer along with a single paragraph describing the individual written by a friend. While no one knows for sure, it is speculated that it is named after the \\"lucky bag\\" that contains the possessions of sailors who lost items at sea. Each year every midshipman and graduating officer receives a Lucky Bag, and every edition of the Lucky Bag is archived by both the Naval Academy and the United States Naval Academy Alumni Association. History Every man-of-war, you know, has her Lucky Bag, containing a little of every thing, and something belonging to every body. For variety of contents, a regular Lucky Bag may vie with the caldron that witches boil and bubble ‚Äúat the pit of Acheron.‚Äù : horse of middy and waister‚Äôs sock, : dresses of a cat mouse game : Purser‚Äôs slops and topman‚Äôs hat, : Boatswain‚Äôs call and colt and cat, : Belt that on the berth-deck lay, : In the Lucky Bag find their way; : Gaiter, stock and red pompoon, : Sailor‚Äôs pan, his pot and spoon, : Shirt of cook and trowser‚Äôs duck, : Kid and can and ‚Äúdoctor‚Äôs truck,‚Äù : And all that‚Äôs lost, and found on board, : In the Lucky Bag is always stored.'' ‚ÄúThis bag,‚Äù Mr. Editor, which I am about to overhaul, has been open for fifteen or twenty years.

Matthew Fontaine Maury, U.S.Navy. Matthew Fontaine Maury, USN, used the term \\"Lucky Bag\\", and defined it, long before the United States Naval Academy was created. Matthew Maury wrote many articles about the \\"Lucky Bag\\" and called the articles, \\"Scraps From The Lucky Bag\\". It was information on Naval reform in all its venues and more. This is well known by serious historians. The use of term goes back further than 1820 in the United States Navy and back to the British Navy. Read the link to see a typical \\"Lucky Bag Scrap\\" on US Naval Reform. The United States Naval Academy, to a huge extent, was created due to Matthew Maury's \\"Scraps From The Lucky Bag\\" that were published under noms de plumes in newspapers, copied, and passed around in flyers in and outside of the USN to stir people to action for changes in the Navy and transcribed by William Maury Morris for these modern times. The lucky bag is also defined as a where loose items from a ship are stored until being returned to the owner. According to the 1940 edition of The Bluejacket's Manual (a handbook for U.S. Navy enlisted personnel), \\"The lucky bag is a place where the police petty officers stow for safe-keeping effects that are found adrift about the ship. All clothes, etc., found about the decks are placed in the lucky bag. When clothes are piped down, the police petty officer attends and takes care of all clothes not called for and places these in the lucky bag. All effects in this bag belong to the person who lost them. At frequent intervals the lucky bag is opened and the effects distributed to the owners. Where persons have been guilty of carelessness in leaving their effects adrift, they are placed on the report.\\" According to the log of the USS Yosemite, on June 24, 1898 several sailors were given 72 hours extra duty for having an article in the lucky bag.

Steamboat Origins Louisiana was built at Wilmington, Delaware, in 1860 by the Harlan & Hollingsworth Iron Shipbuilding Company. Its first owners were S & J.M. Flanagan of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It was purchased by the Navy at Philadelphia 10 July 1861; and commissioned in August 1861, Lieutenant Alexander Murray in command. Combat Service Assigned to the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron, until January 1862 Louisiana operated along the Virginia coast, blocking the passage of Confederate blockade runners, and attacking them at their bases. The Louisiana also participated in operations like the battle for Roanoke Island on 7‚Äì8 February 1862 and the Battle of Elizabeth City on 10 February, which denied the use of coastal inlets and seaboard towns to the blockade runners and tied down Confederate troops to guard those bases which could be held. On 13 September 1861, with , Louisiana engaged CSS Patrick Henry off Newport News, Virginia, but shot from both sides fell short. Two of her boats destroyed a schooner fitting out as a Confederate privateer in the Battle of Cockle Creek near Chincoteague Inlet 5 October, and two days later she captured schooner S. T. Carrison with a cargo of wood near Wallops Island. Chincoteague Island was lost to the Confederacy as a base when on 14 October Louisiana's Lt. Murray witnessed the administration of the oath of allegiance to the United States to Chincoteague's citizens. Her boats, led by Lt. Alfred Hopkins, surprised and burned three Confederate vessels at Chincoteague Inlet 28 and 29 October. Service in North Carolina On 2 January 1862, Louisiana was ordered to Hatteras Inlet to prepare for the invasion of the Carolina Sounds. For the next three years, she patrolled, supported Army troops and made raids along the many miles of the intricate water system whose eventual capture would be a mortal blow to the Confederacy. Typical of such actions was that of 6 September 1862, when she tried to aid Union troops repelling Confederate attacks on Washington, North Carolina. Their commander, Major General John G. Poster, reported that Louisiana \\"had rendered most efficient aid, throwing her shells with great precision, and clearing the streets, through which her guns had range.\\" She captured schooner Alice L. Webb at Rose Bay, North Carolina, 5 November 1862, then joined in the Army-Navy expedition which captured Greenville, North Carolina, four days later. On 20 May 1863, one of her boatcrews under Acting Master's Mate Charles W. Fisher, captured a still unrigged schooner in the Tar River north of Washington, N.C. The prize was named for Louisiana's captain, Richard T. Renshaw, and taken into the Navy as an ordnance hulk. The \\"Powder Ship\\" Fort Fisher, guarding Wilmington, North Carolina, was the key to the base which northern commanders foresaw the South employing after the fall of Charleston, and Commodore David Dixon Porter and Maj. Gen. Benjamin Butler, knowing that an assault on so powerful a defense would be long and costly, hoped to reduce it by blowing up an explosive laden ship under its walls. On 26 November 1864 contrary to naval ordnance experts' advice, Louisiana was designated for this assignment, and early in December she proceeded to Hampton Roads to be partially stripped and laden with explosives. She left Hampton Roads 13 December in tow of for Beaufort, North Carolina, where the loading of powder was completed, and five days later arrived off Fort Fisher. Here took up the tow, and Commander Alexander Rhind with a volunteer crew prepared for the attack. Wilderness and Louisiana continued toward Fort Fisher, but were turned back by the heavy swells which with worsening weather delayed the entire amphibious attack in leaving its base at Beaufort. The final attempt was made on 23 December, when Wilderness brought Louisiana into position under Fort Fisher late in the evening. Rhind and his crew lit the fuses and kindled a fire aft, then escaped in small boats to Wilderness. waiting anxiously for 01:18 24 December, when the fuses were timed to explode. They failed, but the fire set aft worked its way from the stern to the powder and blew Louisiana up as planned, but with little effect. Several weeks later, the massed gunfire of the fleet and amphibious assault reduced the last great bastion of the Carolina Sounds. The Wreck In 1994 state underwater archaeologists and students from East Carolina University conducted a survey of the area off Fort Fisher. Though many Civil War era wrecks were mapped, no remains were found that could be associated with that of the Louisiana.

It rises in the Alps and empties about later into the Brenta River near Chioggia. It flows through and past a number of cities, including Vicenza and Padua. It acted for many centuries as a significant waterway up to Vicenza, above which it ceases to be navigable. It was connected in the 19th century to the Adige by a canal. Course Route of the Rivers Bacchiglione, Brenta, and Muson. The river starts in some springs in the towns of Dueville and Villaverla, in the province of Vicenza. Here it is called \\"Bacchiglioncello\\". Just upstream of the city of Vicenza receives water from the Leogra Timonchio (which descends from Mount Pasubio). At this junction, the river becomes the Bacchiglione. At Ponte del Bo, above Vicenza, it joins with the Orolo. In Vicenza, the Bacchiglione is joined by the rivers Tesina, Retrone and Astichello. The river is about long and has a basin of . The average flow of the Bacchiglione in Padua is about 30 m3/s and flows through the summer dry season. 1789 map Bisatto Canal At Longare, the Bisatto (or \\"Bisato\\") Canal was built in the twelfth century. Verona and Vicenza built it to divert water away from Padua during the many political struggles of the time, as told in the ninth canto of Dante's \\"Paradiso\\". The channel goes to Lozzo Atestino and Este; then continues to Monselice (\\"Este - Montelice Canal\\").

Brentella Canal The Brentella Canal originates from the Brenta River in Limena, where the flow is regulated by a hydraulic barrier (the \\"Colmelloni\\"), and joins the Bacchiglione just before Padua's airport. The Brentella Canal was built in 1314 Padua to prevent the city of Vicenza from stopping the river when it created the Bisatto Canal.

He began his career as a child actor in silent films, progressed to lead roles and co-starring roles in adventure, western, dramatic, and comedy films, and later became a character actor and voice-over artist. He is perhaps best known for his role as Lampwick, the unlucky boy who turns into a donkey in Walt Disney's second animated feature, Pinocchio (1940). In early credits, his last name was spelled Darrow. Early life Frankie Darro was born on Saturday, December 22, 1917, in Chicago, Illinois, as Frank Johnson, Jr. His parents, Frank Johnson, Sr. and his wife Ada, were known as The Flying Johnsons, a flying circus act with the Sells Floto Circus; it was a profession that his father attempted to train him in, and he cured Frankie's fear of heights by having him walk on a length of wire, gradually raising the height of it until his son had mastered the trick. In 1922, while the circus was in California, his parents divorced, and their circus act ended along with their marriage. The growing film industry, however, found a use for a small child who could do his own stunts, and the young Johnson, renamed \\"Frankie Darro,\\" appeared in his first film at the age of six.Frankie Darro biography at (re)Search my Trash, retrieved 28 May 2007 Acting career As a child actor, he appeared in many silent adventure, western, and serial pictures of the 1920s. His visual appeal and his obvious comfort before the cameras kept him steadily employed. Darro remained popular in serials as the star or co-star; he appeared in the serial The Phantom Empire, opposite the new cowboy star Gene Autry. Darro was featured in Mervyn LeRoy's Three on a Match in 1932 and was the principal character in the James Cagney feature The Mayor of Hell (1933). His most important role during the 1930s was as the lead in Wild Boys of the Road, director William Wellman's indictment of teens vagabonding across America during the Depression. From then on, Frankie Darro was usually cast as pint- sized tough guys, although he also played wholesome leads in mysteries and comedies. Darro's name grew in stature, but he himself didn't: he stood only five feet, three inches, limiting his potential as a leading man. His wiry, athletic frame and relatively short stature often typecast him as jockeys; Darro played crooked riders in Charlie Chan at the Race Track and A Day at the Races. In 1938 Darro joined Monogram Pictures to star in a series of action melodramas. Darro's flair for comedy gradually increased the laugh content in these films, and by 1940 Mantan Moreland was hired to play his sidekick. The Frankie Darro series was so successful that Monogram used it as a haven for performers whose own series had been discontinued: Jackie Moran, Marcia Mae Jones, and Keye Luke joined Darro and Moreland in 1940, and Gale Storm was added in 1941. Darro served in the US Navy Hospital Corps during World War II, wherein he contracted malaria. Upon his return to civilian life, Monogram welcomed him back and cast the perennially youthful Darro in its The Teen Agers campus comedies. When that series ended, the studio gave Darro four featured roles in its popular Bowery Boys comedies. Darro's last assignment for Monogram, in 1950, was doubling for Leo Gorcey in Blues Busters. Later life Darro's recurring malaria symptoms caused him to increase his alcohol intake for pain management, and this affected his career. As film and TV roles became fewer, Darro opened his own tavern, naming it \\"Try Later\\" after the answer he most often received when he asked Central Casting for work. His new occupation proved unwise, however, given his heavy drinking. By the mid-1950s, he had become too risky for producers to hire steadily. No longer starring in films, Darro accepted smaller roles and did stunt work for other actors in various films. Frankie Darro is probably best known to modern audiences for two films in which he isn't even seen: Walt Disney's Pinocchio (1940, as the voice of Lampwick) and Forbidden Planet (1956, as one of the actor/operators inside the now iconic 7-foot-tall \\"Robby the Robot\\").Weaver, Tom Robert Dix Interview Earth Vs. The Sci-Fi Filmmakers: 20 Interviews, p. 72, McFarland, July 30, 2005. Darro did continue to play small parts well into the 1960s, mostly on television: The Red Skelton Show, Bat Masterson, Have GunWill Travel, The Untouchables, Alfred Hitchcock Presents, The Addams Family, and Batman (episodes 9 and 10); he also did voice-over work for various projects. Death While visiting an ex-wife and his step-daughter Christy in Huntington Beach, California, Darro died of a heart attack on Christmas Day 1976, three days after his 59th birthday. His remains were cremated and his ashes were scattered into the Pacific Ocean.

Service Chichester was first commissioned in 1958 and in that year rescued crew of the coaster Concha off Milford Haven before the ship sank. The commission took her through the Mediterranean to the Far East returning via South Africa and South America. In 1963/4 she was refitted in Chatham with macks (masts and stacks) along with type 965 & 993 radar. In 1968 she deployed for Fishery Protection duties and was accused by the Soviet Union of spying on Soviet naval exercises. HMS Chichester at Hong Kong in 1973 (IWM) Towards the end of her career, in 1971 the Type 61 frigate was refitted as a Hong Kong guard ship, to replace an ageing Type 12 frigate, due in part to her good range conferred by her diesel machinery. Her radar fit was reduced to radar 978, 993M and the 275, Mk 6 director for the twin 4.5 and a more suitable light arms for patrol off Hong Kong of a 2 single 20mm guns and a 1 X 40mm Bofors. The election of the Labour Government in 1974 saw a further reduction of naval forces, east of Suez with the frigate being supplemented by five Ton Class minesweepers converted for Patrol duties, as the largest vessels maintaining a presence for protection of British interests. Chichester left Hong Kong in the spring of 1976 to return to the UK. Following decommissioning Chichester arrived for scrapping at Queenborough on 17 March 1981.

It was first established as a repertory theatre in 1948 when it operated from a former cinema in Goldsmith Street. Directors during this period included Val May and Frank Dunlop.A theatre for all seasons: Nottingham Playhouse : the first thirty years 1948-1978 John Bailey, Nottingham Playhouse. 1994 The current building opened in 1963. The building The architect of the current theatre, constructed as an example of Modern architecture, was Peter Moro who had worked on the interior design of the Royal Festival Hall in London. When the theatre was completed, it was controversial as it faces the gothic revival Roman Catholic cathedral designed by Augustus Pugin. However, the buildings received a Civic Trust Award in 1965.Britain. Peter Murray, Stephen Trombley. Architecture Design and Technology Press, 1990 Despite the modern external appearance and the circular auditorium walls, the theatre has a proscenium layout, seating an audience of 770. During the 1980s, when the concrete interiors were out of fashion, the Playhouse suffered from insensitive \\"refurbishment\\" that sought to hide its character. Since 1996, it has been a Grade II* listed building and in 2004, the theatre was sympathetically restored and refurbished with a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund.

In 2014-15 Nottingham Playhouse underwent a complete environmental upgrade including insulation of the fly tower, secondary and double glazing and installing PV panels. The works were jointly funded by Arts Council England, Nottingham City Council, patron donations and philanthropist Sir Harry Djanogly. The award-winning works have been calculated to cut annual energy usage by over 35%. Performance history Aladdin Pantomime in 2008 The new theatre's artistic direction was shared between Frank Dunlop and actor John Neville with Peter Ustinov as associate.Michael Coveney Obituary: John Neville, The Guardian, 21 November 2011 The first production in the new theatre was Shakespeare's Coriolanus in a production by Tyrone Guthrie. This included a young Ian McKellen as Tullus Aufidius opposite Neville in the title role. Subsequent artistic directors were Stuart Burge, Richard Eyre, Geoffrey Reeves, Richard Digby Day, Kenneth Alan Taylor, Pip Broughton and Martin Duncan. The Playhouse is currently under the leadership of Stephanie Sirr, Chief Executive and Giles Croft, Artistic Director. In Spring 2017 it was announced that Adam Penford would succeed Croft as Artistic Director from September 2017. Nottingham Playhouse has a strong tradition of new works for children, both in the form of original writing and more recently in the form of classic pantomimes conceived by former artistic director Kenneth Alan Taylor. Taylor has directed 34 consecutive pantomimes at the theatre as of 2013. In common with most producing theatres, Nottingham Playhouse no longer has a repertory approach to programming although it continues to create up to 13 new productions per annum. Its recent plays include Old Big 'Ead in the Spirit of the Man, a homage to Nottingham legend Brian Clough, Rat Pack Confidential and Summer and Smoke, which both transferred to the West End and The Burial at Thebes which was part of the Barbican BITE season of autumn 2007 and toured the US in 2008.

They are part of Amtrak's Illinois Service and are primarily funded by the state of Illinois. The route is coextensive with the far northern leg of the long-distance City of New Orleans. The Illini has operated since 1973; a previous version operated in 1971‚Äì1972 between Chicago and Champaign. The Saluki debuted in 2006.  History  station in Decatur, once served by the Illini. The Illini in Gilman in 1989 The Illinois Central Railroad's main line between Chicago and New Orleans ran through Champaign‚ÄìUrbana and Carbondale, along the east side of Illinois. At the formation of Amtrak in 1971, the Illinois Central still operated a number of services from its Central Station in Chicago over this route, including the Illini and Shawnee (Chicago-Carbondale), the City of New Orleans and the Panama Limited (both, Chicago‚ÄìNew Orleans), plus the City of Miami (Chicago‚ÄìBirmingham). Amtrak retained two trains on this route: the City of New Orleans (which it named the Panama Limited) and the Shawnee. Amtrak brought back the Illini name on November 14, 1971, as a Chicago-Champaign train, operating in conjunction with the Campus. It was named for the Illini, from which the state of Illinois and the Fighting Illini mascot of the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign get their names. Amtrak discontinued the Campus and Illini on March 5, 1972. Both trains used Central Station, which Amtrak was abandoning; Amtrak judged that the additional 35‚Äì40 minutes necessary to serve Union Station made the schedule impractical. The 1972 Illini made its last trip on March 3. Amtrak revived the Illini on December 19, 1973, again as a Chicago‚ÄìChampaign service. The restoration was part of $1.5 million expansion program which included the Black Hawk (Chicago‚ÄìRockford‚ÄìDubuque), the State House (St. Louis‚ÄìChicago), and supplemental funding for the Rock Island's two remaining Rockets (Chicago‚ÄìPeoria and Chicago‚ÄìRock Island). The state desired to extend the Illini to Decatur, but doing so involved a switch from the Illinois Central to the Norfolk & Western at Tolono, south of Champaign. The connection between the lines was in poor condition, and no one would take responsibility for repairing it. Amtrak finally extended the Illini to Decatur on July 2, 1981. Decatur had last seen service in 1971 from the Norfolk & Western's City of Decatur (Chicago‚ÄìDecatur) and the Wabash's Wabash Cannon Ball (Detroit‚ÄìSt. Louis). Neither train had been retained by Amtrak. The new Amtrak service used the old Wabash station, which still stands and has become an antique store. Poor ridership prompted Illinois to withdraw its support for the Decatur stop, and Amtrak cut the Illini back to Champaign on July 10, 1983. On January 12, 1986, Amtrak extended the Illini to Carbondale to replace the Shawnee, which had been canceled because of budget cuts. Service began at Gilman on October 26, 1986 and Du Quoin on August 25, 1989. The Illini service was nearly canceled in 1996, but local communities along the route pledged funds to keep it running. A second train, the Saluki, was added on October 30, 2006, in response to increased demand on the Illini and other Illinois Service trains in the 2005‚Äì2006 fiscal year. The Saluki was named for the mascot of Southern Illinois University, which is located in the train's southern terminus of Carbondale. Its daytime schedule complements the afternoon schedule of the Illini. Amtrak ran an extra over the route, the Eclipse Express, for the solar eclipse of August 21, 2017. The trains have stops near three major Illinois state universities: University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Southern Illinois University, and Eastern Illinois University in Charleston (near Mattoon). As a result, university students account for a significant portion of passengers.  Route  Route of the Illini and Saluki The Illini and Saluki operates over the Canadian National Railway, successor to the Illinois Central. The route is long. The Chicago Region Environmental and Transportation Efficiency Program (CREATE) is in the preliminary design phase for the Grand Crossing Project. This project will reroute the Illini, Saluki, and City of New Orleans trains from Canadian National Railway's tracks to Norfolk Southern's Chicago Line in the Greater Grand Crossing neighborhood in Chicago.

The song appeared on the band's first full-length studio album, Surfer Rosa, released in 1988. One of the longest songs on the album, \\"Gigantic\\" was released as the band's first single later that year. Featuring Deal on lead vocals, the song is one of Pixies' biggest hits and a crowd favorite at concerts, often played as the encore. The melody line comes from Deal's simple but effective bass playing‚Äîthe same bassline is repeated throughout the song. \\"Gigantic\\" never achieved a ranking on any major charts and was their only release from Surfer Rosa. However, it was a fairly successful first hit for Pixies and maintains radio play to this day. The single version of the song appeared on Pixies' 2004 best-of compilation, Wave of Mutilation: Best of Pixies. Lyrics and melody According to Deal, the main inspiration for the song was the film Crimes of the Heart, in which a white married woman falls in love with a black teenager and the song \\"Gigantic\\" is credited to Mrs John Murphy (Kim Deal's pseudonym at the time of Come On Pilgrim and Surfer Rosa). The song's voyeuristic lyrics mostly revolve around a woman's observation of an attractive black man making love to another woman, culminating in the oddly light-hearted but sexual chorus: \\"Gigantic, gigantic, gigantic / A big, big love\\". Francis later commented on the title of the song and the chorus (in the music magazine SELECT), saying: > \\"A good chord progression, very Lou Reed influenced. I'd had the word > 'gigantic' in my mind just because the chord progression seemed very big to > me.\\" The melody, particularly at the beginning, differs between the album and EP version. Single 4AD label executive Ivo Watts-Russell didn't believe there was a track on Surfer Rosa that would get much radio play, so he approached producer Gil Norton to re-record \\"Gigantic\\" and \\"River Euphrates\\" with the intention of releasing them as the band's first single. It would be the first time Norton would record with the Pixies, and the circumstances made him a bit nervous because he was a fan of the band and Steve Albini's work. Frank, Josh; Ganz, Caryn (2005). Fool the World: The Oral History of a Band Called Pixies. St. Martin's Press. , p. 128 Most of the changes he made would be in the way the recordings were mixed while minor alterations were made in \\"Gigantic\\"'s arrangement. The single was released in the United Kingdom on 4AD as a 12-inch Vinyl Record and on CD. The CD version was re-issued in 1999. (No version of this single was ever released in the United States.) The single would also include a live version of \\"Vamos\\" (a song that also appeared on mini-LP, Come On Pilgrim and their first LP Surfer Rosa) and a live cover of the song \\"In Heaven (The Lady in The Radiator Song)\\" from the David Lynch movie Eraserhead, both recorded at the Town and Country Club in London. Discogs - Gigantic / River Euphrates CD-single 1988-August-22nd 4AD (bad 805cd) UK Based on the results of this re-recording, Gil Norton would be asked to produce the next album, Doolittle. The back cover of the 12 inch features a large leather glove. Track listing Cover versions *In 1990, the Australian alternative rock band Tlot Tlot wrote a song called \\"Sunny Delirious\\" that sampled the intro of \\"Gigantic\\". In 1992, their debut album Pistolbuttsa'twinkle included the song, while their final single, \\"The Girlfriend Song\\", included an uptempo punk version of the song recorded live as a B-side. *The California ska punk band Reel Big Fish produced a cover of \\"Gigantic\\" for 1999's Where Is My Mind?: A Tribute to the Pixies. Reel Big Fish chose to break away from their traditional sound for this cover, producing a very poppy, highly produced dance track sounding nothing like the original song. Other bands such as Belle & Sebastian, The Frames, Pavement, Gemma Hayes, The Katies, and The Hippos have also covered the song. *The song was parodied by Self on the album Feels Like Breakin' Shit with a track titled \\"Titanic\\".

Like ultimate, the object of the game is to score points by passing the disc into the end zone; however, in Hot Box there is generally only one end zone and it is of much smaller size than an Ultimate end zone. In this way, hot box is a \\"half- court\\" variant of ultimate. Because of these reduced requirements, it is often played when not enough players are available to play ultimate. Rules For the most part, hot box follows the rules of play of ultimate. The major differences are: * Team size: Box is usually played with two teams of two to four playershttp://www.lincolnultimate.com/variations-of-ultimate.html. * Field of play: Box is played on a square field of approximately 40 yards on a side. A single square end zone, approximately five feet on a side, forms the center of the field. Each square is marked with four cones on the corners. * Turnovers: There is no out-of-bounds in box. If the disc is turned over (dropped, intercepted, etc.) inside the outer square, the team which is now on offense must clear the disc by completing a pass outside the outer box before they may score a goal. * Goals: When a goal is scored, the scoring team retains possession. They must clear the disc before they may score again. It is customary for there to be a stoppage of play when a goal is scored, but in some circles the scoring team may immediately continue play. * No Fouls: Unlike ultimate, box is usually played more like pickup basketball, with some amount of physical contact allowed in and around the box area. Normal fouls & violations in ultimate (picks, strips, travel, contact) are typically not called. Some games of box also allow for intentional strips, and hard (though still usually friendly) contact. Variants Many variations on the rules of hot box exist. Common variants include changing the dimensions of the field, using a circle instead of a square for the clear line, a stall count of 5 or 7 (instead of 10), and a \\"no poaching\\" clause which prevents defenders from guarding the endzone instead of their assigned player. Some variant games also exist. Double box involves a short rectangular field with two small end zones rather than one; there is no clearing line, but when a team gains possession of the disc after a turnover they must attack the end zone that their opponents were not. A variant originated in Washington, DC, Boot-Box, combines Double box with the cone hitting game, Durango Boot. Two end zones are formed with a square of four cones. Before scoring a team must complete a pass across a mid line. They can then score at either end zone. One point is scored for each cone knocked over. Catching a disc and landing in an end zone scores 3 points. Games are played to 15. Invalidimate was developed in the UK as a way to include injured players in practice; the \\"invalid\\" stands in the goal and is the target receiver for both teams. Two invalids can also be used in double box, with the additional rule that every player on a team must touch the disc (including the defensive invalid) before the offensive invalid can catch a scoring throw. A drinking variation called Beer Box was invented at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, OH. Beer Box is similar to the original half-court Box with one larger square and an inner, smaller endzone square, but this game also includes drinking cans of alcohol throughout the course of the game. For setup, the outer square is 15 yards wide on each side and the inner endzone square is 2 yard on each side. For each outer cone, a can of alcohol is placed underneath. Once any player with the disc is within reach of an outer cone, play is paused momentarily as said player is allowed to drink for 3 counts. After 3 counts, the can is placed back under the cone and play resumes. If the offensive player finishes the can at any point during the game, the marking defender must remove themselves from the game and complete a task, creating a power play for the offensive team. Once the marking defender performs a task by the designated Task Master and replaces the empty can with a brand new one, that player may enter the field of play. Similar to standard box, a goal is scored once the offensive team caught a pass in the endzone. However, once a goal is scored, play is paused while the defender guarding the scoring receiver must drink for 10 counts from the designated side beer area.\\"Fighting Gobies History\\" References Category:Team sports Category:Flying disc games ","title":"Hot box (game)"},{"id":"1972933","text":"Portchester Castle, where the Southampton plot was revealed to King Henry V Henry Scrope, 3rd Baron Scrope of Masham KG (c. 1373 ‚Äì 5 August 1415) was a favourite of Henry V, who performed many diplomatic missions. He was beheaded for his involvement in the notional Southampton Plot to assassinate the king. Some historians believe that the charge was trumped-up to punish him for other acts of disloyalty, and that there may never have been such a plot. Family Henry Scrope, born about 1373, was the eldest son and heir of Stephen Scrope (c.1345 ‚Äì 25 January 1406), 2nd Baron Scrope of Masham, and Margery Welles, widow of John de Huntingfield. He had four brothers, and one sister:. * Sir Geoffrey Scrope * Stephen Scrope, Archdeacon of Richmond, Chancellor of Cambridge * John Scrope, 4th Baron Scrope of Masham * William Scrope, Archdeacon of Durham * Maud Scrope, who married Baldwin Freville Career In 1390 Scrope accompanied John Beaufort, half-brother of the future King Henry IV, on the Barbary Crusade to Mahdia, but otherwise little is known of his early life.; . An annuity granted to him by King Richard II was continued by Henry IV after Richard's deposition, and in 1403 Scrope was styled 'king's knight', and fought on Henry IV's side at the Battle of Shrewsbury. His uncle, Richard Scrope, Archbishop of York, was executed on 8 June 1405 for taking part in the Northern Rising against the King;. however Henry Scrope was not involved in his uncle's failed rebellion, and was serving the King in Wales when he inherited his father's title and lands in 1406. In 1408 he accompanied Henry IV's daughter, Philippa, to Denmark for her marriage, and in 1409 went to Paris on a diplomatic mission with Henry IV's half-brother, Henry Beaufort.. According to Tait, it was during this period that Scrope came to enjoy the friendship and confidence of the future Henry V, by whose influence he was appointed Treasurer of England in 1410, and made a Knight of the Garter in the same year.. Henry V succeeded his father in 1413, and in 1413 Scrope was sent on several diplomatic missions. In 1414 he accompanied Bishop Henry Chichele to Burgundy to negotiate an alliance.. Southampton Plot In 1415 Henry V determined to invade France, and in February 1415 Scrope attended a council meeting held for the purpose of planning the forthcoming expedition. However, on 27 May 1415 Scrope was absent from the council meeting for no apparent reason. On 31 July Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March informed King Henry that he had just become aware of a plot to murder Henry and put himself on the throne. Mortimer was the great-grandson of Lionel of Antwerp, Duke of Clarence, second surviving son of King Edward III, and his claim to the throne was thus superior to that of Henry V and his father, Henry IV, who derived their claim from Henry IV's father, John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, third surviving son of Edward III. Moreover, Edmund Mortimer's father, Roger Mortimer, 4th Earl of March, had been widely considered heir presumptive to King Richard II, who had no issue, and Edmund Mortimer himself had been heir presumptive to Richard II while a young child.; . The three ringleaders of the plot were Edmund Mortimer's brother-in-law (and Scrope's wife Joan's stepson), Richard of Conisburgh, Earl of Cambridge, Sir Thomas Grey, whose son, Thomas, had been betrothed in 1412 to Cambridge's only daughter, Isabel; . and Scrope himself. Richard, Scrope, and Grey were promptly arrested. The trial took place in Southampton, on the site now occupied by the Red Lion Inn. Grey was beheaded on 2 August 1415. The most degrading punishment was reserved for Scrope, perhaps because he had been a royal favourite. Prior to his execution, Scrope was dragged across Southampton from the Watergate to the north gate, where he and Cambridge were beheaded on 5 August 1415. Scrope's head was sent to York, to be put on a spike on Micklegate Bar. Scrope's involvement in the conspiracy surprised contemporaries, and continues to puzzle historians. Ian Mortimer claims Scrope had merely insinuated himself into the confidence of Cambridge and Grey in order to betray the conspiracy, just as Edward, Duke of York had done with the Epiphany Rising in 1400, but was forestalled by Edmund Mortimer's revelation of the conspiracy to the King on 31 July. Pugh, however, finds Scrope's exculpatory statements at trial unconvincing, and states that Scrope never pretended that he had intended to inform the King of the conspiracy.. Pugh also contends that \\"there was no plot in 1415 to assassinate Henry V and his three brothers and that heinous charge, by far the most sensational in the indictment, was fabricated to ensure that Cambridge, Grey and Scrope did not escape the death penalty as a well-deserved punishment for the various other offences that they undoubtedly had committed\\".. The Southampton Plot is dramatized in Shakespeare's Henry V, and in the anonymous play, The History of Sir John Oldcastle. Marriages Scrope married firstly, before 5 February 1398, Philippe Bryan (d. 19 November 1406), the widow of Sir John Devereux (d. 13 November 1396), and daughter and co-heiress of Guy de Bryan, 1st Baron Bryan.. He married secondly, by licence dated 6 September 1410, Lady Joan Holland (d.1434), the daughter of Thomas Holland, 2nd Earl of Kent, and Alice FitzAlan, and widow firstly of Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York, and secondly, William Willoughby, 5th Lord Willoughby. Joan's paternal grandparents were Thomas Holland, 1st Earl of Kent, and Joan of Kent, mother of King Richard II by her second marriage to Edward, the Black Prince. Joan's father was thus a halfbrother of King Richard II. Joan was the sister of Eleanor Holland, Countess of March, mother of Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March, who was the focus of the Southampton Plot.; . After Scrope's death. Joan married fourthly, Henry Bromflete, Baron Vescy. Scrope had no issue by either of his wives, and was succeeded by his brother, John Scrope, 4th Baron Scrope of Masham, who did not recover the forfeited Scrope lands until 1442.

Super-Rabbit was the 16th Bugs Bunny entry, and the 47th directed by Chuck Jones.  Plot  Professor Cannafraz (a Richard Haydn impression) creates a \\"super carrot\\" and uses it on his test subject ‚Äì Rabbitus idioticus americanus (Bugs Bunny), who immediately wolfs down the proffered carrot. Armed with temporary superhero abilities that need to be replenished with additional super carrots, Bugs remembers a newspaper article about Texas hunter \\"Cottontail\\" Smith, who wants to hunt down all rabbits. Bugs flies to Deepinaharta, Texas, and assumes the moniker of a mild-mannered forest creature, complete with oversized glasses and hat. He encounters Smith, who attempts to shoot Bugs, only for the bullets to form an outline of Bugs before harmlessly falling to the ground. Bugs then hands Smith a cannon, eats another carrot then, upon being struck by the cannonball, plays basketball with it, quickly shoving Smith and his horse onto bleachers while he acts as his own cheerleader. After Bugs returns to the air, the bemused Smith and his horse fly into the sky with their own airplane. Bugs then snatches the shell of the plane away from them, plunging them to the ground. Bugs runs out of power, but when he tries to recharge again, his carrots fall to the ground. When Bugs lands, he opens his eyes to see a line of chewed-up carrots eaten by Smith and his horse-turned-Superhero. Bugs turns to the camera and says \\"This looks like a job for a REAL Superman!\\" He ducks into a phone booth. Both Smith and the horse are ready to attack - until the booth opens and they both snap to attention and salute. Bugs marches out in a Marine uniform, singing the \\"Marines' Hymn.\\" He dismisses the two, claiming he has \\"important work to do!\\", and marches off to \\"Berlin, Tokyo and points East.\\"Shull, Wilt (2004), p. 157  Credits  * Distributor: Warner Brothers * Producer: Leon Schlesinger * Supervision: Chuck Jones * Story: Tedd Pierce * Animation: Ken Harris Robert Cannon (uncredited) Ben Washam (uncredited) * Musical Direction: Carl Stalling  Cast  * Mel Blanc as Bugs Bunny, Cottontail Smith, Texas rabbit * Tedd Pierce as Observer * Kent Rogers as Professor Canafrazz  Reception  The U.S. Marine Corps were so thrilled that Bugs Bunny decided to become a Marine in this cartoon that they insisted the character be officially inducted into the force as a private, which was done, complete with dogtags.

Life He was born in Midlothian on 8 June 1778.https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf He was the second son of Alexander Murray, Lord Henderland, Lord of Session and Justiciary. His mother was Katherine Lindsay, daughter of Sir Alexander Lindsay of Evelick, Perthshire, and a niece of the first Lord Mansfield. His brother was William Murray of Henderland FRSE. Murray was educated successively at the Edinburgh High School, at Westminster School, and at the University of Edinburgh. At Edinburgh he was a member of the Juvenile Literary Society, of which Henry Brougham and Francis Horner were the leading spirits, and of the Speculative Society. He corresponded with Horner, till the latter's death in 1817, and his letters form a major part of the Memoirs of Horner, 1843. In 1799, Murray passed to the Scottish bar. When the Edinburgh Review was founded, Sydney Smith, Horner, Francis Jeffrey, Thomas, and he, met for a time as joint editors in Jeffrey's house. He continued as contributor. His early career at the bar was distinguished, but he had no need to develop it further. A liberal, Murray threw in his lot with the young Edinburgh Whig lawyers, and took part in the agitation before the Reform Bill of 1832. In December 1832, he was returned unopposed for Leith Burghs, which had been enfranchised under the bill. He was appointed recorder of the great roll and clerk of the pipe, a sinecure in the Scottish exchequer which he did not long hold. On the elevation of Jeffrey to the bench in 1835, Murray succeeded him as Lord Advocate. He introduced a large number of bills into the House of Commons, including measures for the reform of the universities, for giving popular magistracies to small towns, for enabling sheriffs to hold small debt circuits, for the reform of the court of session, and for amending the bankruptcy law, but only succeeded in carrying a few minor reforms. In 1839, he was savagely attacked in parliament by his old friend Brougham for his conduct in the case of five cotton-spinners who were tried on a charge of murder arising out of a trade-union dispute. He answered the charges in the House of Commons. Murray in 1839 left parliament for the Court of Session. He was knighted that year, adopting the courtesy title Lord Murray. In 1844 Murray was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh his proposer being Thomas Stewart Traill. He served as the Society's Vice President from 1849 to 1857. He remained on the bench till his death at his house 11 Great Stuart StreetEdinburgh Post Office Directory 1858 on the Moray Estate in Edinburgh on 7 March 1859.

Lord Meadowbank's Edinburgh townhouse at 13 Royal Circus The Right Honourable Alexander Maconochie, Lord Meadowbank of Garvock and Pitliver FRSE FSA (Scot) (2 March 1777‚Äì30 November1861), was a Scottish advocate, judge, landowner and politician. After 1854 he took the surname Maconochie- Welwood. Life Maconochie was born on 2 March 1777 in Midlothian, the eldest son of Elizabeth Welwood of Garvock and Allan Maconochie, Lord Meadowbank. He was educated at the Royal High School, Edinburgh, and probably at the University of Edinburgh. He was admitted as an advocate in 1799, and in 1800 admitted to the Highland Society. He served as Sheriff of Haddington from 1810 and Solicitor General for Scotland from 1813, and as Lord Advocate from 1816 to 1819. In keeping with his appointment as Lord Advocate, he was Member of Parliament for Yarmouth, Isle of Wight, England, from 1817-1818, for the Kilrenny district of Anstruther Burghs from 1818 to 1819. He made his Parliamentary debut during a period of considerable unrest in both Scotland and England in 1817, choosing to mark it by announcing the existence of a seditious conspiracy of weavers in the suburbs of Glasgow. The ensuing prosecutions were spectacularly unsuccessful, however, and caused considerable embarrassment, both to the government and to Maconochie himself, who, as Lord Advocate, was directly responsible. In 1817 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Sir William Arbuthnot, 1st Baronet, Thomas Allan, Sir David Brewster and Sir Henry Jardine. He served as a Councillor of the Society during 1822-5 (Literary section) and 1835‚Äì7. In the 1830s, his address is listed as 13 Royal Circus Edinburgh's New Town. In part because of his rather indifferent record, especially after further embarrassment in the Court of Session in 1819, he was appointed a lord of session and justiciary as Lord Meadowbank 1819, and resigned in 1843. With the same title as his father, he was subject of one of Scots law's better puns. When he quizzed one advocate as to the difference between 'likewise and also', he received the reply that just as his father had been Lord Meadowbank, so was he, 'also but not likewise'. He assumed the additional surname of Welwood on succeeding to his cousin's estates in 1854. Maconochie-Welwood died on 30 November 1861 at Meadowbank House (now named Kirknewton House), Kirknewton, West Lothian, and was interred at a private burial ground at Meadowbank House. Artistic Patronage He was patron to the Edinburgh artist William Crawford.http://www.avictorian.com/Crawford_William.html Family In 1805 he married Anne Blair the daughter of Robert Blair, Lord Avontoun. The couple had children included Allan Alexander Maconochie FRSE (1806-1885).

It may be sprinkled with romano cheese or oregano. It is not usually served straight from the oven, but allowed to cool and then consumed at room temperature or reheated. Like Sicilian pizza, tomato pie is baked in a large rectangular pan and served in square slices. In Rhode Island it is cut into long strips and often called pizza strips. Tomato pie descends from and resembles the Italian sfincione, although it is not the same dish; for instance, sfincione may have toppings, is usually served hot, and has a crust more like brioche than foccacia. Other names for tomato pie include gravy pie (\\"gravy\\" here refers to \\"Italian gravy\\", i.e. tomato sauce) and church pie in Philadelphia, and red bread, strip pizza, party pizza and bakery pizza in Rhode Island. A 1903 article in the New-York Tribune on the food of Italian-Americans described an early version of tomato pie.

History She was built by Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company in Govan on the River Clyde. The ship was laid down in 1955, launched 6 April 1959, and completed 7 July 1960. She was named after the city of Lincoln, Lincolnshire. On Tuesday 13 July 1965 she recommissioned in Singapore Dockyard under the command of Commander D C Nairne RN and served in the Far East during the Indonesian Conflict, she also visited Subic Bay during exercises with the US Navy and Hong Kong where she was guard ship. Returning to Singapore she sailed for Plymouth in 1966.Commissioning Book and service onboard In October 1973 she took part in the Second Cod War under the command of Commander D Howard, and after being rammed in the stern during the first Cod war Commander Howard took steps to stop this happening again. This involved mounting two lengths of railway line protruding from the stern. This had the desired effect in protecting the stern of the ship. However, damage was caused to both port and starboard sides of the ship when the ship was positioned between a target trawler and the gunboat Aegir. After a successful deployment the ship returned to Chatham to undergo repairs. In April 1974 HMS Lincoln was decommissioned at Chatham and placed in the reserve fleet. With the serious damage being suffered by British frigates in late 1975, due to aggressive ramming by Icelandic gunboats, in the Third Cod War in 1976, Lincoln received a short refit for patrol duties with improved wooden padding on the bow area for ramming reinforcement.L. Marriott. Royal Navy Frigates 1945-1983. Ian Allen. London (1983) p 50 It has been suggested, Lincoln was selected for this ramming role as it was the one Type 61, not fitted with hull stabilizer fins.Marriott, (1983)p50 She was engaged in sea trials before commencing active service, when settlement was reached over the fishing conflict. In 1976 the New Zealand Government sought to purchase second hand Royal Navy to replace the RNZN Type 12 Taranaki, and HMS Lincoln was one of four RN frigates that was offered for sale. The New Zealand Government rejected the offer for Lincoln, as her 174 Sonar had been removed and could not easily be refitted. Remaining in British service, Lincoln carried out a tour of duty in the Arctic Circle and served as the guard ship in Gibraltar during late 1976. She was finally returned to the standby squadron in Chatham in December 1977. She was proposed for sale to Egypt in 1978, but that deal also did not proceed. In 1979 Lincoln served her final active commission as a training ship for submarine engineers, as her engines were akin to those aboard the Oberon-class submarine. She was also used in Arctic waters alongside HMS Bulwark, to provide radar cover for the initial sea trials of the Sea Harrier aircraft. Lincolns 966 and 986 radars were used in combination with Bulwarks 986 radar to provide tracking over Scandinavia. The 986 radar had been fitted to three Type 61s, Bulwark and Ark Royal in around 1970, as a partial replacement for the complex 984 3D radar previously fitted to the carriers. In 1981 Lincoln was unsuccessfully proposed for sale to the Bangladesh Navy.

Life He was born in Glasgow in 1756, the only son of John Campbell of Clathick, Perthshire, provost of Glasgow, and Agnes, the only child of Laurence Colquhoun of Killermont, Dumbartonshire. On succeeding to the estate of Killermont upon the death of his father in 1804, he assumed the additional surname and arms of Colquhoun. He was admitted an advocate in 1768 and appointed Sheriff of Perth from 1793 to 1807 and rector of Glasgow University from 1807 to 1809. On the downfall of the ministry of All the Talents, he was appointed Lord Advocate on 28 March 1807. At this time, most of the Scotch patronage was in the hands of the Dundas family, and William Erskine, Alexander Maconochie. and Henry Cockburn were actually chosen deputes by Lord Melville before Colquhoun had received the appointment. In the following May, he was returned as Member of Parliament for the Elgin district of burghs, but after three years resigned his seat. In July 1810 he was elected member for Dumbartonshire, which county he continued to represent until his death in 1820. Colquhoun, as the Lord Advocate, took part in reforming the constitution of the Court of Session, and was appointed one of the thirteen commissioners who sat for the first time on 30 November 1808 for the purpose of inquiring into the administration of justice in Scotland. The correspondence between him and Erskine, the late lord advocate, on the subject of the respective merits of Lord Grenville's and Lord Eldon's bills for the reform of legal procedure will be found in the 'Scots Magazine' for 1808, pp. 70‚Äì2, 149‚Äì52. On the death of Lord Frederick Campbell, Colquhoun was appointed Lord Clerk Register, on 4 July 1816, much to the disappointment of Erskine's friends, who had hoped that the post would have been offered to him. He was a partner in the Thistle Bank of Glasgow. Colquhoun died on 8 December 1820, after an illness of a few days, at the house of his son-in-law, Walter Long, at Hartham, Wiltshire, and was buried in the parish churchyard of New Kilpatrick near Glasgow. Family In 1796 he married Mary Ann, daughter of the Rev. William Erskine, episcopalian minister at Muthill, Perthshire, and sister of William Erskine, afterwards Lord Kinneder. His wife survived him for many years, and died at Rothesay on 15 May 1833. They had six daughters and two sons: * John Campbell Colquhoun of Killermont and Garscadden, * William Laurence Colquhoun, who died on 16 Jan. 1861. Their eldest child died within a year of her birth, and it was on this occasion that Carolina Oliphant, afterwards Baroness Nairne, wrote The Land of the Leal, which she sent to her old friend Mrs. Colquhoun. Assessment Colquhoun was a good classical scholar, a sound lawyer, and an eloquent pleader. Being a man of independent fortune and of reserved manners, he hardly took the position at the bar to which his abilities entitled him. His only reported speech does not appear to have been a great success. He rose 'amidst a tumultuous cry of Question! Question!' to take part in the debate on the Duke of York's conduct, and had not got very far when the house became 'so clamorous for the question that the hon. member could no longer be heard'.

It is located just west of the Sacramento River in the eastern portion of the county. Broderick's ZIP Code is 95605 and is in area codes 916 and 279. It lies at an elevation of 23 feet (7 m). History =Beginnings= Washington was rumored to be named after George Washington because the town plan was filed by Margaret McDowell on Washington's birthday. Margaret McDowell's first husband, James McDowell, settled and developed of land on a rancho he purchased from John Schwartz in 1846. He was killed in the Spring of 1849 in a saloon brawl, leaving his wife a widow. Margaret McDowell was left with five children, a house and a garden. She had taken in boarders as a means of income, but found she needed to do something else to remain financially able. In August 1849 she hired a surveyor to map that was adjoined to her garden. In October of that year she established the boundaries of her property and created a town plat of 41 blocks which she named Washington. She sold several lots during the next few years, but Washington's plat was not officially recorded and the town was called by other names including \\"Margeretta\\" and \\"West Sacramento\\". In 1850 there were approximately 300 people residing in Washington. During the summer of 1851 the county seat was relocated from Fremont to Washington because of the severe flooding that Fremont had experienced the winter before. It now seemed that Washington had the potential to become comparable to its \\"booming\\" sister city, Sacramento on the opposite side of the river. A post office was established in April 1854 but the building burnt down in 1856 and to the dismay of the residents, a post office was never reconstructed and they had to go to Sacramento to get their mail for the next 33 years. The Washington Public School District was organized in 1856, and the land was donated by Margaret McDowell, now married to Dr. Enos C. Taylor, her third husband, and renamed Mrs. Margaret Taylor. The school district still serves West Sacramento, and built three local schools within the first decade of its existence. Local flooding that had occurred almost annually had alarmed Yolo County residents who voted to move the county seat to Cacheville (now Yolo) in 1857. However, residents disliked their choice because Cacheville was so isolated and small, and moved the county seat back to Washington. Unfortunately the weather proved disastrous in the winter of 1861-62, and in 1862 the voters held a special election to vote a permanent county seat. The county seat was elected to be Woodland to the dislike of Washingtonians. Another heavy blow to the already downtrodden Washington residents was the completion of a bridge to Sacramento located roughly where the I Street Bridge is located today. Travelers coming from the Bay Area now had no reason to stop in Washington on their way to Sacramento. There was no need to use the local ferries because the toll bridge was cheaper. Economic optimism increased in Washington when the California Pacific Railroad reached the town in November 1868, and Washington was the railhead of the line that started in Vallejo. The outcome wasn't quite as hoped for. Property values did not increase, and had actually decreased in comparison to the Gold Rush days. In addition to that, a new junction was completed in Davisville (now Davis) that headed towards Woodland, diverting rail traffic from Washington. Furthermore, in 1870 Cal-P reconstructed the I Street Bridge to withstand the weight of rail cars, so the rail line could reach Sacramento. In 1871 what is modern day Downtown Sacramento raised its buildings nine feet and reinforced the levees on its side of the Sacramento River to withstand the annual flooding. The unincorporated town of Washington could not afford to properly engineer well- protected levees nor raise the whole town, so each year they would fix their levees and endure any flooding that would occur. The town was renamed in the late 1800s in honor of the anti-slavery advocate and United States Senator David C. Broderick. A new post office was established in 1893, and operated until 1909 with a brief closure in 1895 to 1896. Businesses The largest employer in Broderick is the California State Teachers Retirement System, which built its headquarters on the waterfront. The Ziggurat building, originally built as the corporate headquarters for The Money Store and now home to the State Department of General Services, sits at the edge of the area. The neighborhood's iconic restaurant is Sal's Tacos, known for its mosaic tile decor. In 2012, Broderick Restaurant and Bar opened.

Operation The operation was ordered by James Callaghan after fifty Argentine \\"scientists\\" landed on Southern Thule, prompting fears of an Argentine invasion of the Falklands. The Argentines set up a military base on Thule. It is likely, according to the Foreign Office, that the prompt action prevented a more serious attack. The force planned under heavy security was commanded by Hugh Balfour and consisted of the nuclear submarine Dreadnought, two frigates, Alacrity and Phoebe, and the auxiliaries Resurgent and Olwen as support vessels. The Argentines rapidly became aware of the taskforce's presence, but their forces remained on Thule and Callaghan decided against the use of force to evict them. The foreign secretary at the time David Owen later claimed that if Margaret Thatcher's government had taken similarly quick action five years later, the Argentines would not have invaded in 1982 leading to the Falklands War.  Rules of engagement  The 1977 rules of engagement were: \\"Commanding officers and aircraft captains are to respond to any aggression with tactful firmness and are to exhibit a determination to meet any escalation, though not to exceed that already carried out by the enemy.\\" \\"All use of force must be governed by the principle of using only the minimum force necessary to achieve the aim.\\" Such force must be used only until it was evident \\"that the immediate aim is being achieved, and must in no way be retaliatory\\". The submarine commander was told: \\"If you are attacked with [anti-submarine] weapons by [Argentine] forces, you are to surface or withdraw at high speed submerged, whichever will be of least risk to life.\\" They also set up a 50-mile security zone and any ships entering would be told that they must identify themselves and state their plans.Ben Fenton (1 June 2005) \\"Secret Falklands task force revealed\\", Daily Telegraph Classified documents relating to Operation Journeyman were released in 2005.

The views expressed in the statement, while not considered \\"traditional conservative principles\\" at the time, played a significant role in influencing Republican leaders in the 1980s. Written by M. Stanton EvansKlatch, Rebecca E. (1999). A Generation Divided: The New Left, the New Right, and the 1960s University of California Press. p. 21. . and adopted on September 11, 1960, the statement is named for the location of the inaugural meeting of Young Americans for Freedom, held at William F. Buckley, Jr.'s estate in Sharon, Connecticut. Background In the late 1950s conservative students on college campuses campaigned for policies to combat communism. Many of these students became supporters of Barry Goldwater's 1960 campaign for the GOP vice-presidential nomination. At the Republican National Convention, Goldwater, failing to secure the nomination, challenged attendees saying: \\"Let‚Äôs grow up conservatives. If you want to take the party back, then let‚Äôs get to work!\\" In response, a meeting was organized at the home of William F. Buckley in Sharon, Connecticut. In attendance at the Sharon Conference were about 90 students from 44 universities located in 24 states. Amongst the attendees were several future conservative leaders including historian Lee Edwards, Howard Phillips, Don Lipsett (co-founder Philadelphia Society), Paul Niemeyer (United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit), National Review publisher William A. Rusher (National Review publisher), Allan Ryskind (publisher of Human Events) and M. Stanton Evans. It was decided to organize a new organization which was named the Young Americans for Freedom (YAF). Evans was selected to draft the founding principles of the group, named Sharon Statement after Buckley's residence. Evans said he was influenced by the works of conservative thinkers such as F. A. Hayek, Russell Kirk, William F. Buckley Jr., and Whittaker Chambers. Summary The Sharon Statement consists of 400 words. It's an expression of National Review editor Frank Meyer‚Äôs \\"fusionism,\\" described as a combination of traditional conservatism, libertarianism and anti-communism, the three prevailing variants of conservatism at the time. The inclusion of \\"God\\" in the document was controversial. The statement begins with the statement \\"‚Äúforemost among the transcendent values is the individual‚Äôs use of his God-given free will.\\" It then proceeds to espouse five core principles which have directed the conservative movement since its adoption: # Individual freedom and the right of governing originate with God # Political freedom is impossible without economic freedom # Limited government and strict interpretation of the Constitution # The free market system is preferable over all others # Communism must be defeated, not contained Legacy Two years later, in 1962, Tom Hayden wrote the Port Huron Statement. The manifesto for Students for a Democratic Society has been called the left's response to the Sharon Statement. In 2010, fifty years after the adoption of the Sharon Statement, the Mount Vernon Statement was written. The Mount Vernon Statement shares the same sentiment of the Sharon Statement. However where Sharon focuses on the \\"outworkings of liberty and self-government\\", Mount Vernon emphasizes a principle from the Declaration of Independence: that human freedom is based on \\"the laws of nature and nature‚Äôs God.\\" In a 2010 interview, Evans reflected on the impact of the Sharon Statement attributing the document and the movement it spawned to the fall of the Soviet Union while failing to address the \\"domestic spending issue\\" and ‚Äúcultural issues, educational issues.\\" In his obituary of Evans journalist Adam Clymer called it a \\"seminal document\\" in the establishment of the conservative movement. The Heritage Foundation described the Sharon Statement as \\"statement is a succinct summary of the central ideas of modern American conservatism\\". References Further reading * Thorburn, Wayne.

The show aired on NBC from September 10 to December 3, 1988 for a single season of 13 episodes. The show is the only Saturday morning animated adaptation of both an SCTV character and a Saturday Night Live character. Guest stars on the show included Christopher Guest and SCTV alumni Eugene Levy and Dave Thomas. The show also featured the voices of Ren√© Auberjonois, Kenneth Mars, and Arte Johnson. Though the show was not renewed for a second season, The Completely Mental Misadventures of Ed Grimley was later seen in reruns in 1996 on Cartoon Network's unnamed pre-Adult Swim-era late-night programming block, which consisted of such shows as Space Ghost Coast to Coast and reruns of classic Looney Tunes shorts and Hanna-Barbera programming, before it was rerun again on Boomerang. Hanna-Barbera sponsored an Ed Grimley look-alike contest midway through the first season, which was won by 10-year- old Matt Mitchell from Des Moines, Iowa. Synopsis and characters Episodes of the show often featured Ed Grimley in several adventures, which start out as mundane, but turn very surreal and cartoonish, interspersed with science lessons from The Amazing Gustav Brothers, Roger and Emil, and a live-action segment with a \\"scary story\\" titled The Count Floyd Show presented as a show- within-a-show by Grimley's favorite television host, SCTV's Count Floyd (played by SCTV cast member Joe Flaherty). Grimley's fellow cartoon characters included Grimley's landlord Leo Freebus (voiced by Jonathan Winters), Leo's wife Deidre (voiced by Andrea Martin), his ditzy, amateur actress neighbor Ms. Malone (voiced by Catherine O'Hara; a female character by the name of Ms. Malone did appear on an SNL version of an Ed Grimley sketch on the season ten episode hosted by Alex Karras, but Ms. Malone was played by that episode's musical guest Tina Turner), and her little brother Wendell (voiced by Danny Cooksey).

History The station was opened in 1907 to serve the eastern suburbs of Exeter. It was situated just a short distance along the branch to Exmouth and was convenient for Exmouth Junction engine shed which was on the opposite side of the main line. The platforms were rebuilt in 1927 using concrete components cast at the concrete workshop that had been established at Exmouth Junction. On 4 February 1973 the branch was singled and the down platform taken out of use. Private goods sidings were provided on the west side of the line on both sides of the station. Between the platform and the junction was a siding to a brickworks, while a little to the south was Newcourt, a military depot. Description It has one platform currently in use - on the right of trains arriving from Exeter - situated on an embankment above Pinhoe Road. The only access to the station is via a number of steps. The former second platform and its stairwell to street level remains opposite the platform in use, albeit very overgrown and derelict. The station serves the Polsloe, Mount Pleasant, Hamlin and Whipton areas of the city. This station has no ticket machine.

He is one of the most celebrated cultural figures in Armenia, Iran, and Austria. As one of the leading conductors of his generation, he has led international orchestras throughout the world: in Austria, UK, United States‚Äô Canada, Hungary, Copenhagen, Iran, Finland, USSR, Armenia, Thailand, Hong Kong, South Africa, Denmark, and Israel. As a composer Tjeknavorian has written 6 operas, 5 symphonies, choral works (among them God is Love, The Life of Christ, the oratorio Book of Revelation, and a requiem), chamber music, ballet music, piano and vocal works, concerti for piano, violin, guitar, cello and pipa (Chinese lute), as well as music for documentary and feature films. His compositions have been performed by major orchestras, including the London Symphony Orchestra, London Philharmonic Orchestra, Halle Orchestra, Philharmonic Orchestra Helsinki, American Symphony Orchestra in New York, Tehran Symphony Orchestra, Johannesburg Symphony Orchestra, Haifa Symphony Orchestra, the Mexico Symphony Orchestra, London Percussion Virtuosi, Strasbourg Percussion Ensemble and English Chamber Orchestra. He has made some 100 recordings with RCA, Philips, EMI, ASV, and others. His son, Emmanuel Tjeknavorian is an Armenian Austrian violinist and conductor. Early years (1937‚Äì1969) Born in Borujerd, Iran in 1937 to immigrant Armenian parents, Tjeknavorian's early life was succinctly chronicled in the London magazine Gramophone in 1976: \\"His father came from Eastern Armenia and his mother had fled from Western Armenia during the 1915 Armenian Genocide‚Ä¶Influenced by three cultures, Armenian, Iranian and Western he benefited from a cosmopolitan upbringing. His grandfather, a doctor, liked to play the violin and as a boy Loris enjoyed listening to professional string-players (Russian, Armenian or Polish immigrants) in local caf√©s. Although not themselves musical, his parents wanted all three children (one boy, two girls) to play musical instruments. Eight-year-old Loris was given a violin. Despite the lack of a teacher, the boy began to study in earnest; before long he had composed a number of piano pieces, with no formal instruction whatsoever. At 16 he formed a four-part choir and organized and conducted his own orchestra in Teheran. A year later he was ready to leave for the Vienna Academy of Music as a violin and composition student. While there, he wrote a violin concerto, which received the ultimate endorsement from his teacher, Hans-Joachim Drevo, who was the soloist in the work's premi√®re. Tjeknavorian graduated with honours.\\" (Gramophone, November 1976) Shortly after his graduation, the Austrian music publisher Doblinger published four of his piano compositions as well as his Ballet Fantastique for three pianos, celeste and percussion in Vienna. Following this fruitful period of education, Tjeknavorian went back to Iran in 1961, where he taught music theory at the Tehran Conservatory of Music. At the same time, he was appointed director of Tehran's Music Archives and put in charge of collecting and researching traditional and modern Iranian folk music and instruments. He mounted the first Archives exhibition to great success, and began work on an opera based on the epic poem of Rostam and Sohrab. Tjeknavorian returned to Austria in 1963 to further his studies in Salzburg at the Mozarteum. There, he met the renowned composer Carl Orff, who was to become the young musician's mentor and enthusiastic supporter. On hearing Tjeknavorian play sections of his opera Rostam and Sohrab, Orff offered him a full one-year scholarship to stay in Salzburg to complete the first draft of the opera. In addition, Orff commissioned Tjeknavorian to compose piano music based on Armenian music for the Schulwerk, Orff's system for teaching music. Tjeknavorian composed over 130 short pieces for beginning to advanced students. These are collected in two volumes called Kaleidoscope for Piano, portions of which were also published by Schott as Bilder Aus Armenia (Pictures from Armenia). Tjeknavorian moved to the United States in 1965, where he began to study conducting at the University of Michigan. From 1966 to 1967 he was appointed composer-in-residence at Concordia College in Moorhead, Minnesota, and from 1966 to 1970 head of the instrumental and opera departments at Moorhead University in Minnesota. Back in Iran (1970‚Äì1975) In 1970, the Cultural Ministry of Iran offered Tjeknavorian the positions of composer-in-residence and principal conductor at the Rudaki Opera House in Tehran. While there he conducted a number of major operas, including his own Pardis and Parisa. Tjeknavorian's extensive study of the technical aspects of traditional Iranian instruments culminated with the composition of the dance- drama Simorgh, the first polyphonic composition scored entirely for Iranian instruments and based on themes from Zoroastrian myth and Persian mystical poetry. Following sold-out performances of the ballet in Tehran, the suite from Simorgh was recorded and released as an LP in London by Unicorn in 1975 to great critical acclaim. Writing about his unique compositional style, Gramophone praised the piece as \\"strangely beautiful\\". In Tehran Tjeknavorian's talents found huge demand, and he soon became the leading composer of film music in Iran, scoring some 30 scores for documentaries and short and popular feature films, many of them classics of pre-revolutionary Iranian cinema. Among them was the award-winning film Bita, starring Iranian singing and acting legend Googoosh, released in 1972. That same year Tjeknavorian received the Homayoun Order and Medal for Persepolis, his score for the spectacular Son et Lumiere show at the ancient Persian capital. The audience consisted of dignitaries and heads of state from around the world that had gathered in Iran for the 2500th anniversary of the Persian Empire. The show was a highlight of the unprecedented event, and was followed by the release of the score by Philipps. Back in the West (1975‚Äì1987) In 1975 Tjeknavorian relocated to London where he signed an exclusive conducting contract with the RCA recording company. His first release was the hugely acclaimed recording of Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 6 (\\"Pathetique\\") with the LSO, hailed in Gramophone as \\"bold and exciting\\" and by RCA as \\"an astounding performance of electrifying passion and nobility\\". Tjeknavorian's sudden impact on the international music scene in London created a furor, with RCA running two-page advertisement in Gramophone proclaiming him \\"the greatest conductor of his generation\\". Attended by talk-of-the-town performances at venues such as the Royal Festival Hall, Tjeknavorian followed this early success with a series of similarly acclaimed recordings with the London Symphony Orchestra, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and the London Philharmonic Orchestra, including ground-breaking interpretations of Sibelius, Stravinsky, Shostakovich, Dvorak, and Borodin. Tjeknavorian's also quickly established himself as the world's foremost interpreter of the symphonic music of Aram Khachaturian. His recording of the complete score of the ballet Gayaneh, the first and only of its kind, was hailed by the London critics as \\"first class\\" and \\"the most distinguished of the RCA recordings made by Loris Tjeknavorian\\" (Gramophone, April 1977 and June 1983). In 1978 Tjeknavorian organized Music Armenia, described in Gramophone as \\"the first Armenian Festival on foreign soil. During the day there were symposiums, conferences and comparative studies of Armenian music, and in the evening, concerts presenting Armenian artists and composers.\\" Speaking to the London magazine, Tjeknavorian explained: \\"Being Christian, the first thing the Armenians did‚Ä¶was to translate the Bible as early as the fourth century AD. Then they started writing music in the fifth century. As soon as the alphabet was created, the chants started to be written down in old neumes. By the eighteenth century they could no longer decipher these neumes, so the musicians got together and renotated all the different chants. When I was studying in Vienna I discovered the Armenian Monastery there, and found a wealth of these chants. I became so involved in searching through all the manuscripts, it took me 15 years, and I found seven different traditions amounting to something like 30,000 melodies‚Ä¶It was far removed from my original idea of having the melodies just for my own compositional use, and I realized that it was of immense interest to musicologists\\" (Gramophone, May 1979). For his long and dedicated work Tjeknavorian was awarded the Order of \\"Gregory the Illuminator\\" by the late Catholicos Vazgen I. Taking some of the medieval chants he had rediscovered, Tjeknavorian composed the vocal work Life of Christ, first performed during the Festival at the Queen Elizabeth Hall by the Ambrosian Singers. Many of Tjeknavorian's most important compositions were written in this fruitful and personally difficult ten-year period culminating with, and immediately following, the Iranian Revolution in 1979. Foremost among his works during this time are his Second Symphony (Credo) and the oratorio The Book of Revelations, the second and third parts respectively of his trilogy on the Armenian Genocide begun with his groundbreaking First Symphony (Requiem for the Massacred) scored for trumpet and percussion and released in London by Unicorn in 1976. Another key work towards the end of this period was his ballet Othello, commissioned by the Northern Ballet Company and premiered in London in 1985 with Princess Ann in attendance. The recording of the piece released that year on EMI with the London Symphony Orchestra was praised by Gramophone as \\"enormously effective\\" (Gramophone, November 1985). Armenia (1989‚Äì2000) Soon after settling in New York City in 1986, Tjeknavorian's destiny was diverted by the devastating Armenian earthquake of December 1988. In response, Tjeknavorian organized a benefit concert at Carnegie Hall to raise relief funds for the victims. The concert featured Pl√°cido Domingo, Mstislav Rostropovich, Alexander Toradze and stars of the New York Metropolitan Opera, including Mirella Freni, Frederica von Stade, Samuel Ramey and Elena Obraztsova. Ticket sales for the event raised $500,000 that was sent to Armenia, where Tjeknavorian relocated a few months later, having been appointed Principal Conductor and Artistic Director of the Armenian Philharmonic Orchestra (APO) in Yerevan. For Tjeknavorian, the most important task was rebuilding the cultural life of Gyumri (then Leninakan), Armenia's second largest city, which had been devastated by the earthquake. In 1991 Tjeknavorian announced his intention to go on a pilgrimage walk from Yerevan to Gyumri in order to raise funds for rebuilding efforts. Thousands of people joined him along the way and a huge percentage of the Armenian population donated money for the cause. Fifteen million rubles, worth around 20 million dollars at the time, were collected nationwide. Unfortunately, several months later the Soviet ruble was devalued and Tjeknavorian was compelled to seek additional money from private sources. Tjeknavorian took over the huge communist party headquarters, which had been destroyed, and in seven years transformed it into the first Academy of Music and Arts in Gyumri. During this time, his fundraising led to the founding of a symphony orchestra, wind ensemble, choir and dance ensemble, the renovation of the theater and restarting of the Gyumri TV station, and purchasing musical instruments for the orchestra and band, whose instruments had all been destroyed in the earthquake, as well as ten grand pianos for the Arts and Music Academy. Tjeknavorian was also instrumental in the 1991 campaign for Armenian independence. Through his tours in various Armenian cities and an all-night televised performance on national television two days before the measure passed on September 21, 1991, Tjeknavorian managed to increase the \\"Yes\\" vote for independence from 30 to 96 per cent. Given the heated controversy and popular passions surrounding the question of independence, the peaceful nature of the victory was unique, reached by Tjeknavorian through the power of music and a positive cultural message. Following independence, Tjeknavorian served on the committee to reinstate the pre-communist Armenian flag and the national coat-of-arms. He was especially influential in the adoption of the national anthem, \\"Mer Hayrenik\\" (Our Fatherland), for which he rewrote the words for the first stanza. Tjeknavorian also renamed the two major avenues of Yerevan during last year of the Soviet period, from Lenin and Red Army to Mesrop Mashtots (creator of the Armenian alphabet in 451) and Gregory the Illuminator (founder of the Armenian church in 301 AD) respectively. The renaming reflected his philosophy of \\"Faith and Culture\\" as the twin foundations upon which the Armenian nation must be re-built. During the crippling energy blockade between 1992 and 1995 - a result of the Karabakh war - the capital was gripped by shortages of food, water, heat and electricity. Faithful to his vow that \\"the doors of culture must never be closed\\", Tjeknavorian maintained weekly concerts at this time, including a regular series of spiritual music concerts every Saturday in anticipation of the 1700th anniversary of Christianity in Armenia. Organizing transportation for the musicians and securing their daily needs, installing power generators and electric heaters and ensuring constant power supply in the building, Tjeknavorian turned the Aram Khachaturian Hall into a sanctuary of culture and faith, and was instrumental in lifting the spirits of the thousands who packed the hall each week. This phenomenon was memorialized by numerous eyewitnesses of the time, including former Russian Ambassador Vladimir Stupishin, who wrote at length about Tjeknavorian's activities in his memoirs. During his eleven-year collaboration with the APO, his recordings with the orchestra for ORF (the Austrian radio and television station) and ASV (an English recording company) achieved worldwide recognition; they frequently toured Europe, the United States, Canada, Iran and Lebanon. For three successive years, from 1991 to 1993, the APO was the resident orchestra in the ORF benefit program Licht Ins Dunkel in Vienna. Iran (2000 ‚Äì present) Loris Tjeknavorian speaking in Cheragh Khamosh Nist conference in Iranshahr Hall in Tehran In 2000, Tjeknavorian resigned from the APO in order to devote more time to composing. During this period he also conducted the Vienna Symphony Orchestra, and performed at the San Francisco Opera House, the Contemporary Music Festival and at the Vienna Music Festival in Hong Kong and Bangkok. He conducted the Austrian premiere of his opera Rostam and Sohrab at the Festspielhaus in St. P√∂lten. From 2009 to the present Tjeknavorian has continued to devote his time to composing, as well as painting and writing short stories. Among his most recent works are the operas Zahak (libretto based on Ferdowsi's Shahnameh) and Mowlana and Shams-e Tabriz (libretto based on the poetry of Rumi), as well as the chamber opera \\"The Final Hour of Sadegh Hedayat\\" (libretto based on \\"The Blind Owl\\" and other works by the Iranian writer Sadegh Hedayat). Other works include his second concerto for violin and chamber orchestra, a work for solo piano titled \\"1915\\", and two major symphonic suites: King Cyrus, about the ancient Persian king, and Takhti, dedicated to the celebrated Iranian wrestler. Tjeknavorian's paintings were exhibited at the Gallery Shirin in Tehran, Gallery Maryam Seyhoun in Los Angeles, and twice at the House of the Artists in Tehran. His series of short stories, written in English, will be published in the near future. On December 20, 2008, Tjeknavorian recorded Hafez Nazeri's The night of Angel (yet to be released) with the London Symphony orchestra. Tjeknavorian's recent performances include benefit concerts in Tehran and Los Angeles for the organization MAHAK on behalf of children with cancer, a series of concerts with the Armenian Chamber Orchestra at the Talar Vahdat Hall in Tehran, a performance of his Ararat Suite with the Sacramento Symphony, and the world premiere of his King Cyrus symphonic suite with the San Francisco Philharmonic Orchestra in August 2013. In 2011 the Iranian BARBAD recording company issued a 20-CD box set of Tjerknavorian's major works (symphonies, choral works, ballet, chamber music, operas, etc.) plus 2 DVDs of his opera Rostam & Sohrab. During an interview on the occasion of his 81st birthday, Tjeknavorian said to the journalist of IRNA: \\"Iran is my homeland. My ancestors have lived in this land. I‚Äôve been born in Iran and will be buried here. I‚Äôm emotionally and culturally attached to every inch of this country and feel at home in nowhere except for Iran.\\" Armenian Philharmonic In 1989, Tjeknavarian was appointed Principal Conductor and Artistic Director of the Armenian Philharmonic Orchestra (APO). During his eleven years collaboration with the APO, his recordings for ORF (the Austrian radio and television station) and ASV (an English recording company) achieved worldwide recognition, they frequently toured Europe, the United States, Canada, Iran and Lebanon. In three successive years, from 1991 to 1993, the APO was the resident orchestra in the ORF benefit program \\"Licht ins Dunkel\\" (\\"Light into the Darkness\\") in Vienna. However, in 2000, Tjeknavarian resigned from this position in order to be able to devote more time to composing and conducting other orchestras.

History  Amoskeag Falls in 1906 \\"Amoskeag\\" derives from the Pennacook word \\"Namoskeag,\\" which roughly translates as \\"good fishing place.‚Äù Here, the Merrimack River drops 50 feet (15 m).U.S. Geological Survey 7.5-minute topographic map series, Manchester North quadrangle, 1982 Native American tribes in the region visited Amoskeag Falls due to its plentiful migrating sturgeon, alewife, and salmon, which were easily fished in the rapids. Natives typically caught fish using a combination of large nets strung across the river. Significant native settlements were sited near the falls, particularly on the high bluffs overlooking the east side of the river. In 1807, Samuel Blodgett started a canal and lock system at the river to help vessels navigate around the falls, opening the area to development. This soon led to the use of the falls for a power canal to provide water power for Manchester's 19th century industrial development, most notable for the Amoskeag Manufacturing Company.History of the Amoskeag Falls Use of the name Due to the significance of the falls in Manchester history, a number of local companies have adopted their name. Examples include the Amoskeag Manufacturing Company (which operated a majority of Manchester's textile mills using power from the falls until they closed in the midst of labor strikes in 1935), its division called the Amoskeag Locomotive Works (an early manufacturer of fire trucks and train cars), and the Amoskeag Fishways (an environmental education center located at the Amoskeag Falls).

Life Hope was born on 29 June 1763, the eldest son of Mary Breton, the only daughter of Eliab Breton of Forty Hill, Enfield (a granddaughter of Sir William Wolstenholme) and John Hope, Member of Parliament (MP) for Linlithgowshire, and a grandson of Charles Hope, 1st Earl of Hopetoun. He was educated at Enfield Grammar School, and later at the Edinburgh High School, where in 1777 he was the Latin dux. After studying law at the University of Edinburgh he was admitted as an advocate on 11 December 1784, and on 25 March 1786 was appointed a Deputy Advocate. In 1788 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Allan Maconochie, Lord Meadowbank, James Gregory, and the mathematician John Playfair. Though not conspicuous as a lawyer he was an accomplished public speaker, and in this capacity made himself useful at the Tory political meetings. On 5 June 1792 he became Sheriff of Orkney, and in June 1801 was appointed Lord Advocate in the Addington administration in the room of Robert Dundas of Arniston. Shortly afterwards he was presented with the freedom of the city of Edinburgh, together with a piece of plate, for his assistance to the magistrates in obtaining a poor's bill for the city. At the general election in July 1802, he was returned to the House of Commons for Dumfries district, but resigned his seat when Henry Dundas's elevation to the upper house, and was returned unopposed for the city of Edinburgh (January 1803). During his service as Lord Advocate, Hope conducted through the House of Commons the Scotch Parochial Schoolmasters' Act (43 Geo. III, c. 54), by means of which authorities building schools were also obliged to erect houses with at least two rooms for the schoolmasters. The only speech of his reported in the 'Parliamentary Debates' was one delivered in his own defence in the debate on Whitbread's motion for the production of papers relating to Hope's censure of a Banffshire farmer named Morison, who had discharged his servant for attending drills of a volunteer regiment. Hope made an ingenious defence, and gave a lively description of the multitudinous duties of his office but though the case against him was strong, the motion, after a great party debate in which both Pitt and Fox took part, was defeated by 159 to 82. On 20 November 1804, Hope was appointed an ordinary Lord of Session and Lord Justice Clerk in the place of Sir David Rae, Lord Eskgrove, and assuming the title of Lord Granton took his seat on the bench on 6 December 1804. On 12 November 1811, he succeeded Robert Blair, Lord Avontoun as Lord President of the Court of Session, being succeeded as Lord Justice Clerk by David Boyle, Lord Boyle. In 1820, he presided at the special commission for the trial of high treason at Glasgow, and on 17 August 1822 was admitted to the Privy Council at Holyrood House. On 29 July 1823, Hope was appointed, together with his eldest son John, on the Commission of Inquiry into the forms of process and the course of appeals in Scotland. On the death of James Graham, 3rd Duke of Montrose, in December 1836, Hope became Lord Justice General, by virtue of the Court of Session Act 1830,11 Geo. IV and 1 Wm. IV, cap. 69, sec. 18 by which it was enacted that 'after the termination of the present existing interest' that office should 'devolve upon and remain united with the office of lord president of the court of session.' Hope retired from the bench in the autumn of 1841, and was succeeded as Lord President by David Boyle. He died at his home on 12 Moray Place, Edinburgh on 30 October 1851, aged 89. He was buried in the mausoleum at Hopetoun House on 4 November 1851. Assessment Hope was a man of imposing presence, with a magnificent voice, which, according to Lord Cockburn, 'was surpassed by that of the great Mrs. Siddons alone', and a wonderful gift of declamation. Though a violent political partisan, and greatly wanting in tact and judgment, 'his integrity, candour, kindness, and gentlemanlike manners and feelings gained him almost unanimous esteem'. His charges to juries were singularly persuasive and impressive. Lockhart gives a graphic account of Hope's majestic bearing on the bench in 'Peter's Letters to his Kinsfolk' (1819, ii. 102‚Äì8), while recording what he describes 'as without exception the finest piece of judicial eloquence, delivered in the finest possible way by the Lord-president Hope.' When the volunteer movement began, owing to the French war, Hope enlisted as a private in the first regiment of Royal Edinburgh Volunteers. He was afterwards appointed Lieutenant-Colonel of the Corps, and performed the duties of that office with enthusiasm for several years, until the regiment was disbanded for the second time in 1814. In December 1819, when the 'old blues' were once more summoned together, he made them 'one of the most eloquent addresses that ever was heard', and daily inspected the volunteers on duty at Edinburgh Castle while the regular troops were despatched to the western counties. Hope's famous regimental orders of 18 October 1803, containing most curious and minute details, are given at length in Cockburn's 'Memorials'. Family On 8 August 1793 Hope married his cousin Lady Charlotte Hope, second daughter of John Hope, 2nd Earl of Hopetoun, by his third wife, Lady Elizabeth Leslie, second daughter of Alexander, fifth earl of Leven and Melville, by whom he had four sons- of whom the eldest, John (1794‚Äì1858), was Solicitor General for Scotland from 1822 to 1830- and eight daughters. His youngest daughter Ann Wilhelmina was married to Hercules Robertson, Lord Benholme. His wife died at Edinburgh on 22 January 1834, aged 62.

Williams was a Trinidad and Tobago politician until November 2007 and was Member of Parliament for Port of Spain South. Until his resignation from the Cabinet in January 2006, he served as the Minister of Energy and Energy Industries in the then People's National Movement government, a post he had held since December 2001. A geologist and geophysicist by training, Williams entered Parliament in 1995 when he won the Port of Spain South seat formerly held by PNM founder Dr. Eric Williams (no relative). In a now discredited February 2004 letter to then Prime Minister and Political Leader of the PNM Patrick Manning, PNM Councillor Dansam Dhansook alleged that he had paid a TT$75,000 (approx. US$12,000) bribe to Williams in seven separate payments over the period January to July 2003; one of TT$15,000 and six of TT$10,000. The letter was made public on 27 April 2005, when it was read in the House of Representatives by Prime Minister (as of May 2010) Kamla Persad-Bissessar, United National Congress MP for Siparia. Dhansook has since publicly apologised to Mr Williams, his colleague Mr Franklin Khan, and the citizens of Trinidad and Tobago for his role in this entire matter. An article entitled \\"Dhansook says I‚Äôm sorry\\" on Sunday, 13 February 2011, in the Trinidad Sunday Guardian\\"Dhansook says I‚Äôm sorry\\", Trinidad and Tobago Guardian, 13 February 2011. reads in part: \\"'I am sorry.' Former People‚Äôs National Movement councillor, Dansam Dhansook has finally apologised to former PNM ministers Franklin Khan and Eric Williams for the role he played in their wrongful arrests. Acknowledging an apology could never suffice the agony and pain both families endured, a visibly stressed Dhansook said the time had come for him to make amends. 'I want to say sorry to the people that I hurt and I was used to hurt; I am sorry. I am very sad about what I did. I am totally disappointed in myself. I am not looking for any sympathy. I made a mistake by trusting a certain individual and I paid the price for it. 'I want to tell the families of Mr Khan and Williams that I am sorry from the depths of my heart. I want to tell the country sorry...I really made a mistake,' a remorseful Dhansook said in a candid interview with Sunday Guardian last week. Both ministers were hauled before the court on bribery and corruption allegations made by Dhansook. However, Williams was freed due to unreliable evidence and charges were dropped against Khan after investigations revealed a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. Admitting that he feared for his life, the former Ecclesville councillor who said he had made attempts to correct the 'mess,' claimed that because of scare tactics and lies employed by a certain individual he was manipulated and led down a path of no return, 'one lie after another lie.' 'I wanted to come out and say exactly what happened but I was afraid and was being guided. I have lost everything and I have nothing to lie about anymore. I have nothing to hide anymore,' said Dhansook, whose business has collapsed and his family life almost shattered. 'I never bribed Mr Khan or Williams. In fact, I never knew Williams,' he confessed. 'I knew Khan because we were childhood friends. I am sorry for what I did and the hurt I caused,' Dhansook said, as he openly explained the type of business relationship he had shared with Khan. Snr Supt Solomon Koon Koon of the Anti Corruption Investigations Bureau visited Dhansook last week and questioned him in relation to the matter.\\" On 7 January 2006 seven warrants for Williams arrest were issued on a charge of misconduct in public office for corruptly receiving $75,000 in 2003.\\"Energy Minister due in court tomorrow\\" , Wendy Campbell, Trinidad Guardian Williams who maintained his innocence,Juhel Browne, \\"Williams cries false charges\\" , Trinidad Guardian but \\"senior government members\\" predicted correctly that he would resign his ministerial portfolio on 9 January 2006.\\"Energy Minister to resign\\" , Trinidad Guardian On January 9 the seven chargesThe seven charges - Trinidad Express were laid indictably against Williams.

On December 31, 2007, all charges against Mr. Williams were dismissed. His accuser Dansam Dhansook was declared to be 'manifestly unreliable as a witness' by Senior Magistrate L. Cardinez- Ragoonanan who presided over the Preliminary Inquiry into the charges.Onika James, \\"Eric Williams walks free\\", Tuesday, 1 January 2008. ... Earlier, sitting in the Fourth Court, Magistrate Cardenas-Ragoonanan cited several inconsistencies in the prosecution‚Äôs case, the most crucial being that the evidence of its main witness was 'unreliable and inconsistent.' During his testimony, Dhansook, a PNM Councillor and contractor with Terra Seis Seismic Surveys Limited, told the Court that he was at Balisier House when Williams demanded payments from him. However a few moments later Dhansook admitted, when given his original statement to the police to be read out under oath in the court, that on the same day he was at a Christmas party he held for his staff and that he clearly remembered because it was two days before his birthday. Yesterday, Cardenas-Ragoonanan said, ‚ÄúThe fact that Mr Dhansook testified he was in two places at the same time when the plan was hatched, sent red flags of uncertainty. It was impossible that he could be at Balisier House (sic in Port of Spain) and at a staff party in Rio Claro, if by virtue of geography alone.' The Magistrate added, 'I find the evidence tenuous...tenuous indeed, vague, uncertain and definitely not enough for any jury to convict on.' Cardenas-Ragoonanan also ruled that there were several flaws in the allegation itself as there was no documented evidence to support whether payments were made to Williams. 'Mr Dhansook was unable to give specific times and occasions when the payments were allegedly made to Mr Williams, his evidence was tenuous, at worst unbelievable, a jury should not have to speculate. Therefore I find it that no prima facie case can be made out against Mr Williams on Dhansook‚Äôs evidence,' the magistrate said.\\" See also * Franklin Khan References Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Members of the House of Representatives (Trinidad and Tobago) Category:Government ministers of Trinidad and Tobago Category:People's National Movement politicians Category:Alumni of Queen's Royal College, Trinidad Category:Trinidad and Tobago geologists ","title":"Eric A.

In early 1976, as the Moroccan & Mauritanian troops invaded Western Sahara, Daddach fled with some friends trying to reach Tindouf to join the Polisario Front troops (Sahrawi People's Liberation Army), but their jeep was gunned & intercepted by Moroccan troops near Amgala. After two years of imprisonment (first in a military base in Marrakech, then in a subterranean cell), he was forced to join the Moroccan Army. Daddach was again arrested & badly injured in August 1979, when he tried to defect with other soldiers, and sentenced to death on April 7, 1980 for high treason. He was imprisoned in Kenitra prison. Amnesty International designated him a prisoner of conscience, and other human rights organizations also called for his release. In 1994, his death sentence was reduced to life imprisonment, and in 2001, he was freed following a royal amnesty by Mohammed VI of Morocco, who described it as coming from \\"affection for the sons of the Sahara\\".

The film stars Vikram, Suriya, Sangeetha and Laila in the lead roles. Produced by V. A. Durai, the film has cinematography by Balasubramaniem, lyrics are by Vaali, Pazhani Bharathi and Na. Muthukumar, dance has been choreographed by Brindha, editing by Suresh Urs, fights by Stun Siva and art direction by A. C. Pillai. The film's score and soundtrack are composed by Ilayaraaja. The film plot is based on Jayakanthan's Nandhavanathil Oru Andi, the story of an undertaker. Upon release, the film met with critical acclaim and Vikram won the National Film Award for Best Actor for his role as Chithan. Owing to the success, the film was dubbed into Telugu and released as Sivaputrudu (The son of Siva) on 2 April 2004. The film was also remade in Kannada as Anatharu (2007). It was also dubbed in Hindi as same title by B4U Movies.  Plot  An anonymous woman dies while giving birth in a graveyard. Her child, Chithan, is found and raised by the caretaker of the graveyard. Chithan grows up among corpses with minimal human contact and is perhaps more feral than autistic. He growls like a wolf, runs like a gorilla, has the unkempt appearance of an orangutan, but seems to understand loyalty and is (despite his circumstance) a social animal. He ventures into a town in search of food and gets into trouble as he does not understand the concept of money. He is rescued by Gomathi, a petty ganja seller. She sees his ability to be loyal and enrolls him into the service of her employer, a large scale ganja producer. Chithan is caught during a drug raid and is arrested. Sakthi is a conman with a silver tongue. He gets into trouble when he cons a woman named Manju into losing all her personal effects in a game of dice. Sakthi gets sent to jail thanks to Manju's detective work. He meets Chithan in prison and starts protecting him out of sympathy and pity. Chithan starts to reciprocate to Sakthi's kindness with the only way he knows: by being as loyal as a dog. Sakthi serves his term and then butts heads with the ganja producer to get Chithan out of jail. Chithan gets out but commits a crime when he obeys his master's instruction to burn the body of a murder victim. Sakthi, realising that Chithan is being used as accessory in crimes that he cannot comprehend, prevents Chithan from going back to working in the ganja fields. At the same time, a budding romance starts between Sakthi and Manju. Chithan too starts to see a shared spirit in Gomathi. The police catches a wind of the murder and arrests Chithan. Sakthi gets Chithan to side with the police and goes against the ganja producer. The ganja producer later attacks and kills Sakthi and dumps his body in the middle of the road - all of this when Chithan is not around. Chithan does not understand that Sakthi is dead and zones out to outer space when everyone surrounds him. Gomathi, Manju, and the others are crying. Gomathi sees Chithan's confusion as indifference and angrily drives him away from Sakthi's body. Chithan slowly starts to understand that Shakthi is dead as he sees him on the funeral pyre. His realization is complete when he wakes up in the morning next to the burnt remains of Shakthi's corpse. He experiences emotions that he has never experienced before: fury, agony, betrayal, and emotional pain that he has never felt. His body bears the scars of a million bruises, and his violence has always been self-defense and the defense of his masters. This realization of the meaning of death and the pain of losing a loved one breaks the feral chains that had wound up on his psyche. Chithan then sets out like a man intent on destroying the world. He sets fire to the ganja fields, lets the ganja producer experience the pain of his loss, and then sets upon destroying him physically. He drives him through the street, taking his time by breaking a few bones at a time until he is done toying with him. He then kills the ganja producer and offers his body as a tribute to Manju, who now has lost her will to live. Gomathi realizes what Chithan has been through and tries to get him to stay. However, Chithan turns back to the world of the graveyard among the corpses that cannot hurt him anymore.

Balaji Balasubramaniam of Thiraipadam.com reviewed as \\"With unique characterization, tremendous performances and a smooth screenplay, the movie offers a satisfying experience to the discerning viewer...\\" and noted \\"Vikram pretty much lives the role of the undertaker.

Maia contributed to Brazilian music within a wide variety of musical genres, including soul, funk, bossa nova, disco, romantic ballads, pop, rock, jazz, bai√£o and MPB. He introduced the soul style on the Brazilian musical scene. Along with Jorge Ben, Maia pioneered MPB's samba rock genre, combining samba, soul, and funk. He is internationally recognized as one of the biggest icons in Brazilian music. Tim Maia recorded numerous albums and toured extensively in a long career. After his early death in 1998, his recorded oeuvre has shown enduring popularity. A theatrical retrospective of his career, the popular musical Vale Tudo, was first staged in Rio de Janeiro in 2012. Biography =1950s= Maia was born in the Tijuca neighbourhood, in the northern suburbs of Rio de Janeiro. He began writing melodies while still a child, the second youngest of nineteen children. Then known as \\"Ti√£o Maia\\", he wrote his earliest songs at age eight. At fourteen, as a drummer, he formed the group Os Tijucanos do Ritmo, which lasted one year. He then took guitar classes and was soon teaching other children in Tijuca. He also gave lessons to his friends Erasmo Esteves and Roberto Carlos, fellow members of the so-called Matoso Gang. Named after the street where they used to hang out, the gang also included Jorge Ben, among others. They liked to listen to the earliest styles of rock and roll, with both Maia and Ben being nicknamed \\"Babulina\\" after their enthusiastic pronunciation of Ronnie Self's rockabilly song \\"Bop-A-Lena\\". In 1957, Maia, Carlos, Arl√™nio Silva, Edson Trindade and Wellington started the vocal group The Sputniks. After a televised appearance on Carlos Imperial's Clube do Rock on TV Tupi, Imperial arranged a solo appearance for Roberto Carlos the following week. Maia got annoyed at this, leading him to insult Carlos in the following rehearsals until his bandmate left the group. After watching Carlos' concert the following week, Maia left The Sputniks, and went after Imperial for a solo appearance. Imperial eventually suggested another artistic name, Tim, which Maia accepted with reservations. In 1959, Maia went to study in the United States, where he lived for four years. He joined a vocal harmony ensemble, The Ideals, and wrote the lyrics to \\"New Love\\", which was recorded as a demo with guest percussion by a young Milton Banana. (Maia also recorded the song as a soloist in 1973). The group's career was derailed in 1963 when Maia was arrested for possession of marijuana and deported back to Brazil. =1960s= After returning, Maia had a few unsuccessful jobs and arrests in Rio. Eventually he decided to move to S√£o Paulo to try to get help to kickstart his musical career from Carlos, who was beginning to enjoy the massive success of Jovem Guarda with Esteves. Carlos was inaccessible, but Maia started to perform in S√£o Paulo's nightlife and in Wilson Simonal's radio program, and also had a televised appearance at TV Bandeirantes with Os Mutantes. By the end of 1967 Maia managed to send a homemade recording to Carlos, who got Maia a deal for a single at CBS and an appearance on the Jovem Guarda TV program. His first single in 1968, \\"Meu Pa√≠s\\" backed by \\"Sentimento\\", went unnoticed, as was another single, \\"These Are the Songs\\"/\\"What Do You Want to Bet?\\", recorded in English for RGE Discos. Maia also wrote one of Carlos' hits, \\"N√£o Vou Ficar\\".Motta (2007), pp. 54‚Äì71 He became more visible after 1969 when he launched his \\"These Are the Songs,\\" which was re-recorded by Elis Regina in the next year in a duo with Maia. Maia managed a deal with Polydor/Philips and recorded the successful single \\"Primavera\\".Motta (2007), pp. 77‚Äì79 =1970s= National Archives of Brazil. In the 1970s, Maia started to record albums and perform shows promoting his synthesis of American soul and Brazilian music with elements of samba and bai√£o. The movement gradually took the working-class suburbs of the north side of Rio de Janeiro, exploding in 1976 with the black movement. In 1970, Maia recorded his first full-length LP, Tim Maia, which included the classics \\"Azul da Cor do Mar\\", \\"Coron√© Ant√¥nio Bento\\", and \\"Primavera\\", and topped the charts for 24 weeks in Rio de Janeiro. His first four albums were all self-titled. Next year's Tim Maia had other hits including \\"N√£o Quero Dinheiro (S√≥ Quero Amar)\\" and \\"Preciso Aprender a Ser S√≥\\". His fourth album, released in 1973, included \\"R√©u Confesso\\" and \\"Gostava Tanto de Voc√™\\". Angry at how the music publisher distributed the royalties, Maia opened his own, Seroma (derived from the first syllables of his first, middle and last names), to make sure he had a bigger cut of the profits.Motta (2007), p. 70 After his fourth album, Maia left Polydor for RCA Victor, who offered him a chance to record a double album. The instrumental parts were all ready when Maia went to his composing friend Tib√©rio Gaspar for help with the lyrics. In his house Maia found the book Universo em Desencanto (Disenchanting Universe), revolving around the cult of Rational Culture.Motta (2007), p. 127-9 Maia converted to the cult, abandoned the drugs and red meat, and decided to write the lyrics for the songs about the knowledge contained in the book. RCA rejected the albums Tim Maia Racional, Vols. 1 & 2 for the newly found spiritual content, but Maia bought the master tapes from them and released the albums independently through label Seroma Discos, which would split its profits with the cult. While the lead single \\"Que Beleza (Imuniza√ß√£o Racional)\\" had some airplay, at the time these records were not well received, due to inadequate distribution, and the spiritual content alienating both the radios and Maia's fans. Eventually, the artist could only perform at events promoted by the Rational Culture. Eventually in 1975, Maia got fed up with the cult, destroyed the unsold records and went back to his carefree life.Slater, Russ. \\"Tim Maia's Journey into Rational Culture\\" Sounds and Colours, July 7, 2010. Retrieved on 2014-11-05Motta (2007), p. 132-143 The Racional albums are now regarded as classics and saw re-release in 2005. For his return in 1976, Maia signed with Polygram and recorded an album also titled Tim Maia, which included the hit \\"Rod√©sia\\" (inspired by the Rhodesian Bush War), and also did a self-published album in English.Motta (2007), p. 146-156 In 1977 Maia signed with Som Livre, where he recorded the album Ver√£o Carioca.Motta (2007), p. 160-1 In 1978 Maia signed with Warner Bros. Records and incorporated the disco sound of the period in the album Tim Maia Disco Club, which spawned the hits \\"Sossego\\" and \\"Acenda o Farol\\".Motta (2007), p. 165-7 In 1979 Maia recorded Reencontro for EMI-Odeon, but revolted at the label's estimated promotion costs which were the same as the money spent recording, Maia fought with the marketing executive, and in response EMI president fired Maia, releasing the album with no publicity to low sales.Motta (2007), p. 173-5 =1980s and 1990s= In 1980, Maia recorded another self-titled album for Polygram. The following year, with turbulent passages through all the major labels in Brazil, Maia released again through Seroma the album Nuvens, which flopped due to inefficient distribution. To earn cash for his future albums, Maia was a guest in songs by Fevers, Edu Lobo and Chico Buarque, Ivan Lins and Sandra de S√°. His collaboration with S√°, \\"Vale Tudo\\", later became a solo hit for Maia.Motta (2007), p. 184-189 In 1983 he had hits with \\"O Descobridor dos Sete Mares\\" and \\"Me D√™ Motivo\\", included on O Descobridor dos Sete Mares (Polygram). Another milestone of his career in the 1980s was Tim Maia (1986), which had the hit \\"Do Leme ao Pontal (Tomo Guaran√°, Suco de Caju, Goiabada Para Sobremesa)\\". In 1990, Maia saw Caetano Veloso's songbook and asked editor Almir Chediak to do one for his own work. Chediak was working on such an album with bossa nova classics, and Maia requested a copy, which eventually inspired him to do a self-released album of bossa nova covers, Tim Maia Interpreta Cl√°ssicos da Bossa Nova.Motta (2007), p. 286-9 After a period of poor presence in the media, he was again on top after being mentioned by Jorge Ben Jor's \\"W/Brasil\\" in 1991. In the same period, Maia had another hit with his re-recording of Lulu Santos' \\"Como uma Onda\\" for a television advertisement ‚Äì Santos in return recorded Maia's \\"Descobridor dos Sete Mares. At the same time, he withdrew from majors, recording his next albums through Vit√≥ria R√©gia, including What a Wonderful World (1997), where he recorded American pop/soul classics, and Amigos do Rei/Tim Maia e Os Cariocas, with the famous vocal group. Obese and in bad health, in March 8, 1998 he was performing at the Municipal Theater of Niter√≥i when he became ill. He was hospitalized and died a few days later.Tim Maia morre aos 55 anos, no Rio, Jornal do Commercio  Personal life  L√©o Maia, Tim's adoptive son, also became a musician. Maia lived in the United States of America from 1959 to 1963. He first resided in Tarrytown, New York, with the family of an acquaintance of Maia's father's costumer. There he learned English and did not speak much Portuguese because so few Brazilians were living in the US at the time. In 1961, Maia moved to New York City, and, in 1963, with a group of three friends, decided to travel to Southern United States. With a stolen car and performing small thefts to finance the journey (which got him arrested five times), Maia and friends traveled through nine states before arriving in Florida. In Daytona Beach, Maia had his final imprisonment for marijuana possession, which earned him deportation back to Brazil.Motta (2007), pp. 40‚Äì51 He had three sons. The first was Jos√© Carlos da Silva Nogueira (b. 1966). Maia only met Nogueira when he was already 15. Maia never legally recognized Nogueira as a son, but the two reportedly had a good relationship. A sister of Maia claims that, once he found out about Nogueira, he allowed the boy to live in one of his properties and helped him financially. Nogueira was shot and killed in 2002, in Barra da Tijuca, Rio de Janeiro, four years after Maia's death. Maia had a live-in girlfriend, Maria de Jesus \\"Geisa\\" Gomes da Silva. After some time together, they broke up. When they made up, she was pregnant with a boy, whose father refused to recognize the child as his. Maia then adopted the boy, Marcio Leonardo \\"L√©o\\" Maia (b. 1974). Afterwards, Maia and Geisa married and had another son, Carmelo \\"Telmo\\" Maia (b. 1975). When L√©o was 12, Tim Maia and Geisa divorced.Pol√≠cia come√ßa a investigar assassinato de filho de Tim Maia, O Estado de S.

He was rumoured to have joined the party in order to run for a seat in the Federal Senate for Rio de Janeiro in the 1998 general elections, but died before that. When asked by a reporter why he chose to join the then small PSB, he replied: \\"Brazil is the only country where ‚Äì in addition to whores cumming, pimps being jealous and drug dealers being addicted ‚Äì poor people vote for the right-wing\\". His phrase would become a famous aphorism on the way Brazilians face politics. He was also known for his easygoing lifestyle, and for his habit of lightheartedly missing appointments and even important gigs. Indeed, Maia had a tradition of arriving late at concerts, at times missing them altogether. He also frequently complained about the sound quality in them. Many of his missed concerts were due to what he called his \\"triathlon\\": consuming whiskey, cocaine and marijuana before a gig.140 quilos de som e transgress√£o , Veja Towards the end of his life, Tim Maia suffered from many health problems, which included diabetes, acute hypertension, obesity and pulmonary embolism.

Deliba≈°iƒá was named one of FIBA's 50 Greatest Players in 1991. He was enshrined into the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2007. In 2008, he was named one of the 50 Greatest EuroLeague Contributors. He is widely considered as one of the best shooters in the history of European basketball. Early life Born in Tuzla, PR Bosnia and Herzegovina, to Bosniak parents Izet Deliba≈°iƒá and Zajkana (n√©e Mehiƒçeviƒá), young Mirza took up tennis and excelled at it. By the age of fourteen, he switched to basketball. Club career Mirza Deliba≈°iƒá, nicknamed Kinƒëe, led his club Bosna to the EuroLeague Championship in 1979. He played his first games at age of 15 for KK Sloboda Dita, Tuzla's basketball club. Three years later, in 1971, he signed a contract with KK Bosna. After leaving Bosna, Deliba≈°iƒá went to the Spanish Primera Divisi√≥n, where he ended up being considered one of the best players ever to play for Real Madrid, along with the likes of Juan Corbal√°n, Wayne Brabender, Fernando Mart√≠n Espina, Fernando Romay, Dra≈æen Petroviƒá, and Arvydas Sabonis. In his club career, he won numerous titles in European club competitions. In addition to having played together for their Yugoslav national team, Mirza Deliba≈°iƒá and Dra≈æen Dalipagiƒá, also played together with Real Madrid. Their performance in a 1983 EuroLeague game versus Cibona, in Zagreb, is only one of the many highlights of their careers. In that game, Deliba≈°iƒá scored 26 points and Dalipagiƒá 33. The game appropriately finished with a two-on-one fast-break, with Deliba≈°iƒá making a behind-the-back fake pass to Dalipagiƒá, and passing by a defender for a two-handed dunk at the buzzer. Cibona's fans put aside their team's loss in the game, and showed their appreciation for the Bosnian stars performances, with a standing ovation at the end of the game. =Career ending= In early summer 1983, the then twenty-nine-year-old Deliba≈°iƒá left Real Madrid and signed with the Italian League club JuveCaserta, which was at the time coached by his former Bosna mentor Bogdan Tanjeviƒá. In August 1983, the team went to preseason training and conditioning, to the town of Bormio, in the Italian Alps. After coming back south to Caserta, following the grueling altitude training, Deliba≈°iƒá suffered a near-fatal brain hemorrhage that would turn out to be career- ending.

It was an herbivore that walked both as a biped and as a quadruped. Three species are universally recognized: P. walkeri (the type species), P. tubicen, and the short-crested P. cyrtocristatus. Additionally, a fourth species, P. jiayensis, has been proposed, although it is more commonly placed in the separate genus Charonosaurus. Remains are known from Alberta (Canada), New Mexico and Utah (United States), and possibly Heilongjiang, (China). The genus was first described in 1922 by William Parks from a skull and partial skeleton found in Alberta. Parasaurolophus was a hadrosaurid, part of a diverse family of Cretaceous dinosaurs known for their range of bizarre head adornments. This genus is known for its large, elaborate cranial crest, which at its largest forms a long curved tube projecting upwards and back from the skull. Charonosaurus from China, which may have been its closest relative, had a similar skull and potentially a similar crest. Visual recognition of both species and sex, acoustic resonance, and thermoregulation have been proposed as functional explanations for the crest. It is one of the rarer hadrosaurids, known from only a handful of good specimens. Discovery and naming Holotype specimen of P. walkeri, showing the pathologic v-shaped notch Meaning \\"near crested lizard\\", the name Parasaurolophus is derived from the Greek para/œÄŒ±œÅŒ± \\"beside\\" or \\"near\\", saurus/œÉŒ±œÖœÅŒøœÇ \\"lizard\\" and lophos/ŒªŒøœÜŒøœÇ \\"crest\\". It is based on ROM 768, a skull and partial skeleton missing most of the tail and the hind legs below the knees, which was found by a field party from the University of Toronto in 1920 near Sand Creek along the Red Deer River in Alberta, Canada. These rocks are now known as the Campanian- age Upper Cretaceous Dinosaur Park Formation. William Parks named the specimen P. walkeri in honor of Sir Byron Edmund Walker, Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Royal Ontario Museum. Parasaurolophus remains are rare in Alberta, with only one other partial skull from (probably) the Dinosaur Park Formation, and three Dinosaur Park specimens lacking skulls, possibly belonging to the genus. In some faunal lists, there is a mention of possible P. walkeri material in the Hell Creek Formation of Montana, a rock unit of late Maastrichtian age. This occurrence is not noted by Sullivan and Williamson in their 1999 review of the genus, and has not been further elaborated upon elsewhere. In 1921, Charles H. Sternberg recovered a partial skull (PMU.R1250) from what is now known as the slightly younger Kirtland Formation in San Juan County, New Mexico. This specimen was sent to Uppsala, Sweden, where Carl Wiman described it as a second species, P. tubicen, in 1931. The specific epithet is derived from the Latin t«îb«êcƒõn \\"trumpeter\\". A second, nearly complete P. tubicen skull (NMMNH P-25100) was found in New Mexico in 1995. Using computed tomography of this skull, Robert Sullivan and Thomas Williamson gave the genus a monographic treatment in 1999, covering aspects of its anatomy and taxonomy, and the functions of its crest. Williamson later published an independent review of the remains, disagreeing with the taxonomic conclusions. John Ostrom described another good specimen (FMNH P27393) from New Mexico as P. cyrtocristatus in 1961. It includes a partial skull with a short, rounded crest, and much of the postcranial skeleton except for the feet, neck, and parts of the tail. Its specific name is derived from the Latin curtus \\"shortened\\" and cristatus \\"crested\\". The specimen was found in either the top of the Fruitland Formation or, more likely, the base of the overlying Kirtland Formation. The range of this species was expanded in 1979, when David B. Weishampel and James A. Jensen described a partial skull with a similar crest (BYU 2467) from the Campanian- age Kaiparowits Formation of Garfield County, Utah. Since then, another skull has been found in Utah with the short/round P. cyrtocristatus crest morphology. =Species= Cast of the P. tubicen holotype crest Parasaurolophus is known from three certain species, P. walkeri, P. tubicen, and P. cyrtocristatus. All of them can be distinguished from each other, and have many differences. The first named species, therefore the type, is P. walkeri. One certain specimen, from the Dinosaur Park Formation is referred to it, but many more are almost certainly referable. Like stated above, it is different from the other two species, with it having a simpler internal structure than P. tubicen, a straighter crest and different internal structuring than P. cyrtocristatus. The next named species is P. tubicen, which is the largest of the Parasaurolophus species. It lived in New Mexico, where three specimens are known, and can be differentiated from its other species. It possesses a long and straight crest, with a very complex interior compared to the other species. All known specimens of P. tubicen come from the De-Na-Zin Member of the Kirtland Formation. In 1961, the third species, P. cyrtocristatus was named by John Ostrom. Its three known specimens, have been found in the Fruitland and Kaiparowits formations from Utah and New Mexico. The second specimen, the first known from the Kaiparowits Formation, was originally unassigned to a specific taxon. Of the Parasaurolophus species, P. cyrtocristatus it is the smallest, and has the most curved crest. Because of its possession of the two above features, it has often been speculated that it was a female of P. walkeri or P. tubicen, which were males, although P. tubicen lived approximately a million years later. As noted by Thomas Williamson, the type material of P. cyrtocristatus is about 72% the size of P. tubicen, close to the size at which other lambeosaurines are interpreted to begin showing definitive sexual dimorphism in their crests (~70% of adult size). Even though many scientists have supported the possible fact of P. cyrtocristatus being a female, many other studies have found that it is not, because of the differences in age, distribution, and the large differences in the crest and its internal structure. A study published in PLoS ONE in 2014 found that one more species could be referred to Parasaurolophus. This study, led by Xing, found Charonosaurus jiayensis was actually nested deeply inside Parasaurolophus, which created the new species P. jiayensis. If this species is indeed inside Parasaurolophus, then the genus lasted until the K-Pg extinction, and is known from two continents. Description Size comparison of P. cyrtocristatus (left, violet) and P. walkeri (right, blue) Restoration of P. walkeri Like most dinosaurs, the skeleton of Parasaurolophus is incompletely known. The length of the type specimen of P. walkeri is estimated at , and its weight is estimated at . Its skull is about long, including the crest, whereas the type skull of P. tubicen is over long, indicating a larger animal. Its single known forelimb was relatively short for a hadrosaurid, with a short but wide shoulder blade. The thighbone measures long in P. walkeri and is robust for its length when compared to other hadrosaurids. The upper arm and pelvic bones were also heavily built. Like other hadrosaurids, it was able to walk on either two legs or four. It probably preferred to forage for food on four legs, but ran on two. The neural spines of the vertebrae were tall, as was common in lambeosaurines; tallest over the hips, they increased the height of the back. Skin impressions are known for P. walkeri, showing uniform tubercle-like scales but no larger structures. =Skull= P. walkeri skull cast The most noticeable feature was the cranial crest, which protruded from the rear of the head and was made up of the premaxilla and nasal bones. William Parks, who named the genus, hypothesized that a ligament ran from the crest to the notch to support the head, and cited the presence of a possibly pathological notch as evidence. Although this idea seems unlikely, Parasaurolophus is sometimes restored with a skin flap from the crest to the neck. The crest was hollow, with distinct tubes leading from each nostril to the end of the crest before reversing direction and heading back down the crest and into the skull. The tubes were simplest in P. walkeri, and more complex in P. tubicen, where some tubes were blind and others met and separated. While P. walkeri and P. tubicen had long crests with only slight curvature, P. cyrtocristatus had a short crest with a more circular profile. Classification As its name implies, Parasaurolophus was initially thought to be closely related to Saurolophus because of its superficially similar crest. However, it was soon reassessed as a member of the lambeosaurine subfamily of hadrosaurids‚ÄîSaurolophus is a hadrosaurine. It is usually interpreted as a separate offshoot of the lambeosaurines, distinct from the helmet-crested Corythosaurus, Hypacrosaurus, and Lambeosaurus. Its closest known relative appears to be Charonosaurus, a lambeosaurine with a similar skull (but no complete crest yet) from the Amur region of northeastern China, and the two may form a clade Parasaurolophini. P. cyrtocristatus, with its short, rounder crest, may be the most basal of the three known Parasaurolophus species, or it may represent subadult or female specimens of P. tubicen. Comparison drawing between the crests of P. cyrtocristatus (above) and P. walkeri (below) The following cladogram is after the 2007 redescription of Lambeosaurus magnicristatus (Evans and Reisz, 2007): Paleobiology P. walkeri head with scalation detail. =Diet and feeding= As a hadrosaurid, Parasaurolophus was a large bipedal/quadrupedal herbivore, eating plants with a sophisticated skull that permitted a grinding motion analogous to chewing. Its teeth were continually being replaced; they were packed into dental batteries containing hundreds of teeth, only a relative handful of which were in use at any time. It used its beak to crop plant material, which was held in the jaws by a cheek-like organ. Vegetation could have been taken from the ground up to a height of around . As noted by Bob Bakker, lambeosaurines have narrower beaks than hadrosaurines, implying that Parasaurolophus and its relatives could feed more selectively than their broad-beaked, crestless counterparts. =Growth= Juvenile skeleton RAM 14000 Parasaurolophus is known from many adult specimens, and a juvenile described in 2013. The juvenile was discovered in the Kaiparowits Formation in 2009. Excavated by the joint expedition by The Webb Schools and Raymond M. Alf Museum of Paleontology (RAM), the juvenile has been identified as around only one year old when it died. Referred to Parasaurolophus sp., the juvenile, under specimen number RAM 14000, is the most complete, as well as youngest Parasaurolophus ever found, and measures . This individual fits neatly into the currently known Parasaurolophus growth stages, and lived approximately 75 million years ago. Even though no complete skull of the intermediate age between RAM 14000 and adult Parasaurolophus has been found yet, a partial braincase of about the right size is known. At 25% of the total adult size, the juvenile show that crest growth of Parasaurolophus began sooner than in related genera, such as Corythosaurus. It has been suggested that Parasaurolophus adults bore such large crests, especially when compared to the related Corythosaurus, because of this difference in age between when their crests started developing. Its age also means that Parasaurolophus had a very fast growth rate, which took place in about a year. The crest of the juvenile is not long and tubular like the adults, but low and hemispherical. Reconstruction of a juvenile skeleton, based on RAM 14000 The skull of RAM 14000 is almost complete, with the left side only lacking a piece of the maxilla. However, the skull was split down the middle by erosion, possibly when it was resting on the bottom of a river bed. The two sides are displaced slightly, with some bones of the right being moved off the main block, also by erosion. After reconstruction, the skull viewed from the side resembles other juvenile lambeosaurines found, being roughly a trapezoid in shape. A partial cranial endocast for RAM 14000 was reconstructed from CT scan data, the first ever for a Parasaurolophus of any ontogenetic stage. The endocast was reconstructed in two sections, one on the portion of the braincase articulated with the left half of the skull and the remainder on the disarticulated portion of the braincase. Their relative position was then approximated based on cranial landmarks and comparison with other hadrosaurids. Because of weathering, many of the smaller neural canals and foramina could not be identified for certain. =Cranial crest= Diagram showing internal features of the crest Many hypotheses have been advanced as to what functions the cranial crest of Parasaurolophus performed, but most have been discredited. It is now believed that it may have had several functions: visual display for identifying species and sex, sound amplification for communication, and thermoregulation. It is not clear which was most significant at what times in the evolution of the crest and its internal nasal passages. Differences in crests As for other lambeosaurines, it is believed that the cranial crest of Parasaurolophus changed with age and was a sexually dimorphic characteristic in adults. James Hopson, one of the first researchers to describe lambeosaurine crests in terms of such distinctions, suggested that P. cyrtocristatus, with its small crest, was the female form of P. tubicen. Thomas Williamson suggested it was the juvenile form. Neither hypothesis became widely accepted. As only six good skulls, one juvenile braincase, and one recently discovered juvenile skull are known, additional material will help clear up these potential relationships. Williamson noted that in any case, juvenile Parasaurolophus probably had small, rounded crests like P. cyrtocristatus, that probably grew faster as individuals approached sexual maturity. Recent restudy of a juvenile braincase previously assigned to Lambeosaurus, now assigned to Parasaurolophus, provides evidence that a small tubular crest was present in juveniles. This specimen preserves a small upward flaring of the frontal bones that was similar to but smaller than what is seen in adult specimens; in adults, the frontals formed a platform that supported the base of the crest. This specimen also indicates that the growth of the crest in Parasaurolophus and the facial profile of juvenile individuals differed from the Corythosaurus-Hypacrosaurus-Lambeosaurus model, in part because the crest of Parasaurolophus lacks the thin bony 'coxcomb' that makes up the upper portion of the crest of the other three lambeosaurines. Rejected function hypotheses Many early suggestions focused on adaptations for an aquatic lifestyle, following the hypothesis that hadrosaurids were amphibious, a common line of thought until the 1960s. Thus, Alfred Sherwood Romer proposed it served as a snorkel, Martin Wilfarth that it was an attachment for a mobile proboscis used as a breathing tube or for food gathering, Charles M. Sternberg that it served as an airtrap to keep water out of the lungs, and Ned Colbert that it served as an air reservoir for prolonged stays underwater. Other proposals were more physical in nature. As mentioned above, William Parks suggested that it was joined to the vertebrae with ligaments or muscles, and helped with moving and supporting the head. Othenio Abel proposed it was used as a weapon in combat among members of the same species, and Andrew Milner suggested that it could be used as a foliage deflector, like the helmet crest (called a 'casque') of the cassowary. Still, other proposals made housing specialized organs the major function. Halszka Osm√≥lska suggested that it housed salt glands, and John Ostrom suggested that it housed expanded areas for olfactory tissue and much improved sense of smell of the lambeosaurines, which had no obvious defensive capabilities. Most of these hypotheses have been discredited or rejected. For example, there is no hole at the end of the crest for a snorkeling function. There are no muscle scars for a proboscis and it is dubious that an animal with a beak would need one. As a proposed airlock, it would not have kept out water. The proposed air reservoir would have been insufficient for an animal the size of Parasaurolophus. Other hadrosaurids had large heads without needing large hollow crests to serve as attachment points for supporting ligaments. Also, none of the proposals explain why the crest has such a shape, why other lambeosaurines should have crests that look much different but perform a similar function, how crestless or solid-crested hadrosaurids got along without such capabilities, or why some hadrosaurids had solid crests. These considerations particularly impact hypotheses based on increasing the capabilities of systems already present in the animal, such as the salt gland and olfaction hypotheses, and indicate that these were not primary functions of the crest. Additionally, work on the nasal cavity of lambeosaurines shows that olfactory nerves and corresponding sensory tissue were largely outside the portion of the nasal passages in the crest, so the expansion of the crest had little to do with the sense of smell. Temperature regulation hypothesis The large surface area and vascularization of the crest also suggests a thermoregulatory function. The first to propose the cranial crests of lambeosaurines related to temperature regulation was Wheeler (1978). He proposed that there was a nerve connection between the crest and the brain, so that the latter could be cooled by the former. The next people to publish a related idea were Teresa Marya≈Ñska and Osm√≥lska, who realized that like modern lizards, dinosaurs could have possessed salt glands, and cooled off by osmo- regulation. In 2006 Evans published an argument about the functions of lambeosaurine crests, and supported why this could be a causing factor for the evolution of the crest. Behavioural hypotheses Restoration of P. walkeri with hypothetical skin frill Parasaurolophus is often hypothesized to have used its crest as a resonating chamber to produce low frequency sounds to alert other members of a group or its species. This function was originally suggested by Wiman in 1931 when he described P. tubicen. He noted that the crest's internal structures are similar to those of a swan and theorized that an animal could use its elongated nasal passages to create noise. However, the nasal tubes of Hypacrosaurus, Corythosaurus, and Lambeosaurus are much more variable and complicated than the airway of Parasaurolophus. A large amount of material and data supports the hypothesis that the large, tubular crest of Parasaurolophus was a resonating chamber. Weishampel in 1981 suggested that Parasaurolophus made noises ranging between the frequencies 55 and 720 Hz, although there was some difference in the range of individual species because of the crest size, shape, and nasal passage length, most obvious in P. cyrtocristatus (interpreted as a possible female). Hopson found that there is anatomical evidence that hadrosaurids had a strong hearing. There is at least one example, in the related Corythosaurus, of a slender stapes (reptilian ear bone) in place, which combined with a large space for an eardrum implies a sensitive middle ear. Furthermore, the hadrosaurid lagena is elongate like a crocodilian's, indicating that the auditory portion of the inner ear was well- developed. Based on the similarity of hadrosaurid inner ears to those of crocodiles, he also proposed that adult hadrosaurids were sensitive to high frequencies, such as their offspring might produce. According to Weishampel, this is consistent with parents and offspring communicating. Computer modeling of a well-preserved specimen of P. tubicen, with more complex air passages than those of P. walkeri, has allowed the reconstruction of the possible sound its crest produced. The main path resonates at around 30 Hz, but the complicated sinus anatomy causes peaks and valleys in the sound. The other main behavioral theory is that the crest was used for intra-species recognition. This means that the crest could have been used for species recognition, as a warning signal, and for other, non-sexual uses. These could have been some of the reasons crests evolved in Parasaurolophus and other hadrosaurids. Instead, social and physiological functions have become more supported as function(s) of the crest, focusing on visual and auditory identification and communication. As a large object, the crest has clear value as a visual signal and sets this animal apart from its contemporaries. The large size of hadrosaurid eye sockets and the presence of sclerotic rings in the eyes imply acute vision and diurnal habits, evidence that sight was important to these animals. If, as is commonly illustrated, a skin frill extended from the crest to the neck or back, the proposed visual display would have been even showier. As is suggested by other lambeosaurine skulls, the crest of Parasaurolophus likely permitted both species identification (such as separating it from Corythosaurus or Lambeosaurus) and sexual identification by shape and size. =Paleopathology= Parasaurolophus walkeri is known from one specimen which might contain a pathology. The skeleton shows a v-shaped gap or notch in the vertebrae at the base of the neck. Originally thought to be pathologic, Parks published a second interpretation of this, as a ligament attachment to support the head. The crest would attach to the gap via muscles or ligaments, and be used to support the head while bearing a frill, like predicted to exist in some hadrosaurids. One other possibility, is that during preparation, the specimen was damaged, creating the possible pathology. The notch, however, is still considered more likely to be a pathology, even though some illustrations of Parasaurolophus restore the skin flap. Another possible pathology was noticed by Parks, and from around the notch. In the fourth, fifth, and sixth vertebrae, directly anterior to the notch, the neural spines were damaged. The fourth had an obvious fracture, with the other two possessing a swelling at the base of the break. Paleoecology =Alberta= Locations of fossil finds, written in French. Parasaurolophus walkeri, from the Dinosaur Park Formation, was a member of a diverse and well-documented fauna of prehistoric animals, including well-known dinosaurs such as the horned Centrosaurus, Chasmosaurus, and Styracosaurus; fellow duckbills Gryposaurus and Corythosaurus; tyrannosaurid Gorgosaurus; and armored Edmontonia, Euoplocephalus and Dyoplosaurus. It was a rare constituent of this fauna. The Dinosaur Park Formation is interpreted as a low-relief setting of rivers and floodplains that became more swampy and influenced by marine conditions over time as the Western Interior Seaway transgressed westward. The climate was warmer than present-day Alberta, without frost, but with wetter and drier seasons. Conifers were apparently the dominant canopy plants, with an understory of ferns, tree ferns, and angiosperms. Some of the less common hadrosaurs in the Dinosaur Park Formation of Dinosaur Provincial Park, such as Parasaurolophus, may represent the remains of individuals who died while migrating through the region. They might also have had a more upland habitat where they may have nested or fed. The presence of Parasaurolophus and Kritosaurus in northern latitude fossil sites may represent faunal exchange between otherwise distinct northern and southern biomes in Late Cretaceous North America. Both taxa are uncommon outside of the southern biome, where, along with Pentaceratops, they are predominate members of the fauna. =New Mexico= Teratophoneus attacking a P. cyrtocristatus In the Fruitland Formation of New Mexico, P. cyrtocristatus shared its habitat with other ornithischians and theropods. Specifically, its contemporaries were the ceratopsian Pentaceratops sternbergii; the pachycephalosaur Stegoceras novomexicanum; and some unidentified fossils belonging to Tyrannosauridae, ?Ornithomimus, ?Troodontidae, ?Saurornitholestes langstoni, ?Struthiomimus, Ornithopoda, ?Chasmosaurus, ?Corythosaurus, Hadrosaurinae, Hadrosauridae, and Ceratopsidae. When Parasaurolophus existed, the Fruitland Formation was swampy, positioned in the lowlands, and close to the shore of the Cretaceous Interior Seaway. The lowermost part of the Fruitland Formation is just younger than 75.56 ¬± 0.41 mya, with the uppermost boundary dating to 74.55 ¬± 0.22 mya. Existing slightly later than the species from the Fruitland Formation, P. tubicen is also found in New Mexico, in the Kirtland Formation. Numerous vertebrate groups are from this formation, including fishes, crurotarsans, ornithischians, saurischians, pterosaurs, and turtles. The fishes are represented by the two species Melvius chauliodous and Myledalphus bipartitus. The crurotarsans include Brachychampsa montana and Denazinosuchus kirtlandicus. Ornithischians from the formation are represented by the hadrosaurids Anasazisaurus horneri, Naashoibitosaurus ostromi, Kritosaurus navajovius, and P. tubicen; the ankylosaurids Ahshislepelta minor and Nodocephalosaurus kirtlandensis; the ceratopsians Pentaceratops sternbergii and Titanoceratops ouranos; and the pachycephalosaurs Stegoceras novomexicanum and Sphaerotholus goodwini. Saurischians include the tyrannosaurid Bistahieversor sealeyi; the ornithomimid Ornithomimus sp.; and the troodontid \\"Saurornitholestes\\" robustus. One pterosaur is known, named Navajodactylus boerei. Turtles are fairly plentiful, and are known from Denazinemys nodosa, Basilemys nobilis, Neurankylus baueri, Plastomenus robustus. and Thescelus hemispherica. Unidentified taxa are known, including the crurotarsan ?Leidyosuchus, and the theropods ?Struthiomimus, Troodontidae and Tyrannosauridae. The beginning of the Kirtland Formation dates to 74.55 ¬± 0.22 mya, with the formation ending at around 73.05 ¬± 0.25 mya. =Utah= Argon- argon radiometric dating indicates that the Kaiparowits Formation was deposited between 76.6 and 74.5 million years ago, during the Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous period. During the Late Cretaceous period, the site of the Kaiparowits Formation was located near the western shore of the Western Interior Seaway, a large inland sea that split North America into two landmasses, Laramidia to the west and Appalachia to the east. The plateau where dinosaurs lived was an ancient floodplain dominated by large channels and abundant wetland peat swamps, ponds and lakes, and was bordered by highlands. The climate was wet and humid, and supported an abundant and diverse range of organisms. This formation contains one of the best and most continuous records of Late Cretaceous terrestrial life in the world. Parasaurolophus shared its paleoenvironment with other dinosaurs, such as dromaeosaurid theropods, the troodontid Talos sampsoni, ornithomimids like Ornithomimus velox, tyrannosaurids like Albertosaurus and Teratophoneus, armored ankylosaurids, the duckbilled hadrosaur Gryposaurus monumentensis, the ceratopsians Utahceratops gettyi, Nasutoceratops titusi and Kosmoceratops richardsoni and the oviraptorosaurian Hagryphus giganteus. Paleofauna present in the Kaiparowits Formation included chondrichthyans (sharks and rays), frogs, salamanders, turtles, lizards and crocodilians. A variety of early mammals were present including multituberculates, marsupials, and insectivorans.

Overview The classical objects of interest in arithmetic geometry are rational points: sets of solutions of a system of polynomial equations over number fields, finite fields, p-adic fields, or function fields, i.e. fields that are not algebraically closed excluding the real numbers. Rational points can be directly characterized by height functions which measure their arithmetic complexity. The structure of algebraic varieties defined over non-algebraically-closed fields has become a central area of interest that arose with the modern abstract development of algebraic geometry. Over finite fields, √©tale cohomology provides topological invariants associated to algebraic varieties. p-adic Hodge theory gives tools to examine when cohomological properties of varieties over the complex numbers extend to those over p-adic fields. History =19th century: early arithmetic geometry= In the early 19th century, Carl Friedrich Gauss observed that non- zero integer solutions to homogeneous polynomial equations with rational coefficients exist if non-zero rational solutions exist. In the 1850s, Leopold Kronecker formulated the Kronecker‚ÄìWeber theorem, introduced the theory of divisors, and made numerous other connections between number theory and algebra. He then conjectured his \\"liebster Jugendtraum\\" (\\"dearest dream of youth\\"), a generalization that was later put forward by Hilbert in a modified form as his twelfth problem, which outlines a goal to have number theory operate only with rings that are quotients of polynomial rings over the integers. =Early-to-mid 20th century: algebraic developments and the Weil conjectures= In the late 1920s, Andr√© Weil demonstrated profound connections between algebraic geometry and number theory with his doctoral work leading to the Mordell‚ÄìWeil theorem which demonstrates that the set of rational points of an abelian variety is a finitely generated abelian group.A. Weil, L'arithm√©tique sur les courbes alg√©briques, Acta Math 52, (1929) p. 281-315, reprinted in vol 1 of his collected papers . Modern foundations of algebraic geometry were developed based on contemporary commutative algebra, including valuation theory and the theory of ideals by Oscar Zariski and others in the 1930s and 1940s. In 1949, Andr√© Weil posed the landmark Weil conjectures about the local zeta-functions of algebraic varieties over finite fields. Reprinted in Oeuvres Scientifiques/Collected Papers by Andr√© Weil These conjectures offered a framework between algebraic geometry and number theory that propelled Alexander Grothendieck to recast the foundations making use of sheaf theory (together with Jean-Pierre Serre), and later scheme theory, in the 1950s and 1960s. Bernard Dwork proved one of the four Weil conjectures (rationality of the local zeta function) in 1960. Grothendieck developed √©tale cohomology theory to prove two of the Weil conjectures (together with Michael Artin and Jean-Louis Verdier) by 1965. The last of the Weil conjectures (an analogue of the Riemann hypothesis) would be finally proven in 1974 by Pierre Deligne. =Mid-to-late 20th century: developments in modularity, p-adic methods, and beyond= Between 1956 and 1957, Yutaka Taniyama and Goro Shimura posed the Taniyama‚ÄìShimura conjecture (now known as the modularity theorem) relating elliptic curves to modular forms. This connection would ultimately lead to the first proof of Fermat's Last Theorem in number theory through algebraic geometry techniques of modularity lifting developed by Andrew Wiles in 1995. In the 1960s, Goro Shimura introduced Shimura varieties as generalizations of modular curves. Since the 1979, Shimura varieties have played a crucial role in the Langlands program as a natural realm of examples for testing conjectures. In papers in 1977 and 1978, Barry Mazur proved the torsion conjecture giving a complete list of the possible torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over the rational numbers. Mazur's first proof of this theorem depended upon a complete analysis of the rational points on certain modular curves. In 1996, the proof of the torsion conjecture was extended to all number fields by Lo√Øc Merel. In 1983, Gerd Faltings proved the Mordell conjecture, demonstrating that a curve of genus greater than 1 has only finitely many rational points (where the Mordell‚ÄìWeil theorem only demonstrates finite generation of the set of rational points as opposed to finiteness). In 2001, the proof of the local Langlands conjectures for GLn was based on the geometry of certain Shimura varieties. In the 2010s, Peter Scholze developed perfectoid spaces and new cohomology theories in arithmetic geometry over p-adic fields with application to Galois representations and certain cases of the weight-monodromy conjecture.

Halton Region encompasses the City of Burlington and the Towns of Oakville, Milton and Halton Hills. As of July, 2020, the Halton Regional Police Service has over 1,000 members, including 718 sworn police officers and approximately 302 civilian and volunteer members. The service is responsible for policing a population of approximately 610,000 people in an area covering 692 square kilometers. The chief of police is the highest-ranking officer of the Halton Regional Police Service. The position belongs to Stephen J. Tanner, who began his term on September 1, 2012, and was sworn in on September 4. The Chief reports to the seven-person Halton Police Board which is independent from Regional or Municipal Council. History A Halton Regional Police car with the black and white colour scheme parked at a crime scene The Halton Regional Police Service was established in tandem with the creation of the Regional Municipality of Halton on January 1, 1974. It incorporated the former police services of Burlington, Oakville, Milton and Halton Hills and first consisted of 205 officers and 45 civilians. The Ontario Provincial Police continued to police the remainder of the region until 1975, when the regional force had expanded to the point where it could assume responsibility for the entire area. In 2018 the new Halton Regional Police Service Headquarters at 2485 North Service Rd. W. was opened.

The primary purpose of the Police Cadet program is to promote and enhance the career development and experience of future Police Constable candidates. The Cadets assist front-line officers throughout the region, at our community events. They are also assigned to a platoon, where they are assigned a mentor officer and exposed to all facets of front- line police work. They have the following desired qualifications for cadets: *Between the ages of 19-24 *Recent post-secondary graduate or in the last semester or post-secondary education Units Halton Regional Police Service operations are divided into a number of specialized units. These units include, but are not limited to: Drug and Human Trafficking, Firearms, Intelligence and Offender Management units, Child Abuse and Sexual Assault, Domestic Violence, Fraud, Homicide, Technology Crime, Canine, Tactical Rescue Unit, Marine, Explosive Disposal Unit, Marine Unit and our Regional Community Mobilization Bureau which includes School Liaison Officers, Community Safety and Well-Being, Crisis Outreach And Support Team, Mobile Crisis Rapid Response Team and Auxiliary Police. Investigators are also assigned at the district level to the criminal investigation bureau which investigates crimes against persons and property. The police service also has a ceremonial wing responsible for representing the police force at local events, parades, and internal police ceremonies. The Ceremonial Services comprises the Colour Guard, which is responsible for escorting the police colours on functions where their presence are required; the Chorus, a vocal group composed of civilian volunteers and serving police officers; and the Pipes & Drums, another musical ensemble which plays in a variety of parades and community events in the Halton area. https://www.haltonpolice.ca/about/ceremonial/index.php Community Policing Philosophy The Halton Regional Police Service is widely known as one of the most progressive community policing services in Canada with its strong emphasis on the community. Community policing in the Halton region is a philosophy based on the concept that police officers and members of the public work together, in partnership, resulting in creative ways to solve contemporary community problems related to crime, fear of crime, social and physical order, and neighbourhood decay. In recent years the Halton Regional Police has incorporated an intelligence-led policing strategy which is built around risk assessment and risk management, utilizing analysis in crime trends to effect an appropriate policing response. Special Investigations Unit The actions of police officers in the Province of Ontario are overseen by the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) of Ontario, a civilian agency responsible for investigating circumstances involving police and civilians that have resulted in a death, serious injury, or allegations of sexual assault. The SIU is dedicated to maintaining one law, ensuring equal justice before the law among both the police and the public. Their goal is to ensure that the criminal law is applied appropriately to police conduct, as determined through independent investigations, increasing public confidence in the police services. Complaints involving police conduct that do not result in a serious injury or death must be referred to the appropriate police service or to another oversight agency, such as the Ontario Civilian Commission on Police Services.Ontario Civilian Commission on Police Services Fleet * Ford Expedition * Dodge Charger Police Cruiser * Ford Taurus Police Interceptor * Ford Explorer Police Utility * Dodge RAM Police Undercover * Dodge Grand Caravan Undercover * Chevrolet Equinox LT Undercover * Chrysler 300 Undercover * Mobile Command Units (2) * Armoured Response Vehicle  References  External links *Halton Regional Police Service Category:Regional Municipality of Halton Category:Law enforcement agencies of Ontario ","title":"Halton Regional Police Service"},{"id":"1973181","text":"The Chain Bridge is a viaduct which crosses the Potomac River at Little Falls in Washington, D.C.. The steel girder bridge carries close to 22,000 cars a day. It connects Washington with affluent sections of Arlington and Fairfax counties in Virginia. On the Washington side, the bridge connects with Canal Road. Left turns onto the Clara Barton Parkway from the Chain Bridge are prohibited, but the reverse is permitted. On the Virginia side, the bridge connects with State Route 123 (Chain Bridge Road), which provides access to the George Washington Memorial Parkway. The Chain Bridge has three lanes (of which the center is reversible) and can be safely accessed by pedestrians and cyclists. The pedestrian sidewalk provides access to the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal towpath via a ramp. The bridge also carries water mains which provides Arlington County with water from the Washington Aqueduct. History Chain Bridge during Civil War 1839 drawing of the Chain Bridge Underside of the Chain Bridge The first bridge at the location was opened on July 3, 1797. It was a wooden covered bridge, and rotted and collapsed in 1804. The second bridge, of similar type, burned six months after it was built. The third bridge was built four years later in 1808, and its method of construction gave subsequent iterations their names. It was a chain suspension bridge, using 1¬º inch bars. It was designed by Judge James E. Finley, and was 136 feet long by 15 feet wide. It was destroyed by flood in 1810 or 1812. The fourth bridge was also a chain suspension bridge, and though damaged by floods in 1815, it lasted until 1840. The fifth bridge was built in 1840, and made of chain and wood. This span collapsed in 1852. It was replaced by a crossbeam truss structure that resembled a long garden arbor or pergola, but retained its historical name. During the American Civil War, the Chain Bridge was a popular place for the Union Army to access the countryside encampments from Fairfax County. The bridge is the site of the first Union Army Balloon Corps balloon crossing, which took place overnight on October 12, 1861, conducted by Professor Thaddeus S. C. Lowe and a band of handlers who had to precariously traverse the outsides of the fully trellised bridge. In a nine-hour ordeal, the balloon Union was fully inflated in Washington and walked out to the battlefield at Lewinsville, Virginia. The truss bridge was swept away in an 1870 flood, and a lightweight iron truss replacement was erected in 1872‚Äì1874. Traffic restrictions were placed on the bridge in the 1920s, and it was fully closed following the record flood of 1936. The eighth and present version of the bridge is a continuous steel girder structure, completed in 1938 on piers dating from the 1870s. In 1982, the bridge was significantly overhauled. The overhaul widened the three 10-foot wide lanes with a 12 foot wide one and two 11 foot ones. It also replaced a set of stairs from the bridge to the C&O; Trail with a ramp, removed the sidewalk on the downstream side, added a crash barrier between the sidewalk and roadway, replaced the old railing with a fence and replaced heavy concrete with a lighter type that allowed the bridge to hold more weight.

In 1728 he reintroduced into Scottish juries the possible verdicts of guilty or not guilty as against proven or not proven. He was Lord President of the Court of Session from 1748 to 1753.. Early life Dundas was born on 9 December 1685.the second son of Robert Dundas, Lord Arniston, a judge of the court of session, and his wife Margaret Sinclair, daughter of Sir Robert Sinclair of Stevenson. The family's Edinburgh house was at the head of Old Fishmarket Close on the Royal Mile.Cassell's Old and New Edinburgh vol II p.242 The house was later destroyed in the Great Fire of Edinburgh. He was educated at Utrecht in about 1700 and was admitted a member of the Faculty of Advocates on 26 July 1709, and became a profound lawyer through his Interest and talent. Career In about 1717 Dundas was appointed Assessor to city of Edinburgh and was also appointed in 1717 Solicitor General for Scotland by the secretary of state, the Duke of Roxburghe, the head of the Squadrone. He found this an irksome position, and in 1718 applied to succeed Eliot of Minto on the bench, but the place was already given to Sir Walter Pringle. However, he was promoted in 1720 by the Duke of Roxburghe to be Lord Advocate, in succession to Sir David Dalrymple . On 9 December 1721 he became dean of the Faculty of Advocates. On 11 July 1721 he resigned the post of assessor to the city of Edinburgh and an acrimonious correspondence took place between him and the magistrates of Edinburgh. At the 1722 British general election Dundas was returned as Member of Parliament for Edinburghshire. He was a major opponent of the malt-tax in 1724, after the Argyll party came into power with Robert Walpole. He was counsel for the Glasgow magistrates after they were charged with conniving at the riots against the tax. He became a key figure in agitation against the tax and also encouraged the Edinburgh brewers to resist. In the Commons, on 4 March 1726, he blamed the riots on the mismanagement of the Government and the military authorities. Later he put forward a proposal to allocate part of the malt tax to improvements in Scotland. In 1727 he proposed a counter-address against the malt tax instead of a loyal address of the court of session. At the 1727 British general election Dundas was returned unopposed as MP for Edinburghshire and continued in opposition. He spoke against the Government in the Dunkirk debate on 12 February 1730 and also in 1730 promoted a bill to give the court of session the power of adjourning. cites Robert Wodrow, Analecta, Maitland Soc., iii. 290, 404, iv. 104. After his return unopposed at the 1734 British general election, he was the chief adviser of the opposition formed of representative peers and members of parliament against the administration of Scotch affairs adopted by Lord Ilay. With Erskine of Grange, he joined with the opposition in an attack in both Houses on the methods which the Government had used in the recent election of Scottish representative peers. This opposition movement was, however, unsuccessful. On 5 May 1735 the Commons passed a bill drafted by Erskine and introduced by Dundas to prevent the wrongful imprisonment of persons coming to vote in elections, but the bill was thrown out by the House of Lords. On 10 June 1737, Dundas was appointed a judge of the court of session, in succession to Sir Walter Pringle of Newhall, and vacated his seat in the House of Commons. In 1745, Dundas' son Robert dissuaded his father from retiring into private life, but it was believed, he would have retired in 1748 if his hopes of becoming lord president had been disappointed. After a vacancy of nine months, the ministry and independent Whigs, overrode the Duke of Argyll's opposition, and on 10 September 1748 Dundas succeeded Duncan Forbes of Culloden as lord president, and filled the office for the rest of his life. Dundas dies at Abbey Hill, Edinburgh, on 26 August 1753. He was buried on 31 August in the family tomb at Borthwick. Most famous case Dunas's most famous case was his defence of James Carnegie of Finhaven in 1728 on his trial for the murder of Charles, earl of Strathmore, whom he killed in a drunken brawl by mistake for Lyon of Bridgeton. The original practice was to allow the jury to find the prisoner generally guilty or not guilty; about the time of Charles II this was altered to a finding upon the facts of proven or not proven. In this case it was clear that Carnegie killed Strathmore. If the jury were to find the fact proven, leaving the court to pronounce the legal effect of that finding, Carnegie was a dead man. Dundas forced the court to return to the older course, and the jury found Carnegie not guilty, and this practice was adopted in subsequent cases. Assessment As an advocate he was both eloquent and ingenious; in private life idle and convivial. see Scott's Guy Mannering, n. 9. Dundas's appearance was forbidding and his voice harsh; his portrait is preserved at Arniston, and is engraved in the Arniston Memoirs. Family Dundas married, twice. In 1712, Elizabeth, eldest daughter of Robert Watson of Muirhouse, who, with four of his children, died in January 1734 of smallpox, and by her he had a son, Robert, afterwards lord president, and other children. On 3 June 1734, he married Anne, daughter of Sir William Gordon, bart., of Invergordon, by whom he had five sons and a daughter. One of these sons, Henry, was Treasurer of the Navy and 1st Viscount Melville.

A functional design assures that each modular part of a device has only one responsibility and performs that responsibility with the minimum of side effects on other parts. Functionally designed modules tend to have low coupling. Advantages The advantage for implementation is that if a software module has a single purpose, it will be simpler, and therefore easier and less expensive, to design and implement. Systems with functionally designed parts are easier to modify because each part does only what it claims to do. Since maintenance is more than 3/4 of a successful system's life, Software Maintenance Costs by Jussi Koskinen this feature is a crucial advantage. It also makes the system easier to understand and document, which simplifies training. The result is that the practical lifetime of a functional system is longer. In a system of programs, a functional module will be easier to reuse because it is less likely to have side effects that appear in other parts of the system. Technique The standard way to assure functional design is to review the description of a module. If the description includes conjunctions such as \\"and\\" or \\"or\\", then the design has more than one responsibility, and is therefore likely to have side effects. The responsibilities need to be divided into several modules in order to achieve a functional design. Critiques and limits Every computer system has parts that cannot be functionally pure because they exist to distribute CPU cycles or other resources to different modules. For example, most systems have an \\"initialization\\" section that starts up the modules. Other well-known examples are the interrupt vector table and the main loop. Some functions inherently have mixed semantics. For example, a function \\"move the car from the garage\\" inherently has a side effect of changing the \\"car position\\". In some cases, the mixed semantics can extend over a large topological tree or graph of related concepts. In these unusual cases, functional design is not recommended by some authorities . Instead polymorphism, inheritance, or procedural methods may be preferred. Applied to 3D modeling and simulation Recently several software companies have introduced functional design as a concept to describe a Parametric feature based modeler for 3D modeling and simulation. In this context, they mean a parametric model of an object where the parameters are tied to real-world design criteria, such as an axle that will adjust its diameter based on the strength of the material and the amount of force being applied to it in the simulation. It is hoped that this will create efficiencies in the design process for mechanical and perhaps even architectural/structural assemblies by integrating the results of finite element analysis directly to the behavior of individual objects.

It is distributed daily, except on Sundays. History and profile Fr√©ttabla√∞i√∞ was established in 2001. The paper was published 6 days per week, Monday - Saturday until September 2003 when its frequency was switched to daily. It is primarily owned by the media group 365 media. Fr√©ttabla√∞i√∞ has been accused of siding politically with the Social Democratic Alliance (Samfylkingin) and for favouring Icelandic membership of the European Union. However, many of its editors have had ties with its main political opponent the conservative Independence Party (Sj√°lfst√¶√∞isflokkurinn) and its former editor-in-chief and regular columnist is its former leader and Prime Minister √ûorsteinn P√°lsson. In the period of 2001-2002 the paper had a circulation of 70,000. In 2017, 365 Mi√∞lar sold most of its assets to Fjarskipti ehf, the parent company of Vodafone Iceland, including the website visir.is. 365 Mi√∞lar kept Fr√©ttabla√∞i√∞ along with Glamour magazine and opened a new website, frettabladid.is. After the sale to fjarskipti, 365 Mi√∞lar moved operations for Fr√©ttabla√∞i√∞, Glamour magazine and frettabladid.is under Torg ehf., its subsidiary. In October 2019, Helgi Magn√∫sson and other investors bought 365 Mi√∞lar's shares in Torg ehf. Helgi had previously bought 50% of Torg ehf's stocks earlier in 2019. As a part of the sale, √ìl√∂f Skaftad√≥ttir stepped down as editor and was replaced with J√≥n √û√≥risson.

The organisation provides support and advice to refugees and asylum seekers, as well as support for other refugee and asylum seeker organisations. The Refugee Council also produces many reports and educational material relating to refugee issues, and lobbies politicians and the media on these issues. The Council works in partnership with many other refugee organisations, including the British Red Cross, Scottish Refugee Council, Welsh Refugee Council, North of England Refugee Service, Northern Refugee Centre, and Refugee Action. History The Refugee Council originated from two independent organisations, British Council for Aid to Refugees (BCAR) and the Standing Conference on Refugees (SCOR), which were both founded in 1951 following the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. In 1981 these two organisations merged to form the British Refugee Council which was later renamed the Refugee Council due to the establishment of various other regional refugee councils. The Refugee Council Archives are held at University of East London, Docklands Campus. Work The Refugee Council's head office is in Stratford London. The charity's main activities are providing support and advice to asylum seekers and refugees themselves as well as to other organisations, undertaking research and policy work, and campaigning on behalf of refugees and asylum seekers. The Refugee Council is a member organisation of the Asylum Support Partnership and European Council on Refugees and Exiles (ECRE). =Support and advice= Refugee Council has received an exemption from the OISC to provide immigration advice and holds the Quality Mark for advice work. Regional offices throughout England provide services to asylum seekers and refugees including: *Advice about where to apply for support, and help with applying; *Information about the UK's 'dispersal policy'; *Information about other services which can assist; *Help with problems with accommodation, racial harassment, physical and mental health; and *Help with appealing against rejection of a UKBA support application. These services are available either in the Refugee Council offices or on the phone. Drop in services provide hot meals, food parcels, clothes and English classes, as well as advice and support. In addition, the Refugee Council offers special advice to unaccompanied children, including children who are under 18 when they arrive in the UK and young people aged 18‚Äì21 who are caring for younger siblings. This specialist support includes *Help to obtain legal representation, and guiding the child through the process; *Accompanying the child to asylum interviews, hearings, tribunals etc.; *Supporting the child during doctor's or social service appointments; and In 2011 the charity launched a new Own Language Telephone Advice Service (OLTAS) providing free multilingual advice for asylum seekers and refugees. =Campaigning= In 2005, Refugee Council launched a campaign called Don't Believe the Type aimed at combating what they see as hostility and prejudice towards asylum seekers and refugees. In 2008 Refugee Council formed the Still Human Still Here coalition with Amnesty International UK, Medical Foundation and over 40 other organisations, which is dedicated to highlighting the plight of tens of thousands of refused asylum seekers in UK and campaigning to end destitution of asylum seekers. In 2011 the charity launched the Proud to Protect pledge which with the help of celebrity supporters gathered over 10,000 signatures.

He served as Solicitor General for Scotland from 1742 to 1746, as Lord Advocate from 1754 to 1760, and as Member of Parliament for Midlothian from 1754 to 1761. He was Lord President of the Court of Session from 1760 to 1787, losing his popularity for giving his casting vote against Archibald Douglas in the famous Douglas Cause. Life and career Robert Dundas of Arniston, the younger Robert Dundas was the eldest son of Robert Dundas of Arniston (1685‚Äì1753), Lord President of the Court of Session, by Elizabeth Watson, his first wife. He was educated first at home and at school, and then at the University of Edinburgh. In 1733, he proceeded to Utrecht University, then celebrated for the teaching of Roman law, and also visited Paris. Returning to Scotland in 1737, Dundas was admitted an advocate in 1738. He was quick, ingenious and eloquent, and had a retentive memory. Like his father, he was convivial and shirked drudgery. He is said, though a good scholar, never to have read through a book after leaving college. Being solely ambitious of attaining to the bench, he refused many cases, especially those which involved writing papers, and took only such work as seemed to lead to advancement. For his first five years, his fees only averaged ¬£280 per annum. Through the favour of the Carteret administration, he was appointed Solicitor General for Scotland on 11 August 1742, and, no change occurring in the Scotch department on Lord Wilmington's death, held that post through the arduous and responsible times of the Jacobite plots and the rising of 1745. Being, however, unable to act easily with Lord Milton, the lord justice clerk, he resigned in 1746 upon the change of ministry, but was at once elected dean of the faculty. On 16 August 1754, Dundas was appointed Lord Advocate, having been returned for Midlothian unopposed on 25 April at the general election. While in parliament, he opposed the establishment of a militia in Scotland, and, as lord advocate, was largely occupied in settling the new conditions of the highlands, and in disposing of his great patronage so as to enhance the family influence. But one speech of his in parliament is recorded, viz. in 1755 Parl. Hist. xv. 562. Dundas was appointed a commissioner of fisheries on 17 June 1755, and on the death of Robert Craigie, he became lord president of the court of session, 14 June 1760. He found upwards of two years' arrears of cases undecided, and having by great efforts disposed of them, he never allowed his case-list to fall into arrears again. He was the best lord president who had filled the office, short but weighty in his judgements, thorough in his grasp of the cases, indignant at chicane, a punctilious guardian of the dignity of the court, a chief who called forth all the faculties of his colleagues. Having, on 7 July 1767, given the casting vote against the claimant, Archibald Stewart, in the Douglas peerage case, he became very unpopular, and during the tumultuous rejoicings at Edinburgh, after the House of Lords had reversed that decision on 2 March 1769, the mob insulted him and attacked his house. In his latter years his eyesight failed, and after a short illness he died at his house in Adam's Square on 13 December 1787, and was buried with great pomp at Borthwick on 18 December see Scots Mag. 1787, p. 622.His portrait, by Raeburn, is preserved at Arniston, and is engraved in the Arniston Memoirs Family Part of a remarkable Scottish legal and political dynasty, his great-grandfather James Dundas, Lord Arniston (died 1679) and grandfather Robert Dundas, Lord Arniston (died 1726) had been MPs and judges, as was his father, Robert Dundas of Arniston, the Elder. Dundas married, firstly, on 17 October 1741, Henrietta Baillie, daughter of Sir James Carmichael Baillie of Lamington and Bonnytoun, who died on 3 May 1755; and, secondly, in September 1756, Jean, daughter of William Grant, Lord Prestongrange. By his first wife, he had four daughters, of whom Elizabeth, the eldest, married Sir John Lockhart-Ross, 6th Baronet; and by his second four sons, of whom Robert, the eldest, became lord advocate, and two daughters. The three younger sons all had notable careers: Francis became a general and acting governor of the Cape Colony between 1798 and 1803, William became a lawyer and Member of Parliament, and Philip became superintendent of Bombay, a Member of Parliament, and governor of Prince of Wales Island.

In 1989, the company was bought by Computer Associates. Cullinet was headquartered at 400 Blue Hill Drive in Westwood, Massachusetts. History The company was started by John Cullinane and Larry English in 1968 as Cullinane Corporation. Their idea was to sell pre-packaged software to mainframe users, which was at that time a new concept in an era when enterprises only used internally developed applications or the software that came bundled with the hardware.John Cullinane, Smarter Than Their Machines: Oral Histories of Pioneers in Interactive Computing (New York: Association for Computing Machinery and Morgan & Claypool, 2014) at DOI Rather than write its own products, Cullinane approached IT (information technology) departments (at that time called Data Processing departments) of major enterprises, particularly banks, to identify internally developed applications that he felt had potential to be productized and licensed to others. However, it proved difficult to sell these applications because most weren't generalized and supportable systems. As a result, the company decided to develop a source code management system, called PLUS, that competed with Pansophic's (PanDA) and UCC's products (UCC-1 tape management system, etc.). The first version of PLUS (which stood for Program Library Update System) required the use of magnetic tape devices, and was not competitive with the other, disk-based products. Although the company eventually responded with a disk-based version, called PLUS-DA (which stood for Direct Access, a common name for disks at the time) they did not become successful in this market. The first breakthrough product was a report writer named Culprit, developed in-house by Gil Curtis and Anna Marie Thron, who had built the PHI payroll system. The product competed with Mark IV from Informatics, Inc., but was perceived as a late entry in the report writer category. The company struggled with financial stability until it branded a variation of Culprit, EDP Auditor, which was nothing more than a second name for the same product with a collection of predefined reports, but more importantly, special services aimed at the new discipline of EDP (electronic data processing) Auditing including the first EDP Auditors User, special support to give auditors independence of data processing which was very important to them.Oral history interview with John Cullinane. Charles Babbage InstiThe company was originally started bytute, University of Minnesota. What was remarkable is that many corporations licensed essentially identical products. This led to serendipitous prosperity for Cullinane. As EDP auditors developed knowledge about business systems and computers, they could invariably produce reports faster than slower-moving, internal IT departments. As a result, MIS (management information systems) departments would feel compelled to buy the Culprit version for their own use ‚Äî to compete. As the company prospered in the early 1970s, it was approached by a consultant to BFGoodrich, Naomi O. Seligman, to consider taking over development of a Honeywell database management system called Integrated Data Store (IDS) that had been modified to operate on IBM and IBM compatible (RCA) mainframes. IDS was originally developed by General Electric, and Bill Curtis had supposedly gotten the rights to convert the system to run on IBM equipment. The decision was made in early 1973 ‚Äî primarily by John Cullinane, Jim Baker and Tom Muerer ‚Äî to bet the company on the effort. Several executives joined the effort over the next three years, including Andrew Filipowski, Robert Goldman, Jon Nackerud, Ron McKinney, William Casey, Bob Davis, Bill Linn, and Ray Nawara. IDMS was to be a great bet for the company as it became the leader among many capable and popular products of the mainframe era. It competed with Cincom's Total, Software AG's ADABAS, Applied Data Research's DATACOM/DB, Computer Corporation of America's Model 204, MRI (later Intel's) System 2000 and IBM Information Management System (IMS) and DL/I.Software Memories¬ªBlog Archive ¬ª Prerelational DBMS vendors ‚Äî a quick overview In 1976, the source code was sold to International Computers Limited (ICL), whose developers ported the software to run on their 2900 Series mainframes, and subsequently also on the older 1900 machines. ICL continued development of the software independently of Cullinane, selling the originally ported product under the name IDMS and an enhanced version as IDMSX. In this form, it was used by many large UK and international users ‚Äî examples being the Pay-As-You-Earn system operated by Inland Revenue and a system for Barclays Bank in South Africa. Many of these systems are still running in 2010 on Fujitsu equipment. John Cullinane mentored a series of future entrepreneurs and software industry executives. One of the early executives was Andrew 'Flip' Filipowski, who later founded Platinum Technology, Inc.. Another was Robert Goldman who became the CEO of several public software companies including AICorp. Jon Nackerud was a co- founder of Relational Technology, Inc., formed to commercialize the Ingres database management system. Prior to becoming a public company in 1978, the company's name was changed to Cullinane Database Systems, Inc. The company changed its name again to Cullinet Software in 1983, partly because John Cullinane wanted to distance his name from the personal connection to the business when he turned the company over to Bob Goldman, and also in a nod to the importance of computer networking (as evidenced by the company's simultaneous acquisition of Computer Pictures, whose microcomputer-based desktop system linked to IDMS data). Joe McNay, a board member, was particularly important regarding the company's IPO, the first ever in the software products industry. Greylock purchased some shares from John Cullinane in 1977, less than a year before the company was to go public. It was to be the early foundation on which their Greylock's software technology investment prowess rested. It was Greylock‚Äôs first investment in a software company. Cullinane's public offering was of note as it was the first successful offering of a pure software products company ever and the first software company Hambrecht & Quist ever took public. Cullinet was also the first software company to have a billion dollar valuation, and the first to do a Super Bowl advertisement. Cullinane Database Systems, Inc., went public in 1978. On April 27, 1982 the company became the first computer software firm to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange and later, the first to become a component stock of the S&P; 500 Index. However, two quarters after the company went public IBM introduced its 4300 series. Its salesmen told all mutual clients that IDMS didn't run on the 4300 series and that all IBM software of the future would be built with IMS/DL1. This caused a major problem as every IDMS customer went ballistic and every prospect went on hold. The company only had three months to solve this marketing problem and technical problem, and remarkably, they did. Technically, it only required the modification of one instruction to get IDMS running on a 4300. The solution to the company's revenue problem turned out to be its new Integrated Data Dictionary. By moving very fast, the company used it to put IBM on the defensive and made its numbers, no small accomplishment. It then went from winning one out five competitions to winning four out five and this fueled its growth. Beginning in 1979, in an attempt to promote less dependence on the database sales alone, Cullinane fully integrated financial and manufacturing applications with IDMS and decision support systems, another first. The company acquired financial applications from McCormack & Dodge (\\"M&D;\\"), a financial software company (acquired by Dun & Bradstreet later in 1983) and completely rewrote them using IDMS. They also acquired an MRP system from Rath & Strong and completely rewrote it using IDMS. Thus, Cullinet had a suite of integrated financial and manufacturing systems (called CIMS Cullinet Integrated Manufacturing System), the first on-line database driven applications, and was a major competitor in what is now called ERP. The company had become a software powerhouse. Eventually, it acquired a small Boston-based company called Computer Pictures whose graphics-focused decision support system TrendSpotter had already been integrated with IDMS and was very successful. This team developed Goldengate, a Lotus Symphony-like PC product. Goldengate was a part of Cullinet's flawed ICMS (Information Center Management System). The promise of ICMS was the ability to move data between the mainframe and PC desktop. Apple Computer was supposed to do the same for the Apple Lisa, but never delivered. ICMS was unveiled in 1983 as part of a splashy 20+ city closed circuit TV broadcast that focused on IDMS/R and fueled the market for Cullinet for the next two years, but it was obvious that it was getting harder to maintain its unbroken string of quarters with sales and earnings in excess of 50%. The company should have developed PC based IDMS development tools, instead. Ironically, it had the technology under development which was later to become the foundation of PowerBuilder at Powersoft. In fairness, many failures mark the landscape in that space and era including the Ovation product introduced with great fanfare by Ovation Corporation in a race with Lotus's Symphony suite attempting to create the early office suites dominated by Microsoft Corp. Goldengate's other flaw was that it was built pre-Windows, which was expensive for Cullinet because of all the permutations and combinations of PC hardware and memory configurations. In 1983 John Cullinane, after 25 years in the software business, handed over the helm of Cullinet to Bob Goldman while he began to pursue other interests. Things continued to go well, but eventually the company ran into trouble and Cullinane brought in a recent acquaintance, David Chapman, as CEO of the company. At the time, Cullinet had $50 million in cash reserves. David Chapman, a veteran IBM and Data General executive, started an aggressive campaign to acquire technology from other companies. The reason for bringing in Chapman was that the company had gotten hung up on the open architecture and relational issues. In other words, a company with an unparalleled record of outpositioning competition every two years, for sixteen years, including IBM, allowed itself to get outpositioned by IBM and others, with the help of E.F. Codd and C.J. Date. In 1986-87, Chapman attempted to move the company to the more and more powerful minicomputers such as Digital Equipment Corporation's VAX line of computers. In the process, Cullinet acquired some very questionable VAX companies, but one had an outstanding relational DBMS. By then it was too late ‚Äî the company's $50 million of cash had been spent. In 1988, John Cullinane returned to Cullinet, fired Chapman and tried to salvage the company. By repositioning the company's product line with a new product called Enterprise Generator, he solved the open architecture problem and the company was able to return to profitability by the fourth quarter, which made it possible to negotiate a deal with Charles Wang, head of Computer Associates. In 1989, Wang bought the company for $330 million in stock. It was a good deal for investors, which was reflected in the fact that shares of CA increased in value at least tenfold during the 1990s. It was a good deal for John Cullinane, too. Much later, CA Technologies (formerly CA, Inc. and Computer Associates International, Inc.) still marketed and supported the CA IDMS relational database system for IBM z/OS, z/VSE and z/VM, Fujitsu Siemens BS2000/OSD, Linux (CA IDMS Server), UNIX (CA IDMS Server) and Windows (CA IDMS Server).  Products  ; IDMS : A CODASYL network database management system first developed at B.F. Goodrich. John Cullinane acquired the rights to market IDMS in the early 1970s. IDMS legacy systems are still being run today. Only a few customers have migrated to IDMS/R. ; ;IDMS/R: This was an evolution of IDMS in approximately 1984 involving the addition of relational features. = IDMS/SQL = : This was a completely separate database engine developed in California by Dr. Kapali Eswaran who was originally from IBM's System R project. The company had also developed a 4GL for use with the database engine. The components were all named after planets. This product was designed to run on the Digital VAX system. Eswaron's company Esvel was acquired by Cullinet in July 1987 and its main product re-launched as IDMS/R. The 4GL was dropped in favour of one developed by a Cancor, a Canadian company based in Mississauga, Ontario which was acquired in January 1987. ; IDMS-DC : A teleprocessing system similar to IBM's CICS system. When it was first released, it was reported that IBM challenged Cullinane to prove that the code had not violated copyright. This suspicion was due to the fact that many internal CICS codes begin with the initials \\"RH\\". Many IDMS-DC modules also begin with \\"RH\\" after it two authors, Nick Rini and Don Heitzmann, both employees of Cullinane. ;ADS/Online : IDMS- DC help spawn a fourth generation (4GL) programming system called ADS/Online (Application Development System). The original name of the product was \\"AIDS\\". ADS/Online was a COBOL-like language and was successful because it competed against CICS, which tended to be used mainly by COBOL programmers. ADS/O was later ported to run directly in CICS and was adopted by nearly 1,500 companies. ;ADS/Batch : A port of ADS/Online to the batch mainframe environment. It was not well received by Cullinet's customers. ; Culprit : An RPG-like reporting tool. It was also marketed as tool for use by auditors under the name EDP Auditor. ; Online Query (OLQ) : A powerful online reporting tool. ; Online English : A powerful online reporting tool that used the \\"Intellect\\" natural language AI engine from Artificial Intelligence Corporation (AICorp). ; IDD : (Integrated Data Dictionary) A renowned integrated data dictionary. ; PLUS : An early, tape-based, source code management system.

It is tan to light brown and has two light-colored bands across the wings and abdomen, they may sometimes appear to be broken or irregular but are quite noticeable. The bands may be partly obscured by the wings. The male has wings that cover the abdomen, while the female has wings that do not cover the abdomen completely. The male appears more slender than the female, the female appears wider. Distribution The brown-banded cockroach has a fairly wide distribution, being found in the northeastern, southern, and midwest regions of the United States quite commonly. They are one of the most recent alien cockroaches to form breeding colonies in Britain and Ireland. They need less moisture than the German cockroach so they tend to be more broadly distributed in the home, such as in living rooms and bedrooms. They can often be found in homes and apartments, but are less common in restaurants. They tend not to be found in the daytime, since they avoid light. In an experiment by Tsai and Chi they found that populations of brown-banded cockroaches would be expected to thrive in environments with a temperature between 25 and 33 ¬∞C. Diet The brown-banded cockroach eats a wide variety of items. In an experiment by Cohen and colleagues they found that the larva of the brown-banded cockroach when given a choice will choose a casein:glucose ratio of 15.5:84.5.Cohen, Heydon, Waldbauer and Friedman 1987, p. 77 The larvae that ate only casein died early in the experiment, a few larvae that ate only glucose survived past the larval stage but did not make it to adulthood.Cohen, Heydon, Waldbauer and Friedman 1987, p. 79 A decline in consumption of carbohydrates was seen at the time of first and second moults. Physiology Prakash and colleagues explain that the brown-banded cockroach has five segmented maxillary palps and the most distal fifth segment has the largest segment with the most variety of sensilla.Prakash, Mendki, Raol, Singh and Singh 1995, p. 15 With the variety of shapes and sizes of the maxillary it is expected that they would have a variety of functions.Prakash, Mendki, Raol, Singh and Singh 1995, p. 31 In Prakash and colleagues experiment they observed that the curved edge of fifth segment that remained most ventral and probes the substratum with it during foraging. On the fifth segment parallel to the curved ventral edge on the medial surface is a longitudinal furrow that's densely lined with papillaform sensilla. The shaft of the papilla has a longitudinal slit near the distal tip, allowing dendrites of the sensillum to sense the external environment.Prakash, Mendki, Raol, Singh and Singh 1995, p. 26 These dendrites proceed in a wavy form through the shaft of the sensillum.Prakash, Mendki, Raol, Singh and Singh 1995, p. 32 The sensillum contains antennal glomeruli, suggesting that it has an olfactory role. Prakash and colleagues suggest that since the location of this sensilla is in the maxillary palp that this is a short-range olfactory detector for the micro-environment. The olfactory sensilla on the antenna and the double-walled sensilla on both palps probably serve as long-range odour sensors. The maxillary and labial palps show sexual dimorphism which suggests involvement in courtship. Females have more sensilla chaetica on both appendages than males whereas, males have more chemosensilla on the maxillary palps and taste sensilla on the labial palps. According to Schall and colleagues the site of sex pheromone production in the female Supella longipalpa is located on the fourth and fifth abdominal tergites.Schal, Liang, Hazarikal, Charlton and Roelofs 1992, p. 605 Cuticular pores occur on all tergites, but the density is highest on the lateral margins of the fourth and fifth tergites. Each pore is connected via a long duct to modified epidermal cells, suggesting that these structures are involved in pheromone production. Sex Pheromone The brown-banded cockroach has been the model in many studies about sex pheromones. Cockroaches rely on pheromones for many reproductive behaviours, including bringing the sexes together for mating.Schal, Burns, Jurenka and Blomquist 1990, p. 1997 Their sex pheromones can be divided into two categories: cuticular compounds that elicit sexual responses after the sexes contact and volatile compounds that act over a distance. The female brown-banded cockroach emits a sex pheromone that attracts males.Charlton, Webster, Zhang, Schal, Liand, Sreng and Roelofs 1993, p. 10202 Charlton and colleagues isolated and identified the pheromone as 5-(2,4-dimethylheptanyl)-3-methyl-2H-pyran-2-one which they refer to as supellapyrone. A blend of synthetic compound elicited behavioural and electrophysiological responses comparable to the natural pheromone. This sex pheromone can be synthesized by direct coupling of a brominated pryoned with an alkylzanic reagent.Shi, Leal, Liu, Schrader and Meinwald 1995, p. 71 The stereochemistry of the natural pheromone was assigned by a combination of synthesis, chiral gas chromatography, and electrophysiological measurement. They key step in synthesizing the three stereoisomers of this pheromone is employing lipase-catalyzed desymmetrization or enantiomer separation of syn- or anti-2,4-dimethylpentane-1,5-diol. Supellapyrone has four configurations but female brown-banded cockroaches can only produce the RR isomer.Gemono, Leal, Mori and Schal 2003, p. 1797 In an experiment by Gemono and colleagues they found that the males are attracted to the RR isomer but they are also highly attracted to the SR isomer. Males also responded to SS isomer but the RS isomer elicited little to no response from any males. The regulation of the female sex pheromone production, calling behaviour and release is regulated directly and indirectly by the corpora allata and juvenile hormone.Smith and Schal 1990, p. 251 Smith and Schal came to this conclusion because both pheromone production and calling failed to occur after allatectomy; both pheromone production and calling could be restored by a corpora allata implantation or treatment with juvenile hormones; applications of a juvenile hormones to intact females advanced the age of pheromone production and NCA-I transection, which activates the copora allata in other cockroaches, advanced the age of pheromone production and calling.Smith and Schal 1990, p. 253 O√∂cyte growth in the brown-banded cockroach correlated with corpora allata activity in vitro.Smith and Schal 1990, p. 254 Ovariectomies were conducted: both pheromone production and calling were unaffected by either nymphs or adults, this was done to demonstrate that the ovaries do not mediate in the regulation of pheromone production. The role of juvenile hormone in pheromone production appears to be regulated by neural and humoral feedbacks. Calling ceases in an adult female after mating and does not resume throughout the duration of the insects life.Smith and Schal 1990, p. 369 Calling was suppressed and o√∂cyte growth was stimulated by the presence of a spermatophore, by the implantation of a spermatophore and by mating with vasectomized males.Smith and Schal 1990, p. 371 Odthecal deposition in females mated with vasectomized males caused calling to resume. Smith and Schal found that ventral nerve cord transections, either immediately following copulation or after odthecal deposition, restored calling in mated females. Their experimental evidence suggested that termination of calling is moderated neurally by a two-stage process, initiated by placement of the spermatophore and maintained by the presence of sperm in the spermatheca.

The method is often used in high-speed combusting flows because the high velocity and temperature accentuate its advantages over similar methods. HTV uses a laser (often an argon-fluoride excimer laser operating at ~193 nm) to dissociate the water in the flow into H + OH. Before entering the flow optics are used to create a grid of laser beams. The water in the flow is dissociated only where beams of sufficient energy pass through the flow, thus creating a grid in the flow where the concentrations of hydroxyl (OH) are higher than in the surrounding flow. Another laser beam (at either ~248 nm or ~308 nm) in the form of a sheet is also passed through the flow in the same plane as the grid. This laser beam is tuned to a wavelength that causes the hydroxyl molecules to fluoresce in the UV spectrum. The fluorescence is then captured by a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. Using electronic timing methods the picture of the grid can be captured at nearly the same instant that the grid is created. By delaying the pulse of the fluorescence laser and the camera shot, an image of the grid that has now displaced downstream can be captured. Computer programs are then used to compare the two images and determine the displacement of the grid. By dividing the displacement by the known time delay the two dimensional velocity field (in the plane of the grid) can be determined. Other molecular tagging velocimetry (MTV) methods have used ozone (O3), excited oxygen and nitric oxide as the tag instead of hydroxyl. In the case of ozone the method is known as ozone tagging velocimetry or OTV. OTV has been developed and tested in many room air temperature applications with very accurate test results. OTV consists of an initial \\"write\\" step, where a 193-nm pulsed excimer laser creates ozone grid lines via oxygen (O2) UV absorption, and a subsequent \\"read\\" step, where a 248-nm excimer laser photodissociates the formed O3 and fluoresces the vibrationally excited O2 product thus revealing the grid lines' displacement.

It is one of a handful of species in the Aquificae phylum, an unusual group of thermophilic bacteria that are thought to be some of the oldest species of bacteria, related to filamentous bacteria first observed at the turn of the century. \\"A. aeolicus\\" grows best in water between 85 ¬∞C and 95 ¬∞C, and can be found near underwater volcanoes or hot springs. It requires oxygen to survive but has been found to grow optimally under microaerophilic conditions. Due to its high stability against high temperature and lack of oxygen, \\"A. aeolicus\\" is a good candidate for biotechnological applications as it is believed to have potential to be used as hydrogenases in an attractive H2/O2 biofuel cell, replacing chemical catalysts. This can be useful for improving industrial processes.  Microbiological Characteristics  Morphology Mature \\"A. aeolicus\\" cells are typically rod-shaped bacterium with an approximate length of 2.0-6.0Œºm and a diameter of 0.4-0.5Œºm. These cells are motile by means of a monopolar polytrichous flagella. Additionally, members of the species tend to form large cell conglomerations, of up to 100 individual cells. Metabolism As an autotroph, \\"A. aeolicus\\" has the ability to obtain all necessary carbon by fixing CO2 from the environment. Additionally, this bacterium utilizes the TCA cycle as it provides the substrates of many bio synthetic pathways. The \\"A. aeolicus\\" genome contains encoding genes that together could constituent the TCA pathway: fumarate reductase, fumarate hydratase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, ferredoxin oxidoreductase, succinate-CoA ligase, aconitase and citratesynthase. Moreover, this bacterium uses oxygen, hydrogen, and mineral salts as its primary energy sources. Regarding its growth under microaerophilic conditions, Aquifex species have been observed to grow in oxygen concentrations as long as 7.5ppm. It is hypothesized that this is possible because 1) their oxygen-respiration system was already highly developed before the advent of oxygenic photosynthesis, 2) the Aquifex lineage came to life after there was a rise in atmospheric oxygen, or 3) oxygen respiration was developed, and then transferred among different bacterial lineages, such as Aquifex.  Environment  \\"A. aeolicus\\" was first discovered in the outflow of hot springs in Yellowstone National Park. However, it was also found growing near underwater volcanoes around the Aeolian Islands, north of Sicily. As a thermophilic, \\"A. aeolicus\\" grows best in water between 85 ¬∞C and 95 ¬∞C, with a pH optima of 8.0, ranging from 6.8-9.0.  Phenotypic and Genetic Characteristics  Comparison of the \\"Aquifex aeolicus\\" genome to other organisms showed that around 16% of its genes originated from the Archaea domain. It is most closely related to the hydrogen-oxidizing bacterium, Aquifex pyrophilus, and its close relative, Hydrogenobacter thermophilus. The genome of \\"A. aeolicus\\" has been successfully mapped, but was noted to be only one-third the size of the E. coli genome. As a result of the limited genome size, metabolic flexibility seemed to reduce. It has the smallest genome of any known non-parasite. Its total genome is 1.5 Mb long, has a G+C content of 43.4%, and contains 1512 genes. It also contains genes potentially coding for three distinct [NiFe] hydrogenases, however, it is thought that the Aquifex hydrogenases I and II function in energy conservation, where as hydrogenase III is more likely required for CO2 fixation. Additionally, during sequencing, a single extra chromosomal element (ECE) was identified, suggesting evidence of genetic exchange between the \\"A. aeolicus\\" chromosome and the ECE.

The Varangerhalv√∏ya National Park protects a majority of the land on the peninsula. Geology Much of the relief of Varanger Peninsula is a paleic surface similar to the one found in the highlands of southern Norway. In the peninsula the paleic surface is made up of an undulating plateau between the altitudes of 200 and 600 m.a.s.l.. The higher parts of the undulating plateau are made up by erosion-resistant rocks like quartzite. The lower parts are made up by weak rocks like shale and mudstone. At intermediate levels sandstone is common. Some parts of the paleic surface in Varanger Peninsula are a re-exposed unconformity that underlie sedimentary rock of Vendian (Late Neoproterozoic) age. The paleic surface might have been uplifted as much as 200-250 meters since middle Pliocene times. Landforms resulting from Quaternary periglaciation are recurrent across the peninsula. Among the most common are block fields and solifluction lobes. Blockfields are most extensive on the northern half of the peninsula, chiefly in the plateau area.Malmstr√∂m & Palm√©r 1985, pp. 91‚Äì92. Polygonal ground is found in some places, but there is no known modern ice wedges. Permafrost was as of 1985 only known from bogs, and in a few places this permafrost had originated thermokarst depressions.

The main goal of anti-replay is to avoid hackers injecting or making changes in packets that travel from a source to a destination. Anti- replay protocol uses a unidirectional security association in order to establish a secure connection between two nodes in the network. Once a secure connection is established, the anti-replay protocol uses packet sequence numbers to defeat replay attacks as follows: When the source sends a message, it adds a sequence number to its packet; the sequence number starts at 0 and is incremented by 1 for each subsequent packet. The destination maintains a 'sliding window' record of the sequence numbers of validated received packets; it rejects all packets which have a sequence number which is lower than the lowest in the sliding window (i.e. too old) or already appears in the sliding window (i.e. duplicates/replays). Accepted packets, once validated, update the sliding window (displacing the lowest sequence number out of the window if it was already full). See also Replay attack.

He is the former president of the Asia Society in New York City. Early years Platt was born in New York City on March 10, 1936. He is the son of Helen (n√©e Choate) Platt and architect Geoffrey Platt. His maternal grandfather was Joseph H. Choate Jr., and his great-grandfather was diplomat and lawyer Joseph Hodges Choate, who was appointed U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom in 1899 by President William Mckinley. Joseph's brother, William Gardner Choate, established Choate Rosemary Hall. Notable Choate alumni include, \\"John F. Kennedy, Ivanka Trump, Michael Douglas and Jamie Lee Curtis\\". Among his family members cousin, Ben Bradlee, who was also a Choate and best friend's with President John F. Kennedy who was Choate alumni. Bradlee oversaw the Watergate investigation story while working at the Washington Post. This ultimately led to the resignation of President Richard Nixon. Platt graduated from the prep school St. Paul's School, Harvard College (B.A., 1957) and Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies (M.A., 1959). At Harvard, he was a member of the Hasty Pudding Club and the Porcellian Club. He is articulate in the Chinese, German, French, and Japanese languages. Career Platt began his career as a research assistant at the Washington Center for Foreign Policy Research before entering the Foreign Service of the United States in 1959. Reportedly, he was inspired to join the Foreign Service by his great-grandfather, Ambassador Joseph Hodges Choate. From 1959 to 1961, he served as vice consul in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. From 1962 to 1963, he studied the Chinese language at the Foreign Service Institute and in Taichung, Taiwan. In 1964, he was assigned as political officer at the American consulate general in Hong Kong until 1968, when he became China desk officer in the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs. From 1969 to 1971, Platt was chief of the Asian Communist Areas Division of the Bureau of Intelligence and Research. In 1971‚Äì1973, he served as Deputy Director, and then Director, of the Secretariat Staff in the Department of State. As a young diplomat, Platt accompanied President Richard Nixon on the historic trip to Beijing in 1972 that signaled the resumption of relations between the U.S. and China. Platt was assigned as chief of the political section, U.S. Liaison Office, Peking, China, 1973‚Äì1974, and then as deputy chief of the political section at the Embassy in Tokyo, Japan, 1974‚Äì1977. He returned to Washington to serve as Director for Japanese Affairs in 1977 and then served as a staff member on the National Security Council at the White House from 1978 to 1980. From 1980 to 1981, he was Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense, International Security Affairs in the U.S. Department of Defense. From 1981 to 1982, he returned to the Department of State as Deputy Assistant Secretary, International Organization Affairs. =Ambassadorships= On July 22, 1982, President Reagan appointed Platt to succeed Frank G. Wisner as the U.S. Ambassador to Zambia. He presented his credentials on August 31, 1982 and served until he left his post on December 17, 1984 to become the Special Assistant to the Secretary of State and Executive Secretary of the U.S. Department of State. Platt stayed as Executive Secretary until February 13, 1987. On August 10, 1987, he was again appointed by Reagan as the U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines, succeeding Stephen W. Bosworth. Platt presented his credentials on August 27, 1987 and served in this role through George H. W. Bush's election as president until he left his post on July 20, 1991, after receiving his subsequent appointment by President Bush, when he was replaced by Wisner. On July 2, 1991, President Bush appointed Platt to succeed Robert B. Oakley as the U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan in Islamabad, where he remained until he left his post on November 3, 1992. He was succeeded as Ambassador by John Cameron Monjo. =Later career= Following his retirement from the State Department, in 1992 Platt began serving as the fifth president of Asia Society, a non-profit organization that focuses on educating the world about Asia. He also was a member of the Council on Foreign Relations in New York and was a member of the International Advisory Board of the Financial Times. Personal life On June 28, 1957, he married Sheila Maynard at the Protestant Episcopal Church in Rhinebeck, New York. Sheila was a clinical social worker who worked in Islamabad.

It is the capital of the district Wei√üenburg-Gunzenhausen. In 2010 its population was 17,513. Wei√üenburg was a Free Imperial City for 500 years. Geography =Location= Weissenburg is located in central Bavaria, in the south of the administrative region Mittelfranken. Large cities in the area are Ingolstadt (55.5 km), Nuremberg (61.7 km), Augsburg (85 km), Munich (134.6 km) and W√ºrzburg (150.4 km). =Subdivision= The municipality is divided into 27 Ortsteile: the main town and the 26 villages of Dettenheim, Emetzheim, G√§nswirtshaus, Haardt, Hagenbuch, Hammerm√ºhle, Hattenhof, H√§user am W√ºlzburger Berg, Heuberg, Holzingen, Kattenhochstatt, Kehl, Laubenthal, Markhof, Niederhofen, Oberhochstatt, Potschm√ºhle, Rohrwalk, Rothenstein (Wei√üenburg), Schleifer am Berg, Schmalwiesen, Stadelhof, Suffersheim, Weimersheim, Weissenhof and W√ºlzburg. History =Early history= A modern replica of Castell Biriciana The history of Wei√üenburg is generally traced back to the Roman fort that was built in the area towards the end of the first century. The settlement, which included Thermae, lay on the border of the Roman Empire and on the Tabula Peutingeriana from the 4th century it had the name Biriciana. Germanic tribes destroyed the fort and settled in what is still the city centre. The first mention of the name Wei√üenburg is in a deed dating from 867. The city became the seat of a royal residence during the reign of the Franks and according to legend, Charlemagne stayed there to supervise the construction of Fossa Carolina. The Free Imperial City of Wei√üenburg Illustrated map of Wei√üenburg, c. 1725 The city became a Free Imperial City in 1296 and continued to grow until the Reformation. Following the example of Nuremberg the city joined the Protestant side but it suffered heavily in the ensuing wars. However, the rights of the city as a Free Imperial City and an Imperial Estate were restored in the final peace treaty and some growth resumed. Despite its insignificant size and economic importance, the city, like the other 50-odd free imperial cities, was virtually independent. =Modern history= Weissenburg lost its independence in 1802 and became part of the Bavarian kingdom in 1806. It was however saved from insignificance with the construction of a railway between Nuremberg and Augsburg which goes through the city and which supported industrialisation. Following World War II over 6,000 refugees and people expelled from the territories which Germany lost settled in the city and have since played an important role in its industry and culture. The many stages in the history of Weissenburg can still be seen today. There are many ruins from the Roman times. One of the finest is the remains of a Roman bath which was excavated in 1977 and has been turned into a museum. The city wall from the Middle Ages has survived almost intact with its towers and in the Gothic Town Hall the city's elected members have held their meetings from 1476. Sights *The Ellinger Tor is the most famous City gate of Weissenburg. *The Bismarck tower is a memorial to the first German chancellor Otto von Bismarck. *The Castra Birciana is a former Roman military camp. =W√ºlzburg= W√ºlzburg is a historic fortress about east of the centre of Weissenburg. It stands on a hill above Weissenburg, at an elevation of , and was originally a Benedictine monastery dating from the 11th century. It was converted into a fortress from 1588 to 1605 and is one of the best-preserved Renaissance fortresses in Germany. Today it is part of the city of Weissenburg. During World War I, the future French leader Charles De Gaulle was imprisoned at the W√ºlzburg. The Nazis also used it as a prison camp during World War II; it was here that the Czech composer Erwin Schulhoff was held for over a year before he died of TB.

Normal weight at term delivery is . Causes LBW is either caused by preterm birth (that is, a low gestational age at birth, commonly defined as younger than 37 weeks of gestation) or the infant being small for gestational age (that is, a slow prenatal growth rate), or a combination of both. In general, risk factors in the mother that may contribute to low birth weight include young ages, multiple pregnancies, previous LBW infants, poor nutrition, heart disease or hypertension, untreated coeliac disease, drug addiction, alcohol abuse, and insufficient prenatal care. It can also be caused by prelabor rupture of membranes. Environmental risk factors include smoking, lead exposure, and other types of air pollutions. =Preterm birth= Four different pathways have been identified that can result in preterm birth and have considerable evidence: precocious fetal endocrine activation, uterine overdistension, decidual bleeding, and intrauterine inflammation/infection. From a practical point a number of factors have been identified that are associated with preterm birth, however, an association does not establish causality. =Being small for gestational age= Being small for gestational age can be constitutional, that is, without an underlying pathological cause, or it can be secondary to intrauterine growth restriction, which, in turn, can be secondary to many possible factors. For example, babies with congenital anomalies or chromosomal abnormalities are often associated with LBW. Problems with the placenta can prevent it from providing adequate oxygen and nutrients to the fetus. Infections during pregnancy that affect the fetus, such as rubella, cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, and syphilis, may also affect the baby's weight. =Environmental factors= While active maternal tobacco smoking has well established adverse perinatal outcomes such as LBW, that mothers who smoke during pregnancy are twice as likely to give birth to low-birth weight infants. Review on the effects of passive maternal smoking, also called environmental tobacco exposure (ETS), demonstrated that increased risks of infants with LBW were more likely to be expected in ETS-exposed mothers.Knopik VS. Maternal smoking during pregnancy and child outcomes: real or spurious effect? Dev Neuropsychol. 2009;34(1):1-36.Salmasi G, Grady R, Jones J, et al. Environmental tobacco smoke exposure and perinatal outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analyses. Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand. 2010;89(4):423-41. Regarding environmental toxins in pregnancy, elevated blood lead levels in pregnant women, even those well below 10 ug/dL can cause miscarriage, premature birth, and LBW in the offspring. Although 10 ug/dL is the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's ‚Äúlevel of concern‚Äù, this cut-off value still results in significant harm to gestating fetuses.Cleveland LM, Minter ML, Cobb KA, et al. Lead hazards for pregnant women and children: part 1: immigrants and the poor shoulder most of the burden of lead exposure in this country. Part 1 of a two-part article details how exposure happens, whom it affects, and the harm it can do. Am J Nurs. 2008 Oct;108(10):40-9 The combustion products of solid fuel in developing countries can cause many adverse health issues in people. Because a majority of pregnant women in developing countries, where rate of LBW is high, are heavily exposed to indoor air pollution, increased relative risk translates into substantial population attributable risk of 21% of LBW.Pope DP, Mishra V, Thompson L, et al. Risk of low birth weight and stillbirth associated with indoor air pollution from solid fuel use in developing countries. Epidemiol Rev. 2010 Apr;32(1):70-81 The potentially harmful effects of air pollution are particularly concerning given the pervasiveness of air pollution. The exact mechanism by which air pollution affects fetuses is unknown, but it is suggested that air pollutants enter the body through direct diffusion or active transport. Once in the body, it is thought that air pollutants affect birth outcomes by oxidative stress, changes in hemodynamic factors, disruption of endocrine systems, and finally with genetic and epigenetic changes. One environmental exposure which has been found to increase the risk of low birth weight is particulate matter, a component of ambient air pollution. Because particulate matter is composed of extremely small particles, even nonvisible levels can be inhaled and present harm to the fetus. Particulate matter exposure can cause inflammation, oxidative stress, endocrine disruption, and impaired oxygen transport access to the placenta, all of which are mechanisms for heightening the risk of low birth weight. When inhaled, particles smaller than 1 ¬µm can penetrate the alveolar wall, enter the maternal bloodstream so that particles and inflammatory mediators cross the placenta, and reach the fetus. Some studies have indicated that PM2.5 exposure during the second trimester may lead to the strongest effects on low birth weight. To reduce exposure to particulate matter, pregnant women can monitor the EPA‚Äôs Air Quality Index and take personal precautionary measures such as reducing outdoor activity on low quality days, avoiding high-traffic roads/intersections, and/or wearing personal protective equipment (i.e., facial mask of industrial design). Indoor exposure to particulate matter can also be reduced through adequate ventilation, as well as use of clean heating and cooking methods. Other environmental exposures that have been shown to increase the rates of low birth weight are compounds that are associated with traffic-related pollution, most significantly, nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Nitrogen dioxide is often used as an indicator of traffic-related air pollution. Stieb et al. used national data to study the association between nitrogen dioxide exposure and pregnancy outcomes in 2.5 million births in Canada between 1999 and 2008 using land use regression models to estimate nitrogen dioxide concentrations. They found that exposure to nitrogen dioxide was associated with 4% higher odds of giving birth to a child that is small for gestational age. Even after the researchers adjusted for neighborhood socioeconomic factors, there was still a strong association between nitrogen dioxide and low birth weight. This research also showed evidence of a dose-response relationship, meaning that more exposure to nitrogen dioxide an expectant mother was exposed to, the higher the likelihood of giving birth to a low birth weight child. The association between traffic- related pollution and low birth weight has been observed in multiple studies conducted in different parts of the world. G√©n√©reux et al. studied a population of Canadian women and found that living close to highways is associated with adverse birth outcomes, even among women considered high socioeconomic status. Ghosh et al. examined 4 air toxin monitoring stations in Los Angeles, California, and found that the odds of a low birth weight child increased by 2-5% when mothers were exposed to nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, and nitrogen oxides. Furthermore, these researchers found that traffic exhaust leads to low birth weight in long-term and short-term exposure, especially in the third trimester. In a study of Swedish newborn children, researchers used ultrasound techniques to show that exposure to nitrogen oxides consistently and negatively affected fetal growth late in pregnancy (after 7 months). Furthermore, they found that the population that was affected had relatively low exposures, which were generally below WHO air quality guidelines. Another measure of air pollution is exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from motor vehicle exhaust, which has been associated with a 1-3% increased odds of low birth weight. It is hypothesized that hydrocarbons, which can cross into the placenta, have antiestrogenic effects and also cause DNA damage that leads to apoptosis or cell death. A correlation between maternal exposure to carbon monoxide (CO) and low birth weight has been reported that the effect on birth weight of increased ambient CO was as large as the effect of the mother smoking a pack of cigarettes per day during pregnancy.Lewtas J. Air pollution combustion emissions: characterization of causative agents and mechanisms associated with cancer, reproductive, and cardiovascular effects. Mutat Res. 2007 Nov-Dec;636(1-3):95-133. It has been revealed that adverse reproductive effects (e.g., risk for LBW) were correlated with maternal exposure to air pollution combustion emissions in Eastern Europe and North America. Mercury is a known toxic heavy metal that can harm fetal growth and health, and there has been evidence showing that exposure to mercury (via consumption of large oily fish) during pregnancy may be related to higher risks of LBW in the offspring. It has also been hypothesized that another air pollutant, ozone, can cause low birth weight. While ozone has been associated with preterm delivery, studies linking ozone and low birth weight have been inconsistent. Some have shown a positive association between the two, others have shown no association, and some have found that ozone may actually be a protective factor against low birth weight. This last phenomenon is potentially explained by studies that have shown that ozone can activate an antioxidant system, which may help bring oxygen to tissues. It was revealed that, exposure of pregnant women to airplane noise was found to be associated with low birth weight. Aircraft noise exposure caused adverse effects on fetal growth leading to low birth weight and preterm infants. The annual low birth weight prevalence in Japan from 2012 onward was associated with the prefecture-specific dose-rate derived from Cs-137 deposition after the Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant accidents in March 2011. One ŒºSv/h (equivalent to 8.8 mSv/year) increases the odds of observing low birth weight events by approximately 10%. Periodontal health Low birthweight, pre-term birth and pre-eclampsia have been associated with maternal periodontitis exposure. But the strength of the observed associations is inconsistent and vary according to the population studied, the means of periodontal assessment and the periodontal disease classification employed. However the best is that the risk of low birth weight can be reduced with very simple therapy. Treatment of periodontal disease during gestation period is safe and reduction in inflammatory burden reduces the risk of preterm birth as well as low birth weight. Effects LBW is closely associated with fetal and Perinatal mortality and Morbidity, inhibited growth and cognitive development, and chronic diseases later in life. At the population level, the proportion of babies with a LBW is an indicator of a multifaceted public-health problem that includes long-term maternal malnutrition, ill health, hard work and poor health care in pregnancy. On an individual basis, LBW is an important predictor of newborn health and survival and is associated with higher risk of infant and childhood mortality. Low birth weight constitutes as sixty to eighty percent of the infant mortality rate in developing countries. Infant mortality due to low birth weight is usually directly causal, stemming from other medical complications such as preterm birth, PPROM, poor maternal nutritional status, lack of prenatal care, maternal sickness during pregnancy, and an unhygienic home environment. According to an analysis by University of Oregon, reduced brain volume in children is also tied to low birth-weight. Epidemiology Low birth weight world map (2002) A study by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) found that of the 3.8 million births that occurred in the United States in 2011, approximately 6.1% (231,900) were diagnosed with low birth weight (<2,500 g). Approximately 49,300 newborns (1.3%) weighed less than 1,500 grams (VLBW).Kowlessar N.M., Jiang H.J., and Steiner C. Hospital Stays for Newborns, 2011. HCUP Statistical Brief #163. October 2013.

It also defines the term \\"religious exercise\\" to include \\"any exercise of religion, whether or not compelled by, or central to, a system of religious belief.\\"Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. p 1 RLUIPA was enacted by the United States Congress in 2000 to correct the problems of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) of 1993. The act was passed in both the House of Representatives and the Senate by unanimous consent in voice votes, meaning that no objection was raised to its passage, so no written vote was taken. The S. 2869 legislation was enacted into law by the 42nd President of the United States Bill Clinton on September 22, 2000. Previous law In 1997, the United States Supreme Court held the RFRA to be unconstitutional as applied to state and local governments, in City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507. Unlike the RFRA, which required religious accommodation in virtually all spheres of life, RLUIPA only applies to prisoner and land use cases. In Employment Div. Dep't of Human Resources v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 883‚Äì85 (1990), the Supreme Court held that a substantial burden on religious exercise was subject to very strict scrutiny where the law \\"lent itself to individualized governmental assessment of the reasons for the relevant conduct.\\" It was not a case permitting exceptions for freedom of religion when generally applicable health and welfare regulations were in question, and it should be remembered that Smith lost this case (involving a denial of unemployment benefits where the litigant had used illegal drugs in a religious ceremony). In line with the scrutiny regime established in West Coast Hotel v. Parrish in 1937, the Court ruled that unless the law is not one of general applicability, regardless of specific circumstance, government may act if policy is rationally related to a legitimate government interest, even if the act imposes a substantial burden on the exercise of religion. Prisoners In the 2005 case of Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.S. 709 (2005), five prisoners in Ohio ‚Äì including a Wiccan, a Satanist, and a member of a racist, allegedly Christian, sect ‚Äì successfully sought to apply the protections of the act to their religious practices. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit had held that RLUIPA violated the Establishment Clause by impermissibly advancing religion by bestowing benefits to religious prisoners that were unavailable to non-religious prisoners. The U.S. Supreme Court disagreed, unanimously holding that RLUIPA was a permissible accommodation of religion justified by the fact that the government itself had severely burdened the prisoners' religious rights through the act of incarceration. A concurring opinion by Justice Thomas noted that the states could escape the restrictions of RLUIPA simply by refusing federal funds for state prisons. Cutter v. Wilkinson only concerns the prisoner portion of RLUIPA. The court explicitly declined to extend the rule to land use cases. In a unanimous opinion issued March 15, 2011, that reverses the three-judge panel's May 2010 ruling, a limited en banc panel of 11 judges of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that an Orange County courthouse lockup is an \\"institution\\" under the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, meaning a Muslim woman who sued after being forced to remove her headscarf in front of strange men is entitled to the act's protections. The case is Khatib v. County of Orange, 08-56423. The lawsuit started as a result of court bailiffs ordering the woman to remove her headscarf while she was temporarily being held inside the courthouse lock up while a county court judge was deciding whether or not to revoke her misdemeanor probation (she was released that same day after the judge decided not to). The District Court had dismissed the case, with said dismissal being upheld by the three-judge appellate panel. The case has now been reversed and sent back to the trial court for further proceedings. It is the first time that a temporary holding facility (like a courthouse lockup) has been deemed to be an \\"institution\\" under the Act. The law, passed by Congress in 2000, prohibits the government from imposing a \\"substantial burden\\" on prisoners' religious practices unless officials can show a compelling need for the restrictions. The Obama administration joined Khatib in arguing that the law applied to courthouse holding cells. In 2008, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights issued a report entitled \\"Enforcing Religious Freedom in Prison.\\"U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, Enforcing Religious Freedom in Prison (2008). See also the separate Statement of Commissioner Heriot, which is appended to the report and also available separately. Zoning and land use In religious land use disputes, RLUIPA's general rule is the most commonly cited and challenged section. It provides: 42 U.S.C. ¬ß 2000cc(a). During these disputes, the correct interpretation of the term \\"land use regulation\\" is almost always an issue. The statute defines \\"land use regulation\\" as \\"a zoning or landmarking law, or the application of such a law, that limits or restricts a claimant's use or development of land (including a structure affixed to land), if the claimant has an ownership, leasehold, easement, servitude, or other property interest in the regulated land or a contract or option to acquire such an interest.\\" 42 U.S.C. ¬ß 2000cc-5(5). = RLUIPA and planning debate = The passage of RLUIPA gave rise to increasing number of legal cases whereby (local) planning authorities are sued for violating the free exercise of religion. RLUIPA, therefore, generated heated discussions within professional planning communities. While its advocates (mostly in Congress) argued that this federal statute prevents urban planners from substantially burdening religious practice, its critics (many of whom were planning practitioners) maintained that RLUIPA, in fact, substantially burdens planning practice itself. The American Planning Association (APA), for example, opposed RLUIPA (and its predecessor, RFRA) from the outset, arguing that these statutes effectively change ‚Äúthe playing field in favor of religious institutions‚Äù and put local governments ‚Äúin an untenable position.‚Äù In 2005, however, the Supreme Court ruled, in Cutter v. Wilkinson, that RLUIPA is constitutional, at least as it applies to prisons. Since the mid-2000s, therefore, the APA has been offering vital resources to local governments and practicing planners as to how to effectively navigate the renewed legal-religious landscape of the planning field. =Is eminent domain a land use regulation under RLUIPA?= Litigation focusing on the term \\"land use regulation\\" occasionally asks courts to decide whether RLUIPA applies to eminent domain proceedings. Generally, courts deciding this question have held that RLUIPA does not apply to eminent domain because it is not a \\"zoning or landmarking law.\\" Instead, these courts have held that zoning and eminent domain are two completely different and unrelated concepts. The main argument to support this conclusion is that zoning and eminent domain are derived from two separate sources of power. The zoning power is derived from the state's police power, while the eminent domain power is derived from the Takings Clause of the United States Constitution's Fifth Amendment. However, at least one court has applied the RLUIPA in an eminent-domain case because the authority to condemn the property came from the city's zoning scheme. A court may be more inclined to find that eminent domain falls within the scope of RLUIPA if it was authorized by a zoning ordinance or comprehensive plan. To date, no cases questioning RLUIPA's application to eminent domain have reached the Supreme Court. A 2003 Seventh Circuit case, St. John's United Church of Christ v. City of Chicago, was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, but the court declined to hear the appeal. A refusal to hear means that the Supreme Court did not consider the Seventh Circuit Court's decision to be obviously wrong on the legal merits, or that the facts of the particular case could have broader constitutional implications. The Supreme Court generally has a substantial workload and tends to refuse appeals which have already received due process in lower courts. A refusal to hear a case does not preclude hearing a similar case in the future, if the court feels that further judicial review is needed. Cases interpreting RLUIPA's application to eminent domain =St. John's United Church of Christ v. City of Chicago= The controversy in this case centered around the expansion of Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. In order to expand this airport, the City needed to acquire of adjacent land through condemnation. Among the properties to be condemned were two cemeteries, one owned by St. John's United Church of Christ, and the other by Rest Haven Cemetery Association. In their amended complaint, St. John's and Rest Haven alleged that condemnation of their cemeteries was a violation of RLUIPA. After a revision to the O'Hare Modernization Project, Rest Haven's cemetery was no longer faced with condemnation and this church dropped out of the lawsuit. St. John's Church argued that the condemnation action substantially burdened its freedom of religious practice because \\"[A] major tenet of its religious beliefs [was] that the remains of those buried at the [St. John's] St. Johannes Cemetery must not be disturbed until God raises these remains on the 'Day of Resurrection'.\\" This Court had to decide whether eminent domain fit within RLUIPA's definition of a \\"land use regulation.\\" The Court held that eminent domain was not a \\"land use regulation.\\" The Court cited the case of Faith Temple Church v. Town of Brighton to support its position that \\"zoning and eminent domain are 'two distinct concepts' that involve land in 'very different ways'.\\" St. John's Church also argued that the O'Hare Modernization Act, which authorized the condemnations, was a zoning law, and it invoked the protection of RLUIPA's in condemnation cases derived from the Act. The Court rejected this argument and suggested that Congress would have included eminent domain in the language of RLUIPA if it had intended for the statute to cover eminent domain. After considering the case, the Seventh Circuit Court denied St. John's motion for a preliminary injunction. =Cottonwood Christian Center v. Cypress Redevelopment Agency= Cottonwood Christian Center filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to prevent the City of Cypress from taking its land through eminent domain. The controversy in this case arose when Cottonwood purchased land in Cypress and planned to build a large church and other church-related buildings on an plot of land. Since the church was to be built in an area that only allowed churches if they received a Conditional Use Permit (CUP) from Cypress, Cottonwood applied for a CUP. Cypress denied Cottonwood's application. Instead, the city planned to build a shopping mall that included Cottonwood's land. They later scaled the mall down to a Costco store that was solely on Cottonwood's plot. Cypress offered to purchase the land and Cottonwood did not accept. As a result, Cypress initiated eminent domain proceedings to acquire the property under a zoning ordinance called the Los Alamitos Race Track and Golf Course Redevelopment Project (LART Plan). The LART Plan authorized the use of eminent domain as a way to redevelop the area where Cottonwood's land was located. Cottonwood argued that because the eminent domain proceedings stemmed from the LART Plan zoning scheme, they violated RLUIPA. The Court granted a preliminary injunction against Cypress. The Court held that RLUIPA applied in this case, and therefore, the Court used a strict scrutiny standard of review. In its analysis, the Court found that it took Cottonwood five years to identify a location and negotiate for the land. After all the church had invested, the City's actions placed a substantial burden on the churches' religious exercise without presenting a compelling government interest for doing so. =Faith Temple Church v. Town of Brighton= Faith Temple Church brought an action to enjoin the Town of Brighton from condemning its property through eminent domain. Faith Temple was a church that had outgrown its needs at its original location. In order to accommodate its larger congregation, it negotiated and eventually purchased a parcel of land in January 2004. In its Comprehensive Plan for 2000, the Town had included a recommendation that this parcel be acquired. The purpose of the acquisition was to expand an adjacent town-owned park. After the church purchased the land, the Town initiated condemnation proceedings in the spring of 2004. RLUIPA's application to eminent domain was at issue in this case because Faith Temple argued that the recommendation in the Town's Comprehensive Plan was essentially a \\"zoning law.\\" Further, if the recommendation was a zoning law, then Faith Temple argued that condemnation was \\"the application of a zoning law\\" and was a violation of RLUIPA. The Court held that RLUIPA was inapplicable to this case. The judge found that the connection between zoning and eminent domain in this case was \\"too attenuated to constitute the application of a zoning law.\\" Therefore, summary judgment was granted in favor of the Town, denying injunctive relief. =City and County of Honolulu v. Sherman= This case was an appeal to the Supreme Court of Hawaii which stemmed from a Honolulu city and county ordinance. The ordinance gave the city and county eminent domain authority in \\"[A]ctions for [ ] lease-to-fee conversion[s] of certain leased-fee interests.\\" Using the authority granted by the ordinance, the City of Honolulu initiated condemnation proceedings to obtain thirty-four leasehold condominium units in the Admiral Thomas condominium complex. The purpose behind the condemnation proceedings was to \\"conver[t] the leasehold [interests] to fee simple [interests] on behalf of forty-seven owner-occupant[s]\\" (the lessees). The plaintiff-appellee in the action was the City and the defendant-appellant was First United Methodist Church as the fee owner of the Admiral Thomas condominium complex. First United counterclaimed the condemnation proceedings and cited a violation of RLUIPA. Using the Cottonwood case for support, First United argued that eminent domain is a \\"land use regulation\\" and that RLUIPA should be a defense to the City's action. While First United argued that its exercise of religion had been burdened by the eminent domain proceedings, the City argued that First United had not proven this and that \\"the Church's exercise of religion [was] unaffected.\\" Affirming the decision of the circuit court granting summary judgment in favor of the City, the Court held that RLUIPA could not be used as a defense to eminent domain proceedings authorized under the ordinance. The Court supported this holding by stating that eminent domain and zoning are different concepts and that it would not \\"assume that Congress simply overlooked [eminent domain] when drafting RLUIPA.\\" Since Congress did not include the term \\"eminent domain\\" in the RLUIPA statute, the Court decided that Congress did not want it to be included. Therefore, the Court did not apply RLUIPA in this case. Law review articles about RLUIPA's application to eminent domain *Kris Banvard, Comment, Exercise in Frustration?

Until 2014, the company also operated a group of websites aimed towards the B2B market‚Äîparticularly blogs covering various aspects of the media industry. In August 2014, Mediabistro sold its editorial properties to Prometheus Global Media, a subsidiary of Guggenheim Partners, for $8 million. The company announced it would liquidate itself on December 22, 2015  History  In 1994, Alan Meckler, then CEO of Mecklermedia, created MecklerWeb as an addendum to his offerings in print (Virtual Reality World, CDrom World, and Internet World) and conferences (Internet World, Virtual Reality World). In 1995, as advertising-supported publishing emerged as a viable business model on the Web, the Website was relaunched by Tristan Louis under the name iWorld and began to publish content for the nascent Internet industry. As the Internet World conference prospered, iWorld set out on a strategy of acquiring successful Websites that were focused on technology content, such as Webopedia, SearchEngineWatch and WebReference. In 1997, the online division was renamed internet.com, after acquiring rights to the domain name from The Internet Company. In 1998, Mecklermedia Corp. was acquired by Penton Media and the online assets were spun off into a separate company called Internet.com LLC. Internet.com went public on the NASDAQ in the second half of 1999 (trading as INTM). In 1999, internet.com Corp. launched the Search Engine Strategies conference and in 2000, it acquired Earthweb and incorporated it into the JupiterWeb network. In 2002, the company purchased the Jupiter Research business from Jupiter Media Metrix and renamed itself from INT Media to Jupitermedia, with a new stock ticker symbol JUPM. In 2004, the company started acquiring image assets and developed Jupiterimages as a separate stock photography division, which operated two online image libraries, stock.xchng, a library of free-to-use photographs and illustrations, and StockXpert, a low- cost Microstock photography site. In 2005, Jupitermedia sold SearchEngineWatch to Incisive Media. In 2006, Jupitermedia sold its JupiterResearch division to MCG Capital Corporation. In 2007, the company operates as two divisions, JupiterImages and Jupiter Online Media. In 2008, JupiterResearch was acquired by Forrester Research. In October 2008, Jupitermedia announced that they would be selling their online images division, Jupiterimages, to the stock photography agency Getty Images for $96 million in cash. The sale went ahead in February 2009; Jupiterimages (including the sites stock.xchng and StockXpert) is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Getty.

It was developed in Canada from the LAV II family and is the primary mechanized infantry vehicle of both the Canadian Army and the New Zealand Army. It also forms the basis of the Stryker vehicle used by the US Army and other operators. Development By July 1991, the Canadian Armed Forces had identified the need to replace their aging fleet of 1960s and 1970s era armoured personnel carriers. As a result, $2.8 billion was earmarked for the Multi-Role Combat Vehicle (MRCV) project by the sitting Conservative government. The mandate of the MRCV project was to provide a series of vehicles based on a common chassis which would replace the M113 armored personnel carrier, Lynx reconnaissance vehicle, Grizzly armoured personnel carrier, and Bison armoured personnel carrier. The project was, however, deemed unaffordable and cancelled by March 1992. By 1994, after the Liberal Party had returned to government, the army was still in need of new vehicles. As a result, the army embarked on the Light Armoured Vehicle Project, which would adapt parts of the MRCV Project, and be implemented incrementally to spread out the costs. Also, the requirement to replace the Bisons was dropped. The first phase of the project saw the selection of the Coyote Reconnaissance Vehicle to replace the Lynx. On August 16, 1995, it was announced that General Motors Diesel Division (later renamed GM Defense, and subsequently purchased by General Dynamics Land Systems of London, Ontario) had been awarded the contract to produce the LAV III which would replace the Grizzly and a large portion of the M113 armoured personnel carriers. The LAV III would incorporate the turret and weapon system used with the Coyote (which was produced at the same location). =Future= Canadian Army LAV VI In July 2009, the Canadian Department of National Defence announced that $5 billion would be spent to enhance, replace and repair the army's armoured vehicles. Part of the spending would be used to replace and repair damaged LAV III's due to wear and tear from operations in Afghanistan. As much as 33 percent of the army's light armoured vehicles were out of service. Furthermore, the LAV III's will be upgraded with improved protection and automotive components. The Canadian Armed Forces has lost over 34 vehicles and 359 were damaged during the mission in Afghanistan. The Canadian army has lost 13 LAVs and more than 159 were damaged by roadside bombs or enemy fire. Of the $5 billion announced, approximately 20% of it will be used to upgrade LAV III models. The upgrade will extend the LAV III life span to 2035. The remaining $4 billion is to be spent on a \\"new family of land combat vehicles\\". The Department of National Defence considered the purchase of vehicles meant to accompany the Leopard 2 and to sustain the LAV III into combat. The CV90, the Puma (IFV) and the V√©hicule blind√© de combat d'infanterie were the most likely candidates for the role. A contract of 108 with an option for up to 30 more was considered, but a combination of budget cuts and upgrades to the existing fleet of LAV IIIs have led the Canadian Army to cancel its order for 108 CV90s. On October 21, 2011, the Canadian government announced a $1.1 billion contract to General Dynamics Land Systems to upgrade 550 LAV III combat vehicles. The government said the upgrade is needed to improve protection against mines and improvised explosive devices (IEDs), which have been the cause of a number of Canadian deaths in Afghanistan. The improvements will also extend the service of the vehicles up to 2035 and will boost troop mobility. The upgrades include a new and more powerful engine, increased armour protection, steering and brake systems. The turret hatches on the LAV III would be made larger and improved fire control, thermal, day and low-light sights, and data displays. The weight of the vehicle would increase from to . The first of 66 upgraded LAV IIIs was delivered on February 1, 2013.Canadian army receives first of 66 upgraded LAV III vehicles ‚Äì Armyrecognition.com, February 1, 2013 The success of the upgrade program and budget pressures led to the cancellation of the Close Combat Vehicle replacement program later that year. In September 2012, the original contract valued to at $1.064 billion to upgrade the 550 LAV III's variants, an infantry section carrier, a command post, an observation post and an engineer vehicle to the LAV VI configuration, was modified. This included an additional $151 million to upgrade 66 LAV III's to the LAV VI with a LAV Reconnaissance and Surveillance System (LRSS) fitted. On February 10, 2017, General Dynamics Land Systems ‚Äì Canada of London, Ontario, was awarded a $404 million order to work on 141 LAV Operational Requirement Integration Task (LORIT) vehicles. This contract will upgrade the remaining LAV III fleet in the Canadian Army to the LAV VI configuration. This brings the Canadian Army's Light Armoured Vehicle III Upgrade (LAVUP) program to a total cost of $1.8 billion. Final completion and delivery of the Canadian Army's Light Armoured Vehicle III Upgrade (LAVUP) to upgrade the LAV III to the LAV VI is expected to be completed by December 2019. On August 16, 2019, the Government of Canada announced its intention to purchase up to 360 Armoured Combat Support Vehicles (ACSVs), and that negotiations with General Dynamics Land Systems Canada had entered the final stages. Based heavily on the LAV 6.0/VI platform, the ACSVs will replace the Bison LAV and the M113 Tracked LAV fleets of the Canadian Armed Forces. On September 5, 2019, Public Services and Procurement Canada on behalf of the Department of National Defence awarded General Dynamics Land Systems Canada a CAD$2 Billion contract for 360 ACSVs, initial spare parts, manuals, training, and various vehicle add-on kits. The various add-on kits incorporated in the procurement include: add-on armour, mine blast & enhanced crew protection, laser warning systems, side protection and remote weapons station kits. The Department of National Defence stated that by procuring similar combat support vehicles in the CAF fleet offers the advantages of reduced training and sustainment costs, in addition to the availability of standard spare parts to fix vehicles quickly during critical operations. The vehicles are expected to support a wide range of operations, including domestic disaster relief and overseas peacekeeping missions. Subsequently, the ACSV will be available in eight variants to provide services such as: ambulances, vehicle recovery, engineering, mobile repair, electronic warfare, troop-carrying, and mobile command posts. Delivery of the first set of vehicles is expected in late 2020, with the last vehicles being delivered in 2025. On May 25, 2020, Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace announced that they had signed a contract worth NOK500 Million (CAD$73.6 Million) with General Dynamics Land Systems - Canada for delivery of the newest generation of Protector Remote Weapons Stations (or RWS) to the Canadian Army. The Protector RWS is to be equipped on Canada's fleet of ACSVs. It was subsequently announced on June 1, 2020, that delivery of the first ACSVs was still on schedule for late 2020 and would not be delayed in spite of the COVID-19 pandemic. Design =Mobility= Canadian infantry dismounting from a LAV III at CFB Gagetown The LAV III is powered by a Caterpillar 3126 diesel engine developing and can reach speeds above 100 kilometres per hour. The vehicle is fitted with 8x8 drive and also equipped with a central tire inflation system, which allows it to adjust to different terrain, including off-road. The LAV III is fitted with a modern anti-locking brake system (ABS). Unlike earlier versions of the LAV, the LAV III does not have amphibious capabilities. Tekapo Military Camp The LAV III faces the same concerns that most other wheeled military vehicles face. Like all wheeled armoured vehicles, the LAV III's ground pressure is inherently higher than a tracked vehicle with a comparable weight. This is because tires will have less surface area in contact with the ground when compared to a tracked vehicle. Higher ground pressure results in an increased likelihood of sinking into soft terrain such as mud, snow and sand, leading to the vehicle becoming stuck. The lower ground pressure and improved traction offered by tracked vehicles also gives them an advantage over vehicles like the LAV III when it comes to managing slopes, trenches, and other obstacles. The LAV III can somewhat compensate for these effects by deflating its tires slightly, meaning that the surface area in contact with the ground increases, and the ground pressure is slightly lowered. A Canadian LAV-III during exercise TRIDENT JUNCTURE However, wheels offer several advantages over tracked vehicles, including lower maintenance for both the vehicle and road infrastructure, quieter movement for improved stealth, greater speed over good terrain, and higher ground clearance. Wheeled vehicle crews are also more likely to survive mine or IED attacks than the crew of a similarly armoured tracked vehicle. The LAV III's turret gives the vehicle a higher centre of gravity than the vehicle was initially designed for. This has led to concerns that the vehicle is more likely to roll over on uneven terrain. While there have been several recorded rollovers (about 16), the most common cause was found to be unstable terrain, specifically road shoulders unexpectedly giving away beneath the vehicle. The weight balance of the LAV III is taken into consideration during driver training, largely mitigating the chances of a rollover. It is considered one of the safest and most well- rounded vehicles of its kind in the world. =Protection= Nanuk Remotely Controlled Weapon The basic armour of the LAV III, covering the Standardization Agreement STANAG 4569 level III, which provides all-round protection against 7.62√ó51mm NATO small calibre rounds. A ceramic appliqu√© armour (MEXAS) can be added, which protects against 14.5√ó114mm heavy calibre rounds from 500 meters. In December 2008 the Government of Canada awarded EODC Engineering, Developing and Licensing Inc. C$81.5 million worth of contracts to provide for add-on-armour kits, modules and spares for its LAV III wheeled armoured personnel carriers. This armour kit is intended to provide increased protection against improvised explosive devices (IED), explosively formed penetrators and 30 mm caliber armour piercing rounds.http://www.3-4cav.asn.au/canada_up_armouring_its_lav_111.pdf The LAV III can be also fitted with cage armour, which provides protection against shaped charges. The LAV III is fitted with a nuclear, biological, chemical (NBC) filtration system accompanied with a GID-3 chemical detector and AN/VDR-2 radiation detector systems. The LAV III was designed to produce a very low and very compact structure to minimize radar and IR-signatures. The LAV III also uses heat-absorbing filters to provide temporary protection against thermal imaging (TIS), image intensifiers and infrared cameras (IR). General Dynamics is in the process of integrating the LAV III with an active protection systemGeneral Dynamics Developing LAV III with Fully Integrated Active Protection System ‚Äì Deagel.com, May 29, 2013 based on the Israeli Trophy system.US-Israeli Team To Demo APS for Canada ‚Äì Defensenews.com, October 15, 2013. The majority of Canadian casualties in Afghanistan have occurred during a patrol aboard a LAV III. This can be explained by the fact that the LAV III is the most commonly used Canadian armoured personnel carrier in theatre, and simply represents a normal association between use and likelihood to encounter a mine or improvised explosive device. The LAV III offers comparable or better protection than most other infantry carriers used in Afghanistan. In an effort to improve protection as a result of experiences in Afghanistan, future LAV III upgrades will likely include improved mine and IED protection. =Armament= The LAV III is fitted with a two-man turret, armed with the M242 Bushmaster 25 mm caliber chain gun and a coaxial 7.62-mm machine gun. One more 5.56 mm or 7.62 mm machine guns is positioned on top of the turret. The LAV III also has eight 76-mm grenade launchers in two clusters of four launchers positioned on each side of the turret. The grenade launchers are intended for smoke grenades. In 2009, a number of LAV III's were modified with a Nanuk remotely controlled weapon station (RCWS) to provide better protection and to increase the chances of survival of the crew against improvised explosive devices and anti-tank mine threats on the battlefield. =Sights= The LAV III is equipped with a daytime optical Thermal Imaging System (TIS) and Generation III Image Intensification (II). The LAV III is equipped with a Tactical Navigation System (TacNav) to assist in navigation and target location tasks. The LAV III is equipped with an LCD monitor directly connected to the vehicle's external cameras, providing real-time images of the battlefield for the passengers. Service history A NZLAV The LAV III and related versions have been used in the following: *United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE) *United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) *United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina (UNMIBH) *United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH) *War in Afghanistan (ISAF) *Napier shootings *Operation Lotus *Response to the 2011 Christchurch earthquake *Colombian armed conflict =New Zealand= The New Zealand armed forces purchased 105 LAV of which 102 were standard vehicles and 3 were redesigned for recovery. In May 2009, two NZLAVs were deployed to support police during the Napier shootings. They protected specialist police while retrieving the body of a deceased police officer from outside the offender's residence. In November 2009, it was announced that three NZLAVs would be deployed to assist NZSAS operations in Afghanistan and they were up-armoured. In 2011, these three LAVs were moved to Bamyan to support the provincial reconstruction team there as they were no longer needed in Kabul due to reduced SAS numbers. Five additional LAVs were also flown to Bamyan. One has since been damaged by a roadside bomb. In May 2012, the New Zealand government announced that it may leave all these LAVs behind in Afghanistan for use by local forces when the New Zealand forces leave in 2013. As of November 2013, all of these deployed LAVs had been returned to New Zealand. In 2011, after the Christchurch earthquake, LAVs from Burnham Camp were deployed to assist police with securing the inner city during the nights. In March 2016, two LAVs were deployed to assist with lifting a siege near Kawerau in the Bay of Plenty after four policemen were shot at and severely injured.

The Convention also sets out which people do not qualify as refugees, such as war criminals. The Convention also provides for some visa-free travel for holders of refugee travel documents issued under the convention. The Refugee Convention builds on Article 14 of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which recognizes the right of persons to seek asylum from persecution in other countries. A refugee may enjoy rights and benefits in a state in addition to those provided for in the Convention.Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, Article 5. The rights created by the Convention generally still stand today. Some have argued that the complex nature of 21st century refugee relationships calls for a new treaty that recognizes the evolving nature of the nation-state, population displacement, environmental migrants, and modern warfare. Nevertheless, ideas like the principle of non-refoulement (Article 33) are still applied today, with the 1951 Convention being the source of such rights. History The Convention was approved at a special United Nations conference on 28 July 1951, and entered into force on 22 April 1954. It was initially limited to protecting European refugees from before 1 January 1951 (after World War II), though states could make a declaration that the provisions would apply to refugees from other places. The 1967 Protocol removed the time limits and applied to refugees \\"without any geographic limitation\\", but declarations previously made by parties to the Convention on geographic scope were grandfathered. Parties As of 20 January 2020, there were 146 parties to the Convention, and 147 to the Protocol.UNHCR: States Parties to the Convention and Protocol, retrieved 15 July 2010 Madagascar and Saint Kitts and Nevis are parties only to the Convention, while Cape Verde, the United States of America and Venezuela are parties only to the Protocol. Since the US ratified the Protocol in 1968, it undertook a majority of the obligations spelled out in the original 1951 document (Articles 2-34), and Article 1 as amended in the Protocol, as \\"supreme Law of the Land\\".Joan Fitzpatrick, \\"The International Dimension of U.S. Refugee Law\\", 15 Berkeley J. Int'l. Law 1, Berkeley Law Scholarship Repository, 1997 Definition of refugee Article 1 of the Convention defines a refugee as:United Nations High Commission for Refugees. (2012). Text of Convention. Retrieved 5 May 2012. What is a Refugee?What is a Refugee? With the passage of time and the emergence of new refugee situations, the need was increasingly felt to make the provisions of the 1951 Convention applicable to such new refugees. As a result, a Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees was prepared, and entered into force on 4 October 1967. ¬ß C(8). The UNHCR is called upon to provide international protection to refugees falling within its competence. ¬ß E(14). The Protocol defined refugee to mean any person within the 1951 Convention definition as if the words \\"As a result of events occurring before 1 January 1951 and ...\\" were omitted.Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees of 31 January 1967 - English text, Article I ¬ß 2. Several groups have built upon the 1951 Convention to create a more objective definition. While their terms differ from those of the 1951 Convention, the Convention has significantly shaped the new, more objective definitions. They include the 1969 Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa by the Organisation of African Unity (since 2002 African Union) and the 1984 Cartagena Declaration, while nonbinding, also sets out regional standards for refugees in South and Central Americas, Mexico and the Caribbean.UNHCR. \\"LA SITUACI√ìN DE LOS REFUGIADOS EN AM√âRICA LATINA: PROTECCION Y SOLUCIONES BAJO EL ENFOQUE PRAGM√ÅTICO DE LA DECLARACI√ìN DE CARTAGENA SOBRE LOS REFUGIADOS DE 1984\\". 2004 (in Spanish).http://www.oas.org/DIL/xxxiv/Documentos/Juan%20Carlos%20Murillo/JCMurillo.DOCUME~1.DOC Rights and responsibilities of parties to the Refugee Convention In the general principle of international law, treaties in force are binding upon the parties to it and must be performed in good faith. Countries that have ratified the Refugee Convention are obliged to protect refugees that are on their territory, in accordance with its terms.UNHCR: Refugee protection: A Guide to International Refugee Law, 2001, , retrieved 19 August 2015 There are a number of provisions that States parties to the Refugee Convention must adhere to. Refugees shall * abide by the national laws of the contracting states (Article 2) The contracting states shall * exempt refugees from reciprocity (Article 7): That means that the granting of a right to a refugee should not be subject to the granting of similar treatment by the refugee's country of nationality, because refugees do not enjoy the protection of their home state. * be able to take provisional measures against a refugee if needed in the interest of essential national security (Article 9) * respect a refugee's personal status and the rights that come with it, particularly rights related to marriage (Article 12) * provide free access to courts for refugees (Article 16) * provide administrative assistance for refugees (Article 25) * provide identity papers for refugees (Article 27) * provide travel documents for refugees (Article 28) * allow refugees to transfer their assets (Article 30) * provide the possibility of assimilation and naturalization to refugees (Article 34) * cooperate with the UNHCR (Article 35) in the exercise of its functions and to help UNHCR supervise the implementation of the provisions in the Convention. * provide information on any national legislation they may adopt to ensure the application of the Convention (Article 36). * settle disputes they may have with other contracting states at the International Court of Justice if not otherwise possible (Article 38) The contracting states shall not * discriminate against refugees (Article 3) * take exceptional measures against a refugee solely on account of his or her nationality (Article 8) * expect refugees to pay taxes and fiscal charges that are different to those of nationals (Article 29) * impose penalties on refugees who entered illegally in search of asylum if they present themselves without delay (Article 31), which is commonly interpreted to mean that their unlawful entry and presence ought not to be prosecuted at all * expel refugees (Article 32) * forcibly return or \\"refoul\\" refugees to the country they have fled from (Article 33). It is widely accepted that the prohibition of forcible return is part of customary international law. This means that even states that are not party to the 1951 Refugee Convention must respect the principle of non-refoulement. Therefore, states are obligated under the Convention and under customary international law to respect the principle of non-refoulement. If and when this principle is threatened, UNHCR can respond by intervening with relevant authorities, and if it deems necessary, will inform the public. Refugees shall be treated at least like nationals in relation to * freedom to practice their religion (Article 4) * the respect and protection of artistic rights and industrial property (Article 14) * rationing (Article 20) * elementary education (Article 22) * public relief and assistance (Article 23) * labour legislation and social security (Article 24) Refugees shall be treated at least like other non-nationals in relation to * movable and immovable property (Article 13) * the right of association in unions or other associations (Article 15) * wage-earning employment (Article 17) * self-employment (Article 18) * practice of the liberal professions (Article 19) * housing (Article 21) * education higher than elementary (Article 22) * the right to free movement and free choice of residence within the country (Article 26) Noncompliance Although the Convention is \\"legally binding\\" there is no body that monitors compliance. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has supervisory responsibilities, but cannot enforce the Convention, and there is no formal mechanism for individuals to file complaints. The Convention specifies that complaints should be referred to the International Court of Justice.Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, Article 38. It appears that no nation has ever done this. An individual may lodge a complaint with the UN Human Rights Committee under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, or with the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, but no one has ever done so in regard to violations of the Convention. Nations may levy international sanctions against violators, but no nation has ever done this. At present, the only real consequences of violation are 1) public shaming in the press, and 2) verbal condemnation of the violator by the UN and by other nations. To date these have not proven to be significant deterrents.Rose Moloney, \\"Does Australia's refugee policy breach UN rules?\\" Crikey Clarifier, Nov 29, 2012.
