Silverfield has spent most of his coaching career, which began during his senior year of high school, as either a line coach or a member of the offensive staff. He was hired at Memphis by then-head coach Mike Norvell prior to the 2016 season. After Norvell's departure to Florida State on December 8, 2019, Silverfield served as the interim head coach before being promoted to head coach on December 13, 2019. Playing career Silverfield played for The Bolles School for four years, winning state championships in 1995 and 1998. He then joined the coaching staff as an assistant for the 1999 season, ending his playing career. Silverfield is therefore notable as one of the only coaches in the FBS ranks to have never played college football. Coaching career Silverfield landed his first college coaching job during his freshman year at Hampden–Sydney College; he opted to coach for his four years in college rather than play. He served as an offensive assistant for one year, then as the defensive line coach for his sophomore and junior years, and as the tight ends coach for his senior year. For the 2004 season, he served as the head coach at Memorial Day High School in Savannah, Georgia, whom he led to a 1–9 record. He then rejoined the college coaching ranks, as he served as the quarterbacks coach at Jacksonville University for one year and a graduate assistant at UCF for two, before joining the Minnesota Vikings staff, where he remained for six years in various positions. Following a one year stint at Toledo, he took a position as an offensive analyst at Arizona State, though he left part of the way through the season to join the Detroit Lions staff as an offensive line coach. After the conclusion of the 2015 season, he was hired at Memphis by Mike Norvell as an assistant. He remained in that position for two years before being tapped as the offensive line coach and run game coordinator in 2018. He was elevated to assistant head coach in 2019, and was named interim head coach when Norvell left to take the head coach position at Florida State. On December 13, Silverfield was promoted to head coach and debuted in his first college game as head coach on December 28 against Penn State in the 2019 Cotton Bowl Classic.

Description and history The fountain was created by José María Hernández Urbina, with Luz Jiménez, an indigenous Nahua woman, as the model, in 1927. The statue, 3 m in height and constructed from concrete, depicts a naked woman with a water pitcher under each arm, from which the water flowed. Locally she is referred to as La Muñeca or the Mujer de los Cántaros. The fountain faces onto Calle de Michoacán, which divides the park, at the entrance to the Teatro al Aire Libre Lindbergh (Lindbergh Forum, named for Charles Lindbergh). Urbina, together with the architect Roberto Montenegro was one of the creators of the Forum, with its Art Deco features, in the 1920s, at the time that Colonia Condesa was being developed. The statue has come to symbolize the Mexican people (Mexicayotl or Mexicanidad) before The Conquest. The Forum was poorly maintained, and fell into disrepair, but in 2008 a restoration began at a cost of 21 million pesos over 17 months, but was considered controversial by local residents. The fountain is considered an important landmark and attracts many visitors.  In popular culture  The statue has become symbolised in stencil graffiti on the walls of Mexico City, and has been replicated in fibreglass for a film and is a frequent subject for artists.

Lições de um Suicida: um estudo do clássico Memórias de um Suicída.Campinas (SP): Editora Allan Kardec, 2005. 272p.  Plot  The book was originally published by the Brazilian Spiritist Federation in 1954, twelve years after its writing, allegedly because it did not fit the usual spiritist novel profile. The plot is centered on the afterlife story of Camilo Cândido Botelho (a spiritual pseudonym of Camilo Castelo Branco), who committed suicide after going blind, on 1 June 1890. He was utterly surprised when his soul survived death. He feels the terrible pain from the shot to his right ear and his brain, waking up among the putrid smell of his own corpse. Hearing the voices of a crowd he compulsively joins to, all of them are forcefully brought to an inhospitable, dark and horrendous low astral place, the so-called «Valley of the Suicides», where like-minded spirits of suicides are localized. The scenery is hellish, full of an overall despair, never ending noise, horrible screaming and crying. The sky is darkly cloudy and thunderous, the atmosphere is cold and foul smelling, the ground is muddy and excremential. The valley is surrounded by lurid dark caves. Those unfortunate spirits are reliving over and over the tragic circumstances of their self-inflicted deaths. One is not restricted to one's own despair but is sharing others sufferings too. The lowest and darkest instincts come to the fore and spirits are never at peace with each other. One can never sleep or take a moment of rest or privacy. The most perverse and violent acts are commonplace. One can easily be a victim or become a tormentor. Even the most horrid conditions on Earth turn heaven-like compared to the sufferings in the «Valley of the Suicides». After more than ten years of incessant suffering, aggravated by the belief that it was an eternal and hellish punishment, Camilo, was totally exhausted, both physically and mentally. Finally he was rescued by the Servants of Mary, spiritual helpers who took him to the Mary of Nazareth astral hospital, in the twilight zone of a spiritual city. There the account unfolds with the revelation of the stories of his fellows of misfortune, the pains that caused their self-undoing, their plans for reparatory rebirth and, finally, the karmic cause of Camilo's blindness and his project of upliftment through reincarnation. The book is a cautionary tale about suicide. Death does not put an end to the suffering of a suicide. On the contrary, it aggravates it and prolongs it, years and sometimes centuries long in the low astral realms. Upon a new rebirth on Earth, most probably one has to endure again the same challenges one had tried to escape through suicide, further aggravated by more physical and existential handicaps than before. This work was released in 2013 as a radionovela, authorized by the Brazilian Spiritist Federation, on the initiative of José de Paiva-Netto, CEO of Legião da Boa Vontade.

Founded on August 2, 2001 as a Rio de Janeiro Football Club, between 2017 and 2018 the club competed under the name of Rio de Janeiro/Maricá through a partnership between Rio de Janeiro and Maricá. On July 16, 2018, it was made official merger and the change in the name of the Rio de Janeiro Football Club to Maricá Futebol Clube. The headquarters was also changed, moving from Magé to Maricá. History =Clube de Futebol Rio de Janeiro (2001-2017)= The Rio de Janeiro Football Club, initially conceived as the Grande Rio Sports Association, had been competing in the grassroots competitions for twelve years, but the name and registration were only formalized in 2002. The club is one of the greatest opportunities for young football talent in Piabetá. It has an eight-field training center in Piabetá, Magé. There are six official fields, one for games, two alternatives for training, plus two more projected. There is already a project for the construction of a future stadium on site itself. It was founded by professor Ênio Farias and has a vast number of players revealed for international football as midfielder Carlos Alberto, who played at club de Regatas Vasco da Gama. In 2009, they won the State champion of the Third Division of Rio de Janeiro, junior category, by winning in the final the Leme Futebol Clube Zona Sul 4-3. The professional team competes in the same championship, failing to get past the first phase, when it is eliminated by Clube Atlético Castelo Branco, Heliópolis Atlético Clube and Rubro Social Esporte Clube. =Present (2017–2018)= Maricá's club emerged from a merger with Rio de Janeiro. Since 2005, the city had no professional staff. Founded in 2017, the club was conceived by Douglas Almeida, football manager with a stint in Araruama. The club came about with the aim of bringing back professional football to the city of Maricá, which since 2005, when Taquaral competed in the Rio Cup, did not have professional teams. The team partnered with the Rio de Janeiro Football Club to compete in the Campeonato Carioca Serie B2 already in its founding year. The goal is to follow the path of other partnerships that worked in Rio football, such as the partnership between Campos Atlético Associação and Carapebus, a partnership between Arraial do Cabo and Araruama and the partnership between Santa Cruz and Belford Roxo. After announcing Polaco Valoura as coach for the State's B2 Series race, Maricá confirmed the name of 24 players who will be part of the squad this season. Among the pieces that will be available to Valoura are midfielder Lucas Candido and left back Maylson, who defended Araruama in the Third quarter last year. The definition of the squad came shortly after the evaluations that the newly created club carried out in the city of Maricá. According to the football manager, Douglas Almeida, the athletes who had the names revealed will form the backbone of the team, which still seeks punctual signings to close the group. The team's first official game took place on May 28, 2017, against Angra dos Reis, a game that ended tied at 2-2.

Gameplay  Many of Dustnets features are in direct reference to Counter-Strike, such as an unlockable \\"Bunny hopping\\" feature, selection between one \\"Counter-Terrorist\\" and one \\"Terrorist\\" team upon joining a server, and the presence of a bomb to be defused. A deathmatch mechanic is present, with available weapons being references to the Counter-Strike and Quake video game series. However, many of these features are inserted merely as references to the game's theme. For example, the bomb to be defused, which is a central point of importance in the Counter-Strike series, is of no particular importance in Dustnet. Instead, players may edit and build upon the original \\"Dust II\\" layout, copying parts of it or laying down new map pieces such as teleporters, jump pads, and ammo pickups. Players with access to virtual reality headsets will appear to normal PC players as giant floating pairs of hands, which may smite or haul other players around the game world, as well as edit and build upon the level on a greater scale. As a tie-in to the game's themes, a server's player-made creations are permanent for as long as there are players connected to it, but will be erased if the server becomes empty. Besides this, a server may go into a state named \\"low-energy mode\\", where the game's visuals and audio become more dull and muted. This can be prevented by executing game-related actions such as joining a server, searching through a defeated player's inventory, or planting the bomb. The game features a free augmented reality companion app, available for Android and iOS. It allows players to observe and interact with one of the game's servers in real time.  Development  Dustnet was created and published by SCRNPRNT, a Canadian developer created by brothers Milan and Neilson Koerner-Safrata. The game was released on Steam and itch.io on July 16, 2019. According to Neilson, he wanted to imagine the \\"death of a well known and loved space\\", here represented by the \\"Dust II\\" map for it being the most \\"resilient virtual space\\" in the world. Despite this, the game was not developed with the intention of reproducing the gameplay of Counter-Strike in mind, but focused itself on capturing the feeling of exploring game servers made in the Source engine.  Reception  Writing for Rock Paper Shotgun, Alice O'Connor called Dustnet a \\"strange and wonderful dream\\", and a \\"fascinating way to remember a map, a game and a culture\\". Kotaku praised the game as a fascinating environment, though commenting on the lack of goals and definite structures, and PC Gamer praised the game for its discussion of \\"ideas that feel essential\\".
