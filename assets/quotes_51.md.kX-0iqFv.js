The explosion killed a man. * An independent contractor installing fiber-optic cable for a cable company in Kansas City, Missouri inadvertently struck an underground gas line on February 19. Gas later caught fire, and created an explosion that destroyed a popular local restaurant, killing one of the workers there, and injuring about 15 others near the scene. * A tug towing a barge struck and ruptured a Chevron LPG pipeline at Bayou Perot, a marshy area on the borders of Jefferson Parish and Lafourche Parish, Louisiana on March 12. The tug Captain was severely burned when the escaping gas ignited, and died several weeks later from those injuries. * On March 8, pipeline equipment failure resulted in a spill of 6,000 barrels of crude oil, in eastern Columbia County, Arkansas. * On March 18, a Chevron 8-inch petroleum products pipeline ruptured along a seam, spilling diesel fuel into Willard Bay State Park near Ogden, Utah.

There were no injuries. * The 2013 Mayflower oil spill occurred when ExxonMobil's 20-inch Pegasus crude oil pipeline spilled near Mayflower, Arkansas on March 29, causing crude to flow through yards and gutters, and towards Lake Conway. Wildlife was coated in some places. Twenty-two houses were evacuated, due to the fumes and fire hazard. Estimates say the total amount of 190,000 gallons of diluted bitumen were spilled. Hook cracks and extremely low impact toughness in the LF-ERW seam of the pipe were identified as causes of the failure. * On April 4, an explosion and fire occurred at a gas compressor station near Guthrie, Oklahoma. Nearby houses were evacuated. There were no injuries reported. * A flash fire at a pipeline gas compressor station broke out when natural gas liquids ignited in Tyler County, West Virginia on April 11, seriously burning three workers, two of whom later died.

The Pegasus pipeline was out of service from the Mayflower, Arkansas spill, accounting for the minimal amount of oil spilled in Missouri. * On May 9, diesel fuel was detected to be leaking from a Marathon pipeline in Indianapolis, Indiana. Over 20,000 gallons of diesel leaked, at a slow rate that was not detected by SCADA systems. Cleanup caused a nearby major road to be shut down for five days. There were no injuries reported. * Late night on May 14, an explosion and fire hit a Williams Companies gas compressor station near Brooklyn Township, Pennsylvania. There were no reported injuries. * On May 8, the Kinder Morgan Tejas pipeline compressor station near Crockett, Texas, required an emergency shutdown and subsequently had a fire that caused $7,502,188 in property damage. * On May 18, a 24-inch fill line failed, on an Enbridge tank, in Cushing, Oklahoma, spilling about 105,000 gallons of crude oil. The cause was internal corrosion of the line. * On May 30, two construction workers were injured, when a fire erupted during welding at a Williams Companies natural gas facility in Hunterdon County, New Jersey. * A 12-inch gas transmission pipeline failed near Torrington, Wyoming on June 13. LF-ERW seam failure was suspected as cause.

No one was seriously hurt but 55 homes were evacuated. The blast knocked down trees in an area about 200 yards across and the fire burned those within another 300 yards. \\"The ground around the crater is completely bare. The dirt around it is just like it had been cooked in a kiln,\\" and an 80-foot section of pipe was destroyed. * On July 4, a fire involved a gas compressor and a nearby ruptured 2-inch gas pipeline in Gilmore Township, Pennsylvania. There were no injuries. * An 8-inch natural gas pipeline released gas from a rupture at 1,400 psi, for 90 minutes in New Franklin, Ohio on July 22, forcing 75 people to evacuate the area. Afterward, the local Fire Chief said that pipeline owners refused to give information to first responders in previous requests. * Early on July 23, a downed 13,000 volt power line sparked a massive gas fire in Mamaroneck, New York when a gas main was damaged by the electricity. Three automobiles were destroyed, and houses were threatened for a time. * On July 26, a leaking BP 20-inch crude oil pipeline spilled 50 to 100 barrels of crude oil in Washington County, Oklahoma. Some of the crude spilled into a drainage ditch leading to a water reservoir. * On the evening of August 12, a 10-inch NGL pipeline exploded and caused a massive propane-ethane mix fire in Erie, Illinois. A number of nearby residents were evacuated for a while, but there were no injuries. About 772,000 gallons of mix were burned or lost. The cause was from a manufacturing defect. * A leak developed on a valve on Longhorn Pipeline in Austin, Texas during maintenance on August 14, spilling about 300 gallons of crude oil. There were no evacuations. * Atmos Energy crews dug into a 4-inch gas pipeline in Overland Park, Kansas on September 2, causing an explosion and fire.

About a dozen people from nearby houses were evacuated for a time. There were no injuries. * On September 24, a Denton TX city water utility worker ruptured a 1/2-inch gas pipeline in Denton, Texas, which immediately caused a fire that gave the worker minor burns. There was no other significant damage. * A farmer near Tioga, North Dakota smelled oil for several days, before discovering a leaking 6-inch 20-year-old Tesoro pipeline under his wheat field, on September 29. Crews tried to burn off the oil at first. The spill size was estimated at 865,000 gallons, and covered over seven acres. There were no injuries. Corrosion was suspected as being the cause. Governor Jack Dalrymple said he wasn't told of the spill until October 9. In May 2014, it was announced that it would 2 1/2 more years before the spilled crude would be cleaned up. * On October 7, a gas pipeline burst in Howard County, Texas. There was no fire, but dangerous hydrogen sulfide in the gas forced evacuations of nearby residents. There were no injuries. * On October 7, authorities were notified of a Lion Oil Trading and Transportation crude oil pipeline leak in Columbia County, Arkansas. It was estimated that the leak started on September 21. Oil spread into a Horsehead Creek tributary. The Environmental Protection Agency said that approximately 1,500 barrels of oil were lost, but one lawsuit against the oil company claimed the full amount was as much as 5,000 barrels. * A 30-inch Northern Natural Gas pipeline exploded and burned in Harper County, Oklahoma on October 8. 220 feet of the pipe was ejected from the ground. Flames were seen for a number of miles, and four houses nearby were evacuated. Oklahoma Highway 283 was closed for several hours until the fire was determined to be under control and safe. There were no injuries. * On October 29, a Koch Industries 8-inch pipeline spilled about 400 barrels of crude oil near Smithville, Texas. The oil polluted a private stock pond and two overflow reservoirs. * A Chevron operated 10-inch LPG pipeline was ruptured by contractors for the company installing a Cathodic protection system, near Milford, Texas, on November 14, causing a large fire, and forcing the evacuation of Milford and 200 students of a nearby school. A nearby 14-inch pipeline was threatened by the failure, but did not fail. There were no injuries reported.

The plant burned for over a day, but there were no reported injuries. * On November 18, a gas pipeline burst near Ranger, Texas, causing a fire in a field, with flames reaching 100 feet high. Some houses nearby were evacuated for a time. The owner of the pipeline, Hanlon Gas, had been installing a new compressor station, and they believe a malfunction led to the rupture and fire. There were no injuries reported. * On November 28 a 30-inch Panhandle Eastern natural gas pipeline exploded in Hughesville, Missouri causing several nearby buildings to catch fire. There was a local evacuation but no injuries. Metallurgical examination determined the root cause of the failure to be corrosion. * On December 9, a 2-inch pipe on a propane dehydrator failed at the Dixie Pipeline Terminal in Apex, North Carolina, forcing evacuations and sheltering in place at nearby businesses. There was no fire or explosion. * A Sunoco pipeline was found leaking gasoline on December 20, near Coal Township, Pennsylvania, from external corrosion. About 266 to 471 gallons of product were spilled, and, 1,421 tons of soil were removed, as part of the remediation of that leak. * On December 27, two natural gas company workers had minor burns when the pipeline they were working leaked, and the escaping gas exploded and ignited in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts.

The Act modified the previous two Metropolitan Police Acts of 1829 and 1839, merging the two roles of First Commissioner and Second Commissioner into the single role of Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis and setting up a system of two Assistant Commissioners under him. The roles of First and Second Joint Commissioner had been filled by Richard Mayne and William Hay until the latter's death in 1855. The Act provided for one of the First and Second Commissioners to become the sole Commissioner as soon as the other one died - effectively it meant that no new Second Joint Commissioner was appointed and Mayne became sole Commissioner. The Act also set the maximum for the Commissioner's annual salary at ¬£1500 and that for each Assistant Commissioner at ¬£800. The Act also established the Assistant Commissioners as ex officio Justices of the Peace for all counties then partly or wholly covered by the Metropolitan Police District (i.e. Middlesex, Surrey, Hertfordshire, Essex, Kent, Berkshire and Buckinghamshire). He was not to act as a JP, however, \\"at any Court of General or Quarter Sessions, or in any Matter out of Sessions, except for the Preservation of the Peace, the Prevention of Crimes, the Detention and Committal of Offenders, and in carrying into execution the Purposes of this Act and the said recited Acts\\" and like usual JPs could not be elected as a Member of Parliament or vote in some General Elections. In the case of the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis being ill or the post being left vacant, either Assistant Commissioner could be authorised by one of the Principal Secretaries of State to act as acting Commissioner.

The original designer is unconfirmed, with 1950-60s additions completed by Marcel Weyland. The homestead was built from 1817 to 1827. The property is privately owned and was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 22 December 2006.  History  =The Cowpastures frontier= The Europeans first saw the Camden area in August 1790. Captain Watkin Tench, Lieutenant William Dawes and surgeon George Worgan (late surgeon of the Sirius) undertook an expedition where the country had not previously been explored by the settlers. The second expedition into the Camden area by Europeans was in 1795. For a short period the settlement was short on livestock because the cattle that arrived on the First Fleet had escaped within five months of its arrival. A large importation from India in May 1795 had ended the shortage. Nonetheless a party was organized by Governor Hunter to investigate the stories of the Aboriginal people that the first herd (which had grown substantially in size) was grazing to the south-west of the Sydney town centre. Sixty-one cattle were found grazing in open country beyond the Nepean River. Hunter named the area the Cowpastures; the name used in England for the common grazing of land near a village. The country impressed the Europeans but it was too far away from the seat of government to be useful. Governor Hunter left the cattle to multiply undisturbed. In 1800 when the herd numbered about five or six hundred, his successor Governor King tried unsuccessfully to have the cattle mustered. When that plan failed he had a slab hut built at the river crossing place, which acted as a guard house and a base for butchering. Governor King tried to stop settlers from going there. During King's time the Cowpastures was becoming a fine spot for visiting naval officers and those interested in romantic landscapes. To prevent depredations on the wild herd, on 6 July 1803 Governor King issued a proclamation forbidding people to cross to the western bank of the Nepean River without a permit signed by the Governor (cattle were thought to have been killed by escaped convicts as a source of sustenance). In a later ruling on 1 March 1804 he continued the ban, stating that \\"no ground whatever ought to be granted or leased to individuals on the other side of the Nepean\\". It appears that a number of settlers occupied land on the Nepean from 1800, although no grants were issued there until 1805, and early accounts of this occupation suggest that most was on the north-eastern bank. Alan Atkinson (?) reports the river flats drew admiration from the Europeans who travelled through in 1795. They described \\"large ponds covered with ducks and the black swan, the margins of which were fringed with shrubs of the most delightful tints\\". Governor Bligh, a naval man, particularly admired the second type of country in the district rising gradually from the river as \\"Hills and Dales, waving like the Sea, their Bases nearly uniting and rising as they advance towards the high Mountains\\" [of the Razorback range]. The Europeans thought the flats were perfect for cattle and the hills would carry sheep. They admired the absence of underbrush ‚Äì probably achieved through Aboriginal land management practices (burning off) ‚Äì and felt comfortable with a landscape that reminded them of an English gentleman's park. In spite of Governor Bligh's ruling that no further grants should be made at Cowpastures, small settlers made their homes on the Sydney side of the Nepean from about 1810. This move was part of a large push to extend the settlement southwards after floods and over-cultivation had blighted the Hawkesbury farming area. The New South Wales Corps deposed Governor Bligh on 26 January 1808 and during the interregnum, which lasted until Lachlan Macquarie replaced Bligh as Governor in January 1810, members of the Corps served as lieutenant governors. Joseph Foveaux in particular thought Bligh's restriction of land grants was detrimental to the colony's progress and he granted land to all who requested it, spreading the small farmers broadly across the Cumberland landscape. Even so, as John Booth's map of 1810 indicates, the \\"Cowpastures plains\\" was remote, at the edge of the known landscape. Restoring order after the rebellion, Governor Macquarie recalled a number of the grants given out by Foveaux and Paterson during the interregnum but he agreed that the \\"right\\" or northern bank of the Nepean should be settled. He had James Meehan survey the area and made additional grants on the Sydney side of the river. Some of these were modest, ranging from , but others were extensive. From 1812, Macquarie began to allot land north of Camden to potential large scale landowners, men of substance in the colony. Food shortages and the imminence of population growth as the Anglo-American War of Independence drew to a close prompted this move to favourable ground in the south-west of the Sydney Plain. The first grants in the area were made in 1815: Kirkham to John Oxley (Surveyor-General) who was also granted the Elderslie farm; Harrington to William Campbell (sea captain and Pacific trader); and Orielton to Simeon Lord (ex-naval officer and entrepreneur). In 1816 there was Netherbyres to Molle (regimental colonel) and Nonnorah (later Maryland) to Dickson (steam miller). About the same time, grants of a similar kind were made: Macquarie's Gift to Cowper (clergyman); Denbigh to Hook (merchant); Curtis to Blaxcell (merchant); and Raby to Riley (merchant). Macquarie later regretted his generosity because of the great numbers of cattle stolen from the government herds after the settlers had moved into the area. At first, these, and similar properties in the neighbourhood were used for sheep and cattle; the few assigned resident convict stockmen lived in primitive huts. By the 1820s some owners looking for \\"rural retreats\\" and needing to cultivate the land, established residences and began to build permanent homes with associated farm buildings. These included Oxley and Campbell. The practice began of such landowners running sheep beyond the mountains (on Crown land), using their Cowpasture estates for breeding and agistment and, increasingly, developing agriculture, which began to include milling, threshing, and viticulture as allied activities. =Founder of Harrington Park, William Douglas Campbell= Captain William Douglas Campbell was a member of the British merchant navy who worked initially in the India trade. He was the most knowledgeable navigator of the Pacific region. He first visited the colony of New South Wales in 1797 on the brig Deptford that brought merchandise from Madras. Two years later he returned as captain of the Rebecca and came to Sydney again in 1801 as master of the brig Harrington. On the way back to Madras in 1803 he visited Chile and Peru for trade purposes and was so successful that he purchased a half-share in the Harrington and returned there the following year. On this occasion, he raided the coast on the \\"somewhat flimsy excuse\\" that he believed England and Spain to be at war. When he next visited Sydney, Governor King detained the Harrington while he investigated whether Campbell's actions amounted to piracy. Though Navy officials in England judged Campbell's action to be highly questionable, they returned his ship but confiscated his prizes, which they sold for A¬£5,054. Campbell next entered the sandalwood trade with John Macarthur. His profits from delivering Fijian sandalwood to China and returning with oriental merchandise enabled him to buy the remaining share in the Harrington. Having been a close associate of Macarthur before the NSW Corps deposed Governor Bligh in 1808, Campbell later fell out with Macarthur and supported Governor Macquarie. In 1809 escaping convicts seized the Harrington and she was destroyed by her pursuers near Manila. Campbell continued to trade sandalwood from Fiji until late that year when that resource was exhausted. He subsequently concentrated on the trade in salt pork from Tahiti that he had initiated in 1805. During one of his voyages he recaptured the Venus from Tahitian rebels and rescued the English missionaries escaping the civil war. Campbell returned to London where he succeeded in gaining compensation for the Harrington. The grant of near Camden issued by Governor Macquarie on 10 June 1815 was his payment for that loss. Campbell continued trading, though in a less flamboyant manner, until 1817 when he settled on his property naming it Harrington Park after his ship. During the next ten years he stayed mainly at his farm where he died on 3 March 1827. Building the homestead Some sources state that the first house that William Douglas Campbell built at Harrington Park ‚Äì now the kitchen ‚Äì was a modest single-room dwelling of local bricks with a stone floor and a fireplace at one end and sleeping cabins at the other. Another room provided washing facilities with water from the well nearby. These arrangements were similar to those of other gentlemen farmers when establishing their country properties. Other local farms that began with similar dwellings were Elizabeth Farm at Parramatta, Brownlow Hill at Cobbitty and Nonorrah (later Maryland) at Bringelly. James Broadbent in his book \\"The Australian Colonial House\\" (p151), states that Campbell \\"built a simple two- storeyed single-pile brick house which he enlarged some time before his death\\". Broadbent believes that, not only did W. D. Campbell build the two- storey house at Harrington Park, but he also made significant changes to it before his death. Later generations of Campbells W. D. Campbell never saw the homestead fully completed, dying in 1827 aged 57. He left the estate to his nephews Murdoch and John Campbell.Peters, 2009, 12 In 1828 the Census recorded (his nephew) Mr Murdoch Campbell and Mrs A. Campbell living at Harrington Park with convict servants Sarah Maker, housemaid and William Bailey, cook. The farm had of cleared land with in cultivation and 150 cattle and nine horses. The convict labourers working the farm were Patrick Murphy, Samuel Lester, Lawrence Lyons, Abraham Malabar and Joseph Parker. In 1830 William Riley described the Campbell's' altered residence as \\"an elegant mansion on an eminence and about cleared and in cultivation\\". The first subdivision of Harrington Park occurred on 29 August 1829 when Murdoch Campbell sold of enclosed land from the northern part of the estate to his cousin John Douglas Campbell for ¬£600. This farm was named Aberfoil. Two years later, he leased, and later sold, a smaller farming allotment of north of the Cobbitty Road to George Graham, a farmer from Liverpool. Murdoch Campbell was murdered at Harrington Park by an escaped convict or bushranger in 1833. After his death, his share in the Harrington Park estate passed to his eldest brother, William Douglas Campbell the younger, a resident of Scotland, and the property reportedly declined from that time. The incumbent released very small allotments in the form of 99-year leases ‚Äì two just over to James Greenfield and John Graham, and two of about to Andrew Keaton and another unnamed recipient. In 1838 William Douglas Campbell the younger died without a will and his share of the estate passed to his eldest son, Alexander, an Edinburgh merchant, who issued a power of attorney for the property to his brother William Douglas Campbell III of Arbroath, Scotland, on the understanding that he was about to embark for New South Wales. However, later title details show that W. D. Campbell III was a writer who never left Scotland. John Douglas Campbell who had purchased the farm named Aberfoil in 1829 sold it to Henry William Johnson in 1842 for ¬£1,600. He made the sale in the worst year of the 1840s depression, so it seems likely that he had financial problems. His action permanently removed this farm from the Harrington Park estate. It later became Oran Park. Outraged, Alexander Campbell, still residing in Scotland, opened legal proceedings against John Campbell in the New South Wales Supreme Court, claiming that he had no right to sell off parts of the Harrington Park estate. The Court ruled that the remnant parts of the estate be divided between Alexander and John Campbell. The remaining portion (with the homestead on it) was sold at auction to the highest bidder, Sydney leather dealer James Rofe for ¬£1,775, together with the under lease. The enforced sale ended the Campbell's interest in Harrington Park. It appears that Rofe's interest was purely speculative for he sold the diminished Harrington Park to Abraham Davy in 1853. =Abraham Davy (Davey), ownership 1853‚Äì1874= When Abraham Davy purchased Harrington Park in 1853, the property still had a significant amount of open forest and bushland. Improvements included a reasonable amount of cleared land, a dam, a racecourse, and numerous grass paddocks. Close to the house was a chain of ponds that supplied the dam and this was the site where smaller fields supported oats, barley and wheat. The main approach to the house passed a large pond or lake and there was a store and stockyard nearby. A gardener tended a garden on the Cowpasture Road (now Camden Valley Way) side of the house. Abraham Davy has been credited with restoring and improving Harrington Park to the point where it became \\"one of the most picturesque in the district of Camden\\". Davy also added land to the estate in 1863 when he bought 60 acres of the adjoining Orielton farm when it was subdivided by James Ryan esquire of Emu Plains and Sydney wine and spirit merchant James Jones. As well as renovating the property, Davy restored some of the pursuits that gentleman expected to enjoy on their country estates. As Carol Liston reports in her history of Campbelltown, Davy introduced live hare coursing to Harrington Park. It is not possible, however, to trace details of the other changes that Davy made. Records of William Macarthur's Camden Park Nursery sales indicate that Davy, who was proposed as a member of the Australian Horticultural and Agricultural Society in September 1857, undertook an extensive planting program with many of his purchases consisting of conifers. A photograph s shows a grassed carriage loop with shrubs or small trees in a garden bed abutting the verandah. Trees are in the background to the side of and behind the house.Britton & Morris, 2000, 33 =The Rudd family, ownership 1874‚Äì1934= The Rudd family's ownership of Harrington Park began when William Rudd Senior purchased the property on 6 March 1874. It still retained the triangular shape created after the sale of the northern section to John Campbell in 1829, comprising the 889 acres of the original Harrington Park together with the southern addition of the in Lot 1 of the Orielton Park subdivision. William Rudd Senior was a grazier who owned Houlong Station on the Lower Murrumbidgee. It appears that this family originated from Campbelltown as Carol Liston includes William Rudd's sons, Isaac and James in her list of Campbelltown families who held squatting licences between 1847 and 1850. According to Liston, a significant proportion of the Campbelltown farmers were ex-convicts who owned small holdings. Whether this was true of the Rudds or not, during the squatting era, it was common for established farmers and graziers to send their sons out into the hinterland to build grazing properties. It was also customary for graziers to move closer to town in their more mature years leaving their sons to continue to work their country estates. In such cases there could be a continuing connection between the grazing runs and the home in town or, in this case, close to the city. William Rudd died in 1885 leaving Harrington Park to his wife Emma for the remainder of her life, and then to his married daughter, Elizabeth Britten who was to hold the property in trust until her children Walter and Emma Mary Harrington Britten reached the age of 21. At the time of William's death, Harrington Park comprised . Unusual for the district, its main livestock were 350 sheep and it also carried 40 cattle and 5 pigs. There was no dairy herd although dairying was emerging as the main farming activity in the Camden- Campbelltown area at this time. Major renovations were made to the house in the 1890s and a new drive was created which passed an ornamental pond and entered through a picket-fenced gateway to the garden on the east of the house. A photograph taken during this period indicates the tall shrubs in the garden bed next to the verandah had been removed but the still current Cupressus sp. to the rear of the house are mature. Pedestals were constructed at the foot of the verandah steps.Britton & Morris, 2000, 33‚Äì4 Changes that the Rudds made to the house in the late nineteenth century include replacement, or covering of the shingle roof with corrugated iron and replacement of the original timber-trimmed veranda with one of Victorian design. The new veranda featured an ogee corrugated iron roof and trim of cast iron filigree that were fashionable at the time. Rudd's daughter Elizabeth Britten died young in 1886, but his widow survived until 1902. The estate passed to William Rudd's grandchildren Walter William and Emma Mary Harrington Britten. In 1905 Emma married Harold Herbert Dunlop, an insurance risk assessor of Narellan. Her brother Walter continued to farm on the property, raising a mortgage of ¬£1,100 that year, possibly to buy out his sister. Not much is known about Walter Britten's farming activity but he leased some of the land to dairy farmer in the interwar period and the remainder to a Sydney agent, Lee Chapman Solomon in 1931. It appears that this period was not kind to William Rudd's grandchildren as they sold the property in 1934 not long after the worst years of the Great Depression. Few of the large properties in the district survived intact. The farming ventures still concentrated on dairying to supply the city, or stud farms for horses or cattle. There was a considerable amount of subdivision with real estate agents offering farmlets for orchards or poultry. Some of these were established for soldiers returning from World War I. Gentleman farmers were rare in this environment. =Arthur and Elaine Swan, ownership 1934‚Äì1944= Harrington Park first became a country retreat when Sydneysiders Arthur Donovan Swan and his wife Elaine Gordon Hall Swan purchased the property in 1934 as the depression began to lift for people of means. Once ensconced, Swan described himself a grazier and financier of Narellan. The Swans were also the proprietors of Lot 8 of Orielton Estate, lots 43, 44, 50, 51, 52 and part of lot 45 of Perry's subdivision of Orielton Estate and adjoining land (all part portion 43) of . All of this was transferred to John Fairfax & Sons in 1947.Britton & Morris, 2000, 34 =The Fairfax family 1944‚Äì2005= The famed Fairfax publishing dynasty bought Harrington Park in 1944 in the name of John Fairfax & Sons Ltd., a public holding company formed to fund its expansion into other media. At the time the company acquired the property, during World War II, part of a military camp occupied a piece of land in the north-west corner. Known locally as Greene's Corner, \\"Narellan Camp\\" was an extensive military facility established as a place for army units to form up before they were posted. Situated approximately 1.5 miles from Narellan, it clustered around four points of the intersection of Cobbitty and Northern Roads. The Harrington Park corner accommodated the guard room and camp hospital whilst the Orielton corner, held the engineers' depot, canteen and armoured vehicles that were concealed in the bush. On the Denbigh corner were 150 to 200 tents, most accommodating six men each, while the corner that is now part of Oran Park Raceway held the camp administration and the horse lines. The Army used other neighbouring historic properties such as Studley Park and Brownlow Hill and the Camden district also accommodated RAAF training squadrons at the local Aerodrome. At by the Hume Highway (formerly the Great South Road), the Narellan campsite was ideal, because the district was sufficiently distant from Sydney for security purposes but close enough for regular contact. The Army removed the whole facility when the war ended leaving only areas of bitumen and concrete. An aerial photograph from the time of transfer to the Fairfax family indicates the garden as having a defined southern edge with the garden extending east over part of the area (?) shown as 'garden (i.e.kitchen/vegetable garden) and gardener's house on the 1852 map. Many of the plantings are mature but the traditional viewline to the Razorback Range may have been appreciable. The location of the race course is no longer apparent but the cleared alluvial flats are still cleared. Between Cowpasture Road (Camden Valley Way) and the cleared flats in 1852 there was an area marked \\"bush land\\". This is now cleared with scattered trees and the current entrance road deviates from its original marked course in this location. Tropman and Tropman have analysed the 1952 map of the property stating that the \\"fields around the house remain, although in attenuated form\\". Sir Warwick Oswald Fairfax Kt., cr. 1967 (b.1901‚Äì d.1987) became sole owner of Harrington Park in 1956. Warwick Fairfax joined the staff of The Sydney Morning Herald in 1925, and was appointed director in 1927. Following the death of his father, Sir James Oswald Fairfax in 1928, Warwick was appointed Managing Director and Chairman of Directors in 1930. Following the incorporation of John Fairfax Ltd. in 1956 he was appointed Chairman, a position he retained until 1977. He was knighted in 1967. Following the death of his mother Lady Fairfax in 1965, Warwick inherited the historic harbour side mansion Fairwater at 560 New South Head Road, Double Bay. Owned by his family from 1900 until 2018, Fairwater became the family's permanent Sydney seat and Harrington Park its country retreat. Warwick Fairfax married three times: M. (1) 1928, Marcie E. Wilson (James 1 d.); (2) 1948, Hanne A. Bendixsen (1 d.); (3) 1959, Mary Wein (Warwick 1 d. 1 s.).Who's Who in Australia, 1974. Warwick Fairfax began major renovations to Harrington Park in 1957. North Sydney Architects Fowell Mansfield & Maclurcon planned the changes, and the building work was supervised by T. W. Jackson Pty Ltd. During this period a garden study was also built in a secluded part of the garden. This building was designed by Wilshire, Hodges and (Marcel) Weyland and furnished by Emery T. Reeves. Other estate buildings renovated at the same time were a cottage on Bringelly Road and the manager's residence on Northern Road. The renovations included construction of new cottages for the manager, housekeeper and gardener and a glasshouse was added to the garden. Local contractors regraded the entrance road and constructed a bridge over the creek. Other additions were a new dam, pig yards and a children's cubby house. Changes to the Fairfax Board in the early 1960s allowed Warwick Fairfax more time for private and intellectual pursuits. In his new study at Harrington Park he wrote The Triple Abyss: Towards A Modern Synthesis. Published in London in 1965, this book explored major world religions and synthesised them into a liberal view that explained his own philosophy. After his third marriage (1959), Fairfax spent more time at Harrington Park with his family and devoted more time to his writing. At the same time he was also engaged with company affairs and orchestrated coverage of the electoral campaigns, continued to take a keen interest in electoral campaigns and other issues editorialised in the Herald. In 1966 Warwick Fairfax expanded the property with the purchase of the Funnell's property that straddled Campbell's Portion 60 and Molle's Portion 59. In 1967 two pavilion style rooms (master bedroom and retreat) were added to the northern side of the house. Changes to the estate since 1980 In 1981, Camden Council approved in principle the residential subdivision and development of the Harrington Park estate. By the mid-1980s the house knoll was largely treed on the southern slopes so that views from the house are oriented to the hills to the north and the arrangement of paddocks and fields is more open. Tropman & Tropman wrote '...by the late 1970s/early 1980s, the city man's country house was becoming increasingly divorced from its rural setting and oriented towards a more desired landscape of forests, groves and hilly dales'. The reorientation of the relationship of the house in its garden setting with the broader landscape is likely to be directly related to plans for a suburban subdivision to the south of the house. In 1982 a Commission of Inquiry into the future of Harrington Park recommended that the in the southeast corner be rezoned from rural to urban, which was approved by then Planning Minister Craig Knowles in 1986. An area of 40 ha around the house was to be retained by the Fairfax family. In the late 1980s, planning commenced and the first of the Harrington Park villages (Lakeside) began construction in 1994. Currently the name \\"Harrington Park Estate\\" is used for the suburban area developed to the south of Narellan Creek, Stage 1 of a development which extends to the north of Narellan Creek. A 1997 proposal for an altered curtilage to the house was rejected by Camden Council. The direct relationship between the homstead group and its traditional landscape features, such as Narellan Creek and Crear Hill, has been recently compromised by intervening suburban development. During the 1990s, the residential development continued. Construction of the third Harrington Park Village (Park Haven) was underway in 2005. By 2011, Harrington Grove (north-east of the homestead) was nearing completion.Stuart Read, pers.comm., visit 7/11/2011  Description  =Estate= The 1815 grant was for . The 1828 census noted that of this was cleared and cultivated. Broadly that comprised rich alluvial flats where paddocks of crops and cultivated land were, and broader grazing paddocks, with scattered remnant eucalypt schlerophyll woodland across the ridge of hills to the homestead's north. Harrington Park homestead complex is the core of a once much larger historic farm estate, covering what today is the new suburb of Harrington Park, Harrington Grove etc. The centre of the historic estate including the area around the homestead, outbuildings, garden, yards, former nursery site(s) etc. remains although the remainder has been subdivided, rezoned and is being redeveloped in stages as a residential suburb, primary school and open space areas.

At the estate auction in 1852 a race course had been established between the house and Narellan Creek to the south-west. Other views from the homestead or its surrounding gardens to neighbouring estates Orielton, Studley Park, Camden town (St.John's church spire), Camelot / Kirkham etc. are available. The ridgeline to the north cuts off views to Oran Park, Denbigh and Maryland although these are not far away. Entrances to the property were from both Cowpasture Road (now Camden Valley Way) in roughly the same location as the current entry drive (since altered by residential development), passing across the race course and arriving at the carriage loop in front of the house via the south-west near the stockyards. At that time the estate comprised 800 acres of cleared land, pasture and forest with crop paddocks and a vegetable garden near the house. A second driveway approaches the homestead complex from within the new suburb of Harrington Park, off Parkway Drive / Cobbitty Road/ Oran Park Drive to its north via the new suburb and off the Northern Road to the west. A series of farm dams to the house's south-east have been modified or lost with residential development although the small pond alongside the 1890s realigned driveway remains within open space. =Garden= Today the garden retains many mature coniferous and other trees most likely planted after 1853 under the Davy ownership, including Araucaria bidwillii (Bunya Bunya pine ‚Äì several giant specimens) and A.cunninghamii (hoop pines ‚Äì several), Cupressus sempervirens (Mediterranean cypress ‚Äì several) and a Chinese funeral cypress (C.funebris). In the 1890s major house renovations occurred and a new drive was created that passed an ornamental pond and enetered through a picket-fenced gateway to the garden on the east of the house. A number of tall shrubs in the garden bed next to the verandah were removed at this time. Pedestals were added at the foot of the verandah steps. An aerial photograph from (transfer to the Fairfax family) shows the garden as having a defined southern edge with the garden extending east over part of the area shown as garden (kitchen/vegetable garden) and gardener's house on the 1842 map. The racecourse was no longer clear but the cleared alluvial flats were still cleared.Peters, 2009, 12; Morris & Britton, 2000, abridged and added to by Stuart Read, 11/11/09 The large circular / elliptical carriage loop south of the homestead is lined with mature trees, predominantly large conifers- these distinguish the homestead group and due to their height and colour, mark its site and can be seen from quite some distance away. These include Bunya Bunya and hoop pines, Canary Island pines (Pinus canariensis). Non-coniferous species include the native kurrajongs (Brachychiton populneus), Norfolk Island hibiscus / white oak / cow itch tree (Lagunaria patersonia ‚Äì several), European olive (Olea europaea cv. ‚Äì several ‚Äì at least some are 19th century) and silky oak (Grevillea robusta), dating from the mid-late 19th century. Some shrubs may date from the 19th century also, such as pomegranate (Punica granatum cv.).Stuart Read, visit., 2/5/2013 Later plantings of trees and shrubs date from the early and mid-twentieth century and include plantings made by the Fairfax family. These include more deciduous species such as Chinese elm (Ulmus parvifolia), Chinese pistachio (Pistacia sinensis), swamp cypress (Taxodium distichum), Illawarra flame tree (Brachychiton acerifolius), evergreen species such as African and fruiting olive trees (Olea europaea var. cuspidata and O.e. var. europaea), hedging species such as Italian buckthorn (Rhamnus alaternus), sky flower (Duranta plumieri), large leaved privet (Ligustrum ovalifolium), Cotoneaster species, yellow jasmine (Jasminium humile), oleanders (Nerium oleander cv.s) etc. Climbing cactus the \\"dragon fruit\\" (Hylocereus undatus) from Honduras and Central America climbs over a garden wall near the western entry gate. Clumping orchid cactus (x Disocactus ackermannii cv. (scarlet) is underplanted under some of the Mediterranean cypresses to the house's north.Stuart Read, visit 2/5/2013 The driveway is of crushed laterite. It has been patched and repaired over the decades with a variety of gravels. A tennis court in bitumen dating from the c.1960s is to the north-east of the homestead and to the east was an area of glasshouses and a former gardener's cottage. A study or retreat built by Sir Warwick Fairfax in the vicinity of the gardener's cottage is secluded by surrounding hedges of African olives, planted by Fairfax (pers.comm., Stuart Read & Lester Tropman, site visit, 7/11/2011). =The Harrington Park Homestead Complex= The homestead complex consists of the homestead and associated elements and features. The buildings and structures on the site include the following: *Harrington Park Homestead; *Garden Study; *The Studio (Billiard Room); *Farm Cottages 1 & 2, including swimming pool; *Farm Storage Sheds 1, 2 & 3; *Shelter to Pump Station; *Carriage Loop; *Arboretum (collection of trees); and *Part of 1890s arrival drive. Homestead The Homestead comprises a single storey rendered brick vernacular section (1817) and a two-storey single pile Georgian (with later Georgian, Victorian and Modern overlays) rendered brick section which faces south (the earliest part was built between 1817‚Äì29 and then faced north).pers.comm., Lester Tropman, 7/11/2011. A triangular pedimented piece above the central steps and columns. The front has an extensive stone-flagged verandah and a deep wooden fascia under the verandah eaves. Beneath the house is an extensive cellar and a remarkable bowed sitting room at the rear (north), which leads out into the garden. During the residency of Sir Warwick Fairfax's famiuly, the place contained contents and collections that related to their cultural pursuits. A kitchen block lies to the west of the main homestead block. = Condition = As at November, 2005, the residence is in fair condition, but requires extensive works to repair the masonry and joinery. The roof has been renewed to control falling damp and termite detection systems have been installed. The farm cottages and shedding are in fair to good condition. The landscape/garden areas are suffering from the drought. The large trees and generally drought resistant shrubs and perennials are in good condition. The driveway, entry gates, carriage loop and arrival area are in good condition. The garden Studio (Billiard) is in good condition and the Garden Study is in fair condition. Archaeological Potential The valued archaeological components of the Homestead Complex include former building sites e.g. the nursery sheds and other farm structures. An 1852 plan of the estate sets out an arrangement of buildings relating to the entry road arriving from the west to the carriage loop at the front of homestead. Areas of the site associated with these early arrangements of structures are important and have archaeological potential. Stables were shown to the east of the loop and stock yards were shown to the west. Footings to the stock yard structures are evident in the service road's western edge. A kitchen building was shown to the north of the homestead and a garden area and gardener's cottage was shown to the east area beyond the stables. Paddocks, fence lines and entry roads were indicated. The site has potential to yield information regarding the other buildings of this 1852 plan. The Estate has somewhat lost its integrity due to the residential development in the southern portion of the estate. The Homestead Complex, including gardens, garden study, and farm complex, retain their integrity. = Modifications and dates = The following modifications have been made to the Harrington Park estate: *1815 grant of 2000 acres *1828 800 acres cleared, 200 in cultivation *1829 sale of part of estate to relative John Douglas Campbell (this later became Oran Park) *Northeast moiety as defined by Cobbitty Road was leased in 1832 and eventually sold, leaving Cobbitty Road as the estate's northern boundary * map shows a gardener's cottage and kitchen garden to the homestead's south-east and a racecourse formed on the lower slope south-west of the homestead towards Narellan Creek. *Entrances to the property from both Cowpasture Rd (now Camden Valley Way) and Cobbitty Road (now Oran Park Road). The original entrance passed over the later racecourse and arrived at the carriage loop via the south-west near the stockyards. *1853+ Davy made substantial improvements to estate, house and garden, planting much in the latter (see below) *s-90s photo shows a grassed carriage loop with shrubs or small trees in a garden bed abutting the verandah.

Stage two of this extends north of Narellan Creek. *1997 a proposal for an altered curtilage around the homestead was rejected by Camden Council.Morris & Britton, 2000, 34 The following modifications have been made to the Harrington Park homestead: *1817 ‚Äì Original single storey cottage, now kitchen wing *1825 ‚Äì Single pile 2-storey section of homestead to south of original cottage. *1830 ‚Äì Bow front to homestead's northern elevation and dining room *1860 ‚Äì Verandah modifications *1890 ‚Äì Verandah changed to cast iron posts etc. and ogee roof, roof shingles replaced with corrugated iron *1930 ‚Äì Sunroom to north-west elevation *1955 ‚Äì Alterations and additions including west kitchen additions, verandah (front terrace) *1967 ‚Äì Master bedroom and retreat to north-eastern end /elevation of homestead The following modifications have been made to the garden structures: * ‚Äì Studio (Billiard) ( converted cottage) *1957 ‚Äì Garden Study * ‚Äì Nursery established west of house *1967 two pavilion style rooms (master bedroom and retreat) added to the northern side of the house by architect Marcel Weyland. The following modifications have been made to the garden: *by 1852 a race course established between the house and Narellan Creek. At that time the estate comprised 800 acres of cleared land, pasture and forest with crop paddocks and a vegetable garden near the house. *1850s‚Äì60s Davy planted many mature coniferous and other trees most likely after 1853, including Araucaria bidwillii (Bunya Bunya pines) and A.cunninghamii (hoop pine) and Cupressus sempervirens (Mediterranean cypress). Other major modifications include: *1890s major house renovations occurred and a new drive created that passed an ornamental pond and enetered through a picket-fenced gateway to the garden on the east of the house. A number of tall shrubs in the garden bed next to the verandah were removed at this time. Pedestals were added at the foot of the verandah steps. * an aerial photograph (transfer to the Fairfax family) shows the garden as having a defined southern edge with the garden extending east over part of the area shown as garden (kitchen/vegetable garden) and gardener's house on the 1842 map. The racecourse was no longer clear but the cleared alluvial flats were still cleared.  Heritage listing  As at 11 November 2005, Harrington Park is of State significance as one of the earliest \\"Cow Pasture\\" homesteads on the Cumberland Plain. Harrington Park forms part of a grant to the mariner and trader, William Douglas Campbell, by Governor Macquarie in 1815. The homestead built in stages between 1817 and 1827, associated structures, gardens, landscape features, and remnant grazing paddocks have historical, social, aesthetic and technical significance at the State level. Harrington Park demonstrates the layout of a gentleman's estate with views and vistas afforded to and from the homestead over the landscape and important access routes. The remnant cultural landscape has many features of individual significance such as the original cottage, early homestead, garden, entry drive from the old Cowpastures Road (Camden Valley Way), the 1957 garden studio and the remaining estate area. Historically the quintessential landscape character ‚Äì based on the traditional juxtaposition of homestead area, with its dominant garden, and cleared pastureland beyond ‚Äì represented one of the best examples of this intentional contrast as well as the siting of a homestead group on a landform summit in the Cumberland Plain / Camden area. The place currently retains some key historical visual relationships ‚Äì vistas to Orielton, Studley Park, the spire of St. John's Church, Camden and the Razorback Range. Its historical relationship to other nearby early grants (Orielton & Oran Park) and its place in the development of the local area can still be appreciated. The place currently retains its historical local prominence and serves as an important local landmark. The property has strong associations with members of the ruling class in early NSW and the familial dynasties of the Campbells (1810s ‚Äì 1850s); the Rudds-Brittens (1870s ‚Äì 1920s) and the Fairfax publishing family 1940s ‚Äì 2005). The place has considerable capacity to demonstrate its development from the early 1810s to the present. It is of considerable scientific interest on account of its archaeological research potential. Harrington Park was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 22 December 2006 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Harrington Park estate is of State significance as the main part of a grant to William Douglas Campbell by Governor Macquarie in 1815. This land encompasses the house that Campbell built in stages from 1817 to 1827. The property was part of a landscape dotted with similar gentlemen's properties established on generous grants from colonial governors and lieutenant governors. However, the house is one of the earliest in the vicinity of Cowpastures and one of few 1820s dwellings remaining on the Cumberland Plain. The homestead at Harrington Park is earlier than the Macarthurs' Camden Park (1840) and only a few years later than their Home Farm cottage, which replaced the rough hut at Belgenny. Although the Harrington Park homestead now shares its land with modern housing estates, it still retains sufficient grounds, farm buildings and improved pastures to demonstrate the style of living enjoyed by gentleman farmers in the early nineteenth century. This area at the edge of the Cumberland Plain represented a landscape where Europeans were physically and mentally comfortable. The large property owners who settled this area and built their impressive houses later were all recreating the situation of a county gentleman in the British Isles. The natural landscape of the Camden/Narellan area reminded these settlers of home and their own enhancement of their grounds increased that similarity. Harrington Park homestead is significant as a fine example of an upper-class colonial society's model of a Gentleman's Estate from an era when this model was taken seriously. Its perpetuation illustrates the interdependence of pastoral, mercantile and estate modes of life in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Harrington Park is a good representative example of a gentleman's estate from 1817 (granted in 1815). The continued adaptive reuse of the residence and the outbuildings is an important part of Harrington Park's history. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Harrington Park homestead is of State significance for its association with members of the ruling class in early NSW. The grantee William Douglas Campbell was a well-known trader who established the salt pork trade with Tahiti. He was a partner of John Macarthur whose properties were at neighbouring Camden but later earned favour with Governor Macquarie for his part in rescuing the English missionaries from Tahiti. The Harrington Park homestead complex is significant for its strong associations with the familial dynasties of the Campbells (1810s‚Äì1850s), the Rudds-Brittons (1870s‚Äì1920s) and the Fairfaxs (1940s‚Äì2005). The homestead was established and developed initially by the Campbell family who held the property for almost 40 years until it was sold in 1852 and used as a country house by a number of owners. The homestead complex is significant for its associations with the squatting age, established when William Rudd Snr, formerly a smallholder from Campbelltown, made his home there after his success with a much larger pastoral lease on the Murrumbidgee. The property was a manifestation of Rudd's upward social mobility. It is also significant for its twentieth century association with Sir Warwick Fairfax, Chairman of John Fairfax Limited, the family company that had published the Sydney Morning Herald since 1841. Communicating with his office by telephone, Sir Warwick ran the paper while he lived part-time at Harrington Park and used the property as a retreat from his business life. While there, he created literary works including plays that were performed in the early 1950s and a book explaining his \\"modern, liberal philosophy\\" in the garden study. The Harrington Park homestead is significant for its associations with prominent architects including Marcel Weyland (b. 1927) who designed the Asian influenced garden study and pavilions linked to the homestead between 1957 and 1967. The earliest phase of the house has been associated with Francis Greenway but this attribution has yet to be verified. The estate has significance at the Local level as the location of the murder of Murdoch Campbell, nephew of Captain Campbell, by an escaping convict. This story has been passed down through the generations and has become somewhat of a local legend. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Harrington Park homestead is of State significance for its ability to demonstrate the layout of an early nineteenth century gentleman's estate with views and vistas afforded to and from the homestead over the landscape and important access routes. The Harrington Park has landmark qualities as the homestead, outbuildings and gardens are prominently located on a knoll which dominates the once rural landscape. The homestead complex, with its signal plantings of Bunya and Hoop pines, is visible from The Northern Road and sections of Camden Valley Way. Despite the residential development of much of the Harrington Park Estate, the homestead knoll and remnant cultural landscape is still easily discernable from the major access routes in the area of The Northern Road and Camden Valley Way. Harrington Park homestead's setting takes advantage of a commanding position in the landscape context of the Camden Valley. This selected position of the homestead shows an understanding of 17th and 18th Century Arcadian and Picturesque European landscape ideals. The Homestead's siting was skilfully selected ‚Äì located on a high knoll with topographical features of hills, alluvial flats, creek lines and distant views to Mount Prudhoe and Razorback Range (the location of a spring on this hill may also have been a deciding factor on the location of the homestead). The gardens surrounding the homestead are significant for retaining plant specimens and garden layouts associated with their early arrangement. The gardens have been arranged to provide a formal garden setting for the homestead, with its signal plantings of Bunya & Hoop pines and collection of specimen trees and shrubs, providing a distinctive presence of the homestead against the undulating topography. The garden study () with its copper pagoda style roof and the glass roofed pavilions linked to the homestead () designed by the architect Marcel Weyland introduces a subtle yet distinct Asian influence to the Australian environment. Weyland who was born in Poland grew up in the Jewish community of Shanghai and was interned there by the Japanese during World War II. Weyland's aesthetic sensibility was no doubt influenced by his experiences in China. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Harrington Park estate is understood to possess local social and cultural significance to Aboriginal people representing the Cubbitch Barta Title Claimants and the Tharawal Local Aboriginal Land Council. The Harrington Park estate and Harrington Park Homestead possesses social significance at the local level for the people of Camden as a prominent historic landmark associated with the early colonial history of Camden. It is held in high esteem by groups who value the historic and aesthetic values of the Cowpastures area, and those who have an interest in the early settlement of New South Wales, especially the Cowpasture frontier. Harrington Park Estate was accessible to the public during Sir Warwick Fairfax's ownership by way of open days and the commercial nursery on the estate. The place is also held in high esteem by Camden Council and the National Trust of Australia (NSW). The site has social significance for the descendants of the familial dynasties that resided at the estate including the Campbells (1810s ‚Äì 1850s); the Rudds-Brittons (1870s ‚Äì 1920s) and the Fairfax publishing family (1940s ‚Äì 2005). The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Harrington Park is of State significance for its ability to demonstrate the evolution of an upper-class working estate from early colonial times to the 20th Century. The evolution of the house in terms of its fabric, dimensions and layout, is illustrative of the social and economic standing of its owners within the colony and their resources and the genteel lifestyle to which they aspired. The homestead gardens and approaches, and vistas from the homestead with managed incident elements in the vistas, demonstrate Australian Colonial garden philosophies from the early and mid-nineteenth century onwards. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Harrington Park is rare at the State level as one of the earliest Gentleman's residences (1817‚Äì1827) dating from the Macquarie period on the Cowpasture frontier of the Cumberland Plain. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The Harrington Park estate is of State significance as a fine example of a Gentleman's Estate from the early 1800s. The Harrington Park homestead is a good representative example of a substantial Georgian Period Homestead with Victorian and Modern period overlays.

She had a short operational career; her crew burnt her in 1805 after she ran aground to prevent the enemy from capturing her. Career With the resumption of war with France in 1803, Britain needed a large number of unrated vessels to protect convoys from privateers, and themselves to impede French coastal commerce. One solution was the hired armed vessels; another was the purchasing of merchantmen and arming them. Orestes was a mercantile vessel brought into the Navy and armed more heavily than she would be were she a cargo ship. The Navy in August 1803 purchased a mercantile vessel, possibly named Ann, and fitted her for naval service between September and November at Woolwich. Commander Thomas Browne commissioned Orestes in August 1803. On 29 August 1804 the armed ship the armed defense ship and Orestes departed the Downs for off Boulogne.Naval Database. On 23 October was in company with and Orestes when they found three praams, seven brigs and 15 luggers off Cap Gris Nez. The French convoy was sailing westward and keeping close inshore under cover of the batteries and an escort of horse artillery that followed them as they made their way to the Banc de Laine. Immortalite closed with the praams under the high land of Cap Blanc Nez, with Orestes and Basilisk joining in the attack. The running fight lasted for more than an hour before the falling tide forced the British to seek deeper water. The French convoy escaped, though possibly with some losses of men. Immortalite herself suffered one man killed, three men mortally wounded and eight others wounded. Fate On 11 July 1805 Orestes ran aground on the Splitter Sands off Gravelines. She had been reconnoitering Dunkirk harbour and was heading back out to see when she struck the ground. The crew lightened her and sent up distress signals. and two gun-brigs came up to assist but to no avail. Orestes settled further into the mud as the tide began to ebb, while French gunboats could be seen getting underway in the harbour. Orestes crew took to her boats and Captain Browne set fire to her as he left to prevent the French capturing her.

Life and career Balcombe was born June 12, 1829 in Utica, New York. His family later relocated to Winona, Minnesota and, after spending brief periods working in Battle Creek, Michigan and Elgin, Illinois, Balcombe settled in Winona as well. In 1856 and 1857 he was elected to the 7th and 8th Minnesota Territorial Legislatures as a Republican. During the combative Minnesota Constitutional Convention in 1857, Balcombe was the president of the Republican faction's convention. After Minnesota achieved statehood, he also served in the 1st Minnesota Legislature as well as on the Board of Regents for the University of Minnesota. In 1861, he was named Indian Agent for the Winnebago (now known as the Ho-Chunk) in Minnesota by President Abraham Lincoln. He was re-appointed in 1865 as agent for the Dakota Territory, but was later removed from office over a political disagreement with President Andrew Johnson. Balcombe relocated to Omaha, Nebraska in 1865 and shortly thereafter purchased the Omaha Republican newspaper. Balcombe was engaged in close rivalries with the city's other newspapers. When the Omaha Daily Herald attempted to secretly begin publishing a morning edition in 1867, Balcombe was tipped off and hurriedly published a morning edition of the Republican as well. In 1873 he published an editorial critical of the rival Omaha Daily Bee editor Edward Rosewater. An angry Rosewater confronted Balcombe with a whip on the street, but was overpowered, disarmed and sat upon by the larger Balcombe. The Republican was later merged into a holding company which Balcombe was a shareholder of. In 1876 he divested himself from the business completely. Balcombe later played a role in the arrest and trial of Jack McCall for the murder of Wild Bill Hickok. In 1876 he was named a deputy United States Marshal for the Wyoming Territory. On August 29th, 1876 he overheard McCall bragging about the crime in Laramie, Wyoming and arrested him. McCall was later tried for the murder in Yankton, South Dakota, convicted, and sentenced to death. Later life and death Later in his life, Balcombe remained involved in Omaha politics and business. He served on the founding board of directors for the Omaha Public Library and the city's Board of Public Works among other positions.

San Sebsatian died in his paddock in New Zealand at the age of 11 in December 2005. Background San Sebastian was a chestnut horse bred in England by the Hampshire-based Meon Valley Stud. In September 1995 the yearling colt was put up for auction at Tattersalls and sold to Brian Grassick Bloodstock for 32,000 guineas. He entered the ownership of Ricardo Sanz and was sent into training with Brian Grassick's brother Michael Grassick at the Curragh in Ireland. He was sired by the American-bred stallion Niniski, who won the Irish St Leger and the Prix Royal-Oak in 1979 before going on to sire many good staying horses including Petoski, Assessor, Minster Son and Hernando. San Sebastian's dam Top of the League showed modest racing ability, winning one minor event from thirteen starts. Top of the League also produced the Lancashire Oaks winner Noushkey as well as Chesa Plana, the dam of Alkaased. As a descendant of the broodmare Mesopotamia, she was also related to Halling, Cherokee Rose, Mukhadram, Mastery, Balla Cove and Alderbrook. Racing career =Early career= San Sebastian finished unplaced in all three of his starts as a juvenile in 1996. After his debut in a maiden race at Leopardstown Racecourse in August but the operation brought no immediate improvement as he was well beaten in minor races at the Curragh and Navan in October. In 1997 San Sebastian was campaigned in handicap races. After finishing ninth at Tipperary he ran fourth at Downpatrick: in the latter race he was equipped with blinkers and wore the headgear in all of his subsequent races. Eddie Ahern, who became the horse's regular jockey over the next two years, took the ride when San Sebastian recorded his first success in a small race over eleven furlongs at Sligo Racecourse on 1 June. San Sebastian won his next three races, taking minor events over thirteen furlongs at Wexford Racecourse in July and August before coming home five lengths of his rivals at Cork on 11 October. On his last run of the year he finished a close second under a weight of 129 pounds in a thirty-runner handicap at Leopardstown. =1998: four-year-old season= On his first run as a four-year-old San Sebastian crossed the line in front in a handicap at Cork on 13 April but was relegated to second after the racecourse stewards ruled that he had hampered the runner-up Archive Footage by hanging to the left in the closing stages. At Clonmel Racecourse a month later he completed an unusual and unwelcome double when he finished first but was disqualified for causing interference to the second placed horse Black Queen. At Gowran Park on 30 May he belatedly opened his winning account for the year as he won \\"easily\\" by two lengths from Broken Rites when carrying 130 pounds in a fourteen furlong handicap. On 16 June 1998, San Sebastian was sent to England for the Ascot Stakes over two and a half miles at Royal Ascot. Ridden by Ahern he was assigned a weight of 131 pounds and started at odds of 16/1 against twenty-eight opponents. After being restrained towards the rear of the field he began to make steady progress six furlongs out, overtook the favourite Rainbow Frontier in the straight and drew away to win by four lengths. Ahern commented \\"I was going so well I had to kick on earlier than I wanted but he really kept going\\" while Grassick recalled his days as an assistant to his father Christy Grassick saying \\"I used to look after Godswalk but I missed seeing him win [at Royal Ascot] because somebody had to stay at home and look after the horses. Our worry was the trip but he stayed well today\\". After finishing first in eight of his last nine races, San Sebastian was strongly fancied when he returned from a break of over three months to contest the Group 1 Prix du Cadran over 4000 metres at Longchamp Racecourse on 3 October. Racing on soft ground he finished third behind Invermark and Tiraaz, beaten four and a half lengths by the winner. At the end of the month San Sebastian started favourite for the Cesarewitch at Newmarket Racecourse but ran very badly and came home twentieth of the twenty- nine runners. When asked for an explanation for the gelding's poor performance Grassick and Ahern reported that San Sebastian was \\"feeling the effects of a long season\\". =1999: five-year-old season= In 1999 San Sebastian left handicap competition and was campaigned exclusively in weight-for-age races. He began his campaign by coming home unplaced behind Celeric in the Sagaro Stakes at Ascot in April and then ran third to Enzeli and Risk Material in the Saval Beg Stakes at Leopardstown a month later. On 18 June he returned to Royal Ascot for the Queen Alexandra Stakes over two and three quarter miles in which he was partnered by Mick Kinane and started at 4/1 in a ten-runner field. He tracked the leaders before taking the lead two furlongs out and held off the sustained challenge of Jaseur to win by a neck with five lengths back to the Doncaster Cup winner Canon Can in third place. San Sebastian ran fifth in the Challenge Stakes at Leopardstown in July and then finished fourth to Royal Rebel in the Ballycullen Stakes at the same track in August. In the Doncaster Cup on 9 September he was ridden for the last time by Ahern and came home fourth of the six runners behind Far Cry, Rainbow High and Celeric. On his final start of the year he ran for the second time in the Prix du Cadran and was beaten a neck into second place by Tajoun. At the end of October the gelding was offered for sale at Tattersalls for 170,000 guineas by Charlie Gordon-Watson Bloodstock. He henceforth raced in the colours of Mrs Michael Watt and was transferred to England where he was trained by John Dunlop at Arundel, West Sussex. =2000: six-year-old season= San Sebastian ran consistently for his new trained in the spring and summer of 2000. He ran fourth to Orchestra Stall in the Sagaro Stakes and sixth to Persian Punch in the Henry II Stakes at Sandown Park before running for the third time at Royal Ascot when he contested the Group 1 Ascot Gold Cup. He came home fourth behind Kayf Tara, Far Cry and Compton Ace after being hampered by the winner a furlong out in an incident which saw his jockey Damien Oliver drop his whip. He went on to finish a close third to Royal Rebel and Far Cry in the Goodwood Cup but ran poorly when coming home sixth of nine behind Enzeli in the Doncaster Cup. On 1 October at Longchamp the gelding was ridden by Davy Bonilla when he made his third attempt to win the Prix du Cadran and started the 122/1 complete outsider of the nine runners. The Aga Khan's entry of Enzeli and Tajoun was made ods-on favourite while the other runners included Royal Rebel, Persian Punch, Churlish Charm (Yorkshire Cup) and Three Cheers (Prix de Lut√®ce). Persian Punch set the pace and opened up a clear advantage from Enzeli, with Bonilla settling his mount close behind. San Sebastian began to make progress in the straight, overhauled Persian Punch 100 metres from the finish and won by half a length with Royal Rebel, Churlish Charm, Enzeli and Tajoun just behind. Three weeks later at the same track San Sebastian ended his season by finishing second of the eleven runners behind Amilynx in the Prix Royal-Oak. =Later career, retirement and death= In 2001 San Sebastian failed to win in eight races, but ran well in some top-class staying events. He ran second in the Sagaro Stakes, third on his attempt to repeat his success in the Cadran and fourth in the Ascot Gold Cup, Lonsdale Stakes and Jockey Club Cup and fifth in the Goodwood Cup. On his two other starts he came home unplaced in the Doncaster Cup and Prix Royal-Oak. At the end of the year the gelding left Dunlop's stable and was sent to France where he was trained by Marcel Rolland. On his first three starts of 2002 the gelding was unplaced twice in France and then ran for the fifth time at Royal Ascot where he came home fourth in the Queen Alexandra Stakes. After a summer break he returned on 10 September in a hurdles at Auteuil Hippodrome and won by three quarters of a length from the four-year-old Dorado. In October he ran for the fifth time in the Prix du Cadran and came home ninth of the sixteen runners behind Give Notice. On his final European start he reverted to hurdles for the Grand Prix d'Automne at Auteuil and finished last of the eight runners. San Sebastian was exported to New Zealand where he competed in steeplechases winning at least three races and finishing second in the Grand National Steeplechase at Riccarton Park Racecourse in August 2004. He was retired from racing shortly afterwards and died from a suspected brain haemorrhage in December 2005. On hearing of the horses's death John Dunlop recalled \\"He made you laugh because he didn't do a tap and it was funny to watch him and our other senior stayer, Orchestra Stall, coming up the gallops like two old gents\\".

Career  Jurvetson works as a private practice physician in Los Altos, California.  Personal life  In 1990, she married Steve Jurvetson, who become a Silicon Valley early-stage investor in companies including SpaceX in 2000 and Tesla in 2006. They were married for more than 25 years and have two children. As of 2018, the couple was separated with divorce proceedings underway. In 2017, to honor her father's 50-year career as a medical school professor, Jurvetson helped fund the construction of the new Stanford Medical Center and endowed a professorship in her parents‚Äô names.  Philanthropy  Jurvetson served on the board of directors of Peninsula Open Space Trust from 2003 to 2006 and was a founding donor to Wildlife Conservation Network (2002 to present). After touring deforestation on the slopes of Mauna Kea in 2016, she sponsored the planting of 1,000 indigenous trees through the Hawaiian Legacy Reforestation Initiative. She served as a school board for The Nueva School, which is located in the San Francisco Bay Area and was previously a kindergarten through 8th grade school. She co-chaired the school's $50 million capital campaign, which resulted in the construction of the San Mateo campus and the addition of a high school to Nueva (2011‚Äì2018). Jurvetson has been a trustee on several other non-profit boards, including the San Francisco Ballet (2000-2003). She was named by Gentry Magazine as one of the top 50 philanthropists in the San Francisco Bay Area. As of 2020, Jurvetson is a supporter of the San Francisco Asian Art Museum and she serves on the Advisory Board of Stanford Center for Philanthropy and Civil Society, which focuses on \\"the way we use private resources for public benefit.\\"  Political activism  Karla Jurvetson has volunteered as a political organizer and a fundraiser for many progressive candidates over the past thirty years, including hosting a Democratic National Committee (DNC) reception at her home in November 2019 with President Barack Obama. At that time, the DNC had just $8.7 million cash on hand and $7 million in debts, compared to the Republican National Committee and the Trump campaign, which had over $158 million cash on hand. Golden State Warriors player Stephen Curry and his wife, Ayesha Curry, were co-hosts for the event, which raised over $3.5 million for the DNC Unity Fund that was formed to support the eventual Democratic presidential nominee. As a Stanford undergraduate in 1988, Jurvetson went door-to-door for Anna Eshoo during her first campaign for Congress, handing out VCR tapes of Eshoo discussing her candidacy. In 2008 Jurvetson volunteered in the swing state of Nevada for then-candidate Barack Obama, as well as making 46 contributions to Democrats totaling $128,700. In 2016, she canvassed door-to-door in Nevada for Hillary Clinton and for Catherine Cortez Masto, who became the first Latina U.S. Senator. After the election of Donald Trump in November 2016, her donations to Democratic candidates markedly increased to $6.9 million in advance of the 2018 midterms, making her one of the nation's top political donors. In an interview about the 2018 elections, Jurvetson said, \\"Women disproportionately were the activists, the volunteers, the people who drove change... Women have gained enough economic power and political power so we can translate our frustration into action... I feel like it‚Äôs our moral duty, if we‚Äôre not going to run ourselves, to support the women who are brave enough to put their names on the ballot.\\" The candidates whom she supported include Lauren Underwood, the youngest African-American woman to serve in Congress, and Sharice Davids and Deb Haaland, the first two Native American Congresswomen in the history of the United States. In 2018, Jurvetson also helped with voter registration drives, co-hosted local fundraisers, and contributed to each of the 41 candidates who flipped a Congressional district from red to blue in the midterms, when Democrats regained control of the U.S. House of Representatives. Controversy arose with her large donation of $5.4m to Women Vote!, the political action committee run by EMILY's List. Her donation was in the form of Baidu shares, a Chinese internet company traded on the US stock exchange and was unusual outside of Silicon Valley since it was in the form of stock shares. The controversy arose because only American citizens can donate to U.S. elections. An EMILY's List spokesperson said, \\"We cleared the donation through our lawyers\\". In November 2018, Jurvetson was listed as one of five \\"surprising million dollar donors\\" to the US midterm elections. Jurvetson also was an early supporter of the only two U.S. Senate candidates who were successful in changing their seats from Republican to Democratic control in 2018, Jacky Rosen in Nevada and Kyrsten Sinema in Arizona. By a margin of 56,000 votes, Sinema became the first Democrat that Arizona elected to the Senate in 30 years. In a November 2018 interview, Jurvetson stated that she was hoping for a competitive Democratic primary for the 2020 presidential election and did not yet have a preferred candidate. In 2019 she made donations to several presidential candidates including Julian Castro, Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar, Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand, Beto O'Rourke and Cory Booker. In 2019 Jurvetson also contributed over $2 million to Fair Fight, which was founded by Stacey Abrams after her loss by less than 55,000 votes in the race for Georgia governor against Brian Kemp, which was marred by Kemp having cancelled the voter registrations of 1.4 million Georgians when he was Secretary of State. Fair Fight combats voter suppression, especially among historically disenfranchised communities. In January 2020 she donated $14.6 million to Persist PAC, which supported Elizabeth Warren's presidential campaign. In June 2020, when Joe Biden secured the Democratic nomination, she contributed $1,000,000 to his PAC, Unite the Country. As of July 2020, she had made over 500 individual donations to Democratic candidates, ranging from local to federal office. She currently is on the Board of Advisors for The Collective, which has the mission of increasing Black representation in the political process. Jurvetson also serves on the Board of Directors of EMILY's List, the nation's largest organization for women in politics, which has over five million members.

It was built from 1816 by John Oxley. It is also known as Kirkham Stables and Precinct. The property is privately owned. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 11 August 2000.  History  The Camden region was originally occupied by the Gundungurra people.Weir Phillips, 2014 Soon after settling Sydney Cove, colonists set out to explore the Sydney region. When soils around Sydney Cove proved unsuitable for cultivation, a second settlement was established at Rose Hill (later Parramatta) in late 1788. The first Europeans known to have explored the Camden area were Captain Watkin Tench, Lieut. William Dawes and surgeon George Worgan in 1790. Tench noted the country around Camden as a plain with few trees and sandy soil, while the area closer to the Nepean River was thickly wooded. The area was little disturbed until cattle which had escaped soon after the First Fleet's arrival were re-discovered in the Camden area in 1795. The area became known as the \\"Cow Pastures\\". Access and settlement was restricted in the area to protect and nurture the cattle. The first grant in the area was to John Macarthur in 1805. He would eventually amass a vast estate of here. A number of grants were made in the area following the overthrow of Governor Bligh in 1809. To counteract the influence of John Macarthur, Governor Macquarie began distributing land on the northern and eastern sides of the Nepean River. One of the largest he made was to Surveyor- General, John Oxley, in 1810. =Oxley family= One of the first land grants in the area was to John Oxley.Godden Mackay, pp 5-9, 1998 Present-day Kirkham Lane defines the eastern boundary of his original grant. In 1815 his holding expanded to with purchase of adjacent land. Oxley named his grant Kirkham, after the Abbey in Yorkshire, where he was born. In 1816 he erected a large house and other farm buildings which included the stables building. The stable Oxley built included horse boxes, storage areas to the rear, a loft and some rooms that were used for accommodation. Farm workers and convicts are rumoured to have stayed in the building when the farm population was at its highest. By late 1825, the first school in the Camden area run by Charles Gordon was operating from Kirkham, and through February 1826 the first regular Protestant church services were also being held there. During the Oxley family's ownership, Kirkham was a well-regarded horse stud. The English stallion \\"Bachelor\\" stood at the stud in 1830. In 1827, the Reverend Thomas Hassell held a Christmas service in the stable loft attended by the family and up to fifty convicts. Oxley cultivated wheat and sheep on Kirkham. By 1824 he had 4000 sheep and was winning awards for his merinos. Kirkham was one of five large estates in the area employing convict labour. Oxley had married Emma Norton in 1821.Weir Phillips, 2014, 5-6 Oxley died in 1828 and the property was passed on to his eldest son, John Norton Oxley. During John Norton's minority, Kirkham was managed by Captain Coghill, who had previously worked part of the farm. Coghill grew wheat and maize, which was processed on site in a mill erected in 1828. Farmers from the surrounding area, including the Macarthurs of Camden Park, used this mill. It was used until the 1860s, after which time wheat rust (a fungus) destroyed the wheat crops and production ceased. The mill was demolished in the 1880s.Weir Phillips, 2014, 6 The farm stayed with the Oxley family and operated as a farm and horse stud farm.Godden Mackay, 1998 When he reached his superiority, John Norton Oxley returned to run Kirkham. He married Harriet, daughter of the Reverend James Hassell and had seven children. The Oxleys prospered until the 1870s, when they were involved in a failed cattle raising enterprise in Queensland. The ensuing financial disaster led to the sale of Kirkham. Despite his many business interests, Oxley was \\"much embarrassed in his pecuniary circumstances\\" at the time of his death, so much so that the Executive Council felt compelled to come to the assistance of his widow and two sons. While refusing to grant a pension, the British Government gave his sons a grant in recognition of their father's services. An advertisement in The Sydney Morning Herald edition of 6 December 1870 noted its improvements (all 'first class and in good repair') included about of fine rich arable land, spacious brick-built family residence (with ten apartments, kitchen, servants' rooms, dairy, wine house and numerous outbuildings), several well-arranged dwelling houses ('labourers' dwellings'), a superior steam flour mill (with horizontal 10-horse power engine, boiler, French stones, machinery and gear in perfect working order), spacious granary, a superior cottage (of 7 rooms with outbuildings, garden etc.), a large brick building used as a stables (12 stalls), and nearly the whole estate is cleared, stumped and ready for the plough... a \\"choice vineyard - 5 acres of fine old vines, from which 800-1000 gallons of wine are usually made\\", together with farm houses, etc., about 80 acres of timber reserved for shelter.Weir Phillips, 2014, 7 =White family= The estate was sold to James White in the mid-1870s. White (1828‚Äì90), born in Stroud, son of a former overseer for the Australian Agricultural Company. During his 20s he became a land owner in the Hunter Valley, and later elected to the NSW Legislative Council as a member for the Upper Hunter Valley (1864-8; 1874) in the 1870s. White was an important figure in the horse racing industry: a long term committee member of the Australian Jockey Club and its chairman in 1880 and from 1883-90. Although he had racing horses on his Hunter Valley properties, Kirkham enjoyed better access to the Sydney race tracks. Late nineteenth century newspapers regularly reported the results of the Kirkham Stud. White also bred horses at his Segenhoe property and built the lavish heritage-listed Big Stable Newmarket in Randwick. The most famous Kirkham horse was stallion \\"Chester\\", who won 19 out of 29 starts, including the Melbourne Cup. White won five AJC Derbys (1884‚Äì89) and six VRC Derbys (1877‚Äì90). He is reputed to have collected over A¬£121,000 in stakes from 66 horses winning 252 races. \\"Chester\\" died in 1891 and is said to be buried close to the Kirkham Stables. White also raced horses, unsuccessfully, in England. White carried out improvements to Kirkham estate. The original Oxley homestead was demolished in c.1882, possibly after damage by fire. White commissioned John Horbury Hunt to design a new mansion in the French Gothic style. Hunt had earlier carried out substantial extensions to White's Sydney villa, Cranbrook, at Rose Bay (Bellevue Hill). The mansion he built at Kirkham, now known as Camelot, is separately listed on the State Heritage Register and located on an adjoining property (south of Kirkham Lane). The Camden-Campbelltown Railway line was constructed during White's period of ownership, in 1882. Kirkham Railway Station was the second of nine stations on this line, which operated until the 1960s.Weir Phillips, 2014, 8 No construction date has been identified for the existing dwelling on the site. The Godden Mackay 1998 conservation management plan suggests a likely date of mid-late 19th century, based on physical evidence. It is thus likely to have been built during the White family ownership. It has been suggested that the dwelling was moved to its existing location at an unknown time.Weir Phillips, 2014, 9 White died in 1890, but the place still operated as a horse stud. Stock was once again sold off on Emily Scott's death in 1897. The property appears to have been broken up at this time and the horses and Jersey dairy herd sold off. =Subsequent ownership= By 1902 a section of land comprising of Oxley's grant and of Lord's adjoining grant had been subdivided from the original Oxley land of and sold. During most of the 20th century the property has been used for grazing dairy cattle. The current dairy on the site was built in and represents the modernization of dairy facilities on the farm. The property has had a number of different owners over the ensuing years, with boundary adjustments, identified by Godden Mackay (1998) as follows: *1902H. L. MacKellar to Isabella Lewis. MacKellar had formerly managed the Kirkham Stud for Mrs. Scott and in 1898 purchased the pick of the Jersey dairy herd. He later became the official starter for the AJC; *1920Edward Lewis and Walter W. Robins to James Doyle; *1926Doyle to Thomas Glugston of Narellan, 'farmer'; *1928Glugston to Arthur Wm. Coleman of Darlinghurst, 'builder'; *1930Coleman to Thomas Clugston, of the residence; *1936George Reading (current mortgagee) to Wm. Joseph Hammond of Sydney, 'merchant'; *1941Hammond to Frank and Ruby Viola Beazley, 'graziers'; *1945Ruby Beazley to Archibald Joseph Chapman of Narellan, 'farmer'; *1951Chapman to Sir Frederick Walter Sutton, Chairman of the Sutton Group of Companies. Sutton resided at Kirkham regularly with his wife. Improvements undertaken under their ownership included construction of at least five buildings associated with horse stud operations, a new dairy and other farm machine buildings. Landscape works were also carried out, including plantings on Kirkham Lane, around the dam and on the loop entry road. A new set of entry gates, believed to have come originally from Scotland, were installed, replacing gates in the same location. *From 1951The Sutton Group of Companies began upgrading and improvement works to again establish a racehorse stud at Kirkham. The farm's dairy ceased operation in 1990. Although the property is still stocked with beef cattle, the horse stud operation has now also finished. The boundaries of the current farm site are markedly reduced from the second Oxley grant in 1815. It now consists of part of the 1902 subdivision of Oxley's original 1810 grant (land east of Kirkham Lane) which was further reduced at the end of the 20th century for a residential subdivision on the northern part of the property. Within the stables precinct itself a mixed degree of integrity is evident with the introduction of a number of mid-late 20th century stabling and milking yards, machinery sheds, stable buildings and garages now encroaching on the curtilage of the Kirkham Stable building.Weir Phillips, 2014, 30  Description  =The Kirkham Stables precinct= The precinct contains many buildings including a homestead, workers cottage, managers cottage, stud breeding building, small stables building, horse stables, garages/office, milking sheds, machinery shed, a toilet block, shelter structures, and several built elements including a memorial to Chester ( a racehorse), a memorial to Oxley and monumental entrance gates. However, only the original stable is described in detail below. Other notes follow. =Kirkham Stables (1816)= This building is in Colonial Georgian style, the design being essentially functionalist, with little of no ornament, and composed in an ordered manner. It is rectangular in its form, with largely symmetrical elevations and well-proportioned openings. The Stables block is the only building that survives of Oxley's 1816 buildings (a large homestead once stood on the south-western side of Kirkham Lane.Weir Phillips, 2014, 5 The Stables are constructed of between 350 and 450 thick masonry walls, now with a rough cast cement render on stone foundations. A brickwork plinth, approximately 1m in height. is used on the front of Kirkham Lane elevations. The building is buttressed along the rear elevation, at each end and at third points. The Stables have a hipped roof, pitched at approximately 33.5 degrees. It is currently clad in painted corrugated iron sheeting. Original shingles appear to remain intact underneath both layers of corrugated-iron. An avenue of English oaks (Quercus robur) marked the entrance to the property. These led to the original 1812 Oxley homestead, which burnt down and was demolished in 1882.Stuart Read, pers.comm., 5 May 2015 =Setting= Following the property's 1951 acquisition by the Sutton Group of Companies, Sir Frederick Sutton and wife resided here regularly and built at least 5 buildings (horse stud operations), a new dairy and other farm machine buildings. Landscape works were undertaken including plantings on Kirkham Lane around the dam and on the loop entry road. A new set of entry gates, believed to have come originally from Scotland, were installed, replacing an earlier set of gates in the same location. The Kirkham Lane boundary has two mature lines of trees which appear to be silky oaks (Grevillea robusta) and sweet gums (Liquidambar styraciflua). =Garden around homestead= The homestead garden has a range of mature trees, one of which that is prominent is a Himalayan cedar (Cedrus deodara) near the rear service courtyard. A couple of other large deciduous trees are also in the vicinity and may be sweet gums or perhaps pin oaks (Quercus palustris) by branch pattern. Southwest of the house elevation is a large pin oak (Q.palustris). In front of the house's front verandah has colour which appears to be an Asian pear (P.calleryana/ussuriensis). The view from the house's front rose garden east over paddocks is framed by mature trees on Northern and Southern sides. Between the Stables and Manager's house is a large deciduous tree, either a sweet gum or an Asian pear, among other trees. Near a modern toilet block north-west of the Stables is a large hybrid plane tree (Platanus x acerifolia). = Condition = As at 20 October 1999, the physical condition is fair.  Heritage listing  As at 20 October 1999, Kirkham Stables constructed in 1816, is probably the oldest large stable/farm buildings in Australia. It is a fine Colonial building of a simple and strong symmetrical design. It is a landmark building whose setting is a relatively intact pastoral landscape, with its historic boundaries still comprehensible. It remains within a farm setting that retains views to and from other contemporary historic places. The Kirkham Stables precinct provides evidence of a continuity of farming operations dating from the earliest period of settlement to the present. The Kirkham Precinct is significant as evidence of changing agricultural and pastoral practices during that period, and for its association with the development of specialist pastoral bloodstock breeding operations. Kirkham Stables precinct is associated with important figures in colonial and mid nineteenth-century history. Surveyor Lieutenant John Oxley, an engineer and important figure in the early development of Australia, established Kirkham. A later owner, James White, was an important figure in the pastoral history of NSW, a member of the NSW Parliament and a successful owner and breeder of racehorses. The Kirkham Precinct was the focus of considerable community social activity during early days of settlement and was a focus for work for people living both inside and outside the property.Godden Mackay, pp 51-52, 1998 Kirkham Stables was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 11 August 2000 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Kirkham Stables and its broader setting provide evidence of an early Australian land grant and the earliest period rural activity outside central Sydney and Parramatta. It provides evidence of the nature of early farming operations in Australia. It is evidence of the pattern of land alienation, settlement and use in the Camden area. It is associated with Surveyor-General Lieut. John Oxley, and explorer and important figure in the early development of Australia. The historic setting of Kirkham Stables, being Oxley's land holding from 1815, is significant and can still be understood within a largely open landscape defined on three sides by strong geographic and historic boundaries; Camden Valley Way, Macquarie Grove Road and the Nepean River. Kirkham Stables is associated with James White, an important figure in the pastoral history of NSW, a member of the NSW Parliament and a successful owner and breeder of racehorse. The Kirkham Stables was the focus for early and religious activities in the local area and is associated with important early local persons, including Rev. Thomas Hassell.Godden Mackay pp49-50, 1998 The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Kirkham Stables is a large and impressive Colonial Georgian style building which provides evidence of a formal understanding of design and taste in that period. The symmetrical design and layout of the Stables, and its close relationship with the formal approach of Kirkham Lane, are features of the early nineteenth-century approach to design and setting. The Kirkham Stables precinct, including the late Victorian period homestead and timber store, retains a pleasant farm character and a visual relationship to and from adjoining historic properties and key approaches.Godden Mackay, pp50, 1998 The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Although no particular research has been undertaken in relation to social value or significance, it is likely that the contemporary local community identifies strongly with the sense of place that remains around Camden, associated with this early history and the role of early properties in the establishment of pastoralism in Australia. Kirkham was significant as the focus of considerable community social activity during early days of settlement in this area, and it is likely that it was also a focus for work for people living outside the property. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Kirkham Stables has the potential to provide evidence of past farming techniques and practices. Documentary evidence indicates archaeological potential in regard to previous structures and paddocks in areas near Kirkham Stables.Godden Mackay, pp51, 1998 The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Kirkham Stables are probably the oldest large stable building surviving in Australia. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Kirkham Stables are a representative example of early barn and stable farm buildings.

The experiment studied magnetic plasma confinement to support controlled nuclear fusion experiments. Specifically, TCS pioneered the sustainment and heating of a Field-Reversed Configuration (FRC) by Rotating Magnetic Field (RMF). The experiment was upgraded in 2006 to form the Translation Confinement Sustainment experiment -Upgraded (TCS-U).  Background  FRCs are of interest to the plasma physics community because of their confinement properties and their small size. While most large fusion experiments in the world are tokamaks, FRCs are seen as a viable alternative because of their higher Beta, meaning the same power output could be produced from a smaller volume of plasma, and their good plasma stability.  History  In the 1990s, the Large-S Experiment (LSX) had demonstrated that there exist kinetically stabilized regimes of operation in which FRC reactors could operate. However, the LSX used a method of forming FRCs called a theta-pinch, which does not allow FRCs to be further sustained and heated. The US Department of Energy funded the TCS program as an extension of LSX, in order to demonstrate the RMF method of sustaining FRCs formed via the theta-pinch method. TCS was contemporary with other RMF-FRCs such as the STX, the PV Rotamak, and the PFRC.

The most important distinguishing features of the rapid intervention forces are the manpower, weapons and equipment appropriate to this brigade, the possibility of early and timely intervention, and the professional training received by the brigade. History The brigade was formed on August 1, 2014 as the rapid reaction force (Desert Hawk), then became on 5 November 2017 Rapid reaction Brigade and on June 25, 2018 was renamed under the banner of rapid intervention / high-readiness brigade, which is subordinate to Directorate of joint military operations. In 2017, the units from deactivated 28th Royal Ranger Brigade transferred to QRF Brigade. In November, 2018 the brigade was renamed the \\"Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan Rapid Intervention/High Readiness Brigade\\". Naming the brigade after the UAE crown prince was an ‚Äúexpression of the deep brotherly ties‚Äù between the two countries and comes in appreciation of the role of Sheikh Mohammed and the UAE in supporting the JAF, especially in military housing projects and training schools, according to a Royal Court statement. Mission Jordan has created the brigade to provide a rapid-response capability against situations that may flare up rapidly, particularly along the borders, and to sustain operations for several days. The brigade is an important element in the containment of Daesh and other extremist forces, and both the US and UK have supported this initiative with training and equipment. The Joint Special Operations Command has also taken an important role in shaping the structure and tactical employment of the brigade. Rapid mobility is a crucial element, and additional Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawks ‚Äì which have been in JSOC service for some time ‚Äì have been procured from the US to allow the immediate deployment of the brigade, along with more land vehicles. Communication is another important area in which new systems are being acquired, allowing Jordan to develop a fully deployable command and control capability.

In Afghan-Turki, kara kush means \\"eagle\\" and in the book this refers to the central character, a resistance leader nicknamed \\"The Eagle\\". Page 2 is also archived here on the Wayback Machine. First published in 1986, it is to be republished in January 2019 by ISF Publishing, including new hardcover and paperback editions. Ebook and audiobook editions of Kara Kush will be produced for the first time. Summary The novel is set in 20th‚Äìcentury Afghanistan during the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War, which lasted from 1979 to 1989. It is based on true stories that Shah collected on his travels after secretly entering Afghanistan at the height of the hostilities, to spend time with the Afghan resistance, and find out first-hand what life was like in his ancestral homeland. Shah is quoted in The New York Times as having written the work \\"because it is a tremendous story which had not been told. I collected this material from freedom fighters, some of them my own relatives, from refugees, and from men and women, fighting shoulder to shoulder, from all over Afghanistan: a country the size of France, full of rich tales of valiant struggle against seemingly impossible odds.\\" Centering on a resistance leader nicknamed \\"The Eagle\\", the story also tells of a legendary horde of gold that once belonged to the Afghan king, Ahmad Shah Durrani, that had been located and must be kept secret from the Russian invaders. Idries Shah's father, Ikbal Ali-Shah had himself endeavoured to locate this lost treasure, and Shah's son, Tahir later made a film about his own attempt to find it, titled Search for the Lost Treasure of Afghanistan. Reception Andrew Mole, reviewing Kara Kush in the Adelaide newspaper The Advertiser, found the book a good read, written from an interesting point of view. He agrees with Shah that the Soviets cannot win this war, explaining that this is because there was no centralised resistance at the time. \\"It is more a case of every man, woman and child having a go at every opportunity,\\" Mole writes. \\"Instead of fighting one enemy they are fighting endless enemies[,] and destroying one village or battle group does not have the slightest effect on the next.\\" This is something that most outsiders \\"gloss over\\", Mole says. Writing in the Los Angeles Times, novelist M.E. Hirsh states that the author \\"has brought all his skills to bear, blending considerable scholarship with raw experience, and passion with a Sufi's love of paradox. The result is a book as remarkable as the country it portrays, and she likens its structure to the classic The Canterbury Tales.\\" Though generally positive about the Kara Kush, Hirsh does point out what she perceives as three flaws in the work: Firstly, that Shah writes with the benefit of hindsight; that he simplifies and dismisses pressures that led up to the war and the Russian invasion. Secondly, that action scenes suffer due to Shah presenting too much information about the munitions involved. Thirdly, that individual characters are \\"dwarfed\\" due to the epic scale of the book. Finally, Hirsh concludes that \\"Kara Kush is not a story, it is the whole story ‚Äì magnificently written in the blood of a courageous people. The overwhelming sense, after reading Shah's great testament, is that their story matters. So precious a nation must not lose this war.\\" Kirkus Review is less complimentary about Kara Kush, opining that it is \\"a disjointed, sprawling, rather nonpoetic tome about the Russian invasion of Afghanistan.\\" The reviewer adds that Kara Kush is \\"wonderful on Afghan atmosphere, less successful as a novel\\", with too many characters and too little interplay between them, and concludes that the book is \\"a breezy read: impassioned, action-packed, and information-stuffed.\\" In The New York Times, author and retired columnist, C. L. Sulzberger expresses his difficulty as a reader in separating his literary judgement of the work, which he describes as \\"a bad novel\\", from the plight and \\"flamboyant heroism\\" of the Afghan people which the book presents. The reviewer goes on to say that Shah clearly knows his country, its dialects, and the tribal traditions well, and has gone to great lengths to make himself familiar with the struggles of the Afghan rebels, the mujahideen, in their fight against the Soviet Union's occupation forces and their allies in the Afghan Government, based in Kabul. He adds that there is plenty of \\"action and movement\\" in the novel, and that the work presents a \\"rich tapestry\\", but concludes that the language employed is not up to the task, and that although it may be \\"a compendium of Pathan tales suitable to the storyteller's bazaar at Peshawar [...] it is not a novel.\\" Writing for the Pakistani Dawn newspaper, Nasser Yousaf states that Kara Kush provides \\"a fulfilling reading into the Afghan history, culture, geography and ethnology as the writer takes his readers on a tour de force of the snow‚Äìcovered mountains, parched deserts, fecund vineyards and orchards, dense woods and dirt tracks of a country at war with a super power.\\" See also *The Idries Shah Foundation References External links * Official Idries Shah Foundation website Category:1986 novels Category:Novels set in Afghanistan Category:Afghan culture Category:Stein and Day books Category:Books by Idries Shah ","title":"Kara Kush"},{"id":"58636969","text":"Marie-Eve Proulx is a Canadian politician, who was elected to the National Assembly of Quebec in the 2018 provincial election.\\"Quebec 2018 election: Final results and winners by riding\\".

It is based on the novel The Stand-In by Steve Bloom, published by Carolrohda Lab in October 2017. The film stars Noah Centineo, Laura Marano, Camila Mendes, Odiseas Georgiadis and Matt Walsh. It was released on April 12, 2019, by Netflix.  Plot  Brooks Rattigan is a high school senior, with dreams of getting into Yale, while his father, Charlie wants him to go to the University of Connecticut, which offered Brooks a full scholarship. He works at a sub shop with his best friend, programmer Murph, but financing his college dreams proves troubling. Brooks seizes the opportunity to make some extra money by posing as the boyfriend of his classmate's wealthy cousin Celia Lieberman of Greenwich. He finds he has a knack for dating with his adaptable personality. He meets beautiful but snobby Shelby and makes it his goal to win her over. Celia lies to Shelby and tells her Brooks is from Darien rather than working class Bridgeport. He and Murph launch an app, selling himself as the plus-one for all occasions. After finding out that Celia has a crush on Franklin Volley, they set up a plan to fake break-up, in which each of them gets to be with Shelby and Franklin respectively. As business booms for Brooks, Murph feels neglected and cuts Brooks off. Celia sets up an interview for Brooks at Yale, and is upset when she finds out that he researched the Dean previously and lied to him in order to be liked. Brooks justifies it, saying that it is no different from what he has been doing with his app. Celia realizes that Franklin is not the person for her, however does not tell Brooks. When they conduct their fake break up, she is hurt by his words, and slaps him. Brooks is under the impression that it is all an act. Following the \\"break-up\\", Shelby kisses Brooks and asks him to accompany her to her school formal. The two find it difficult to relate to one another and struggle to hold a conversation. At the formal, Brooks sees Leah, a girl who had used his app to \\"practice dating.\\" She reveals all about Brooks' app to Shelby, who is offended and disgusted by the theme of Brooks' app. He reveals to Shelby that he is not from the wealthy town that she believes he is from, and that he needs the money to go to Yale. She calls him a liar and leaves. Brooks approaches Celia, who was also at the dance. She declines his offer to dance, and says that she is not a backup. He returns home and talks to his dad about what has been going on in his life. His dad reminds him that nobody truly knows who they are, and admits to Brooks that he is proud of who his son is becoming. Brooks decides to accept UConn's offer, because if he has to pretend to be somebody else to go to Yale, he does not want to go. Brooks makes up with Murph. He also meets up with Celia and writes a letter to her, where he reflects on how his previous ambitions were to drive the fanciest car, go to the nicest school, and date the prettiest girl. But he has revealed that these ambitions made him a bad friend, an ungrateful son, and a self-obsessed person. He writes that the times when he felt the most himself was when he was with Celia and wants to be with her. Celia visits Brooks at home and apologizes for slapping him. The two then go to the sub sandwich restaurant which has been retrofitted for a party, with Murph and Tuna Melt (Murph's crush and regular customer of the sub shop) in attendance. Murph reveals his admission to UConn and Brooks reconciles with Celia, sharing a kiss. The four then continue to dance until the end of the film.

Cross-appointed with the School of Optometry and Vision Science, she is known for the development of light activated treatments for eye disease and non-invasive imaging techniques for the detection of Alzheimer's disease through the identification of retinal amyloids. Career Campbell obtained a bachelor of science in chemical physics from the University of Toronto in 1975 and a master of science in physics from the University of Waterloo in 1977. She completed her PhD at the Australian National University in 1982 where she was the first female graduate student to study in the department of Applied Mathematics. Her PhD thesis, titled Gradient refractive index optics and image quality in the rat eye, was completed under the supervision of Austin Hughes, Colin Pask and Allan Snyder. Campbell is a professor of physics at the University of Waterloo where she is cross-appointed with the School of Optometry and Vision Science and is a member of the Waterloo Institute for Nanotechnology. Her career in physics began with the study of the optics of the eye. Over time her work has taken on an multidisciplinary approach, in which she blends physics and biology as a way to develop and improve disease diagnostics. In 2016, along with colleagues at the University of British Columbia, the University of Rochester, Massachusetts General Hospital, Vivocore Inc. and InterVivo Solutions, it was announced that Campbell had developed a method for detecting amyloid proteins in the eye, biomarkers associated with Alzheimer's disease, which may allow for the detection of the diseases prior to symptom presentation. Campbell explained in an interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation that: \\"The ability to detect amyloid deposits in the retina prior to disease symptoms may be an essential tool for the development of preventative strategies for Alzheimer's and other dementias.\\" The research team believes that the amyloids may appear in the eye after leaking from cerebrospinal fluid. Over the course of her career, Campbell has advocated for the rights of female researchers and has led by example in doing so. She was the first person to take maternity leave as a Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation postdoctoral fellow and as a Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council university research fellow. Campbell has served as the President of the Canadian Association of Physicists and is a fellow of the Optical Society and the American Physical Society.

In his student years, he attended the Augustinianum College, where he met Romano Prodi and Giovanni Maria Flick. Treu has always been close to the democratic-reformist wing of the Italian Socialist Party. In 1995 he was nominated Minister of Labour and Social Security in the Dini Cabinet. In 1996 he was elected Deputy as an exponent of Lamberto Dini's Italian Renewal and was confirmed at the head of the ministry in the Prodi I Cabinet, and then became Minister of Transports in the subsequent D'Alema I Cabinet.

It was built during 1818 by Charles Hook in and by Thomas and Samual Hassall, and Daniel Roberts in . The property is privately owned. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 22 December 2006.  History  The original owner of Denbigh was Charles Hook, who had been imprisoned by the rebel government for supporting Governor Bligh's attempt to control the military in New South Wales. Hook had suffered greatly over the previous events and was in his fifties when he received his grant in 1812 by Governor Macquarie. The grant consisted of in the Parish of Cook, located at Cobbitty between the Cowpasture Road and Bringelly Road (later Northern Road). During 1818, Hook and his wife stayed at nearby Macquarie Grove while their own house was being built. The construction of Denbigh house was completed and Hook began clearing the surrounding land for agricultural use. He died in 1826. In 1826 the property was growing wheat () and maize (). It was described as including \\"a large dwelling house and other convenient out-houses on the farm\\". Aborigines held \\"tribal rites\\" in the adjacent paddocks after the house was constructed. A dense grove of olives was planted west of the house pre-1826. A small vineyard was established on a hill to the north of the house pre-1826. A number of mud huts clustered around the main building, surrounded by a paling fence (all now vanished).Godden Mackay Logan, 2007, 27 The property was then purchased by parson Thomas Hassall who began extending the homestead in 1827.

Together with a wide extent of country, churches were clearly seen at nearby Camden, Narellan and Cobbitty.Hassall, Rev, James S. in \\"Old Australia, Records and Reminiscences from 1784\\", Brisbane, 1902 Convict labour was used on the property and Hassall had in his employment, \\"twelve to twenty men\\" managed by a Scottish overseer. In the Hassall days, Denbigh existed as a small scattered village with its own school master, blacksmith, carpenter, brickmaker and many others.Friends of the Royal Botanic Gardens, 2001 Hassall also employed local Aboriginal people to help burn off excess timber on the property to clear land for extensive farming activities. During this period, a corroboree was held on the Denbigh estate in which 400 Aboriginals took part. Hassall recalled witnessing numerous corroborrees on the property overlooking Cobbitty Creek.Godden Mackay Logan, 2012, 20 In 1828, Hassall financed the construction of Heber Chapel in Cobbitty which he built on his nearby grant in which Cobbitty Road ran through. Fifteen years earlier, Hassall had established the first Sunday School for children in Australia, which he ran from his parents' house in Parramatta. After 1826 when Hassall was the owner, the property was used to grow wheat and wool, and included vineyards and orchards. From the early 19th century a bakehouse, meat-room and cellar, laundry and store room were located on one side of the courtyard. Denbigh under Hassall included a resident school master, a carpenter, brick maker, blacksmith, shoemaker, dairyman, three gardeners, butler and coachman (including coach house). Denbigh under Hassall had between a dozen and 20 convicts assigned to the household. Denbigh later in the Hassall period was set in a garden of five acres, including an abundance of fruit trees. By 1845, tenant farmers were purchasing their own land. With fewer servants being employed at the property, combined with the lack of available labour, Denbigh homestead contracted back to a nucleus of farm buildings much like it was during 1820. In 1866 Charles McIntosh, a Scottish farmer, leased land at Denbigh which he purchased the following year, the year Thomas Hassall died. The property was used to breed Clydesdale horses. From 1910, Denbigh became a dairy farm and an Ayrshire cattle stud. Today, Denbigh is still owned by the McIntosh family and is used as a Hereford stud.Read, Stuart; pers.comm.  Description  =Farm= Paddocks The original land grant remains intact with substantial 19th century built fabric remaining. The (original Hook) entry gates to Denbigh are simple by design and the unsurfaced estate road leads through paddocks and groves of eucalypts. Many of the cultural and historic plantings remain on the property such as remnant mature eucalypts. Older plantings include an avenue of forest red gums (Eucalyptus tereticornis) to the north-east of the homestead garden along an earlier farm access path, reputedly planted by Charles Hassall. Two other cottages exist on the farm: Bangor closer to The Northern Road and the main entrance driveway, to the east of the Denbigh homestead complex, and Cluny, on Cluny Hill south-west of the homestead group. Cluny cottage was originally located to the north-east of the homestead complex on \\"Plantation Hill\\" - then known as Roberts' Cottage, before it was moved to its current location. A former quarry remains on the farm. An older driveway access from the Hassall era led south to Cobbitty Road and towards the village of Cobbitty. =Garden= Gardens A curving driveway leads through a second set of gates and an unkempt wilderness area of predominantly olive trees, shrubs and vines where it terminates in front of the house which has a highly maintained and formal garden (a common element of a 19th-century landscape design). This grove of olives was planted pre-1826 on the western side of the homestead for shade and shelter. Here the Hassall ladies walked in the afternoons. As well as the old carob tree (in 2009 a large dead stump but with a vigorous young shoot maturing) there is a kurrajong (Brachychiton populneum), Bunya Bunya pine (Araucaria bidwillii) and peppercorn trees (Schinus molle var. areira) in this area. Denbigh retains its cottage garden, simple in design with plants fashionable in the 19th century complementing its colonial atmosphere. Older plantings include roses, carob (Ceratonia siliqua), century plant (Agave americana) and its variegated form \\"Variegata\\", a Bunya Bunya pine (Araucaria bidwillii). Between the homestead and outbuildings stands a candelabra /cactus tree (Cereus peruvianus) a curious botanical specimen with large white trumpet flowers originated from South America and the only known example of its kind in the Camden Municipality. Many other species of trees remain on the property and are typical of 19th century plantings in the district. These include African and fruiting olives (Olea europaea var. africana and O. europaea), sweet gum (Liquidambar styraciflua), Cocos Island/Queen palm (Syragus romanzoffianum), ash (Fraxinus excelsior). A tennis court north-west of the homestead is almost hidden from view by lush climbers such as cat's claw creeper (Doxantha unguis-cati). A Canary Island date palm (Phoenix canariensis) north-east of the house was planted in 1948 to commemorate a marriage in the owners' family. The garden in summer is filled with the scent of old-fashioned roses - gallicas, bourbons, banksias, damasks, musks and rugosas and scented pelargoniums. Bushes of Rosa chinensis \\"Old Blush\\", a China rose are scattered through the garden. These were the first species of rose to be grown in the colony. The Mediterranean cypress (Cupressus sempervirens) on the eastern side of the garden was reputedly planted by Hassall and the Hassall girls once played croquet in this part of the garden. In the homestead's rear (kitchen) courtyard beside the old well and pump are bushes of Hibiscus mutabilis \\"Plena\\" (double, white-pink) and H.moschatus (single, white-pink). Sandstone gutters drain this paved courtyard towards the outbuildings to its south. A gate at the far northern end leads through the western wing of outbuildings to the shrubbery / wilderness to the west.Friends of the Royal Botanic Gardens, 2001 with additions from Stuart Read, visit of 29/9/2001 =Homestead Complex= Front elevation The homestead is sited in contrast with the surrounding open agricultural land and is complemented by the half circle of hills which define Denbigh's landscape character. In terms of elevation and character, the buildings and trees have been sited in a manner influenced by John Claudius Loudon, the Scottish writer on landscape taste. The house looks across the fields to the north to a line of hills where a small vineyard was established ('Plantation Hill'). It is here that, after a trip to Wollongong where he had been given seeds, Hassall planted some cabbage tree palms (Livistona australis) and others which he described as those of a \\"silver tree\\". The palms are gone today and were unusual in the district. NB: In 2001 Plantation Hill is bushy now - the cabbage palms are gone, although a \\"silver tree\\" does remain, suckering from its base). To the north-west and above an area of African olives was a clearing planted with a \\"native vineyard\\" of native vines, a botanical collection, which is of interest to the Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney.Ian McIntosh to Stuart Read, pers.comm., 29/9/2001 The house consists of timber framing, filled with brick or rubble nogging and covered in weatherboard. The hipped roof extends over the house and the brick paved verandah is supported on square timber posts with chamfered edges. The chimneys have a simple brick cornice with a distinct colonial character. Renovations can be evidenced by joinery typical of the 1830s. The whole structure is now rendered. =Outbuildings= Outbuildings In the Hassall days, Denbigh existed as a small scattered village with its own school master, blacksmith, carpenter, brickmaker and many others. Twelve to twenty assigned servants maintained the garden of orchards, vegetables, the vineyard and orange grove on the side of the hill. The present farm buildings are located conveniently near the house which include slab built sheds and an old barn with thick rubblestone walls. The barn still bears the engraved initials of Thomas Hassall cut into the timber architrave. A huge forest red gum (Eucalyptus tereticornis) is the centre piece to the farm buildings, coach house and stables block. Further east and uphill are a range of outbuildings, slab huts and sheds. = Condition = As at 14 January 2002, the Denbigh property is of archaeological potential to reveal evidence of both early European farming practices and Aboriginal occupation. A number of mud huts were clustered around the main homestead, surrounded by a paling fence (all now vanished). Denbigh is an intact farm estate within the Cumberland Plain and Camden region. The original 1812 land grant and the relationship of the homestead to important views also remains intact.Heritage Office draft. = Modifications and dates = *Charles Hook's original grant was . In 1826 he had of wheat and of maize here, a \\"large dwelling house and other convenient out-houses on the farm\\". A small vineyard was established on a hill to the north of the house pre-1826. A number of mud huts were clustered around the main homestead, surrounded by a paling fence (all now vanished). *1827-31: The original one storey house and outbuildings had major renovations undertaken by Rev. Hassall, adding a bedroom storey in 1827. Hassall added a southern entry drive connecting the property to Cobbitty Road (and the Heber Chapel and church). *Other service and farm buildings were built during renovations soon after the purchase of the property by Thomas Hassall, the number of which were reduced in the 1840s. *A former quarry remains on the farm. The former Roberts Cottage site and associated fences is to the homestead's north-east. This cottage was (date unknown) relocated to Cluny hill south-west of the homestead group and remains in use as a residence. Another cottage, Bangor lies to the east of the homestead group close to the estate road to The Northern Road. *1866+ use of farm to breed Clydesdale horses. *1910+ use as a dairy farm and Ayrshire cattle stud. *2009: use as a Hereford cattle stud.  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries As at 29 July 2003, Denbigh is of State significance as an intact example of a continuously functioning early farm complex (1817-1820s) on its original 1812 land grant. It contains a rare and remarkable group of homestead, early farm buildings and associated plantings with characteristics of the Loudon model of homestead siting within an intact rural landscape setting fundamental to its interpretation. The large collection of early farm buildings is perhaps the most extensive and intact within the Cumberland/Camden region. It has historic associations with pioneering Anglican minister Thomas Hassall and its relationship with the early Heber Chapel and the township of Cobbitty. The estate is significant as an early contact point between Aboriginal and European culture and is of social significance for the descendants of the Hassall and Macintosh families. It retains its historic views across the valley to Cobbitty in the west. The place is of scientific significance for its potential to reveal, through archaeology, evidence of both early European farming practices and aboriginal occupation. The significance of Denbigh is considerably enhanced by the extent to which it has retained its form, character, fabric and rural setting (Heritage Office). The Denbigh estate is of exceptional cultural significance for its historical, aesthetic, social and technical values. The homestead and attendant farm buildings are an exceptionally rare and intact group of structures dating from the very early 19th century. They demonstrate the aspirations of, and continuous occupation by only 3 families as well as the continuous evolution of their farming and grazing practices over this period. The extant structures, intact pastoral landscape, associated family and public records archives, all combine to make this a very rare and important place in the history and evolution of NSW. This is strengthened by the survival of significant physical and historic links with the surrounding early roads and settlements as well as significant buildings and structures built by the Hassall family, the second family to own the estate. It is one of several important colonial estates in the local area including Maryland, Wivenhoe, Brownlow Hill and Raby. The establishment of the Denbigh farm by Charles Hook (1809-1826), its subsequent ownership and development by the famous \\"galloping parson\\" Thomas Hassall (1826-1886), and then by the MacIntosh family to the present time, connects the place with very important figures in the development of this area of NSW. The physical evidence of Aboriginal occupation of the estate, both prior to and after European arrival backed up by documented evidence of this including ceremonial use, strengthens the integrity and rarity of the continuous physical record of the place. Important named historical Aboriginal figures such as Cannbaygal, a visiting chief from the mountains, are associated with the Denbigh farm, and possibly also Cogy (Cogrewoy) a leader of the \\"Cowpastures\\" Tribe who also acted as guide through the district to Macquarie and Barrallier. The fact that the landscape remains as undeveloped agricultural /pastoral land, retains the sense, both physically and visually of this connection with all of these periods and occupations. The Denbigh farm estate retains a curtilage and setting of exceptional historic and aesthetic significance. Unlike most of its early colonial contemporaries in the Cumberland Plain, it retains this curtilage and setting in a largely uncompromised state, and thus its integrity, from the time of early European occupation. The landscape and setting of the homestead and outbuildings and the views to and from these, provide a very rare and intact early colonial landscape of great beauty and integrity and of exceptional cultural significance to the state of NSW. The Denbigh estate contains areas of varying significance in relation to their role in the curtilage of the place.Design 5, 2004, 37 Denbigh was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 22 December 2006 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Denbigh is of historical significance on a state level as an intact example of continuously functioning early farm complex on its original 1812 land grant.Heritage Office draft The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Denbigh has significance for its association with pioneering Anglican minister Thomas Hassall and its relationship with the early Heber Chapel and township of Cobbitty. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Denbigh has aesthetic significance as a remarkable group of early farm buildings with associated plantings including the avenue of forest red gums (Eucalyptus tereticornis) established by Thomas Hassall. The large collection of early farm buildings retains its scattered village atmosphere and is an extensively intact farm estate on the Cumberland Plain. Adjoining landscapes continue the sense of historic rural character. Denbigh's landscape is identified in the Camden Significant Tree and Vegetated Landscape Study and the Colonial Landscapes of the Cumberland Plain and Camden study for the National Trust of Australia. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Denbigh has social significance as an early contact point between Aboriginal people and European's. It also has social significance for the descendants of the Hassall and Macintosh families and has demonstrated its popularity as a venue for select tourist groups. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Denbigh has scientific significance in regards to Aboriginal occupation and can demonstrate the theory and practice of colonial landscape design and farming practices. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Denbigh is a rare example of an intact colonial farm complex and homestead. The property has continuously functioned as a farm since 1817 and is located on its original grant area. Denbigh is rare as a farming estate with characteristics of the Loudon model of homestead siting. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Denbigh is representative of early farming practices and an example of typical 19th century landscape design.

Life The date and place of Richard Pue's birth is unknown. He established Dick's Coffee House, Skinner's Row, Dublin sometime before July 1698. Pue became a freeman of Dublin in 1701 as a member of the Dyers' Guild. On 25 December 1703 he began publishing Impartial Occurrences with Edward Lloyd. This paper was delivered by post across the country, with Pue acting as editor until 1706. The paper ceased in February 1706, reappearing in February 1712 as Pue's . In late December 1705, Lloyd and Pue jointly published a satirical attack on protestant dissent by Jonathan Swift called A tale of a tub. They also printed the Votes of the Irish house of commons (nos 1-65) between July and October 1707 and May and June 1709. Owing to Pue's political leanings, Dick's was a centre for residual protestant Jacobite interest in Dublin, with Robert Rochfort and his allies frequenting the coffeehouse. Pue increasingly became a Tory, and became increasingly intolerant of Jacobite opinion, informing Dublin Castle of \\"papist murmuring\\" in 1707 and Jacobite activities in Dick's. From 1710, he published or republished Tory pamphlets on topics such as the trial of Henry Sacheverell in London. In 1714 after the accession of the Hanoverian monarchy, Pue suffered for his earlier Tory support, being imprisoned briefly by the Irish house of commons in February 1715. This was part of an overall purge of Dublin's Tory press, with Pue being taken in custody again in November 1717. He left Ireland for a time, returning in late December, publishing Pue's Occurences again on 4 January 1718. He held a number of auctions from Dick's from the 1720s, as well as selling \\"eye water\\" and other health elixirs. Pue was a successful printer who was not sworn into the Printers‚Äô Guild. Pue died in early 1722, and was buried at the church of Church of St. Nicholas Within, Dublin on 10 May 1722. His wife Elizabeth took over his businesses after his death, and in turn was succeeded by their son Richard.

Etymology It is noted that the old men living in Pokot during the early 20th century were unanimous in declaring that; Territory Their territory was \\"on the Elgeyo Escarpment\\" and while they lived on the Elgeyo escarpment the Kerio Valley was occupied by the Sambur. \\"..If ever the Suk descended from their fastness, they were raided and harried by this tribe\\".Beech M.W.H, The Suk - Their Language and Folklore. The Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1911, p.7 Way of life =Residence= Von H√∂nnel writing following his journey to Lake Turkana, remarked on the residences of the Suk, using much the same terms that other writers would make use of; =Agriculture= Beech (1911) noted that the Chok were a \\"purely agricultural people, cultivating millet and eleusine grain grown in the cold air of the summit and possibly a little tobacco.\\"Beech M.W.H, The Suk - Their Language and Folklore. The Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1911 p.4 The \\"millet [was] grown on the fertile and well watered flats at the base of the Elgeyo escarpment, and [was] watered by means of irrigation, while eleusine grain (was) grown high upon the hill sides and was dependent on rain\\". The irrigation system as Beech noted, \\"is most ingenious, and its original construction must have required a vast amount of toil and patience\\".Beech M.W.H, The Suk - Their Language and Folklore. The Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1911 p.15 MacDonald who came across an agricultural 'Suk' village during the last decade of the nineteenth century described a similar subsistence pattern. This way of life was captured in family traditions of a Pokot man named Dounguria. =Industries= The Chok had two notable industries, pottery and iron-smithing, the former performed by women and the latter by men.Beech M.W.H, The Suk - Their Language and Folklore. The Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1911 p.17 The significance of the Chok smithing industry is illustrated in a tradition captured among the Nandi in the early 20th century. There the Uasin Gishu smiths said in regard to their ancestors arrival in Nandi; that a man named Arap Sutek had been the only smith in the country then but that after the Uasin Gishu Maasai quit their homes and split up in different directions, some of those who wandered into Nandi were hospitably received by Arap Sutek and by the early 20th century every clan had a smith. There was also a sword in use among the Nandi by then known as rotuet-ap-chok (sword of/from Chok) which was being manufactured alongside the previous rotuet that had been made in Nandi.Hollis A.C, The Nandi - Their Language and Folklore. The Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1909, p.33 It is possible though not clear that the Chok had exported these weapons prior to this time. =Trade= The Chok obtained donkeys from the Turkana and it would appear they took a number with them to Nandi but were obliged to get rid of them as it was felt that they would spoil the grazing for cattle.Hollis A.C, The Nandi - Their Language and Folklore. The Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1909 p.22 Culture The most noted item of their culture was the Chok from which they got their name. Beech notes that as of 1911 it was only women he saw carrying these swords \\"...on their way to the grain fields\\".Beech M.W.H, The Suk - Their Language and Folklore. The Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1911, p.1 =Marriage= A custom unique to the Chok was the payment of dowry in palm wine or honey.Beech M.W.H, The Suk - Their Language and Folklore. The Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1911, p.32 External relations =Loikop people= Samburu traditions describe their relationship with the Pokot as one of inter- ethnic lang'ata i.e. a close yet circumspect bond best perceived as a friendship born as a resolution to past conflict. The Samburu place the oath beyond living memory, and with many knowledgeable Samburu informants giving detailed oral history going back to at least the 1880s it is likely that this relationship was established with the Chok. Certain traditions state that the oath was renewed around the time when the Merisho age-set were murran (in the early 1900s) indicating a renewal of the oath following the assimilation of the Chok into Pokot identity.Holtzman, J., Killing Your Neighbors: Friendship and Violence in Northern Kenya and Beyond, p.134-135 Decline The Chok were raided by the Laikipia Masai forcing some of them to flee to Kapukogh in Uganda.Beech M.W.H, The Suk - Their Language and Folklore. The Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1911, p.4 Dispersal =Uasin Gishu Maasai= The Nandi smiths narrative identifies their ancestors who arrived from the Uasin Gishu plateau with a sword known as rotuet-ap-chok (sword of/from Chok) as the Uasin Gishu Maasai. Similarly immigrants from their neighboring community (i.e. the Sekker mentioned by the Pokot elders) were known as the Segelai Maasai.Spear, T. and Waller, R. Being Maasai: Ethnicity & Identity in East Africa. James Currey Publishers, 1993, p. 91 Assimilation & Expansion Chok traditions recall their territorial expansion under their new identity, they remember that a time came when \\"... there arose a wizard among the Suk who prepared a charm in the form of a stick, which he placed in the Loikop cattle kraals, with the result that they all died.\\" After defeating the Loikop, a settlement was established at En-ginyang (about 48 kilometers north of Lake Baringo), likely by a group of Pokotozek.Beech M.W.H, The Suk - Their Language and Folklore. The Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1911, p.xiiHorrobin, D., A Guide to Kenya and Northern Tanzania, Springer Science & Business Media, p. 33 online This event signified the establishment of the pastoral Chok, i.e. Pokot, community. With the Pokot community established, a desire arose many Chok to adopt pastoralist culture. The aim and ambition of every agricultural Chok became to amass enough cattle to move into the Kerio Valley and join their pastoral kin. They achieved this through attaining cattle as the bride-price of their female relations or through adoption, in the latter case, poor Chok youth would be adopted by members of the emerging Pokot community primarily as herds-boys.Barton, J., Notes on the Suk Tribe of Kenia Colony, The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland Vol. 51 (Jan. - Jun., 1921), pp. 82-99 online By the early 20th century, the Pokot community was expanding as many of the Chok joined their rank and by that time, many Pokot who were termed Suk by the colonial administrators did not recognize this name for their tribe.

With premises at Welbeck Works, Willesden Lane, London NW6, Grosvenor gained a reputation in the years up to World War I for high quality coachwork on leading makes of car including Rolls-Royce. During World War I they made ambulance bodies. By 1920 they had joined up with Shaw & Kilburn who were the main Vauxhall dealer in London and although they still supplied coachwork on other chassis their main customer was from then onwards Vauxhall. From the late 1920s Grosvenor became responsible for building most if not all or Vauxhall's specialist bodies and in 1929 were responsible for the Hurlingham and Melton bodies on the Vauxhall 20-60. From 1932 it seems they only built for Vauxhall, effectively becoming their in-house coachbuilder. All luxury coachbuilding stopped in World War II. This was not the end for Grosvenor as in 1954 they were advertising a 10-passenger bus and also a pick-up conversion of a Bedford van.

It is endemic to Kenya and only know from the vicinity of its type locality, Ngaia Forest Reserve, in the Nyambene Hills, Meru County; the type locality is also spelled \\"Ngaya\\" or \\"Ngaja\\". The specific name spawlsi honours Stephen Spawls who first collected this species and who has contributed substantially to African herpetology. Common name Spawls' boolee has been coined for it. Discovery and taxonomy The first specimen was collected in the Nyambene Hills in 2007 and was considered most similar to Boulengerula denhardti. Additional specimens were found in 2008 and tentatively identified as Boulengerula denhardti. However, closer examination of these specimens, new specimens from the Nyambene Hills, and comparative material from museums revealed that these specimens represented a new species, which was formally described in 2017. Description Adult males measure and adult females in total length. The eyes are not visible. The snout projects strongly beyond the recessed mouth. The body has 150 to 157 annular grooves and is subcylindrical, slightly dorsoventrally flattened. The maximum midbody width is . Dorsal colouration is slightly purplish blue. The flanks and the ventral side are slightly paler. The head and the throat are pinkish. The tip of the snout is pale. The annular grooves are whitish. Habitat and conservation Boulengerula spawlsi is known from the Ngaia Forest Reserve at elevations of above sea level. Specimens have been dug from soil in a hollowed-out base of the trunk of a large fallen tree, under stones and rotting logs, or found in leaf-litter debris. It appears to be uncommon or at least difficult to find. Whether it occurs outside the forest is unknown. Collection of logs for firewood could threaten the species.

Congress clearly treated refugees (i.e., established victims of persecution who have absolutely no safe country) differently than all other aliens (who do have a safe country and are not victims of persecution).

Under controlling precedent from our court and the BIA's recent decision in Matter of J‚ÄìH‚ÄìJ‚Äì, he is correct.\\") (emphasis added). If Congress wanted to treat refugees the same as all other aliens, it would have repealed ¬ß¬ß 1157(c)(3) and 1159(c) instead of amending them in 1996 and then in 2005. This clearly demonstrates that it intentionally made available a statutory and mandatory legal remedy to refugees. Under the well known Chevron doctrine, \\"[i]f the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter, for the court as well as the [Attorney General] must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.\\"Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842-43 (1984). It is also crucial to take notice that the penultimate provision of ¬ß 1182(h), where it repeatedly mentions the phrase under this subsection, obviously does not apply to any Afghan-American requesting relief under ¬ß¬ß 1157(c)(3) and 1159(c), or under the United Nations Convention against Torture (CAT).Tima v. Attorney General of the U.S., ___ F.3d ___, ___, No. 16-4199, p.8 (3d Cir. Sept. 6, 2018) (\\"Congressional drafting manuals instruct drafters to break statutory sections down into subsections, paragraphs, subparagraphs, clauses, and subclauses.\\"). In other words, that commanding concluding statement of ¬ß 1182(h) only applies to aliens who were admitted to the United States as lawful permanent residents in accordance with Form I-130, Form I-140, Diversity Immigrant Visa, etc. The Afghan-Americans who were admitted as refugees in the 1980s are still refugees under the INA and international law because (1) they continue to be victims of persecution and (2) they have absolutely no safe country of permanent residence. This means that any such Afghan-American who has been convicted of any offense mentioned in ¬ß 1101(a)(43)(A) is not (and has never been) precluded from relief under ¬ß¬ß 1157(c)(3) and 1159(c) or the CAT. It has long been understood in the United States that whenever \\"Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\\"United States v. Wong Kim Bo, 472 F.2d 720, 722 (5th Cir. 1972); see also United States v. Wooten, 688 F.2d 941, 950 (4th Cir. 1982). The above provisions are in clear harmony with each other and the overall law of the United States, including with international law. Secondly, providing relief under ¬ß¬ß 1157(c)(3) and 1159(c) or the CAT is not discretionary but statutory and mandatory, and the above provisions all involve \\"legal claims\\" (i.e., constitutional claims or questions of law). As such, federal judges are fully empowered to review these \\"legal claims\\" at any time, especially in a case involving exceptional circumstances. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit recently reaffirmed this by stating the following: =Expansion of the definition of \\"nationals but not citizens of the United States\\"= In 1986, less than a year before the CAT became effective, Congress expressly and intentionally expanded the definition of \\"nationals but not citizens of the United States\\" by adding paragraph (4) to 8 U.S.C. ¬ß 1408, which plainly states that: The natural reading of ¬ß 1408(4) demonstrates that it was not exclusively written for the 55,000 American Samoans but also for Afghan- Americans who statutorily and manifestly qualify as \\"nationals but not citizens of the United States.\\" (Congress explaining that lawful permanent residents may lawfully remain outside the United States for one year (or even longer) in certain situations). This means that any Afghan-American who can show by a preponderance of the evidence that he or she meets (or at any time has met) the requirements of 8 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß 1408(4) and 1436 is plainly and unambiguously a \\"national but not a citizen of the United States.\\"Ricketts v. Att'y Gen., 897 F.3d 491 (3d Cir. 2018) (\\"When an alien faces removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act, one potential defense is that the alien is not an alien at all but is actually a national of the United States.\\"); Mohammadi v.

Supp. 145 (W.D. Pa. 1963). Such person must never be labelled or treated as an alien, especially after demonstrating that he or she has continuously resided in the United States for at least 10 years without committing (in such 10 years) any offense that triggers removability. \\"Deprivation of [nationality]‚Äîparticularly American [nationality], which is one of the most valuable rights in the world today‚Äîhas grave practical consequences.\\"Kennedy v.

United States, 567 U.S. 387, 395 (2012) (\\"Perceived mistreatment of aliens in the United States may lead to harmful reciprocal treatment of American citizens abroad.\\"). =Introduction and amendment of the term \\"aggravated felony\\"= In 1988, Congress introduced the term \\"aggravated felony\\" by defining it under 8 U.S.C. ¬ß 1101(a). Its definition was amended over the years. As of September 30, 1996, an \\"aggravated felony\\" only applies to convictions \\"for which the term of imprisonment was completed within the previous 15 years.\\" (\\" _The term [aggravated felony] applies to an offense described in this paragraph_ whether in violation of Federal or State law and applies to such an offense in violation of the law of a foreign country _for which the term of imprisonment was completed within the previous 15 years_.\\") (emphasis added); Matter of Vasquez-Muniz, 23 I&N; Dec. 207, 211 (BIA 2002) (en banc) (\\"This penultimate sentence, governing the enumeration of crimes in section 101(a)(43) of the Act, refers the reader to all of the crimes 'described in' the aggravated felony provision.\\"); Luna Torres v.

This definition is applicable to any proceeding, application, custody determination, or adjudication pending on or _after September 30, 1996_ , but shall apply under section 276(b) of the Act only to violations of section 276(a) of the Act occurring on or after that date.\\") (emphasis added).Zivkovic v.

Holder, 593 F.3d 638, 640-42 (7th Cir. 2010) (good example of absurdity and violation of the U.S. Constitution).Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337, 341 (1997) (\\"The plainness or ambiguity of statutory language is determined by reference to the language itself, the specific context in which that language is used, and the broader context of the statute as a whole.\\"); see also Matter of Dougless, 26 I&N; Dec. 197, 199 (BIA 2013) (\\"The [Supreme] Court has also emphasized that the Chevron principle of deference must be applied to an agency‚Äôs interpretation of ambiguous statutory provisions, even where a court has previously issued a contrary decision and believes that its construction is the better one, provided that the agency's interpretation is reasonable.\\"). After the elapse of such \\"15 years\\" and avoidance of another aggravated felony conviction, a lawful permanent resident (LPR) automatically becomes eligible for both cancellation of removal and a waiver of inadmissibility. He or she may (at any time) request these immigration benefits depending on whichever is more applicable or easiest to obtain.Salmoran v. Attorney General of the U.S., ___ F.3d ___, ___, No. 17-2683, p.5 n.5 (3d Cir. Nov. 26, 2018) (case involving cancellation of removal after the LPR has been physically removed from the United States on a bogus aggravated felony charge). A suspended sentence counts as \\"term of imprisonment\\" and must be added to the above 15 years passing of time,Matter of Cota, 23 I&N; Dec. 849, 852 (BIA 2005). and it makes no difference if the aggravated felony was committed in Afghanistan, American Samoa, Australia, Canada, Mexico, the United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States, or in any other country or place in the world. =Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act= permanent resident card (green card), which lawfully permits its holder to live and work in the United States similar to that of all other Americans. Before any legal immigrant is naturalized as a U.S. citizen, he or she must be a green card holder for at least 5 years and satisfy all other U.S. citizenship requirements. Many green card holders are actually Americans without them knowing, and are thus not removable from the United States. In February 1995, U.S. President Bill Clinton had issued an important directive in which he expressly stated the following: On April 1, 1997, the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) took effect,Othi v. Holder, 734 F.3d 259, 264-65 (4th Cir. 2013) (\\"In 1996, Congress 'made major changes to immigration law' via IIRIRA.... These IIRIRA changes became effective on April 1, 1997.\\"). which is particularly aimed at combating illegal immigration to the United States. But despite what President Clinton said in the above directive, some plainly incompetent immigration officers began deporting firmly-settled legal immigrants (i.e., potential Americans). These people have permanent resident cards, Social Security numbers, driver's licenses, state ID cards, bank accounts, credit cards, insurances, etc. They own homes, businesses, cars and other properties in the United States under their names. Such people statutorily qualify as \\"nationals of the United States\\" after continuously residing in the United States for at least 10 years without committing (in such 10 years) any offense that triggers removability. This appears to be the reason why the permanent resident card (green card) is valid for 10 years. It was expected that all Afghan-Americans would obtain U.S. citizenship within 10 years from the date of their first lawful entry, but if that was unachievable then they would statutorily become \\"nationals but not citizens of the United States\\" after the successful elapse of such 10 years. Anything to the contrary will lead to \\"deprivation of rights under color of law,\\" which is a federal crime that entails capital punishment for the perpetrator(s). (emphasis added).; United States v. Lanier, 520 U.S. 259, 264 (1997) (\\"Section 242 is a Reconstruction Era civil rights statute making it criminal to act (1) 'willfully' and (2) under color of law (3) to deprive a person of rights protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States.\\"); United States v. Acosta, 470 F.3d 132, 136 (2d Cir. 2006) (holding that 18 U.S.C. ¬ß¬ß 241 and 242 are \\"crimes of violence\\"); see also et seq.; Rodriguez v. Swartz, 899 F.3d 719 (9th Cir. 2018) (\\"A U.S. Border Patrol agent standing on American soil shot and killed a teenage Mexican citizen who was walking down a street in Mexico.\\"); Ziglar v. Abbasi, (mistreating immigration detainees); Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 736-37 (2002) (mistreating prisoners). (\\"War crimes\\"). (emphasis added). (emphasis added). The Afghan- Americans in removal proceedings have already \\"been lawfully accorded the privilege of residing permanently in the United States\\" by the Attorney General, (\\"The term 'lawfully admitted for permanent residence' means the status of having been lawfully accorded the privilege of residing permanently in the United States as an immigrant ....\\"); see also (defining the term \\"immigrant\\"). but decades later the incompetent immigration officials unconstitutionally turned these firmly resettled Americans into refugees again. Unlike other aliens in removal proceedings, these refugees have no safe country and they obviously owe permanent allegiance solely to the United States. They have never pledged any kind of allegiance to the communist PDPA government, which dissolved in April 1992, nor to the Taliban or the other Afghan governments. This makes them nothing but a distinct class of persecuted Americans. The ones who cannot become U.S. citizens are statutorily allowed by Congress to live in the United States with their American families for the rest of their life. Deporting such Americans shocks the conscience of every ordinary judge because doing such is plainly a grave international crime.Edwards v. Sessions, No. 17-87, p.3 (2d Cir. Aug. 24, 2018) (\\"In removal proceedings involving an LPR, the government bears the burden of proof, which it must meet by adducing clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence that the facts alleged as grounds for deportation are true.\\") (internal quotation marks omitted) (summary order); accord (a); ; Mondaca-Vega v.

Barry (20 August 1879 - 23 May 1969) was an Irish sportsman and revolutionary figure. He was a leading hurler and Gaelic footballer in the early 20th century and was the last-surviving member of the London-Irish team that won the All-Ireland Championship in 1901. Biography Raised near Glanworth, County Cork, Barry was one of fifteen children born to Timothy Barry, a farmer, and his wife Hannah. He was educated by the Christian Brothers in Fermoy before emigrating to London in 1895 where he was an apprentice in the furniture trade. Barry joined a number of Irish nationalist groups in London, including the Irish Republican Brotherhood. Already a promising hurler and Gaelic footballer before his emigration, he joined the Hibernians club and was later selected for the London-Irish teams as a dual player. On 2 August 1903, Barry won an All-Ireland Championship medal after London's 1-05 to 0-04 defeat of Cork in the All-Ireland final at Jones' Road. It remains the only time in the history of the championship that the title was taken overseas. Two years after returning to Cork in 1911, Barry joined the Irish Volunteers and was later elected to its executive committee. He was also the president of the Cork Young Ireland Society. During the 1916 Easter Rising, Barry was one of a large group of Cork Volunteers that marched to Macroom in anticipation of a widespread rebellion, only to find that the order for mobilisation had been countermanded. Barry spent his final years as managing director of his own auctioneering firm. He died in Cork on 23 May 1969.

It was designed and built from 1815 to 1834. It is also known as Orielton Farm and Orielton Homestead. The property is privately owned. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 22 December 2006.  History  =Indigenous history= =Early Colonial history= Edward Lord was granted in the Parish of Narellan that he then named Orielton Park in about 1815. He established a Tasmanian property and this Camden (Cowpastures) property from 1814. His principal residence was in Tasmania. Initial occupation at Camden/Narellan probably included siting a shelter to take in the sublime prospect afforded by the current location of the house. Timber-getting for fuel and fencing and clearing of land for cropping were establishment processes of this time. The initial landscape was probably open forest with grass understorey. Lord's grant included extensive alluvial flats along Narellan Creek and these were probably soon put to cultivation for cereal and hay production.Tropman & Tropman, 2015, 26 Orielton was used from 1822-1841 as an outstation by John Dickson. James Dickson (John's brother) lived at Nonorrah (now Maryland) to the north and managed both properties. Agricultural use of Orielton from the 1828 census showed cattle and sheep stocked on Dickson's properties and he cultivated land for cropping, growing cereal (wheat and barley) for milling in his mills. Dickson would probably have sited (probably the confirmed (later) house site) the main residence (manager's house) to provide an outlook and surveillance over the estate. He was using Orielton for cereal production and dairy cheese-making and built barns and operated threshing and winnowing machinery. The Australian Auction Company described Orielton estate as having a substantial built brick cottage, commodious stabling, an excellent built barn with two floors, containing therein 8 horse-power threshing and winnowing machine'.Cable, Notes of the history of Orielton. This was probably built . In 1834, fifty men were working on the farm at Orielton - there would have been extensive quarters. The steam mill (three storeys high) was constructed in this period, possibly by Dickson, but most likely by the trustees.Thomas Barker. In 1834 Orielton was noted in letters written by David Waugh as being a productive farm. By 1835, of Orielton estate was amalgamated with the neighbouring Wivenhoe. In 1847 it was purchased by Camden miller, John Perry who had been using its mill and occupying Orielton before purchase. Perry was growing cereals and milling them for flour. Agriculture continued with cereal crops and livestock grazing. Perry later subdivided a portion of the estate and leased the main property to Charles Thompson, Clerk of the Bench to Camden Court. During the whole of this early period the estate seems to have been used mainly for grazing, with some limited agriculture. =Ownership, 1861 to 1876= In 1861 William Peisley, a carcass butcher bought Orielton. From 1861 until 1864 when Peisley put it up for auction and it was bought by (Sydney) absentee owner, \\"gentleman\\" John Thomas Neile. Neile bought the estate in two parcels - the Home Farm (in 1864, of ), in cultivation; and a second farm on the other (eastern) side of the \\"Great South\\" (now The Northern) Road, of with a farm house and stockyard. The Mill (recently built by previous owner Perry, the miller \\"on the best position in the district\\" and in of paddocks, was passed in at auction. Neile then bought it for A¬£600 - a knock-down price for so elaborate a structure. He maintained the whole property as a going concern until 1876. It featured extensive cleared and fenced paddocks, paling-fenced orchard and picking garden adjacent to the west side of the house, extensive buildings/quarters set on a knoll above the alluvial flats and below the ridge line, extensive trees and shrubs to the east or front entry, probably cypress, Bunya or hoop pines and other broad-canopied trees, a three-storey mill, livestock shelters and paddocks, ploughed paddocks and a cottage fronting the Northern Road's eastern side farm. In 1863 Abraham Davy of Harrington Park purchased Lot 1 of Orielton Farm () from three Sydney businessmen who had earlier purchased the estate - John Lait of Sydney, James Ryan of Emu Plains and James Jones of Sydney. An auction notice in 1864 describes Orielton's extensive development. It was sold to Neile, who bought a major homestead with infrastructure. A (likely 1865) photograph from the summit of the hill to the west, shows a well-kept farm complex in an ordered estate. The Peisley family came to be regarded as local gentry and some family members remained prominent in the district after they left Orielton in 1876. People came to Orielton from Sydney, using the train to Campbelltown to shoot over Orielton's land and attend the adjacent Harrington Park race track. The Peisley family knew the Davy family who occupied Harrington Park from 1852-70.Tropman & Tropman, 2015, 26-7 During the early 1870s the sport of coursing (the pursuit of live hares by greyhounds across the countryside) was introduced to Orielton which became a popular activity at both the Orielton and Harrington Park estates. By the 1870s Harrington Park house had established a reputation as a gentleman's country seat, with \\"hospitality, picturesqueness and the hunt bringing interesting associations to the English eye\\". In 1874, Harrington Park and Lot 1 of Orielton was purchased by William Rudd Snr, a grazier of Houtong Station in the Lower Murrumbidgee who also then owned neighbouring Harrington Park. Rudd changed the perceptions of Orielton and Harrington Park as a \\"gentleman's seat\\" to that of a graziers property. He also gained control of the remaining parts of Orielton estate. Harrington Park and Orielton remained within the Rudd and Britton (descendant) families until 1933 when (with the Great Depression having an impact) they were sold to Arthur and Elaine Swan. =Ownership, 1876 to 1943= Mrs Harriet Beard, widow of Wynyard Square, Sydney bought and occupied Orielton in 1876 when the Rudds were living at Harrington Park and both were responsible for developing the properties in the Victorian period building design and garden or landscape schemes. The Beard family became involved in district affairs and were esteemed as gentry. The Beards changed and developed the homestead extensively to relate to the southern prospect and expansive views to Studley Park and the floodplain of Narellan Creek. At one stage, a small school was conducted at Orielton. WIth the shift to grazing, the great barn would have lost its original function.Tropman & Tropman, 2015, 78 The existing access and arrival drives date to this era, as does the terracing south of the house and its extension and reorientation to the south, with two-storey Victorian Italianate style southern facade. Harriet appears to have made Orielton a large residential villa, making many garden plantings including Bunya pines, hoop pines, funeral cypress, Moreton Bay fig, maritime pine, Austrian pine, privet (hedges), photinia (hedges) and European olives to the orchard's northern boundary. These plantings probably reflect Victorian era symbolism relating to her loss of a husband, and some may relate to her own death in 1910.Tropman & Tropman, 2015, 27 The estate was held in trust until it sold in 1912 to Frederick Walker (solicitor), Henry Webster (Bank Manager) and John Morton (physician) as joint tenants and was leased to Ephraim Cross, a Narellan storekeeper. Cross' family had been Camden brickmakers (making bricks for Studley Park and Camelot), and later bought the property. The 1912 sale was of approximately , of which were cleared, balanced and ring-barked, subdivided into paddocks and well-grassed and watered from the creek with five dams. The property was described as having \\"extensive stabling and carriage room, milking shed, barns, vegetable gardens etc, etc. Brick barn (100\\" x 40') of 3 floors, engine house, saw bench, pumping plant, windmill, workshop, two cottages'. Cross sold the section east of The Northern Road to Harrington Park in 1926 and the remainder (including the houe) to Yvonne Coleman in 1927. The northern farm building was lost in a fire in 1928. It was considered by the local community to be where Cross operated a spirits distillery. Coleman sold it in 1930 to William Bernard Pilling of Rushcutters' Bay, builder and investor, who in turn sold it in 1931 to William Henry Trautwein, of Sydney, manager, through Union Investments. The property then returned to Pilling's ownership. The Pilling family in 1930 had Orielton run by estate managers with its homestead being maintained as a country residence for the family to visit. Daughter Eileen Pilling described her father as not a farmer but that he had bought at Narellan which included Orielton estate. He ran 100 cows on the southern end of it, where timber bales with galvanised iron rooves housed the cows. The family lived in Elizabeth Bay. She would visit on school holidays and remembers the ornate iron verandah, bullnose bay, French doors onto the verandah with vistas to Narellan. She recalls the long drive lined with trees and at the entry to the house a carriage loop circled close to the garden, within which a large aviary was located with many colourful birds. Towards the front of the house was a tennis court (east of the carriage loop) and stone steps led to the Italianate facade through splendid gardens. An orchard west of the homestead was filled with nuts and fruit, including walnuts and almonds. A ballroom was located underneath the house.Tropman & Tropman, 2015, 29 By 1938 the Swans had purchased all the remaining parts of Orielton, and managed the two farms (with Harrington Park) as a single entity. The Swans upgraded the sections of Orielton's farm buildings and then allowed the Department of Defence to make the homestead liveable for their occupation, from 1942-43.Tropman & Tropman;, 2015, 29 During World War II the Camden district was the scene of much military activity, and Orielton was occupied by the army for training and residential purposes. =Post World War II= Since 1944 Orielton has been owned by the Fairfax family who also own neighbouring Harrington Park. The Fairfax family resided at Harrington Park and Orielton was managed as part of the Harrington Park estate. Orielton was important in Sir Warwick Oswald Fairfax's pursuit of breeding Stud Hereford cattle. The yarding, sheds and paddocks were modified to cater for the extensive breeding program he undertook. He set Orielton up as his holding and breeding centre for Harrington Park Poll Hereford stud. Fencing, paddocks and shelters were established to raise and manage stud livestock.Tropman &Tropman;, 2015, 32 The steam mill appears to have been pulled down during this initial period of occupation. During this period, the property was an outstation with tenants occupying Orielton house. A dam visible in a 1947 aerial photograph south-west of the homestead was expanded by Fairfax , across the western boundary of the former picking garden and orchard. In the 1960s Warwick Fairfax was knighted, Orielton's windows were boarded up and some parts of the estate were used for goat farming.Tropman & Tropman, 2015, 83 Realignment of The Northern Road to the east in the 1970s including a new bridge over Narellan Creek east of the previous one, led to the cutting off of Orielton's (south-eastern-running) main drive (towards Narellan Creek). A new extension was added, making the drive a \\"V\\" shape and joining the Northern road further north, roughly in line but to the east of the main homestead and farm management complex.Stuart Read, from 1978 aerial photograph in Tropman & Tropman, 2015, 38 The subdivision of Harrington Park in the 1990s for urban development has visually encroached upon Orielton estate, with suburb abutting The Northern Road alongside it and Kirkham Lane large-lot residences approaching its south-western flanks north of Narellan Creek. Cattle grazing fields and shelter sheds lining Orielton's northern edge of Narellan Creek are apparent in a 1990 aerial photograph but absent in a 2005 one. The original grant and its management for grazing can still be understood in the broader landscape of the Narellan Valley.  Description  =Setting= Orielton Park is located within the Central Hills complex of the Scenic Hills of the Camden Valley. The property is enclosed by a ridge to the north and to the west. The property has been developed around the Narellan Creek which drains the eastern and northern hills of this valley to the Nepean River, which passes through Camden and then into the Hawkesbury River. Soils are predominately clays derived from the underlying Wianamatta shale. The area is characterised by subdivision, development and extensive grass(ed) hills and forest. Orielton homestead Lot is currently bound on the north, south and west by open paddocks and to the east by The Northern Road. Recent residential developments have begun to the south-west of the homestead complex and will continue.Tropman & Tropman, 2014, 15 Rainfall is approximately per year. Soils are predominantly clays derived from the underlying Wianamatta shale which is over sandstone.Tropman & Tropman, 2014, 17 Vegetation systems are related to soils and hydrology. Narrellan Creek has a significant surviving tree and grass ecology. The river flats have remnant trees and express the past land uses of agricultural cropping, pasture improvement and recreation pursuits. The hills and slopes have remnant trees and shrubs associated with this environment. The whole site is part of the Cumberland Plain or Cowpastures region. The home paddock surrounding the homestead was separated from the surrounding farm management complex and arable land and pasture by fencing. Orielton has a relationship to its surrounding rural landscape. Early photographs and plans and aerial photographs from the 1940s onwards show that the homestead operated as a whole precinct of functional spaces and buildings. Despite minor changes to garden settings and access ways, the estate was divided into the following general areas: The main homestead, presentation garden and recreation areas: tennis court, riding; * Picking gardens and orchards; * Farm management complex and working areas (the former Mill, silos, etc.); * Grazing pastures; * Narellan Creek and arable (crop) land.Tropman & Tropman, 2014, 11 Within the precinct there are important functional relationships between the main homestead, pleasure gardens and entry, the picking garden, farm management complex and workers' buildings and homestead, working areas (including mills, silos) and access roads (The Northern Road), stables and grazing pastures.Tropman & Tropman, 2014, 111 The change in entry was a result of the change in ownership and subsequent design style and period. It is suggested the Victorian Italianate style was influenced by the Picturesque movement. Homes were set in their extensive gardens and entry to these landed gentry estates resulted in a more formal procession to the house. The change in driveway access does not suggest a negative impact on the original functional relationship of the precinct. =Garden and grounds= View from northern ridge looking south west to Homestead Precinct and dam The garden appears to express Harriet Beard's occupation of the site and the Victorian period design styles. To the east of the homestead the gardens comprise a carriage loop with densely planted species including Bunya pines and a Moreton Bay fig (Ficus macrophylla). The area is delineated by collapsing timber post and wire strand fencing leading into the paddocks. The original northern entry came from the north-east of this area as the road linked to Maryland further up the Northern Road and physical evidence shows how it linked to the current carriage loop. The levelled portion of land directly east of the carriage loop was the tennis court. This area was expanded recently, filled with spoil from Roads & Maritime Services road works on the Northern Road. This area is currently used for horse agistment.Tropman & Tropman, 2014, 18 Evidence of formal gardens appears in the 1947 aerial photograph with remnant hedges forming the lines of formal gardens. Presently there is little found-evidence of the original gardens apart from terracing, steps and trees and a couple of rose bushes. The southern entry relating to Narellan, Campbelltown and Camden resulted in the formal garden being relocated (to the house's south). Like the early garden, little remains. The current entry drive passes the formal gardens and links to the early carriage loop. The drive is lined with prominent pines (Araucaria spp.). The 1947 aerial photograph shows semi-circular gardens (beds) in front of the Italianate portion of the homestead with associated planting and arrangements. The ashlar steps leading up to the \\"front\\" of the garden are still intact, however little garden arrangement and vegetation remain. More mature plantings were on the north-east side of the house, the main garden, Between the Northern Road and the homestead. A mature Bunya pine (Araucaria bidwillii) features on the northern edge of the garden. Other large hoop (A.cunninghamii) and Bunya pines are also now a feature of the garden and driveway. Mature conifers (?Cypresses) were notable in an undated 19th century photograph of the homestead group, east of the house. A large barn featured to the south east of the house in the same photograph. There were few trees in the paddocks but the landscape between Orielton and (neighbouring) Harrington Park shows that there was little change between the early photograph and one taken in December 2007. Significant tree plantings include the following species: Bunya Bunya pine (Araucaria bidwillii), hoop pines (A.cunninghamii), funeral cypress (Cupressus funebris), maritime pine (Pinus pinaster), she oak (Casuarina sp.), Brazilian peppercorn (Schinus areira), Moreton Bay fig (Ficus macrophylla), privet (Ligustrum sp.) and jacaranda (J.mimosifolia).Tropman & Tropman, 2014, 38 Scattered plantings include native kurrajong (Brachychiton populneus), deodar or Himalayan cedar (Cedrus deodara) and privet (Ligustrum sp.) trees. A couple of rose bushes remain on the terraces south of the homestead.Tropman & Tropman, 2014, 18 The west of the homestead was the working area and included the picking garden and orchard and a modest dam. While structures in this area have been lost, the northern line of European olive trees and 1946 aerial photographs reveal the boundaries of the area. Eileen Cummings (daughter of owner William Pilling) reveals that the orchard was still in use during their 1930 occupation and included fruits and nuts. The space is currently used for grazing. The large dam built by Warwick Fairfax in was constructed across the boundary of the former picking garden and orchard. The dam has recently been removed in preparation for the residential subdivision and new spine road. =Homestead Group and entry drive= The main homestead group focuses on the east and south with open rural land as its traditional address. The existing entry to Orielton follows the Old Northern Road easement in a north south direction curving sharply to the north west. At this point the drive is bordered by old pines and to the south is Narellan Creek. Towards the homestead group is evidence of previous hedges and remnant gardens formalised to the south. Located west of the main homestead is a dam. An old well structure remains near the top of the north ridge. The homestead consists of an early building with a large complex of additions. To the east of the main house is the stables and horse agistment area. To the north of the stables is evidence of an earlier garden or entry that orientates to the east. Additions were made to the house in the late 19th century and it was re-oriented (the original entrance driveway appears to have been from the Northern Road directly passing through the area occupied by farm buildings (today) to the entrance, which was oriented toward Northern Road and facing Crear Hill. =Outbuildings= *Silos (c.1950) *Former Miller's Cottage / Office (, adapted ) *Large Stables (, adapted ) *Hay Shed (, adapted ) *Early milking shed () *Stalls shed (-) *Concrete bin (, ) *Stock Yards () *Mill Building (3 storeys, no longer extant, -1950). = Condition = As at 24 February 2004, Orielton still retains some of its character based on the traditional juxtaposition of the main homestead area with its dominant garden and cleared pastureland beyond. Orielton has considerable archaeological potential as the property has been a continuously developing site from - . Orielton still retains its relationship to the various natural features such as Narellan Creek and the enclosing ridgelines, and its open pastoral landscapes. = Modifications and dates = *late 19th centuryadditions when the house was reoriented to face toward Camden.

Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries As at 23 February 2004, Orielton is of state heritage significance to the Camden area for the following reasons: # Orielton is a good representative example of a gentleman's estate from the 1840s, and possibly as early as the 1820s (granted in 1815); # Orielton housed the mill for wheat grown in the area - an important early industry. The continued adaptive reuse of the residence and the outbuildings is an important part of Orielton's history; # Orielton in its stages of construction and the arrangement of its buildings and gardens, illustrates the evolution of an upper-class working farm from early colonial times to the present day, with the occupants appreciating the landscape setting; # The buildings and grounds, in their periods of construction, illustrate the sequence of design elements as the estate grew since 1815; # Orielton homestead represents the layout of a gentleman's estate with views and vistas afforded to and from the homestead over the landscape and important access routes; # Orielton has strong associations with prominent land owners and local gentry since its 1840 occupation to the present Fairfax ownership. It has an association with the World War II air force occupation; # The buildings and layout of Orielton have the ability to demonstrate past estate development and farming practices particularly for wheat and flour production. Archaeological remains would provide insights into past occupation and use; # Orielton is aesthetically significant because it displays elements of Georgian design and detailing which is representative of the area. It also displays Italianate design rare to the area and to rural properties. Orielton's setting in the rural landscape is representative of design philosophies of the time. Its visual links with the landscape and surrounding properties is significant; # Orielton's setting in the rural landscape is representative of design philosophies of the time. Its visual links with the landscape and surrounding properties is significant; # The gardens surrounding the homestead are significant for retaining plant specimens and garden layouts associated with their early arrangement. The gardens have been arranged to provide a formal garden setting for the homestead, with its signal plantings of Bunya and Norfolk Island pines, providing a distinctive presence of the homestead against the undulating topography.Tropman & Tropman, 5/2004, 88 Individual elements located on the subject site which are considered to be of heritage significance include, but are not limited to, the following: * Orielton house; * remnants of the original driveway to The Northern Road; * remnants of original outbuildings to the north of the site and in the working area; * views and vistas; * landscape setting; * plantings.Tropman & Tropman, 2/2004, 26 Orielton dates from Governor Macquarie's 1815 land grant to Edward Lord. The visually prominent farm complex () is situated on the side of a knoll commanding sweeping views of Narellan and obeying the principles of 18th Century English landscape design. Orielton is considered to be of exceptional significance because of the integrity of its rural setting and the demonstrable functional relationships within the homestead and farm complex. The varied topographical features of Orielton (ridges, knolls and gentle slopes) contribute significantly to the setting and function of the property and its significant visual links with surrounding properties such as Harrington Park and Studley Park, the spire at St John's Church, Cobbitty and The Northern Road.draft nomination 2003. Orielton outline of significance: * It still retains its quintessential landscape character - based on the traditional juxtaposition of homestead area, with its dominant garden, and cleared pastureland beyond; * Its historical relationship to other nearby early grants (Harrington Park, Wivenhoe and Kirkham) and its place in the development of the local area can still be appreciated; * It has associations with some notable people; * The place retains its historical local prominence and serves as an important local landmark; * The place retains some key historical visual relationships - vistas to Harrington Park, Studley Park, the spire of St. John's, Camden and the Razorback Range; * A relatively intact estate - still able to appreciate the main homestead group in its traditional rural context and in relationship to the various natural features - Narellan Creek and the enclosing ridgelines; * The place has many features of individual significance such as the original homestead, later homestead, outbuildings, garden layout, terracing and mature plantings and the entry drive from the Northern Road; * The place has considerable capacity to demonstrate its development from to the present; * The place is of considerable scientific interest on account of its archaeological research potential.Morris & Britton, 2000, 37 Orielton was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 22 December 2006 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Orielton is historically significant as one of the first land grants in the Cowpastures district that still retains its historical relationship to other nearby early grants such as Harrington Park, Wivenhoe and Kirkham. Orielton is an important historical property in the development of the local area. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Orielton has several historical associations with notable people, especially Edward Lord and more recently the Fairfax family. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Orielton retains some significant historical visual relationships - vistas to Harrington Park, Studley Park, the spire of St Johns in Camden and the Razorback Range. The landscape character can still be appreciated based on the traditional juxtaposition of the homestead area, with its dominant garden and cleared pastureland beyond. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Orielton's historical relationship to other nearby early grants such as Harrington Park, Wivenhoe and Kirkham and its place in the development of the Camden area are locally significant. Orielton retains its historical local prominence and serves as an important local landmark. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Orielton has considerable technical/research significance for its capacity to demonstrate its development from 1815 to the present. The homestead site in particular has high research significance for its continuous architectural evolution, including the impact of World War Two in the region. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Orielton is rare as a relatively intact estate with its main homestead group still in its traditional rural context. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Orielton Estate is representative of past land uses of agricultural cropping, pasture improvement and recreation pursuits that reflect the emergence of Sydney's new middle class during the 19th century. The estate, much like neighboring Oran Park and Harrington Park is representative of Crown grants, subdivision patterns, ownership patterns and grazier's homesteads  See also  *Australian residential architectural styles  References  = Bibliography =      * = Attribution = Category:New South Wales State Heritage Register Category:Camden Council (New South Wales) Category:Hunting in Australia Category:Horse farms in Australia Category:Houses in New South Wales Category:Farms in New South Wales Category:Industrial buildings in New South Wales Category:Gardens in New South Wales Category:Articles incorporating text from the New South Wales State Heritage Register Category:Italianate architecture in Sydney Category:Fairfax family (publishers) ","title":"Orielton, Harrington Park"},{"id":"58637699","text":"Hypselodoris paradisa is a species of sea slug or dorid nudibranch, a marine gastropod mollusc in the family Chromodorididae.MolluscaBase (2018).

Bendiks rowed for SC Berlin-Gr√ºnau. At the 1976 East German national championships, Bendiks rowed with the coxed pair and the women's eight; she came first and second, respectively. However, that year women's rowing was introduced at the Olympic Games and the Olympic team members did not participate at the national championships. At the 1977 East German national championships, Bendiks won the coxed four title alongside Marion Rohs, Katja Rothe, Ilona Richter, and coxswain Marina Wilke. That team went to the 1977 World Rowing Championships on the Bosbaan rowing lake in the Netherlands where they became world champions. In February 1978, she was given two sports awards: Master of Sport and Honoured Master of Sports. At the 1978 East German national championships, Bendiks came third with the coxed four and took out the national title with the women's eight. She went to the 1978 World Rowing Championships on Lake Karapiro in New Zealand as a reserve but did not compete. It was at those championships that she got closer to one of the male rowers whom she later married; Uli Schmied was also present as a reserve. At the 1980 East German national championships, Bendiks came third with the women's eight; again, the Olympic team members were absent from that competition.

Dare John Thomas Dare ( ‚Äì December 15, 1912) was a politician, who briefly served in the House of Representatives for the Territory of Arizona, the California State Assembly, and as Attorney General of the Kingdom of Hawaii. He was born in Suffolk County, New York sometime between 1842 and 1844. The exact year varies by source. His professional background also varies by source, with some sources saying he hired on a ship as a teenager and sailed to San Francisco. He is also reputed to have established the Pony Express in Arizona, and operated a \\"milling\\" business. Arizona On December 25, 1890, The Morning Call newspaper of San Francisco published a several-page layout of the notable men of the area. In the category of notable legal professionals, it lists John Thomas Dare as having been born in 1843, and at age 14 becoming a sailor. Recounting that he moved to Arizona in 1863, it correctly lists his service in the territory's legislature. In 1867, he successfully ran as a Democrat for a seat from Yavapai County for the Arizona Territory House of Representatives.; The story is unsupported by facts when it reports that Dare instituted the Pony Express in Arizona during this time period. The Pony Express existed only April 1860 to October 1861, and never operated in Arizona. His later obituary in the Weekly Journal-Miner in Prescott, stated that he had a business connection with a stagecoach line between Prescott and Santa Fe, New Mexico. Hawaii According to historian Ralph Simpson Kuykendall, Dare had worked as the Assistant District Attorney of San Francisco, and was legal counsel for Claus Spreckels. In May 1886, Dare moved his family to Hawaii. After presenting credentials as \\"first assistant to the City and County of San Francisco\\", and \\"letters of patent and denization\\" from KalƒÅkaua, he was admitted to practice law in the Kingdom of Hawaii. Dare's appointment as Attorney General of Hawaii on July 1, as well as that of other appointed officials associated with Spreckels, was seen by some as part of a larger problem of Prime Minister Walter Murray Gibson catering to private interests. After much public opposition to Gibson's regime, Dare exited from his cabinet position on October 13 and returned to California. California In 1877-1880, Dare represented San Francisco as a Republican in the California State Assembly. He was an alternate delegate to the 1892 Republican National Convention in Minneapolis. US President William McKinley appointed Dare as Custom House Appraiser for San Francisco in 1897. He had been endorsed by John D. Spreckels, son of Claus. The San Francisco Call gave Dare's birth date as 1844, and made no mention of Arizona. The newspaper stated that he had arrived in Vallejo California directly from a sea voyage from New York, and began working as manual labor on a railroad. His later obituary in that same newspaper stated that he opened a \\"milling\\" business in Vallejo, but it's not clear if that was milling of ores, or cloth. From Vallejo, the newspaper stated that he relocated to San Francisco and took up the study of law. Upon his later return from Hawaii, he became a prosecuting attorney, and also served as Deputy Collector of the Port of San Francisco. Death Dare died in San Francisco December 15, 1912. His obituary lists his date of birth as 1842. He had a widow and three daughters. The Honolulu Star- Bulletin referred to him as \\"King Claus's Protege\\", and made note of several erroneous statements made by California media in their coverage of his background.

It was built from 1837 to 1946. It is sometimes referred to as Catherine Park House due to a land subdivision of Catherine Fields, however \\"Catherine Park\\" is only a developer's name for the area and not a true suburb. The property is privately owned. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 5 March 2015.  History  After settling at Sydney Cove in 1788, the First Fleet soon found the soil unsuitable for farming and looked for more fertile soils beyond the established boundaries of the colony. By 1795, the settlers had journeyed to the Cumberland Plain (to the west) and discovered the rich land of the Cowpastures, named after the discovery of a herd of wild cows that had escaped the colony years earlier and wandered west, grazing the land now known as the Camden district. Following the discovery of the area, the colonial gentry soon regarded it as rich, fertile and suitable land for livestock grazing and pastoral pursuits. The low rambling hills and wide expanses of grass flats were devoid of difficult vegetation and reminded the colonists of the familiar landscape of an English gentleman's park. This environment was considered ideal for the establishment of the wealthy estates so desired by the colonial gentry. Quickly, the acquisition of land in the district was being sought by private colonists. The newly appointed governor, Lachlan Macquarie, soon had the land surveyed and began granting land allotments to the colonial elite. In 1815, Governor Macquarie granted a parcel of land to Captain William Douglas Campbell, a member of the British merchant navy, who named the estate Harrington Park. The land on which Oran Park house now resides was, during Campbell's time, open cleared land for pastoral cultivation and livestock grazing. Upon Campbell's death in 1827, Harrington Park underwent the first of many land subdivisions. One thousand acres was transferred to Campbell's nephew, John Douglas Campbell, who commenced construction of a dwelling house and associated outbuildings (the existing coach house dates from ). Although the buildings were incomplete, Campbell leased the property in 1839 to Henry Keck Esq., Governor of Darlinghurst Gaol, who (as an agreement of the lease) was to continue with and finalise the construction of Oran Park house. In 1842, the lease was transferred to Henry William Johnson who took out two mortgages on the property. It is assumed that the first was to purchase of land and the buildings and the second was to finalise the construction of Oran Park house (). Johnson lived at Oran Park until 1867 when he defaulted on his mortgages and was foreclosed on by Thomas Barker who took possession of the property. It is alleged that, following this, the shamed Johnson leapt to his death from the roof of Oran Park house. By 1871, when Oran Park was sold to Edward Lomas Moore, the house was in poor condition. A wealthy grazier and one of the largest landowners in the Campbelltown district, Moore lived at Oran Park with his wife Anne and large family (of some 12 or so children) until the construction of the nearby Badgally house was complete. When the family moved in 1882, Moore leased the imposing two-storey Oran Park house (with wrap- around verandahs, rear basement, octagonal tower and established gardens) to Thomas Cadell who operated the property as a dairy farm. Upon Moore's death in 1887, and after years of the contention of his will, the ownership of the Oran Park property finally passed to his younger son Essington Moore in 1907 who initially leased the property before returning from England in the 1930s to make Oran Park his permanent home. Oran Park house underwent some changes during the Moore period (the roof was reconfigured and the lantern removed) but, upon his sudden death in 1937, the property was sold to Hubert Harry Robbins who had grand intentions to develop Oran Park as his family's country retreat. Much of the significant modifications to Oran Park house are attributed to Robbins who converted the Victorian Italianate house into a Georgian Revival style. After Robbins death in 1945, Oran Park was sold to Daniel James Cleary (who established the Oran Park Raceway, west of the property), sold again to Sydney merchants Arthur Raymond Booth and Robert Leslie Booth later in 1946 and then again to Camden farmer John Thomas Vivian Frost in 1947. Frost continued the farming use of the property until 1960 when it was then sold to Cobbitty Investments Pty Ltd for subdivision into hobby farms. Sold again in 1961, Oran Park became the property of Edward Star, a hotel proprietor from Sydney's eastern suburbs, who developed the property and established a trotting track, 18-hole golf course and function centre. During this time, Oran Park house was used as the golf clubhouse. After another failed development attempt and a succession of different owners, Oran Park was purchased in 1969 by the Honourable Lionel John Charles Seymour Dawson-Damer. An engineer and motor racing enthusiast in Australia and internationally, Dawson-Damer was attracted to the property because of its close proximity to the Oran Park Raceway and was said to house his historic car collection in the stables and outbuildings of the Oran Park property. In a dilapidated state upon the purchase, Dawson-Damer and his wife, Ashley, set about restoring the house and outbuildings (including coach house), re-establishing the gardens and reinstating the former historic driveway to Cobbitty Road (now Oran Park Drive). John Dawson-Damer was killed in a racing accident in 2002 and the ownership of Oran Park has since exchanged hands a number of times. Currently owned by Hixon Pty Ltd (as of August 2013), Oran Park is the subject of the Catherine Fields (Part) Precinct land release area. In the mid-2010s, the driveway was shortened to Seidler Parade, a local street within the Oran Park development, and is no longer accessible directly to/from Oran Park Drive.  Description  =Site and setting= Long driveway Approached up a long straight driveway from Oran Park Drive and terminating in a formal carriage loop, Oran Park house is positioned on a prominent natural knoll surrounded by open paddocks and rural landscape. Its siting in the landscape makes Oran Park house a visually dominant structure and affords it views from and towards the surrounding historic estates. The Oran Park property retains the main house, coach house, silo, gardens, paddocks and driveways. = Paddocks = =Driveways= Two driveways mark changes in access to Oran Park house over time. The older driveway runs on a diagonal from south-east to north-west, from close to the corner of the former Cow Pasture Road (now Camden Valley Way) to the homestead. This was lined in the 1920s with inter-planted avenue of South African yellowwood / outeniqua (Afrocarpus falcatus) and native Port Jackson cypress pine (Callitris rhomboidea). The other driveway runs south- north off former Cobbitty Road (now Oran Park Drive) to the homestead. This was lined in part in the mid-late 20th century with a mixture of eucalypt species.Stuart Read, pers.comm. Existing eucalypts (mature in 1947) west of this western, newer driveway. =Garden= Driveway and gardens The homestead is surrounded by a large country garden, chiefly lawns with scattered shrubberies and specimen trees. Some trees are mature and date either to the Victorian or Edwardian eras, such as a Bunya Bunya pine (Araucaria bidwillii) and Mediterranean cypress (Cupressus sempervirens) and white cedar trees (Melia azederach var. australasica). Also prominent are old Brazilian Peppercorn trees (Schinus molle var. areira); A 20th century planting south- west of the house is Hoop pine (A.cunninghamii). Also prominent are maturing Chinese elms (Ulmus parvifolia). Much of the garden around the house reflects mid-late 20th century plantings and replantings made by the Dawson-Damers. These include Cape chestnut (Cupania capensis). Garden shrubs include a hedge of mature Cape honeysuckle/tecoma (Tecomaria capensis), South African wintersweet/ dune poison bush (Acokanthera oppositifolia), climbing/hairy aloe (Aloe ciliata), African boxthorn (Lycium ferocissimum) (a popular hedge species) and geraniums (Pelargonium x hortorum cv's). A kitchen garden area is to the west of the house, flanked by Cape honeysuckle hedging and fences. =Homestead= Homestead interiors Staircase Oran Park is a two-storey residential dwelling with rear wing. Originally constructed in the Victorian Italianate style, the house underwent significant modifications in the Inter- War period and now has a Georgian Revival appearance. At the rear of the house, the courtyard is enclosed by masonry walls. A well or cistern is beneath the paving of the rear courtyard. A caretaker's cottage is located to the rear of Oran Park house. =Coach House= The coach house, located to the east of the main house, is a single storey (originally two storey) building constructed of the same sandstock bricks as Oran Park house. = Silo = = Condition = Oran Park house is in generally good condition. On-site caretakers provide ongoing maintenance and security for the house. The original form of Oran Park house has changed significantly due to alterations, additions and intervention throughout its history. The Inter-War development of the house, to give it a Georgian Revival appearance, has compromised the integrity of the house. Although some original fabric and features remain extant, the consistent evolution and modification of the house has also compromised the original intactness of its fabric. The site (house, outbuildings and grounds) now has a layering of fabric which, although not originally intact, does demonstrate the evolution of the site and its use over time. = Modifications and dates = *1907-37 - Essington Moore undertook some modifications on Oran Park house, including reconfiguring the roof and removing the lantern in the 1930s). *1937-45 - Hubert Harry Robbins undertook significant alterations and additions at Oran Park House and converted the Victorian Italianate house into a Georgian Revival style building. The rear basement was converted to a garage. *1960 - Oran Park converted into 26 hobby farms. *1961 - Trotting track and 18-hole golf course established. Oran Park house converted to gold clubhouse. *1969 - John Dawson-Damer restored Oran Park house and coach house and reinstated historic driveway to Cobbitty Road (now Oran Park Drive). Constructed swimming pool to west of house. *1990 - Further renovations undertaken by the Dawson-Damer family.  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries As at 28 June 2007, Oran Park is of state heritage significance as an early surviving cultural landscape in NSW. Part of a land grant, awarded by Governor Lachlan Macquarie to William Douglas Campbell in 1815, Oran Park represents the colonial development of the Cowpastures district in the early to mid-19th century and demonstrates the emergence of country estates for the prominent and wealthy members of the colony. Oran Park retains a number of layers of fabric that demonstrates the evolution of the property and its use over the last two centuries. Oran Park is of state heritage significance for its association with a number of prominent people, including: William Douglas Campbell (recipient of original grant and owner of Harrington Park, 1815‚Äì27), Edward Lomas Moore (wealthy grazier and large landholder in Campbelltown district, 1871‚Äì82) and the Honourable John Dawson- Damer (engineer and motor racing enthusiast, 1969-2002). Oran Park was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 5 March 2015 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Oran Park is of state heritage significance as an early surviving cultural landscape in NSW. Part of a land grant, awarded by Governor Lachlan Macquarie to William Douglas Campbell in 1815, Oran Park represents the colonial development of the Cowpastures district in the early to mid-19th century and demonstrates the emergence of country estates for the prominent and wealthy members of the colony. Established in the early 19th century (the coach house dating from ), Oran Park estate and house contains various layers of fabric that demonstrate the evolution, development and changing taste and use of the property over the past two centuries. Originally constructed in the Victorian Italianate style, the house underwent significant modifications in the Inter- War period and now has a Georgian Revival appearance. Oran Park is of state heritage significance for its association with a number of prominent people, including: William Douglas Campbell (recipient of original grant and owner of Harrington Park, 1815‚Äì27), Edward Lomas Moore (wealthy grazier and large landholder in Campbelltown district, 1871‚Äì82) and the Honourable John Dawson- Damer (engineer and motor racing enthusiast, 1969-2002). The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Oran Park is of state heritage significance for its association with a number of prominent people, including members of the colonial ruling class of NSW in the 19th century. The Oran Park property was originally part of a 2000-acre land grant, awarded by Governor Lachlan Macquarie to William Douglas Campbell in 1815. Campbell was a prominent colonist and member of the British merchant navy who named the property Harrington Park and used that land, on which Oran Park now resides, as open cleared space for pastoral cultivation and livestock grazing. Over two centuries, Oran Park has been under the ownership of a number of different people and companies. Edward Lomas Moore, the wealthy grazier and one of the largest landholders in the Campbelltown district, owned Oran Park from 1871 until his death in 1882 (the family would own the property until 1939). Oran Park also had a significant association with the Honourable John Dawson-Damer who owned and lived at the property from 1969 until his death in 2002 (his family sold Oran Park in 2006). Dawson-Damer was a renowned motor racing enthusiast, in a national and international setting, and was attracted to the Oran Park property because of its proximity to the Oran Park Raceway. It was said that Dawson-Damer housed his own historic car collection in the stables and outbuildings of the Oran Park property. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The establishment of Oran Park house on a prominent hilltop location in a rural setting reflects the landscape design principles that were practised in England in the early 19th century. The siting of the house in the landscape, reminiscent of the summit model, provided its residents with sweeping views of the countryside and vistas to and from Oran Park to neighbouring colonial estates in the Cowpastures district. The relationship between the house, its formal gardens and wider landscape remains discernible. The original driveway to Camden Valley Way is partially discernible by the remnant vegetation. Oran Park was originally constructed in the Victorian Italianate style and, since undergoing significant modifications, has been adapted to the Inter-War Georgian Revival style. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. With a long held use as a private residence, the social significance of Oran Park is limited. However, Oran Park is widely recognised as an early cultural landscape and has some social significance for the greater Camden district (once the Cowpastures). The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. There is potential for archaeological studies to be undertaken on the Oran Park property. Although the pastoral and agricultural use of the land may have disturbed likely archaeological evidence, analysis of the landscape could reveal further information about how the land was laid out and used over time. There is also potential for archaeological evidence to be discovered in core areas immediately surrounding Oran Park house and the coach house that could reveal further information about the construction of the buildings and later works carried out on the property. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Oran Park is an early cultural landscape of the Cowpastures district. While not a rare example, it is representative of colonial country estates of the 19th century. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Oran Park is of state heritage significance as a representative example of a mid-19th century cultural estate in the Cowpastures district. Established in the 1830s, Oran Park is a remnant country estate that reflects the landscape design principles that were practised in England at the time. The siting of an imposing mansion- style house on a dominant natural hilltop or ridgeline was a British design type used throughout the Cowpastures district during the early to mid-19th century. With an extended driveway, entranceway and carriage loop, the placement of the house in this landscape encouraged those passing by to see the house and observe the status and wealth of the landowner. This landscape design and the retention of the main house, outbuildings, driveways and setting makes Oran Park a representative example of an early cultural landscape.

It was an April Fools prank.  Hoax  The article claims that Philip Morris USA, owner of the Marlboro tobacco company, is introducing a new line of marijuana cigarettes called Marlboro M in Colorado and the state of Washington. While fake, the article does have some factual basis, as tobacco companies have shown interest in marijuana since the 1970's. Even though the article was quite obviously satire, the clickbait title was able to make it around the internet before it could be disproved. Some users, upon discovering that there were no 'Marlboro M' cigarettes at their local dispensary, claimed that they would be in stock by the end of 2017.  Basis  While the article was proven fake, its claims were able gain widespread belief because of past and current events in cannabis culture, which themselves were true. For example, it is true that tobacco companies, including Phillip Morris, were interested in marijuana as a competing product and potentially investing in the cannabis industry, long before rapid legalization came about. Legalization of cannabis in the United States is also a contributing factor to the blind acceptance these claims received, as societal views on marijuana use have largely shifted in recent years. Some tobacco companies have actually began investing in medical marijuana research, as well as joining with marijuana seed investment firms, though they haven't gone as far is to introduce cannabis cigarettes into the market. In 2018 when the hoax appeared, it would be illegal at the US federal level for a large company, such as Philip Morris, to introduce cannabis cigarettes across the country.

Hamer wrote more than a dozen books under three different pen names including What Girls Can Do (Phillis Browne), Mrs. Somerville and Mary Carpenter (Phyllis Browne), and Happy Little People (Olive Patch). Her son, Sam Hield Hamer, was also a notable children's author. See below section \\"List of Books\\" for the full list of her works written under all her pseudonyms.  Early childhood  Sarah Sharp (Heaton) Hamer was born on August 25, 1839 in Yorkshire, Leeds, England. According to a census in 1851 and other records, Sarah was born to parents John Heaton (1802-1866) and Rachel Aspin (1806-1868) and was one of five children in the family. However, baptismal records show that Sarah's mother is a woman named Elizabeth Heaton. Sarah Sharp Heaton was baptized at St. Peter's in Leeds, England on September 15, 1839. Not much is known about Sarah Heaton as a child, her siblings, or her parents. Legal documentation states that that John Heaton, Sarah's father was a bookseller, which may have had an impact on Sarah's career choice  Marriage and adult life  Sarah Sharp Hamer was married at the Camden Road Baptist Chapel in London on July 25, 1861 to John Hamer, who was an Englishman born in 1837. The couple had six children and lived in District 9 of St. Pancras, London, England in 1881. Two of their children followed in their parents‚Äô footsteps and were also authors, editors, and publishers. As a writer, Hamer published most if not all of her works through Cassell and Company, a publishing firm that has since been bought by Orion Publishing. She died on 1 February 1927 at 69 Dartmouth Patk Hill, Kentish Town1927 U.K. Probate index ..  Publications and legacy  Sarah Hamer continued to write and publish novels throughout her lifetime. Hamer wrote largely for young girls, specifically in the areas of home economics and natural history. Her book The Dictionary of Dainty Breakfasts (under the pseudonym Phillis Browne) was notable for helping set the trend of establishing breakfast as a necessary third meal of the day, as well as popularizing many common English breakfast foods. According to Kaori O'Connor \\"Early English cookbooks have recipes for lunch and for dinner, but no recipes at all for breakfast. Large breakfasts do not figure in English life or cookbooks until the nineteenth century, when they appear with dramatic suddenness.\\" Food culture and \\"national\\" cuisines are often considered major elements of national identity and considered \\"sensitive barometers of both change and fundamental values\\" for a society. Hamer, along with other women writing instructional and scientific books for children, \\"were excluded from practicing as scientists, and thus from demonstrably adding new knowledge to the world; still, they were deeply invested in making science comprehensible and available to readers\\" = Notable children = Sam H. Hamer began his career by editing the Little Folks Magazine, for Cassell and Company. After he worked as an editor, Sam Hamer wrote numerous books including The Dolomites, Sunlight and Shade, and Stories and Pictures for Sundays. For his writing, Sam Hamer even used a pen name for some of his works, just like his mother-Sam Browne. The other writer in the family was Margaret Hamer, who wrote under the pen name Maggie Browne and published Two Old Ladies, Two Foolish Fairies, and a Tom Cat which was illustrated by Arthur Rackham, Chats about Germany, Little Mothers and their Children, and Wandering Ways.

In 2017, she was awarded the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers by Barack Obama. In 2019 Grassellino became the Deputy Chief Technology Officer at Fermilab.https://news.fnal.gov/2019/12/fermilab-scientist-anna-grassellino-is- new-deputy-chief-technology-officer/  Early life and education  Grassellino is from Marsala, Italy. She attended the Scientific High School of Marsala graduating cum laude. She studied electronic engineering at the University of Pisa, graduating in 2005 with a thesis in microelectronics. She spent the summer of 2004 as an intern at Fermilab and met Nigel Lockyer. She joined the University of Pennsylvania for her graduate studies as she wanted to study free from gender bias. For her doctorate, she specialized in superconducting radio frequency technology and applied physics working with Nigel Lockyer. In 2009 she was awarded the top young researcher poster prize at the International Particle Accelerator Conference. She worked in Philadelphia and at TRIUMF in Vancouver, and eventually graduated in 2011.  Research and career  Grassellino was appointed as a postdoctoral researcher at Fermilab in 2012. She was then appointed Scientist in 2015 and Senior Scientist in 2018. Grassellino has covered leadership roles at Fermilab starting from group leader in 2014 to Deputy Division Head in 2016 and Deputy Chief Technology Officer in 2019. She currently manages an Associate Professor position at Northwestern University where she is Co-Director of the Center for Applied Physics and Superconducting Technology (CAPST). She is known for her pioneering work in superconducting radio frequency cavities for next generation particle accelerators. As a postdoc, Grassellino experimented with introducing a small amount of nitrogen into the inner surface of the cavities, which are made of niobium and surface treated using electropolishing. She and her group noticed that residual nitrogen remaining in the cavity systematically improved the RF superconductivity response. By baking the niobium SRF cavities at high temperatures in the presence of nitrogen, the Q factors more than tripled; dramatically reducing the cryogenic costs of the large accelerator facilities. She made the discovery of nitrogen doping by accident, hoping to create niobium nitride but instead found with her FNAL group - via material and surface science studies - that the real effect was due to nitrogen as interstitial. Superconducting radio frequency cavities generate high energy with high current and expel magnetic flux, which can result in power dissipation. The technology has been adopted as the standard for SRF cavities and used in laboratories all over the world, as well as private firms. The LCLS-II HE upgrades at SLAC are the first world class accelerator facilities to be built entirely with the nitrogen doping technology. In 2015 she was awarded a $2.5 million Early Career Award from the United States Department of Energy, which allowed her to employ postdocs. Grassellino has given several international talks, including the keynote talk at the American Association for the Advancement of Science Innovations in Accelerator Science conference in 2015. In 2016 she hosted Matteo Renzi at Fermilab, who asked her to support him in representing Italians Abroad. She won the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Particle Accelerator Science and Technology Award in 2016, the U.S. Particle Accelerator School's Prize for Achievement in Accelerator Physics and Technology in 2017, and the 2017 Frank Sacherer Prize for early-career achievement in the accelerator field. She was awarded the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers in 2017 from Barack Obama. She has given popular science lectures in Italy and America. She is the co-director of the Fermilab and Northwestern Center for Applied Physics and Superconducting Technologies (CAPST). In 2018 she was awarded the highest honour of the Rotary Club of Marsala Lilibeo.  Honors  In 2020, Grassellino was elected Fellow of the American Physical Society.

The series was created by the Duffer Brothers, who are also executive producers along with Shawn Levy, Dan Cohen, and Iain Paterson. The third season stars Winona Ryder, David Harbour, Finn Wolfhard, Millie Bobby Brown, Gaten Matarazzo, Caleb McLaughlin, Noah Schnapp, Sadie Sink, Natalia Dyer, Charlie Heaton, Joe Keery, Dacre Montgomery, Maya Hawke, Priah Ferguson, and Cara Buono. Cary Elwes, Jake Busey, Michael Park, and Francesca Reale appear in recurring roles. Premise In the summer of 1985 in Hawkins, the newly opened Starcourt Mall has become the focal point of the town, driving other stores out of business. Hawkins chief of police Jim Hopper is conflicted over Eleven and Mike's budding relationship, while Joyce considers moving out of Hawkins for better prospects, leaving the state of the children's friendships and her own relationship with Hopper in the air, and Joyce notices something strange going on with her magnets. However, strange power fluctuations trigger Will's awareness of something otherworldly, and Eleven and Max sense something is off about the town's residents, and despite having closed the portal to the Upside Down, fear that they are all still in danger from it.

In August 2017, the Duffer Brothers confirmed there would be a third season, with the likelihood of one more season following that, with Ross saying, \\"We're thinking it will be a four-season thing and then out\\". However, executive producer Shawn Levy later suggested that either four or five total seasons were possibilities, claiming that \\"the truth is we're definitely going four seasons and there's very much the possibility of a fifth. Beyond that, it becomes I think very unlikely.\\" Matt Duffer later commented that no official decision has been made, claiming that \\"It's hard, like four seems short, five seems long. So I don't know what to do.\\" In December 2017, Netflix officially confirmed that they have green lit the third season, consisting of eight episodes. Levy also confirmed that a fourth season was \\"definitely happening\\" and that there was potential for a fifth season. A year later, the episode titles for season three were revealed, along with confirming the season would be named Stranger Things 3, similar to the second season. =Writing= Writing for the third season began before the second season's premiere, with a good portion being written in twelve-to-fourteen- hour bouts by the series' creators. It was reported that Netflix wanted both the third and fourth seasons to be written simultaneously as to facilitate a back-to-back production schedule, for the actors were aging faster than their on-screen characters, but both the Duffer Brothers and producer Shawn Levy opted to focus only on the third season to ensure it was better-developed and more fleshed out. In terms of narrative, Levy said the season would be less about Will, saying, \\"We're not going to put Will through hell for a third season in a row. He'll be dealing with stuff, but he won't be at rock bottom... We're [going to be] dealing with forces of evil that are new.\\" David Harbour has said that the third season also draws heavily from the film Fletch. Both Levy and Natalia Dyer echo sentiments that this season's events will be more adult-oriented, with Dyer calling the season's narrative \\"...Bigger, darker, [and] scarier.\\" The early pitch documents for the season featured a scene that had the Mind Flayer monster rampaging through the Hawkins Fourth of July Parade, but the idea was later scrapped as the scripts were written. =Casting= The third season sees Ryder, Harbour, Wolfhard, Brown, Matarazzo, McLaughlin, Schnapp, Sink, Dyer, Heaton, Buono, Keery, and Montgomery return. In March 2018, it was announced that Priah Ferguson's character had been promoted to a recurring role, and that Maya Hawke has been cast as Robin, a new lead who's been described as an \\"alternative girl.\\" Hawke's character was later revealed to be Steve's co-worker at the Scoops Ahoy ice cream parlor in the newly built Starcourt Mall. Cary Elwes and Jake Busey's castings were announced in April 2018; Elwes was cast as Mayor Kline, a \\" classic '80s politician ‚Äì more concerned with his own image than with the people of the small town he governs,\\" and Busey as Bruce, a shifty reporter who works at The Hawkins Post. Francesca Reale was cast as Heather, a popular lifeguard at the community pool. As of September 2018, casting had still not been completed for the season, which at that point had been shooting for five months and was less than two months from completion. Carmen Cuba, the show's casting director, attributed the slower-than-usual casting process to the heightened secrecy of the plot paired with certain roles' shifting characterizations and importance. For the third season, it was reported that several of the cast members would receive pay raises. Ryder and Harbour received an increase to $350,000 an episode from $150,000 and $80,000 respectively; Wolfhard, Matarazzo, McLaughlin, and Schnapp earned a pay increase to over $200,000 an episode, possibly as much as $250,000, a significant increase from the reported $20,000 they had made in season one (later increased by $60,000); and Dyer, Heaton, and Keery received approximately $150,000 an episode. Brown's wage increase was not disclosed, but was estimated to be bigger than that of her young counterparts. Some sources suggest she made at least $250,000 and may have received between $300,000 and $350,000 per episode. =Filming= Gwinnett Place Mall stood in for the fictional \\"Starcourt Mall\\" during third-season filming Filming for the 3rd season officially began on April 23, 2018. Jackson, Georgia remained as primary filming area for scenes in Hawkins' downtown area. The South Bend Pool in Atlanta served as the Hawkins community pool. The major setpiece of the season, Starcourt Mall, was filmed at a re-dressed Gwinnett Place Mall near Duluth, Georgia. The production team had searched around Georgia for a dead mall, one either closed or with significantly reduced vacancy, for film, and found Gwinnett was nearly perfect, having been built in 1984 and thus having the staples of construction from malls in that period. They secured a portion of the mall that had been vacant for some time, redressing the storefronts and food court to feature brands of the 80s, paying attention to which stores likely had made it to Indiana by 1985. Outside \\"Scoops Ahoy!\\", a fictional store, they had to make one exception for \\"Glamour Shots\\", which was a real chain of photo studios but did not come to malls until after 1985; as a scene of Eleven and Max enjoying a photo shoot was a necessary plot element, the design team created a similar photo studio but with a new fictitious name. Not only did they recreate the facade of each of the storefronts, but they worked to fully stock them as well, in anticipation of any last-minute filming ideas the Duffers may have had. A custom-built grid cloth was employed to completely block sunlight from entering the atrium of the food court to enable filming night scenes during the day. In addition to the aforementioned sets, filming also occurred at pre-existing structures dressed as the Hawkins town hall and Mayor Kline's house. The production also used a total of seven sound stages, with an average of three sets per stage. To create the \\"black void\\", the visual manifestation of Eleven's telepathic ruminations, filming took place in a pool that was \\"painted black [and filled] with about an inch of water, [and was] surrounded by 270 degrees of duvetyne around thirty feet high\\". The void's look was tweaked slightly for the third season and shooting in the newer, smaller space required a Technocrane and two boom operators. An empty field was used to film the scenes set at the Hawkins Fun Fair, with the crew arriving just three weeks prior to the opening of a previously booked medieval fair. Period-appropriate carnival rides were trucked into the set from locations from across the country, and the crew retrofitted the rides' modern lighting with bulbs that would have been used in the 1980s. On September 27, 2018, Brown was spotted filming an emotional scene with stunt doubles and a child dressed in a baseball uniform at a beach in Malibu, California. Filming for the third season concluded on November 12, 2018. Regarding the lengthy hiatus between the second and third seasons, Netflix programming executive Cindy Holland noted \\"[the Duffer Brothers and Shawn Levy] understand the stakes are high. They want to deliver something bigger and better than last year. I think it's going to be a fantastic season. It will be worth the wait.\\" =Visual effects= Heading into production for the first season of Stranger Things, the Duffer Brothers intended on shooting a number of special effects using practical methods. However, due to issues with the deployment of the practical effects on-set, coupled with a dissatisfaction with the results of the filmed practical material, The Duffer Brothers became much more keen on utilizing digitally-produced special effects for the second season, and even more so for the third season. During pre-production, the Duffers sat down with Senior VFX Supervisor Paul Graff, production designer Chris Trujillo, and senior concept illustrator Michael Maher to plan out the digital visual effects for the season. One of the most important topics of discussion was the design of the \\"corporeal\\" manifestation of the \\"Shadow Monster/Mindflayer,\\" which the Duffers wanted to be cognizant of the titular \\"Thing\\" from John Carpenter's 1982 science fiction horror film The Thing. To emulate this decided look, the group decided the creature should have \\"some real weight and, consequently, a different new feel for [the animation], including specularity and moisture,\\" an aesthetic that also translated to the \\"Tom/Bruce\\" monster that attacks Nancy at the hospital. The team for season three found it important for the actors to have some sort of on-set physical guide to interact with the large would-be digital entities, as money wasn't budgeted for any sort of costly on-set augmented reality previsualization renderings. Graff noted it was impractical and too expensive to 3D print a rough replica of the physical \\"Shadow Monster/Mindflayer\\", as had been done with creatures in the previous season, especially considering the monster is essentially \\"something the size of a T-Rex invading a shopping mall.\\" A one- hundred pound \\"zeppelin-shaped creature shell\\" was initially constructed for the actors to interact with, but it too was deemed impractical and was scrapped. Graff eventually went out and purchased \\"the largest object [he] could think of\\" ‚Äî a blow-up beach ball ‚Äî and taped it to the end of a twenty- foot boom pole so he could \\"puppeteer the ‚Äòhead‚Äô enough to provide an eyeline for the actors while also giving camera operators a shot at framing for and tracking the creature‚Äôs movements.‚Äù Graff employed a much more unique means to visualize the \\"Tom/Bruce\\" monster during filming, as the extremely erratic and complicated lighting situation of the scenes that it was featured in mounted a number of potential hardships to be faced during post-production work: =Music= The original soundtrack album for the third season, titled Stranger Things 3, was released digitally on June 28, 2019, via Lakeshore and Invada Records. Like the previous two seasons, the soundtrack was composed by Kyle Dixon and Michael Stein of the electronic band Survive. The album will be also released on physical formats such as CD, vinyl, and cassette. In addition to Dixon and Stein's original soundtrack, the season features several songs selected from the 1980s and earlier eras. Legacy Recordings released a 16-track compilation of these songs on July 5, 2019. The finale of the episode \\"E Pluribus Unum\\", particularly the scenes involving Eleven's telepathic encounter with the Mind Flayer-possessed Billy, contain excerpts of \\"Confrontation and Rescue\\" from the second act of Satyagraha by Philip Glass. Of note was the use of \\"The NeverEnding Story\\", the theme to the 1984 film of the same name, which is used in the final episode when Suzie refuses to provide the critical code until Dustin sings it to her. The Duffers had wanted to introduce Suzie into the show's narrative in some dramatic fashion while giving Matarazzo, who has sung on Broadway before, a chance to show off his own vocals. Initially, they were planning to use \\"The Ent and the Entwife\\" song from The Lord of the Rings, but aware that Amazon Studios were developing its own Lord of the Rings series, decided to change direction. The Duffers credit writer Curtis Gwinn for using \\"The NeverEnding Story\\" as the replacement. Matarazzo and Gabriella Pizzolo, the actress playing Suzie and also a seasoned singer on Broadway, were on sets near each other when they sang the song together and were able to harmonize the song as well without the backing music. As their characters were not meant to be in that much synchronization due to being in two different places, the song's backing track and some autotuning were used to blend their singing to their respective settings and the tone of the soundtrack. According to the cast and to composers Kyle Dixon and Michael Stein, the song became an earworm for many of the cast on the day that scene was filmed. Later in the episode, Lucas and Max, played by Caleb McLaughlin and Sadie Sink, sing the song in duet back to Dustin to mock him; both McLaughlin and Sink also have had experience in Broadway musicals. As a result of its appearance in the series, \\"The NeverEnding Story\\" drew an 800% increase in viewership and streaming requests on YouTube and Spotify over the days after initial broadcast, putting Limahl, the song's artist, briefly back in the spotlight. Marketing Stranger Things 3 was widely anticipated, and Netflix backed the show with extensive marketing campaigns. Promotion for the third season began with the first day of production, when Netflix released a video featuring the cast as they met for the season's first script read-through. On July 16, 2018, the first teaser trailer for the season was released. The teaser, which is the first to feature footage shot for the new season, is styled as an in-universe commercial for the newly built Starcourt Mall, one of the main settings for the season's events. The \\"commercial\\" lists some of the stores found in the mall as well as restaurants in the \\"state-of-the-art\\" food court, and closes with Steve (Joe Keery) and Robin (Maya Hawke) saying \\"Ahoy!\\" during a short plug for one of the food court's establishments, an ice cream parlor called Scoops Ahoy. On December 9, 2018, during an appearance at the 2018 Comic Con Experience at the S√£o Paulo Expo in S√£o Paulo, Brazil, Noah Schnapp, Sadie Sink, and Caleb McLaughlin presented a new teaser which revealed the titles of the eight episodes in the new season. Hours later, the teaser was released online across all of the official Stranger Things social media accounts. On December 31, pedestrians in New York City's Times Square noticed a video playing on a loop advertising a special announcement \\"sponsored\\" by the Starcourt Mall. According to the video, the announcement was slated to be aired on the fictional ABC network affiliate WIYZ. At midnight EST, Netflix released a new teaser announcing the release date of the season to be July 4, 2019. The teaser utilized footage from Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve 1984, specifically the countdown to the New Year. As the countdown commenced, the video slowly turned upside down and became fuzzy, and Mike could be heard calling out for Eleven as the video cut in between different recordings of computers running MS-DOS. The season's first poster, featuring a menacing creature slowly approaching the cast while they're enjoying Independence Day festivities, was released concurrently with the teaser. On March 19, 2019, the official Stranger Things social media accounts posted a short clip of rats scurrying through a dilapidated industrial area with the caption \\"It's almost feeding time.\\" This turned out to be a prelude to the release of stills and the first official trailer the next day on March 20. The trailer quickly became the most-viewed video on Netflix's YouTube channel, amassing 22million views in the first week of its release. On May 21, the first clip from the season was released in tandem with cast posters. The clip, which features Billy flirting with Karen Wheeler at the local pool, includes notable references to the early-1980s comedy films Caddyshack and Fast Times at Ridgemont High. Netflix released the final trailer on June 20, 2019. In July 2019, actors Finn Wolfhard and Caleb McLaughlin took part in a Q&A; session at the Open'er Festival in Gdynia, Poland. The festival also boasted a replica of the Palace Arcade filled with retro coin-ops ‚Äì such as Space Invaders, Pac- Man, Donkey Kong and Dig Dug. =Tie-ins= Netflix revealed they had partnered with around 75 companies to produce tie-in products to promote the third season. For many of these deals, there was no financial exchange between Netflix and the third-parties, with Netflix allowing the third-parties to generate their own marketing buzz for their products while helping to promote Stranger Things. Some of the more notable tie-ins include: * Swedish apparel retailer H&M; offered a clothing collection that includes pieces worn on- screen by several of the series' actors on May 24, 2019. The advertisement campaign for the clothing and accessory lines features Dacre Montgomery (Billy) as a model and revolves around his character's summer job as a lifeguard. * The Coca-Cola Company revived their ill-received New Coke soft drink for a limited time production run in the month leading up to the season's release. The unpopular soft drink was released around the time frame of the season's setting, and a number of episodes featured the beverage prominently placed within the frame. New Coke was sold at special upside down vending machines in some United States cities and through Coca-Cola's web store. * Ice cream chain Baskin-Robbins started offering Stranger Things- inspired menu items in the months prior to the season's release, and at the launch of the third season, several Baskin-Robbins stores across the United States and Canada were made up into the fictional \\"Scoops Ahoy!\\" ice cream parlor in the show for about two weeks. * Fast food chain Burger King started serving special themed 'upside down' Whoppers as a reference to the Upside Down (an alternative universe in the story of the show), including special edition items sold at 11 special locations in the weeks leading up to the premiere. And selling special ketchup packets displaying a nose in reference to the nose bleeding of the character, Eleven. Burger King also promoted their restaurant commercials, cups and boxes in a special 1980s theme as a tie-in with Coca-Cola. The restaurant was also featured in the food court of the Starcourt Mall. * In the week leading to Stranger Things 3s release, Microsoft teased \\"Windows 1.0\\", the company's first graphic operating system introduced in 1985. Microsoft released this mock version of \\"Windows 1.0\\" as an app for Windows 10 on July 8, 2019. The app features a similar interface as the original software, with various Easter eggs to the television series scattered through the app. * Netflix partnered with Epic Games to include Stranger Things tie-ins into Fortnite Battle Royale around the premiere of the third season. Video game A video game adaptation entitled Stranger Things 3: The Game was released hours after the third season premiered on July 4, 2019. It was developed by BonusXP, published by Netflix, and was designed with a retro look. The game was criticized by reviewers for being an exact scene-by-scene replica of the season. Reception =Audience viewership= Netflix ratings Within four days of its release, Netflix reported that over 40.7million accounts had seen at least 70% of one episode of the third season, a record viewership for any Netflix program, while 18.2million had seen the entire season within the time. Netflix reported in October 2019 that over 64million households had watched Stranger Things 3 within the first four weeks of its release. Nielsen ratings Nielsen ratings recorded viewership data for those who viewed the series within the United States on a TV set; the data does not account for mobile, tablet, and PC devices, nor viewers outside of the United States. { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" + Nielsen ratings - ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  Title ! rowspan=\\"2\\"  Release date ! colspan=\\"2\\"  Same day viewership ! colspan=\\"2\\"  Three day viewership ! rowspan=\\"2\\" - !

On Rotten Tomatoes, the third season received an approval rating of 89% based on 132 reviews, and an average rating of 7.80/10. The site's critical consensus states, \\"Vibrant and charming, Stranger Things transforms itself into a riveting‚Äîif familiar‚Äîsummer ride that basks in its neon-laden nostalgia without losing sight of the rich relationships that make the series so endearing.\\" Writing in the New Statesman, Emily Bootle considered the third season an improvement on the second stating that the third \\"returned to strength\\" after a confusing second season and that \\"season three has largely brought back what made the show unique in the first place\\". Hugh Montgomery at the BBC awarded 5 stars, describing the third season as \\"an exhilarating example of a franchise hitting new heights that Hollywood would do well to learn from.\\" On Metacritic, the third season has a weighted average score of 72 out of 100, based on 25 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews.\\" On the dissenting side, Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly criticized the third season for looking like a Reagan-era pop culture mixtape. Ed Power of The Telegraph blamed Duffer Brothers for refusing \\"to stray from the Goonies- meets-Stephen King formula\\" and recycling their \\"well-worn bag of retro references to increasingly underwhelming effect\\", producing the limpest installment of the three. His opinion was echoed by Hank Stuever of The Washington Post, who felt almost heartbroken for \\"the Duffers working so hard to re-create an elusive vibe\\" of the 1980s with a \\"mishmash of ingredients\\" only to fail to create a fully entertaining show. Writing in National Review, Daniel Payne criticized the season's \\"sloppy storytelling\\" and \\"cornball humor\\" compared to the previous seasons, claiming that season three was \\"frenetic and bewildering where the first two seasons were slow, careful, and rewarding in crafting their plots.\\" =Accolades= As part of the 2019 Teen Choice Awards Stranger Things received a nomination for Choice Summer TV show. Caleb McLaughlin, Finn Wolfhard, Gaten Matarazzo, and Noah Schnapp were all nominated for Choice Summer TV actor for their work on the series while Millie Bobby Brown was nominated for Choice Summer TV actress for her work on the series. Stranger Things, Schnapp, and Brown all won awards in their respective categories.

It was created by Olusegun Obasanjo, the newly elected President of Nigeria, in 1999. Its mandate was to investigate human rights during the period of military rule from 1984 to 1999. In terms of reconciliation, the commission also worked towards unifying communities previously in conflict. The commission submitted its final report to President Obasanjo in 2002, but the government has not taken any action to date. Its report was not released to the public until 2005, when it was published by two activist groups, the Nigerian Democratic Movement and Nigeria-based Civil Society Forum.  Background  Nigeria was under British rule up until 1960. After independence, there were many internal conflicts within the country that limited Nigeria‚Äôs ability to consolidate. The country was divided along religious and ethnic lines which led to mass killings and eventually, a full civil war that would last until 1970. With Nigeria under the control of a military dictatorship following the 1966 Nigerian coup d'√©tat, other coups continued to take place. General Ibrahim Babangida, the head of the military juntas beginning in 1985, was forced out of power in 1993 due to the riots throughout the country following his decision to cancel the election. Under Defense Minister Sani Abacha, who took his place as president, violence continued. Abacha was accused of extensive human rights violations. After his death in 1998, an election saw Olusegun Obasanjo take power. Obasanjo embarked on reforms including the creation of the Human Rights Violations Investigation Commission.  Mandate  When first called into action, The Human Rights Violations Investigation Commission's main focus was human rights violations and cases of abuse under Nigeria's military regime between 1984 and 1999. The commission was also mandated to work towards reconciliation of the various communities and groups of people present in Nigeria that were in conflict with one another when under the military regime. Its investigation was to be carried out and completed over the course of three months. Over a period of time however, the commission shifted its main focus to \\"gross human rights violations\\" and demanded more time to carry out its investigation and to extend the period under investigation to include the events which occurred from 1966 to 1990.  Process  After this commission was created, it began with the process of taking into account the experiences of victims of the military regime. There was an outpouring of stories from Nigerians who explained the types or violations and abuses that they faced. The commission received up to 10,000 victim recollections with most reporting unfair treatment within the economic domain  more specifically, unfair treatment in the work place. Public hearings spanned more than a year, bringing the stories of the victims and perpetrators forward to the public as these hearings were televised on every occasion. Only 150 out of the 10,000 recollections of abuse that they received from victims were heard. Limited funds meant that investigation into the human rights violations was limited to the public hearings. The commission‚Äôs investigation consisted of * acquiring information about human rights violations through recollections provided by the victims * bringing to light the identity of those who were involved in committing these crimes, and * gaining a better understanding as to why these crimes were committed in the first place. The commission also played a role in establishing peace agreements between various Nigerian communities.  Findings and recommendations  The commission produced a report which concluded that the military‚Äôs control over the politics of Nigeria was one of the primary reasons for human rights violations and for continued political, social, and economic troubles in Nigeria. The commission also concluded that those who held positions of power, those who were a part of the military, and upper-class Nigerian citizens worked together to carry out the military coups. Furthermore, the commission concluded that the Ministry of Justice played a role in protecting those who were responsible for committing human rights violations. The commission recommended that victims be given reparations. Finally, it recommended that Nigeria focus on eliminating corruption, especially corruption within government.  Follow-up  The Human Rights Violations Investigation Commission of Nigeria submitted its final report to the president in 2002, but he did not bring the report to public attention. This decision reportedly was because of a case brought to the Supreme Court in 2003 by two former military leaders against the commission over its power to make them testify. Nigeria's Supreme Court ruled that the power to hold public hearings lies with the state governments of Nigeria and not the federal government, according to the Constitution of 1999. After this case, it was not until 2005 that two activist groups, the Nigerian Democratic Movement and Nigeria-based Civil Society Forum, finally published the commission‚Äôs report online. The report was already in the public realm, but the government limited its availability and accessibility. Subsequently, state governments in Nigeria began to establish their own truth and reconciliation commissions. The federal government has not implemented the commission;s recommendations. Following its reconciliation processes, the commission was successful in reconciling communities in Maroko village, in the Ogun State, and the various groups in Ogoni Island.

Her painting The Good Fruit of the Earth is part of the collections of the State Gallery of Contemporary Cypriot Art. Early life Loukia Nicolaidou was born in 1909 to a wealthy family in Limassol. After graduating from the School of Foreign and Greek Languages, she began a correspondence course with the ABC School in Paris. Encouraged by the painter Vasilis Vryonidis, she made the unusual decision to go abroad to study. At the time, women were not typically engaged in professions, as the expectation was that their role was that of wife and mother. She enrolled in 1929 at the Acad√©mie Colarossi, where she spent one year before Konstantinos Dimitriadis, helped her enroll in the √âcole Nationale des Beaux-Arts. One of the painters with whom she studied was Lucien Simon, who would influence her works. Graduating in 1933, she returned to Cyprus. Career Nicolaidou hosted her first solo exhibition in 1934, in Nicosia and Limassol, but the public response was unfavorable to her modern tendencies. Works painted by Nicolaidou between 1929 and 1933, during her schooling tended to embrace European ideals and focus on the female body and sexuality. Upon her return to Cyprus, her work continued to explore women's form, but did so in a more primitive style, reminiscent of Paul Gauguin. Her palate shifted to warmer hues and her figures took on a more exotic appearance, with darker skin tones and hair. Her chosen subject matter challenged the traditional depictions of women, as domestic mothers and wives, in Cypriot art, portraying them instead as educated and liberated members of a cosmopolitan and progressive society. As one of the few Cypriot painters of her period who painted nudes, Nicolaidou's works are unique, in that they did not focus on women as objects of desire, but instead, her subjects are defiant, tend to ignore the viewer rather than engaging with the audience, and are typically monumental in size. Other themes present in her works include scenes of every day life and landscapes. After hosting other solo shows in 1935 and 1936, with lukewarm reception from the public, Nicolaidou moved to London in 1937, where and older sister was living. Like many other Cypriot women artists, moving abroad in a self-exile, allowed Nicolaidou to pursue a career in art, out from under the patriarchal restrictions of society in her homeland. In England, her works became more expressive with a focus on geometrical shapes, influenced by Picasso. In 1939, she participated in a group exhibition for which she received acclaim. That same year, she married, Ioannis Vassiliou, a ship owner from Hermoupolis and withdrew from public exhibitions, focusing on raising a family.

Humphries and Opatow married unofficially in 2001, before marriage equality was legal. In an interview with Curve in 2013, Emma's Revolution talked about the \\"impact their music is making on changing the cultural view towards LGBT individuals.\\" Humphries and Opatow later separated as a couple, but continue to play together as a duo. = #IBelieveHer = In 2018, in response to the United States Senate Judiciary Committee hearing for the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination, Emma's Revolution released a song and video entitled \\"#IBelieveHer\\" in support of Christine Blasey Ford, who spoke out against Kavanaugh for allegedly sexually assaulting her 36 years prior.

The beer is brewed in the Mount St Bernard Abbey in Leicestershire.  Background  Mount St Bernard Abbey On 6 March 2017, the Trappist Mount St Bernard Abbey near Coalville, joined the International Trappist Association. In 2017-2018 a brewery was built in the abbey and from 9 July 2018 Tynt Meadow Trappist Ale, a dark beer, was released to the market. It is a dubbel ('double') beer. On 17 September 2018, the beer received the Authentic Trappist Products label and became the twelfth official Trappist beer. The beer is named after Tynt Meadow where the history of the abbey began in 1835. St Bernard could not be used as the name of the product due to the rights being assigned to the preexisting Belgian St. Bernardus Brewery. In July 2019, it was reported that the abbey had produced approximately 30,000 bottles of Tynt Meadow and that it was struggling to satisfy demand. The beer was said to have become particularly popular in Belgium and the Netherlands. However, as the brewery must remain secondary in importance to the monastery's work and way of life, it was unlikely that demand would be satisfied.

His declaration attracted endorsements from major stakeholders in Lagos State politics; including the Governor‚Äôs Advisory Council of the Lagos chapter of the All Progressives Congress and members of the Lagos State House of Assembly, which led to withdrawal of Dr. Femi Hamzat, a governorship aspirant on the platform of the All Progressives Congress APC in Lagos from the gubernatorial race. He won the Lagos gubernatorial primaries of the All Progressives Congress (APC) on 2 October 2018. At the APC flag-off campaign rally held on 8 January 2019, Governor of Lagos, Akinwunmi Ambode, and 63 political parties lent their support for the candidacy of Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu. In a landslide victory over his opponent, Jimi Agbaje, Sanwo-Olu was elected to the Office of Governor of Lagos State at the 2019 General elections for Lagos State which held on 9 March 2019.https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/live/tori-47468810 He was sworn in as the 15th Governor of Lagos State at the Tafawa Balewa Square (TBS) Lagos Island on Wednesday May 29, 2019. He has been working on different development activities, one of which is road construction across major areas in Lagos state. Recently, Babajide Sanwoolu asked that the statue of Fela Kuti that was erected by Akinwunmi Ambode be removed from Allen Avenue in Ikeja as he to ease the situation of traffic in that area. However, the statue is said to be relocated to a more convenient area in Lagos state. Controversy In April 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Sanwo-Olu was reported to have mismanaged relief funds for the pandemic. The PDP opposition party called for an enquiry into the expenditure. On 20 October, during the End SARS the governor imposed a 24-hour curfew starting a 4pm. This 4pm curfew was too soon and infeasible in the densely populated city, the start time was extended to 9pm. However, just before 7pm soldiers and policemen were deployed to disband peaceful protests with extreme force. This led to the shooting and killing of an unconfirmed number of peaceful protesters, leaving many others injured.  Awards  Babajide Olusola Sanwo-Olu has obtained a variety of awards in his career, some of which include: * Platinum award from the Lagos State Public Service Club. * 2009 Best in Human Capital Development award from the Industrial Training Fund (ITF). * Merit award from the Association of National Accountants of Nigeria. *Merit award from the Chartered Institute of Personnel Management in Nigeria (CIPMN). * Merit Award from the Association of Professional Women Engineers of Nigeria (APWEN). *LSDPC Impactful Leadership and Recognition Award.

It is a special case of a graph morphism: given a morphism f: X \\\\to Y over S, the graph morphism of it is X \\\\to X \\\\times_S Y induced by f and the identity 1_X. The diagonal embedding is the graph morphism of 1_X. By definition, X is a separated scheme over S (p: X \\\\to S is a separated morphism) if the diagonal morphism is a closed immersion. Also, a morphism p: X \\\\to S locally of finite presentation is an unramified morphism if and only if the diagonal embedding is an open immersion.  Explanation  As an example, consider an algebraic variety over an algebraically closed field k and p: X \\\\to \\\\operatorname{Spec}(k) the structure map. Then, identifying X with the set of its k-rational points, X \\\\times_k X = \\\\\\\\{ (x, y) \\\\in X \\\\times X \\\\\\\\} and \\\\delta: X \\\\to X \\\\times_k X is given as x \\\\mapsto (x, x); whence the name diagonal morphism.  Separated morphism  A separated morphism is a morphism f such that the fiber product of f with itself along f has its diagonal as a closed subscheme  in other words, the diagonal morphism is a closed immersion. As a consequence, a scheme X is separated when the diagonal of X within the scheme product of X with itself is a closed immersion. Emphasizing the relative point of view, one might equivalently define a scheme to be separated if the unique morphism X \\\\rightarrow \\\\textrm{Spec} (\\\\mathbb{Z}) is separated. Notice that a topological space Y is Hausdorff iff the diagonal embedding :Y \\\\stackrel{\\\\Delta}{\\\\longrightarrow} Y \\\\times Y, \\\\, y \\\\mapsto (y, y) is closed. In algebraic geometry, the above formulation is used because a scheme which is a Hausdorff space is necessarily empty or zero-dimensional. The difference between the topological and algebro-geometric context comes from the topological structure of the fiber product (in the category of schemes) X \\\\times_{\\\\textrm{Spec} (\\\\mathbb{Z})} X, which is different from the product of topological spaces. Any affine scheme Spec A is separated, because the diagonal corresponds to the surjective map of rings (hence is a closed immersion of schemes): :A \\\\otimes_{\\\\mathbb Z} A \\\\rightarrow A, a \\\\otimes a' \\\\mapsto a \\\\cdot a'. Let S be a scheme obtained by identifying two affine lines through the identity map except at the origins (see gluing scheme#Examples). It is not separated. Indeed, the image of the diagonal morphism S \\\\to S \\\\times S image has two origins, while its closure contains four origins.  Use in intersection theory  A classic way to define the intersection product of algebraic cycles A, B on a smooth variety X is by intersecting (restricting) their cartesian product with (to) the diagonal: precisely, :A \\\\cdot B = \\\\delta^*(A \\\\times B) where \\\\delta^* is the pullback along the diagonal embedding \\\\delta: X \\\\to X \\\\times X.

The gun had an early form of Krupp horizontal sliding-block breech and it fired separate-loading, bagged charges and projectiles.

The group's additional purpose was to advance the cause of women's suffrage and equal rights. Background Beginning at the end of the 1880s, plans were being prepared to create an exposition celebrating the 400th anniversary of the \\"discovery\\" of America (the quadro-centential). Women were organizing to become part of this exposition. Several cities were competing to host the exposition. The front-runners were Chicago, New York, St. Louis, and Washington D.C. By 1890 Chicago was selected as the site of the Exposition. At the same time, Congress decreed that there would be a \\"Board of Lady Managers\\" to address and organize the inclusion of women in the World's Columbian Exposition. Beginnings of the Queen Isabella Association As part of the run-up to the Exposition a group of professional women organized to bring their views of woman's place in society to the Exposition. The group believed that women were equal to men and were capable of pursuing professional careers outside the home. The group took as their inspiration Queen Isabella of Spain, who had made Columbus' voyage to the New World possible. Illinois Woman Suffrage Association founder Catharine Van Valkenburg Waite first suggested the idea of erecting a statue of Isabella. The Queen Isabella Association originally incorporated in Chicago in 1889. It soon expanded to chapters in New York, St. Louis, and Washington D.C. This expansion into a national organization was an attempt to have a voice outside Chicago advocating for the Exposition's site selection in Chicago. Membership Women could enroll in the Association for one dollar and could also buy shares for five dollars, to raise money for the statue. =Founding members= *President: Dr. Julia Holmes Smith *Vice President: Eliza Allen Starr *Treasurer: Catharine Van Valkenburg Waite *Corinne Stubbs Brown *Frances Hale Gardener *Dr. Frances Dickenson Ideology Members of the Queen Isabella Association were mostly professional women, part of the New Woman movement, who believed that women should take an equal part in society, working in professions alongside men. Controversy Members of the Association were referred to as \\"Isabellas\\". Their suffragette ideology was different from many other women's groups in Chicago, including the Chicago Women's Auxiliary. The Chicago Women's Auxiliary focus was on philanthropic work, making life better for poor women and children by improving education and sanitary conditions. They believed that women could serve society, but should deport themselves as ladies. This difference would carry over into how women wanted women represented at the Exposition. Specifically there were strong desires on each side to gain a position on the Board of Lady Managers. Phoebe Couzins, an Isabella, was elected as the Board Secretary. Her position was soon undermined by the Board's president Bertha Palmer, a well connected Chicago socialite. Palmer re-wrote the minutes of the first meeting, including altering the by-laws to give the board president more decision-making power. When Couzins complained she was removed from office. Queen Isabella Association at the Exposition As the planning of the Exposition continued the Isabellas were marginalized, finally reduced to having the Isabella Club House outside the fairgrounds It was located at 61st and Oglesby Avenue. The Isabellas also ran the Isabella Hotel in the property next door. They held the \\"Meeting of Women Lawyers\\" at the Club House on August 3‚Äì5, 1983. =The sculpture of Queen Isabella= The group commissioned the statue from sculptor Harriet Hosmer, herself a member of the Queen Isabella Society. Hosmer completed the statue, but the Isabellas did not have the funds to purchase it. She rejected an offer from Bertha Palmer to purchase the statue for the Woman's Building and instead sold it to Harriet Williams Russell Strong who had it placed out side the Pampas Place of the California Building at the World's Columbian Exposition.

The show debuted on September 8, 2018 in Canada on Teletoon and in the United States on the Amazon Prime subscription streaming video service on October 6, 2019. Characters =Heroes= * Derek Dynamo (voiced by Valin Shinyei) - The fun-loving, highly intelligent and energetic son of Dr. Dexter Dynamo. Alongside his father and best friend Super Dinosaur, Derek works for Earthcore, protecting the planet from various hazards. He rides around on Wheels, a robot he built. * Super Dinosaur (voiced by Mac Heywood) - A genetically-altered Tyrannosaurus rex created by Max Maximus, Super Dinosaur lives with the Dynamo family in the Dynamo Dome and is the best friend of Derek, who often refers to him as \\"SD\\". He is a vegetarian, and he loves to play video games and ride skateboards. In battle, he uses an interchangeable harness with robotic arms. He accidentally adopted a penguin as a pet on a mission. * Dr. Dexter Dynamo (voiced by Alessandro Juliani) - Derek's father, a genius who helps create the gear his son and Super Dinosaur use on their missions. His cognitive abilities are diminished after Max Maximus poisons him with a mind-decaying virus though this was later reversed by an invention of Dr Dynamo's old friend Dr Oliver Manchester in the season 1 finale. * The Kingstons - A family of mechanics sent to live in the Dynamo Dome by General Casey; responsible for building and repairing Derek and Super Dinosaur's combat equipment Bruce Kingston (voiced by Brian Dobson) - The husband of Sarah, and father of Erin and Erica Sarah Kingston (voiced by Kathleen Barr) - The wife of Bruce, and mother of Erin and Erica Erin Kingston (voiced by Shannon Chan-Kent) - A charismatic and curious girl who makes quick friends with Derek upon the Kingston's arrival to the Dynamo Dome. She is fascinated by all the amazing technology created by Doctor Dynamo and Derek and responds to her family's move much more positively than her sister. Derek builds her Pixie, a robot similar to Wheels and joins Earthcore's cadet program. Erica Kingston (voiced by Shannon Chan-Kent) - Annoyed about moving from Washington D.C., she is initially far less receptive to the Dynamos than her sister. She has a pet spider named Sherman. Unlike her sister, Erica cares little about Earthcore and is more drawn to the arts. * General Casey (voiced by Dean Redman) - The Earthcore military administrator to the Dynamos and their super-heroic activities; oversees the majority of their funding, deployment into combat situations, and imprisonment of defeated super-villains at Earthcore Headquarters.  Elliot Casey (voiced by Tevon Herbert) - General Casey's son, who is around Derek's age; he is shown to be impulsive and pulls a dangerous prank on the Dynamo Dome to get his father's attention. He uses multiple aliases throughout the series (one of them being Battle Shock which includes using a giant mech) and eventually is allowed to join the Earthcore cadet training program. He later helps capture Terropterx although he ends up being captured by him and partially transformed into a Dino-Men =Villains= * Max Maximus (voiced by Marco Soriano) - An evil scientist who created Dynore, an incredibly powerful energy source. He seeks to destroy the Dynamos and take control of the world. He commands an army of genetically-engineered Dino-Men from his lair, Castle Maximus.  Minimus (voiced by Sean Thomas) - The artificial \\"son\\" of Maximus who was created via cloning, and initially pretended to be friendly to gain Derek's Trust under the alias of Tom Tillred. He became leader of the Dino-Men upon his \\"father's\\" incarceration, and later wrests control of the Sharkmen from Squidious. However close to the season 1 finale when Max Maximus returns to power he is transformed into a half human half dinosaur form named Tyrannosaurus X (voiced by Andrew Francis). * Dino- Men (voiced by various) - Maximus' army of genetically-engineered human/dinosaur hybrids. While most are little more than subservient, dimwitted henchmen, there are a few who are highly intelligent, as detailed below.  Tricerachops (voiced by Kathleen Barr) - A female Triceratops who wields a battle-axe. She is Maximus' most favored servant and is shown to be more empathetic than other Dino-Men. After her morals are tested, she defects from Maximus' army and forms the Dino Liberation Front.  Dreadasaurus (voiced by Chris Nielsen) - A Stegosaurus with a shield that shoots spikes. Like Tricerachops, he defected from Maximus' army, and now serves under her in the Dino Liberation Front.  Terroropterx (voiced by Bart Batchelor) - A pterodactyl with shoulder-mounted weaponry and dual sabers.

History Paragon Gaming was founded in 2000 by cousins Diana Bennett and Scott Menke, who were experienced gaming executives and the daughter and nephew, respectively, of prominent casino owner William Bennett. The company began working with American Indian tribes, seeking opportunities to develop tribal casinos. In 2001, Paragon proposed to develop a casino at the Channel Islands Harbor in Oxnard, California on behalf of a yet-to-be-determined tribe. In the face of opposition from local officials, the company withdrew the proposal and announced a new plan to build a casino at the Oxnard Factory Outlet with the Greenville Rancheria of Maidu Indians. This plan, too, provoked strong opposition, and was rejected by the city council. Later in 2001, Paragon announced a deal to develop a casino near Palm Springs, California for the Augustine Band of Cahuilla Mission Indians. The project drew some attention because the tribe had only one adult member; critics questioned the seemliness of developers profiting from a casino that would benefit so few Indians. The Augustine Casino opened in 2002 at a cost of $16 million. Meanwhile, the company worked with First Nations bands in Alberta to lobby for regulations that would allow tribes to open casinos. When those efforts succeeded in 2002, Paragon partnered with the Enoch Cree Nation to develop a casino hotel in Edmonton. The $178-million River Cree Resort and Casino opened in October 2006. Paragon operated and co-owned the casino until 2014, when the Enoch Cree bought out the company's interests. In September 2006, the company purchased the bankrupt Edgewater Casino, located at the Plaza of Nations in Vancouver, for $43 million. In 2008, Paragon opened the Eagle River Casino and Travel Plaza at the Alexis Whitecourt Indian Reserve in northern Alberta. Paragon owned a 40 percent share of the property, with the Alexis First Nation owning the rest. The casino's revenues fell short of expectations, and it went into bankruptcy by 2014; Paragon was left with no stake in it. In 2013, Paragon assumed management of the struggling Riviera hotel and casino on the Las Vegas Strip on behalf of Starwood Capital. The Riviera closed in May 2015. Later that month, Paragon took over management of the nearby Westgate Las Vegas under a lease from Westgate Resorts. The company transferred many of its employees and bookings from the Riviera to the Westgate. In 2014, Paragon began construction of the Parq Vancouver, a $600-million hotel and casino complex at the BC Place stadium. The Parq opened in 2017, and the Edgewater Casino, which it replaced, closed on the same day. In 2019, Paragon sold its stake in the Parq to one of the property's other co-owners. The company added two more Nevada casinos to its portfolio in 2016, assuming management of the Hooters Casino Hotel near the Las Vegas Strip and acquiring a majority stake in the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Lake Tahoe.

The Wilderness Society has designated the area as a ‚ÄúMountain Treasure‚Äù.Virginia's Mountain Treasures, report issued by The Wilderness Society, May, 1999 One of the most visited locations in the Mount Rogers National Recreation area, the Mount Rogers Crest Zone offers scenic views of nearby Rhododendron Gap and other high points, and a diversity of boreal species in lands surrounding Mount Rogers, the highest point in Virginia. The area is part of the Mount Rogers Cluster. Location and access Boundary of the Mount Rogers Crest Zone wildarea as identified by the Wilderness Society.Scales from the Virginia Highlands TrailThe area is located in the Appalachian Mountains of Southwestern Virginia about 5 miles southwest of Troutdale, Virginia between the Lewis Fork Wilderness Area and the Little Wilson Creek Wilderness Area. The Appalachian Trail passes through the area for about 6 miles as the trail goes between Lewis Fork Wilderness and Little Wilson Creek Wilderness. Other trails into the area include: *Virginia Highlands Horse Trail, Forest Service 337, 62.3 miles *Old Orchard Trail, FS 4533A, 1.63 miles *Old Orchard Spur Trail, FS 4596, 1.66 miles *Wilburn Ridge Trail, FS 4597, 0.67 miles Pine Mountain Road, Rt. 613, gives access to the Scales area on the north but is seasonally closed. The boundary of the wildland as determined by the Wilderness Society is shown in the adjacent map. Additional roads and trails are given on National Geographic Maps 786 (Mount Rogers). and Map 318 (Mount Rogers High Country) A great variety of information, including topographic maps, aerial views, satellite data and weather information, is obtained by selecting the link with the wild land‚Äôs coordinates in the upper right of this page. Beyond maintained trails, old logging roads can be used to explore the area. The Appalachian Mountains were extensively timbered in the early twentieth century leaving logging roads that are becoming overgrown but still passable. Old logging roads and railroad grades can be located by consulting the historical topographic maps available from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The Mount Rogers Crest Zone wildarea is covered by USGS topographic maps Troutdale' and Whitetop Mountain. Natural history On the north side, with cool and wet colluvial drainages, the overstory is dominated by yellow popular, northern red oak, white oak, basswood, cucumber tree, white ash, eastern hemlock and red maple. A significant northern hardwood forest community, between 4000- and 4800-feet elevation, is dominated by American beech, yellow birch, sugar maple, mountain maple and striped maple. Above 4200 feet red spruce is found throughout the area. Although most of the timber is in the 21-100 year old age class, there are areas at high elevations where logging was limited by steep and rocky slopes. Here mature northern hardwood communities exist, a submesotrophic forest. The area contains two rare plants, the Blue Ridge St. Johns wort and mountain rattle snake root, as well as rare sub-species of the northern flying squirrel. While the northern flying squirrel is relatively common, the subspecies is extremely rare and is listed as Federally endangered. There is some old growth forest on Brier Ridge. Parts of Big Wilson Creek, Mount Rogers, and Pine Mountain special biological areas are found here. Unique aspects of these areas are Virginia‚Äôs largest high elevation peat bog, wetlands and seeps with rare herbs, birds and salamanders. It has a spot with one of the highest concentrations of rare species and significant plant communities in the state. Five streams, Solomon Branch, Opossum Creek, Little Wilson Creek, Middle Fork of Helton Creek and Cabin Creek, are recognized for their water quality. Wild natural trout streams in Virginia are classified by the Department of Game and Inland Fisheries by their water quality, with class i the highest and class iv the lowest.9VAC25-260-370.

Topography View southeast along Wilburn RidgeAs part of the Southern Blue Ridge Mountains Subsection within the Central Appalachian Broadleaf Coniferous Forest-Meadow Province, there are tectonic uplifted mountain ranges composed of igneous and metamorphic rock with many high gradient, deeply incised streams. Pine Mountain is a dominant peak in the area. Forest Service management The original report by the Wilderness Society, published in 1999, included seven areas; Little Wilson Creek Addition A, 78 acres; Addition B, 1724 acres; Addition C, 60 acres; Lewis Fork Addition A, 600 acres; Addition B, 270 acres; and Addition C, 95 acres; as well as the Crest Zone Bald Management Area, 3444 acres. With adjacent Little Wilson Creek Wilderness, Lewis Fork Wilderness and Grayson Highlands, a contiguous environment is formed for expanded wilderness opportunities. With passage of the Omnibus Public Lands Act of 2009, Little Wilson Creek Additions A and B were added to the Little Wilson Creek Wilderness, and Lewis Fork Addition B was added to the Lewis Fork Wilderness leaving the additions considered here without the protection offered by wilderness designation. The Forest Service has conducted a survey of their lands to determine the potential for wilderness designation. Wilderness designation provides a high degree of protection from development. The areas that were found suitable are referred to as inventoried roadless areas. Later a Roadless Rule was adopted that limited road construction in these areas. The rule provided some degree of protection by reducing the negative environmental impact of road construction and thus promoting the conservation of roadless areas. Except for Lewis Fork Addition A, the areas considered here were not inventoried in the roadless area review, and therefore not protected from possible road construction and timber sales. Most of the area is managed as part of the ‚Äú5100 acre Crest Zone Special Area‚Äù with 2200 acres of the Crest Zone designated as ‚Äúopen area management‚Äù that allows grazing, prescribed burning, mechanical cutting, and herbicides. Livestock grazing across 3661 acres of the Crest Zone (65%) was allowed by the Forest Service in 1997 with permits generally given from May 1 to October 31. In 2003 a new policy was adopted to monitor increasing demand. As a result, group size is limited to 10 persons across the entire High Country thus extending this restriction beyond the areas with wilderness designation. The use of horses and bicycles was restricted to designated trails; two trails and 64 backcountry campsites were closed; and camping was restricted to established sites. With the demands that horses place on soils and other resources, the surface of many horse trails have been hardened. Cultural history A survey of cultural resources found two prehistoric sites, a basecamp and a transient camp.

Winslow (1836-1936) was an American activist, newspaper editor, and author of several temperance books. She served at two separate times, and during the longest period of any editor-in-chief of Our Union, the national organ of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU). It was a burst of inspiration from Winslow, relative to its simplicity and purity, which at the National WCTU Convention in Chicago determined the union to wear the white ribbon as a badge rather than the red, white, and blue which was strongly urged by many. Early years and education Margaret Elizabeth Winslow was born in New York City, in 1836. She was of Puritan antecedents, and spent most of her life in Brooklyn, and Saugerties on the Hudson River. Winslow signed the pledge and wrote temperance compositions when but eight years old. At fifteen, she declined to come into the parlor on New Year's Day if wine was offered, and carried her point. She was educated partly at the Abbot Institution in New York, and partly at Packer Collegiate Institute, of which she was a graduate. Career =Teacher= For twelve years, Winslow taught at Packer Institute. The last year of her stay, she held the position of composition teacher, and had charge of the Art Department of Pictures, Coins, and so forth. At the age of nineteen, she united with the Episcopal church, of which she remained a loyal member. She spent 1869‚Äì70 in Europe studying and traveling in England, France, Italy, and Germany. She became acquainted with many foreign Protestants, and on coming home was made one of Albert Woodruffs \\"Foreign Sunday School Association\\" (Italian Committee). =Activist= The Women's Crusade (1873‚Äì74) in Ohio roused her interest and enthusiasm. Dr. Diocletian Lewis came to Brooklyn fresh from the great awakening in Ohio. The Packer Institute teacher attended several temperance prayer-meetings, and was present at the one (March 17, 1874) at which the first Brooklyn WCTU was organized. Desiring to attend the daily meetings which followed, she persuaded the editor of the New York Witness to accept reports, and every day for fourteen weeks, went directly from school to the YMCA in Brooklyn, where these meetings were held. Here was uttered her first public testimony for Christ. One evening, Winslow went with fifteen women to a prayer meeting in a liquor saloon. In a letter to one of her friends she thus graphically describes the scene:‚Äî From that time, Winslow spoke at temperance gatherings, missions, prisons, and other places, in Brooklyn and elsewhere. She also took part in Dwight L. Moody's work in Brooklyn, and later in New York. Later on, she went to Florida. In 1877, at the National WCTU Convention in Farwell Hall, Chicago, there was much controversy as to what should be the badge of the WCTU. Some advocated royal purple, and some the red, white and blue. The committee first recommended a badge of royal purple and violet; this was amended to a bow of white ribbon with a cross of red and an anchor of blue combined, woven in the fabric and stamped with the initials, ‚ÄúW. C. T. U.‚Äù Winslow rose at the crisis of the debate and made an inspired speech on the superior symbolic meaning of the white ribbon as the badge. She moved to substitute a bow of white ribbon with ‚ÄúW. C. T. U.‚Äù in gold letters. After much discussion, this was finally adopted by the convention. =Editor, writer= Winslow attended the National WCTU Convention held in Newark, 1876, where she was chosen editor of Our Union. She declined re-appointment to the position for a principle‚Äî because she objected to the Home Protection movement. Becoming somewhat less conservative, she accepted this position again in 1880, and retained it until the paper was united with The Signal in 1883. In 1880, Winslow began writing for the press, her works appearing in the New York Observer, New York Evangelist, Independent, Christian Union, Churchman, Christian at Work, Christian Advocate, Christian Register, Sunday School Times, and St. Nicholas. She was the author of five or six story books, published by the National Temperance Society, American Sunday School Union, and others. She also wrote poetry, and lyrics to hymns, including \\"Intercede for Us\\", \\"Waiting for Thy Coming\\", and \\"We Shall Know Each Other There\\". She died in 1936.

Originally Reeve's picture and r√©sum√© was rejected many times and Reeve thought that he would not get the part after being self-described as a \\"skinny WASP.\\"Richard Donner, Tom Mankiewicz, Ilya Salkind, Pierre Spengler, David Prowse, You Will Believe: The Cinematic Saga of Superman, 2006, Warner Home Video His appearance was originally very slim. He refused to wear fake muscles and instead went on a training regimen, supervised by former British weightlifting champion David Prowse, which consisted of running in the morning, followed by two hours of weightlifting and ninety minutes on a trampoline. Reeve also doubled his food intake and adopted a high protein diet. He added of muscle to his thin frame. He later made even greater gains for Superman III (1983), though for Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987), he decided it would be healthier to focus more on cardiovascular workouts. One of the reasons Reeve could not work out as much for Superman IV: The Quest for Peace was an emergency appendectomy he had undergone in June 1986.Rossen, Jake. \\"Superman Vs.

Dunlap. \\"New York Day by Day; Appendectomy Centenary.\\" The New York Times. The New York Times Company, June 26, 1986. Web. August 16, 2018. Reeve was never a Superman or comic book fan, though he had watched the television program Adventures of Superman starring George Reeves. Reeve found the role offered a suitable challenge because it was a dual role. He said, \\"there must be some difference stylistically between Clark and Superman. Otherwise, you just have a pair of glasses standing in for a character\\". =Jeff East= Jeff East portrays teenage Clark Kent. His lines were overdubbed by Reeve during post-production. \\"I was not happy about it because the producers never told me what they had in mind\\", East commented. \\"It was done without my permission but it turned out to be okay. Chris did a good job but it caused tension between us. We resolved our issues with each other years later.\\" East tore several thigh muscles while performing the stunt of racing alongside the train. It took three to four hours each day to add prosthetic makeup to his face so he resembled Reeve. Portrayal and characteristics Christopher Reeve modeled his portrayal of Clark Kent on Cary Grant's performance in Bringing Up Baby (as depicted right) Christopher Reeve first imagined the approach of his role on a flight to London. He felt that in the 1970s, the masculine image had changed and that it was acceptable \\"for a man to show gentleness and vulnerability\\". He also felt \\"that the new Superman ought to reflect that contemporary male image\\". Reeve would base his portrayal of Clark Kent, Superman's alter ego, on Cary Grant's performance for his role in Bringing Up Baby.Reeve, Christopher (1998), pp 195‚Äì197 Superman's personality as depicted in the films is a do gooder with little or no conflict who stands for \\"truth, justice and the American way\\" ‚Äî a recurring theme shared by the character in the original The Adventures of Superman radio program. The noble Superman portrayed by Reeve, though, hides his secret identity by pretending to be an awkward and apprehensive reporter named Clark Kent. Lois Lane is indifferent to him but shares his obsession over Superman. Reeve felt that even though Superman upholds \\"truth, justice, and the American way\\" there was nothing self-conscious about him ‚Äî that was simply what he believed in. Themes The Superman character has been cited as a metaphor for Christ and has actions compared to many religious themes. Many have noted the examples of apparent Christian symbolism. Donner, Tom Mankiewicz and Ilya Salkind have commented on the use of Christian references when discussing the themes of Superman. Mankiewicz deliberately fostered analogies with Jor-El as God and Kal-El as Jesus. Donner is somewhat skeptical of Mankiewicz' actions, joking,\\"I got enough death threats because of that\\".Richard Donner, Tom Mankiewicz, DVD audio commentary, 2001, Warner Home VideoIlya Salkind, Pierre Spengler, DVD audio commentary, 2006, Warner Home Video The mythic status of Superman is enhanced by events that recall the hero's journey (or monomyth) as described by Joseph Campbell. Each act has a discernible cycle of \\"call\\" and journey. The journey is from Krypton to Earth in the first act, from Smallville to the Fortress of Solitude in the second act, and then from Metropolis to the whole world in the third act. The spacecraft that brings Kal-El to Earth is shaped in the form of a star (Star of Bethlehem). Kal-El comes to Jonathan and Martha Kent, who are unable to have children. Martha Kent states, \\"All these years how we've prayed and prayed that the good Lord would see fit to give us a child\\" ‚Äî comparing her to the Virgin Mary. 200px Just as little is known about Jesus during his middle years, Clark travels into the wilderness to find out who he is and what he has to do. Jor-El says > Live as one of them, Kal-El, to discover where your strength and power are > needed. But always hold in your heart the pride of your special heritage. > They can be a great people, Kal-El, and they wish to be. They only lack the > light to show the way. For this reason above all, their capacity for good, I > have sent them you, my only son. The theme resembles the Biblical account of God sending his only son Jesus to Earth for the good of mankind. More symbolism was seen when Donner was able to complete Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut, featuring the fall, resurrection and battle with evil, which parallels the crucifixion of Jesus, the resurrection and the Harrowing of Hell. Another vision was that of The Creation of Adam. The Christian imagery in the Reeve films has provoked comment on the Jewish origin of Superman. Rabbi Simcha Weinstein's book Up, Up and Oy Vey: How Jewish History, Culture and Values Shaped the Comic Book Superhero, says that Superman is both a pillar of society and one whose cape conceals a \\"nebbish\\", saying \\"He's a bumbling, nebbish Jewish stereotype. He's Woody Allen.\\" Ironically, it is also in the Reeve films that Clark Kent's persona has the greatest resemblance to Woody Allen, though his conscious model was Cary Grant's character in Bringing Up Baby. This same theme is mirrored in other 1940s superheroes. In the scene where Lois Lane interviews Superman on the balcony, Superman replies, \\"I never lie\\". Salkind felt this was an important point in the film, since Superman, living under his secret identity as Clark Kent, is \\"telling the biggest lie of all time\\". His romance with Lois also leads him to contradict Jor-El's orders to avoid altering human history, time traveling to save her from dying. Superman instead takes the advice of Jonathan Kent, his father on Earth. One of the most important aspects in the first and second films was the romantic relationship between the two main characters; Clark was hopelessly in love with Lois and even gave up his powers to be with her as depicted in Superman II. Role in the franchise The Superman costume used in the film at the Hollywood Museum The Superman film relates the origin of Superman as it depicts baby Kal-El escaping from the doomed planet Krypton to Earth. It tells of his life in Smallville to Metropolis, where he falls in love with Lois Lane and goes up against the villain Lex Luthor. Superman II focuses more on his romance with Lois and depicts him battling the Kryptonians, General Zod, Ursa and Non. In Superman III, he is reunited with his high school crush, Lana Lang. He deals with an evil businessman who forces a computer hacker to create technology that plays havoc with the world, while turning Superman evil. Superman IV: The Quest for Peace shows Superman deciding to rid the world of all nuclear missiles. Once again he comes face to face with Luthor and his new creation from Superman's DNA called Nuclear Man. Christopher Reeve was originally planned to make a cameo appearance in the 1984 Supergirl spin-off film starring Helen Slater as Superman's cousin, but bowed out early on.You Will Believe: The Cinematic Saga of Superman (Redemption), Warner Home Video, 2006. Film appearances =Superman (1978)= In 1973, producer Ilya Salkind convinced his father Alexander to buy the rights to Superman. They hired Mario Puzo to pen a two-film script, and negotiated with Steven Spielberg to direct, though Alexander Salkind eventually chose someone else. Marlon Brando and Gene Hackman signed on to play Jor-El and Lex Luthor respectively, and Guy Hamilton was hired to direct. However, Brando was faced with an obscenity lawsuit in Italy over Last Tango in Paris, and Hamilton was unable to shoot in England as he had violated his tax payments. The Salkinds hired Richard Donner to direct the film. Donner hired Tom Mankiewicz to polish the script, giving it a serious feel with Christ-like overtones. Christopher Reeve was cast as Superman. The film was a success both critically and commercially; being released during the Christmas season of 1978, it did not have much competition, leading the producers to believe that this was one factor in the film's success.Pierre Spangler, Look up in the Sky! The Amazing Story of Superman. =Superman II (1980)= Shooting of the two films was marred by Donner's bad relationship with the Salkinds, with Richard Lester acting as mediator. With the film going over-budget, the filmmakers decided to temporarily cease production of II and move that film's climax into the first film. Despite Superman's success, Donner did not return to finish Superman II, and it was completed with Lester, who gave the film a more tongue-in-cheek tone. Superman II was another financial and critical success, despite stiff competition with Raiders of the Lost Ark in the same year. In 2006, after receiving many requests for his own version of Superman II, Richard Donner and producer Michael Thau produced their own cut of the film and released it on November 28, 2006. The new version of the film received positive response from critics and the stars of the original film. =Superman Returns (2006)= Brandon Routh in 2006 Following several unsuccessful attempts to reboot the franchise, Bryan Singer, who was said to be a childhood fan of Richard Donner's film, was approached by Warner Bros to direct a new Superman film. He accepted, abandoning two films already in pre-production, X-Men: The Last Stand (which, coincidentally, would come to be directed by Ratner) and a remake of Logan's Run. The film acts as a soft reboot of the franchise and uses the events of Superman and, to less of a degree, Superman II as a backstory, while directly not referencing the events of Superman III and Superman IV: The Quest for Peace. Singer's story tells of Superman's return to Earth following a five-year search for survivors of Krypton. He discovers that in his absence Lois Lane has given birth to a son and become engaged. Singer chose to follow Donner's lead by casting relatively unknown Brandon Routh as Superman, who resembled Christopher Reeve somewhat, and more high-profile actors in supporting roles, such as Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor. Singer brought his entire crew from X2 to work on the film. Via digitally-enhanced archive footage, the late Marlon Brando appeared in the film as Jor-El. Superman Returns received mixed reviews and grossed approximately $391 million worldwide. Routh later reprised his role as Superman in the 2019 Arrowverse crossover \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\". Other appearances =Superman III (1983)= For the third installment, Ilya Salkind wrote a treatment that expanded the film's scope to a cosmic scale, introducing the villains Brainiac and Mister Mxyzptlk, as well as Supergirl. Warner Bros. rejected it and created their own Superman III film that co-starred Richard Pryor as computer wizard Gus Gorman, who under the manipulation of a millionaire magnate, creates a form of Kryptonite that turns the Man of Steel into an evil self. The retooled script pared Brainiac down into the film's evil \\"ultimate computer\\". Despite the film's success, fans were disappointed with the film, in particular with Pryor's performance diluting the serious tone of the previous films, as well as controversy over the depiction of the evil Superman. Salkind's rejected proposal was later released online in 2007. =Supergirl (1984)= Slater at Florida Supercon in 2016 Upon gaining the rights for the film Superman, Alexander Salkind and his son, Ilya Salkind, also purchased the rights to the character of Superman's cousin Supergirl. Supergirl was released in 1984 as a spin-off of the Reeve films; Reeve was slated to have a cameo but he ultimately backed out of the production, although his likeness appears in a photo.You Will Believe: The Cinematic Saga of Superman (Redemption), Warner Home Video, 2006. It stars Helen Slater in her first motion picture in the title role, while Faye Dunaway (who received top billing) played the primary villain, Selena; the film also featured Marc McClure reprising his role as Jimmy Olsen. Even though the film performed poorly at the box office, Helen Slater was nominated for a Saturn Award. =Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987)= Cannon Films picked up an option for a fourth Superman/Reeve film, with Reeve reprising the role due to his interest in the film's topic regarding nuclear weapons. However, Cannon decided to cut the budget resulting in poor special effects and heavy re- editing, which contributed to the film's poor reception. Warner Bros. decided to give the series a break following the negative reception of the last two Superman films. Reception The character and the portrayal by Christopher Reeve has garnered positive reviews from film critics and many other journalists. American Film Institute ranked Reeve's take on Superman in the first film as the 26th greatest hero of all time in their AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes & Villains list. Business Insider placed Reeve's Superman as the fourth greatest superhero film performance out of twenty, while The Hollywood Reporter placed it at number three out of fifty top performances in a superhero film. In 2009, Entertainment Weekly placed Superman third on its list of the coolest heroes in pop culture. Mark Hughes of Forbes felt that Reeve portrays both Superman and Clark Kent like two different people, and that it felt like watching two different actors on the screenscreen. Ben Kuchera of Polygon opined that the \\"performance as both Clark Kent and Superman kept the characters distinct, and it was done through his body\\".

He finished his college basketball career at Baylor after two years at Concordia University and Indian Hills Community College.  Early life and high school  Omot was born in a refugee camp in Nairobi, Kenya to Pillow and Kwot Omot. His parents and brother Aba lived in the camp for three years, following a dangerous 440-mile journey from Gambela, Ethiopia to the Kenyan border in escape from an ongoing civil war. They were arrested, spending one week in prison, before being freed with help from the United Nations and settling in the camp, which was crowded and did not provide adequate food. In 1996, Omot's mother and siblings moved to Minnesota with the help of Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service. However, his father was barred from the United States due to medical reasons. Living in Minnesota, Omot was looked after by his brother Aba, while his mother worked two jobs at Menards and Burlington Coat Factory to support the family. Omot first began playing football as a wide receiver, but he started playing basketball after a growth spurt. He also played soccer but basketball soon became his primary focus. As a junior in high school, Omot joined the junior varsity basketball team at Mahtomedi High School in Mahtomedi, Minnesota. He moved up to varsity in his senior season, averaging 18 points, 6 rebounds, and 2 assists. Omot earned All-Conference and honorable mention All-State accolades in his final year at Mahtomedi. Still, he failed to earn any NCAA Division I scholarship offers in high school.  College career  Omot began his college career at Concordia in NCAA Division II and redshirted his freshman season, growing almost three inches. In 2014-15, he averaged 12.4 points and 5.5 rebounds per game, shooting 58 percent from the floor and 42 percent from behind the arc. In order to get more Division I exposure, Omot transferred to Indian Hills Community College. He averaged 12.2 points and 5.4 rebounds per game and started 33 games in one of the top junior college programs. He was named to the first-team all-conference and NJCAA Honorable mention All-American. Omot accepted a scholarship to Baylor on November 12, 2015. Omot was forced to miss the fall semester of 2016 due to of academic reasons and played limited minutes the rest of the year. His best performance was scoring 14 points in a 74-64 win over Texas on January 18, 2017. He averaged 4.0 points and 1.9 rebounds per game. Omot put in a lot of work in the summer of 2017 to improve his game. Omot began his senior season with 15 points against Central Arkansas and had 12 points the following game against Texas A&M;‚ÄìCorpus Christi. He registered a career-high 30 points in a 105-82 win over Randall on December 9, 2017. However, Omot struggled to start Big 12 play and was replaced in the starting lineup by Mark Vital. In a loss to Oklahoma on January 31, 2018, Omot scored 23 points and hit all six three- point attempts. On February 20, in a game against West Virginia, Omot met his father for the first time in 21 years. As a senior, Omot averaged 9.9 points, 3.6 rebounds and 1.7 assists per game. He shot 48.9 percent from the field and 43.3 percent on three-pointers, which was fifth in the Big 12 Conference.

The kennel turned out to be heavily defended by Panamanian Defense Forces (PDF). Her team used a bullhorn to tell them to surrender and also fired warning shots. When their warnings went unheeded, they opened fire. The PDF returned it. The battle lasted three hours before the kennel was secured. Her team killed three and captured one prisoner.

Fallout  The news about Bray was on the cover of many newspapers during the Panama Invasion. She claimed to have been surprised to see attention focused on her gender, rather than showcasing the accomplishments of the troops. This caused issues for her career and led to debates over women's rights in the military. As a result of experiences of women in Operation Just Cause, Rep. Patricia Schroeder drafted legislation (H.R. 3868) that would allow women to serve in combat on a test basis. It did not pass. This fueled the Direct Ground Combat Definition and Assignment Rule issued by the Department of Defense in 1994. It excluded women from engaging in combat. It was not until January 24, 2013 that this rule was rescinded by Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta. Bray said she was \\"thrilled\\" and \\"excited\\" when the ban was lifted. \\"I think it's absolutely wonderful that our nation's military is taking steps to help women break the glass ceiling.\\"  Retirement  Bray retired from the Army on April 16, 1991 due to a noncombat injury. She injured herself during training, at about the time she needed surgery for her hips. She claimed it was her fault because she carried too much weight during a training exercise.  Personal life  She married John Raymond \\"Randy\\" Bray III on December 6, 1983, whom she met while stationed in Germany. Bray is currently a recruiter in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.

History The village of Aastrup is mentioned several times in written records from the Middle Ages. In the early 16th century it was dissolved its farms merged under a manor with the same name. The first owner of the manor was Erik Krabbe; He was the son of rigsmarsk Tyge Krabbe was a central figure in the uprise against Christian II (1481-1559). Erik Krabbe instigated that Saxo Gramaticus's Danmarkskr√∏nike from the 12th century was republished in 1534. Aster Krabbe's death in 1564, Aastrup was passed to his son Glob Krabbe, Glob Krabbe's brother Christian Krabbe inherited the estate in 1582. He sold it to treasurer Enevold Kruse in circa 1596 when he marriage to Else Marsvin. He constructed a new main building in circa 1613. The estate remained in the hands of the Kruse family until it was purchased by J√∏rgen Seefeld in 1641. Peder Lauridsen Scavenius purchased the estate in 1664. He belonged to the new nobility that was appointed by Frederick III in the early days of the Absolute monarchy. After Scavenius' death, Aastrup was passed on to his son-in-law Niels Benzon Aastrup and then his grandson Peder Benzon. Peder Benzon was also the owner of a number of other estates, including Benzonseje, Benzonsdal and Gislingegaard. Gregers Juel purchased Aastrup in 1714. He was an army officer but left the army when he missed a promotion in 1716. Johannes Eichel purchased Aastrup in 1736 and turned it into a stamhus for his family later that same year. The effect of a stamhus was that the estate could no longer be sold or divided between heirs. In 1803 the stamhus was dissolved with royal approval and Aastrup was then purchased by Ulrik Christian Von Schmidten in 1806 as a speculative investment. Marie Kofoed Hans Peder Kofoed, a merchant and shipowner, purchased the estate in 1810. His widow Marie Kofoed kept it after his death in 1812. She made large donations to charity and created a number of grants for indigent people on the estate. Aastrup depicted by Ferdinand Richardt in 1844 Frederik Vilhelm Dannemand, an illegitimate son of Frederik VI, purchased the estate in 1842. He turned the estate into a stift for unmarried women and widows of his onw family. Its official name was Det Grevelige Dannemandske Stift but was also referred to as Aastrup Kloster. The institution struggled with poor economy from the start and in 1884 Frederik Vilhelm Dannemand finally chose to sell Aastrup to Frederik Brockdorff. The sale resulted in a lawsuit and was overruled in 1890. The estate was then placed under administration until the economy had improved enough to revive the stift in 1928. Aastrup Kloster then existed until 1988. Architecture The main building is a three-winged complex. The east wing was built in 1613 by Enevold Kruse. It is constructed in red brick with crow-stepped gables and vaulted cellar. Above the gate is a sandstone plate with Enevold Kruse's and his wife Else Marsvin's names. It is unclear when the north wing was built but it is probably younger than the east wing. The west wing is from 1856. The north and west wings are also built in red brick. The entire complex was renovated in 1922-1928 by the architect V. Holck. The main building (all three wings) was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and structures in 1918. The home farm (avlsg√•rden) was built in circa 1870. It is not listed. Estate The estate has a total area of 688 hectares of which 363 hectares are farmland, 283 are woodland and 25 hectares are parkland. Cultural references Aastrup Kloster was used as a location in the 1950 family film Mosekongen. It was also used as a location in the DR television series Livsens Ondskab.

Harry wants very much to impress others with his magical skills; unfortunately, though inventive, he is far less talented and lucky in pulling off magic than his mischievous former stage rabbit, Bunnie, who steals his magic wand in the first episode, becoming the school's star pupil. Thereafter Bunny seems always to steal Harry's limelight. Harry is largely motivated by his desire to regain the magic wand and to humiliate Bunnie, and is very unscrupulous in how he attempts to do so. Nevertheless, Harry will occasionally team up with Bunnie if they are threatened by a common danger (such as the school's security guard); sometimes Harry will even display a soft side and go so far as to cooperate with Bunnie to do some charitable act, such as rescuing a baby Yeti or delivering toys to children. He has dark blue eyes and hair (a running gag in the show is for his quiff to become mussed and for Harry to tease it desperately back into place) and wears a magician's black tailcoat with the sleeves rolled up at the elbows, a black bowtie, a red cummerbund, dark gray trousers, and red sneakers. * Bunnie ‚Äî A naughty rabbit that used to be Harry's magic prop in his performance. Having stolen Harry's magic wand after considerable provocation, he thereafter becomes the magical school's best student, and the favorite of the Headmistress, Penny. Bunnie has a ravenous appetite for carrots (indeed, Harry's having deprived Bunnie of his carrot was the original cause of their quarrel), though he quickly appears to develop almost as great an appetite for humiliating Harry, whom he will frequently taunt by waggling his tongue at the boy while pointing at it with one of his ears. Bunnie appears to be very popular with his fellow students; later in the series, he develops a romance with a pink kitten named Katty. Bunnie is a white rabbit with a brace on his front teeth, dark blue eyes, a sky blue shirt with a pale yellow stripe, a black bow tie, and black shorts. Recurring characters =Faculty and Staff= * Penny ‚Äî Headmistress of the magical school. She appears to be a skillful magician, a strict disciplinarian (she has a tendency to restore order by blowing an airhorn), and a good teacher, who takes her pupils on numerous field trips and outings. She is particularly fond of Bunnie, whereas she appears to have a grudge against Harry‚Äîmost likely because of his continual destruction of property, both the school's and her own‚Äîthough she shows an unexpected tenderness for him when he is turned into a baby. Penny has scanty gray hair, glasses, dentures (several episodes revolve around her desire for new and better ones), and a rather hunched figure; she wears a bejeweled turban, gold earrings and bracelets, and a wisteria violet and magenta robe; her wand is gold-colored with an emerald green crystal on the end. * The Security Guard ‚Äî He ruthlessly enforces discipline for the school. The guard shows absolutely no favoritism and is just as likely to thwart Bunnie as he is Harry or any other student, though Harry does have a particular tendency to provoke him, particularly when he is off duty. The Guard is a husky, muscular man with a thick black mustache and frizzy black hair; he usually wears a blue uniform. * The Female Teacher ‚Äî * The Male Teacher ‚Äî =Students= * Bob ‚Äî A male student; he is strong and continually hungry, often shown consuming over-sized hero sandwiches. He is stout, with red hair, center-parted and combed into \\"wings\\"; he wears a black top hat with a red hat-ribbon, a magician's black tailcoat (which also resembles a black motorcycle jacket, a white T-shirt with a lightning bolt logo, bluejeans, and light red sneakers. When the students engage in team sports, Bob will often be on Harry's side. In \\"The Pet Competition\\" we see that Bob has a pet cat. * Fiona ‚Äî A female student. She is tall and thin, with a mulberry ponytail and mint green stars on her cheeks. She wears a blue pointed hat with green stars, a green hair ribbon, mint green star-shaped earrings, a jeans jacket rolled up at the elbows, a mint green top and short mulberry skirt with a broad black belt, mint green and white striped knee socks, and mulberry sneakers. * Samy ‚Äî A male student. He is very often seen playing the pungi, charming his pet Indian cobra (to mixed results), or enchanting ropes √† la the Indian rope trick. Samy is tall and thin, with black hair; he wears a red turban with a gold stripe and an aigrette with a royal purple jewel and a white plume, a purple earring, a long blue Nehru jacket with gold collar, cuffs, hem, and buttons, light gray trousers, and black sneakers. * Susan ‚Äî A female student. She is very short, slant-eyed, and buck-toothed, with bowl-cut hair, electric blue behind and hot pink in front. She wears a violet top hat with sea green and hot pink polka-dots and a black hat-ribbon, large round sea-green spectacles, a violet haori over a short hot pink kimono, a light blue obi, and purple sneakers.

The population of the tribe was known to be around 330 members, all living in or near what were known as the Tawasa and Autauga Towns. The tribe existed around the late 1600s, early 1700s, however somewhat disappeared in the early 1700s, due to violence and flee. The tribe was split, with around 60 members joining the Alabama tribe, at Fort Toulouse. Some time later, the tribe at Fort Toulouse migrated south joining various tribes in Florida. For the remaining count, there is little evidence to show where they all went, however there is evidence to show that some ended up in Oklahoma, along with some Creeks who migrated there.  History  In the early 1500s, the nomadic Tawasa tribe was found by Hernando De Soto, near central Alabama. Almost two centuries later, the Tawasa were ambushed by other tribes, who enslaved and relocated some of them. As for those who were able to get away, many accepted the help of the French and sought freedom in southern Alabama, near Mobile. Around a decade later, the tribe relocated again, near their original location of settlement, in central Alabama. The Tawasa remained where they were for around a century that is, until the Treaty of Fort Jackson, in 1814. After the signing of the treaty, the tribe relocated again, this time northeast of their old establishment, near Wetumpka. The tribe broke apart at that point, with some members joining the Creeks, some joining the Seminoles, and others unaccounted for.  Language  The Indians had their own language known as Tawasa language, however there have been accounts of other tribes noticing only small differences between the Tawasa language and theirs. The Tawasa people were known to have spoken a very similar language to the Alabama tribe, however linguistic evidence has been shown that the Tawasa showed some of the same words and dialect choices resembled more of the Hitchiti tribe.  The Account of Lamhatty  The Account of Lamhatty refers to a document that lists remembrances from a Tawasan Indian known as Lamhatty, who was captured and enslaved by Creek Natives. The document was interpreted by historian Robert Beverly, who sat down with Lamhatty to learn about and document his travels and experiences with other tribes. The article includes descriptions of tribes encountered, and mappings of how and where the tribes made settlements. Lamhatty was originally a part of the Tawasa Tribe, however when he was captured he was sold to another tribe known as the Shawnee Indians. Lamhatty stayed with the Shawnee tribe, until he escaped to find refuge with the English, in Virginia. At this time, Lamhatty met Beverly, who then began to break down Lamhatty's travels.

Joannes owned a wholesale grocery store and was the fourth president of the Green Bay Football Corporation, which became Green Bay Packers, Inc. during his tenure. He was part of The Hungry Five, a group of businessmen who are credited with keeping the Green Bay Packers in operation during numerous financially difficult times. He served on the Packers board of directors for over 58 years in various roles, including chairman, president, vice president, secretary, treasurer, and director emeritus. During his 17 years as president from 1930 to 1947, the Packers won six NFL Championships while enduring the Great Depression and World War II. In recognition of his contributions, he was elected to the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame in 1981. Joannes died in 1982 at the age of 89. Early life Lee Joannes was born on October 17, 1892, in Green Bay, Wisconsin, to Thomas and Emma Joannes. The Joanneses were a prominent local family owing to their prosperous grocery business. Joannes attended Green Bay East High School until his graduation in 1912. He went on to attend the University of Michigan, graduating in 1917. During World War I, Joannes served as an officer in the US Army Motor Transport Corps, 412th Motor Supply Train. Grocery business In 1872, Joannes' father Thomas and his two uncles opened a small grocery store in Green Bay. During the late 1800s, the grocery store business was expanded into a wholesale grocer and various buildings were erected, including a large plant along the Fox River. Joannes began working for the Joannes Brothers Company in 1916 with his cousin Harold, who started in 1911. Harold served as president and Joannes served as vice president, with both cousins having an ownership interest after their fathers left the business. The business served the Wisconsin region for many years and was ultimately sold to Super Value Stores in 1957, although Joannes retired and sold his interest in the business in 1945. Joannes also founded the Grocers Equipment Services corporation in the 1940s. The corporation focused on modernizing the grocery industry, including stores, packing plants, and restaurants. Green Bay Packers Joannes, as a local civic leader and prosperous businessman, supported the early growth and development of the Green Bay Packers. His first interactions with the Packers developed because of his friendship with Andrew B. Turnbull, the owner of the Green Bay Press-Gazette and the first president of the Packers. After the Packers almost went bankrupt in 1922, Joannes, along with Turnbull and other local Green Bay businessmen, organized the Green Bay Football Corporation. The corporation was a publicly owned, non-profit that was created after a stock sale that sold 1,000 shares in 1923. Joannes was elected to the first executive committee and board of directors of the corporation, where he would serve as secretary and treasurer for seven years. In 1930, Joannes was elected as the president of the corporation, a role he held for 17 yearsat the time the longest tenure of any Packers president. As president, Joannes led the Packers through multiple financially challenging times. In the first years of his presidency, the Packers lost a lawsuit initiated by a fan who fell out of the stands at City Stadium. The payout from the lawsuit, as well as the ongoing Great Depression, brought the corporation into insolvency. NFL owners transferred the franchise into Joannes' name in 1933. After a $6,000 loan from Joannes, the corporation was reorganized in 1935 into its current form, now known as Green Bay Packers, Inc. This reorganization was supported by another stock sale that was led by Joannes in 1935 that raised $15,000 and maintained the publicly owned, non-profit status of the Packers. During his time as president, the Packers won 133 games, were crowned NFL Champions five times, and only suffered one season with a losing record. Joannes also helped lead the team during World War II, when multiple NFL players were called into service and were unable to compete. Joannes retired as president and from the executive committee in 1947 to focus on his grocery business. He was reelected to the executive committee in 1950 where he helped organize the third stock sale after the departure of co-founder Curly Lambeau. This stock sale raised over $100,000 and helped keep the team in the Green Bay. He served on the executive committee for nine more years, also holding the titles of chairman of the board from 1950 to 1953 and vice president from 1953 to 1959. He was also given the title director emeritus from 1980 to 1982. Personal life Joannes married Helen Gittins of DePere, Wisconsin on June 17, 1920. The marriage produced one son: Thomas Joannes. In the 1930s Helen founded the Green Bay Service League and was very active in the community; she died in 1969. Joannes remarried in 1972. He had one step-son from the marriage: William Baker. After suffering from various health issues in the 1970s, Joannes died on September 20, 1982, at his home in Tucson, Arizona. Legacy As a member of The Hungry Five, Joannes was responsible for helping the Packers survive during its formative years. He personally loaned the team money and led two separate stock sales. His leadership during the stock sales helped maintain the non-profit and public-ownership status of the Packers, which was critical to keeping the Packers in Green Bay. Under his leadership as president, the Packers would become one of the most successful and well- respected franchises in the NFL.

She is the founder of the \\"Self Love Club\\", a movement that pushes for inclusivity and self-acceptance. Feminism, self-love, sexuality, gender, sex, identity, and mental health are all important themes in Cannon's work. Cannon describes her work as 'diaristic', examining what it means to be a woman in contemporary times through her own lens. Along with painting, Cannon has published a poetry book titled \\"I Hope You're Having Trouble Sleeping\\" and released her own line of T-shirts with her work on them. Cannon lists some of her artistic influences as Louise Bourgeois, David Shrigley, Quentin Blake, Marlene Dumas and Frida Kahlo.  Biography  Frances Cannon was born on the 15 September 1992 to Australian parents in rural Melbourne, Australia. Her family moved to Thailand in 1993 and Cannon spent much of her formative years living there, where she was educated through home-schooling, the Chairo Christian School, and the Grace International School. Cannon moved to Melbourne, Australia in 2012 to pursue art, where she graduated from RMIT University with a Bachelor of Arts (Fine Art) with Distinction in 2015 and with a Bachelor of Arts (Fine Arts) with First Class Honours. Soon after, Cannon began solo and group exhibitions, along with custom work for print and online publications.  Work  Cannon is mainly known for her drawings which consists mostly of simple, black and white line drawings. Of her drawings, Cannon said \\"...if there is something I really want to communicate that particular day, I will focus my mind on that topic or scene, and those drawings and paintings are my best. I still never plan the paintings though. I work immediately and fluidly.\\" For larger paintings, Cannon uses watercolour, gouache and ink on thick watercolour paper. The large ink paintings are ambiguous and watery, using large splashes and fluid washes of colour to complement her black line work. Similar in theme to her other works, Cannon's paintings revolve around the body and self. Cannon says that her work \\"feels the fullest when it involves both drawing and painting\\". = Books = Cannon illustrated Girlish, a book about intersectional feminism, by Alana Wulff in 2017. Cannon has published two colouring books: one titled Ladies Lost in the Wilderness, and another in 2017 named Body Positive. In 2018, Cannon self- published a poetry book titled I Hope You're Having Trouble Sleeping In 2017, Cannon self-published a zine titled \\"Self Love Club\\", inspired by her social media movement of the same name. It has 72 submissions from her followers who have obtained a Self Love Club tattoo. Also in 2017, Cannon published \\"Piss on the Patriarchy: A Very Serious Zine\\" for distribution as part of her stall at the Melbourne Zine Fair.  Feminism  Cannon gives feminism as a major influence in her work. According to her, \\"Feminism means everyone getting the same chances in life.\\" She went on to explain that feminism taught her \\"how to love myself and love my body, and that has influenced my work in such a huge way.\\" ‚ÄúI think my art and my feminism sustain each other. It sounds a bit weird, but I think that‚Äôs a big thing. Like, I‚Äôll make a drawing and it‚Äôll be really positive with a feminist message and I will learn from that. Sometimes I‚Äôll make drawings without even properly thinking about it. Later, I‚Äôll look at it and think, 'oh, I need to do that!' or 'I need to think that about myself.'\\" = Self Love Club = The Self Love Club is a movement inspired by a personal tattoo Frances Cannon has on her arm. It aims to promote positive body image, introspective love, and a general attention to the importance of self. The simple tattoo idea was posted onto Cannon's Instagram account, where she invited others to 'join the club'. The tattoos act as a \\"little symbol acknowledging self-worth\\". Cannon said that illustrating her self-love has inspired not only herself, but so many other people.

It was founded by the Nigerian American Ola Ronke Akinmowo in Brooklyn in 2015. History The library was founded by Ola Ronke Akinmowo in 2015. Initially, Akinmowo used social media to ask people to send her any books written by Black women. After some weeks, Akinmowo received about 100 books for her project. The library's holdings grew to about 450 books in 2016, and to about 1000 books in 2018. One reason for this growth was because the library required visitors to donate a book in order to borrow them. Akinmowo's work in developing this mobile library also served as inspiration for other mobile libraries focused on specific groups, such as Pilipinx American Library. Pop-up libraries Events through the Free Black Women's Library typically involve Akinmowo physically bringing the book collection to different places, such as street corners and community spaces. Initially, this was done using a bike trailer when the collection was small, but is now typically done by car with the help of friends or community groups. The collection includes works from many authors, such as such as Octavia Butler, Audre Lorde, Monique W. Morris, Zora Neale Hurston, and Toni Morrison. The organization hosts temporary libraries in different neighborhoods of New York City on a monthly basis, such as Bed-Stuy, and has also been present at the NY Art Book Fair. It has also hosted libraries in other locations around the United States, such as in Chicago, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Detroit. In addition, the library hosts events such as film screenings, workshops and live performances. The library continues to maintain a policy that visitors who come to the mobile library to take a book should also leave one written by a Black woman. In 2019, Asha Grant founded the Los Angeles chapter of the Library, which continues to operate in a mobile capacity through direct donations and trade at pop-up locations, or at selected drop-off centers that ‚Äúactively support marginalized communities.\\" In July 2020, Grant announced a permanent space in Los Angeles, a bookstore named Salt Eaters in Inglewood, \\"where young Black girls, women, femmes and gender-nonconforming people never have to search for stories that represent them, because they will be front and center\\".

He is currently vice president of augmented and virtual reality at Facebook. After graduating from Harvard University in 2004, he worked as a developer on Microsoft Visio for almost two years, then joined Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook in January 2006, where he created News Feed.  Early life and education  Bosworth was born and raised in Santa Clara County, California. He grew up on a farm in Saratoga and was involved in agricultural endeavors with nonprofit 4-H as a child. Bosworth attended Harvard University and met Zuckerberg while working as a teaching assistant in an artificial intelligence class. Bosworth graduated from Harvard University in 2004.  Career  Bosworth began his career working for Microsoft as a developer on Microsoft Visio. In 2006, Bosworth received a call from a recruiter looking for a candidate with a background in artificial intelligence. From this, he joined the team of Facebook as one of the first 15 engineers at the company. In 2012, Bosworth took initiative over the transition between desktop advertising and mobile advertising, where he oversaw the mobile ad product. In August 2017, Facebook CTO Mike Schroepfer announced that Bosworth would be transitioning to the role of vice-president for augmented reality and virtual reality, and Mark Rabkin would assume Bosworth's current responsibilities. = Memo controversy = On June 18, 2016, Bosworth wrote a memo circulated internally within Facebook titled \\"The Ugly,\\" arguing that connecting people was a paramount goal for Facebook, and justified many of the company's practices. The memo also acknowledged that this could have negative consequences, such as the potential to be used by terrorist attacks coordinated via Facebook. The publication date of the memo was a day after the shooting and death of a Chicago man was recorded via Facebook Live. The memo generated strong, polarized reactions within the company. The memo was leaked to and reported on by BuzzFeed on March 29, 2018. In a statement given to BuzzFeed after publication of the story, Facebook CEO and principal founder Mark Zuckerberg said: \\"Boz is a talented leader who says many provocative things. This was one that most people at Facebook including myself disagreed with strongly. We've never believed the ends justify the means. We recognize that connecting people isn't enough by itself. We also need to work to bring people closer together. We changed our whole mission and company focus to reflect this last year.\\" Responding to the publication of the memo by BuzzFeed, Bosworth wrote: \\"I don't agree with the post today and I didn't agree with it even when I wrote it. The purpose of this post, like many others I have written internally, was to bring to the surface issues I felt deserved more discussion with the broader company.\\"  Philanthropy  Bosworth serves as the vice chair on the board of directors for the Peninsula Open Space Trust.

Capolupo joined The Devil Wears Prada as a fill-in drummer, with the eventual plan of becoming an official member. Background Capolupo began his musical career in 2003, when he began to perform drums for Demise of Eros. In 2005, he departed from the band.

Career  Josiah Brooks was born as the fifth of six children. He grew up in Victoria, Australia. At 12 years old he became interested in art, and began practicing drawing. He used Jazza as his username and moniker for his Hotmail account. During high school, he began drawing and animating in Microsoft PowerPoint and Adobe Flash. He said he would look forward to spending time in the school library or lunch period where he could draw and create his own realities. In 2006, when he was 17, he started getting sponsorships from websites for animations, and after graduating high school, he got into producing animation and online video games. He had joined Newgrounds in 2003, and submitted his first game there in 2006. The games were developed using Adobe Flash. In 2011, he saw that Flash animations were in decline, around the time of the \\"iPhone era\\". He looked at his old YouTube channel and noticed that his art tutorial videos had received the most views. In 2012 he created a new channel which he called Draw with Jazza. He said, \\"People go online looking for tutorials on how to draw. ... Whenever I looked there was nothing good... they had loud music and voice- overs or were slow and boring.\\" He started with tutorials on drawing the human anatomy. The videos were filmed with a simple webcam and microphone and had minimal editing. His tutorials have garnered success in views and have also attracted people to his freelance animation business. Draw with Jazza videos are uploaded weekly. Topics are mainly drawing tutorials, but also include character designs, speed painting, and art competitions. He presents \\"art challenges\\" of various kinds. He inserts comedic commentary over his art project videos. He has also reviewed art software and equipment. His secondary channel Daily Jazza includes daily vlogs where he talks with his community about major events occurring in his life, or behind the scenes looks into his projects. Other channels he has created include It's Tabletop Time, launched in 2015, where he plays role-playing games with his friends; JazzaStudios, where he releases cool animated shorts; JosiahBrooksMusic, for his original music videos. He describes his art style as cartoon-like, but has also tried to extend to comic books. His biggest influence was Christopher Hart, an artist who authors many how-to-draw books. He and Hart would later collaborate to manage Hart's YouTube channel. Other influences include Internet animators Adam Phillips, Bernard Derriman, James Farr, James Lee and Johnny Utah. In 2014, his YouTube channel reached 100,000 subscribers. It was at this time he was able to switch to treating it as a business and doing it full-time. He received a sponsorship from the CEO of Newgrounds. In 2015, Google and Screen Australia granted Brooks AU$100,000 as part of their Skip Ahead initiative program. He joined other YouTubers in Los Angeles to work at YouTube Space and produced a series of short films titled The Tale Teller, which was a three- part mini-documentary that follows \\"an old man who enters a city with nothing to his name but the stories he has spent his life gathering, which he wishes to pass on before he dies.\\" In 2015, Forbes contributor Don Groves reported that Draw with Jazza had 25 million views with 60% in the United States and 20% in Europe. In 2016, Forbes contributor Rob Salkowitz reported that Draw with Jazza had 573 videos, over 45 million views and 658,000 subscribers. In November 2017, Mashable reported that Draw with Jazza had two million subscribers, with 45 percent of them from the US, 12 percent from the UK, 10 from Australia, and some amount from non-English speaking countries and locations such as Germany, the Netherlands, and South America. In 2016, he participated in the Adobe Systems' Twitch stream session on \\"Building Flexible Animation\\". He published the book Draw With Jazza ‚Äì Creating Characters: Fun and Easy Guide to Drawing Cartoons and Comics. He also had a series of shorts called Cartoon It Up which was televised on ABC Me and made available on its video watching app. He designed the April Fools' Day logo \\"Googz\\" for Google Australia in 2018. Brooks regularly attends conventions including PAX, VidCon Australia, and Comic-Con. He says he also outsources some of his work so that other artists can make a living in the same field he does. In 2019, he changed his YouTube username to Jazza.  Personal life  Brooks was raised in a Latter-day Saint family, but left the church when he was 21 as he no longer agreed with its views. One of his brothers, Shad M. Brooks, is a YouTuber and author who runs a channel called Shadiversity, which focuses on medieval and fantasy items. He also draws, and has produced some role-playing game material with Jazza. Brooks is married and has two children: a son born in 2015 and a daughter born in 2018.

In the end, she wrote two chapters for the book, which was published in 1945. Shortly thereafter, she started working on her own book about Mary Todd Lincoln titled Mary Lincoln: Biography of a Marriage. James died in 1953. Throughout the 1950s, Randall researched and wrote about the Lincoln family, specifically about the marriage between Lincoln and Mary Todd (The Courtship of Mr. Lincoln, 1957) and the Lincoln's children (Lincoln's Sons, 1955).

As Frank Lloyd Wright's home, Taliesin, was several miles/km away from the proposed site, the school board approached the architect to design their new school building. Wright enthusiastically agreed to do so and donated significant funds to its construction. He would dedicate the assembly room to his mother and her sisters, all of whom were schoolteachers. The building is a one-story elongated hexagon, with two classrooms on the south side of the building. The Great Room on the north side has a fireplace with a raised area. The Great Room and classrooms have a clerestory. The north side of the building includes two smaller rooms on the east and west sides that contain the kitchen and teacher's lounge, with bathrooms. The structure has since been converted into a cultural center. It was added to the state and the National Register of Historic Places in 2016.

The North Vietnamese were eventually forced out by the South Vietnamese. Background At the beginning of 1973 the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN)'s forward positions west of Kontum were just east of Polei Krong () and the adjacent village of Trung Nghia () near the confluence of the Dak Bla and Krong Poko rivers. The People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) had attacked Polei Krong and Trung Nghia on 27 January during the War of the flags campaign, capturing Polei Krong the next day. The PAVN still occupied Polel Krong, which it appeared determined to hold, not only to provide a good point of departure for an attack on Kontum, but also because Polei Krong was astride one of the best north-south lines of communication. In mid-May, Republic of Vietnam Air Force (RVNAF) aerial observers saw two PAVN 130 mm guns being moved into position northwest of Kontum. ARVN intelligence learned of PAVN planned to use the artillery against ARVN artillery batteries in the Kontum area. Shortly afterwards heavy attacks by fire hit the ARVN firebases and positions of the 53rd Infantry Regiment, 23rd Division, northwest of Kontum. Two PAVN ground attacks against Doi Oa Cham were repulsed. Artillery bombardments by the PAVN's 40th Artillery Regmient, employing 130 mm guns and 122 mm rocket fire, continued against forward ARVN positions and artillery batteries during the first week of June, while elements of the PAVN 10th Division conducted ground probes against three forward ARVN positions. Battle On 7 June, a major attack by battalions of the 66th Regiment, 10th Division and the 24th Independent Regiment, supported by at least 10 T-54 tanks and by fire from 130 mm guns and 122 mm rockets struck ARVN positions at Trung Nghia and Polei Krang. The attack drove a Regional Force battalion and elements of the ARVN 44th Regiment, 23rd Division from their positions, giving the PAVN control of positions 17km west of Kontum. The ARVN immediately tried to retake the position and casualties mounted on both sides as successive attempts failed to dislodge the entrenched PAVN, who enjoyed the advantage of observation from the heights of Ngoc Bay Mountain. In early July, the 44th Regiment gained a few meters and dug in on the eastern edge of the village of Ngoc Bay, but could move no further despite the employment of massive artillery preparations and air strikes. Stalled in the attempt to take Trung Nghia by frontal assault, II Corps commander General Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn To√†n determined that an approach from the south against the positions at Plei Djo Drap, directly across the Dak Bla River from Trung Nghia, would strike the PAVN defenses in the flank and force a withdrawal. To√†n therefore directed the 23rd Division, reinforced with Rangers, to attack north from the base at Plei Mrong. The southwest monsoon, in full force over the western highlands of Pleiku and Kontum Provinces in early August, allowed the PAVN to maneuver in daylight since RVNAF aerial observation was spotty and artillery and air strikes consequently much less effective. Plei Mrong () and its camp, called Ly Thai Loi, was situated on Provincial Route 3B south of the Yali Falls of the Krong Bolah and the PAVN concentration around Plei Monoun. The ARVN move north caused activity to pick up during the week of 4-10 August when the PAVN 28th Reconnaissance-Sapper Battalion launched seven separate attempts to take the camp, supported by 75 mm and 130 mm gunfire. ARVN Ranger units in the field north and south of the camp also came under attack. A few days later a battalion of the 95B Regiment, 10th Division, hit the ARVN 22nd Ranger Border Defense Battalion at Doi Ba Cham, just north of Plei Mrong, but was repelled, leaving 150 dead on the battlefield. Meanwhile, the ARVN 45th Regiment, 23rd Division, advancing in the Plei Monoun area to the Krong Bolah River, encountered other elements of the 95B Regiment. Combat with the 95B Regiment continued throughout the month in the Plei Mrong sector and its losses were estimated to approach 200 killed. Despite these losses, the 95B was successful in preventing the ARVN from closing on the Dak Bla River. The PAVN was nevertheless suffering from the bombardment at Trung Nghia. Damage to the PAVN 24B Regiment was so severe that it was withdrawn to the ƒê·∫Øk T√¥ area for recuperation and replaced by elements of the 66th and 28th Regiments, 10th Division. The 28th Regiment, recently strengthened by replacements from the North, took up the defense of Trung Nghia, while the 66th held Plei Djo Drap. Meanwhile, the exhausted ARVN 44th Regiment was replaced in the attack by the 42nd Regiment, 22nd Division, flown to Kontum in C-130s from B√¨nh ƒê·ªãnh Province. This fresh regiment, and a small but important change in tactics, made the difference. Rather than engage in large infantry assaults, the 42nd methodically eliminated PAVN bunkers one by one, using platoon-sized assaults supported by 81 mm mortars firing delayed-fuze rounds which blew away overhead cover and killed or exposed the occupants. Prisoners later attested to the effectiveness of these techniques. On 1 September 1973, the 42nd Regiment began the final assault on Trung Nghia, advancing cautiously to find that except for a few isolated riflemen the PAVN had withdrawn. The PAVN 28th Regiment, depleted by casualties and malaria, limped north along the Poko River. Some of its wounded, left behind and captured, revealed that PAVN forces defending Trung Nghia had suffered losses of 30 percent on the whole, and that in some units with considerable sickness casualty rates were as high as 60 percent. On the other hand, the 42nd's casualties were light. While the 42nd Regiment entered Trung Nghia, the 53rd Regiment, 23rd Division, advanced along the south bank of the Dak Bla River and occupied Plei Djo Drap, vacated by the withdrawing PAVN 66th Regiment, which crossed the river to recuperate. Aftermath Trung Nghia was cleared of all PAVN by 7 September and the 42nd Regiment entered Polei Krong on 16 September. During the rest of the month mopping-up operations cleared PAVN remnants from the slopes of Ngoc Bay Mountain, while skirmishing between the ARVN Rangers and elements of the 95B Regiment continued around Plei Mrong.

He was born to first-generation Armenian immigrants, in \\"grapevine country of Tulare County, California.\\"Iskycams.com (retrieved 16 September 2018) Bad weather killed the grapes, compelling his parents to move to Los Angeles. He had an early interest in ham radio; soon, he became fascinated with hot rods.Reiss, Jason. \\"Ed Iskenderian And The History of Hot Rodding Now Available\\", written 2 May 2018, at Dragzine online Like many others, he went lakes racing at Muroc Dry Lake, which was interrupted by the U.S. entry into World War II. Iskenderian attended L.A.'s Polytechnic High School. He built a customized Model T, adapting the overhead camshaft conversion kit produced by the Chevrolet brothers (the \\"Fronty\\" kit) and the \\"multi-flathead\\" cylinder head developed by George Riley. After suffering a number of failures, and experimenting with Model As and Bs, he turned to the crankshaft of the flathead, which had larger bearings; it proved stronger. He fitted Maxi F cylinder heads and a custom- built \\"slingshot\\" intake manifold (provided by Ed Winfield). Iskenderian filled the combustion chambers with cast iron, then rebuilt them under the guidance of Winfield, producing an astounding (for the period) 13:1 compression ratio. At the U.S. entry into World War II, Iskenderian enlisted in the United States Army Air Corps, and flew supply missions in the Pacific Theatre with the USAAF Air Transport Command. After the war, Iskenderian established a business in a small shop at 5977 Washington Blvd., in Culver City, California; it backed up to Mercury Tool and Die, which was owned by a high school friend of Iskenderian's, John Athan.Burgess, Phil, National Dragster editor. \\"Here, There, and Everywhere\\", written 19 September 2014, at NHRA.com (retrieved 3 October 2018) In this shop, Iskenderian fabricated parts, including camshafts, for fellow hot rodders. He started with a single cam-grinding machine, which he adapted for the purpose himself. When the war ended, Iskenderian (like many other hot rodders) applied the experience and expertise gained in the Army to car building. Demand for speed parts was high, so when he was forced to wait five months for a new camshaft, he decided instead to grind his own, with homebuilt grinder, adapted from a cylindrical grinder. Iskenderian's new grinds offered markedly better performance than stock ones. To promote his business early on, Iskenderian took a chance on a new publication, buying an advertisement in the second issue of Honk!; it paid off with new business. He was first to promote his business with T-shirts and uniforms. He would move from the Washington Blvd. location before coming back to Culver City, then ultimately moving the company to Gardena in 1966, where it remains. Iskenderian was also the first to offer a hard facing on camshafts, and the first to apply computers to cam design. Isky also offered the first camshafts designed to work with hydraulic lifters. To serve the burgeoning new supercharged fuel dragsters, he developed better lifters, drop- in self-locking roller lifters, and anti-pump-up hydraulic lifters (suitable for high-rev use). The high valve lifts and long durations demanded better valve springs, too, so Isky produced the Vasco Jet 1000 springs. He worked with Don Garlits, creating the first corporate sponsorship deal in drag racing: The Don's Speed Shop/Ed Iskendarian dragster, which turned in a record 8.36 second/ pass with Garlits at the wheel.Photo at Iskycams.com (retrieved 16 September 2018) In the 1950s, Iskendarian was the first to offer contingency awards to racers; these small cash payments for applying corporate decals help amateurs continue to race, and have become big business. Not limiting his focus, Iskendarian offered the first complete valvetrain kits, including camshaft and valve gear, for stock racing classes, as well as street cars. He also produced the first roller lifter cams for Chevrolet engines and the first bushings and cam keys to allow cam timing to be adjusted. Iskendarian got together with Vic Edelbrock, Jr., Roy Richter, Bob Hedman, Robert E. Wyman, John Bartlett, Phil Weiand Jr, Dean Moon, Al Segal, and Willie Garner in 1963, forming the Speed Equipment Manufacturers Association, now known as SEMA, serving as its first president during 1963-1964. In 1985, Iskendarian was named one of Chevrolet's \\"Legends of Performance\\". The company he founded is now located in Gardena, California.

It was first established in 1810 by Governor Lachlan Macquarie and surveyed by James Meehan in 1811. It is also known as Great Square, Reserved Square and the Recreation Ground. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 November 2011.  History  The town of Wilberforce lies immediately above the rich alluvial flood plain of the Upper Hawkesbury River. The natural food resources, both animal and vegetable, afforded by the soil and the water, had been attractive to Aboriginal people for millennia before European settlement in 1794 and subsequent years transformed the plain into intensive farms. The area available for land grants along what became known as Wilberforce Reach was constrained in 1804 by the creation of Phillip Common by Governor King. This well-wooded upland area of 6150 acres (2600 hectares) was available as rough grazing for the farmers on the cleared agricultural land beside the river.(Barkley-Jack, Hawkesbury Settlement Revealed) When Governor Macquarie arrived in the colony in 1810, he was aware of the problems created by the propensity of the Hawkesbury to rise rapidly in flood and inundate the low- lying farms. By December 1810, the Governor was ready to implement a plan to create five new towns on higher ground along the Upper Hawkesbury and Lower Nepean, where allotments would be reserved for those farming on the plain, so that they might have a secure refuge for themselves, their families, their seed-corn and animals in time of flood. In all four Hawkesbury towns, Richmond, Windsor, Pitt Town and Wilberforce, the initial site was largely or wholly resumed from King's Commons.(Jack, Macquarie's Towns) Wilberforce is the only one of the five towns sited on the inland side of the river. The river frontage along Wilberforce Reach, close to the future town, had been fully occupied by the end of 1794 and the area along the north-eastern part of York Reach was being farmed by 1795. In Macquarie's time the greatest density of settlement on the inland side still lay to the south-west of the town, in the boot-shaped area within the great bend of the river along the Argyle, Windsor and Wilberforce Reaches. The site chosen for the town on 6 December 1810 was convenient for access to the river and its farms.Macquarie, Journals, p.31 Except for King Road, closest to the plain, it lay above the level of any anticipated flood. The elevated situation, however, paid the price of a steady slope. Geographers have assigned five types of slope to the parish of Wilberforce, varying from the level flood-plain along the river, through level uplands and \\"rolling\\" country to \\"rough\\" and \\"steep\\".Maze, Australian Geographer, vol.4, 1943, fig.3 p.161 The level uplands lie too far from the river farms to be a possible site for the town, but the penalty of being closer to the flood-plain was that most of the town was built on a slope of the second steepest category. No other Macquarie town is built on such a pronounced hillside. The surveyor, James Meehan started his work of laying out Wilberforce on 5 January 1811 in a perfect symmetry of three rows, each containing five sections.State Records NSW, Reel 2622, Field Book 67, SZ 888, pp.41-46 The Great Square occupied the whole central rectangular section. When Governor Macquarie returned to the town on 11 January 1811, \\"the name (Wilberforce) being painted on a board was nailed on a high post and erected in the middle of the large square in presence of a great number of the most respectable settlers in this district\\".Macquarie, Journals, p.41 View over Wilberforce Park from Church Road, looking north west to bunyas, St John's Anglican Church and the Macquarie schoolhouse-church The Square was defined by the new town streets, Macquarie to the north, George to the south and, on the short sides of the rectangle, Duke to the west and Church to the east. These new roads did not supersede the older track from the flood-plain up to the road to Kurrajong, which wound across the eastern sector of the new Square. Houses were built which encroached on George Road opposite the Square and the schoolmaster's house of the 1830s came very close to encroaching on the Square itself.Brunton. MA thesis, Section 3 Church Road had no building development at all until the very end of the nineteenth century, but the two allotments in Duke Road adjacent to the Square had been developed. On the land above the Square across Macquarie Road, the second Macquarie schoolhouse/chapel, built in 1819, dominated the scene until Edmund Blacket erected St John's Anglican Church in front of the Macquarie building in 1860. Bishop William Broughton had in 1849 attempted to have the proposed new church built in the middle of the Square instead, and he had some local support, but this development was not approved.Bowd, Wilberforce, p.5 Wilberforce Square, in contrast to Richmond Park, was not designated as a market place. The pronounced slope made it unsuitable for team-games, such as cricket, which were regularly played in the Squares at both Richmond and Windsor (McQuade Park). There was no authority responsible for the development of Wilberforce Square before 1895 and as a result there is little documentation about its first 85 years. Since the Square is unlikely to have been fenced in the nineteenth century, it is likely that cattle, sheep, horses and pigs would often have grazed there, en route to the common beyond Wilberforce Cemetery. Fencing did not entirely preclude grazing, for horses were agisted in the Square as late as the 1940s.Hawkesbury City Council, file PK/021 On 14 June 1895 Macquarie's Great Square was reclassified as a Recreation Ground. The new survey determined its area as 8 acres 3 rods 26 perches, very close to the present official extent of 3.607 hectares. The area remained Crown land and the Department of Lands, as was usual, appointed a group of Trustees to oversee its administration. Four local worthies were appointed as Trustees on 22 October 1895. Stephen John Dunstan and Reuben Greentree were members of old farming dynasties in the district, Lewis Simpson was the local tanner and George Nicholls another local farmer. In November 1895, these four Trustees were joined by a fifth, Edward Thomas Bowd, the third generation of his family in Wilberforce and the grandfather of the well-known local historian, Doug Bowd.(Government Gazette of the State of New South Wales, 1895, vol.6 pp.6836, 7755; Bowd, Short History of Wilberforce, pp.2-8, 11.) The area around Wilberforce had no provision for a local government authority until the Shires Act was passed in 1906. The five members of the Provisional Council of Colo Shire, including two of the Trustees, Dunstan and Bowd, met for the first time on 13 June 1906 and Bowd became one of the six elected members of the Council in December of that year.(Colo Temporary Council Minute-Book, 1906, p.13; Colo Shire Council Minute-Book, 1906‚Äì1910, p.2.) Colo Shire Council met in Wilberforce, but it was responsible for a rural area of 3,200 square kilometres with a scattered population of around 4,000 in 1910. Its main preoccupations were road and ferry maintenance and for more than three decades it took no role in running the Recreation Reserve. The Trustees, who had been appointed for life, continued to function. In 1918, when there was an impulse to erect a War Memorial, the chair of the local Patriotic League was E. T. Bowd, while another Trustee, Greentree, was prominent on the committee. The Memorial was erected, however, not in the Recreation Reserve but on the elbow of King Road. When Reuben Greentree died in 1923, the Department of Lands appointed a replacement, F. R. Daly, the Wilberforce storekeeper, after consulting with the Colo Council.Colo Shire Council Minute-Book, 1921‚Äì1924, p.113 no.1391 No minutes of the Trustees' meetings are known to survive and it is not possible to know what policies they implemented about the development of the Recreation Reserve. The single-rail wooden fence which appears in a photograph of 1937 was presumably erected by the Trustees,Hawkesbury Library, photograph 003051 but there is no information about clearing or planting the reserve. In 1946, however, the Colo Shire Council took the initiative and called a public meeting for 28 August 1946 to allow the community to discuss improving what was now called a park for \\"sports and recreation\\" or alternatively to approve the disposal of the land and seek a new playing field on a more level site. At the August meeting the local people showed a reluctance to part with the Macquarie Square and instead formed a Citizens' Committee to draw up a Master Plan to decide \\"the most suitable area for a park, recreation area and swimming pool to meet the needs of the future\\".(Windsor and Richmond Gazette, 21 August 1946, p. 6; 18 September 1946, p. 2) Concessions to those interested in sport and in war memorials immediately followed early in 1947. An area in the centre of the Park was cleared and levelled for use a practice nets for cricket. This terrace is visible in a 1947 aerial photograph. So is a tennis court in the south-west of the Park, near George Road. The court was made from ant heaps and a rectangular changing shed was built just to the north for the tennis players by day and used by a swagman by night.Information from a meeting of residents, 28 August 2003 The tennis courts and the cricket nets were removed around the 1980s by Hawkesbury City Council, the successor to Colo Shire Council. Toilets built just east of the tennis court site in 1994 were removed in 1999 because of extreme vandalism.Hawkesbury City Council, file PK/021 part 2, 13 April 1999 The provision of sporting facilities has continued to be an issue and a thrust for the building of a mini-basketball court near the Duke Road frontage was seriously considered in 2003 before it was rejected.(Hawkesbury City Council, file PK/021 part 2, plan) The Park has been seen as a secure place for children to enjoy and the need for play equipment has been recognised. The playground was removed briefly in 1999 and has now been replaced in the south-west sector with new facilities. Close by, between the play equipment and George Road, a public barbecue was provided by the City Council, within a shelter shed. Memorial gates Australia's enthusiasm for the memorialisation of war has been very evident in the Park since the end of World War II. On 19 August 1947, the President of the Shire Council unveiled memorial gates in the Park on the corner of Duke and George Roads. These gates were \\"in honour of the men and women of the Wilberforce District who served in the cause of freedom in World War II, 1939‚Äì1945\\". The gates were at the entrance to an existing transverse pathway which led up to Macquarie Road directly opposite the Blacket church of St John. The trees which line this avenue are now mature and more were planted by Council in 1995 at the urging of the RSL for the jubilee celebrations called Australia Remembers 1945. More trees were planted as part of the district's Bicentennial program in 1994, when old Hawkesbury families were each commemorated by a tree and an appropriate plaque on a small concrete plinth. A few of these Bicentennial trees and plaques survive in the north-east corner of Wilberforce Park and four on the western side of the pathway. Nine young trees have recently been planted on the pathway at the George Road end. Wilberforce War Memorial A World War I Memorial was erected in 1918 by the Lidcombe contractors Kingsley and Cook in David Street, just outside the Macquarie town boundaries. In 1966 the Colo Shire Engineer, Stan Brown, supervised the transfer of the monument intact on a float. It was resited, together with its circular cast-iron fence, near the top of the diagonal pathway, and at right angles to it, so that it has a spatial relationship with the 1947 Memorial Gates at the foot of the avenue. The text on the original marble plaque on the Memorial referring only to World War I had already been expanded to include World War II while the Memorial was still in David Street. Names of people who served in the Korean War (1950‚Äì1953) and the Vietnam War (1965‚Äì1972) were added after the memorial was relocated in the Park. The names of those who served in these later conflicts were added on new plaques low down on the sandstone base. A corollary to these physical changes has been that ANZAC Day rituals have since 1966 concentrated on the Park. The Country Women's Association has provided morning tea each 25 April, while Council has supplied portable chairs for those attending the ceremony. The community values the Park as a place for passive recreation. When the Council proposed to build a new Community Centre and pre-school in the Park in 1991, there was a very sharp reaction, which resulted in the refurbishment of the old Community Hall on Windsor Road and the dropping of all plans to disrupt the recreational space of the Park. As a result, Wilberforce Park, alone among the Macquarie Squares, has retained its full spatial integrity and withstood the temptations to create any substantial structures within the Park. This is truly a Reserved Square. Today, unlike the two other Macquarie-period Hawkesbury Great Squares on the State Heritage Register (at Windsor and Richmond), Wilberforce retains with precision the dimensions, location, purpose and context envisaged by Governor Macquarie. By contrast, at Windsor McQuade Park has been greatly increased in size and at Richmond a portion of the Square has been resumed for law and order purposes and for postal communications, while both Squares have extensive commitments to sport. Wilberforce has a different level and style of historical integrity, with an outstanding legibility which is of State importance.  Description  Wilberforce Park is a rectangular area of well-treed grassland containing 3.607 hectares. The land slopes downwards between the two longer sides: the highest point is on Macquarie Road, the lowest on the corner of George and Duke Roads. There has been some artificial levelling in the central portion of the park. There are various benches cut into the sloping ground marking areas of former structures (tennis court and shed), playground and practice cricket pitch/nets. In 2003 a small shelter pavilion with a barbecue was constructed and replacement play equipment has recently been installed nearby in the south-west sector of the Park. The planting at Wilberforce Park is distinctive. Lines of pines (most likely Stone Pines, Pinus pinea) and Bunya Pines (Araucaria bidwillii), were planted to form two avenues in the park. A comparison of the 1947 aerial photograph indicate that some plantings on the eastern avenue have since been removed. The park contains mature indigenous eucalypts. One specimen opposite the gate of St John's Church on Macquarie Road marked the junction of the lines of two paths from the southern corners of the park. Despite the loss of numerous early plantings there remains a substantial and impressive collection of conifers and old Red Gums (Eucalyptus tereticornis). Some of these require attention from an arborist to assess their viability and safety. There is root damage near the surface to some trees due to inappropriate mowing regimes. The Park is surrounded by a modern two-rail wooden fence, erected in accordance with the recommendation of the Conservation Management Plan of 2003. A single pathway cuts diagonally across the Park from Macquarie Road opposite St John's Anglican Church down to the junction of George and Duke Roads, where there are metal gates erected in 1947 in memory of those local men and women who had served in World War II. Towards the northern end of this pathway there is the World War I Memorial, originally erected elsewhere in the town in 1918 and reconstructed within the Park in 1966. This War Memorial is a complex structure some 4 metres high. The sandstone base, with two steps, stands on brick foundations. Above the base there are four rectangular marble tablets bearing the inscriptions \\"Wilberforce\\", \\"Freemans Reach\\", \\"Ebenezer\\" and \\"Erected by the Residents of Wilberforce\\". Above the tablets is a dye displaying four more marble panels. Three of these give the names of the World War I soldiers: \\"The Empire called and they answered\\" from Wilberforce, Ebenezer and Freemans Reach respectively. The fourth panel describes the purpose of the monument The dye is in turn surmounted by a pedimented cap, with carvings on all four sides, showing a bugle, an anchor, bayonets and a soldier's cap with the British and Australian flags. Finally there is a sandstone spire 2 metres high, with a large carving of two Lee-Enfield rifles on the northern side. The plaques on the sandstone base are later additions, listing those who served in World War II, Korea and Vietnam. The Memorial is surrounded by its original circular iron railing. 2008 concrete obelisk At the north end of the pathway a concrete marker was installed in 2008 bearing three bronze plaques giving information about the history and significance of the park. Close to the southern end of the pathway, there is a children's playground with some unobtrusive equipment. The park retains intact the dimensions surveyed by James Meehan in 1811 and still fulfils the central role envisaged by Governor Macquarie in 1810. This is the best preserved of all the squares which were a fundamental feature of Macquarie's plans for new country towns.  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries Wilberforce Park is of State heritage significance as the best surviving example of the three surviving Great Squares created 200 years ago in the heart of the grid patterned towns of Wilberforce, Windsor and Richmond. Wilberforce is among the five new country towns planned by Governor Macquarie in 1810‚Äì1811 and has survived with remarkable integrity. Its direct associations with some of the earliest planning work by Governor Macquarie and James Meehan demonstrate its importance, together with Wilberforce as some of the earliest town planning attempts in NSW and the colony. The central Square, now a Park, is still today an essential historic asset for passive recreation and quiet contemplation at the heart of a perfectly preserved Georgian town- plan. Its deliberate siting adjacent to the iconic Macquarie Schoolhouse/chapel and St John's (Blacket) Church (already on the State Heritage Register) and its views over the Hawkesbury flood-plain enhance the State significance of both Park and Schoolhouse. The Park has also become the chosen site for the district's memorials to those who fell or otherwise served in war. The memorial erected after World War I and reused to commemorate subsequent campaigns, is of local significance not only for itself, but also for the way in which it has encouraged continuing planting of shade-trees in a memorial avenue. Wilberforce Park was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 November 2011 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Wilberforce Park is of State historical significance as a powerful testimony to the first stage of formal town planning in New South Wales. The rectangle of open green space in the centre of Governor Macquarie's most intact Hawkesbury town has survived for 200 years with remarkable integrity. It is still today an essential historic asset for passive recreation and quiet contemplation at the heart of a perfectly preserved Georgian town plan. Its deliberate siting adjacent to the iconic Macquarie schoolhouse/chapel and church, and its views over the Hawkesbury flood plain enhance the State significance of both park and schoolhouse. Unlike the two other Macquarie-period Hawkesbury Great Squares at Windsor and Richmond, Wilberforce retains with precision the dimensions, location, purpose and context envisaged by Governor Macquarie. By contrast, at Windsor McQuade Park has been greatly increased in size and at Richmond a portion of the Square has been resumed for law and order purposes and for postal communications, while both Squares have extensive commitments to sport. Wilberforce has a different level and style of historical integrity, with an outstanding legibility which is of State importance. The Park has also become the chosen site for the district's memorials to those who fell or otherwise served in external wars. The memorial erected after World War I and reused to commemorate subsequent campaigns, is of local significance, not only for itself but for the way in which it has encouraged continuing planting of shade trees in a memorial avenue. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Wilberforce Park has State significant associations because of its direct association with Governor Macquarie who in 1810, personally selected the location of the new town within Phillip Common. He also approved the placement within the town of the Anglican schoolhouse/church, the burial ground and the adjacent Great Square. The survey of the simple rectangular town, with the central feature of the Square, was done to the Governor's instructions and inspected by Macquarie soon after James Meehan had completed his initial work early in January 1811. James Meehan was a hard-working and trusted surveyor whose work throughout the Macquarie period was significant in aiding Governor Macquarie's vision for the young colony. In the case of Wilberforce, Meehan's exemplary field-book survives to show him at work creating a new town in January 1811. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Wilberforce Park has State significance as the essential counterpart for the State listed Macquarie schoolhouse/church and cemetery. The Park is as important a part of the view from the churches as they are of the view westwards from the Park. Wilberforce Park has aesthetic local significance because the Park as a whole, with its extensive tree plantings and wide vistas over the flood-plain which made the town of Wilberforce necessary, is an attractive and necessary adornment to the town. It is an essential breathing space within what has become a modern dormitory suburb within the Macquarie grid-plan. Wilberforce Park sums up the quiet aesthetic qualities which still make the Upper Hawkesbury valley a remarkable colonial scene. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Wilberforce Park has local social significance because the people of the Wilberforce district have strenuously lobbied to preserve the tranquil qualities of the Park from invasive works designed to create sporting facilities out of a natural slope or to introduce uncongenial buildings, while at the same time recognising that the memorialisation of war service can add to the public value of the place and make it a focal community spot each ANZAC Day. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Wilberforce Park has State rarity significance because it is the best preserved of the three Macquarie town squares which survive and fulfil their original function in the Hawkesbury towns founded and planned by Governor Macquarie in 1810‚Äì1811. The degree of integrity displayed by Wilberforce Park is unique among all Macquarie towns. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Wilberforce Park has State representative significance because it is a prime example of the quiet fulfilment of one of the essential characteristics of Governor Macquarie's designs for the first country towns in Australia.

Chicago Colloquium on Digital Humanities and Computer Science (DHCS) (2006). He has also developed computational stylistic methods that provide insights into the meaning of stylistic differences. One of Argamon's key innovations for this purpose is the development of computational stylistic analysis using systemic functional linguistics.Argamon, Shlomo, Casey Whitelaw, Paul Chase, Sobhan Raj Hota, Navendu Garg, and Shlomo Levitan. \\"Stylistic text classification using functional lexical features.\\" Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology 58, no. 6 (2007): 802-822.Argamon, Shlomo, and Moshe Koppel. \\"The rest of the story: Finding meaning in stylistic variation.\\" In The Structure of Style, pp. 79-112. Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, 2010. For example, together with Jeff Dodick and Paul Chase, he examined whether there are clear and consistent differences between scientific method in experimental sciences and historical sciences. Their work showed how using systemic functional features in computational stylistic analysis provides evidence for multiple scientific methodologies of the sorts posited previously by philosophers of science.Argamon, Shlomo, Jeff Dodick, and Paul Chase. \\"Language use reflects scientific methodology: A corpus-based study of peer-reviewed journal articles.\\" Scientometrics 75, no. 2 (2008): 203-238. Forensic Linguistics is viewed through its two major components, first one being Written Language and the Second one being Spoken Language. Written language is mainly used on transcripts for police interviews, for both the witnesses and the suspects. The transcripts are considered examined text material from criminal messages, terrorist threats or blackmailing messages and translate them from one language to another and then reviewed to help in answering questions about the author if the message. Many different kinds of text materials can be examined, some being notes, phone messages, letters both typed and handwritten as well as text from social medias. Much more can be determined by combining computational stylistics and scientific methods in order to enhance Cybersecurity. = Linguistics for Cybersecurity = Recently, Argamon has pushed for the increased use of linguistic analysis for attribution of cybersecurity attacks. He has pointed out how linguistic attribution techniques can often be used to good effect on natural language texts that arise in different attack scenarios, and has provided analyses for high-profile cases such as the Sony Pictures hack, the Democratic National Committee cyber attacks, and the Shadow Brokers NSA leak.  Data Science  In 2013, Argamon founded the Illinois Institute of Technology Master of Data Science program, which he currently directs. The program seeks to teach students \\"to think about the real problems that need to be solved, not to simply find technical solutions.\\" Argamon views data scientists as \\"sensemakers\\", whose job is not merely to produce analytic results, but to help their clients make sense of a complex, uncertain, and fast-changing world through rigorous analysis and explanation of the data.

After the fall of the Libyan government and beginning of the Syrian Civil War, the group's members entered Syria via Turkey and began taking part in multiple skirmishes alongside and against other armed Syrian opposition groups. The group's founder and the fighters who came with him began working in factories in Aleppo and construction sites to build local ties and raise funds as well as recruit local fighters to build a worker's army, Abu Muad states he and his group refused to take part in criminal activities to finance their operations and used their wages to buy weapons and ammunition. The group received no foreign aid.  History  In 2013, the group came into conflict with the Nour al-Din al-Zenki Movement after the group's leader claimed the Zenki movement was sheltering a Shabiha commander in rebel-held areas and that he was stealing property from the locals. The group proceeded to arrest the commander when he was unprotected. The arrest caused brigades linked to the Zenki movement to arrive and demand he be released. The Sedov brigade refused to release him resulting in a minor clash. The Zenki movement later requested support from Jabhat al-Nusra to mediate between the Sedov Brigade and Zenki Movement. Al-Nusra reportedly asked the brigade to release him. The brigade again refused, causing al-Nusra to respond by sending a group of Central Asian fighters to attack the group, soon after the Sedov Brigade released him. The group's leader Abu Muad was captured by ISIL in 2013 and was held for several days in a school. He claims ISIL attempted to blackmail him and took his possessions. Protestors later demanded that ISIL release him and a local helped him escape. He says after escaping from ISIL's custody they apologized for holding him, returned his possessions and offered him food for Ramadan. The group fought alongside an assortment of other rebel groups, including the Muslim Brotherhood-linked Sham Legion and attempted to form a unified force against the Syrian government. It joined the Levant Front in the summer of 2015, but left after a month. In spite of political differences between larger opposition groups such as Ahrar al-Sham, the brigade continued to work with them on the ground in Aleppo and surrounding areas against the Syrian Government and YPG. In an interview the group's leader and founder Abu Muad when asked about his stance on the newly formed coalition of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, he claimed he supports it as long as they continue to fight the Syrian government.

It was laid out by surveyor James Meehan and established in 1811. It is also known as St John's Church of England Cemetery. It is owned by Hawkesbury City Council. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 20 August 2010.  History  The Darug (various spellings) occupied the area from Botany Bay to Port Jackson north-west to the Hawkesbury and into the Blue Mountains. The cultural life of the Darug was reflected in the art they left on rock faces. Before 1788, there were probably 5,000 to 8,000 Aboriginal people in the Sydney region. Of these, about 2,000 were probably inland Darug, with about 1,000 living between Parramatta and the Blue Mountains. They lived in bands of about 50 people, and each band hunted over its own territory. The Gommerigal- tongarra lived on both sides of South Creek. The Boorooboorongal lived on the Nepean from Castlereagh to Richmond. Little information was collected about the Aboriginal people of the Hawkesbury before their removal by white settlement so details of their lifestyle have to be inferred from the practices of other south-eastern Aborigines. It is believed they lived in bark gunyahs. The men hunted game and the women foraged for food. On 15 December 1810, Macquarie issued an Order laying out five towns along the Hawkesbury River. One at Green Hills would be called Windsor. Another at Richmond Hill District would be called Richmond. A third in the Nelson district would be named Pitt Town. The village in the Phillip district would be called Wilberforce and the fifth in the Evan district was Castlereagh. Nearby settlers would be allotted sites on these towns to build. Wilberforce developed as an area of small farms with few large landholders.Hubert, Conservation Plan, 17 Situated on the northern bank of the Hawkesbury River with more difficult access, it did not attract the attention of large landholders. A community with a sizeable representation of freed convicts emerged and was maintained over the years as their families grew. An early burial ground was located at Portland Head, later known as Ebenezer and may have been in operation as early as 1810.Hubert, Conservation Plan, 18Otherwise, deceased people were often buried on their farms. On 6 December 1810, Macquarie selected the site for Wilberforce. These town sites would provide refuges from floods for those farming nearby lands. Surveyor James Meehan was instructed to lay out a town at Wilberforce on 26 December 1810. Macquarie also selected land for a church on high ground near this site. Meehan laid out 2 acres for a burial ground at Wilberforce on 5 January 1811.Field Book 67, p 45, SRNSW SZ 888 On 2 February 1811, Macquarie instructed Reverend Samuel Marsden to consecrate the burial grounds at towns on the Hawkesbury including Wilberforce. Surveyor Evans would show him the areas set aside.Col Sec, Letters Sent, 1810, SRNSW 4/3490D, p 97 Macquarie issued an order on 11 May 1811 that deceased persons must be buried in consecrated burial grounds and no longer on their farms and that the local settlers were to enclose these burial grounds as soon as possible.(Sydney Gazette, 18 May 1811, p 1) Reverend Cartwright was paid ¬£10 before 1 July 1812 for \\"enclosing the Burial Ground at the Township of Wilberforce\\". The earliest burials in Wilberforce Cemetery were of three drowned men, James Hamilton (Hambleton), Joseph Ware and John Tunstal on 13 December 1811, but their gravesites are unknown.Hubert, Conservation Plan, 21 Margaret Chaseling was buried in the cemetery in October 1815 and is the oldest burial for which the site is known.Hubert, Conservation Plan, 22 Soon afterwards, Anthony Richardson, a Second Fleet arrival, was buried on 4 February 1816. His burial marker is the oldest to survive.Hubert, Conservation Plan, 24 A schoolhouse- cum-chapel was also erected on the church site nearby so that the Macquarie ideal of the church, school and burial ground on the highest point demonstrating order and religion was realised in the town of Wilberforce. In July 1822, Macquarie reported that at Wilberforce he had erected, \\"A Burial Ground of 4 Acres Contiguous to the Temporary chapel, enclosed with a Strong Fence.\\" It is notable that the measurement does not agree with the area as laid out by surveyor Meehan, which was 2 acres (0.8 ha). The area of the oldest section is close to 2 acres. Macquarie appears to have simply made an error when listing his achievements in the colony. Until 1826, burials at Wilberforce were recorded in the register for St Matthew's at Windsor. A separate burial register for Wilberforce Cemetery commenced that year.Hubert, Conservation Plan, 29 Between 1811 and 1825, there were a considerable number of burials in the cemetery who were early ex-convict arrivals. Many were later joined in the cemetery by their families and descendants. The existing spatial configuration of the Cemetery is also striking. A high number of older grave markers also survive, many of them for ex-convicts who arrived in the earlier period. Of all Macquarie's cemeteries, Wilberforce has the most interments with the highest proportional representation of ex-convict settlers from the First to the Third Fleets. Windsor has more convict burials but they arrived later. Richmond cemetery is dominated by free arrivals. The original Pitt Town cemetery does not exist anymore. Castlereagh cemetery was largely unused. Liverpool cemetery has been destroyed. Of the burials at Wilberforce from 1811 to 1825, 36% were interments of convicts who arrived before 1800.Hubert, Conservation Plan, 26-9 The orientation of the graves is such that they face from north-east to south-west, so that the north-eastern boundary is the \\"front\\" of the cemetery.Hubert, Conservation Plan, 41 Though the cemetery was placed in the control of the Church of England, there are burials of people from other denominations as well, such as Roman Catholics and Methodists.Hubert, Conservation Plan, 42 The burial ground was officially appropriated as a Church of England Cemetery in 1833.Hubert, Conservation Plan, 55 From the earliest days, a road to the north and Kurrajong passed close to the eastern side of the cemetery. It was a rough track not officially gazetted but its existence was shown on the earliest plans of the town.SR Map 5960; W Baker, Map of the County of Cook, W Baker, Sydney, 1843-6 On 22 August 1894, Surveyor C. R. Scrivener completed a survey of two additions to the cemetery for a General Cemetery, with 1 rood 20 perches adjoining the Church of England Cemetery and another of 1 acre across the roadway.(Ms.1262.3000, Crown Plan) On 4 July 1896, an area of 1 acre was dedicated as a General Cemetery on the opposite side of the unnamed road.NSWGG, 4 July 1896, p 4572 It appears to never have been used for interments. The area measuring 1 rood 20 perches immediately adjacent to the older cemetery between the 1811 cemetery and the unnamed road was dedicated as a General Cemetery on 22 August 1906. It was later approved as an extension to the Church of England Cemetery.(Ms.1262.3000, Crown Plan) It was used for burials from 1911 onwards, mostly from the same families who were interred in the older part of the cemetery. There were five burials there in 1911.Hubert, Conservation Plan, 2, 38It became an integral part of the cemetery and is included as part of this listing. Monuments have been made by a variety of masons including a noted local mason, George Robertson of Windsor. The trustees handed over control of Wilberforce cemetery to Colo Shire Council on 27 February 1968.C McHardy, Sacred to the Memory, 4 It was closed for new burials in November 1986, though pre-existing rights to burial mean that there are occasionally additional interments.Hubert, Conservation Plan, 48 It is now under the control of Hawkesbury Shire Council. In 2003, Cathy McHardy collated the total number of interments as 1,317, the number of monuments as 460 and the number of marked interments as 842.C McHardy, Sacred to the Memory, 6 She has identified three burials from the First Fleet; ten from the Second Fleet and four from the Third Fleet.C McHardy, Sacred to the Memory, 10  Description  Everingham family headstones in Wilberforce Cemetery for Matthew (died 1817) and Elizabeth (died 1822) Everingham. Matthew Everingham arrived First Fleet in 1788, noted early Hawkesbury settler The Wilberforce Cemetery, formerly known as the St John's Church of England Cemetery, began as a large rectangular plot divided into four sections by a northeast‚Äìsouthwest path and a northwest‚Äìsoutheast path. The alignment of these paths remains clear, although the paths are now grassed over. The northwest‚Äìsoutheast path does not continue southeast beyond its junction with the northeast‚Äìsouthwest path. The northeast‚Äìsouthwest path also does not extend far southwest of the northwest‚Äìsoutheast path. The cemetery has some terracing along the edge of the northeast‚Äìsouthwest path to accommodate the slope across the site. The graves are laid out in approximate rows running northwest‚Äìsoutheast so that the graves can face approximately east. The alignment of the rows has been modified by the c. 1911 addition of a wedge-shaped section of land on the northeast side of the area and by the practicalities of aligning graves with the contours of the slope. Apart from the newer area of graves at the southwestern end of the eastern sector, the rows are irregular. This is probably as much to do with gravediggers coping with the slope of the land as with the apparently haphazard allocation of gravesites in the nineteenth century. Headstone group in Wilberforce Cemetery for Nowland family members who died in 1819, 1828, 1852 and 1854 The earliest burials are scattered around the cemetery although there is a definite preference to using the higher ground on the northwestern and northeastern sides. The addition of land c.1911 was followed by burials at the high land in that area. Even by the mid twentieth century, burials appear to be concentrated on the higher land on the northeastern and northwestern sides. New rows from the mid to late twentieth century are differentiated from the nineteenth and early twentieth century burials by the more ordered layout of the rows. There is no formal planting within the former St John's Church of England Cemetery. It has been left simply grassed with trees in the Clergy Road and Copeland Road reserves providing some separation between the cemetery and the surrounding town. ;Fencing An aluminium spear picket fence marks the boundary of the former St John's Church of England Cemetery. Gates are located on the northeast and southeast sides, aligning with the main axial paths. ;Monuments Wilberforce Cemetery contains a range of monument styles from the early nineteenth century to the late twentieth century. The majority of early monuments are upright slabs or grave markers. Sandstone is the most common material for the grave markers followed by white marble. Most monuments from the inter-war period onwards are slab and desk style, often built of granite. Rare table slab memorial in Wilberforce Cemetery to Emily, Eliza and Emily Louisa Robinson who died in 1849, 1894 and 1928 respectively The cemetery is notable for the survival of a number of fine altar style slabs, although the condition of these vary. A rare table style slab monument for Emily, Eliza and Emily Louisa Robinson (died 1849, 1894 and 1928) also survives. ;Columbaria A pair of brick columbarium walls was built at the eastern entrance to the cemetery in the 1970s. They are simple cream brick walls with brick capping. The side of one wall has a plaque commemorating members of the First Fleet who lived in the area and were buried in the cemetery. ;Condition As at 12 March 2010, many of the monuments are in reasonable condition considering their age and problems in more recent years with vandalism. This is a reflection of the care and respect they have received from the local community. Some monuments have weathered so that their original inscriptions are no longer clear or have been lost. A number of these have had plaques fixed with the words of the original inscription repeated. Others have been re-engraved or have had the lettering blacked to make it clearer. The monuments in the worst condition are generally the table style slab monuments. Subsidence due to erosion on the steep site and/or inadequate footings for the original monument has contributed to this. Since Wilberforce Cemetery is an old and largely intact cemetery, the graves provide significant potential archaeological information about early burials and burial practices. Wilberforce Cemetery has a high degree of intactness. Numerous original early grave markers survive, often in reasonable condition. Though the cemetery had an additional area included on its eastern boundary, the layout of the oldest part of the cemetery is still apparent.  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries It is of State heritage significance because Wilberforce Cemetery is one of the five cemeteries established as part of the core functions of the five towns founded by Governor Lachlan Macquarie in 1810. Wilberforce Cemetery demonstrates Macquarie's policy of ending the burial of deceased persons on their landholdings by establishing consecrated burial grounds in each of the towns he established. The cemetery contains a significant proportion of burials of convicts from the First, Second and Third Fleets. Of the burials at Wilberforce from 1811 to 1825, 36% were interments of convicts who arrived before 1800. Between 1811 and 1825, there was a considerable number of burials in the cemetery who were early ex-convict arrivals. Many were later joined by their families and descendants in the cemetery. A high number of older grave markers also survive, many of them for ex-convicts who arrived in the earlier period. Of all Macquarie's cemeteries, Wilberforce has the most interments with the highest proportional representation of ex-convict settlers from the First to the Third Fleets. Wilberforce is the only town of those founded by Macquarie which still retains the original buildings and burial ground at its centre. The visual inter- relationship of these elements is still apparent, as is the commanding position of the group on an elevated site. Many of the people interred in the cemetery founded families that continued to live in the area. Since Wilberforce was one of the original \\"hearth\\" areas of the colony from where settlers fanned out to settle other districts, Wilberforce Cemetery has significance for settlers across a broad expanse of the state. Many examples of altar style slab burial markers and a rare table slab monument remain within the cemetery. Wilberforce Cemetery is of State significance under this criterion. In conjunction with the schoolhouse-cum-chapel the cemetery has a strong ability to demonstrate Governor Lachlan Macquarie's vision for these towns. Wilberforce Cemetery was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 20 August 2010 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. It meets this criterion of State significance because Wilberforce Cemetery is one of the five cemeteries established as part of the core functions of the five Hawkesbury towns founded by Governor Lachlan Macquarie in 1810 as well as Liverpool on Georges River. Wilberforce Cemetery demonstrates Macquarie's policy of ending the burial of deceased persons on their landholdings by establishing consecrated burial grounds in each of the towns he established. The cemetery contains a significant proportion of burials of convicts from the First, Second and Third Fleets. Between 1811 and 1825, there was a considerable number of burials in the cemetery who were early ex-convict arrivals. Many were later joined by their families and descendants in the cemetery. A high number of older grave markers also survive, many of them for ex-convicts who arrived in the earlier period.

Windsor has more convict burials but they arrived later. Richmond cemetery is dominated by free arrivals. The original Pitt Town cemetery does not exist any more. Castlereagh cemetery was largely unused. Liverpool cemetery has been destroyed. Of the burials at Wilberforce from 1811 to 1825, 36% were interments of convicts who arrived before 1800. A total of over 70 people who arrived before 1800 are buried there and a number of original gravestones or markers remain from the early period. The earliest one dates from February 1816. Wilberforce Cemetery has exceptional significance for the State of NSW and for Australia. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. It meets this criterion of State significance because it was one of the five cemeteries founded by Governor Lachlan Macquarie as one of the core functions of the five Hawkesbury towns he established in 1810 and has a strong association with him. Wilberforce Cemetery demonstrates Macquarie's policy of ending the burial of deceased persons on their landholdings by establishing consecrated burial grounds in each of the towns he established. It contains a considerable number of interments of convicts who arrived before 1800. Many of them founded families who continued to live in the area. Additionally, since Wilberforce was one of the original \\"hearth\\" areas of the colony from where settlers fanned out to settle other districts, the Wilberforce Cemetery has significance for settlers across a broad expanse of the state. Wilberforce Cemetery has high significance for the state of NSW and for the nation under this criterion. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. It meets this criterion of State significance because Wilberforce Cemetery was an integral part of Governor Macquarie's scheme of creating towns with distinctive core functions aimed at improving the morality and social practices of the convict and ex-convict population. The towns he established had a church and school coupled with a burial ground at their core often in a commanding position. Wilberforce is the only town of those established by Macquarie which still retains the original buildings and burial ground at its centre. The visual inter-relationship of these elements is still apparent, as is the commanding position of the group on an elevated site. Positioned on a site personally selected by Macquarie during his visit, the cemetery is a significant landmark in Wilberforce particularly when viewed from the west and it punctuates the town with Macquarie's vision. Wilberforce Cemetery contains a remarkable collection of monuments from the early nineteenth century to the present day. Many styles of monuments survive including a fine collection of altar style slab monuments and a rare example of a table style slab monument. The work of one of the finest local masons, George Robertson of Windsor, is well represented in the cemetery. Wilberforce Cemetery is of State significance under this criterion. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. It meets this criterion of State significance because Wilberforce Cemetery has been a focus for the Wilberforce community since the 1810s. The original ex-convicts who were interred in the cemetery were joined by later generations of their families up to the present day. Later settlers have been interred there as well, so that the cemetery reflects the community. Additionally, since Wilberforce was one of the original \\"hearth\\" areas of the colony from where settlers fanned out to settle other districts, the Wilberforce Cemetery has significance for settlers across a broad expanse of the state. Hence, the Cemetery has become a place of pilgrimage for descendants from across the state and beyond, as well as being a focus for family reunions. Wilberforce Cemetery has high significance for the state of NSW under this criterion. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. It meets this criterion of State significance because Wilberforce Cemetery has been a focus for the Wilberforce community since the 1810s. The original ex-convicts who were interred in the cemetery were joined by later generations of their families up to the present day. Later settlers have been interred there as well, so that the cemetery reflects the community. Additionally, as one of the original \\"hearth\\" areas of the colony from where settlers fanned out to settle other districts, the Wilberforce Cemetery has significance for settlers across a broad expanse of the state. The monuments in Wilberforce Cemetery provide data for the study of the local community and for family history. The graves themselves provide potential archaeological information about early burials and burial practices, which would become apparent in any geophysical survey. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. It meets this criterion of State significance because Wilberforce Cemetery is the only surviving example of the towns that Lachlan Macquarie created where the schoolhouse-cum-chapel and cemetery remain. They have a strong ability to demonstrate Governor Lachlan Macquarie's vision for these towns. Many examples of altar style slab burial markers and a rare table slab monument remain within the cemetery. Wilberforce Cemetery is of State significance under this criterion. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. It meets this criterion of State significance because as the sole surviving example of Lachlan Macquarie's town centres which combined a schoolhouse-cum-chapel and cemetery it demonstrates the philosophy implicit in his town planning layouts. Wilberforce Cemetery has a strong ability to demonstrate Governor Lachlan Macquarie's vision for these towns.

It was built in 1839. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  =Indigenous occupation= The lower Hawkesbury was home to the Dharug people. The proximity to the Nepean River and South Creek qualifies it as a key area for food resources for indigenous groups.Proudfoot, 1987 The Dharug and Darkinjung people called the river Deerubbin and it was a vital source of food and transport.Nichols, 2010 =Non-indigenous occupation= Governor Arthur Phillip explored the local area in search of suitable agricultural land in 1789 and discovered and named the Hawkesbury River after Baron Hawkesbury. This region played a significant role in the early development of the colony with European settlers established here by 1794. Situated on fertile floodplains and well known for its abundant agriculture, Green Hills (as it was originally called) supported the colony through desperate times. However, frequent flooding meant that the farmers along the riverbanks were often ruined. Governor Lachlan Macquarie replaced Governor Bligh, taking up duty on 1 January 1810. Under his influence the colony prospered. His vision was for a free community for white colonists, working in conjunction with the penal colony. He implemented an unrivalled public works program, completing 265 public buildings, establishing new public amenities and improving existing services such as roads. Under his leadership Hawkesbury district thrived. He visited the district on his first tour and recorded in his journal on 6 December 1810: \\"After dinner I christened the new townships...I gave the name of Windsor to the town intended to be erected in the district of the Green Hills...the township in the Richmond district I have named Richmond...\\" the district reminded Macquarie of those towns in England, whilst Castlereagh, Pitt Town and Wilberforce were named after English statesmen. These are often referred to as Macquarie's Five Towns. Their localities, chiefly Windsor and Richmond, became more permanent with streets, town square and public buildings. Macquarie also appointed local men in positions of authority. In 1810 a group of settlers sent a letter to him congratulating him on his leadership and improvements. It was published in the Sydney Gazette with his reply. He was \\"much pleased with the sentiments\\" of the letter and assured them that the Haweksbury would \\"always be an object of the greatest interest\\" to him. In marking out the towns of Windsor and Richmond in 1810, Governor Macquarie was acting on instructions from London. All of the Governors who held office between 1789 and 1822, from Phillip to Brisbane, received the same Letter of Instruction regarding the disposal of the \\"waste lands of the Crown\\" that Britain claimed as her own. This included directives for the formation of towns and thus the extension of British civilisation to its Antipodean outpost.Proudfoot 1987, 7-9 =Stannix Park= The house is in the Dharug region and there is extensive evidence of Aboriginal occupation on the site. Large numbers of axe and spear rubbings are present on exposed rocks and archaeologists estimate that the site had been used for about 2000 years. Artefacts are common and a fine stone axe was found within 30m of the house in late 1986. A \\"canoe\\" tree is still growing about 100m from the house. Stannix Park was built in 1839 on a 1820-acre (736ha) grant made to settler, William Hall in 1837. Hall had first come to Australia in 1810 as a missionary aide to Samuel Marsden but went to New Zealand soon afterwards. His health forced him to return to Australia in 1825 and he sought a suitable grant for a growing heard of cattle, with his wife Dinah. His early applications were refused because of official confusion with a second William Hall who lived nearby at Pitt Town. The matter was eventually resolved and Hall was given authorized possession in 1829. At that time he was in charge of the Aboriginal school and mission at Blacktown, but by 1831 he had prospered to such an extent that he had a large house in Sydney on the corner of Pitt Street and Liverpool Street, another at Blacktown and 161 horned cattle. He stated that it was his \\"intention to engage a free person of good character to take charge of the grant\\" but by 1839 when the house was finished he had transferred his grant to his son Henry Hall. The initials of the latter and the date are expertly carved on the keystone over the arched door to the coach house. During the depression of the 1840s the house was heavily mortgaged to Thomas Tebbutt (the uncle of the astronomer John Tebbutt of Windsor) and others. Following Hall's death in 1844 the property was sold.Cutcliffe Real Estate, 2008 By 1851 it had come into the possession of Matthew Everingham III whose father had born in the colony in 1795 as the son of two first fleet convicts. His wife Sophia Arndell was a descendant of first fleet surgeon Thomas Arndell of Caddy Park. Everingham held the property until 1867 and his father was rescued by boat from the first floor during the great flood of that year. Other flood markings and records indicate that the water was 4.69 metres deep inside the building. The new owner was Peter De Rome, a young man who had made a fortune on the Araluen gold field. After his death in 1899 his wife, Amelia, continued to live in Stannix Park until 1906 when the property was subdivided into small lots (approx 50 acres each) and sold. A succession of absentee landlords followed and the house gradually fell into disrepair. It was bought in 1978 by a Mr R. Bennet who fitted a new roof before giving up the property. The 46 acre site and house were bought by Max and Lorna Hatherly in August 1983.M. Hatherley 1987 It was a ruin. The home had not been lived in for 40 years prior and was in poor shape with little but the structure intact. Architects Ian Stapleton and Clive Lucas drew up plans for the restoration while Stan Hellyer, a specialist in restoring buildings, oversaw the building phase. The house is one of about 20 stone colonial farm houses in the Hawkesbury Valley and is distinguished by the jerkin head roof and the fact that a coach (or cart) house with an impressive arched entrance was built into the main structure. The stone was quarried at 2 quarries, located on the site about 100 metres south of the building. Other features include 3 stone water tanks, each 9m by 2m. In 2009, the property was sold to Selena Mazuran, owner of the FBI Fashion College in Glebe.(Sydney Morning Herald, 3-4/10/09) She added 2300 square meters of adjoining land in 2012, with infrastructure such as three rotating solar panels, six rainwater tanks, a chapel, an outdoor chess set and a swimming pool.SMH, 19-20/4/2014  Description  The house is sited on 20 hectares (increased from 18 under Mazuran's ownership) on a low, reportedly \\"never-flooded\\" sandstone peninsula which is rounded by the flood plains of Currency Creek and Howe's Creek. The low timbered hills beyond these plains carry dry schlerophyll forest with occasional patches of wet schlerophyll vegetation on the southern sides. The levels are such that the plains flood regularly and there is no possibility of building on them. After flooding there is a large population of water birds. Normal bird life ranges from eagles (wedge tailed, sea and little) to small finches of various kinds.Sydney Morning Herald, 3-4/10/09 sale adviceSMH 19-20/4/2014 The property is situated at the end of a country lane and is approximately 46.5 acres of good arable grazing land. There is a large dam and a shed/garage with parking for two cars. It has 1.5 acres of mature gardens that follow European and Australian traditions with a mixture of exotic and native trees and shrubs. Within the garden with its outstanding rural outlooks, are an in- ground fishpond, gazebo, topiary, box (Buxus sp.) maze and a 15m analemmatic sundial. Tall forest red gums (Eucalyptus tereticornis) provide an imposing backdrop and there is considerable evidence of past aboriginal presence on the site. Stannix Park was built as a two-storey stone farm house with a usable attic and a single storey rear skillion. The steep ( 55') pitched roof is of jerkin head design. The double stone walls which are 64 cm thick and rubble filled are laid in 150 mm courses with dressed quoins at the corners and at the doors and windows. The skillion and the upper part of the rear wall collapsed about 30 years ago and the stone was removed. The upper wall was rebuilt in brick soon after. Photographs from 1900 show that the skillion had a kitchen area at the north end and an open wooden store or stable at the south. A 20th century verandah has been removed but during recent site clearing the base stones for four verandah posts were found together with the excavations in the rock platform in which they sat. The original verandah was 1.8 m wide and will be replaced later this year. The double doored archway to what was originally a cart or coach house has a keystone dated 1839 with the initials H.H. (presumed to be Henry Hall, the son of William Hall). The significance of a second inscription S11 is not known. In 1983 all windows were missing and the external doors were in very bad condition. The gable walls had partly collapsed at either end because of termite damage to the wall plates and the chimney was leaning dangerously. A new galvanized steel roof had been fitted by a previous owner. Today the walls have been repainted with lime mortar and the gables and chimney rebuilt. A new rear skillion has been erected on the original footings with a cavity brick wall and provision has been made to face this with 150 mm stone at a future date. The west wall of the suggested stable area has been faced with sawn weatherboards and the stone facing will link with this. The 1950s brick wall at the rear has been cement rendered and ruled to match the stone courses of the building. The doors and windows have been replaced to match original details. The doors are mostly of ledged and sheeted design with hand shaped hinges and hand made thumb latches or rimlocks that reproduce those used originally.The windows are of inward opening casement type where it was evident that these were originally used and in other positions six pane, double hung, box frames with wood sash lifts have been fitted. All joinery is of cedar and cedar panelling reveals have been fitted wherever these were used originally. Plaster ceilings are installed at the ground floor level where originally provided but all other ceilings have exposed joists; about 70% of these are original. The flooring in the main house is 150 mm box and in the skillion 150 mm tallow wood. The only early stairs in the building were a steep racked flight in the original cart house. These have been retained but a second flight has been installed at the ground floor level. The old ladder access to the attic has been replaced by a concealed stairway but the original attic trap door has been retained. Restoration work on the house has been carried out principally by Stonehill Restorations to plans and specifications prepared by Ian Stapleton of Clive Lucas Stapleton and Partners. The entrance from the front verandah leads to the large lounge room with a huge fireplace. The adjacent dining room retains the original hand-sawn timbers and the sandstone walls and floor. In the two upstairs levels there is a second lounge room and three large bedrooms offering views over the entire property. The house has two bathrooms, a large kitchen, a walk-in pantry and a sun room with a slow combustion heater. Sustainable living is a feature with 240 V solar power, large domestic water tanks and gas stove and hot water.  Heritage listing  Constructed in 1839, Stannix Park House is a rare and important colonial vernacular farm house of the Hawkesbury River area. The combination of farm house and carriage/cart house within a single building is most unusual and is believed to be unique in the area. It is reminiscent of its early English derivation. The house was built by an early colonist of some note and has been owned by the descendants of some of the earliest Australian families. Stannix Park House was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

Career =Public career= Obaid started his public career in February 2003 by being named as a Special Advisor for Strategic Communications to the Saudi Ambassador to the UK and then to the US. Based between London and Washington DC, he held the position until December 2006. Then, in February 2007, he became a Special Advisor to the President of Citizens Affairs at the Saudi Royal Court, based between Riyadh and Jeddah. Leaving that position in January 2011, he shortly thereafter became the Counselor for Foreign Media Affairs to the Saudi Minister of Culture and Information in Riyadh. In May 2011 he became the Counselor to the Saudi Ambassador to the UK. He held this position until January 2016. In 2006, Obaid was fired from the staff of Prince Turki Al Faisal, then Saudi Ambassador to the United States, for publishing an opinion piece in the Washington Post \\"contending that 'one of the first consequences' of an American pullout of Iraq would 'be massive Saudi intervention to stop Iranian-backed Shiite militias from butchering Iraqi Sunnis.'\\" The article also suggested that the Kingdom could cut oil prices in half, which \\"would be devastating to Iran.\\" While the Saudi government disavowed the piece and Prince Al Faisal cancelled his contract as a result, \\"Arab diplomats said...that Mr. Obaid's column reflected the view of the Saudi government, which has made clear its opposition to an American pullout from Iraq.\\" From September 2014 up to the present, Obaid has also served as CEO of the Essam and Dalal Obaid Foundation (EDOF), based in Geneva, Switzerland. EDOF was founded by Obaid and his two brothers to honour the humanitarian legacy of their parents. EDOF supports organizations that are doing important work in the fields of medical research and social progress in order to help them fulfill their already proven track record of success. Some of the projects that EDOF has supported include initiatives with the Mayo Clinic, the CNN Freedom Project, and the International Committee of the Red Cross, among others. EDOF also funded the creation of the Essam and Dalal Obaid Center for Reconstructive Transplant Surgery at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. Since April 2018, Obaid has been a Commissioner at the Commission for International Justice & Accountability (CIJA). CIJA is a non-profit, non-governmental organisation dedicated to conducting criminal investigations during armed conflict and analysing evidence of genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. CIJA is apolitical and carries out its investigative activities independently from any government. Through its work CIJA provides support for local police forces, war crimes and counterterrorism investigations, and countering violent extremism (CVE) programmes. CIJA has been especially implicated in the Syrian civil war. Since 2012, CIJA Investigators have smuggled more than a million government documents out of Syria, many of them from top secret intelligence facilities. ‚ÄúThe documents are brought to the group‚Äôs headquarters, in a nondescript office building in Western Europe, sometimes under diplomatic cover.

Igor Rotenberg has been under United States sanctions since 6 April 2018. Igor is the majority shareholder in Gazprom Drilling. Early life and education Igor Rotenberg was born on 9 September 1974 in Leningrad to Arkady Rotenberg. In 2002, he graduated from the Higher School of Privatization and Entrepreneurship () in Pushkino, Moscow, and received his PhD in Law in 2005 in Kaliningrad at the Kaliningrad Law Institute of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia of the St. Petersburg University of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia.Abstract: Real estate as an object of civil rights by Rotenberg, I. A. (Igor Arkadyevich), published by the library of the Faculty of Law at the Scientific Library. M. Gorky St. Petersburg State University, updated 16 December 2009. Career From 2002 to 2003, he was the Deputy Head of the Department of Property of the Fuel and Energy Complex in the Ministry of Property of Russia which later became Federal Agency for State Property Management in 2004. From 2003 to 2004, he was the Head of the Department of Transport and Telecommunications Property for the Property of Russia. From 2004 to 2005, he was the Vice-President of Russian Railways OJSC and acted as the Head of the Department of Property Management and Organizational Structures. Since 2006, he is the owner and the chairman of the board of directors of the Moscow-based NPV Engineering Group. Since 2008, he is the Vice-President of the design bureau CB \\"Northern Sea Route\\" (). Since 2010, he is the chairman of the board of directors of Mosenergo Heat and Power Company. Since 2011, he is the chairman of the board of directors of Gazprom Burenie LLC (Burgaz). In 2015, Arkady Rotenberg sold his son Igor Rotenberg a number of assets including up to 79% of Gazprom Drilling (Bureniye), 28% of the road construction company Mostotrest, and 33.3% of Jersey-based TPS Real Estate Holdings Ltd. Alexander Ponomarenko and Aleksandr Skorobogatko own 66.6% of TPC Real Estates Holdings. It was reported that Arkady Rotenberg made this move after being placed on the U.S. sanctions list. In 2015, OJCS TPS Real Estate () is one of the largest commercial real estate developers in Russia that manages several shopping centers in Russia and Ukraine. It is 100% owned by TPS Real Estate Holding Ltd. It owns the Krasnodar Gallery (), Sochi's Moremoll (), and Kiev's Ocean Plaza (). It is building the Novosibirsk Gallery () and Moscow's Slavyansky Boulevard metro station and Polezhayevskaya metro station. At the end of 2016, TPS Real Estate managed 12 shopping center with a total area of over 2 million square meters. In 2016, Igor Rotenberg was at the center of a controversy surrounding Platon, a company he half-owns, and alleged discrepancies in its contracts with the federal road agency, Rosavtodor. Operated by RT Invest, the Platon toll system electronically tracks and charges tolls to trucks over 12 tons on Russian Federal roads. With a 25% ownership by Rotenberg and using satellite tracking data, ScanEx (), a subsidiary of RT Invest, is developing an electronic map of the of Russian federal roads in order to track vehicles for payment to Platon. Approved on 29 September 2014 by Roman Starovoyt (), who is the head of Rosavtodor, and Alexander Sovetnikov (), who is the director of RT ‚Äì Invest Transport Systems (RTITS) (), Rotenberg, through his companies, is guaranteed to receive from the state budget a very large portion of the 10.6 billion rubles indexed to inflation each year without VAT (4.98 billion rubles paid semi-annually) from 15 November 2015, to 29 September 2027, which is paid to the Planton & RT Invest partnership. After this was revealed, a large strike across Russia by truck drivers occurred on Russian federal highways beginning November 2015. Instead of the expected total revenues from Platon of 20 to 40 billion rubles, the actual revenues were 25% or less than those figures. On 29 March 2018, Igor sold his 33.3% stake in TPS Real Estate Holdings for $1 billion to his sister Liliya Rotenberg (). Sanctions On 6 April 2018, Igor Rotenberg and his NPV Engineering Group were placed under United States sanctions. Wealth In October 2018, Igor Rotenberg had an estimated wealth of $1.1 billion by Forbes. Personal life He is married, with three children.

Types =Hardware kill switch= A hardware kill switch (HKS) is a physical switch that cuts the signal or power line to the device or disable the chip running them. Examples Inter- component communication pathways for an example device that uses a security switch * A cellphone is compromised by malicious software, and the device initiates video and audio recording. When the user activates the ‚Äúprevent capture of audio/video‚Äù mode of the security switch, that either physically disconnects or cut the power to the microphone and the camera, which stops the recording.https://www.fastcompany.com/90349731/the-hardware-trend-google- amazon-and-apple-are-throwing-their-weight-behind * A laptop that has an embedded security switch is stolen. The security switch detects a lack of communication from a specific external source for 12 hours, and responds by disconnecting the screen, keyboard and other key components, rendering the laptop useless, with no possibility of recovery, even with a full format. * A user wishes to prevent tracking of their location. The user then activates geolocation protection and the security switch disables all GPS communication, eliminating the possibility of tracking the device's location. * A user desires to eliminate the possibility of their PIN being copied from his/her smartphone. They can activate the secure input function, causing the security switch to disconnect the touch screen from the operating system, so input signals are not available to any devices except the switch. * A security switch performs scheduled monitoring and finds that a program is attempting to download malicious content from the internet. It then activates internet security function and disables internet access, interrupting the download. * If laptop software is compromised by air-gap malware, the user may activate the security switch and disconnect the speaker and microphone, so it can not establish communication with the device. History Google started to work on a hardware kill switch for AI in 2016. In 2019, Apple, and Google, along with a handful of smaller players, are designing ‚Äúkill switches‚Äù that cut the power to the microphones or cameras in their devices.

It is an elongated ridge, over long and high, that stretches in a northeast-southwest direction and has two flat tops; it rises to a minimum depth of . The Mid-Pacific Mountains lie west of Hawaii and northeast of the Line Islands. It was probably formed by a hotspot, but the evidence is conflicting. Volcanic activity occurred during the Turonian- Cenomanian eras 100.5‚Äì89.8 million years ago and another stage has been dated to have occurred 88‚Äì82 million years ago. Between these volcanic episodes, carbonate deposition from lagoonal and reefal environments set in and formed limestone. Volcanic islands developed on Horizon Guyot as well and were colonised by plants. Horizon Guyot became a seamount during the Coniacian- Campanian period. Since then, pelagic ooze has accumulated on the seamount, forming a thick layer that is further modified by ocean currents and by various organisms that live on the seamount; sediments also underwent landsliding. Ferromanganese crusts were deposited on exposed rocks.  Name and research history  The seamount is named after the research vessel and is also known as Horizon Ridge, Horizon Tablemount, Gora Khorayzn and . During the Deep Sea Drilling Project, the drill cores called Site 44 and Site 171 were taken on Horizon Guyot in 1969 and 1971, respectively; a further drill core was obtained north of the seamount at Site 313 in 1973. This seamount is the best studied seamount of the Mid-Pacific Mountains and more is known about its morphology than any other seamount of the Mid-Pacific Mountains.  Geography and geology  = Local setting = Horizon Guyot lies west of Hawaii and is part of the Mid-Pacific Mountains. Unlike conventional island chains in the Pacific Ocean, the Mid-Pacific Mountains feature an oceanic plateau with guyots (also known as tablemounts) which become progressively younger towards the east. Other guyots in the Mid-Pacific Mountains are Sio South, Darwin, Thomas, Heezen, Allen, Caprina, Jacqueline, Allison and Resolution. South of Horizon Guyot, deep water in the \\"Horizon passage\\" leads into the Line Islands and Horizon Guyot is sometimes considered to be a member of that chain. The seamount rises - to a minimum depth of ‚Äì, and is a ridge wide and over long; Horizon Guyot is the largest seamount in the Mid-Pacific Mountains. It trends in a southwest-northeast direction with an orientation matching that of other structures in the region such as fracture zones on the seafloor. Faulting has been observed on the western side of the seamount. Two summit platforms lie on the ridge. The eastern one is the larger of these platforms and the western oval-shaped platform lies close to the western end of the ridge. These platforms are relatively flat and are surrounded by a slope break beyond which the guyot falls off steeply to the surrounding abyssal plain. This appearance characterises Horizon Guyot as a guyot although the elongated shape is unlike that of most guyots in the region which have one circular summit platform. At the margin of the platform, lie terraces which are up to wide and up to high and that discontinuously surround the summit platform; the flat surfaces of the terraces may be former fringing reefs. On the eastern summit platform there are buried terraces beneath the sediment cover. Sediment layers cover almost the entire summit of Horizon Guyot, and consist mainly of sand, with clay and silt making up a minor part. Features on the sedimented seafloor are flat areas, hummocks, ripples and sediment waves. Seismic transects have revealed a relief of about in the underlying basement and the presence of a central peak. Material obtained in drill cores includes chalk, chert, hyaloclastite, limestone, ooze and sandstone; basalt and chert outcrop in some places. In certain areas boulders and cobbles cover the seafloor; ferromanganese crusts cover exposed rocks. The seamount shows evidence of repeated mass failures; including hummocky terrain, scarps and slump blocks, which are on average thick. Landsliding is probably triggered by earthquakes; after the failure the landslides either stay coherent and do not travel far but some advance quickly and far. Talus blocks up to in size cover the seafloor around Horizon Guyot. = Regional setting = The West Pacific Ocean seafloor contains many guyots of Mesozoic age (251.902 ¬± 0.024 ‚Äì 66 million years ago) that developed in unusually shallow seas. These are submarine mountains which are characterised by a flat top and usually the presence of carbonate platforms that rose above the sea surface during the middle Cretaceous (c. 145‚Äì66 million years ago). During the Second World War, it was discovered that the seafloor of the Western Pacific Ocean was dotted with numerous flat-topped seamounts. These were promptly identified as sunken islands; at first, it was believed that they had sunk below the water in the Precambrian (over 541 ¬± 1 million years ago), before the presence of Cretaceous reefs on many of them was noticed. About 6% of the Pacific seafloor is covered with almost a million seamounts. While there are some differences to present-day reef systems, many of these seamounts were formerly atolls. All these structures originally formed as volcanoes in the Mesozoic ocean. Fringing reefs may have developed on the volcanoes, which then became barrier reefs as the volcano subsided and turned into an atoll; the barrier reefs in turn surround a lagoon or tidal flat. The crust underneath these seamounts tends to subside as it cools, and thus the islands and seamounts sink. Continued subsidence balanced by upward growth of the reefs led to the formation of thick carbonate platforms. Sometimes volcanic activity continued even after the formation of the atoll or atoll-like structure, and during episodes where the platforms rose above sea level erosional features such as channels and blue holes developed. The formation of many such seamounts has been explained by the hotspot theory. According to this theory, an active volcano lies on a spot of the lithosphere heated from below; as the plate above this hotspot moves, the volcano is moved away from the heat source and volcanic activity ceases. The hotspot will then heat the area of the plate now above it, producing another active volcano. In this way, a chain of volcanoes that get progressively older away from the currently active one is generated. With some exceptions, radiometric dating of the Mid-Pacific Mountains has yielded evidence of an eastward movement of volcanism which is consistent with the hotspot theory; in the case of Horizon Guyot, volcanism may have migrated southwestward which is not entirely consistent with the hotspot theory. When it formed, Horizon Guyot may have been located close to a spreading centre. = Composition = Volcanic rocks dredged from Horizon Guyot are of basaltic composition and define a tholeiitic suite. Augite, labradorite, olivine, plagioclase and pyroxene form phenocrysts while pigeonite is found in the groundmass. Other guyots and samples from the Mid-Pacific Mountains have similar compositions to these found on Horizon Guyot. Some volcanic rocks occur in the form of hyaloclastite which contains palagonite and sideromelane. Dredged volcanic rocks are heavily altered; this has given rise to analcime, augite, calcite, clay, clinoptilolite, iddingsite, ilmenite, labradorite, magnetite iron oxides and talc. Carbonates are found as limestone and siltstone; some limestones were formed by living beings. At one point in the drill core, carbonates were found mixed with volcanic rocks; presumably this is a place where hyaloclastite accumulated and was reworked by sea currents. The limestone contains fossils of algae, bryozoans, echinoids, foraminiferans, molluscs and ostracods; dinoflagellates, pollen and scolecodonts are also found. Some limestones have been modified by silicification and phosphatisation. Clinoptilolite, pyrite, radiolarian fossils and yellow glass shards are found in the ooze, and some volcanic rocks and manganese rocks are cemented by indurated ooze. Ferromanganese and phosphorite crusts coat rocks. These ferromanganese crusts consist of iron oxides and manganese oxides and are related to manganese nodules and might become targets for future mining efforts. Other materials found on Horizon Guyot are analcime, barite, calcite, celadonite, cristobalite, glauconite, gypsum, ironstone, kaolinite, mica, montmorillonite, mudstone, quartz, sapropel, smectite and zeolite.  Geologic history  Horizon Guyot is at least of Albian (c. 113‚Äì100.5 million years ago) age and is perhaps as much as 120 million years old. Radiometric dating has yielded ages of 88.1 ¬± 0.4 million years and more recently of 82.5 ¬± 0.4 million years; this may reflect either prolonged volcanism or that the older date is incorrect. About 100 and 80 million years ago a pulse of volcanism occurred in the Pacific Ocean; the formation of Horizon Guyot may have coincided with this pulse. = Volcanism = Basalt lava flows were emplaced on Horizon Guyot during the Cretaceous, before or during the Albian. A second volcanic phase occurred during the Turonian (93.9 ‚Äì 89.8 ¬± 0.3 million years ago) and Cenomanian (100.5 ‚Äì 93.9 million years ago); thus volcanic activity on Horizon Guyot was recurrent. The basalts include both typical ocean island basalts and basalts resembling mid-ocean ridge basalts, with the former found deeper in drill cores. Hyaloclastites which outcrop at the margin of the summit platform indicate the occurrence of submarine eruptions. Eruptions probably occurred on aligned vents, explaining the elongated shape of Horizon Guyot. At first the formation of the terraces was also attributed to volcanic activity; an origin as wave cut terraces was considered to be unlikely but when it was found that Horizon Guyot had risen above sea level in the Cretaceous a wave cut origin was reproposed. = Carbonate island phase and renewed volcanism = During the Cretaceous, carbonates accumulated on Horizon Guyot while it subsided, forming a carbonate deposit which in one drill core is thick. The carbonates accumulated directly on the previous volcano and reefs started growing when volcanic activity was still underway; Horizon Guyot featured lagoonal environments with algal reefs. Prior to 1973 there was no evidence that Horizon Guyot had ever formed an island but later a stage of emergence was postulated. The seamount was an island for at least 6 million years. During the late Cretaceous, a second volcanic episode took place on Horizon Guyot and produced volcanites and volcanic sediments which buried older limestones. At that time, volcanic activity was underway not only on this seamount but also in the Line Islands; on Horizon Guyot this phase occurred perhaps as much as 30 million years after the previous volcanic stage. Before this volcanic phase, Horizon Guyot had emerged from the sea and erosion had reworked some older rocks; also, plants grew on the now exposed island. Shallow water deposition in Coniacian (89.8 ¬± 0.3 ‚Äì 86.3 ¬± 0.5 million years ago) or Santonian (86.3 ¬± 0.5 ‚Äì 83.6 ¬± 0.2 million years ago) to Maastrichtian (72.1 ¬± 0.2 ‚Äì 66 million years ago) time has been inferred from the presence of unstable coccoliths of such age in drill cores. = Drowning and sedimentation = Horizon Guyot reached above sea level at least until the Cenomanian, unlike other Mid-Pacific Mountains guyots which sank below sea level during the Albian. Plant remnants are found in rocks of Turonian and Coniacian age, implying that Horizon Guyot was still emergent at that time; but by the Coniacian, Horizon Guyot was submerging. It is not known why Horizon Guyot drowned but the burial of the reefs by volcanic activity may have played a role. Pelagic sedimentation commenced in the Campanian (83.6 ¬± 0.2 ‚Äì 72.1 ¬± 0.2 million years ago) when Horizon Guyot had already sunk to a depth of . Since the Miocene (23.03 ‚Äì 5.333 million years ago), sedimentation rates appear to have decreased as the guyot moved away from waters with high biological productivity and at some point in the last 10 million years erosion increased due to bottom currents linked to the glaciation of Antarctica. Pelagic sediments accumulate on some guyots after they have drowned. A dome- shaped cap of pelagic ooze accumulated on top of Horizon Guyot during the Tertiary, reaching a maximum thickness of - in some places. In the saddle between the summit platforms it is about thick; an unconformity separates it from Cretaceous deposits. The sediment layers span a timespan encompassing the Eocene (56 ‚Äì 33.9 million years ago) to the Quaternary (last 2.58 million years) with gaps in the sediment sequence between the Cretaceous and the Eocene and between the Eocene and the Oligocene (33.9 ‚Äì 23.03 million years ago). During the Eocene and Oligocene, older foraminifera were redeposited; there is evidence that sediments were actively eroded. During Tertiary phases of low sea level, sea currents swept sediments off the surface of Horizon Guyot, with fine sediments being particularly affected. = Present state = The top and almost all the upper slopes of Horizon Guyot are covered by sediments. Chert and chalk are found within the sediments; chert forms seismically reflective layers within the sediment cap. These layers crop out at the margin of the sediment platform. The seamount lies in a region of the Pacific with nutrient poor surface waters. Sea currents are unusually strong on the top of Horizon Guyot, probably due to the interaction of the slopes of Horizon Guyot with tidal currents. The seamount induces its own semidiurnal tide and the sea currents reach their maximum at the margin of the summit platform where have been measured. Scour marks have been observed. The currents sweep down the seamount slopes and may act to remove sediment from the seamount surface; this also results in sediments accumulating to form steep slopes that undergo landsliding. Most of the sediments however are transported upslope; those which do end up at the bottom of the seamount form talus deposits around Horizon Guyot.  Ecology  alt=A video of animal life on the dark seafloor, with tree like animals, animals looking like large hooks and animals looking like white sacs attached by thin stalks to the seafloor The surfaces of Horizon Guyot are inhabited by many organisms. Fish found on Horizon Guyot include batfish, bathypteroids, chimeras, morids, sharks and synaphobranchid eels. Brittle stars, chaetognatha (arrow worms), copepods, corals, crustaceans, hydroids, loricifera, molluscs, nematodes, nemertinea, ophiuroids, ostracods, polychaetes, sipuncula, squat lobsters, vermes and xenophyophorans make up the bulk of the fauna on Horizon Guyot today. At least 29 macrofaunal species have been found. Other lifeforms presently active on the seamount are barnacles, crinoids, echiurids, enteropneusts (acorn worms), gorgonians, holothuroids (sea cucumbers), pennatulids (sea pens), sponges and starfish. Unidentified stalk or twig-like creatures have also been observed on the platform, which are among the most common lifeforms there. Bacteria are also found in the sediment. Biological activity has left traces in the sediments such as mounds, pits, and trails on the surface. There is a certain zonation in the ecology of Horizon Guyot; for example suspension feeders live on the margin of the summit platform. Genetic differences between individuals of a given species which live on the top and these which live at the foot of the guyot have been noted. Some ostracods found on Horizon Guyot such as Cytherelloidea appear to have evolved from Cretaceous shallow water species as the seamount sank into colder waters.

Williams rose to prominence alongside drummer Yussef Dayes in 2016 as one half of the short-lived London-based jazz group Yussef Kamaal following the release of the duo's debut album, Black Focus, which earned them the 'Breakthrough Act' award at the 2017 Jazz FM awards. In addition to live instrumentation, Williams also releases electronic music under his given name Henry Wu.  Early life  Williams was born as Henry Wu in Peckham, South London to a Taiwanese mother and British father. Growing up, Williams took an interest in learning Mandarin and Chinese calligraphy. From an early age, Williams was involved with a number of creative pursuits. His interest in calligraphy, as well as his parents' involvement with graphic design, contributed to an interest in street art and graffiti culture, an influence which is reflected in the album art of later projects such as Black Focus and The Return. Williams took an early interest in music. In primary school, he learnt drums and percussion which he played in the school band. It was during this time that Williams cultivated a formative grounding in jazz, funk and house music. His father introduced him to jazz with songs by Miles Davis and John Coltrane. Alongside an interest in jazz, Williams also developed a taste for garage and grime music, citing the 2001 release Execute by fellow South Londoners Oxide & Neutrino as a major influence.  Career  After attending high school, Williams attended the Bermondsey Centre of Southwark College, where he studied music production and learned to play the keyboard. Around this time, Williams began gigging regularly around London, eventually landing a place in the band of Katy B alongside drummer Joshua McKenzie. In 2008, Williams put on a show with the then fourteen-year-old drummer Yussef Dayes, with whom he would later form Yussef Kamaal. Williams remained with Katy B for two years before leaving the band to focus on his own music. From 2012 onward, Williams released a number of short, broken-beat and house releases under the name Henry Wu, including 2014's Natural Complexion, which featured former bandmate and fellow London musician, Ed 'Tenderlonious' Cawthorne. In 2013, Williams assisted Cawthorne in establishing 22a, a London- based, artist run record label. Amidst this period, Williams almost quit music. In 2012, he sold what he approximates to be 80% of his musical equipment, citing \\"disillusionment\\" as the main contributing factor. = Yussef Kamaal = In 2016, Williams recruited both Dayes and Cawthorne to perform at the 2016 Worldwide Awards hosted by London DJ and broadcaster Gilles Peterson. Williams and Dayes were subsequently signed to Peterson's independent label, Brownswood Recordings. The duo released their debut album, Black Focus, under the name Yussef Kamaal in November 2016. The album was met with critical acclaim. Clash Music described the sound as \\"exceptional, vital\\" and \\"enthralling\\"; whilst Canadian magazine Exclaim! described it simply as \\"dope\\". The album was widely praised for its unique blend of sounds traditionally associated with jazz, hip hop and breakbeat music. Williams revealed that large amounts of the album were improvised in the studio, and emphasised the importance of musical dialogue between the musicians in structuring the performances. The album was engineered by Malcolm Catto of The Heliocentrics and recorded at his studio in London. Williams praised his \\"old school\\" approach to recording and crediting him with mixing two of the tracks on the album. Williams and Dayes collaborated for a brief and tumultuous period following the album's release. Shortly before embarking on a tour of the United States, the band were refused entry to the country after Dayes' visa was revoked in accordance with an executive immigration order implemented by the Trump Administration. Several weeks later, the duo announced their split. Williams has since been reticent regarding the incident, but has maintained that he continues to admire and support Dayes in his solo ventures. On his split with Dayes, Williams commented: \\"Nothing has really ended; it travelled into something new and fresh now.\\" = The Return and Black Focus Records = In the years following, Williams established his own label, Black Focus Records. Less than two years after the release of Black Focus, Williams enlisted the services of former bandmate and drummer Josh 'MckNasty' McKenzie and bassist Pete Martin to produce his solo bandleader debut, The Return. The album was recorded in the South London house Williams grew up in. The album was recorded over the course of a week. Recording engineer Richard Samuels remarked that, despite having the opportunity to record in professional studios, the performance of the musicians in a familiar and comfortable environment was conducive to a \\"free flowing album\\". The Return was received as a \\"sequel\\" to Black Focus and charted in the UK at number 63. The album holds an aggregated score of 76 on Metacritic, indicating \\"generally favourable\\" reviews. The album was praised for its blend of genres, a sound Williams has called \\"a London thing\\". Pitchfork praised the album for its sonic palette, and offered light criticism with respect to the brevity of some of the tracks. The album peaked at sixty-three on the UK charts. The release of The Return prompted Williams' first global tour, spanning across the UK, Europe, Australian and New Zealand, with former bandmate Mansur Brown as support. Brown would also be the second artist under Black Focus Records. The album was supported by the release of a music video for Salaam, the album's opening track. The video was directed by Greg Barnes and was shot in Marrakesh, Morocco, which according to Williams, \\"is a special place for me, [going there is] a huge inspiration for my work.\\" Williams dedicated the album to the victims of the Grenfell Tower fire of 2017. Following the album's release, The Return was remixed by Snips with vocal samples from the Wu-Tang Clan. The Return was nominated for 'Independent Album of the Year' at the 2018 AIM Independent Music Awards. In 2020, Williams released his second album Wu Hen. = Career as Henry Wu = Williams hosts a monthly radio show on NTS Radio as Henry Wu, playing a selection of music from his influences and associated acts in the London scene. In 2015, Williams collaborated with fellow London based producer, K15, to produce an EP entitled WU15.  Musical style  Williams has emphasised the importance of rhythm in his music. Having previously been a drummer, Williams aims to bring a percussive approach to the keyboard. He was initially influenced in producing hip hop in the style of 90s boom bap. Williams' sound on Black Focus and The Return has been called a blend of several genres, among them jazz, funk, hip hop, grime, garage and broken beat. Despite citing influences such as Miles Davis, John Coltrane and Herbie Hancock, Williams has frequently rejected the term 'jazz' being applied to his music, rejecting the \\"elitist\\" and traditionalist connotations it evokes. He has instead opted to create music under the eponymous genre of 'Wu funk'. Piotor Orlov of NPR said that \\"[Williams'] 'jazz' is grounded in post- Mwandishi Herbie Hancock, Bob James' \\"Nautilus\\" and J Dilla productions.\\" Williams has also listed Jamiroquai, Roy Ayers and Donald Byrd as influences. Williams has frequently stressed the influence that his home city, London, has had on his music. Speaking on The Return, Williams emphasised the fact that the album represents all of London, in that the various contributors came from a diverse cross-section of the city's areas. When playing live, Williams said that he with his own band \\"completely improvise with the base of the song. On the night we don‚Äôt know how it‚Äôs going to sound. Spontaneous and loose in the structure, it allows us to express ourselves. We just let it roll out.\\" When Williams performed with Dayes in Yussef Kamaal, Jochan Embley wrote in a 2017 gig review that \\"When you see the south London duo play together, with that preternatural ability to predict and effortlessly follow whichever direction the other is about to fly off into, you‚Äôd think they had been playing together for a lifetime.\\" = Instruments = On his album The Return, Williams has used a Nord Electro keyboard, a Roland Juno 106 and a Wurlitzer piano.  Personal life  Williams adopted the name Kamaal upon converting to Islam in 2011. According to a 2018 interview, religion has played a key role in Williams' approach to his career, reminding him to remain humble and grateful in the face of success. The doctrinal principles of Islam are the \\"foundations\\" of Williams' beliefs, and, according to the artist, \\"translate into his music\\". In a 2018 interview, Williams said on the topic of changing his name: \\"...as a creative it just allows you to express yourself in a different way. Henry Wu is my ethnic background, and Kamaal is my spiritual background.\\" In another interview with The Indian Express, Williams stated: \\"Kamaal Williams is more like a conceptual band, and Henry Wu is the DJ, the producer, the mastermind\\". Speaking of public recognition, Williams said that \\"being in the limelight is something that I‚Äôm very conscious of.\\" Further stating: \\"I‚Äôm just in this for the music and to provide my family.‚Äù  Discography  = As Henry Wu = * Stir Fry Beats (2012) * Natural Complexion (2014) * Negotiate EP (2015) * Good Morning Peckham (2015) *¬£¬£ CRUCIAL WU ¬£¬£ (2015) * 27 Karat Years (2016) * Deep in the Mud (2017) *Shades of Wu (2017) * Projections EP (2018) = With Yussef Kamaal = * Black Focus (2016) = As Kamaal Williams = * The Return (2018) * DJ-Kicks: Kamaal Williams (2019) * Wu Hen (2020) = Collaborations =  WU15  * WU15 (2015)  References  Category:Living people Category:Brownswood Recordings artists Category:People from Peckham Category:Acid jazz musicians Category:British Muslims Category:21st-century British musicians Category:British male drummers Category:British people of Taiwanese descent Category:British keyboardists Category:21st-century male musicians Category:1989 births Category:Converts to Islam ","title":"Kamaal Williams"},{"id":"58641741","text":"Ewesdale is a glen and former lordship in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland.

Contributions to the taxonomy of needle- shaped Fragilaria and Ulnaria species. Lauterbornia 78: 1-73, 30 pl., 2 tables However, a recent study using both molecular and morphological data has shown that F. gracilis is separated from other similar long Fragilaria taxa, and can be identified by both its rbcL barcode, and by using light microscopy (LM). In LM, is can be identified by its quite stable character of almost parallel valve sides (in the long cells) and the clear opposite arrangement of the striae giving the impression of regularly arranged parallel lines across the valve in LM. These characters are also in agreement with √òstrup's original description of 1910 of almost linear valves, and Tuji's Tuji, A.

These alternate parts are however not common, even if Lange-Bertalot and Ulrich (2014) define the striae as ‚Äúopposite or alternating‚Äù. Note that the term ‚Äúparallel‚Äù refers to the orientation of the striae to each other, while the terms ‚Äúalternate/opposite‚Äù refers to whether the striae on either side of the sternum F. gracilis has been isolated and cultured to clones several times, and the Thonon Culture Collection (TCC) is hosting living strains.

While the North Vietnamese attacks were initially successful they were eventually forced out by the South Vietnamese. Background Quang Duc Province was important commercially for its vast timber resources and militarily for both sides in the war because of the lines of communication that passed through it. After the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) had closed surface travel from Saigon to Ph∆∞·ªõc Long by the direct route through B√¨nh D∆∞∆°ng Province, the only land access available to the South Vietnamese was via Ban Me Thuot and Quang Duc. As far as the PAVN was concerned, Quang Duc was essential to the extension of its Route 14 out of Mondulkiri Province, Cambodia, and Darlac Province, South Vietnam. Because Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) forces controlled Highway 14 as far south and west from Ban Me Thuot as the Tuy ƒê·ª©c crossroads (), the PAVN's new Route 14 had to pass through Cambodia and reenter South Vietnam in that salient of Mondulkiri Province that juts into Quang Duc near Bu Prang. The site of the abandoned U.S. Army Special Forces Bu Prang Camp was perched atop a high, forested ridge astride Highway 14 near the Tuy ƒê·ª©c crossroads at the Cambodian border. Before reaching the Phuoc Long border of South Vietnam's III Corps, Highway 14 was joined at the hill town of Kien Duc () by Local Route 344, coming over from the Quang Duc Province capital of Gia Nghƒ©a. This road junction was vital because its control provided an alternative route from Ban Me Thuot through Dak Song and Gia Nghƒ©a on Provincial Route 8B. Important as well was the road junction at Dak Song (), where Provincial Route 8B left Highway 14. Until mid-May 1973 when the PAVN's projection of its new line of communication reached Bu Prang and while the South Vietnam's access to Ph∆∞·ªõc Long through Quang Duc remained unthreatened, neither side paid much attention to Quang Duc. ARVN engineers were working on local roads, primarily to improve access to the timber forests in the northeast section of the province, and the only PAVN activity of any note was mining to harass and delay this project. Only three Regional Force battalions were located in the province, supported by six 105-mm. howitzer platoons (12 guns), which had had no occasion to fire since the 28 January ceasefire. Additionally, 27 Popular Force platoons were scattered about the province. These were nearly all Montagnards, and the province population was 60 percent tribal. Around the beginning of May, a Regional Force patrol, moving out from its outpost near Bu Prang made contact with a PAVN reconnaissance party and killed four. The rest of May and June were quiet until PAVN harassment of the RF positions around Bu Prang began in early July, evidently in response to the unusually aggressive patrolling ordered by Col. Nguyen Hau Thien, Quang Duc's province chief. Mortar attacks, accompanied by some light infantry probes, continued through July, as did RF forays into the old Bu Prang positions on the border west of the Tuy ƒê·ª©c crossroads. In the last week of August, Col. Thien tried a reconnaissance in force with two RF battalions. Both met heavy resistance short of their objectives on the border and returned to camp. This inconclusive skirmishing took on an ominous note in early September when the first evidence appeared disclosing that COSVN had sent two battalions of its 271st Independent Regiment from southwest of T√¢y Ninh up to Quang Duc. The presence of a PAVN main force regiment was a new and dangerous development in Quang Duc. Colonel Thien asked for reinforcement and was given an RF battalion from Darlac Province. He complained about the poor performance of the Darlac battalion, and II Corps commander General Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn To√†n agreed to replace it with another battalion from Khanh Hoa Province. This gave Colonel Thien a force of four RF battalions, which he located at the mutually supporting bases of Bu Prang and Bu Bong (), each with a platoon of 105-mm, howitzers. The 271st Independent Regiment had been roughly handled by the ARVN and Republic of Vietnam Air Force (RVNAF) in the early months of 1973 in marsh and ricelands along the V√†m C·ªè ƒê√¥ng River and the Cambodian border in H·∫≠u Nghƒ©a and southern T√¢y Ninh Provinces. COSVN had pulled it back to Cambodia in April for reorganization and recuperation. Afterwards the regimental headquarters and two of its battalions, the 8th and 9th, were trucked to B√π ƒê·ªëp Camp in northern Ph∆∞·ªõc Long Province, while the other, the 7th, was sent to operate under Long An Province authority. Leaving B√π ƒê·ªëp, the 271st marched through B√π Gia M·∫≠p District and arrived northwest of Bu Prang in late August, ready to assist in the defense of the new line of communication and to deny the ARVN use of Highway 14 in the border region. Successive attempts by the Quang Duc territorials failed to gain any ground west of the Tuy ƒê·ª©c crossroads, while the rest of Quang Duc Province remained relatively quiet. Meanwhile, PAVN preparations for the Quang Duc campaign continued. A task force headquarters, designated Unit 95, was established at B√π ƒê·ªëp, and the PAVN 205th Independent Regiment was assembled there for movement to Quang Duc. The 205th had been operating since the ceasefire in South Vietnam's III Corps, and before moving to B√π ƒê·ªëp it had been in northern B√¨nh D∆∞∆°ng Province east of the Michelin Rubber Plantation. Three more maneuver elements joined the task force at B√π ƒê·ªëp before its composition was complete: the 429th Sapper Regiment, the 46th Reconnaissance Battalion, and a tank battalion (probably the 20th) from the COSVN 26th Armor Group. Artillery support was provided by the 208th Artillery Regiment, 69th Group, COSVN, which had been operating in B√¨nh Long Province. Antiaircraft artillery, including 23 mm automatic cannons, joined the force as well as a detachment equipped with SA-7 antiaircraft missiles. Unit 95 had reached division strength, but this was not yet realized at South Vietnam's II Corps headquarters. Given the meager defenses in Quang Duc, it was surprising that the PAVN leadership committed a force of such overwhelming size. The fact that it did so appeared to reflect the inadequacy of PAVN tactical intelligence and a respect for South Vietnamese capabilities. Such a commitment also underscored the importance attached to the principal objective-construction and protection of the line of communication. Much later South Vietnamese intelligence officers discovered that continued offensive operations by the PAVN's Quang Duc task force were designed to draw South Vietnamese forces into the province and keep them occupied, thereby reducing the forces available for employment against the PAVN's B3 Front. By the end of September 1973, reconnaissance and survey parties from the 208th Artillery Regiment had selected firing positions and observation posts near the Tuy ƒê·ª©c crossroads at Bu Prang, Bu Bong and Kien Duc. Firing batteries moved into Quang Duc by the end of October with their 85 and 122 mm field guns and 120mm mortars. To ensure consistency in survey and firing, the only maps authorized for use in the 208th Artillery were the 1:50,000 series printed in Hanoi. The PAVN 205th Infantry Regiment, with the 429th Sapper Regiment attached, arrived in assembly areas near Bu Prang in mid-October and on 23 October the 208th Artillery began a five-day rehearsal preparatory to the attack. Meanwhile, the 271st Regiment with the 46th Reconnaissance Battalion moved toward Dak Song. Battle The 208th Artillery began softening up Bu Prang and Bu Bong on 30 October. Each day 122 mm rockets and mortar and artillery shells fell on the two camps. The camp commander kept his four RF battalions outside the perimeter, patrolling near the Tuy ƒê·ª©c crossroads and the local defense of the two positions was the responsibility of an RF company, an engineer platoon and the two platoons of artillery. The attack began just before dawn on 4 November. The PAVN 205th Regiment, with the 429th Sappers and two companies of tanks and armored personnel carriers, overran the badly outnumbered and outgunned defenders. They destroyed two ARVN howitzers, towed the other two away and outside the camps dispersed the four RF battalions. During the assault on Bu Bong, the commander of the PAVN 205th Regiment was seriously wounded and had to be evacuated. General To√†n responded rapidly to the situation in Quang Duc Province, although he had only sketchy information concerning the PAVN's strength and dispositions. He immediately ordered the ARVN 23rd Division to pull the 53rd Infantry out of western Kontum Province and get it started toward Ban Me Thuot. As this order was being executed the PAVN attacked Dak Song on Route 8B, the only land access to Quang Duc from Ban Me Thuot. The defenses at Dak Song crumbled under assault of the PAVN 271st Regiment and Gia Nghƒ©a, the province capital, was cut off. But the 53rd Infantry was on the way and by 8 November, its 1st Battalion was approaching Dak Song. The 2nd Battalion, 53rd Infantry, was flown into Nhon Co airfield () west of Gia Nghƒ©a and began moving north on Highway 14 toward Bu Prang and Bu Bong. Meanwhile, the PAVN 205th Regiment began executing the next phase of its orders: it turned over the defense of the newly won positions at Bu Prang and Bu Bong to another element of the task force and began deploying south generally along Highway 14 from Bu Prang toward the Doan Van bridge. In the early morning of 14 November, the PAVN 3rd Battalion, 205th Regiment, with a platoon of tanks hit the defensive perimeter of the ARVN 2nd Battalion, 53rd Infantry. The 2nd Battalion held, knocking out 2 tanks and capturing 9 crew- served weapons and 27 automatic rifles. The PAVN left 100 dead on the field. A second attack was repulsed the next day with moderate losses to the PAVN. The 3rd Battalion, 205th Regiment, had to be withdrawn as only 100 effective soldiers remained in the ranks. Despite these serious losses the 205th continued its advance south toward Kien Duc. With only the 2nd and 3rd Battalions available (the 1st was still engaged near Dak Song), the ARVN 53rd Infantry prepared to defend the Kien Duc road junction. The 205th Regiment began probing these defenses on 21 November. On the 23rd PAVN leaflets were found around Kien Duc, signed by the Commander in Chief VC Forces, advising the South Vietnamese to stop trying to retake Bu Prang, Bu Bong and Dak Song and threatening to attack Gia Nghƒ©a with tanks if the South Vietnamese persisted. While skirmishing took place around Bu Prang, Dak Song, and Kien Duc, General To√†n continued to send forces to Quang Duc. The 21st Ranger Group and the 44th and 45th Infantry Regiments of the 23rd Division began their deployments. In the highlands, the 22nd Division pulled back from western Pleiku in order to assume the defense of Kontum, vacated by the departing 23rd Division. On 28 November the 44th Infantry Regiment with a battalion of Rangers, attacked into Dak Song, forcing the withdrawal of the reinforced PAVN 271st Regiment, which pulled back toward Duc An, leaving blocking elements on Route 8B. On 4 December the 205th Regiment, reinforced with the 429th Sappers and supported by tanks and the 208th Artillery Regiment, attacked the Kien Duc road junction, wounding the regimental commander and forcing the elements of the 53rd Infantry to withdraw 6 km east to Nhon Co airfield. Casualties were moderately heavy on both sides; the 53rd lost 40 killed, 40 wounded, and 80 missing. The 205th quickly began to replace some of its losses; about 100 fresh troops, recently arrived from North Vietnam, joined the regiment at Kien Duc on 8 December. General To√†n flew to Saigon to report on the Quang Duc situation to President Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Thi·ªáu and General Cao VƒÉn Vi√™n. Thi·ªáu told him not to be concerned about lost outposts, but to direct his efforts to the destruction of the PAVN forces in Quang Duc. That same day To√†n ordered the 23rd Division commander to put his command post in Gia Nghƒ©a and to fly his 45th Regiment to Nhon Co. Within hours six C-130s landed elements of the 23rd Division at Nhon Co, although the airfield there was under intermittent artillery and rocket attack. That night and the next day, the 21st Rangers removed the last road blocks on Route 8B south of Dak Song. Casualties were heavy, but the first convoy since September soon rolled into Gia Nghƒ©a from Ban Me Thuot. Although the commander of the 53rd Infantry had recovered from his wound and asked for the mission of retaking Kien Duc, Colonel Tuong, commanding the division, assigned the task to the 45th Infantry. This regiment was fresh, while the 53rd's battalions had been in nearly constant action for a month. Following an intense and effective artillery and air preparation, the 23rd Division's Reconnaissance Company and the 3rd Battalion, 45th Infantry, led the attack into the trenches, bunkers, and rubble at the Kien Duc road junction. The PAVN 205th Regiment was forced to withdraw with heavy losses; its 1st Battalion lost 40 percent of its strength at Kien Duc, and its sapper company was so decimated that it was disbanded after the battle. A rallier later reported that the 205th lost more than 200 killed and 400 wounded in its Quang Duc campaign. Aftermath The 23rd Division, using its 44th Regiment continued operations during December and early January, primarily in the Bu Prang-Bu Bong area against the PAVN 271st Regiment's forces remaining there. With the route again secured from Ban Me Thuot through Gia Nghƒ©a to Ph∆∞·ªõc Long. General To√†n's responsibilities in the highlands and B√¨nh ƒê·ªãnh Province demanded that the 23rd Division leave Quang Duc Province to deal with more pressing threats. In Quang Duc the PAVN exploited the benefits of prolonged and detailed preparation and capitalized on its ability to concentrate overwhelming force against lightly defended objectives. Although these factors combined to produce success in the initial battles, the South Vietnamese, employing rapid air deployment, close air support and artillery fire, and its experienced regular infantry won the campaign. The PAVN was denied the use of Highway 14 through Quang Duc, its line of communications in the border region around the Tuy ƒê·ª©c crossroads remained subject to harassment and interdiction, and the South Vietnamese were able to regain and keep control of the logistical route to Ph∆∞·ªõc Long. Quang Duc proved once again that the South Vietnamese, provided sufficient ammunition, fuel and maintenance support, could overcome the traditional advantages enjoyed by the attacker.

Three days later, police authorities traced the suspects to a local church called the Seven Angels Ministry, a compound the local authorities soon learned doubled as an isolationist cult that encouraged under age girls to have sex with the church leaders as a tribute to God. The police raid resulted in a shootout, killing seven people within the compound, some of whom the police believed to have orchestrated the shooting at the local precinct three days earlier. Seven Angels Ministry The church was established in 1986 by Siphiwo Mancoba in Umzimkhulu, Kwazulu Natal. It was initially called Angel Ministry, an acronym for All Nations God‚Äôs Evangelical Lamp Ministry. Mancoba recorded most of his teachings, distributing them among his subordinates. They were then tasked with spreading his \\"word\\" from village to village, thus creating a recruitment system which encouraged people to come to him for salvation. Shortly after his death in April 2015, his seven sons refused to succeed him as leaders of his church, choosing instead to breakaway and form Seven Angels Ministry, which would be led by their mother. The church was for the most part closed off to the general public. Education and a paid work outside of the church were believed to be doctrines of devil worship. Members of the ministry were required to relinquish all of their cars, money and properties as gifts to the \\"Angel Brothers\\" if they wish to join the congregation. Police Killings It is believed that church was experiencing financial strain, as they struggled to house and feed the many congregants that lived within the church's compound. Police believed this was the prime motivator for the events that occurred on 21 February. Unknown attackers at the time walked into the Ngcobo Police Station and opened fire. Three police officers were killed instantly, with an off-duty soldier shot dead. The gunmen had earlier killed two additional police officers at a location 60 km from the police station. The attackers took off with a police van and ten firearms, weapons that were used to rob a Capitec Bank ATM not far from the police station. Police Response On 23 February 2018 the SAPS went along with the Hawks and the National Intervention Unit and Tactical Response. They infiltrated the Seven Angels Ministry compound after receiving a tip-off about the whereabouts of the firearms used in the Ngcobo Police Shooting. A shootout between police officials and the suspects left seven people within the compound dead, three of whom were Mancoba brothers. Over ten arrests were made that day, with four of the suspects being directly linked to the shootout that occurred days earlier at the police station. Young girls and women were rescued from the compound. Sex Cult In the days following the arrests made at Seven Angels Ministry, more than 40 women and young girls whom authorities believed were sex slaves for the Mancoba brothers were taken in for questioning. A majority of the women rescued from the compound were under the age of 25, with some being as young as 12 years old. Children were also not allowed to have birth certificates. Despite all of them being married, the Mancoba brothers considered the many other women in the compound as their wives too; satisfying the brothers sexually was seen as a service to God. The majority of the women who were questioned about the cult were not forthcoming with information to authorities; and even after the shootout with police officials, they demanded to return to Seven Angels. Commission of Inquiry The Seven Angels Ministry had already been under investigation since 2016 by the Commission for Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities (CRL), for breach of ethics. Currently in South Africa, there is no legislation to self-regulate newly formed religious bodies. Appearing before the commission in 2016, Banele Mancoba, the leader of the church, explained their purpose as a being of divine intervention on earthly matters; it consisted of seven representatives. While the investigation into Seven Angels Ministry was private at the time, the chairperson of the CRL, Thoko Mkhwanazi-Xaluva, did forward recommendations to a parliamentary portfolio committee to expedite actions against the Mancoba brothers, but they were rejected. The portfolio committee made its own recommendations to the CRL, that it should convene a national consultative conference to engage all religious bodies. The parliamentary portfolio committee sent these recommendations on the same day the Ngcobo killings took place.

History The Navy Royal inaugurated squadron colours during the reign of Elizabeth I (1558-1603) to subdivide the English fleet into three squadrons. There were three classes of admirals and differentiated by using coloured flags. In 1620 the official Flag ranks of Admiral, Vice Admiral, and Rear Admiral were legally established that arose directly out of the organisation of the fleet into three parts.

One of the women, Bluma Wyszogrodzka (center), was shot. The other two, Ma≈Çka Zdrojewicz (right) and Rachela Wyszogrodzka (left) were marched to the Umschlagplatz and deported to Majdanek concentration camp, where Wyszogrodzka was murdered. J√ºrgen Stroop, the SS officer who commanded the suppression of the uprising, admired the bravery of female combatants and included the photograph in one of the copies of his official report. The photograph has become symbolic of Jewish resistance to the Holocaust. Background During the summer of 1942, most of the Jews in the Warsaw Ghetto were deported to Treblinka extermination camp. In January 1943, when the Germans resumed deportations, the Jewish Combat Organization staged armed resistance. Jews began to dig bunkers and smuggle weapons into the ghetto. On 19 April 1943, about 2,000 soldiers under the command of SS and Police Leader J√ºrgen Stroop entered the ghetto with tanks in order to liquidate the ghetto. They expected to quickly defeat the poorly armed Jewish insurgents, but instead the Warsaw Ghetto uprising, the largest act of Jewish resistance against the Holocaust, dragged out for four weeks. The Germans had to set the ghetto on fire, pump poison gas into bunkers, and blast the Jews out of their positions in order to march them to the Umschlagplatz and deport them to Majdanek and Treblinka. The hopeless act of defiance became \\"one of the most significant occurrences in the history of the Jewish people\\", according to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Photograph 26 of the Warsaw version During the suppression of the uprising, Stroop sent daily communiqu√©s to Higher SS and Police Leader Friedrich-Wilhelm Kr√ºger in Krak√≥w; Propaganda Company 689 and Franz Konrad took photographs to document the events. Selected photographs and communiqu√©s were compiled, along with a summary of German actions, as the Stroop Report, a personal souvenir for Heinrich Himmler. The report was intended to promote Stroop's efficiency as a commander and excuse his failure to clear the ghetto quickly. The report memorialized the supposed heroism of the SS men who participated in the suppression of the uprising, especially the sixteen who were killed by Jewish fighters. For comparison, more than 7,000 Jews were shot during the uprising, the vast majority noncombatants. The original title of the report was The Jewish Quarter of Warsaw is No More! (). Reflecting Nazi propaganda, the report dehumanized the Jews, describing them as \\"bandits\\", \\"lice\\", or \\"rats\\" and their deportation and murder as a \\"cleansing action\\". Instead of being killed or murdered, Jews were \\"destroyed\\". Three copies of the report were made, for Himmler, Kr√ºger, and Stroop. One copy of the Stroop Report is held by the Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) in Warsaw. Another copy of the report, which did not include this photograph, was entered into evidence at the Nuremberg Trials, and is held by the United States National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). People depicted The photograph appeared on the cover of a 1948 book about the Stroop Report. The only woman in the photograph who survived was the one at right, Ma≈Çka Zdrojewicz. With other young women imprisoned in the Warsaw Ghetto, she was forced to work in a brush factory. As the final liquidation of the ghetto approached, Zdrojewicz and her colleagues deserted their jobs and descended into the sewers, stockpiling arms to resist the Nazis. She later testified that she smuggled arms into the ghetto in her boots and kept a cache under her bed. During the uprising, women deployed Molotov cocktails and other improvised weapons. As the uprising was crushed, Zdrojewicz and some other resistance members hid in an underground bunker with stockpiled weapons, but they were found and forced out by SS men. According to Zdrojewicz, the Germans lined the Jews up against the wall and shot some of them, including Bluma Wyszogrodzka, the woman in the center of the photograph. Zdrojewicz and Bluma's sister, Rachela Wyszogrodzka, the woman on the left of the photograph, were marched to the Umschlagplatz and deported to Majdanek concentration camp. Zdrojewicz survived, but Rachela Wyszogrodzka did not. Zdrojewicz immigrated to Israel in 1946, married (changing her name to Horenstein), and had four children. Due to her injuries she was considered 75% disabled by the Israeli authorities. Horenstein's testimony was published by Yad Vashem. The original caption of the photograph was Mit Waffen gefangene Weiber der Haluzzenbewegung (\\"Hehalutz women captured with weapons\\"). J√ºrgen Stroop later described the bravery of the Jewish women who took up arms: Legacy Yellow badges photoshopped onto the women's lapels The photograph is known as a famous representation of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising and of Jewish resistance during the Holocaust. The photograph was used for the first day of issue cover for a Polish stamp commemorating the seventieth anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. The original cover was controversial, since the graphic designer added yellow badges to the left lapels of the women. In fact, Jews in the Warsaw Ghetto were forced to wear blue Stars of David on white armbands, and the combatants discarded their armbands because they considered them humiliating symbols of Nazi oppression. Because of the lack of historical accuracy, some people objected to the cover. The cover was reissued without the Star of David badges.

Written by Florida planter and Quaker Zephaniah Kingsley, it was first published under the signature ‚ÄúA Resident of Florida‚Äù in 1828, although Kingsley's name is found at the end of the Preface. It was reprinted in 1829, 1833, and 1834, indicating significant readership. No other pro-slavery writing in the United States was reprinted as many times. Kingsley believed that \\"free people of color\\", better treated in Spanish Florida than in the American South, should be allowed to own property, and other rights, and made the case that they were beneficial to the country in which they lived. Kingsley's \\"Address to the Legislative Council of Florida\\" The Treatise was preceded by Kingsley's \\"Address to the Legislative Council of Florida [of which he was a member] on the subject of its Colored population\\", about 1826. In this speech, published in 2000, he calls upon the Legislative Council to accommodate the \\"free colored population\\", so that they have a \\"friendly feeling toward the white population\\". This is necessary for \\"our personal safety as well as the permanent condition of our Slave property\\" (\\"the most numerous, valuable & productive class [of] our population\\"). In other words, and he cites examples, the free blacks would side with the whites in protecting them from slave insurrection or other slave misconduct. This \\"Address\\", having fallen on deaf ears, was followed by his resignation from the Legislative Council. Within 10 years, Kingsley, in despair over the situation of free blacks, departed from the United States. He moved with his multiple wives, slaves, and free blacks to a new plantation in what is now the Dominican Republic but at that time was part of Haiti. The Treatise In the meantime, he attempted to influence public opinion towards \\"free people of color\\" by means of his self-published Treatise. In the Preface, declaring himself a \\"votary of rational policy\\", he states that his object is \\"to destroy the prejudice existing against slavery\\". According to Kingsley, if slavery is practiced with \\"justice\\" and \\"benevolence\\", slaves are just as happy as free men, equally as virtuous, less \\"corrupted\\", far more productive, and \\"they yield more support and benefit to the state\\". Furthermore, \\"the slave or Patriarchal System of Society...is better adapted for strength, endurability and independence, than any other state of society hitherto adopted.\\" =Blacks are suited for a hot climate= In the body of the Treatise, he sets forth the view that blacks are better suited than whites for working in a hot climate. \\"The negro under the management of a just, conscientious and humane master (of which description it will certainly be allowed that there are some)...will surely enjoy a happier and more enviable state of existence than the poor white man... who has to contend with cold and hunger, besides religious and moral tyranny.\\" \\"The labor of the negro, under the wholesome restraint of an intelligent direction, is like a constant stream.\\" =Nations with slaves are stronger= According to Kingsley, a slave state is more powerful in case of war. He examines other \\"slave holding states\\". In the case of Brazil, the war between Brazil and \\"the Republic of Buenos Ayres\\" (he refers to the Cisplatine War) shows the strength of a slave state contrasted with the weakness of a white antislave state. The Brazilian slaves did not respond to the Argentine offers of freedom and protection if they escaped. \\"This trait of virtue and fidelity in the Brazilian slaves, is to be attributed to humane and just treatment.\\" Under Brazilian law, any slave, in theory, could buy his freedom. Slaves are allowed to own some property, such as \\"stock\\". \\"The persons, properties, and rights...[of] the free people of color...are protected by law,\\" and \\"the free children of quarteroons and a white man are white by law.\\" In the British colonies (he claims this is also true of the \\"Spanish, French, and Dutch colonies\\") the \\"free colored people\\" are \\"gradually rendered fit to take place of the whites, whose lives have long been uselessly sacrificed to a hot climate, which does not, nor can ever agree with them.\\" In fact, many of the \\"free colored people... being rich and liberally educated, enjoy great respectability, and having the same interest with the whites, and great influence with the slaves, form a barrier to insurrection.\\" Again, quarteroons with a white father were legally white. In the case of Haiti, or Hayti as he spells it, many liberated slaves remained productive, on plantations, throughout the revolution. Some were armed and defended their masters. But when the \\"patriarchal restraint of its Colonial system of government\\" was gone, productivity declined greatly, as there is \\"less necessity for hard work\\" in \\"a healthy, fertile, and mild climate such as Hayti, where few clothes are required, and bountiful nature produces spontaneously the necessities of life.\\" =The virtues of negros= \\"From all these facts it follows that, under a just and prudent system of management, negros are safe, permanent, productive and growing property, and easily governed; that they are not naturally desirous of change but are sober, discreet, honest and obliging, are less troublesome and possess a much better moral character than the ordinary class of corrupted whites of similar condition. Despite this, in slaveholding states, the white majority, who inhabit the \\"high, healthy country,\\" have ‚Äúa strong feeling of prejudice against every other shade of color‚Äù. As the colored are \\"absolutely necessary\\", a \\"smaller degree of prejudice against color would better comport\\". However, in our slaveholding states, \\"the great quantity of whites in the up country is at all times ready to put down or exterminate all the colored people in the case of insurrection.\\" They govern by \\"fear and force\\", instead of \\"wisdom and policy\\". North Carolina, \\"by the liberal provisions of her constitution and enlightened policy to her free, colored people\\", is the state most favorable to free blacks; \\"I believe no disadvantage has ever been perceived in North Carolina from its free citizens of color being allowed to vote\\". (The right of free North Carolina blacks to vote was taken away in 1835.) As in the British West India colonies, taxes should be the same on everyone, \\"and the law both criminal and civil should be as impartial as the sun\\". Southern plantations will be most productive if: * There is no fear of a slave insurrection, and * They are sure of being able to resist \\"war or invasion\\". =Racial mixing as policy= \\"How much more meritorious and laudable [than improving domestic animals] would that philanthropist be to whose energy and moral courage mankind were indebted for exposing and removing a prejudice that not only continues to entail ill health and degeneracy on the people, but completely neutralises the physical [defensive] strength of the country, by placing one portion of the inhabitants in hostile array against the other.\\" In other words, Kingsley was advocating deliberate racial mixing, as a step towards eliminating the racial \\"problem\\". This he personally practiced; he purchased his first wife in Cuba, and later three other slaves, all of which he freed, as common-law co-wives or concubines. He commented on the \\"convenience\\" of being able to purchase wives, or sexual partners. He asserted that people of mixed negro and white parents were healthier and more beautiful than either Africans or Europeans, and considered his mixed-race children a barrier to an impending race war. \\"The red aborigines were in this country a healthy people. The negroes are not only a healthy people, but robust and durable even in the swamps. The intermediate grades of color are not only healthy, but when condition is favorable, they are improved in shape, strength and beauty.... Daily experience shows that there is no natural antipathy between the casts [sic] on account of color; and it only requires to repeal laws as impolitic as they are injust and unnatural; which confound beauty, merit and condition in one state of infamy and degradation on account of complexion, and to leave nature to find out a safe and wholesome remedy for evils which, of all others, are now the most deplorable, because they are morally irreconcilable to the fundamental principles of happiness, and self preservation.\\" =Kingsley's notes= Kingsley accompanied his 8-page text with 6 pages of notes, 5 of them occupied by one note, in which he expounds on the harm done by \\"white preachers (missionaries) from England\\". The rebel Denmark Vesey was heavily involved in religion. While inveighing against \\"superstition\\", he does note that two \\"influential negroes\\", loyal to their masters and preventing others from escaping, \\"were Africans and professors of the Mahomedan religion\\". He also speaks against \\"a favorite project of some of our least mathematical economists\\", the transporting of slaves to Africa, which he saw as prohibitively expensive. \\"A great opportunity was lost of colonising more rationally at the evacuation of the Spanish part of Saint Domingo [Haiti], where there would have been ample room for all the colored people of the U. States, within five days sail of Charleston.\\" Reception Although it was published four times, reception was mixed. While some Southerners used it to defend the institution of slavery, others saw Kingsley's support of a free class of blacks as a prelude to the abolition of it. Abolitionists considered Kingsley's arguments for slavery weak and wrote that logically, the planter should conclude that slavery must be eradicated. Lydia Child, a New York-based abolitionist, included him in 1836 on a list of people perpetuating the \\"evils of slavery\\". Although Kingsley was wealthy, learned, and powerful, the treatise was a factor in the decline of his reputation in Florida, and his decision to leave the United States.

It collects and exhibits material relating to the surveying of Queensland and the maps created. It is a sub-branch of the Queensland Museum. It actively digitises and makes available historic maps and aerial imagery under open licences.  Collections  Land exploration and surveying has played a crucial role in the development of Queensland. Surveyors and cartographers played an active part in establishing Queensland's borders, physically surveying the land as well as creating maps, survey plans and registers. The historical input of the surveying and mapping industry to the development of Queensland is an important factor in the role the department plays in providing a valuable resource for a wide range of community interests and government. In its short history the museum has established a comprehensive collection, housing many important maps, survey plans and artefacts, significant to the history of mapping, surveying and land development particularly in Queensland. The museum acquires, preserves, catalogues and displays information and artefacts pertaining to historical land settlement, surveying and cartographic activities in Queensland. = Collection strategy = The museum aims to identify records, artefacts, maps and plans that are useful in filling gaps in the knowledge about the history of mapping and surveying in Queensland, and make such knowledge accessible. New material is constantly being identified as important for research purposes.  Historical collections  The museum's physical and digital collections include: * historical maps and plans * historical photographs * aerial photography * artefacts * biographies of surveyors and cartographers * documents (e.g. early Queensland Treasury rental sheets) * publications.  History  The bust of Augustus Charles Gregory scultured by Oscar Fristrom in 1905 stands at the entrance to the museum, 2020 In 1982, the Queensland Government through the Surveyor General of Queensland, JM Serisier ordered that a mapping and surveying museum be set up in order to preserve the mapping and surveying history of Queensland. The original museum was established in the Lands Administration Building, (now the Conrad Treasury Hotel), and Bill Kitson was tasked with establishing and operating the museum. With the support of the department and the mapping and surveying industry Kitson set about collecting artefacts, which were rapidly disappearing as technology overtook the traditional means of creating maps and surveys. The museum‚Äôs collection grew from simply holding artefacts to include diaries, artwork, photographs and biographies which captured the personal and social history of those involved in surveying and mapping. Many historical maps of Queensland were also acquired. In 1987, the museum moved to the newly constructed Landcentre building in Woolloongabba. In 1988, in order to preserve the artefacts that had been collected an agreement was signed with the Queensland Museum to become custodian of the collections whilst the government provides staff to manage and run the museum. In 1991, the focus of the museum was broadened and it was renamed the Museum of Lands, Mapping and Surveying to include history of land development in Queensland. In 2018, the museum relocated to 317 Edward Street in the Brisbane CBD. In late 1905 Brisbane article Oscar Fristrom sculpted a bust of Augustus Charles Gregory, the first Surveyor-General of Queensland. In February 1906, Fristrom offered to sell the bust to the Royal Geographical Society of Queensland but the society decided not to buy it; however, they did display it at an event in June 1906. For many years the bust was displayed at Freemasons‚Äô Gregory Lodge in Cairns (Gregory being depicted wearing his Masonic regalia). In 2018, the Freemasons donated the bust to the museum. As at 10 March 2020, the bust is at the entrance of the museum.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010. History Flint was incorporated as a city in 1855. At the time, the area cemetery was beginning to decay, so in 1857 a group of leading citizens met to plan the construction of a cemetery suitable for the new city. The group formed the Glenwood Cemetery Association. Thirty acres of land was quickly acquired, and George T. Clark hired as a civil engineer. The new Glenwood Cemetery formally dedicated in October 1857. A gateway, chapel, and receiving vault (all now long-demolished) and the sexton's office (still standing) were built soon after, and the grounds graded and landscaped, including broad, winding roads and footpaths. The cemetery added six acres of land in 1901, and constructed a new mausoleum in 1914. No further additions to the cemetery grounds were made, and the Glenwood Cemetery Association continues to own and operate Glenwood Cemetery. Significant burials at Glenwood include: * Jacob Smith, the first European settler of Flint (1780-1825). * Henry H. Crapo, Michigan governor (1804-69). * Josiah W. Begole, Michigan governor (1815-96). * J. Dallas Dort, carriage maker and early auto pioneer (1861-1925). * Charles Stewart Mott, director of General Motors (1875-1973). * Harlow H. Curtice, CEO of General Motors (1893-1962). Description Glenwood Cemetery is located on high, rolling ground overlooking the Flint River. The grounds are heavily wooded, and laid out with curving pathways through the grounds. A tall black wrought iron fence fronts the cemetery, and contains a main entrance with double-leaf iron gates between square random ashlar masonry gate posts of whitish random ashlar masonry that support double-leaf iron gates. Just inside the gate is the original sexton's office, a one-and-a-half-story gable-front building with a shed-roof addition. A second, similar entrance is located down the street. The later addition to the cemetery, located at the far eastern side, contains a Neoclassical mausoleum of gray granite. The grounds contain gravestones and monuments dating from the founding of the cemetery through the present. Early monuments include a substantial number of white marble markers, many of them obelisks, dating from the late 1850s to the 1870s. A few early sandstone and limestone monuments are also in the cemetery. The majority of monuments are granite, coming in a range of hues, dating from the 1880s and later.

Gyldendal, 1994 The Oslo dialect has been considered to be an extinct form of Norwegian, but there are surviving fragments of it, especially on the East End of Oslo.Oslofolk har tatt livet av hunkj√∏nn , Aftenposten Originally, the Oslo dialect was the dialect of the lower social stratas, primarily the workers, farmers and peasants. The dialect is related to nearby East Norwegian dialects. After the industrialization of Oslo (Christiania/Kristiania) at the end of the 19th century, the Oslo dialect was almost exclusively associated with workers and the east end. As a contrast, the upper and middle classes would speak a language more akin to Dano-Norwegian. In the post-war period, much of the industry near the city centre was demolished. This contributed to the decline of the Oslo dialect. History The Oslo dialect has since the late 19th century been strongly associated with the East End of Oslo and other working- class areas of the city, but has seen a decline since the post-war period. It existed side-by-side with Dano-Norwegian, the latter being more associated with the upper and middle classes. Workers moving up the social ladder would adopt Dano-Norwegian. Since the end of the 20th century, the Oslo dialect has been in decline due to higher education levels, growth of media, and larger social mobility. This has caused the Oslo dialect to be considered a low- standard language, which is occasionally looked down upon in modern times. Since the 1970s, the Oslo dialect (in its original form) has practically been considered extinct, although natives of Oslo can show typical influence of the Oslo dialect during informal and casual speech. Perhaps the most known examples of Oslo dialect in Norwegian are the Olsenbanden movies, set in Norway from the 1950s to the 1970s. The main characters of Benny, Egon and Kjell speak a dialect close to the original Oslo dialect.

The quake was located away from the provincial capital Palu and was felt as far away as Samarinda on East Kalimantan and also in Tawau, Malaysia. This event was preceded by a sequence of foreshocks, the largest of which was a magnitude 6.1 tremor that occurred earlier that day. Following the mainshock, a tsunami alert was issued for the nearby Makassar Strait, but was called off half an hour later. A localised tsunami struck Palu, sweeping shore-lying houses and buildings on its way. The combined effects of the earthquake and tsunami led to the deaths of at least 1,407 people and injured a further 632. This makes it the deadliest earthquake to strike the country since the 2006 Yogyakarta earthquake, as well as the deadliest earthquake worldwide so far in 2018. The Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics (BMKG) confirmed that a tsunami had been triggered with its height reaching an estimated maximum of , striking the settlements of Palu, Donggala and Mamuju along its path.

It was first performed on 30 December 1976 at the Semperoper, staged by Harry Kupfer.  History  Zimmermann grew up and studied in the German Democratic Republic. In his opera ', he had chosen a political topic, a scientist's conflict, located in a present-day city there. In contrast, Der Schuhu und die fliegende Prinzessin is a fairy tale in a utopia, but with political analogies and allusions. Zimmermann wrote the opera on a commission from the Staatsoper Dresden, after completing his opera '. The libretto, by the composer and Eberhard Schmidt, is based on an eponymous fairy tale by Peter Hacks, which appeared in 1964 in a literary magazine, Sinn und Form, and which was arranged in dramatic form shortly after. The opera was premiered at the Staatsoper on 30 December 1976, staged by Harry Kupfer and conducted by Peter G√ºlke. A first performance in West Germany was staged at the Staatstheater Darmstadt in 1977, and a shorter version was presented at the Salzburg Festival in 1995, directed by and conducted by the composer. Der Schuhu und die fliegende Prinzessin was published by Breitkopf in both the original version which takes about 165 minutes to perform, and the abridged Salzburg version of 120 minutes.  Plot  The fairy tale by Hacks reflects the situation of a divided Germany in the Cold War. It tells of a bird (Schuhu) which can cross borders without problems. The opera has been called a Parabel √ºber Sehnsucht nach Liebe und Gl√ºck in anachronistischen Verh√§ltnissen (parable about the desire for love and happiness under anachronistic circumstances). The wife of a poor tailor delivers her tenth child, which is not a baby but an egg, from which a Schuhu (bird-man) emerges. It can magically turn little into plenty (\\"aus wenig viel\\"). The mayor is interested and buys the Schuhu from his father, but as the Schuhu also makes bad things worse, he soon wants rid of it. The Schuhu, unwanted even by its parents, sets off on a series of adventures, first being turned away by the Grand Duke of Coburg-Gotha and then being hired by the Emperor of Mesopotamia as a nightwatchman. He meets the Flying Princess, daughter of the King of Tripoli, and they fall in love. Both the Grand Duke and the Emperor also compete for the Princess, and join their armies to fight the Schuhu. He wins her, but she soon elopes with a Dutchman for a season, before returning to the Schuhu and following him to a new-found land. Roles  Three of the roles are performed by individuals: * The Schuhu (baritone) * The Flying Princess (soprano) * Mann im Frack (conductor, speaking role) Twelve actors play further roles, including those of village people, watchmen, snails, spinach plants, warriors, 10,000 scientists and sparrows: * First Soprano: tailor's wife * Second Soprano: first snail * Third Soprano: first spinach plant * First Contralto: neighbour * Second Contralto: second snail * Third Contralto: second spinach plant * First Tenor: mayor, scientist, warrior * Second Tenor: superior snail-herd, Schuhulogist * Third Tenor: first spinach gardener * First Bass: tailor, king of Tripoli * Second Bass: emperor of Mesopotamia * Third Bass: Duke of Coburg-Gotha, Starost of Holland  Music  In a parable, the composer is free to use traditional forms, also to create an ironic distance (\\"ironische Distanzierung\\"), but can use creative imagination for sounds of a utopian sphere. The opera is played by two identical chamber orchestras, both featuring: * 2 flutes (also piccolo), oboe, 2 clarinets * French horn, 2 trumpets, trombone * timpani and percussion * piano * singing saw * solo strings: violin 1+2, viola, cello, double bass with an additional barrel organ (Leierkasten), being imitated by a quartet of recorders, and tape. All 34 musicians and the technician for the taping play on stage and have scenic actions. The two orchestras symbolize the places of the world in conflict, Coburg-Gotha versus Mesopotamia. Zimmermann regarded opera as a Lehrspiel (teaching play). One aspect is to use unconventional processes on stage. The opera is obviously a story, in which actors dress on stage for different roles. The orchestras on stage and the conductor take part in the action, which develops from the traditional B√§nkelsang of the beginning, with the conductor churning the barrel organ which accompanies the tailor's ballad, to more modern vocal and orchestral sounds. The barrel organ music is transferred to the orchestra at times. The \\"normal\\" world with its violence and stupidity is represented by dissonant clusters and crude expressionist music, while Zimmermann uses electronic sound transformation (Klangtransformation) for the sphere of the Schuhu, manipulating instrumental sounds corresponding with the orchestra and not in contrast. This provides new and unheard-of (unerh√∂rt) sounds for a more beautiful and liberated world of the future (\\"eine zuk√ºnftige sch√∂nere, befreite Welt\\"). Beginning like a fairy tale, the action moves to analogies with present-day situations and looks at the future.

Born in Java, Dutch East Indies, Khouw came from a wealthy Peranakan business family. Her father, the entrepreneur Khouw Kim Goan, founded N.V. Merbaboe, a large livestock, milk and beverage conglomerate in late colonial Indonesia; and her mother was an indigenous Indonesian woman. Her better-known brother, Khouw Khe Hien (1907-1938), also a pioneering aviator, initially envisaged air transportation for the company's products as a more efficient alternative to land and sea transportation. This grew into a full-blown obsession, which ended with Khouw's brother causing an international sensation in 1935, when he flew his Indonesian-built aeroplane, Walraven 2, in a 20-day- long journey from Bandung to Schiphol, Amsterdam, and onwards to other European destinations. Around the same time, Khouw Keng Nio also caused a sensation in the Dutch and Indonesian press by training as a pilot, qualifying in March 1936, thereby becoming both the first Indonesian and the first Chinese woman aviator. When her brother died in a plane accident in Batavia in 1938, Khouw Keng Nio took over the reins of N.V. Merbaboe. Under her tutelage, the company maintained its headquarters in Batavia, but expanded, opening branches in Bogor, Bandung and Sukabumi. Her company employed over 300 workers, and slaughtered between 75 and 80 cows daily to meet the needs of around 40,000 consumers, extending from hotels and restaurants to the colonial shipping fleet and army. Her yearly tax bill amounts to the extraordinary sum of f. 100,000.

It was announced on October 29, 2018, before being released on November 6. The launch was originally scheduled for October 30, but was rescheduled to avoid coinciding with Apple Inc.'s on October 30. The OnePlus 6T is an incremental hardware update to the prior OnePlus 6. Namely through increasing the size of the display along with the device's screen-to-body ratio (to 6.41\\" and by about 2% respectively) by slightly shrinking the bottom \\"chin\\" bezel and using a taller, 19.5:9 AMOLED panel with more heavily curved corners & significantly smaller \\"teardrop\\" shaped \\"notch\\". This is in addition to the 6T's other major changes which includes increasing the size of the battery, removing the 3.5 mm audio jack, and providing a new optical in-display fingerprint sensor. OnePlus also announced a McLaren edition of the phone in December 2018.  Specifications  As far as the 6T's physical construction goes, it has Gorilla Glass 6 on the front (new for the 6T), an aluminum mid-frame, and Gorilla Glass 5 on the rear. = Hardware = The OnePlus 6T comes with a new 6.41-inch FHD+ AMOLED display & taller 19.5:9 aspect ratio (compared to the 6's shorter 6.28-inch, 19:9 panel) and increased screen-to-body ratio (by about 2%, bringing it from almost 84% to around 86%) via the phone's slightly smaller bottom bezel (aka \\"chin\\") and the new display's more heavily curved corners & significantly smaller \\"teardrop\\" shaped \\"notch\\" (for housing the front facing RGB camera & sensors). As far as the SOC goes, the OnePlus 6T uses the same 10nm Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 octa-core processor as the prior model, though now backed up with a notably larger 3700 mAh battery (increased by 400 mAh). Also shared with the previous model is the imaging system, with the 6T using the exact same 16-megapixel and 20-megapixel camera sensors on the back and 16-megapixel sensor on the front as the 6. And depending on the specific model in question, the 6T comes with different variations of storage (128GB, 256GB) and RAM (6GB, 8GB, 10GB); with the new base model now shipping with twice the storage capacity as previously (128GB vs 64GB). For biometrics, the OnePlus 6T has a new in-display optical fingerprint sensor (replacing the rear mounted capacitive sensor found on its predecessors), in addition to Face Unlock. = Software = It ships with OnePlus's customized version of Android, OxygenOS, which is based on Android Pie, and has since been updated to Android 10. = Network compatibility = The OnePlus 6T supports 4G, LTE, Dual VoLTE, 3G, 2G and CDMA. McLaren edition OnePlus also announced a McLaren edition of the phone similar to the Oppo Find X's Lamborghini edition and the Huawei Mate 20 Pro's Porsche Design model. The device features 10 GB of RAM and a unique color scheme OnePlus calls Papaya Orange. Due to the extra RAM, the device is more expensive than the regular 6T; it is priced at $699 in the United States. This phone also debuted with a new 30W Warp Charge 30 unit that is significantly faster than the regular 20 W unit.  Guinness record  OnePlus set a Guinness World Record title of \\"the most people unboxing a phone simultaneously\\" on the launch of OnePlus 6T.  Reception  Like its predecessors, the OnePlus 6T was praised for its long battery life and performance from an efficient Android build, all while still remaining relatively affordable for a flagship device. Besides value, the 6T also offered innovations that distinguished it from other phones; the in-display fingerprint scanner was generally praised as working well for a first-time implementation albeit with an inconsistent unlock speed, while \\"teardrop\\" accommodation for the front selfie camera at the top of the display was considered more aesthetic than the notch of other phones. Adding T-Mobile USA as a carrier and distribution partner in the United States would also improve sales and support compared to OnePlus's previous online-only sales model. American technology reviewer Marques Brownlee said in his Smartphone Awards video on December 18 that the OnePlus 6T is the best phone of 2018 for its affordable price and great features that are on expensive phones. The lack of a headphone jack was criticized, as well as the removal of the notification LED, while some reviewers also noted that there is still no IP67 or IP68 protection from water and dust.

The union was founded in 1907 as the Waterproof Garment Makers' and Machinists' Trade Union. Based in Salford, it originally had 382 members, but this dropped to only 70 by 1912. As a result, the union's leaders decided to disband the union, but some members wished to continue. They appointed Joseph Fogerty of the Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers as a full-time organiser, and he was able to reverse the decline; by 1915, it had more than 500 members. In 1914, the union renamed itself as the \\"Waterproof Garment Workers' Trade Union\\". The following year, it was a founder constituent of the United Garment Workers' Trade Union, but it retained significant autonomy, and became independent once more in 1921. The Great Depression saw great unhappiness among members with the union's organisation, many members leaving as a result. The General Council of the Trades Union Congress conducted an investigation, which concluded that the union should reform its structures, and the breakaway members should return to the union. In 1936, the union was involved in a dispute at J. Meek and Co, in Manchester, and unhappiness about its handling of it led to the whole executive being replaced. This did not affect union membership, which reached a peak of 3,100 in 1947, with about three-quarters of members being women. From the 1950s, membership of the union declined in line with employment in the industry, and by 1971 it had only 714 members remaining.

History In the 1970s, while serving as a hockey, soccer, and wrestling coach as well as a history teacher at Boston College High School (BCHS), Talbot was accused of rape and other charges of sexual misconduct. In response, the Jesuits chose to move him to another high school, Cheverus High School. In 2005, at the age of 67, he was convicted of several counts of abuse during his stint at Boston College High School, and served six years in prison for the crimes. In a civil suit, 13 victims who sued the Society of Jesus and the high school received a $5.2 million settlement. At the time of his release, proceedings to laicize Talbot were still incomplete. He was removed from the clerical state in 2013. This case was one of several that are collectively known as the Catholic Archdiocese of Boston sex abuse scandal, and part of the larger Catholic Church sex abuse cases in the United States. Talbot transferred from BCHS to Cheverus in 1980, where he remained until 1998, again in the role of history teacher and wrestling coach in an all-male school. In 1998 a student brought information to the bishop that her brother had been molested by Talbot, who by that time was molesting yet another student. Talbot was released from prison for the BCHS charges in 2011, only to be charged for crimes committed at Cheverus. In 2017, Talbot was extradited to Maine, and in 2018 at age 80, was sentenced to two concurrent 3 year sentences after pleading guilty to both gross sexual assault and unlawful sexual contact. These charges both centered around the raping a nine year old boy at a church in Freeport, Maine. Between prison stays, Talbot resided at Vianney Renewal Center, a Catholic faith based treatment center in Missouri run by the Congregation of the Servants of the Paraclete to aid priests and brothers with personal difficulties. He immediately began serving his 2018 sentence following his guilty plea. Talbot admitted to abusing \\"88 or 89\\" students altogether. One case is depicted in the movie Spotlight, which starred Michael Keaton in the role of Boston Globe editor Walter V. Robinson, who attended BCHS and who broke the story of the Catholic Archdiocese of Boston sex abuse scandal in 2002.

Much of the earlier writings from within the Islamic world presented Ibadism as a heresy. Western academic interest in Ibadism began in the mid-19th century, when translations of Ibadi texts and other literature began to become available. French and Italian scholars focussed mainly on Ibadism in North Africa, while John C. Wilkinson and other British scholars have studied it in Oman, where few texts were accessible until the 1970s. Studies of Ibadism have adopted different perspectives. Some have been theologically based, locating Ibadi teachings among the different branches of Islam. Some have studied the origins of Ibadism in the context of early Islamic history. And some have set it in the context of Islamic jurisprudence. Regular conferences and publications since 2009 have helped bring Ibadism to wider attention.  History of research  During the stage of the systematisation of Oriental Studies starting in the 19th century, Ibadism became marginalised. Furthermore, Ibadism suffered from being misunderstood by other Islamic schools. Early Islamic heresiographical works, due to their nature, considered Ibadism to be one of the extremist divisions of the Kharijite (Khawarije) movement. These approaches influenced both Muslim and non-Muslim researchers who tried to understand Ibadism, because several researchers considered heresiographic literature as the main source for understanding Islam. Due to the reproduction of stereotypical ideas about Ibadism, it became difficult to distinguish between actual IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ doctrine and the superstructure of opinion and especially to see Ibadism and IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´s independent of the Kharijites.  Orientalism and Ibadism  The middle of the nineteenth century witnessed the expansion of European colonization in the Near East, which produced explorers‚Äô accounts of the places they visited. During this period, travellers‚Äô reports, politician‚Äôs writings and scholars‚Äô works on geography, politics and social life spread and proliferated. The general historical framework of the literature on IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ history was expanded and enriched. Works of French and Italian scholars focused mainly on North Africa, where the IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ communities spread over scattered locations in the Sahara. The French Orientalists had a keener interest in Algeria and Tunisia, while the Italians focused their attention on Libya. In contrast, the scholars who focused on Oman were mostly British or American.Al Salimi, Abdulrahman (2014). \\"Ibadi Studies and Orientalism\\". In Ziaka, Angeliki. On Ibadism. Germany: Georg Olms Verlag AG. p. 26\\\\. . This is of particular interest to those who apply Edward Said‚Äôs thesis on the relation between power and knowledge in post-Orientalism. For example, the French and Italian Orientalists were Enrico Insabato, Andr√© N√®gre and Pessah Shinar. Additionally, the scholars who devoted some works to East Africa were from a variety of European countries for example: the French, A. Imbert (1903) and Gabriel Ferrand (1928), the German Albert Friedemann (1930), the British, W. Ingrams (1967) and the American, Michael Lofchie(1965). As far as Oman is concerned, most of the scholars were British, starting with S. B. Miles (1871) up to John Kelly (1956, 1964, 1968). Certainly, the highest level of scholarship was reached by John Wilkinson, who continues his academic work to this day. Modern historians hold that Wilkinson‚Äôs writings on the religious, social and political structures of the Sultanate of Oman are the most important in this field. Russian Orientalists have also shown interest in IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ studies, beginning with V. R. Rosen. In more recent years, the Ukrainian Daniil Radivilov left his imprint on the field.  Orientalist works on the history of IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ society  The works of Theodor Noeldeke and Goldzieher gained pre-eminence in the field of Islamic history. Both focused their studies on the emergence of Islam and early Islamic history. Despite these developments, IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ studies attracted very little attention. Another reason that may, to a certain degree, be held responsible for the marginalization of Ibadism, was the fact that most IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ manuscripts were kept in remote IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ settlements and towns far away from the coastal areas and capitals, especially in North Africa. This relative isolation has led us to a few observations on the development of IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ studies in western Orientalism. The two primary approaches to IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´s that dominated Western Oriental studies appeared in the mid-19th century. The first consisted in an attempt to understand Ibadism through the translated texts, whilst the second involved the compilation of bibliographic lists of IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ literature, most of which focused on historical works. Scholars interested in Omani sources were mostly from Great Britain. This is apparent from George Badger‚Äôs The Imams and Seyyid in Oman, the translation of the K. al-Fath al-Mubiyn fƒ´ sƒ´rat al-Sadah al-Bus‚Äôƒ´diyƒ´n by Ibn Ruzayq, published in 1871. In 1874, Charles Edward Ross published Annals of Oman from early times to the year 1728, and the translation of excerpts from the K. Kashf al-Ghuma by al-Sarhanƒ´. Translations of North African IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ literature started in 1878 by the French Orientalist, Emile Masqueray, who translated part of the K. al-Siyar wa AkhbƒÅr al-Immah by Ab≈´ ZakariyƒÅ Yahƒ´ya b. Abƒ´ Bakr al-WarjƒÅlanƒ´, which was followed by studies on the IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ of M'zab. In 1885, A. Motylinski (1854‚Äì1907) translated parts of the ‚ÄúK. al-JawƒÅhir al- MuntaqƒÅh‚Äù by Ab≈´ al QƒÅsim al-BarrƒÅdƒ´. Al-BarrƒÅdƒ´‚Äôs work presented a different view of early Islamic history after the battle of Siffƒ´n and the development of Ibadism in North Africa. Certainly, Motylinski‚Äôs broad interests have promoted North African studies in the European academic disciplines of linguistics, history and theology.Al Salimi, Abdulrahman (2014). \\"Ibadi Studies and Orientalism\\". In Ziaka, Angeliki. On Ibadism. Germany: Georg Olms Verlag AG. p. 25\\\\. . In addition, several publications by the Italian orientalist Roberto Rubinacci are remarkable contributions to the study of IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ theology and religious history. Within the circle of French Orientalists, the Polish Orientalist Tadeusz Lewicki accomplished distinguished achievements. His studies started with the translation and commentary on some parts of the ‚ÄúK. al-Siyar‚Äù by Ahmad b. Sa‚Äòƒ´d al-ShammƒÅkhƒ´ in 1934. Furthermore, in 1935, Lewicki translated the ‚ÄúK. al-TabqƒÅt‚Äù by al- Darjƒ´nƒ´ and his comments on IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ historical sources from North Africa are unique and uniquely important in the field. Lewicki must be considered as the most eminent expert on Ibadism in the mid- 20th century. In the field of bibliography, A. Motylinski produced the first list in 1885, containing the manuscripts of the Wadi Mzab in Algeria, after he had the chance to visit some private IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ libraries. Later on, Motylinski, having verified the authenticity of the work, introduced the ‚ÄúTƒÅrikh‚Äù of Ibn al-Saghir and produced a short monograph on the Rustumid state. Next, Z. Smogorzewski (1919) published a list of IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ works in Oman and North Africa, which were also mentioned by both Strothmann (1927), and Rubinacci (1952). Finally, there was the famous article by German-English Orientalist Joseph Schacht in 1956 after his visit to Wadi Mzab, which provided further impetus to the publication of philological works in IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ libraries. Schacht had a different perspective. Rather than focusing on historical works, he outlined the importance of IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ jurisprudence and theological works, in addition to conducting research in the early formation of Islam. Significantly, after Schacht‚Äôs visit, some German scholars followed in his footsteps. The first step in this direction was taken by Hans Schluter in 1972 and 1975, then Josef van Ess (1975) and, finally, the Libyan IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ scholar ‚ÄòAmr al-Nami (1971). Many works continued to be published drawing on the libraries of North Africa. The geographical and political isolation of Oman at the beginning of the 20th century deprived scholars of access to Omani works and early IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ writings. The exploration of Omani literature started only in the mid-1970s, when John Wilkinson and G. Rex Smith published a number of writings on Ibadism in Oman.  20th-century IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ studies  At the beginning of the 20th century, the development of interdisciplinary, historical and philological studies promoted the study of Islamic theology and jurisprudence.Al Salimi, Abdulrahman (2014). \\"Ibadi Studies and Orientalism\\". In Ziaka, Angeliki. On Ibadism. Germany: Georg Olms Verlag AG. p. 27\\\\. . The comparisons between different Islamic groups led researchers to write books and articles on heresiography and the history of Islamic theology. In 1902, the German Orientalist, Wellhausen, published his work on the religio-political groups in Islam, concentrating on the Kharijites and Shiites. This remarkable change of paradigm in the study of Ibadism and its history was introduced by the Italian researcher Laura Veccia Vaglieri. A number of her papers deal specifically with Ibadism. However, the most significant study was by the Italian Orientalist, Nallino (1916), who tried to understand the doctrinal affinities between Ibadism and the Mutaziltes. Indeed, Nallino, understood the Mu‚Äòtaziltes to be Islamic rationalists; however, Nallino was able to alter the way in which Oriental scholars‚Äô related Islamic theology with classical philosophy. This, in turn, influenced the historical-political perspective on Ibadism, leading to a deeper study of IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ theology. Nallino was followed by his student, the Italian scholar Roberto Rubinacci, who continued Nallino‚Äôs efforts and studied IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ doctrinal texts (creeds and epistles) which were published between 1949 and 1989. During the 1960s, the British scholar Watt Montgomery published several papers on Islamic theological history which treat of WƒÅsil b. Atta‚Äô and the Kharijites, and of the Kharijites and their rebellions during Umayyad and Abbasid times. Unfortunately, he was unable to complete his studies. Perhaps this was due to the limited availability of materials for his research. In the 1980s ‚Äì 90s, the French scholar, Pierre Cuperly, published remarkable works focusing on the methodology for studying the early IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ theological epistles. Cuperly‚Äôs main work provides an introduction to IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ Theology. He selected three creeds from early IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ epistles and tried to explore the development of IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ beliefs up to the 6th/12th century. Overall, German Scholars Wilferd Madelung and Josef van Ess reached the pinnacle of achievement in expounding IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ Theology, as they are the primary modern contributors to fostering the understanding of Islamic theology. They re-examined classical Islamic theological history and induced other scholars to explore how early Islamic theology emerged. Their numerous publications have opened a new dimension in the study of Islamic theology. Their knowledge of various Islamic theological groups has made them the foremost Orientalists in the study of classical Islamic theological history. Their contribution had an immediate impact on modern scholars, and, since the 1980s, scholars have conducted extensive research on IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ theology and jurisprudence inspired by their work. They proved that the study of the emergence and formation of Islam has been reflected significantly in the IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ literature which, as a consequence, has become a premier source for this field of study of Islam was inaugurated by John Wansbrough, Michael Cook, Martin Hinds, Patricia Crone, Gerald Hawting, and Andrew Rippin.Al Salimi, Abdulrahman (2014). \\"Ibadi Studies and Orientalism\\". In Ziaka, Angeliki. On Ibadism. Germany: Georg Olms Verlag AG. p. 28\\\\. . In contrast, the branch of Oriental studies dealing with IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ jurisprudence is rather fragmented in its approach to the history and background of IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ jurisprudence. Thus, it is difficult to make a comprehensive survey of its contribution. We cannot deny that this was because of the limited availability of IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ works in print. Moreover, this deficiency might have been caused by the fact that, in the first half of 20th century, most Orientalists concentrated on classical Islamic philosophy and theology. To illustrate the contribution of the Orientalists, we should begin with the early articles published by E. Sachau in 1894, e.g., his paper on Abu al-Hasan al-Bisiyawi. Later, Sachau published a paper on IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´s on the eastern coast of Africa. Schacht‚Äôs theories on ‚ÄúThe origin of Muhammadian jurisprudence‚Äù have greatly influenced the study of Islamic jurisprudence and have induced researchers to examine his views. Undoubtedly, Schacht had a great impact on the reconstruction of the development of Islamic jurisprudence after Ignaz Goldziher‚Äôs work ‚ÄúIntroduction to Islamic Theology and Law‚Äù. Since 1987, the finest work on Ibadi jurisprudence has been produced by Ersilia Francesca in the form of both books and articles. Later on, works by American researchers with an anthropological background on Oman‚Äôs politics and economy began to appear in 1967 with Robert Landen and in 1978 with John Peterson, who is known for his extensive writings on the modern history and politics of Oman. Since 1980, Dale Eickelman has published many texts about Oman. In his anthropological writings, he compares Oman with different areas of the Muslim world. His work triggered the emergence of a new generation of American researchers in the field of Oman and IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ Studies, such as Valerie Hoffman, Mandana Limbert and Adam Gaiser. New developments in the field of IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ studies were connected with ‚Äì and also a result of ‚Äì the publication of IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ books from Algeria, Oman, Egypt, Zanzibar, etc., since the end of the 19th century. These developments changed many previous concepts and introduced the notion of intellectual reformation process in the scholarship on Ibadism and the contributions of the scholars of Ibadism, such as, Nur al-Din Al-Salmi, and Muhammad ibn Yusuf Atfayyash, the author of ‚ÄúSharh al Nail‚Äù, and Sulayman al- Baruni, all of whom advanced the field of IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ studies in recent years. Within this context, the study of Ibadism entered a stage of greater profundity and sophistication, thus becoming a more attractive subject of study to researchers and specialists. The critical text editions by Abulrahman al-Salimi and Wilferd Madelung, as well as a recent annotated translation of two theological primers by IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ theologians of the late thirteenth and the early nineteenth century respectively, namely the  øAqƒ´da al-wahbiyya by NƒÅ·π£ir b. SƒÅlim b.  øUdayyam al-Rawahƒ´ and the KitƒÅb Ma øƒÅlim al-dƒ´n by  øAbd al- øAzƒ´z al-Thamƒ´mƒ´ (d. 1223/1808), with an introduction to the history of IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ doctrinal thought (Valerie Hoffman 2012) hold exceptional and unique interest for the history of IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ theology. Given the growing interest of international scholars in IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ studies, IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ theology will certainly play a prominent role in future scholarship. Conferences regularly held since 2009 on Ibadism are a major fact in this direction, attracting a number of experts in this field. On November 9‚Äì10, 2009, the first international conference in Europe on Ibadism (al-Ibadiyya), entitled ‚ÄúIbadism, IbƒÅ·∏çƒ´ Studies, and the Sultanate of Oman,‚Äù was held at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in Greece. Since then, eight international conferences have been dedicated to Ibadism and all proceedings were published in the Series entitled Studies on Ibadism and Oman.

It was started in 1913 by Alfred Chester Beatty, a mining engineer from the United States. After the end of the First World War, Beatty built up a substantial portfolio of mining interests, many of them in Africa, but others in Serbia and in Siberia. Initially the company began operations by sharing an office at Number One London Wall in the City of London with the consulting firm of Herbert Hoover, a fellow American mining engineer. The company was chiefly known for its investments in mining for base metals, diamonds and oil. The countries in which it operated included the US, Canada, Mexico, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Chile, Brazil, Peru, Burma, Australia, South Africa, Angola, Tanzania, Northern Rhodesia, Sierra Leone, Gold Coast, French Guinea, Botswana, Hungary, Russia, Yugoslavia and the USSR. It was pioneer in the early days of the North Sea oil and gasfields. Structure Mining finance houses were principally holding companies that create subsidiaries in which they either partly or wholly owned the capital of the mining companies in the group, but mostly maintained control. Many of these subsidiaries were listed on the same as the master company or on other stock exchanges. In the case of Selection Trust, many of these entities were clearly group companies due to their naming. Examples of this were Consolidated African Selection Trust, Rhodesian Selection Trust, Gold Coast Selection Trust and Sierra Leone Selection Trust. Rhodesian Selection Trust One of the key early building blocks of the mining finance house was its interests in the copper belt of Central Africa. The Rhodesian Selection Trust Limited (RST) was a copper mining corporation which operated in the Copperbelt region of Northern Rhodesia. In 1926, RST took over the Roan Antelope and Rietbok claims from the Bwana Mkubwa Company and the Rhodesia Copper and General Exploration and Finance Company, with the RST dominating the company shareholdings. Rhodesian Selection Trust was formed in 1928. The company was renamed Roan Selection Trust in 1964 after the break- up of the Central African Federation and the independence of Northern Rhodesia as the new state of Zambia. Other Ventures One of the company's least successful ventures was a partnership with Calouste Gulbenkian in which the new Leninist regime of the Soviet Union awarded the Lena Goldfields and the Tetiuhe Mining Company to the partners. Faction fighting with the USSR ultimately made operations impossible. A more successful between-the-wars venture was the development of the Trepƒça Mines in Yugoslavia (now Kosovo). In 1925 an exploration program was launched to assess the potential of the Lead- Zinc deposit at the location. The 50-year concession was obtained in 1926 by Selection Trust from Rade Pa≈°iƒá, son of Nikola Pa≈°iƒá, the sometime Yugoslav prime minister. On 9 September 1927 Selection Trust launched its Trepƒça Mines Limited subsidiary in London. Mining operations began in 1930 with pilot production of sulphide Lead and Zinc mineralisations. The mine was appropriated by the Germans upon their invasion of Yugoslavia and Trepƒça at one point was supplying 40% of all the Lead required for the German war effort. With decolonialisation in Africa advancing rapidly in the 1950s and 1960s, the company increased its presence in Australia. One of its major successes was its involvement in the early phases of the country's iron ore expansion through the Mt Newman discovery. The company became even more prominent from the late 1960s for its involvement in the Nickel Boom. Rising world nickel prices and a prolonged strike at an Inco's Creighton Mine nickel mine at Sudbury in Canada, meant that the discoveries were rapidly developed, bringing about a frenzied market in nickel explorers and developers between 1967 and 1971. The boom was triggered by the discovery of significant nickel resources in Kambalda, Western Australia in 1966, Mount Windarra in 1969 and Agnew (by Selection Trust and its satellite, Consolidated African Selection Trust) in 1971. It was noticeable that Agnew was initially largely in the hands of London investors and that the sole Australian connection was an indirect 2.4% stake in the project held by Selcast Exploration, a locally listed satellite of Selection Trust. This imbalance was partly remedied by Mount Isa Mines buying into the control group of the project. Succession & Acquisition by BP In 1950 Chester Beatty handed control of Selection Trust over to his son, also named Alfred Chester Beatty, who ran it until 1968 . It was acquired by BP in August 1980, and named successively, BP Minerals International Ltd and BP Minerals Development Ltd. The acquisition by BP was the largest takeover in the history of the London Stock Exchange at the time. Most of BP's minerals assets were sold to the British mining company Rio Tinto Zinc for ¬£2.38 billion in 1989.

He was a member of the Communist Party Historians Group as well as an editor of the 1940s communist cultural magazine Our Time.  Life  Hobday was born in Eastbourne, East Sussex in 1917. His father was a soldier, and died six months before he was born. After attending the local grammar school, Hobday received a scholarship to the Queen Mary University of London, where he took a first- class degree in history and English. During his studies he became aware of the immense poverty in the city, and joined the Communist Party in 1938. Hobday spent the Second World War obtaining a master's degree in Cambridge, and did not serve in the military on medical grounds. At this point, his first poems were published in Our Time, a communist literary journal. The journal was edited by Edgell Rickword, who Hobday would later go on to write a biography about in 1989. After Our Time folded in 1949, Hobday moved to Bristol to work for Keesing's Contemporary Archive. In 1950, he married Inez Gwendolen Beeching. Over the course of the next decade, he became involved in a campaign to democratise the Communist Party, but left in 1957 after the Soviet invasion of Hungary. From the 1960s onward Hobday became more engaged in writing poetry, and less involved in the communist politics of his youth. In 1972, Inez Gwendolen Beeching died. Hobday married Helen Strauss, his second and last wife, in 1983. In retirement Hobday wrote many of his most remembered works, including the biography Edgell Rickword (1989); a survey of English poets in Florence, A golden ring (1997); and Elegy for a sergeant (2002), a poem in memory of his uncle who died in the First World War. In 1979, Hobday published the classic essay, \\"Clouted Soon and Leather Aprons: Shakespear and the Egalitarian Tradition.\\" While he left the communist party in the 1950s, Hobday remained a socialist and became a member of the Labour Party. However, after the Labour party supported the invasion of Iraq, Hobday left this party too. Charles Hobday died in 2005, aged 87.

Built in 1871 for attorney, author, and poet Benjamin Homer Hall who served as City Clerk of Troy, it is located at 216 River Street on the corner with First Street. It has been attributed to the firm of Vaux and Withers, the partnership between Calvert Vaux and Frederick Clarke Withers after the death in a steamboat accident of Andrew Jackson Downing. More recent scholarship by a professor suggests George B. Post was the building's architect. It is part of the Central Troy Historic District. Originally 6 stories with 3 towers on the roof, a fire damaged the top floor and it was removed along with the towers. In more recent decades, the building fell into disrepair after it was foreclosed on in the 1980s. An effort to save it was launched and it was restored in the 1990s. A nonprofit entity called Rice Building Incorporated was created to turn it into a business incubator center. With support from State Senator Joseph Bruno, New York State provided $2 million for the project. The architecture firm Lepera & Ward headed the project. Ganem Contracting was also involved in the project and photographed the work and many architectural details. The origins of the name Rice Building are not known. Benjamin Homer Hall The building was originally known as the Hall Building for attorney and poet Benjamin Homer Hall (November 14, 1830 - April 6,1893) who had it built. Hall was educated at Harvard University and served as City Clerk of Troy. The building may have been an inspiration for New York City's Flatiron Building. Hall wrote A Collection of College Works and Customs (ca. 1850), History of Eastern Vermont, from its Earliest Settlement to the Close of the Eighteenth Century (1858), and Bibliography of the Unites States (1860). He married Margaret McCoun Lane, the daughter of Jacob L. Lane of Troy. A collection of his and his father Daniel Hall's papers include correspondence with Amos Eaton, ( geologist and founder of Rensselaer Institute), Edward Everett, William H. Seward, Hamilton Fish, Robert Todd Lincoln, Horatio Seymour, William L. Marcy, John E. Wool, and Asa Fitch. Fire The upper floor and roof towers were damaged by a fire in 1913 1916, or 1920 (when a fire struck River Street), depending on the source. Other info The building was constructed on the site of Lane's Row and replaced structures on that site Edgar Holloway made an etching of the building in 1974. The building appears in the Martin Scorsese film, based on Edith Wharton's 1920 novel, \\"The Age of Innocence (1993 film)\\" as a law office in New York City. The building was sold in 2016 for $800,000 to Tai Ventures. Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute was involved in saving and restoring the building.content://media/external/file/348569 The building features pointed-arch polychrome voussoirs.

It was built from 1822 to 1908. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  =Picton= The town of Picton was named by Major Antill after Sir Thomas Picton in 1841. The location was previously known as \\"Stonequarry\\". The Duke of Wellington described Picton as a \\"rough foul-mouthed devil as ever lived\\" but very capable. He was \\"respected for his courage and feared for his irrascible temperament\\". He was chiefly remembered for his exploits under Wellington in the Iberinan Peninsular War displaying great barvery and persistence. He was killed at the Battle of Waterloo and was the most senior officer to die there. He was buried in the family vault at St. George's, Hanover Square in London. In 1859 Picton was re-interred in St. Paul's Cathedral, London, lying close to the body of the Duke of Wellington.Wheeldon, 2015, 3 =Abbotsford= The property was taken up in 1822 by George Harper, natural history collector, settler, noted Scottish government official and surveyor. The main block of the house may have been built before Harper made his trip to England in 1827. The ornamental plantings include relatively rare species of horticultural interest and are thought to have been planted by George Harper. The rest of the house was built before his death at Abbotsford in 1841. Purchased by William Redfern Antill, local Magistrate and prominent early settler in 1865. Abbotsford House was built . The original access road to Abbotsford House extended in a straight line from the Abbotsford crossing of Race Course Creek. The timber truss Abbotsford Bridge was built . It was handed over to the Wollondilly Shire Council by the NSW Public Works Department. New works in commenced in 1985 and the original bridge was demolished in 1986.It was replaced with present concrete road bridge . The property remained with the Antill family until 1952. The house was considered to be a remarkable survival of a farmhouse from an early period of Australia's settlement. In the late 1970s it was reported as being virtually unchanged since the middle years of the last century except for the loss of the original ceilings. Neglect, and two separate fires over the following decade, led to its state of dereliction.

Timber bridge replaced with present concrete road bridge . The location of the earlier Abbotsford bridge and crossing is significant because knowledge of its position contributes to the understanding of the siting of Abbotsford House and its driveway avenue plantings in relation to the Oaks Rd and Abbotsford Road.Heritage Study, 1992 Grounds / Garden The mature trees and remnants of the gardens and grounds of the Abbotsford property have scientific significance as a collection of rare species of horticultural interest and their association with George Harper who was a noted natural history collector. Together with the other components of the Abbotsford group, the plantings provide evidence of the structure and layout of the farm estate. In a wider context, the surviving plantings also illustrate the horticultural practice of plant collecting which was to remain an important influence in the development of gardens of the colony for a substantial period of time. Today, the trees are a landmark and contribute to the character of the rural landscape north-west of Picton. The listing includes all trees and buildings on the land from road to hill top.AHC, 1980 Buildings =House (now ruins) (WO0108)= A colonial Georgian brick house with front verandah, the main block being flanked by slightly later ones which at the rear form a U-shaped verandah court with the centre block. The whole is raised on a terrace at the front which is unusual. The main block is double pile plan and the elevation is five bays wide under a hip roof of shingles covered with corrugated galvanised iron. Internal detailing is intact. Originally a Colonial Georgian, one storey house flanked by later gabled pavilions forming a U-shaped verandahed courtyard with the whole raised on a high terrace at the front. Face brick on rubble foundation for main block. Two brick outbuildings are associated with house; one containing a kitchen and servants' quarters, the other a smokehouse. Twice destroyed by fire in last decade and main building now derelict. The ruins of the main Abbotsford farmhouse are significant for their associations with the settlement of the area and the links with the Harper and Antill families. The architectural value and intactness of the house as an early homestead has been lost. The ruins, together with the other components of the property, provide an opportunity to interpret an early pastoral property through archaeological investigation. The ruins are also an evocative part of the Abbotsford group which is a landmark in the rural surrounds of Picton. =Cottage & Brick Outhouse (WO0111)= The cottage was used as servants' quarters and the brick outhouse as a smokehouse. These domestic buildings are thought to date to the mid 19th century. = Timber barns = = Convict Barracks/Old Gaol (demolished) = Together with the main residence these two buildings and the gaol (now demolished) were positioned around a central court with a deliberate axial relationship to the hill, the driveway and selected trees. =Underground Water Storage Tank (WO110)= A large brick tank about in diameter. It is internally rendered, capped with a brick dome and still holds water. Archaeological and other elements As well as the water storage tank there are other sites considered to be of archaeological interest. They are the site of the \\"Old Gaol\\" or Convict Barracks, a line of stones adjacent to the existing timber barns and the remains of a floor surface (LEP). The ruins, together with the other components of the property, provide an opportunity to interpret an early pastoral property through archaeological investigation. The ruins are also an evocative part of the Abbotsford group which is a landmark in the rural surrounds of Picton. = Condition = As at 27 March 2012, a large brick tank about in diameter. It is internally rendered, capped with a brick dome and still holds water. As well as the underground water storage tank there are other sites considered to be of archaeological interest. They are the site of the \\"Old Gaol\\" or Convict Barracks, a line of stones adjacent to the existing timber barns and the remains of a floor surface. = Modifications and dates = *1985Original access road to Abbotsford House extended in a staight line from the Abbotsford crossing of Race Course Creek. 1985 new works in commenced in 1985; *1986the 1908 l timber trestle bridge was demolished - Site of original bridge over Racecourse Creek, at site of Abbotsford crossing.  Heritage listing  As at 27 March 2012, the Abbotsford property is significant because of its associations with the early settlement of the Picton area and its links with prominent colonial figure, George Harper and later, the Antill family. In addition to its historical significance the site has the potential to yield further evidence of the working of this important pastoral estate through archaeological investigation. The Abbotsford cottage and brick outbuilding are significant for their contribution to the understanding of the function and layout of the group as a whole. The ruins of the main farmhouse are significant for their associations with the settlement of the area and the links with the Harper and Antill families. The architectural value and intactness of the house as an early homestead has been lost. The ruins, together with the other components of the property, provide an opportunity to interpret an early pastoral property through archaeological investigation. The ruins are also an evocative part of the Abbotsford group which is a landmark in the rural surrounds of Picton. The mature trees and remnants of the gardens and grounds of the Abbotsford property have scientific significance as a collection of rare species of horticultural interest and their association with George Harper who was a noted natural history collector. Together with the other components of the Abbotsford group, the plantings provide evidence of the structure and layout of the farm estate. In a wider context, the surviving plantings also illustrate the horticultural practice of plant collecting which was to remain an important influence in the development of gardens of the colony for a substantial period of time. Today, the trees are a landmark and contribute to the character of the rural landscape north-west of Picton. The mid-19th century cottage and brick outbuilding are significant from their contribution to the understanding of the function and layout of the homestead group.LEP, 1991 The underground water tank at Abbotsford is significant through its contribution to our understanding of the group as a whole. It is considered to be a potential source for archaeological research into the occupation phases of the site as domestic artefacts are often dropped into wells. Other sites are also considered to have archaeological significance, particularly into the earliest phases of the development of the property and the role of convicts. The location of the earlier Abbotsford bridge and crossing is significant because knowledge of its position contributes to the understanding of the siting of Abbotsford House and its driveway avenue plantings in relation to the Oaks Rd and Abbotsford Road. Abbotsford was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

During the expedition, there was an attempt on climbing Big Ben to investigate glaciology, geology and volcanology of the unexplored area. Due to a prolonged blizzard and a lost food depot, the attempt was abandoned. One of the three members (Grahame Budd) had frostbitten hands but all survived. The three had lost their tent, sleeping bags and other equipment. Back in Australia, Deacock drove around the country with his family working odd jobs. He decided to have another attempt at climbing Big Ben and in 1964 started fundraising for the attempt. In 8 months he raised nearly ¬£86,000.

The union was founded in 1894 when the Bristol Clothiers' Cutters' Trade Association merged with the Leeds Wholesale Clothiers' Operatives' Union, and it was originally known as the Amalgamated Union of Wholesale Clothing Operatives. The leading founders were Arthur Evans, William N. Pitts and Joseph Young, and they hoped to create a national industrial union. The union established its office in Leeds, and by the end of 1894 had also absorbed small unions based in Glossop, Hebden Bridge, Manchester, Nantwich and Wigan. Membership was only 506, but in 1895 Pitts moved to become treasurer, with Young becoming general secretary, and the union began a steady growth, membership reaching 1,400 in 1900, and 3,337 in 1910. It continued to rise rapidly, and by the start of World War I its membership was nearly equal to that of the Amalgamated Society of Tailors and Tailoresses (AST&T;), the leading union in the industry. It proposed a merger, but the AST&T; rejected this, fearing it would be dominated by the more radical AUCO. In 1915, the union instead completed a merger with the Amalgamated Jewish Tailors', Machinists' and Pressers' Trade Union, the London and Provincial Clothiers' Cutters' Trade Union, the London Jewish Tailors Union, the London Society of Tailors and Tailoresses and the Waterproof Garment Workers' Trade Union, forming the United Garment Workers' Trade Union.

Her academic work as a student, professor, and researcher on organisms and their respective environments prepared her for the position, in which she is responsible for protecting the Earth and other planets in the solar system from traveling microbes. Originally, Pratt did not see a place for herself in science, but with encouragement from her academic mentors and family members along the way, she has been able to accomplish much work as a scientist.  Early life and education Lisa Pratt was born and raised in Rochester, Minnesota. At her high school in Minnesota, Pratt took a lot of science courses up until her senior year. However, when she began college, she was determined not to pursue a degree in science because she felt women were not welcome in the field. Her father had been a surgeon at the Mayo Clinic, and she noted that none of his peers were female-identifying. Pratt first began her undergraduate education at Rollins College studying Spanish. However, she later transferred to University of North Carolina, where she began studying botany. Pratt received her Bachelor's of Arts in botany from the University of North Carolina in 1972. In 1974 she received her Masters of Science from the University of Illinois in Botany. Pratt later entered the field of geology by earning her Masters of Science from the University of North Carolina in 1978 and her Doctorate Degree from Princeton University in 1982.  Academic career  After receiving her PhD in 1982, Pratt held a post-doctoral fellowship for two years at the U.S. Geological Survey in Denver and stayed on for an additional five years as a Research Geologist in the U.S.G.S. Branch of Petroleum Geology before leaving Colorado for a junior professorship in biogeochemistry at Indiana University in 1987 to help train young scientists for careers in the petroleum exploration and extraction industry. She currently serves as a Provost Professor Emeritus of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences for Indiana University Bloomington where she has been a faculty member since 1987. Since joining Indiana University's faculty, Pratt has focused her research on how extreme environments effect the microorganisms within them.  Projects  When Pratt was a doctoral student, her work focused on the periods of time when Earth's oceans were starved for oxygen, which led to oceanic anoxic events that led to the creation of black sediment deposits. In doing so, she looked at the geological record of planet Earth to better understand what had taken place millions of years ago. Later, as Pratt was completing her post- doctoral work at the U.S. Geological Survey in Denver, she was brought on for a project in which she studied microorganisms in the extreme heat of active African gold mines. This was significant as it led to NASA looking to bring Pratt in to help study the microorganisms effected on their future projects. This project led to NASA funding one of her projects In 2011, in which she received a $2.4 million grant from NASA‚Äôs Astrobiology Science and Technology for Exploring Planets program to study microorganisms on the Greenland Ice Sheet.  NASA  While Pratt has been a faculty member for Indiana University at Bloomington since 1987, she has a history of working with NASA since the early 2000s. She served as a team director at the NASA Astrobiology Institute from 2003 to 2008. Pratt also served as a chair for NASA's Mars Exploration Program Analysis from 2013 to 2016, and currently serves as a chair for the Return Sample Science Board for the Mars 2020 Rover mission. In June of 2017, the application for the position of Planetary Protection Officer was posted, but Pratt was hesitant to apply. She says that encouragement from her daughter led to her submitting her name, and on February 5th 2018, Pratt was also brought on to serve as the Planetary Protection Officer for NASA, leaving her role as Indiana University's College of Arts and Sciences dean to do so. She was one out of a rumored 1,400 applicants who very vying for the position to actually attain it. She holds two responsibilities at NASA: first, protecting the Earth in event of extraterrestrial involvement, and second, ensuring that Earth's microbes do not travel and impact other planets in the solar system. Her research at NASA focuses on the developing the tools and techniques needed to avoid organic-constituent and biological contamination during either human or robotic missions. Additionally, Pratt is responsible for updating planetary policies in response to changing federal legislation.

This grandson was a pastor in the Dutch Reformed Church and founder of Paul Roos Gymnasium. His school education was in the Netherlands as his father sent him there for a Christian education. He obtained a PhD in law in 1791 at Leiden University. Career in law He practised as an advocate. Neethling was a Judge, firstly of the Court of Justice in 1825. Richard Plasket, the Cape Colonial Secretary in 1825, was not satisfied with the existing Court. A commission of inquiry were set up, which was led by J. T. Bigge and W. M. G. Colebrooke. They suggested a new court system. A Supreme Court was established out of the commission‚Äôs recommendations in January 1828. As they were looking for academically well qualified judges, Neethling, who had a PhD in law, was appointed as one of the Supreme Court judges. Other activities Apart from practising law, he was joined by D. G. Reitz and C. J. Brand in founding a newspaper, De Zuid-Afrikaan.

It was designed by William Weaver, architect-engineer, and built from 1815 to 1864. It is also known as Wilton. The property is owned by the Wollondilly Shire Council. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Jarvisfield was home of the Antill family from ‚Äì 1937 (at least). Major H. C. (Henry Colden) Antill was born in New York in 1779, second son of John and Margaret Antill. John was a Major of the Second Battalion of the New Jersey Volunteers (Loyalists). Margaret was granddaughter of Cadwallader Colden. Henry enlisted with the British Army as ensign in 1796, served with the 73rd Regiment, was promoted to Captain in 1809 and received a medal for bravery following the storming of Seringaptam in India, where he was badly wounded. Along with Governor and Mrs Macquarie he arrived in Sydney on HMS Dromedary in December 1809 with his regiment, and was appointed Aide-de- Camp to Macquarie on 1 January 1810. Antill retired from the Army in 1821 and in 1822 was the first to receive a grant of in the area now known as Picton (previously known as Stonequarry), over the brow of Razorback mountain. Antill named a nearby hill Mount Nebo and built the first slab homestead on this site in the 1810s. He later built a larger family house, , naming it Wilton for his father's estate in the American colonies, but later changing the name to Jarvisfield, to honour Governor Macquarie's first wife's maiden name, Jarvis. Antill had known Jane Jarvis in India, and was both friend of and Aide-de-Camp to Governor Macquarie. The name Jarvis Field was taken from a property owned by Macquarie on the Isle of Mull in Scotland. From 1831 to 1833 Antill was a director of the Bank of New South Wales and later became Police Magistrate for the County of Camden from 2 October 1829 until his death in 1852. Major Antill renamed the town of Stonequarry as Picton after General Sir Thomas Picton, a hero of The Battle of Waterloo. Antill retired on half pay and settled on his grant, tending sheep, pigs and cows. He was the squire of the Picton district, a magistrate, pillar of the local church (St. Mark's Anglican, Picton), supporter of the local school. Antill died in 1852, and was buried in the family vault on a hill north of and overlooking the town of Picton.Maguire, 1984, 47-48 The Brookside Restaurant (former Razorback Inn), is now at 1580 Hume Highway Deviation and separately LEP-listed.LEP, 2011 Built on four acres sold by Antill to Oliver Whiting, ex-convict and servant of the Antill family. It appears that the inn was completed in 1850 and a licence issued for that date. Continued to operate until Whitings moved to an inn at Picton when the railway opened. A Mr. Turner who later lived in the building found two English pennies dated 1850 under the foundations of the place when renovating it. Later used as a guest-house and residence named Brookside, also as a restaurant. It is now used in association with the Woolshed complex for functions. Architect and engineer William Weaver (1828‚Äì68) designed (the current house) Jarvisfield for Antill. It was built in 1863. Plans for the house (and of Burrundulla, Mudgee for the Cox family) still exist, and are clear examples of Weaver's capability as an architect and of his apparently consistent preference for a traditional colonial style. Burrundulla, with its wide sides and surrounding verandah, illustrates the versatility of conservative Georgian colonial design in Weaver's hands, whereas Jarvisfield recalls the stronger lines of (Weaver's) Villa Maria (1857) at Gladesville. The features of the back of both buildings are almost identical, with arched landing windows set with coloured glass, elongated sides and courtyard. Both of these buildings stood below (a few hundred metres to the east of) the present brick/plaster mansion. Part of the second house still stood in 1937. Bricks for the house were made on the property. A new (third) house was made in 1864/5 by John Macquarie Antill, who founded the Jarvisfield Ayrshire Stud in 1875. He was a prominent breeder and agriculturist. =The Antill family= At least three generations of Antills lived at Jarvisfield until the 1930s: Henry Colden Antill (1779‚Äì1852), John Macquarie Antill Senior (1822‚Äì1900) and John Macquarie Antill Junior (1866‚Äì1937). Henry Colden was born in New York of British stock, his great grandfather Edward having migrated from England to America in 1680. His father John had fought in the war of American Independence. The family migrated first to Canada; Henry was in the British army in India; he migrated to Sydney on 1 January 1810, married Eliza Wills in Sydney in 1818, settled near Liverpool, in 1825 settling on his estate near Picton, Jarvisfield and, in 1844 subdivided part of his estate on the north of Stonequarry Creek, as the result he made possible the founding of the town of Picton. Henry died and was buried in the family vault at Jarvisfield, in August 1852, survived by six sons and two daughters. John Macquarie Antill Sr. was born in Liverpool on 30 May 1822 and at age 18 went to manage the Primrose Valley estate, Molonglo, NSW, concentrating on sheep breeding. At 24 he was appointed a Police Magistrate in Picton, holding this position until his death in 1900. His wife Jessie Hassall Campbell was born on 28 March 1834, married J. M. Antill Sr. in 1851 and continued to live in Jarvisfield with a daughter and their grandchildren, after her husband's death in 1900. She died in Picton in 1917. J. M. Antill Sr. was appointed receiving officer for the Camden electorate in1877, which included Picton. He inherited Jarvisfield in 1858, building a new homestead there for his family in 1864. Wheat growing was ruined by rust, and sheep-raising on account of fluke, both apparently because it was too close to the coast. In 1875 from imported stock, John Sr. established the Ayrshire Study which made Jarvisfield famous. Jessie and John Sr. had 11 children, two of whom did not reach adult life. Antill's grandson Major-General John Macquarie Antill was born at Jarvisfield on 26 January 1866, second surviving son of John and Jessie. John Jr. was educated at Sydney Grammar School and became a surveyor. He joined the local militia in 1887 and in 1889, raised a squadron of mounted infantry in Picton, of which he was given command. This became part of the NSW Mounted Rifles, in which he was commissioned as a captain on 19 January 1889. He had a tour of duty with the British Army in India in 1893. On return to Australia in 1894, he was commissioned into the state's permanent forces as a captain. He was promoted to Major in 1899 and given command of \\"A\\" Squadron of the NSW Mounted Rifles. This squadron participated in the cavalry sweep to relieve Kimberley (Sth. Africa) and was involved in operations in Transvaal and Orange River Colony. Antill was mentioned twice in dispatches, appointed Companion of Bath (CB), returning to Australia a war hero. From 1904 to 1906 he emulated his grandfather by becoming Aide-de-Camp to the Governor-General, Lord Northcote. After this he retired from the army and returned to Picton. In World War I in October 1914 he was appointed to the AIF as brigade major of the 3rd Light Horse Brigade in Turkey. He retired from the army in 1924 with the honorary rank of Major-General, spending several years at Jarvisfield and later living at Manly and Dee Why. Major-General Antill died in 1937, leaving his older brother Robert Henry (Harry) in charge. R. H. Antill was a prominent pastoralist and a noted breeder of Ayrshire cattle. He was chairman of the Picton Pastures Protection Board in 1901‚Äì28 and served as district coroner for forty-two years. In 1967 the Antill Park Golf Club was established on the site, with the homestead forming the club house. 2012 was believed to be the 50th anniversary of formation of the Antill Park Golf Club, lease of the present site and club house. The original club occupied part of a private property on both sides of the present Henry Street.Antill Park Country Golf Club, 2011  Description  =Estate= The core of a once large (2000 acre) grant remains, today managed as a golf course estate near the town of Picton. The golf course is an 18 Hole course with a challenging Par 70 layout, including many picturesque holes flanked by water hazards. At the centre of the Antill Park Country Golf Club is the clubhouse overlooking the 9th Hole and the 10th Tee., with addition by Stuart Read, re Antill and Jarvis links =Garden and early plantings= The house is surrounded by still extensive grounds, formerly gardens and farmland, now the Antill Park Country Golf Club (since 1967). Little evidence of the homestead garden has survived. There are some mature specimens of native pines (Araucaria spp. - hoop (A.cunninghamii) and Bunya (A.bidwillii) pines) in the front of the house which are important plantingsLEP, 1991; 2011 and survive in 2012 (Kabaila). Considerable numbers of mature exotic and native trees planted by the Antills remain, along with more recent Golf Club era plantings. Early tree plantings remaining near the house give a representative selection of common exotic and some locally native tree species often used on the Cumberland Plain's early farms. These also include some now very rare plants in NSW, and particularly locally rare in the Sydney Basin, such as Chinese funeral cypress (Cupressus funebris) and the American Osage orange.Stuart Read, personal comm., 14 May 2003 Early tree plantings include Bunya pines (Araucaria bidwillii), hoop pines (Araucaria cunninghamii), English elms (Ulmus procera) which have suckered into thickets in places, kurrajongs (Brachychiton populneus), white cedars (Melia azederach var.australasica), English oaks (Quercus robur), shelter belts/former farm hedges of American Osage orange (Maclura pomifera). Osage oranges are now extremely rare in the Sydney basin - only two other examples are known, at Hambledon Cottage, Parramatta and Muogamarra Nature Reserve, Hornsby. The Osage orange hedges north and south of the house on its eastern side date to the time the house was first occupied. They have historical significance as part of the early fabric of the place and their association with the Antill family, and are an integral component of the landscaping.Kabaila, 2012, 38 Other early plantings include false acacia (Robinia pseudoacacia, again probably originally shelter belt plantings), again suckering into thickets. =Farm Building Complex= =Homestead= The (now Golf Club-) house was built in 1863 by John Macquarie Antill, hence the name of the Club, Antill Park Country Golf Club. It was first named Jarvisfield, commemorating Governor Macquarie's first wife Jane Jarvis' name and the fact that an Antill had been long-serving aide-de-camp to and a friend of Governor Macquarie. The homestead's verandah overlooks the course and is frequented by locals and visitors who wish to analyse their round, the treachery of the greens or simply enjoy the serene views throughout the course. A two-storey, rendered brick, Georgian Revival country villa with flanking single storey wings which form the sides of the rear courtyard. The hipped roofs of main house and wings are slated and have rendered brickwork chimneys with simple neck mouldings. The single storey verandah lining the front and part of the two side elevations retain their original flat timber columns (but has a new roof following the removal of an Edwardian double storeyed verandah). The new roof line follows the original which was retained in the side return roofs. The front door is flanked by French doors with 2 x 6 paned sash windows to the first floor. On the side elevations blank window recesses maintain facade symmetry at first floor level. The rear elevation is dominated by a large round-headed stair window. =Barn= The site also contains a mid-19th century stone barn. The barn is a simple gable-roofed structure of coursed sparrow-pecked sandstone with exposed timber beams and rafters. Following the site's conversion to a golf course the barn was reused as a Pro-Golf Shop and has undergone extensive internal change as a result. A stable outbuilding, two storied and made of sandstone blocks, remains to the south-west of the main house (AHC). The group listed by the Australian Heritage Commission consists of: * the former Homestead, Jarvisfield (WO0148) * the Jarvisfield Stone Barn (WO0149) * the Brookside Restaurant (Razorback Inn) (WO0150). When the listing was made, these were rural buildings which retained their original relationship to the main road, to each other and to the rural landscape. The group is now part of a golf course with modern residential subdivision in close proximity to the house and barn. A new access road through the new subdivision has been provided. =Razorback Inn (former, 1850)= The Brookside Restaurant (former Razorback Inn), is now at 1580 Hume Highway Deviation, and separately LEP-listed. Built on sold by H. C. Antill to Oliver Whiting ex-convict and servant of the Antill family. It appears that the inn was completed in 1850 and a licence issued for that date. Continued to operate until Whitings moved to an inn at Picton when the railway opened. A Mr. Turner who later lived in the building found two English pennies dated 1850 under the foundations of the place when renovating it. Later used as a guest-house and residence named \\"Brookside\\", also as a restaurant. It is now used in association with the Woolshed complex for functions. =Third House (1864/5)= The third house built on the grant in 1864/5 remains, a large two- storey brick mansion/house plastered over, with verandah facing east, and two wings single storeyed wings to rear (west). Jarvisfield Store (now 470 Menangle Street, Picton and separately LEP-listed)(1863): Built on a lot in 1863 (date in plaster plaque), the land forming part of Jarvisfield where H. C. Antill developed the town of Picton in response to the coming of the railway line and station. One of many small shops catering for the general public until closure of the Picton railway depot. Later known as \\"The Bailiff's\\" because retired police sergeant, McRae, lived there and was town bailiff after retiring from the force. In recent years it was used as a residence and it has now been refurbished for use as an antiques shop. = Condition = As at 13 May 2003, the 1810s first slab homestead built on this site. In Major H. C. Antill built a larger family house. Both of these buildings stood below (a few hundred metres to the east of) the present house/mansion. Part of the second house still stood in 1937. In 1864/5, the third house was built of bricks made on the property. In 1967 the estate became the Antill Park Country Golf Club, and the third house its clubhouse. = Modifications and dates = *upper storey homestead verandah added, ground floor verandah modified, upper floor French doors added *1964conversion of homestead to Golf Club house, by Howard Morton, architect *restoration works including drainage, ground floor verandah, removal of upper verandah doors undertaken by Howard Tanner, architect. *2012ground floor verandah restoration and roof repair by NSW Public Works.Kabaila, 2012, 2Dept. of Commerce. = Further information = Date of current mansion unknown.  Heritage listing  As at 17 August 2007, Jarvisfield's remaining estate is a rural cultural landscape containing the core of the original farm grant, the third Antill house constructed on it, a sandstone stable outbuilding and extensive grounds containing considerable numbers of mature exotic and native trees planted by the Antills. These early plantings give a representative selection of common exotic and some locally native tree species often used on the Cumberland Plain's early farms. These also include some now very rare plants in NSW, and particularly locally rare in the Sydney Basin, such as Chinese funeral cypress (Cupressus funebris) and American osage orange (Maclura pomifera). Osage oranges are now extremely rare in the Sydney basin - only two other examples are known, at Hambledon Cottage, Parramatta and Muogamarra Nature Reserve, Hornsby. Jarvisfield was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Osage orange hedges north and south of the house on its eastern side date to the time the house was first occupied. They have historical significance as part of the early fabric of the place and their association with the Antill family, and are an integral component of the landscaping. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history.

History  Australian Poetry Slam began in 2005, progressing from individual areas to state and eventually to the national competition it is today. This was largely made possible by Word Travels partnership with government libraries from 2005 until 2009, although the collaboration continues to exist, simply on a lesser scale. It developed into a national competition in 2008, when the first Champion was crowned and has been held every year since. National poetry slams, with a similar format also occur in America, Canada, New Zealand and an increasing quantity of African nations. = Word Travels = Miles Merrill brought poetry slams from Chicago to Australia both through his own artistic endeavours and by founding Word Travels, which he remains the creative director of. In 2010 Word Travels was approved as an incorporation and not-for-profit arts association. This organisation created and continues to run the Australian Poetry Slam both through government funding and grants, as well as donations from the public. = Staff = The current staff at Word Travels are in charge of coordinating and organising both Story-Fest and the Australian Poetry Slam. These staff are predominantly a large cohort of volunteers who do everything from maintaining budgets to timing events and directing visiting poets and workshop participants. = Story-Fest = Word Travels has additionally created an annual literary festival known as Story-Fest which coincides with the National Poetry Slam Final and Sydney and New South Wales Finals. It occurs over a succession of three days throughout various Sydney locations and typically includes numerous workshops, forums and performances by local and international artists. Artists that have been involved in Story-Fest include Ian Keteku, Sukhjit Kaur Khalsa, Kaie Kellough and Deborah Emmanuel.  Rules  The Australian Poetry Slam has a fairly compact set of rules aimed at controlling participation, organising logistics and increasing fairness. The current rules are listed below * No staff or volunteers at the venue of heats, of the Australian Poetry Slam or Word Travels (the organising body for the Australian Poetry Slam) may compete. * No contestant may compete in a state, territory or region that they do not reside in. * Contestants may enter numerous heats, as long as they are all within their state of residence. * There will be no more than 20 contestants per heat. When more than 20 poets enter venues shall select a method for determining who has the opportunity to compete. Typically it is based upon the order in which poets signed up to perform, with the first 20 poets to sign up competing, or with the first 15 who sign up competing, and all other potential competitors having their names placed in a hat, with 5 names pulled out to confirm the remaining five participants. * Signing up to perform occurs on the night of the heat, at the venue the heat is to take place. * The organiser/host of the heat shall randomly select five members of the audience to act as judges throughout the event. The judges shall score on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being the lowest and 10 the highest. These scores shall also be to 1 decimal place. Of these five scores, the highest and lowest shall be ignored with the middle three scores combined to determine the poets‚Äô final score for the evening. * Competitors shall perform in a random order, as determined by a draw conducted by an organiser/host. (This is an attempt to minimise the negative impacts of score creep, a phenomenon by which the judges scores generally increase throughout the event therefore advantaging later performers). * Competitors may not use any props, instruments or costumes. Only the poet‚Äôs body, voice, provided microphone (some venues provide microphones whilst others may not. It is up to the organiser's discretion) and transcript the poem for the performers personal use. * Competitors may only perform poems constructed within the last year that are their own, original work. However these poems may be on any topic, concept or idea whatsoever so long as they are not intended to offend anyone. The principle idea of this is to allow free creative expression without marginalising any other individuals or collectives. Common focus points are typically contemporary social justice issues. These include; personal growth and development, mental health, description of emotions or experiences, race, feminism, sexual and gendered identity and relationships. * There is a 2 minute time limit, with 1 point deducted from the final score for going beyond the 2 minutes, and another 1 point deducted from the final score for every 30 seconds above that meaning that at 2 minutes and 1 second you will be deducted a point, and at 2 minutes and 31 seconds you will be deducted an additional point, and so it continues. The two minutes commences from the moment the timekeeper feels your performance has begun, this may include introductions and body movements prior to the commencement of the poem. * Unless the event is marked as designated for young people to compete the Australian Poetry Slam welcomes people of all ages to enter. However, those under the age of 18 ought to consider the location and the possibility that they may need to be escorted by an adult. * The poets that progress to the next heat, such as regional heats, state or territory finals or the national final will be the two performers with the highest scores from their respective events.  Format  The competition begins with 50 localised heats, in categories ranging from metropolitan to regional to country such as the Sydney CBD heat and the Bathurst heat. The two poets with the highest scores from each heat then sometimes progress onto regional heats such as the Western Sydney Poetry Slam Final and Sydney Poetry Slam Final once again with the top two poets progressing. In other circumstances such as Canberra and Tasmania participants directly progress into state and territory finals, with the two highest scoring poets participating in the National Final. Many of these heats are run specifically for the Australian Poetry Slam, however several others are regularly running events, often monthly that simply designate that event as a round to qualify for the Australian Poetry Slam, such as the Granville Poetry Slam and Wollongong Poetry Slam in New South Wales. Another convention of the poetry slam format is that whilst poets are clapped after their performance and scores, they are additionally 'clicked' at during their performance. The audience clicks throughout the performance to encourage the poet as well as provide direct feedback regarding which lines, phrases or gestures connected with them the best, without being loud enough to ruin or distract from the performance. = Prizes = The current prize for first position is the opportunity to perform at the Byron Writers Festival, Ubud Writers and Readers Festival, Singapore Writers Festival and Hong Kong International Literary Festival. All of the expenses for this tour are paid by Word Travels and their partners. The Australian Poetry Slam Champion shall also receive a two week writing retreat in New South Wales Bundanon Trust. However these prizes do change regularly as a result of shifting partnerships and availabilities such as the recently developed partnership between the Australian and Canadian Poetry Slam coordinators. Additionally due to age and residency requirements the above prizes only apply to those over 18 years of age and residing in Australia. To compensate for these conditions if the winner of the Australian Poetry Slam is under 18 year age they shall be eligible to receive a prize dedicated to youth or if the Champion is not an Australian resident they will be awarded a cash prize.

It is the largest youth poetry slam in Sydney, with various young artists between the age of 12 and 18 regularly competing. It consists of a series of heats in which young poets are encouraged to practice as well as workshops allowing them to develop their skills. The Rumble is then held to determine the best young Sydney poet, with the winner gaining the opportunity to perform at the National Australian Poetry Slam Final. It is typically held at Parramatta Riverside Theatre and aims to provide youth with a space to utilise their voices in a meaningful way. The 2018 Rumble champion was Helen Latukefu. The 2017 Rumble champion was Georgia Chapman. The 2016 Rumble champion was Emily Crocker. The rules for The Rumble are similar to those of the Australian Poetry Slam.  Multilingual Poetry Slam  The Multilingual Poetry Slam is created and run annually by Word Travels as part of the IN OTHER WORDS festival, with the first event held in 2013. It is a poetry slam held in Sydney that encourages poets to perform in their native language, whatever that may be as all languages are accepted. Through this practice Word Travels aims to celebrate the diversity of language and culture. The 2018 Multilingual Champion was Joseph Schwarzkopf. In 2017 Hasitha Adhikariarachchi was the Mulitlingual Poetry Slam Champion. The 2016 Multilingual Champion was Bhupen Thakkar.  References  * Australian Poetry Slam. (2018). Australian Poetry Slam.

The project restored an 18th century farmhouse to provide a community meeting place, caf√©, garden and workshops. The project runs classes, workshops and training courses in a variety of crafts and skills aimed at all age groups. It also provides facilities for performances, gatherings, talks, entertainment and small conferences. Given charitable status under the title Bridgend Inspiring Growth (BIG), the project was one of the first in Scotland to achieve community ownership in an urban setting. In 2018 it became the first organisation in Scotland to transfer from a Scottish Charitable Incorporated Organisation (SCIO) to a Community Benefit Society with charitable status. Bridgend Farmhouse  Site history  The site has had buildings since the 16th century. According to the 1792 history of the area by the minister of Liberton, Rev Thomas Whyte, James V of Scotland built a hunting lodge on the site, adjoining which was 'a handsome chapel' which was probably built around 1518 by Sir Simon Preston of Craigmillar, whose family owned the estate. The chapel was built 'for the health of the souls' of King James III and King James IV . In the 18th century the chapel building was being used as a stable and this was still the case in 1843, according to Fullarton's Gazetteer. A major archeological survey of the site in 2014 confirmed there had been a significant building on the chapel site in the medieval period. The renegade Archibald Wauchope of Niddrie was captured at Bridgend in May 1589 after James VI arrived and broke up the siege of \\"a stone house within a mile\\" of Edinburgh.William Boyd & Henry Meikle, Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1589-1593, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 73. The present day farmhouse building dates from the mid 18th century and was extended to its current size early in the 19th. It was originally worked as a mixed dairy and arable farm but in the late 19th century much of the arable land was sold to become Dickson and Co.'s Royal Nursery. When the nursery closed in the 1960s the farm reverted to mixed arable, cattle and pig farming. Latterly the farm was worked by the Binnie family and then the Darling family, who bought the land in 1962 and the house in 1965 until the council bought it in 1998 and the Darling's left in 2000. A social history project called 'Place, Work, Folk' was carried out between September 2017 and April 2019 to record, share and document the lived memories of Bridgend Farmhouse, funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund.  Origins  The project began in 2010 when a small group of local residents and volunteers at Bridgend Allotments Community Health Inclusion Project, (later Bridgend Growing Communities) held a public meeting to discuss restoring the farmhouse, by then derelict and crumbling, into a community hub. Planning took inspiration from the Edinburgh social reformer and town planner Sir Patrick Geddes, adopting his ethos of 'work, place, folk'. In 2010 the group set up the charity Bridgend Inspiring Growth (Charity number SC042769), with the aim of turning the farmhouse and its grounds into a community centre focusing on the environment and outdoors and which would offer opportunities for learning, training and community development. Four years of consultation and planning for outreach, engagement events and community development followed. Malcolm Fraser gave design advice and the Glass-House Community Led Design charity advised on how community engagement activities might be developed around the design of the farmhouse, and held a workshop to progress this further. A community development officer was appointed in 2013 to set up outreach programmes in the nearby Craigmillar/ Niddrie and Inch/Moredun areas. The charity was awarded grants from Historic Environment Scotland and the City of Edinburgh Council. In 2014 funding was obtained from the Growing Community Assets programme of the Big Lottery Fund (BLF) to scope and further develop this idea and prepare an application for major BLF funding. The property was owned at this stage by the City of Edinburgh Council who in 2014 agreed to give Bridgend Inspiring Growth a years 'license to use' the property. At that point weekly volunteer activity sessions started to transform the derelict site. The charity received grants towards community development work from City of Edinburgh Council and others. In 2015 City of Edinburgh Council agreed to transfer the land and Bridgend Farmhouse to BIG for ¬£1 in one of the first cases of urban asset transfer in Scotland. This was after the Council had received 14 offers for the property, the highest being ¬£215,000. This transfer took place before the Community Empowerment (Scotland) Act 2015 came into force in Scotland. The title deeds ensured that the land and building must, in perpetuity, always and only be used as a community centre for learning, eating and exercise. In 2015 the charity received a grant of over ¬£1 million from the Big Lottery Fund and further grants from the Robertson Trust and Historic Environment Scotland. Bridgend farm opened as a community centre on 24 March 2018.  Restoration  The design was developed over years of consultation with BIG and the wider community. This involved community-led design workshops and focus group discussions. The intention was a sympathetic restoration, reinstating traditional historic features such as the chimney stacks and sash and case windows. It included the addition of four community workshops which were built to look like traditional farm stable barns. The Farmhouse was kept true to its original structure, and many internal features such as timber roof beams, the window shutter panels, and original staircase and handrail being retained. The architects were Halliday Fraser Munro, The design team was completed by quantity surveyors David Adamson Group, structural engineers Elliot & Co, services engineer Harley Haddow and project manager Graham Harper. Cornhill Building Services were engaged as the main contractors and, with assistance from BIG volunteers in charring and cladding on the workshops, painting and decorating, and building and installing furniture and features, delivered the restored farmhouse to the project in late 2017. In January 2019 the project was commended for a RIBA MacEwan Award in architecture for 'the common good'.  Aims  The project aims to expand opportunities for learning, healthy eating and exercise to people of all ages living in the nearby estates of Craigmillar, Niddrie, Inch, Moredun and surrounding area. Specifically the project aims to advance: * Development opportunities in the surrounding communities. Specifically it seeks to improve citizenship skills. It aims to provide opportunities for volunteers and to provide education and training in outdoor skills and improve understanding of the environment. * Healthy living, promoting healthier lifestyle choices to improve physical and psychological health. It also aims to reduce social isolation by providing a welcoming social environment * Understanding of the history of the area and its heritage. * Equality of opportunity and promotion of diversity. * Awareness and increased use of Craigmillar Castle park, and provide education about and increase awareness of biodiversity and protection of the environment.  Facilities  Bridgend Farmhouse Cafe Bridgend Bike Shed Facilities on the site include: * An outdoor education workshop * A bicycle workshop * An arts and crafts workshop * A DIY workshop * An exhibition/meeting room * Outdoor stage and performance area * A kitchen garden * External barns * A community caf√© *A training kitchen  Activities  Activities and projects include 'Place, Work, Folk' a local history project, which includes creating a collection of oral history recordings from local residents. There are two open volunteer activity sessions every Wednesday and Sunday which involve gardening, building, woodwork, landscaping, arts and crafts, cooking and other group activities. The caf√© kitchen provides training courses which can lead to qualifications in The Royal Environmental Health Institute of Scotland (REHIS) Food Hygiene, and Health & Nutrition. Courses can be completed toward a Scottish Qualification Award (SQA) in Working With Others. There is also a project called 'Real Fast Food' which involves preparing healthy locally grown food and delivering it to people who are unable to get out of their house, on an electric powered bike and trailer. There have been courses in crafts, such as lime mortar pointing and gardening. Other courses have included \\"Making natural cosmetics\\", \\"Forest skills\\", and \\"Intergenerational storytelling\\" which created a book of shared stories. There are regular community groups and classes, including a weekly singing group, craft club and woodwork club. The project's Acorn Fund supports local people and groups with their own projects on site. These have included \\"Building a wormery\\", \\"Wood carving\\", \\"A singing group\\", \\"A seed library\\", \\"Film & media training for volunteers\\" and \\"Medicinal dhal workshops.\\"  Partnerships  Bridgend Inspiring Growth has, or has had, collaborative partnerships with the following organisations: = Charitable organisations = * Patrick Geddes Centre * Health in Mind * Arts in Healthcare * The Sorted Project * Crisis * The Welcoming * Positive Realities * The Real Junk Food Project Edinburgh * Caring in Craigmillar * Bingham 50+ * Bridgend Growing Communities * Orchard Project * Non-stuff Industries * Teens Plus * Edinburgh & Lothians Greenspace Trust * Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh * Traditional Arts and Culture Scotland *Lone Fathers‚Äô Edinburgh = Schools = *Castlebrae High School *Niddrie Mill Primary School = Universities and Colleges = *Edinburgh College *Newbattle Abbey College *Edinburgh University = Others = *Power of Food Festival *Volunteer Centre, Edinburgh *Cockburn Association *Track Scotland *Scottish Ecological Design Associationhttps://www.seda.uk.net *Edinburgh City Council Local Area Coordination teams  Governance  In 2018 BIG became the first organisation in Scotland to transfer from a Scottish Charitable Incorporated Organisation (SCIO) to a Community Benefit Society with Charitable Status (CCBS). Under this model members buy shares to become part-owners of the land and project and each member has one vote. The first Community Share Issue in 2018 raised over ¬£70,000 from 400 members and these members have rights to decide the future of the organisation, vote at the AGM and advise on strategic direction and management. BIG has a board of twelve trustees all of whom are volunteers. At least 50% of the Trustees must live within the area of benefit and no decision can be made at a Board level without a local majority being present. The organisation has democratic structures which enable volunteers and members to direct the work of the project. There are three working groups which meet monthly; Buildings and Land, Activities and Events, and Business. These are a monthly forum for volunteers to work together and make collective decisions.  Awards and recognition  In January 2019 the project was commended for a RIBA MacEwan Award in architecture for 'the common good'. Bridgend Farmhouse was chosen as an example of good practice in the Scottish Government's 'A Connected Scotland; Strategy for tackling social isolation and loneliness and building stronger communities' 2018. In June 2019 the project received a 'Special Commendation' in the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations (SCVO) Charity of the Year awards in the 'Celebrating Communities' category.

He trained in Paris with the famous French Neoclassical painter Jacques-Louis David. Van Dorne worked in Paris until 1822, the year in which he returned to his hometown Louvain.F√©lix Stappaerts, Fran√ßois van Dorne in: Biographie nationale de Belgique, Volume 6, pp. 134-138 Life Frans van Dorne was the son of Martin van Dorne and Petronilla Ekermans. His father was an eminent painter of still lifes of fruit and flowers who was nominated court painter by Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine, the governor of the Austrian Netherlands.F√©lix Stappaerts, Martin van Dorne in: Biographie nationale de Belgique, Volume 6, pp. 132-134 Mother and child Frans trained initially with his father. Later he studied under Pieter-Jozef Verhaghen, a prominent history and portrait painter in the Baroque style and a court painter of Maria Theresa of Austria. Verhaghen was then a teacher at the Academy of Leuven, which had been founded in October 1800 by van Dorne's father, together with Verhaghen, Fran√ßois Xavier Joseph Jacquin, Josse-Pieter Geedts, Frans Berges, Pieter Goyers and Antoon Clevenbergh.Karen Andree, Van voor Teniers tot na Ensor: Collectie Noordbrabants Museum te gast, M van Museum Leuven, 2012, p. 65 Van Dorne won the prize for drawing after the antique at the Academy in 1802. Thanks to the prize he disposed of the necessary financial resources to continue his studies in Paris. In Paris he became one of a selected number of pupils of Jacques- Louis David, the famous French Neoclassical painter. He worked in Paris for a long time. In 1806, he received from the magistrates of his native city Leuven a commission to paint a full-length portrait of Emperor Napoleon. Van Dorne submitted a mythological picture representing Venus to the Paris Salon of 1808. The painting was not well received by the critics and from that time onwards the artist decided to dedicate himself to portrait painting. Van Dorne married Maria Theresia Bastin√© who was the sister of the painter Jean-Baptiste Bastin√© of Louvain, an artist who had also studied under David in Paris around the same time as van Dorne. Fanny Van Dorne, the artist's daughter Van Dorne remained in Paris until 1822, the year in which he returned to his hometown Louvain. He produced a large number of portraits until the end of his career. He received a commission from a monastic institution in England to paint four religious compositions representing various episodes of the life of the Virgin. He also painted a copy of a masterpiece of the Flemish Baroque master Gaspar de Crayer for the St. Peter's Church in Leuven. He died in Leuven on 30 November 1848. Work Frans van Dorne was mainly a portrait painter although he also painted a number of religious compositions. His portraits show the influence of the French Classicism that he had studied under David in France.

Her contributions to the Indianapolis, Indiana, arts community included financial support and gifts of fine art to the Art Association of Indianapolis (the forerunner to the Indianapolis Museum of Art and the Indiana University ‚Äì Purdue University Indianapolis Herron School of Art and Design), in addition to serving as a board member of Herron School of Art (1916‚Äì1947) and president of the Art Association of Indianapolis (1941‚Äì1947). Fesler was also a patron of the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra and founded the city's Ensemble Music Society. Her major art collecting interests and acquisitions tended toward Post-Impressionist and modernist paintings, although not exclusively, and included paintings by Georges Braque, Paul C√©zanne, Marc Chagall, Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, Georgia O'Keeffe, Georges Seurat, and Vincent Van Gogh, among others. The Marmon Memorial Collection, which Fesler established in honor of her parents, remains an important part of the Indianapolis Museum of Art's permanent collections. Early life and education Caroline Marmon was born in 1878 in Richmond, Wayne County, Indiana, to Elizabeth (Carpenter) (1849‚Äì1940) and Daniel W. Marmon (1844‚Äì1909). Caroline's father, a mechanic and engineer, was a principle of the Nordyke and Marmon Company, a manufacturer of milling equipment that provided the base of the family's wealth. When she was still young the family moved to Indianapolis, Indiana, where her father became president of a local power and light company and later founded the Marmon Motor Car Company, a luxury automobile manufacturer. Her two older brothers, Walter C. Marmon (1872‚Äì1940) and Howard Carpenter Marmon (1876‚Äì1943), followed their father into the family's automobile manufacturing business.\\"Caroline Marmon Fesler\\" in See: See also: Also: Marmon grew up in Indianapolis, where she attended local public schools and May Wright Sewall's Girls' Classical School. After graduating from Smith College in Northhampton, Massachusetts, in 1900,Most sources report that she graduated from Smith College in 1900; however, at least one source indicated the year was 1898. See: \\"Caroline Marmon Fesler\\" in Marmon studied painting in Paris. Although she did not become an artist herself, Marmon further developed her lifelong interests in art, music, and French culture while living in France. Marriage Caroline Marmon married James William Fesler (1864‚Äì1949), a prominent Indianapolis attorney on June 2, 1917. Fesler, who became a senior partner in the law firm of Fesler, Elam and Young, was a graduate of Indiana University (A.B. degree in 1887; honorary doctorate degree in 1940). He was also as a member of the IU Board of Trustees (1902‚Äì1936) and served as the board's vice president (1916‚Äì1919) and president (1919‚Äì1936). In 1920 he made an unsuccessful run as a Republican candidate for governor of Indiana. The Feslers, who resided at 4035 North Pennsylvania Street in Indianapolis, had no children. Caroline Fesler inherited from her mother the Marmon family's lakeside summer home at 1100 East Shore Drive at Lake Maxinkuckee.Robinson and Berry, p. 113. (Golin incorrectly states it was Pennsylvania Avenue, instead of Pennsylvania Street.) Career Fesler's leadership and cultural philanthropy reflected her major interests in fine art and music. Her lifelong contributions to the Indianapolis arts community included financial support and acquisitions of fine art, especially gifts of 20th-century modern art. An avid art collector and arts patron, she supported the work of the Art Association of Indianapolis (the forerunner to the Indianapolis Museum of Art and the IUPUI Herron School of Art and Design) for several decades, in addition to serving as president of the Arts Association in the 1940s, when the association maintained the John Herron Art Museum and the Herron art school.The Art Association of Indianapolis organized in 1883 for the promotion and study of art in the city, hosted various art exhibitions, and established an art school. Following the receipt of a $225,000 bequest from the estate of John Herron, the association built an art museum and art school named in his honor in a house on property it acquired at the corner of 16th and Pennsylvania Streets. The association had a new building designed by Indianapolis architects Vonnegut and Bohn constructed on the site. It opened to the public in 1906 and the Herron art school moved into its own building in 1907. See Bodenhamer and Barrows, eds., p. 266. Fesler also enjoyed classical music. She was a patron of the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra and founded the city's Ensemble Music Society. =Art collector= Pablo Picasso's Ma Jolie (1914) Fesler's major art collecting interests and acquisitions tended toward Post-Impressionist and modernist paintings, although not exclusively. She collected paintings by Paul C√©zanne, Pablo Picasso, Georges Seurat, and Georgia O'Keeffe, who was also a personal friend, and other artists. Fesler's early art collecting efforts for the Art Association of Indianapolis began as a member of the Gamboliers, a group of Indianapolis art patrons who pooled their funds to acquire the works of contemporary artists whose reputations had not yet been established in the art world and whose work was not yet receiving significant interest from major art collectors and art museums. The group existed from 1927 to 1934 and then disbanded, but its contributions helped build the Herron Museum's modern art collection, in addition to introducing \\"modern art to a wider audience.\\"Each member of the Gamboliers contributed $25 per year toward an annual budget of $2,500 to acquire modern art. It had a total of thirty-five members during its brief existence. For a complete list of Gambolier members, see The museum accepted 155 works from the Gamboliers. Among the group's most notable acquisitions for the museum was Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec's color lithograph, Moulin Rouge: La Goulue, in 1936.Schlagenhauff, \\"Gifts of the Gamboliers,\\" p. 19.Robinson and Berry, p. 100. Fesler also acquired works of art on her own that she anonymously donated to the Art Association's Herron Museum. In the early 1940s her widowed mother, Elizabeth Marmon, made a $1 million bequest to each of her three children as part of their inheritance from their industrialist father, Daniel Marmon. Fesler used the bulk of her inherited funds from this gift to acquire a collection of paintings that she planned from the outset to donate to the Art Association's museum as a memorial to her parents. During the 1940s Fesler acquired for the museum a collection of eight paintings by Meindert Hobbema, Corneille de Lyon, Aelbert Cuyp, Jacob van Ruisdael, Vincent van Gogh, Willem Kalf, Georges Seurat, and Paul C√©zanne.Robinson and Berry, pp. 110‚Äì11, 114‚Äì15. Although her acquisitions were made anonymously, it was not a well-kept secret at the museum that Fesler was the source of the gifts. When she did become publicly known as the donor, Art News described her as \\"a new kind of patron,\\" one who acquired works of art directly for the museum and not for herself.Warkel, Krause, and Berry, p. 115. =Philanthropic leadership= Fesler's contributions to the Herron museum and art school in Indianapolis did not begin or end with her donations of fine art. She also provided substantial financial support and leadership. Fesler served as a board member of the Herron School of Art from 1916 to 1947, and remained active on several committees at the Art Association, including its Fine Arts Committee and the Art School Committee. In 1941 Fesler succeeded Evans Woolen II as president of the Art Association of Indianapolis and continued to serve in that role until 1947, when she resigned for health reasons. Fesler's generous support of the organization continued through bequests made in her will following her death in 1960. In 1928 the construction of a new Herron art school building on the Art Association's property at 16th and Pennsylvania Streets was made possible through an anonymous $200,000 gift, which the association's leadership knew was Fesler's donation. The old art school building was demolished and replaced with a new facility designed by Paul Philippe Cret, a French architect whose firm was located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Robert Frost Daggett of Indianapolis. The new art school building was dedicated on September 5, 1929.Robinson and Berry, pp. 84‚Äì85, 88. In 1933 Fesler spearheaded the decision to separate the Herron art school from the museum under separate directors.The final separation of the art school and museum did not occur until after Fesler's death. In 1967 the Art Association transferred the operation of the art school on the 16th Street site to Indiana University. The school later became known as the Herron School of Art and Design, now located on the present-day IUPUI campus. In 1970 the Art Association officially became known as the Indianapolis Museum of Art and relocated to the Krannert Pavilion, a new building constructed on the acre Oldfields estate, the former home of Josiah K. Lilly Jr. that the Lilly family had donated to the Art Association in 1966. See Bodenhamer and Barrows, ed., p. 267. While Wilbur Peat remained the head of the Herron museum, Fesler led a search for the Herron art school's first director, recommending artist and New York art educator Donald Mattison for the position and offering to pay his salary.Warkel, Krause, and Berry, p. 83.Robinson and Berry, p. 91. In 1940 Fesler's financial support shifted from the Herron art school to the museum, beginning with a remodeling of its 16th Street museum building in 1940‚Äì41. She made an anonymous $50,000 donation in support of renovations to the building that was combined with additional funds of $85,000 from other sources to complete the project. Beginning in December 1943 and continuing over a period of about eighteen months, Fesler also made a series of acquisitions that she donated the Art Institute to fill what she considered to be gaps in the museum's collections.Warkel, Krause, and Berry, p. 105. Fesler's first major gifts of art to the Herron museum included eight paintings that formed the core of The Marmon Memorial Collection, named in honor of her parents. The artworks included Hobbema's The Water Mill (The Trevor Landscape); Corneille's Portrait of a Man with a Glove; Cuyp's The Valkhof at Nijmegen; Ruisdael's Landscape with Cascade; Van Gogh's Landscape at Saint-Remy (Enclosed Field with Peasant) ; Kalf's Still Life with a Chinese Porcelain Jar; Seurat's The Channel of Gravelines, Petit Fort Philippe; and C√©zanne's House in Provence. These additions to Herron's collections helped the museum attain national stature among U.S. art museums. She also acquired Georgia O'Keeffe's Grey Hills, and donated her friend's painting to the Herron museum in 1943. Fesler made other donations of fine art to the Art Association, even when the selection proved to be controversial. One instance occurred in 1944 after members of Herron's arts committee, preferring more conservative works from well-established artists, declined to purchase Pablo Picasso's Ma Jolie (1914). Fesler acquired the painting herself and bequeathed it to the museum in 1960.Warkel, Krause, and Berry, pp. 112, 115. Fesler's support of the Art Association continued after her death. In her will she bequeathed to the organization a $500,000 gift for improvements to the Herron museum/art school at its 16th Street site. Herron's board approved the use of $300,000 from the bequest to build a three-story wing for the Herron art school. Indianapolis architect Evans Woollen III designed the new building, which was constructed at the northwest corner of the Paul Philippe Cret-designed building that Fester had funded in 1928. In addition to Picasso's Ma Jolie (1914), Fesler bequeathed several more paintings from her private collection to the Herron museum. These works included Picasso's Music, Henri Matisse's Seated Girl, Georges Braque's Still Life with Red Fish, Giorgio di Chireo's Street of Arcades, Marc Chagall's Horse and Rider, and Marie Laurencen's Circus Horse.Warkel, Krause, and Berry, p. 134. =Music patron= In addition to art, Fesler enjoyed classical music, especially chamber music. She was also a patron of the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra. In 1944 she founded Indianapolis's Ensemble Music Society and served as its vice president. Fesler was especially known for frequently hosting private chamber music concerts performed by renowned musical groups at her Indianapolis home. She also became acquainted with numerous musicians, including Alexander Schnieder, who collaborated with pianist Eugene Istomin at one of her annual concert events. Death and legacy Fesler died at her home in Indianapolis on December 28, 1960. Her remains are interred at Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis, as are those of her husband, James Fesler, and other members of the Marmon family. See also: Evans Woollen III considered Fesler to be Indianapolis's \\"first lady of the arts.\\" The Marmon Memorial Collection, which she began in the mid-1940s, remains intact at the Indianapolis Museum of Art. Blanche Stillson, who knew Fesler well, wrote that her longtime friend had \\"an intuitive appreciation of quality.\\" Fesler's \\"keen eye\\" and generous donations brought what Ellen Lee, an Indianapolis Museum of Art curator called \\"the bones of a great collection\\" to Indianapolis.Robinson and Berry, p. 112. The Herron Art Institute's Paul Cret-designed building, constructed in 1928 from funding that Fesler provided, and Fesler Hall, the three-story modern building designed by Evans Woollen III that was funded through a Fesler bequest and completed in 1962, are still standing. The two historic buildings serve as the campus for the present-day Herron High School.Bodenhamer and Barrows, eds., p. 14.

A party of ten line repairers was proceeding towards the top of the Skewen, on a repairer‚Äôs trolly[sic], and was rounding a curve when a locomotive travelling on the same rails in the opposite direction dashed into the trolly.

The gap is usually revealed after a family immigrates from one country to another and assimilates into a culture. After immigration, a child adapts into a new culture quickly. The child usually interacts with more people from the new culture than the culture of their parents. School attendance plays a significant role in the shift of values and attitudes. The acculturation gap-distress hypothesis states that because the parent and child acculturate at different rates, the acculturation gap exists. Because the parents have spent more time embracing their own culture and heritage, it takes more time for them to acculturate. Acculturation occurs when a person adapts into a new culture and learns its language, values, and traditions. When children acculturate, they are less proud of their family and view their parents as controlling. The parents do not switch their views and ideologies in the same way. The gap in language, values, and traditions between the child and parent is linked to conflict between them.  Conflict  The acculturation gap in language can cause conflict between members of an immigrant family. The parents use their native language more so than the primary language of their new environment. The child, depending on the age of the child during immigration, is more likely to assume the local primary language as their own. If a child does not formally learn the language of their parents, conflict arises between the family because it becomes difficult for the parent and child to discuss topics in depth with one another. When parents have to rely on their child for translation, it reverses the child- parent relationship and can lead to complications.  Acculturation gap- distress hypothesis  The acculturation gap causes distress among parents and their children. When parents acculturate at a slower rate than their children, it can result in the parent growing apart from the child and not feeling as connected as before. In addition, parents could prevent the child from participating in activities that are a part of the new culture, which could lead the child to want to acculturate even further. Studies found that the increased conflict leads to more tense families that do not bond as deeply as others. In addition, it is likely that these children act out behaviorally or academically. One study with Mexican-American families found that intergenerational acculturation was unrelated to youth behavioral issues and family conflict disproving the acculturation gap-distress hypothesis. The study found that when the parent was more acculturated than the child, the child struggled with aggression and antisocial behavior. This study also found that when neither the parent or child was acculturated to the American or traditional culture, the child had a greater risk of conduct problems.  Cultural dissonance  Immigrants sometimes face cultural dissonance when moving from one place to another. They may be confronted with prejudice from locals who feel their home has been infiltrated. This results in the immigrant feeling uncomfortable in the new environment which can potentially lead to conflict. Studies have found that an immigrant child's exposure to discrimination and negative stereotypes while acculturating also can generate family conflict back at home due to the child's lost traditional cultural values.  East Asian-American study findings  Multiple studies were conducted to evaluate the acculturation gap and whether or not it has detrimental effects. The studies ask children and parents about how they feel about their own acculturation and the acculturation of other family members. The studies then compare the gaps. Results from some studies showed that parents were more attached to their cultural heritage while other studies showed that the children were more attached than their parents. Based on this, the acculturation gap may not be as predicted. Studies also reflect that many struggle with adjusting culturally. Studies exhibit links between cultural dissonance and depression in the case of Chinese-American children. Chinese- Canadian and Chinese-American children who do not know the Chinese language as well as they'd like show a link to depression. Higher conflict than normal is shown in Indian-American, Soviet-American, and Vietnamese-American families where the acculturation gap exists. Researchers found that the acculturation gap between East Asian-American generations is negatively correlated with parent-youth relationships. This disconnection leads to different mental health problems among the youth.  Mexican-American study findings  Studies were conducted in the American Southwest, where there are many children with Mexican ancestry, to see how these children's home and parental values clash with the values of their peers at school. Studies have shown that higher levels of acculturation correlate with delinquency‚Äîthe existence of a gap can increase the likelihood of children participating in deviant behaviors. Studies with Mexican-American youth and parents also reflect similar data that remains inconclusive. The study notes that in the American Southwest, Mexican culture is prevalent and the close proximity to Mexico may play a role in the results. Minimal research has been done to see the impact of the acculturation gap on parents compared to adolescents. However, one study has found that there is a link between Hispanic adults that have low acculturation rates and an increased risk of poor low-density lipoprotein cholesterol control.  Confounding variables in studies  Confounding variables (such as income and stability) exist in evaluations that connect the acculturation gap and family conflict. Therefore, the acculturation gap hypothesis needs further testing. Furthermore, migration and work add to family stresses. Immigrants parents in the United States typically have longer work days and are away from their children more. These details must be addressed in future studies.  Future acculturation gap research  Understanding the acculturation gap is important because minority population in the US continues to grow. Further research regarding the connection of acculturation gaps to family conflict could produce methods of to prevent conflict and treat those affected.

It will export LNG produced by the project's partners in the Montney Formation gas fields near Dawson Creek, B.C. Outline of the project The total investment, estimated at $40 billion, was approved on October 1, 2018, by the shareholders of the project, which are subsidiaries of five international companies: Royal Dutch Shell Plc. (40%, lead partner), of the UK and Holland; PETRONAS (25%), of Malaysia; PetroChina Co. Ltd. (15%), of China; Mitsubishi Corp. (15%), of Japan; and Korea Gas Corporation (5%) of Korea. The project will initially export LNG from two processing units, or \\"trains\\", totalling 6.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of natural gas, and that, ultimately, the project may add two more trains and increase total production to 26 mtpa. The Final Investment Decision for the LNG Canada project has been considered a significant step not only for Canada's energy industry but also for the global LNG industry, as natural gas, including its liquefied form, is being used more and more extensively to fuel power plants, petrochemical plants and natural gas distribution pipelines to homes and offices, as well as to fuel various transport modes such as ocean shipping When completed, LNG Canada will likely be the first Canadian terminal to export LNG overseas, whereas several LNG liquefaction and export terminals are already operating on the Gulf and Atlantic coasts of the United States, with others being planned, including on the US west coast (see List of LNG terminals). Within ten days of the announcement of the investment decision, two Japanese gas utilities, Toho Gas and Tokyo Gas, signed heads of agreement for LNG purchasing contracts over 15 and 13 years, respectively, with a subsidiary of one of the LNG Canada partners and shareholders, i.e. Mitsubishi. The scope of the facility includes: * LNG Processing Units * Storage Tanks * LNG Loading Lines * Marine Terminal * Rail Yard * Water Treatment Facility * Flare Stacks * Workforce accommodation Construction The partners and their engineering and construction contractors aim to open the LNG Canada project by 2025, barring engineering, construction, environmental or regulatory obstacles. The engineering and overall supervision of the construction of the project has been awarded to a joint venture of two large engineering companies, JGC of Japan and Fluor Corporation of the US, operating as JGC Fluor aka JFJV. The first phase of the project includes a $6.2-billion Coastal GasLink Pipeline through northern British Columbia, which will be built and operated by TC Energy (formerly TransCanada Corporation ). Coastal GasLink will be a 670-kilometre (420 mile) gas pipeline with an initial capacity of about 2.1 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/day) with the potential for expansion of up to approximately 5 Bcf/day. Construction activities are expected to begin in early 2019 with a planned in-service date in 2023. The pipeline project is backed by 25-year transportation service agreements between TC Energy and the LNG Canada partners. The second phase is the construction of an $18-billion gas liquefaction and storage plant in the port of Kitimat, B.C., with two liquefaction 'trains' where the natural gas will be cooled to reach its liquid state, then be stored waiting for ships to transport it to Asian markets. A new terminal for LNG carrier ships will be built at the port of Kitimat, B.C., connected to the LNG Canada liquefaction and storage plant. LNG carrier ships will sail up and down the Douglas Channel, to and from the port of Kitimat, to load LNG and sail to overseas destinations, mainly in Asia. Such ships may be owned and operated by some of the LNG Canada partners, or by their LNG purchasing clients, or they may be time-chartered from specialized independent ship owners and operators of such specialized ships. A potential controversy in connection with this large construction project is the level of customs duties that will be applied by Canada on any import of foreign manufactured steel modules, especially from China. Environmental impact As for any energy mining, transportation, storage and export project of this magnitude, there are numerous potential impacts, both on the atmosphere, on land and at sea, which have started to be debated both within Kitimat and British Columbia, as well as in Canada at large. The LNG project is set to be the largest point source of pollution in British Columbia, and, according to The Narwhal, the first phase of the project will emit four megatonnes of GHG emissions annually, equivalent to putting 856,531 cars on the road. The additional pollution is expected to make it much more difficult for British Columbia to meet its legislated targets for greenhouse gas reduction. Through a combination of energy efficient natural gas turbines and renewable electricity from BC Hydro, the project is expected to emit less than half the greenhouse gas emissions of the average LNG facility currently in operation worldwide, and is being called \\"best in class.\\" As reported by JWN Energy: \\"Canadian LNG operations will be well below the global emissions average of 0.26 to 0.35 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per tonne of LNG produced. LNG Canada, currently under construction at Kitimat, B.C., is being designed for 0.15 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per tonne per tonne of LNG.\\" LNG Canada received its Environmental Assessment Certificate in June 2015 following three years of community consultation and studies. LNG Canada is required to monitor and report the local effects of its activities over the life of the project.https://www.lngcanada.ca/uploads/subpages/downloads/EA-Summary- Report_SPg_PRESS_Final.pdf Economic impact The provincial government argues that the project will bring in C$23 billion in new government revenues. However, the LNG Canada project is the recipient of tax incentives. The British Columbian government, led by John Horgan, offered the project a break on the British Columbia carbon tax, as well as the provincial sales tax. The total subsidies for the project are valued at $5.35 billion. The subsidies extend beyond the natural gas plant itself, to new transmission lines that are being built by BC Hydro to service the gas fields where the gas will be extracted. These transmission lines have a cost of $296 million. The LNG project is slated to be a major recipient of electricity from the controversial Site C dam, which cost more than $10.7 billion to build and has experienced several cost overruns. LNG Canada has stated its commitment to a ‚Äúhire local first‚Äù approach and will work to ensure local residents have opportunities to become qualified to benefit from the B.C. LNG industry through training programs, direct employment, contracting and purchasing of goods and services from BC and Canadian companies. As of November 2019, $1 billion in contracts and procurement have gone to B.C. companies, more than half of which ‚Äî $558 million ‚Äî has gone to firms and First Nations in the immediate Kitimat region. A number of firms directly or indirectly working on the LNG Canada project have partnered with First Nations in the area, notably the Haisla Nation. These figures do NOT include the additional employment and business generated by the construction and operation of the Coastal GasLink project, which will deliver natural gas to the LNG facility.

From 1871 to 1888 she was a board member of the Danish Women's Society, serving as president from 1883 to 1887. Interested in allowing women to practise crafts and manual work traditionally reserved for men, on her death she left a legacy which among other things allowed two women to be the first in Denmark to qualify as carpenters. Biography Born on 11 November 1814 in Sengel√∏se to the west of Copenhagen, Marie Nicolina Theodora Schack was the daughter of Nicolai Clausen Schack (1781‚Äì1844), a provost, and Tagea Dorothea Erasmi (1785‚Äì1841). She was educated together with her sister Hansine at Miss Zeuthen's girls boarding school. In 1845, she married the school director Kristen Rovsing (1812‚Äì1889) although she continued to promote her maiden name including \\"f√∏dt Schack\\" (born Schack) when she referred to herself. Despite the disapproval of her husband, she became a board member of the Danish Women's Society (1871‚Äì88), serving as president from 1883 to 1887. She was a firm advocate of a women's business and vocational school and also fought for allowing women to be trained in occupations that had traditionally been reserved for men. In 1887, this led to her establishing a crafts committee which called for the establishment of a bookbinding school for women. She also provided support for the Kvindelig L√¶seforening (Women Readers' Association) and, by extension, to pioneering women academics, including the medical doctors Nielsine Nielsen and Marie Gleerup, and the historian Anna Hude, the first Danish woman to earn a Dr phil. Although the bookbinding school was never founded, on her death in 1888, Rovsing left a legacy for supporting women who wished to work as craftsmen. Known as Fru Marie Rovsing, f√∏dt Schacks Mindelegat for Kvinders haandv√¶rksm√¶ssige Uddannelse (Mrs Marie Rovsing born Schack's Legacy for Women's Training as Craftsmen), it was administered by the Women's Society. In particular, it provided support for the training of Cathrine Horsb√∏ll and Sophy Christensen as carpenters. Marie Rovsing died in Copenhagen on 25 September 1888 and was buried in Garnisons Cemetery. She was survived by her sisters Hansine Andr√¶ and Tagea Brandt, both of whom were also women's rights activists.

It is a Grade I listed building.  History  The church consists of a west tower of two stages, a four-bay aisled nave (with clerestory) entered through a south porch, and a three-bay chancel. The building material used throughout (except for the later south porch and aisle parapet, built of brick) is limestone in the form of cobble and ashlar. The earliest remains of previous churches on the site date to the 13th century, and are incorporated into the present structure. These include the arch between tower and nave, the eastern corners of the nave, and the western portion of the chancel. Above the tower arch is an asymmetrically set blocked doorway. But the majority of the work is from a rebuilding which occurred during the first half of the 14th century, i.e. entirely during the Decorated period, when aisles and a clerestory were added to the nave and the chancel was extended eastward. The tower was rebuilt during the 15th century, and the south porch during the 18th making use of the original south door. Architecture = Exterior = The windows of the nave all feature typical early- to mid-14th century tracery. The forms of these windows are varied, some pointed, some segment-headed, several (three of the four aisle end windows) square-headed: the masons of the East Riding during this time commonly employed square-headed windows, adapting Decorated tracery motifs for use in them (see St Helen‚Äôs Church, Skipwith, the foremost example). Buttresses are used between bays and at the angles. There is an elaborate projection below a window on the south aisle wall; this is only explained when one goes inside the building (see below). The nave clerestory has three windows on each side, of two lights with cusped Y-tracery. The original nave gable can be traced below the 14th-century gable, which carries a cross, as does the chancel gable. The western portions of the chancel walls are of the 13th century, with an original lancet window on the north side, and on the south side a window of two trefoiled lights with an unencircled quatrefoil above. The rest of the chancel is of the 14th-century extension. This part has two large pointed three-light windows on each side, all with graceful flowing tracery of the same pattern. The southeast window was later altered very lopsidedly to include a fourth light. Below the southwest window is a blocked doorway. The fine east window of five lights with subdivided reticulations can be dated to 1358 by a will bequeathing money for its construction. Short buttresses reaching only to mid-window level are employed at the eastern corners of the chancel and between the windows. The tower, rebuilt in the Perpendicular style of the 15th century, is of two stages with angle buttresses. It has a square-headed lower west window of two lights with three- centred heads, and pointed belfry openings with uncusped Y-tracery. The south porch has a beautiful 14th-century doorway with continuous mouldings under an ornate niche with a figure of the Virgin and Child, all left over from the original two-story porch and all reset within 18th-century brick. Simple coped parapets occur on all the walls of the building. = Interior = Inside are four-bay Decorated arcades with octagonal piers and double-chamfered arches. The five-bay oak screen is Perpendicular, restored by John Bilson in 1906. The font is of the same period, with an 18th-century cover. The pulpit is dated 1618. On the clerestory walls are remains of post-Reformation wall paintings. For stained glass, Pevsner mentions only the east window of 1877, attributed to Clayton & Bell, and calls it ‚Äògood‚Äô. The most outstanding feature of the interior is the tomb in the south aisle, much mutilated by being reset into the wall. Indeed one side is now exposed on the exterior wall of the church. Dating to , it commemorates a priest, thought to be either William de la Mare, Provost of Beverley or his brother Thomas, vicar of Welwick. It is of the highest quality and enriched with flowing tracery, foliate carving, figures of saints and angels, the symbols of the Evangelists and the Passion, and heraldry. Under an ogee canopy with a ribbed vault lies the effigy of a priest in mass vestments. Pevsner attributes the monument to one of the carvers of the Percy tomb in Beverley Minster, and assigns the south doorway with its sculpture (described above) to the same Beverley workshop which produced these tombs. The Beverley workshop supplied numerous sculptures and monuments to churches throughout the region. As an example, see the statue of the Virgin in St Patrick's Church, Patrington.

The tournament gives young Muslim high school students a chance to showcase their talents and creative abilities in various competitions, including non- religious competitions like short film, mobile app development and poetry to more Islam-centric competitions such as a religious knowledge test and memorization of the Quran.  Overview  There are two levels of MIST competitions: regional (qualifiers) and national. As of 2019, regional MIST tournaments either occur over a single weekend or are divided into three days over two weekends. For regional tournaments taking place over two weekends, Saturday and Sunday are reserved for competitions, and an awards ceremony takes place on the following Sunday. For regional tournaments taking place over a single weekend, competitions take place Saturday and Sunday while the awards ceremony takes place on the same Sunday. Trophies and medals are given to the top three places of various competitions, qualifying them for the national tournament held in the summer. The national MIST tournament, however, takes place over three consecutive days on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. The awards ceremony takes place on the same Sunday evening.

The field first became identifiable in the early 21st century. Object detection for a stop sign. The components of information engineering include more theoretical fields such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, control theory, signal processing, and information theory, and more applied fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, bioinformatics, medical image computing, cheminformatics, autonomous robotics, mobile robotics, and telecommunications. Many of these originate from computer science, as well as other branches of engineering such as computer engineering, electrical engineering, and bioengineering. clustering in machine learning. The field of information engineering is based heavily on mathematics, particularly probability, statistics, calculus, linear algebra, optimization, differential equations, variational calculus, and complex analysis. Information engineers often hold a degree in information engineering or a related area, and are often part of a professional body such as the Institution of Engineering and Technology or Institute of Measurement and Control. They are employed in almost all industries due to the widespread use of information engineering. History The term information engineering used to refer to a software engineering methodology that is now more commonly known as information technology engineering or information engineering methodology. It began to gain its current meaning early on in the 21st century. Elements =Machine learning and statistics= Machine learning is the field that involves the use of statistical and probabilistic methods to let computers \\"learn\\" from data without being explicitly programmed. Data science involves the application of machine learning to extract knowledge from data. Subfields of machine learning include deep learning, supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, semi-supervised learning, and active learning. Causal inference is another related component of information engineering. =Control theory= Control theory refers to the control of (continuous) dynamical systems, with the aim being to avoid delays, overshoots, or instability. Information engineers tend to focus more on control theory rather than the physical design of control systems and circuits (which tends to fall under electrical engineering). Subfields of control theory include classical control, optimal control, and nonlinear control. =Signal processing= Signal processing refers to the generation, analysis and use of signals, which could take many forms such as image, sound, electrical, or biological. 2D Fourier transform can be used to remove unwanted information from an X-ray scan. =Information theory= Information theory studies the analysis, transmission, and storage of information. Major subfields of information theory include coding and data compression. =Computer vision= Computer vision is the field that deals with getting computers to understand image and video data at a high level. =Natural language processing= Natural language processing deals with getting computers to understand human (natural) languages at a high level. This usually means text, but also often includes speech processing and recognition. =Bioinformatics= Bioinformatics is the field that deals with the analysis, processing, and use of biological data. This usually means topics such as genomics and proteomics, and sometimes also includes medical image computing. =Cheminformatics= Cheminformatics is the field that deals with the analysis, processing, and use of chemical data. =Robotics= Robotics in information engineering focuses mainly on the algorithms and computer programs used to control robots. As such, information engineering tends to focus more on autonomous, mobile, or probabilistic robots. Major subfields studied by information engineers include control, perception, SLAM, and motion planning. Tools In the past some areas in information engineering such as signal processing used analog electronics, but nowadays most information engineering is done with digital computers. Many tasks in information engineering can be parallelized, and so nowadays information engineering is carried out using CPUs, GPUs, and AI accelerators. There has also been interest in using quantum computers for some subfields of information engineering such as machine learning and robotics.

The treaty is registered by the United States to the United Nations on 20 December 1957. The official texts are in English and Persian. It is sealed by plenipotentiaries Selden Chapin (U.S.) and Mostafa Samiy (Iran).  Background  After the 1953 Coup in Iran, the United States and Iran began negotiations on a treaty of amity between them. This treaty was completed in 1955 and signed by Dwight Eisenhower and Hossein Ala. During the Iran hostage crisis following the Iranian Revolution, the United States imposed sanctions on Iran that were in violation of Article 1 of the treaty, but Iran did not invoke the treaty. The United States would eventually invoke the treaty stating that Iran violated Article 2, Clause 4 of the treaty, which provides for the protection for citizens of either country. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled in the favor of the United States. During the aftermath of shooting down of Iran Air Flight 655 Iran sued the United States in the ICJ, with the case being settled out of court. In 1992, in response to Operation Nimble Archer, Iran would again take the United States to court. In this case the ICJ would rule that while the attacks on Iran were not justified, the United States was not in violation of the treaty.  Terms  Article 1 simply states: \\"There shall be firm and enduring peace and sincere friendship between the United States of America and Iran.\\" Article 2 provides for the protection and freedom of travel for citizens of either nation when visiting the other. Article 3 provides for the recognition and access to the court systems for corporations within either territory. Article 4 establishes for the protection of property for nationals and corporations of either nation. Article 5 establishes that nationals and corporations may purchase or lease property within either territory. Article 6 establishes rules for taxation, including that nationals and corporations shall pay taxes, and that a scheme will be established to avoid double taxation. Article 7 states that neither nation will apply monetary restrictions on each other except as needed \\"to assure the availability of foreign exchange for payments for goods and services essential to the health and welfare of its people\\" or as approved by the International Monetary Fund. Article 8 establishes rules for the import and export of products between both nations. Article 9 continues this with further rules for the import and export of products between the nations. Article 10 establishes freedom of commerce and navigation between both nations. Article 11 states that corporations acting within either territory shall not be discriminated against during government contract based on their country of origin. Articles 12, 13, and 14 allow for the exchange of diplomats between the nations and the fair treatment of those diplomats. Article 15 allows each government to purchase or lease land within the other's borders as needed for any purpose other than the military. Articles 16 and 17 outlines that diplomats shall not be subjected to taxation, unless they are or have been a citizen of both nations. Article 18 outlines diplomatic immunity. Article 19 discusses the rights of nationals to visit their consulate. Article 20 outlines areas where the treaty does not apply. Article 21 states that any disputes shall be subject to the rulings of the International Court of Justice. Article 22 names the previous treaties that this treaty is meant to replace. Article 23 gives a timeline for ratification of the treaty and allows for its cancellation by either party after 10 years \\"by giving one year's written notice\\". Termination In May 2018 The United States withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action leading to sanctions being placed on Iran. On 3 October 2018, following an earlier ruling that day by the International Court of Justice that the US had violated the treaty by imposing sanctions on Iran, United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that the United States \\"is terminating\\" the treaty. Mike Pompeo has said that the decision to end the treaty \\"is 39 years overdue\\". In response foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif called the Trump administration an \\"outlaw regime\\" and Supreme Leader of Iran Ali Khamenei stated \\"America must receive another slap from the people of Iran with the defeat of sanctions\\".

He was educated at All Saints School and began singing at a young age ‚Äì touring the local working men's clubs alongside his brother. In 1959, he was signed onto Embassy Records as a backing vocalist. Having worked as a backing vocalist, Mike recorded his first single for Embassy in 1962 alongside Ray Pilgrim, and recorded a further 28 singles on the Embassy label in this period. During the sixties he was asked to understudy Frank Sinatra on a Tony Hatch produced record, which was never released commercially. In 1967 Mike was approached by Burt Bacharach to perform the vocal on the song Have No Fear, James Bond is Here - which was used for the credit-roll of the 1967 spoof film Casino Royale. He also achieved No. 1 chart success in Germany with the single Du Kannst Nicht Immer Siebszehn (\\"You can't always be seventeen\\") which he co-wrote with Ralph Siegel, and which was sung by Chris Roberts. He also produced Terry Wogan's hit The Floral Dance, which reached No. 21 in April 1978. Mike has also represented the United Kingdom at the Eurovision Song Contest on two occasions. In 1975 he co-penned the song The House Runs On Sunshine with Brian Bennett for The Shadows. At the Song For Europe final held on 15 February the song finished third. Ten years later he again represented the UK with his own entry So Do I with Fiona Kennedy, however the song finished joint last in the national final. Mike also composed the music to the children's television show Charlie Chalk, which was produced by Woodland Animation and featured the voice of Michael Williams. The theme music to the show, which was penned by Redway was performed by his close friend Ken Barrie, whom he had met at Embassy in the early sixties.

History The origins of the 7.7 cm FlaK L/35 go back to the French Canon de 75 mod√®le 1897 field gun which was captured in large numbers during the first two years of World War I. A combination of factors led the Germans to issue M1897's to their troops as replacements. These included: * An underestimation of light field artillery losses during the first two years of the war and an inadequate number of replacement guns being produced. * An underestimation of ammunition consumption, inadequate production capacity, and resulting shortages. * The superior ballistic performance of the M1897 compared to German designs. Once adequate numbers of new field guns such as the 7.7 cm FK 16 were being produced obsolete types such as the 9 cm Kanone C/73 and captured guns such as the M1897 and 76 mm divisional gun M1902 were withdrawn from front-line service and issued to anti-aircraft units. At first, all of the combatants employed field guns on improvised anti-aircraft mounts, which were typically earthen embankments or scaffolds to get the muzzle pointed skyward. Later in the war, specialized anti-aircraft mounts were developed. Design The 7.7 cm Flak L/35 was a conversion of captured M1897's that were bored out to fire German 7.7 cm ammunition and placed on high angle mounts for the anti-aircraft role. When the barrels became worn out they were replaced with German made ones of the same length without the distinctive muzzle roller guides of the French gun. The first of these conversions were from Krupp. It consisted of mounting bored out barrels on modified de Bange 120 or 155 carriages to allow up to 60¬∞ of elevation. In the field, the guns were anchored to a firing ring to allow 360¬∞ of traverse. By Spring of 1916, every division had a two gun platoon for AA defense and 394 guns were converted.

It has been given the common name dwarf jelly palm in English. Local common names which have been recorded for this species are coqueirinho-do-campo, butiazinho and vassourinha. Taxonomy Sidney Fredrick Glassman first described this species in 1967 from a specimen collected by William Andrew Archer (no. 4048) in Minas Gerais. Glassman named the new species after the collector. Initially he considered it a type of Syagrus, because it had unarmed petioles. Among the many characters Odoardo Beccari used to distinguish the genus Butia from Syagrus in 1916, Glassman considered the most important to be the three seeds or locules in fruit, the presence of spines along the margins of the petiole, and the smooth rather than plicate spathes. Because Glassman had classified Butia archeri as a Syagrus, and this new taxon had smooth spathes and fruit with up to three seeds (along with a few other rare taxa at the time classified as Syagrus but at present Butia), he decided the genus Butia was indistinguishable from Syagrus, and in 1970 moved all Butia species to Syagrus. In 1979 Glassman changed his mind after looking at the anatomy of the cross-section of the pinnae (leaflets) and reclassified it as a Butia. Infraspecific diversity *Butia archeri var. archeri - Native to Goi√°s, Bras√≠lia, Minas Gerais. Glaucous leaves. *Butia archeri var. diamantinensis K. Soares [2015]  Native to the area around the town of Diamantina, Minas Gerais. Green leaves, wide pinnae clustered close together on the rachis, a leaf forming an almost spherical canopy. Description This is a solitary- trunked palm, with the trunk usually growing to maximally 1.3m in height and 10-21cm in diameter. It may be acaulescent sometimes, which means the trunk is very short and hidden underground. The 5 to 20 leaves are highly recurved. The leaf has a 5-18cm sheathing leaf base, an unarmed petiole 2-15cm long, a rachis 50‚Äì80cm long, and possessing 26-44 pinnae. The leaves are coloured glaucous (greyish) or green, depending on the variety. The pinnae are 25-40cm long and 1.3-2cm wide. The pinnae are inserted at a single plane on both sides of the rachis, such that a pair of pinnae form a 'V'-shape. In the nominate form the pinnae are arranged regularly down the length of the entire rachis. The developing inflorescence is protected in a woody spathe 30‚Äì80cm in length; the outside of the spathe is hairless and rarely somewhat scaly (lepidote or squamulate) and the swollen part of the spathe is 30-39cm long and 1.3-8cm wide. The inflorescence is branched to a single order, with 15-35 rachillae (branches) 7-20cm long. It is monoecious. The flowers are generally purplish. The staminate (male) flowers are 8-10mm long. The pistillate (female) flowers are 5‚Äì8mm in length. The shape of the 1.6-2cm x 1.5-1.7cm fruit is an elongated ellipsoid, yellowish-green to purplish-green in colour at maturity, and with yellow flesh which tastes sweet and sour. The 1-1.2cm x 0.9-1.1cm nut has an ovoid shape containing 1-3 seeds. =Similar species= According to Glassman in 1979, this taxon can easily be distinguished from other acaulescent species of Butia, such as B. arenicola and (sometimes) B. paraguayensis, by its petiole margins lacking teeth, and from B. microspadix, which also lacks teeth, by the hairless spathes, which are covered in dark brown hairs in B. microspadix. Distribution It is endemic to Brazil, being native to the states of Goi√°s, Bras√≠lia, Minas Gerais and S√£o Paulo in Brazil. The population is largely split in three large populations from east to west in regions of higher elevations, split by regions of lower elevations in the major river valleys. The spatial distribution of individuals is usually as small groups clustered together; one rarely encounters lone individuals. Habitat It grows in rocky fields in highlands, in the cerrado ecoregion, where it can locally be very abundant. Ecology In its native habitat it flowers from May to December and fruits from July to February. It is found in 50cm high grasses together with the palm species Syagrus comosa, S. flexuosa, S. petraea, Allagoptera campestris (somewhat rarely), and A. leucocalyx in Fazenda √Ågua Limpa in the Federal District. This area has an elevation of 1,100m and an annual rainfall of 1,600mm, a dry season in the winter from July to September, in latosol soil with a relatively high amount of aluminium oxides. The seeds are usually preyed upon by insects and small rodents. Horticulture Seeds germinate with difficulty (48% abortion rate according to a 2009 study). It grows quite slowly.

After he was wounded in battle and taken prisoner by the Germans he was sent to a prisoner-of-war camp in Nazi-occupied Poland, but he later escaped from the camp and helped organize a partisan detachment of the communist underground Gwardia Ludowa.  Early life  Adamanov was born in 1916 to a Crimean Tatar peasant family in the village of Vasilyevka, Crimea. His father was declared a kulak in 1929 and deported to the Urals, where he soon died of typhus. After the loss of his father his mother was left to raise Umer and his younger sister Khadija by herself. Umer went on to work at a state farm. Upon the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 Adamanov was drafted into the Red Army and forced to leave his wife Vera and infant son Shevket.  World War II  = Red Army service = While in the Red Army he served in the 97th Rifle Regiment of the 18th Rifle Division. During the fighting in Orsha in winter 1941 he was wounded in battle and taken captive by the Germans, after which he was sent to a POW camp in Czestochowa, Poland. = Partisan activities = When he escaped the camp in 1942 he joined helped organize a partisan detachment with the support of Major-General Sergei Ogurtsov and Vasily \\"the Georgian\\" Mandzhavidze. Starting in the middle of summer 1942, the detachment took on the name Grigory Kotovsky in honor of the Soviet General and began operations in Puszcza Solska under the commander of Ogurtsov. After Ogurstov was killed in action during fighting in the village of Zielone, Adamonov took command of the detachment, which soon became part of the Tadeusz Ko≈õciuszko Task force of the Gwardia Ludowa. His role as a partisan earned him the nickname \\"Miszka Tatar\\", which later became legend in the Polish Workers Party. In the Spring of 1943 the Nazis forces in Poland offered a reward of 100,000 zlotys for the capture or death of Adamanov. From March to June 1943, the detachment led by Adamanov conducted a multiple successful sabotage missions, resulting in the destruction of 12 tanks and 2 aircraft, in addition to trains transporting military supplies. On 24 April, several members of the detachment managed to escape from enemy encirclement and went towards the rear of enemy lines, after which they killed 7 German soldiers and seized German weapons and ammunition. Just a few days later on 1 May, the guerrillas attacked a sawmill in Tereszpol; after killing the building comandant they stole ammunition being stored in the building before burning it. The partisans pursued the remaining guards of the sawmill who fled, and on 16 May the rest of the German sawmill guards were killed by the partisans in D≈Çugi KƒÖt and Krasnobr√≥d. Three days later they mined the railway tracks near Zwierzyniec in the section between Rejowiec and Rava-Ruska, resulting in the derailment of an enemy train. 2006 photograph of the cemetery in Hamernia, J√≥zef√≥w where Adamanov is buried.  Last stand  The command of the detachment learned of the arrival of an armored train of SS men in the village of Jozef√≥w on 1 June 1943. The SS men began raiding a local church and massacring local villagers as part of the genocide of Polish people. A group of 50 partisans under the command of Adamanov attacked the enemy garrison, despite the numerical superiority of the enemy's forces, and began pushing the Germans back towards the railway. Adamanov fought advanced in the battle with the use of a light machine gun, but was killed by a German sniper after he stood up and went into attack after injuring his left hand. After his death he was posthumously awarded the Order of the Cross of Grunwald 3rd class and promoted to the rank of captain. Despite fighting to the death against the Nazis, Adamanov's entire family in Crimea was deported to Central Asia because of their Crimean Tatar ethnicity, where many of them died of malaria and starvation.

Identification and memorialization  After the end of World War II, numerous articles in the Polish and Russian press speculated about the identity of the partisan with the pseudonym \\"Miszka-Tatar\\". Wojciech Sulevsky, a Polish writer, and Mikhail Sergeyev, a journalist from Kazan, were tasked with identifying the partisan. People speculated to the unidentified partisan included Mikhail Atamanov from Yelabuga. Later, historian and retired colonel Nikolai Prokopyuk concluded in an article published in Krasnaya Zvezda that \\"Miszka-Tatar\\" was Umer Akmolla Adamanov, based on examination by the Central Research Institute of Forensic Examination of pre-war photographs and photos of the partisan. In 1990, after five rounds of analysis, Mikhail Sergeyev stated Polish and Soviet historians agreed that \\"Miszka-Tatar\\" was Umer Adamanov. Streets in both Poland and Crimea are named in his honor, and Adamanov remains commemorated as a war hero in both Poland and Crimea.

The book is set in a world loosely inspired by 19th century Europe. Crooked Kingdom takes place days after the events of the first book, Six of Crows, finishes. The plot is told from the close third-person viewpoints of six different characters, plus a first and last chapter from two minor characters' points of view. Crooked Kingdom is the sequel to Six of Crows; the two comprise a duology. Bardugo's Shadow and Bone trilogy, Nikolai Duology, and a standalone collection of stories (The Language of Thorns) are set in the same universe, affectionately named the Grishaverse by the fanbase.  Plot  In the prologue, a Grisha man named Emil Retvenko is kidnapped by a winged Shu man. The book commences in a gambling parlor known as Club Cumulus where Jesper and Nina keep Jan Van Eck's lawyer, Cornelis Smeet, busy while Kaz and Wylan search his office for Jan Van Eck's property information. After they find what they need, Kaz plans to kidnap Van Eck‚Äôs pregnant young wife, Alys, and trade her for Inej, who is being held captive and is nearly tortured. Meanwhile, Jesper‚Äôs father, Colm, arrives at the city to meet him, as the bank is pushing the deadline for the debt Jesper owes. When Jesper goes to meet with his father, they are attacked but manage to escape. Kaz tells Jesper's father to give them three days to get the money and asks him to wait in a fancy hotel in the city. Afterward, the crew's kidnapping is successful, and they trade Van Eck's wife for Inej. However, during the trade, three Shu soldiers with superhuman abilities attack Nina, Jesper, and other Grisha in the surrounding area. They all manage to get away after Nina shoots one of them point-blank in the eye, and Wylan sets another on fire. The crew meets at their hideout, and Kaz reveals his plan to sabotage Van Eck‚Äôs sugar silos using a chemical weevil (cleverly nicknamed the Wyvil by Jesper). Doing so will raise the price of sugar, and Kaz had already bought shares in other sugar companies. Nina and Inej persuade Kaz to smuggle out the remaining Grisha in the city using one of Van Eck‚Äôs own ships. While Kaz and Wylan attempt to steal the seal they need from the Van Eck house, Nina and Inej infiltrate the sugar silos. However, all of them are attacked, and it is revealed that Pekka Rollins is in league with Van Eck. Pekka also attacks the hideout Kaz was using to hide Kuwei, where Jesper and Matthias were guarding him. They all escape and meet at the hotel where Jesper's father is staying in. Nina shows the group her strange and creepy new abilities to control dead bodies, guessing that it might be a result of her surviving the jurda parem withdrawal. Kaz puts together another plan and declares an auction for the indenture of Kuwei, which causes everyone to think him more insane than usual. In the auction, Kaz disguises the Grisha from the embassy as the Council of Tides. They claim that the auction is biased because Van Eck gave money to the Shu people. The money was, in fact, channeled to the Crows themselves by scamming the Merchant Council. Van Eck is arrested. They manage to fake Kuwei's death and smuggle him out. Amidst the job, Matthias is shot, and later he dies. Kaz bluffs Pekka into believing that he has his son buried alive. He then leaves the city in search for his son. With Van Eck gone, Wylan inherits the properties of his family. In the end, Kaz finds Inej's parents, is threatened by the real Council of Tides, and Inej threatens Pekka out of his business.  Characters  * Kaz Brekker, a master thief and lock pick with a reputation for doing anything for the right price. He is also known as Dirtyhands. He is described as always wearing black leather gloves and carrying a cane with a crow's head on it. He is a leader of the Dregs. * Inej Ghafa, a Suli acrobat who has a talent for sneaking around. She was kidnapped and forced to work in a brothel known as the \\"Menagerie\\" until Kaz bought her contract. She is also known as the Wraith. * Wylan van Eck, a merchant's son with some talent for demolition, who Kaz takes on as a hostage in hopes of using him as leverage against Jan Van Eck. He is unable to read due to severe dyslexia. * Matthias Helvar, a former Dr√ºskelle (witchhunter from Fjerda). He has a history with Nina, as the two of them helped each other after a storm destroyed their ship. They trusted each other, until Nina accused him of being a slaver, leading to his incarceration at Hellgate. He hates Nina for her betrayal and for his initial prejudice against Grisha, but he also loves her. Kaz frees Matthias from Hellgate Prison in Six of Crows because of his knowledge of the Ice Court as well as for his skills as a soldier. * Nina Zenik, a powerful Heartrender who worked in a brothel named \\"White Rose\\". She was a soldier of the Ravkan Second Army who was captured by Fjerdan Dr√ºskelle, leading to her first encounter with Matthias. She betrayed his trust to protect him from Grisha spies, choosing to stay in Ketterdam in the hopes of finding a way to free him from prison. She was initially recruited by Pekka Rollins to join the Dime Lions, but after meeting Inej, who brought a counteroffer from Kaz, she decided to join the Dregs instead. After the events of Six of Crows, her Grisha power shifted from the ability to manipulate the human body to the ability to communicate with and control the dead. * Jesper Fahey, a dark-skinned Zemeni sharpshooter with a gambling problem. He is described as being tall and lanky, with an intense facial bone structure. He is a Fabrikator as well, although he hides this ability. His father believes that he is studying in a university at Ketterdam. * Jan Van Eck, a rich and prominent merchant who sits on Ketterdam's Merchant Council. He makes a deal with Kaz Brekker to retrieve the creator of jurda parem from the Ice Court. He is also Wylan Van Eck's father. *Kuwei Yul-Bo, the son of Bo Yul-Bayur, the creator of jurda parem.

He is the rich owner of a successful casino in Ketterdam and is always up to no good in one way or the other. *Zoya Nazyalensky, a Squaller and a member of the Grisha Triumvirate. She was one of Nina's commanding officers in Ravka's Second Army, but ultimately worked with the Dregs to try and save Kuwei and a myriad of Grisha refugees. *Genya Safin, a Tailor, a member of the Grisha Triumvirate, and one of Nina's teachers back in Ravka. Unlike Zoya, she is playful and teasing, and cares very much for Nina. *Sturmhond, AKA Nikolai Lantsov, the young King of Ravka who poses as a privateer from the very same country. He is teasing and quite flirtatious, while also looking for money to pay off Ravka's debt after their disastrous civil war.

After the German reunification in 1990, he went to Boston in the United States and trained their national women's team from 1991 until 2000. From 2006 until 2008, he was the chief coach for the Chinese national women's team. At the 2008 Olympics, he agreed to return to Germany to be the chief coach of their national team. He resigned as German coach at the end of 2012 and was succeeded by Marcus Schwarzrock. In 1988, he was awarded a Banner of Labor (2nd Class) by the East German government for his coaching work at SC Dynamo Berlin. Under Buschbacher's guidance, Kathrin Haacker and Judith Zeidler won gold in the coxless pair at the 1989 World Rowing Championships; it was the first East German win in this boat class since 1983. In the following year, Buschbacher coached the women's coxless four and whilst they were the clear favourite at the 1990 World Rowing Championships, they only won silver.

Around 250 years old, it was the second largest wild pear tree in the country and a noted local landmark. In 2015 the tree was voted England's Tree of the Year. A Parliamentary petition was launched in September 2020 to save the tree from being cut down for HS2 and a month later had over 20,000 signatures triggering an official government response. It was felled as part of the High Speed 2 railway development on 20 October 2020.  Description  The Cubbington Pear Tree was identified as a specimen of Pyrus communis var. communis, and is listed as such in the Champion Tree Register. It is located on the top of a hill near to South Cubbington Wood, Cubbington. The tree sat on private land but near to a public footpath from which it was visible. Thought to be around 250 years old, the Cubbington Pear Tree may have been the United Kingdom's oldest wild pear tree. The tree was the second largest wild pear tree in the country, measuring some in girth. Despite its age the tree continued to blossom and bear fruit until the end of its life. The tree was entered onto the Tree Register of the British Isle as a national champion (the oldest or largest known specimen of a particular species).  HS2  In 2011 the Cubbington Pear Tree was identified as under threat from the proposed High Speed 2 (HS2) Phase 1 railway line between London and Birmingham, becoming one of 20 pear trees to be threatened by the scheme. An expert from Warwickshire Museum visited the site to record and assess the tree. Representatives from HS2 said that the tree cannot be relocated as the lower trunk is hollow. They instead proposed to take cuttings from the tree and plant seedlings from it nearby as a replacement. The tree trunk was to be placed in the South Cubbington Wood to form a habitat for insects, fungi and plants. The removal of the tree was opposed by the Cubbington Action Group who instead proposed that this section of the line be tunnelled beneath the tree. A petition in support of this proposal was sent to the HS2 Parliamentary select committee, but the scheme was rejected on economic grounds, with an estimated cost of ¬£46 million. In preparation for its removal the Shuttleworth College successfully took cuttings from the Cubbington Pear Tree by September 2017. The Cubbington Action Group led a series of walks to view the tree in April and May 2018 to see it in bloom for the \\"last time\\". Preliminary works for HS2 in this area had commenced by May 2018. In October 2019, local residents set up a protest encampment in South Cubbington Wood to protect the Cubbington Pear Tree and other nearby woodland. A parliamentary petition was launched in September 2020 and received 20,000 signatures of support. A formal response from the Department for Transport stated \\"HS2 Ltd explored all possible options to avoid removing the tree, but due to its age and condition, removal cannot be avoided\\" and that 40 new trees had been grown from cuttings from the pear, to be grown locally. They also stated that the stump and roots of the tree would be relocated to allow it an opportunity to regrow. The tree was cut down on 20 October 2020.  Tree of the Year  The Cubbington Pear Tree was entered into the English Tree of the Year competition in 2015 along with more than 200 others. It was selected by the competition's panel of experts for the 10-strong shortlist for the public vote. It won the competition having garnered more than 10,000 votes and beating famous trees such as the Ankerwycke Yew, the Boscobel Oak and the Glastonbury Thorn. It was subsequently described by the Warwickshire Wildlife Trust as the \\"poster-boy for all the trees along the route of HS2 ... that are under threat from the project\\". The tree was subsequently entered into the 2016 European Tree of the Year competition where it came 8th out of 15 entries with 7,858 votes.

Biography  Born in 1869 in a peasant family. He studied at a two-year folk school and showed such abilities there that teachers strongly advised and helped his mother arrange Ivan at the Chukhloma city school, and then he studied at the Kostroma gymnasium for a Susanin scholarship (1881‚Äì1889). After graduating from high school with a gold medal, he entered the law faculty of Moscow University. Under the leadership of professor I. I. Yanzhula engaged in economic sciences. After graduating from Moscow University with a diploma of the 1st degree, he was appointed in November 1893 as a junior candidate for judicial positions in the Moscow Court of Justice and from January 1894 left at the Department of Financial Law to prepare for a professorship. From March 1895 ‚Äì privat-docent of Moscow University. In January 1896 he was sent on a scientific mission to Europe. In (Germany), England, France and Switzerland, he collected materials about the features of the development of tax systems and the basic principles of financial law, customs policy, the relationship of entrepreneurs and wage workers, the evolution of cooperation and so on. In 1898 he received a master's degree for his thesis \\"Income tax in England and the economic and social conditions of its existence\\". In February 1900 he defended his doctoral thesis \\"The main trends in the development of direct taxation in Germany in connection with economic and social conditions\\" and was appointed first extraordinary (1901), and since March 1903 ‚Äì ordinary professor of the department of financial law of Moscow University. In the 1900s I. Kh. Ozerov won the reputation of one of the most respected Russian scholarlys ‚Äì economists. Thanks to his lectures, Ozerov enjoyed the same respect and sympathy among the students of Moscow University (among his students and friends were the poets M. A. Voloshin and L. L. Kobylinsky). Ozerov had the idea of creating a Student Bank in Moscow to issue loans for education with the condition of repaying them after the end of the course, growing to its cliff: economic life waves are currently rising high, and it is necessary that a person know how to break away from cliffs in time, change places, adapt to new conditions, and here the state has major tasks ‚Äì this is why the task of expanding the horizons of the population, the task public education plays a major role in the present\\". Ozerov was not a desk scientist, but a practical scientist, enthusiastic and tireless enlightener. \\"I, as the son of the working people, wanted to be useful, and, being raised at the expense of the people, climbing up through his shoulders, I wanted to be useful in spreading knowledge among him and awakening in him energy and creativity in economic life\\", ‚Äì he wrote. In 1901, he took part in the activities of the Moscow Society of Mutual Assistance of Mechanical Production Workers, created on the initiative of S. V. Zubatov. He organized popular lectures for workers in the Historical Museum in Moscow and drafted a charter for the Society. When it became known that the security department was involved in the creation of society, Ozerov did not give up lectures and convened something like an arbitration court of public figures, who found the lecturers useful. He told about his participation in the activities of the Company in detail in the book \\"Policy on the Work Issue in Russia over the past years\\". In the summer of 1907, Ozerov was transferred to St. Petersburg University, while remaining at the same time a lecturer at Moscow University ‚Äì was a private assistant professor at the faculty of law. He also taught at the Bestuzhev women's courses and at the highest women's courses of N. P. Raev in St. Petersburg, as well as at the Pedagogical Academy. In July 1911, he was again appointed an ordinary professor at Moscow University and headed the department of financial law until April 1917. At the same time, he was from October 1912 a supernumerary ordinary professor at the Moscow Commercial Institute, taught finance and a history of economic life and economics at the A. L. Shanyavsky Moscow city National University. Since 1914 ‚Äì member of the legal test committee at Moscow University. Since 1909 ‚Äì elected member of the State Council of the Academy of Sciences and universities. I. Kh. Ozerov spoke in many cities of Russia with public lectures. He took part in the work of various government commissions of the Ministry of Finance, trade and industry. With research and development goals going around Russia, getting acquainted with real production and banking activities, Ozerov gave entrepreneurs, engineers and accountants a wide variety of vital advice: \\"I saw that there was something to attach to the head torso or tail\\": so, he recommended that he buy a forest area in a paper mill so as not to depend on wood prices; cement plant ‚Äì to build a driveway to use cheap Moscow region coals; Moscow Mayor ‚Äì to use the coal burned in the mines near Moscow to light and heat the city. From January 1, 1914 ‚Äì State Councilor; he was awarded the Order of St. Anne of the 2nd degree (1909) and the Order of St. Vladimir of the 4th degree (1912).Vipper Oskar Yurievich // List of civilian grade four. Corrected on March 1, 1915 ‚Äì Pg., 1915. ‚Äì p. 3073. In April 1917 he resigned from Moscow University. After the revolutionary year of 1917, the Ozerov, unlike many Russian bankers and entrepreneurs, did not follow in emigration and stayed in Russia, where he continued his scientific activities, in particular, he developed the concept of creating an agricultural bank, studied the financial problems of domestic and foreign trade, and studied the scientific organization of labor. In 1918, I. Kh. Ozerov became the economic adviser to Hetman Skoropadsky in Ukraine. In 1919 he returned to Moscow. Lectured at the Industrial Institute. He served at the Institute for Environmental Research (since 1919), collaborated with the Financial and Economic Institute of the People's Commissariat of Finance. He taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences of Moscow State University (1920/1921); taught the course \\"Introduction to Financial Science\\". Cooperating with the Economist magazine of the industrial and economic department of the Russian Technical Society, he proposed effective, in his view, ways to get the country out of the chaos. In 1919‚Äì1921 he taught at the MFEU, taught the course \\"Fundamentals of Financial Science\\".Finance Academy under the Government of the Russian Federation: history and modernity.

In 1922, the possibility of expelling Ozerov on a \\"philosophical ships\\" was considered, but in the end the scientist was recognized as not dangerous. In 1927 he retired. He was arrested on January 28, 1930 and sentenced to capital punishment with the replacement of 10 years in prison. The whole of 1930 was in the Butyrka prison, then he served his sentence on Solovki and on the White Sea-Baltic Canal. In 1933, he was amnestied and he went to Voronezh, where his wife was exile. By a decree of the Central Executive Committee of the USSR of June 19, 1935, his conviction was lifted and in 1936 he and his wife were settled in the Nursing House of Scientists in Leningrad. There Ozerov and died during the blockade of Leningrad; He was buried at Piskaryovsky cemetery. In St. Petersburg, in the Department of Manuscripts of the Public Library there are unpublished memories of Ozerov (F.541.Op.1.D..4). According to the conclusion of the USSR Prosecutor's office of January 21, 1991, it was fully rehabilitated.  Economic views  At the beginning of the 20th century, I. Kh. Ozerov became famous for his numerous works on the modernization of the socio-economic and state system of Russia. Ozerov left behind more than 50 books, dozens of articles. Ozerov was the author of the first and only before the revolution textbook \\"Fundamentals of Financial Science\\", which withstood five reprints. He is the author of the book \\"On the New Way. To the economic liberation of Russia, \\"\\" What does America teach us? \\",\\" The society of consumers. Historical sketch of their development in Western Europe, America and Russia \\",\\" Financial reform in Russia. Where does the state take money from us and what does it spend for them? \\",\\" The struggle of society and the state with bad working conditions \\",\\" The development of universal solidarity \\",\\" To fight against the people's darkness! \\" and others. He advocates, in particular, reforming the structure of the university social sciences teaching, the creation in classical universities of the faculties of economics, with the obligatory introduction of courses of national and world history, and the extensive professional training of management personnel for Russian industry and banking institutions. The main topics in the works of I. Kh. Ozerov were questions of the development of the domestic economy and the recovery of the financial system of the country. However, he paid no less attention to the problems of institutionalizing group interests, considering them in the context of changes in the economic life of Europe and the United States. His research echoed in general the theoretical developments of representatives of the German historical school (including in the analysis of specific historical and economic problems), as well as the findings of T. Veblen. = Views on industrialization = = Views on entrepreneurship and cooperation = Ozerov believed that \\"we need to create a new type of entrepreneur, with a broad outlook, on a large scale, with other methods\\" He spoke and wrote about the need to establish in Russia \\"an elastic social system that would give everyone the opportunity to develop their strength,\\" advocated raising interest in science, raising \\"another generation with different heads and other habits,\\" spoke in favor of switching from low-paid labor to highly paid. Ozerov was looking for more fair socially-organized forms of production and considered co-operation counter-monopoly. He believed that in a historical perspective, cooperation could make adjustments to the legal system, improve the budget, and reveal its potential. Ozerov was the most consistent of the so-called consumer societies, capable of uniting different classes, reducing or completely blocking social tensions that inevitably grow under capitalism. According to him, in the consumer society \\"people of different classes, estates <...> come together for a common cause, and they learn to appreciate each other and respect. The upper classes will not be so indifferent to the demands of the working class, and the workers, in turn, will become familiar with the production mechanism, marketing conditions, market influence on him, and will make practical demands\\". It is noteworthy that the Old Believers entrepreneurship relied on the ideas of Ozerov in their successful entrepreneurial activity. = Views on state intervention in the economy = Ozerov was convinced that much depends on the government, that the far-sighted government will build Russia's economic well-being \\"on its natural foundation ‚Äì the well-being of the Russian peasant. Otherwise, all this economic development will be ephemeral. \\" The economic life of Russia under Nicholas II reminded Ozerov \\"the life of a player depending on the harvest and crop failure\\". Ozerov emphasized that without a reversal of the general economic policy of the Stolypin agrarian reforms, which he hailed as a \\"creative\\" undertaking of the government of \\"great importance\\", \\"there can't be much confusion\\". = Views on financial policy = Ozerov was outraged by the course of the Ministry of Finance, when huge sums were sent to the current accounts of foreign banks, feeding the foreign money market, instead of using these funds for the development of the national economy. Ozerov spoke out against setting up a wine-vodka foundation for the budget of agricultural Russia and called for \\"pumping up and pumping very energetically into the pockets of the population\\". The country has been practicing tax-paying taxation for decades ‚Äì even for certain segments of the population. This, moreover, that the peasants had long been different in terms of property, and the landowners ‚Äì who had become rich and who had gone bankrupt ‚Äì and the heterogeneity of the trading brethren was clearly conspicuous. For years, Ozerov advocated the introduction of a differentiated (elastic) income tax, argued in the stimulating value of this innovation (long known in Europe and America) for the development of classes and economic life, for replenishing state coffers. Ozerov had his own (\\"non-partisan\\") program for the recovery of the Russian budget, which was mainly fed by consumption taxes. It provided for a redistribution of the tax burden in favor of the poor and a wider taxation of inheritances, review of official salary rates for senior officials, stopping the pernicious practices of unspoken budgets, strengthening the state control system and turning it into an effective force, nurturing conscientiousness with Russian taxpayers. In the book \\"How People's Money Is Spent in Russia\\" (1908), Ozerov writes:  Urban planning  In 1906 he published the book ‚ÄúBig Cities, Their Tasks and Management Tools‚Äù, becoming one of the founders of the theory of urban planning. Criticized Russian cities compared to European ones for backwardness of transport communications. Mikhail Blinkin, Transport in a city convenient for life  Writing activities  At the beginning of the 20th century, under the pseudonym Z. Ikhorov published the artistic works \\"Confession of a Man\\", \\"Notes of a Suicide\\", \\"Songs of a Homeless Man\\".  Commercial activity  In 1911, Ozerov was invited to the board of the Russian-Asian Bank A. I. Putilov. Then Ozerov in the \\"Russian Word\\" published an article about the speculation of Russian banks, for which all members of the board took up arms against him, and he was forced to leave the bank. Ozerov was a shareholder and board member of the Lena gold mines, the Erivan cement plant, the Tula land bank, the Khanzhonkov joint-stock company, the Russian paper-processing factory, the Sytin publishing house, the Lapshin match factory and others. offered I. D. Sytin cooperation for publishing his own newspaper in order to \\"gain influence on the formation of public opinion in our country\\", however, Sytin did not want to quarrel with the government, which gave orders for printing textbooks. Shortly before the February Revolution, Ozerov bought up the shares of the Erinsky cement plant for 105 rubles, and then sold them for 300, earning more than 1 million rubles.  Lifestyle  I.Kh. Ozerov walked in the same clothes for years, did not chic in restaurants, traveled in second grade. However, this did not prevent him from giving in to various temptations: ‚Äúhe did not mind, in his words,‚Äú drink and take a walk with ballerinas, ‚Äùhe tried drugs, wrote screenplays for A. A. Khanzhonkov\\". In 1911, he bequeathed all of his capital to the economic education of the population, free distribution of millions of copies of his books and articles, \\"calling for creativity\\" in all villages, villages, parish governments, factories. In this act, he followed in the trail of a well-known entrepreneur-philanthropist Kh. S. Ledentsov, who was among the executors, fulfilling his testamentary will.  Attitude towards revolutionary transformations  In 1915, Ozerov sharply criticized the current situation: Ozerov, more clearly than many (especially after the 1905 revolution), saw what misfortunes threatened Russia with the unresolved political, economic and social problems. The tsarist regime, he considered obsolete, barren, contrary to the interests of the country. In 1917, a scientist unflatteringly responded to the Provisional Government, whose ministers \\"did not argue about land reform, but about whether it was possible to allow meetings in the territory along which the trams pass and their rails run\\". In January 1918, Ozerov published in the newspaper \\"Our Time\\" an article entitled \\"Coming builders ‚Äì cold and hunger.\\" In it he writes:  Writings  *Income tax in England and the economic and social conditions of its existence (1898; master's thesis); *\\"The main trends in the development of direct taxation in Germany\\" (1900; doctoral dissertation); *\\"What is a consumer society?

Happer (1818‚Äì1894) was a nineteenth-century Presbyterian missionary who is known for his educational, medical, and religious endeavours in South China. Happer's missionary service lasted from 1844 to 1894, and during this time he worked in the suburbs and city of Canton.Crabtree, L. W., \\"Andrew P. Happer and Presbyterian Missions in China, 1844-1891\\", Journal of Presbyterian History, 1984, 62(1), 19-34. Retrieved 16 Nov. 2018. In the field of medicine, Happer created two dispensaries, the first was established in 1847 and the second in 1854. He also introduced higher Christian education to the Chinese youth of Canton through opening boarding and day schools, a training school, and eventually the Canton Christian College in the year 1888. Carrying out his duty as a Presbyterian missionary, Happer found the First Presbyterian Church where he was a pastor and converted many Cantonese people to Christianity, published books and other works focusing on Presbyterian faith, translated multiple religious works, and held editor positions for Presbyterian periodicals. After making his impact on the Cantonese people and laying down the foundation for future Presbyterian missions in South China, Happer left China for the last time in 1894. Background and education Born on October 20, 1818, in Monongahela, Pennsylvania, to two Christian Presbyterian parents, Andrew P. Happer is one of the most renowned missionaries who carried out his work in China, most notably the city of Canton.\\"Presbyterian Church U.S. Missionaries to China - Early Pioneers: HAPPER, Rev. Dr. Andrew Patton, D.D. & M.D.\\", Presbyterian Heritage Center, 2018. Retrieved 16 Nov. 2018. His mother, Ann Harper, had the most impact on his future career choice as she directed him towards Christian missionary work through placing him in the preparatory department of Jefferson College in Pennsylvania at age 11. = Marriages = Happer married Elizabeth Ball on 11 November 1847. Ball was part of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. In December 1864, his wife Elizabeth died, leaving Happer as a single father of five children whom he sent back home to Pennsylvania. In July 1867, Happer returned to America and married Miss A.L. Elliot two years later. Tragedy struck when his second wife died on October 10, 1873. A few years later, he married his third wife, Hannah J. Shaw, another Presbyterian missionary in Canton, on March 18, 1875. = Education = After graduating from Jefferson College in 1835, Happer entered the Western Theological Seminary in Pittsburgh in 1840. Upon graduation in 1843 from the seminary, he had been licensed by the Presbytery of Ohio. Happer was admitted in medical school at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.Benedetto, R. ‚ÄúAndrew P.

Upon receiving his M.D., he had been ordained to the Presbyterian ministry on April 23, 1844. Originally he had wanted to travel to India to do missionary work, however after the Opium War and China's opening to the West, he decided he could start his career there. Missionary Service (1844-1891) Happer co- founded one of the first Protestant missions in China through the American Presbyterian Church. The Presbyterian mission was one of the first four American mission agencies in China to carry out missionary work there. The multiple projects and institutions constructed by Happer throughout his forty- seven year career as a missionary represents the evolution of Presbyterian missionary work in China throughout the nineteenth century. He, John G. Kerr (medical administration), and WAP Martin (language) are considered the pioneering Presbyterian missionaries in China. = First trip to China (1844‚Äì1847), medical missionary work = Upon Happer's arrival in Macau on October 23, 1844, the Opium War had previously blocked most forms of western and missionary influence in China. Ability to travel throughout China had been very restricted for foreigners. Although access to Canton was still officially restricted, Happer reached the people through the provision of medical aid and preaching the gospel.\\"DEATH OF DR. HAPPER.\\", New York Evangelist, 1894, 65(47), 28. Retrieved 16 Nov. 2018. Following the Opium War, the Treaty of Nanking opened five ports for foreign trade. As a result, China became open to missionaries. As one of only 31 Protestant missionaries (3 of them Presbyterian, Happer faced numerous challenges and difficulties. Few resources were available, with China as an intimidating location. Foreigners were not allowed to live in Canton so Happer moved to Hong Kong and worked and later led at the Morrison Education Society. Happer returned to Macau in 1845 and opened a boy's boarding school with twenty-seven enrolled students. Although the Opium War treaties had declared that foreigners could access Canton, the Chinese officials refused to let Happer enter the city. He had to move the school to a suburb of Canton. After realizing the responsiveness of the Cantonese people towards education and medicine, Happer opened his first dispensary in 1847. Happer carried out Christian evangelism through the dispensary in various ways, including preaching to his patients and holding chapel services for community residents. Overall, the dispensary treated seven thousand patients annually. This number rose to ten thousand in 1854 after the opening of a secondary dispensary. Management of these dispensaries was handed over to John Glasgow Kerr that same year. Kerr eventually opened the Canton Hospital that served a great portion of people from South China. After transferring the responsibility of the dispensaries to Kerr, Happer focused more on providing a Christian-focused western education to Chinese youth. =Second trip to China - Focus on a Education and mission expansion (1859-1869)= During his second mission, Happer focused on education and evangelism. He was passionate about converting Chinese individuals to Christianity and converting society through providing education. In 1850, he opened a set of day schools to educate young Chinese boys in both western and Chinese studies. The schools faced difficulty attracting youth from the upper class who were enrolled in traditional schools that prepared students for the civil service examinations. By December 1853, Happer opened a day school for Chinese girls which offered courses in reading, writing, and economics. By the end of 1853,the first eleven students graduated from the boy's boarding school with two students devoting themselves to the Canton mission. Happer went on medical furlough in 1855 and the Second Anglo-Chinese War delayed the Happer's return from furlough until 1859. Followign the war, however, the treaties produced by the war promoted free and unrestricted access to Canton. This led to an upsurge of missionaries into the Canton with increased conversions to Christianity. In the 1860s, Happer founded the First Presbyterian Church, numerous boarding and day schools, and a training school serving preachers, teachers, and colporteurs of Canton. Happer served as pastor of the First Presbyterian Church in Canton, established in 1862. Through establishing multiple forms of educational services, Happer accomplished his mission of bringing Christian higher education to China, though much of the student body of the training school included those working for the church. In order to reach governmental Chinese leaders through western education, from 1865 and 1867, Happer directed the Chinese government's Interpreter's College in Canton and taught English and mathematics to students entering government services as foreign specialists. By introducing Christian teachings within his courses, he continued his mission of evangelism and observed the gradual growth of Canton Presbyterians. This is supported by the statistics reported from the Canton Mission that in 1866: 147 individuals were enrolled in mission schools. =Final trip to China - Expanding Education and Religious Outreach (1870-1891)= After a 1867 furlough to the US and marriage to his second wife, and revitalized by newfound love and the increasing presence of western influence in China, Happer returned to China in 1870. This missionary period was marked by a change in his missionary career from mission-centric to program-focused. Specifically, this included the local development of ‚Äúevangelistic, education, and medical programs.‚Äù. In his evangelistic efforts, Happer continued being a pastor of the First Church, built a new sanctuary, attracted more upper-class citizens to the church, opened two new churches, and increased overall church membership. Contribution to Presbyterian literature Happer took great interest in writing about ‚Äútheology and practice among Chinese converts‚Äù along with translating various portions of the Bible. From 1880 to 1884, he had been the editor of the most popular western language periodical in China, the Chinese Recorder and Missionary Journal. Through this position, he was able to publish various books, pamphlets, and forums about the Presbyterian faith and practice in the Chinese church. Under his direction, some religious books had been translated into Cantonese. One of his most esteemed projects had been serving on a China-wide committee of missionaries to design a Cantonese version of the New Testament. Along with the journal, Happer also held a position as Chairman of the Editorial Committee for the Presbyterian Press at Shanghai. Canton Christian College Happer was encouraged by the Canton Mission to narrow the purpose of the boy's training school. He, therefore, decided to pursue his greater vision of opening a non-denominational institution, the Canton Christian College in 1888. In order to integrate Presbyterian values within the college, the institution had Presbyterian faculty and supporters. While the Board of Trustees would govern the college from the United States, the Board of Directors consisted of mainly Presbyterians in China. Happer became the first president of Canton Christian College which offered various courses in both liberal arts and pre-professional fields, including medicine and science. As in the case with the boys training school and his own college, Happer had always desired to expand the education of the students to prepare them for all types of careers, not only Christian workers. To ensure that students would acquire advanced knowledge in technology and modern science, Happer ensured that teaching would be in English. As a devout believer in higher education, Happer constantly made decisions reflecting his desire to train his students to one day leading the economic and social advancement of China. Before completing his missionary work, Happer taught classes at the college in Canton. Although Happer left China with his wife for the last time in 1891, his impact would forever remain and lead to the rapid growth and development of missionary work opening China to the west. Legacy While residing in the United States, Happer was able to celebrate the 50th anniversary of his ordination to the work of the Foreign Missions as an evangelist by the Presbytery. He had also been ordained as an evangelist in the Presbyterian Church in Monongahela City. On Saturday, October 27, 1894, in his own home in Wooster, Ohio, Happer died at seventy-six years and seven days old. Over the years, the Christian Canton College has undergone various name and location changes. In 1952 the college was incorporated into Chung Shan University (now Sun Yat-sen University). As a result of the communist occupation by the Japanese in Canton, some of the Canton Christian College faculty fled to Hong Kong and developed the Lingnan School offering diploma programs in liberal arts, commerce, and social science. Registered as an Approved Post-Secondary College, the university changed its name to Lingnan College at the end of 1978. The college received full recognition as a university by the Hong Kong's government in 1998. On July 30, 1999, the institution's name was changed to Lingnan University, becoming the sole public liberal arts university in Hong Kong.Wikipedia contributors, \\"Lingnan University (Hong Kong)\\", The Free Encyclopedia, 2018. Retrieved 16 Nov. 2018. At the time, Lingnan University was declared the leading Christian institution for higher education in South China. Happer's legacy contributed to the history of the two continuing universities in mainland China and in Hong Kong. Happer laid the foundation for future missionary work in South China to flourish. His legacyis known for igniting the missionary and English language educational movement in China and the youth that he described as ‚Äúcertainly full of promise for the future.‚Äù.Happer, A.P. ‚ÄúEDUCATIONAL MOVEMENT IN CHINA.‚Äù, ‚ÄúReformed Church Messenger‚Äù, 1887, 38(36), 4. Retrieved 16 Nov. 2018. While his accomplishments are significant and lasting, he himself admitted that it was not an easy journey saying, ‚ÄúMy missionary life was in a new and most difficult field.‚Äù. Within a journal article written by Happer in 1872, was his hope for the future of China, the Chinese youth, and the spread of the Christian Gospel message. He discussed introducing new programs that would allow some Chinese youth to study in the United States for a period of time in the hopes that they too could receive a proper Western education and assume the roles of missionaries. This reflects his passion for enhancing the prosperity of the Chinese society through educating the youth to lead the future of the country. Happer also wrote about the work being accomplished to advance the educational movement in China and its promising future. Referring to the work of various missionaries, including himself, towards introducing Western education to Chinese youth, Happer describes China as such: > ‚ÄúNow, since China has taken her place among the nations of the earth, she > greatly needs men of her own country, with a thorough education in Western > language and science, to carry on the international intercourse that this > now position requires of her.‚Äù. Being a multi-faceted missionary, Happer focused on the advancement of education, health, and Christianity throughout Canton. His religious foundation is described in the future of China as: > ‚ÄúA brighter day is in prospect for China, and the only hope of her > regeneration is in the gospel of Christ.‚Äù.

The rifle is also called Sultan in memory of the Emirati Colonel Sultan Mohammed Ali al-Kitbi who was killed in action in Saudi-led intervention in Yemen. History The Caracal CAR 816 shares lineage to the Heckler & Koch HK416. The principal firearms engineers for the CAR 816 were Robert Hirt and Chris Sirois. Hirt was instrumental in the development of the HK416. Following his time with Heckler & Koch, Hirt was recruited by SIG Sauer to work with then SIG engineer Chris Sirois on an improved version of the HK416: the SIG Sauer SIG516. Hirt and Siriois were then recruited by Caracal to develop a rifle that was superior to both the HK416 and SIG516. From this, the CAR 816 was created.https://smallarmssolutions.com/home/caracal-wins-india-556mm-rifle- contract The CAR 816 is the primary infantry assault rifle of the United Arab Emirates Armed Forces.  Design and features  short-stroke gas piston The CAR 816 is a gas operated, select fire assault rifle with ambidextrous controls that fires from a closed rotary bolt. The AR 816 is based on the AR-15 platform ergonomic architecture, but uses a short-stroke gas piston operating system (unlike the AR-15's piston-operated gas impingement system) with a user-adjustable gas system. With the help of the three position regulator (normal, adverse conditions and suppressor/silencer settings), the gas system can be adjusted to function reliably with various propellant, projectile, fouling, operating environment and configuration specific pressure behavior. The chamber is modified so the rifle is over-the-beach capable to let the CAR 816 fire safely as quickly as possible after being submerged in water. The M4 carbine profile hammer forged chrome lined barrel has a twist rate and features a standard A2-style flash suppressor at its muzzle end. = Stock = The CAR 816 handguard features four STANAG 2324/MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rails. These allow for direct accessory attachment onto the rail mounting points, and can be removed without the usage of tools. The shoulder stock is a telescoping 6 position type stock which is adjustable for length of pull. = Trigger = The CAR 816 uses a mil-spec direct trigger. = Fire selector = The selector settings are: safe, semi-automatic fire and automatic fire. = Sights = The CAR 816 basic version features rail mounted flip up rear and front iron sights. The integrated rail on the upper receiver and its continuation on the handguard at the 12 o'clock position allows for the adaptation of various aiming optics. = Feeding = The CAR 816 features a Draft STANAG 4179 compliant magazine well and is fed with STANAG magazines with a standard capacity of 30 rounds. Other STANAG compatible box and drum magazines can be used. Variants The weapon is available in semi-automatic and select-fire configurations with four barrel lengths;a personal defence weapon with a barrel, a compact assault rifle with a barrel, carbine with a barrel and assault rifle with a barrel. The standard issue of the rifle supplied to the UAE armed forces bears an engraving honoring Colonel Sultan Mohammed Ali al-Kitbi. The Caracal CAR816 A2 is a semi-automatic only export version produced in the United States by Caracal USA. It is built to exceed the NATO test protocols; ‚ÄúBore Obstruction‚Äù and ‚ÄúOver the Beach‚Äù Testing. It features some minor alterations (M-LOK rails on the handguard and a button cut and QPQ treated steel modified M4 contour barrel) to better meet civilian market preferences in the United States.
