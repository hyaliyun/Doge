The 2013 El Protector was the second annual event produced under that name and held in January each year. The focal point of the show was the El Protector tag team tournament where seven teams competed for the trophy. Production =Background= Lucha Libre has a tradition for a tournament where a rookie, or novato, would be teamed up with an experienced veteran wrestler for a tag team tournament in the hopes of giving the Novato a chance to show case their talent and move up the ranks. Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre has held a Torneo Gran Alternativa (\\"Great Alternative Tournament\\") almost every year since 1994, but the concept predates the creation of the Gran Alternativa. The Mexican professional wrestling company International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG; at times referred to as Grupo Internacional Revoluci√≥n in Mexico) started their own annual rookie/veteran tournament in 2010. The first two tournaments were called Torneo Relampago de Proyeccion a Nuevas Promesas de la Lucha Libre (Spanish for \\"Projecting a new promise lightning tournament\\") but would be renamed the El Protector tournament in 2012. The El Protector shows, as well as the majority of the IWRG shows in general, are held in \\"Arena Naucalpan\\", owned by the promoters of IWRG and their main arena. The 2013 El Protector show was the fourth time that IWRG promoted a show around the rookie/veteran tournament, with the name changing to El Protector in 2012 and onwards. =Storylines= The event featured nine professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. =Tournament participants= *Canis Lupus and Pirata Morgan *Carta Brava, Jr. and X-Fly *Centvri√≥n and Veneno *Eita and Negro Navarro *Hijo del Pantera and Pantera *Kiwby and Fuerza Guerrera *Saruman and El Solar Of all the teams only Hijo del Pantera and Pantera have teamed up in the past as the father/son team worked together in many matches before this show. Previous tournaments included eight teams, but for unknown reasons the 2013 tournament only had seven teams. IWRG solved the number problem by holding a \\"seeding\\" Battle Royal to determine the tournament brackets, including having the winner of the battle royal advance straight to the semi-main event. The Battle Royal included the seven \\"rookies\\" representing their teams.

The room was completed in 1859 as part of the Capitol's vast extension, which added new Senate and House wings and the new cast-iron dome. History When architects designed the new Senate wing in the early 1850s, senators directed them to include a President's Room, partly to symbolize the Senate's constitutional responsibility to provide the President of the United States with advice and consent on nominations and treaties. Presidents used the room to sign legislation into law at the close of each session of Congress. This practice ended in 1933 with the ratification of the Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which established different ending dates for presidential and congressional terms of office. Although occasionally used by presidents, the room today is utilized primarily by senators for interviews and press conferences. In 1991, the room's historic furnishings were restored to the 1870s period by the Senate Commission on Art. The ceiling and walls were also restored to their original glowing colors and subtle details, and the mirrors were regilded. The room is only accessible on a guided tour with a Congressional staff member when the Senate is not in session. During the impeachment trial of Bill Clinton, Chief Justice William Rehnquist used the President's Room as an office. Chief Justice John Roberts used the room as an office during the impeachment trial of Donald Trump. =Use by Presidents= The room was first used by President James Buchanan on March 4, 1861, at a time of great peril for the nation, after several southern states had left the Union and a month before the Civil War began. The country was still at war on March 3, 1865, when President Abraham Lincoln visited the President's Room to sign the usual flurry of end-of-session legislation. There he received word from Union General Ulysses S. Grant that Confederate General Robert E. Lee had requested a meeting to discuss \\"the subjects of controversy between the belligerents.\\" After consulting with Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton and Secretary of State William Henry Seward, Lincoln responded through Stanton that Grant was not to confer with the Confederate general, \\"unless it be for the capitulation of General Lee's army,\\" but should \\"press to the utmost your military advantages.\\" Lee surrendered the Army of Northern Virginia to Grant the following month. A dozen years later, on March 3, 1877, President Grant used the President's Room to sign legislation enacted during the final days of the Forty-fourth Congress. Woodrow Wilson had great plans for this room when he became President in 1913. The first Democratic President in sixteen years, he intended to use the President's Room as a working office to confer with congressional Democrats, who controlled both houses for the first time in eighteen years. At first, Wilson was a frequent caller, but he visited the Capitol less often as support for his legislative agenda faltered and his relations with Congress deteriorated. Republicans, who regained the Senate majority in 1918 resented Wilson's failure to confer with the Senate before negotiating the treaty ending World War I, as did many members of Wilson's own party, and the President suffered a humiliating defeat when the Senate rejected the Versailles Treaty on November 19, 1919, and again on March 19, 1920. Wilson's last visit to the President's Room was particularly painful. While signing end-of-session legislation on March 4, 1921, he was informed by Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Henry Cabot Lodge (R-Mass.), who had led the fight against the treaty, that Congress had completed its work and awaited \\"further communication from you.\\" His health broken by an exhausting campaign to secure popular support for the treaty, Wilson refused to look at his adversary, responding with a terse \\"I have no further communication.\\" On August 6, 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson became the first President in over a quarter century to use the President's Room for its intended purpose, signing the 1965 Voting Rights Act into law after a stirring and emotional ceremony in the Capitol Rotunda. Johnson had appeared before a Joint Session of Congress on March 15, 1965, to urge passage of the bill guaranteeing equal voting rights for African American citizens. He returned to the Capitol to sign the act, a gesture that, as he explained in his memoirs, was intended to \\"dramatize the importance we attached to this bill - and to give full measure to the Congress.\\" Although his successors have used the room for other purposes during their terms in office, Johnson was apparently the last President to sign legislation in the President's Room until Donald Trump. Trump signed a bill on his first day in office, January 20, 2017, waiving the seven-year waiting period for a former military officer to serve as Secretary of Defense. That law allowed James Mattis to be nominated. In the exuberant days following his November 1980 election victory, President-elect Ronald Reagan happily looked toward the Capitol and told reporters, \\"Get the President's Room ready!\\" Although his immediate predecessor, Jimmy Carter, had expressed similar intentions when he took office in 1977, he never acted on them. Four years earlier, Senator Howard Baker of Tennessee had unsuccessfully urged President Richard Nixon to move his working offices to the Capitol, leaving the White House as the president's ceremonial and residential quarters. Living up to his earlier promise, Reagan made the President's Room his first stop after leaving the Capitol's inaugural platform on January 20, 1981. Accompanied by Vice President George H.W. Bush, Senate leaders Howard Baker and Robert C. Byrd, and a large media contingent, the new President signed nominations to U.S. Cabinet posts and an order freezing federal employment. On several occasions in the ensuing months, Reagan returned to this room to confer with congressional leaders on a budget compromise. Following Reagan's example, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump have chosen to begin their presidencies with a visit here. References Sources  * External links *Presidents Room. N.

His sentence drew protest from the European Union and from numerous human rights groups, including Amnesty International, which designated him a prisoner of conscience.  Lese majeste incident  Somyot is a member of the \\"red shirts\\", a movement supporting former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra; Thaksin was removed from power in 2006 by a coup d'√©tat. In 2010, Somyot, then the editor of the magazine Voice of Thaksin, published two articles critical of a fictional character interpreted by the court as representing King Bhumibol Adulyadej. He was not the author of the two articles. Somyot was arrested for lese majesty on April 30, 2011, five days after launching a grass-roots campaign to collect 10,000 signatures for petition that called for a reform of the lese majesty law. Somyot was arrested and imprisoned without bail for nearly two years. On 23 January 2013, the Criminal Court of Thailand convicted him of lese majeste and sentenced to a total of eleven years in prison: one year for a suspended sentence for a defamation charge, and five years each for the two counts of violating Article 112, the lese majeste law. The judge stated, \\"The accused is a journalist who had a duty to check the facts in these articles before publishing them. He knew the content defamed the monarchy but allowed their publication anyway\\". Somyot's lawyer said following the verdict that Somyot would appeal, adding: \\"I can confirm that he did not intend to violate Article 112 ... He was doing his job as a journalist.\\" The presiding judge in Somyot's case was Judge Chanathip Mueanphawong (‡∏ä‡∏ô‡∏≤‡∏ò‡∏¥‡∏õ ‡πÄ‡∏´‡∏°‡∏∑‡∏≠‡∏ô‡∏û‡∏∞‡∏ß‡∏á‡∏®‡πå). Judge Chanathip has also been in charge of many l√®se majest√© cases, including the case of Ampon Tangnoppakul or Uncle SMS in which the judge sentenced Ampon to 20 years in prison, the case of Surachai Danwattananusorn who was sentenced to imprisonment for five years and six months, and the case of Chiranuch Premchaiporn who was given a suspended sentence of one-year imprisonment on grounds of failing to remove l√®se majest√© comments on her website. = International reaction = The verdict came at a time when Thailand's lese majeste laws were becoming increasingly controversial domestically and internationally. Thai activists and human rights groups stated that the laws were disproportionately used to imprison \\"red shirts\\" and other political opponents of the government. Prior to the trial, an alliance of human rights organizations lobbied for the dismissal of the charges against Somyot, including Amnesty International, Freedom House, the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH), and the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT). Amnesty International called Somyot a \\"human rights defender\\" and designated him a prisoner of conscience, imprisoned \\"simply for peacefully exercising his right to freedom of expression\\". The Asian Human Rights Commission argued that the lese majeste law itself was unconstitutional in Thailand, protesting a Constitutional Court decision to uphold it. A delegation of the European Union criticized the verdict in Somyot's case, stating that it \\"seriously undermines the right to freedom of expression and press freedom\\". Human Rights Watch stated that \\"The courts seem to have adopted the role of chief protector of the monarchy at the expense of free expression rights\\". Reporters Without Borders called the verdict an \\"affront to media freedom\\". The court's chief judge, Thawee Prachuablarb, defended the sentence: \\"There have been criticisms, rather one- sided, that the court was too harsh in its judgement but the five-year prison term for each of the two counts is considered appropriate ... It is mid-way between the minimum sentence under this law, which is three years, and the maximum punishment of 15 years. The court made its ruling in accordance with the law.\\" = His release from prison = Somyot Prueksakasemsuk finished his sentence and was released from prison on April 30, 2018. In interviews, he said that he had lost his family and his job as a result of the lese majesty charge, and that at one point in jail, after developing gout due to wounds from his shackles, he had attempted suicide. Immediately upon his release he vowed to go back to fighting for democracy. ‚ÄúParticipating in political activities is a civic duty. It is an expression. . . .

In the middle of the thirteenth century, seemingly during the 1260s, E√≥in's family appears to have been ejected from its homeland in Argyll by the Stewart/Menteith kindred. It may have been during this period that members of Clann Suibhne took up residence in Ireland. In the first decade of the fourteenth century, E√≥in appears on record claiming his family's Scottish lands. As such, E√≥in campaigned on behalf of the English cause during the First War of Scottish Independence as a means of combating the Stewarts/Menteiths. An expedition by E√≥in to reclaim his ancestral lordship may be referred to by a particular piece of mediaeval Gaelic poetry. Although a sixteenth-century source alleges that E√≥in was the first Clann Suibhne Lord of Fanad, contemporary sources appear to show that the family gained the lordship later in the fourteenth century.

As late as 1261, an earlier member of the clan, a certain Dubhghall mac Suibhne, is reported to have been the lord of Skipness Castle and its adjacent chapel. That year, according to a charter witnessed by Walter Stewart, Earl of Menteith, Dubhghall granted away some of his territory to Paisley Abbey.MacDonald, IG (2013) p. 315; Boardman, S (2007) p. 97; Butter (2007) pp. 84, 84 n. 200, 90; Boardman, S (2006) pp. 15, 30 n. 34; McDonald (1997) pp. 228, 241; Jennings (1994) p. 143; Argyll: An Inventory of the Monuments (1992) p. 258 ¬ß 119; Munro; Munro (1986) p. 87 ¬ß 58; Dunbar; Duncan (1971) p. 6; Argyll: An Inventory of the Monuments (1971) p. 178 ¬ß 314; Sellar (1971) p. 27; Simpson (1960) p. 12; McKerral (1951) p. 5; Campbell (1911) p. 277; Paul (1909) p. 130; Brown, A (1889) p. 189; Fraser (1888a) pp. 62‚Äì63; Lees (1878) p. 70; Origines Parochiales Scotiae (1854) pp. 27, 40; Howson (1841) p. 84; Registrum Monasterii de Passelet (1832) pp. 120‚Äì121; Document 3/381/1 (n.d.).

The circumstances surrounding of Dubhghall's contract with Walter are unclear.Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 255‚Äì256; Barrow (1973) p. 373. There are no other records regarding the allotment of Clann Suibhne lands during this period, and it is not known if the Stewarts/Menteiths or their allies had already established themselves in Knapdale.Argyll: An Inventory of the Monuments (1992) p. 258 ¬ß 119. One possibility is that Dubhghall and his family succumbed to a military campaign against them.Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 255‚Äì256. The creation of the Stewart/Menteith lordship of Knapdale may have been undertaken in the context of extending Scottish royal authority into Argyll and the Isles.Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 255‚Äì256; Young (1990) p. 15. This transition of power certainly seems to have marked an increase in Scottish authority in Argyll.Fisher (2005) p. 93. In any case, the continued Stewart/Menteith lordship of Knapdale is evidenced by Walter's grant of churches in Knapdale to Kilwinning Abbey,Barker (2017); Argyll: An Inventory of the Monuments (1992) pp. 85 ¬ß 45, 150 ¬ß 71, 161 ¬ß 76, 258 ¬ß 119; Paul (1909) p. 131; Fraser (1888a) p. 63; Fraser (1888b) pp. xxxi ¬ß 13, 220‚Äì221; Theiner (1864) pp. 248 ¬ß 488, 257‚Äì258 ¬ß¬ß 504; Document 3/19/5 (n.d.). and by an act of parliament that notes the earl's land of Knapdale in 1293.Barrow (2005) p. 76; Argyll: An Inventory of the Monuments (1992) p. 258 ¬ß 119; Paul (1909) p. 132; Brown, A (1889) p. 189; Fraser (1888a) p. 73; Origines Parochiales Scotiae (1854) p. 40; The Acts of the Parliaments of Scotland (1844) p. 447/91; RPS, 1293/2/17 (n.d.a); RPS, 1293/2/17 (n.d.b). Regardless, ensuing historical events reveal that later members of Clann Suibhne regarded this territorial arrangement as unacceptable.Barrow (2005) p. 76; Barrow (1973) p. 373.

(1996) p. 518; Argyll: An Inventory of the Monuments (1992) pp. 20, 249 ¬ß 119, 258 ¬ß 119. it is also possible that the composition merely depicts an idealised and exaggerated expedition that was never undertaken.Coira (2012) p. 193; Breeze (2007) p. 106; Simms (2007) pp. 110‚Äì111; Raven, JA (2005) p. 21. In fact, there is reason to suspect that the poem was composed not for E√≥in, but for a fourteenth-century member of the kindred, E√≥ghan, brother of Toirdhealbhach Caoch Mac Suibhne, Lord of Fanad. As such, D√°l chabhlaigh ar Chaist√©al Suibhne may instead concern a proposed expedition by E√≥ghan to reclaim his family's ancestral Scottish heritage.Simms (2018) pp. 437‚Äì438 n. 59; Simms (2007) p. 111. illumination of Edward II on folio 105r of Oxford Bodleian Library Rawlinson C 292.Statutes of England to 1320 (n.d.). Historically, in February 1306, Robert Bruce VII, Earl of Carrick, a claimant to the Scottish throne, murdered his chief rival to the kingship, John Comyn III, Lord of Badenoch.Young; Stead (2010a) p. 80; Barrow (2008); Barrow (2005) p. 181; Young (2004); Boardman, S (2001); McDonald (1997) p. 169. Although the former seized the throne (as Robert I) by March, the English Crown immediately struck back, defeating his forces in June. By September, Robert was a fugitive, and seems to have escaped into the Hebrides.Barrow (2008); McDonald (1997) pp. 170‚Äì174. In 1307, at about the time of the death of Edward I, King of England in July, Robert mounted a remarkable return to power.Young; Stead (2010a) pp. 92‚Äì93; Barrow (2008); Barrow (2005) pp. 220‚Äì224; McDonald (1997) pp. 174‚Äì175. By 1309, his opponents had been largely overcome, and he held his first parliament as king.Barrow (2008). In 1310, Edward II, King of England orchestrated an expedition into Scotland. One component of the campaign was a maritime force launched from Ireland under the command of Richard de Burgh, Earl of Ulster.McNamee (2012b) ch. 2 ¬∂ 27; Duffy (1993) p. 191; Palgrave (1830) p. 392 ¬ß 63. One possibility is that Richard was meant to support the forces of the English-aligned Clann Dubhghaill in Argyll. It may well have been in the context of bolstering the campaign that the English Crown reached out to E√≥in and other neighbouring maritime magnates.McNamee (2012b) ch. 2 ¬∂ 27.

E√≥in's pursuance of his ancestral claim to Knapdale meant that he was John's greatest enemy.Watson, F (2004). Specifically, in July 1310, correspondence between E√≥in and Edward II reveals that the English king granted E√≥in‚Äîand E√≥in's brothers Toirdhealbhach and Murchadh‚Äîthe land of Knapdale which formerly belonged to their ancestors, as a means to continue to combat Walter's son, John Menteith, an adherent of the Scottish Crown.McNamee (2012b) ch. 2 ¬∂ 27; Brown, M (2008) pp. 40, 61; Oram; Adderley (2008) p. 76; Nicholls (2007) p. 92; Barrow (2005) pp. 76, 252; McDonald (1997) p. 166; Ewart; Triscott; Holmes et al.

Clearly, the Stewart/Menteith opposition to Edward II was the catalyst for E√≥in's support of the English.Watson, F (1991) p. 256. Clann Suibhne's alignment with the English, therefore, exemplifies how bitter long-standing local rivalries dictated the adherence or opposition to the Bruce cause.McNamee (2012b) ch. 2 ¬∂ 27; Brown, M (2004) p. 260. Further correspondence likewise evinces this royal grant to E√≥in, and reveals that he was in the company of Aonghus √ìg Mac Domhnaill and Hugh Bisset whilst on campaign against John.Burke (2015) p. ii; Cochran-Yu (2015) p. 59; Cameron (2014) p. 153; Nicholls (2007) p. 92, 92 n. 47; Barrow (2005) pp. 76, 217; Brown, M (2004) p. 260; Duffy (2002) p. 61; Campbell of Airds (2000) pp. 60‚Äì61; McDonald (1997) pp. 165‚Äì167, 169, 190‚Äì191; Duffy (1993) pp. 202‚Äì203, 203 n. 49, 206; Argyll: An Inventory of the Monuments (1992) p. 258 ¬ß 119; Watson, F (1991) pp. 256, 271; Munro; Munro (1986) p. 281; Lamont (1981) pp. 161, 162, 164; Barrow (1973) pp. 373, 381; List of Diplomatic Documents (1963) p. 197; Reid, WS (1960) pp. 10‚Äì11; McKerral (1951) pp. 5‚Äì6; Bain (1884) p. 320 ¬ß¬ß 1253‚Äì1255; Stevenson (1870b) pp. 435 ¬ß 614, 436 ¬ß 615, 437 ¬ß 616; Document 3/31/0 (n.d.); Document 3/90/11 (n.d.); Document 3/381/0 (n.d.). E√≥in's letter to the king specifies that, although he was able to visit Knapdale and view it, he was unable to gain possession of it on account of the occupying forces of E√≥in Mac Dubhghaill.Nicholls (2007) p. 92; Brown, M (2004) p. 260; Watson, F (2004); Campbell of Airds (2000) pp. 60‚Äì61; McDonald (1997) pp. 165‚Äì166; Watson, F (1991) p. 256; Lamont (1981) p. 162; List of Diplomatic Documents (1963) p. 197; Bain (1884) p. 320 ¬ß 1255; Stevenson (1870b) p. 437 ¬ß 616; Fraser (1888a) pp. 438‚Äì439; Document 3/381/0 (n.d.). In any case, in early August, within weeks of Richard's intended maritime campaign, Edward II redirected the fleet to Mann, and placed it under the command of Simon de Montagu.McNamee (2012b) ch. 2 ¬∂ 27; Duffy (1993) p. 191; Rotuli Scoti√¶ (1814) p. 92. If D√°l chabhlaigh ar Chaist√©al Suibhne indeed refers to a specific event, it is conceivable that this event took place at about the time of Edward II's grant to E√≥in.Brown, M (2004) p. 263 n. 13; McDonald (1997) pp. 20, 166, 249; Ewart; Triscott; Holmes et al. (1996) p. 518; Argyll: An Inventory of the Monuments (1992) pp. 20, 258 ¬ß 119. Whatever the case, Clann Suibhne was apparently unable to make good of the king's grant, and never regained possession of Knapdale.McDonald (1997) p. 166; Argyll: An Inventory of the Monuments (1992) p. 258 ¬ß 119; Munro; Munro (1986) p. xxvi. The fact that th earl's maritime campaign never materialised as intended may account for E√≥in's inability to secure his ancestral lands.Brown, M (2008) p. 40. In consequence of this failure, E√≥in appears to have thereafter served in Ireland,Duffy (2002) p. 61. where members of Clann Suibhne later served as military commanders.Breen; Raven (2017) pp. 157‚Äì158; Argyll: An Inventory of the Monuments (1992) p. 258 ¬ß 119; McKerral (1951) p. 6. If the largely legendary sixteenth-century Leabhar Clainne Suibhne is to be believed, E√≥in was banished from Scotland having killed a man,Coira (2012) p. 191; Walsh (1920) pp. 16‚Äì17 ¬ß 13. after which E√≥in relocated to Ireland, and overcame the U√≠ Bresl√©in to become the first in a long line of Clann Suibhne lords of Fanad.Coira (2012) p. 191; Nicholls (2007) p. 92; Simms (2007) p. 108; Duffy (2002) p. 61; Walsh (1920) pp. 16‚Äì17 ¬ß 13. However, there is reason to suspect that this account is erroneous. For example, this supposed massacre of the U√≠ Bresl√©in is not documented by any of the Irish annals.Simms (2009) p. 76; Simms (2007) p. 108. In fact, the U√≠ Bresl√©in were earlier dispossessed by the U√≠ Domhnaill, and the fifteenth- to sixteenth-century Annals of Ulster notes the death of the U√≠ Domhnaill Lord of Fanad in 1281.Simms (2007) p. 108; Annala Uladh (2005) ¬ß 1278.2; Annala Uladh (2003) ¬ß 1278.2. Also, Leabhar Clainne Suibhne notes that certain territories within Fanad were granted to Clann Suibhne by the U√≠ Domhnaill later in the fourteenth century, which suggests that Clann Suibhne was not then in possession of the lordship.Simms (2007) p. 108; Walsh (1920) pp. 31‚Äì33 ¬ß 25. In fact, the first recorded Clann Suibhne Lord of Fanad is Toirdhealbhach Caoch.Simms (2007) pp. 109‚Äì112. Final loss of the Clann Suibhne patrimony Ruinous Skipness Castle was a Clann Suibhne stronghold until the thirteenth century. As late as 1261, it was held by E√≥in's predecessor, Dubhghall mac Suibhne, a man who may have built the castle.Campbell of Airds (2000) pp. 31‚Äì32; Argyll: An Inventory of the Monuments (1971) p. 178 ¬ß 314. In 1314, Edward II granted one of his Scottish retainers, a certain Dungal de Gyvelestone, the lands of Knapdale and Glendaruel. In this grant, these territories are stated to have been in the hands of John, and to have been earlier possessed by a certain \\"Suny Magurke\\"‚Äîpresumably at some point in the late thirteenth century.McNamee (2012b) ch. 5 ¬∂ 61; Argyll: An Inventory of the Monuments (1992) pp. 19, 537 n. 52; Campbell (1911) p. 280; Calendar of the Patent Rolls (1898) p. 264; Bain (1887) p. 80 ¬ß 423. On one hand, Suny's recorded name could indicate that he was the son of a man named MurchadhArgyll: An Inventory of the Monuments (1992) p. 537 n. 52; Campbell (1911) p. 280.‚Äîperhaps a son of Murchadh Mac Suibhne who died in 1267, or a son of the like-named brother of E√≥in noted in 1310.Campbell (1911) p. 280. On the other hand, it is possible that Suny is identical to E√≥in's father, and that his recorded name equates to '. Following Robert's consolidation of authority in Scotland, the lands of English adherents were forfeited and redistributed to close supporters of the Bruce cause. As such, the vast Clann Dubhghaill maritime territories were broken up and granted away to various kindreds. As for the former Clann Suibhne lordship of Knapdale, Robert apparently granted it to John.Penman, M (2014) p. 114; McNamee (2012a) ch. 10 ¬∂ 25; Barrow (2005) p. 469 n. 89; Brown, A (1889) p. 189; Origines Parochiales Scotiae (1854) p. 40; The New Statistical Account of Scotland (1854) p. 637 pt. argyle. The latter's like-named grandson was certainly styled \\"Lord of Knapdale and Arran\\" in 1357,Argyll: An Inventory of the Monuments (1992) p. 259 ¬ß 119; Duncan; Brown (1956‚Äì1957) p. 203; Thomson (1912) pp. 50‚Äì51 ¬ß 182; Origines Parochiales Scotiae (1854) p. 41; Robertson (1798) p. 49 ¬ß 1. and is recorded to have granted various lands in the lordship‚Äîincluding Castle Sween‚Äîto Giolla Easbuig Caimb√©al, Lord of Loch Awe.Boardman, S (2006) p. 64; Boardman, SI (2005) pp. 124‚Äì125; Campbell of Airds (2000) p. 92; Argyll: An Inventory of the Monuments (1992) p. 259 ¬ß 119; Munro; Munro (1986) pp. xxvi, lxiii; Fraser (1888b) pp. 235‚Äì236, 236 n. 1; Origines Parochiales Scotiae (1854) p. 41.

Clann Suibhne and Clann Domhnaill backed opposing sides in a succession dispute amongst the U√≠ Domhnaill of T√≠r Chonaill.Duffy (1993) p. 161. Domhnall √ìg √ì Domhnaill, King of T√≠r Chonaill was evidently allied in marriage with Clann Suibhne.Simms (2008) pp. 166, 171 fig. 1; Parkes (2006) p. 368 n. 19; McGettigan (2005); O'Byrne (2005); Simms (2004); Simms (2000) p. 122. According to the sixteenth-century pedigrees of the U√≠ Domhnaill, a daughter of a certain Mac Suibhne was the mother of Domhnall √ìg's son and successor, Aodh.Duffy (2013) pp. 131‚Äì132; Nicholls (2007) p. 93, 93 n. 49; Duffy (2002) p. 61; Duffy (1993) p. 153; Walsh (1938) p. 377; Walsh (1920) p. xvii, xvii n. 13. In fact, Domhnall √ìg was himself fostered amongst Clann Suibhne,Duffy (2013) p. 131; Simms (2008) p. 166; Duffy (2007) p. 20; Simms (2007) p. 107; Parkes (2006) p. 368 n. 19; Simms (2004); Duffy (1993) pp. 127, 153. as evidenced by a contemporary poem composed by Giolla Brighde Mac Con Midhe.Duffy (2007) p. 20; Simms (2007) p. 107; McLeod (2005b) pp. 42‚Äì43; Duffy (1993) pp. 127, 153; McKenna (1946) pp. 40, 42 ¬ß 22, 44 ¬ß 22. Aodh was first inaugurated as king in 1281. The fact that his mother is unlikely to have been born much later than 1250 suggests that she was not a daughter of E√≥in.Nicholls (2007) p. 93 n. 49. Nevertheless, Leabhar Clainne Suibhne claims that E√≥in, by way of a daughter named Caiter√≠ona, was indeed Aodh's maternal grandfather.Simms (2007) p. 108; McLeod (2005b) p. 43, n. 79; Walsh (1920) pp. xvii, xxi, 20‚Äì21 ¬ß 16. In September 1286, members of the faction concluded a pact, known as the Turnberry Band, in which certain Scottish and Anglo-Irish magnates pledged to support one another.Holton (2017) pp. 148‚Äì149; Petre (2015) p. 606; Penman, M (2014) pp. 25‚Äì26; Penman, MA (2014) pp. 63‚Äì64, 63 n. 2; Duffy (2013); McNamee (2012a) ch. 2 ¬∂ 19; McNamee (2012b) ch. introduction ¬∂ 15; Young; Stead (2010a) p. 30; Young; Stead (2010b) p. 48; Hartland (2007) pp. 343‚Äì344; Barrow (2005) pp. 24‚Äì25, 75‚Äì76; Barrow; Royan (2004) pp. 172‚Äì173; Brown, M (2004) p. 256; Duffy (2004); Blakely (2003) p. 110, 110 nn. 55‚Äì56; McDonald (1997) pp. 161‚Äì162; Roberts (1997) p. 129; Duffy (1993) pp. 151, 154, 206; Barrow (1990) p. 129; Munro; Munro (1986) p. 281; Reid, N (1982) pp. 76‚Äì78; Reid, NH (1984) pp. 57‚Äì58; Lamont (1981) p. 160; Duncan (1966) p. 188; Fraser (1888b) pp. xxxi ¬ß 12, 219‚Äì220; Stevenson (1870) pp. 22‚Äì23 ¬ß 12; Document 3/0/0 (n.d.). Three of the cosignatories were members of the Stewart/Menteith kindred: Walter, and his two sons, Alexander and John. The participation of these men in the band could have also concerned their family's part in the annexation of the Clann Suibhne lordship in Argyll. Forced from its homeland, Clann Suibhne evidently found a safe haven in T√≠r Chonaill on account of its marital alliance with Domhnall √ìg.Duffy (2013) pp. 131‚Äì132. Another cosignatory was Richard, son of the man in whose prison Murchadh Mac Suibhne died in 1267.Duffy (2013) p. 132. As such, it is conceivable that the Stewart/Menteith aspect of the band concerned the continued threat that the family faced from Clann Suibhne, now seemingly seated in T√≠r Chonaill, and backed by Aodh. Likewise, the part played by the Earl of Ulster in Murchadh Mac Suibhne's demise could be evidence that this comital family of de Burgh was opposed to the settlement of Clann Suibhne in Ireland, and therefore aligned with the Stewarts/Menteiths in regard to the fate of Clann Suibhne.Duffy (2013) p. 132; Duffy (1993) pp. 153‚Äì154. Two other cosignatories were Aonghus M√≥r mac Domhnaill, Lord of Islay, and his succeeding son, Alasdair √ìg, leading members of Clann Domhnaill. It is evident that a daughter of Aonghus M√≥r was married to Domhnall √ìg,Duffy (2013) p. 132; Duffy (2007) pp. 1, 16; Sellar (2000) p. 194 tab. ii; Simms (2000) p. 122; Duffy (1993) p. 127 n. 63; Walsh (1938) p. 377; Walsh (1920) p. xvii n. 13. and that this woman was the mother of Domhnall √ìg's son, Toirdhealbhach.Duffy (2013) p. 132; Simms (2008) pp. 166, 171 fig. 1; Duffy (2007) p. 1; Duffy (2002) p. 61; Simms (2000) p. 122; Duffy (1993) p. 154. As such, the participation of Aonghus M√≥r and Alasdair √ìg in the band could well have concerned an attempt to install Toirdhealbhach‚Äîmatrilineally descended from Clann Domhnaill‚Äîas King of T√≠r Chonaill over the competing claims of this man's opposing half-brother, Aodh‚Äîmatrilineally descended from Clann Suibhne.Duffy (1993) p. 154.

Whether this clash was a direct result of the bond is uncertain, although it seems likely that Aonghus M√≥r's part in the pact concerned the value of his kindred's military might.Duffy (2013) pp. 132‚Äì133. When Toirdhealbhach was defeated again in 1295, the Annals of the Four Masters reports that he was forced from T√≠r Chonaill, and found sanctuary with Cine√°l Eoghain and Clann Domhnaill.Annals of the Four Masters (2013a) ¬ß 1295.3; Annals of the Four Masters (2013b) ¬ß 1295.3; Duffy (2013) pp. 132‚Äì133 n. 43; Duffy (2002) p. 61.

He played college football at Princeton University and was a consensus All- American in 1901. He also played for Princeton's baseball and track teams. In 1902, he won the intercollegiate championship in the hammer throw and set a collegiate record with a throw of 164 feet, 10 inches. Early years Davis was born in approximately 1880. Davis grew up in Blossburg, Pennsylvania and attended preparatory school at Andover. He was the captain of the football team at Andover. Princeton Davis attended Princeton University and played for the Princeton Tigers football team from 1900 to 1902. While attending Princeton, Davis was five feet, seven inches tall and weighed 168 pounds. He played at the tackle position as a freshman and became an end as a sophomore. Davis was selected as a consensus All-American at the end position in 1901. He was also the captain of Princeton's 1902 football team. However, in the summer of 1902, it was announced that Davis may be academically ineligible, having failed to pass his examinations and would be required to repeat his sophomore year at Princeton. Davis was able to preserve his eligibility and served as the captain of Princeton's 1902 football team. In December 1902, a banquet honoring Davis was held at the Tiger Inn. Princeton's president Woodrow Wilson (later President of the United States) made the principal address, expressing admiration for Davis's conduct on the field as well as his \\"attitude both toward the team and the Faculty.\\" Davis had earlier faced controversy over his eligibility to play for Princeton's baseball team when it was revealed that he had played for a professional team in Atlantic City, New Jersey. His eligibility was preserved as Davis had not been paid for his participation on the Atlantic City club. Davis did play for Princeton's baseball team. He also was a member of Princeton's track team. In May 1902, he broke the intercollegiate record and won the intercollegiate hammer throw championship in 1902 with a throw of 164 feet, 10 inches. He also finished in third place in the shot put at the 1902 intercollegiate championship. Upon graduation in 1904, Davis was voted the \\"best all-around athlete\\" by his classmates. Later years Davis later worked and lived in Indianapolis, Indiana. In 1919, he was employed as district manager of the United States Tire Company. Davis died in 1934 at his home in Indianapolis. In 1939, Davis's former classmates created a scholarship fund in his name to be awarded to allow a student from Phillips Academy to attend Princeton.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 13, 1999. The episode was written by Brian Kelley and directed by Brian Sheesley. This episode introduces the recurring character Zapp Brannigan when he attempts to prevent the Planet Express crew from completing their mission. It also introduces the characters of Kif Kroker, Brannigan's aide, and Nibbler, whom Leela adopts as a pet. Plot Leela has had a series of unsuccessful dates (her latest being the one from the cold opening where the date is initially going well until she discovers her date's \\"vile lizard tongue\\"), so Amy and the others take her to The Hip Joint to meet eligible bachelors. While everyone else leaves with a date, Leela rejects several prospective companions and leaves alone. The next day, Professor Farnsworth sends the crew on a \\"tax-deductible mission of charity\\": the uninhabited planet Vergon 6 has been mined hollow for its dark matter, an incredibly dense substance that is valued as starship fuel, and its imminent collapse will render all of the native animal species extinct. Farnsworth instructs the crew to recover two of each kind of animal native to the planet for breeding purposes √† la Noah's Ark. As the crew arrives in the Vergon system, they find a security cordon put in place around the planet by the starship Nimbus, which Leela recognizes as the flagship of famed space captain Zapp Brannigan. Upon docking with the ship and coming aboard, the Planet Express crew meet Zapp and his long-suffering executive officer, Lieutenant Kif Kroker. Though Leela is initially flattered to meet Zapp, relations later turn sour when Zapp rejects Leela's request for help in saving the animals of Vergon 6; the Democratic Order of Planets (D.O.O.P.) has declared Vergon 6 restricted, as interfering with undeveloped worlds is forbidden (even though it was a D.O.O.P. mining crew that mined it hollow in the first place). When Leela defies Zapp's orders to stay away from Vergon 6, Zapp throws the Planet Express crew in prison. At night, Zapp summons Leela to his chambers, where she rebuffs his poor attempts at seduction. When Leela declares that she would rather be in prison than \\"spend an evening with the Zapper\\", Zapp breaks down crying, saying that he feels lonely in his job and that he had hoped Leela, a fellow captain, would understand. Overcome with pity, Leela eventually has sex with Zapp, but wakes up the next morning in horror after she realizes what has happened. As Leela tries to sneak away, Zapp lets her go, releases the crew and allows them to travel to Vergon 6, believing that Leela will crawl back to him. Leela names the unknown creature \\"Nibbler\\". While collecting the animals on their checklist, the crew discovers a small black creature with a third eye on a stalk attached to its head. Even though it is not on the list, Leela decides to rescue it as well, names it Nibbler, and places it in the cargo hold with the other animals. When Fry, Leela, and Bender return with the last animal, they discover that the mystery creature has devoured all the other animals. The planet begins to collapse, and when the crew tries to escape, they discover that the ship is out of fuel. After admitting what happened the previous night, Leela initially refuses to ask Zapp Brannigan for assistance, but finally relents in order to save her crew. Zapp says that he will only help them if they leave Nibbler behind, so Leela rejects his offer and tells him off. With no apparent hope of rescue, the crew resign themselves to death. Nibbler then excretes a small pellet of dark matter, enough to enable the ship to escape the planet. As Vergon 6 implodes, the crew returns to Earth, while some of the native animals find refuge on the nearby asteroids. Production When the Zapp Brannigan role was originally cast, the creators chose Saturday Night Live alumnus and semi-frequent Simpsons voice actor Phil Hartman. When Hartman was murdered by his wife in 1998, however, the role was given to Billy West (who was already cast as Phillip Fry, Professor Farnsworth, Dr. Zoidberg, and others). Though David X. Cohen credits West with using his own take on the character, West has stated that he did imitate Hartman to a certain extent in his portrayal, along with modelling it after some \\"big, old-time dumb announcers\\" with whom Phil and himself had been fascinated. Billy West also did the voice of the entity of pure energy that Amy introduced to Leela. According to DVD commentary, during West's recording for that character, the studio was shut down because the producers and audio engineers thought there was a feedback problem (because of how high and cracking the voice was), not knowing until later that Billy West can produce that kind of vocal effect naturally. The painting in Zapp's \\"Lovenasium\\" is an imitation of John F. Kennedy's official presidential portrait.  Broadcast and reception  In 2006, IGN listed this episode as number two in their list of the top 25 Futurama episodes, noting particularly the scenes between Leela and Brannigan in his quarters and the resulting hilarity. The episode was dropped off the list in IGN's 2013 reassessment. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A, stating, \\"'Love‚Äôs Labours Lost In Space' is a stronger episode than 'I, Roommate' for a few reasons. It helps to see the show finally exploring some place that isn‚Äôt immediately familiar; unlike apartment hunting or even the Moon, Vergon 6 is unusual enough to expand the scope of the show‚Äôs possibilities. The montage of the crew trying to capture various bizarre animals is inventive and clever, and the fact that the story has a legitimate genre feel to it is a nice change of pace from the previous two episodes. And the story is just better structured. The fact that Nibbler excretes dark matter (aka starship fuel) is maybe a cheat, but it‚Äôs an earned cheat; the actual crux of the plot happens when Leela, faced with a choice between dying on the collapsing planet and throwing her new pet out an airlock, chooses death. It establishes Leela as legitimately heroic, even if she doesn‚Äôt have a plan to save everyone, and it leaves Zapp the loser, which is as it should be.\\"Handlen, Zack  References   External links   Love's Labours Lost in Space at About.com  Category:Futurama (season 1) episodes Category:1999 American television episodes ","title":"Love's Labours Lost in Space"},{"id":"38323557","text":"Veronica Calabrese (born November 7, 1987 in Mesagne, Brindisi) is an Italian taekwondo practitioner.

The game was released in Korea on January 15, 2013, Europe and North America on September 16, 2014. ArcheAge is described as a \\"sandpark\\" MMORPG, which the developers say is a hybrid of the open content style of a \\"sandbox\\" game and the more structured play experience of a \\"themepark\\" game. Development Initial development of ArcheAge began in 2006, and closed testing of the game took place over two years. Before finally being released in Korea on January 15, 2013, the game went through five closed beta tests and one open beta test. In 2012, an XL Games studio representative said he expected ArcheAge to be released in North America towards the end of 2013, or the beginning of 2014. In 2014 a newly hired CM stated the game will be transitioning into beta phase and will release for North America and the EU in 2014. Announcements made in July, indicate the launch of the beta phase for July 17, 2014. On April 24, 2014, Trion began to offer founder packs, for early alpha and beta access. =Game updates= On April the 28th 2015, Trion launched an extensive content patch (1.7), called The Dread Prophecies. The new content patch features new zones, ship customization, and modifications for more realistic sea combat. On September 12-13th, Trion launched the next content update patch (2.0), called Heroes Awaken. The new content features a new Heroes system in which players elect each other once a month to represent their faction. Along with the content update, several servers were merged. Gameplay Typical in-game scenery with player using a glider (upper right corner). ArcheAge features a zoneless world with first or third person view. =Combat= In addition to traditional combat settings, ArcheAge offers naval combat in such settings where players have to secure trade routes or engage in sea-land battles. Ships need to be built and equipped with weaponry and manpower and fights can be between players or against sea monsters. Player vs player (PvP) Many of the game zones allow for open world PvP. Players can freely attack other players who are members of the other factions (East, West or Pirate). Intra- faction PvP is possible if one player flags for 'bloodlust' mode; the player flagging and attacking in this manner will generate crime evidence and can face jail time. Several regular world events also promote open world PvP, such as the Halcyona War and the Abyssal Attack. =Crafting= The crafting system in ArcheAge is extensive, allowing crafting of, among other things, equipment, food, vehicles, and furniture for the player-owned homes. Crafting grants players \\"proficiency\\" levels, which unlock new crafting options. =Housing= The housing system allows players to construct buildings in designated, non- instanced zones throughout the world using a free-placement method. These buildings allow players to decorate their interiors/exteriors with both cosmetic and functional furnishings. Housing options range from small one- story cottages to large three-story mansions with their sizes directly affecting the amount of space required to place their foundations. Players must pay taxes on the land where they place their houses or run the risk of having them destroyed and losing some or all of the possessions therein. Most houses have a small area surrounding them that serves as space for farming. By purifying an Archeum Crystal on the northern continent of Auroria, player guilds can claim land upon which to construct castles. These castles grant lordship over the surrounding area with taxes paid on the property within being collectable periodically by the guild's leader. A castle's primary focus is the defense of the Archeum Crystal during sieges. Should the Archeum Crystal be overtaken, the attacking guild gains ownership of the Crystal and the surrounding castle. Land ownership is limited to \\"Patron\\" status holders. While the simplest manner to attain Patron status is to pay the subscription fee to Trion, free players can use in-game gold to purchase \\"Apex,\\" a type of coin sold by Trion for $10 to paying players, but freely tradable within the game. Apex can be used to purchase patron status, enabling free players to own land without paying Trion directly. Farming After completing a quest early in a character's development, the ability to place a garden is obtained through the use of a scarecrow design. Further along in the character's development, a larger farm design becomes available. Using these designs, players are capable of claiming plots of land, typically in designated areas, where they can choose to raise a variety of plant and animal life. Only the owner of a farm, or those given permission by the owner, may access the farm and manage its contents. Players may also choose to plant their crops/trees/livestock in the open world but run the risk of other players stealing the contents, for which the transgressing player may receive crime points and eventually stand trial. Each plant or animal has a set length of time required for it to mature and become harvestable, with expedited growth in suitable climates. Usually, once matured, these plants and animals can be maintained for sustained yields, or picked/slaughtered/chopped down to clear the space and gather base materials. Upkeep involves feeding and occasionally medicating animals, watering plant life and gathering from trees with failing to do so in a timely manner resulting in the withering and eventual death of any plant or animal life. Some animals are capable of mating, producing offspring that may be capable of being raised as a mount or battle pet, though the chances of this happening are extremely rare. Players may choose to uproot plants or needlessly slaughter animals before they are fully matured. Doing so will result in the removal of the plant or animal and has a chance to yield a small return, though typically will result in a loss of the initial item. As with housing, farms require a tax to be paid in order to maintain ownership of the plots upon which they are placed. Taxes increase exponentially with each additional property owned. Failure to pay these taxes will result in the scarecrow being made vulnerable to attack, allowing players to destroy it and claim the plot for themselves. =Mounts and pets= ArcheAge has a pet system with pets being bought as babies and trained to grow into mounts or battle companions. Pets/mounts level up with distance traveled or experience gained during combat. They can be killed in battle, resurrected and suffer resurrection disease which can be healed at a stable. Pets/mounts have equipment slots like player characters. =Criminal justice= ArcheAge contains a judicial system with player run courts. Players can choose to answer jury summons and judge players who have committed crimes of theft or murder. There are minimum and maximum sentences that are determined by vote among the jurors. The system is a fundamental game mechanic, and not built to combat intentional \\"griefing\\" by players. Criminal players are imprisoned and can pay off their debt by working in the prison or trying to escape through digging their way out. Players are able to escape from the prison, however they are unable to use any abilities for the duration of their sentence. The development team has stated they may introduce a bribery system that would enable the accused player to bribe jurors. =Questing= Swimming in the ocean, a typical in-game scene. The early-bird system lets players submit quests which are not yet completely finished, in exchange for reduced experience rewards. The opposite effect is overachieving, by gaining additional quest objectives, resulting in bonus experience. Hidden quests are available too, which can be unlocked by reaching special achievements. =Skills= The skill system of ArcheAge is very flexible as one chooses three basic skill types from a selection of eleven and can thus can create one's own \\"class\\" which is then leveled based in improvement. These classes can be changed at any time at a specific NPC however it does cost in-game currency to do so and can become expensive. =Trade Routes= Trading routes are a very effective way to make money or if one chooses \\"Gilda Stars\\" to unlock building or castle plans. A player gathers or farms specific materials in order to craft resources at a destination specific terminal and walks or rides them to a corresponding trading post merchant. Upon creating the resource (example: farm strawberries to create strawberry jam), this resource is then placed in a pack on a player and the player is unable to walk at full speed. This makes using the public transportation system (automated bus carts and airships) essential for the fast transportation of these goods. The further the trading post is from the crafting terminal, the higher the reward a player will receive. However, if the player is in neutral land, other players are free to kill them and take the player's pack. A player can place the pack on the ground whenever they wish to fight and pick it back up. Using a mount while carrying a pack will slow it down too (the fastest mount with a pack being a donkey), but packs can be stored in player-made vehicles (farm cart, ships). =Travel= There are many options for travel in ArcheAge, including walking, climbing (ladders, vines, trees), swimming, personal mounts and personal boats (from row boats to catamarans to galleons), as well as personal gliders or car-like machines such as tractors for transport of larger amounts of goods. There are predetermined travel routes by airships, taxi-like vehicles and portals too. Travel is fully 3-dimensional in ArcheAge; thus swimming and diving are possible. Diving can be improved with diving equipment. There is underwater planting, harvesting and gathering of resources along with underwater treasure hunting. Some mounts allow players to backpack with another player upon invitation. Boats can be used in a similar fashion to transport other players with one player acting as driver. Gliders A unique mode of transportation is the glider, which can be equipped and upgraded. Gliders allow a limited form of flight, limited either by starting height or by a fixed time limit, depending on the specific glider in use. The Pegasus and Griffin are mounts that also functions as a glider. Game technology and special features ArcheAge makes use of modern graphics effects like tessellation and ambient occlusion and contains a physics engine. ArcheAge uses player collision, unlike many other MMO's, thus player movement can be blocked by other players or NPC's. =ArcheAge: Unchained= ArcheAge: Unchained was announced in August 2019 and launched on Steam and Glyph on October 15, 2019. It has the same content and the same updates as ArcheAge but features a new monetization model that players buy one of three packs for one payment upfront, so there is no subscription and everyone is effectively a Patron in Unchained. The Marketplace does not offer gameplay advantages anymore but is purely cosmetic. Archepass was added, similar in style to a Battlepass offered for various games. Using a tier system, there are two paths just like other Battlepass systems. One is the basic free path where all items that may be considered pay-to-win previously is housed. The other is a premium path which houses cosmetic items. This is a separate game, so there are no carrying over characters and items from ArcheAge, it is a new beginning. =Security= The game client currently uses Easy Anti-Cheat. Previously, Hackshield was used, and there are plans to use GameGuard in the future. Lore The story is based on The ArcheAge Chronicles, by the Korean author Jeon Min-hee. The plot outlines the struggle between the forces of good vs evil and heroes who set out to change the future in their favor. Reception ArcheAge has received generally favorable reviews from critics, currently holding a score of 80 out of 100 on Metacritic.

After learning of the Scottish army's defeat at the battle of Falkirk, he offered fealty to Edward I and was granted the Isle of Arran.Watson, p.68 He led a fleet of ships of the North Channel with John of Argyll during the winter of 1306. Hugh was ordered to join the Admirals of the Fleet, John de Botetourt and Simon Montagu to search for the fugitive King Robert I of Scotland in January 1307. Hugh appears to have changed sides between England and Scotland when it suited. Hugh lost lands in Ireland for his betrayal against Edward I and later King Edward II of England.

In December 1911 he was appointed interior minister and de facto prime minister in the Bogd Khan's first government of Autonomous Mongolia, a position he held until T√∂gs-Ochiryn Namnans√ºren officially became the first prime minister in July 1912. Early life and career Tserenchimed was born in 1869 in present-day Kh√∂vsg√∂l Province. He entered a monastery at an early age, became a lama, and then started work as low level clerk in the office of the Shamzudba (the Secular Affairs Administration office) of the estates of the Bogd Khan Ikh Shav), quickly climbing his way up to become Da Lam (Chief Lama or Abbot). He showed a talent for politics early on and established excellent working relations with local political officials. Around this time he began to support calls for Mongolian independence. In July 1911 Tserenchimed was one of several high- ranking lamas and hereditary princes summoned to Kh√ºree (present day Ulaanbaatar) by the Bogd Khan to discuss independence. The Bogd Khan then named him a member of a delegation, along with Namnans√ºren, that traveled to Saint Petersburg to seek Czarist Russian and West European support for Mongolian independence from Chinese rule. The young Bogd Khan In November 1911 he was named head of General Administration Office of Khalkh Affairs in the provisional Mongolian government set up as Qing Dynasty collapsed in China. The only commoner in Bogd Khan's government, he was then appointed interior minister in the first government of the newly established Autonomous Mongolia in early 1912, a position that was recognized as a de facto prime ministry, until the establishment in July 1912 of office of prime minister and appointment of Namnans√ºren to the position.Sanders 2010, p. 708 Tserenchimed had established close ties to the Chinese Kuomintang nationalists and the Japanese. In 1913 he attempted to travel to Tokyo to seek Japanese recognition of Mongolian independence and assistance in uniting northern and southern Mongolians but was turned back at Harbin by Russian officials. In 1914 he was removed from his position as minister of interior and reassigned to be minister for pacification of western frontier.

It took place on January 1, 2010, at Arena Naucalpan in Naucalpan, State of Mexico. The focal point of the show was the Torneo Relampago de Proyeccion a Nuevas Promesas de la Lucha Libre tag team tournament where eight teams competed for the trophy. In 2012 the tournament was renamed El Protector but the tournament concept remained the same. This event was also the 14th IWRG Anniversary Show. Production =Background= Lucha Libre has a tradition for a tournament where a rookie, or novato, would be teamed up with an experienced veteran wrestler for a tag team tournament in the hopes of giving the Novato a chance to show case their talent and move up the ranks. Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre has held a Torneo Gran Alternativa (\\"Great Alternative Tournament\\") almost every year since 1994, but the concept predates the creation of the Gran Alternativa. The Mexican professional wrestling company International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG; at times referred to as Grupo Internacional Revoluci√≥n in Mexico) started their own annual rookie/veteran tournament in 2010. The first two tournaments were called Torneo Relampago de Proyeccion a Nuevas Promesas de la Lucha Libre (Spanish for \\"Projecting a new promise lightning tournament\\") but would be renamed the El Protector tournament in 2012. The Proyeccion a Nuevas Promesas shows, as well as the majority of the IWRG shows in general, are held in \\"Arena Naucalpan\\", owned by the promoters of IWRG and their main arena. The 2010 Proyeccion a Nuevas Promesas show was the first time that IWRG promoted a show around the rookie/veteran tournament, with the name changing to El Protector in 2012 and onwards. =Storylines= The event featured nine professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre- existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. =Tournament participants= *Tetsuya Bushi and Guerrero 2000 *Comando Negro and Oficial 911 *Dinamic Black and Chico Che *Alan Extreme and Black Terry *Guizmo and Ultraman, Jr. *Hijo del Signo and Dr. Cerebro *Imperial and Rocket *Keshin Black and Veneno Results References  External links  * Category:2010 in professional wrestling Category:2010 in Mexico 2010 Category:January 2010 events in Mexico 14 ","title":"Proyeccion a Nuevas Promesas (2010)"},{"id":"38323872","title":"List of battles fought in Colorado"},{"id":"38323882","text":"Hedgebrook is an American publicly traded company listed on the OTC Bulletin Board and headquartered in Ashland, Oregon that focuses on mergers and acquisitions in various industries, including aerospace, consumer, energy and health care.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. With The church was organized and founded in 1874 in conjunction with the founding of Colorado College. The first two ministers of the church, Rev. Jonathan Edwards and Rev. James Dougherty, also held positions with the college. The present building was completed in 1889 at an estimated cost of $40,000. Its design is in the Richardsonian Romanesque style and is constructed of Colorado Wall Mountain Tuft (rhyolite) quarried near Castle Rock, Colorado. The architect was Henry Rutgers Marshall of New York, acclaimed student of Henry Hobson Richardson, and there is only one other church known to have been designed by him: Arlington Avenue Presbyterian Church in Brooklyn, NY (1905, Arlington Avenue Presbyterian Church ‚Äì Brooklyn, NY ). The first service in the current building was James Greggheld on 21 July 1889 and the new building soon became a landmark in Colorado Springs. An early article in the then Weekly Gazette newspaper commented that ‚Äúthe design of the building is unique and has attracted much attention and admiration.‚Äù James Gregg ‚ÄúSurely few churches there are with so many pillars. The many pillars in our portico seem suggestive of the spiritual life of the church within, its strength, its dignity, its peace.‚Äù ‚Äì Dr. James Gregg, October 1914 The cornerstone of the present church was laid on September 8, 1888, and the first services were held in the new building on July 21, 1889. Dedication was delayed until October, however, when the pipe organ crafted by Hook and Hastings of Boston was installed. Our faith community has been housed in this structure ever since, making our facility the oldest church building in Colorado Springs continuously used by the same congregation. The First Congregational Church was placed on the National Register on October 31, 2002. In partnership with the Colorado Historical Society's State Historical Fund, the church and Founders‚Äô Room addition (1903) have undergone restoration to their 1910 appearance. Sanctuary InteriorThe interior of the church is in the plan of a Greek cross with an octagonal dome rising above the north nave. The lower walls of the Sanctuary are paneled in light oak to match the pews with notable stained glass throughout. The original organ was designed by Hook and Hastings of Boston and is the oldest organ in continuous use in Colorado Springs. Additions to the present building include the Founders Room in 1903, the Christian Education Building in 1959 and the Atrium in 1996. Alterations and improvement were made to the main building in 1910 and extensive restoration work to the interior of the building was completed in 2011. Gregg Library The Gregg Library: The importance of books and a library has always been a significant part of First Congregational Church's history. When the present sanctuary was built in 1888-89, a library was included, shelved on one wall of the Sacristy. The library found a new home 46 years later in a small frame house sitting on the church's west side. That house was bought and donated to the church in memory of Rev. James B. Gregg, who served as pastor for 27 years. It was named the Gregg Memorial Library Building. The building housed a study and classrooms. In addition, Dr. Gregg's children gave a $10,000 bequest dedicated to the library. That bequest still funds the library's budget today. The Gregg Library is located in the West Building attached to the church. References *Walking Tour, City of Colorado Springs Historic Preservation Board. North Downtown Historic Resources.

The highway was designated in 1939, and was shortened in 1970. The designation originally contained all roads within the park. Route description The entrance to Washington-on-the-Brazos State Historic Site, with PR 12 passing through the center of the image PR 12 begins at an at-grade intersection with FM 1155 just outside the border of the State Historic Site. The highway begins as a two-lane, paved road. The road proceeds eastward for a short distance before bending northeastward. The roadway continues northeast through dense trees before reaching its northern terminus, an at-grade intersection with a small park road. History Park Road 12 was first designated on September 26, 1939, as a redesignation of State Highway 229. The highway began at State Highway 90, and included all drives in Old Washington State Park, as the park was known at that time. On February 5, 1954, SH 90 was rerouted off of the road on the north end of PR 12, and the old route of SH 90 that intersected PR 12 was redesignated as FM 912 (SH 105 replaced this section of SH 90 on February 28, 1973). On March 5, 1963, FM 1155 extended north replacing the section of FM 912 at the north end of PR 12, meaning the north end was at FM 1155. On October 2, 1970, the Texas Highway Commission passed an order to remove most of the roads in the park road the PR 12 designation. This decision was approved on October 15 of the same year, and removed approximately from the route.

It originally aired on NBC on February 7, 2013. The episode features return guest appearances from Melora Hardin, Andy Buckley, and Chris Diamantopoulos. The series‚Äîpresented as if it were a real documentary‚Äîdepicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In the episode, the office pairs into couples so that they may all be able to take advantage of a Valentine's Day discount at a mini-mall. After Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) returns from his boat trip, Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) decides that she is going to break up with him so that she can be with Pete Miller (Jake Lacy), but Pete begins to doubt her. Meanwhile, Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) and Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) share lunch with Brian (Chris Diamantopoulos). \\"Couples Discount\\" received mixed reviews from television critics and was viewed by 4.15 million viewers and received 2.1/6% share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. The episode ultimately ranked fourth in its timeslot. Despite this, The Office ranked as the highest-rated NBC series of the night. Synopsis The office pairs into couples so they may all be able to take advantage of a Valentine's Day discount at a nail salon in a local mini-mall and enjoy one last boss-free day before Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) returns from his three-month boating sojourn. Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) decides that she is going to break up with Andy so she can be with Pete Miller (Jake Lacy), but he begins to doubt her because she goes to inordinate lengths to make their last day without Andy a happy one. Andy surprises everyone by showing up a day early and proceeds to alienate the entire office through a series of selfish and arrogant actions: he arrives at work without having washed or shaved since he left, he unwittingly wrecks Dwight Schrute's (Rainn Wilson) record-setting sale with the Scranton White Pages while trying to reassert his authority as boss, shows no shame at accepting all of his absentee paychecks and a \\"merit bonus\\" because the branch exceeded their quarterly sales goal while he was gone, and holds a meeting to get up to speed on recent events so he can bluff his way through a meeting with CEO David Wallace (Andy Buckley), who has no idea that Andy was gone at all. The employees decide not to tell David about Andy's unapproved absence, but at the meeting they cannot resist crafting made-up recent events in the hope that he will blow his own cover. However, when David meets with Andy he is almost completely oblivious to Andy's erroneous statements, and Andy quickly catches on to what the employees are up to. Pam (Jenna Fischer) and Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) share lunch with Brian (Chris Diamantopoulos) to thank him for protecting her from Frank. They are expecting his wife Alyssa to join him, but Brian reveals they are getting a divorce after having been fighting for a while. In an awkward attempt to lighten the mood, Brian makes a joke referencing how he consoled Pam when she broke down after her fight with Jim over the phone in \\"Customer Loyalty\\". After the lunch Jim admits, with some prodding, that he is angry that Pam did not tell him about this incident. Pam explains that she had not wanted to add to his worries, which only makes Jim angrier, but he brushes the matter off to avoid an argument. The couple had planned on sharing an evening bottle of wine for Valentine's Day, but Jim later tells Pam he wants to go down to Philadelphia instead because he fears they would only end up fighting. Pam initially accepts this, but realizing that the silence between them is worse than fighting, she tells Jim he should stay and fight with her, and Jim agrees. At the end of the day, Erin tries to break up with Andy, saying she no longer loves him and is angry that he left and barely communicated with her. Andy vehemently protests the breakup and says their relationship can work out if she just pretends to still love him. Erin walks outside to Pete, saying she could not do it. Pete tells her he is okay with this, since all he wants is for her to be happy. Emboldened by his selfless response, she kisses him, runs back up to Andy's office, and breaks up with him. In her brief breakup speech she repeats her complaints about his three-month absence, not realizing that he is talking to David on speakerphone. Production The episode marks the return of series regular Ed Helms, after departing the series for several episodes. \\"Couples Discount\\" was written by co-executive producer Allison Silverman, marking her second writing credit for the season after \\"Roy's Wedding\\". It was directed by Troy Miller, his third directorial credit for the series. Originally, it was reported that the episode would be titled \\"Andy's Return\\". However, it was later renamed to \\"Couples Discount\\". The episode features the return of series regular Ed Helms, who had left for several episodes to film The Hangover Part III. His character was written out for eight episodes, leaving the office on a boat trip to the Bahamas for three months with his brother Walter. Broadcast and reception =Ratings= \\"Couples Discount\\" originally aired on NBC on February 7, 2013. In its original American broadcast, the episode was viewed by an estimated 4.15 million viewers and received a 2.1 rating/6% share. This means that it was seen by 2.1 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 6 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. This marked a slight increase in the ratings from the previous episode, \\"Vandalism\\". The Office ranked fourth in its timeslot, being beaten by an episode of the ABC series Grey's Anatomy and the CBS police procedural Person of Interest, both of which received a 3.1/8 percent rating, and an installment of the Fox series Glee that received a 2.2/6 percent rating. =Reviews= \\"Couples Discount\\" received mixed reviews. The A.V. Club reviewer Erik Adams complimented the transformation of Andy into a villain, calling it \\"intriguing\\" and \\"curious\\", although he said the characterization would not \\"stick\\" to the character for the following episodes. Adams gave more praise to the subplots, particularly Jim and Pam's storyline, calling it a \\"refreshingly honest take on the vagaries of marriage\\" and compared their decision to fight at home to the early \\"Pam-and-Jim charm\\". Adams gave the episode a B-. TV.com columnist Nick Campbell complimented the choice of using Andy as a villain, for further developing the Erin-Pete relationship, which he called \\"one of two satisfying events in this episode\\". He also praised the Jim and Pam storyline and the writers for focusing on their relationship, rather than Brian, writing that their final scene was \\"almost sweet, how nervous they were about heading into the Thunderdome\\". He criticized the plot inconsistency and the nail salon plot for feeling \\"jammed in\\" and for using predictable jokes. Campbell ultimately called it a \\"satisfying episode\\". IGN's Roth Cornet was more critical towards Andy's return, writing that it serves as further example of the writers treating him as a plot device, rather than a character. Cornet continued that the episode featured \\"some fairly compelling drama, as well as some of the more cohesive moments of the season, character-wise\\", but \\"very little comedy\\". Cornet complimented the turn in the Jim-Pam-Brian storyline, and for the writers using Brian as a catalyst for a \\"real conversation between Pam and Jim\\", instead of a love triangle between the three. She also went on to praise their final scene, for showcasing \\"what The Office has created with these two characters ‚Äì a human, and real relationship.\\" Cornet gave the episode a 6.9, considering it an \\"okay\\" episode.

Dockwise Vanguard is the largest vessel of her type ever built, and is able to carry cargoes up to 110,000 tonnes. Dockwise Vanguard was designed to move offshore oil and gas facilities, but can also carry other ships and act as an offshore dry-dock facility. As offshore oil and gas facilities have grown in size, Dockwise saw a market for a ship that could carry the largest floating oil rigs to their destinations, reducing time and costs of transportation and allowing rigs to be built economically in a shipyard. In conjunction with Finland-based Deltamarin, they designed a ship called the \\"type-O heavy-lift vessel\\", later renamed Dockwise Vanguard following an in-house competition won by Gerry Sarlis and Anthony van Ginkel. In 2014, Dockwise started a feasibility study into a larger successor to Dockwise Vanguard. Design Dockwise Vanguard has a flat, bow-less deck measuring , allowing cargo longer and wider than the deck. Her deck is 70% larger than the MV Blue Marlin, the third-largest heavy- lift ship. The bridge and living area superstructure are situated at the far starboard side, and the deck also contains four movable buoyancy casings. google canched copy The watertight deck allows water to flow over the deck without risking the ship. Dockwise Vanguard is semisubmersible allowing her to lift ships or rigs out of the water, and to place them into water. When her ballast tanks are flooded, her deck lies up to below the surface, allowing her to handle deep-draught cargoes. Loads can then be floated above her, and her ballast tanks empty, allowing her to lift and transport cargoes up to 110,000 tonnes, 50% more than the Blue Marlin. She can also be loaded from a dockside, and large cargoes can be loaded by skidding them on tracks. Dockwise Vanguard can accommodate a crew of 40. Cargoes The first cargo of Dockwise Vanguard was Chevron Corporation's Jack/St. Malo oil platform, moved from Samsung Heavy Industries in South Korea to the Gulf of Mexico. At 53,000 tons, Jack/St. Malo is the biggest semisubmersible floating oil platform ever built, and was loaded in February 2013. The journey was expected to take just under two months. As of 2013, Dockwise Vanguard had orders for two more deliveries, the Goliat FPSO later in 2013, and the Aasta Hansteen spar platform in 2015, both being built by Hyundai Heavy Industries. At long, the Aasta Hansteen platform was to be, as of 2013, the largest floating spar platform produced. Dockwise Vanguard is capable of providing an offshore dry-dock facility, allowing ships and floating oil rigs to be raised out of the water for inspection or maintenance without a break in production. This was projected to be of economic value to operators by allowing maintenance without towing the rigs back to dock and taking them out of service for months. In the summer of 2013, Dockwise Vanguard was used as dry dock for the semisubmersible drilling platform Noble Paul Romano in the Grand Harbour of Valletta and just off the coast of Malta, as noy local dry docks were big enough for the rig. In the summer of 2019, BOKA Vanguard was used by Carnival Cruise Lines as a floating dry dock for repairs to the Carnival Vista's azipod system, following the closure of one of Grand Bahama Shipyard's drydocks after one of the drydock's cranes collapsed on Royal Caribbean's Oasis of the Seas. = Costa Concordia proposal = In September 2013, Dockwise Vanguard was proposed to move Costa Concordia from Isola del Giglio to a salvage yard on the Italian mainland for \\"breaking\\" and Costa Crociere announced a $30 million option with Royal Boskalis Westminster the following month to use the ship. In the event, Dockwise Vanguard was not used, and Costa Concordia was instead refloated and towed to Genoa in July 2014.

He came to Chazzanut (Cantorial music) after a long career as a singer and performer in Israel. He has published several CDs and DVDs and his music is featured in the Florida Atlantic University Judaica Sound Archives and will soon also be in the Dartmouth Jewish Sound Archives.  Early life  Udi Spielman was born in 1951 in Tel-Aviv. He is the great-grandson of Zerach Barnett, a Zionist activist, settling first Petah Tikva and the initiator and founder of Neve Shalom Tel-Aviv. Both of Spielman's grandfathers were cantors. Spielman studied at HaKfar HaYarok, an agricultural high school. After graduation, he entered the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and served as a soloist and singer in the Israeli Air Force Band.  Pop Music career  Following his honorable discharge from the IDF, Spielman recorded songs as a soloist. In 1978, Spielman performed the song \\"Nesich haChlomot\\" (◊†◊°◊ô◊ö ◊î◊ó◊ú◊ï◊û◊ï◊™, Dream Prince), better known as \\"Valentino\\" along with Zvi Bums and Gali Atari, at the Festival Hazemer Ha'ivri (Israel Song Festival), the Israeli qualification heat for the Eurovision Song Contest. The song placed third. Spielman then created the band \\"Afifon\\" (Kite), which appeared in the 1980 Israel Song Festival performing the song \\"1980\\" (lyrics by Jacob Gilad, music by Yehudit Ravitz). In the same year, he appeared in the Chassidic Song Festival, and recorded two songs for their album of the same name. Later he founded the \\"Udi Spielman Band\\" which was Israel's most acclaimed and successful pop orchestra for twenty years performing both in Israel and abroad, and became the house band for Israel's first commercial TV channel for the Israel Broadcasting Services.  Cantorial career  In 2000, Spielman retired his performing groups in order to study Chazzanut. He studied at and graduated from the Tel Aviv Cantorial Institute (TACI), administered by Cantor Naftali Hershtik, the Chief Cantor of the Great Synagogue in Jerusalem. Afterwards, Herstik referred Spielman to another teacher, who put him in touch with the greatest cantorial pianist, Raymond Goldstein. Chaim Feifel also added much to Udi's education as well. Besides his Cantorial services as a Hazzan, Udi has also performed in Cantorial concerts with the most highly regarded Hazzanim of our time. He also previously served as Artistic Director for the Concert Series of B‚Äônai Torah Congregation, the largest Conservative Synagogue in the SE United States. Since beginning his cantorial career, Spielman has launched one solo Cantorial CD (Seven ‚Äì Voice and Spirit) and two liturgical music CDs (A still Small Voice and Set Me as a Seal) with his wife, Varda Noga Spielman, former singer with the Northern Command and the popular 80's girl's band Sexsta, as well as a concert DVD in 2012.

In Sado, tanuki were called \\"mujina (Áã¢)\\", thus he was also referred to as Danzaburou-mujina (Âõ£‰∏âÈÉéÁã¢). In the Ukiyo-e, its name was written as Âêå‰∏âÁã∏.\\" Together with the Shibaemon-tanuki of Awaji Island, and the Yashima no Hage-tanuki of Kagawa, they form the \\"three famous tanuki\\" of Japan. Legend The supreme commander of the tanuki on Sado Island, most tales of Danzaburou focus on his trickery of humans. He would create wall-like structures to block people's paths at night, fooled people with mirages, and sold leaves from trees by making them look as if they were made of gold. He also created mirages to lure people into his lair (said to be a hole in the ground or a cellar), making it appear as a splendid estate. If he ever became ill, Danzaburou would disguise himself as a human and visit human doctors for treatment. His reputation was not all bad, however. He was said to have often lent money to people struggling with financial troubles, though said funds were in all likelihood obtained by him fooling people into working for him, or otherwise embezzled. Some tales actually purport that Danzaburou would repay what he stole; a story from the town of Orito (near Aikawa), reported that the tanuki left a sealed promissory note with the victim's name, the sum of money taken, and the date it was to be returned. When the day came, the victim found the note had disappeared and the payment was left in its place. Afterwards, Danzaburou was deified in Aikawa as Futatsuiwa Daimyoujin (‰∫å„Å§Â≤©Â§ßÊòéÁ•û), into which people heartily put their faith. It has been said that the reason why there are no kitsune (foxes) in Sado is that Danzaburou drove them out, detailed in two legends: *While Danzaburou was on a journey, he met a kitsune and was requested to \\"Bring me to Sado.\\" Danzaburou replied, \\"I'll bring you there, but it'll be difficult if you look like that. Please shapeshift into my z≈çri.\\" The kitsune thus shapeshifted into a z≈çri, and wearing that, Danzaburou rode on a boat. Before long, Danzaburou rode on a ship to Sado, and right in the middle of the sea, he took off his z≈çri and tossed them into the sea. Ever since, kitsune have never considered trying to cross over to Sado again. *While Danzaburou was on a journey, he met one kitsune. As opposed to the kitsune who boasted of his techniques, Sado said, \\"I'm good at disguising myself as the daimyo's procession, so I'll threaten you,\\" and disappeared. Soon after that, the daimyo's procession arrived. The kitsune jumped under a basket of a feudal lord within the procession, and mocked, \\"You surely disguised yourself well,\\" as the kitsune was seized at once and put to the sword for the crime of causing a disturbance. The procession was not Danzaburou, but the real thing, and he knew beforehand that the procession was about to pass by. There several more tales of Danzaburou's antics, but also a legend that he once lost to a man in a battle of wits, and ceased tricking humans. *Danzaburou found a young peasant, and to trick him, he disguised himself as a young woman and pretended to be in a poor state of health. The young peasant called out, and Danzaburou replied, \\"I can't move because of my stomachache.\\" The peasant thus took responsibility for sending the woman, but he somehow had a hunch that it was Danzaburou, and tied the woman up with rope. The peasant answered to the startled Danzaburou, \\"It's so you won't slide off.\\" Danzaburou, feeling a sense of danger, desperately pleaded, \\"Let me off.\\" The peasant asked \\"Even though you're in bad health, why do you want to get off?\\" and did not let Danzaburou off, and Danzaburou replied \\"... I want to go pee,\\" but the peasant laughed, \\"If a beautiful girl like you will pee, I want to see it. Do it on my back,\\" and did not let Danzaburou off at all. Before long, they arrived at what was the peasant's house. Danzaburou said, \\"Isn't this my home?\\" and the peasant said, \\"Danzaburou, I know who you actually are!\\" and harshly chastised the earnestly apologizing Danzaburou. Ever since, Danzaburou did not try fooling humans again. Possible origin In Meireki ‰∏â (AD 1657), tanuki were farmed and their skins were used in the crafting of bellows. Danzaburou was the name of a human merchant in Echigo, who purportedly began caring for and trying to conserve the tanuki in Sado, and became widely respected on the island. Theory states that the tanuki itself was later worshiped as an ujigami. In popular culture *Danzaburou appears as a boss character in the 2013 video game Muramasa Rebirth. He takes several forms over the course of the battle, including a cyclops and a pair of rokurokubi.

While DNA as a storage medium has enormous potential because of its high storage density, its practical use is currently severely limited because of its high cost and very slow read and write times. In June 2019, scientists reported that all 16 GB of text from Wikipedia's English-language version have been encoded into synthetic DNA.  Cell free  Currently the most wide spread DNA sequencing technology in use is one developed by Illumina which involves immobilization of single stranded DNA on a solid support, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the sequences, and labeling of the individual DNA bases with complementary bases tagged with fluorescent markers (see Illumina dye sequencing). The fluorescence pattern (a different color for each of the four DNA bases) can then be captured in an image and processed to determine the DNA sequence. A recently developed alternative is the nanopore technology in which DNA molecules are passed through a nano scale pore under the control of a ratcheting enzyme. The passage of the DNA molecules causes small change in electrical current that can be measured. The main advantage of the nanopore technology is that it can be read in real time. However the read accuracy of this technology is currently insufficient for data storage.  In vivo  The genetic code within living organisms can potentially be co-opted to store information. Furthermore synthetic biology can be used to engineer cells with \\"molecular recorders\\" to allow the storage and retrieval information stored in the cell's genetic material. CRISPR gene editing can also be used to insert artificial DNA sequences into the genome of the cell.  History  The idea of DNA digital data storage dates back to 1959, when the physicist Richard P. Feynman, in \\"There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom: An Invitation to Enter a New Field of Physics\\" outlined the general prospects for the creation of artificial objects similar to objects of the microcosm (including biological) and having similar or even more extensive capabilities. In 1964-65 Mikhail Samoilovich Neiman, the Soviet physicist, published 3 articles about microminiaturization in electronics at the molecular-atomic level, which independently presented general considerations and some calculations regarding the possibility of recording, storage, and retrieval of information on synthesized DNA and RNA molecules. After the publication of the first M.S. Neiman's paper and after receiving by Editor the manuscript of his second paper (January, the 8th, 1964, as indicated in that paper) the interview with cybernetician Norbert Wiener was published. N. Wiener expressed ideas about miniaturization of computer memory, close to the ideas, proposed by M. S. Neiman independently. These Wiener's ideas M. S. Neiman mentioned in the third of his papers. One of the earliest uses of DNA storage occurred in a 1988 collaboration between artist Joe Davis and researchers from Harvard. The image, stored in a DNA sequence in E.coli, was organized in a 5 x 7 matrix that, once decoded, formed a picture of an ancient Germanic rune representing life and the female Earth. In the matrix, ones corresponded to dark pixels while zeros corresponded to light pixels. In 2007 a device was created at the University of Arizona using addressing molecules to encode mismatch sites within a DNA strand. These mismatches were then able to be read out by performing a restriction digest, thereby recovering the data. In 2011, George Church, Sri Kosuri, and Yuan Gao carried out an experiment that would encode a 659-kb book that was co-authored by Church. To do this, the research team did a two-to-one correspondence where a binary zero was represented by either an adenine or cytosine and a binary one was represented by a guanine or thymine. After examination, 22 errors were found in the DNA. In 2012, George Church and colleagues at Harvard University published an article in which DNA was encoded with digital information that included an HTML draft of a 53,400 word book written by the lead researcher, eleven JPG images and one JavaScript program. Multiple copies for redundancy were added and 5.5 petabits can be stored in each cubic millimeter of DNA. The researchers used a simple code where bits were mapped one-to-one with bases, which had the shortcoming that it led to long runs of the same base, the sequencing of which is error-prone. This result showed that besides its other functions, DNA can also be another type of storage medium such as hard drives and magnetic tapes. In 2013, an article led by researchers from the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) and submitted at around the same time as the paper of Church and colleagues detailed the storage, retrieval, and reproduction of over five million bits of data. All the DNA files reproduced the information between 99.99% and 100% accuracy. The main innovations in this research were the use of an error- correcting encoding scheme to ensure the extremely low data-loss rate, as well as the idea of encoding the data in a series of overlapping short oligonucleotides identifiable through a sequence-based indexing scheme. Also, the sequences of the individual strands of DNA overlapped in such a way that each region of data was repeated four times to avoid errors. Two of these four strands were constructed backwards, also with the goal of eliminating errors. The costs per megabyte were estimated at $12,400 to encode data and $220 for retrieval. However, it was noted that the exponential decrease in DNA synthesis and sequencing costs, if it continues into the future, should make the technology cost-effective for long-term data storage by 2023. In 2013, a software called DNACloud was developed by Manish K. Gupta and co-workers to encode computer files to their DNA representation. It implements a memory efficiency version of the algorithm proposed by Goldman et al. to encode (and decode) data to DNA (.dnac files). The long-term stability of data encoded in DNA was reported in February 2015, in an article by researchers from ETH Zurich. The team added redundancy via Reed‚ÄìSolomon error correction coding and by encapsulating the DNA within silica glass spheres via Sol-gel chemistry. In 2016 research by Church and Technicolor Research and Innovation was published in which, 22 MB of a MPEG compressed movie sequence were stored and recovered from DNA. The recovery of the sequence was found to have zero errors. In March 2017, Yaniv Erlich and Dina Zielinski of Columbia University and the New York Genome Center published a method known as DNA Fountain that stored data at a density of 215 petabytes per gram of DNA. The technique approaches the Shannon capacity of DNA storage, achieving 85% of the theoretical limit. The method was not ready for large-scale use, as it costs $7000 to synthesize 2 megabytes of data and another $2000 to read it. In March 2018, University of Washington and Microsoft published results demonstrating storage and retrieval of approximately 200MB of data. The research also proposed and evaluated a method for random access of data items stored in DNA. In March 2019, the same team announced they have demonstrated a fully automated system to encode and decode data in DNA. Research published by Eurecom and Imperial College in January 2019, demonstrated the ability to store structured data in synthetic DNA. The research showed how to encode structured or, more specifically, relational data in synthetic DNA and also demonstrated how to perform data processing operations (similar to SQL) directly on the DNA as chemical processes. In June 2019, scientists reported that all 16 GB of Wikipedia have been encoded into synthetic DNA. The first article describing data storage on native DNA sequences via enzymatic nicking was published in April 2020. In the paper, scientists demonstrate a new method of recording information in DNA backbone which enables bit-wise random access and in-memory computing.  Davos Bitcoin Challenge  On January 21, 2015, Nick Goldman from the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI), one of the original authors of the 2013 Nature paper, announced the Davos Bitcoin Challenge at the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos. During his presentation, DNA-tubes were handed out to the audience with the message that each tube contained the private key of exactly one bitcoin, all coded in DNA. The first one to sequence and decode the DNA could claim the bitcoin and win the challenge. The challenge was set for three years and would close if nobody claimed the prize before January 21, 2018. Almost three years later on January 19, 2018, the EBI announced that a Belgian PhD student, Sander Wuyts of the University of Antwerp and Vrije Universiteit Brussel, was the first one to complete the challenge. Next to the instructions on how to claim the bitcoin (stored as a plain text and PDF file), the logo of the EBI, the logo of the company that printed the DNA (CustomArray) and a sketch of James Joyce were retrieved from the DNA.  DNA of Things  The concept of the DNA of Things (DoT) was introduced in 2019 by a team of researchers from Israel and Switzerland, including Yaniv Erlich and Robert Grass . DoT encodes digital data into DNA molecules, which are then embedded into objects. This gives the ability to create objects that carry their own blueprint, similar to biological organisms. In contrast to Internet of things, which is a system of interrelated computing devices, DoT creates objects which are independent storage objects, completely off-grid. As a proof of concept for DoT, the researcher 3D-printed a Stanford bunny which contains its blueprint in the plastic filament used for printing. By clipping off a tiny bit of the ear of the bunny, they were able to read out the blueprint, multiply it and produce a next generation of bunnies. In addition, the ability of DoT to serve for steganographic purposes was shown by producing non- distinguishable lenses which contain a YouTube video integrated into the material.

It depicts a rainbow arcing across the sky after a storm. Description In The Rainbow, Inness rearranged nature to imbue it with a sense of divine presence. He created stark atmospheric contrast moving from the storm on the left to the happy harbinger of the rainbow on the right. At the same time, the bucolic pasture in the foreground is juxtaposed against an unnamed city in the background. These contrasts fill the image with a heightened emotional charge. Starting in 1875, Inness began to include a strip of grey along the horizon that blurred the convergence of sky and plain. He used that trick here, and would continue to use it into the 1880s, although the blending of earth and sky failed to unify the halves of the composition. Historical information Inness created a series of dramatic storm scenes in the late 1870s. He drew on a number of sources to shape and inform this series, including the Hudson River School and the mystic Emanuel Swedenborg. Swedenborg believed that there was a correspondence between objects in the physical realm and the parallel world of the spirit, while the artists of the Hudson River School believed the landscape represented God. Thus, a landscape painting could bring viewers closer to righteousness. Inness devoted himself to landscape painting, capturing the divinity he saw in nature. He often painted rainbows because, for Inness, they epitomized spirituality. =Acquisition= The IMA acquired The Rainbow in 1944, a gift from George E. Hume to the Herron School of Art.

The proposal did not find any response. As a result, a single Russian GDS was never created. After the entry into force of the law on the storage of personal data of Russians in the territory of the Russian Federation, the state-owned company \\"RosTech\\" was urgently called upon to create a national GDS (where Russian airline tickets will be kept). = Working group with the Ministry of Communications for combating spam = In 2009, Pavel Vrublevsky, part of the working group on combating spam under the Ministry of Communications, initiated a campaign against his former partner Igor Gusev (according to Spamhaus rating of the world's main spammer), the owner of the largest partner spam network for sale Viagra Glavmed.

Initially, Vrublevsky was very unsure on public of the new industry but eventually migrated to become one of its loudest supporters. = Confrontation with the Center of Information Security of the Russian Federal Security Service and rehabilitation = In 2007, Pavel Vrublevsky first came under the pressure of the Central of Information Security of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation, in 2010 he accused the CIS of the FSB of Russia of treason and the promotion of the myth of the Russian cyber threat, and in 2011 was arrested several times by officers of the FSB investigating a cyberattack on Aeroflot's online payment system. He was convicted of orchestrating the cyberattack and sentenced to 2.5 years in prison in 2013, but was granted early parole after serving less than a year of incarceration. In 2016, on the basis of materials from Vrublevsky, officers of the CIS FSB were arrested because of high treason, which led to the termination of cooperation between the US and Russia on cybercrime. In 2018 the court sentenced Colonel Mikhailov of CIS FSB to 22 years in prison, his accomplice from Kaspersky Lab Ruslan Stoyanov to 14 years in prison, Mikhailov‚Äôs subordinate mr. Dokuchaev to 6 years in prison and their accomplice Mr. Fomchenkov to 7 years in prison. Mr.Dokuchaev is separately wanted by FBI USA for alleged cyber attacks on Yahoo and illicit pharmaceutical trade. = Media attacks and criticism = Vrublevsky was extensively targeted by American journalist Brian Krebs - in fact not only did Krebs focus on Vrublevsky for a story, he wrote close to twenty-five stories about him. Krebs has enjoyed tremendous support with both the Russian FSB as well as written positive stories of Kaspersky Labs - the major partner of the United States & Krebs in the scandal. The United States has since terminated any and all contracts with Kaspersky. According to Krebs there was an internal war of corruption between Pavel and the troubled man he was attempted to mentor, Igor Gusev. While Pavel had taken him down years earlier at the request of Russian police for being the world‚Äôs top spammer, he was now running one of the top spam affiliate programs in the world selling fake Viagra. Gusev became Krebs' primary source against Pavel, while Gusev, now exiled from Russia, was looking to settle a score against Pavel by setting him up. The revelations were entirely based on Gusev's statements and ChronoPay's stolen and hacked databases. Vrublevsky published his own research into the origins of the investigations into Brian Krebs as well as into that of another known cyber security researcher, Kimberly Zenz, accusing them both of working on behalf of American intelligence agencies.How do you become a cyber security expert? Vrublevsky humorously compared Krebs and Zenz with alleged Russian spies Boshirov and Petrov.The Hazards Of Probing The Internet's Dark SideReported treason arrests fuel Russian hacking intrigueE-Mail Spam Falls After Russian Crackdown Eventually, Vrublevsky was the central villain in Krebs' New York Times best-selling book, Spam Nation. However, recent events (arrests of Mikhailov‚Äôs group and subsequent charges against Dokuchaev by the FBI in the United States) debunk Kreb‚Äôs narrative about Vrublevsky‚Äôs role. For instance New York Times noted that the arrests of Mikhailov‚Äôs FSB group ¬´amounted to a purge of the leadership of the cyberwing of Russia‚Äôs main intelligence agency in the midst of the electoral hacking scandal, an issue carrying immense implications for Russia‚Äôs relations with the United States.¬ª In an interview to New York Times Vrublevsky stated ¬´‚ÄúThese guys were selling fairy tales to the United States about people doing business, like me.‚Äù In an interview to CNN Vrublevsky added ¬´\\"I believe it's a good thing for both countries [Russia and US]. These people are directly responsible for the cyber hysteria eventually going as far as election meddling scandal. I am very happy it's over.\\"Was Russia Treason Trial About U.S. Election Meddling or a Convict‚Äôs Revenge?Treason convictions in Russia raise questions about 2016 hack on Democrats = Column in Forbes, statements on Russian hackers = Since November, 2016 he has been leading a column in Forbes about electronic payments and crypto-currencies, in particular, the popularization of bitcoin. Vrublevsky‚Äôs statements on Russian hackers received wide response. In the spring and summer of 2017, Vrublevsky conveyed to a number of leading world media materials testifying to the non-involvement of Russian hackers in attacks on the servers of the Democratic Party in the United States. = Other organizations = In different years he headed: * The Anti-Spam Commission under the Internet Development Working Group under the Ministry of Communications of the Russian Federation. * Committee on e-commerce under the National Association of Electronic Commerce Participants. * Member of RAEK. In 2011, the magazine \\"Finance\\" included in the prestigious \\"33 Pepper\\" rating - the most successful men under the age of 33. In 2011 Vrublevsky was also the major sponsor of VTB League, paying over one million USD to Russia‚Äôs main basketball league. He was frequently seen along with VTB League top management including mr. Sergei Ivanov, one of Russia‚Äôs most influential politicians.Second season of VTB United League will unite 12 teams from 8 countries In 2018 Vrublevsky heads the Payments Committee of IDACB.com, one of world‚Äôs largest Bitcoin associations, founded by 65 member states ultra high- rank representatives.

It was directed by Beth McCarthy-Miller and written by Jack Burditt and Robert Carlock. The episode originally aired as an hour-long episode, along with \\"Last Lunch\\", on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) network in the United States on January 31, 2013. Guest stars in this episode include James Marsden, Julianne Moore and Salma Hayek. In the episode, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) struggles to adjust to being a stay at home mom, following the cancellation of TGS. Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) attempts to turn Kabletown into a perfect company, but struggles with his increasing feelings of unhappiness. Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) struggles to get a moment with Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer), who is settling into his new role as head of NBC, and Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) searches for her next move as an actress. Together, \\"Hogcock!\\" and \\"Last Lunch\\" received acclaim from critics. According to Nielsen Media Research, the episodes were watched by 4.88 million viewers during their original broadcast, becoming 30 Rock's highest-rated episodes for two years. Plot Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) is struggling to adjust to being a stay-at-home mother and decides to pitch new network president Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) a television show about her life, but he rejects it and explains to her that \\"woman\\", \\"writer\\", \\"New York\\" and even \\"quality\\" are some of the new television no-no's he is adopting in order to try and win back a bigger audience to the network. Meanwhile, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) is busy trying to turn Kabletown into a perfect company, using the \\"Six Sigma Wheel of Domination\\", but is struggling to find fulfilment in it, pondering whether, as per his mother's dying sentiments, he is truly \\"happy\\". At TGS, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) is struggling to get on without Kenneth as his best friend and runner of all errands, and dismisses Grizz (Grizz Chapman) and Dot Com (Kevin Brown) as they try to explain to him that Kenneth is president of the network now. Finally, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) makes the horrifying discovery that her tantrums and unreasonable demands are being ignored by the crew, who are no longer contractually obliged to put up with her. Stuck at home, Liz turns to a mothering forum and gets into an argument with another mother, which culminates in the pair agreeing to meet at Riverside Park in order to fight it out. However, upon arriving, Liz discovers that the other mother is in fact Criss (James Marsden), who is taking just as badly to having a job as she is to not having one. The pair realise that they are the wrong way around; that Liz should be working and Criss should be the \\"stay at home mom\\". At TGS, Jenna decides to prepare for her next step and vows to abandon comedy and only do dramatic roles, so she gets a gig on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, but is disappointed to find that she'll be playing a corpse. She attempts to rework the role by improvising that the corpse has come back to life with investigative powers, but is quickly fired. Undeterred, she instead vows to abandon television, and move to Los Angeles to become a movie star, but when she arrives, she discovers that all of the women there are ridiculously young and beautiful, and quickly returns to New York. Tracy manages to get some time with Kenneth, but surprises him by asking him to ignore all his requests. He explains that when he became famous, a lot of people from his past wanted things from him, and he doesn't want to be that person for Kenneth. He then asks Kenneth to go and fetch his car, which has broken down on the Long Island Expressway, which Kenneth happily obliges, suggesting that their relationship will not change all that much. Elsewhere, Jack decides to launch an attack on his unhappiness by creating the \\"Six Sigma Wheel of Happiness Domination\\" and making improvements to every aspect of his life: among them, leading Kabletown to record high shares and organising a threesome with former girlfriends Nancy Donovan (Julianne Moore) and Elisa Pedrera (Salma Hayek). However, despite all his efforts, he is forced to concede that he remains unfulfilled. For the sake of staying in work, Liz decides to give Kenneth what he wants: a bad show. She pitches him \\"Hardly Working\\", about a man called John Hardly who loves his family and hates the rat race, but he rejects it and tells her that she needs to make another episode of TGS. He elaborates that there is a strange clause in Tracy's contract that states that he must be paid thirty million dollars by the network if TGS produces fewer than 150 episodes, and the current total is 149. Annoyed, Liz goes to Jack for a job, but he tells her that he has quit due to his lack of fulfilment, and blames her for ruining him by making him care about things other than work. She in turn blames him for ruining her, by making her care about work too much. Jack retorts that he only ever called her for one meeting seven years ago, but that she had kept returning and their friendship had got out of hand. The pair conclude that they should only ever have been employer and employee, and nothing more. Reception The hour-long broadcast of \\"Hogcock!\\" and \\"Last Lunch\\" was watched by 4.88 million viewers and earned a 1.9 rating/5 share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. This means that it was seen by 1.9 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds and 5 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. This represented a season high in total viewers and in the demographic, an increase of two million viewers over the previous season finale and the highest-rated episode of the series, in overall viewers, for two years. When data obtained from DVR viewers who watched the episode within seven days of broadcast was factored in, total viewership for the finale increased by 25 percent, to 6.13 million viewers, and viewership in the demographic increased by 37 percent, to a 2.6 rating.

Guest stars in this episode include Al Roker, Conan O'Brien, and Alice Ripley. In the episode, Liz Lemon (Fey) returns for the final episode of TGS and is thrown into a world of chaos: Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) has quit his job and appears to be on the verge of suicide, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) is attempting to stop the episode going ahead, because he is due a payout from the network if the episode doesn't happen, and Lutz (John Lutz) is attempting to use his turn to pick lunch for the writers as an opportunity to exact revenge on them for constantly picking on him. Meanwhile, Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) attempts to extract some genuine emotion from Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski), as she readies her final song for the show. Together, \\"Hogcock!\\" and \\"Last Lunch\\" received universal acclaim from critics. According to Nielsen Media Research, the episodes were watched by 4.88 million viewers during their original broadcast, becoming 30 Rock's highest-rated episodes for two years. It was nominated for four Primetime Emmy Awards: Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series, Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series, Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Comedy Series, and Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics for \\"Rural Juror\\", ultimately winning one for Fey and Wigfield's writing. It has been listed as one of the greatest series finales in television history by numerous publications. Plot Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) returns for the final episode of TGS and is immediately faced with two problems: Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan), whom she expects will do anything in his power to stop production going ahead, so that he will get his $30 million payout from the network, and Lutz (John Lutz), whose turn it is alphabetically to pick the last lunch the TGS writers will share together. Meanwhile, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) is preparing to leave and regrets the way things ended with Liz, but his attempts to make it up to her are rejected. Tearfully, he appeals to Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) for advice on how to repair the pair's broken friendship, but she warns him that she has never known Liz to let a grudge go. Finally, network president Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) wants Jenna to pick an emotional musical number that she can perform at the close of the final show. Both Liz's problems escalate as Tracy bribes Al Roker to run a news report that a snowicane is headed for the city, and Lutz decides to order lunch from Blimpies, much to the annoyance of the other writers. Meanwhile, Jack begins to act more and more strangely, giving away his personal possessions and walking around the TGS studio declaring his love and appreciation for everyone. Pete (Scott Adsit) theorizes that he could be planning to commit suicide, before suggesting that a real man would opt instead to fake his own death, an idea he becomes suspiciously enamored with. Liz initially dismisses this, but grows concerned when Jack suggests he'll be at the final show \\"in spirit\\". Elsewhere, Jenna decides that, following her unsuccessful attempts to make it in dramatic television and movies, she will return to her first love, Broadway, and picks the song from her upcoming musical The Rural Juror as her final performance for TGS. However, upon hearing it, Kenneth is concerned that Jenna's performance lacks real emotion, and that she does not genuinely care that the show is ending. In the writers' room, Lutz remains five steps ahead of everybody as they attempt to overthrow him and choose another lunch picker, proclaiming that ordering Blimpies is his revenge on them for having constantly picked on him, unprovoked, for the last seven years. Liz overcomes him and locks him in her office, but he escapes through the ceiling panels and lands right on top of their new lunch choice, finally getting his triumphant victory as they concede to order from Blimpies. Kenneth returns to Jenna's dressing room with two removal men in tow and informs her that he needs to take her mirror, because Brian Williams wants it for his bathroom. Suddenly, she breaks down in tears as she realises that TGS is over for good, and that she will miss something after all, if only her mirror. As the final broadcast approaches, Tracy disappears and Grizz (Grizz Chapman) and Dot Com (Kevin Brown) reveal that he is hiding out at Dark Sensations, the strip club to which he had taken Liz when they'd first met. She confronts him and he explains that he is not disrupting the show because of the money, but because he has feared saying goodbye to people ever since he was young, and his father went out for cigarettes and never returned. Liz confesses that it is possible that they won't remain friends after TGS, because people naturally drift apart, but that she loves him despite everything he has put her through. Tracy appreciates her honesty and agrees to return. At the final recording, Jenna tells Tracy that she will miss him, and the pair embrace. However, Jack is suspiciously absent, and another conversation with Pete about faking his own death leads Liz to believe that Jack is indeed planning to commit suicide. Her fears are confirmed when she discovers a video suicide note in his office, and she tracks his phone to the waterfront, where he is preparing to leave on a boat (a Cheoy Lee built \\"Rhodes Reliant\\"). He explains that he plans to go away to find what makes him happy, and that he only led her to believe he wanted to kill himself because he was afraid that they'd never make up, and she'd forever hold her grudge. He goes on to confess that over the last seven years, she was one thing that consistently made him happy, and the pair acknowledge that they love each other as friends. Jack makes off on his boat, but turns around almost immediately and declares that he's found the answer; the best idea he's ever had: dishwashers you can see into. At TGS, Tracy thanks the audience for tuning in for the past seven years, as Jenna emotionally performs her final song. =Epilogue= One year later, Pete has faked his own death and started a new life, but is found by his wife; Liz is producing Grizz's new sitcom Grizz & Herz, and has taken her children to work; she has also stayed in touch with Tracy, whose father has finally returned from getting cigarettes; Jenna is attempting to steal a Tony Award from Alice Ripley; Jack's creation of the see-through dishwasher has led him to his lifelong dream job: CEO of GE, and he is still friends with Liz. In the distant future, an immortal Kenneth holds a snow globe containing a model of the Rockefeller Center, as he listens in delight to Liz's great-granddaughter pitching a show that will be based on the stories Liz had told her about working at TGS. Behind him, flying cars zoom past his office window.

The series finale received unanimous acclaim from critics and from fans of the series. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix opined that \\"the finale gave these ridiculous cartoon characters three dimensions for at least a few moments so they could say proper goodbyes to each other, and to us.\\" He elaborated that \\"Liz and Tracy back at the strip club was a blunt but heartfelt summation of their whole relationship, and Jack on the boat giving a long preamble about the true nature of their friendship before saying that he loved Liz (which Liz spared him from actually having to do by saying it to him first) was a thing of beauty.\\" In conclusion, he wrote that \\"[he would] miss this show, but this ending felt close to perfect.\\" Roth Cornet of IGN gave the episode a \\"masterpiece\\" 10 out of 10 and commented \\"30 Rock had the rare ability to provide both comedy and earned sentiment. That has never been more true than in these final two episodes\\" and concluded that \\"Jack goes back to his roots, his true-love, after a gloriously short-lived soul searching sea adventure: housewares. Liz, once and for all, embraces the fact that, yes, you can have it all, but \\"having it all\\" ultimately means truly knowing and accepting yourself, and having the willingness to compromise. And with that, a series that could have been an ingenious bit of comedy, but not much more, became a show about people and relationships that will stay with us well past the final fade to black tonight.\\" Pilot Viruet of The A.V. Club awarded the episode an \\"A\\" and singled out two scenes in particular as \\"perfect\\": \\"The first is Liz meeting Tracy at the strip club they visited in the pilot and, while admitting that it‚Äôs possible they won‚Äôt be friends after this, admitting she still does sincerely love him. The second scene is, if [sic] course, Jack‚Äôs suicide fakeout, which he staged as a way to prove that Liz Lemon would miss him in the future.\\" Viruet concluded that \\"It‚Äôs a show whose impact will be seen in plenty of future sitcoms [...] and while it‚Äôs a shame to see it go, it‚Äôs great to see it go out on such a high note.\\" Amy Amatangelo of Paste scored the episode a 9.3 out of 10 and opined that \\"It‚Äôs hard to create a series finale that will make every fan happy. But 30 Rock, which is going out still very close to the top of its game, came very close. There was so much to love about the episode: Liz‚Äôs frighteningly spot-on fights with the moms at Gothammoms.com. Jenna landing in LA, seeing the competition, and high-tailing it right back to New York. The show getting in a few last digs at NBC. Plenty of Grizz and Dot Com. What appeared to be the show‚Äôs real crew in the final TGS shot. The return of Jonathan. Tracy spelling out his name for Kenneth‚Äôs receptionist (\\"‚ÄòR‚Äô as in the pirate noise, ‚ÄòA‚Äô as in the Fonzie noise\\"). Jenna having actual feelings even when she can‚Äôt look in the mirror to confirm that she‚Äôs crying. Sure, I could have done without the Lutz demand for \\"Blimpies\\" as the last lunch, but I quibble.\\" James Poniewozik of Time commented that \\"In some ways, last week‚Äôs episode felt more like a finale, in that it put a period on several stories: Liz got her kids, TGS hit the end of its run, Jack got Kabletown and Kenneth became president of NBC. The last hour, on the other hand, was a goodbye‚Äìin a 30 Rock-ian meta sense, it was like the \\"one more episode\\" that TGS itself had to make, because we weren‚Äôt quite ready to stop\\" and added \\"And I‚Äôm glad we got that epilogue, because as neatly as the rest of this shortened final season wrapped up 30 Rock‚Äôs plotlines, this last hour captured its emotion.\\" Tom Gliatto of People praised the episode as \\"one of the most delightful series wrap-ups [he could] remember\\" and added that \\"[the characters] were full of the sparkling, absurd liveliness that characterized the show at its best throughout seven seasons.\\" He concluded that \\"With its endless supply of shiny, shapely little jokes, the show could feel like a wonderful salad served up without a bowl. You got tired of being showered with lovely microgreens. This time we got the bowl. It was a lovely burnished wood.\\" Brian Lowry of Variety was slightly less favourable, commenting \\"The finale earns points for ambition and nostalgia. There are the obligatory celebrity cameos, some very clever lines, a nifty callback to the pilot, and a kicker that exhibits a real love for television a lot of the audience probably won't understand it. But the whole thing is a little too precious and yes, weird - frittering away too much time on the supporting players [...] before getting to the really good stuff.\\" Homages Jack's speech to the crew comes almost word for word from Emily Webb's speech at the end of Our Town. The snow globe Kenneth holds in the final scene is a homage to the St. Elsewhere finale, in which it is suggested that the events of the entire series were a child's dream. In contrast, the ending of 30 Rock implies that the TV show pitched by Liz's great-granddaughter is 30 Rock itself. In a final Star Wars reference, the last of many throughout the series, the cars flying past Kenneth's window are from The Empire Strikes Back.

He won a bronze medal in the men's team event at the 2004 World Championships in Moscow, Russia. Valentini is a member of the modern pentathlon team for Gruppo Sportivo Fiamme Azzurre, and is coached and trained by Luigi Filipponi. Valentini first competed for the men's modern pentathlon at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. He displayed a strong performance in the early rounds of the competition, when he achieved a joint second-place finish with Lithuania's Andrejus Zadneprovskis, Latvia's Deniss ƒåerkovskis, and United States' Vakhtang Iagorashvili in one-touch √©p√©e fencing, striking a total of nineteen victories. Valentini recorded the slowest time of 2:18.34, when he finished thirty-second in freestyle swimming, but he quickly moved to the top position with a sixteenth-place finish in show jumping segment. In the end, Valentini successfully finished the event in nineteenth place with a score of 5,084 points. At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, Valentini qualified as a 30-year-old for the second time in men's modern pentathlon, along with his teammate Nicola Benedetti. During the competition, Valentini struggled to attain a higher position in the early segments, with poor scores in pistol shooting and in √©p√©e fencing. He managed to improve his performance by recording his fastest time of 2:11.70 in freestyle swimming, and by completing the show jumping segment with less obstacle and time penalties.

Films of the new wave differ from conventional themes of the past two decades (1990s and 2000s) and introduced several new trends to the Malayalam industry. While the new generation formats and styles are deeply influenced by global and Indian trends, their thematics are firmly rooted in Malayalee life and mindscapes.http://www.frontline.in/arts-and-culture/cinema/new-trails-of- discovery/article5189455.ece?homepage=true The new generation also helped to revive the Malayalam film industry in the early 2010s.City Times ‚Äì Hit parade New generation film producers like Listin Stephen who produced Traffic, Sadanandan Rangorath who produced Salt N' Pepper, Sandra Thomas who produced Friday are the producers who believed in this concept and took the initiative to make this movement in the industry. Characteristics of films Erosion of the so-called \\"superstar\\" system in popular Malayalam films coincided with rise of the new wave where screenplay got rooted-to-reality, closer-to-life and lead characters became ordinary men and women. Influx of new actors, the absence of superstars, rise of metro-centric/urban and middle-class themes and different story-lines were also noted in the wave. While formats and styles of the new directors are deeply influenced by the global and Indian trends, their thematics were firmly rooted in Malayali life and mind-scape. A recurrent trope in these new narratives is accidents, coincidences, casual encounters and chance meetings that set in motion an unexpected chain of events affecting the lives of the characters drifting in the urban flotsam. The frequent use of Malayalam influenced by English is also noted in the films.www.outlookindia.com  Chemmeen Pickle Until recently, most Malayalam films had rural themes portraying the \\"essential goodness\\" and \\"unspoilt beauty\\" of villages. The focus of the films also shifted from the conventional masculine, handsome, virtuous and invincible hero to more humane characters. Another notable feature is that stories shifted to depict more non-male characters as lead. Movies featuring gender minorites and homosexual leads is definitive characteristic of this era of Malayalam cinema. Actors such as Thilakan (Ustad Hotel) and Prathap Pothen (Ayalum Njanum Thammil) were noted for their hard-hitting performances in the Wave films. The depiction of women has also changed in the New Wave films beyond recognition. A number of female- oriented films such as 22 Female Kottayam, Cocktail, Beautiful and Trivandrum Lodge were also part of the new wave. The leading ladies often flirt openly, drink in public, and make lewd comments. The new wave films are criticized for explicit language and provocative themes, often under the guise of bold or modern. =Impact on superstars= The new wave soon ignited a debate about the era of superstars coming to an end and Malayalam cinema witnessing a radical change. In the 1980s, stars mattered, though not as much as in the 1990s and 2000s, when Malayalam cinema was practically dictated by the then superstars of the industry. The stranglehold of superstars that was stifling any new experimentation, complemented by the autocratic control of Malayalam film industry organisations over all areas of the industry was seen as pushing the industry to the wall. As per critics, the new wave of activity in Malayalam cinema is reminiscent of the 1980s, regarded as the golden age of Malayalam cinema, when mainstream films bridged the gap between arthouse and commercial movies, led by a team of talented writers and directors. In the 1980s, Malayalam films witnessed some positive changes through directors like Padmarajan and Bharathan, who made path-breaking films. These films too broke the norms which were considered the prerequisite for a commercial entertainer, and traversed a new path between popular and parallel cinema. Most of the new wave films are modestly budgeted, thus supporting experiments by new directors, between Rs. 2 and 30 million each (compared to the average Malayalam commercial film budget of Rs. 6 ‚Äì 80 million) and have more than recovered their investment. Characteristics of film-makers A few young writers and directors successfully brought in the New Wave with films such as Traffic, Salt N' Pepper, Chappa Kurishu, Beautiful and Neram. Fields such as acting, cinematography, editing, scripting and music also witnessed the emergence of new talent. Still, the conventional patterns have refused to give way and continue to have a strong support base among viewers.

Director Aashiq Abu, one of the most promising film-makers in Malayalam, directed several New Wave films to box-office success. Actor-producer Jayasurya who had debuted into the industry in 2002, had begun creating a benchmark in the new-wave of cinema through phenomenal acting performances in films such as Cocktail. Beautiful and Trivandrum Lodge. Jayasurya had also broke the image barrier of performing in lead roles for a mainstream actor or star, by essaying several character roles and antagonist roles all which were critically acclaimed.http://www.indiaglitz.com/jayasurya-to-bounce-back-malayalam- news-99303 Actor-writer Anoop Menon is another emerging personality in the New Generation field.

They depict lives of people living in 21st century Kerala through a very realistic lens, it's often said that most of its success is due to the freshness these narratives possess in comparison to traditional Malayalam movies. . New-Gen Malayalam movies tend to feature more nucleus families rather than the traditional joint families. This has reduced characters such as grand parents, uncles, aunts etc. This and the adult themes present in a lot of movies has gained the New-Gen movies the criticism that they're primary targeted towards young people. The use of latest technology has added speed to the process of change in the industry. More advanced technology and innovative techniques are being experimented. The industry has become more open to trying out new ideas. Malayalam actor Jayaram has talked about his disinterest towards the new generation films publicly, he has heard to be saying the new wave films lacks its appeal towards a family environment as the inappropriateness of mannerisms in certain films, beyond a PG-13 is very awkward to someone who expects to watch a family film such as most of the conventional Malayalam movies were, which did not need a specific rating. The New generation received criticism from some conventional film- makers like Dilshad. They accused that plagiarized versions of foreign films are being presented under the guise of New Wave experiments. While admirers of the New Wave of Malayalam films call it the \\"Jasmine revolution\\", critics refer it as the \\"multiplex revolution\\". \\"Some films that are fresh in thought and execution have clicked at the box office,\\" says veteran director Sibi Malayil. \\"But I am against referring to them as New Wave Cinema. Changes were always there in Malayalam films. But most of these so-called new-generation movies revolve around the themes that deal with life in a metro city. These films are getting a good response in tier-I cities only\\".

He is generally counted as the twenty-fifth in the list of 63 Nayanars. He is described as a contemporary of Appar or Thirunavukkarasar (first half of the 7th century CE), one of the most prominent Nayanars. Life The life of Apputhi Adigal is described in the Tamil Periya Puranam by Sekkizhar (12th century), which is a hagiography of the 63 Nayanars. He was a contemporary of Appar. Apputhi Adigal was born in the village of Thingalur, Chola kingdom. Presently in the Thanjavur district, in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, the village is famous for its Kailasanthar Temple dedicated to Shiva, the patron god of Shaivism. Apputhi Adigal belonged to Brahmin caste. His family had the job of reciting the Vedic scriptures. He was a staunch devotee of Shiva and a follower of Appar, who he regarded as his guru even though he has ever met Appar. He named his sons, cows and everything else in his house \\"Tirunavukkarasu\\", after Appar (Thirunavukkarasar). He worshipped Appar and erected rest-houses and water-sheds and dug ponds for devotees of Shiva and named them after Appar. Once, while Appar decided to close-by Shiva temples after worshipping in the Shiva temple at Thirupuvanam and arrived at Thingalur. Thirsty, he went to a water-shed and saw his own name \\"Thirunavukkarasar\\", written all over the place. Upon enquiry, fellow pilgrims informed him that it was the word of Apputhi Adigal. Apputhi Adigal was a follower of Appar (pictured). Appar went to the home of Apputhi Adigal and was welcomed by his host as a devotee of Shiva. Before Apputhi Adigal bowed to Appar, Appar prostrated before him. The guest asked Apputhi Adigal the reason why he did not name the water-shed after himself, but the name of somebody else. Apputhi was annoyed by the \\"causal reference\\" of the name of his guru. He shouted at the guest and asked if he did not know the greatness of Appar and sang his guru's glories. Finally, he asked the guest his identity. The humble guest indicated that he was the devotee who wrongly converted to another religion, but returned to Shaivism, after being cured by Shiva of colic. Apputhi realized by the description that his guest was his guru Appar. Apputhi Adigal fell at his guru's feet and worshipped him. He washed Appar's feet with his family and sprinkled the \\"holy\\" water on him and his kin. He requested Appar to have lunch at the house; Appar consented. While Apputhi's wife cooked various delicacies, the eldest son (called \\"eldest Tirunavukkarasu\\") rushed to the garden to bring a banana leaf (traditionally lunch is served on a banana leaf in Tamil Nadu) for the guest. A snake bit him in the garden. The boy rushed with the banana leaf to the house before the poison took effect so as to not delay the feast. On handling the leaf to his parents, he collapsed. The parents realised their son had died due to the venom. Not to delay the lunch of his guru, Apputhi and his wife hid the corpse and served Appar. Before the lunch, Appar blessed the family and wanted to present sacred ash to the family. He called the eldest son to receive it; Apputhi said he would not be available without mentioning the son's death. Finally, upon further enquiry, Apputhi revealed the truth to Appar. Appalled, Appar prayed to Shiva with the hymn Ondru Kolam thevaram. The child was resurrected. While the village cheered, the disappointed parents apologized to Appar for delaying his food. Appar had the meal with Apputhi and his children. Appar also resided at Apputhi Adigal's home for a few days, before returning to Thirupuvanam. At Thirupuvanam, Appar composed a hymn in honour of his host. Apputhi Adigal is said to have earned the grace of Shiva by serving Appar. The Periya Puranam also praises the devotion of the entire family. Remembrance The images of the Nayanars are found in many Shiva temples in Tamil Nadu. One of the most prominent Nayanars, Sundarar (8th century) venerates Apputhi Adigal in the Tiruthonda Thogai, a hymn to Nayanar saints, praises him as \\"princely Apputi\\". Appar has praised Apputhi Adigal in a hymn, composed at Thirupuvanam. Images of Apputhi Adigal and his family are worshipped in the Kailasanthar Temple in his native village Thingalur. Apputhi Adigal is worshipped in the Tamil month of Thai, when the moon enters the Shatabhisha nakshatra (lunar mansion). He is depicted with a shaved head and folded hands (see Anjali mudra). He receives collective worship as part of the 63 Nayanars. Their icons and brief accounts of his deeds are found in many Shiva temples in Tamil Nadu. Their images are taken out in procession in festivals.

He is generally counted as the ninth in the list of 63 Nayanars. Life The life of Yenathinathar is described in the Tamil Periya Puranam by Sekkizhar (12th century), which is a hagiography of the 63 Nayanars. His name \\"Enathinatha\\" means \\"Lord of the Generals\\". Yenathinathar was born in Eyinanur, in Chola kingdom. Eyinanur is located on the banks of river Arisol, south-east of Kumbakonam in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. A brilliant swordsman and a general in the Chola military himself, he was also the tutor to the Chola princes in swordsmanship. He was a Shaiva, a devotee of the god Shiva. He became rich owing to his prowess and spent his wealth on serving the devotees of Shiva. Atisuran, a rival fighter and tutor became jealous of Yenathinathar's popularity. While Atisuran boasted of his superior military skills, his skills were inferior to Yenathinathar's talent. Atisuran came with his best students and kinsmen and challenged Yenathinathar; the winner would continue to run his training school. Yenathinathar accepted and charged towards the opponents with his relatives. With Enathinathar's leadership, his side won the contest, slaying many of Atisuran's comrades. Defeated by Yenathinathar, the cowardly Atisuran himself escaped death by fleeing from the battle grounds. The Periya Puranam repeatedly refers to Yenathinathar as the lion and his opponent Atisuran as the fox. Following this he understood that he could not defeat Yenathinathar by fair means, and (the cowardly and cunning fox) devised a devious stratagem, seeking vengeance. In morning, Atisuran invited Yenathinathar to a duel in a secluded place. Yenathinathar consented and reached the spot with his sword and shield. Atisuran wore the Tripundra (three horizontal lines of sacred ash) mark on his forehead, which is worn by Shaivas, but hid his forehead with his shield as he arrived at the designed spot. As Yenathinathar (the lion) pounced the \\"fox\\", the deceiving rival removed his shield and revealed the Tripundra on his forehead. The stunned Yenathinathar took the Tripundra as a sign that Atisuran had converted to Shaivism and became a devotee of Shiva. Instead of slaying a Shaiva, Yenathinathar decided to die. However, he did not lay down his weapons as he did not want Atisuran - the \\"Shaiva\\" - to incur the sin of killing an unarmed man. Yenathinathar stood standstill in a pose as though he was combating, but did make his attempt to fight as he awaited the fatal blow from Atisuran. As Yenathinathar fell on the ground, Shiva - pleased with his extreme \\"self- sacrificing\\" devotion - appeared before him and took him to Kailash, Shiva's abode. The tale emphasizes the importance of external Shaiva symbols like the Tripundra symbol and the rudraksha beads worn by Shiavas. The tale of Yenathinathar (called Yenandhinatha in the account) is also recalled in the 13th-century Telugu Basava Purana of Palkuriki Somanatha in brief and with some variation. He is said to have worshipped his prana-linga (the body considered as the abode of Shiva) by wearing the Tripundra and rudraksha beads. He was the ruler of Elapura and defeated neighbouring kings, making them his vassals and collecting tributes from them. When the kings learnt about his respect for the Tripundra and rudraksha, they sent a warrior wearing the Tripundra and rudraksha with their armies to combat him. When the duel between Yenandhinatha and the warrior commenced, Yenandhinatha noticed the Shaiva symbols and threw his weapons and prostrated to the warrior, who he considered a form of Shiva. As the warrior was about to decapitate the devotee, his sword took the form of a garland and fell onto Yenandhinatha's neck. With the grace of Shiva, Yenandhinatha became invincible and became a powerful ruler. Remembrance The images of the Nayanars are found in many Shiva temples in Tamil Nadu. One of the most prominent Nayanars, Sundarar (8th century) venerates Yenathinathar in the Tiruthonda Thogai, a hymn to Nayanar saints. Yenathinathar is worshipped in the Tamil month of Purattasi, when the moon enters the Uttara Ashadha nakshatra (lunar mansion). He is depicted with folded hands (see Anjali mudra) and holding a sword in the crook of his arm. He receives collective worship as part of the 63 Nayanars.

The player's objective is to help Ion, a girl with amnesia, regain her memories by entering her mind, which is shown as a broken world which the player can repair. Although not a continuation of the Ar tonelico series, it takes place in the same universe with many of the same elements and expands on the series mythos. The game was notably the first game to be developed by Gust after their merger with Tecmo Koei. The game's first version was released on April 26, 2012. The original cart contained just the first episode of the game, with additional episodes gradually being released as downloadable content (DLC) via the PlayStation Network. Ciel nosurge Re:Incarnation, a re-release containing all of the original game's patches and DLC, including episodes one through four and a voucher to download episode five, was released on February 21, 2013. A total of twelve episodes were released in total, which are divided in three arcs: the Trials Arc, the Downfall Arc and the Empress Arc.

Gameplay The player is introduced to (shortened to \\"Ion\\") (Japanese VA: Ai Kakuma), a girl with amnesia who lives in another dimension; the player's objective is to help Ion recover her lost memories. Ion is a candidate for the next emperor in her world but lives on her own; the player can build a romantic relationship with Ion (shown by a separate \\"love meter\\") by interacting with her. Ion may make adjustments to her lifestyle timing, which will eventually match the player's the longer the game has been played. Another gameplay element of Ciel nosurge is the ability to create fairies known as from scanning barcodes. Different barcodes create a different type of Sharl, which are needed to repair Ion's mind. The game also has a system where players can type short messages for other players. The game has been referred to as a social game due to its heavy focus on socializing with other players and the requirement to be connected to PlayStation Network to play. At the time of its release, many of the game's online servers were not working properly, but that problem has since been fixed by Gust through a series of patches. The game was released as a series of episodes, episode one being the original cart. As of February 2014, ten episodes have been released. Episodes two through ten were released as DLC for a few hundred yen each on PlayStation Network. Each episode is estimated to take around seven hours to complete. Other than episodes and patches, other minor add-ons have been released on PSN, such as costumes, extra scenarios and dialogue packs for the interactions with Ion. Midway through 2013, Gust released additional contents: bundles containing the entirety of the chapters for both the Trials and Downfall Arcs, bundles containing all costumes, additional Sharl types and even a paid patch that repaired at once all of the Repair Points in Ion's Dream World, allowing the player to see the events without waiting for the Sharls to do the repairs. All of this can be bought as a single bundle, as well. Setting The world of Ciel nosurge was designed with an intent to give Japanese players a sense of nostalgia; for example with buildings from the Sh≈çwa era. Ion herself lives in a world called Ra Ciela. Ra Ciela is nearing destruction due to the expansion of its sun, Bezel; and due to this, most of its population built floating cities called Colons to protect themselves; while the poor still live on the ground. Reception and sales Japan's Famitsu magazine scored Ciel nosurge 31 out of 40. Merchandise for the game include a mousepad.

It is a desert plant found in the Middle East and the Sahara, and the southern end of its range is considered to delineate the edge of the desert. In Arabic it is known as had and djouri, and the Tuareg people call it tahara. It was first described in 1813 by the French botanist Alire Raffeneau Delile. Description Cornulaca monacantha is a straggling, branched, woody shrub growing to a height of . The stubby bluish-green leaves are scale-like and clasp the greyish, wiry stems. They each have a single stiff spine at the tip, hence the specific name monacantha. The leaves turn yellow or white when the plant is dead. The orange-brown flowers appear singly in the woolly leaf axils between August and November. The calyx and petals are spiny, the perianth lobes being linear and leathery, with jagged tips. One petal in each flower extends downwards in a long spine. The seeds are held vertically in an erect, flattened seed pod. The plant is wind resistant and has a long taproot. Distribution and ecology Cornulaca monacantha is native to North Africa, Arabia, the Middle East, Iran and Baluchistan. It is a desert plant and grows in arid conditions on sandy and stony ground. In Egypt, along the Mediterranean coast and in the western desert near oases it grows on sand dunes and in sandy depressions but not saline locations. Along with a low, cushion-shaped shrub, Zygophyllum album, it is the dominant plant in its community. Other plants found growing nearby were mostly grasses and members of the goosefoot family. The southern boundary of the range of Cornulaca monacantha in Africa is used to define the southern limit of the Sahara Desert. Uses A decoction of the leaves of Cornulaca monacantha is used as a traditional medicine for jaundice and liver problems and as a purgative. Externally it is used to treat scabies. Despite its spiny leaves, it provides good grazing for camels and is said to increase the supply of milk produced by lactating females.

Biography Stow received his education at a school on the Isle of Dogs. He was articled to a Dr. Lattey of London and was intended to follow a medical career. At age 21, having little desire to become a member of the medical profession, he emigrated to South Africa, landing at Port Elizabeth in December 1843. In turn he taught at a mission near Cuylerville, was a clerk in the commissariat, tried his hand at farming, became a book-keeper in Port Elizabeth, a trader in Queenstown and a wine-merchant, diamond dealer and auctioneer in Kimberley. Seeking refuge in the Renosterberg range near Middelburg during the Eighth Frontier War, he found an Early Triassic fossil skull resembling an amphibian. Thereafter Stow spent a great deal of his time exploring the Cretaceous deposits within the Sundays and Zwartkops basins near Port Elizabeth and the Karroo System near Dordrecht. After the war Stow was persuaded by Dr. Richard Nathaniel Rubidge to report his discoveries to Thomas Rupert Jones of The Geological Society. At a meeting of The Geological Society on 17 November 1858, a paper by Stow \\"On Some Fossils from South Africa\\" was read. The species was later named Micropholis stowi by Huxley, and is currently placed in the family Amphibamidae. The paper was the first of many contributions by Stow to geological journals, the most important probably being \\"Geological Notes on Griqualand West\\" published in the Quarterly Journal of 1874, shortly after he was elected a Fellow of the Geological Society of London in 1872. His landmark work on the geology of Griqualand West was never published. In the early 1870s Stow had set himself up as a wholesale wine merchant in Kimberley, a business that many found more profitable than digging for diamonds. However, geology was his first love and when he heard in 1872 that the Cape Colony Governor, Sir Henry Barkly, needed a geographical report on Griqualand West, he immediately put forward his name. His offer was accepted and a fee of ¬£50 was agreed on. Sir Henry Barkly took Stow's maps and manuscript to England with him in 1877 where they were highly commended by both Sir Andrew Ramsay and Thomas Rupert Jones, but were never published, to the great detriment of South African geology. The documents were eventually returned and are preserved by the Geological Society of South Africa. In 1877 the Orange Free State commissioned him to do a geological survey. While doing his field work Stow became familiar with rock art in the caves and shelters of South Africa. From the 1860s onward he recorded the rock art he encountered, and, in a letter to Thomas Rupert Jones, wrote: Stow was a competent water-colour painter and 74 of his paintings were reproduced in \\"Rock Paintings in South Africa from Parts of the Eastern Province and Orange Free State\\" with an introduction and notes by the noted anthropologist Dorothea F. Bleek, daughter of renowned German linguist Dr Wilhelm Heinrich Immanuel Bleek. In 1944 she donated to the McGregor Museum a number of watercolours and rubbings of rock engravings in her possession and produced by Stow when on the Diamond Fields in the 1870s. In a letter dated June 1877 to Dorothea Bleek's aunt, Lucy Lloyd, Stow confided his plan to continue documenting rock art with the help of his young Bushman assistant. Despite a lack of funding, Stow persisted in recording rock art for posterity. Throughout his trips over South Africa, Stow recorded information on tribes with which he came in contact, leading him to believe that the San or Bushmen were the ancient inhabitants of the region and the Bantu peoples relative newcomers. His book \\"The Native Races of South Africa\\" published in 1905 was edited and indexed by George McCall Theal, and was then the definitive work on the subject. He also wrote manuscripts on individual tribes, and these were later discovered at Smithfield by his biographer, Prof. Robert Burns Young, Head of the Geology Department at Witwatersrand University and a colleague of Raymond Dart. Bushman paintings on \\"Rocks in the Lower Mnweni 23 September 1867 G.W.S.\\" From 1880 Stow tried unsuccessfully to find a publisher for his Native Races of South Africa, eventually published in 1905 long after his death. He died in 1882 of heart failure in Heilbron in the Orange Free State.A History of Scientific Endeavour in South Africa ‚Äì A. C.

Background King was born in Pacifica, California and currently resides in Goleta, California, which is home to the Sprout Up headquarters. In the summer of 2009, King worked as a camp director at Surf Camp Pacifica. During the following academic school year, King became involved with an environmental club on campus. He combined his passions for the outdoors with the recognition of a need for progression in environmental sustainability, which fueled the idea behind his non-profit organization. King graduated from the University of California, Santa Barbara in 2012 with a degree in environmental studies and professional writing. Sprout Up King attributes the beginning of Sprout Up, founded in 2009, to not one, but two big \\"thank you's.\\" The first came from two parents, who were astonished to see their developmentally disabled son overcome his fear of waves at a summer surf camp because of King. The second unforgettable \\"thank you\\" came from an inspired 2nd grade girl, for whom the highlight of each school week was King's science lesson, especially when she got to \\"dance\\" like a bumblebee or nurture her own seed to grow tall and strong. Over the past four years, Sprout Up, formerly known as Environmental Education for the Next Generation (EENG), has expanded from 25 college students at UCSB in five different classrooms, to five other chapters: San Luis Obispo, Santa Cruz, San Francisco, New York City, and Davis. The curriculum aligns closely with the California Department of Education‚Äôs content standards and uses a system of teaching called \\"flow learning\\" which engages the four types of 4MAT system learners. Lessons cover topics like water conservation, habitats, seed cultivation, ecosystems, sustainability, composting, and soil science, covering a broad range of environmental issues. King received $100,000 in 2011 for his work and was in the running to receive $1,000,000 in December, 2012. Yet, he still prides himself in his favorite activities‚Äîsurfing, hiking, and teaching.

Crow stew may include onion, bacon fat, flour and sour cream. According to Guy Chassagnard's Dictionary of French Cuisine, crow has \\"very tough meat\\", but can be \\"placed on the lid of a large cooking pot\\" to create \\"crow stew\\". An early reference to crow stew in the United States appears in an account of Prince Achille Murat. While living in and around St. Augustine, Florida from 1821 to his death in 1847, Murat was known to prepare and enjoy \\"crow stew\\", which he \\"served to his dinner guests.\\" The modern, sour cream-based crow stew appears to have originated during the 1930s, at the time of the Great Depression. It appears in several publications at that time, including Nebraskaland (1933) and Outdoor Indiana (1936). The restaurant Caf√© K√∂r in Budapest, Hungary, has served crow stew. Other uses The term crow stew is also sometimes used as a pun, referring to the idiom eating crow. In an April 4, 1982 Chicago Tribune article titled, ‚ÄúMoney can put the Sox, Cubs on top‚Äù, the Chicago-based sports writer Dave Condon predicted that the Chicago Cubs baseball team would defy expectation and have a winning season. However, as the Cubs‚Äô season neared the end, the team was 19 games behind the first place Cardinals and was not expected to make the playoffs. As the Cubs prepared to host the rival Mets team, ‚ÄúCondon figured that the Mets would arrive in town with a menu for him of ‚Äòcrowburger, crow fricassee, crow pizza, crow stew, crow a la Gekas, and just plain crow for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.‚Äù See also * List of stews References External links * Team Coco: Jack McBrayer's Back Yard Is Infested With Crows Category:Stews Category:Crows ","title":"Crow stew"},{"id":"38324869","text":"Gramercy Tavern is a New American restaurant located at 42 East 20th Street (between Broadway and Park Avenue S.), in the Flatiron District in Manhattan, New York City.

It is one of three male tag team championships among WWE's three main brands, along with the WWE Raw Tag Team Championship on Raw and the WWE SmackDown Tag Team Championship on SmackDown. The current champions are Breezango (Fandango and Tyler Breeze), who are in their first reign. Introduced on January 23, 2013, the title was established as the men's tag team championship for NXT, which at the time was a developmental territory for WWE. The inaugural champions were British Ambition (Adrian Neville and Oliver Grey). Over the years, NXT grew to become WWE's third major brand, which became official in September 2019 when NXT was moved to the USA Network.  History  In June 2012, the WWE established NXT as their developmental territory, replacing Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW). The following year on the January 23 episode of NXT, special guest and WWE Hall of Famer Shawn Michaels announced that there would be an eight-team single-elimination tournament to crown the first NXT Tag Team Champions. On the January 31 taping of NXT (aired February 13), British Ambition (Adrian Neville and Oliver Grey) defeated The Wyatt Family (Luke Harper and Erick Rowan) in the tournament final to become the inaugural champions. In the first title defense, however, Neville and Bo Dallas defended the title against The Wyatt Family due to Grey being injured, where they lost; Dallas was not recognized as champion. On the June 20 taping of NXT (aired July 17), Neville and Corey Graves defeated The Wyatt Family for the title, making Neville the first two-time champion. On June 8, 2016, The Revival (Scott Dawson and Dash Wilder) became the first team to hold the championship on more than one occasion when they defeated American Alpha (Chad Gable and Jason Jordan) at TakeOver: The End. Although NXT had been established as WWE's developmental territory, over the years it grew to establish itself as WWE's third major brand. This would become official in September 2019 when NXT was moved to the USA Network, thus making the NXT Tag Team Championship the third major tag team title for men in WWE, along with the WWE Raw Tag Team Championship and WWE SmackDown Tag Team Championship. = Inaugural tournament = Belt design One-time champions Blake and Murphy (right and left), shown here with the original NXT Tag Team Championship belts The original NXT Tag Team Championship belts featured a simple design. The center plate was an irregular polygon. Prominently down the center of the plate was a vertical NXT logo in gold; to the left center side of the logo read \\"Tag\\" while the right center side read \\"Team\\". The two side plates contained the WWE logo. The plates were on a black leather strap. A unique feature of this original design was that the two belts were slightly different. On one belt, the left side of the center plate was black with \\"Tag\\" written in gold while the right side of the center plate was gold with \\"Team\\" written in black; the other belt was the opposite. The side plates also reflected this coloring; the side plate on the black side was dominated by a black background behind the WWE logo while the side plate on the gold side had a dominant gold background behind the WWE logo. When first introduced, the side plates had the WWE scratch logo but in August 2014, all of WWE's pre- existing championships at the time received a minor update, changing the scratch logo to WWE's current logo that was originally used for the WWE Network. On April 1, 2017, at WrestleMania Axxess, NXT General Manager William Regal announced that all of the NXT title belts would be redesigned. The new title belts were unveiled at TakeOver: Orlando that same night and given to the winners of their respective matches. Both the center plate and side plates of the new NXT Tag Team Championship belts are the same shape as the previous design and are again on black leather straps. The differences are the design on the plates themselves. The center plate maintains the vertical NXT logo prominently in the center, but now in silver with the WWE logo affixed at the very center of the \\"X\\". At the top of the plate right above the vertical NXT logo is a banner that reads \\"Tag Team\\", while at the bottom of the plate below the logo is a banner that reads \\"Champions\\". Black, silver, and gold ornamentation fills in the rest of the plate. Unlike the previous design, both belts are exactly the same. Coming in line with the majority of WWE's other championship belts, the updated design features side plates with a removable center section that can be customized with the champion's logo; the default side plates feature the WWE logo. As a result, the championship was the first WWE tag team championship to feature customizable side plates.  Reigns  Current champions Breezango - Fandango (left) and Tyler Breeze (right) As of , , there have been 22 reigns between 19 teams composed of 39 individual champions, and one vacancy. The Undisputed Era as a stable have the most reigns at three, while individually, stable member Kyle O'Reilly has the most reigns, also at three. The inaugural champions were the British Ambition (Adrian Neville and Oliver Grey). The team with the longest reign is The Ascension (Conor O'Brian/Konnor and Rick Victor/Viktor), who held the title for 364 days, while the shortest reign belongs to Moustache Mountain (Tyler Bate and Trent Seven), who held the title for 2 days. However, due to tape delays, which are the dates that WWE officially recognizes, they recognize that The Ascension's reign was 343 days and that Moustache Mountain's reign was 22 days, which are still the longest and shortest reigns regardless. Tyler Bate holds the record as the youngest champion when he won it at 21, while the oldest is Bobby Fish when he won it at 42. The current champions are Breezango (Fandango and Tyler Breeze), who are in their first reign. They won the titles by defeating Imperium (Fabian Aichner and Marcel Barthel) on August 26, 2020, in Winter Park, Florida on NXT.

As a result, Juggalos have been classified as a criminal street gang by government and law enforcement agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the National Gang Intelligence Center, and the states of Arizona, California, Pennsylvania, and Utah. Juggalo gang sets have been documented by law enforcement in at least 21 states, including those that do not recognize Juggalos as a gang at the state level. Juggalo gangs band together under the Juggalo banner in order to engage in patterns of criminal activity. Unlike members of the general Juggalo subculture, these gangs have handbooks detailing gang ranks and responsibilities, and commit crimes for financial gain. The National Gang Intelligence Center has also predicted that \\"The formation of rivalries or alliances to gangs outside their group will allow the Juggalos to evolve into a more sophisticated criminal entity through associations with hardened, experienced gang members.\\" Insane Clown Posse objects to characterizations of its fanbase as a gang, and has challenged the Federal gang designation in court. In December 2017 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit ruled that ICP failed to demonstrate harm caused by the FBI's 2011 report.  Criminal activities  According to the National Gang Intelligence Center, there are more than one million self-proclaimed Juggalos across the United States. It is estimated that 85‚Äì90% of self-described Juggalos are peaceful, non-criminal music fans. The other 10‚Äì15% make up the Juggalo subculture's criminal element, which has been linked to numerous crimes including extortion, murder, domestic terrorism, drive-by shootings, drug trafficking, arson, burglary, armed robbery, aggravated assault, and weapon offenses, and has been documented collaborating with a wide array of street and prison gangs. A series of arsons on a Navajo reservation have been linked to a local Juggalo gang set, which uses arson as a way to increase Juggalos' rank within the gang. In 2008, members of a Blood-affiliated Juggalo set known as the Southwest Bloods were convicted of aggravated assault after one member was required to stab a man in order to leave the gang. Juggalos in Rose Hill, Fairfax County, Virginia have been linked to the Gangster Disciples. Juggalos were identified by the New Jersey Department of Law & Public Safety as the most actively recruiting gang in New Jersey in 2010. Also in 2010, a Juggalette who was not affiliated with any gang was assaulted by a new Juggalo gang called the Juggalo Killers, who knocked her unconscious before carving the letters \\"JK\\" into her chest, because they wanted to be the only group wearing Insane Clown Posse merchandise in their territory. In 2012, a Juggalo gang member, who was wanted for violating probation, was placed on New Mexico's most wanted list. Juggalos in Oregon have been reported to have extorted homeless and homosexual individuals on the street with the threat of beatings. In August 2013, a Juggalo street gang member was arrested on charges of attempted murder, battery with a deadly weapon and possession of a controlled substance for allegedly attacking a cyclist with two meat cleavers in northeast Las Vegas, calling the man a \\"snitch\\". Also in 2013, a Juggalo member in Washington state allegedly stabbed a boy at a birthday party after being mocked for his Juggalo affiliation. = Rivalries and alliances with other street and prison gangs = The National Gang Intelligence Center has noted a high number of Juggalo sets with ties to the Los Angeles-based Bloods gang, although the reason why Juggalos align themselves with Bloods sets remains unclear. In at least one case, the gangs aligned because they share the same gang color (red). Bloods and Juggalos have also collaborated to commit drive-by shootings. In Pennsylvania, the Bloods and Crips dominate the incarcerated Juggalo gangs and use them for recruitment. In addition, certain Juggalo gangs have allied with violent prison gangs, including the Aryan Brotherhood, Aryan Circle, 211 Crew, and Aryan Brothers Liberation. = Potential for violence = Juggalo gang members are notable for their tendency toward extremely brutal and wanton violence. Juggalo gangs generally prefer edged weapons such as hatchets, machetes, and medieval battle-axes to firearms, and said gangs have been linked to a string of grisly murders throughout the United States. According to the National Gang Intelligence Center, Juggalo gangs are a threat to the community because of their tendency for violence against law enforcement, innocent civilians, and other members of their group, and Juggalos in Colorado have become increasingly involved in violent crime, including aggravated assault and homicide. Several law enforcement officers have commented on the Juggalo gang's tendency toward extreme violence. Arizona Department of Public Safety Detective Michelle Vasey has also expressed concern at the Juggalos high potential for violence, stating \\"The weapons, they prefer, obviously, hatchets ... We've got battle- axes, we've got machetes, anything that can make the most violent, gruesome wound,\\" and \\"Some of the homicides we're seeing with these guys are pretty nasty, gruesome, disgusting homicides, where they don't care who's around, what's around, they're just out to kill anybody.\\" Juggalos are listed in Montana's official handbook of security threat groups, which states that Juggalos are \\"a threat to law enforcement\\" and \\"very violent, many like blood.\\" = Outside the United States = On June 28, 2010, three youths in Fairfield, Australia believed to have been Juggalos attempted to rob a 20-year-old woman waiting outside a club.  Differences between criminal and non-criminal Juggalos  Juggalo gang experts have stressed that not all self- proclaimed Juggalos are criminals or gang members. Detective Michelle Vasey has commented, \\"I don't want people to go out there and look at every Juggalo and say, 'Oh, he's a gang member, he's got a machete and he's going to slice and dice everybody.' But people need to be aware that there are huge issues that have evolved in just the last three years both in the eastern and western United States where we've got multiple individuals committing gang-related crimes, gang-motivated crimes, and they're using the name Juggalo.\\" According to law enforcement research, including an interview with an admitted Juggalo gang member, the Juggalo subculture has recently split into two very different groups: the music fans and the criminal street gang. Some members of the Juggalos street gang even look down on non-criminal Juggalos, considering them to be weak, and criminal Juggalo gangs have committed attacks on non-gang- related Juggalos. These criminal Juggalo subsets are being formed by a new generation of Juggalos who are attempting to evolve the Juggalo subculture into a collection of smaller gangs or cliques. The Juggalo subculture has several features in common with traditional gangs, including throwing hand signs, wearing matching clothing, and getting matching tattoos. However, criminal Juggalo subsets contain gang-like features that the general Juggalo population does not, including gang initiations, handbooks detailing rules and punishments for gang members, formal leadership structure, gang colors, and the tendency to engage in organized patterns of serious criminal activity. Police officers in Sacramento have stated that while a fast-growing gang using the Juggalo name is contained within the Juggalo subculture, most Juggalos are law-abiding citizens, which makes it difficult to tell the difference between Juggalo gang members and Juggalo fans. Reaction of artists and FBI lawsuit The FBI's classification of Juggalos as a gang has caused confusion, resulting in many peaceful, non-criminal Juggalos being mistaken for their criminal counter-parts by police and by ordinary citizens. This type of confusion along with the fact that Hot Topic will no longer stock Psychopathic Records merchandise in states that legally consider Juggalos to be a gang, has prompted Insane Clown Posse to file a lawsuit against the FBI. In December 2012, ICP and Psychopathic Records quietly agreed to withdraw as plaintiffs in the case, and the FBI later released a report justifying their decision to classify Juggalos as a gang. However, ICP later announced that they would follow through with the lawsuit anyway. On August 23, 2013, the FBI asked a judge to dismiss the lawsuit against them. In an interview given in 2013, Shaggy 2 Dope of Insane Clown Posse addressed the Juggalo gang classification and the impending FBI lawsuit. He stated that at first he believed that the classification of Juggalos was \\"pretty dope\\" because it would afford the band a tougher image, but later changed his mind after realizing the negative repercussions of being labeled a gang, such as gang enhancements for Juggalos who commit crimes. He also expressed concern about innocent Juggalos being targeted in \\"Shithole, Nebraska\\" by MS-13 members. He argued that while some Juggalos are criminals and gang members, he does not believe that Juggalos as a whole constitute a gang. In January 2014 Insane Clown Posse along with the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan filed suit again against the FBI. The suit aimed to have Juggalos no longer considered to be a gang and to have any \\"criminal intelligence information\\" about Juggalos destroyed. The suit was dismissed in July 2014, ruling that that band and its fans lack standing to bring the suit. The ACLU has stated that it intends to appeal the dismissal. In September 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in Cincinnati overruled the circuit court and remanded the case for action consistent with the ruling. No court date has been set. On September 16, 2017, a rally was held in front if the Washington Monument reflective pool in Washington, D.C. marching for the declassification of Juggalos as gang members. In December 2017 the Sixth Circuit ruled that ICP failed to demonstrate harm caused by the FBI's 2011 report.  Gang identifiers  Gang identifiers used by Juggalo gang members include, but are not limited to: * Gang colors, depending on the individual set, especially black, white, and red * Psychopathic Records clothing and paraphernalia * Tattoos related to Insane Clown Posse and Psychopathic Records, including the six \\"joker's card\\" album covers and the record label's \\"Hatchet Man\\" logo. * Throwing gang signs * Evil clown-themed face paint, mainly in black and white paints Perspective of law enforcement officers and gang investigators The emergence of Juggalo gang subsets has created a sharp divide between gang investigators in the United States, with some considering the entire subculture to fit the definition of a criminal gang, while others stress that the subculture's criminal element makes up only a small portion of the Juggalo population. A report released by the National Gang Intelligence Center in 2010 supports the latter assertion. A report released by the Rocky Mountain Information Network states that, \\"Just because we do not understand this phenomenon fully, we can‚Äôt as gang detectives ignore it ... We in law enforcement must be willing to take that extra step in our intelligence gathering to see if we are in fact dealing with a gang member or just a crazed fan.\\" Detective Michelle Vasey has stated that not all Juggalos are violent or criminals, and the music is not to blame: \\"We can't necessarily say that [the music's] to blame. But I think it definitely does have some influences. As an officer we have to decide when we're talking to these guys, who do we need to worry about and who don't we need to worry about.\\" Police Lt. Scott Conley has stated, \\"Those involved in the criminal side of (Juggalos) cause us some concern. If they are not involved in criminal activity, they can do their own thing, as long as they haven't crossed that criminal element line ... The attraction to that music, or those people following that music, I have no problem with. When they start breeding disruption in the community, showing up in libraries to harm people with butcher knives up their sleeves, I have a problem. I have to get involved with the community.\\" The official web site of Montana's department of corrections contains an explanation for Juggalos' classification as a security threat group: \\"the Juggalos are a recognized STG group that would never classify itself as a street gang. They are more like a cult that follows mimics and idolizes the music group, Insane Clown Posse. The music encourages and condones extreme acts of violence, which some Juggalos carry out. Juggalo members paint their faces black and white, dress in black clothing, attend raves together that often end violently, and consider themselves a family.\\" However, some law enforcement officers have been firm in their assertion that Juggalos are a criminal group. Police watch commander Jay Mackanin of Citrus Heights has stated that, \\"Juggalos are a gang. I know sometimes they say they're not, but they are.\\" Kelly Snyder, a former Drug Enforcement Administration officer who tracks Juggalo activity across the U.S., has stated that \\"It almost has the taste of a cult...The perception is that something is obviously not right here...It's not going to stop. So far they are almost committing the perfect crime.\\" See also *List of Juggalo gang subsets  References   Further reading  * Category:Organizations established in the 2000s Category:Insane Clown Posse Category:Criminal subcultures Category:Street gangs Category:Gangs by type Category:Gangs in Arizona Category:Gangs in Colorado Category:Gangs in Detroit Category:Gangs in Pennsylvania Category:Gangs in Washington (state) ","title":"Juggalo gangs"},{"id":"38324927","text":"Ernst Torp (26 December 1900 - 11 January 1988) was a Norwegian architect.

Examples include titanium dioxide and in sunscreen, cosmetics and some food products; silver nano-particles in food packaging, clothing, disinfectants and household appliances such as Silver Nano; carbon nano-tubes for stain-resistant textiles; and cerium oxide as a fuel catalyst. As of March 10, 2011, the Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies estimated that over 1300 manufacturer-identified nano-tech products are publicly available, with new ones hitting the market at a pace of 3‚Äì4 per week. Nanotechnology is being used in developing countries to help treat disease and prevent health issues. The umbrella term for this kind of nanotechnology is Nano-medicine. Nanotechnology is also being applied to or developed for application to a variety of industrial and purification processes. Purification and environmental cleanup applications include the desalination of water, water filtration, wastewater treatment, groundwater treatment, and other nano- remediation. In industry, applications may include construction materials, military goods, and nano-machining of nano-wires, nano-rods, few layers of graphene, etc. Also, recently a new field arisen from the root of Nanotechnology is called Nano-biotechnology. Nano-biotechnology is the biology-based, application-oriented frontier area of research in the hybrid discipline of Nano-science and biotechnology with an equivalent contribution.

In medieval mining in Europe a Hauer was the name given to a miner who had passed his test (Hauerpr√ºfung) as a hewer.Walter Bischoff, Heinz Bramann, Westf√§lische Berggewerkschaftskasse Bochum: Das kleine Bergbaulexikon. 7th ed., Verlag Gl√ºckauf GmbH, Essen, 1988,  Training  In Europe in former times, before he could become a hewer, the miner had to learn to be a \\"sorter boy\\" (Scheidejunge), identifying ores and separating the ore from the gangue. After that he would continue his training in the pit itself. Here, he had to learn further skills, initially as a putter (Hundtst√∂√üer literally \\"truck pusher\\"), transporting material around the mine in wagons. Only afterwards could he learn the skills, as an apprentice hewer (Lehrh√§uer), that he would later need as a hewer.Brockhaus' Kleines Konversations-Lexikon, 5th edition, Vol. 1. Leipzig, 1911., p. 186 This form of training, the acquisition of knowledge by experience, was practised in mining until the First World War.Seminarprotokoll: Das schwarze und das gelbe Gold. p. Harries, J. Mooser From the 1920s, the training of hewers was legally regulated as a result of union demands. Because, in the meantime, many skills required special knowledge, other tradesmen were gradually employed in mining and in the pits: initially metalworkers and, later, electricians. Following training and passing exams, the craftsman had to gain practical experience in order to sit for his hewer examination. This comprised a theoretical and a practical element.Beispiel einer Pr√ºfungsordnung f√ºr einen Maschinenhauer (retrieved 13 September 2012) The hewer exam could be taken once the miner was 20 years old. Between his apprenticeship as a sorter boy and the exam, the trainee hewer thus had at least two years of practical experience. After passing the hewer's exam there was a \\"graduation\\" event (Lossprechung).DIETER SCHULZE-ELVERT: Meine Lossprechungsfeier im Duisburger Stadttheater  Hierarchy  An apprentice hewer was placed under a hewer and had to work under his direction. In the dressing area of the mine, old, former hewers were responsible for supervising the sorter boys. The hewer reported to the mine foreman or supervisor, the Steiger, also called the Dinghauer in some mines, or in smaller pits, the Hutmann. The hewer was held in particular esteem, by the other miners in the pit, even though he actually had no authority over them. The Steiger, who were important officials in the early days of state mining, later became just ordinary employees.  Promotion  Depending on diligence, skill and suitability, a hewer could be promoted to Hutmann or Steiger. Even an appointment as shift foreman (Schichtmeister), to the council of aldermen or jurates (Berggeschworenen) or as mine manager (Bergmeister) was possible.Chronik von Wildemann Teil V (retrieved 13 September 2012) At the end of the 18th century, pit and operational officials were legally required to undertake engineering training at a mining academy or mining school. For this reason, the training of a Steiger could no longer be carried out simply through on the job training. Hewers with many years of experience, the ability to lead men and who had sufficient mining and technical skills, could be promoted to the rank of supervisor (Aufsichtshauer) or senior hewer (Oberhauer). They were not, however, supervisory staff in the mining legal sense, but had the role of a team foreman. If a hewer proved to be particularly expert, he would be appointed as a \\"master hewer\\" (Meisterhauer). He was then responsible for the technical training of junior miners. For this, the master hewer, was specially trained in a preparatory course, which culminated with an in-house examination. Master hewers reported to the mining authority. A particularly experienced hewer who had worked for over 10 years and was at least 35 years old, could, if suitable, be appointed as a \\"leading hewer\\" (Fahrhauer). In order to achieve this he had to be deemed professionally suitable. His professional suitability was assessed on a so- called leading hewer's course (Fahrhauerkurs), which also acted as a certificate of proficiency. Leading hewers were responsible persons in the sense of the Federal Mining Law (Bundesberggesetz) and were given a written order of authority (Bestellschreiben).Ullrich M√§rker:Der studierte Bergmann  Hours of work and wages  The working hours of the hewers varied from region to region and ranged between 10‚Äì12 hours, but the time taking entering and leaving the mine was not counted. For one week of hired work in 1617 a hewer was paid just 18 Mariengroschen. This week's wages would not even buy a pound of butter at that time. Until the beginning of the 1950s, they worked 5¬Ω days a week comprising 50 hours. Today, the hewer works 7 hours a day without coming to the surface.

Doriscus (, Dor√≠skos) was a settlement in ancient Thrace (modern-day Greece), on the northern shores of Aegean Sea, in a plain west of the river Hebrus. It was notable for remaining in Persian hands for many years after the Second Persian invasion of Greece, and remained thus known as the last Persian stronghold in Europe.Raymond A. Bowman. Aramaic Ritual Texts from Persepolis Vol.91 University of Chicago Press, 1970, p. 61. Doriscus was founded by Greeks in the 6th century BC. It was conquered by Darius I and he built a Royal Fortress and stationed a large number of Persian troops there at the time of his Scythian campaign. Herodotus (7.59) reports that Doriscus was the first place Xerxes the Great stopped to review his troops after crossing the Hellespont in 480 BC, during the Second Persian invasion of Greece.Christopher J. Tuplin, Xerxes' March from Doriscus to Therme, Historia: Zeitschrift f√ºr Alte Geschichte, Bd 52, H. 4 (2003), pp. 385‚Äì409. Herodotus also writes that Xerxes I of Persia made Mascames, son of Megadostes, governor of Doriscus in order to replace the man Darius I had appointed. The Athenian general Cimon that led the conquests after the Persian retreat was unable to capture it. Herodotus states that Doriscus \\"was never taken\\" from the Persians. Its governor Mascames was honored by the Persian king for his defence. The Achaemenid ruler probably recalled Mascames with his garrison around 465 BC, and finally abandoned Doriscus. Doriscus' site is located at the modern village of Doriskos, Eastern Macedonia and Thrace, Greece.

His father held his fortune from the family silk business created in 1830 and of which he was an associate: \\"Les petits fils de Claude-Joseph Bonnet\\". Due to the large number of descendants of the latter, the custom was that only the elder sons of each branch could enter the business. Thus, Cottin, who could not enter, created his own business and teamed with Pierre Desgoutte in 1906, when he was 36 years old. He invested his fortune, helped by his wife's dowry (born Adda Bourras), and the trust which he got from his friends, relationships and family in the Lyons middle-class. He was a man full of character, dynamic and daring, with a definite charisma. All of this together with the high technical competence of Pierre Desgoutte, allowed the new company Cottin & Desgoutte to develop rapidly.

She was the first female president of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (1999 to 2001), representing the UNISON union. She also successfully campaigned for the inclusion of strong equality and human rights provisions in the Good Friday Agreement, and was a signatory to the MacBride Principles for fair employment. In 2002 she was described as ‚Äòprobably the best known and most experienced human rights campaigner in this country.‚Äô McCormack founded Participation and the Practice of Rights, a human rights organisation supporting disadvantaged groups based in Belfast, Northern Ireland, which she continued to advise until her death. Throughout her career, she crossed sectarian lines and national boundaries to fight for those who have faced, in her words, ‚Äúthe humiliation of exclusion,‚Äù particularly women. McCormack was named by the American publication Newsweek in 2011 as one of \\"150 women who shake the world\\", and her life and work have been portrayed by Meryl Streep in the documentary play SEVEN. Early years Born Inez Murphy into an Ulster Protestant family in Cultra, County Down, she attended Glenlola Collegiate School until taking up a position as a junior clerk in the Northern Ireland Civil Service at the age of 17, studying at night for her A-levels. Of her sheltered unionist background, McCormack recalled: \\"I was a puzzled young Prod ‚Äì until I was 17 I hadn't knowingly met a Catholic. I was a young Protestant girl who didn't understand that there were grave issues of inequality, injustice and division in our society\\". A restless spirit, she was twice beaten up at protests, once at a Northern Ireland civil rights march and once at an anti-Vietnam war demonstration in London's Grosvenor Square. McCormack attended Magee College in Derry between 1964‚Äì1966 at the time of the controversial decision to locate Northern Ireland's second university in Coleraine: her \\"first taste of street politics, and a lesson in the nature of exclusion and abuse of power\\". She then attended Trinity College, Dublin from 1966‚Äì1968, and met Vincent McCormack ‚Äì a founding member of the Derry Labour Party and former Bogside resident ‚Äì in London shortly after her graduation. The pair married within three months of meeting. Her parents opposed her marriage to Vincent: \\"Mixed marriages weren't exactly popular or acceptable and there was a lot of reaction,\\" she recalled. \\"Over the years they came round, more or less, but they were never comfortable with it.\\"  Activism  McCormack returned to Northern Ireland in late 1968 to find a burgeoning civil rights movement in the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association, describing the experience years later as \\"living through a historical defining moment\\". McCormack became active in the civil rights marches alongside her husband, and was at the People's Democracy march in 1969 that was famously attacked by Ulster loyalists, including off-duty police, in the Burntollet bridge incident. McCormack began a Diploma in Social Studies in 1969, commencing employment as a social worker in the Ballymurphy office of West Belfast Social Services in 1972. When armed conflict broke out there in the late 1960s, Inez became deeply aware of the effect of deprivation and inequality on women and their families. Wracked by the Troubles, Ballymurphy at the time was 'extraordinarily poor' and McCormack carried out her duties amid gunfights and extreme deprivation. An attempt was made to close down the Ballymurphy office, and the social workers based there were instructed to transfer to a different area. Realising they were needed in Ballymurphy, they refused to leave and were advised to join a trade union to help withstand the pressure to transfer. McCormack made contact with the National Union of Public Employees and they were subsequently accepted into the union with McCormack acting as shop steward. The transfer was eventually squashed, and McCormack began working part-time for the union in 1974. Career Just two years later, in 1976 McCormack became the first female full-time official of the National Union of Public Employees (now UNISON) and was given the unprecedented task of recruiting 1000 members within her first five months of employment. Identifying that part-time women workers in the public sector were typically dismissed as 'too difficult to organise' and thus not unionised, McCormack embarked on the challenge of signing them up to the union, stating, \\"My whole mode of mobilising them was to make them see that their needs were real, that they were somebody\\". Her efforts were markedly successful, increasing union membership from 800 to 15000 by the time UNISON was formed in 1993. In the 1980‚Äôs, Inez was a signatory of the McBride Principles, a set of international ethical investment. She continues to work for ethical globalization to ensure that no one is left behind. She went on to become the first female regional secretary of UNISON, continuing to represent the low-paid women working as cleaners, home helps and nursing auxiliaries. McCormack continued her career in the trade union movement as the first woman to chair the Northern Ireland committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU) (1984‚Äì1985), and served as the first female ICTU president (1999‚Äì2001). Her success in a highly male- dominated environment in combination with her determination to champion the voices of the disadvantaged did not come without challenges, particularly from her male counterparts, recalling \\"At one meeting I was booed off the platform and called scum,\\" adding, \\"I was talking about child care and was told that it shouldn't be on a trade union agenda\\". To those \\"inclined to take a stand against inequality or the abuse of human rights\\", McCormack asserted that \\"the fallout for the individual can sometimes be brutal, but it is emphatically worth it\\". McCormack founded and led a broad coalition of groups who successfully argued for strong, inclusive equality and human rights provisions to be included in the Good Friday Agreement. She was also a signatory to the MacBride Principles for fair employment, and succeeded in galvanising Irish- American opinion to combat the early unpopular reception to the Principles in Northern Ireland. The MacBride Principles were signed into US law in 1998, and harnessed the power of US investment against the practice of religious discrimination in employment in Northern Ireland. Her pivotal role in the Good Friday Agreement led McCormack to subsequently campaign for the implementation of those equality and human rights provisions as key to an understanding of conflict resolution based on the practice of justice. Concerned that the majority of communities most affected by the Troubles continued to be amongst the most socially deprived areas of Northern Ireland, McCormack led campaigns to assert the rights of the most socially excluded and enable them to challenge the problems they experienced, stating, \\"Our job is to put the areas and people who are excluded at the centre of our economic and social planning and show that we can actually tackle the unjust and unstable conditions. I argue that a lot of the social problems come because the economy is built in a way that excludes people rather than includes\\". In 2006 McCormack founded Participation and Practice of Rights (PPR), a human rights organisation based in Belfast. PPR supports marginalised groups in using a practical and unique human rights-based approach to tackle the social and economic challenges they experience. Successes include the establishment of a new appointment system for mental health patients attending emergency departments across Northern Ireland, re-housing families from run-down tower blocks, and renegotiation of regeneration plans from which residents have been excluded. Mary Robinson, former President of Ireland and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, has described the work of the organisation as \\"groundbreaking,\\" saying, \\"They are not just challenging what is wrong, they are creating an inclusive sense of rights and dignity, they are engaged in pioneering work which will command much interest and application elsewhere\\". McCormack was a founding member of the Vital Voices Global Advisory Council, and honoured in 2002 at Vital Voices Global Leadership Awards in recognition of her contributions as a human rights advocate. The international organisation supports and invests in emerging women leaders in harnessing their potential to bring about peace and prosperity in their communities. McCormack was also appointed in 2010 by the Irish government as the independent chair of a consultative process to develop an Irish National Action Plan to meet government obligations under the UN Resolution on Women, Peace and Security. McCormack received numerous awards, including an honorary doctorate from Queen's University Belfast in 2000 for her services to human rights and the community. She received the Eleanor Roosevelt Award from New York City in 1997, the Aisling Person of the Year Community Award in 2001, and the Irish Tatler Women of the Year Award in 2008. McCormack was a well-known writer and broadcaster, and her work has been featured in a number of television programmes and documentaries. Numerous op- eds and articles by McCormack on the theme of underpinning building peace and prosperity by inclusive socio-economic strategies have been published in recent years, and some of her work was included in the Field Day Anthology of Irish Writing (2002). On 4th March 2019 Belfast's Crumlin Road was renamed Inez McCormack Road as part of International Women's Week celebrations. Recognition McCormack's career was featured in the 2010 American documentary play Seven. The play, developed by Vital Voices, spotlights seven women from across the world that have overcame obstacles to bring major changes in their home countries. Meryl Streep portrayed McCormack. When the women portrayed were asked to come on stage and stand beside their onstage likenesses, Streep stated that she \\"felt slight\\" while standing beside McCormack, adding, \\"I'm an actress and she is the real deal.\\" In 2011, Newsweek named McCormack as one of its \\"150 women who shake the world,\\" the only Northern Irish woman to be named as such. The documentary, Inez McCormack: A Challenging Woman, produced and narrated by Susan McKay, won best short documentary award at the Galway Film Fleadh in 2014.BBC News: https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-30914555 Among those who have paid tribute to her were the Irish president Michael D Higgins, the former president, Mary Robinson, and Hillary Clinton. Clinton said: \\"She travelled the world encouraging young women to be agents of change in their communities and countries. We have come so far in part because of her insistence on a seat at the table for women and others who have been marginalised.\\" Personal life and death McCormack had lived in Derry since 2001. On 21 January 2013 she died from cancer at the age of 69 in Foyle hospice. Shortly before her death, when asked why she did the work that she did, McCormack replied that: \\"...at the heart of everything, I desire to see the glint in a woman‚Äôs eye who thought she was nobody, when she realised she was somebody.\\" References External links * Official website * Seven, the play in which Inez McCormack is featured * Participation and the Practice of Rights, Organisation founded by Inez McCormack Category:1943 births Category:2013 deaths Category:Deaths from cancer in Northern Ireland Category:Human rights activists from Northern Ireland Category:People educated at Glenlola Collegiate School Category:People from Belfast Category:Presidents of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions ","title":"Inez McCormack"},{"id":"38325561","text":"Gregory S. Kealey (born 1948) is a historian of the working class in Canada, founding editor of the journal Labour/Le Travail, and former Vice-President (Research) and Provost of the University of New Brunswick, where he is Professor Emeritus of History. The author and editor of numerous books and articles on labour history, intelligence studies, and state security, Kealey is a fellow of the Royal Historical Society and Royal Society of Canada and served as president of the Canadian Historical Association. In 2016 the Canadian Historical Review published a memoir of his career. In 2017 he was appointed a member of the Order of Canada. Early life and education Born in Toronto in 1948, Kealey attended St. Michael's College School, a high school for boys, where he focused on history. He completed his bachelor's degree in Modern History at the University of Toronto in 1970, serving on the Students Administrative Council and participating in the student movement. He completed his MA and PhD at the University of Rochester, working under the supervision of American labour historian Herbert Gutman and Christopher Lasch on a dissertation that examined the Toronto working class during the transition to industrial capitalism. He would later publish this work in the Canadian Historical Association's Macdonald prize-winning book Toronto Workers Respond to Industrial Capitalism (1980). He followed this work with the co- authored (with Bryan Palmer), the CHA and AHA Corey prize-winning Dreaming of What Might Be: The Knights of Labor in Ontario (1982). In 1976 Kealey helped found the journal Labour/Le Travail to provide an outlet for a new generation of scholars practising the \\"new labour and working-class history,\\" influenced by the work of E. P. Thompson and the Marxist tradition. He edited the journal from 1976 to 1997, when Bryan Palmer took over as editor. He returned briefly in 2016-17 as a co-editor, first with Bryan Palmer and then with Charles Smith. The journal, published by the Canadian Committee on Labour History, also produced books in the field under the CCLH imprint, many of which Kealey has edited. Kealey and his peers also co-operatively ran New Hogtown Press, a successor to the earlier Hogtown Press, publishing a number of books and left- wing pamphlets in the 1970s and 1980s in an attempt to provide a model of a non-profit socialist enterprise within a capitalist society. Teaching, research, and administration Returning to Toronto after his doctoral studies in 1972, Kealey worked on his dissertation and his partner, fellow labour historian Linda Kealey, commenced her own PhD work at the University of Toronto, initially under the supervision of Jill Ker Conway. They moved to Halifax in 1974, where he began his academic career as an Assistant Professor of History at Dalhousie University and then moved to Memorial University of Newfoundland in 1981, where he served as University Research Professor and later as Dean of the School of Graduate Studies. While in St. John's, Kealey wrote a regular labour column for the Telegram newspaper. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 1999.\\"Professor elected to royal society,\\" St. John's Telegram, 29 July 1999. In 2001, Kealey was appointed Vice-President (Research) at the University of New Brunswick, relocating to Fredericton. He assumed the role of Provost of the university in 2008, holding both positions until 2012, while serving on the boards of a number of organizations and spearheading the university's rapidly expanding research activities including successful commercialization efforts. In 2017 Kealey was awarded the Order of Canada. Focusing on research as Professor of History, Kealey co-authored with Reg Whitaker and Andy Parnaby the book Secret Service: Political Policing in Canada from the Fenians to Fortress America in 2012, which won the CFHSS's Canada Prize for the Social Sciences and an Honourable Mention for the Macdonald Prize of the Canadian Historical Association. It was also shortlisted for the JW Dafoe Book Prize and the Smiley Prize of the Canadian Political Science Association. He also co-edited the book Debating Dissent (2012), a collection of essays on Canada in the 1960s. He travelled to Australia and New Zealand in 2013 as a visiting scholar at Monash and Massey universities which reflects his significant scholarly associations on three continents. He returned to Massey as a Visiting Fellow in 2015. In 2017 the University of Toronto Press published his collection of essays, Spying on Canadians. Gregory Kealey has supervised more than 20 PhDs to completion at Dalhousie, MUN and UNB, including Craig Heron, John Manley, Sean Cadigan, Mark Leier, Christina Burr, Michael Smith, Miriam Wright, Andrew Parnaby, Dominique Clement, Michelle McBride, Janis Thiessen, Michael Butt, Fred Winsor, Richard Rennie, Kurt Korneski, Kirk Niergarth, Benjamin Isitt, Christopher Powell, David Foord and William Vinh-Doyle.

He also became mayor of Richmond near Melbourne. Life and career Koch was born in Hamburg in August 1845 and migrated to Australia with his family in 1855. He was educated and trained as an architect in Melbourne and served his articles with F. M. White. He became White's assistant until 1873 when he started his own practice. In 1871 he married Anna Puttmann at the German Lutheran Trinity Church at Eastern Hill (East Melbourne) where they were active members of the congregation. They had a family of six sons and three daughters. In 1873 he was appointed as Architect to the City of Melbourne and designed a number of market buildings. In 1887 he was appointed Architect for the City of Richmond. He took an active interest in professional and community affairs. He was active in the R.V.I.A., served as a Councillor in the City of Richmond for eight years and served as Mayor from 1882 to 1883. Koch ceased practice in 1913 and his fifth son, Bernard, carried on his practice. He died in Hawthorn, Victoria in August 1928. He is buried in Boroondara Cemetery. His best known buildings are the National Trust owned Labassa (originally called Ontario) (1889-1890) in Manor Grove, Caulfield North and the privately owned Friesia (1887) at 23 Isabella Grove, Hawthorn.

AcoustID is integrated into the audio file metadata editors Picard, Jaikoz and Puddletag, for example. Chromaprint In October 2009 MusicIP was acquired by AmpliFIND.AmpliFIND Music Services: News Some time after the acquisition, the MusicDNS service began having intermittent problems. Since the future of the free identification service was uncertain, a replacement for it was sought. The Chromaprint acoustic fingerprinting algorithm, the basis for AcoustID identification service, was started in February 2010 by a long- time MusicBrainz contributor Luk√°≈° Lalinsk√Ω. The oldest entry in the DB is from 8 Oct 2010. While AcoustID and Chromaprint are not officially MusicBrainz projects, they are closely tied with each other and both are open source. Chromaprint works by analyzing the first two minutes of a track, detecting the strength in each of 12 pitch classes, storing these 8 times per second. Additional post-processing is then applied to compress this fingerprint while retaining patterns. The AcoustID search server then searches from the database of fingerprints by similarity and returns the AcoustID identifier along with MusicBrainz recording identifiers if known.

Upon recovery, the defendant only remembered the incident where he was standing by a window with the victim lying on the floor with head injuries. The defendant was charged with assault. The trial judge ruled that the evidence that the defendant had suffered from a post- epileptic seizure would amount to a disease of the mind, not that of automatism.  Judgment  The House of Lords held that epilepsy was a disease of the mind due to the defendant's impaired mental faculties causing defect in reasoning. Lord Diplock stated that > \\"The evidence as to the pathology of a seizure due to psychomotor epilepsy > can be sufficiently stated for the purposes of this appeal by saying that > after the first stage, the prodram, which precedes the fit itself, there is > a second stage, the ictus, lasting a few seconds, during which there are > electrical discharges into the temporal lobes of the brain of the sufferer. > The effect of these discharges is to cause him in the postictal stage to > make movements which he is not conscious that he is making, including, and > this was a characteristic of previous seizures which Mr. Sullivan had > suffered, automatic movements of resistance to anyone trying to come to his > aid.

Forms of Contract  = Australian Building Industry Contract ‚Äì ABIC MW-1 ‚Äì Major works contract = ;General This contract has been developed jointly by the Royal Australian Institute of Architects and the Master Builders Australia Inc. and supersedes the Joint Contracts Committee (JCC) contracts, which are now withdrawn. It claims to use plain English and to involve less risk to architects than the ABS contract. It is recommended for use on building works of a major nature ($250,000 to $25million) where an architect is engaged to administer the contract. In its present form it does not appear to have any advantages over the ABS contracts. ;Variations A maximum percentage for the Contractor's overheads and profit is nominated in Schedule 1 of the contract and is applied to the value of variations (additions and omissions) ;Provisional Sums A percentage nominated in Schedule 1 of the contract is applied to the difference between the provisional sum and the cost of performance of the work. In the case where the performance of the work cost is more than the provisional sum, a percentage nominated in Schedule 1 of the contract is added to the difference and the resultant is added to the contract sum. Where the performance of the work cost is less than the provisional, the difference is deducted from the contract sum ;Failure To Pay The rate of interest to be applied to contractually outstanding payments is nominated in Schedule 1. ;Reimbursement as a result of a delay in the progress of the works The contract allows for reimbursement for causes of delay listed in clause L1.1 clause 1 to 13. This provision therefore provides reimbursement to the builder even though the cause of delay was not a breach of contract on the part of the proprietor. Where the delay is caused by breach on the part of the proprietor, the builder is entitled to recover damages sustained and incurred. = Australian Building Industry Contract ‚Äì SW-1 = ;General This contract is similar to MW-1 but is intended for use on building works from A$50,000 to A$3million. = General Conditions of Contract ‚Äì National Public Works Conference Edition 3 = http://www.dob.nt.gov.au/business/tenders- contracts/references/tendering-contract/Pages/npwc.aspx, ;General Issued by the Department of Administrative Services ‚Äì Australian Construction Services, these conditions are still in use by some of the Public Works Departments in all states. ;Variations Where the variation is valued by applying bill or schedule rates, no percentage is added.

This rate is a genuine pre-estimate of damages that the owner will incur if the project is not completed by the authorised date for completion. Once contractually accepted the rate will apply whether the actual damages are higher or lower than the pre-estimate. Liquidated damages are always calculated on calendar days. Liquidated Damages may be capped at a percentage of the contract sum.

The Bornu Empire in the eastern part of Niger was an active part of the trans-Saharan slave trade for hundreds of years. Other ethnic groups in the country similarly had a history of slavery, although this varied and in some places slavery was largely limited to the political and economic elite. When the French took control of the area they largely ignored the problem and only actively banned the trade in slaves but not the practices of slavery. Following independence, many of the major slave holders became prominent political leaders in both the multiparty democracy period and the military dictatorship (1974 until 1991), and so the problem of slavery was largely ignored. In 2003, with pressure from the anti-slavery organization Timidria, Niger passed the first law in Western Africa that criminalized slavery as a specific crime. Despite this, slavery persists throughout the different ethnic groups in the country, women are particularly vulnerable, and a 2002 census confirmed the existence of 43,000 slaves and estimated that the total population could be over 870,000 people. The landmark Mani v. Niger case was one of the first instances where a person won a judgement against the government of Niger in an international court for sanctioning her slave status in official decisions. Historical practices Map of Niger Slavery existed throughout what is today Niger and the region played a pivotal role in the trans-Saharan slave trade for many centuries. In some ethnic groups, slavery became a significant phenomenon and made up a large part of the population and the economic production and trade. In other areas, slavery remained small and were only held by the elite in the communities. However, since political leaders often were slave-holders, they presented a significant hurdle for French authorities when they colonized the area and in post-independence Niger. =Bornu= Much of the east of present-day Niger was involved in a significant part of the trans-Saharan slave trade with a route starting in Kano and traveling through the rugged A√Ør Mountains. The Bornu Empire centered along this route became a prominent participant in the Arab slave trade prior to the Fulani jihad (1804‚Äì1808) to the east and the movement of Tuareg into the A√Ør region in the 1800s. The trade through Bornu was small-scale for many centuries but remained steady before reaching its peak in the 1500s. Starting in the 1600s, the Jukun confederation, a collection of pagan peoples, began challenging the Bornu empire. The result was a series of retaliatory slave raids between the two powers with each feeding the slave trade to the coast (the West African slave market for the Jukun and the North African markets for Bornu). With the decline of the Bornu empire in the 17th and 18th centuries, slaves became a more significant part of the domestic economy with the creation of both slave villages and slave plantations throughout the empire. This occurred both because of the rise of the Sokoto Caliphate in the 1800s which increased the agricultural trade and introduced large-scale slave plantations to the region and as a result of exorbitant taxes leveled by the Bornu authorities which caused free people in the empire to purchase slaves to increase output and pay taxes. In terms of domestic use, agricultural work figured the most prominently. Women were the highest valued domestically, to a large part because of cultural practices which dictated that only first generation slaves could earn their freedom, and that the children of slaves never could become free. As a result, women of child bearing age, whose children would all be slaves for life, were particularly valuable. =Other areas of Niger= Beginning in the 18th century but particularly in the 19th century, the Sultanate of Damagaram, located in the present-day city of Zinder, became a political rival to the Bornu empire. Damagaram was successful because it built a large, mobile army able to protect trade routes and because they made alliances with the Tuareg leaders who had now become the primary power in the A√Ør Mountains. With these alliances, Zinder became a major power along the trans-Saharan trade route from Kano to Tripoli and Cairo. Zinder combined populations from the Kanuri (the major ethnic group of the Bornu empire), the Hausa, and the Tuareg and as a result developed slave practices which borrowed from all three to create a large slave population and varied institutions of slavery. There were thus large populations of domestic and agricultural slaves, borrowed from Kanuri customs, the development of plantation slavery, from Hausa practice, and the development of separate slave communities, from Tuareg practice. Slaves were not the only export commodity from the Sultanate, but were crucial parts of the overall economic structure. As the Sultanate increased in power, the Sultan began to replace nobles in his court with slave administrators, which increased his ability to rule without interference by others. Elsewhere in Niger, slavery was practiced in a variety of different ways. In the Zarma speaking regions in the west of Niger, slavery provided the crucial workforce in agriculture. It has been estimated that up to 75% of the population in these regions were slaves in 1904‚Äì1905. Unlike Damagaram and Bornu regions, any slave could be freed by their master in Zarma practices. In Northern Niger, in the present regions of Tahoua and Agadez, there are no signs of large-scale indigenous practices of slavery before the Tuareg entered the area in the 1800s. Since the light-skinned Tuaregs were the only slave holders and the dark-skinned indigenous population was largely held in servitude, the division of society between free and slaves adopted a racial division in these regions. The most important Tuareg community were the Kel Owey who settled in the A√Ør Mountain region. Because of the rugged terrain with severe drought effects, and because of their participation in the trans- Saharan trade, the Tuareg used a form of slavery where communities of slaves would tend animals and do limited agriculture and would be allowed to move freely around an area. Although these communities had some significant liberties, their harvest, products, and children were closely controlled by a Tuareg noble. In the Hausa societies in central Niger, slavery was primarily practiced in royal courts and thus of a limited nature. Similarly, in what is today the Maradi Region in central Niger, the Maradi leaders were engaged in a long-running series of tensions with the Sokoto Caliphate involving slave raiding by both sides. However, the Maradi mostly took slaves for ransom and domestic slavery was usually only used by the aristocracy and people of power. =French rule and independence= When the French took over the region in the early 1900s they had a policy banning the existence of slavery. However local French administrators usually resisted pressure to abolish slavery from the colonial and metropolitan governments. French administrators would take credit for abolishing slavery by simply ignoring its continued existence or claiming that the bonds were voluntary. One local administrator justified such a policy by saying, ‚ÄúI do not think it is presently possible to eliminate slavery. Our civilization has not penetrated deeply enough for the natives, both masters and slaves, to understand and accept any measures towards the outright elimination of slavery.‚Äù The local colonial administrators did however carry out policies to put a stop to slave trafficking and slave markets. During World War I, in order to meet quotas of troops to the French army, traditional chiefs supplied slaves to the colonial administration. In urban areas and settled communities with a strong French administrative presence, slavery and forced servitude were gradually ended, but in the rest of the country the practices remained active. Traditional chiefs, who had been major slave owners particularly in Tuareg communities, became prominent leaders of the country after independence. They held positions in government and were the leaders of many of the major parties during the brief multi-party period of the country. These prominent positions of slave-holders continued during the military dictatorship where the regional chiefs were relied upon for support of that government. As a result, slavery was largely an ignored issue by the government for the early decades of independence. Modern slavery Slavery continues to exist in Niger today. The most significant survey of slavery in Niger identified 11,000 respondents throughout the country who were identified as being slaves. Using further responses from these a partial sample revealed 43,000 slaves. Further extrapolating from this information, and including the children of slaves, the anti-slavery organization Timidria estimated a possible total of 870,363 slaves (both chattel slaves and passive slaves) in Niger in 2002‚Äì2003. The existence of slavery is not limited to a single ethnic group or region, although it is more prominent in some. A 2005 report by the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women found that \\"slavery is a living reality among virtually all ethnic groups, especially the Tuaregs, the Arabs and the nomadic Fulani\\" and the report also identifies the Hausa. Anti-Slavery International identifies three different types of slavery practiced in Niger today: chattel slavery, a \\"milder form\\" of slavery where former slaves are forced to give some of their crops to a former master, and wahaya, a form of concubinage involving the purchase of girls to do household chores and as sexual servants of their masters. Chattel slavery involves the direct ownership of an individual and there are limited examples of slave buying still occurring in Niger in the early 21st century. More prominent is the second type of slavery, sometimes called passive slavery, in which former slaves retain some tributary and forced-labor relationship with former masters. Individual freedoms are still controlled in this form and people can be beaten or otherwise punished for disobeying former masters. Wahaya is a unique form of slavery currently in practice in Niger (and parts of Nigeria) which involves the sale of young girls (the majority before the age of 15) who are born into slavery in Tuareg communities and then sold to wealthy and prominent Hausa individuals as an unofficial \\"fifth wife.\\" The women perform domestic duties for their master and the official wives, as well as forced sexual relationship with the master. They are considered fifth wives because they are in addition to the four wives a person can legally have in Niger (according to Islamic tradition) and are considered subservient to the official wives. Despite the name, men can take multiple \\"fifth wives.\\" Tuareg women and children, Niger, 1997 Although slavery is rare in urban environments, social pressure and social prohibitions on marriages of the descendants of slaves with the descendants of free persons creates a caste system which separates people even where slavery no longer exists. =Human trafficking= Human trafficking has become an increasing problem in Niger in recent years. For many years, Niger was primarily a transit country for human trafficking, but was limited as a source or destination country. However, in the 2000s, when other routes saw increasing enforcement, routes through Niger became more prominent, and Niger also began to become a source country for human trafficking. Following this increasing problem, Niger passed a law against human trafficking in 2010 and created high level positions in the government in order to deal with the problem. The 2011 United States Department of State report found that although Niger is making some progress on the issue of human trafficking, but that the political and administrative situation following the 2010 coup prevented effective efforts. =Laws against slavery= Although the Constitution of Niger declares all people equal, there was no law specifically against slavery or any criminal offense for enslaving another human in Niger until 5 May 2003. The French directives of 1905 and 1920, which were part of the Nigerien legal corpus after independence, pertained solely to the slave trade and did not stop domestic servitude or hereditary slavery. In 2003, the new law was passed which did criminalize slavery with a maximum prison sentence of up to 30 years. The law though does include systems of mediation between slaves and masters as a necessary first step in the process. With this legislation, Niger was the first country in West Africa to pass a law specifically pertaining to slavery and creating a criminal penalty for the offense. Two years later, there was a plan for a significant number of public ceremonies where Tuareg slaveholders would formally free their slaves. The government initially co-sponsored a prominent event in which Arissal Ag Amdagu, a Tuareg chief in Inates, Tillab√©ri Department would free 7,000 of his slaves. However, apparently fearing bad publicity, right before the event happened, the government sent a delegation through the Tuareg areas threatening punishment for any public manumissions. The government claimed that the public ceremony was changed because no one is enslaved in the country anymore so it was not necessary. Although Ag Amagdagu had signed a pledge with Timidria that he would free these 7,000 slaves, he instead said at the event that \\"Slavery doesn‚Äôt exist in Inates ... Nobody has told me they have seen slaves. If someone has slaves they must tell me.\\" =Mani v. Niger= Mani v. Niger, sometimes called a \\"historic\\" or a \\"landmark\\" decision, was a case in the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Community Court of Justice which served as the first regional court decision to be heard on the issue of slavery in Africa. According to Jeroen Beirnauer who is the head of ITUC's Forced Labor Project, the case set \\"a regional standard in international human rights law.\\" The basis for the case was that in 1996, 12-year-old Hadijatou Mani Koraou, who had been born into slavery in a Tuareg community, was sold for to 46-year-old El Hadj Souleymane Naroua as his \\"fifth wife\\" under the wahaya custom. Over nine years of violence and forced sexual relations, Mani gave birth to four children with Naroua. In 2005, Naroua signed a formal document freeing Mani, but then declared that she was his wife and prevented her from leaving his house. Mani received an initial judgement freeing her from the marriage on 20 March 2006 because, the court declared, there was never a religious ceremony marrying the two. This ruling was then reversed at a higher level and the case moved all the way to the Supreme Court. While the case was pending, Mani remarried and Naroua responded by filing a criminal complaint and getting her and her new husband convicted of bigamy (with a sentence of six months in prison). The court held that she was still legally married to Naroua and used her slave status as a justification for the marriage. In response to the charge of bigamy, Mani filed charges against Naroua for slavery in 2007 and followed this with a petition to the ECOWAS court on 14 December 2007 asking them to find Niger in violation of the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights. Niger's main argument was that the case was inadmissible to the ECOWAS court because domestic options had not been exhausted for remedying the situation. In terms of the case, Niger argued that although slavery still existed, they had made gains against it and it was largely being limited. The ECOWAS court found on 27 October 2008 that neither argument was sufficient and ruled for Mani. ECOWAS rejected the domestic exhaustion standard for a case to be brought to it and used the Barcelona Traction International Court of Justice case as precedent to find that slavery required special attention by all organs of the state. Mani was awarded and expenses in the case. After the ruling, the government of Niger said they accepted the ruling with a Nigerien government lawyer in the case announcing that \\"A ruling has been made, we have taken note of it and it will be applied.\\" =Social movements against slavery= The main social movement dedicated to the issue of slavery and post-slave discrimination in Niger is Timidria, a non-governmental organization founded by Ilguilas Weila and other intellectuals on 15 May 1991.

The inclusion of emoji in the iPhone and in the Unicode standard has been credited with promoting the spreading use of emoji outside Japan. As with many Apple icons past and present, they feature a design based on deep, saturated colors and gradual transitions of color, often incorporating subtle gloss effects.  Original release  The first version of Apple Color Emoji was released alongside iPhone OS 2.2 in November 2008 and contained 471 individual emoji glyphs. Originally limited to Japanese iPhone models, this restriction was later lifted. The designers of the first Apple Color Emoji typeface were Raymond Sepulveda, Angela Guzman and Ollie Wagner. Due to the iPhone originally launching in Japan on the SoftBank network, some Apple emoji designs may have been created to resemble those on SoftBank phones. For example, üíÉ (defined by Unicode as 'dancer' with no specified gender) is feminine on Apple and SoftBank phones but was previously masculine or gender-neutral on others.  Expansion  In the years 2011‚Äî2018 the Apple Color Emoji font expanded from 471 to 2,776 emoji as of October 2018. An updated emoji keyboard was released in iOS version 8.3, this update also added varied skin tones and same-gender couples included in Unicode 6. As a result, the human emoji faces switched to a neutral yellow skin tone by default, similar to the smiley emoji. The majority of Apple Color Emoji designs were updated with the release of iOS 10.2 in December 2016, with many appearing to be 3D-rendered. According to Apple Vice President of User Interface Design Alan Dye, emoji redesigns were due to the advent of Animoji, Memoji, and higher resolution screens. 157 new emoji were added to iOS in October 2018. The designers of the Apple Color Emoji typeface in versions after the initial release have not been publicly credited, following Apple's standard practice of not crediting work to individuals. Former Apple employees have offered accounts of who created various designs.  Implementation  Prior to iOS 5 SoftBank encoding was used for encoding emoji on Apple devices. Beginning with iOS 5, emoji are encoded using the Unicode standard. Emoji glyphs are stored as PNG images, at several resolutions (strikes of 20, 32, 40, 48, 64, 96 and 160 pixels squared) using a proprietary \\"sbix\\" table that was later standardized in OpenType version 1.8. The font contains a number of Easter eggs. Several glyphs contain portions of the text of Apple's Think different advertisement (\\"Here's to the crazy ones...\\"), including 1F4CB \\"Clipboard\\" (üìã), 1F4C4 \\"Page facing up\\" (üìÑ), 1F4D1 \\"Bookmark Tabs\\" (üìë), and 1F4D6 \\"Open book\\" (üìñ), among others. Other emoji, specified as generic objects, appear as Apple products. For example, 1F4BB \\"Personal computer\\" (üíª) appears as a modern MacBook, while 231A \\"Wristwatch\\" (‚åö) shows an Apple Watch. 1F301 \\"Foggy\\" (üåÅ) shows the Golden Gate Bridge behind San Francisco fog, a reference to Apple's California headquarters, and 1F4F0 \\"Newspaper\\" (üì∞)'s headline reads \\"The Apple Times\\". A variety of styles are used in the original sets. For example, üê¨ and üêô (dolphin and octopus) were quite stylized with 'button' eyes, while üêà and üêÄ (cat and rat) were more realistic, resembling watercolor paintings. This mixture of styles creates a range of possible designs: for example, üêè and üêë (ram and sheep) look clearly different, as do üê´ and üê™ (Bactrian camel and dromedary).  Trends  Because of the calendar emoji (üìÖ) showing July 17, this date was chosen for the annual World Emoji Day. The date originally referred to the day Apple premiered its iCal calendar application in 2002. Although primarily intended for onscreen display (iOS having limited printing capabilities), some printed displays and signs have used Apple Color Emoji designs. New York magazine used Apple Color Emoji in a printed feature on the growing use of emoji.

Early career He studied Geography at the University of Reading and graduated in 1971. He continued at Reading as a research student under the supervision of Dr. Colin Mitchell. His research work was geomorphological mapping and process studies in Tunisia. He graduated with his PhD from the University of Reading in 1975 and relocated to Nigeria with Dorothy his wife, where he taught at Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria. On his return to the UK (via Land Rover across the Sahara) he took up a lecturing position in the Geography Department of Queen's University Belfast in 1979. This provided the academic base for the rest of his career, being appointed Senior Lecturer, Reader and finally held the Chair in Tropical Geomorphology from 1998. He continued in post until illness necessitated early retirement in 2011. Research His research interests were wide and varied but were rooted in his love of hot deserts and tropical landscapes and his desire to better understand the processes that shape them. Whilst the interpretation and exploration of landscapes formed the central core of Bernard Smith's career, his interest in process studies, and weathering processes in particular, led him onto some of his most significant geomorphological work. Bernard Smith's first publications were on desert geomorphology but his wide interests were also focussed on the formation of desert dust and loess. His interest in desert weathering then started to develop in the direction of building stone decay. His first work on this was in Venice and then developed to investigations on pollution-related weathering in the UK, Hungary and Brazil. Links with engineers and building conservationists were facilitated with grants and post-doctoral support for workers at QUB. He established the Weathering Research Group in the early 1990s in the School of Geography, Archaeology and Palaeoecology at Queen's University Belfast (QUB). The focus of this group was on improving understanding of stone weathering in both natural and built environments and resulted in Bernard Smith's involvement with local conservation architects and the wider building conservation and restoration communities in the UK, Europe and further afield. In recent years, he played a leading role in understanding the impact of climate change on the UK's stone-built heritage and new build. Bernard Smith's interest in landscape interpretation was used as he became increasingly involved with wider conservation issues. This was first as a member of the Council for Nature Conservation and the Countryside (CNCC) in Northern Ireland. His advisory role for Northern Ireland's World Heritage Site at the Giant's Causeway and Causeway Coast developed on a broader global stage as a UNESCO world heritage evaluator. Bernard Smith supervised the launch of many geomorphological careers with his thoughtful PhD supervision influenced many of the undergraduate students who came into contact with him. He was an inspiring teacher who believed that it was essential for the future of geomorphology that all students and practitioners should have a thorough understanding of the history and development of the subject. During his time on the British Society for Geomorphology (BSG) Executive Committee he did much to further the support for postgraduates. For many years he was an organiser and facilitator of the 'Windsor Workshop' for new research students run by the BSG. He became Vice Chair of the BSG and Chair in 2011.

Symptoms  The bacteria can affect the cotton plant during all growth stages, infecting stems, leaves, bracts and bolls. It causes seedling blight, leaf spot, blackarm (on stem and petioles), black vein and boll rot. On cotyledons small, green, water-soaked rounded (or irregular) spots form which turn brown. Cotyledons can be distorted if the infection is intense. Black and elongated lesions can girdle the hypocotyls and kill seedlings. On the leaves, scattered small dark-green, water-soaked, areolate spots, form measuring 1‚Äì2 mm on the lower surface, which appear translucent against transmitted light. The spots increase in diameter to 5 mm, become angular (due to leaf veination), brown and later turn dark brown to blackish, becoming visible on the upper surface. On susceptible cultivars numerous spots can occur, causing chlorosis, necrosis and distortion, and eventually defoliation.Liberato JR, Allen SJ, Suassuna ND, Mehta YR, Koenning SR & Shivas RG the black arm symptom is characterized by dark brown to black lesions which may coalesce and the extended necrosis then girdles the stem with blockage of the vascular system at infected sites which hinder the movement of water and nutrients though the plant system. Drooping of leaves is associated with this hindrance of water and nutrient movement. Cracking of the stem and gummosis is also observed in infected plants. The resultant breaking of the stem which hang typically as a dry black twig is referred to as the ‚Äòblack arm‚Äô.

Its development began in 2012 by the Swedish company Memoto after a successful crowd funding via Kickstarter. It can automatically take a picture every 30 seconds whilst being worn throughout the day, a practice known as \\"life-logging\\". At the end of the day the Clip uploads the photos and videos it made into the vendor's cloud service, where they are processed and organized into collections called Moments, available to the user through a web client or mobile apps. The Moments or individual photos and videos can be shared through other apps or through the company's own social network. History The company made its first headlines after raising $500,000 from a Kickstarter campaign which closed in Nov, 2012. First units to backers were starting to be sent out during the autumn 2013. Originally named Memoto, the company then proceeded to change its name to Narrative and the product name to the Narrative Clip and kept on selling the first Narrative Clip on its website and through various retailers throughout the next 2 years. The vastly improved Narrative Clip 2, featuring an improved camera, a modular attachment system, video capture, Bluetooth control and a built-in Wifi cloud uploader was unveiled at CES 2015 and started shipping in early 2016. Due to cashflow problems and a broad decline in venture capital interest in wearables during 2016, the original company had to shut down late 2016. The assets and cloud service were acquired by a new company called Third Dot, run by some of the former founders and employees, which is keeping the service running for the existing users as well as maintaining sales of the Clip 2. There have been rumours of a Narrative Clip 3 being developed by the new company but no official announcements have been made.Narrative Clip, as worn, compared with its predecessors Press The lifelogging idea and Narrative Clip captured the attention and imagination of magazines and newspapers worldwide, like Wall Street Journal , Der Spiegel, New York Times International Herald, TechCrunch , FastCompany , Huffington Post , Wired , TheNextWeb , Cond√© Nast Traveller , Engadget and The Verge .

Based on the 2004 novel Night Train to Lisbon by Pascal Mercier and written by Greg Latter and Ulrich Herrmann, the film is about a Swiss teacher who saves the life of a woman and then abandons his teaching career and reserved life to embark on a thrilling intellectual adventure that takes him on a journey to the very heart of himself. The film premiered out of competition at the 63rd Berlin International Film Festival. Plot Walking over a bridge on the way to his school in Bern, Raimund Gregorius, a Swiss professor of philosophy, notices a young woman in a red coat standing on the railing, about to leap. Dropping his briefcase, he runs and pulls her down. She helps him gather the papers that have spilled from his briefcase and accompanies him to the school where he teaches. But instead of waiting to talk, she leaves during the middle of his class, without her coat. Concerned, Raimund grabs the coat and runs after her, but in vain. He checks her pockets for identification. All he finds is a small book, a memoir of sorts, by Amadeu do Prado. It is stamped with the address of the bookstore where he happens to be a regular customer and he goes there. The bookseller remembers the girl's purchasing this obscure book and, as he leafs through it, a train ticket to Lisbon falls out. The train is, in fact, leaving in 15 minutes. Confused and doubtful, Raimund rushes to the station, but the woman is nowhere in sight. At the last moment he decides to use the ticket himself and jumps on the train. During the journey he reads the book. Amadeu do Prado lived in Lisbon, so Raimund searches for him, hoping that this will lead to the woman. He finds Amadeu's home, where the writer's sister, Adriana, welcomes Raimund; she gives him the impression her brother still lives there. Raimund learns that Amadeu was a doctor, and that only 100 copies of his book were printed after his death. When Raimund asks what happened to their father, Adriana's reaction is hostile. As Raimund is leaving, the maid informs him that he can find Amadeu in the town's cemetery. Raimund finds the tomb: Amadeu died in 1974. In the street, a cyclist runs into Raimund and smashes his glasses. While obtaining new glasses from a local optician, Mariana, Raimund narrates his experiences. When he returns to collect the glasses, Mariana tells Raimund her uncle knew Amadeu de Prado well and is willing to talk to Raimund. Raimund and Mariana both go to the nursing home where her uncle Jo√£o E√ßa resides, and Raimund learns Jo√£o and Amadeu were both in the resistance against the Salazar dictatorship. The story of their part in the resistance is told in flashbacks as the film continues. Raimund then visits the priest who taught and later buried Amadeu de Prado. The priest explains that Amadeu, an exceptionally smart young boy from an aristocratic background, befriended Jorge O'Kelly, another bright boy in the school although he was from a working class family. The boys bonded through their love for knowledge, particularly the philosophical and political knowledge not permitted under Salazar. Amadeu gave a graduation speech that reflected his contempt for the regime causing many of the families in the audience to walk out, much to the chagrin of his father, a well respected judge. Raimund returns to Adriana and asks for her side of the story, and then he revisits Jo√£o to obtain more information. Raimund learns that Amadeu died of an aneurysm, which he knew he had, but had not told Adriana about. As a doctor, Amadeu never refused a patient, and when Mendez, a powerful member of the Salazar regime, called \\"the Butcher of Lisbon\\", was brought to Amadeu's clinic, he saved the man's life. Amadeu's friends were shocked by this, especially Jorge, who at that time was already in the resistance. Later, Amadeu confronted Jorge and declared that he too would join the resistance. Jorge introduced Amadeu to Jo√£o and to his girlfiend Estef√¢nia, a beautiful woman with a photographic memory who helped the resistance by memorizing people's names and contact information. But Amadeu and Estef√¢nia were instantly attracted to each other. Jorge discovered that Estef√¢nia loved Amadeu and was crushed by her betrayal. When the revolution against Salazar began, Amadeu fled to Spain with Estef√¢nia but she refused his offer to start a new life together in Brazil. Raimund learned where she went to live and went there to find out if she was still alive. They talk and Raimund tells Estef√¢nia that Amadeu's death had nothing to do with her leaving Amadeu. The suicidal woman from the bridge in Bern has tracked Raimund down and waits for him in the lobby of his hotel in Lisbon. She came to thank Raimund for saving her life. She tells him that she felt suicidal because she had just learned from the book that her beloved grandfather was the Butcher of Lisbon, but she is learning to accept this. Raimund had brought with him the red coat she was wearing that day in Bern and he gives it back to her. The events have become a catalyst to Raimund's sedate life, in a gentle sort of way. Yet he informs the school that he will now return to his job. Mariana accompanies him to the railway station and, at the last moment, suggests that he could instead stay in Lisbon. The film ends with Raimund looking at Mariana with the train about to pull out of the station, leaving Raimund with time to leave or stay.

Plot At a bar, Jeremy refuses to kill the new vampires. Klaus threatens to force them to attack Matt, so Jeremy would kill them. Since the new vampires will smell the injured Matt's blood (and probably attack) he and Jeremy try to escape. Although they are attacked, Elena intervenes and they reach the lake house. The next day, Elena scolds Damon for using innocent people; the vampires (controlled by Klaus) will return soon and Damon says, \\"Jeremy needs to finish the job.\\" Rebekah visits Stefan, telling him she has a plan to steal Silas's headstone (and forcing Shane to join them). After Shane tells Bonnie she is in control, Sheriff Forbes arrests him with information from the mayor (Bonnie's father). Damon and Jeremy return to the bar and discover the vampires have been killed by Klaus and Rebekah's brother Kol, who tells them that 200 years ago he killed a Silas-worshiping cult and he does not want Silas to re-awaken. When he tries to tear off Jeremy's arms Damon attacks him, allowing Jeremy to escape. Bonnie's father tells her that Shane manipulates the weak-minded. In the interrogation room, Shane confesses to Bonnie his murder of the 12 Founders Council members. Elena and Matt return to Mystic Falls, receiving a call from Jeremy about Kol's attack and Damon's capture. Elena asks Klaus to call off Kol, reminding him that they both want the cure; he tells Kol to stay away from Jeremy and release Damon. Kol instead tortures Damon into killing Jeremy. In Shane's study Rebekah and Stefan look for the headstone, reminiscing about their relationship. Rebekah says they had fun, and tells Stefan to stop caring. A man appears, telling them that the headstone is behind a panel, and Rebekah grabs him by the throat. With the interrogation- room cameras off, Bonnie confronts Shane about the murders. He tells her that he killed them as part of a ritual, and Silas will resurrect them when he awakens. She calls him crazy, before Shane reminds her that she can see her grandmother again. When Bonnie attacks him with magic, Shane tells her father that she can be the most powerful witch on earth or a time bomb Elena visits Jeremy, who tries not to kill her. Damon arrives, telling Elena he wants to make amends to Jeremy, and they go to the Mystic Grill (where he and Matt are). Damon approaches Jeremy, who goes into an isolated storage room. Deducing that Kol ordered him to kill Jeremy, Damon warns Elena to keep him away from her brother. He follows Jeremy down a passageway under the bar, warning Jeremy that he has been sent to kill him. In Shane's study, Rebekah tortures the man (who kills himself by biting off his tongue). Although Elena asks Stefan for help, he seems indifferent. Jeremy shoots Damon in the head and escapes; Kol returns to town and meets Rebekah, who tries to stab him but is stopped by Klaus.

It stars Prosenjit Chatterjee, Indraneil Sengupta, Swastika Mukherjee, Aryann Bhowmik ,and many others. The plot revolves around a hieroglyphic trail that leads the protagonist to Egypt and underneath a pyramid. The film became one of the biggest hits of 2013 and gained a strong cult following from the audience and critics. The second film of this Kakababu series Yeti Obhijaan was released in 2017. The third film, Kakababur Protyaborton, is scheduled to be released in 2020. Plot Mishawr Rawhoshyo starts with Kakababu (Prosenjit Chatterjee) and his nephew Shontu (Aryann Bhowmik) smiling after watching news informing of the imminent overthrow of the dictatorship in Egypt. The film rewinds into a flashback. It is 2010. Kakababu is contracted by Egyptian businessman Al Mamun (Rajit Kapur) to decipher the meanings of hieroglyphic symbols that his teacher, Mufti Muhammad (Barun Chanda), had drawn on a piece of paper supposedly during his sleep. Muhammad is terminally ill and is about to grant his last wish while he is being treated in Delhi. Mamun thinks that the symbols are the key for locating Mufti Muhammad's will which will describe where to find treasures Mufti Muhammad had acquired during his tenure as a political leader and revolutionary. However, Kakababu is convinced that the symbols have a different meaning and they are very unusual. Mufti Muhammad symbolically requests Kakababu to verify something, a very unusual last wish. Meanwhile, a war of rivalry ensues between Mamun and Hani Al Qadi (Indraneil Sengupta), another of Mufti Muhammad's disciples (and a rival of Mamun) who accuses Mamun of stealing a secret that isn't rightfully his. While in Delhi, there was an attempt to murder Kakababu, in which Kakababu was injured. Kakababu took the challenge to uncover the truth; he and his nephew Shontu head to Egypt where they are drawn into the vortex of the mystery. Kakababu gets kidnapped by Al Qadi's men which sets off a chain of events, culminating in a climax under a pyramid. Inside the pyramid, Kakababu discovers the lost mummy of an Egyptian queen with the help of the hieroglyphics code written by Mufti Muhammad. The present-day political turmoil in Egypt subtly reverberates. At the end, Kakababu gives Hani Al Qadi the coded message written inside the coffin of the mummy and wishes him good luck for his upcoming revolution to free Egypt from the corrupt dictator Jashni Mubarak (fictionalized Hosni Mubarak).

Filming took place in Cairo, Egypt and Delhi in early 2013, with Chatterjee stating that Mukherji was updating the character to be more contemporary.

The outer movements abound with big swaggering themes whereas the central movement is somewhat calmer. The theme of the finale is related to both the foregoing movements. * Allegro con brio :* this opens with a formidable and bravura octave passage * Adagietto :* lyrical and meditative, it achieves an other- worldly feeling towards the end * Andante maestoso ‚Äì Molto vivace :* the latter part is a kind of moto perpetuo or tarantella, interrupted by quieter episodes.

Origin of Kalabari Name There are many tales that are prevailing with the origin of the name Kalabari:Saikia S. Itibitta. Jatismar. Borbheti. Feb 2007.: 23-30 1\\\\. During the reign of Chutia King Dharmanarayan, Kalabari was the capital of the state. King Dharmanarayan started establishing different projects for the development of the state. The king was very happy to see that all the projects were completed on time with their work and art (Karma and Kala in Assamese). Hence, King Dharmanarayan kept the name Kala-purna gram (meaning artful village) or Kalap gram. Later with the passage of time this words transformed into Kalabri.  Tribes and community  People of Kalabari are either from Mongolians or Aryan race. It is the dwelling place different tribes of Mongolians, Deori, Chutia, Ahom, Bodo, Karbi, Nishi, Nepali, Brahmins, Goshai, kaibatra, Mahanta, Koch, Kalita, Sut, Motok and Mishing.

In 1680, Sargodeu (King in Ahom Dynesty) Rajeshwar Singha under the supervision of Kirtichandra Borbaruah built a dol (temple) at Dologuri Satra (Kalabari Dakhinpat Satra). From the starting of Chot month (Last month of Assamese month) people start practicing Bihu in the field of this Dologuri Satra. After the start of Assamese New Year in Bohag month, the field is filled with the local and non- local people for Bihu celebrations and it ends on around 8th or 9th day of Bohag. On the last day, the young girls play bihu under a big tree in an open field and take blessings for the wellbeing of the society and March forward without looking back. This is called Bihu Bondha or Bihu Uruwa. Another attraction of Dologuri Bihu is the ‚ÄòHepu‚Äô (dyspnea or shortness of breath) performance. According to old people, the birth of Hepu is said to be due to the pressure of domestic problem some people are kept away from Bihu, later on due to desire of uncontrollable mind, they come running for long distance causing shortness of breath or dyspnea which are being used as a peculiar form of Bihu song which is been called as ‚ÄòHepu‚Äô, indigenous only to Dologuri Bihu. After independence of India, with the revolution of time bihu environment too got transformed. The bihu under the tree of Dologuri got transformed into Bihu mela. From, 1963 Bihu competition of invited bihu teams started. Taking Dologuri as an example, many Bihu melas were organized in other parts of Kalabari. In this regard, the Bihu mela organized in 1968 by \\"Sadou Kalabari Bohagi Mela\\" is very well known.

It is located on the outer breakwater of the harbour and has been Grade II Listed since 1978. The fort is not open to the public and remains derelict. On the opposite side of the next stretch of the breakwater is the Portland Breakwater Lighthouse. History and design Designed by Captain E. H. Steward of the Royal Engineers, the circular fort was first planned in 1859. It was built as a result of the Royal Commission to guard the new Portland harbour and Royal Navy institutions on the island. Due to subsidence, the fort was constructed on a granite base, based on a diameter ring of stone laid down on the seabed. The main floor consists of gun rooms and ports for 14 heavy guns. Below the gun floor are the shell and cartridge stores and engine rooms. The fort also has its own harbour and ancillary barrack buildings. The fort cost ¬£75,968 to build.http://victorianforts.co.uk/pdf/datasheets/portlandbreakwater.pdf In 1892, the fort was installed with seven 12.5-inch RML cannons, and these were replaced in 1907 by two 6-inch BL guns and two 12-pounder QF guns. During the World War I, it was armed with two 6-inch BL Mk. VII guns. During World War II, the fort was used as an examination battery. It was reduced to care and maintenance by 1945 and abandoned in 1956. For decades, remains of a cut up 12 inch R.M.L. cannon can be seen out of the water. In 1995, the Dorset Sculpture Trust attempted to gain a grant from the Millennium Fund to turn the site into an arts centre. In 2005, BBC Spotlight's Jonathan Hudston had an exclusive tour of the fort. At the time, it was estimated that it would take ¬£10 million to repair the fort for commercial use, and that it was not a priority for the owners, Portland Port Ltd.

It runs from Ki√ülegg via Wangen to Hergatz and connects the W√ºrttemberg Allg√§u Railway with the Bavarian Allg√§u Railway. The line is not electrified and is all single- track. It is operated by Deutsche Bahn and is shown in its timetable as part of route number 753 from Aulendorf to Hergatz, which is alternatively called the W√ºrttemberg-Allg√§u-Bahn (Allg√§u-W√ºrttemberg Railway) and part of route number 971 from Augsburg to Lindau. The Ki√ülegg‚ÄìWangen section is also integrated in the network of the Bodensee-Oberschwaben Verkehrsverbund (Lake Constance-Upper Swabia Transport Association, bodo). History After the Bavarian town of Hergatz was connected in 1853 and the W√ºrttemberg town of Ki√ülegg was connected in 1870, Wangen remained unconnected to the rail network. 1876, it was decided to build the 13.3 kilometre line to Ki√ülegg, which was opened on 31 July 1880. In 1887, a treaty was contracted between W√ºrttemberg and Bavaria for the construction of the 5.3 km line between Wangen and Hergatz along with a line from Leutkirch to Memmingen. The Wangen‚ÄìHergatz section went into operation on 15 July 1890. Since its completion the new link has allowed a shorter route from Munich to Lindau than the Bavarian Allg√§u Railway via Kempten.

The track from Duvvada to Thadi is under the administrative jurisdiction of South Coast Railway, and the rest of the line from Anakapalle to Vijayawada is under the administrative jurisdiction of South Coast Railway zone headquartered in .  History  Some years before passenger railways started functioning in India railway lines were laid for carrying construction materials. Amongst these were a line used for construction of the Solani aqueduct over the Ganges Canal near Roorkee in the 1830s, the Red Hill Railroad in 1837 used for construction of a canal near Chennai, and the Godavari Dam Construction Railway used for transporting materials for the construction of the Dowlaisweram Anicut at Rajahmundry around 1845. The project was completed in 1852 and the railway was closed down. The Red Hill Railroad near Chennai, used in 1837 for transporting granite, is considered by many as the first operational railway in India. Madras Railway was incorporated in 1853 the Great Southern Railway of India was formed in 1858. The Great Southern Railway of India was merged with the Carnatic Railway in 1872 and renamed South Indian Railways in 1874. The main eastward route of Southern Mahratta Railway connected with other routes till Vijayawada (then known as Bezwada) in 1888. The mainline of Nizam's Guaranteed State Railway was extended to Vijayawada in 1889. During the period 1893 to 1896, of the East Coast State Railway, from Vijayawada to Cuttack was built and opened to traffic. The construction of the Old Godavari Bridge in 1897 and construction of the Vijayawada-Madras link in 1899 enabled the through running of trains. The southern part of the East Coast State Railway (from Waltair to Vijayawada) was taken over by Madras Railway in 1901. = Railway reorganization = In the early 1950s legislation was passed authorizing the central government to take over independent railway systems that were there. On 14 April 1951 the Madras and Southern Mahratta Railway, the South Indian Railway Company and Mysore State Railway were merged to form Southern Railway. Subsequently, Nizam's Guaranteed State Railway was also merged into Southern Railway. On 2 October 1966, the Secunderabad, Solapur, Hubli and Vijayawada Divisions, covering the former territories of Nizam‚Äôs Guaranteed State Railway and certain portions of Madras and Southern Mahratta Railway were separated from Southern Railway to form the South Central Railway . In 1977, Guntakal division of Southern Railway was transferred to South Coast Railway and the Solapur division transferred to Central Railway. Amongst the seven new zones created in 2010 was South Western Railway, which was carved out of Southern Railway. In 2019 it was moved to South Coast Railway zone.

Life and career VerPlanck was born and raised in Newark, New Jersey, the eldest of three siblings. Her father, Anthony J. Pampinella (1908‚Äì1993), operated a gasoline station there, and her mother, Pauline A. Biase (1913‚Äì2008), whose family ran an Italian restaurant. She married trombonist, composer, and arranger J. William \\"Billy\\" VerPlanck (1930‚Äì2009) in 1955, and he became her musical collaborator and champion. They were married for 52 years, until his death in 2009.* The Biographical Encyclopedia of Jazz, edited by Leonard Feather & Ira Gitler, Oxford University Press, p. 665 (1999) VerPlank graduated from Bloomfield High School, and considered a career in journalism. She began performing as a teenager at the age of 19, at a nightclub in Newark, the Well. Her debut album, I Think of You with Every Breath I Take, was released in 1955 when she was 21, and featured Hank Jones, Joe Wilder, Wendell Marshall, Kenny Clarke, and Herbie Mann (uncredited). VerPlanck then went to work as a vocalist for Charlie Spivak's band, and later sang with the Tommy Dorsey bandThe Encyclopedia of Popular Music, Third edition, eight volumes, edited by Colin Larkin, Muze, London (1998) Singing Jazz: The Singers and Their Styles, by Bruce Crowther (born 1933), Mike Pinfold, Miller Freeman, Inc., San Francisco, p. 240 (1997) , LCCN 98193811. and with Tex Beneke‚Ä≤s band. VerPlanck was a prolific studio vocalist for commercial jingles during the 1960s and 1970s, and by the 1960s became known as the \\"New York jingle queen.\\" She recorded thousands of jingles, often for low pay, although her fortunes changed when she sang an arrangement of the 1930s Campbell's Soup \\"M'm M'm Good\\" song, which became widely known.John S. Wilson, Familiar TV Voice Sings on 8th Street, New York Times, May 30, 1918. Other notable jingles she recorded included \\"Nationwide is on your side\\" for the Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company and \\"Weekends were made for Michelob\\" for Anheuser-Busch‚Ä≤s Michelob beer. She later told the press that the latter was highly lucrative for her, because she put a \\"Yeah!\\" at the end of the jingle that was used over and over again in versions of the jingle recorded by Billy Eckstine, Vic Damone, and Brook Benton, earning her continued royalties. Her jingle work allowed her to hone the clarity of her diction when singing, and she became known for her ability to enunciate the lyrics of songs clearly even while investing them with emotion. Although she toiled largely in obscurity, her voice became widely known to millions of people during the 1960s and 1970s through the familiarity and popularity of her jingles. VerPlanck also sang backup for Tony Bennett, Perry Como, Frank Sinatra, and Mel Torme, and she performed around the United States and internationally as a cabaret singer. Despite her long and successful career in jingles and as a studio backing vocalist, her second solo album, Marlene VerPlanck Loves Johnny Mercer, was not recorded until 1979, 24 years after her first album. Her solo career then began in earnest, and she released more than 20 albums, mostly on the Audiophile label, and toured extensively as a soloist. She specialized in the Great American Songbook, especially the works of Irving Berlin, Jerome Kern, Johnny Mercer, Cole Porter, and Richard Rodgers, and gained a reputation as one of the most accomplished interpreters of the genre. In January 1983, VerPlanck took part in recording In the Digital Mood, an early all-digital recording of the music of Glenn Miller by the Glenn Miller Orchestra. The album included two vocal tracks ‚Äì \\"Chattanooga Choo-Choo\\" and \\"(I've Got a Gal In) Kalamazoo\\", and VerPlanck was invited to sing the female vocals in a recreation of the singing group The Modernaires, which consisted of one female and four male vocalists, and to bring four male colleagues with her to sing the four male vocal parts. The album's producers expected her to bring unknown session and back-up singers with her, but she surprised and delighted the producers and the orchestra by arriving with Julius LaRosa, Mel Torme, Michael Mark, and Marty Nelson for the recording session on January 20, 1983.Anonymous, Liner notes for \\"The Glenn Miller Orchestra: In the Digital Mood,\\" GFRP Records, 1983. VerPlanck last performed in December 2017 at a jazz club in New York City. She died of pancreatic cancer at a hospital in Manhattan, New York City on January 14, 2018, aged 84 and was buried at Mt.

Q Society described itself as \\"Australia's leading Islam-critical organisation\\" and stated that its purpose was to fight against the \\"Islamisation of Australia\\". The Q Society was so named because it was founded at a meeting in the Melbourne suburb of Kew in 2010. The president of the Q Society was Debbie Robinson, who was also president of Yellow Vest Australia (which until 9 April 2019 was known as the Australian Liberty Alliance). and was an unsuccessful Senate candidate for the party for Western Australia at the 2019 Australian federal election. On 13 February 2020, the Q Society announced that it would deregister itself due to a considerable lack of financial support, being unable to cover basic administration costs, effective from 30 June 2020. History =Symposium on Liberty and Islam= In March 2014, the Q Society held a Symposium on Liberty and Islam in Melbourne. Speakers at the event included Nonie Darwish, an Egyptian-American human rights activist who was raised as a Muslim, and is director of Former Muslims United, an organisation set up to protect former Muslims from persecution. Geert Wilders appeared via video link criticising \\"politicians who don't share our values and foolishly declare all cultures are equal\\". Wilders was referring to Islam, suggesting that Muslim cultures are inferior to non-Muslim cultures. As with a previous visit by Wilders in 2013, a number of Australian newspapers refused to publish advertisements for the event. =Bendigo mosque protests= In 2014, the Q Society provided information and training to a number of groups involved in the Voices of Bendigo and Stop the Mosques Bendigo protests. The protests were held to oppose construction of a mosque and Islamic community centre in the rural Victorian centre of Bendigo. The information and training was given to a number of groups, including a number of far-right and neo-Nazi groups including the militant white nationalist street gang Australian Defence League, the neo-Nazi True Blue Crew and the United Patriots Front. Opponents of the mosque displayed anti-mosque information produced by Q Society at a meeting of the Bendigo City Council. During council meetings Q Society members distributed pamphlets that made numerous claims about mosques that included statements such as \\"A mosque is not like a church or a temple\\" and \\"[mosques] are a seat of government, a command centre, a court, and in some cases used as military training centres and arms depots\\". =El-Mouelhy defamation case= In 2015, Mohammed El-Mouelhy, the head of the Halal Certification Authority, commenced defamation proceedings against the Q Society and Kirralie Smith, who also runs the website HalalChoices, over their claims at a Q Society event that the halal certification in Australia is corrupt and funds \\"the push for sharia law in Australia\\", claiming that El-Mouelhy was portrayed as \\"part of a conspiracy to destroy Western civilisation from within\\" and \\"reasonably suspected of providing financial support to terrorist organisations\\". El- Mouelhy claimed he has been defamed in relation to the proceeds of halal certification. In February 2017, the case was settled out of court, and as part of the settlement agreement, Smith and the Q Society publicly apologised and agreed to display notice of the settlement on their respective websites for one year.https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2017/02/27/Settlement_Announcement.pdf In response to the claims made by Smith and HalalChoices, officials from the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission stated that the commission has been on \\"heightened lookout\\" for links between halal certifiers and terrorism since the issue surfaced last year, but has \\"not found any direct linkages\\". A Senate inquiry into food certification asserted that there was \\"no link\\" between the religious approval process and extremist groups. It recommended that the federal government increase its oversight of domestic halal certifiers to address fraudulent conduct in the sector. It said that it had heard, \\"credible reports suggesting that the lack of regulation has been unscrupulously exploited\\". In tabling the report, committee chairman Sam Dastyari said, \\"Some certifiers are nothing more than scammers\\". The committee recommended a single halal certification authority. The committee in recommending clearer labelling, specifically referred to the need for meat processors to label products sourced from animals subject to religious slaughter. =2017 fundraiser= On 9 February 2017, the Q Society held a fundraising dinner, which they described as Defending Freedom of Speech, that drew widespread criticism after Islamophobia and homophobia were documented. For example, guest speaker Larry Pickering stated \\"If they (Muslims) are in the same street as me, I start shaking\\" and \\"They are not all bad, they do chuck pillow-biters off buildings\\" adding \\"I can't stand Muslims\\". The cartoonist also auctioned an overtly Islamophobic work depicting the rape of a woman in a niqab by her son-in-law. Another Pickering cartoon auctioned at the fundraiser depicted an imam as a pig being spit roasted, with a \\"halal certified\\" stamp on its rump. A case of wine called \\"72 Virgins\\" was auctioned, as well a signed photograph of Dame Joan Sutherland. Kirralie Smith denied supporting Pickering's statements; however she reiterated parts of the speech stating that \\"there are Muslims that actually do throw gays off buildings!\\". Politicians Cory Bernardi and George Christensen attracted criticism for speaking at the event, which also drew protests for being racist. Ross Cameron also spoke as a VIP member at the fundraiser. =Guests and lecture tours= The group brought a number of controversial speakers to Australia, including Somali-born ex-Muslim activist Ayaan Hirsi Ali, UK planning lawyer and anti-mosque campaigner Gavin Boby, Sudanese human rights activist Simon Deng and far-right, anti-Islam Dutch politician Geert Wilders. The Australian government initially delayed the issue of a visa for Wilders. However, the then Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen, eventually granted the visa. The tour was overshadowed by a total of 30 venues refusing or cancelling bookings. Former Premier of Western Australia, Colin Barnett, stated that Wilders was not welcome in his State. Islamic leaders in Sydney and Melbourne recommended that these talks be ignored, so as to avoid or minimise the possibility of violent protests. An estimated 200 protestors picketed the Melbourne event. Commentary and criticism Critics of Q Society suggest the organisation is responsible for hate-mongering against Muslims, describing Q Society as a modern example of \\"organised intolerance\\". In 2011, Q Society circulated a petition objecting to a Muslim prayer group in St Kilda, a suburb of Melbourne. Several Jewish community leaders in Melbourne opposed the petition. Deborah Stone of the B'nai B'rith Anti-Defamation Commission (ADC), which actively counters prejudice against Jews (including from fundamentalist Muslims) stated that the fears of the Q Society were greatly exaggerated: \\"Assuming Muslims are terrorists is the same as expecting that Italians running a restaurant will be using it as a Mafia hideout, or that the local Catholic school is sheltering a paedophile priest\\". The Port Phillip council strongly supported social diversity and multiculturalism, and the Muslim prayer group had not caused concern until the Q Society intervened. In 2014, following the group's involvement in the Voices of Bendigo and Stop the Mosques Bendigo protests, State MP Jacinta Allan described the group's actions as an attempt to divide the community, stating that \\"Bendigo has a proud history of tolerance and diversity dating back to the gold rush era, and we'll work hard to preserve and build upon it\\". Political affiliations Several prominent members and supporters of Q Society are current or former members of the Liberal‚ÄìNational Coalition including Cory Bernardi, George Christensen, Angry Anderson and Ross Cameron. Bernardi and Christensen were criticised for speaking at the Q Society fundraising event in February 2017, an event which protesters called racist. Kirralie Smith and Debbie Robinson, both members of the Q Society, were founding members of the far-right political party Australian Liberty Alliance (now called Yellow Vest Australia). Smith was an ALA Senate candidate for New South Wales at the 2016 federal election. At that election the party also endorsed former National Party candidate Angry Anderson as its candidate for the Senate representing New South Wales. On 7 April 2017, Smith, still a member of the Q Society, joined the Australian Conservatives. Robinson continued to be the president of Yellow Vest Australia, and was that party's Senate candidate for Western Australia at the 2019 federal election.

Kreshpan is a hilly area characterized by low average rainfall. Lower temperatures ranging up -3Àöc -2Àöc high temperatures range from 36C up to 40C. History The antiquity of life on Kreshpan speak many facts and documents. Convincing argument is the fact of finding coins, in 1980, of one of the Illyrian kings, the most famous king Monun. This fact speaks for living in this village in the early centuries of the second third, BC, apparently, part of the tribe neighboring stones Cakran Zest. According to Turkish First Registry (Arvanid Sancag) of 1431, in Kreshpan then living 31 families and a half (half considered a widow).

Also in the flow of religious conversions, with the correct documents, it confirmed that in 1825, residents of Kreshpan had returned completely, 100%, from Christian to Muslim.

Even in this time of work trying to increase more and more yields in cereals and bread, farming and fruit growing.

Both sections of the Offences against the Person Act 1861 (sections 20 versus section 47) only require damage to have resulted from a violent or otherwise malicious act of the defendant. An appellate court may use its statutory power under a 1968 Act to substitute a charge with an appropriate lesser charge. The latter offence, equally a misdemenour was held to apply to a precise fact pattern which included pouring one's large glass of drink over someone with the glass slipping and cutting a wrist; and to another which included three month's of rough-handling child cruelty. Savage's case =Facts= Susan Savage, threw her pint of beer over Tracey Beal her husband's ex-girlfriend, in a pub, late on 31 March 1989. In doing so the glass slipped from her hand and cut the victim's wrist. She claimed that she had only meant to throw the beer (a very minor battery, often not prosecuted); and that see never foresaw a risk of injury. =Jury findings and legal interpretation of fact= The jury assessed much testimony (including expert medical witness evidence). They concluded that she had deliberately thrown the beer and recklessly or accidentally but foreseeably (negligently) allowed the glass to slip. In either case they found no intent, nor imputed intent from all the circumstances (on which legally valid jury instructions were given), to wound or occasion grievous bodily. She was convicted of malicious wounding (under the section not requiring specific intent): section 20 of Offences against the Person Act 1861. =Savage's first-level appeal= The Court of Appeal quashed the conviction by substituting one under less severe s47 of the Act: Assault occasioning actual bodily harm (common assault occasioning actual bodily harm). It determined, on conflicting authorities, it had the power to do so for these particular, similar offences. Convicted Savage accepted minor battery with the beer but as to the substantive injury caused she appealed for acquittal or for a retrial to the highest court. Parmenter's case =Facts= Philip Parmenter rough-handled his baby son during his first three months and three days. He caused, not realising the extent of vulnerability of babies, suffering and injuries to the boney structures of the legs and right forearm. =Guilty plea to child cruelty, other jury findings and legal interpretations= He was indicted on eight counts, six represented three- paired alternatives, laid under section 18 and 20 of the Act (section 18 being the specific intent section) for wounding or grievous bodily harm. The eighth charge, child cruelty, saw a guilty plea. The others (stated) remained countered with he did not realise his rough handling would cause such injury. The jury convicted under the co-offered section 20, rather than 18; for all three occasions (time-linked charges). =Parmenter's first-level appeal= The appeal hearingseeking acquittalwas granted. The panel sought a pathway to a lesser offence substitution, i.e. section 47 however could find no clearly permissible one. The Court of Appeal opined \\"[Section 20 and section 47] can no longer live together, and that the reason lies in a collision between two ideas, logically and morally sustainable in themselves, but mutually inconsistent, about whether the unforeseen consequences of a wrongful act should be punished according to the intent ([per] R v Cunningham [1957] 2 Q.B. 396) or the consequences ([per] Reg. v. Mowatt [1968] 1 QB 421.\\"). They quashed thus the convictions. They found they could not substitute the lesser offence, per the reasoning given. The Crown appealed to the highest court against the jury verdict-quashing acquittal. Final appeal hearing The court reasoned the offences on identical grounds so heard the appeals together, reaching the same outcome. It gave a long reasoned judgment to serve as a detailed precedent and synopsis of earlier ones and, respectively, affirmed and imposed section 47 convictions on the two separate-facts defendants.

Although commonly referred to as Africanus Fabius Maximus, it remains unclear whether that was his official name or whether it was Quintus Fabius Maximus Africanus. His elder brother was Paullus Fabius Maximus (consul 11 BCE) and his sister was Fabia Paullina, who married Marcus Titius.

It is believed that Africanus' earliest post was as a military tribune in Spain, though this is not certain. His only two certain civilian posts were as ordinary consul in 10 BCE (with Iullus Antonius), and as proconsul of Africa in 6/5 BCE.Syme, Augustan Aristocracy (1989), p. 320 He was admitted to the priesthood of the septemviri epulonum at some point after 25 BCE.Martha W.

A member of Balad, he served as a member of the Knesset for Balad and the Joint List from 2015 until 2017. In December 2016, he was stripped of his diplomatic immunity and arrested after he was caught on video providing convicted Palestinian terrorists with cell phones and SIM cards. He served a two-year prison term over the crime. Biography A Christian Arab, Ghattas originates from Rameh. During high school he established the National Committee of Arab High School students with his cousin, Azmi Bishara. During his time at university he also established Arab student groups. After finishing university he opened an engineering firm in Rameh. At the age of 22 he was elected Deputy Leader of the town council as a member of Rakah, which later became Maki. He was ejected from the party in 1990 after challenging its pro-Soviet stance. He then helped found Brit Shivyon, a short-lived Jewish-Arab movement, before becoming a founder member of Balad in 1995. He later attended the Technion, where he gained a PhD in environmental engineering, and joined the Galilee Society, an NGO involved in health and environmental issues with the Arab community. In 2007 he established Malakom, the only business magazine targeted at the Israeli Arab community. Having initially chosen not to run for the Knesset after Balad was founded, in 2012 Ghattas was placed third on the party's list for the 2013 Knesset elections, and was elected to the Knesset as the party won three seats. Prior to the 2015 elections Balad joined the Joint List alliance; Ghattas was placed eleventh on the alliance's list, and was re- elected as it won 13 seats. On 20 December 2016, Ghattas was questioned by police after he was filmed smuggling cellphones and SIM cards to Palestinian security prisoners in Ketziot Prison during a visit. Due to his parliamentary immunity, he had not been subjected to a security check at the prison gates. On 22 December 2016, hours before a planned Knesset vote to strip Ghattas of his parliamentary immunity, Ghattas voluntarily relinquished his parliamentary immunity and was arrested shortly after police found 12 cellphones and 16 SIM cards on Palestinian security prisoners whom he had visited. Ghattas faced charges of aiding terrorists, complicity in committing a felony, deceptive practices, breach of trust and violation of the Prison Service code. He gave up his seat in March 2017 after agreeing to resign from the Knesset and be jailed for two years after smuggling notes and phones to Palestinian terrorists in Israeli jails.Arab MK signs plea bargain, agrees to go to jail Times of Israel, 16 March 2017 On 21 March his seat was taken by Juma Azbarga.Replacements Among Knesset Members Knesset On 2 July 2017, he arrived at Gilboa Prison to begin serving his sentence. In November 2018, a parole board rejected a request by Ghattas to grant him parole after serving one- third of his sentence. The parole board ruled that he had failed to express genuine remorse for his actions and noted that he had failed to enroll in a rehabilitation program.https://www.timesofisrael.com/ex-mk-imprisoned-for- smuggling-cellphones-to-terrorists-denied-early-release/ He was released on 27 May 2019.

The nominations were in by 6 July and the date of the election set for just a week later.The Times, 7 July 1917 p5 Cllr Thomas' position was that Parliament should be composed of businessmen but also campaigned as supporter of temperance and a voice in Parliament not bound by the party whip. Sir Garrod Thomas appealed to the electorate's sense of patriotism and the need for solidarity during this period of great national struggle. He made the successful prosecution of the war the principal plank of his campaigning. Garrod Thomas was supported by a letter from the prime minister underlining the wartime nature of the contest and held a number of public meetings.

Safe Haven was the only official U.S. Government activity to rescue Jewish refugees during the Second World War, for victims of the Nazi Holocaust. The refugees were brought from Italy, but deliberately only from other parts of Europe. They were all fleeing from the Nazis. They were deliberately chosen so that some incoming refugees were non-Jewish,so as to allay anti-semitic fears. They were placed in Fort Ontario, behind barbed wire, and given no official status, and were told they would be returned to their homelands after the war, and would have no rights as regards entering the United States. In fact, due to political pressure, at the war's end they were allowed to stay in the United States. Parenthetically, the group included a whole group of Boy Scouts.

It is one of the few surviving pre-Mongol buildings in Russia, and the northernmost one. The cathedral is the katholikon of the female Dormition Monastery, one of the several monasteries in Staraya Ladoga, and is located on the left bank of the Volkhov River. The building was designated an architectural monument of federal significance (#4710028015). History Staraya Ladoga was the first seat of Rurik in 862, and, after Rurik moved the seat to Novgorod, remained in the Novgorod Lands. It controlled one of the most important waterways at the time, the Trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks, of which the Volkhov River was a part of. The cathedral was built presumably in the third quarter of the 12th century by Novgorodians. It was rebuilt several times since. In 1761, a side-chapel was built at the northern side of the cathedral, and in 1854-1856 another two were built at the western side, and a bell-tower was erected. In 1925, the cathedral was closed for service. In the 1950s, a complex restoration was performed, the side chapels and the bell-tower were demolished. In 2005, the cathedral was returned to the Russian Orthodox Church. Architecture The cathedral is made of plinthite and has a very simple composition. The western wall has two relief crosses. Frescoes In the 12th century, the interior of the church was covered by frescoes. The 20th century restorations uncovered approximately of the original painting, but most of them in fragments, so that it is difficult to reconstruct the original topics and disposition. The frescoes seem to be close in style to those in Polotsk and in Veliky Novgorod.

Its political leanings have been described variously as nonpartisan, hawkish, and neoconservative. FDD holds events throughout the year, including its annual Washington Forum, briefings on Capitol Hill, expert roundtables for public officials, diplomats, and military officers, book releases, and panel discussions and debates within the policy community. FDD publishes research on foreign policy and security issues, focusing on subjects such as nuclear-non proliferation, cyber threats, sanctions, illicit finance, and policy surrounding North Korea, Iran, Russia, the war in Afghanistan, and other areas of study. FDD has been identified as part of the Israel lobby in the United States by several scholarly sources.For example, see the following sources:    History and mission  FDD was founded shortly after the September 11 attacks in 2001. In the initial documents filed for tax-exempt status in Internal Revenue Service, the FDD stated its mission \\"was to provide education to enhance Israel's image in North America and the public's understanding of issues affecting Israeli-Arab relations\\". Later documents described the mission as \\"to conduct research and provide education on international terrorism and related issues\\". On its website, FDD describes itself as a \\"a non-profit, non-partisan 501(c)3 policy institute\\", with focus \\"on foreign policy and national security that combines policy research, democracy and counterterrorism education, strategic communications and investigative journalism in support of its mission to promote pluralism, defend democratic values and fight the ideologies that drive terrorism\\". FDD has been identified as part of the Israel lobby in the United States by several scholarly sources. Sima Vaknin-Gil, Director General of Israel's Ministry of Strategic Affairs, had stated that the FDD works in conjunction with Israeli government, in particular the ministry she works for. Later documents described the mission as \\"to conduct research and provide education on international terrorism and related issues\\". On 15 November 2019, FDD was officially registered as a lobby under Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995.  Funding  According to Dennis Jett, FDD \\"offers hardly any information on where its money comes from and where it goes\\". = 2001‚Äì2004 = Money contributed to the FDD during first decade of its activity, based on calculations made by Christopher Bail, expanded by 442%. In 2011, news website ThinkProgress published FDD's Form 990 documents that revealed where FDD funding came from, from 2001 to 2004. Top donors included: *Roland Arnall: $1,802,000 *Edgar M. and Charles Bronfman: $1,050,000 *Michael Steinhardt: $850,000 * Abramson Family Foundation (of Leonard Abramson): $822,523 *Bernard Marcus: $600,000 *Lewis Ranieri: $350,000 Other notable donors who gave lesser money during the same period were: *Haim Saban *Jennifer Laszlo Mizrahi *Douglas J. Feith = 2008‚Äì2011 = FDD's Schedule A documents filed by the end of the 2011 tax year, indicates that the organization from 2008 to 2011 was funded more than $20,000,000, and the top three donors were: *Bernard Marcus: $10,745,000 *Paul Singer: $3,600,000 *Sheldon Adelson: $1,510,059 = 2017 = In 2018, AP reported that the United Arab Emirates has wired $2,500,000 to the FDD through Elliott Broidy and George Nader, to host a conference amidst Qatar diplomatic crisis about the country's role as a state- sponsor of terrorism. FDD stated that it does not accept money from foreign governments, adding that \\"[a]s is our funding policy, we asked if his funding was connected to any foreign governments or if he had business contracts in the Gulf. He assured us that he did not\\". Adam Hanieh states that the FDD high-profile conference of 23 May 2017 was in line with UAE's policy at the time, which officially alleged that Qatar finances Islamist groups, adding that emails leaked shortly after show that UAE's Ambassador Yousef Al Otaiba had a \\"cosy relationship\\" with the FDD, and had reviewed the remarks made by Robert Gates at the convention. = Others = Additionally, it is known that as of 2016, FDD has received donations from the following institutions: * Abstraction Fund * Hertog Foundation * Jacobson Family Foundation * Klarman Family Foundation * Koret Foundation * Milstein Family Foundation * Nathan Seter Foundation * Newton and Rochelle Becker Charitable Trust * Snider Foundation * Hochberg Family Foundation * Marcus Foundation * Bodman Foundation * Emerson Family Foundation * Eris & Larry Field Family Foundation * Rita & Irwin Hochberg Family Foundation * Anchorage Charitable Fund * William Rosenwald Family Fund * Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation Activities =The Iran Project= Iran's government officially threatened FDD and its CEO Mark Dubowitz, enacting sanctions against the CEO, and implicitly threatening the think tank with force from the Iranian state's \\"security apparatus,\\" as implied in Tehran's own official announcement. Led by CEO Mark Dubowitz, FDD's Iran Program seeks to \\"address the threat posed by the Islamic Republic of Iran to America and its allies, FDD conducts detailed research, develops actionable and comprehensive policy options, and appears regularly in media.\\" FDD says it does this through attacking Iran's \\"most vulnerable points: its worldwide media operations, its standing in the United States and Europe, its finances, and its efforts to support terrorist activities abroad\\". Specifically, FDD concerns itself with Iran's nuclear ambitions through its Iran Energy Project and Iran's human rights abuses through its Iran Human Rights Project. In 2008, FDD founded the Iran Energy Project which \\"conducts extensive research on ways to deny the Iranian regime the profits of its energy sector\\". The Wall Street Journal credited FDD with bringing \\"the idea of gasoline sanctions to political attention.\\" FDD's bi- partisan approach to advocating sanctions legislation has earned praise from Congressmen in both parties. Congressman Howard Berman (D-CA) thanked the organization saying \\"FDD has been one the most committed and creative voices in Washington regarding the Iran nuclear issue and specifically Iran sanctions\\". FDD's efforts to target the Iranian regime's finances has gone beyond energy sanctions. The organization pushed for sanctions against the Central Bank of the Islamic Republic of Iran and its use of Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) to perform transactions. According to The Wall Street Journal, FDD \\"has done most of the spadework on the issue\\". =The Syria Project= For years, Syria has been a focus of FDD's research because of its alignment with Iran and support for organizations such as Hezbollah. In 2012, as the Arab Spring spread to Syria, FDD launched \\"The Syria Project\\" to support dissident efforts in removing the Assad regime. In that effort, FDD facilitated a Skype call between dissidents and U.S. journalists in 2012 and produced multiple studies and memos urging U.S. officials to act. =Long War Journal= Long War Journal is a FDD project dedicated to reporting the Global War on Terror launched by the United States and its allies following the attacks of September 11, 2001. Under the direction of FDD senior fellows Bill Roggio and Thomas Joscelyn, this website covers stories about countries such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia, Syria, and Iraq and follows the actions of al Qaeda and its affiliates. According to the Columbia Journalism Review, \\"Roggio's greatest service, then, may be the way he picks up where the mainstream press leaves off, giving readers a simultaneously more specific and holistic understanding of the battlefield\\". = European Foundation for Democracy = Personnel Clifford May, FDD's founder and current president = Executives = * Clifford May, President * Mark Dubowitz, CEO * Toby Dershowitz, Senior Vice President for Government Relations and Strategy * Tyler Stapleton, Deputy for Congressional Relations * John Hannah, Senior Counselor * Bill McCarthy, COO * Lawrence Muscant, Senior Vice President * Jonathan Schanzer, Vice President for Research Former staff include: * Nir Boms (President) = Board of directors = As of 2005, members of FDD's board of directors were: *Steve Forbes *Jack Kemp *Jeane Kirkpatrick ‚Äì Open access material licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License. = Advisors = The following people served as advisors to FDD as of 2005: * Newt Gingrich * James Woolsey * Bill Kristol * Richard Perle = Fellows = * Walid Phares * Michael Ledeen * Emanuele Ottolenghi * Olli Heinonen * Orde Kittrie Criticism Arun Kundnani, adjunct professor at New York University, in a review of FDD publication Homegrown Terrorists in the US and UK argues that as a work \\"typical of many in its approach and conclusions\\", it does not provide empirical evidence for assumptions it makes and neglects contradicting data as a result of an influence by politics of the publisher and funders, and bias in favor of knowledge claims. Lawrence Wilkerson has criticized FDD for \\"pushing falsehood\\" in support of waging wars. The International Relations Center features a report on the foundation on its \\"Right Web\\" website, a program of the think tank Institute for Policy Studies which, according to its mission statement, seeks to \\"check the militaristic drift of the country\\". The report states that \\"although the FDD is an ardent critic of terrorism, it has not criticized actions taken by Israel against Palestinians that arguably fall into this category\\". The left- leaning political blog ThinkProgress has criticized FDD for \\"alarmist rhetoric and fear mongering\\", for example in April 2002 when they aired a 30-second television ad campaign called \\"Suicide Strategy\\" that was described by critics as \\"conflating\\" Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat with the likes of Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein. As FDD explained it: \\"a militant Islamic terrorist who 'martyrs' himself by hijacking a plane and flying it into the World Trade Center\\"‚Äîi.e., the September 11 attacks‚Äî\\"is no different from a militant Islamic terrorist who 'martyrs' himself by strapping explosives to his body and walking into a hotel\\"‚Äîi.e., Palestinian suicide attacks. Islamophobia accusations Christopher A. Bail, professor of sociology, public policy and data science at Duke University, describes FDD as an \\"anti-Muslim fringe organization\\" that has tried to establish itself as a legitimate authority on Islam and terrorism by tactically using \\"ethnic experts\\" ‚Äîi.e. pundits with Middle Eastern background who were not Muslim‚Äî because they advocate views contrary to the mainstream perspective of the Muslim community in the United States, but look like and talk like Muslims. Sarah Marusek, research fellow at University of Johannesburg, argues that FDD is one of the \\"key organizations peddling Islamophobia\\" in a \\"transatlantic network\\". Farid Hafez, researcher at Universit√§t Salzburg, asserts the same.

The granddaughter of aviation pioneer and United States Air Force General Jimmy Doolittle, she is an enthusiastic speaker and represents the Doolittle family at events throughout the world. Hoppes' works celebrate the veterans and civilians who defended their countries and document their stories that would otherwise be lost. Her publications have been favorably reviewed by various trade magazines. Early years Hoppes was born the second of John and Priscilla Doolittle's five children. Her father, one of James H. Doolittle's two sons, is a retired USAF colonel who flew combat missions in both the Korean War and Vietnam War. Her siblings include an older sister, Jody, a younger sister, Penny, and twin brothers, Peter and Patrick. During her childhood, she spent many hours with her grandparents, whom she called Granny and Gramps, when they lived in San Francisco and later in Los Angeles, California. The Doolittle Raiders, who flew with her grandfather on the 1942 mission to bomb Tokyo, were part of her extended family, and she would sometimes attend their yearly reunions. Honorary raiders, such as historian Colonel Carroll. V. Glines, became important figures in Hoppes' life. Glines would later write the foreword to her book, Calculated Risk. Career =Educator and author= Hoppes works at the 61st Mission Support Squadron's Educational Office - a unit of the 61st Air Base Group stationed at Los Angeles Air Force Base. She started her first book in response to the film, Pearl Harbor, to correct inaccuracies about her grandfather's character and actions during World War II. Actor Alec Baldwin initially portrayed Doolittle as an ill-tempered man prone to using profanity, but the depiction was corrected after Hoppes presented the family's objections. Although Calculated Risk presented the achievements of Jimmy Doolittle, the book also included many details about the family such as Doolittle's wife of 71 years, Josephine Daniels. One reviewer described the book as \\"an ode to her grandmother\\", whom Hoppes herself described as a woman with the patience of a saint who was the rudder of Doolittle's life. Calculated Risk received positive reviews from a number of trade publications including Library Journal, Publishers Weekly, and Booklist. Hoppes' fulfilled her passion for meeting people of the Greatest Generation and hearing the stories of their service. Her second book, Just Doing My Job, is a collection of such stories to educate the public and to document the personal reflections for future generations. A review by Publishers Weekly found the story about Japanese-American soldier, Dick Hamada, who worked for the Office of Strategic Services intelligence agency \\"particularly fascinating.\\" Hoppes called for veterans of all conflicts to record their stories using programs such as the Veterans History Project. We Represented All Women, Hoppes' account of Violet ‚ÄúVi‚Äù Cowden of the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASPs), appeared on the Air & Space/Smithsonian web site in June 2009. Hoppes is working on a third book that will include interviews with other World War II veterans including Major General Johnny Alison. As of 2013, Hoppes serves on the board of directors for the Warhawk Air Museum in Nampa, Idaho, and the Air Force Historical Foundation. =Television= Hoppes provided insight to a number of television programs. In 2007, she appeared on From Vengeance to Forgiveness, the story of Corporal Jake DeShazer, a Doolittle Raider who was captured by the Japanese. Although he suffered years of abuse at the hands of his captors, DeShazer later forgave his enemies and returned to Japan as a missionary. In 2008, Hoppes appeared on The History Channel's Man, Moment, Machine series that described historical events in the context of the key person involved, the machine used by that person, and the outcome of the moment. In the episode Doolittle's Daring Raid, Hoppes described her grandfather's childhood and love of flying. She also described the despair her grandfather felt when he thought the raid on Japan had failed. =Presentations= Hoppes speaking at the Fantasy of Flight's Officer's Club in 2011 Hoppes began giving presentations to the public to ensure the memory of her grandfather was accurately portrayed. She has since presented many lectures at events throughout the United States and Europe including: * Growing up with General James Doolittle A General Electric Aviation series lecture held on April 6, 2006 at the National Air and Space Museum in Washington D.C. * Doolittle Returns to BassingbournA photographic remembrance of Jimmy Doolittle held on May 23, 2009 at the Tower Museum at RAF Bassingbourn, England.

In 2011 the building was completely destroyed by a fire. The church was built in the Kirkehaugen district of Eastern Porsgrunn. The church site is located on Kirkebakken 17, just east of Fylkesvei 356. History =Planning= In the mid-1700s, the wealthy population of Porsgrunn wanted a new church on the east side of the neighborhood. The reason for this was mainly prestige but also politics, as the building of a grand church in Porsgrunn would prove that the neighborhood in Skien was prosperous enough to be a city in its own right. Also, despite the fact that Vestre Porsgrunn Church had just been built, there was no bridge across the Porsgrunn River, so the residents of eastern Porsgrunn had to travel all the way to Eidanger Church in Eidanger to worship. The idea for a church on the east side of Porsgrunn was a few years in the making, but came to fruition due to the influence and capital of a few of the city's wealthy merchants, shipowners and ironworks owners. On 9 August 1754, a message urging residents to donate towards a new church was sent out by four of Porsgrunn's most important men, all of whom were successful businessmen with connections to Danish royalty. The men were: Danish brothers Carl Deichmann and Wilhelm Deichmann, literary publishers and co-owners of Fossum Ironworks in Skien, Ulrich Frederik Schnell, owner of N√¶s Ironworks in Holt, and customs officer Thomas Lange. The fundraising campaign was a huge success, and within a short time, the men had collected between four and five thousand rigsdaler for the church. The land that was to be the future site of √òstre Porsgrunn Church was donated by Friederich Biener, who owned the land as part of his J√∏nholt farm and used it as a pen for his horses. Since they now had the land and the funds required, the new committee for √òstre Porsgrunn Church just needed permission from the Danish government to begin construction. In 1755, they sent a petition to King Frederik V in Copenhagen. After four years, on 16 March 1759, they finally got a response, with the king giving the plan his endorsement. The plan would also need to be signed by the local governance, and Bent Bentzen, who was the stadtholder in Skien at the time, reluctantly agreed, saying, \\"I cannot see why the construction of a church in the suburb of Porsgrunn would be necessary, except to reduce Skien, one of the oldest cities in the country, into a pile of rubble.\\" The merchants who funded the church enlisted local Skien resident Joen Jacobsen as the master builder for this project, who had proven himself a capable engineer and builder working on churches in Brevik and Langesund in the years prior. Jacobsen had just finished work as master builder on the Vestre Porsgrunn Church in 1758 when he drafted up architectural plans for the new church in eastern Porsgrunn. However, when he sent his drawings in for approval, he was puzzled to find that the Danish architects had sent them back marked full of corrections. Jacobsen had originally planned to make the church very similar to his previous one in western Porsgrunn, with a traditional Norwegian long rectangular floor plan that represented the sacred road. However, the architects who were responsible for reviewing the plans, renowned architect Lauritz de Thurah and his apprentice Andreas Pf√ºtzner, wanted the church much bigger and with a cruciform floor plan. The architects assumed the church would be built using stone as most were in Denmark, and completely overlooked the limitations of wood in construction. Not wanting to upset the elite in Denmark, Jacobsen kept the revised plans, and while it was standing the church remained not only the largest wooden church in Telemark but also one of the largest in the country. =Construction= Due to the constraints of the revised architectural plans, Joen Jacobsen had to be creative with his carpentry techniques. Since timber framing techniques were not yet commonplace, Jacobsen was constrained to building with logs that were paneled with cut planks on the exterior walls. However, the plans specified right-angled corners, which, while easy to achieve with other materials, was more difficult with wood, since the common saddle notch joint left excess wood protruding from either side of the corners. Subsequently, Jacobsen took advantage of precise cutting techniques from the sawmills in Skien to make use of lap joints () for the logs, almost half a decade before the technique was in common use. The church's steeple was topped with a copper-clad Baroque spire with a unique profile. On top of that lay an elaborate ornamental iron weather vane which was the work of local blacksmith Hans Christian Arveschoug. Construction on √òstre Porsgrunn Church began in 1759 and was completed the next year. The total construction cost came out to 5,836 rigsdaler, 3 ort, and 11 skilling. The church was consecrated on 10 July 1760, an event that was presided over by Bishop of the Diocese of Oslo, Frederik Nannestad. √òstre and Vestre Porsgrunn became their own parishes in 1763, with the death of J√∏rgen Herman Monrad, parish priest of Eidanger, and in 1764, Jeremias Hagerup became the first parish priest of √òstre Porsgrunn parish. The church was restored several times. The first time was in 1888. The second was in 1960, on the 200th anniversary of the church's construction, where it underwent major structural repairs that finished in 1966. After that, there were minor repairs in 1997, when two of the planks in the corners were replaced. Lastly, in 2011, the church was undergoing a further multimillion kroner structural repair following its 250th anniversary in 2010, during which the church was burnt to the ground. Features =Interior= As is characteristic of many of Joen Jacobsen's churches, the church had a wooden barrel vault ceiling, and it was painted with depictions of the sky and angels. The altarpiece was built in 1890 and painted with an image of Jesus on the cross by esteemed Norwegian romantic nationalist painter Axel Ender. The retable that framed the altarpiece was donated by Niels Aall. It was in Baroque style, with two Ionic order pilasters on either side and above it an arched architectural motif superimposed with a cloud shining light to represent God. Surrounding the altar was a semicircular wooden balustrade that served as an altar rail, thought to be another contribution of Jacobsen's. There were two figurines on either side of the retable, one of Moses and the other of Aaron. These were donated by local entrepreneur Nicolai Benjamin Aall, brought back from a trip to the Netherlands. The pulpit was located in one of the interior corners of the crucifix, between two arms of the cross. It was a carved wooden pulpit in the Rococo style, ornamented with round mirrors and gold leaf. The church also contained a pipe organ, which was built by a royal organ builder from Copenhagen. The organ alone made up about 1/3 of the church's building expenses, and it later received a decorative organ case created by Daniel Wroblewsky. The organ was replaced with a new one around 1850. The organ was rebuilt in the early 1980s by Bruno Christensen retaining its organ case and several registers. alt=Small chapel with archway entrance, old photo =Churchyard= The majority of the church grounds are used as a graveyard. The first person buried there was S√∏fren Nielsen, a merchant from the farm Floodeg√•rden, in 1860. Other notable people buried in the graveyard are the city's richest man at the time, Nicolai Benjamin Aall, in 1798, shipowner and politician J√∏rgen Aall in 1833, and former Minister of the Navy in Norway, Jens Schou Fabricius, in 1841. There is also a small chapel for funerals located across the street from √òstre Porsgrunn Church, but still on church land. The chapel was built in 1921 by Haldor Larsen B√∏rve, a local architect who was also responsible for V√•r Frue Church down the road, as well as bigger projects such as Dalen Hotel and the new Porsgrunn City Hall. The chapel was not damaged by the fire and has subsequently been brought back into use following volunteer work by the congregation. Fire On the night of 11 April 2011, √òstre Porsgrunn Church was set alight. The local police were notified at 3:15 in the morning, but when a nearby patrol unit arrived a few minutes later, the fire was already quite large. The police proceeded to evacuate the surrounding neighborhood. By the time the spire collapsed, the building was judged not to be a potential risk of fire spread to the wooden buildings nearby. The evacuation order was called off at 5:07, by which time the church had completely burnt to the ground. Parish priest Per Johan Wiig arrived at the site as soon as he heard the news. He said of the incident, \\"It is very sad, especially for all those who had planned to have baptisms, confirmations, and weddings at the church.\\" He went on to say, \\"What's special about these old churches is that they're not museums, but it is a building that has been in use almost every day for 250 years. And through both joys and sorrows.\\" The estimated value of the church was 41 million kroner, which consisted of 29 million for the building and 12 million for the interior decoration and furnishings. The most valuable items in the church were the organ, altar, and the pulpit, at an estimated value of 6.5 million, 1.3 million, and 1.2 million kroner respectively. The only things saved from the church were a small silver baptismal font and some silver cups and plates used for communion, all objects from 1760 that were kept in a fireproof cupboard. The insurance sum came out to 30 million kroner, as only the building was covered and not the inventory. The money will be used towards building a new church. The fire was suspected to be as a result of arson, as the fire started from the outside of the church and the fast rate at which the fire spread indicated the possible use of an accelerant. The same night, there had also been an attempted arson about away, at Borgestad Church in Skien, but only a few benches were damaged. The police revealed that two boys, aged 17 and 18, were suspected of both incidents. Earlier that night, the 17-year-old suspect had written on Facebook, \\"Now we're going out to play pyromaniac.\\" He later confessed to the arsons at both Borgestad Church and √òstre Porsgrunn Church, under pressure from his mother. The 18-year-old's DNA was discovered on a scarf near the scene of the Borgestad arson, but he still denied involvement. The two suspected arsonists were put on trial at Nedre Telemark District Court, with proceedings beginning on 21 February 2013. The younger suspect was sentenced to three and a half years in prison, and the older four years in prison, and the boys also must pay 34 million kroner in damages. The older suspect has appealed the verdict, and the younger boy has appealed the compensation sum. alt=Map of three municipalities with borders =Reconstruction efforts= There has been a good amount of debate over whether the church should be rebuilt as it stood, or if a more modern church should be built in its place. The planning committee involved in the church's reconstruction recently advised the parish council against making an exact replica of the old church, but encouraged keeping some of the old elements, such as a prominent tower and organ. However, many others want the church to be rebuilt for its historical value, similar to how Fantoft Stave Church was rebuilt in 1997 after it too was destroyed by arson. Others still, such as the local branch of R√∏dt in Porsgrunn, believe that the church should not be rebuilt at all, but instead the land be used for some secular purpose. =Building Project - Pre building phase= During a meeting in the autumn of 2014, the church congregation in attendance agreed to build a new church following the suggestion of the building committee, for a new building meeting the requirements of function and form, rather than for a historic reconstruction. Following this decision the building committee has selected several architect firms to design a new building with a May 2015 deadline, based on the churches requirements, with a final decision made in June 2015. In June, the design competition was completed and a winner was announced - \\"Reis Opp\\". In September 2016, it was announced that (following consultation with the construction company) the church building design had to be modified in order stay within budget. To reduce costs (1) a portion of the church building has been removed, reducing its footprint, and as a consequence (2) the nearby church hall will be no longer be redesigned. It was predicted that the church would be completed late 2017, however, this timeline slipped due to delays in the pre-building and the bureaucratic process. Construction began spring 2018 with completion september 2019. the new church was officially opened 15th september 2020. =Organ Project= In March 2016, the competition process for the churches new organ began.

Fossils of the family Mythicomyiidae are relatively rare, with those preserved in amber even harder to find. The reason for the scarceness of the fossil material is presumed to be the humidity of the Baltic region during the Tertiary, which made the region unsuited to the aridity-loving mythicomyiids. Etymology In 2002, the species was named after the model and actress Carmen Electra by Neal Evenhuis, former president of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature and senior entomologist at the Hawaii Biological Survey. Evenhuis attempted to contact the model to inform her about the naming of Carmenelectra shechisme, but his efforts were unsuccessful. In 2008, he said: \\"The offer's still good.

He has been a fixture in clubs on Chicago's North Side for nearly two decades and has played with numerous blues musicians, including Buddy Guy, A.C. Reed, Magic Slim, and B.B. King. Life and career Alexander was born in Holly Springs, Mississippi, in an area along the Mississippi Blues Trail. His family was \\"poor but honest and hardworking\\" sharecroppers. He moved to Memphis, Tennessee, with his mother and a sister when he was 12 years old. Alexander's interest in music started when a family friend he knew only as Otis taught him enough that when Otis left his guitar as a gift at Alexander's home, he was able pick it up and play. Alexander concentrated on singing as a teenager and later developed his guitar playing. His early influences were blues, country music, and rock and roll, including the blues keyboardist Rosco Gordon and the rock-and-roll artists Chuck Berry and Elvis Presley. In Mississippi, Alexander worked as a porter in a hotel laundry room and later as a bicycle technician. In 1959, he pawned his first guitar to help pay his way to Chicago by Greyhound bus, following a girl he had met in Memphis. In Chicago, he had a series of jobs, working for a car dealer, at a gas station, and as a cook and busboy. He received a pension after he was wounded while working for the Chicago Police Department. Alexander was pulled into the Chicago South Side music scene, where he heard soul artists like McKinley Mitchell and Bobby Day and the bluesman Howlin' Wolf. His first guitar was never recovered from the pawnshop, but he bought another guitar and formed a band, the Hot Tomatoes, which was \\"good enough to enter a talent show at the well-known nightclub on 63rd Street called The Place.\\" Alexander went on to form another band, the Equitable Band, which played at the Launching Pad, at 75th Street and Stony Island, for about eight years. When Alexander was playing at Red's, a Chicago club at 35th Street and Archer, he was approached by an agent who introduced him to the popular North Side blues clubs B.L.U.E.S. and Kingston Mines. His entry into \\"Blue Chicago\\" (downtown) exposed him to tourists to whom he started selling independently recorded CDs, which are still selling well. Alexander has been a fixture in Chicago North Side clubs for nearly two decades and has played with blues notables including Buddy Guy, A.C. Reed, Magic Slim, and B.B. King. He has performed for audiences in New York, Canada, and Europe and has appeared at the Mississippi Blues Festival. Alexander is a regular performer at Kingston Mines. Music and performance style Music critic Jim White called Alexander a \\"still-present, real-deal bluesman\\" with \\"deep, rich, gritty vocals\\" and \\"guitar work as strong as his vocals.\\" Alexander plays his own style of electric blues, influenced by soul, R&B;, and funk. The original material he writes contributes to the survival of the blues genre. His sense of humor shown in his music and his act sets him apart from most other blues players. He is known for playing his guitar \\"with the energy of a 20 year old.\\" Reviewer Greg Szalony wrote that \\"at times [Alexander's] vocal approach is more akin to talking than singing\\" and noted that his \\"distorted guitar tones\\" and vocals as \\"uncannily close to the late Son Seals.\\" The music critic David Whiteis wrote that Alexander's guitar style shows \\"lively improvisational imagination\\" and is in \\"good taste\\" and said Alexander was especially gifted as a songwriter \\"in command of a lyric vividness.\\" Whiteis described Alexander's song \\"Saving Robert Johnson\\" as \\"a full-scale theatrical vignette set to music ...

Since electricity and natural gas are commodities, prices change daily with the market. It is challenging for most businesses without energy managers to obtain price comparisons from a variety of suppliers since prices must be compared on exactly the same day. In addition, the terms of the particular contract offered by the supplier influences the price that is quoted. An energy broker can provide a valuable service if they work with a large number of suppliers and can actually compile the sundry prices from suppliers. An important aspect of this consulting role is to assure that the client understands the differences between the contract offers. Under some State Laws they use the term \\"Suppliers\\" to refer to energy suppliers, brokers, and aggregators, however there are very important differences between them all. Energy brokers do not own or distribute energy, nor are allowed to sell energy directly to you. They simply present the rates of a wholesaler, or supplier. Product and services Energy consultants offer a lot more than procuring energy contracts from a supplier. In the UK and Europe where there is a lot of legislation and increasing pressure for businesses and countries to do more to reduce their energy consumption a lot of services from brokers now help ensure businesses meet a lot of compliance and accreditation requirements such as the ESOS (energy saving opportunity scheme), ISO 50001, ISO 14001, Energy Performance Certificates and Display Energy Certificates. Other services include helping companies reduce energy consumption with the aim of meeting national and international carbon emission standards. Services include, energy health checks, energy audits, carbon zero, carbon offsetting and energy saving consulting. Additional services such as arranging a power purchase agreement, energy export contracts can be procured as well as energy monitoring and reporting technology and solutions are also offered by energy consultants. Who do energy brokers serve? In the USA, energy brokers can serve residential, commercial and government entities that reside in energy deregulated states. In the UK, and some countries in Europe, the entire market is deregulated. Fees/Commission Energy brokers typically do not charge up front fees to provide rates. If an entity purchases energy through a broker, the broker's fee or commission is usually included in the unit rate the customer pays. This is referred to as an uplift. Some brokers will charge a fixed fee for their consulting services. Consulting Not all energy brokers are consultants; However, the energy brokers who are also consultants will perform a more detailed analysis of a consumers' usage pattern in order to provide a custom rate, which typically results in more cost savings for the consumer. Typically, they do not need any more information than that of an energy broker, because they can pull usage information from the local utility company. There are some national energy brokers that use auditing teams to verify their client's invoices.do uri = CELEX: 31998L0011: EN: NOT Directive 98/11 / EC of 27 January 1998 implementing Council Directive 92/75 / EEC with regard to energy labeling of household lamps.

Johanne Tvede Bruhn, her mother, was a painter. After leaving school in 1927, she began decorating the brown, unglazed pottery produced by the factory. In 1930, she studied in the ceramics department of the Arts and Crafts School which had just opened in Copenhagen. In parallel, she furthered her education by working with the ceramist Christian Poulsen (1911‚Äì1991) and with Arne Bang (1901‚Äì1983) at the Holmegaard Glass Factory. Two years later she left the school to become an apprentice at the new workshop run by Axel Salto (1889-1961) and Bode Willumsen (1895‚Äì1987).\\"Gertrud Vasegaard (1913‚Äì2007)\\", Dansk Kvindebiografist Leksikon.

They produced pottery and ceramics, exhibiting in Copenhagen the same year. In 1938, Vasegaard moved to Holkadalen near Gudhjem with her husband Sigurd (whom she had married in 1935) and her daughter Myre. Here she produced earthenware mugs and bowls with an ornamental look which was to form the basis of her later work with stoneware. In 1945, on the initiative of Aksel Rode and as a result of the difficulty of obtaining supplies after the war, she began working for Bing & Gr√∏ndahl during the winter, returning to her Bornholm workshop for the rest of the year. In 1949, she became a full-time employee of the factory where she remained for the next 10 years, specializing in stoneware. It soon became one of the firm's most successful products, opening up a new era for Danish design. Her preferred finishes were light green, clear off-white, light blue and jade. Of particular note is her tea set (1956) with a hexagonal teapot and cups without handles, perfectly adapted to industrial production. Her three porcelain dinner sets (1961‚Äì1975) which she designed for Royal Copenhagen were also successful. The Capella set was undecorated, Gemina had a blue decoration without glaze while Gemma had a stamped decoration.\\"Gertrud Vasegaard\\", Dansk Bibliografisk Leksikon. Retrieved 25 January 2013.

A mumpsimus () is a \\"traditional custom obstinately adhered to however unreasonable it may be\\", or \\"someone who obstinately clings to an error, bad habit or prejudice, even after the foible has been exposed and the person humiliated; also, any error, bad habit, or prejudice clung to in this fashion\\". Thus it may describe behaviour or the person who behaves thus. For example, all intensive purposes is a common eggcorn of the fixed expression all intents and purposes; if a person continues to say the eggcorn even after being made aware of the correct form, either the speaker or the phrase may be called a mumpsimus. Origin The term originates from an apocryphal story about a poorly educated Catholic priest saying Latin mass who, in reciting the postcommunion prayer (meaning: \\"What we have received in the mouth, Lord\\"), instead of (meaning: \\"we have received\\") substitutes the non-word mumpsimus, presumably as a mondegreen. After being made aware of his mistake, he nevertheless persisted with his erroneous version, whether from stubbornness, force of habit, or refusing to believe he was mistaken. The story was told by Desiderius Erasmus (1466‚Äì1536) in a letter he wrote in August 1516 to Henry Bullock. Erasmus used it as an analogy with those who refused to accept that Novum Instrumentum omne, his edition of the Greek New Testament, corrected errors in the Latin Vulgate. The English diplomat Richard Pace (1482‚Äì1536) included a variant in his 1517 work De Fructu qui ex Doctrina Percipitur, where the priest was English and had been saying mumpsimus for thirty years when corrected. While Pace's book (written in Latin) is credited by the first edition of the Oxford English Dictionary as the origin of \\"mumpsimus\\", Pace acknowledged his borrowing in a 1517 letter to Erasmus. \\"Mumpsimus and sumpsimus\\" became proverbial among Protestants in the early English Reformation. Usage William Tyndale may have been the first to use the word in an English-language book. Mumpsimus soon entered the language as a cant word widely used by 16th-century writers. In William Tyndale's 1530 book Practice of Prelates, the word was used in the sense of a stubborn opponent to Tyndale's views. He said that the men whom Cardinal Wolsey had asked to find reasons why Catherine of Aragon was not truly the wife of King Henry VIII of England were \\"all lawyers, and other doctors, mumpsimuses of divinity\\". In 1531 Sir Thomas Elyot used the word in his Boke named the Gouvernor where he said of Magnanimitie that the word, \\"being yet straunge, as late borowed out of the Latyne, shall not content all men, and specially them whome nothing contenteth out of their accustomed mumpsimus\\". Henry VIII in his speech at the State Opening of Parliament on Christmas Eve 1545 said: Peter Heylin refers to the king's saying in his 1631 The History of St. George of Cappadocia when he talks of \\"those self-conceited ones which are so stiffeas King Harry used to sayin their new sumpsimus...\\" Hugh Latimer (1487‚Äì1555) used the term in two sermons he preached in 1552, saying: \\"When my neighbour is taught, and knoweth the truth, and will not believe it, but will abide in his old mumpsimus...\\" and again: \\"Some be so obstinate in their old mumpsimus, that they cannot abide the true doctrine of God.\\" In an 1883 polemic on errors in translations of the Christian Bible, John Burgon says: \\"If men prefer their 'mumpsimus' to our 'sumpsimus', let them by all means have it: but pray let them keep their rubbish to themselvesand at least leave our SAVIOUR's words alone.\\" Eugene T. Maleska, 1970s editor of The New York Times crossword puzzle, received \\"dozens of letters\\" after \\"mumpsimus\\" appeared as an answer; he had felt that \\"it was time to revive the obsolete noun\\". A. Leslie Derbyshire applied it in a 1981 management science book to managers who know how to do a better job but choose not to. Garner's Modern English Usage says the word could describe George W. Bush because of his persistent habit of pronouncing \\"nuclear\\" as \\"nucular\\", despite the error being widely reported.

However, Kassila's next two films, Kuriton sukupolvi (1957) and Syntipukki (1957) ‚Äì both remakes of the 1930s Finnish films ‚Äì did well at the box office.  1960‚Äì1982  Since the beginning, Fennada-Filmi had suffered from lack of new ideas and resorted to remakes, while also keeping up the fast production pace. In 1961, two successful films premiered, Ritva Arvelo's Kultainen vasikka and Matti Kassila's Kaasua, komisario Palmu!, which was a sequel to Kassila's Komisario Palmun erehdys (1960). That film had been produced by Suomen Filmiteollisuus, but Mauno M√§kel√§ managed to get the rights to the sequel. Robert Balser, an American animator, established Fennada-Filmi's animation department. The fate of Fennada-Filmi was at stake with the actors' strike in 1963, and a plan was made to sell the company to the Finnish Broadcasting Company. This, however, proved to be a very controversial move, and the deal was cancelled. Throughout the mid-1960s, new films went into production only infrequently. In the fall of 1966, shooting began for a film adaptation of a V√§in√∂ Linna's T√§√§ll√§ Pohjant√§hden alla. Directed by Edvin Laine, the film premiered in the fall of 1968 and was a commercial success. The sequel Akseli and Elina also did well when it was released in 1970. Only five more films were released by Fennada-Filmi, with Laine's Ruskan j√§lkeen (1979) being the final one. In 1982, the Finnish Broadcasting Company bought the company, which marked the end of its run.

Flournoy served as a state senator representing the 12th Senatorial District in the West Virginia Senate (1885‚Äì1890) and served three terms as mayor of Romney, West Virginia. Flournoy unsuccessfully ran as a candidate for the West Virginia Democratic Party gubernatorial nomination in 1900. Flournoy was born in 1846 in Chesterfield County, Virginia. In 1863, during the American Civil War, he enlisted as a private in the Confederate States Army and served until the war's end in 1865. After graduating from Hampden‚ÄìSydney College in 1868, Flournoy taught school for four years while studying law. In 1870 he relocated to Romney, West Virginia, where he served as principal of the Potomac Academy. He was admitted to the bar in 1873, and afterward served on the Board of Regents for the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind (1876‚Äì1880). During his second term in the West Virginia Senate, Flournoy relocated to Charleston to practice law. He also engaged in several business ventures and was an incorporator of the Bank of Romney, the Tug and Guyandotte Railroad Company, the Bradford Building Company, the White Oak Mining Company, and the West Construction Company. Flournoy served on the Board of Trustees of Hampden‚ÄìSydney College from 1892 until his death in 1904. Through his marriage to Frances \\"Fannie\\" Ann Armstrong White, Flournoy was a brother-in-law of West Virginia Attorney General Robert White and West Virginia Fish Commission President Christian Streit White, and the son-in-law of Hampshire County Clerk of Court John Baker White. Through his father, Flournoy was a relative of Thomas Flournoy, United States Representative from Virginia. Flournoy was the father of prominent Charleston lawyer Samuel Lightfoot Flournoy.  Early life and military career  Samuel Lightfoot Flournoy was born on November 25, 1846, in Chesterfield County, Virginia, from Richmond, and was the son of Richard W. Flournoy and his wife, Sarah Parke Poindexter Flournoy. He had four siblings, two brothers and two sisters: Reverend Parke Poindexter Flournoy, Eliza Flournoy Ayler, Richard W. Flournoy, and Ellen Flournoy Thornton. Flournoy was of English and French ancestry. He was a relative of Thomas Flournoy, United States Representative from Virginia. The majority of Flournoy's youth and early adulthood were spent in Richmond, where he attended the city's public schools. In 1863, during the American Civil War, Flournoy enlisted as a private in the Confederate States Army at the age of 17. He served the entirety of his enlistment in Company A, Otey Battery, 13th Battalion, Virginia Light Artillery in Richmond, throughout the course of the war until its end in 1865.  Education and teaching career  Following the war, Flournoy entered Hampden‚ÄìSydney College in Hampden Sydney, Virginia, to pursue an education in classical studies. His elder brother Parke Poindexter Flournoy had been an assistant professor at the college during the war. Flournoy graduated with honors and a Bachelor of Arts from Hampden‚ÄìSydney College in 1868 and received the Speaker's Medal from the institution's Philanthropic Debating Society. While attending Hampden‚ÄìSydney College, he was a member of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity. Following graduation, Flournoy taught school for four years while studying law. Around 1870 he relocated to Romney, West Virginia, where he took charge as principal and taught at the Potomac Academy with \\"considerable success\\" and continued his law studies. Flournoy was admitted to the bar in Romney in January 1873.  Law and political careers  =Romney law practice= Hampshire County Courthouse in Romney Following his admission to the bar, Flournoy immediately began practicing law in Romney and \\"won merited distinction\\" in his field. He became a prominent leader in the community and was elected as a member of the Romney Literary Society. Flournoy served on the fourth Board of Regents of the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind from 1876 to 1880. He served three terms as mayor of Romney. As his law career prospered, Flournoy was active in the establishment of The Society of the Ex-Confederate Soldiers in Hampshire County. The society's missions were to obtain an accurate roster of Confederate veterans and to collect and preserve materials to maintain a \\"truthful\\" history of the American Civil War. Flournoy and a group of Confederate veterans met at the Hampshire County Courthouse in Romney on July 31, 1883, where he was appointed secretary of the society. The society's constitution was presented at its first annual reunion on September 5, 1883, at which time Flournoy was officially titled as the society's corresponding secretary. Alexander W. Monroe was among the society's three concurrently- serving vice presidents. = West Virginia Senate = Flournoy was elected to represent the 12th Senatorial District, consisting of Grant, Hampshire, Hardy, Mineral, and Pendleton counties, in the West Virginia Senate in 1885 and was re-elected to the seat in 1889. In the West Virginia state senatorial election on November 6, 1888, Flournoy defeated his Republican challenger S. G. Pownall with 5,578 votes to Pownall's 4,028 votes. Following his election, Flournoy was selected as part of West Virginia's attending delegation to the inauguration of President Benjamin Harrison. In his first term in the West Virginia Senate, Flournoy served as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and in his second term he served as chairman of the Committee on Counties and Municipal Corporations. Throughout his two terms, Flournoy served on the committees of Privileges and Elections, Federal Relations, Immigration and Agriculture, and Public Printing. In 1890, during his second term in the West Virginia Senate, Flournoy relocated from Romney to Charleston and continued practicing law there. He resigned from his senate seat in 1890. =Charleston law practice= In Charleston, in 1891, Flournoy founded the law firm Couch, Flournoy and Price with former West Virginia Senate President, George Edmund Price. The firm would later become Flournoy, Price, and Smith with the addition of Harrison Brooks Smith in 1894. On March 7, 1892, Flournoy and his partner Price were admitted to practice before the Supreme Court of the United States. Flournoy and Price continued to expand their law practice into Southern West Virginia when they were admitted to the bar of Summers County in 1894. In April 1897, while practicing law in Charleston, Flournoy became qualified to practice law at the bar of Tazewell County, Virginia. As a Charleston lawyer, Flournoy represented both plaintiffs and defendants involved in suits over coalfield land titles in Southern West Virginia and Southwest Virginia. From 1900 to 1901, Flournoy represented the defendant Henry C. King in a widely publicized case involving claim to a land title of spanning counties in Southern West Virginia and Southwest Virginia in the United States Circuit Court of Appeals. In 1901, Flournoy represented S. J. Ritchie of Akron, Ohio, in the Tazewell County Court, where his client claimed a large land tract of valuable coalfields spanning Tazewell County and McDowell County, West Virginia. = Gubernatorial candidacy = In early April 1900, a movement among prominent West Virginia Democratic Party members in Charleston began to coalesce around Flournoy in support of his candidacy for West Virginia governor. Flournoy was considered a William Jennings Bryan Democrat with conservative positions, and Charleston Democrats felt he would receive wide support and would not antagonize corporations. Flournoy took the matter under advisement and on April 25, 1900, he announced his candidacy for West Virginia governor. In his announcement, Flournoy stated that he was unwilling to engage in a heated contest for the nomination and that he would be content with the outcome of the Democratic Party state convention, no matter the decision. He further stated that he trusted the state convention would craft a ticket that would command the support of the people of West Virginia. Following his announcement, the Spirit of Jefferson newspaper in Charles Town stated of Flournoy on May 1, 1900: \\"Mr. Flournoy is a most estimable gentleman, well and favorably known here, would doubtless make an excellent governor, and as the nominee of the Democratic party would receive a hearty support in the Eastern panhandle.\\" Flournoy also received the support of the Democratic Party in Mineral County in May 1900. At the West Virginia Democratic Party State Convention held in Parkersburg on June 6, 1900, Flournoy competed for the party's nomination for gubernatorial candidacy against Lewis N. Tavenner of Parkersburg, John H. Holt of Huntington, and Virgil G. Lewis of Mason City. Prior to the convention, Daniel B. Lucas of Jefferson County had been a candidate for nomination. Holt won the Democratic Party's nomination on the first ballot, but lost in the general election to Republican candidate Albert B. White. Flournoy and Lewis each received just one vote while Holt received 483 and Tavenner received 450 votes. = West Virginia Bar Association = Flournoy was present at the first meeting of the West Virginia Bar Association held on the date of its organization on July 8, 1886, in Grafton. As a member, Flournoy was appointed to draft the association's constitution and by-laws and served on its executive committee. In addition to serving as a vice president of the association, Flournoy also represented the 12th Judicial Circuit on the association's Committee on Judicial Administration and Legal Reform and later served on the Committee of Admissions. On January 7, 1892, Flournoy was elected as the association's vice president for West Virginia's 3rd congressional district.  Business pursuits  In addition to his law practice and political pursuits, Flournoy also engaged in several business ventures. On August 4, 1888, he purchased five shares priced at $100 each in order to invest in and provide capital stock for the incorporation of the Bank of Romney. Along with Harrison B. Smith and fellow state senator George E. Price, Flournoy again served as an incorporator on April 25, 1901, when the Tug and Guyandotte Railroad Company was granted its charter with $100,000 in capital. The Tug and Guyandotte Railroad was constructed between the Norfolk and Western Railway at Davy and Baileysville to facilitate the transportation of coal. Flournoy, Price, and Flournoy's son Richard Parke Flournoy were incorporators of the Bradford Building Company which was chartered with capital of $20,000 on September 25, 1901, with the purpose of engaging in general building and construction projects. The following year, on December 20, 1902, Flournoy, Price, and their law partner Smith were also incorporators of the White Oak Mining Company and of the West Construction Company. With an authorized capital stock of $100,000, the White Oak Mining Company, that was engaged in the mining, shipment, and sale of coal, the cutting and sawing of timber, and the operations and sales of railway, telephone, and telegraph lines and networks. The West Construction Company, based in Chattanooga, Tennessee, was a general contracting and construction firm also involved in the operation and maintenance of railway, telephone, and telegraph lines. Personal life =Marriage and children= On April 10, 1875, in Hampshire County, Flournoy married Frances \\"Fannie\\" Ann Armstrong White (April 10, 1844 ‚Äì February 25, 1922), the daughter of Hampshire County Clerk of Court John Baker White and his wife Frances Ann Streit White. Frances White's brother, Robert White, served as West Virginia Attorney General, and her brother Christian Streit White served as President of the West Virginia Fish Commission. Flournoy and his wife Frances had six children (five sons and one daughter): * Richard Parke Flournoy (December 29, 1875 ‚Äì May 5, 1959) * Harry Lightfoot Flournoy (March 4, 1878 ‚Äì December 31, 1954) * Frances T. Flournoy Preston, married James M. Preston of Lewisburg, West Virginia * Robert Baker Flournoy (October 10, 1882 ‚Äì July 25, 1883) * Samuel Lightfoot Flournoy (January 7, 1886 ‚Äì May 17, 1961), married Sarah Katharine Cotton * Alexander White Flournoy (March 15, 1887 ‚Äì March 16, 1958), married Anne Cary Gravatt = Religious activities = Flournoy was active in the Presbyterian Church in Hampshire County and served as a trustee for the Presbytery of Winchester, along with Henry Bell Gilkeson. In 1881, Flournoy and his fellow trustees were instrumental in securing from Amos L. and Allie G. Pugh a house and a large partially wooded lot in Capon Bridge for use by the Presbytery as a centrally located manse in Hampshire County. Flournoy was elected as a deacon in the Presbyterian Church in 1879 and remained a trustee of the Presbytery of Winchester until 1891 when he relocated to Charleston. Following his move to Charleston, Flournoy became a member of the First Presbyterian Church and served as one of seven church elders there. =Later life and death= Flounoy died as a result of throat and pulmonary illnesses on January 28, 1904, at 2:40 a.m. in Orlando, Florida, where he had traveled to restore his failing health. His wife and his physician Dr. Henry were at his side at the time of his death. Flournoy was survived by his wife, and five of his children. Flournoy was interred at Spring Hill Cemetery in Charleston. He served on the Board of Trustees of Hampden‚ÄìSydney College from 1892 until his death. A tribute to Flournoy was rendered by college president Richard McIlwaine at a meeting of the Hampden‚ÄìSydney College trustees on June 13, 1904. Following his death, The Weekly Register newspaper in Point Pleasant remarked that Flournoy \\"was one of the prominent [Democratic] leaders of the state, and occupied a high place in the estimation [of] the party followers\\". The Times-Dispatch of Richmond stated that Flournoy \\"was one of the best known members of the bar\\" of Charleston and described his service during the American Civil War as gallant.

It is one of only two native breeding land-birds on Nauru and it is the only passerine found on the island. It is related to other Micronesian reed warblers, all of which evolved from one of several radiations of the genus across the Pacific. Related warblers on nearby islands include the Carolinian reed warbler, with which the Nauru species was initially confused, and the nightingale reed warbler, which was formerly sometimes considered the same species. A medium-sized warbler, the Nauru reed warbler has dark brown upperparts, cream underparts and a long, thin beak. It makes a low, cup-shaped nest into which it lays two or three white eggs, and it feeds on insects. However, details about its behavior and ecology are little known. It is found throughout Nauru, which has changed substantially in recent decades due to phosphate mining. The Nauru reed warbler is potentially threatened by introduced predators and habitat loss, and its small range means that it could be vulnerable to chance occurrences, such as tropical cyclones. Reports of a similar warbler from nearby islands suggest that it might previously have been found elsewhere, but was driven to local extinction by introduced cats. Taxonomy and systematics Otto Finsch was the first naturalist to visit the island of Nauru, stopping for six hours on 24 July 1880 while travelling from the Marshall Islands to the Solomon Islands. His 1881 report included a warbler he initially identified as the Carolinian reed warbler. By 1883 he considered it to be a new species, Calamoherpe rehsei.Buden 2008a, p. 8. The generic name Calamoherpe is now recognised as a synonym of Acrocephalus,Jobling 2010, p. 84. leading to the current binomial name. The generic name Acrocephalus derives from the Greek akros, meaning \\"topmost\\", and kephale, meaning \\"head\\". The akros part of the name may have been given through confusion with acutus, and taken to mean \\"sharp-pointed\\", referring to the angular head shape typical of this genus.Jobling 2010, pp. 30-31. The synonym Calamoherpe is from the Greek kalamos, meaning \\"reed\\", and herpes, meaning \\"creeping thing\\". Finsch named the species after Ernst Rehse, a German ornithologist and collector and one of Finsch's travelling companions.Finsch 1883, p. 142.Jobling 2010, p. 332. Since the original descriptions, little has been written about the species,Buden 2008a, p. 16. and details about its ecology and behaviour are poorly known. Though the Nauru reed warbler is generally accepted as a species, some authorities, such as H. E. Wolters in Die Vogelarte der Erde (1980) and Howard and Moore in A Complete Checklist of the Birds of the World (1991), have considered it a subspecies of Acrocephalus luscinius, the nightingale reed warbler. Recent DNA studies have affirmed its status as a separate species. It is considered monotypic, meaning there are no recognised subspecies. The species is known by the English common names Finsch's reed-warbler, Nauru warbler, pleasant warbler, the Nauru reed-warbler, and the Nauru reed warbler. In the native Nauruan language, it is known as Itsirir. A 2009 phylogenic study of the family Acrocephalidae did not include this species, and as recently as 2010 its relation with other members of the genus was unknown. A 2011 analysis of mitochondrial DNA showed that the Nauru reed warbler forms a clade with the Australian reed warbler, the bokikokiko, the southern Marquesan reed warbler and a now-extinct species from Pagan Island in the Marianas. The closest relative of the Nauru reed warbler appears to be the extinct warbler from Pagan. This is currently named as a subspecies of the nightingale reed warbler, A. luscinius yamashinae, but that species is polyphyletic, and the Pagan form, which has been proposed as a new species, the Pagan reed warbler, is in a different clade to nightingale reed warblers from other islands. The pattern of colonisation of the Pacific islands and eventually Australia by the Acrocephalus warblers from Asia was complex, with multiple colonisations of even remote archipelagos. Although the Hawaiian islands were colonised about 2.3 million years ago, the other islands were reached much more recently, in the mid-Pleistocene (between 0.2-1.4 million years ago) or even later. The nearest other warblers geographically to Nauru are the Carolinian reed warbler and the nightingale reed warbler.Spenneman 2006, p. 258. Description The Nauru reed warbler is a medium-sized and warmly coloured reed warbler, with a relatively light build. The entirety of the upperparts are dark brown, with the rump and uppertail coverts slightly brighter than the tail and mantle. When closed, the wing is the same colour as the mantle, short and rounded. The wing does not reach the start of the tail feathers, which enhances the appearance of a long tail. Close inspection of the wing reveals darker centres to both the greater coverts and tertial feathers. Its face shows little contrast, as the ear coverts, crown, nape, chin and throat are all a similar shade of pale brown. The lores are a dark brown, and there is a pale, creamy supercilium, or \\"eyebrow\\", extending from the beak to the ear coverts, which are a cinnamon-brown, darkening and merging with the nape. The beak is long, thin and straight. The underparts are much lighter, darkening towards the vent and undertail coverts. The chin is a dull cream, merging with the throat, which then browns towards the base. The centre of the breast is a dull brown- yellow, while the sides are a reddish brown. The upper mandible of the beak is dark grey with pink edges, while the lower mandible is pink, darkening towards to the tip. The legs and feet are dark grey. The bird measures up to , with a wingspan of . The species exhibits no sexual dimorphism, and characteristics of the young are unknown. As the only passerine on the island, there is no chance that this species may be confused with any other. The Nauru reed warbler is slightly smaller than the Carolinian reed warbler, which is also lighter in colour, with a more contrasting eyebrow. The nightingale reed warbler is substantially larger, and the Oriental reed warbler has a duller colouration, with whiter underparts.Finsch 1883, p. 143. Distribution and habitat Scrubland remaining after phosphate mining, an environment in which the Nauru reed warbler thrives The Nauru reed warbler is endemic to the island of Nauru, in the Pacific Ocean. It is one of only two indigenous land birds which breed on the island, the other being the Micronesian pigeon. The warbler can be found throughout the island, thriving in the scrubland in areas previously used for phosphate mining, as well as the remaining patches of forest on the island's central plateau. It is most common in the remains of forest found on the island's steep slopes. It is also readily observed in gardens and ruderal areas on the island's coast; in 1881, Finsch described the species as abundant, calling it \\"as common as the House-Sparrow in England.\\" Biologist Donald Buden again found it widespread on the island in 2008. The species is sedentary, meaning that the birds do not naturally leave Nauru. Banaba is the nearest island, and despite being similar to Nauru, it lacks any warblers. However, it is possible that populations of the Nauru reed warbler existed on other islands until comparatively recently. On the Marshall Islands, traditional stories refer to a small bird, known variously as anna√±, anang and ann√£ng. This bird was considered the property of chieftains. Though no physical descriptions exist of the species, it has been described as butterfly-sized, pleasant-smelling and as living among rocks on the shores of north-western islands.Spenneman 2006, p. 257. Ethnographers Kr√§mer and Nevermann reported that the bird became extinct or extirpated around 1880. Based on descriptions of birds seen on Jaluit, Paul Schnee hypothesised that the anna√± may have been a Nauru reed warbler. The extinction of the anna√± may have been due to hunting by cats,Spenneman 2006, p. 259. which were introduced to the Marshall Islands by the Russian Otto von Kotzebue in 1817 to hunt rats. They then multiplied before being spread by locals as pets, after which they started to become feral.Spenneman 2006, p. 260. Behaviour and ecology Nauru reed warbler nests are cup-shaped and woven from grasses and twigs. They sometimes include Cassytha filiformis vine or Casuarina equisetifolia needles. The nests are bound to upright stems in a way typical of warblers. Buden reported that the warblers nest in trees and shrubs at a height of . The species may also nest on the ground; the young in ground nests may be more vulnerable to predation by rats. Eggs have variously been reported in December and July, and ornithologist A. Pearson suggested that the species may nest all year round. The clutch size has been reported as two or three eggs. Incubation and fledgling periods are unknown. Pearson reported lower nesting than Buden, recording nests in bushes and undergrowth between from the ground, especially in forked branches of hibiscus and lime. Buden reported that the birds were more vocal in December than in March and April. The song has been described as similar to that of a song thrush, common blackbird, or willie wagtail, and it is delivered both day and night. Finsch described the warbler as insectivorous, feeding primarily on dragonflies. Six species of dragonfly have been observed on the island; Ischnura aurora, Anax guttatus, Diplacodes bipunctata, Pantala flavescens, Tholymis tillarga and Tramea transmarina. Buden did not observe the species feeding on dragonflies, but did see three different feeding habits. Most frequently, the birds were seen moving through trees and shrubs, catching prey on the foliage. Other birds were seen perched close to the floor, darting to the ground, and returning to the perch with prey. In open areas, the birds were observed moving across the ground, \\"occasionally grasping a presumed prey item\\". In coastal areas, they have been observed feeding in coconut trees. Potential predators for the birdlife of Nauru in general include feral cats and dogs, as well as the Polynesian rat and the Tanezumi rat.Buden 2008a, p. 9. Feral cats and wild rats in particular are potential threats to the Nauru reed warbler.  Status  The IUCN lists the species as \\"Vulnerable\\", because \\"its very small range leaves it susceptible to chance events, such as cyclones and the introduction of alien predators.\\" BirdLife International previously estimated that there were between 10,000 and 20,000 Nauru reed warblers, based on 1993 data, but Buden's 2006 estimate was 5,000 birds of all ages led to a revised figure of 3,000 mature individuals. In 2001, it was observed that the removal of the phosphate deposits on the island meant that the vegetation was decreasing, presenting a potential threat to the species.Hildyard 2001, pp. 1620‚Äì1621. In 2008, however, Buden claimed that \\"habitat degradation and loss of native forest via mining operations has apparently had no major adverse effects on the population.\\" Nauru reed warblers were observed to be common on the island, and flourishing in the scrubland left by mining. Unlike other birds on the island, the species is not hunted, and is protected under Schedule 1 of Nauru's Wild Birds Preservation Ordinance 1937.Buden 2008a, pp. 16‚Äì17. For conservation purposes, the IUCN recommends regular surveys of the population and the establishment of a monitoring programme through training local people. It also proposed raising conservation awareness by increasing the profile of the bird.

The story arc consists of six issues from DC's Justice League and Aquaman publications, functioning in part as a larger buildup towards the \\"Trinity War\\" event. The plot was written by Geoff Johns, with art by Ivan Reis and Paul Pelletier. In the story, believing Atlantis to be under attack, King Orm declares war on the surface world. Aquaman's allegiances are torn between his brother and the Justice League, while the latter group finds itself overwhelmed as the East Coast of the United States is swallowed by the ocean and the Atlantean royal troops march against humankind. The storyline was loosely adapted into a 2015 animated film, Justice League: Throne of Atlantis. Summary A Navy warship incites the wrath of the Atlanteans after its missiles malfunction during a test and end up attacking Atlantis. Ocean Master, the new king of Atlantis, declares war on the surface world. While they are in a caf√© in Metropolis, Superman and Wonder Woman are forced to suit up and stop an aircraft carrier from flooding into the city and killing thousands of people. In the battle that follows the Justice League is captured, save Cyborg. He realizes they need help and calls in help from Green Arrow, Hawkman, Zatanna, Firestorm and more. The Heroes stop Ocean Master and figure out that Aquaman's assistant Nuidis Vulko was behind the bombing so Arthur would take the throne once again.

He was appointed by the archive's founding curator, Ernest Lindgren, upon its creation in 1935, and remained in the post until his retirement in 1984. Biography Born in Walthamstow, the son of a maker of nautical instruments, Brown joined the British Film Institute (BFI) as an office assistant aged 15 in 1935, two years after it was established. Formally appointed as the BFI's first film preservation officer in 1951, he was a largely self-taught archivist. In his role at the BFI, Brown made a major contribution to the science of film preservation. He was possibly the first archivist to research systematically the decomposition process of nitrate film, and consequently to show that it can be inhibited by storage in a cool and dry atmosphere. Brown is credited with having invented the term vinegar syndrome to describe the deacetylation of cellulose acetate film (safety film). He designed and built specialist step-printers to enable the preservation copying of shrunken and otherwise damaged originals. He was an active member of FIAF's Technical Commission, in which capacity he wrote and contributed to technical manuals that film archivists still consider standard reference works. Retiring in 1984, he was the longest serving employee of the BFI. In retirement, Brown was a prominent volunteer with the Projected Picture Trust, restoring and operating historical projectors at a museum in Bletchley Park.

If no free version exists and the user purchases the document from PACER, it will automatically upload a copy to the RECAP server, thereby building the database. The original RECAP implementation uploaded documents to the Internet Archive; as of late 2017, the Free Law Project version now uploads documents to the Free Law Project, with a promise to mirror that data to the Internet Archive on a quarterly basis. PACER continued charging per page fees after the introduction of RECAP. Prior to the creation of RECAP, activist Aaron Swartz set up an automatic download from an official library entry point to PACER. Swartz downloaded 2.7 million documents, all public domain, representing less than 1 percent of the documents in PACER. These public domain documents were later uploaded to RECAP and made available to the public for free. However, the automated downloading triggered a government investigation. No criminal charges were filed, because PACER had provided lawful access and the documents copied were in the public domain, and the case was closed.

Mullen was recruited by West Virginia and Minnesota for football, and chose West Virginia because he stated, \\"it wasn't too far from home and the program was rebuilding.\\" College career Mullen attended West Virginia University after high school, where was a member of the Mountaineers football team from 1981 to 1984. After his freshman season, Mullen considered a transfer, but decided to stick it out after speaking with Risha. Mullen spent two years as a reserve wide receiver for the Mountaineers, but he continued to work hard to earn more playing time. Mullen earned playing time in 11 games during the 1983 season, amassing 19 receptions for 343 yards and three touchdowns. Mullen was also utilized as a kickoff returner, returning 12 kicks for 237 yards. Mullen's senior year at West Virginia was his most productive statistically, as he caught 31 passes for 557 yards and three touchdowns. In total, Mullen amassed 80 receptions for 1,332 yards and six touchdowns during his collegiate career. Gary was also part of three Mountaineer bowl game victories: the Peach Bowl in 1981, the Hall of Fame Classic Bowl in 1983, and the Bluebonnet Bowl in 1984. Professional career After not hearing his name called during the 1985 NFL Draft, Mullen was signed by the Detroit Lions, but was released before the season began. In the summer of 1986, Mullen signed with the Pittsburgh Steelers, but he was unable to shake a bad case of the flu; Mullen left the Steelers by his own will. Mullen made one final attempt to continue his football career, when he attended a tryout for the upstart Arena Football League. Going into the tryout, Mullen wanted to join the Pittsburgh Gladiators, as they were close to where he grew up. =Denver Dynamite= Just one day before Mullen was ready to quit on his football dream and join the U.S. Army, he received a phone call inviting him to try out to play for the Denver Dynamite of the Arena Football League. Mullen became a focal point for the Dynamite offense, but with the Arena Football League then making players play both ways, he was also a key player on defense. Mullen didn't take the lack of a defensive background as an excuse to not play hard on defense. Mullen had an outstanding season for the Dynamite, leading the team in receptions (26), receiving yards (502) and receiving touchdowns (11). The Dynamite tied for the best record in the AFL, which earned them a spot in ArenaBowl I. Mullen won ArenaBowl I MVP during his team's 45‚Äì16 victory over the Pittsburgh Gladiators. =Chicago Bears= Mullen's play during the 1987 season earned him a chance to play for the Chicago Bears during the 1987 NFL strike. He played in all three games that the strike lasted, making two career receptions for 33 yards. =Los Angeles Cobras= After the Dynamite suspended operations during the 1988 season, Mullen went to play for the expansion Los Angeles Cobras as they owned the rights to all Dynamite players. Mullen's one year of experience was heavily leaned on by the Cobras, and Mullen enjoyed being the main target for the Cobras. Mullen lead the Cobras with 61 receptions for 823-yards and 17 touchdowns. The Cobras finished in 4th place, which was good enough to earn them the 4th seed in the playoffs. They were matched against the 1 seed, Chicago Bruisers, with a chance to make it to ArenaBowl II. The Cobras lost 16‚Äì29, while Mullen paced the offense with 7 receptions for 78-yards and 1 touchdown. After the season ended, the Cobras, as well as other teams, folded and the league playing again in 1989 looked in doubt. When they league announced that they would be playing in May, Mullen said that he would not play in 1989 due to all the pay cuts he would be receiving. =Detroit Drive= After sitting out the 1989 regular season to get himself more established at his full-time job, Mullen signed with the Detroit Drive during their playoff run. The Drive won ArenaBowl III. Mullen returned to the Drive in 1991, and teamed with fellow WR/DB George LaFrance and QB Art Schlichter, the Drive's offense stood as one of the most challenging to defend. He helped the Drive to a three-peat with a 37-yard touchdown reception, when the Drive defeated the Dallas Texans 51-27 in ArenaBowl IV. In 1992, the Drive were again on their way to the ArenaBowl, this time they faced the Orlando Predators. =Cincinnati Rockers= Mullen was acquired by the Cincinnati Rockers for future considerations in 1993. =Milwaukee Mustangs= When the Milwaukee Mustangs were formed in 1994, Mullen was selected in their expansion draft. Mullen signed a contract with the Mustangs a few days later. Personal Both of Gary's brothers played professional football. His younger brother Keith Mullen, played arena football in 1991 with the Columbus Thunderbolts, while his older brother Davlin Mullen played for the New York Jets.

Provident Insurance Company, 373 F.3d 998 (9th Cir. 2004), (UnumProvident, now referred to as Unum or Unum GroupUnum News Release, \\"UnumProvident Corp. Now Unum Group\\" (March 2, 2007)), is a landmark decision by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on the issue of disability bad faith insurance law. Because California‚Äôs bad faith insurance law is often referred to in many states as a model nationwide, the 9th Circuit‚Äôs decision has a persuasive impact throughout the country.The Rutter Group, \\"Insurance Litigation\\", \\"Federal Ninth Circuit Civil Appellate Practice\\", \\"Federal Civil Trials and Evidence\\" History After almost ten years as a successful chiropractor, Joan Hangarter purchased an individual disability insurance policy from the Paul Revere Life Insurance Company. The agent explained that even if she could still do paperwork or other work, if Mrs. Hangarter could not work as a chiropractor, the policy would cover her. The policy also provided that after she had been disabled for 90 days, future premiums would be waived while she remained disabled. Several years after purchasing the policy, Mrs. Hangarter suffered from a shoulder injury and cervical disc disease. Mrs. Hangarter's doctors concluded she was totally disabled, however, Paul Revere disputed the results. After Paul Revere terminated Mrs. Hangarter's benefits, the company attached her bank account for the insurance premiums, until the account was drained, at which point the company cancelled her policy. Mrs. Hangarter subsequently brought a diversity action against Paul Revere, alleging violation of ¬ß 17200 of the Unfair Competition Act, breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and intentional misrepresentation. Magistrate Judge James Larson presided over the oral arguments by Plaintiff's attorneys Ray Bourhis, Alice Wolfson, David Lilienstein, and Daniel Smith, and Defendants' attorneys Horace Greene and Evan Tager. After eleven days of trial, a jury of six returned a unanimous verdict for Hangarter that awarded over $7.5 million, with $5 million of the verdict made up of a punitive damages award. Holding Affirming in part and reversing in part the district court's opinion in Hangarter v. Paul Revere Life Insurance Company, the 9th Circuit ruled the defendant insurance company, UnumProvident, engaged in biased and bad faith claims handling and investigation. This case marked a milestone victory for disabled claimants who were rejected because disability insurers were basing their decisions on an improper definition of total disability. The 9th Circuit made it clear that California law controls the definition of this crucial phrase in disability policies. Hangarter v. Provident is also a landmark decision in the area of admissibility of expert testimony, under the Daubert factors laid out by the Supreme Court. With experts on insurance claims practices, the Daubert factors will not preclude the kind of testimony whose reliability depends on the knowledge and experience of the expert, rather than the theory or technical framework behind it. Hangarter gave several important findings of law that aid disabled claimants. First, futile attempts to return to an occupation are insufficient to reverse a jury‚Äôs determination of total disability under California law. Total disability may still be found, even if an insured was able to do some work under her occupation. The guiding focus is whether an insured was unable to perform the substantial and material duties of her own occupation in the usual and customary way with reasonable continuity. Second, the 9th Circuit affirmed that recovery under total disability is not precluded because an insured was able to generate income during her disability. Disability insurance is designed not as insurance against loss of income, but as a substitute for earnings when an insured is deprived of the capacity to earn an income. Third, repeated use of a medical examiner overcomes any presumption that an insurance company‚Äôs denial of a claim is a genuine dispute.

Biography  Richard Sahla grew up in his hometown Graz, where he quickly acquired a reputation as child prodigy. He excelled on the violin and the piano. Aged 13 he started studying the violin as a pupil of Ferdinand David at the Conservatory in Leipzig, University of Music and Theatre Leipzig, today the Hochschule f√ºr Musik und Theater \\"Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy\\" Leipzig. He finished as one of the most outstanding students of this world-famous institution. He played his debut concert aged eighteen at the Gewandhaus in Leipzig to rapturous applause for his \\"technically mature and musically exhilarating play\\". His friend Wilhelm Kienzl describes Sahla's next steps in his autobiography. Both had studied composition under Wilhelm Mayer (also known as W. A. R√©my), whose students included the composers Ferruccio Busoni, Josef Gauby, Richard Heuberger, Emil von Reznicek and Felix Weingartner. Having received his diploma at the Conservatory in Leipzig, the Mecca of violinists, the eighteen-year-old Sahla embarked on an impressive career as violin virtuoso. He quickly gained a reputation as one of the most talented violinists. \\"He elicits his Stradivari celestial sounds. Golden purity engages with the sweet scent of poetry!\\" That was how one critic expressed his enthusiasm in 1880 after a concert at the Vienna Royal Opera (Wiener Hofoper). On 1. October 1875, aged twenty years, Sahla joined the court orchestra (Hofkapelle) of Schaumburg-Lippe as a first solo-violinist for eight months. After which he accepted the post of prime-concertmaster (Konzertmeister) in Gothenburg, Sweden. From 1878 to 1880 he was a member of the Orchestra of the Vienna Royal Opera where he was a celebrated soloist. The Viennese press praised him as an equal of the Spanish violinist Pablo de Sarasate. Sahla's compositions for violin and piano: Spanischer Tanz, Nocturno Nr. 1 (B flat major) and Nocturno Nr. 2 (E major) are dedicated in reverence to Pablo de Sarasate. During the autumn of 1881 Sahla, Wilhelm Kienzl and the coloratura soprano Aglaja Orgeni engaged on a 66 concerts tour through Hungary, Croatia, Central and Northern Germany. This turned out to be rather more exciting than foreseen when the impresario ran off with the takings. During this tour Sahla wrote his Rum√§nische Rhapsodie, which he dedicated to his friend Princess Amalie H√ºgel-Teck, daughter of the Duke of W√ºrtemberg and niece of Queen Victoria. From 1882 to early 1888 Richard Sahla was First Concertmaster and first solo-violinist at the Royal Opera in Hanover, where he struck up many friendships. Amongst these were the Liszt pupil Ingeborg von Bronsart, an internationally acclaimed pianist and composer as well as her husband Hans Bronsart von Schellendorff, director of the Royal Theatre in Hanover between 1867 and 1887. Sahla published a Ballad for violin and piano dedicated to Ingeborg von Bonsart. On 1. April 1888 he started in his position as Music Director and chief-conductor (Hofkapellmeister) at the court in B√ºckeburg. He increased the court's orchestra and gave a series of concerts in Hanover, Bremen, Hamburg and Berlin. The 40-strong ensemble became well-known beyond the principality of Schaumburg-Lippe. The composer, pianist and organist Max Reger for instance came to B√ºckeburg in 1911 as soloist with Sahla conducting. But Sahla too, continued his career as soloist with great success. His repertoire included Paganini‚Äôs Violin Concerto No. 1 and Beethoven‚Äôs Violin Concerto. As conductor he concentrated his attention largely on composers which were not yet widely appreciated. Among them Berlioz, Brahms, Bruckner, Debussy, Mahler, Sibelius as well as Richard Strauss and Richard Wagner. As guest conductor he often worked with the Berlin Philharmonics. In Berlin he conducted the world premiers of all of Henri Marteau‚Äôs violin concertos. Marteau like Reger was a close friend. The Hungarian conductor Arthur Nikisch said about Sahla: \\"He is a supremely gifted and exquisite artist\\". After World War I Sahla faced difficult times. For a while he earned his living as violinist in coffee houses and variety theatres. He spent some time with his wife in the United States. Anna-Ruth Sahla, singer at the court of Schaumburg- Lippe, was born in America. Richard Sahla's last public performance in B√ºckeburg was in 1925 at a concert in honour of his 70. birthday. Original scores of his compositions are kept at the state archive (Staatsarchiv) in B√ºckeburg. The violinist David-F. Tebbe came across a number of published compositions by Sahla whilst researching for his bachelor's thesis: Richard Sahla ‚Äì violin virtuoso, maestro and forgotten composer ‚Äì submitted to Prof. Dr.:de:Thomas Schipperges at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik und Darstellende Kunst Mannheim (Mannheim University of Music and Performing Arts). During Tebbe's research Sahla's grandson, the journalist, television presenter and author Peter Sahla, provided David Tebbe with a large number of unpublished compositions from his own archive.

He died while diving to the wreck of the Belgioso in Dublin Bay using a diving bell of his own design. Early life Charles Spalding was born in Canongate in Scotland on 29 October 1738, the son of Charles Spalding and Ann Findlay. His father was a bookseller in Canongate. As the son of a merchant, the younger Spalding eventually became a shop-lad. Possessing a natural inclination towards mechanics, Spalding spent much of his free time as a youth exploring this interest. Spalding eventually became the proprietor of a sugar refining and confectionery shop across from the Royal Exchange on the Royal Mile in Edinburgh. Improvements to Halley's diving bell Spalding's introduction to diving was more the result of necessity than choice. Heavily invested in the brig Peggy, Spalding suffered a severe financial blow when she sank en route to Scotland at the Farne Islands on 4 December 1774. Elected by his Edinburgh trade guild to recover as many goods as possible, Spalding came up with the idea of diving to the wreck. The prevailing diving bell design in 1775 was that of Dr. Edmond Halley (1656‚Äì1742), who had computed the orbit of the comet named for him. Using his background in mechanics, Spalding read every book he could find on the design of Halley's diving bell, eventually proceeding to trial dives in the port of Leith, Dunbar Bay and at Dundee. Based on these trials, Spalding determined that Halley's design had weaknesses that added unnecessary risk to the divers. To correct the deficiencies, Spalding added a system of balance-weights to ease the raising and lowering of the bell, along with a series of ropes for signalling the surface crew. The redesigned diving bell weighed and could accommodate two divers. Spalding also added ropes inside in the bell as seats and thick glass windows to admit light. Spalding never recovered any of his own cargo from the wreck of the Peggy. However, in 1776 Spalding was recognised by The Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce, London, with a nominal monetary award for his modified diving bell design. With this success, Spalding founded Spalding & Co. of Edinburgh for his diving operations. Spalding was assisted in his diving efforts by his brother Thomas (b. 1740), George Small, who was married to Spalding's sister Ann, and his nephew, Ebenezer Watson.  HMS Royal George Sinking of at Spithead, 1782 On 29 August 1782, the warship capsized while under repairs and sank off Spithead, near the port of Portsmouth. HMS Royal George was the pride of King George III's navy and one of the last British Man-of-war to be primarily outfitted with more expensive bronze guns rather than iron. The ordnance alone was valued at ¬£17,000. One of the first people on the scene with a diving background was Thomas Spalding, Charles' brother. As a surgeon on an East Indiaman, Thomas happened to be in Portsmouth shortly after the sinking occurred. He immediately proposed to the Admiralty that he and his brother should be allowed to recover as much valuable stores and ordnance from the wreck as possible using his brother's diving bell design. The terms of the salvage arrangement were that Spalding would receive one-third of everything he recovered. Thomas Spalding initially completed several reconnaissance dives before Charles arrived at the site on 2 October 1782 to begin diving. Charles worked on the wreck through most of October 1782 until the beginning of November. Spalding's dives were complicated by weather, the inexperience of the crew in working with the bell, and the amount of debris at the dive site. Overall, Spalding raised 15 guns from the wreck, 9 bronze and 6 iron. Spalding's proceeds from his salvage of HMS Royal George were approximately ¬£400. Spalding later learned that the Admiralty had awarded William Tracey of Portsea, Portsmouth the salvage rights to the wreck for the following spring. The Belgioso Charles Spalding Diving Bell, c. 1860 Undeterred, Spalding turned his attention to the wreck of the Belgioso. In March 1783, the Belgioso or Count de Belgioso Imperial East Indiaman was sailing from Liverpool en route to China when it sank in a storm at Kish Bank near Dublin Bay in the Irish Sea. The cargo of the Belgioso was valued at ¬£150,000, with ¬£30,000 in silver and lead. The salvage terms agreed to by the owners were that Spalding would keep one-fourth of all silver and lead recovered and one-half of all other cargo. Additionally, if Spalding failed to recover anything, his entire expense for the operation would be defrayed. Spalding and his nephew, Ebenezer Watson, arrived in Dublin in May 1783 to begin their dive preparations. On 1 June 1783 they began their dives, making three dives to to the wreck. Typical for the start of a new project, the three dives were plagued with issues. On the morning of 2 June 1783, Spalding and Watson resumed diving. Approximately one hour and fifteen minutes had elapsed when the dive crew became concerned. Two to three barrels of air had been sent down with no progress signal from the bell. Since the dive time was longer than usual, the dive crew proceeded to lift the bell. When the bell broke the surface they found both men dead, \\"Mr. Spalding reclining on his breast over one of the ropes that was stretched across for the purpose of sitting upon, and Mr. Watson sitting erect in the upper part of the bell\\". On Sunday morning, 8 June 1783, Charles Spalding and Ebenezer Watson were laid to rest. The Irish press had chronicled Spalding's activity at the Belgioso wreck site, and Spalding had become somewhat of a local celebrity with the Irish citizens. Many influential Dublin citizens attended the funeral. In a tribute to Spalding's memory, the ships in Dublin Bay kept their flags lowered until the interment was completed. The pair were buried in a single grave in St. Mark's Churchyard in Dublin. The exact location of their grave within the churchyard is unknown. An inquest into Spalding's and Watson's deaths was eventually held. The causes reviewed during the hearings varied from the negligence of the dive ship's captain, equipment failure, including tangled signal ropes or the failure of the final cask of air reaching the divers, diver error, putrified air from the rotting cargo of the Belgioso, even sabotage and alcohol. Dive experts today think the most plausible explanation is \\"a highly noxious effluvia entering the bell which could have come from the putrifying bodies or even the rotting cargo of ginseng plants in the cargo hold.\\" This theory is consistent with the observation that they made no apparent attempt to make an emergency ascent. The exact cause of death of Spalding and Watson is unknown. Personal life On 14 August 1768, Spalding married Susan Small, the daughter of James Small, factor of forfeited Struan estates in Perthshire, Scotland. Susan and her father were members of the Smalls of Dirnanean, Perthshire, Scotland. At Spalding's death, he left a wife and seven children under the age of fourteen; the youngest being just six months old. A public subscription fund was opened in London for the relief of the family. Spalding's widow continued to operate the confectionery after his death, eventually selling the business and moving to Musselburgh, where she died on 31 October 1818. Charles Falconer, Baron Falconer of Thoroton is a descendant of Charles Spalding, as is Sheila Legge, the \\"Surrealist Phantom\\" from the 1936 London International Surrealist Exhibition.

He has been described as \\"one of the greatest Corsican poets writing in Italian\\", and \\"one of the most brilliant Corsican intellectuals of the nineteenth century\\".  Early life  Gian Paolo Borghetti was born in Talasani, Corsica on 23 June 1816 into one of the most illustrious families of the Tavagna region whose members, related to Luiggi Giafferi, had particularly distinguished themselves in the reign of King Theodore and at the time of Pasquale Paoli. He studied medicine in Pisa from 1835 to 1839, and upon qualification returned to Corsica. In 1841 he enrolled in the French navy as a ship's surgeon, and in this function travelled the Mediterranean and Atlantic until the beginning of 1848.  Political career  At the announcement of the February Revolution he resigned his post and settled in Bastia, where he entered the political arena. Much influenced by his book Histoire des Girondins, Borghetti was a great admirer of Lamartine. In the first elections held under universal (male) suffrage on 13 and 14 May 1849 he was elected Conseiller G√©n√©ral of his home Canton of Pero-Casevecchie. Not one who was easily willing to compromise his ideals, he quickly became disappointed to see political intrigue and clientelism prevail over the general interest, and allowed himself to be replaced as Conseiller G√©n√©ral by one of his friends, justice of the peace Octavian Renucci, who kept the post until the end of the Second Empire. After the coup d'√©tat of 2 December 1851, he abandoned public life. From 1849 to 1870, Borghetti remained in opposition to the regime. Unlike many others in his position he was not sent into exile, but he was frequently the subject of administrative harassment. When the Second Empire collapsed in 1870, Borghetti once again found favour with the authorities and was appointed (in Ajaccio) Chief of Staff of the new Prefect Dumenicu Francescu Ceccaldi.  Journalism  Having contributed to the journal Progressive de la Corse (Bastia) in 1848, in the following year he founded his own newspaper La Corsica, written in Italian to be better understood by the population. The newspaper openly criticized the foreign policy of Louis Napoleon, which led to its being closed down after only five issues. He later became editor-in-chief of Le Golo (1869), Bulletin Officiel de la Corse (1870-1871), La R√©publique (1871-1872), La Solidarit√© (1879-1885), and Colombo, and founded the journals Le R√©publicain de la Corse (1871), Le D√©mocrate de la Corse (1871), and La Concorde (1880).  Poetry  While his professional and political activities often took precedence over his literary work during his lifetime, Gian Paolo Borghetti is today primarily remembered as one of the greatest Corsican poets writing in Italian. Much of his poetry was inspired by his republican convictions. In 1848 he composed a canto lirico in honour of Lamartine of whom he was a great admirer, and was rewarded with the personal thanks of the head of the provisional government of the Second Republic. In the same year he praised the new Republic in a poem of six verses entitled Alla libert√†, the first stanza of which presents obvious analogies with La Marseillaise, in which he speaks of the bitterly regained freedom that might soon reach the other peoples of Europe, beginning with neighbouring Italy. Another major source of inspiration was il Risorgimento. In 1859 he published A Vittorio Emanuele II, celebrating Victor Emmanuel II, and one of his most importants poems, the 1018 verse Giuseppe Garibaldi (episodio della guerra per l‚Äôindipendenza italiana), first published in 1927, contributed in an original way to the creation of the Garibaldian myth. Not least of his achievements in this area was the composition of a version of Camicia rossa Garibaldina for which he was personally thanked by Garibaldi himself. In May 1869, to commemorate the centenary of the Battle of Ponte Novu (in which his grandfather had fought and been seriously injured) he published, in several installments in the Bastia weekly Phare de la Corse, a vast poetic fresco consisting of fourteen canti entitled Pasquale Paoli.  Other activities  From 1870 to 1871 Borghetti was Departmental Archivist of Corsica and editor- in-chief of the Bulletin Officiel de la Corse, and from 1878 to 1894 he was Director of Public Health in Bastia. He was also co-founder in December 1880, and secretary for the following fifteen years, of La Soci√©t√© des Sciences historiques et naturelles de la Corse.  Political ideas, personal philosophy and character  A convinced republican, Gian Paolo Borghetti was equally inspired by the Christian and humanist traditions. His political ideas are those of Giuseppe Mazzini: God and the People, Humanity and the Republic. In the first installment of La Corsica, the newspaper he founded in 1849, Borghetti offers his readers a long reflection entitled La Repubblica e la religione cristiana where he shows all the affinities between the teachings of Christ and those advocated by the new Republic. Politically, he oscillated between the desire to see the island remain in a France converted to federalism and the wish to see Corsica integrated with a special administration into a hypothetical \\"Federal Republic of Italy\\". Having spent much of his life defending the use of the Italian language and advocating the union of Corsica with Italy, he arose in 1870 as a vehement defender of a French and Republican Corsica against those (Henri Rochefort and Georges Clemenceau, for example) who, after the Battle of Sedan, wanted to cede Corsica to Italy. What was constant in the life of Borghetti, however, was his love of Corsica and no less firm attachment to the idea of democracy as the only form of government compatible with modern political ideas of universality, freedom and justice. His character has been described as being \\"at the same time impulsive and rigid, and often excessive because his polemical thrusts were hard. But he was sincere and disinterested, even if his views were extreme and their expression little disposed to compromise.\\" Enjoying great popularity in the north of Corsica and having many useful political connections in the south, he could have aspired to a career at national level rather than limiting himself to the position of Conseiller G√©n√©ral in the elections of 1849, and having attained that position he could easily have used it for his own advancement, in a society which not only accepted but expected nothing else from those in public office. In both cases, however, he chose the general interest above personal profit.  Personal life and final years  He had three sons and five daughters by his first wife Pauline Hyacinthe Salvatelli, who died in 1862. He married Delphine Louise Ciavaldini in 1878, and had a further three daughters and one son. All his sons and four of his daughters died during his lifetime.Registre d'√©tat civil de BastiaRegistre d'√©tat civil de TalasaniArchives du D√©partement de la Haute- Corse In October 1868 he lost his second son Eugenio, who was barely twenty years old, and this tragic loss inspired his poem In morte di mio figlio Eugenio. In 1894, Borghetti lost the position he had held since 1878 as Director of Public Health in Bastia when David Raynal, Minister of the Interior of the Government of Jean Casimir-Perier (considered by the Radicals and Socialists as the pr√©sident de la r√©action), expressed his astonishment that \\"the Health Service in Bastia had been entrusted to an enemy of France!\\". For Borghetti this was the beginning of a terrible old age spent at the edge of poverty. He died in Bastia on 4 November 1897 in the most profound indifference. Few people attended his funeral, which was held in the small Capannelle chapel in Bastia.  Bibliography  = Poetry =    * = Essays = * \\"Etude sur la Corse\\". L'Aigle Corse (Bastia: Ollagnier).

Blue Plaque to Emily Phipps, Orchard Street, Swansea  Early life and career  The eldest of five siblings, Mary was born to Henry John Phipps, a coppersmith at Devonport Dockyard, and Mary Ann Phipps n√©e Frost, on 7 November 1865 in Stoke Damarel, Devonport. After attending Homerton College, Cambridge, Phipps became head teacher of the infants' school attached to the college. After obtaining a first-class degree in London, 1895, she successfully applied for the headship of Swansea Municipal Secondary Girls School. A committed suffragette, she, together with fellow west country woman and lifelong friend Clara Neal, joined the Women's Freedom League in 1908 following an anti-suffrage meeting in Swansea attended by Lloyd George, and set up a local branch. Like many other members of the Women's Freedom League, Neal and Phipps, together with two training college lecturers and a business woman, staged a boycott on the night of the 1911 Census, staying overnight in a sea cave on the nearby Gower Peninsula. At the NUWT dinner called to celebrate full female suffrage she explained the reason for the action: \\"Many women had determined that since they could not be citizens for the purposes of voting, they would not be citizens for the purpose of helping the government to compile statistics: they would not be included in the Census Returns.\\" Emily Phipps was an active member of the National Union of Women Teachers (NUWT), which was formed as part of the National Union of Teachers (NUT) in 1906, following on from the Equal Pay League. (The NUWT became an independent organisation in 1920, and remained in operation until 1961). Emily was elected President for three successive years from 1915 to 1917 and was the first editor of the NUWT journal, Woman Teacher, from 1919 to 1930, later tasked with writing the History of the NUWT (published in 1928).Wallace 2009, pp. 260‚Äì61 The 1918 general election was the first in which women could both vote in parliamentary elections and stand as candidates, and Emily Phipps was one of the 17 women who took the opportunity to stand, becoming Independent Progressive candidate for Chelsea constituency with the backing of the NUWT. All the women candidates were heavily defeated, but she retained her deposit in a straight contest (with a low turnout) with the sitting Conservative MP, Sir Samuel Hoare.Wallace 2009, p. 253  Later life and death  While still a head-teacher, Emily Phipps studied for the bar in the evenings and was admitted as a barrister in 1925.

The technique is realized using incoherent sources of radiation e.g. Xenon arc lamps, LEDs or supercontinuum (SC) lasers, hence the name. Typically in IBBCEAS, the wavelength selection of the transmitted light takes place after the cavity by either dispersive or interferometric means. The light is either directly focused onto the entrance slit of a monochromator and imaged onto a charged coupled device (CCD) array via a dispersive optical element (e.g. a diffraction grating) or imaged onto the entrance aperture of a conventional interferometer. The spectrum is reconstructed taking the Fourier transform of the recorded interferogram. Similar to other cavity enhanced spectroscopic techniques, in IBBCEAS, the transmission signal strength is measured with and without the absorber of interest present inside the cavity ( I(Œª) and I0(Œª) respectively). From the ratio of the wavelength-dependent transmitted intensities, the effective reflectivity of the mirrors Reff(Œª) and the sample path length per pass d inside the cavity, the sample's extinction coefficient Œ±(Œª) is calculated as: :\\\\alpha(\\\\lambda)=\\\\left(\\\\frac{I_0(\\\\lambda)}{I(\\\\lambda)}-1\\\\right)\\\\frac{1-R_\\\\text{eff}(\\\\lambda)}{d} The sensitivity (smallest achievable Œ± for a given sample) increases for large mirror reflectivities and large path lengths in the cavity, which is maximal, if d equals the cavity length.(1-Reff) includes all unspecified losses per pass (e.g. scattering or diffraction losses) other than the losses due to the limited reflectivity of the cavity mirrors. Note that although the technique is often used for studying absorption, total light extinction, Œ±, is retrieved, and it therefore measures the sum of absorption and scattering. The advantages of IBBCEAS include: * High sensitivity, experimental simplicity * High temporal resolution * Simultaneous detection of multiple species due to the wide spectral coverage * No mode matching involved as in some Cavity Ring Down Spectroscopy applications (CRDS) * Applicable to solids, liquids, gases and plasmas. * Cost effective The disadvantages include: * Unlike CRDS, the sensitivity is dependent on the light source stability and the measurement accuracy of the transmitted intensity. * It requires a reliable calibration procedure to determine baseline optical losses of the system (often performed by calibration of reflectivity as a function of wavelength using known concentrations of sample in the cavity). * Lower spectral resolution compared to laser based methods. Measurement Principle IBBCEAS - Detailed Description Schematic of light passing an optical cavity. Note that the arrows only illustrate time-dependence of the light intensity and not its spatial distribution inside the cavity. For instance, if injected on-axis, all reflections happen symmetrically distributed around the optical axis. When the optical cavity is illuminated by an incoherent broadband light source like the white light of a lamp or LED, the mode structure of the cavity intensity can be neglected. Consider a cavity of length d formed by two identical high reflectivity mirrors(R1 = R2 = R > 99.9%) with losses L, which is continuously excited with incoherent light of intensity Iin. For an empty resonator with L = 0, the time integrated transmitted intensity I0 is given by :I_0=I_{in}\\\\frac{1-R}{1+R} The intensity of light transmitted by the cavity, I( = I0 \\\\+ I1 \\\\+ I2 \\\\+ ‚ãØ ), can be described by the superposition of the light after an odd number of passes, leading to a geometric series: :I=I_{in}(1-R)^2(1-L)\\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty R^{2n}(1-L)^{2n} Since R < 1 and L < 1 the series converges to: :I=I_{in}\\\\frac{(1-R)^{2}(1-L)}{1-R^{2}(1-L)^2} Assuming the losses per pass to be solely due to Lambert-Beer attenuation, i.e. , the extinction coefficient, Œ± can be written as :\\\\alpha=\\\\frac{1}{d}\\\\left\\\\vert\\\\ln\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{2R^{2}}\\\\left(\\\\sqrt{4R^{2} + \\\\left(\\\\frac{I_0}{I}(R^{2}-1)\\\\right)^2}+\\\\frac{I_0}{I}(R^2-1)\\\\right)\\\\right)\\\\right\\\\vert In case of small losses per pass, L ‚Üí 0, and high reflectivities of the mirrors, R ‚Üí 1, Œ± can then be approximated as :\\\\alpha\\\\approx\\\\frac{1}{d}\\\\left(\\\\frac{I_0}{I}-1\\\\right)(1-R) Approximating Œî I / I 0 ‚âà (I 0 \\\\- I) / I 0 ‚âà (I 0 \\\\- I) / I, the minimum absorption coefficient, Œ±min, can be expressed by the following equation: :\\\\alpha_{min}=\\\\frac{1}{d}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\Delta I_{min}}{I_{0}}\\\\right)(1-R) where Œî I min is the minimum detectable change in intensity smaller than I_{0}. The maximum sensitivity (for given R and d) is limited by the intensity of the lamp, the dispersion of the monochromator, and the noise of the detector.The above equation demonstrates that the effective path length is (1-R)‚àí1 times longer than that of a conventional single pass experiment. Fiedler et al. have studied in detail the influence of cavity parameters like the cavity length, mirror curvature and reflectivity, different light injection geometries on the IBBCEAS signal. Experimental Setup =Free space IBBCEAS= A basic IBBCEAS setup consists of an incoherent light source, collimation optics, the absorber of interest and a detector. The incoherent source of radiation is spectrally filtered to match the bandwidth of the high reflectivity cavity mirrors. The filtered light is passively coupled into a stable optical cavity formed by two mirrors. Due to the high reflectivity of the mirrors effective absorption path lengths can reach a few kilometres. Light transmitted through the cavity is detected using a suitable detector, for example, a monochromator / charge coupled device (CCD) combination interfaced with a computer. To obtain quantitative results, the reflectivity of the mirrors must be accurately determined. This is usually accomplished by measuring the reflectivity as a function of wavelength using known concentrations of a calibration sample inside the cavity. By knowing the number density n (molecules/cm3) and wavelength-dependent absorption cross-section of the calibration sample, the effective reflectivity Reff(Œª) can be determined by: :R_\\\\text{eff}(\\\\lambda)=1-\\\\sigma(\\\\lambda)nd\\\\left(\\\\frac{I_0}{I}-1\\\\right)^{-1} where œÉ(Œª) is the known absorption cross-section of the gas and d is the length of the cavity.Figure 2: Basic IBBCEAS experimental setup =Fiber ring IBBCEAS= Incoherent broadband cavity enhanced spectroscopy can be constructed also using fiber ring resonators to attain alignment free setup. The experimental setup for the dual coupler resonator and single coupler cavity are shown in the figure 3, respectively. Figure 3:Fiber ring IBBCEAS experimental setup a) dual coupler b) single coupler Figure 3 (a) depicts the dual coupler resonator which consists of two directional couplers. On other hand, figure 3 (b) depicts the single coupler resonator which consists of a single directional coupler. In both configurations, a gas cell filled and a gain medium (to compensate the loss and enhance the effective length). For the dual coupler configuration, the external source is used as a broadband source which is in our case the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) of another gain medium. While the single coupler configuration, the ASE gain medium placed inside the cavity is used as a broadband incoherent source. In both configurations, the output of the resonator is fed to an OSA. The response of the optical cavity should be characterized by any other means as mentioned before in case of Free space IBBCEAS. The analysis for dual coupler configuration is the same as the analysis of free space Fabry-Perot cavity that has been done in the previous section. Yet, the analysis for single coupler configuration will vary. Fourier Transform Incoherent Broadband Cavity Enhanced Spectroscopy (FT-IBBCEAS) Fourier Transform Incoherent Broadband Cavity Enhanced Spectroscopy (FT-IBBCEAS) is a variant of IBBCEAS which uses a Fourier transform spectrometer/photodiode instead of the conventional monochromator/CCD in order to establish a spectrum. In this case, the absorption is determined from the Fourier Transform of the intensity of light escaping the cavity. The combination of a Fourier transform spectrometer allows for high spectral resolution to be achievable, however, at the expense of good temporal resolution, making the technique less suitable for kinetic studies. On the other hand, the approach provides an improvement to conventional Fourier Transform spectroscopy for gas applications where small sample volumes are required (e.g. for discharges, combustion plasmas, flames or chemical flow reactors). The figure above shows the spin forbidden O2 b-band at ~ 14500 cm‚àí1 (688 nm) measured in ambient air at atmospheric pressure using a xenon arc lamp compared against a calculated HITRAN spectrum. The cavity was formed by two dielectric high reflectivity mirrors (R>0.996 at 662 nm) separated by 89 cm. The characteristic doublets of the O2 b-band and the bandhead of the R branch are visible in the experimental spectrum. In order to fully exploit the selectivity feature of Fourier transform spectroscopy, the near infrared region is of interest because many overtone spectra of atmospherically relevant gases are located in this part of the spectrum. Some of these studies include the detection of overtone bands of CO2, OCS, CH3CN and HD18O in the near IR. Applications of IBBCEAS * Pollution monitoring * Combustion Diagnostics * Atmospheric trace gas detection * Aerosol science * Breath Analysis * Fundamental Science and Research * Chemical Reaction Kinetics Selected Literature Since its development in 2003, IBBCEAS has been used with a wide variety of incoherent light sources, including arc lamps, LEDs, SLEDs and supercontinnum sources. =Arc lamp= IBBCEAS was first demonstrated on the basis of the spin and symmetry forbidden Œ≥-band b^{1}\\\\Sigma_{g}^{+}(v^'=2) \\\\leftarrow X^{3}\\\\Sigma_{g}^{-}(v^{}=0) of molecular oxygen using a short-arc Xe lamp. The application of IBBCEAS to isolated jet cooled gas-phase species was demonstrated in continuous supersonic jets almost two decades ago and recently, to pulsed jets. Arc lamps have been used for cavities as small as 80 mm to study optical absorption of liquids and very long cavities of 20 m length for sensitive in situ measurements of NO3 and NO2 concentrations in an atmospheric simulation chamber. Recent studies have demonstrated their application in Evanescent Wave-IBBCEAS using a mirror-prism-mirror cavity configuration to measure absorption spectra of metallo-porphyrins in thin solution layers. Other applications of Xe lamp based IBBCEAS include its combination with discharge flow tubes for absorption measurements of marine boundary layer species like I2, IO and OIO, and for measuring weak near-UV and visibleWashenfelder, R.

Phys., 2008, 8, 7779. gas phase absorption spectra. =LEDs= IBBCEAS has been used in conjunction with LEDs and superluminescent LEDs in a number of gas phase and liquid analyte studies. Simultaneous concentration measurements of NO2 and NO3 have been achieved using LED based IBBCEAS within the ppbv detection limit. The advantages of using LEDs as light source are their compactness, long life, power efficiency and price. Also, due to the small area emission, the emitted power per unit area at the peak wavelength can approach that of Xe arc lamps. However, the LED output is often temperature dependent; hence they require temperature stabilization for IBBCEAS applications. More recently, LED-IBBCEAS has been applied to simultaneous open path measurements of HONO and NO2 in the UV region with detection limits of 430 pptv and 1 ppbv respectively and acquisition times in the order of a few seconds. =Supercontinuum radiation sources= SC sources are attractive for spectroscopic applications owing to their broad wavelength coverage, which enables spectral signatures of multiple species to be detected simultaneously. In comparison to lamps and LEDs, these sources provide higher spectral brightness, permitting more rapid measurements to be performed. Detection sensitivities at picomolar concentration levels in solution have been reported for BBCEAS measurements with SC sources with signal acquisition times in the lower millisecond range. Though initial studies on FT-IBBCEAS reported lower sensitivities in comparison with CRDS experiments, more recent breath analysis applications with supercontinuum sources have reported sensitivities in the order of 10‚àí9 cm‚àí1 within 4 minutes acquisition time.

Significance  Due to a combination of factors, by the end of the 1970s, the Parliament-Funkadelic enterprise was starting to crumble. Dissatisfaction with George Clinton's poor financial management led to the departure of several key members, including Glenn Goins and Jerome Brailey. Haskins, Simon, and Thomas (who had performed with Clinton and bass vocalist Ray Davis as The Parliaments since the late 1950s) felt increasingly marginalized by the influx of new P-Funk musicians, and in 1977, they refused to sign a new management contract they believed would require them to relinquish all rights to the names Parliament and Funkadelic. Shortly thereafter, the three singers left Parliament-Funkadelic and formed their own band, which they named \\"Funkadelic\\", and recorded Connections & Disconnections. Their use of the name Funkadelic resulted in an acrimonious legal dispute with Clinton's organization, which accelerated the disintegration of Parliament-Funkadelic.

It is situated in the Namib Desert, approximately from Walvis Bay on the banks of Kuiseb River. Utuseb has approximately 700 inhabitants and belongs to the Walvis Bay Rural electoral constituency. The people living here belong to the «ÇAonin (Southern Topnaar) community, a subtribe of the Nama people. History Topnaars began settling in the area of Walvis Bay and along the Kuiseb River during the start of the 19th century. They first occupied the area at the mouth of the Swakop River, today the city of Swakopmund, and moved south beyond Walvis Bay to the Kuiseb mouth between 1820 and 1830. A small faction moved upriver to Sandfontein but was attacked and driven away by warriors of the Red Nation. They receded to Rooibank (Scheppmannsdorf during Imperial Germany's colonial rule of South-West Africa). Missionary Heinrich Schmelen and Captain Amraal Lambert of the Kai«Äkhauan (Khauas Nama) visited the Topnaar around 1824 or 1825 while searching for a hospitable place at the coast to improve logistics for the support of the missionaries in the hinterland. The place was originally called Iduseb (Khoekhoe: people want to live there but there is no water) but as its spelling and pronunciation changed, so did the meaning of the name: Utuseb in Khoekhoe means something half-round that is situated in a round area. A memorial stone of the Topnaar, the Ebenesser «ÅHaibeb Gedenksteen (Afrikaans and Khoekhoe: Captain «ÅHaibeb Memorial Stone) is situated in the settlement. It was erected in 1982 and bears the inscription \\"So far the Lord has helped\\", as well as the symbols for the «ÇAonin (a palm tree) and the Hurinin (a fish).

However, he was unable to break into the first team and, after loan spells with Peterborough United, Royal Antwerp and Charlton Athletic, he joined CFR Cluj in September 2014. He is also capped for Italy at under-19 level. Club career =A.S.

During the 2007‚Äì08 season, he scored 14 goals in 19 appearances for the Roma youth team, alerting Manchester United to his talents. But the AS Roma offered him a contract worth only around ¬£16,000 per annum, the minimum wage for Italian youth team players, claiming that it would upset the other youth players who had already accepted similar deals if they offered him any more. However, despite the club's claims that he would have been given opportunities in the first team in the 2008‚Äì09 season, Petrucci expressed concerns that he had not already been called up. When he asked Roma for some time to consider their offer, the club gave him a three-day deadline. Around this time, Manchester United offered Petrucci a ¬£95,000-a-year contract, which the Italian youngster accepted on 13 June 2008. To comply with FIFA regulations with regard to the international transfer of players under the age of 18, United also offered Petrucci's father, Stefano, a job as well as offering to pay for regular flights back to Italy. =Manchester United= United paid Roma approximately ¬£200,000 in compensation for the transfer, which the Italians were unable to contest as Petrucci was not under contract with them. Italian football regulations state that under-17s may not be signed to professional contracts, meaning that Petrucci would not have been able to sign with Roma until his 17th birthday in October 2008. He travelled to Manchester on 30 June 2008, and began training with Manchester United the following day. At the end of July 2008, Petrucci was part of the Manchester United team that won the Premier (under-17) section of the 2008 Milk Cup. He made regular appearances for the Manchester United under-18 side during the 2008‚Äì09 season, and got his first taste of reserve team action on 18 November 2008, when he played 20 minutes of a 2‚Äì1 defeat away to Hull City, coming on as a substitute for Antonio Bryan. On 22 January 2009, he made another appearance for the reserve team in the Manchester Senior Cup, scoring the first of the team's three goals in the fourth minute of a 3‚Äì0 win over Accrington Stanley. Loan to Peterborough United On 9 January 2013, Petrucci joined Peterborough United on loan, he joined along with his teammate Scott Wootton who was signed until the end of the season. He made his debut on 12 January in a 2‚Äì1 defeat to Nottingham Forest. He scored his first professional goal in a 2-1 win over Leicester City on 9 February 2013. Loan to Royal Antwerp On 2 September 2013, Petrucci was initially loaned to Belgian side Royal Antwerp until the end of the season, but was recalled in January 2014. On 27 March 2014, Petrucci joined Championship side Charlton Athletic on loan until the end of the 2013‚Äì14 season. =CFR Cluj= On 8 September 2014, after being named in United's 25-man Premier League squad, Petrucci terminated his contract by mutual consent to secure a move to Romanian side CFR Cluj, six days after the transfer window closed. =√áaykur Rizespor= On 29 August 2016, Petrucci was reported to have joined Turkish side √áaykur Rizespor. =Ascoli= On 13 July 2019, he signed a 2-year contract with Ascoli. =Cosenza= On 5 October 2020 he moved to Cosenza on a one-year contract.

Retrieved on 2 May 2009 Administratively it is part of Kara-Suu District in Kyrgyzstan's Osh Region and is encircled by the Andijan Region of Uzbekistan. Its population was 627 in 2009. The small town, located in the Fergana Valley, was later estimated to consist of 153 families (approximately 1,000 residents). It is located about 4 km northwest of the road from Osh (Kyrgyzstan) to Khodjaabad (Uzbekistan) near the Kyrgyz‚ÄìUzbek border in the direction toward Andijan ().Map showing the location of the Kyrgyz village Barak. Retrieved on 2 May 2009 This places it approximately 1.5 km from the Uzbek/Kyrgyz border, near Ak-Tash village. Border dispute Kyrgyzstan's 1991 pre-independence border is the de jure international border, but much of it is hotly disputed with its neighbors. In August 1999, the area around Barak was occupied by Uzbekistan, cutting it off from Kyrgyz territory. Uzbek forces dug up and blockaded the road to Ak-Tash, while also seizing large areas of Kyrgyz land that allegedly had been loaned in the Soviet era but never returned. They entrenched themselves within much of Kyrgyz border territory and refused to leave. Barak became a de facto enclave only 1.5 km from the shifted main border. Four Uzbek enclaves and Barak are major sticking points in border delimitation talks, and disputes center on the areas of Barak, Sokh, Gava and Gavasay (stream). (Map) In 2011, many villagers asked the government to re-settle them within the main border. Kyrgyz officials fear, however, that if the people leave Barak then Kyrgyzstan will not be able to keep its enclave. Effect on villagers Barak had a population in 2011 of 153 families and over 1000 people. The enclave is surrounded by Uzbekistan. \\"[In Barak] there's a village school, there's a [cultural center] and there's little shop. But there are no post offices and no government buildings or any other type of employment. There is no bank. Barak is tiny.\\" Barak became an enclave when Uzbekistan forces blockaded the road leading to Ak-Tash, the nearest Kyrgyz village and the border connection on which it depends. In the following three years, border controls were greatly increased, with a daily routine of exhaustive border checks for residents. In February 2003, villagers went to Osh to protest the Uzbek border restrictions. There, a chance meeting with Prime Minister Nikolai Tanayev led to Uzbekistan removing the concrete blockade and re-opening the road. The following month, officials of the two states signed a protocol to ease restrictions on Barak residents. In practice, however, nothing changed to simplify procedures for their entry and exit. Soviet-era borders Border demarcations that were once of little significance are now affecting the lives of ordinary people in dramatic ways. The USSR's national-territorial delimitation of 1924‚Äì1927 was the first chapter of an ongoing story of twentieth-century border-moving, which continued beyond the Soviet Union's collapse. Although the Soviet era saw numerous demarcation commissions, none fully resolved questions regarding isolated territorial enclaves, temporary land leases that were never returned, unpaid rent agreements, and conflicting maps showing the borders running in different places. Soviet border commissions in the 1920s and 1950s failed to finish their work. The map-makers of this era likely never thought their lines would one day be international borders. Government planning projects spilled freely across internal borders. Even when land rental contracts existed, rents often went uncollected and the land unreturned upon contact expiration. Borders in the Fergana Valley in Soviet times bore little relevance to everyday life. Hence, later demarcation of its international borders has been complex. As a result, today large areas of land officially claimed by one state in the Fergana Valley are being farmed by citizens of the other states, an example of which lies along the Batken- Isfara (Kyrgyzstan-Tajikistan) border, where over 1300 hectares of land are disputed. A similar situation exists along the Uzbekistan-Kyrgyzstan border, where before 1991 the Uzbek SSR had rented large amounts of land for agricultural and industrial use. Despite renting for fixed terms, the Uzbek SSR often never returned the land nor paid rent, accompanied by the inevitable growth of settlements over time. For example, in 1999 a Kyrgyz deputy claimed to have a copy of a 1960s agreement renting 45,000 hectares to the Uzbek SSR, which should have terminated in 1980.Megoran (2002), op. cit., p 134. \\"filmmaker and outspoken opposition deputy, Dooronbek Sad√Ørbaev ‚Ä¶ claimed to have possession of a copy of an agreement renting 45,000 hectares of land to Uzbekistan in the 1960s that should have been returned in 1980, but never was.\\" Kyrgyzstan also has some territories that it leased for cattle raising during the Soviet period and which it has not given up. Complications at independence In 1991, independence presented a complicated and uncertain geography. The Fergana Valley republics were heir to decades-long patterns of land use that freely transgressed boundaries. Those boundaries had never been fully demarcated, and different maps showed different borders.Megoran (2002), op. cit., p 42. \\"independence presented a complicated and uncertain boundary geography: heir of Soviet-era patterns of land-use that wantonly transgressed the administrative boundaries of the Ferghana Valley republics. Those boundaries themselves had never been fully demarcated, and different maps showed different borders.‚Äù The effects of Soviet era planning were not felt in the years immediately following independence, apart from a brief crisis in 1993. Daily cross-border life in the valley continued almost uninterrupted, with large borderland areas being used by the people of neighboring states. This occurred both through illegal squatting and pre-existing fixed-term territorial leases. For example, Uzbekistan's Marhamat region was using 6885 hectares of land from Osh's Aravon region,Megoran (2002), op. cit., p 43. \\"significant areas of the borderlands were being utilised by citizens of neighbouring states. This occurred both through informal illegal squatting and formal fixed-term inter-state territorial leases. ‚Ä¶ Even though 30,000 hectares of Kyrgyzstani land in the Alay region was due to have been returned by Tajikistan‚Äôs Kurab region in 1992, the land is still being utilised. Uzbekistan‚Äôs Marhamat region was utilising 6885 hectares of land from Osh‚Äôs Aravon region,\\" the two of which share a border of only about 125 km (still in dispute in 2011). Until 1998 it still was possible to travel across state boundaries almost as though they were internal ones. However, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan were slowly drifting apart through the 1990s as the two republics became differentiated.Megoran (2002), op. cit., p 44. ‚ÄúThe effects of Soviet era border-planning were not felt in the years immediately following independence, apart from a brief crisis in 1993. ‚Ä¶ [D]aily cross-border life in the Valley continued almost uninterrupted. ‚Ä¶ However, the two republics (Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan) slowly ‚Äòdrifted apart‚Äô as they became increasingly differentiated in tangible ways.\\" Conflict in 1999 The Batken War Monument near the Ministry of Defense. Major conflict erupted in 1999 that in part centered on Uzbekistan's unilateral demarcation of its border and its alleged seizure of large areas of Kyrgyz agricultural land loaned to Uzbekistan for temporary usage during the Soviet period but never returned. ‚ÄúOn February 13, 1999, Uzbekistan's president, Islam Karimov, confirmed that the major Osh- Andijon cross-border bus service, along with many other routes in the Ferghana Valley, had been suspended. ‚Ä¶ Closure of the border was accelerated three days later when a carefully-orchestrated series of bomb blasts rocked the Uzbekistani capital Tashkent, killing 16[.] ‚Ä¶ Uzbekistan immediately sealed its border, ... security was dramatically tightened up ‚Ä¶ and special units were deployed to sensitive border areas. New control posts were built and existing facilities upgraded, and in many places crossings were closed, roads dug up, and bridges demolished. ‚Ä¶ The effects of these unilateral measures were keenly felt by Kyrgyzstanis.\\"Megoran (2002), op. cit., p 45. \\"On February 13, 1999, Uzbekistan's president, Islam Karimov, confirmed that the major Osh- Andijon cross-border bus service, along with many other routes in the Ferghana Valley, had been suspended. ‚Ä¶ Closure of the border was accelerated three days later when a carefully-orchestrated series of bomb blasts rocked the Uzbekistani capital Tashkent, killing 16[.] ‚Ä¶ Uzbekistan immediately sealed its border, ... security was dramatically tightened up ‚Ä¶ and special units were deployed to sensitive border areas.

Following this, the opposition press continued to carry numerous reports of Uzbekistan's border policies encroaching onto Kyrgyzstan.Megoran (2004), op. cit., p 752. In August 1999, the area around Barak was occupied by Uzbekistan, cutting it off from Kyrgyz territory. Uzbek forces dug up and blockaded the road to Ak-Tash. Throughout 1999, the Kyrgyzstani government did not physically attempt to contest the new border and concomitant control posts that Uzbekistan established.Megoran (2004), op. cit., p 753. Rather, Kyrgyzstan sought to keep the border open to trade, while insisting on entering into talks to delimit the border. However, Uzbekistan quickly clamped down on crossings that it did not authorize. The unilateral restrictions massively obstructed the movement of both goods and people. Nevertheless, IMU extremists found ways to operate over the border throughout 1999. Uzbek troops and border guards began excursions into Kyrgyzstan to suppress the extremists. Although Kyrgyz authorities condemned the territorial violations, Uzbekistan continued them and stepped up its threats by mining the border and constructing barriers and watchtowers, sometimes deep within Kyrgyz territory. Uzbek forces entrenched themselves on this territory and refused to leave. After the end of the IMU guerilla fighting in Batken, a new development emerged that threatened to spark an even graver crisis between the two states than the events in the spring. Not only did Uzbekistan control the border, it began a unilateral demarcation of its border in the Fergana Valley. This did not go unnoticed by Kyrgyzstani journalists and politicians, who persistently objected and accused Uzbekistan of advancing border checkpoints along roads into Kyrgyz territory. Around the start of October and onward, Uzbekistan began erecting a \\"2-meter high barbed-wire perimeter fence along large stretches of the Valley boundary, and mining other stretches. This led to widespread accusations within Kyrgyzstan that Uzbekistan was actually fencing off tens of thousands of hectares of Kyrgyzstani land.\\"Megoran (2004), op. cit., p 733-734. Kyrgyz- Uzbek delimitation talks By February 2000, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan had begun to work jointly to demarcate the Kyrgyz-Uzbek border; however, progress was very slow. One year later, a meeting between the two countries' prime ministers ended with a promise to meet again to discuss border demarcation, which had become the thorniest issue in bilateral relations. About 150 spots along the Uzbek-Kyrgyz border were disputed. A renewed effort resulted in a signed memorandum which would have given Uzbekistan a land corridor running the 40 kilometres along the Sokh River to its enclave of Sokh. In exchange for that corridor, Kyrgyzstan was to receive a smaller corridor to Barak.\\" The memorandum caused political backlash in Kyrgyzstan and was never implemented. By February 2002, only 209 out of 1,400 kilometres had been jointly demarcated, although 994 kilometres had been studied. But the most controversial points remained: in the Osh and Batken regions, 406 kilometres were waiting to be studied by the joint commission. \\"The work also revealed the main disputed areas as being the enclaves of Barak and Sokh and the areas of Gava and Gavasay. Regarding these sites, the positions of the parties remained far from convergence.\\" According to a 2004 report by the International Crisis Group (ICG), border demarcation negotiations had been charged with tension. Talks had stalled over approximately 50 contested locations along the border between Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan. In 2006, the process of delimitation had been under way for six years, with agreement reached on only 993 kilometers of the state border, which was 1375 kilometers long. The remaining 382 kilometers of the state border were not on existing maps and therefore remained subject to conflict and mutual distrust. In 2009, a report stated, \\"a lack of funding has greatly hindered border demarcation efforts. ‚Ä¶ Complex terrain and conflicting Soviet-era maps ‚Äì printed at a time when defining the borders was not a pressing issue ‚Äì present the toughest obstacle to delimitation.\\" Nevertheless, an intergovernmental commission on the delimitation and demarcation of the border held its first meeting after a five-year break on 29 December 2010. In 2013 the two states' prime ministers were reported to be discussing the situation in the Barak enclave. Barak was not the only enclave that was a sticking point in negotiations. The Uzbek enclave of Sokh and three other Uzbek enclaves inside Kyrgyzstan were also major problems. Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan had delimited 1058 kilometers of the border (out of a total length of 1378.44 kilometers), which accounts for over 70 percent of the total length. By early 2014, in the ten years after 2004, talks still had not resulted in the delimitation of nearly 50 border sections with about 300 km length. Talks resumed in 2018 and the two countries reached an agreement to exchange Barak for land in Uzbekistan's Andijon region near the Kyrgyz village of Birleshken.Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan Agree To Work On Land Swap Near Border References Category:Populated places in Osh Region Category:Enclaves and exclaves ","title":"Barak, Kyrgyzstan"},{"id":"38328869","text":"Dindar Najman Shafiq Duski is an Iraqi Kurdish politician who is displacement and migration minister in the second cabinet of Nouri Maliki.

Located in Field Park at the west end of Williamstown, Massachusetts, in the center of the roundabout at the intersection of Massachusetts Route 2 and United States Route 7, the house was constructed by volunteers in 1953 in celebration of the town‚Äôs Bicentennial. Early settlers to the Hoosac Valley, the area now occupied by towns such as Williamstown and North Adams, were required by legal contract to build a house at least 15 by 18 feet and 7 feet high and to clear 5 acres of land to gain a title to their lot. History Williamstown, which began as West Hoosac in 1750, is a small Berkshire town located in the northwest corner of Massachusetts. The General Court of Massachusetts Bay Colony, for political, economic, and military reasons, made land plots available for sale in this area. West Hoosac was of particular military importance at this time because it acted as a pathway to Greenfield, Deerfield, and Charlemont eastward as well as towns to the south such as Great Barrington and Stockbridge. In 1751, 60 lots were put on sale for six pounds, thirteen shillings and fourpence each (2). The buyer was not fully entitled to his land, however, until he cleared 5 acres of land and built a house at least 15 feet wide, 18 feet long, and 7 feet high. This rule gave the buildings the name \\"regulation houses\\". Much of the land was purchased by soldiers at nearby Fort Massachusetts, including Captain Ephraim Williams, Jr., the benefactor of Williams College. Construction The 1753 House was built only with materials, tools, and methods that would have been used in 1753. The house was originally erected in Field Park but was relocated to its current location in 1996. The 1753 House closed in 2010 due to chimney damage, but reopened in November 2012 with a ceremonial fire lighting in the new chimney. The House was originally intended as a temporary exhibit, but it has remained a Williamstown landmark due to its popularity. Appearance Built with regulation dimensions, the 1753 House is quite small by modern standards. Using mortise and tenon joints, the walls and frame are made of oak timbers harvested from nearby White Oak woods. The roof uses split shingling. The interior includes a few historical replicas, such as a table, a bench, and fireplace cooking instruments. A loft covered in pine branches, about 7 feet above the dirt floor, provides a sleeping area closer to the chimney, which emanates heat. A large stone chimney serves as the central focal point of the building. Uses The 1753 House is a popular destination for locals and tourists alike. Although it is not open everyday as it once was, it hosts a variety of special events and visits from school groups. The House provides an interactive educational experience for students to understand the living conditions of early settlers in their own town. The House can also be reserved for personal use. Past uses have included a campout by Boy Scouts and a hearth-cooking demonstration by a high school student.

History UniVerse was originally developed by VMark Software and UniData was originally developed by the Unidata Corporation. Both Universe and Unidata are used for vertical application development and are embedded into the vertical software applications. In 1997, the Unidata Corporation merged with VMark Systems to form Ardent Software.'Ardent Definition', PC Magazine In March 2000, Ardent Software was acquired by Informix. IBM subsequently acquired the database division of Informix in April 2001,'Informix Definition' PC Magazine making UniVerse and UniData part of IBM's DB2 product family. IBM subsequently created the Information Management group of which Data Management is one of the sub-areas under which the IBM U2 family comprised UniData and UniVerse along with the tools, SystemBuilder Extensible Architecture (SB/XA), U2 Web Development Environment (U2 Web DE) and wIntegrate. On 1 October 2009 it was announced that Rocket Software had purchased the entire U2 portfolio from IBM.'Rocket Software U2 Acquisition Announcement', Rocket Software'Rocket Software to purchase U2 from IBM', International Spectrum The U2 portfolio is grouped under the name RocketU2. System structure =Accounts= Systems are made of one or more accounts. Accounts are directories stored on the host operating system that initially contain the set of files needed for the system to function properly. This includes the system's VOC (vocabulary) file that contains every command, filename, keyword, alias, script, and other pointers. Each of these classes of VOC entries can also be created by a user. =Files= Files are similar to tables in a relational database in that each file has a unique name to distinguish it from other files and zero to multiple unique records that are logically related to each other. Files are made of two parts: a data file and a file dictionary (DICT). The data file contains records that store the actual data. The file dictionary may contain metadata to describe the contents or to output the contents of a file. Hashed files For hashed files, a U2 system uses a hashing algorithm to allocate the file's records into groups based on the record IDs. When searching for data in a hashed file, the system only searches the group where the record ID is stored, making the search process more efficient and quicker than searching through the whole file. Nonhashed files Nonhashed files are used to store data with little or no logical structure such as program source code, XML or plain text. This type of file is stored as a subdirectory within the account directory on the host operating system and may be read or edited using appropriate tools. =Records= Files are made of records, which are similar to rows within tables of a relational database. Each record has a unique key (called a \\"record ID\\") to distinguish it from other records in the file. These record IDs are typically hashed so that data can be retrieved quickly and efficiently. Records (including record IDs) store the actual data as pure ASCII strings; there is no binary data stored in U2. For example, the hardware representation of a floating-point number would be converted to its ASCII equivalent before being stored. Usually these records are divided into fields (which are sometimes called \\"attributes\\" in U2). Each field is separated by a \\"field mark\\" (hexadecimal character FE). Thus this string: : might represent a record in the EMPLOYEE file with 123-45-6789 as the Record ID, JOHN JONES as the first field, jjones@company.com as the second field and $4321.00 as a monthly salary stored in the third field. (The up-arrow (^) above is the standard Pick notation of a field mark; that is, xFE). Thus the first three fields of this record, including the record ID and trailing field mark, would use 49 bytes of storage. A given value uses only as many bytes as needed. For example, in another record of the same file, JOHN JONES (10 bytes) may be replaced by MARJORIE Q. HUMPERDINK (21 bytes) yet each name uses only as much storage as it needs, plus one for the field mark. Fields may be broken down into values and even subvalues. Values are separated by value marks (character xFD); subvalues are separated by subvalue marks (character xFC). Thus, if John Jones happened to get a second email address, the record may be updated to: : where the close bracket (]) represents a value mark. Since each email address can be the ID of a record in separate file (in SQL terms, an outer join; in U2 terms, a \\"translate\\"), this provides the reason why U2 may be classified as a MultiValued database. =Data= Raw information is called Data. A record is a set of logical grouped data. e.g. an employee record will have data stored in the form of fields/attributes like his name, address etc. Programmability Both UniVerse and UniData have a structured BASIC language (UniVerse Basic and UniBasic, respectively), similar to Pick/BASIC which naturally operates on the structures of the MultiValue database. They also have a structured database query language (RetrieVe and UniQuery) used to select records for further processing and for ad hoc queries and reports. RocketU2 provides a set of Client Tools to allow software developers to access U2 databases from other software languages.'Client Tools', Rocket Corporation Client Tool interfaces include: * ODBC / JDBC * Intercall (C/C++) * UniOLEDB - OLEDB Driver * UniObjects (COM) * UniObjects (.NET) * UniObjects (Java) * Native XML * U2 Web Services * JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) * Python (available as of UniVerse 11.3 and UniData 8.2) Security Both UniVerse and UniData support TLS transport level data encryption and record and file level encryption of data at rest using OpenSSL. Additional API encryption functionality is also available to allow custom solutions or meet specific regulatory requirements. Professional certification RocketU2 offers three professional certification designations related to the U2 product family.'U2 Certifications', Rocket Software *Rocket U2 Application Developer *Rocket UniVerse Administration *Rocket UniData Administration Web-based applications for U2 data Rocket Software Universe and Unidata have limited ability to create web-based front-ends to Universe/UniData content. Since Rocket Software provides SQL access to its database products, a SQL-based product can be used to build a web-based UI to the databases; regardless of using Files or Tables in U2. A third-party application framework, can be used to build such web interfaces.

He served in the U.S. Air Force as a Medic during the Vietnam War from 1960 to 1964, and was a member of the USAF Tennis Team. From 1971 to 1976 he worked at Datagraphic Computer Services in North Hollywood, beginning as a delivery boy and later as a computer operator.\\"Bob Grumman.\\" Contemporary Authors Online. Detroit: Gale, 2007. Literature Resource Center. Web. Accessed 26 January 2013. He worked as a substitute teacher for 14 years starting in late 1994, mainly at Charlotte High School. He retired in 2008. Work Grumman's first book, Poemns was published in 1966. He went on to publish several books of visual poetry before moving on to mathematical poetry. Grumman describes mathematical poetry as \\"poetry that does mathematics, rather than merely discusses mathematics (or uses mathematical algorithms to choose its content, as in the Oulipo movement).\\"Richard Kostelanetz, H. R. Brittain (eds), A Dictionary of the Avant-Gardes, Routledge, 2000, p.397. Grumman's own \\"mathemaku\\" are influenced by the haiku form. Many of them \\"investigate the results of the long division of such quantities as the actual color blue by such quantities as the dictionary definition of 'blue'\\" but a few employ other mathematical operations. In his essays Grumman seeks to foster and promote avant-garde and especially minimalist practices in poetry. His essay \\"MNMLST poetry: Unacclaimed but flourishing\\" explored the subtleties in very compressed poems such as Aram Saroyan's single word works.Kanwar Dinesh Singh, New Explorations In Indian English Poetry, Sarup & Sons, 2004, pp.92-4 He divides minimalist poetry into two main categories, \\"infra-verbal\\" minimalism and \\"pluraesthetic\\" minimalism. The former involves fissional, fusional and mutational verbal techniques. The latter includes visual, mathematical and sound poems.

On October 25, he earned his first start of the season after Brice McCain was sidelined with a knee injury he suffered the previous week. Taylor finished the 44-26 victory over the Houston Texans with seven combined tackles and a pass deflection. He started Weeks 7-12 and was a healthy scratch for four of the last five games of the season after struggling. Interim head coach Dan Campbell replaced Taylor on the active roster with Tony Lippett. He played in 12 games with six starts finishing the year with 48 tackles (35 solo), four pass deflections, and a fumble recovery. =Cleveland Browns= On April 30, 2016, Taylor was traded to the Cleveland Browns along with a seventh round pick (250th overall) in the 2016 NFL Draft for the Browns' seventh round pick (223rd overall) in the same draft. The Dolphins used the selection to draft quarterback Brandon Doughty. 2016 Taylor entered the Cleveland Browns' training camp competing with Tramon Williams, K'Waun Williams, Pierre Desir, Briean Boddy- Calhoun, and Justin Gilbert for the second starting cornerback job. Head coach Hue Jackson named Taylor one of the Browns' starting cornerbacks to begin the regular season, alongside Joe Haden. He started the Browns' 10-29 season- opening loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, finishing with five solo tackles. On September 25, 2016, Taylor recorded a solo tackle, defended a pass, and made the first interception of his career, intercepting Miami Dolphins' quarterback Ryan Tannehill in a 24-30 overtime loss. The following game, he collected a season-high seven combined tackles, deflected a pass, and intercepted a pass from Kirk Cousins in a 20-31 loss to the Washington Redskins. In Week 16, he made five combined tackles, deflected three passes, and intercepted Philip Rivers as the Browns earned their first win of the season during a 20-17 victory over the San Diego Chargers.

During the festival a tornado tore through the festival site, uprooting stalls, tents, and the Main stage and also did damage to the second stage.
