It was member of the Amphictyonic League, and served as port for Thebes. In ancient times, it was believed to have had one of the mythical characters named Anthedon as its eponym. The ruins of the town are situated 1 1/2 mile from the village Loukisia. Ancient accounts The oldest mention of the city is found in Homer's Iliad, Catalogue of Ships,Iliad 2. 508 where it is given the epithet \\"furthermost\\", i. e. the most geographically remote town of Boeotia to the northern Gulf of Euboea. Ancient inhabitants of Anthedon derived their origin from the sea-god Glaucus, who was believed to have been originally a native of the place. A surviving ancient coin now stored in the Archaeological Museum of Chalkis bears on one side a representation of Glaucus. The Anthedonians appear to have been a different race from the other people of Boeotia, and are described by one writerLycophron, Alexandra, 754 as Thracians (this is a misinterpretation; in this case Anthedon is a Thracian man and not Anthedon the city in Boeotia). Dicaearchus informs that they were chiefly mariners, shipwrights and fishermen, who derived their subsistence from trading in fish, purple (dye, from seashells), and sponges. He adds that the agora was surrounded with a double stoa, and planted with trees.Dicaearchus, Βίος Ἑγγάδος, p. 145 ed. Fuhr An important archaeological guide to Anthedon is Pausanias' Description of Greece, which informs that there was a sacred grove of the Cabeiri in the middle of the town, surrounding a temple of those deities, and near it a temple of Demeter and Persephone. Outside the walls was a temple of Dionysus, and a spot called “the leap of Glaucus.”Paus. 9. 22. 5 - 6 The wine of Anthedon was celebrated in antiquity. The tomb of Iphimedeia and her sons, the Aloadae, was shown at Anthedon.Pausanias, Description of Greece 9. 22. 6 Archaeology The archaeological excavations that have taken place so far resulted in important discoveries, including temples of the Cabiri, Demeter and Persephone known from Pausanias' work. Also near the port has been found an Early Christian basilica of Late Roman years. The port of Anthedon was spacious for those times, and even had two jetties, the orifice of which could be closed with a chain in order to protect the harbor from enemy raids, as well as strong winds. The city suffered a decline during the Byzantine period, because of the raids of pirates. This forced residents to retreat inwards and specifically in the northern foothills of Mount Messapius (now Ktypas) and to establish a farmer settlement that became the nucleus of today's community Loukissia. During the transition from the beach to the foot of the mountain people made use of building material from the earlier buildings, of which was partly built the small church of St. George, now situated outside Loukisia. The temples of this structure provide valuable data for the study of Byzantine architecture and have been restored on behalf of the Ministry of Culture of Greece (July 2010). Excavations of the ancient port have been held by Greek as well as German and American archaeologists.

It is a planned trilogy, all published: Daughter of Smoke and Bone on 27 September 2011 in the United States; Days of Blood and Starlight on 6 November 2012 in the United States; and the third book Dreams of Gods and Monsters on April 1, 2014. The books have been published in a variety of different languages. Additionally, the novella \\"Night of Cake and Puppets\\" was published in 2013, focusing on the protagonist's best friend and taking place in the timeline of \\"Daughter of Smoke and Bone.\\" The trilogy follows Karou, a seventeen-year-old art student living in Prague and concerns an ancient war between Seraphim and Chimaera in a parallel universe. The series has received an array of nominations and awards, and a planned movie adaptation of Daughter of Smoke and Bone is under development.  Plot = Daughter of Smoke and Bone = A seventeen-year-old Prague art student named Karou leads an interesting life: she has blue hair that grows from her head, speaks a variety of languages, has three bullets in her stomach, and has been raised by creatures with human and animal features called chimaera. These are Brimstone, with lion legs and ram horns; Issa, with a snake's lower body, hood, and fangs; Twiga, with a giraffe neck; and Yasri, with a parrot beak. Kishmish, a crow with bat wings, acts as a messenger from Brimstone to Karou. Karou is often sent on missions to gather teeth for Brimstone, although she does not know what they are used for and why there are certain rules such as \\"no baby teeth\\" and \\"no rotting\\". In return she gets wishes; the higher the price, the greater the wish. When Karou and her best friend Zuzana are at a restaurant, Kishmish flies in bearing a letter from Brimstone saying to come immediately. Karou is sent off to Paris via a magical door to get a seven-foot-long matching pair of elephant tusks. When she finds another portal back to Brimstone's shop, she notices a scorched black handprint on the door, but fortunately she is able to get back home. Similar handprints are appearing across the world. When Karou returns to Brimstone's shop, a violent thud strikes the second door to the shop that Karou is forbidden from investigating. When Karou is on a mission in Marrakesh, a man with fiery eyes and wings notices her and chases after her to kill, but as Karou turns around, the man notices something about her that's familiar and stops himself just in time for her to escape. The man's name is Akiva, an angel. = Days of Blood and Starlight = Karou has taken up the job taken up of her adopted father Brimstone: the art of resurrection, which will bring the dead members of the broken chimaera army back to life to defeat the seraphim. Karou's best friend Zuzana and her boyfriend Mik begin looking for her after a mysterious e-mail and reports that a phantom girl has been stealing teeth. The son of the Warlord and new commander of the chimaera army, Thiago, has been courting Karou during her resurrection process and has offered up his own pain for the tithing process multiple times. He has specific resurrection instructions for her: make everyone larger, stronger, faster, and winged. Through this repeated process, the chimaera finally begin to win against the seraphim. Meanwhile, the Seraphim army is hunting all remaining Chimaera and enslaving or killing them. Many of them are attempting to flee to a southern mountain range where they might find safety. Akiva spends his days with the army hunting them and his nights flying ahead to warn them. Slowly, Hazael and then Liraz come around to his point of view. Zuzana and Mik find Karou and the Chimaera where they are hiding in the mountains of Morocco. They assist her in her task and befriend the Chimaera army. When Thiago sends out teams of soldiers to conduct a brutal campaign of terror on Seraph civilians, one group disobeys him and flies south to help the fleeing Chimaera. They are caught and killed by Jael, the emperor's brother, and his legion of soldiers, the Dominion. Ziri, the last other remaining Kirin, gleans their souls, but is caught. Akiva calls down birds to save him, and he escapes. When he returns, he tells Karou everything. Akiva comes to Karou, bringing a thurible with her name on it that he thought meant she was dead. Instead, it contains the soul of Issa, part of her adoptive family. Resurrected, Issa also assists Karou. Razgut, the fallen angel, is found by Jael's soldiers, and tells him about Karou and about the weapons humanity possesses. Akiva plans how to kill Joram, his father, to end the war with the Chimaera. When he is summoned to a council with Joram, he uses the opportunity to kill him. However, Jael has orchestrated the whole event, and used it to gain power. In the resulting battle, Hazael is killed. Akiva and Liraz escape and bring his body to Karou, but because they did not glean his soul, he cannot be resurrected. After she kills Thiago while he is attempting to rape her, Karou puts Ziri's soul into his body so that she will not be forced to resurrect Thiago. Zuzana and Mik are sent away for their safety, but return with news: Jael and his Dominion, wearing the white robes of angels in human mythology, have invaded Earth. Akiva returns with a proposition: unite the Chimaera and the Misbegotten to fight Jael. =Dreams of Gods and Monsters= Eliza Jones is a 24-year-old is a researcher in Washington, D.C., where she is working on her Ph.D. As a girl, she escaped a cult that worshipped her as a prophet and descendant of the angel Elazael. She has visions in her dreams of monsters coming from the sky. When the recently abandoned camp of the Chimaera in Morocco is found and the pit is excavated, her boss is called in to analyse it, and she travels with him. Seeing the corpses of the Chimaera triggers more visions. Jael has arrived with his soldiers, the Dominion, in Vatican City. Aided by Razgut, he portrays his forces as the angels from human mythology and asks humanity for help defeating devils; once he is armed with modern human technology, he intends to wipe out the Stelians. Akiva is discovered by Stelian emissaries who, following his accidental disruption of the fabric of the universe while casting a spell, intend to kill him. They realise he is the child of Festival, and follow him invisibly. Ziri, as Thiago, rescues Liraz from Haxaya, whom Liraz had killed an earlier incarnation of. Akiva figures out how to make the seraph soldiers invulnerable to the effects of Chimaera hamsas. The allied army travels to the portal to stop the Dominion, but are ambushed on the way, and Ziri and Liraz are presumed dead. On Earth, Karou, Akiva, Zuzana, Mik, and a Chimaera soldier discover Eliza, speaking prophesies in Seraphim, on their way to the Vatican. They are assisted by Esther, until she sells them out to Jael in exchange for the mining rights to Eretz. Esther throws Zuzana and Mik out of her hotel room, but they steal her stash of wishes given to her by Brimstone. Karou and Akiva attempt to infiltrate Jael's lodgings, but are expected. However, using the same spell Akiva used to synchronise the burning of Brimstone's portals, they are able to set an incendiary charge on Jael and force him to return to Eretz unarmed. Zuzana and Mik wish for Eliza to be returned to her best possible self, and she regains her memories as Elazael and transforms into a Seraphim. In Eretz, the Misbegotten and Chimera alliance has managed to convert the rest of the armed forces to their cause, and upon returning Jael is imprisoned. Ziri has died, but Liraz has gleaned his soul, and he is resurrected. Eliza, Mik, and Zuzana return to Eretz through another portal known to Elazael. The Stelians arrive to confront Akiva, whose magic has been damaging the fabric of the universe, endangering Eretz. Eliza tells the history of Eretz and reveals that the creation myth the Seraphim have involving \\"Godstars\\" is in fact a prophesy, and they are destined to battle the beasts that threaten Eretz together.  Inspirations and origin  The inspiration for the setting of Daughter and Smoke and Bone, Prague, came from a graphic novel that Taylor wrote with her husband. They were looking for settings when her best friend suggested Prague, so the two went to the city to get an idea of the setting. When Taylor was thinking of writing Daughter of Smoke and Bone, she decided to work with Prague again because of its \\"moody Gothic atmosphere\\", \\"stunning beauty\\", \\"mazy ways\\", the history and art of the setting, the marionettes, and because it gave her an excuse to go back to Prague. In addition, she chose the secondary setting of Marrakesh because she became \\"fascinated\\" with the city after reading Tahir Shah's books and My Marrakesh.  Publication history  Daughter of Smoke and Bone was first published in the United States on 27 September 2011 and was released in paperback on 11 October 2011. The novel was released in the United Kingdom in hardcover on 29 September 2011 and was published in paperback on 5 November 2011. It was released in Spanish on 9 October 2011, German on 23 October 2011, Italian on 4 November 2011, French on 18 October 2011, Russian on 28 November 2011, and Slovak on 8 November 2011.  Critical reception  Daughter of Smoke and Bone has garnered a positive reception from critics, with The New York Times saying that though they were disappointed in the fact that it was the first in a series, the descriptions and language made up for it, and they would read the next in the series.

Publishers Weekly gave the novel a starred review, praising the world that it was set in, Taylor's writing, and the suspense.

She was the half-sister of Sultans Mustafa III and Abdul Hamid I.Sicil-i Osmani, Mehmet Süreyya Bey, Tarih Vakfı Yurt Yayınları, Istanbul, 1996. Life=Birth= Esma Sultan was born on 14 March 1726 in the Topkapı Palace. Her father was Sultan Ahmed III, and her mother was Hanife Kadın. She was the thirty-ninth child born to her father. =Marriages= In 1743, her cousin Sultan Mahmud I, arranged her marriage to Yakub Pasha. The marriage took place in February 1743 in the Kadırga Palace. Yakub Pasha died the same year. After his death, she married the governor of Adana, Yusuf Pasha. After his death, she married Muhsinzade Mehmed Pasha, a vizier on 24 June 1758 in the Kadırga Palace. Her served as the Grand Vizier between 1765 and 1768, and later again between 1771 until his death in 1774. She is said to be curious about the west. She received the wife and mother-in- law of the Baron de Tott, the Hungarian nobleman who served as military adviser to the Turkish government for many years. She discussed with them the liberty of European women, and expressed the dissatisfaction that married her at a young age to an old man who treated her like a child. The pasha having died, she then married a younger man more to her liking, but the practice of sending the princesses husband to distant governorships kept them apart. =Properties= Esma Sultan had her crown states turned into mâlikane contracts, which were divided among her protégés, and managed by agents and subcontractors. The name of one of her male associates appeared as contractor in his own right. Esma also complained that her late husband, Mehmed Pasha, had promised her the income from Vâsıf's prebend from Anatolia. She accused him of stealing the grant, confiscated it, and transferred it to her own client. Because she was so close to the Sultan, and because Vâsıf lacked influential patrons, he couldn't find anyone to intercede on his behalf, and was left without a job and income. Esma Sultan was allocated the mansion of Princess Hançerli Sultan in Eyüp Bahariye, which became famous with her own name. She also owned a waterfront palace in Ortaköy, and a farm in Terkos. =Charities= In 1779, Esma Sultan commissioned a fountain for the soul of her late husband, Mehmed Pasha, in her name near the namazgah in Kadırga Square. She also commissioned another fountain in her name in the same place in 1781. Death Esma Sultan died on 13 August 1788 in the Kadırga Palace, and was buried in the mausoleum of Muhsinzade Mehmed Pasha in Eyüp. In popular culture *In 2012 Turkish miniseries Esir Sultan, Esma is portrayed by Turkish actress Hande Kazanova.

Constructed by the Ursuline Sisters, a Catholic religious institute for women, the building was complete in 1912. It was originally known as the Ursuline Academy Boarding and Day School, a school for children age five to 12. The building came to be known as Ursuline Centre in 1971. Ursuline sisters continued to live in the building, but rented out its classrooms and kitchen spaces as a retreat center and a meeting place. As of 2012, only one Ursuline sister continued to live at the site. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 26, 1991. Construction of the building View of St. Peter's Mission between 1896 and 1908. The Ursuline stone convent and school is center-left. The original wood frame girls' school is center-right and low (with bell tower). In March 1860, Jesuit priests established St. Peter's Mission on the Sun River about upriver from Fort Shaw, Montana. They moved the mission downstream in 1862, but this location proved difficult for agriculture. In April 1866 the mission moved again, this time to a position south of Bird Tail Rock (which is south of the modern town of Simms, Montana). The mission closed almost immediately due to hostility from the Piegan Blackfeet, but reopened in 1874. The mission moved again in 1881 to Birch Creek (a point about west-northwest of Cascade, Montana).Harrod, p. 53-55.Aarstad, p. 252, 318. In January 1884, the new (and founding) Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Helena, Jean-Baptiste Brondel, invited the Ursuline religious order to join the Jesuits at St. Peter's Mission and assist them in teaching converted Native Americans. Leader of the Toledo chapter, Mother Amadeus (Sarah Therese Dunne), led five Ursulines to St. Peter's in October. They quickly established a boarding school for girls (open to children of settlers and Native Americans). The Jesuits gave the nuns a farm to help them survive, and promised to pay them $200 a year to teach boys if more nuns could be brought to the mission.Schrems, p. 49-50. The Ursulines built a large stone building between 1882 and 1887 which served as their school and convent. The school later moved into a two-story wood frame building, and the sisters built a bakery, barn, corral, laundry, and workers' housing. The Ursulines—who believed in music and art training as well as education in reading, math, and science—also built a three-story opera house at St. Peter's in 1896. In 1908, the wood frame Ursuline school at St. Peter's Mission burned to the ground.Schrems, p. 104; Porter and Scott, p. 39.The stone convent/school burned in 1918, causing the abandonment of St. Peter's Mission. See: Porter and Scott, p. 39. The Ursulines decided to move the center of their activity to nearby Great Falls, which was founded in 1883.Aarstad, p. 274. The sisters were strongly supported by Bishop Mathias Lenihan, who led the Roman Catholic Diocese of Great Falls (which had formed in 1904).Porter and Scott, p. 43. The Great Falls Townsite Company offered them any two city blocks. The Ursulines choose an area bordered by Central Avenue, 25th Street South, 2nd Avenue South, and 23rd Street South. The area was on a slight hill with a good view and relatively distant from the busy downtown commercial district. Mother Francis Siebert oversaw the design and construction of the new building, which was named Ursuline Academy. The city agreed to close a block of 1st Avenue South and 24th Street South to create a unified grounds for the Ursulines.Porter and Scott, p. 42. Noted local architect George H. Shanley designed the structure in a variation on the Gothic Revival style known as Collegiate Gothic Revival.Robison, p. 71. Shanley donated a portion of his fee to the sisters, while contributions from the community and loans paid for the building. The Anaconda Copper Company, which owned the huge copper smelter in town, contributed the bricks.Kolstad, Polly. \\"Ursuline Centre: Take a Step Back In Time.\\" Great Falls Tribune. December 1, 2006. The cornerstone was laid in September 1911. Construction by the local firm of Leighland Kleppe and Company began in October 1911,Porter and Scott, p. 44.Federal Writers' Project, p. 153. and a pulley system, powered by horses, hauled brick and mortar into the air to the workmen. The school opened for students on September 3, 1912. Ursuline Academy was constructed on the northwest corner of the property. The north side of the structure was its main entrance. The eastern half of the property consisted of large gardens. Two rooms of note were furnished at the time Ursuline Academy was completed. The first, the Green Parlor, was designed for entertaining guests, hosting teas, and special occasions. It was furnished with green rugs, upholstered furniture, and lightly tinted, translucent green window draperies. The room contained an 1840 harp made in France which was the property of Mother Angela Lincoln (a relative of Abraham Lincoln) and a baby grand piano manufactured by the Steinway company. The piano was the gift of a student, whose father gave it to her as a graduation present. The other room was the Bishop's Parlor, a private suite for the bishop and important visitors. The suite consisted of a sitting room, bedroom, and bath room. The sitting room was furnished with finely carved dark oak furniture and bookcases retrieved from St. Peter's Mission, and the bedroom with dressers made of cherry. History of the building The Ursuline Academy originally was open only to girls. When the school opened, enrollment consisted of 40 boarders, 25 day students, and 30 part-time music students. The Ursuline Sisters expanded their educational offerings in 1920, and created Ursuline High School. It was housed within the academy building. Rapid expansion in enrollment led to the construction of a detached gymnasium south of the western end of the building in 1925.Porter and Scott, p. 60. The school began accepting boys in 1927. An annex was built against the gymnasium to permit boarding of male students. Classes were strictly segregated, as were the playground and yards. 1927 was also the year that the Ursuline Academy chapel was painted. The chapel is original to the building, and was blessed in 1912. The Stations of the Cross which hang on the walls were made in the 1890s, and the lectern originally used at St. Peter's Mission. Three large scenes, painted by Sister (later Mother) Raphael Schweda in 1927, hang behind the altar. Depicted are Saint Ursula leading a group of martyred virgins into heaven, and Saint Angela Merici (founder of the Ursuline order) surrounded by a group of young women. The third painting depicts a group of cherubs and angels. Female students at Ursuline Academy were used as models for the young women following Saint Ursula, and the faces of women in the paintings are recognizable as alumni of the school. There are also eight stained glass windows at the front and along the sides of the chapel, and the altar is flanked by statues of Joseph and Mary. For five decades, the room on the fifth floor in the tower was used as an art studio. Mother Raphael used it as her classroom, and only art students were permitted access. Since the classroom lacked water, Mother Raphael carried buckets of water up to the room each day. (Mother Raphael also painted backdrops for plays at the Great Falls Civic Center, and made vestments for Catholic priests in many area churches.) The Columbus Hospital School of Nursing opened in the city in 1898, and during World War II it greatly expanded its enrollment to meet wartime needs. Students in the nursing school slept in the Ursuline building with alongside the boarding school students. In 1950, Ursuline High School merged with two other Catholic high schools in the city to form Great Falls Central High School. This school opened on the northeast corner of the Ursuline property at 2400 Central Avenue.\\"Parochial High School.\\" Life. January 18, 1954, p. 63-64, accessed 2013-01-09; Small, p. 68-69. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Ursuline Academy also operated a candy store on its premises (with sweets manufactured by one of the sisters). Expansion of the Catholic educational system in the city of Great Falls in the 1950s and 1960s led to the creation of many more elementary and junior high schools with larger, modern facilities. Enrollment at Ursuline Academy dropped steadily, and the elementary school closed in 1966. The high school closed in 1973, and the Great Falls Public Schools purchased the building in 1975.The Catholic school system in the city of Great Falls did not have a high school after 1973 until Great Falls Central Catholic High School opened in the fall of 2001. The new GFCCHS was housed at the University of Great Falls until fall 2007, when it moved into its own building at 2800 18th Avenue South. See: Johnson, Peter. \\"Backers Offer Details of Proposed Great Falls Catholic High School.\\" Great Falls Tribune. February 3, 2000; Radcliffe, Rosanne. \\"Two New High Schools Open Their Doors.\\" Great Falls Tribune. July 30, 2000; Cates, Kristen. \\"Central Opens in New Facility.\\" Great Falls Tribune. September 4, 2007. With the impending loss of the high school, Ursuline Academy's days as an educational institution came to a close. The institution changed its name to Ursuline Centre in 1971.\\"Ursuline Centre a Great Falls Success Story.\\" Great Falls Tribune. September 19, 2012. The Ursuline sisters continued to live in the building (treating it as a retirement home), but the building changed its function. The sisters began renting the facility for meetings and retreats, using the dormitory space for guest sleeping quarters and the old school kitchens to provide food service.Merriam, Ginny. \\"Community Input Wanted for Possible Uses for Old Schools.\\" The Missoulian. July 28, 2002. To continue the educational function of the Ursulines, a portion of the building was rented out as a day care center.Wilmot, Paula. \\"Ursuline Centre Celebrates 90 Years.\\" Great Falls Tribune. September 7, 2002. In 1997, the Ursuline Centre Historical Foundation was formed as a nonprofit entity to accept grants on behalf of the Ursuline Centre, manage the building, and operate the retreat. The foundation also assists the religious order in maintaining the building. A capital campaign to make much-needed repairs on the building began in 1998, and by September 2002 had raised $1.3 million. Although the campaign's original goal was to eventually raise $1.5 million, rising costs led the campaign leaders to raise the goal to $2 million. The foundation initially repaired the roof and replaced the building's 501 windows. In 2006, the electrical and plumbing systems were upgraded. In 2010, the Ursulines entered into negotiations to transfer ownership of their building to the Ursuline Centre Historical Foundation. The Ursulines offered to sell the building outright to the foundation for $200,000, but the foundation declined. Although the foundation had the money to fund the purchase, the purchase would leave its funds nearly depleted—leaving nothing to continue making repairs. The building's exterior needed extensive conservation and maintenance work, and the fire-suppression system needed replacing. The foundation estimated this work would require $1 million. Although the sale fell through, the Ursulines agreed to give the foundation the right-of-first-refusal on any sale in the future. In addition, the Ursuline Order said it was eliminating its financial support of the retreat. To improve the center's financial viability, the Ursulines and foundation considered turning the former nuns' quarters (which were in excellent condition) into a retirement home for women, and finding more groups willing to use the busy retreat on weekdays.Ecke, Richard. \\"Ursuline Sisters to Pass the Torch.\\" Great Falls Tribune. October 21, 2010. At the time of the building's 100th anniversary in September 2012, more than $3 million had been spent to renovate and restore the structure. Replacement of the boiler and the electrical system had occurred, and work on the exterior was proceeding. Talks between the Ursulines and the foundation continued, in an attempt to reach agreement on a way to transfer ownership of the structure to the nonprofit. About the building The Ursuline Academy is a four-story building with a five-story central tower, and is constructed of stone and brick. The facade is trimmed with terra cotta with impressions of geometric forms. Stepped parapets exist on the main tower and wings. As originally constructed, the academy had of internal space. Eight gargoyles sit atop the central tower. According to the Great Falls Tribune in September 2012, they are thought to be the only working gargoyles in the entire state. The property on which the building sits is about 60 percent smaller than it originally was, due to the sale of the high school and its football field to the city in 1974. Icons throughout the building were painted by Mother Raphael Schweda. The chapel remains largely unaltered since its completion in 1927. Mother Raphael's fifth-floor classroom is now an art gallery featuring many of her works, which include portraits, religious images, and floral paintings. The building's Amadeus Library, named for Mother Amadeus, contains an extensive of collection of early- and mid-20th century books and musical instruments. It also houses the archives for the Pacific Northwest Chapter of the Ursuline order. The long second floor hallway is now known as the Heritage Gallery. Photographs of graduating classes, portraits of nuns and students, diplomas, and other memorabilia hang in this hallway. At the end of the hallway in a former girls' dormitory room is the Heritage Museum, which documents the history of the Ursulines in Montana and at Ursuline Academy. The museum also contains many Native American beadwork items and dresses donated to the Ursulines by tribes in Montana. Antique clocks, hand-carved chairs, and intricately detailed tables—many made by the sisters at St. Peter's Mission—are also housed in the museum. A painting of St. Peter's Mission by contemporary artist Ralph DeCamp also hangs in the room. Chimes, original to the building, also still exist on the second floor. Capable of being heard through the building, each sister had a different signal which could be played on the chimes to summon her to the central office. The chimes were also used to call the sisters to chapel, and for signalling the start and end of classes. The Ursuline Academy's meeting and retreat center can accommodate up to 100 people in dormitory rooms on the third and fourth floors. Space exists for multiple groups to use the facility at one time. The center also has a kitchen and kitchen staff of four. A 260-seat auditorium with stage exists on the second floor. As of 2011, the Ursuline Academy also was home to a preschool and day-care center. Other buildings on the site The Ursuline Sisters partnered with the Sisters of Providence in 1932 to establish Great Falls Junior College for Women (a two-year post-secondary school) adjacent to the Ursuline Academy.Porter and Scott, p. 52-53. The college was built on the northeast corner of the property. But the financial distress caused by the Great Depression caused the building to lie unfinished for decades. To accommodate the students, the college opened on September 8, 1932, in the Ursuline Academy.Small, p. 273.\\"University of Great Falls Reaches Pair of Milestones.\\" Great Falls Tribune. December 11, 2007. The college was diocesan, and not controlled by either religious order. The original enrollment was 14. It became a coeducational college in 1937 known as Great Falls Junior College. By 1950, it had moved out of Ursuline Academy and was holding classes in the Old Columbus Hospital building at 1601 2nd Avenue North. After a reorganization of the Ursulines in 1958, the sisters agreed that they could no longer support the college.Small, p. 317-318.The Sisters of Providence established Great Falls Normal School, a college of education, in 1938. The Normal School merged with the Junior College in 1942 to form the Great Falls College of Education. The institution became the College of Great Falls in the early 1950s. The Ursulines relinquished control of the junior college in 1960. The Sisters of Providence moved it to its present site between 20th and 23rd Streets South on 12th Street South. It is now known as the University of Great Falls. ReferencesBibliography *Aarstad, Rich; Arguimbau, Ellen; Baumler, Ellen; Porsild, Charlene L.; and Shovers, Brian.

This argues that thinking starts by selecting (explicitly or implicitly) a set of concepts (frames, patterns, lens, principles, etc.) gained from our past experiences. These are used to reflect on whatever happens, or is done, in the future.James, W. 1911/1996. Some Problems of Philosophy. University of Nebraska Press Nebraska. Concept-driven strategy therefore starts from agreeing and enacting a set of strategic concepts (organizing principles) that \\"works best\\" for an organisation. For example, a hospital might set its strategy as intending to be Caring, World Class, Local, Evidence Based, and Team Based. A University might set its strategy as intending to be Ranked, Problem Solving, Online, Equis, and Offering Pathways. A commercial corporation might set its strategy as intending to be Innovative, Global, Have Visible Supply Chains, Agile and Market Share Dominant. These strategic concepts make up its Statement of Intent (or Purpose). Background Much of the strategic management literature mutates Peter Drucker's call for corporations to start the strategic management process by producing a statement of purpose, mission and objectives. This has been mutated into a call to start with a vision, mission and objectives statement. There is an alternative approach which focuses on the Statement of Purpose or Intent. Drucker's example for this statement for a commercial corporation was to state that the corporation's purpose was to create customers. That is, it was going to use the concept of 'customer creation' to coordinate and organise the cognition or mindset of those that worked for the organisation. This was why the corporation existed. Having one concept is now thought to be insufficient. George Armitage Miller's modified The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two and dialectic suggests a handful of concepts under tension would be preferable. The Statement of Purpose, Statement of Intent or concept-driven approach to strategy formulation therefore focuses on setting and enacting a set strategic concepts. If a participatory approach is being used these concepts will be acquired through a process of collaboration with stakeholders. Once agreed the strategic concepts can be used to coordinate activities and act as a set of decision making criteria. The set of concepts that make up the Statement of Intent is then used to make sense of an unpredictable future across an organisation in a co-ordinated manner.Metcalfe M. A Pragmatic System of Decision Criteria Systems Research and Behavioral Science 2012 Underlying philosophy Linguistic pragmatism argues that our prior conceptions interpret our perception (sensory inputs). These conceptions are represented by concepts like running, smiling, justice, reasoning and agility. They are patterns of activity, experienced in our past and remembered. They can be named by those with language and so shared.Rorty, R. 1982. Consequences of Pragmatism. University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis.Schon, D.A. 1963. Displacement of Concepts.

Another example would be that we can think of the war in Iraqi differently by reflecting off the concepts of oil security, Imperialism, aggressive capitalism, liberation or democracy. The concept-driven approach to strategy formulation involves setting and using a set of linguistic pragmatic concepts.Metcalfe M Pragmatic inquiry Journal of the Operational Research Society (2008) 59  Method  The steps to formulating a participatory concept-driven strategy are: # Select who the strategy is for exactly, and what exactly is their problem. # Reflect on significant events in the past that have impacted on the organisation (past experience matters) # Identify all stakeholders including suppliers, competitors, staff, alliances, government, environmentalist, industry experts, etc. # Ask them what concerns they have for the future relevant to your organisation. Use their experiences and expertise from being involved in the industry. # Use idea networking to cluster these stakeholder concern statements into about five clusters # Name these clusters as strategic concepts (priorities, organizing principles). For example, one cluster of statements might be about innovation, another about becoming more international. # Reflect on the possible paradoxical consequences of enacting these strategic concepts # Draft a one-page 'Statement of Intent' which says the organisation intends to become more like the five or so strategic concepts. # Draft implementation action plans for each strategic concept. These should be both organisational change actions and investment projects, with goals and milestones. # Communicate the 'Statement of Intent' and 'Action Plans' to stakeholders as appropriate. # Get senior staffs' comments, performance measures, selection criteria and decision criteria to reflect the 'Statement of Intent'. # In the longer term, reflect on the strategic concepts in the Statement of Intent.Blog on Concept Driven Strategy http://mudmap.wordpress.com/tag/concept-driven-strategy/ Other terminology Concept-driven strategy is the name given to a number of similar strategic thinking approaches. Generally, the term 'concept-driven' is used to encourage a focus on the 'concepts' being used.Mareschal, D., P. Quinn, S. Lea. 2010. The Making of Human Concepts. Oxford University Press, Oxford.Shaw, M.L.G., B.R. Gaines. 1989. Comparing Conceptual Structures: Consensus, Conflict, Correspondence and Contrast. Knowledge Acquisition 1 341-363. See Concept learning or Management Concepts.Management Concepts Wikibooks http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Management_Concepts_and_Applications/Management Some organisations produce a 'statement of intent' with little thought as to the concepts it contains.Hamel, G., C.K. Prahalad. 2005. Strategic Intent. Harvard Business Review 83(7/8) 148-161.Katada, T. 1994. Strategic Intent to Corporate Purpose: The Remaking of Komatsu. Harvard Business Review 72(6) 83-.Katada, T. 1994. Strategic Intent to Corporate Purpose: The Remaking of Komatsu. Harvard Business Review 72(6) 83-. However, if it is a short list of concepts, high level objectives, principles, priorities or frames, then concept-driven strategy offers a philosophical basis for these statements. Some organisations produce a 'strategic principles'How to Turn a Great Strategic Principle into Great Results http://www.strategydriven.com/2011/06/27/how-to-turn-a-great-strategic- principle-into-great-results/ statement which again is similar to a statement of intent and the same applies about the concepts approach offering a philosophical basis. The term 'strategic priorities' or 'strategic values' are often used in the same way as strategic principles. The literature about 'corporate purpose'Basu, S. 1999. Corporate Purpose: Why it Matters More than Strategy. Garland Publishing, Inc, New York & London.Ellsworth, R., R. 2002. Leading with Purpose. Stanford University Press, California. is also similar to that of strategic intent. Sometimes, purpose refers to present actions and intent to future ones. If purpose is expressed as a set of concepts, then the concepts approach again provides some philosophical basis. There is a connection between 'systems thinking' and concept-driven strategy. The Churchman/Ackoff stream of systems thinking was interested in a developing generic system of concepts for thinking about problems. Rather than a generic set of concepts, the concept-driven approach uses whatever concepts stakeholders think work best for the future of their organisation. There is a military planning approach called 'concept-led'.The Role of OR and Analysis in Concept-led Long Range Planning http://www.dsto.defence.gov.au/publications/2535/DSTO-CR-0282.pdfOn the implementation of 'Concept-led and Participative' planning in the development of the Defence Logistics Transformation Plan http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/4367990The Headline Experiment a concept- led team effort http://adamdonovan.net/pdf/adam%20defence%20mag.pdf The military-like leadership seems to have moved the concepts from being drivers to be leaders. There seems to be very little difference otherwise. In turbulent environments, concepts are thought 'more flexible than objectives' (goals, targets) as they provide why certain actions are preferable. The purpose and intent literature likes to distinguish itself from the objectives literature by saying purpose and intent provide the reasons for (why change), the driver for change. Objectives are where you end up. In complex dynamic situations, there may be many acceptable end points, many of which cannot be anticipated by planners. Arguably the only objective is to survive. How is explained in the statement of intent. Perhaps strangely, there is a connection between 'metaphor', metaphoric criticism, or conceptual metaphor and concept- driven strategy. Pragmatic concepts are not images but most concepts relate to metaphors. For example, to say an organisation is like a machine, with cogs, or like an adaptive organism, is to use the concepts of machine and organism to reflect on organisations. Much of what has been written about the usefulness of metaphors in planning applies to concepts.Schon, D.A. 1963. Displacement of Concepts. Tavistock Publications, London. The term 'strategic frames' is not common given the extensive literature on frame analysis but frames and pragmatic concepts seem to be very similar. Amos Tversky defines a frame as a conception of outcomes. The system of strategic concepts listed in a statement of intent, purpose, principles, frames or conceptual metaphor are organizing principle(s).Vnuk-Balan, E. 2010. Concept Driven Strategy, American Academy of Management Conference, Toronto. Also, as Karl Weick explains sensemaking as the process of conceptualising problems, concept-driven strategy might be thought of as a pragmatic means of sensemaking a strategy.

It is one of the most popular attractions for tourists visiting Okanagan Valley. Apex Trail is a 4.0 kilometre, lightly trafficked out-and-back trail, best used from May till September The park is made up of of forest and grassland and contains a variety of wildlife, such as deer, birds, an occasional grizzly bear and Kokanee salmon that spawn along the lakeshore adjacent to the park. There are 10 trails in the park of varying length and difficulty, providing views of both Kelowna and Okanagan lake There are two lookout points, including the mountain's summit, which can be reached by car, making the mountain a picnicking location, as well as popular hiking and running destination. The mountains trails are also commonly utilized by mountain bikers. The park is open 9:30am to 9:00pm during most of the year. According to the City of Kelowna web site, Knox Mountain Park is considered among the most important and well-known natural area parks in Kelowna. Lake Okanagan from Knox Mountain Park History Knox Mountain Park was named after the notorious Arthur Booth Knox, a resident of Kelowna from the late 19th century. Knox, a rancher, was convicted of setting fire to several haystacks belonging to his competition and sentenced to three years of hard labour. In his book Buckaroos And Mud Pups: The Early Days of Ranching in British Columbia, Ken Mather explains that a cowboy working for Knox provided the testimony that resulted in his conviction, despite evidence that he was bribed to give a false testimony. Following his 3-year sentence, Knox returned to Kelowna and continued to grow his ranching property. The portion of his property that encompassed Knox Mountain was sold to the Okanagan Fruit and Land Co. in 1906. In 1999, a group of Kelowna residents formed a society called the Friends of Knox Mountain Park to advocate for and to promote stewardship of the park. Each year the park becomes the site of the Knox Mountain Hillclimb car race, which has been run on a steep course in the park for over 60 years, making it the longest annually running paved hill climb in North America. Flora and fauna Knox Mountain Park contains several representative Okanagan ecosystems as it transitions from lakeshore to mountain top. These include riparian, wetland, Ponderosa Pine Bunch Grass, and dry Interior Douglas-fir. These ecosystems are fragile, dry and highly susceptible to erosion and degradation; therefore park visitors are encouraged to stay on designated trails. Knox Mountain Park is home to Kelowna's official flower, the Arrowleaf Balsamroot or Okanagan Sunflower (Balsamorhiza sagittata). The bright yellow flowers carpet the south facing park slopes in late April or early May. First Nations used nearly all parts of this plant for food by steaming the roots and eating the young shoots and seeds. Commonly encountered wildlife species include mammals such as mule deer, coyotes, marmots, chipmunks and occasionally moose and bear. Kelowna. Knox Mountain Park.

The series is produced by Breakthrough Entertainment in association with Hornet Films and Atomic Cartoons. It also ran on Nickelodeon and Nicktoons in the United States in its first run for its first season, before the second and third season aired delayed from its Canadian run on KidsClick, a daily syndication block aired on the television stations of Sinclair Broadcast Group. 65 episodes were produced. Plot Brothers Gus and Wally are monkey astronauts. They're not the brightest or coolest astronauts, but since they're the only ones around, they are called upon to go into space and carry out different kinds of important missions—including battling rogue black holes and vengeful aliens. Other members of the brothers' crew include bossy astrophysicist Dr. Chimpsky, who gives the monkeys their assignments; YAY-OK, a devoted robot that is slightly outdated and is the brothers' only hope to help keep them on course; and Inky, a space octopus and artist who communicates through his ink drawings. Characters * Gus Monkey (voiced by Seán Cullen) is Wally's older brother. He wants nothing more than to be a hero, but he can't always put aside his monkey instincts. The closest thing the ship has to a captain, he takes being a GASI cadet very seriously—well, when he feels like it.http://www.teletoon.com/en/tv/rocketMonkeys * Wally Monkey (voiced by Joseph Motiki) is Gus' monkey partner and brother, and is considered the smarter of the two. However Poorly-groomed yet somehow adorable, Wally would rather be playing Banana Blasters or organizing his expired pudding collection than jetting off on some crazy expedition. If there's one thing Wally's good at, it's being a monkey—he can howl and fling with the best of them. * Yay-OK (voiced by David Berni) is Wally and Gus' obsolete robot companion that helps them on their adventures through space. There's nothing this robot wouldn't do for his beloved monkeys—after all, he's programmed that way. He's quite the charmer, too—from the fridge to the blender to the vending machine, there isn't a ladybot on board whose circuits he hasn't made beep a little faster. * Dr. Chimpsky (voiced by Jamie Watson) is the leader of GASI headquarters. He assigns the Monkeys their highly important missions (which sometimes include getting him more ice when his drink gets too warm) and does his best to keep them on track when they get distracted. * Inky is a space octopus and an artist who communicates through his incredible ink drawings. Whether he's a member of the crew or just unbearably cute, is anybody's guess. But either way, his artistic talents make him super fun to have around. * Lord Peel (voiced by Mark McKinney) is the main antagonist of the series, whom the monkeys constantly mistake for a banana. Before the events of the series, he was a noble businessman. But then the Rocket Monkeys began to crave him, and he's been trying to get revenge on them for trying to eat him and especially for forcing him into the dark side. * Nefarious (voiced by Seán Cullen) is one of the antagonists of the series. He lives in a prison asteroid, which he tries to escape in most episodes. * SLO-MO (voiced by Teresa Pavlinek) is Nefarious’ robot companion. In some episodes, she cares about YAY-OK a lot. * Deep Space Dave (also voiced by Seán Cullen) is a superhero who always relies on his fans- the monkeys, of course. EpisodesBroadcast Rocket Monkeys has been broadcast in Canada on its original channel, Teletoon, since January 10, 2013. Due to a tangle of rights between Nickelodeon, KidsClick and Teletoon, the series is only available for digital per-episode purchase in Canada, and cannot be purchased in the United States in that manner. On February 21, 2013, Nickelodeon announced that they have acquired the global rights to the series including the United States, though its history on that network was marked with several shifts. It premiered on March 4, 2013, but then shifted over to sister network Nicktoons due to low ratings and waning promotion on Nickelodeon, before that network dropped entirely it in May 2014, leaving it off American airwaves for just over three years. The second season finally debuted in the United States on July 3, 2017 as part of the over-the- air KidsClick syndicated children's block and has aired continuously since then. In the United Kingdom, it debuted on Nicktoons in 2013 and ended sometime in 2017, but reruns have been airing from December 2017 to 28 January 2018, and it is currently airing on January 29, 2018 on CITV.

Vogel undertook clearing work and fenced several hundred hectares at Granville Harbour. This was used for cattle grazing, and some crop attempts. \\"Crops of wheat and clover on Tasmania's bleak West Coast are hard to envisage, yet they are to be seen. ACCORDING to reports, Mr. A.Vogel has leased more than 100,000 acres between Zeehan and Corinna with the idea of developing all aspects of mixed farming on a scientific basis. Strips of the button grass plain have been gone over with a rotary hoe and the seed broadcast on the untreated virgin soil. Despite several frosts, both the wheat and the clover appear to be flourishing\\". In the early days, cattle were taken to Granville for fattening from parts of the North-West Coast, crossing the Pieman at Corinna. Once fattened, they were driven overland to mining fields at Zeehan and Queenstown Vogel eventually went broke, and the land he developed was acquired eventually by George Smith of Zeehan (originally a piner on the Gordon River, and afterwards a businessman) who kept it going as a grazing property. His grandson Royce Smith currently runs the property. It is now the site of a $280 million wind farm development will comprise 31 turbines with a 112 megawatt capacity. Initial construction works began in August 2018 and the wind farm is expected to generate its first electricity in late 2019. The farm produces some of Australia's highest quality grass fed beef, sustaining up to 1850 head of premium beef cattle. Production of prime beef will continue at the site during the wind farm's construction and operations – effectively diversifying the owner's long-term farming interests.

The Quetta bombings led to protests by the city's Shia Muslim Hazara community; Prime Minister of Pakistan Raja Pervez Ashraf responded by dismissing the Chief Minister of Balochistan, Aslam Raisani, and replacing him with Zulfikar Ali Magsi. On the same day, a bomb exploded in Swat District, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, killing 22 people and injuring 60 others. Background Since the government's seizure of Lal Masjid in the national capital of Islamabad, there has been a growing insurgency by the Islamist Pakistani Taliban and others, especially in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, bordering and resultant from Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Additionally, the insurgency in Balochistan, predominantly by the Balochistan Liberation Army, had been ongoing prior to this period; while there has also been deadly sectarianism in Pakistan. Bombings=Quetta= Three bombs exploded in the city of Quetta, one early in the day and two in the evening. The first bomb, which went off in the city's commercial district near a public plaza and crowded food markets, killed twelve people and injured 47; a Baloch separatist group, the United Baloch Army, claimed responsibility. Police official Hamid Shakil said that \\"Frontier Corps personnel were the target because the bomb was planted underneath their vehicle,\\" though mostly civilians were killed. The deadliest attack came later in the day, when a suicide bomber blew himself up inside a snooker hall at about 8:50 pm, followed about ten minutes later by a car bombing outside the building after police and media personnel had arrived at the scene. 130 people were killed in the two bombings, with at least 270 more injured. At least three more died at hospitals after the bombings, bringing the total death toll to 110. By mid-day on 11 January, the death toll had risen to 112, and by the end of 13 January it had reached 126. In addition to those at the hall at the time of the first bombing, nine policemen, 25 rescue workers and three journalists who had arrived at the scene were killed in the second blast. According to local bomb disposal officials, the suicide bomb had up to of explosives, while the car bomb had about . The hall was completely destroyed, and surrounding buildings were damaged in the blasts, which also destroyed power lines, causing blackouts in the surrounding area. Lashkar-e- Jhangvi, a Sunni Deobandi militant group, claimed responsibility for this attack. A government official said that the bombings were likely Lashkar-e- Jhangvi's retaliation for the shooting of a Sunni cleric and the capture of weapons from a site believed to be controlled by the group, both of which had occurred the day before. The Balochistan provincial government said that it would pay two million rupees to the family of each policeman killed, while families of the others killed would receive one million rupees. Three days of mourning were announced for Balochistan in response to the bombings. Journalists killed in the attack The bombing was responsible for the first deaths of journalists in Pakistan in 2013. Pakistan has ranked among the deadliest of countries for journalists over the past several years, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Three journalists were killed and at least two other journalists were seriously injured by the second blast in Quetta. Two were from SAMAA TV: Imran Sheikh had been a camera operator for five years and the third camera operator for the channel who was killed while covering a bombing incident; and Saifur Rehman was a reporter. Also killed in the attack was Iqbal Hussain, who was a journalist from the news agency News Network International. Rehman died later at a hospital from his injuries, while the other two died on site. At least two other journalists suffered from more than minor injuries, including Jameel Ahmed, the engineer for Samaa TV, and Mohammad Hasan, a photojournalist for Independent News Pakistan. =Swat Valley= On 10 January 2013, an explosion in a Tableeghi Jamaat seminary in the Swat Valley, outside of Saidu Sharif, killed 30 people, with 70 injured. The explosion was initially reported to be the result of a gas leak in the building's basement, but police and medical officials said it had likely been a bomb—doctors said that victims had been injured by ball bearings, often used in bombs, and according to a senior doctor there was a \\"smell of explosives\\". Reactions Protests in Quetta by the city's Shia community erupted the day after the bombings, with protesters and local Shia officials refusing to bury those killed until the Pakistani army took control of security in the city. Protests also broke out over the weekend of 12–13 January in Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar, Islamabad and ten other smaller cities around the country. On 13 January, Prime Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf visited protesters in Quetta and agreed to dismiss provincial government officials, though he refused to implement military control in the city. Early on 14 January, he announced that Balochistan Chief Minister Aslam Raisani and his cabinet had been removed from their posts, with Zulfikar Ali Magsi appointed to lead the provincial government. In response, Quetta Shias agreed to end their protests and begin burials later in the day.

He was born into a military family, and demonstrated an early interest in zoology by collecting local wildlife around his father's army posts. He graduated from Brown University in 1897, and continued his studies at George Washington University while working part-time at the United States National Museum (USNM). At the same time, he taught at Howard University Medical School and later George Washington University Medical School. He received his Ph.D. from George Washington University in 1913. In 1919, he and his wife, Martha, moved to South Bend, Indiana to join a newly opened clinic. Prior to moving, Lyon had published many papers on mammalogy, both during and after his tenure at the USNM. In these papers, he had formally described six species, three genera, and one family. Once in South Bend, he began to publish medical studies, too, but continued his work in mammalogy, with a particular focus on the local fauna of Indiana. He published more than 160 papers during his career. Lyon acquired the rank of major in the Medical Reserve Corps during World War I, and was appointed president of the American Society of Mammalogists from 1931 to 1932. He was a member of Sigma Xi, the Society of American Bacteriologists, the Indiana Academy of Science, and the Biological Society of Washington. Lyon became a conservationist later in life. Early life and education Lyon was born on February 5, 1875, in Rock Island Arsenal, Illinois. His family included his father, Captain Marcus Ward Lyon Sr.; his mother, Lydia Anna Lyon; and his two brothers, Henry S. Lyon and James W. Lyon. Because of his father's military career, Lyon's family moved across the United States throughout his childhood and adolescence. The first hint of the young Lyon's future scientific interests came while they were stationed at Watertown Arsenal, near Boston, Massachusetts, where he began collecting insects and animals from the local area. No other details of his early life were documented until 1893, when he graduated from Rock Island High School—his father had evidently been re-stationed at Rock Island Arsenal at about this time. He attended Brown University and completed his Ph.B. in 1897, which included training in biology. In 1898, he began his graduate studies at George Washington University, obtaining his M.S. in 1900, his M.D. in 1902, and his Ph.D. in 1913. Career taxonomic authority for the family Ptilocercidae (pen-tailed treeshrews) and other mammalian taxa. Upon completion of his first degree, Lyon spent a year (1897–1898) at North Carolina Medical College, where he taught bacteriology. In conjunction with his graduate studies, he moved to Washington, D.C., in 1898 to become a part-time Aid in the Division of Mammals at the United States National Museum (USNM). Lyon was later promoted to Assistant Curator for Mammals. The USNM sent him to Venezuela with Lieutenant Wirt Robinson of the United States Army in 1899 to collect mammal specimens, and later appointed him as its Chief Special Agent for the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis and the 1905 Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition in Portland, Oregon. He retained his post at the USNM until 1912. Lyon taught physiology (1903–04 and 1907–09) and bacteriology (1909–15) at Howard University Medical School. In the latter half of 1915, Lyon began teaching at George Washington University Medical School, handling courses in bacteriology and pathology until 1917, and veterinary zoology and parasitology from 1917 until 1918. In 1917, he joined the U.S. Army, serving as a pathologist at the Walter Reed Army Hospital during World War I. In September 1919, he transferred to the Medical Reserve Corps as a major. By the end of that year, Lyon's 18 years of medical teaching and practice resulted in a job offer in pathology at the South Bend Clinic in South Bend, Indiana. His wife, Martha, was also extended a job offer at the same clinic, and joined as an ophthalmologist. Lyon maintained his offices at the clinic until his death in 1942. Because of his work as a mammalogist, Lyon is considered the taxonomic authority for the family Ptilocercidae (pen-tailed treeshrews), as well as the genus Anathana (the Madras treeshrew) and two genera of leporids (rabbits and hares), Pentalagus (the Amami rabbit) and Pronolagus (red rock hares). Lyon was the first to describe the Bornean white-bearded gibbon (Hylobates albibarbis), the Gansu pika (Ochotona cansus), the Sumatran porcupine (Hystrix sumatrae), the shadowy broad-nosed bat (Platyrrhinus umbratus), and two species of slow loris from Borneo, Nycticebus bancanus and Nycticebus borneanus. His private zoological collections were incorporated into the collections at the USNM. Lyon created two herbariums, the first containing plant specimens from Oregon and the second from the Indiana Dunes and lower Michigan. The former was included in the United States National Herbarium, now the United States Botanic Garden, and the latter at the University of Michigan Herbarium. Publications During his career, Lyon published more than 160 papers, roughly 80 of which were in the field of zoology and 55 more in pathology. Other publications included four articles in botany, numerous book reviews, technical reports, and newspaper articles. Until the move to Indiana, Lyon wrote many papers in mammalogy, focusing primarily on morphology, systematics, and zoogeography. In addition to his Ph.D. thesis, entitled \\"Treeshrews: An account of the mammalian family Tupaiidae\\", he authored papers about other mammals of the Far East, with which he had become very familiar through his study of the collections that were sent to the USNM. Following the end of his relationship with the USNM in 1912, Lyon continued to write mammalogy material and began publishing basic medical studies. After moving to Indiana, the focus of his publications shifted primarily to medical issues and mammalogy within his new home state. Despite his interest in and occupation with medical science, his passion was for the study of living and extinct mammals. He became a regular contributor to the American Midland Naturalist, publishing a list of plant species native to the Indiana Dunes and notes on ground squirrels and badgers prior to his work \\"Mammals of Indiana\\", which spanned all 365 pages of the first issue in 1936. In 1935, he had been invited to join the editorial staff, becoming an associate editor for mammalogy. Near the end of his life, Lyon began to write about wildlife conservation. A private collection of Lyon's papers, along with those of his wife, is held at the University of Notre Dame Archives. It comprises correspondence, papers, notes, manuscripts, letters, articles, and speeches, as well as articles collected by Lyon and a scrapbook of his wife's college life and more. =Selected publications=     Honors Lyon held honorary memberships in Phi Beta Kappa and Sigma Xi. A member of the organization committee that founded the District of Columbia Chapter of Sigma Xi in 1914, Lyon became the Secretary of both the Organization Committee and Chapter, which held its first annual meeting in 1915. He was appointed secretary of the Biological Society of Washington in 1904 and from 1915 through 1919. In 1917, he was elected for membership to the Washington Biologists' Field Club. Lyon was president of the St. Joseph County Medical Society in 1931, as well as the treasurer (1927–1932) and president (1933) of the Indiana Academy of Science. He was also a member of the Society of American Bacteriologists. Lyon was the 7th president of the American Society of Mammalogists from 1931 to 1932, and received honorary membership a month before he died. Personal life Lyon was buried at Arlington National Cemetery. Lyon married Martha Marie Brewer ( 1871) of Lanham, Maryland, in 1902, and together they had one daughter, Charlotte Lyon. Lyon and his wife attended scientific meetings together; in 1911, they traveled to Europe to see museums and to visit famous zoologists. Martha Brewer Lyon obtained her M.S. at Columbian College in 1901 and M.D. from Brown University in 1907. She later worked as an ophthalmologist at the South Bend Clinic with her husband until she opened her own office in 1931. She maintained her office until her death on January 18, 1942. Lyon died on May 19, 1942, at his home in South Bend and was buried on May 27 at Arlington National Cemetery. While living in South Bend, Lyon became close friends with Reverend Julius A. Nieuwland, CSC, a botanist and chemist at the University of Notre Dame. They went on field trips and collected plant specimens that were incorporated into Lyon's second herbarium, which he made in his spare time with the help of his wife, Nieuwland, and Austrian botanist Theodor Just. Lyon was known for his love of nature, and in an obituary written by Just, he was noted as being an \\"ardent conservationist\\" later in his life. Lyon criticized poorly managed conservation programs in his paper \\"Conservation from the Naturalist's Point of View\\" (1939), and in his final paper, \\"The Kankakee Area—Its Past and Present\\", he envisioned life around the Kankakee Outwash Plain before human activities had changed it. Lyon also gave up his cottage in the Indiana Dunes after the wildlife refuge was converted into a vacation destination.

The property was later restored and featured on The Restoration Man series. Baynards Park is a estate and site of a demolished country house with extant outbuildings, privately owned, in the south of the parishes of Cranleigh and Ewhurst, Surrey. History In 1447 William Sydney the younger obtained a licence to impark (i.e. enclose) appertaining to his 'manor' of Baynards, however its exact status at that time is dubious, being possibly still held as an under- tenant of Pollingfold Manor to the south-west. His granddaughter, as heir of this part of these larger estates, married William Uvedale, who inherited, the estate passing, after a period of profit-sharing to his several heirs, to the Bray family including, soon after by an intra-family deal, Sir Edward Bray. In this early Tudor period the modest manor very occasionally hosted hunting parties to King Henry VIII being in the then intact, and now partially remaining Weald, an expansive woodland. Bray mortgaged the property to John Reade of Sterborough who transferred this debt to Sir George More of Loseley. As the wealth of the elite grew but before the heyday of the British Empire, the Elizabethan architecture manor house was built by More, on taking possession in 1587, using his wife, Constantia's money. His heirs exchanged this with Witley whose main manor belonged to Sir Francis Woolley of Pirford (now Pyrford), his nephew. Three quick sales ensured (1607-1609) to Edward Bayninge, Isaac Woder and Robert Jossey. The estate was then, due to the foreclosure of Jossey's son's mortgage, sold by Richard Gurney, to John Evelyn's father in 1631. It was then still as a gentleman's main residence. However the house descended through Evelyn's heirs, becoming a farm-house by the time of being owned by one, Arthur Onslow, the noted Speaker (of the House of Commons), who while in possession resided at Knowle Manor, Cranleigh, and whose son and later heirs made their principal homes at Imber Court, East Molesey (demolished and subdivided) and at Clandon Park, Clandon (intact). In 1818 the then-Lord Onslow sold Pollingfold and Baynards to John Smallpeice of Guildford. He may have used the house in his capacity as the last Out-Ranger of Windsor Forest, which even then was deemed to extend as far as Guildford. In 1824 Pollingfold was sold to Richard Gates. However in 1832 the twin, neighbouring estates were reunited by the Rev. Thomas Thurlow, son of another Thomas, Bishop of Durham and nephew to the Lord Chancellor Thurlow, by a bold purchase. He extended and remodelled the house, under the direction of Sir Matthew Digby Wyatt, and made a fine collection of paintings, armour, furniture and tapestry, which remained until at least 1911 in the house. Baynards, by then a proper adjoining small hamlet, saw a return to its grand house, transformed at the time in a somewhat old-fashioned but majestic, classical Georgian style 1832-40 primarily by employing Thomas Rickman and Benjamin Ferrey under Wyatt. In the 1860s the LBSCR set out to develop the Cranleigh Line. As the branch line would cross outskirts of this estate, as a condition of sale the then Lord Thurlow (the 5th Baron), insisted on having a station built to serve his estate, despite there being no nearby settlement. Baynards railway station opened on 2 October 1865, covering , providing a stationmaster's house, two waiting rooms, covered platforms, storesheds, a booking hall, a porch and a large goods shed. The station also served as the local Post Office, and would have up to 30 horses and carts outside on market days. The line closed on 14 June 1965, four months before its centenary, the only Surrey railway closure under The Reshaping of British Railways. In 1952, to pay the death duties of his father, Henry Charles Hovell-Thurlow-Cumming- Bruce, 7th Baron Thurlow sold the estate, possibly to Henry Lyons (created Lord Ennisdale), who died in 1963. With the house Grade II listed in 1960, it was then bought in 1965 by helicopter entrepreneur Alan Bristow for over £300,000. In 1979, the house, which had been unoccupied for 11 years and was being used as a barn to store hay, burnt down in suspicious circumstances, after planning permission had been refused for alterations submitted earlier that year. After clearance of the manor house site, today only the walled gardens, cottages, bell-tower, gatehouse and four lodges survive, many somewhat neglected. After the death of Bristow in 2009, the estate was bought by a property development company. Denied permission to develop the estate for private housing, they sold it to a retirement home operator, who intend to rebuild a replica manor house on the original foundations. Longhurst Lodge was purchased privately in 2009 and restored. Architecture (before demolition of main structure) The house was mainly of brick, but the foundations were (and are) of Sussex marble and the roof of Horsham slates, both found in the area.

The Committee was chaired by Australian architect Sir John Sulman, and advised the Minister of Home Affairs on the Construction of Canberra and conducted a review of the Griffin Plan. The Committee proposed that development should take place in three stages: * Stage one, which was to take three years, would see the transfer of Parliament and key administrative staff moved from Melbourne to Canberra. * Stage two, also to take three years, would include the construction of railways in addition to other key buildings * Stage three would create character and permanence in the capital. The Committee was largely unsuccessful in achieving its aims, for example Parliament did not move to Canberra until 1927, and no permanent rail connection between Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne was ever completed. However Sulman was instrumental in developing the garden city aspects of Canberra, he declared that the development of Canberra should take the form of ‘a garden town, with simple, pleasing, but unpretentious buildings’. In 1924 the Committee was abolished due to the slow pace of development, it was replaced by the more successful Federal Capital Commission in 1925.  1925–1930: Federal Capital Commission (FCC)  The FCC was formed to construct and administer Canberra from 1 January 1925. The Chief Commissioner of the body was Sir John Butters. The FCC was to prepare Canberra for the arrival of 1,100 civil servants and their families. During the first 2 years of FCC operation Parliament House, The Lodge, the Albert Hall, the Institute of Anatomy, and the Australian School of Forestry and an Observatory on Mount Stromlo were completed. The FCC also oversaw construction of the Sydney and Melbourne commercial buildings in the City and significant residential development. The FCC was disbanded on 1 May 1930 following the start of the Great Depression in 1929. Development after this point was not centrally planned until the establishment of the National Capital Planning and Development Committee in 1938. = Federal Capital Architectural Style = House in Griffith built by the Commission in the 1920s Federal Capital Commission architects designed houses in the new city and public buildings using a mixture of elements from the Arts and Crafts movement, Mediterranean and Georgian styles. The result is known as the FCC style and is unique to Canberra. FCC style houses can be found in the suburbs of Barton, Braddon, Forrest and Reid. Sir John Sulman began the development of Federal Capital Architecture. Before emigrating to Australia in 1885, he had been a friend of William Morris and active in the Arts and Crafts movement. Other than Sulman's leadership, the influences on the architects employed by the Federal Capital Authority and Commission were reflecting the thinking after the peak of the nationalistic Australian Federation style and looking to America for inspiration and seeking to practically respond to the Australian climate. By the time Canberra was being built, the popularity of the uniquely Australian Federation style architecture was waning. The architect William Hardy Wilson led the reaction against the ornateness of the Federation style and advocated adopting approaches from the United States. When Leslie Wilkinson arrived in Australia in 1918 to take up his position as the first Professor of Architecture at an Australian university, he reinforced Wilson's view and advocated building appropriately for the climate, suggesting the Spanish Mission style of architecture in California and Mexico as being an appropriate style for Australia. When Walter Burley Griffin arrived in 1913, there was interest in the Prairie Style of mid-western America with which Griffin was associated. The Classical revival style was popular in America, reflected in Beaux-Arts architecture. There was also interest in Classicism by English architects, including Edwin Lutyens, who was responsible for many of the public buildings in New Delhi built from 1912 to 1929 in the wake of the decision to replace Calcutta as the seat of the British Indian government.

The NCPDC was to advise the Minister of the Interior to safeguard the Griffin plan and maintain high aesthetic and architectural standards worthy of a National Capital. The Committee had no executive power, and was unable to direct development of the Capital. Dissatisfied with progress, the government established a Senate Select Committee in 1954 to inquire into Canberra's development. In 1958 it was replaced by the well funded and authoritative National Capital Development Commission.  1958–1989: National Capital Development Commission (NCDC)  The NCDC was created to complete the establishment of Canberra as the seat of government. It was created in 1957 through the National Capital Development Commission Act 1957. Under the control of the NCDC Canberra grew from a population of 40,000 to 300,000. The NCDC was responsible for the development of Canberra's satellite cities; Woden Valley, Belconnen, Tuggeranong and Gungahlin. The NCDC also oversaw construction of Lake Burley Griffin and New Parliament House. The NCDC had four Commissioners: * Sir John Overall, Commissioner, 1958–1972 * W.C. Andrews, Commissioner, 1972–1974 * Tony Powell, Commissioner, 1974–1985 * Malcolm Latham, Commissioner, 1985–1989 The NCDC was advised by the National Capital Planning Committee which was chaired by the NCDC Commissioner and composed of six nominated representatives of the Royal Australian Institute of Architects, the Institution of Engineers, Australia and the Royal Australian Planning Institute plus two other members with special knowledge and experience in cultural matters. The NCDC was abolished after the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988, and most of its functions passed to the new ACT government and the National Capital Authority.  1989–Present: National Capital Authority (NCA)  The National Capital Authority was established in 1989 when the Australian Capital Territory was granted self- government. The Authority consists of a Chairman and four other members, all members are appointed by the Governor-General. Under the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act 1988, the NCA has the authority to prepare and administer a National Capital Plan.

Career Kennedy learned to play drums at a young age. Before co-founding the British three piece soul, pop and funk band Imagination with Ashley Ingram and Leee John in London, in early 1981, he was a member in two other soul-funk bands, Midnight Express and TFB (Typical Funk Band). Imagination's first UK hit single, \\"Body Talk\\", produced by Jolley & Swain, spent 18 weeks in the UK Singles Chart and reached number 4 in May 1981. This was quickly followed by two other chart topping singles, \\"In and Out of Love\\" and \\"Flashback\\", both co-written by Kennedy. Their biggest hit, \\"Just an Illusion\\", peaked at number two in March 1982. The trio frequently appeared on Top of the Pops and other pop music programmes. After the break-up of Imagination, Kennedy continued both as a musician and producer. He worked with Hugh Masekela at Bray Film Studios to produce the soundtrack for the movie Soweto, and during the 1990s either toured or produced with bands such as Odyssey, Shalamar, Rose Royce, Grace Kennedy, Jamiroquai, Frankie Knuckles, Larry Levan, Arthur Baker, Colonel Abrams and Simon Ellis. Since 2009, Kennedy has been performing live on stage with his band ImagiNation feat. Errol Kennedy. They toured the UK in 2010–2011, followed by a performance at London's IndigO2 alongside the Three Degrees and Linda Lewis, as well as various events and festivals across Germany in 2012. Kennedy released Imagination's official 30th. anniversary single \\"Just An Illusion\\" (featuring T'Mar) on M&R; Records in May 2013, which is a re- production of Imagination's biggest hit. The single was taken from the forthcoming anniversary album, New Dimension, released later that year. In 2016, Kennedy released a new track \\"You Can Be (All You Want To Be)\\" on the 29 April, which is featured on his new compilation album Greatest Hits (Live). Kennedy has also broadened his talents as the author of Flying Machines and Their Heroes, a series that brings some of the greatest stories in aviation history.

Its total area constitutes . To its south and east, the raion borders upon the neighboring Vinnytsia and Zhytomyr Oblasts, respectfully. History The Derazhnia Raion was first established on March 7, 1923 as part of a full-scale administrative reorganization of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. During the same reorganization the Vovkovyntsi Raion was created with its administrative center in Vovkovyntsi, which existed until it was merged with the Derazhnia Raion in 1958. Administrative divisions The Derazhnia Raion is divided in a way that follows the general administrative scheme in Ukraine. Local government is also organized along a similar scheme nationwide. Consequently, raions are subdivided into councils, which are the prime level of administrative division in the country. Each of the raion's urban localities administer their own councils, often containing a few other villages within its jurisdiction. However, only a handful of rural localities are organized into councils, which also may contain a few villages within its jurisdiction. Accordingly, the Derazhnia Raion is divided into: * 1 city council—made up of the city of Derazhnia (administrative center) * 2 settlement councils—made up of the urban-type settlements of Vovkovyntsi and Lozove * 27 village councils Overall, the raion has a total of 62 populated localities, consisting of one city, two urban-type settlements, and 59 villages.

Beginning his royal service as a justice in London in 1147, he continued to serve both King Stephen of England and Henry II until his death around 1183. He played a minor role in the Becket controversy in 1170. Early life According to the medievalist Katharine Keats-Rohan, Gervase was the son of Roger, who was the nephew of Hubert the queen's chamberlain. Other scholars are less sure that Gervase was Roger's son, and argue that Gervase was Hubert's nephew. Gervase was likely born around 1110.Harvey \\"Cornhill, Gervase of\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography He married Agnes, the daughter of Edward of Cornhill. After his marriage, he became known as de Cornhill because of his wife's property.Keats- Rohan Domesday Descendants p. 411 Royal administrator Gervase was royal justice in London in 1147, and continued to claim that title through the 1170s on his personal seal. He was one of the members of the royal administration under King Stephen of England.Warren Henry II p. 34 Gervase was also a merchantKing King Stephen p. 366 and financier. Around 1143 he loaned money to Stephen's wife Matilda of Boulogne, and received in pledge land at Gamlingay in Cambridgeshire. The queen was unable to repay the debt, and the lands pledged eventually became Gervase's.King King Stephen p. 190 Gervase also loaned money to Hugh Tirel, son of Walter Tirel, in 1146 to enable Hugh to go on the Second Crusade. In return, Hugh pledged the manor of Langham in Essex to Gervase.King King Stephen p. 231 Gervase held the office of Sheriff of London in 1155 through 1157, 1160 and 1161, and may have held that office between 1159 and 1160 as well. He also held the office of Sheriff of Surrey from 1163 until his death as well as the office of Sheriff of Kent from 1167 to 1174. Gervase was named a judge on one of the eyre circuits in 1170.Stenton English Justice p. 73 Later life In 1170, Gervase was involved with attempts to keep Thomas Becket, who had been in exile, from returning to England. Working with Gervase were Roger de Pont L'Évêque the Archbishop of York, Gilbert Foliot the Bishop of London, Josceline de Bohon the Bishop of Salisbury, Reginald de Warenne the Sheriff of Sussex, and Ranulf de Broc.Barlow Thomas Becket p. 223 Gervase was part of the party that met Becket at Sandwich on 1 December 1070 when the archbishop returned to England. The lay members of the group, led by Gervase, complained that the archbishop was sowing dissension in the land by his excommunication of the three ecclesiastics who were with the group, but Becket managed to calm the officials by stating he would consider the matter and reply to them the next day. The next day the group was accompanied by some clergy sent by the ecclesiastics who had been excommunicated by Becket. Nothing further was accomplished by this meeting except further offers from Becket to consider other options.Barlow Thomas Becket pp. 224–227 Afterwards, Gervase and Ranulf de Broc tried to discover which of the citizens of London had welcomed Becket back into the kingdom, but were frustrated by refusal of the London clergy to appear and by the laymen refusing to answer to anything but royal writs.Barlow Thomas Becket p. 231 Gervase may be identical with the Gervase who in 1174 presented a loyalty speech to King Henry II from the citizens of London. In 1177 Gervase, along with Richard de Luci, the justiciar and Roger fitzReinfrid, assessed land taxes and heard judicial cases in Middlesex and Hampshire.West Justiciarship in England p. 47 Gervase held lands in London inherited from his father-in-law, lands in Kent from his father, and lands in Gamlingay which he got through a mortgage. He also acquired other lands in Essex and Surrey. He also gave lands at Greenwich and East Lewisham to St. Peter's Abbey in Ghent and other lands to Holy Trinity Priory at Aldgate. Death and legacy Gervase died between Michaelmas in 1183 and Michaelmas 1184. Gervase's offspring were Henry, Reginald (or Rainald), and Ralph. Ralph was also Sheriff of Kent (1191–1192) and Surrey (1191–1194).

Jerusalem was born Ignazio Gerusalemme on June 3, 1707 in Lecce, Italy. His father was Matteo Gerusalemme, a Neapolitan who had moved to Lecce in 1689 to become chapel master. One of eleven children, Jerusalem studied the violin extensively in Italy before moving in 1732 to the Spanish port city of Cádiz. Establishing himself as a virtuoso of the instrument, he performed regularly at the Coliseo de Cádiz, the city's preeminent theatre. Jerusalem was soon known as the \\"musical marvel\\" for his uncanny musical talents. In 1742, Josef Cárdenas, the administrator of the Royal Hospital of Indigenous Citizens in Mexico City, arrived in Cádiz to recruit talent for the Coliseo de México, a theatre whose proceeds supported the hospital. Cárdenas reasoned that better talent would lead to bigger theatre audiences and more funds for the hospital. He persuaded a number of music and dance talents, including Jerusalem, to return to Mexico City with him to perform at the theatre. Jerusalem began directing the musical activities at the Coliseo de México soon after he arrived. By 1746, he was earning commissions from the Catedral de México and teaching at the Colegio de Infantes (Infants College). In 1749, the cathedral ended the tenure of its lackluster chapel master, Domingo Dutra, and announced it would seek a more able leader. Jerusalem auditioned for the post. The jury, steeped in traditional musical forms, resisted the modernity and eclecticism of his compositions but ultimately confirmed him as the new chapel master on November 3, 1750, a position Jerusalem held for the rest of his life. The following decade proved tumultuous for Jerusalem: he became embroiled in a lawsuit with the tenant of the Coliseo, Joseph Calvo; his estranged wife, Doña Antonia de Estrada, petitioned the cathedral to garner his wages; he used his position to prevent musicians in other parishes from taking job opportunities from musicians in his parish; and he acquired a professional rival in Matheo Tollis della Rocca, who later succeeded Jerusalem as chapel master. Yet Jerusalem counted a number of triumphs during this time: he modernized musical notation by cathedral copyists; he improved the quality of texts used in compositions of sacred music; he more than doubled the size of the cathedral orchestra; and he composed prolifically. When he died on December 15, 1769, Jerusalem was highly esteemed by his colleagues and the musical community of Mexico City. Along with other mid-century transplants from Spain, Jerusalem helped establish the Italianate galant style in Mexico, displacing older Spanish-style music; contrary to popular belief, he did not pay any attention to the native folk songs and instruments of Mexico. His compositions circulated widely throughout New Spain (present-day Mexico) and Guatemala, reaching as far north as the California missions, where it found a place alongside the much simpler \\"California mission style\\" music.

History of Maiuma In antiquity, Gaza port was the principal port on the Mediterranean serving the Incense Road. Strabo and Ptolemy referred to it as Gazaion limen. The port was distinct from the city, which was located opposite it. The Children of Noah: Jewish Seafaring in Ancient Times, 1999, Raphael Patai The port of Gaza was at the end of the Nabataean spice road where trade was conducted in herbs, spices incense, drapery, glass and food. Goods arrived in the port on the backs of camels from Southern Arabia (the Kingdom of Sheba) through Petra, the Arava Valley and crossing the Negev Desert via Avdat. At the port of Gaza, these goods were dispatched to the European markets.Hecht Museum The Nabateans in the Negev Curator: Renate Rosenthal-HaginbottomIsraeli MFA Alexander Jannaeus' conquest of Gaza (99 BCE) that denied the Nabateans access to the port and trade with Rome led to Obodas launching a military campaign against the Hasmonean king.Hanan Eshel (2008), The Dead Sea Scrolls and the Hasmonean State, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, , pp 117-133 The port of Gaza was rebuilt after it was incorporated into the Roman Empire in 63 BCE under the command of Pompey Magnus and trade routes were reopened. It functioned as the port of Gaza (and was sometimes called simply \\"the port of Gaza\\",E. g. Strabo, Geography, 16. 2. 21) but was recognized as an independent city since the early Christian era. The Greek name Neapolis (\\"the new city\\") seems to have also been used in reference to it.Cart.

Its population was said to have been largely Egyptian in origin.Marcus Diaconus, Life of St. Porphyrius, p. 49, 5. 11 ff As the city regained its independence from Gaza, for a certain period of time it had its own bishop, due to Gaza's relatively long resistance to introduction of Christianity.

An outfielder, who is currently a free agent. Prior to playing professionally, Davis played college baseball at the University of Tennessee. Early life Davis grew up in Theodore, Alabama, where he attended Theodore High School. He worked for his father's construction company, which he credited with improving his upper body strength, allowing him to become more of a power hitter. Collegiate career Though he was considered a possible first-round draft pick in the 2007 Major League Baseball (MLB) Draft, his association with sports agent Scott Boras, whose players typically demand large signing bonuses, and an injury led him to fall into the 14th round, where he was selected by the Colorado Rockies. Rather than sign, Davis opted to attend the University of Tennessee, where he played college baseball for the Tennessee Volunteers baseball team. As a freshman, Davis had a .330 batting average with 13 home runs and 44 runs batted in (RBI).

Playing for the Fort Wayne TinCaps of the Midwest League, Hedges hit .279/.334/.451 with 10 home runs in 96 games. Scouts considered Hedges to be a stand-out defender who had surprised them with his batting at Class-A.

He started the year with the Class-A Advanced Lake Elsinore Storm where he hit .270 with four home runs in 66 games. He was promoted to the Double-A San Antonio Missions in August where he hit .224 in 20 games. He was also named to the All-Star Futures Game in 2013. Hedges received a non- roster invitation to the big league spring training camp for the second time in 2014. He was ranked #27 on Baseball America's Top 100 Prospects list coming into the season. He spent the season with San Antonio, where he hit .225 with 6 home runs over 113 games while throwing out 38% of opposing base runners. In 2015, Hedges joined the El Paso Chihuahuas of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League.

He returned to the Triple-A club six weeks after the operation and then went on a run where he hit 14 home runs and posted a .395 batting average over a 30-game stretch. He finished the season with a .326/.353/.597 batting line and 21 home runs in his 82 games with El Paso, which was considered a breakout season for a player regarded as a defense- first catcher. Hedges joined the Padres for 8 games in late September after the Triple-A national championship game. Hedges moved into a role as the Padres regular catcher in 2017, catching 115 games and backed up by Luis Torrens and Héctor Sánchez.

Behind the plate he finished fifth best among all catchers in adjusted fielding runs (11.8) according to Baseball Prospectus, despite catching only 95 games on the season.

Life Born in Orleans County, New York, he attended occasionally the district schools, and worked as a farm laborer. While working in the stone quarries of Medina, he learned privately, and attended Medina Academy for five months, so that he could go to college. In a competitive examination, he won a free tuition scholarship at Cornell University, and graduated four years later. While at Cornell, he wrote the essay which won the first prize offered nationwide to senior college students by the American Protective Tariff League. After graduation, he became first an occasional contributor to, then associate editor, and finally editor of, the American Economist, the organ of the Protective Tariff League. For the 1892 presidential campaign, he published a Pocket Cyclopedia of Protection. While writing for the newspapers, he studied law with Edmund L. Pitts, was admitted to the bar, and practiced in New York City.

In 1905, Ford was proposed as a fusion candidate for Mayor of New York, but the Republican party leaders would not commit themselves to municipal ownership of utilities, and the fusion did not materialize. Ford, who had been a Republican since he had entered politics, favored municipal ownership and joined William Randolph Hearst's Municipal Ownership League. In 1906, Ford was nominated on the Tammany Hall/Independence League fusion ticket for the New York Supreme Court, and was renominated on the Democratic and Republican tickets in 1920. Ford was a justice of the Supreme Court (1st D.) from 1907 to 1932 when he reached the constitutional age limit. In 1924, Ford supported Progressive Robert M. La Follette for President.

Built of stone and wood, it was erected in the architectural tradition of the ancient Kingdom of Aksum. Location Located 12 miles northeast from Lalibela, the church was built in a large northeast-facing cave on the west side of Mount Abuna Yosef. Until the construction of a road in 2000, according to David Phillipson, this church was reachable only after \\"a long day's arduous journey on foot or mule.\\" The church is north of a village named after it. History Entrance to the Yemrehanna Krestos church The construction of the church is credited to Yemrehana Krestos. The building is notable for its resemblance to the ancient church on Debre Damo, with walls that, according to Phillipson, \\"show a similar horizontal pattern of inset beams and projecting stonework\\", with \\"wooden quoins, door- and window-frames [that] are essentially Aksumite in style\\".David W. Phillipson, Ancient Churches of Ethiopia (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2009), pp. 75ff Munro-Hay believes that the church's interior decorations make \\"Yimrehana Krestos the most elaborate of all known ancient Ethiopian churches.\\"Munro-Hay, Ethiopia, p. 228 Mural paintings high on the nave walls are considered the oldest surviving mural paintings in Ethiopia.Phillipson, Ancient Churches, p. 188; Ewa Balicka-Witakowska and Michael Gervers, \\"The Church of Yemräḥannä Krestos and it wall-paintings: A preliminary report,\\" Africana Bulletin 49 (2001): 9-47. The cave also contains a second structure north of the church, which tradition describes as a palace or residence of Negus Yemrehana Krestos, but now serves as a residence and storage space for the local priests.Phillipson, Ancient Churches, p. 80 Emblem at the Yemrehana Krestos Church Alvarez left a description of what the church looked like in the early 16th century, in his Prester John of the Indies.Alvarez, chapter 53. Taddesse suggests that construction of this church is related to the record of an Ethiopian delegation that came to Caliph Saladin in 1173, and is recorded as presenting a letter and many gifts to the Caliph; in the Gadla Yemrehana Krestos, there is a passage that relates how he obtained the door from the Caliph's palace for his church.Taddesse Tamrat, Church and State, p. 58. This would agree with Phillipson's dating of this church to either the 11th or 12th century. Paul B. Henze provides a list of several other rock-hewn churches attributed to this king.Paul B. Henze, Layers of Time, A History of Ethiopia (New York: Palgrave, 2000), p. 51. South of the church is a tomb which Munro-Hay describes as \\"a substantial cloth-covered structure\\", and alongside it a smaller one said to belong to his slave, Ebna Yemrehana Krestos. Munro-Hay reports he was told that in the cave behind the church \\"are many skeletons of monks and others, who have been buried in this holy spot, some dating from Yimrehana Krestos' time.\\".Munro-Hay, Ethiopia, p. 230 Indeed, there is a large area at the back of the cave with numerous skeletons, several wrapped in reed mats. While preservation is generally poor, a few skulls retain their hair. The entrance of the cave is closed by a modern wall, built in the 1980s to replace an older one.

The white, wooden church was built on this site in 1952 and it was closed in 2003. The church seats about 120 people. History In December 1885, a royal decree gave permission to build a church in the fishing village of Galten, on the shores of the Galtenfjorden to serve all the fisherman and whalers living on this part of the island of Sørøya. The architect Jacob Wilhelm Nordan was the designer of the building that was completed in 1888. In 1944, when the German occupation of Norway was ending and the German army was burning all the villages in Norway, the entire village of Galten was burned. This church, however, survived because the fire in this church went out shortly after it was set. After World War II, it was decided to not rebuild the village of Galten since it was in a very isolated location, only accessible by boat. The church was then moved to the nearby village of Dønnesfjord, across the fjord. The rebuilt church was reopened in 1952.

Published in 2008 by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, the major themes of the book revolve around the Jungian concept of synchronicity, chaos theory, and the Butterfly Effect. Tornadoes and hurricanes, representative of chaos, propel the storyline across its twelve centuries.  Plot introduction  Vigorito wrote this book as an experiment in literary synchronicity, starting with the title and inventing the entire story day by day according to the synchronicities of his daily experience. What emerged was an exploration of the Butterfly Effect, as what initially appears to be a chaotic storyline eventually relents into a tightly- interconnected series of events linked across time, space, and meaning.  Characters and plot summary Diablo is serving a brief jail term in Normal, Illinois. One day, he happens to idly toss a playing card—the Joker—across his cell. From the scarce draft of the spinning card, a powerful tornado eventually forms that touches the lives of all the major characters, intersecting their lives in synchronistic fashion. Billy, the guard who released Diablo from jail, gave a ride to Diablo, who was hitchhiking outside the jail. Caught in the same tornado, Billy is torn from the driver's seat and tossed into the sky. Five years later, just after quitting a job, Diablo almost runs Billy down with his car. Billy now calls himself Billy Pronto and insists that he can only speak in the present tense. Special Agent J.J. Speed is a CIA agent and a former priest who changed his life after the tornado struck the Church in Normal, Illinois, at which he was conducting Mass. The tornado stripped him of his priestly vestments (along with the clothing of everyone else in the congregation) and sent them sailing into the sky. Twenty years later, stuck in a dead-end assignment in Playa del Carmen, Mexico, he happens across his priestly scarf—definitive as it was embroidered with his initials—being sold by a street vendor. He is shortly reassigned to New Orleans. Elizabeth Wildhack is a dropout philosopher and a New Orleans stripper. She is the daughter of Bridget Snapdragon, who gave birth to her during the tornado that struck the Church in Normal, Illinois, just before her body disappeared into the sky. Elizabeth eventually meets Diablo, who has been selling seashell pipes on Bourbon Street for the last fifteen years, ever since he quit his job and Billy Pronto began haunting him. A year prior to their meeting, and two days after a thermonuclear bomb test in the Rub al- Khali, an overnight hypercane formed in the Gulf of Mexico. New Orleans, still raw from Hurricane Katrina years back, flees its path, but the world is soon startled to discover that this anomalous hypercane is not moving, taking up an apparently stable position in the Gulf. This hypercane is the latest incarnation of the tornado initially spun from Diablo’s playing card, which had been a dust devil in the Rub al-Khali gradually dissipating into nothing before the thermonuclear explosion caused it to grow in strength. Woven throughout the larger story is Clovis, runaway serf from the 9th century who stumbles upon the mythical Golden Bough, a scene which Bridget Snapdragon happened to paint on the kitchen wall while pregnant with Elizabeth. Possessed of the Golden Bough, Clovis is thereby granted solitary access to the underworld - the world beneath the illusions of time and meaning. Existing outside of time, he aspects the trickster, and amuses himself by orchestrating tremendous coincidences.  Critical reception  Nine Kinds of Naked met with generally favorable reviews, with The Sacramento Book Review calling it \\"part quirky love story, part philosophical manifesto, and part metaphysical mystery...\\", The Chicago Sun-Times calling it \\"startlingly original,\\" Texas Monthly calling it \\"a crisp, sardonic voice,\\" and The Daily Texan calling it \\"a lyrical adventure.\\" Publisher's Weekly, however, observed that \\"the book’s time shifts, innumerable eccentricities, chaotic narrative and 400 pages are enough to wear a reader out.\\"  Trivia  This story takes place in the same fictional universe as Tony Vigorito's first novel, Just a Couple of Days.

If such a warp is detected, it is hoped that more research into creating an Alcubierre warp bubble will be inspired. A research team led by Harold \\"Sonny\\" White in collaboration with Dr. Richard Juday at the NASA Johnson Space Center and Dakota State University was conducting experiments, but results were inconclusive. In 2014, it was contended that it was unable to detect any warp fields https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264349088_The_Inability_of_the_White- Juday_Warp_Field_Interferometer_to_Spectrally_Resolve_Spacetime_Distortions, and since then it appears the device has been abandoned or at least not in use for any published experiment over the last half decade. Motivation for the experiment The NASA research team led by Harold White and their university partners currently aim to experimentally evaluate several concepts, especially a redesigned energy-density topology, as well as an implication of brane cosmology theory. If space actually were to be embedded in higher dimensions, the energy requirements could be decreased dramatically and a comparatively small energy density could already lead to a measurable (i.e. using an interferometer) curvature of spacetime. The theoretical framework for the experiment dates back to work by Harold White from 2003, as well as work by White and Eric W. Davis from 2006 that was published in the AIP, where they also consider how baryonic matter could, at least mathematically, adopt characteristics of dark energy (see section below). In the process, they described how a toroidal positive energy density may result in a spherical negative-pressure region, possibly eliminating the need for actual exotic matter. Theoretical framework The metric derived by Alcubierre was mathematically motivated by cosmological inflation. Interferometer experiment Harold White at the warp-field interferometer The original device proposed by White after finding the energy-decreasing possibilities (see theoretical framework) is a modified Michelson interferometer that uses a λ = 633 nm beam from a helium–neon laser. The beam is split into two paths, with the space-warping device placed in or near one beam path. The space warp would induce a relative phase shift between the split beams that should be detectable, provided that the magnitude of the phase shift created by the change in apparent path length is sufficient. By using 2D analytic signal processing, the magnitude and phase of the field can be extracted for study and comparison to theoretical models. The researchers first tried to see whether the space warping by the electric-field energy of a high-voltage (up to 20 kV) ring (0.5 cm radius) of high-κ barium titanate ceramic capacitors could be detected. After the first tests the experiment was moved to a seismically isolated lab due to very high interference caused by people walking outside the room. The goals circa 2013 were to increase sensitivity up to 1/100 of a wavelength and implement the oscillating field in order to get definite results.White, H. (2013). Warp Field Mechanics 101. Journal of the British Interplanetary Society, vol. 66, pp. 242–247. =Results= White announced the first results of his interferometer experiment at a 2013 space conference. According to White, these results showed a vanishing but non-zero difference between charged and uncharged states after signal processing, but this difference remains inconclusive due to external interference and limits in the computational processing. It is now clear that no exotic matter is involved in such an experiment, but some other concept is being used. Interferometer experiment with a resonant cavity Eagleworks warp-field interferometer test setup During the first two weeks of April 2015, scientists fired lasers through a microwave cavity and noticed highly significant variations in the path time. The readings indicated that some of the laser pulses traveled longer, possibly pointing to a slight warp bubble inside the resonance chamber of the device. However, a small rise in ambient air temperature inside the chamber was also recorded, which could possibly have caused the recorded fluctuation in speeds of the laser pulses. According to Paul March, a NASA JSC researcher, the experiment was to be verified inside a vacuum chamber to remove all interference of air. This was done at the end of April 2015.Re: EM Drive Developments - related to space flight applications - Thread 2 - msg1361931. White does not think, however, that the measured change in path length is due to transient air heating, because the visibility threshold is 40 times larger than the predicted effect from air. The experiment used a short, cylindrical, aluminum resonant cavity (and not a tapered resonant cavity)Re: EM Drive Developments - related to space flight applications - Thread 2 - msg1361845. excited at a natural frequency of 1.48 GHz with an input power of 30 watts, over 27000 cycles of data (each 1.5 s cycle energizing the system for 0.75 s and de-energizing it for 0.75 s), which were averaged to obtain a power spectrum that revealed a signal frequency of 0.65 Hz with amplitude clearly above system noise. Four additional tests were successfully conducted that demonstrated repeatability.Evaluating NASA’s Futuristic EM Drive. Warp-drive research and potential for interstellar propulsion The NASA research team has postulated that their findings could reduce the energy requirements for a spaceship moving at ten times the speed of light (\\"warp 2\\") from the mass–energy equivalent of the planet Jupiter to that of the Voyager 1 spacecraft (c. 700 kg) or less. By harnessing the physics of cosmic inflation, future spaceships crafted to satisfy the laws of these mathematical equations might actually be able to get somewhere unthinkably fast and without adverse effects. Physicist and EarthTech CEO Harold E. Puthoff has explained that, contrary to widespread belief, even the highly blue-shifted light seen on board such a spaceship would not fry its crew, being bathed in strong UV light and X-rays. It would, however, be dangerous to anyone seeing it fly by closely. Gallery File:White-Juday Warp Field interferometer.pngWhite–Juday warp-field interferometer process description.

In addition, these news releases included the researchers' enthusiastic descriptions of the potentials with statements such as: \\"... while this would be a very modest instantiation of the phenomenon, it would likely be a Chicago pile moment for this area of research...\\" Several space technology newsletters and space society organizations have further publicized these claims. Keith Cowing of the blog NASA Watch questions the oversight of this line of research by NASA and requested an explanation. Another journalist says that although a practical warp drive is a long way off, serious efforts to learn more about it are being undertaken now. At the second 100 Year Starship Symposium, White told Space.com, \\"We're trying to see if we can generate a very tiny instance of this in a tabletop experiment\\", the project is a \\"humble experiment\\" but said it represents a promising first step: \\"The findings I presented today change it from impractical to plausible and worth further investigation.\\" See also *Spacecraft propulsion *Faster-than-light *Krasnikov tube *Exact solutions in general relativity – for more on the Alcubierre spacetime solution *Quantum vacuum plasma thruster – another proposed device from the same NASA laboratory *IXS Enterprise ReferencesExternal links * YouTube video of Harold White - Faster than Light: Warp Drive - SpaceVision 2013 Conference * YouTube video of Harold White - Dr Harold White's Presentation at the 2013 Starship Congress  Einstein-Maxwell equations for asymmetric resonant cavities Category:Interferometers Category:Interstellar travel Category:Hypothetical technology Category:Faster-than-light travel ","title":"White–Juday warp-field interferometer"},{"id":"38193237","text":"Sheen Kaaf Nizam, born in the year 1945 or 1946 in Jodhpur, India, is an Urdu poet and literary scholar.

It originally aired on NBC on January 31, 2013. The episode was written by Carrie Kemper and directed by David Rogers. The episode features the return and introduction of several guest stars, including Chris Diamantopoulos, Beth Grant, Chris Gethard, Matt L. Jones, Lance Krall, Will McCormack, Mark Proksch, Michael Schur, James Urbaniak, Eric Wareheim. The series—presented as if it were a real documentary—depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In the episode, Dunder Mifflin CEO David Wallace (Andy Buckley) tasks Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) with finding a part-time replacement for Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), and Dwight must choose among Clark (Clark Duke) and several of his close friends, including his cousin Mose (Schur). The episode received mixed reviews from television critics, with many considering it superior to \\"Vandalism\\", particularly for the lessened presence of Brian. \\"Junior Salesman\\" was viewed by 4.45 million viewers and received a 2.1/5% rating among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. Although The Office, ranked third in its timeslot, it ranked as the highest-rated NBC series of the night. Synopsis Dunder Mifflin CEO David Wallace (Andy Buckley) has tasked Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) with finding a part-time replacement for Jim Halpert (John Krasinski). Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) is concerned about this, as Jim's replacement will be her new \\"deskmate\\". Clark Green (Clark Duke) feels he is ready for the position, citing his key role in various sales, but Dwight wants someone who he can be sure will not team up with Pam against him. To that end, he brings in a bizarre gallery of his relatives and close friends, including his cousin Mose (Michael Schur), best friend Rolf (James Urbaniak), part-time private investigator Trevor (Chris Gethard), former Corporate executive Troy Underbridge (Noel Petok), and his karate teacher Sensei Ira (Lance Krall). To Dwight's horror, though, none of his candidates are competent enough to even make it through the full job interview, much less be paper salesmen. Clark ends his interview after answering Dwight's complicated questions perfectly, pointing out that he has no choice but to hire him if he wants someone who can do the job. Jim calls Wallace to pitch for the CEO to invest in Athlead. Dwight puts the conversation on speaker phone, allowing him to hear Wallace first tell Jim his salary is going to be cut to reflect his part-time status, and then bluntly shoot down the idea of investing in Athlead. Dwight, though praising his friends' outlandish delinquent behavior to the cameras, gradually comes to realize his professional integrity will not allow him to hire any of them, and sadly notes that he outgrew all of his friends in just three hours. Afraid they will hate him if he does not pick one of them, he asks Jim to pretend to take over the hiring decision and make the call to hire no one. Being willing to do anything to save Pam from being stuck with an unbearable deskmate, Jim agrees. However, when Jim announces the decision, Rolf immediately intuits that Dwight is using Jim as a scapegoat. Dwight's friends storm off to play paintball without him, later sending an e-mail with a photo of their paintball outing and the message \\"Glad you're not here\\" while giving Dwight the finger. Clark gets the salesman job. Pam is grateful to Jim for arranging this but says she still misses her \\"old deskmate\\" Jim. Pam briefly lifts Dwight's spirits by suggesting they \\"haze the new guy\\", though she makes Dwight stop that plan when he nearly suffocates Clark with shrink wrap. It is also hinted that Brian (Chris Diamantopoulos), the boom mike operator for the documentary crew, has developed a crush on Pam. Production \\"Junior Salesman\\" was written by executive story editor Carrie Kemper, who is the younger sister of cast member Ellie Kemper, making it her fourth writing credit for the series, following the ninth-season entry, \\"The Whale\\". The episode was directed by series editor David Rogers, marking his eighth directing credit for the series, following the ninth season entry, \\"Andy's Ancestry\\". The episode features guest appearances from Matt L. Jones as Dwight's cousin, Zeke. Jones had initially been cast for a proposed Office spin-off centered on Dwight titled \\"The Farm\\". A backdoor pilot was filmed, but upon review, the spin-off was not picked up by NBC. The episode also features the first time appearance of Eric Wareheim as Gabor and Will McCormack as Wolf. In addition to new guest stars, the episode saw the return of several minor characters, including Lance Krall as Sensei Ira, Chris Gethard as Trevor, Noel Petok as Troy Underbridge, Beth Grant as Dwight's babysitter, Melvina, and James Urbaniak as Rolf. The press release for the episode included, \\"Erin tries to find her birth parents with Pete's help\\", although this plotline was completely absent from the episode. David Rogers, who is also an editor on the series, said that storyline was cut because \\"we had so much great comedy and needed the time for Dwight and his freaky friends and how Jim and the gang reacted\\". Rogers also commented since they shoot in a documentary style, they can shoot faster than regular single-camera comedies, meaning their first cut of the episodes can be 15–21 minutes longer than the 22-minute air length, and several scenes need to be cut. Broadcast and reception=Ratings= \\"Junior Salesman\\" originally aired on NBC on January 31, 2013, alongside the following episode, \\"Vandalism\\". The hour-long timeslot for The Office followed the one-hour series finale of 30 Rock. In its original American broadcast, \\"Junior Salesman\\" was viewed by 4.45 million viewers and received a 2.1 rating/5 percent share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, marking a slight rise in the ratings from the previous episode, \\"Customer Loyalty\\". This means that it was seen by 2.1 percent of all 18- to 49-year- olds, and 5 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. The Office ranked third in its timeslot, and was the highest-rated NBC series of the night, although the hour-long installment of 30 Rock received more viewers. 1.91 million viewers watched the episode through DVR playback, bringing the total viewership to 6.36 million. =Reviews= The presence of Chris Diamantopoulos throughout the episode was the main criticism from most critics. The episode received mixed reviews from television critics. Michael Tedder of Vulture awarded the episode—along with \\"Vandalism\\"—four stars out of five. He called it \\"one of the silliest episodes in recent memory\\", and complimented the break from the dramatic ending of \\"Customer Loyalty\\". He also complimented the maturation of Dwight throughout the episode, calling this episode a \\"mile-marker\\" for his character. He considered it superior to the succeeding episode, \\"Vandalism\\". IGN writer Roth Cornet said the Dwight plotline yielded the \\"funniest and most disturbing moments of the night\\", but that the episode did not allow for much work to be given to the rest of the ensemble cast. Cornet also went on to criticize Brian's infatuation towards Pam and the potential \\"other-man\\" outcome for their storyline, stating that it would ultimately just be a \\"gimmick\\". She gave the episode a 7.5/10, calling it \\"Good\\". Bonnie Stiernberg of Paste considered the episode to be a build-up to the \\"gut-punch\\" scene between Brian and Pam in \\"Vandalism\\", considering the only other important plot from the episode to be the Dwight-Jim one. Stiernberg considered the Dwight-Jim subplot to be \\"moderately funny\\", but \\"predictably bizarre\\". She gave the episode a seven out of ten, along with \\"Vandalism\\".

The episode was written by Owen Ellickson. It was directed by Lee Kirk, who is series star Jenna Fischer's husband. It originally aired on NBC on January 31, 2013. The episode guest stars Chris Diamantopoulos as Brian the boom mike operator, Mark Proksch as Nate, Brad William Henke as Frank, and Ameenah Kaplan as Val. The series—presented as if it were a real documentary—depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In this episode, someone vandalizes Pam Halpert's warehouse mural. Distraught, she enlists Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) to help her track down the vandal. Meanwhile, in their Philadelphia apartment, Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) is uncomfortable with Jim Halpert's (John Krasinski) uncleanliness. Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey) begrudgingly allows Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) and Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) to attend her son Phillip's first birthday party. The episode received mixed reviews from television critics; many felt that the subplot involving Brian (Diamantopoulos) being attracted to Pam was shoehorned into the series and served little function other than to create superfluous drama. The episode was viewed by 3.97 million viewers and received a 1.9/5 percent rating among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. Although the episode ranked first in its half-hour timeslot, it tied with the series finale of 30 Rock to be the second highest-rated NBC series of the night. Synopsis Someone vandalizes Pam Halpert's (Jenna Fischer) warehouse mural. Distraught, she demands to know who was responsible, but the warehouse workers remain silent to protect their coworker. She then tries appealing to the sympathies of the other office workers, but with her husband Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) off in Philadelphia and regional manager Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) still away in the Bahamas, only Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) show any interest. The three lure warehouse worker Nate (Mark Proksch) into the foreman's office, under the pretense of telling him that his mother is dying, and interrogate him in isolation; Nate soon cracks and identifies Frank (Brad William Henke) as the vandal. They take the matter to human resources, and Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) holds a meeting between the involved parties. Pam, presumably at Toby's suggestion, apologizes for having possibly infringed on Frank's space by using the warehouse to paint her mural, but Frank in response insults Pam and her mural profanely and insists that his drawing of butts was funny. Toby and Nellie both take Frank's side, so Pam and Dwight take things into their own hands by painting a grotesque nude man on Frank's truck with washable paint. As Pam tells the documentary crew that she feels it is appropriate that she used her art to enact her revenge for the vandalism, Frank shows up yelling in anger and lunges at Pam. Brian (Chris Diamantopoulos), the crew's boom mic operator, intervenes by hitting Frank across the face with his mic. Frank and Brian are subsequently fired by their respective employers. As Brian leaves, he tells Pam that he will always be there for her if she needs someone. In their Philadelphia apartment, Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) and Jim find their living styles are increasingly clashing. Jim is slovenly, leaving dirty dishes to soak in the sink until someone else washes them, while Darryl is so fastidious about his possessions that he puts labels with his name on all of them, even a bag of flour. When Darryl takes issue with Jim using his labeled coffee mug, the two begin bickering. Eventually the two come to understand each other's habits better, and relieve tension by playing a video game together. Angela (Angela Kinsey) and Robert Lipton (Jack Coleman) are celebrating their son Phillip's first birthday with a gathering of wealthy political allies. Angela is shocked to learn that Robert invited his lover Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) to the party after she told Robert she did not want him there. Angela invites Dwight (her own extramarital lover) in retaliation, but he scorns the invitation in order to help Pam with her investigation. Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) hears of this and eagerly volunteers to go in Dwight's place. Oscar, who believes he was invited because Robert is in love with him, is hurt when he finds out that he was invited to boost Robert's opinion in the polls among Latino voters. During the taking of a group photo, Robert has Oscar stand in a spot where he almost completely blocks off Angela, and Oscar and Angela begin to bicker with each other. After the party, Robert rebukes them for their behavior and admonishes them to do better in the future. However, Kevin interrupts to tell Robert that he enjoyed the food, and that Robert is a terrible person for treating Angela and Oscar strictly as a means to gain political support, secretly pleasing Angela and Oscar. Production \\"Vandalism\\" was written by supervising producer Owen Ellickson, making it his third writing credit for the series. It was directed by Lee Kirk. This marks his first directorial entry for the series, although he had previously guest starred as the minor character Clark in the sixth season episode \\"The Delivery\\". Kirk is also Fischer's husband. The episode guest stars Diamantopoulos as Brian the boom mike operator, his third appearance after the preceding two episodes. Proksch returns as Nate, as does Kaplan as Val. This is the first episode to feature Henke as Frank. Daniels had teased in an interview that one character would be fired from the show \\"in Episode 15\\". Although \\"Vandalism\\" was the fourteenth episode aired, it was actually the fifteenth produced, based on production numbers. Broadcast and reception=Ratings= \\"Vandalism\\" originally aired right after \\"Junior Salesman\\" on NBC on January 31, 2013. In its original American broadcast, the episode was viewed by 3.97 million viewers, making it the second episode in the series, after the earlier ninth season entry \\"The Target\\", to dip below the 4 million threshold. It received a 1.9 rating/5 percent share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. This means that it was seen by 1.9 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 5 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. The Office ranked first in its half hour timeslot, and tied with the series finale of 30 Rock to be the second highest-rated NBC series of the night, although 30 Rock garnered more viewers. Both the finale of 30 Rock and \\"Vandalism\\" were beaten by \\"Junior Salesman\\". =Reviews= The episode's subplot involving Chris Diamantopoulos was met with scorn by most critics. Michael Tedder of Vulture awarded the episode—along with \\"Junior Salesman\\"—four stars out of five. He enjoyed Kevin's telling off the Senator for his poor treatment of his friends and family, and said \\"that it came with Kevin's halting delivery just made it better.\\" However, he was critical of the Brian subplot, calling it \\"the least interesting way this camera crew reveal could have gone\\". Roth Cornet of IGN awarded the episode a 7 out of 10, denoting a \\"good\\" episode. Despite noting that the show itself was still good in comparison to much of television, Cornet wrote that the episode is an example of the \\"danger of needlessly dragging things out, as we have seen the waste of ending things before they have had the opportunity to reach their full potential in the past.\\" Cornet praised Kevin's \\"truth bomb\\", writing that it \\"worked beautifully\\", but she called \\"the 'man behind the curtain' reveal ... a bitter disappointment\\" and a \\"cop-out\\" to engage the audience. Brett Davinger of The California Literary Review called Brian's antics \\"creepy\\", and wondered if the character would begin to emulate the characteristics of the eighth season character Cathy, who attempted to cheat with Jim. He called the Jim and Darryl story filler, but was more positive about Oscar and Kevin's story, noting that the ending was \\"a short segment, but well done\\". Bonnie Stiernberg of Paste magazine wrote that the idea of Brian temporarily dividing Pam and Jim led to \\"one of the more out-of-the-box episodes\\" of the series. However, she felt that the writers should have \\"thought of [the idea] sometime last season\\" and that the concept seemed forced. Stiernberg paralleled the quick buildup to Pam and Brian's relationship unfavorably to the slow buildup of Pam and Jim's initial attraction to each other. Nick Campbell of TV.com wrote that \\"Vandalism\\"—along with \\"Junior Salesman\\"—was \\"so much sharper than last week's trial in Dullsville\\". He felt that the episode was \\"important\\", because it continued the plot involving Brian. Campbell initially was not pleased with the development, but said that the plot will be \\"the ultimate test of the show's romantic theory\\" that \\"the meek men (the proletariat) constantly and righteously upending the established and neglectful men (the bourgeoisie) in the lives of The Offices womenfolk\\". Erik Adams of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a \\"C−\\" and largely criticized the introduction of Brian as a potential love interest for Pam. He was especially critical of the fight scene, saying Brian coming to Pam's rescue was an unnecessary contrivance, and that having Dwight in the role of Pam's defender would have been a more fitting resolution to the subplot. Adams, however, was complimentary towards Kevin's part in the episode, and called it a flash \\"of late-period Office at its very best\\". Casey Gillis of The News & Advance said the overall success of the ninth season of The Office was hurt by \\"Vandalism\\", as well as \\"Junior Salesman\\". She wrote that, while the episode \\"would have been enjoyable by\\" itself, after Brian defended Pam \\"the show sailed right over that shark\\".

Further observations revealed radial velocity variations in time with the brightness variations, but this was assumed to indicate a spectroscopic binary system. The brightness variations were then interpreted as eclipses. Less than 10 years later, was κ Pav was listed as a likely Cepheid variable. In 1937 it was used as part of the effort to calibrate the Cepheid distance scale. Only years later were the separate period luminosity relationships for population I and II Cepheid variables identified, and κ Pav was assigned to the type II group. Variability Lightcurve of κ Pavonis recorded by NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). κ Pavonis ranges between apparent magnitudes 3.91 and 4.78, and spectral types F5 to G5, over a period of 9.1 days. It is a W Virginis variable, a type II Cepheid thought to be evolving along a blue loop from the thermal pulsing asymptotic giant branch. κ Pav shows sudden small changes in the period of its otherwise highly regular pulsations. The period has changed at times by as much as 16 minutes from its average of around 9 days and 2 hours. The star also is considered peculiar compared to other W Virginis stars such as W Virginis itself. A sub-group of W Virginis stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud have been discovered to be hotter and more luminous than expected and given a pW (peculiar W Virginis) classification. It is proposed that κ Pav should also be given a pW classification. The peculiarities in the LMC stars may be due to binary interactions, although κ Pav is not known to be a binary star. Properties κ Pavonis is a large star several hundred times more luminous than the sun. Its spectral type varies as it pulsates, between F5 and G5 as the temperature changes, and the luminosity class changes from a bright giant to a supergiant. The luminosity class is relatively high for a star of this luminosity, due to the low surface gravity caused by a low mass pulsating star. The pulsations cause the star's radius to change by about above and below the mean size. The angular diameter of the disc has been directly observed to change during the pulsations.

The novel, Ellis' second, was released on 1 January 2013 through Mulholland Books, and reached The New York Times Best Seller list. It follows Detective John Tallow as he becomes involved in a mystery surrounding several unsolved homicides. Ellis intended the book to serve as a contrast to police procedurals such as CSI, which he dubbed \\"bedtime stories\\". Television rights have been sold to 20th Century Fox TV and Chernin Entertainment. Plot summary While answering a public disturbance call on Pearl Street, NYPD Detective John Tallow's partner of twenty years is killed by a depressed apartment tenant. Tallow kills the tenant but the brief exchange of gunfire opens a hole in the wall of an apartment, the inside coated wall to wall with firearms. The firearms are revealed to have each been murder weapons in hundreds of unsolved killings over the last decade, the trophy room of an extremely prolific serial killer. Tallow, assisted by a pair of forensic analysts Bat and Scarly, are given the nearly impossible task of finding the killer behind the murders. Meanwhile, the book cuts occasionally to the perspective of the former owner of the guns, a man referred to as The Hunter, a high-functioning schizophrenic who perceives New York both in its modern appearance and as it appeared before the arrival of settlers. As Tallow works on the case he begins to understand the 'trophy room' has some greater meaning to The Hunter, discovering that the guns have a connection to the people who they killed, either a reference to the make or use of the gun or even puns. He believes the guns are selected for some higher purpose, that understanding the pattern and the purpose of the construction will help him discover the killer. Eventually he unravels a conspiracy that ties a banker, the Assistant Chief of Police, and the CEO of a private security company to the mysterious killer, using him as a hitman for their own personal gain. Tallow, Bat, and Scarly ambush The Hunter at Tallow's apartment. Bat is non-fatally shot, and Tallow chases down and captures The Hunter at a police building that the Assistant Chief had given him access to hide in. Following The Hunter's capture the Assistant Chief is charged with the crime while the banker disappears out of country and the private security CEO kills himself with his wife. Tallow speaks with The Hunter, in prison and taking anti-psychotics for his schizophrenia, and confirms his suspicion that the room of guns was a Native American wampum, a kind of symbolic language made with beads. The purpose of the wampum in the killer's deranged mind, once completed, would be to supernaturally eject the White-European settler Americans from New York with all of its modern culture and return New York to its pre-industrial state. Media=Television adaptation= Ellis has confirmed that rights for Gun Machine have been purchased by the 20th Century Fox TV and Chernin Entertainment, with the intent of turning it into a television series. He also confirmed that he would serve as executive producer for the potential series along with Dario Scardapane, Peter Chernin and Katherine Pope. In April 2014, Microsoft announced that Xbox Entertainment Studios acquired the television rights as part of its Xbox Originals exclusive television programming initiative. Ellis will executive produce along with Brett Conrad, who has signed on to write the pilot. =Trailers= Trailers for Gun Machine, one of which was narrated by Wil Wheaton, were released shortly after the book's street date. The trailers were well received, with io9 calling the second trailer \\"creeptastic\\". Reception Critical reception for Gun Machine has been mostly positive, with The A.V.

History The church had its origin in the late nineteenth century, when the First Baptist Church of Seattle established missionary churches for several of the ethnic groups of foreign laborers in the area, including a Scandinavian Baptist Church (1883) and a Japanese Baptist Church (1899). A Committee on Chinese Work was established in 1892. It conducted a school and worship services in a house at 5th and Yesler, then moved to a larger building in the Chinese district. In 1902 funds were raised to construct a church at Washington and Maynard streets. No longer a \\"mission church\\" dependent on its sponsor, from that point on the church had Chinese pastors and was admitted to the Western Washington Baptist Convention. The church served as a focal point for the Chinese American community until 1977, when the congregation moved to a larger facility in Beacon Hill.

The church that was originally housed in this building, First Methodist Protestant Church of Seattle, later known as Capitol Hill United Methodist Church, was founded by Rev. Daniel Bagley in 1865 and met in buildings in downtown Seattle until the construction of this building on Capitol Hill. In 1991, due to declining membership and increasing costs of building upkeep, the church moved out of the building. The building was renovated from a church to an office building in 2004, and is currently owned and occupied by Catalysis Corporation, a Seattle-based digital marketing agency. Neither the church nor the building should be confused with the First Methodist Episcopal Church of Seattle, which was founded in 1853 (the first church organized in Seattle), which was also once housed in an historic building (at Fifth Avenue and Marion Street in downtown Seattle) built in 1906. Prior to the construction of the 1906 buildings, when both congregations met downtown, they were disambiguated by calling the Methodist Episcopal church the \\"Little White Church\\" and the Methodist Protestant one the \\"Little Brown Church\\". When the Methodist Episcopal Church and the Methodist Protestant Church became a single denomination in 1939, the congregation that met in the Capitol Hill building that is the subject of this article changed their name from \\"First Methodist Protestant\\" to \\"Capitol Hill Methodist\\", while the downtown Methodist Episcopal congregation became simply \\"First Methodist Church\\"; decades later, another denominational merger led to both adding \\"United\\" to their names.

It is a small, intimate image of a woman sewing. Description The Seamstress depicts a woman with her back to the viewer, sewing in front of a window. A feeling of three-dimensionality is created by the juxtaposition of vividly patterned wallpaper with plain grey walls. The painting seems almost unfinished, since Vuillard left the underlying board exposed in the table, the seamstress' dress, and the wall. The stripe of wallpaper that dominates the left third of the composition is ambiguously related to the rest of the room, leaving the viewer to decide their orientation to the subject. The interplay of those beiges, browns, and reds with the stark, flat pink of the window (a Vuillard hallmark) fills that ambiguous space with intensity. The scraps of cloth and wallpaper create patterns of color and shape as visually arresting as the subject matter. Historical information Vuillard is most famous for indoor scenes such as this, which reveal the details of their subjects' lives in claustrophobic detail. Most of his 1890s output was small, domestic, and feminine as a result of the artist's corset-maker mother's heavy influence on his life. The physical, though not emotional, diminutiveness, of these early works dissatisfied Vuillard, who used his connections to spend the rest of his lengthy career focusing on large decorative panels. For these, he abandoned his distinctive style and moved to more conventional depictions of objects and space. Thus, the current artistic consensus is that his career peaked in his first decade, though he was active for more than forty years. As an eager young student, he had helped form les Nabis, a group of progressive artists inspired by Gauguin and the Symbolists. They prioritized the abstract and decorative functions of shape and color. As he grew more conventional, Vuillard abandoned such visually engaging habits. =Location history= The Seamstress has been on view in many locations, including Le Barc de Boutteville of Paris in 1893; the McLellan Galleries in Glasgow in 1920; the Lefevre Gallery in London in 1945; a traveling exhibition of Vuillard's intimate interiors that reached Houston, Washington, D.C., and Brooklyn in 1989-1990; and a comprehensive retrospective arranged by the National Gallery of Art in D.C., the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, the Galeries nationales du Grand Palais in Paris, and the Royal Academy of Arts in London in 2003-2004. =Acquisition= The IMA acquired The Seamstress in 1969 as a gift of Blanche Stillson in memory of Caroline Marmon Fesler.

Xépôn (also known as Tchepone and Sepon), is a village in the Seponh District of Savannakhet Province, Laos. It was approximately east of the intersection of the Sepon River and the Banghiang River. It was the target of Operation Lam Son 719 in 1971, an attempt by the armed forces of South Vietnam and the United States to cut the Ho Chi Minh Trail. The village now known as Old Xépôn (Xépôn Kao in Lao) was destroyed. In the 1990s, gold mining began at the site, helping to create Lao's largest private industry. Expansion of mining in the area has dislocated indigenous villages around Old Xépôn.Asia Indigenous Peoples Pact. Indigenous Women in Southeast Asia: Challenges in Their Access to Justice. Chiang Mai, Thailand: March 2013. Accessed 2013-12-16. Geography Xépôn was on the north bank of the Sepon River at an elevation of .Collins, p. 373. The countryside is mountainous, broken, and covered in subtropical forest. Average rainfall each year is . In the rainy season (July to September), rainfall could be a month.Collins, p. 375. The Sepon River runs in a trough between two natural, high ridges. The trough itself is only wide. This geologic feature begins just west of the town of Khe Sanh in Vietnam. The northern ridge ends near Xépôn, while the southern ridge continues for another . A shallow bowl forms between the ridges (permitting north-south traffic out of the valley) near the Laotian town of Ban Dong. The southern ridge turns southwest (followed by Route 9 on the north side and the Banghiang River on the south side), and ends near the town of Mường Phìn. However, the best break in these ridges occurred at Xépôn, where land traffic could move east, southeast, and southwest.Collins, p. 371. History Human occupation of Xépôn goes back at least 2,000 years. There is evidence of a large copper mining complex, with some shafts up to deep, in the area around the village.Higham, p. 184. Human burial sites from the same period are also located near these ancient copper mines, making them (as archeologist Charles Higham concludes) one of the most important burial sites in all of Southeast Asia. Xépôn was most likely settled in the 1500s by settlers from the Muong Thanh Valley in Vietnam.Cheesman, p. 152. During the period when France ruled Laos as a colony, the French constructed Route 9. Opened about 1930,Stuart- Fox, p. 49. Route 9 ran from the major city of Savannakhet on the Thai-Laotian border in the west across the entire country to the border with Vietnam in the east. It met National Route 9, a major Vietnamese highway, at the border.Collins, p. 372. Just a few meters upriver from where the Sepon and Banghiang rivers met, Route 9 crossed the Banghiang. The bridge here had three spans, and could accommodate much traffic.Collins, p. 335. Xépôn also played a role in anti-colonial movements in Laos. In the aftermath of World War II, a Laotian independence movement, the Lao Issara, formed to seek national independence. Thao Ō Anourack, a native of Xépôn, was appointed commander of all Lao Issara forces in the district.Savada, p. 29. Initially successful, French forces seized the capital of Vientiane by April 1946. Most of the Lao Issara fled to Thailand. In September 1946, however, several Laotian leaders met in the Vietnamese city of Vinh and, with the sponsorship of the Viet Minh movement, formed the Committee for Lao Resistance in the East to carry on the fight for independence. Thao Ō Anurak was one of the founding members of the committee.Stuart-Fox, p. 71. Due to its location near the ridge breaks and two major rivers, the village of Xépôn is estimated to have had about 1,500 inhabitants in 1960. Just five years later, half of the residents had fled due to war. Air base During the 1950s, the French military built a military airfield near Xépôn. The airfield was located about northwest of the village on the south bank of the Nam Se Kok River. At in length, the dirt airstrip was the largest in Savannakhet Province, and the second largest airfield of any in the nearby South Vietnamese provinces. The Royal Lao Army ceased defending the airfield in 1961, and it fell into North Vietnamese hands. Xépôn proved to be a critical point on the Ho Chi Minh Trail. The trail was a series of supply routes along through Laos which North Vietnam used to supply forces of both the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) and the Viet Cong guerrilla forces, both of which were operating in South Vietnam. Route 9 provided a quick way to move supplies east. The light Vietnamese trucks could also cross the Banghiang River at Xépôn which, although across was just deep most of the year, and then travel further south. This made Xépôn the choke point for almost all motorized traffic passing through Mu Gia Pass, the main Ho Chi Minh Trail entry point into Laos.Perlstein, p. 546. Only Route 23, which led south from Mường Phìn, provided a good alternative.Collins, p. 378. The North Vietnamese invested Xépôn in December 1958,Phraxayavong, p. 76. and built a large, heavily defended military base there to defend the area. Operation Lam Son 719 U.S. officials believed that Xépôn was abandoned by 1970.Van Atta, p. 347. In 1971, Xépôn was the focus of Operation Lam Son 719.Nguyen and Dommen, p. 252. On 8 February, I Corps of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN)—supported by long-range artillery, bombers, and helicopters provided by the U.S. armed forces—invaded Laos. The objective was Xépôn, where the air base was to be made operational. The goal was to interdict the Ho Chi Minh Trail for three months. The operation was a complete failure. Instead of attacking at the end of the rainy season (when North Vietnamese troops would be very under supplied), the attack began three months later, long after their supplies had been replenished. I Corps officers, many of whom were suspected of North Vietnamese sympathies, were told of the operation at the last minute. Press reports of the operation leaked almost as soon as the attack began, alerting North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces. Logistical planning by the South Vietnamese and the U.S. was poor. Nearly 8,000 ARVN troops were lost, and more than 100 U.S. helicopters. Nearly US$1 million in military equipment was abandoned as ARVN forces fled Laos in a near-rout on 24 March. It is not clear whether Xépôn was still occupied by the North Vietnamese troops at the time. U.S. officials reported large quantities of food, ammunition, and other supplies cached in and around Xépôn, and that ARVN troops and U.S. aircraft destroyed them.Van Atta, p. 346-347. But other reports indicate that, while supply caches were destroyed, Xépôn had already been abandoned by the North Vietnamese in favor of other routes.\\"Crossroads at Tchepone.\\" Life.

In the years after the new government took power, a new town using the name Xépôn was built on the site of the old French airfield.

Fourteen villages directly within the core mine zone had been relocated. About seventy more villages are within the mine concession but these had not yet been asked to move. Communities impacted by the Sepon mine include Makong, Tri (Try), Kri and Lao Loum, the dominant ethnic Lao. Although many of the communities have not been asked to relocate, water pollution and deforestation forced many to leave their villages. Some resettled at the mine resettlement site.

Career and research right Wise's research has focused on the role of non-positively curved cube complexes within geometric group theory and their interplay with residual finiteness. His early work was taken to higher dimensions when he introduced with Frédéric Haglund the theory of special cube complexes. In 2009 he announced a solution to the virtually fibered conjecture for cusped hyperbolic 3-manifolds. This was a consequence of his work on the structure of groups with a quasiconvex hierarchy which proved the virtual specialness of a broad class of hyperbolic groups, and established a program for using cube complexes to understand many infinite groups. This subsequently played a key role in the proof of the Virtually Haken conjecture. =Selected publications=   Wise, Daniel T.

The population was 4,924 at the 2010 census. Bucksport is across the Penobscot River estuary from Fort Knox and the Penobscot Narrows Bridge, which replaced the Waldo–Hancock Bridge. History The first inhabitants of Bucksport were a 5,000-year-old prehistoric culture known as the Red Paint People, that would later be referred to as the Maritime Archaic. They were thought to be a highly advanced native fishing culture that buried red paint in their graves along with stone tools and weapons. The first archaeological dig in the state of Maine, if not the entire United States, was initiated by Professor Charles Willoughby in 1891 on Indian Point, on a site where the present-day mill is located.The Red Paint People Once territory of the Tarrantine (now called Penobscot) Abenaki Native Americans, it was one of six townships granted by the Massachusetts General Court to Deacon David Marsh of Haverhill, Massachusetts and 351 others. Colonel Jonathan Buck and a number of the grantees arrived in 1762 to survey the land, then returned to Haverhill. In June 1763, Buck came back to settle permanently what was known as Plantation No. 1, building a sawmill on Mill Creek, as well as a house and store. By 1775 the plantation had 21 families. Legend has it that Buck burned his mistress for being a witch, and that she promised to return and seek vengeance on the town. It is believed to be her foot and leg that appears on his tombstone, reappearing each time it has been replaced.Haunted Places in Maine During the Revolutionary War, the British military built Fort George at Castine. On April 14, 1779, the stronghold became the site of a major American naval defeat called the Penobscot Expedition. The following day, when most of Plantation No. 1 was deserted, the 16-gun Royal Navy sloop HMS Nautilus anchored at the harbor. Its crew burned the town, sparing only those remaining inhabitants who swore allegiance to the Crown. But following the peace treaty of 1783, the town was resettled and called Buckstown Plantation after its founder. Incorporated on June 27, 1792 as Buckstown, it was renamed Bucksport in 1817. The town was occupied by the British during the War of 1812. In 1851, the East Maine Conference Seminary was opened by the Methodist Church as a preparatory school, but closed in 1933 when Bucksport opened its first public secondary school. In 1780, the Jed Prouty Tavern and Inn was built in downtown Bucksport. It was expanded to a 17-room hotel around 1820. It is now being turned into a nursing home for the elderly. Bucksport is also well known for its bizarre and fantastic stories. In 1892, a circus elephant named Charlie broke loose and roamed the town a free animal. He was finally captured, with the help of a pit bull, who cornered the elephant so his handlers could secure him. On the evening of October 13, 1876, a triple homicide took place, leaving an old man named Robert Trim, his 32-year-old daughter Melissa Thayer, and Thayer's 4-year-old daughter Josie murdered and their family farm burned to the ground. The authorities soon arrested a sea captain despite the lack of witnesses, evidence or motive, and his trial was one of the biggest the young state had ever seen. The captain was found guilty and sentenced to life in Thomaston Prison.The Trim Triple Homicide In 1898, another notorious murder took place. A woman named Sarah Ware went missing on the evening of September 17, and her beheaded and badly decomposed body was discovered by a search party two weeks later near Miles Lane. A man named William Treworgy was eventually tried for the murder but was acquitted, and the case was never solved.The Sarah Ware Murder Bucksport is depicted in the 1960s ABC television series Dark Shadows, most prominently in the 1840 time period, as located near the fictional town of Collinsport. Bucksport's history and reputation were rumored to be the predominant inspirations for the fictional Collinsport several years before the writers of the serial incorporated Bucksport into the storyline. The town's terrain is uneven, riven with ponds and streams. Farmers grew hay and potatoes. Shipbuilding, however, would become the principal occupation. Many worked at fisheries, sailing to the Grand Banks for their catch. Other industries produced lumber, ships' pumps, blocks, plugs, wedges and wheels, boats, barrels, carriages, leather, boots and shoes and stone work. In 1874, the Bucksport and Bangor Railroad was completed. It provided Bangor with shipping access to Penobscot Bay during winter months when the Penobscot River froze. The Maine Seaboard Paper Company in 1930 opened the Bucksport Mill, a paper mill with two machines which manufactured 300 tons of newsprint per day. Until 2014 it was owned successively by Time, Inc., St. Regis Paper Company, Champion International, International Paper, and Verso Paper. It held 4 machines with a capacity to manufacture 482,800 tons annually. On October 1, 2014, it was announced by Verso that they would be closing the mill, effective on December 1, laying off 570 workers. On February 22, 2018 Whole Oceans Aquaculture announced their intent to purchase the site of the former Verso paper mill and convert it into a 400 million gallon recirculating aquaculture system facility for land-based Atlantic Salmon production.Whole Oceans The facility is expected to cost an initial 75 million dollars and bring up to 250 million dollars in investment to the area. Up to 200 full-time workers are expected to be employed. Whole Oceans expects to break ground in Fall of 2018 and reach a capacity of 25,000 tons of salmon within fifteen years.

After a three hours skirmish, the French stormed across the Alcántara Bridge and forced the Portuguese to retreat. The clash happened during the Peninsular War, part of the Napoleonic Wars. Alcántara, Spain is situated on the Tagus river near the Portuguese border, west-southwest of Madrid. While Marshal Nicolas Soult invaded northern Portugal in early 1809, two other French forces stood ready to cooperate in the subjugation of Portugal. Pierre Belon Lapisse's division lurked near Ciudad Rodrigo while Victor's I Corps operated in the Tagus valley. A weak force under Robert Thomas Wilson watched Lapisse while Alexander Randoll Mackenzie's Anglo- Portuguese corps kept an eye on Victor. After being outgeneraled by Wilson, Lapisse marched south to join Victor. When Sir Arthur Wellesley's Anglo- Portuguese army advanced to attack Soult's corps, the detachment under Mayne occupied Alcántara. Believing Mayne's troops to be a serious threat, Victor marched against him. The Loyal Lusitanian Legion battalion defended the Alcántara Bridge for three hours. Then, the French artillery silenced their guns and a supporting battalion of militia took to its heels. The bridge was mined, but when Mayne ordered the charges to be detonated, its heavy construction withstood the explosion. Victor's infantry then rushed the incompletely demolished span. The French hung around the area for a few days but finally withdrew. The next action was the Battle of Talavera. Background=Second invasion of Portugal= The First invasion of Portugal in 1807 resulted in the French occupation of that nation. This episode came to an end on 21 August 1808 when the invaders were defeated by Sir Arthur Wellesley's British army at the Battle of Vimeiro. Anxious to quickly liberate Portugal, the victorious British generals concluded the Convention of Cintra in which the French occupying army was transported back to France by British ships. Sir John Moore and his British army departed from Portugal in October 1808, intending to help the Spanish nation throw off Emperor Napoleon's yoke. Moore's expedition ended with his death at the Battle of Corunna on 16 January 1809. Nevertheless, his army won a tactical victory over the pursuing French, allowing the soldiers to be evacuated by the British navy. Napoleon's strategy for early 1809 called for an invasion of Portugal by three columns. He ordered Marshal Nicolas Soult's 20,000 troops to advance from the north, General of Division Pierre Belon Lapisse's 9,000 men to come in from the northeast, and Marshal Claude Victor's soldiers to march from the east. Napoleon's plan called for Soult to capture Porto (Oporto) by 5 February 1809. From there, Soult was supposed to march to Lisbon and occupy it by the 16th of the same month. Meanwhile, Lapisse was directed to move from Salamanca to seize Ciudad Rodrigo and Almeida, Portugal as soon as Soult's II Corps got to Porto. Victor was ordered to be at Mérida by this time. He was instructed to detach a column from there to advance on Lisbon. The emperor expected that Soult, Lapisse, and Victor would readily be able to send messengers to each other, and easily coordinate their operations. This assumption ignored the likelihood that Portuguese and Spanish guerillas would prevent Soult's dispatches from reaching his colleagues. Soult marched south on 30 January 1809, aiming for Portugal. After being repelled in his initial attempt to cross the Minho River in mid-February, his forces marched to Ourense and crossed the bridge there. Soult's cavalry crushed a Spanish brigade at La Trepa on 6 March and the II Corps entered Portugal on the 9th. At the Battle of Braga on 20 March, the French routed a Portuguese army consisting of a few regulars and 22,000 militia. The First Battle of Porto on the 29th was another lopsided French victory marked by terrible Portuguese loss of life. But despite being established in Porto, Soult found his communications cut by regular and irregular Portuguese forces under General Francisco Silveira and he had no idea of the whereabouts of Lapisse. =Other operations= Meanwhile, Marshal Victor won a resounding victory over General Gregorio García de la Cuesta's Spanish army at the Battle of Medellín on 28 March 1809. Though he went on to occupy Mérida, Victor complained in dispatches to King Joseph Bonaparte that he lacked the strength to invade Portugal. He requested the return of Lapisse's division, but was initially refused. Robert T. Wilson Moore's departure with the main British forces left Portugal defended by a scanty garrison under Sir John Cradock. As Cradock prepared to abandon Portugal, a number of his officers were outspoken in their desire to resist the French. Colonel Robert Thomas Wilson and 1,200 Portuguese regulars of the Loyal Lusitanian Legion were stationed in the northeast near Almeida. Wilson refused to obey Cradock's order to withdraw. Instead, he garrisoned Almeida with part of his force and, with the remainder, began to vigorously harass Lapisse's oncoming division. Believing that he faced 12,000 enemies, Lapisse's offensive ground to a halt. When Wilson occupied the Puerto de Baños, breaking communications between Lapisse and Victor, it was the last straw. Victor finally secured permission to take control of Lapisse's division. Victor ordered Lapisse to move south and join him. En route, the French soldiers pillaged Alcántara. On 22 April, Wellesley assumed command of the British army in Portugal, which was quickly reinforced to 23,000 men. Facing widely separated French opponents, Wellesley decided to attack Soult first while observing Victor. The advance northward directly against Soult was allotted 18,500 troops. A 6,000-man flanking column under William Carr Beresford would cooperate with Silveira's force. To observe Victor to the east, Major General Alexander Randoll Mackenzie was given 12,000 soldiers. Mackenzie watched the Portuguese frontier, based at Abrantes. The British element of this force included Brigadier General Henry Fane's 1,304-saber British cavalry brigade, Mackenzie's 2,709-man British infantry brigade, and Captain May's 315-strong Royal Artillery battery. The 3rd Dragoon Guards and the 4th Dragoons were the mounted units while the 2nd Battalion of the 24th Foot, 3rd Battalion of the 27th Foot, 2nd Battalion of the 31st Foot, and the 1st Battalion of the 41st Foot were the infantry. The Portuguese contingent consisted of a cavalry brigade, an infantry brigade, and two artillery batteries. Five squadrons of the 3rd and 4th Dragoons made up the cavalry brigade. The infantry brigade comprised the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 3rd, 4th, 13th, and 15th Line Regiments, the 1st Battalion of the 1st Regiment, and the 1st, 4th, and 5th Caçadores Battalions. Battle Claude Perrin Victor Wellington ordered Colonel William Mayne's 1st Battalion of the Loyal Lusitanian Legion, the Idanha Militia Battalion, and six Legion guns to serve as an outpost to Mackenzie's corps. The approximately 2,000 Portuguese came down from the mountains to the north, crossed into Spain and moved into Alcántara. The old Roman bridge across the Tagus River at Alcántara linked northern and central Extremadura. Believing that Mayne's detachment was the spearhead of an offensive, Victor set out on 11 May to deal with the presumed threat. The division with Victor was commanded by Lapisse. The 2nd Division of the I Corps consisted of three battalions each of the 16th Light Infantry Regiment and the 8th, 45th, and 54th Line Infantry Regiments. Including eight squadrons in one brigade of dragoons, Victor's force numbered 9,500 men and 12 guns. The horsemen belonged to General of Division Marie Victor de Fay, marquis de Latour-Maubourg's 1st Dragoon Division, which consisted of the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 9th, 14th, and 26th Dragoons. One authority wrote that Mayne's total of 1,850 men included one squadron of Legion cavalry and only two artillery pieces. On 14 May, Victor's column came into contact with Mayne's outposts at Brozas and rapidly drove them back. Mayne made no attempt to defend the town of Alcántara, which was located on the south bank of the Tagus. Rather, he entrenched his troops on the north bank, mined and barricaded the bridge. Taking in the situation, Victor decided to soften up his opponent's defenses before sending in his infantry. The French artillery and infantry began firing across the river at Mayne's Portuguese. The defenders resisted stoutly for three hours. Around noon, the Portuguese militia panicked and ran away. Mayne then ordered the charges on the bridge to be detonated. After the smoke from the explosion cleared away it was discovered that the tough old bridge was still intact. One side of the arch was gone, but the span was still standing. By this time, the French artillery had succeeded in dismounting one of Mayne's cannons and silencing the rest. Victor ordered one of Lapisse's brigades to rush the bridge. When the French soldiers managed to brave the defensive fire and gain a foothold on the north bank, Mayne ordered a retreat to the Salvaterra Pass. Result The 1,000-man battalion of the Loyal Lusitanian Legion sustained losses of three officers and 103 men killed, five officers and 143 men wounded, and 15 men missing. Militia losses were not stated. The dismounted gun was abandoned. French losses are unknown. Victor saw for himself that Mayne's small force was not the threat he had supposed. The French pressed only a few miles beyond Alcántara, but this alarmed Mackenzie who believed he was about to be attacked. Wellesley reassured his subordinate that he had nothing to worry about, that Victor could not spare enough soldiers to present a real threat to his position behind the Zêzere River. After spending three days near Alcántara, Victor withdrew to Torremocha. While Victor was away, Cuesta sent a force against Mérida. The raid failed to dislodge two battalions of Jean Francois Leval's German division from a fortified convent.

Deposed during the battle of Caseros, he spent his later life in exile in Southampton, England, where he died on March 14, 1877. He was buried at the Southampton Old Cemetery, and after a number of failed attempts he was repatriated to Argentina and taken to La Recoleta Cemetery, his current grave location.Johnson, pp. 108-122. Chapter Four: \\"The Repatriation of Juan Manuel de Rosas\\" By Jeffrey M. Shumway. Death Juan Manuel de Rosas was the Governor of Buenos Aires Province from 1829 to 1832 and 1835 to 1852. He's also famous for defeating an Anglo-French invasion during the Battle of Vuelta de Obligado in 1845. At the time the country fought many civil wars between Federals and Unitarians, Rosas being a federal leader. He was ousted from power by Justo José de Urquiza, governor of the Entre Ríos Province, at the battle of Caseros. Defeated, he was rescued by a British warship and moved to Southampton, where he stayed the rest of his life.Johnson, pp. 108-111 (ibidem). He died on March 14, 1877, and he was buried at the Southampton Old Cemetery. Fearing pro-Rosas demonstrations, the Argentine government forbid any commemoration in his honour, and made instead a mass for the people that died during Rosas's government.Johnson, p. 113 (ibidem). With Rosas out of the country, the Unitarians returned to Buenos Aires. They sought to erase or denigrate the legacy of Rosas, confiscated their property and charged him with high treason. Bartolomé Mitre, who fought in Caseros, did so with the first histographic works of Argentina, with a high negative bias against Rosas and other caudillos.Johnson, pp. 111-112 This historiographical perspective was soon confronted by the end of the 19th century by revisionist scholars like Adolfo Saldías and Ernesto Quesada, who described Rosas under a positive light. Repatriation projects Rosas memorial in Southampton Old Cemetery. Anticipating the controversy, Rosas wrote in his will that \\"once my country recognizes, along with its government, the justice owed me by my services\\", then his body shall be returned to Argentina. Revisionism kept growing, specially in the 1920s and 1930s. The 1930s saw the establishment of the Pro- Repatriation of Rosas Committee.Johnson, p. 114 Revisionist authors got state recognition during the Revolution of '43 (the United Kingdom was fighting World War II at that time) and lost it during the first presidencies of Juan Perón, as Perón tried to avoid ideological disputes.Devoto, pp. 268-271 Perón was deposed in 1955 by the Revolución Libertadora military coup and sent to exile, and Peronism was proscribed. Perón became a supporter of revisionism in the 1960s, and helped Manuel de Anchorena in the renewed efforts of the Committee.Johnson, pp. 114-115 Perón returned from exile and became president in 1973. He appointed Anchorena ambassador in England, and instructed him to negotiate the repatriation of Rosas's body. Great Britain authorized it, and the Argentine Congress passed a resolution for this purpose. The repatriation was imminent, but the country began a period of turmoil: Perón died in 1974, his wife Isabel Perón could not keep the Dirty War under control (a conflict between left-wing guerrillas and right-wing anti-communist groups), and a new military coup, the National Reorganization Process, deposed Isabel Perón. It is unknown if the repatriation was paused by the military or by the committee.Johnson, pp. 115-116 The military left in 1983, and Raúl Alfonsín became the new president. He did not take action to resume the repatriation.Johnson, pp. 116-117 Final repatriation Alfonsín was followed by Peronist Carlos Menem in 1989, amid an economic crisis. Menem announced that the main task of his presidency would be the national reconciliation, the end of the dichotomies that once plagued the country. In the case of Rosas, he claimed that he wanted to be \\"the president of Rosas and Sarmiento\\", of \\"Mitre and Quiroga\\". Both pairs were historical enemies, and Menem sought to end those conflicts. With those ideas in mind, Menem gave the final boost to the repatriation project. The body would be taken from the cemetery, placed in a new coffin in France, and them moved by plane to Argentina.Johnson, pp. 119-120 There were projects to place the coffin in the Buenos Aires Cathedral, next to the one of José de San Martín, but a 1982 papal regulation forbid to bury people in cathedrals except for popes, archbishops and cardinals. The committee attempted to bypass the regulation, to no avail. As a result, it was placed in La Recoleta Cemetery instead.Johnson, pp. 120-121 The body was received in France with the honours of a head of state: red carpet, full military honours and the flag at half staff. In Argentina, the newspaper La Nación (founded by Bartolomé Mitre) declared that it was not against the repatriation.Johnson, p. 122 The huge procession took place on September 30, 1989, and had the presence of both descendants of Rosas and descendants of Rosas's enemies, who marched together in peace.Johnson, p. 105 NotesReferences  External links * Speech of Carlos Saúl Menem, at the city of Rosario, about the repatriation of Juan Manuel de Rosas's body Category:Juan Manuel de Rosas Category:Presidency of Carlos Menem Category:Art and cultural repatriation Category:1989 in Argentina ","title":"Repatriation of Juan Manuel de Rosas's body"},{"id":"38193917","text":"List of musical instruments of Nepal * Bansuri, a bamboo flute, a murali * Baya * Binayo * Dafali * Daha * Damaha, a nagara * Damaru * Damaru, a KantanDabDab * Damphu * Dapa-Khin * Dhah * Dhimay * Dholak * Dhyāngro, a frame drum used by jhakri (shamans) and Buddhist musicians * Ek tare * Gan * Ghangling * Girnal * Handiya * Horel * Hudko * Ilambu * Irlung pipari * Jhajhar * Jhyali * Jhyamta, a jhurma * Kaha * Kangling * Karnal * Khainjadi * Khin * Khusyaha * Koncha-Khin * kumuna * Lawa * Leaf, leaf of tree used to create sharp music mostly in rural areas of Nepal. * Madal * Magah-Khin * Masak * mujura * Murchunga * Nagara * Narsingha * Naya-Khin * Neeko * Paluwa * Paschima * Pasta-Khin * Piwancha * Ponga * Sanai * Sarangi * Shankha * Sringa * Tabala * Tahinahi * TainNain * Tinimuni * Tungana * Tunguna * Tyampko * Urni * Urni * Yalambar Nepal ","title":"List of Nepali musical instruments"},{"id":"38193926","title":"1833 Pennsylvania's 1st congressional district special election"},{"id":"38193951","text":"Acantholiparis is a genus of snailfishes native to the northern Pacific Ocean.

At EMI Sykes developed the first in-house artist strategic marketing department to work hand-in-hand with record companies to develop artists’ careers. =VH1= In April 1994 Sykes returned to MTV Networks/Viacom] as President of the VH1 Cable Television Network. During his eight-year term as head of the network, he rebranded VH1 as a music and pop culture channel targeted to affluent 20+ demographics, repositioned the channel as VH1: Music First and created long-form franchises such as VH1’s “Behind the Music,” “VH1 Storytellers,” and “Pop-Up Video,” as well as franchised event programs like the “VH1/Vogue Fashion Awards” and “VH1 Honors.” Sykes led the cable network to record audience ratings, revenues and profits for all eight years. While at VH1 Sykes created the “VH1 Save The Music Foundation,” a non-profit organization dedicated to rebuilding music education programs in public schools across the country. “VH1 Save The Music” drew the support of President Bill Clinton, himself a student of music, and then-First Lady Hillary Clinton, who visited schools in support of the initiative and hosted VH1’s 1999 “Concert of the Century” on the South Lawn at the White House.

The building was designed by Frost & Granger in 1909; it was mainly designed in the Beaux Arts style but also exhibits elements of the Italian Renaissance Revival style. Construction on the building finished in 1911, the same year the terminal opened. The irregularly shaped building borders Clinton Street, Milwaukee Avenue, Lake Street, and the former Chicago and North Western tracks, which are now used by Metra for its Union Pacific District. The power house was built in cream brick with terra cotta trim, cornices, and ornamentation; the corner of the house at Clinton and Milwaukee features a brick smokestack. The building contained four rooms, a large engine room and boiler room and a smaller engineer's office and reception room. The Chicago Tribune reported in 1948 that the power house output enough power to serve a city of 15,000 people. The power house ceased to serve the station in the 1960s, but when the terminal was demolished and replaced by Ogilvie Transportation Center in 1984, the power house survived. It is one of two remaining railroad power houses in Chicago and the only remaining power house for the Chicago and North Western. The power house was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 10, 2004. It was designated as a Chicago Landmark on January 11, 2006.

Although no precise estimates exist, the number of French soldiers captured during the Battle of France between May and June 1940 is generally recognised around 1.8 million, equivalent to around 10 percent of the total adult male population of France at the time. After a brief period of captivity in France, most of the prisoners were deported to Germany. In Germany, prisoners were incarcerated in Stalag or Oflag prison camps, according to rank, but the vast majority were soon transferred to work details (Kommandos) working in German agriculture or industry. Colonial prisoners, however, remained in camps in France with poor living conditions as a result of Nazi racial ideologies. During negotiations for the Armistice of 22 June 1940, the Vichy French government adopted a policy of collaboration in hopes for German concessions allowing repatriation. The Germans nevertheless deferred the return of prisoners until the negotiation of a final peace treaty, which never occurred due to the United Kingdom's refusal to surrender and Germany's defeat in the Battle of Britain. The absence of a large proportion of the male population of France also had important consequences on the position of women in occupied France and charity fundraising on behalf of the prisoners played an important role in French daily life until late in the occupation. Limited repatriation of certain classes of POWs did occur from 1940 and the government was keen to encourage the return of prisoners, even launching the unpopular relève system in order to exchange prisoners of war for French labourers going to work in Germany. Nevertheless, many prisoners remained in German captivity until the defeat of Germany in 1945. Prisoners who returned to France, either by repatriation or through escaping, generally found themselves stigmatised by the French civilian population and received little official recognition. Background A French Char B1 tank destroyed during the fighting in May 1940 In September 1939, Britain and France declared war on Germany following the German invasion of Poland. The Anglo-French Supreme War Council decided to stay on the defensive along the border, relying on the Maginot Line in helping counter an anticipated German offensive across the German-French border. As neither side made any offensive moves, a Drôle de Guerre (Phoney War) developed as both sides stood-off along the border. On 10 May 1940, the Germans launched the invasion of France through neutral Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. The rapid German advance, using the new Blitzkrieg doctrine, outflanked the Allied forces and advanced rapidly into France. By the end of May, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had surrendered and the British were evacuating their forces from Dunkirk. In total, around 100,000 French soldiers were killed in action. German forces reached Paris on 14 June. The trauma from the German victories caused a period of division within the government of the Third Republic. German commanders finally met with French officials on 18 June who sought a cessation of hostilities, with the goal being an armistice with Germany. Chief among the new government leaders was the new Prime Minister, Marshal Philippe Pétain, a French war hero of World War I and often known simply as \\"The Marshal\\" (Le Maréchal). On 22 June, the Second Armistice at Compiègne was signed between France and Germany ending hostilities. Northern and western France was placed under German occupation, while Alsace-Lorraine was placed under direct German administration, in essence becoming a de facto part of Germany although it was never formally annexed. Italy would occupy its own zone in the southeast, with the rest of Metropolitan France being an unoccupied zone, the zone libre. The armistice called for the whole of Metropolitan France except Alsace-Lorraine to be governed by the newly formed Vichy government (État Français) led by Pétain, although in practice Pétain's authority in the occupied zones was very limited. Vichy was nominally independent, and still controlled French overseas colonies, but in practice was essentially a German client state. Prisoners of war of Germany By the time of the armistice on 22 June, approximately 1.8 million French soldiers were in captivity; a figure representing roughly 10 percent of the total adult male population of France at the time. One of the terms of the Compiègne Armistice was that French prisoners would remain in German custody until the end of the war which was thought to be imminent. French prisoners came from all backgrounds, regions and civilian occupations within France and also included a substantial number of soldiers from the French colonial empire. Nevertheless, approximately a third of all French prisoners of war were French farmers or peasants and, in some regions, the total proportion of agricultural workers captured was much higher. This created labour shortages in many civilian occupations, particularly agriculture which was largely unmechanised. During the interwar period, France had experienced considerable immigration from elsewhere in Europe. In particular, a large number of Poles and Spanish republicans, who had emigrated to France, subsequently served in the French army and were captured by the Germans. These foreign prisoners were often singled out for worse treatment. In 1944 and 1945, as the German situation deteriorated, provision of food to POW camps became more sporadic and starvation became a problem. As Soviet troops advanced westwards, camps in the east were evacuated and moved on foot, in so-called death marches, away from the front in extremely poor conditions. =Prison camps= View of a German prison camp, Stalag VIII-A, in Görlitz Initially most French prisoners were detained in France, but after repeated escapes, the Germans decided to move the vast majority to new camps in Germany and Eastern Europe. Conditions in camps varied considerably geographically and over time. Conditions were particularly poor in the summer of 1940, when facilities proved insufficient to accommodate the large number of new POWs, and in the particularly cold winter that same year. Gradually, as prisoners were repatriated, relieving overcrowding, conditions generally improved. From 1943, however, as the war on the Eastern Front turned against Germany, conditions worsened and the food supply became more precarious. Some camps were purpose-built, like Stalag II-D, but others could be former barracks, asylums or fortresses. Prisoners were generally divided into camp by rank. Officers, given different status to other ranks, were imprisoned in Oflags (short for Offizierslager or \\"Officers' Camp\\") while NCOs and other ranks were imprisoned in Stalags (or Stammlager, \\"Main Camp\\"). Each Stalag included numerous Arbeitskommandos (work unit) outside the camp itself, some of which could be hundreds of kilometers away. The vast majority of prisoners ( 93 percent) were not confined behind barbed wire, but instead worked in German factories or in farms, sometimes without guards. Prisoners arriving in camps were divided into groups by the Germans. Mostly, this consisted of bringing soldiers of similar backgrounds (Communists, Jews or Bretons) together for administrative purposes and to limit their interaction with other prisoners. Although this sorting of soldiers generally occurred on a small scale only, a camp was established at Lübeck for French prisoners dubbed \\"enemies of the Reich\\", where they could be detained in isolation. Prisoners considered rebellious, however, were often sent to special camps in which conditions were extremely poor. =Daily life= Within Stalags and Oflags, prisoners had substantial amounts of leisure time. Letters and parcels from home could take months to arrive in camps and be distributed by the Red Cross; consequently, most had little regular contact with their families. The Red Cross also provided food, books, sports equipment and musical instruments, as well as information and letters. Thanks to the access to books, the historian Fernand Braudel wrote most of his influential work La Méditerranée et le monde méditerranéen à l'époque de Philippe II (1949), which established the analytical concept of the longue durée, while in captivity in Germany. Reconstructed living quarters of French prisoners at Roscheider Hof Open Air Museum near Trier Numerous clubs, bands, sports teams and societies operated within the camps. In Stalag IX-A, French prisoners established both symphony and jazz orchestras and a choir. An informal \\"temporary university\\" was also established in the same camp. The future French President François Mitterrand delivered a series of lectures on the ancien régime to his fellow prisoners in another camp. Jean-Paul Sartre also delivered lectures on philosophy. Drama was also extremely popular and, despite only having very limited resources, numerous plays were staged. Politically, the prisoners of war in Germany were given virtually more freedom than civilians in occupied France. In accordance with the Geneva Conventions, French prisoners elected hommes de confiance (Men of trust) from among their number to represent their interests. The Germans attempted to encourage prisoners to adopt Nazi or collaborationist ideologies, even supporting the creation of a pro-German newspaper, Le Trait d'Union, for prisoners and pro- Vichy Cercles Pétain groups existed in many separate camps. Although Pétain was generally supported by the prisoners, Pierre Laval who was Petain's de facto Prime Minister was extremely unpopular. Laval's re-promotion in 1942 following his dismissal in December 1940, together with the failure of his Relève system, widely undermined support for Vichy among prisoners. =Work and forced labour= southern France, 1942 Most French prisoners of war were not held in camps for most of the war, but instead, over 93 percent of French prisoners of war lived and worked on Kommandos of work details. Under the terms of the Geneva Convention NCOs were, like officers, exempted from work during captivity, but Germans often forced them to work. Workers were fed but virtually their entire wages were paid directly to the German army and prisoners were only allowed to retain 70 pfennigs per day. Work Kommandos were very variable, but those in agriculture were generally considered better than ones in factories or mining, where conditions were worse and prisoners were vulnerable to Allied bombing raids. In rural areas of Germany, French prisoners replaced locals conscripted into the German army as agricultural labourers. Guarding Kommandos came to be regarded as an unnecessary waste of manpower - it was thought unlikely that a prisoner would attempt to escape in a country where he did not know the language. This meant that, in practice, prisoners were allowed a wider measure of freedom compared to the camps. They were often viewed with curiosity by the German rural population, and the French prisoners were often allowed to mix quite freely with German civilians. Although unlawful, many French prisoners began relationships with German women. =African and Arab prisoners= Around 120,000 prisoners from the French colonies were captured during the Battle of France. Most of these troops, around two-thirds, came from the French North African possessions of Tunisia, Morocco and, particularly, Algeria. Around 20 percent were from French West Africa. The rest were from Madagascar and Indochina. Influenced by Nazi racial ideology, German troops summarily killed between 1,000 and 1,500 black prisoners during the Battle of France. Among those captured who narrowly escaped execution was Léopold Sédar Senghor, an academic who would become the first President of independent Senegal in 1960. French colonial prisoners from French West Africa photographed in May 1940 Unlike their white compatriots, the colonial prisoners of war were imprisoned in Frontstalags in France rather than being brought to Germany. By keeping colonial soldiers in France on the pretext of preventing the spread of tropical diseases, the Germans also wanted to prevent the \\"racial defilement\\" (Rassenschande) of German women outlawed by the Nuremberg Laws of 1935. Black troops were treated worse than their white compatriots, and some of them were used for \\"degrading\\" anthropological experiments or subjects of medical testing into diseases. Although the living conditions for black soldiers gradually improved, they were still considerably lower than those of white French soldiers. The mortality rate among black soldiers was also considerably higher. Some colonial troops were repatriated before the end of the war. Around 10,000 North African prisoners were released in 1941. Escapes and repatriations reduced the number of colonial prisoners of war to 30,000 by July 1944. With the Allied advance through France in 1944, between 10–12,000 prisoners were transported to Stalags in Germany where they were held until the end of the war. Former colonial prisoners of war were demobilised in 1944 but received less compensation that their white counterparts. A mutiny among former prisoners at Thiaroye in French Senegal on 30 November 1944 was repressed with violence. Other prisoners of war During the Battle of the Alps, 154 French soldiers were captured by the Italians. These prisoners were forgotten during the armistice negotiations, and the final agreement makes no mention of them. They were held at the POW camp in Fonte d'Amore in Sulmona, along with 600 Greeks and 200 Britons, treated, by all accounts, in accordance with the laws of war. Their fate is unknown after Italy's armistice with the Allies, when they presumably came under German control. The Allies captured 38,000 Vichy French soldiers in the Syria–Lebanon campaign in June 1941. The prisoners of war were offered the choice of joining the Free French or being repatriated to France. Only 5,668 men volunteered to join the Free French; the remainder chose to be repatriated. According to a statement given by Winston Churchill to the House of Commons on 10 November 1942, \\"upwards of 1,000 prisoners\\" loyal to Vichy were taken by the British during October in the Madagascar campaign. The intention of the British was again to repatriate those POWs who did not wish to join the Free French, perhaps in exchange for British officers interned in France. Repatriation=Wartime repatriation= Initially, following the armistice, it was rumoured that all French troops would be soon returned by the Germans. Petain tasked Georges Scapini, a World War I veteran and a pro- German member of the Chamber of Deputies, to negotiate the release of hostages. Scapini initially argued to the Germans that the transfer of prisoners as a goodwill gesture would ensure French public support for the Axis occupation and the Vichy regime. From his contacts with the German Ambassador Otto Abetz and Hermann Reinecke of the OKW, however, he realized that the prisoners were to be used as a bargaining chip to ensure French collaboration, and that a full transfer of French prisoners would be impossible. After the expulsion of 100,000 Jews from Lorraine was ordered by its Gauleiter Josef Bürckel, Hitler would make the concession of allowing France to assume the protecting power for its own prisoners of war. This was also because the previous protecting power of France, the United States, began to sympathize with Britain and after its diplomatic staff became too small to conduct routine inspections of German prison camps. From the autumn of 1940, the Germans began to repatriate French reservists whose private occupations were in short supply in Vichy France, such as medical workers like doctors and nurses along with postmen and gendarmes. In 1941, after lobbying by the Vichy government, the policy was extended to French veterans of World War I and fathers of four or more children. Individual prisoners with good contacts could also be requested for repatriation. In practice, this meant that a disproportionate number of prisoners who were released early came from the upper classes. In 1941, the Germans introduced the Flamenpolitik, intended to divide German-occupied Belgium by favouring Dutch speakers over French ones. In February 1941, repatriation of Flemish prisoners began. At the time, Dutch dialects were still widely spoken in French Flanders and, although Belgian prisoners were primarily targeted by the policy, some French prisoners were also released as a result. The reintegration of French prisoners into civilian life was facilitated by a network of Maisons du Prisonnier (Prisoner Houses), established across France, which would help them readjust and find work. Generally, prisoners generally found it easy to regain their pre-war jobs because of the shortage of labour. The government had hoped that returning prisoners of war would be more sympathetic to the Vichy regime, but prisoners coming back were not noticeably more loyal to Vichy than other groups. The relève (1942) The relève (relief) was a policy championed by Pierre Laval in which, in exchange for French workers volunteering to work in Germany, a proportional number of prisoners would be released. The policy was announced in June 1942 and soon became extremely unpopular and divisive across French society, and among the prisoners themselves. The Vichy government had originally hoped that a much greater number of prisoners would be released under the scheme, but the Germans refused to repatriate prisoners in the proportions which Vichy had suggested. In the end, around 100,000 prisoners were repatriated under the scheme. Many, however, were old or sick prisoners who the Germans were often keen to release from custody in any event due to their inability to work (and who technically should have been released under earlier quotas) rather than peasant soldiers portrayed by Vichy propaganda. The failure of the relève to attract sufficient numbers of French workers led to its abandonment in favour of the forced Service du travail obligatoire (STO; \\"Obligatory Work Service\\") in 1943. Transformation (1943) The implementation of forced labour deportations from France was accompanied by a new policy in 1943. For every French worker who arrived in Germany, one POW could be \\"transformed\\" into a \\"free worker\\" (travailleur libre). Prisoners had the option and could choose to be transformed from being a prisoner of war to become a free worker in a German factory. Around 221,000 prisoners joined the scheme. The policy benefited the Germans, for whom the prisoners were a good source of extra labour, but it meant they were also able to transfer to the front German soldiers guarding POW camps, freeing 30,000 of them as a result of the policy. =Escape= Although the exact number of French prisoners who escaped from captivity in Germany is unknown, it has been estimated at around 70,000, representing approximately five per cent of all French prisoners. The Vichy government did not encourage prisoners to escape, but many of its officials were sympathetic to escapees who reached French territory. Some prisoners, particularly those working in agriculture, spent substantial amounts of time without guards, and prisoners caught by the Germans trying to escape were rarely severely punished. During the period of detention in France, fines were sometimes imposed on locals for mass escapes of prisoners in the region. It was partially to prevent escapes that led to the German decision to deport prisoners to the Reich. As sick prisoners were often repatriated, many faked illness in an attempt to return home. From 1941, when those in certain occupations were repatriated, others produced fake identification documents to enable them to be released. Among the escapees was Henri Giraud, a French General who had commanded a division in 1940, who escaped from Königstein prison and, despite his pro-Vichy sympathies, joined the Free French in 1943. Jean-Paul Sartre also managed to escape by forging papers demonstrating that he had a disability, leading to his repatriation. Effects in occupied France=Vichy and prisoner of war relief= Prisoners were often depicted as martyrs in propaganda. Here, St Paul's captivity is compared to that of the French prisoners. The continued imprisonment of French soldiers was a major theme in Vichy propaganda. Prisoners of war featured in the programme of moral rejuvenation promised as part of the Révolution nationale (National Revolution). A recurring idea was the idea of prisoners of war as martyrs or penitents, suffering in order to redeem France from its pre-war excesses. The period of detainment was therefore depicted as a form of purification which would overcome internal divides within France and atone for the defeat of 1940. The government sponsored numerous initiatives aimed at improving conditions or achieving repatriation. At the request of the Vichy government, Georges Scapini, a deputy and World War I veteran, was appointed to lead a committee to monitor the treatment of French prisoners in Germany. Scapini's Service Diplomatique des Prisonniers de Guerre (Diplomatic Service of Prisoners of War; SDPG) was given responsibility to negotiate with the German authorities in all matters concerning prisoners of war. A government-backed national fund-raising campaign was run by the Secours National (National Aid) for the benefit of French prisoners. Among other activities, the Secours ran a week-long campaign nationally in 1941. At a local level, many communities ran independent initiatives to raise money for their local community's prisoners, often organised around communities or churches, which held prayer days for POWs. These campaigns were immensely successful, and despite German restrictions on public gatherings, French civilians were able to raise large collections from lotteries and sponsored sports matches. These local prisoner relief schemes were \\"among the greatest stimulants of sociability under the occupation\\" and helped to foster a sense of community. Infighting along political and social lines did however occur in local aid committees, and there were also numerous cases of corruption and theft from local funds. Later in the war, the Vichy government increasingly tried to take control of local fund-raising, but this was often resisted by the local groups themselves. In order to show solidarity with their relations in France, prisoners also raised funds among themselves to send back to their native regions if they had been targeted by Allied strategic bombing or food shortages. =Effect on gender relations= Initially, there was considerable confusion among families with members serving in the army. It took several months for relations and friends to discover the fate of their relatives and name of casualties. Initially, only very few prisoners, usually those working in important civilian industries, were sent back to France. For wives and families of prisoners of war, life under the occupation was particularly hard. In pre-war France, the husband was generally the household's chief wage earner, so many households saw a sharp drop in income and living standards. Only very small allowances were made by the government to families of POWs, which was not sufficient to offset the economic difficulties caused. The large proportion of men in prisoner of war camps changed the gender balance in jobs. Many women took over running family farms and businesses, and others were forced to look for employment. The prisoners of war also posed a big problem for Vichy's policy of moral rejuvenation summarised in its motto Travail, famille, patrie (Work, family, homeland). From October 1940, Vichy attempted to limit women's access to work which had particular effects on prisoners' families. Because of the emphasis on family values under Vichy, the government was especially worried about infidelity among the wives of prisoners in Germany. Concerned about prisoners' wives having babies, the law of 15 February 1942 made abortion a treasonable offence that carried the death penalty. For having administered 27 abortions, Marie-Louise Giraud was guillotined on 30 July 1942. In December 1942, a law was issued making cohabitation with wives of prisoners of war illegal. The government also made divorce much harder and officially made adultery an insufficient reason for legal separation in order to stop suspicious POWs divorcing their wives in France. Wives of prisoners who had had affairs were also often demonised by their local communities who considered it equivalent to prostitution. Generally, however, Vichy's moral legislation had little real effect. Aftermath and legacy From the early repatriations, returned prisoners were generally treated with pity, suspicion and disdain by French civilians. Many believed that they had only been allowed to return in exchange for agreeing to collaborate. Later Vichy propaganda had implied that prisoners lived in good conditions, so many civilians believed that the prisoners had suffered much less than civilians during the conflict. As veterans of the 1940 Battle of France, the prisoners were blamed for the French defeat and portrayed as cowards who had surrendered, rather than fight to the death. They were also unfavourably compared with other men of their generation who had served in the Free French Forces or Resistance. Prisoners had little effect on the resistance in France. Initially there were three resistance networks based around repatriated prisoners split along political lines, but in March 1944, the three merged to form the National Movement of Prisoners of War and Deportees. After the war, there was a decade-long period of divisive debate about whether POWs should be considered as veterans, therefore making them eligible for a veteran's card with its accompanying benefits, but this was not resolved until the 1950s. A national organization of former prisoners was established, under the name Fédération nationale des combattants prisonniers de guerre (National Federation of Prisoner of War Veterans), which campaigned for the rights of former POWs. French prisoners were banned by a court from referring to themselves as \\"deportees\\" which had been exclusively applied to political prisoners and Holocaust victims. No medal for prisoners was ever established, although the Médaille des Évadés (Escapees' Medal) was awarded to almost 30,000 prisoners who had escaped from camps in Germany.

The unincorporated settlement runs parallel to the Kootenay River beside Highway 3/93.  History  Wardner began development in 1897 after Jim Wardner sold 144 acres to Simon and William Guggenheim. The two brothers built a smelter on the property and divided the remaining land into smaller sized lots, thus starting a boom town. In 1901 Jay A. Humphreys built a planer and saw mill to process the local lumber harvested from the area. Steamboats were used to move materials and people to the other local towns up until 1909 when a road bridge was built across the Kootenay River. Up until the early 1930s the town was thriving. It had two hotels, a couple general stores, an ice cream parlor, a barber shop, a drug store, a golf course, three schools, two churches, a cemetery, a post office, and a police station. In 1931 a fire erupted in the saw mill which ceased its operations temporarily. A depression then hit the town, with more random fires occurring. Many of the businesses were shut down and people were out of jobs; however, the mill began operating again and changed ownership multiple times until it was finally sold in 1962 for parts. With the construction of the Libby Dam, the Canadian Pacific Railway rerouted the tracks to go through Fort Steele instead of Wardner and the highway was moved upriver away from the town due to the water level of the reservoir.

Ordinarily, it was a reference to the one of the Nine Provinces which modern Xuzhou inherited.  History =Pre-Qin era= Xuzhou or Xu Province was one of the Nine Provinces of ancient China mentioned in Chinese historical texts such as the Tribute of Yu, Erya and Rites of Zhou. The Yu Gong [Tribute of Yu] records: \\"The Sea, Mount Dai (ancient name of Mount Tai), and the Huai River served as the boundaries of Xuzhou.\\"English translation of the quoted Chinese text from the Yu Gong. While the definition of Xuzhou is more brief in Erya: \\"Where is located in the east of Ji River\\". Based on these descriptions, the ancient Xuzhou covered an area that roughly corresponds to the regions in modern southeastern Shandong (south of Mount Tai) and northern Jiangsu (north of the Huai River). =Han dynasty= late Eastern Han dynasty period, 189 CE. In 106 BCE, during the reign of Emperor Wu (r. 141–87 BCE) in the Western Han dynasty (206 BCE – 9 CE), China was divided into 13 administrative divisions or provinces (excluding the capital Chang'an and seven commanderies in its vicinity), each governed by a cishi (; Inspector). 11 of them were named after the Nine Provinces mentioned in the historical texts Classic of History and Rites of Zhou. Xuzhou was one of the 11, and it covered parts of Jiangsu (north of the Yangtze River) and southeastern Shandong. In the Eastern Han dynasty (25–220 CE), Xuzhou's capital was set up at Tan (; present-day Tancheng County, Linyi, Shandong). =Three Kingdoms period and Jin dynasty= During the Three Kingdoms period (220–280), Xuzhou was a territory of the state of Cao Wei (220–265), and its capital was moved to Pengcheng (; present- day Xuzhou, Jiangsu). The area of Xuzhou shrunk slightly as its southern border with Sun Wu. After the fall of the Western Jin (265–316) due to the Wu Hu uprising, the Jin remnants fled to southern China and established the Eastern Jin (317–420). To govern the people from northern who relocated in the south of the Huai River, While its area shrunk again. Its capital was variable, it moved to Xiapi (; present-day Suining, Jiangsu), Shanyang (; present-day Huai'an District, Jiangsu), Guangling (; present-day Yangzhou, Jiangsu) and Jingkou (; present-day Zhenjiang, Jiangsu) at different stages. Since its capital moved to the south of the Yangtze River, where had never been a part of its area, Xuzhou became a migrated province. = Sixteen Kingdoms and Southern and Northern Dynasties period = In the Sixteen Kingdoms period, Xuzhou was divided between, or came under the administration of, various kingdoms: * The Later Yan kingdom (384–409) set up Xuzhou's capital at Huangjin'gu (; present-day Zhangqiu, Shandong), and moved it to Liyang (; east of present-day Xun County, Henan), and later to Juancheng (; north of present-day Juancheng County, Shandong). * The Southern Yan kingdom (398–410) set up Xuzhou's capital at Jucheng (; present-day Ju County, Shandong), which administered parts of southeastern Shandong. * The Later Qin kingdom (384–417) set up Xuzhou's capital at Xiang (; south of present-day Shenqiu County, Henan), which administered the regions east of present-day Shangqiu, Taikang County, Shangshui County in Henan province, as well as Bozhou, Woyang County and Mengcheng County in Anhui province. In 408, the Emperor An (r. 397–419) of the Liu Song dynasty (420–479) recaptured the former territory in the north of the Huai River, Xuzhou was renamed as North Xuzhou, whose south border next to the Huai River while capital was Pengcheng, in 411. Meanwhile, the migrated Xuzhou remained. In 421, during the reign of Emperor Wu (r. 420–422) , North Xuzhou was restored as Xuzhou, while South Xuzhou instead of the former migrated Xuzhou comparatively. In 433, during the reign of Emperor Taiwu (r. 424–452) of the Northern Wei (386–535), Xuzhou's capital was established at Jiyang County (; northeast of present-day Lankao, Henan). It was disbanded in 467 during the reign of Emperor Xianwen (r. 465–471). In 473, as the original area was captured by Northern Wei, Liu Song set up the new Xuzhou whose capital was located in Yan County (; present-day Feng Yang, Anhui). =Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasties= During the reign of Emperor Huizong (r. 1333–1370) in the Yuan dynasty (1279–1368), Xuzhou became an administrative division known as \\"Xuzhou Circuit\\" () after 1348, with its capital in Pengcheng. During the reign of the Hongwu Emperor (r. 1368–1398) in the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), the name \\"Xuzhou\\" was restored, and the administrative division governed Pei County and Feng County in Jiangsu, and Dangshan County and Xiao County in Anhui. Xuzhou became \\"Xuzhou Prefecture\\" () in the Qing dynasty (1644–1912) during the reign of the Yongzheng Emperor (r. 1722–1735) and it administered the modern city of Xuzhou and Suqian in Jiangsu, and Suzhou, Xiao County and Dangshan County in Anhui.

Description Capros aper commonly reaches a length of about 13 cm in males, with a maximum length of about 30 cm. The weight reaches about 85 g. The female is larger than male. This fish has large eyes, a quite long snout, and a very protractile mouth that forms a short tube when extended. The general form of the body can be defined as rhombic, quite deep, and compressed. The dorsal fin is unique, the caudal fin is rather large and spatulated with a convex edge, the ventral fins are very large and have a thorny spine, and the pectoral fins are quite small. The color of the body is reddish orange, sometimes with three wide darker bands, one behind the eye, one in the center of the body, and one on the caudal peduncle. During the breeding season, sexual dimorphism is striking; the male's body is covered with sinuous orange lines and the dorsal and ventral fins become red, while the female is orange with a faint dark band in the middle of the body and has belly and basal part of the ventral fins white silver, and the final part of the ventral fins is rather dark orange. It feeds on crustaceans, especially copepods and mysid shrimps, or on molluscs and worms. Distribution This species is widespread in the Eastern Atlantic, from western Norway, Skagerrak, Shetland, and western Scotland to Senegal. It is also present in the Mediterranean, especially in the western part. Habitat Capros aper usually lives close to the floor of the sea (demersal), mainly on muddy bottoms or near rocky bottoms or coral. It forms numerous herds at a certain distance from the substrate, but occasionally it can reach a depth of about 700 m, especially at night. References * Joseph S.

Ramadan later qualified for the repechage rounds, but she was beaten in her first match by South Korea's Choi Sook-Ie. At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, Ramadan competed for the second time in the women's +78 kg class. She received a bye for the second preliminary round, before losing out again this time to Cuba's Idalys Ortiz by an ippon and a seoi nage (shoulder throw). Because her opponent advanced further into the semi-finals, Ramadan offered another for the bronze medal by defeating Australia's Janelle Shepherd in the repechage rounds.

Kansas, 274 U.S. 380 (1927), was a United States Supreme Court Case that was first argued May 3, 1926 and finally decided May 16, 1927.. Background The case began when Fiske, a Kansas resident, proclaimed the preamble of the radical labor union the Industrial Workers of the World: > That the working class and the employing class have nothing in common, and > that there can be no peace so long as hunger and want are found among > millions of working people and the few who make up the employing class have > all the good things of life. Between these two classes a struggle must go on > until the workers of the world organize as a class, take possession of the > earth and the machinery of production and abolish the wage system. Instead > of the conservative motto, 'A fair day's wages for a fair day's work,' we > must inscribe on our banner the revolutionary watchword, 'Abolition of the > wage system.' By organizing industrially we are forming the structure of the > new society within the shell of the old. A Kansas statute defined \\"criminal syndicalism\\" as \\"the doctrine which advocates crime, physical violence, arson, destruction of property, sabotage, or other unlawful acts or methods, as a means of accomplishing or effecting industrial or political ends, or as a means of effecting industrial or political revolution, or for profit . . .\\" The law was applied by a state court and was charged if the accused in some fashion held these views and formed a group of followers with a similar intent. Fiske was tried and convicted of violating this act, and the judgement was upheld in the Supreme Court of Kansas. He then appealed to the Federal Supreme Court where his case was heard. Trial The federal question was whether the Syndicalism Act as applied in this case was repugnant to the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The state offered no evidence as to the true beliefs and practices of Fiske and his organization. Fiske claimed that his organization in no way sought to bring about industrial change by illegal or criminal means. The state of Kansas could prove neither that Fiske had any actual or imminent intent to illegally change the economic structure of the United States nor that he intended to overthrow the US government. Fiske's words were thus protected by the First Amendment and so could not be barred. Decision The Syndicalism Act was called \\"an arbitrary and unreasonable exercise of the police power of the State.\\" The law, applied as it had, was found to be a violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The judgement of the state court was reversed, and Fiske was found to be not in violation of any law. Importance This court decision further solidified the importance of the Due Process Clause by ensuring that the state recognize all the legal rights of a person and prevents the government from violating rights without a justifiable and pressing reason to do so. The case would also reinforce the \\"imminent lawless action\\" clause of Brandenburg v. Ohio in the future as well as other court cases, which ruled that commitment and imminent intent to act upon the plans was needed to convict someone of a similar criminal violation such as in this case. The case was seen as a victory for proponents of a stronger definition of the First Amendment and protected speech. ReferencesFurther reading * \\"The Wobblies and Fiske v.

About 19 km from Rohtang Pass, and 7kms from North Portal of Atal Tunnel Rohtang. Koskar is the coldest place in Lahaul. It is mostly snowed in during winters but during the summer months, the PWD Rest House and Eating places are in business. Isolated mountain areas, panoramic picturesque views and pathways for hiking can be seen. It is 340 km from its state capital Shimla and 70 km from Manali. Nearby villages are Tailing (7.0 km) and Sissu (13.0 km). Koksar Pin Code is 175140 and the Post office name is Koksar. STD code of Koksar is +91-1900. Reliance Jio has started it's 4G services in the valley starting 2019. Earlier BSNL Mobile Network was the only working network in the valley. Nearest petrol pump is at Tandi (40 km from Koksar) which is a sole filling station in the entire valley.  Flora and fauna  The harsh conditions of Lahaul permit only scattered tufts of hardy grasses and shrubs to grow, even below 4,000 metres. Glacier lines are usually found at 5,000 metres. Animals such as Yaks and dzos roam across the wild Lingti plains. However, over-hunting and a decrease in food supplies has led to a large decrease in the population of the Tibetan Antelope, Argali, Kiangs, Musk deer, and Snow leopards in these regions, reducing them to the status of endangered species. However, in the Lahaul valley, one can see Ibex, brown bears, foxes and Snow leopards during winter.  People  The language, culture, and populations of Koksar are closely related. Generally the Lahaulis are of Tibetan and Indo-Aryan descent. Fairer skin and hazel-colored eyes are commonly seen among the Lahaulis. The languages belong to the Tibetan family. They are very similar to the Ladakhi and Tibetans culturally, as they had been placed under the rule of the Guge and Ladakh kingdoms at occasional intervals. The family acts as the basic unit of kinship. The extended family system is common, evolved from the polyandric system of the past. The family is headed by a senior male member, known as the Yunda, while his wife, known as the Yundamo, attains authority by being the oldest member in the generation. The clan system, also known as Rhus, plays another major role in the Koksar society.  Lifestyle  The lifestyles of the Koksar is owing to their proximity. Agriculture is the main source of livelihood. Potato and peas farming is common. Other occupations include working in government programs, government services, private services outside of the village and other businesses and crafts. Earlier houses were made of mud and stones but these days houses are constructed in modern style with bricks and cement.  Religion  Most of the residents of Koksar follow a combination of Hinduism and Tibetan Buddhism of the Drukpa Kagyu order. Exterior view of Koksar Gompa.  Infrastructure  There is 1 HPPWD Rest House, 2 Primary School, 1 Ayurvedic Health Centre, 1 Military Health Centre and 1 Veterinary Health Centre facilities available. Border Roads Organisation and Military camp is also here.  Tourism  Koksar village is situated at Leh–Manali Highway. Seasonally, at Koksar Bazar for Tourist information and help, to enter vehicles a police checkpost is established and also for registering of foreigners' passports. As in the past years many tourists have been visiting Koksar and prefer spending time here as the village is the first village after entering Lahaul and one can experience and witness the drastic change in the flora, fauna and the landscapes after crossing rohtang. The village also has a monastery which attracts a good number of tourists because of its religious importance and the location of the monastery which is bedded inside the mountain and is one of its kind in the valley. Koksar also has importance from a tourists' perspective as it is not only the first and the nearest Lahauli village from Rohtang (just 19 Km) but also the nearest Lahauli village from Chandra Taal (lake of the moon).

He is the current Railways and Development minister. He was appointed by President Nana Akuffo Addo on 11 January 2017. Joe Ghartey hails from Shama, in the Western Region of the Republic of Ghana. Early life and education Joe Ghartey was born in Accra, Ghana, to a teacher, Lauraine Ghartey (née Daniels), and a public servant, Joseph Ghartey, on 15 June 1961. He started his early education at the Ridge Church School in Accra and later moved to the secondary boarding school, Mfantsipim School, in Cape Coast. It was during his time at Mfantsipim School that his leadership qualities began to show. He was appointed House Prefect of Pickard-Parker House in his senior year and he used his good offices to champion the development of sports and student participation in sports programmes at Mfantsipim. He would go on to become Team Manager for the sports teams in the school. After Mfantsipim, Ghartey enrolled to study law and obtained his LLB (Hons) degree in 1986 from the University of Ghana, and BL from the Ghana School of Law in 1988, he was called to the Bar of Ghana in that same year. Legal career and academia Ghartey undertook his National Service duty as Legal Officer to the Komenda Eguafo Abirem District Assembly in the Central Region of the Republic of Ghana. He also took up a job as an Associate at the Chambers of Lawyer Gwira in Sekondi. Later, he would join the firm of Akufo-Addo, Prempeh & Co., a leading law firms in Ghana, which was co-founded by his future colleague parliamentarian and Cabinet Minister in the John Kufuor administration, Nana Akufo-Addo. Ghartey left this firm after seven years and in 1994 co-founded the law firm, Ghartey & Ghartey with his wife Efua Ghartey, who is a respected lawyer in her own right. He is currently the Senior Partner at Ghartey & Ghartey, a well respected firm of barristers & Sand solicitors located at Labone in Accra. Throughout his legal career, Ghartey has invested heavily in providing legal services to businesses that are keen on creating jobs for a stronger Ghanaian economy. In his own words, \\"A strong economy hinges on strong businesses. Strong businesses must of necessity have strong legal foundations\\". He has provided legal services to several corporate entities and professional bodies, both nationally and internationally, ranging from the field of Taxation through to Labour law, Environmental and Company law. He is an authority in Corporate and Investment law. He has additionally supported many Human Rights causes in Ghana. As a co-founder of the Ghana Committee on Human and Peoples Rights, Hon. Ghartey has provided extensive education on Human Rights, Civil Rights and Obligations to various citizen groups. The Committee was consequently given observer status at the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights. He also served as Chair of the Inter African Network of Human Rights Organizations based in Zambia. As a speaker and a teacher, Ghartey has also lectured in various fields of Law and Investment. He was an adjunct lecturer of Investment Law at the University of Ghana Business School. He has also served as lecturer in Corporate Governance and Executive MBA at the Ghana Institute of Management and Public Administration (GIMPA). He was also for a period an instructor at the Ghana Stock Exchange. In 2004, he authored what has become Ghana's leading legal publication on Investment and Business, \\"Doing Business and Investing in Ghana - Legal and Institutional Framework\\". He also taught Company Law at the Ghana School of Law and Mountcrest University in Accra. Political career and governance Ghartey is a member of the New Patriotic Party (NPP). He was inspired to join the Party in 1992 because it espouses strong values that he shares personally — Freedom, Democracy, Respect for Human Rights and the Rule of Law, as well as Private Sector Development, a philosophy that is very dear to his heart. He started off as a member of the Sekondi Campaign Team and later served as Chairman of the Greater Accra Regional Disciplinary Committee of the Party. He was part of the team that wrote the \\"Stolen Verdict\\", in 1993, which was a detailed account of the widespread electoral malpractices thatr occurred during the 1992 general election. He chaired the Session of the National Conference which amended the constitution of the NPP at the Trade Fair Center in Accra on 22 August 2009. This was when the Electoral College for the election of the presidential candidate was expanded from a few thousand delegates to more than one hundred thousand delegates. He was also a member of the team of legal experts appointed by the National Council of the NPP to review the conduct of the election petition that was filed in the Supreme Court after the 2012 general elections and to provide recommendations going forward. The Committee submitted its report to the National Council. The report included proposals for reform of the electoral process in Ghana. All along the coastal belt of Ghana, Ghartey has supported many constituencies in the Western, Central, Greater Accra and Volta Regions, including Shama, Sekondi, Takoradi, Effie Kwasimintsim, Tarkwa, Prestea, Amenfi, Korle Klottey, La-Dade Kotopon and Hohoe. In 2000, he was a pillar in the Western Regional Presidential Campaign Team of the NPP, travelling the length and breadth of the region with the then candidate John Kufuor, who went on to win the general elections in December that year. Ghartey is currently the NPP Member of Parliament for Essikado/Ketan Constituency in the Western Region of the Republic of Ghana. He was first elected to the seat in the December 2004 elections and was re- elected in both the December 2008 and December 2012 elections. In all the three elections he was not contested in the primaries of the NPP to choose the parliamentary candidate for the Constituency. During the administration of President John Agyekum Kufuor, Ghartey was appointed Deputy Attorney General and Deputy Minister of Justice in March 2005. He was soon promoted and appointed the substantive Attorney-General and Minister of Justice in June 2006, a position he held until January 2009 following the electoral loss of the NPP in the 2008 general elections. Ghartey was the longest serving Attorney-General and Minister of Justice under the Kufuor administration. =Attorney-General and Minister of Justice= In June 2006, a Ministerial reshuffle by President Kufuor saw Ghartey being elevated from the position of Deputy Attorney-General and Minister of Justice to the substantive position of Attorney-General and Minister of Justice. He was subsequently sworn into office by President Kufuor on 16 June 2006 as the 20th Attorney-General and Minister of Justice of the Republic of Ghana, one of the most prized and respected cabinet portfolios in Ghana. His appointment was a testament to his hard work, brilliance, achievements and honourable service to the government and people of Ghana. He was another laudable addition to a long line of such distinguished former Ghanaian Attorneys-General as Victor Owusu (1966–69), and Nana Akufo-Addo (2001–03). As Attorney-General, Ghartey launched an Agenda for Change in the Ministry of Justice. The main aim was to radically improve the effectiveness of the office and impact significantly on all aspects of justice delivery in Ghana. Its flagship programme was Justice for All which, among other things, aimed at providing access to the courts for people who had been in remand custody for long periods without prosecution. This programme saw the release of hundreds of incarcerated persons from custody who had not been prosecuted or convicted but were being held by the State. As Attorney-General, he was known for personally leading his legal teams to court on several high- profile cases. His special interest in Investment Law was evident in the development of the legal framework and infrastructure for the Oil and Gas Industry in Ghana. As a member of the Mines and Energy Committee of Parliament, he was instrumental in the decision to establish of the Petroleum Commission of Ghana. As a Cabinet Minister, he represented the President at several international fora on legal and investment matters and served the Government and People of Ghana with much admiration. =Deputy Speakership= After the 2012 general elections, Hon. Ghartey was nominated by the NPP minority in parliament to the position of Second Deputy Speaker of Parliament in the 6th Parliament of the 4th Republic. The position of the 2nd Deputy Speaker of Parliament by precedent goes to a minority Party in Parliament. However, following the NPP's challenge of the validity of the election of John Dramani Mahama as president of Ghana and their subsequent boycott of his inauguration, some members of the majority NDC were of the view that, \\"the NPP should not be rewarded with the position since it had decided to boycott the inauguration of John Mahama of the NDC as President in the same election it is challenging.\\" The NDC, citing precedent by the NPP, who in the past had chosen to vote for Malik Alhassan Yakubu (an NPP candidate) against the NDC's Ken Dzirasah, wanted to sponsor a PNC newcomer to the position instead. However, Joe Ghartey was eventually unanimously elected to the position by Members of Parliament on 7 January 2013. Since assuming office, he has championed the formulation of rules to guard against conflict of interest among Ghana's legislators. Until his rise to the position of 2nd Deputy Speaker of Parliament, he was the Ranking member of the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee, member of the Government Assurances Committee and a member of the Mines and Energy Committee. He currently chairs the Committee of Members Holding Offices of Profit. As well, he is a member of the Constitutional, Legal and Parliamentary Committee and the Standing Orders Committee. He was also appointed a Consultant to the Parliament of Sierra Leone and drafted a Code of Conduct for that Parliament. =Cabinet Minister= In May, 2017, President Akufo-Addo created the Ministry of Railways Development as a cabinet position and named Joe Ghartey as the sector Minister his cabinet. =Campaign for NPP Presidential candidate= Hon. Joe Ghartey declared his intention to contest the position for Presidential candidate of the New Patriotic Party before the 2016 general elections. He filed his nomination papers for the position on 7 July 2014, along with six other aspirants. There was a Special Delegates Congress on 31 August 2014 by the Party to trim the number of aspirants down to five, in accordance with the Constitution of the NPP. he was third but chose not to go for the second round but supported the winning candidate Nana Addo Dankwa Akuffo-Addo, the President. Personal life Joe Ghartey is married to Efua Ghartey, a lawyer and co-founder of the law firm, Ghartey & Ghartey. Mrs. Efua Ghartey also serves as the Chairperson of the Bible Society of Ghana and the Chairperson of the International Board of the United Bible Societies (UBS), which operates in more than 200 countries. She is additionally the president of the Greater Accra Ghana Bar Association as well as a member of the Constitutional and Legal Committee of the New Patriotic Party. They have five children. Sports and other activities From his days as team manager of Mfantsipim School sports teams, Ghartey has been a football fanatic and a strong supporter of Ghana's local football league. He has previously served as Counsel to the Accra Hearts of Oak Supporters Union (National Chapters Committee) and subsequently became Chairman of Sekondi Eleven Wise, leading the club from the second to the first division of the football league. Ghartey is also a philanthropist and supports many causes he personally believes in. He is an avid reader and an accomplished author and is currently working on various scholarly projects that will see print in due course. \\"Newly inaugurated members of Parliament in sixth exited after taking oaths\\", Vibe Ghana, 7 January 2013.

In 1791 it became the \\"15e régiment de cavalerie\\" (15th Cavalry Regiment), and in 1792 it was disbanded. Early history Following its establishment under Louis XIV in 1672, the Royal-Allemand saw extensive active service in Flanders and various German states during both the War of the Austrian Succession and the Seven Years' War.https://www.ancestramil.fr/uploads/01_doc/terre/cavalerie/1620-1789/susane/royal_allemand_cavalerie_susane.pdf Role in French Revolution In June 1789 the Royal-Allemand was one of the regiments of the Royal Army summoned to Paris to suppress the growing disturbances in the city, that preceded the outbreak of the French Revolution. About half of this force was made up of Swiss and German foreign troops, who were considered more dependable in a time of civil unrest than the native born rank and file of the French regular regiments. While the Royal-Allemand was mainly recruited within the borders of France, its German speaking troopers proved willing to act against the Paris population when ordered. On 12 July 1789, a squadron of the regiment, under the command of Charles Eugene, charged a crowd of demonstrators in the Tuileries Garden killing one and injuring others. A detachment of the French Guards, who formed the permanent garrison of Paris and had strong local ties, then fired on the cavalrymen of the Royal- Allemand. The regiment was subsequently withdrawn from Paris and returned to its frontier garrison. While desertions from both French and foreign regiments were running at a high rate during the revolutionary disorders of 1789, the Royal-Allemand lost only three men during this period. In part this appears to have occurred because of the widespread hostility that developed towards this unit following its clashes with civilians in Paris on 12 July. Disbandment In 1791 the bulk of the regiments of the French Army lost their historic titles and were renamed under a system of numbering. The Royal-Allemand became the \\"15e régiment de cavalerie\\" (15th Cavalry Regiment). After the overthrow of Louis XVI in August 1792, part of the regiment, led by its officers, defected and took service with the army of royalist emigres being raised by the Prince de Condé at Coblenz. The remnants of the Royal-Allemand fought in the Battle of Aldenhoven beside the Austrian Army, before being finally disbanded. Notable members of the regiment General Jabłonowski served as a lieutenant in the regiment before losing his commission after failing to return from leave.

Along with Pablo Casals and Gaspar Cassadó, he was a member of the \\"Three Cs\\" of the Spanish cello. Early life Juan Ruiz Casaux was born in San Fernando, Cádiz in 1889. His father was Juan Antonio Ruiz y Lopez de Carvajal, an admiral and a mathematician, and the family tradition was for males to receive naval training. After starting out on that path, he soon abandoned it in 1904 when he entered a music competition in Cadiz at which one of the judges was Manuel de Falla. He had earlier had lessons with Salvador Viniegra, a painter, art patron and a cellist of considerable ability, albeit an amateur. After reaching and surpassing Viniega's standard, he entered the Madrid Royal Conservatory to study under Víctor Mirecki Larramat (who was later to become his father-in-law). He was extremely successful, winning a number of prizes, and he chose to continue his studies in Paris under André Hekking. He moved to Lisbon, Portugal at the start of the First World War, giving many concerts with the Lisbon Symphony Orchestra under Pedro Blanch. He also gave many chamber music concerts with artists such as José Cubiles (cello), Enrique Fernández Arbós (violin), and José Vianna da Motta, Ricardo Viñes, and Fernandez Ortiz (piano). In 1915 he was the soloist in the first performance in Spain of Richard Strauss's Don Quixote, under Fernández Arbós (and in 1925 he played the same work under the composer's baton). Return to Madrid In 1920 he returned to the Madrid Conservatory as senior professor, remaining there until his retirement in 1962. He sought to create a distinct school of Spanish cello playing and to extend the scope of chamber music. He founded the Hispano-Hungaro Trio with Enrique Iniesta (violin) and Emilio Ember (piano), and the Hispano Trio with Iniesta and Enrique Aroca (piano). In 1940 he also created the Agrupación Nacionál de Música de Camára (National Chamber Music Organization), which consisted apart from himself of Luis Antón and Enrique Garcia (violins), Pedro Meroño (viola), and Enrique Aroca. They played complete cycles of Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven string quartets in recitals, in schools and universities, and on international tours. On 26 November 1934, along with Iniesta and Ember, he gave the first performance in Spain of Joaquín Turina's Piano Trio No. 2, Op. 76, a broadcast on Radio Madrid. On 28 December 1944 he participated in the world premiere of Turina's Musas de Andalucia, Op. 93 (1942), a cycle of nine pieces for strings, piano and soprano. The composer played the piano, the soprano was Lola Rodríguez Aragón, and the string players were Iniesta, Antón, Meroño and Aroca. On 27 May 1945, as a tribute to his 25th anniversary as head of the cello department at the Conservatory, four of his cello students premiered Joaquín Rodrigo's Dos piezas caballerescas for four-piece cello orchestra.joaquin-rodrigo.com In 1951 he founded the Asociación Española de Música de Cámara, with which he continued to play until 1969. He composed a small number of pieces, including \\"Six Cello Impromptus\\". He died in 1972, aged 82. After his death, his place in the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando was assumed by the composer Ernesto Halffter.Nancy Lee Harper, ERNESTO HALFFTER ESCRICHE (1905-1989) The Stradivarius Palatinos Juan Ruiz Casaux also played an extremely important role in having returned to Spain a Stradivarius viola made in 1696 as part of a set of five matching ornamented instruments and sold to Charles IV of Spain (known as the Stradivarius Palatinos). The viola and one other of the set were looted by the French at the end of the Peninsular War. The fifth instrument was irretrievably lost, but the viola eventually came into the possession of the firm of W.E. Hill & Sons in London. After years of fruitless discussion, including accompanying King Alfonso XIII of Spain to London in 1925 to personally plead Spain's case, Casaux was finally in 1950 able to persuade Hill to sell the viola back to Spain. His group later used this quartet of priceless instruments in concerts at the royal palace and broadcasts. Family He married Maria Theresa, the daughter of his Madrid teacher Víctor Mirecki Larramat; and his sister Carmen married Mirecki's son Alejandro Víctor Mirecki Bach. His second wife was Julia Bazo-Vivó, the mother of his only child, Mary Ruiz Casaux (María Pilar Ruiz- Casaux y Bazo; born 1936), a pianist who was the first to perform all of Johannes Brahms' piano works in Spain. The economist José Luis de Mirecki Ruiz-Casaux was his nephew. Honours In 1961 he inherited the Marquessate of Atalaya Bermeja, becoming the 5th Marquess. His daughter Mary later became the 7th Marquesa. Other honours included Academician of the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando, the Academy Paestum in Italy, of the Academy of San Romualdo, and corresponding member of the Spanish-American, Knight of the Order of Carlos III, French Legion of Honor, Order of Merit of Italy, official Order of Saint James of the Sword (Portugal), Commander of the Order of Alfonso X the Wise, and the Order of Merit Jalifiano (Morocco). Jesús Guridi dedicated his 2nd String Quartet (1949) to Juan Antonio Ruiz Casaux.CM ediciones ReferencesSources * Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 5th ed (1954), Vol. II, p. 105 Category:1889 births Category:1972 deaths Category:Spanish classical cellists Category:Spanish music educators Category:Cello pedagogues Category:Madrid Royal Conservatory alumni Category:Academics of the Madrid Royal Conservatory Category:Marquesses of Spain Category:People from San Fernando, Cádiz ","title":"Juan Ruiz Casaux"},{"id":"38195292","text":"The Air Seller (rus. Продавец воздуха) is a science fiction novel by Russian writer Alexander Belayev. It was first published in 1929, in several issues of Vokrug Sveta magazine. The first book edition was in 1956.About the novel at the \\"Science Fiction Laboratory\\" website Plot Meteorologist Georgiy Klimenko and his Yakut guide Nikola are investigating a strange wind anomaly in Yakutia, Eastern Siberia, when they are caught prisoner by a megalomaniac villain Bayley. With a gigantic air-sucking device, built by Swedish scientist Engelbrecht, Bayley is slowly stealing the Earth's atmosphere. The deeply frozen oxygen is stored in a vast cryogenic warehouse. Bayley plans to create oxygen deficit and then to start selling fresh air, thus eventually becoming the master of the world. He even boasts of having trade relations with Martians, though the credibility of this claim is left unclear. Klimenko soon discovers, however, that Bayley is not the one who pulls the strings, but there are wealthy and influential Western imperialists behind the plot. Engelbrecht's daughter Nora is sympathetic to the prisoners. She helps Nikola to escape and warn the Soviets of the danger. However, the Red Army is unable to assault Bayley's base directly, since that would risk an explosive vaporization of the frozen air (Bayley demonstrates the possible consequences by releasing a portion of said air, leveling enormous areas of Siberia and the Europe.). Bayley holds Nora hostage in order to keep Engelbrecht under control. Realising the danger Bayley's plans impose to the Earth, Nora commits suicide by exposing herself to the frozen oxygen. Now free and lusting for revenge, Engelbert sides with Klimenko. The base is finally stormed by the Red Army, shown a safe passage in by the escaped Nikola. Bayley, facing imminent capture, swallows some frozen air balls and explodes.

Bangladeshi art has a perennial history which originated more than two thousand years ago and is practiced even to this date. Among the various forms of Bangladeshi art, photography, architecture, sculpture and painting are the most notable.  History  The recent excavations of the artifacts in the archaeological site of Wari- Bateshwar indicates that the history of Bangladeshi art dates back to 450 BC.MM Hoque and SS Mostafizur Rahman, Wari-Bateshwar, Banglapedia: The National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh, Asiatic Society of Bangladesh, Dhaka, Retrieved: 11 January 2013 However, more research is being carried out in this regard as these excavations conflict with the earlier notions about the existence of early urban civilization in Bangladesh. Proper evidence about the earliest development of Bangladeshi art refers to the Mauryan age. A number of sculptures have been discovered in Bangladesh which reflect the rich heritage of Mauryan art. The most significant development of Bangladeshi art took place during the Pala rule which existed from 750–1174 CE. The Palas created a distinctive form of Buddhist art in Bangladesh which even influenced the Chinese, Japanese, eastern Asian and Tibetan art. This progress of Bangladeshi art continued to some extent during the Sena rule through the 11th and 12th centuries. Bangladeshi art witnessed the influence of Islamic art though the arrival of Muslims in Bengal beginning from the 11th century. This influence started through the establishment of Sultanate of Bengal which covered most of the area of present-day Bangladesh. However, Islamic art in Bangladesh mostly flourished during the Mughal rule. The Muslim dynasties mainly contributed in the architectural field. A huge influence of Islamic architecture can be seen in numerous mosques, shrines and mazars located throughout Bangladesh. A new wave of evolution was introduced in Bangladeshi art through the pervading of British rule. The British left their impact in almost every field of visual arts in Bangladesh. Bangladeshi art was bolstered through the introduction of Modern art. This period also gave birth to many famous artists in Bangladesh, including the great artist Zainul Abedin.  Photography  Photography is the contemporary art form where Bangladesh has really made its mark. The early work was done by the pioneers like Golam Kasem Daddy, Manzoor Alam Beg, Nowazesh Ahmed and Naibuddin Ahmed. Sayeeda Khanom was one of the first women photographers. Anwar Hossain brought about a shift through strong humanistic work in the late 1970s. Documentary photography practice was pioneered by Shahidul Alam, who went on to set up the Drik Picture Library, Pathshala, the South Asian Media Institute; now considered one of the finest schools of photography in the world, Chobi Mela; the highly regarded biannual festival of photography and the Majority World Agency. Mohammad Rakibul Hasan has a great contribution in contemporary photo media. Women photographers have also taken up the profession with Taslima Akhter and Jannatul Mawa working on sustained personal projects. However, while Bangladeshi photography is celebrated worldwide, within Bangladesh it has not been sufficiently recognised. It is taught neither at the Faculty of Fine Arts (Charukala Institute) nor at the Department of Fine and Performing Arts (Shilpakala Academy). The entry rules of the Asian Art Biennale do not allow the submission of photography or video, though international artists have submitted photography and have been awarded for them. Shahidul Alam's book My journey as a witness was the first of a set of 40 books on Bangladeshi fine art to be brought out by the Italian publisher Skira jointly with the Bengal Foundation. Books by Kazi Ghiasuddin, Shafiuddin Ahmed and the great artist Zainul Abedin have since been published.  Architecture  Ahsan Manzil, influenced by Indo-Saracenic architecture The remains of the ancient archaeological sites bear ample testimony to the fact that the art of architecture was practiced in Bangladesh from very early period of her history. The Somapura Mahavihara, a creation of the Pala ruler Dharmapala, at Paharpur, Bangladesh, is the largest Buddhist Vihara in the Indian subcontinent, and has been described as a \\"pleasure to the eyes of the world.\\" The Kantajew Temple in Dinajpur, built in navaratna style contains one of the finest examples of terracotta ornamentation of the late period of the art.Journey plus – Dinajpur . The Sixty Dome Mosque in Bagerhat has been described as \\"the most impressive Muslim monument in the whole of the Indian subcontinent.\\"Shatgumbad Mosque, Banglapedia, accessed 12 January 2013 The Lalbagh Fort is considered as one of the greatest examples of Mughal architecture. The influence of European architecture is also noticeable in several colonial monuments and churches in the country. The most significant one is Ahsan Manzil, the former residence of the Nawabs of Dhaka, later turned into a museum. In modern context, Bangladeshi architecture has become more diversified comprising reflections of contemporary architectural attributes, aesthetic artistic and technologically advanced forms. Since the inception of Bangladesh, economical advancement has boosted the architecture from its traditional forms to contemporary context. With the growing urbanization and modernization, the architectural form is becoming modern, covering a wide range of its heritage and tradition.  Sculpture  Dancing Ganesha sculpture from Northern Bangladesh, 11th century CE Unlike other parts of the Indian Subcontinent, the art of sculpture in Bangladesh started through the molding of terracotta because of the dearth of stone relief and abundance of the soft alluvial clay. This dates back to the 3rd/2nd century BC. In course of time, the influence of north and central India began to grow in the sculptural art of Bangladesh and the introduction of stone sculpting started. From the early three centuries of the common era, the local sculptors started to make black stone sculptures in the Kusana style, native to northern India. These sculptures were the images of the deities worshiped by the followers of the three major religions of the time, namely, Brahmanism, Buddhism and Jainism. Bronze sculptures began to be assimilated in the 7th century AD primarily from the Chittagong region. The earliest sculptures of this kind were depictions of Buddhist beliefs but the art was later integrated into the Hindu art as well. In modern times, the theme of sculptural art has been dominated by some historical events, mainly the Bangladesh liberation war. Aparajeyo Bangla, Shabash Bangladesh are some of the noteworthy examples of this trend.  Folk art  As in other countries of the world, the people of rustic, and primitive ideas developed folk art in Bangladesh. Because of this the structure and growth of the folk-art of Bangladesh are filled with pure and simple vigor and the symbolic representations of hope, aspiration and sense of beauty of the rural Bangladeshi folk. The environment and the agricultural activities greatly helped to enrich the traditional folk-art of Bangladesh. It uses traditional motifs reflecting the land and its people. Different forms of folk art tend to repeat these common motifs. For instance, the lotus, the sun, the tree-of-life, flowery creepers etc. are seen in paintings, embroidery, weaving, carving and engraving. Other common motifs are fish, elephant, horse, peacock, circle, waves, temple, mosque etc. Many of these motifs have symbolical meanings. For example, the fish represents fertility, the sheaf of paddy prosperity, the lotus purity. Another important factor that has influenced the art and culture of this land is the six seasons. The folk art of Bangladesh has been largely contributed by the rural women because of the aesthetic value as well as the quality of their work. A key reason behind it was that in most cases their art has been non-commercial, whereas the folk art produced by men has a commercial value attached to it. Thus, artists like blacksmiths, potters, cobblers, painters, goldsmiths, brass-smiths, weavers earn their livelihood from what they produce while traditionally, in the past, Alpana artists or Nakshi kantha needlewomen were working within their homes and received no monetary recompense for their labour. Both Alpana and Nakshi kantha are some of the most attractive forms of Bangladeshi folk art. Pottery and Ivory are also some popular forms of the art.  Modern art  The movement of modern art in Bangladesh has its roots in the early 20th century. Back then there was no training or educational institutions for arts in Bangladesh. In the late 19th century, the British started to establish art schools in Calcutta, then provincial capital of Bengal which inspired the local art admirers to pursue a particular form of art. The art lovers of Bangladesh or erstwhile East Bengal were also induced by this. This phenomenon gave birth to many preeminent figures of arts in Bangladesh whose fame not only spread through Bangladesh but also the whole world. Zainul Abedin was from this generation of artists. He is considered the pioneer of art movement in Bangladesh. Liberation War by Zainul Abedin After the partition of India, Calcutta became a part of West Bengal in India while the current geographical area of Bangladesh formed the East Pakistan province of Pakistan. Hence, the local artists felt a dire need of an art institution in Bangladesh. In 1948, Zainul Abedin, along with other leading local artists like Quamrul Hassan, Safiuddin Ahmed, Anwarul Huq, Khawaja Shafique established the Government Institute of Arts and Crafts to evolve the art tradition in Bangladesh. Since the establishment of the art institute, the artists in Bangladesh started to gain the much required professionalism and also started to attach commercial value to it. This prompted them to organise art exhibitions to showcase their work to the audiences. By the 1960s the artists started to link with the art traditions of other parts of the world which gained them a pretty clear understanding of contemporary art in those countries. Many artists went to Europe and Japan for training and came back with new ideas and latest techniques, but they were also steeped in the traditions of indigenous art forms. After the independence of Bangladesh, Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy was set up in 1974 which later started to organise regular art exhibitions and festivals involving both national and international artists. By this time, Bangladeshi art also began to get international recognitions and appreciations.  Contemporary art  Several art movements arose in Bangladesh as well, artists exhibited internationally and few groups of artists formed in the Bangladeshi contemporary art scene. Few institutions were established to be involved with contemporary creation. Several artists left the country and practiced on interdisciplinary media in Europe, America and Japan. Bangladeshi born Tayeba Begum Lipi, Runa Islam, Hasan Elahi, Naeem Mohaiemen, Firoz Mahmud, Rana Begum and Mohammad Rakibul Hasan practiced on various media including video, installation, photography, text, sound, painting and other new media of art and got recognition exhibiting internationally. Britto Arts Trust is the first non-profit artist run art organisation who organised several art events on contemporary media. The 1990s saw greater connections between artists and their audience through increasing art venues and art sales.

Issue The medal was struck to celebrate Queen Victoria's golden jubilee, the 50th anniversary of her reign. It was awarded to those involved in the official celebrations, including members of the Royal Family, Royal Household and government officials, as well as Envoys, Foreign Ambassadors and Colonial Prime Ministers. Military recipients included selected officers, sailors and soldiers of the Royal Navy and Army, and the Indian and colonial contingents, that participated in jubilee activities, including the London parade and the Royal Naval Review at Spithead, where the commander of each ship received the medal in silver. The medal was worn on the left breast, originally after the insignia of orders and before campaign medals. In November 1918 the order of wear changed, with all coronation and jubilee medals now worn after campaign medals and before long service awards. Ladies could wear the medal near their left shoulder with the ribbon tied in the form of a bow. A Police Golden Jubilee Medal of a different design was awarded to members of the Metropolitan and City of London Police Forces on duty during the jubilee celebrations. Description The medal measures in diameter and was awarded in gold (to members of the Royal Family), silver (to officers and those of similar status) and in bronze (to selected other ranks and those of similar status). On the obverse, Queen Victoria is depicted crowned and wearing a veil which falls over the back of the head and neck, with the text VICTORIA D.G. REGINA ET IMPERATRIX F.D.. The reverse bears the words IN COMMEMORATION OF THE 50TH YEAR OF THE REIGN OF QUEEN VICTORIA · 21 JUNE 1887 within a garland of roses, shamrock and thistles. The bust of Queen Victoria on obverse was designed by Sir Joseph Edgar Boehm and the reverse wreath designed by Clemens Emptmayer, who was recommended by Boehm. The ribbon is garter blue with wide white stripes towards each edge. The medal was awarded unnamed. When Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee was celebrated 10 years later, holders of the 1887 medal who qualified for the Diamond Jubilee Medal were awarded a bar inscribed '1897' to attach to the ribbon of their existing medal.

He worked with the theories of value and distribution of income and paid special attention to the link between capital accumulation and the profit rate. He analyzed classical political economy theories from Adam Smith, David Ricardo and Karl Marx. He then tackled important events in the Italian economy and the European Union. Regarding the Italian economy, he first studied the aftermath of the Second World War, then the answer to the workers' struggles of the sixties and early seventies, and most recently Italy's adhesion to the European single currency. With regard to the European economy, he focused his attention to the reasons, operating ways and the consequences of the European Monetary System and the European single currency.

It has taken place in Vienna every year since 2005 until 2015. Since 2015, the fair has been held under a new name – viennacontemporary.  History  In 2005 the viennAfair (older spelling) was founded by Reed Messe Wien GmbH. Its artistic management was taken over by Gabriela Gantenbein with a mainly Austrian team and board. The original reasons for founding the fair included providing more sales opportunities for the art galleries, which are found in large numbers in Vienna, and establishing Vienna as a location for art. From the beginning, the supporting programme included public discussions and curated exhibitions. Because of Vienna's geopolitical situation, a relation was established to the countries of Central, Eastern and South- Eastern Europe. At first mainly the countries newly acceding to the EU were exhibited and supported. An eligibility committee – originally consisting of mainly Austrian art dealers but over the years becoming more and more international – was responsible for selecting the galleries. = 2006-2010 = Under the artistic directorship of Edek Bartz the supporting programme was further developed from 2006 to 2010. “By 2010 ‘VIENNAFAIR' had achieved international recognition as a small but specialised art fair, where it was possible, in particular, to make discoveries from Eastern European.” (see: Press release January 2012, p. 2) In addition to discussions, in 2006 video presentations and guides, as well as tours through areas outside the fair, such as museums, were on offer. In 2008 Edek Bartz increased the international focus with new galleries, programmes and collectors with a focus on CEE countries, and international fair board and an eligibility committee. The exhibition project “curated by”, initiated by the creative agency “departure”, supported the fair's supporting programme by having even the gallery spaces used for such programmes as artist interviews, guided tours and discussions. By 2010 the supporting programme had been further expanded in several directions: directors of museums and institutions were invited to take part in discussions with artists like Pawel Althamer, Julien Bismuth, and Shirin Neshat. A “Performance Nite” was instituted by artists especially focused on the VIENNAFAIR. In addition, Edek Bartz curated a special exhibition where private collectors and museums showed their favourite videos. The intention of the exhibition was not only to define a uniform thematic framework but also to show a very personal, subjective view of each individual collector. = 2011 = In 2011 the artistic direction was taken over by Hedwig Saxenhuber and Georg Schöllhammer, who had already held responsibility as editors, curators and critics and are experts on Eastern and South-Eastern European art. In 2011 it was possible to record the largest participation to date from the CEE focus countries. The new artistic directors designed the special programme “DIYALOG: Art from Istanbul”, thus creating a new focus on contemporary Turkish art. They extended the radius of galleries further in the direction of the Caucasus, Central Asia and the Middle East, and special programmes on these regions were shown in specialist non-commercial sections. With the “Vienna School of Collecting Theory” – a meeting place for artists, collectors, curators and laypeople – new groups of collectors were to be created. Hedwig Saxenhuber and Georg Schöllhammer provided a special area at the fair for the support programme with its innovative content. A new architectural concept was created by Johannes Porsch, with reference to the plan of a caravansary. The graphic design work for VIENNAFAIR 2011 was by Gerwald Rockenschaub. = 2012 = In April 2012 Sergey Skaterschikov, a professional art & luxury industry investor, had acquired Viennafair from Reed Exhibitions and presented a new team of artistic directors: Christina Steinbrecher and Vita Zaman. Christina Steinbrecher had already worked, for example, as director and curator for projects like Art Moscow, the Sputnik Art Foundation and the Innovation Prize of the National Centre for Contemporary Art. Vita Zaman studied art, art history, photography and Creative Curating in London. She is one of the founders of IBID Projects in London and worked for The Pace Gallery in New York. The focus on the Central and Eastern European region was extended under the new artistic directors, in particular towards Russia. Reed Exhibition withdrew from the project, and since 2012 VIENNAFAIR has been organised by the VF Betriebsgesellschaft mbH. The special programme “DIYALOG” has been retained and further expanded. A large number of supporting programmes and exhibitions were implemented during the days of the fair. The various talks and public discussions have been continued, but new programmes have also been created: VIENNA Quintet brought contemporary art from five former Soviet countries – Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan and Ukraine – to Vienna. For the first time, by VIENNA Sonic, a crossover programme between music and art was presented. Under the name VIENNA Live performances were realised and VIENNA Studio employed students in their own special programme. From its beginnings, VIENNAFAIR has become an important component in the Vienna art world, and both as a platform and as a meeting place it has made a major contribution to the Austrian art scene. = 2013 = For its 9th edition in 2013, VIENNAFAIR The New Contemporary, increased its attendance with over 25% registering 23.963 visitors showcasing 127 galleries from 27 countries and a wide range of special projects offering an in depth view of the contemporary art scene from Central, Eastern and South-Eastern Europe with for example VIENNA Duet showing positions from Poland and Georgia, VIENNA XL offering a platform to 6 non-for- profit and artist run spaces from CEE region and an elaborate VIENNA Talks program. Under artistic leadership of Steinbrecher-Pfandt and Zaman the event has grown significantly internationally not only expanding ist reach towards the East – mainly Russia and CIS – but also towards the West. VIENNAFAIR also reached out locally by further developing art educational programs for young collectors, families, students and seniors. With VIENNAFAIR turnaround completed in 2013 and VIENNAFAIR returning firmly into collectors' calendar by that time, Mr. Skaterschikov made a decision to exit his investment in VIENNAFAIR and sold all of his ownership interest in it to Mr. Dmitry Aksenov, a Russian real estate investor that Mr. Skaterschikov had originally brought in to co-invest in VIENNAFAIR in 2012. = 2014 = Between 2 and 5 October 2014, a second consecutive attendance record was set which saw VIENNAFAIR break the 25.000 mark. With a deliberate downsizing in order to improve the overall quality, the 10th edition of VIENNAFAIR hosted 99 galleries and 16 institutions from 25 countries. With special presentations such as DIALOG: NEW ENERGIES and VIENNA Focus the art scenes of, respectively, Romania and Azerbaijan were put in the spotlight and young Austrian artists once more had the opportunity to shine with solo presentations in ZONE1. A well balanced talks program with international speakers such as Kasper König, Adam Budak, Viktor Missiano, Andreiana Mihail and Aida Muhmudova, to name but a few, offered in-depth insights and understanding of today's contemporary art scene. Special attention was also given to collecting and collectors with the second edition of the Young Collectors Talk and the third collectors forum “20 four 7: Collecting The New Contemporary”. A major step forward was made in bringing a larger international audience to VIENNAFAIR. Groups of international top collectors from Germany, Russia, Belgium, The Netherlands, France, Italy, UK and US flocked to Vienna for the fair also attending the many fringe events at the fair and in the city of Vienna. The service oriented approach towards the collectors, top-flight guests and partners, a higher quality in galleries and art presented resulted in an increase of sales with more than 25%, confirming VIENNAFAIR's successful positioning in the international fair calendar. Now under sole artistic leadership of Christina Steinbrecher-Pfandt, VIENNAFAIR The New Contemporary focused on quality, service and art education attracting the international art community as well as the local art lovers to Austria's contemporary art capital. After three years (2012 – 2014) under the management of VF Betriebsgesellschaft mbH and its managing director Renger van den Heuvel, VIENNAFAIR The New Contemporary, has become an important meeting place between East and West not only for art and culture but also as a platform for dialogue between businesses and administrations setting up new opportunities for future co-operations in the region and beyond. After the 2014 edition, Christina Steinbrecher-Pfandt and Renger van den Heuvel left Viennafair and started viennacontemporary, an international fair for contemporary art, with the same team that organized Viennafair from 2012-2014. In 2015, Viennafair took place for the last time, organized by Wolfgang Pelz.

On 10 January 2013, it was nominated for the 2012 Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film. After being nominated for an Oscar, the film was released along with all the other 15 Oscar-nominated short films in theaters by ShortsHD. Synopsis The shadow of Nathan Rijckx, a Belgian soldier who died in World War I, is captured by a collector. He is offered the chance to live again if he captures the shadows of 10,000 other people instead. He thinks nothing of his job at first. Simply find the name, pick the death, and capture the shadow when they die. Between his job, he touches the nails in his own shadow to remember what it was like right when he died. He remembers the woman Sarah Winters, who helped him right before his death, and how he was in love with her, and his mission is given new purpose. When he is called to capture the shadow of Thomas Belcourt, he sees that Sarah is in love with another soldier by the name of Daniel Hainaut. He grows furious with jealousy and sees that he only has to capture one more shadow before he can finally be relieved. As part of his job, Nathan can pick who he wants to capture the shadow of. He goes through every Daniel Hainaut until he finds the right one, who was shot to death by a firing squad in 1917. Nathan does his job and is allowed to live again. He can pick any time period he wants after his death, but after the first hour of life the doors to the collection will be forever closed to him. Nathan goes to the time right after Daniel's death and feels as if he is going to spend the rest of his new life with Sarah again. She sees his uniform and assumes that it is Daniel. When Nathan turns around, she doesn't recognize him and becomes distraught. Her maid apologizes to Nathan, explaining the situation and saying that dead soldiers don't come back to life. Just before the doors to the shadow collection close, Nathan slips back in and pulls the nails out of Daniel's shadow to allow him to live again.

The organization actively reaches 2 million Australians as of September 2016 primarily located in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane.  History  OurSay was founded by Eyal Halamish, Matthew Gordon, Gautam Raju, Linh Do and Hedda Ransan-Elliott and launched in Melbourne, Australia in August 2010 during the Australian federal elections where members of the public posted and voted for questions on the OurSay website and political candidates for the federal electorate of Melbourne Adam Bandt and Cath Bowtell responded to the top questions. Then finance minister and federal member for Melbourne Lindsay Tanner resigned from his political career and declined to participate in the OurSay forum. In November 2010, OurSay executed its second forum in Brunswick, Victoria, where citizens in the electorate of Brunswick, posted and voted for questions to political candidates Jane Garrett, Phil Cleary, and Cyndi Dawes. Citizens were invited to a local pub where the most voted for questions on OurSay were asked and responses were live video recorded and uploaded to the site. This presented the essence of OurSay, integrating online and offline citizen engagement with decision- makers. From November 2010 to August 2012, OurSay experimented with the execution of its technology and offline engagement. Some experiments included a partnership with Q&A; (Australian talk show), where a top question asker posed their question on national television and the Climate Agenda, where a senior reporter at The Sunday Age reported on the most voted for questions about climate change on OurSay for 10 consecutive weeks. OurSay was reviewed by media expert and academic Margaret Simons as a new model for journalism where the audience is driving the content. In July 2012, OurSay hosted a forum with Prime Minister of Australia Julia Gillard, the first national head of state to participate. OurSay partnered with Google+, Fairfax Media, Deakin University, and the office of the Prime Minister of Australia. In July 2016, OurSay secured a seed round of capital investment to improve its platform and tailor it specifically for the local government market as a \\"self-serve\\" platform for democracy and public engagement.

Always existing in pairs, they were called Alcalde de primer voto (roughly, \\"first mayor\\") and Alcaldes de segundo voto (roughly, \\"second mayor\\"). The alcalde ordinario was a judicial magistrate who, with some exceptions, was responsible for the administration of civil and criminal justice within their municipal jurisdiction.Aida R. Caro de Delgado. El Cabildo o Regimen Municipal Puertorriqueño en el Siglo XVIII Tomo I, \\"Organización y Funcionamiento.\\" Municipio de San Juan and Instituto de Cultura Puertorriqueña, editors. 1965. p. 85.  Historical Background  Spanish cabildos in the Americas were the local government institutions in the American cities founded by the Spanish.Ricardo Levene, Las Indias no eran colonias, Espasa-Calpe Argentina S.A., Colección Austral, Buenos Aires, 1951. Their jurisdiction included not only the urban area of the city but the adjacent rural areas as well. This jurisdiction was roughly equivalent to today's concept of \\"municipio\\" in many countries. When within the rural expanse of a cabildo a cluster of human dwellers formed, it would not be considered a village, town or city until it had its own \\"cabildo\\". Without a city there was no cabildo, and without a cabildo there was no city. Likewise, without a cabildo, there was no alcalde ordinario, and without alcalde ordinario, there was no cabildo.Adolfo Enrique Rodríguez. La policía de Buenos Aires en el período hispánico. Homenaje al cuarto centenario de la segunda fundación de la ciudad de la Trinidad y puerto de Santa María de los Buenos Aires. Instituto de Estudios Americanos, Buenos Aires, 1980. The post of alcalde ordinario was created by the Spanish Crown in 1537.Salvador Perea. Historia de Puerto Rico: 1537-1700. Instituto de Cultura Puertorriqueña and Universidad Católica de Puerto Rico. 1972. p. 9. Length of service  Cabildos in the Americas had two Alcaldes Ordinarios and a variable number of regidores, based on the importance of the city. Each of the two alcaldes ordinarios was responsible for specific duties. The initial appointment of the first two alcalde ordinarios was the responsibility of the founder of the town, with subsequent appointments taking place –traditionally– on 1 January each year, with the officials leaving the posts typically appointing their own successors. Their term generally ended on the first day of the new year.Salvador Perea. Historia de Puerto Rico, 1537-1700. Instituto de Cultura Puertorriquena, and Universidad Católica de Puerto Rico. 1965. p. 22. Some posts were obtained via a sort of public bidding system, but not the Alcalde Ordinario. This practice was consistent with the significant amount of responsibility the post represented. The term of service was typically one year, and the same official could not be re-elected until a certain period of time had passed with the post being occupied by a different person. It was an honorary post, as no remuneration was received in exchange. On the contrary, it was oftentimes considered a burdensome public post from which the individual chosen could not escape. Nevertheless, the post honored and brought prestige to the individual who agreed to carry on with the responsibility.  Functions  There were two alcalde ordinarios: \\"De Primer Voto\\" (First Vote Alcalde Ordinario) and \\"De Segundo Voto\\" (Second Vote Alcalde Ordinario). During former times they were called \\"Justicia Mayor\\" and \\"Justicia\\", respectively. Their functions included law-enforcement and judicial functions, watching for the public order and public safety, and the administration of justice, both civil and criminal justice. Administration of Justice took place in an alternating fashion. One of the two would carry out civil and criminal justice and would be relieved by the other Alcalde Mayor. Another custom was to have the Alcalde Ordinario de Primer Voto carry out criminal justice, while the Alcalde Ordinario de Segundo Voto would attend to civil justice matters. This was the lowest level justice system. Also, when the territorial governor or his lieutenant were not available, then the Alcalde de Primer Voto would perform as the head of the cabildo and carry out the business of city hall. If the alcalde de primer voto wasn't available (sick, away, on vacation, etc.), then the alcalde de segundo voto would take charge of running the cabildo. As their jurisdictions were both urban and rural, in 1606 the system was modified to create the posts of Alcalde de la Santa Hermandad, with one alcalde ordinario being in charge of the southern district of the jurisdiction while the other would take charge of the northern district.Adolfo Enrique Rodríguez. La policía de Buenos Aires en el período hispánico. Homenaje al cuarto centenario de la segunda fundación de la ciudad de la Trinidad y puerto de Santa María de los Buenos Aires. Instituto de Estudios Americanos, Buenos Aires, 1980. With the issuance of Royal Decree of 25 June 1804, the alcalde ordinario was also vested with powers to aid the governor in the investigation of criminal actas that carried the death penalty.Aida R. Caro de Delgado. El Cabildo o Regimen Municipal Puertorriqueño en el Siglo XVIII Tomo I, \\"Organización y Funcionamiento.\\" Municipio de San Juan and Instituto de Cultura Puertorriqueña, editors. 1965. p. 85.  Qualifications  The Alcalde ordinario was generally a layperson, that is, not versed in law. However, although this shortcoming was customarily overlooked in favor of possessing a positive attitude and common sense, it was mandatory that those chosen for these posts be among the most tried and tested individuals in the jurisdiction, and that they were also honest men who were also educated and could read and write. The men chosen for alcalde ordinario were to be men who were known to be good neighbors, and who possessed and occupied a house in the city where they were to serve. According to a decree from king Phillip II, preference was to be given to the descendants of the first settlers, since such descendants were considered to be vested with the same rights as the Spanish men born in Spain (\\"Peninsulares\\").Hialmar Edmundo Gammalsson, Los pobladores de Buenos Aires y su descendencia, Municipalidad de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires, Secretaría de Cultura, Buenos Aires, 1980.  Compared with similar titles Some sources appear to suggest that the term Alcalde ordinario was used as a way to differentiate the administrative magistrate of a jurisdiction (called \\"Alcalde\\") from the military commandant (called Alcalde de la Santa Hermandad), as both terms were in concurrent use during the 18th century. For example, Andres R. Mendez Muñoz (Hereditas, Vol 8, #1, 2007, pp. 3-15.) distinguishes between the administrative magistrate and the military commandant by adding \\"ordinario\\" (ordinary) to those alcaldes that performed during the times when the Alcaldes de la Santa Hermandad also performed.Andres R. Mendez Muñoz. Pobladores del Partido de San Francisco de la Aguada. en los juicios de residencia para principios del siglo XVIII. In, \\"Hereditas, Revista de genealogía puertorriqueña.\\" Vol 8. Issue 1. 2007. pp. 3-15. Aida R. Caro de Delgado also makes this distinction when she details the functions of both.See Aida R.

It is based in Kano. Kannywood Kannywood is the sobriquet for Hausa-language cinema. It is a part of the larger Nigerian cinema, known as Nollywood, which includes other production centres producing films in many other Nigerian languages. The name \\"Kannywood\\" is a portmanteau derived from Kano and Hollywood, the center of the American film industry.\\"Kannywood\\" has origins in the late 1990s, when Sunusi Shehu of Tauraruwa Magazine created the term Kannywood and then it became the popular reference term for the industry in the northern nigeria. The term \\"Kannywood\\" was coined in 1999, three years before the term Nollywood came about. History The Hausa language cinema slowly evolved from the productions of RTV Kaduna and Radio Kaduna in the 1960s. Veterans like Dalhatu Bawa and Kasimu Yero pioneered drama productions that became popular with the Northern audience. In the 70's and 80's, Usman Baba Pategi and Mamman Ladan introduced the Hausa Comedy to the Northern audience. = 1990s: Bollywood influence = The 1990s saw a dramatic change in the Hausa language cinema, eager to attract more Hausa audience who find Bollywood movies more attractive, Kannywood; a cinematic synthesis of Indian and Hausa culture evolved and became extremely popular.Turmin Danya (\\"The Draw\\"), 1990, is usually cited as the first commercially successful Kannywood film. It was quickly followed by others like Gimbiya Fatima In Da So Da Kauna, Munkar, Badakala and Kiyarda Da Ni. New actors like Ibrahim Mandawari and Hauwa Ali Dodo became popular and set the stage for the emergence of super-star like female actresses later on. = 2000s Kannywood = By 2012, over 2000 film companies were registered with the Kano State Filmmakers Association. A local censoring committee created by Kanywood Producers and Marketers was converted into a board and named Kano State Censorship Board in 2001 by Governor Rabiu Kwankwaso. Mr. Dahiru Beli was appointed the first Executive Secretary of the board.  Music  Songwriters and singers who produce or perform music in Hausa films include Nazifi Asnanic, Naziru M Ahmad, Ali Jita, and Fati Nijar. Umar M Sharif ,  Critics = Islamic critics = In 2003, with the rise of the Izala and the coming to power of Ibrahim Shekarau, the then ultra-religious government of Kano initiated an iconoclastic campaign against Kannywood. Numerous movies deemed irreligious were censored and some film makers were jailed. This reversed some of the gains Kannywood had made and allowed the Southern Nigerian film industry to supersede it. = Problems with government = In 2007, the Hiyana Affair: when the sex tape of a popular actress became public led to a severe backlash from the then Islamist government of Kano State under Ibrahim Shekarau. Shekarau went on to appoint a Director General for the censorship board, Abubakar Rabo Abdulkareem with the support of the Izala Society and other Islamist organisations, Kannywood and the equally popular Hausa romantic novel industry were severely censored, actors, actresses and writers were jailed by the state government and books and other media materials were burnt by the Governor himself. In 2011 the replacement of the Islamist government by a much more liberal government led by the PDP led to a more favourable atmosphere for the industry. In 2019, following the re- election of governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje as governor of Kano State, a new spate of arrests of musicians and filmmakers was launched by the Censorship Board under its Executive Secretary, Isma'il Na'abba Afakallahu. A movie director, Sunusi Oscar, and a musician, Naziru M. Ahmad, were arrested and taken to court over accusations that they released songs without the permission of the censor. The duo were released on bail. The opposition Kwankwasiyya Movement stated that the arrests were politically motivated because the accused persons were considered as sympathizers of the Peoples Democratic Party in the last general election.

Cass announced another book following The Heir, The Crown, which was released on 3 May 2016. The Selection The Selection series, which is what Cass is best known for, is a series of five young adult novels set in the fictional country of Illéa, formerly the United States. The books are about a competition known as The Selection, where citizens of Illéa compete for the current king's heir in marriage. The first three books are from the point of view of America Singer, joining the selection after bribery from her mother, who doesn't know she is in love with Aspen, who is a caste lower than her. The two sequels, The Heir and The Crown are written from the point of view of Princess Eadlyn, the firstborn daughter of Prince Maxon and Lady America Singer. = Plot and setting = America Singer is a seventeen- year-old girl who lives in the country of Illéa, which was once the United States. Their society is divided into eight castes, the lowest and poorest being Eight and royalty One. America is a Five and is in a secret relationship with a Six named Aspen Leger, which they kept hidden by sneaking out at night for dates in her backyard tree house. When America and Aspen grow apart because Aspen feels like he will never be able to provide for her, he tells her to join the Selection, a competition designed to pick a woman to become the future wife of Prince Maxon and take on the role of Queen of Illea. Although America is indifferent to the Prince and the Selection, she is pushed by her mother and Aspen's words to apply. Miraculously, she gets in and is sent to the palace, where she slowly falls for the prince and begins to learn that there are rebels who want change in the country. Aspen is drafted for the army and sent to be a guard at the palace which confuses America as her relationship with Maxon develops. Her friendship with Maxon slowly grows into affection until one day when one of the Selected girls, a friend of America, is caned and thrown out publicly for being found kissing one of the guards. America becomes enraged at the way things are run and realises what being the princess would entail, and takes it out on Maxon, becoming distant from him. As other girls are slowly eliminated from the Selection, America and Maxon slowly get closer again and apologize to each other during a rebel attack at the palace while in hiding together. Their relationship goes through many ups and downs, until Maxon sends everyone in the Selection home except for America and another girl named Kriss. Maxon tells America he loves her but finds out about her previous relationship to Aspen which she had been hiding from him. He becomes angry and takes back the known engagement. The next morning a rebel attack happens. Maxon is shot and apologizes to America, saying he does not care if she breaks his heart a thousand times, he still wants her and no one else. The King and Queen are killed by the rebels, leaving Maxon to become the King. He proposes to America and he reveals he will eliminate the castes. The next two books occur twenty years later, where Maxon and America now have four children, the oldest of which is Princess Eadlyn, the current heir to the throne. The castes have been slowly phased out, but there are still constant uprisings. To quell the public, Maxon decides to organize another Selection. =Characters= * America Singer – The protagonist of the first three novels.

Club commented that the first book in the series \\"is something of a Hunger Games rip-off, but at least it's an entertaining one\\". On 4 February 2015 The Guardian posted a review about Kiera Cass, saying, \\"Cass makes it a suspenseful read with dramatic events and romantic moments and you never know what is coming up in the next chapter\\". On 24 October 2015, The Guardian added, \\"The story is also excellent for gripping people who dont generally enjoy reading\\". The Siren Cass is also the author of The Siren. This book is about a girl who lost her family on cruise ship overturned then she was chosen to become a siren and needs to serve the Ocean for a hundred years. Her voice is deadly for humans. Then one day she meets the boy of her dreams and wants to be with him but she can't. She struggles with her emotions for a while as her \\"sisters\\" try to talk her out of him. Controversy On 12 January 2012 a one-star review of Cass' book, The Selection, was posted on the book reviewing site Goodreads, and on the reviewer's blog. Later on the same day, Kiera Cass' literary agent, Elana Roth, posted a series of derogatory tweets on the social networking site Twitter. In a conversation that Cass and Roth believed was private—but was, in fact, public—Roth called the reviewer names and both Roth and Cass discussed how best to bump the negative review down and boost positive reviews by manipulating the ranking system themselves. The controversy sparked an article by Publishers Weekly speaking out against this practice and raised an outcry from multiple reviewers, bloggers, and publications against the cyber-bullying of non-professional reviewers by authors and agents.

Paul Emsley was commissioned to paint the Duchess after being selected from a shortlist by Catherine herself. Catherine had announced the National Portrait Gallery as one of her official patronages in January 2012. Emsley took 15 weeks to complete the painting, which was presented to the trustees of the gallery in November 2012. The Duchess, contrary to considerable criticism in the art world, highly praised the portrait after viewing it initially in a private family gathering. Description Portrait of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge is the first official portrait of the Duchess. Emsley, originally of South Africa and a 2007 recipient of the BP Portrait Award, had previously painted portraits of Nelson Mandela and Naipaul. In a video interview for The Daily Telegraph, Emsley suggested that beginning he was thrilled to receive the commission. \\"Slowly\\" he says he realized the importance of the project was, not just for himself, but for many others, making him slightly nervous. The Duchess sat for him twice—for a day's session in May at the artist's studio in Bradford-upon- Avon, and a brief session in June at Kensington Palace, where he did quick drawings and took more photographs—and he used photographs to assist him. He describes her during the process as \\"quite amenable\\". It shows Catherine wearing a bottle green pussy bow blouse, looking straight out from the picture, smirking, rather than grinning. The artist noted that, if too defined, smiling portraiture occasionally may \\"look like caricatures\\". Emsley darkened the eyes slightly to match her tunic; the background is also shaded in a similar hue of dark green. Emsley was also keen to draw attention to the rich texture of her hair. Talking to the BBC after criticism of his work, he noted that he didn't want to overwhelm her face. Emsley said, \\"I don't have lots of things in the background. I do like large faces, I find them strong and contemporary. I'm interested in the landscape of the face, the way in which light and shadow fall across the forms. That's really my subject matter. To have anything else in there is really just an interference.\\" As Catherine's image \\"is so pervasive\\", he told the media he needed to go past the image on his mind. The process took him 15 weeks with the portrait completed before November 2012, when it was presented to the trustees of the gallery. The portrait is on display on the wall of Room 37 on the ground floor of the National Portrait Gallery Contemporary Collections, next to a video of a sleeping David Beckham. It was donated to the gallery by Sir Hugh Legatt with support of The Art Fund, in memory of Sir Denis Mahon. Reception The portrait divided critics, seen in a negative light by many. Michael Glover of The Independent described it as \\"catastrophic\\", and noted that it lacked context. When presented with Glover's comments on the BBC, the artist laughed them off, quipping \\"can he draw?\\" He noted that he believes in his work, and understands that there would be different points of view. Waldemar Januszczak of the Sunday Times described the portrait as \\"disappointing\\". Charlotte Higgins, of The Guardian, compared the depiction of Kate to a character in the Twilight franchise, saying, \\"The first thing that strikes you about Middleton's visage as it looms from the sepulchral gloom of her first official portrait is the dead eyes: a vampiric, malevolent glare beneath heavy lids. Then there's the mouth: a tightly pursed, mean little lip-clench (she is, presumably, sucking in her fangs). And God knows what is going on with the washed-out cheeks: she appears to be nurturing a gobbet of gum in her lower right cheek. The hair is dull and lifeless; the glimpse of earring simply lifts her to the status of Sloaney, rather than merely proletarian, undead.\\" Scotsman arts editor Andrew Eaton-Lewis suggested that \\"there's something troubling about the fact that the case against this painting is essentially that it makes a pretty young woman look less pretty and less young.\\" Eaton- Lewis commented that \\"a portrait which makes Middleton appear older, more distinguished, and more ordinary is judged to be unfit for purpose\\" was \\"depressing\\". Another art critic, Fisun Güner, a freelance visual arts writer, also criticised the painting, mentioning that the hair is painted in a spread out wavy cascade which starts to look like an advertisement for a shampoo. Fisun makes the observation that the blouse in the big-bow shape, which she is wearing covered up to the neck, makes her appear \\"stiff and rather straight- jacketed\\". However, Fisun believed the eyes look bright and lively and the jewellery, which she is shown wearing, stated to belong to her mother-in-law, are earrings made of sapphire and diamond, which bring out an animated look in the portrait. Royal Society of Portrait Painters president Alistair Adams suggested that there \\"are no airs and graces, there's no background context to allude to success or power – it's very much on a level of one to one with the viewer. It's quite natural, it's open, it's straightforward and very pure – it's immediate and not overly sentimental.\\" Stephen Deuchar, director of The Art Fund, called it a \\"captivating contemporary image\\".

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Condover, the archdeaconry of Ludlow, and the diocese of Hereford. Its benefice is united with those of 13 other parishes to form the benefice of Wenlock. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building. History The church is dedicated to Saint Peter because of its medieval association with Shrewsbury Abbey, which is dedicated to Saints Peter and Paul. The oldest part of the church is the nave, which dates from the 13th century. The south aisle was built at the same time, but rebuilt during the following century. The west tower was added in the 15th century. In 1841 or 1842 the north aisle was built, and the nave and south aisle were restored. In 1862 the chancel was built at the expense of Revd Henry Thursby- Pelham, of Cound Hall. Both the north aisle and the chancel were designed by the Shrewsbury architect S. Pountney Smith. In 1889–91 the north vestry was added, re-using the 13th-century priest's door, the architects being Paley and Austin of Lancaster. Architecture=Exterior= The church is constructed in red and yellow sandstone. In the older parts of the building the colours are used randomly, and the 19th-century additions they are deliberately arranged. The roof is tiled. The plan of the church consists of a four bay nave, a three-bay south aisle with a porch, a four-bay north aisle, a four-bay chancel rising to a higher level, and a west tower. The tower is in two stages: it stands on a plinth, and its features include diagonal buttresses, a three-light west window, a northeast stair turret, a clock face on the west side, gargoyles, three-light bell openings, and a battlemented parapet with eight pinnacles. On the summit of the tower is a pyramidal cap with a weathervane. On the side of the south aisle is a doorway and two-light windows; the east window has three lights. The windows along the side of the north aisle also have two lights; at its west end is a rectangular window and, above it in the gable, is a small quatrefoil window. The windows on the side of the chancel have two lights, and its east window is large, with five lights. There is a doorway on the south side of the chancel. In the north vestry are two-light windows and a rose window. =Interior= The arcades are carried on circular piers. In the south aisle are a piscina and an aumbry. The font is Norman, dating from the 12th century; it is tub-shaped and carved with rosettes and foliage. The pulpit is dated 1633, and is carved with colonnettes and panels. The tower screen was formerly in the chancel; it is painted with the Creed, the Lord's Prayer, and the Ten Commandments. In the chancel are re- used medieval tiles. Over the chancel arch is part of a 15th-century wall painting of the Last Judgement. The stained glass includes a small 14th- century figure in the east window of the south aisle. The east window of the chancel contains glass of 1891 by Kempe, and in the south aisle is a window of 1909 by Herbert Bryans. On the walls of the church are monuments, the oldest being dated 1736. On the north wall of the chancel is the monument of Edward Cressett, Bishop of Llandaff, who died in 1755. The two-manual pipe organ was built in the 1890s by Henry Fincham, and overhauled in 1968 by Peter Hutchins. There is a ring of six bells, all cast in 1726 by Abraham Rudhall II. External features In the churchyard are five structures, each of which is listed at Grade II. To the south of the church is a sandstone chest tomb dated 1815 to the memory of Thomas Phipps. To the east of this is another sandstone chest tomb; this is dated 1831, and is a memorial to John Dodson. Nearby is the chest tomb of Sir John Colt; it is also in sandstone, and is dated 1810. To the northeast of the church is an 18th-century dovecote. This is a two- storey structure with an octagonal plan, in red brick with sandstone dressings and a tiled pyramidal roof. Inside its walls are nesting boxes. To the southeast of the church is a sandstone cross base dating from the 18th century or earlier. It consists of four circular steps with a square socket. The churchyard contains three war graves of British soldiers of World War I. Also buried here is Admiral Sir Cecil Thursby (1861-1936), who saw distinguished service in the same war.Obituary.

It was created in 1970. The CEREMADE is a research center where applications of mathematics to areas of scientific activity as diverse as economics, finance, image and signal processing, data analysis and classification theory, mathematical physics, mechanics, epidemiology and astronomy are studied. Our main goal is the mathematical analysis of these problems, but also the numerical approach and the support to practical implementation in interaction with industry. The applications to economics and finance are of course very important for the insertion of CEREMADE within Universite Paris-Dauphine, and the much larger diversity of applications covered is crucial in order to maintain the position of CEREMADE as a center of excellence in applied mathematics. The center has about 60 permanent members and is structured in 3 main research axes (in alphabetical order): (1) Mathematics applied to economics and finance, (2) Nonlinear analysis, image processing and scientific computating, (3) Probability and Statistics. These research axes are strongly tied one to another and several members belong to more than one of these research groups. These axes do not at all constitute separate entities. We can give as an example the synergies between calculus of variations and mathematics applied to economics or between probability or statistics and finance. Other examples of such interactions between axes are given by the Analysis and Probability Seminar, which meets weekly or the Master 2 on both Analysis and Probability. The first research area is the one closest to the traditional themes of Université Paris-Dauphine, that is to say, economics, mathematical finance, insurance, risk and game theory. It is through this team that a privileged relationship has grown between the CEREMADE, the Institute of Finance, the Europlace Institute of Finance, the Risk Foundation and the various professional oriented courses and research oriented courses proposed in the Master’s of Actuarial Science (supported by the Institute of Actuaries), and in the Master 2 MASEF (jointly accredited with ENSAE). The second research area is specialized in the study of partial differential equations from a theoretical viewpoint, but also in their applications. Members of this team thus address issues appearing in different branches of mechanics (fluid mechanics, celestial mechanics, quantum mechanics), physics and chemistry (atomic and molecular physics, quantum chemistry) and optimization. Assorted tools and equations are used and studied: variational methods, methods of optimal transportation, transport equations (kinetic equations), classical methods of analysis of partial differential equations (functional analysis, asymptotic methods, a priori estimates, etc.). Some researchers in this research axis conduct research in very sophisticated image and general signal processing. This team is in charge, together with the Probability and Statistics team, of the Master 2 Analysis and Probability of Dauphine, jointly accredited with ENS Ulm, University of Versailles and INRIA. The probability and statistics group also develops research in various directions, ranging from Bayesian statistics and MCMC methods to the study of models of Statistical Physics. Probabilistic methods are also present in some research projects in finance and insurance. This team is in charge of a Master in the context of statistical signal processing, jointly accredited with ENSAE and ENST.  External links  * CEREMADE's webpage.

It was compiled by Lalia Phipps Boone and was first published by the University of Oklahoma Press in 1952. Overview The Petroleum Dictionary contains short definitions for around 6,000 terms used in the oil industry in America, with a particular focus on slang. It is intended as a record of the history of these colloquialisms, rather than a reference work for individuals in the petroleum industry. Reception Writing in the Journal of Geology, G. Frederick Shepherd from the General American Oil Company of Texas commented on the incomplete nature of the dictionary, describing it as \\"an excellent start...but not the end point\\". As an example, he highlighted the fact that it contains only 68 of the 573 abbreviations listed by Rinehart Oil News Company in a guide to language used in oil reports. He attributed these omissions partly to the fact that the work underwent more detailed reviewing by language specialists rather than industry technicians. Shepherd, however, did praise Boone for her detailed and interesting research into the history of words, and her inclusion of a number of euphemisms, which made the dictionary \\"remarkable for its freshness and occasional spice\\". Maurice Merrill, comparing the Dictionary with a similar work entitled Manual of Oil and Gas Terms, noted the absence of legal terms in Boone's work, suggesting that for individuals within the oil industry, the Manual of Oil and Gas Terms was a preferable reference work. In the Southwestern Historical Quarterly, reviewer David Donoghue highlighted several \\"errors of the inexcusable variety\\", and suggested that the dictionary had \\"little to offer\\" to the \\"oil fielder who is seriously interested in what makes the business go\\".

Built in 1862, Hillary House in Aurora, Ontario,\\"Curator to speak on gallery exhibit\\". Peterborough Examiner, June 1, 2007. is recognized by the National Historic Sites and Monuments Board as one of the best examples of Gothic Revival architecture in Canada. The building contains a collection of medical instruments, books, papers, household furnishings, and equipment dating from the early nineteenth to the late twentieth century. It has been owned by the Aurora Historical Society since 1981 and is open to the public as Hillary House, the Koffler Museum of Medicine.  History  Four doctors have lived in Hillary House with their families. They worked from home; operating their medical practice out of the dispensary and consulting room located in the front of the house. The doctors also spent a significant amount of time travelling to the homes of their patients via horse and buggy, serving Aurora and the surrounding area. Each doctor became an important part of the fabric of the community, and the Hillary family descendants would live in the home for over 100 years. * 1862 – 69: Hillary House is built for Dr. Water Bayne Geikie, b. 1830 in Scotland, d. 1917.

Lived in the house with his wife Annie Fry (d. 1904) and their 7 children. * 1894: Robert Michael Hillary acquired property from the mortgage holders. Married Edith Mussen 1895 and lived in house with their 9 children. Nora Hillary, daughter of Robert Michael, would live in the home until 1993.  Architecture  In the 18th century, a growing spirit of Romanticism and interest in the Medieval past led to a revival of Gothic styles in Britain. The style made its way to Canada in the early 19th century. As the style became accepted and popular, architects became more willing to experiment and modify its conventions. Gothic Revival spread throughout the country, appearing on buildings of all types, from civic buildings to churches to rural homes such as Hillary House and ultimately becoming part of Canadian Nationalism. Hillary House, completed in 1862, has many elements of the Gothic Revival style which was widely used in Canada at the time. These elements include a highly vertical emphasis on the structure; ornate decorations on the gables and bargeboards; the incorporation of classic Gothic trefoil forms; and lancet windows and door frames. These features are found on the exterior of the home and throughout the interior; appearing on staircases, wainscoting and more. The building’s architecture was the cause for its designation as a National Historic Site in 1971.

The factory is the third facility in India that produces railway compartments besides the Integral Coach Factory at Perambur in Tamil Nadu and the Rail Coach Factory at Kapurthala in Punjab. The factory was inaugurated on 7 November 2012.  History  The project was approved in the Supplementary Railway Budget for 2006-07. Sonia Gandhi laid the foundation stone for the factory in February, 2007 and land acquisition for the project commenced in April, 2007. However, in 2008, following the victory of the Bahujan Samaj Party in the Uttar Pradesh elections of 2007, the new government under Chief Minister Mayawati cancelled the land deed for the factory halting construction work there. The Allahabad High Court permitted the project to proceed after a public interest litigation petition was filed before it. In January 2009, construction of the factory began again which was inaugurated once again by Sonia Gandhi. The same month, Indian Railways signed a 99-year land lease agreement with the Government of Uttar Pradesh. The delay led to the cost of the project rising from an initially estimated 1685 crores to about 2500 crores.  Overview  300px The factory has come up on a total area of 541 hectares of land of which 283 was acquired from private parties. The factory was constructed by the IRCON International Limited. 1450 jobs are to be given to families that were affected by the land acquisition besides the compensation package and the Lucknow Division of the Northern Railways is expected to generate another 1000 job opportunities as a result of the factory becoming operational. The factory adheres to stringent pollution control norms for curbing air pollution and spillage of oils and employs fume and sewage neutralisation systems.

It dates from the early 1800s and has been a Grade 2 listed building since 1974. History Wyke Castle was built around 1855 in Portland stone by French exile Andrew Chadwick Fenoulhet (1820–1862). The design of the castle was influenced by the standard Martello Tower. In the early 1920s it was occupied by Edmund Selous and his wife Fanny Margaret Maxwell. Selous was a naturalist, author and traveler. The glass roofed round tower of the Castle was once decorated with his collection of butterflies. During their time at the castle, Fanny Margaret Maxwell founded the local branch of the Women's Institute in 1923, and became its first president. A Japanese built 28 tonne tug - used for coastal towing and harbour towage within Portland Port harbour limits - was named after the castle in 2004. Castle design Built from squared Portland stone, with slate and lead rooves, the castle looks out across the Fleet, Chesil Beach, Portland Harbour and Weymouth. It consists of a castellated central squat tower with a square tower, short wings and a domed cellar, which contains a fresh water well, and is known as the dungeon. The castle is ‘V’ shaped complex comprising three buildings connected by lower, pitched roof structures. The squat, round tower at the apex has a relief panelled parapet atop with domed modillions below. Within the parapet, to the north-east, is a small chimney. There are two original lancet windows, and two, three light casements which were added sometime in the late 1900s. The square tower, to the south, has a plain parapet wall and contains a small, arched window. These two structures are linked by a low, pitched roof block with a single, small, casement window. To the south-west of the round tower lies a larger, rectangular, two-storey building. The windows are small single lights and the door is set back into the wall. The hipped roof is surrounded by a parapet. The unit that connects this building is another low, pitched roof structure with a square porch. The windows are a mixture of single and three light casements.

Temple, the vice-president of a major trust company, and Belle Dorset, and they all deny any knowledge of Rosita. However, Belle Dorset is so shook up by the call that she immediately moves. Ed gets a lead in this criminal conundrum and follows it to a party. There he meets Leona Purdy, an alluring blonde woman who once knew Rosita, but who fails to reveal anything about the deceased woman. Ed starts dating Leona, but he continues his investigation of what happened to Rosita. Although his co- workers think Rosita was a promiscuous woman, Ed is convinced that she was mistreated because she was compassionate. Ed's suspicions about the circumstances surrounding her lonely death grow increasingly, especially after both Wellman and Temple start to threaten him. Tommy Ditman, Rosita's brother, eventually approaches Ed and tells him about his once so innocent sister: Rosita was only seventeen years old when she ran away from their home in Amarillo, Texas. She went to San Francisco, and Tommy tracked her down. When he arrived in San Francisco he found out that she had fallen in love with an artist, Paul Jean d'Ur. They married and moved to New York. Tommy didn't see his sister very much after that. He informs Ed that her husband Paul died in a car accident some time after their marriage went bad. Tommy says Rosita became lonely and bitter and had difficulty keeping a job. A local gangster, Blacky Franchot, is the next person to contact Ed about Rosita. They arrange to meet, but Blacky is shot before Ed arrives. Blacky lives long enough for Ed to hear him utter the words \\"I loved her\\" before he dies. Ed reports his findings to the city editor, Gribbe, who writes a long gripping column about Rosita, making her life and fate sound sensational and mysterious. Ed meets with Leona again, and this time she reveals that she and Rosita once shared an apartment in the same building as Blacky. Leona tells the story of how her roommate became involved with Balcky. He was very persistent in his pursuit of her. Rosita was attracted to him, although she was frightened of his connections to well-known gangster Wellman. She eventually fell in love with Blacky, and resisted the persistent advances of Temple, whom she met at a party. One night she returned home to find Blacky severely beaten, and they decided to move to the countryside together. Leona explains to Ed that Rosita returned to Chicago when Blacky eventually left her, and started dating Temple. Ed goes to temple with the accusation that he ordered Blacky's beatings and had him run off, but Temple denies it. Ed slowly puts the pieces of Rosita's life together despite interference from police detective Anstruder. The detective insists on accompanying Ed as he meets with invalid Hotspur Shaner, for whom Rosita worked as a housekeeper under an assumed name. The man who introduced them, John Spingler, is reported murdered, and Ed uses the distraction to get away from the police. Some time later Ed learns from Rosita's former maid, Hazel, that Rosita left Temple one year before her death, after a bitter argument in which Temple hit Rosita. As Ed leaves Hazel's building, he is knocked unconscious by two of Wellman's thugs. Ed awakens later in a junkyard. As a cover for his investigation, Ed takes Leona to a boxing match featuring fighter Bat Bennett. Bat and his manager, Jerry Cavanaugh, were the last names to be listed in Rosita's book, under Hotspur's address. Just before the fight, Ed finds Jerry and Bat arguing over the newspaper report of Rosita's death. When Bat leaves, Jerry reveals to Ed that Bat fell in love with Rosita while she was working for Hotspur. When Bat became distracted by Rosita, Jerry threatened to reveal her identity and hiding place to Wellman if she didn't end the relationship. Rosita reluctantly agreed to do this and then disappeared soon after she quit working for Hotspur. Temple is murdered, and Ed hears rumors that Wellman is responsible for the killing. Ed believes Temple used to finance Wellman's rackets. Ed finds Belle, who admits to him that Wellman originally hired Spingler to get rid of Rosita. Belle denies knowing of Spingler's duplicity until reading the newspaper account of Rosita's death the other day. Ed now knows too much, and Wellman tries to kill him. He shoots at Ed. The police arrive to the scene to his defense, but Wellman escapes. Ed is shot and wounded, but manages to sneak out of a hospital with his co-worker Pig's help. He questions Belle, who has been arrested. Belle reveals the missing link in Rosita's history: On the night of their argument, Temple admitted to Rosita, whom he was supporting, that he hired Wellman to get rid of Blacky. During the ensuing argument between the two of them, Temple struck Rosita down and panicked when she appeared to be dead. Temple then called for Wellman to help him. Ed leaves the police station with this information, when Wellman corners them in a parking garage. A shootout starts and Ed manages to kill Wellman in self-defense. At Rosita's small funeral, Ed tells Tommy the story of what really happened to his sister, and then burns Rosita's diary in the funeral parlor's \\"eternal\\" flame.

Paramount bought the film rights and announced the following year they would film it as Are Men Worth It? starring Lee Tracy and Claudette Colbert. In 1935 the project was listed on Paramount's schedule with Colbert still attached. Charles MacArthur and Ben Hecht were reportedly working on a script with Benjamin Glazer.author=No film resulted. However the success of Laura (1944) and The Big Clock (1948), which contained similar story elements to the novel, saw it put back into development as a vehicle for Alan Ladd. Robert Fellows was assigned the job of producing and Warren Duff given the job of writing the script. Donna Reed had just appeared opposite Ladd in Beyond Glory. She was borrowed from MGM again to play his co-star. Lewis Allen was assigned to direct. Filming started on 29 July 1948 on location in Chicago. The title was changed from One Woman to Chicago Deadline in November. Reception=Box office= According to Variety the film was the 37th most popular movie in the US and Canada in 1949 earning $2.1 million.Variety 4 January 1950 p 59 It earned $1.7 million the following year. =Critical response= When the film was released Stephen O. Saxe, writing for The Harvard Crimson, recommended the film due to the acting, the action and suspense. He wrote, \\"Chicago Deadline is a picture with a Twist. It's not an O. Henry twist, either ... [the picture offers] a good plot with plenty of suspense, and, in due course, lots of action ... Chicago Deadline is not the sort of picture you'd go out of your way to see; but once inside, you won't walk out, either.\\"Saxe, Stephen O. The Harvard Crimson, film review, November 16, 1949. Accessed: July 22, 2013. Film critic Bosley Crowther dismissed suspension of disbelief in his review, \\"People who picture reporters as dashing young fellows, all named 'Scoop,' whose lives are just rounds of excitement in what such people call the 'newspaper game' will find the ideal of their illusion in the newshawk Alan Ladd plays in Paramount's Chicago Deadline ... But for those other level- headed people whose knowledge of newspaper men—and, indeed, of life in general—is a little more sober and sane, this fancy will surely seem a mish- mosh of two-penny-fiction cliches, recklessly thrown together in an almost unfathomable plot. Flashbacks and narrative descriptions will fascinate them no more than will Mr. Ladd's ridiculous posturing as a brilliant newspaper man-sleuth.\\"Crowther, Bosley. The New York Times, film review, November 3, 1949. Accessed: August 10, 2013. In his review of the film, Dennis Schwartz, compared the film to Otto Preminger's Laura (1944), \\"In a Laura type of minor film noir, director Lewis Allen fails to make his love sick hero who is mooning over a corpse into anything but a superhero figure ... The film failed to make his cop character as inviting as Laura made Dana Andrews.Schwartz, Dennis . Ozus' World Movie Reviews, film review, April 30, 2002.

He graduated from Southern Connecticut State University. He spent most of the 1960s -'70s coaching at college programs such as Bridgeport (Head Coach), Massachusetts, Connecticut, Kentucky, and Kent State. Nicolau broke into the NFL with the New Orleans Saints in 1980 under then head coach Dick Stanfel. He moved on to the Denver Broncos, coaching the running backs from 1981 through 1987. Some of the players he coached included Dave Preston, Sammy Winder, and Steve Sewell. A dispute ended his tenure in Denver. He landed with the Los Angeles Raiders, but got into a dispute with another assistant coach, Art Shell. Shell was supported by owner and managing partner Al Davis, who fired Nicolau. He then went to the Buffalo Bills and served as their wide receivers coach from 1989–1991. There he worked with talents such as Andre Reed and Don Beebe. It was rumored that Nicolau left Buffalo due to a dispute with offensive line coach Tom Bresnahan who became offensive coordinator the next season. In 1992, he became the offensive coordinator of the Indianapolis Colts under head coach Ted Marchibroda with whom he worked in Buffalo. He helped the Colts to a 9–7 record in 1992 and an 8–8 record in 1994. He helped develop Reggie Langhorne as a receiver and worked with quarterback Jeff George as well. In 1994, he helped turn running back Marshall Faulk as a rookie while also working with both Jim Harbaugh and Don Majkowski at quarterback. Nicolau then spent two seasons coaching the tight ends for the Jacksonville Jaguars, helping to develop Pete Mitchell as a blocker and receiver. In 1997, Jaguars offensive coordinator Kevin Gilbride became the head coach of the San Diego Chargers and Nicolau followed him to California. There he served two years as the Chargers assistant head coach before retiring after the 1998 NFL season.

History Although settled in the early 18th century, and site of the community's church, by 1830 there were only 2 or 3 stores in the center. The arrival of the railroad in 1846 prompted more development. The Boston and Maine Railroad operated passenger rail through the Centre until January 1977 (under the auspices of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) after 1965), stopping at Lexington Depot. The former Depot building still stands, and is today the headquarters of the Lexington Historical Society. The Minuteman Bikeway exists today on the old railroad right-of-way. The most well-known historic landmark in Lexington is the Common at the junction of Mass.

It was operated by Telefónica España, the incumbent Spanish telecommunications operator. Iberpac lents its name to Iberpac Plus and Iberpac Básico, the latest X.25 services in Spain. History=Red Especial de Transmisión de Datos= Iberpac evolved from the Spanish Red Especial de Transmisión de Datos (RETD), the world's first public data network. Created in 1971, RETD was based on general-purpose Univac 418 III computers. The original Red Secundaria de Alto Nivel (RSAN) protocols for RETD were custom-developed by Telefónica (then CTNE) under ARPANET design principles. =Project TESYS= By 1978, project TESYS (Telefónica, SECOINSA, SITRE) started the development of specific- purpose switching nodes. Some of the design principles of TESYS nodes were advanced for their time (multithreading, token ring protocols). In contrast, the large user base with terminals based on legacy RSAN protocols slowed the adoption of X.25, TESYS product development and support were targeted to CTNE only (thus precluding the spread of TESYS to international markets) and data lines in Spain became slow for their time (only 2% lines above 1200 bit/s in Spain in 1982, compare 89% in West Germany). =Iberpac and Red UNO X.25= Renamed as IBERPAC, the network evolved to X.25 in the 1980s, and it was renamed again as 'Red UNO' in the 1990s. Bank branches and financial services conformed the main user base. IBERPAC enabled new videotex and teletext services, although the adoption lagged far behind the popularity of similar services in other countries, such as the French Minitel. Services based on legacy RSAN protocols were definitely scrapped in 1996. Use Until December 31, 2015, Red UNO supported two legacy X.25 services: flat-rate Iberpac Plus and pay-per-use Iberpac Básico. Iberpac services were targeted to corporate customers with specific reliability demands.

The type did not go into production and only one was built. Work on the Twin Porter started in 1966, it was a modified Pilatus PC-6 high-wing monoplane with the nose-mounted engine removed and two 290 hp Lycoming IO-540-GIB engines mounted on the wing leading edges. The prototype first flew on 28 November 1967. Only one aircraft was built as flight testing was halted in 1969.  Development  To keep development costs down, as many components as possible were adopted from the single-engine PC-6 Porter, such as the center fuselage, the wings and main landing gear. There was a new development of the forward fuselage, also with the tail and the arrangement of the propellers. The cabin was easily converted for various tasks. First drafts showed a motor assembly right and left of the fuselage nose, similar to the Dornier Do 28. A tandem arrangement of the engines like on the Dornier Wal above the fuselage, as with the earlier flying boats, was considered. In the final design, the engines were located very close, in front of the wings, to the fuselage with separate engine pylons. There was no fixed connection between the engines and the wings, but a gap as in a slat. With this arrangement, it was hoped to obtain favorable values for single-engined flight.  Flight testing  On 28 November 1967, the PC-8D prototype made its first flight. The results from more than a year of flight testing were not satisfactory, so they abandoned the project at the end of January 1969. Because of the lack of single-engine performance, approval by FAR23 was not possible. The PC-8D Twin Porter was presented also at the international air show in Paris. The only aircraft built was scrapped after the project. Simultaneously, Pilatus began the development of the training aircraft PC-7 powered by a turboprop engine. This made it possible to retrofit existing piston-engined Pilatus Porters with turboprop engines, with minimal changes to the airframe. The desired higher power of the twin PC-8D was achieved with lower operating and maintenance costs. A PC-8 with twin turboprop engines was considered, but was abandoned due to lack of market demand.

Inches Dr. James W. Inches (October 30, 1860March 29, 1952) was a physician, businessman, Michigan political figure, big game hunter and aviation enthusiast. Early life James Woffendale Inches was born in Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada on October 30, 1860, the son of Andrew and Margaret Inches. His father served as the Deputy Surveyor General of Crown Lands for the Province of New Brunswick. His father was a native of Perthshire, Scotland and a member of the Smalls of Dirnanean. Dr. Inches left Fredericton shortly after his formal education was completed. Initially he went to Toronto, Canada, but later moved to Detroit, Michigan, where he pursued a variety of business endeavors. In 1885 he relocated to St. Clair, Michigan as manager of the mineral water department of the Oakland Hotel, at that time one of the largest resorts in the United States. Building on this experience, as well as a similar position in Detroit, he became president and general manager of the Salutaris Mineral Water Company. Medical career Acting on a lifelong inclination towards medicine, and following in the footsteps of his brother, Dr. Charles Inches of New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, Canada and Scribner, Nebraska, Dr. Inches enrolled in Detroit Medical College, graduating in 1896. After receiving his medical degree Dr. Inches opened a medical office in St. Clair, where he practiced for many years. In 1908, he was named the City Physician for St. Clair, Michigan. Finding the life of a general practitioner too sedate, Dr. Inches eventually retired from active practice. In 1917 Dr. Inches accepted a position to represent the American Red Cross touring war-ravaged Europe studying hospital conditions, surgical treatments and sanitary conditions. On one such inspection he was just eight minutes ahead of the Axis troops when they broke through the Italian front. Politics Dr. Inches' entry into politics began with his election as mayor of St. Clair, Michigan in 1899. He ended up serving for five consecutive terms. In 1917 Dr. Inches accepted an appointment as the Commissioner of Health in Detroit, becoming a national figure for his views on handling the 1918 flu pandemic. He felt masks were useless in controlling the pandemic and felt limiting public events was not warranted, but ultimately he enforced the statewide closure bans. Dr. Inches felt controlling the military's entry into Detroit to be more critical to the spread of the epidemic. From January 14, 1919 to February 3, 1923 he served as the Chief of Police in Detroit under Mayor James Couzens. During his time in this office Dr. Inches successfully oversaw the relocation of the police department to new headquarters and dealt with the increase crime associated with being a border city during Prohibition. He also established the fingerprint and firearm laboratories in the city. When Mayor Couzens was appointed to the U.S. Senate in 1923, Dr. Inches attempted a bid for the office of the mayor of Detroit. He won the runoff election but lost in the general election to Frank Doremus. After his Detroit mayoral defeat, Dr. Inches retired from public life. Personal life Dr. Inches was a first class passenger on the Cunard's Pavonia steamer when it became disabled due to storms and had to be towed to the Azores for repair. He had his nose cut off in a street railway accident between St. Clair and Detroit, but successfully had it reattached. In pursuit of his hobby of big game hunting, Dr. Inches made several trips to Africa. On a 1924 trip Dr. Inches and three other Detroiters walked over seven hundred miles through the Mountains of the Moon, the Congo and Rhodesia. On his return from a second hunting expedition in 1928 Dr. Inches was shipwrecked off the east coast of Africa with the sinking of the steamer Cariboo. He spent several hours in a lifeboat before being rescued by a passing liner responding to the ship's S.O.S. call. He lost all of his luggage and hunting trophies, but was able to save several thousand feet of film from his expedition. An aviation enthusiast, the Detroit press often reported on Dr. Inches's air adventures. One such article noted him stunting in the air with a French flying ace over the Detroit River. In April 1921, Dr. Inches was reported as one of the passengers on the sixteen-hour flight of the giant aeromarine flying craft, Santa Maria, in its trip from Miami, Florida, to Washington, D.C. On another occasion he missed boarding a London to Paris flight by barely five minutes. The plane, moments later, crashed over the English Channel killing all on board. The press articles comically characterized that Dr. Inches preferred to travel by air whether he had anywhere to go or not, and that he could not hear the sound of an airplane without leaving the ground. Dr. Inches also headed the Automobile Club of Michigan for several terms. Dr. James W. Inches, a lifelong bachelor, died at the home of a nephew in Merion, Pennsylvania on March 29, 1952. He was 91 years old. His remains were cremated.  References  External links  *Find A Grave Dr. James W.

The Institute is part of Bardera Polytechnic specialized schools and institutes within the college system.  History  The Institute was created to help thousands of agro-pastoral families whose animals roam in six adjacent regions in south and southwestern Somalia, Gedo, Middle Juba, Lower Juba, Bay, Bakol and Lower Shabelle. These regions contain far more animals than the country's central, northern or eastern regions. Lower Shabele University and Bardera Polytechnic have partnered to train people to work in the agriculture and livestock industries.  Agro-pastoralism  The economy in the three Juba Valley regions, with the exception of fishing communities along the Kismayo coast, make their living with agro-pastoral practices. The Institute will be the first in southern Somalia to advocate the development and growth of the livestock sector. Following the start of the Somali Civil War in 1991, villagers and people in mid-sized towns started owning sheep, cattle or camel for milk and cash value. Most other jobs disappeared for two decades. During the 1970s and 1980s, farmers raised cattle for milk, meat and to sell at the Kismayo Livestock Market and for the meat processing plant in Kismayo. The Ministry of Livestock and National Range was the sole authority in Somalia for the welfare of domestic or wild animals.  Economic improvements  Social economists in Gedo Region led by Rowda Mohamed Barre and Bardera Polytechnic Dean Abdirahman Abdi Sheekh as well as elders in Luq, Bardera, Buale and Jilib and elsewhere in Juba Valley claimed that trained technicians helping farmers would improve the regional economy. As of 2013, only Kenya and Ethiopia buy Somalia livestock.  New markets  More wealthy markets in the Mideast receive no livestock beyond what is exported from Berbera and Bosasa ports. Only forty thousand heads of sheep and camel reach Saudi markets for two festival occasions there. None of these animals are from top livestock regions in southern Somali. The three Juba Valley Regions contain some 30% of Somalia's livestock headcount.  Wild animals  Until the 1970s, the mountain areas of Gedo hosted safari animals from elephants to cheetahs. Poachers killed most of them, but it is not uncommon to hear lions roar during the night hours. Lions, ostriches, oryx, giraffes, warthogs and hyenas are plentiful around the grassy lands of the western part of the Bardera District, between the towns of Gerileey and Fafahdun. Between Buale and Jilib, there are aggressive lions who kill animals, mostly camel coming in the area for grazing during dry season in mid-region grazing areas from El Wak to Sakow.  Zoos  Zoos have been proposed for Garbaharey, Bardera and Kismayoe.

Life  The Koszta József Múzeum in Szentes, 2007 Born on 27 March 1861, Koszta trained at various schools of art, including the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich, which he attended in 1891 on a scholarship, and the Master School of Gyula Benczúr. He studied under Károly Lotz and Bertalan Szekely. He became a member of the Szolnok Art Colony and worked largely in solitude on a farm he shared with landscape artist István Nagy for many years. Koszta's artistic vision began to emerge in the 1920s. Working in the realism school, he focused heavily on images depicting peasant life, utilizing strong tonal colors and emphasizing the interplay of light and shadow. Particularly as his work progressed, he explored the pop of bright color against dark background. His prolific body of work includes portraits, genre paintings, still life and landscapes. Prior to his death on 29 July 1949, he donated his images to the museum in Szentes, which renamed itself in his honor the Koszta József Múzeum. Koszta is also commemorated in Szentes in the names of a street and an elementary school. In 1999, the city of Budapest held a memorial in his honor. In 2005, the city of Szentes placed a Wreath of Remembrance on Koszta's grave, but research later discovered that Kostza was interred elsewhere in an unmarked grave.

The county would comprise portions of northern Lexington County and northwestern portions of Richland County, including the communities of Ballentine, Irmo, and Chapin. Although subject to change, the proposed county's name would be derived from the first letters of these three communities: (B)allentine, (IR)mo, and (CH)apin. The move to create Birch County stems from citizens and businesses that are upset with tax and regulatory policies in Richland and Lexington counties. In December 2012, Rep. Nathan Ballentine, who resides in Chapin and represents District 71 in the South Carolina House of Representatives, said \\"chances are slim to none it would ever happen.\\" History The area which would become Birch County has historically been considered to be part of South Carolina's Dutch Fork region, an area that was settled predominantly by German immigrants in the 1700s. Due to excellent arable land and access to waterways, the area was dominated by farming and remained rural in character for much of its history. While much of the proposed county remains rural, suburban development in the past few decades has increased the population and changed the characteristics of the area. The area is now best known for its middle class and affluent suburbs in the Columbia metropolitan area. Since the damming of the Saluda River and the creation of Lake Murray in the 1920s, Chapin and the northern unincorporated portions of Lexington County have not physically connected to the remainder of county, causing significant logistical issues for residents and public services. Northwestern Richland County has also had differing opinions on taxation and growth management than the balance of Richland County (especially Columbia), thus leading to a push for Birch County. Geography The proposed boundaries of the county could likely be conterminous with the Lexington & Richland County School District Five. If created, the county would be the smallest-sized county in the state. It is anticipated that the county would be bordered by Lake Murray and the existing city limits of Columbia and West Columbia to the south, by the Broad River to the east, and by Newberry County to the north and west. Communities that would be included in Birch County include Ballentine, Irmo, Chapin, Lake Murray, and White Rock. Population According to a January 2013 article in The State newspaper, the estimated population of the proposed county would be near 50,000, which would rank it in the middle range of South Carolina county populations. Based on the 2010 Census, the proposed new county would be more populated than Chesterfield County, and less populated than Cherokee County.
