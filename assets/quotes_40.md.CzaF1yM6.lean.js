In 1920, she became the first woman to serve as a legal substitute in the Estate Tax Office (Lenskontoret) and in 1933, accepting a temporary assignment, was the first woman to serve as a judge in the √òstre Landsret, one of Denmark's two high courts. She was officially appointed an √òstre Landsret judge in 1939. Biography Born on 9 June 1885 in Alexandria, Egypt, Edele Elisa Minona Ussing was the daughter of the judge Carl Johannes Ussing (1854‚Äì96) and Ebba Margrethe Puggaard (1856‚Äì1910). Thanks to her father, who served as a judge in the Mixed Courts of Egypt, she was encouraged to enter the legal profession. After matriculating from N. Zahle's School in Copenhagen in 1904, she studied law at the University of Copenhagen, graduating in 1909 as one of just two female students. After a short period serving as a legal proxy, in 1910 she was engaged by the Ministry of Justice as a temporary assistant, officially becoming an assistant the following year. From 1915 to 1922, she served as a secretary in the Estate Tax Office (Lenskontoret) and in 1920 became the woman to be recognized as a legal proxy at the ministry. Ussing was also active on the political front. In 1917, representing the Conservative People's Party, she became a candidate for the municipal elections in the Copenhagen district of Frederiksberg, standing for the parliamentary elections in 1918 and 1920. She was also a member of Frederiksberg's electoral committee (1916‚Äì23) and of the Danish Women's Conservative Association (1918‚Äì21). From 1914 to 1917, she served on the board of the Women Readers' Association and from 1918 to 1923 on that of the Danish Women's Society. In 1923, she was appointed deputy chair of Copenhagen's children's welfare council (v√¶rger√•det) where she served for ten years. In 1933, she was entrusted with a temporary appointment as a judge in the √òstre Landsret, one of Denmark's two high courts. As it was the first time a female lawyer had filled such a high position, it led to considerable attention in the press. In 1939, she was officially appointed an √òstre Landsret judge, becoming a presiding judge in 1945. She held the post for the remainder of her life. Elisa Ussing died in Frederksberg on 7 March 1949. She is buried in H√∏rsholm Cemetery.

This version of the Tatischev family's genealogy had made it to the Velvet Book. A cadet branch of the family bears the title of counts. The Tatischevs are listed in the Parts 5 (titled nobility) and 6 (ancient nobility) of the genealogical books of Moscow, Tver, Tula, Kostroma, Penza and Saint-Petersburg governorates. From the four lineages of the family, the cadet one was granted the title of counts in 1801.  History  According to the genealogical books, the progenitor of the Tatischevs was Prince Vasily Yuryevich nicknamed Tat-isch (Russian: –¢–∞—Ç—å- –∏—â—å), the son of Prince Yuri Ivanovich of Solomerech (Solomirsky), the son of Prince Ivan Dmitrievich Shah, the Prince of Solomerech, who served to Duke Ivan III. The family legend claims that Vasily Yuryevich was the viceroy of Duke Vasily I of Moscow at Veliky Novgorod in the early 1400s, but other sources do not mention him as the viceroy.

From 1998 to 2007, she was Professor of Sociology at the Institute of Education, after which she was Emeritus Professor of the Sociology of Education and Gender there.  Life  Diana Mary Leonard was born in Trinidad on 13 December 1941; her father was a scientist, her mother a teacher. After the Second World War, the family moved back to the United Kingdom, and Diana continued her education at Brighton and Hove High School and then at Girton College, Cambridge, where she read natural sciences; she developed an enthusiasm for anthropology during her degree but after graduating in 1961 trained and worked as a science teacher in Clapham (1964‚Äì67). On relocating to Swansea with her husband's work, she found herself out of a job. She went back to education, this time embarking on doctoral studies at University College, Swansea; returning to social anthropology, she decided to study courtship and marriage in South Wales. Her PhD was awarded in 1977 for her thesis \\"Sex and generation: a study of the process and ritual of courtship and wedding in a South Wales town\\". In the meantime, she became active in the Women's Liberation Movement. She took part in a project under Christine Delphy in Paris (1975‚Äì77) which examined the ways that women were oppressed in the domestic sphere, a process which encouraged and helped to refine her materialist‚Äìfeminist critique of the family. She also helped to edit Trouble and Strife, a feminist journal; and helped to found the Women's Research and Resources Centre (later renamed the Feminist Library) in London in 1975. The next year, she was appointed to a lectureship in sociology at the Institute of Education, part of the University of London. There, she established the Centre for Research on Education and Gender in 1984, which explored issues facing women and girls during schooling and university education. Between 1980 and 1983, she was seconded to the Open University to oversee the creation of its women's studies course. Aside from a number of visiting professorships, Leonard remained at the Institute of Education for the rest of her career, which culminated in her appointment in 1998 as Professor of Sociology. She retired in 2007 but remained there as an emeritus professor. She was elected an Academician of the Academy of Social Sciences in 2006 and a fellow of the Society for Research in Higher Education two years later.Miriam David, \\"Diana Leonard obituary\\", The Guardian, 9 December 2010.

Fisk had been authorized to recruit a regiment of infantry, but this authority was modified a month later, making the organization a regiment of mounted rifles. The companies of which it was composed were principally raised in the counties of Erie, Niagara, Wyoming, Orleans, Allegany and Wayne, and were mustered into the U. S. service from Oct., 1863, to Feb., 1864, for three years. The regiment left the state in March, 1864; served as infantry attached to the 22nd Corps at and near Washington until May; then joined the Army of the Potomac, engaged in the Richmond Campaign, where it was first assigned to the Provisional Brigade, 1st division, and later to the 1st Brigade, 2nd Division, 9th Corps; saw its first fighting at Spotsylvania Court House; lost heavily at Cold Harbor where its casualties amounted to 64 killed, wounded and missing; and in the assaults on the Petersburg works in June it again suffered severely, having 18 killed, 82 wounded and 2 missing. At the mine explosion it was again in action with Potter's division, and sustained a loss of 48 killed, wounded and missing. In the action at Poplar Spring Church its casualties were 76. The regiment was now mounted and served with the 3rd Brigade, 2nd Cavalry Division (Crook's), Army of the Potomac, losing 33 killed, wounded and missing at Hatcher's Run and Nottoway Station. It performed its full share during the campaign leading up to Lee's surrender at Appomattox, its casualties from March 28 to April 9, 1865, amounting to 62 killed, wounded and missing. After the close of the war it served in the Department of Virginia until mustered out under the command of Lieut.-Col. Joseph H. Wood, at Petersburg on Aug. 10, 1865.

Leaders from a number of member states addressed the UNGA.  Organisation and subjects  The order of speakers is given first to member states, then observer states and supranational bodies. Any other observers entities will have a chance to speak at the end of the debate, if they so choose. Speakers will be put on the list in the order of their request, with special consideration for ministers and other government officials of similar or higher rank. According to the rules in place for the General Debate, the statements should be in of the United Nations official languages of Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian or Spanish, and will be translated by the United Nations translators. Each speaker is requested to provide 20 advance copies of their statements to the conference officers to facilitate translation and to be presented at the podium. The theme for this year's debate was chosen by President Mar√≠a Fernanda Espinosa as: \\"Making the United Nations relevant to all people: Global leadership and shared responsibilities for peaceful, equitable and sustainable societies.\\"  Speaking schedule  Since 1955, Brazil and the United States are the first and second countries to speak. For this session, however, President of the United States Donald Trump arrived late, causing President Len√≠n Moreno of Ecuador to speak second. Other countries follow according to a speaking schedule issued by the Secretariat. The list of speakers is provided by both the daily UN Journal, while changes in order are also reflected by the UNGA General Debate website. = 25 September = ;Morning session * ‚Äì Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres * ‚Äì 73rd Session of the United Nations General Assembly Mar√≠a Fernanda Espinosa * ‚Äì President Michel Temer * ‚Äì Constitutional President Lenin Moreno Garc√©s * ‚Äì President Donald J.

All speeches are made from the floor, as opposed to the podium for the General Debate. Azerbaijan's delegate took the floor to reply to Armenia in saying that the prime minister talks of the Velvet Revolution while he is the same as his predecessors. He added words needed to be put into action to mean something. This ought to start with the start with return of Azeris to Nagorno-Karabakh (NKO), the occupied districts and some exclaves. He suggested that Armenia had ethnically expelled non-Armenians while other minorities, including Armenians, were living in Baku and elsewhere in the country. Armenia then replied to Azerbaijan's statement. Azerbaijan took the floor for the second time in saying that it demanded cessation of hostilities first and foremost from Armenian forces. \\"Armenia intentionally disregarded the Security Council to establish a stable ceasefire. Events before and after each resolution makes clear that Armenia issues baseless allegations and leave no doubt as to who continues hostilities. [There is] no doubt claims by Armenia run counter to the norms of international law and are without foundation. NKO and the seven surrounding districts of Azerbaijan are under Armenian military occupation. Armenia has established a subordinate regime that is unrecognized and under the control of Armenia. This was formed by racism[, etc]. Armenia's claims are a threat to peace and security. [Armenia's actions are a result] of deep political crisis and the economic situation in that country. [There is] no doubt the international community has not heard from the Armenian delegation and what problems the economy faces: an economic drop and high [em]migration of its citizens. Neither the prime minister nor the delegation, in the statement, mentioned any efforts the government makes [in this regard] and to implement the Development Goals. [There is] silence because there is nothing to say. As I said before and will stress again, the earlier Armenia realises the lack of any prospect for its dangerous agenda, the quicker the conflict would be solved and the two countries will benefit from peace...\\" Armenia then used its second reply to say that one should recall media outlets which featured all the details and descriptions given on the \\"massacre of the Armenian population in Azerbaijan. Who attack who first, how it started, what was the source [of the conflict]...it is important that people read the papers from 30 years ago not today because today from Azerbaijan they are merely lying on what happened 30 years ago. Unfortunately, there is no single human rights activist, human rights defender [or anyone] who speaks freely in Azerbaijan because those who spoke correctly are behind bars these days. The Security Council's call for hostilities to stop was made by Armenia on May 1,1994 when it was willing to sign a ceasefire of the de facto NKO, Armenia signed on to it. The main parties are Azerbaijan and NKO authorities. It is awful to see what happens in Azerbaijan...[unlike] any visitor from any country in the world, whether for tourism or business, [would see NKO] is sincere in its values. [Meanwhile] all the blackmail is made by Azerbaijan to limit freedom to travel, freedom of movement [on NKO authorities]. NKO is fully abiding by...unilaterally abiding by rules. It has unilaterally ratified important UN convention like the civil and political rights, rights of the child, economic and social rights and other important documents. Armenia will be soon presenting...sorry NKO [will be] voluntary presenting its national review for high level review on developmental goals progress. the threat is only from Azerbaijan. This is exacerbated by a 1,000 Azerbaijani citizens fighting in the so-called Azeri Brigade of ISIS who have appeared on the border. They have declared to leave Raqqa to fight NKO...[to restart the war but have] luckily, and not surprisingly, and logically lost the war they had again started by Azerbaijan. Peace negotiations are in the format of the OSCE Minsk Group. The main principles put forth are [1.] the non use of force of threat of force, [2.] territorial integrity, and the [3.] rights of the people. Azerbaijan seemingly forgets self-determination and territorial integrity. The solution is in the negotiation format and these are the three important principles. = 27 September = ;Morning session * ‚Äì President Dalia Grybauskaitƒó * ‚Äì President Mokgweetsi Eric Keabetswe Masisi * ‚Äì President Nicos Anastasiades * ‚Äì President Sebasti√°n Pi√±era Eche√±ique (Scheduled) * Republic of Macedonia ‚Äì President Gjorge Ivanov * ‚Äì President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo * ‚Äì President Jovenel Mo√Øse * ‚Äì President Sebasti√°n Pi√±era Eche√±ique * ‚Äì President Julius Maada Bio * ‚Äì President Mahmoud Abbas * ‚Äì President of the European Council Donald Tusk * ‚Äì Prime Minister Charles Michel * ‚Äì Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu * ‚Äì Prime Minister Joseph Muscat * ‚Äì Prime Minister Mamuka Bakhtadze * ‚Äì Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc * ‚Äì Prime Minister Andrew Holness * ‚Äì Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern * ‚Äì Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves ;Evening session * ‚Äì President Patrice Athanase Guillaume Talon (Scheduled) * ‚Äì President Peter Christian * ‚Äì President Jos√© M√°rio Vaz * ‚Äì President Azali Assoumani * ‚Äì President ad interim Rivo Rakotovao * ‚Äì Vice President Muhammad Jusuf Kalla * ‚Äì Vice President Daniel Kablan Duncan * ‚Äì Vice President Epsy Campbell Barr * ‚Äì Prime Minister K.P.

The Israeli regime has a long history in following opportunistic policies to mislead others. The intention of this psychological reactionary behaviour is to divert attention from its savage and inhuman actions against Palestinians and other Arab nations. This has brought so much suffering, caused so many crises and caused so much instability and brought anger to the region. The Israeli regime continues to be the top spoiler of stability and peace in the region and the Middle East. The Israeli showman has no temerity particularly to accuse Iran. His fallacies in his statements confirm his pathological tendencies...distort reality. This is to distract attention from his regimes inherent cruelty towards Palestinians. To cover up the killing of defenseless, innocent women and children. To cover the fact that millions of Palestinians have been taken hostage by Israel for decades...[it is the] last apartheid regime in the world...[It] conceal[s] reality that this is the only regime in the world that openly practices racism...[it maintains] the worlds biggest open prison, Gaza. [Netanyahu] stands here once again to make a statement filled with despicable lies. No amount of lies, no amount of application will cover up the criminal nature of Israel. This is a dreadfully regressive and undemocratic regime led by a corrupt leader who pretends to be progressive and democratic. [The] Israel[i] prime minister...[is] very close to, namely, Daesh. Israel['s] absurd claim of being democratic has [re-]called similar [to] that [of the] Nazis used to make before dragging the world into destruction. Democracy for [a] racist [government] that crushes the dreams of the true owners of Palestine for self- determination. That is a mockery of democracy. That is the tyranny of racists. In fact, Israel is the enemy of democracy in the Middle East. It hates democracy...there would be no room for Israel in the Middle East should democracy prevail. The Israel[i] regime that rejects all UN purposes and principles in its practices and policies and defies all UN resolutions only uses this august assembly to mislead others. As an example lets see how many UN resolutions [have been] violated by Israel. It is about 300 [ranging] from weapons of mass destruction, to a nuclear weapons free zone in the Middle East. On the Israel-Palestinian related issue alone Israel has violated 225 United Nations Security Council resolutions; at least resolution 2324 calls for an end to Israeli settlement building. on 20 September 2018, almost all members. of course except Israeli big patron [the] U.S...urged [for a] to end defying the resolution. Israel holds the record of ignoring [the most] UNSC resolutions, the symbol of international law. To do [so] relies mainly on [the] U.S. to date. [The] U.S. has used its veto power a total of 44 times to shield Israel from Security Council draft resolutions for Israel. Mister President, exhibiting some photographs...[as they did] today the Israeli showman claims [to have] discovered new nuclear facilities in Iran. This is yet another false story. It is not surprising as [he is] lying...[with] such publications. He should stop threatening Iran with nuclear annihilation, as he did recently. Such an infantile statement against a NPT party constitutes a serious violation of international law and the UN charter. Recalling [that] the Israeli regime has attacked two nuclear facilities in the region in the past, the Security Council should strongly condemn threats by this regime to use such weapons on Iran. It should also be compelled to its abandon its nuclear weapons, to accede to the NPT without pre-conditions and place all of its nuclear facilities under IAEA safeguards. this regime should stop the de- stabilising conduct and frequent encouragement against the countries of the region. [It should stop] its regular violation of Syrian and Lebanese air space and put an end to its various airstrikes to targets in Syria. These airstrikes serve as support to terrorist groups. Let's be clear, we watch Israel's criminal behaviour wherever they do it. The time [of] Israel hitting its neighbours with impunity is passed.

Indonesia responded in regards to West Papua comments made by Vanuatu. The delegate said that \\"these countries have it in their heads that the group of people are different...Mayhem creates fatalities to one's own families. Indonesia categorically rejects any efforts to disturb West Papua...[to] accuse Indonesia of gross violations of human rights is serious and unacceptable. No country in the world is free from human rights [aggressions] or other challenges. One has so many problems of its own [that this] is like the pot calling the kettle black. Vanuatu is not part a party to [many human rights] instruments,; Indonesia is a party to eight out of nine. Vanuatu is not a party to the convention to eliminate all forms of racial discrimination. Indonesia is diverse and hundreds of ethnic groups, thousands of tribes and hundreds of languages. [We are] not defined by racial identity but are diverse. Just to remind Vanuatu, customary international law of the convention of 1933 on the rights and duties of states clearly stipulated four elements [in regards to]: 1. population; 2. territory; 3. government; 4. capacity [for] relations with other states. [It] never [mentions matters] on race for rights to be in conflict. Let me remind Vanuatu of history. Almost 50 years on this very same forum, in this very same group, in this very same august chamber, all of us in the UN have decided the final status of West Papua as an integral and legitimate part...[the] resolution of 1969...was adopted with no country's voting against [it]. The people of Papua affirm their unity with Indonesia. In other words, what Vanuatu is propagating is an outrageous challenge to Indonesia. [The] decision [made] by the then 128 members, almost half a century ago...[is a prerequisite] Indonesia and every responsible member of the UN [is in line with the] Charter. For that reason Vanuatu['s claims]...against Indonesia violates the principle of the Charter and that should be enough. Since last year, Vanuatu incorporates [such] people into its delegation. Such hostility has no place in the UN system. No country that supports [the] dismember[ment] of any country should now sit at the UN. We could not care less what motiv[ations there] are. Indonesia strongly and firmly defends its sovereignty, territorial integrity and dignity.\\" Saudi Arabia responded to Qatar to (in Arabic) in saying that the comments made by Qatar came from a country that \\"supports extremists and incites violence for a long time. [It is the] headquarters of political Islam and [hosts] many extremist organisations, such as the Nusra Front...and allows factions on its television screens. One Al-Qaeda member entered Qatar...and Saudi Arabia arrested some members when they entered in[to] our country, Qatar and the U.S.A. knows [this]. Qatar supports separatists in Saudi Arabia and U.A.E. to destabilise the region...is not terrorism of Saudi Arabia, in fact Qatar supports and finances terrorism...[that] my governments prevents Qatari pilgrims is not true; we welcome them after completing administrative procedures. The data is registered on our website; all digital transactions are complete. Qatari pilgrims have rights and have chosen different packages, like pilgrims from elsewhere in the world. They arrive at the airports and on Qatar Airways. Qatar then responded to Saudi Arabia on its second intervention (in Arabic) in saying \\"when in June 2017 Saudi Arabia tried to make an act of aggression through its embargo against the sovereignty and is rejected by international law. Qatar suffered from a mendacious approach. [One] can see [this] through Saudi media on this accusation. It is bizarre that this mendacious accusation is at UNGA where one should discuss how to strengthen international relations between countries. We reject [the comments by] by The Saudi delegation and insist Qatar will do [its] best to prosper...while protecting human rights. [It is] best to build stability and fight terrorism in our region. President, I will not be able to speak again since this is the second right to reply in General Assembly procedures. [We] reserve the right to respond to accusations in writing and have [it] in the minutes of [the] meetings.\\" = 29 September = ;Morning session * ‚Äì Foreign Minister Edgars Rinkƒìviƒçs * ‚Äì Minister for Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade Rimbink Pato * ‚Äì Foreign Minister Yousuf bin Alawi bin Abdallah * ‚Äì Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj * - Deputy Prime Minister Syrian Arab Republic‚Äì Walid Al-Moualem * ‚Äì Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho * ‚Äì Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel * ‚Äì Foreign Minister Yldiz Pollack-Beigle * ‚Äì Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan * ‚Äì Minister for Foreign and Political Affairs and Justice Nicola Renzi * ‚Äì Secretary of Foreign Alan Peter Cayetano * ‚Äì Federal Minister for Europe, Integration and Foreign Affairs Karin Kneissl * ‚Äì Foreign Minister Shaikh Khalid Bin Ahmed Al-Khalifa * ‚Äì (Scheduled) * ‚Äì (Scheduled) * Brunei Darusallam ‚Äì (Scheduled) * ‚Äì Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Ez√©chiel Nibigira * Brunei Darusallam ‚Äì Second Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Dato Erywan Pehin Yusof * ‚Äì Foreign Minister Makhdoom Shah Mahmood Qureshi * ‚Äì Foreign Minister Denis Moses * ‚Äì Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al Nahyan ;Evening session * ‚Äì President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov * ‚Äì Deputy Prime Minister Jan Ham√°ƒçek * ‚Äì Foreign Minister Saleumxay Kommasith * ‚Äì Minister for Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade Wilfred Elrington * ‚Äì Foreign Minister Osman Mohammed Saleh * ‚Äì Foreign Minister Urbino Jos√© Gon√ßalves Botelho * ‚Äì Foreign Minister Sidiki Kaba * ‚Äì Minister for Foreign Affairs, Cooperation and Regional Integration Kalla Ankourao * ‚Äì Foreign Minister Francine Baron * ‚Äì Foreign Minister Jean-Claude Gakosso * ‚Äì Foreign Minister Peter David * ‚Äì Foreign Minister Ahmed Awad Isse * ‚Äì Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Alpha Barry Right to Reply Qatar responded (in Arabic) to the \\"false accusations mentioned in the statements of the U.A.E. and Bahrain. Mister chairman‚Ä¶[we have]developed consensus that Qatar is innocent of the accusations targeted at it. In fact, we are active in promoting peace...These fake accusation have never been substantiated by any credible international party...[and, thus, they] violate international human rights law. What the cause of suspicion is that we find these states throw allegations and do not practice what they preach, [they] do not practice sovereignty and interfere in the sovereignty of other states. [They] do not respect human rights... [they] financed [an] unsuccessful coup attempt in Qatar, [they then] implemented a blockade on Qatar. [They] continue to lie and lie until people are expected to believe [them], [all the while] using modern technology in [such] attempts. The U.A.E. has...to finance greatest acts of terrorist in modern days [and it] allows perpetrators to escape through its territory. While states pretend to combat terrorism, everyone knows terror is launched from these countries...[It is]regrettable [that this has] reached this level of conspiracies. [It is] regrettable Bahrain...represents [a] real crisis with[in its] lines of leadership in Bahrain. Instead of solving internal issues [it prefers] fabrications...[and] holding conferences and presenting misleading discourse. Results [are] never in Bahrain's favour thus [it is] necessary to exercise this Right of Reply. The situation in Bahrain does not allow [them] to speak of human rights. Bahrain should comit to international conventions and respect human rights...[it should also] know that solving domestic issues [will] not be attained by false allegation. Bahrain should best apply [solutions that do not] seek to marginalize its own citizen [instead of] unilateral measures that are illegal[y] taken by Bahrain against my country...[It would be better] to achieve prosperity and combat terrorism. Mister chairman,...[it is] no longer a secret U.A.E. is irresponsible in its behaviour in other regions. It is attempting to destabilise regional bodies like the GCC. [It is] disrespecting international law and the principle of good neighbourliness. The U.A.E. evade[d] implementation of Security Council resolutions. [It has] become widely known U.A.E. relies on mercenary, mercenary companies in the region. It uses espionage...[against] regional countries...[As a result of] the U.A.E.'s record in the region and [on] the international stage...any sane person knows the U.A.E. ignores international conventions and destablises the Middle East and Africa and beyond. [It has] become the leading party to destabilise and to destroy. The U.A.E. punishes freedom of expression with 15 years of prison. [In]Yemen,...[there have been] crimes against humanity by the U.A.E. Last July the International Court of Justice issued a verdict against the U.A.E. because of its discrimination to[wards] Qatari nationals and [in regards to the] Convention to Combat all Forms of Racial Discrimination. The U.A.E. [promised it would be] reuniting families; offering opportunities to Qatari students affected by [the] U.A.E.['s] policies in order to resume [their] studies in the U.A.E.; and 3. allowing Qatari nationals to have access to [the] U.A.E. courts. Mister chairman, this decision by the International Court of Justice is the best evidence against the U.A.E. [and] reveals its role in the fabricated crisis against Qatar....I wonder how has the U.A.E. respects human rights [in the body] it [has been] appointed to.\\" India responded to Pakistan in saying: \\"Mister President, my delegation came to this august assembly to listen to the new foreign minister of Pakistan...what we heard is [a] new Pakistan cast in the mold of the old Pakistan. Mister president, [I] take the floor to reply [and] reject the baseless allegations of Pakistan. Amongst the most outrageous was...on [the attack at the] Peshawar school four years ago. Let me recollect, [there was an] outpouring of pain in India following the massacre. Both houses of India's parliament expressed solidarity and memory to those killed. Schools all over India held two minutes of silence in memory. [Their comments are a] despicable claim to the memory of [those] killed...Pakistan [has] created [attempts] to destabilise neighbours...let me make clear Jammu and Kashmir will remain an integral part of India. Mister president, we have heard Pakistan has turned the tide on terrorism. Let us fact check them. Can Pakistan deny it is the host of [several] terrorist groups[, including] 22 sanctioned by the UN sanctions regime as of today? Will Pakistan deny that the UN designated terrorist Hafiz Saeed has a free run and sets up candidates for office? We have noticed effort by Pakistan to champion human rights. This is verbal...[a] Princeton professor...[appointed to a national committee in the country has his] removal on [the] grounds he belongs to a minority. Before preaching to the world, preaching human rights should begin at home...Mister president, the new foreign minister of Pakistan chose to term the gruesome killings of our [security personnel]...on flimsy grounds. [In India] every life counts...To conclude, mister president, what we have heard is fake...Pakistan must demonstrate it has moved beyond deceit and distortion.\\" Speaking in Arabic in response to Qatar, the United Arab Emirates \\"wish[ed] to exercise [our] Right to Reply on the allegations and false representations of Qatar. It is deplorable Qatar, as usual, adopted political maneuvers to exacerbate [tense relations]...instead of focusing on illegal attitudes which should be redressed...Qatar international[ises] dimensions to the crisis by [falsifying] discussion[s] on [the] legal measures taken by the U.A.E. in co-operation with Bahrain, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Egypt against Qatar. Qatar is trying to disseminate false notions taken by our countries. [It has had] destabilising attitudes for decades. Qatar interfered in other Arab states and promotes [extremist] ideologies...[it] finance terrorist groups...[in] flagrant violations of international law [and] multilateral agreements. [It is] also [a] severe threat to our countries and others around the world. The measures we took are targeted measures against the illegal measures by the Qatari regime. The U.A.E. fully respects the people of Qatar. In this vein, the U.A.E. ha[s] implemented measures for most of the people of Qatar not to be affected by these measures against the regime. Therefore the allegations made by Qatar [are false].\\" Bahrain also responded with a similar rebuttal as the U.A.E. while adding the \\"maritime and air corridor is open. So [this] contradicts [the statements of Qatar]. [An] emergency air corridor for passengers [is also open]...Qatar must [adhere to the] Riyadh declaration in 2014 and supplementary [conventions] in 2014.\\" Pakistan responded to India's reply in calling it a \\"diatribe\\" and a \\"homily [by a] pontiff\\" while comparing it to the RSS. He then called upon examples of human rights violations in Kashmir by Indian security personnel such as tying a man to a car and using him as human shield against stone throwers and running a person over by a Jeep. He continued in saying India is a country \\"where unabashed Hindu Yogi Adityanath serves as chief minister of Uttar Pradesh‚Ä¶[where] in Assam migrants are called 'termites'...[where] liberal India today has no room for dissent...[India] continues to face over 70 domestic insurgencies. As for Jammu and Kashmir, I would urge the representative to look beyond obfuscation and denial to answer simple questions...Kashmir is [an] international dispute by the numbers of [UN] resolutions, can India deny [not] using a plebiscite for [the] wishes of [the] Kashmir[I people]? Can India deny killings in Kashmir [which are] well document by international [media and organisations]?...Can India deny using indiscriminate?...The true face of India in Kashmir shown again...speaks of a litany of human rights [violations]‚Ä¶[It is better for the] truth by facing up to it. The truth is Jammu and Kashmir is not a part of India. [It] never was and never will be. [This reality has] no expire date...mister president, India can hide behind semantics, [it] can regurgitate [comments] against Pakistan but [it] cannot hide... [it] can hide voices but [it can]not suppress [what the] international community [has] articulated by human rights commissions. The dead of Jammu and Kashmir tell of a different face. [It is] time for India to abandon double speak...Phony bravado can win an election but not credibility.\\" Qatar used its second reply (in Arabic) in saying that what has been \\"heard from the U.A.E. and Bahrain are baseless [and sought] to distort the image of Qatar and aim to undermine Qatar's international relations...[Our] response since [the blockade has been one of a] period [of] dialogue...[We have been] empowering youth and women and other initiatives...[So as not to] impede efforts by the international community, therefore [we have] exercise[d] self restraint...The U.A.E. and Bahrain continue to destabilise and violate human rights.

The botanical garden was established in 1797, which makes it one of the oldest such gardens in Poland. In 1965, the botanical garden was merged with a newly-opened zoo. Since 2007, it has been a member of the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA). History In the second half of the 17th century, a historical manor house with a complex of outbuildings and a garden had existed on the area of the current Zoo and Botanical Garden in Toru≈Ñ. In 1797, Johann Gottlieb Schultz purchased the whole area and started planting various trees and shrubs in order to establish a botanical garden. The garden was supposed to be sentimental in character, therefore, many bridges, locks, pergolas, aviaries, and greenhouses were constructed. He acquired and planted a number of rare species of European plants, which became the foundation of the botanical garden. After his death, the garden became the property of the Protestant Royal Academic Gymnasium in Toru≈Ñ (Kr√≥lewskie Gimnazjum w Toruniu). When the World War I came to an end, the garden experienced a period of decline and became partly overgrown with weeds. In the 1920s, during a time of rapid development in the Second Polish Republic, the botanical garden was gradually revitalized. In 1963 and 1964, thanks to Arnbert Sadecki, who resided in Argentina, a number of animals were transferred to Toru≈Ñ, which led to the creation of the zoological garden. Among the first animals in the zoo were llamas, parrots, and domestic yaks. New aviaries and pavilions were built. Since 1970s, the zoological garden has been open to visitors. In the 1990s, the zoo acquired new animals species such as monkeys, raccoon dogs, and Barbary sheep. Since 1993, the zoo has been receiving funding from the Toru≈Ñ city authorities. A Mini Zoo, which offers children the possibility of playing with the animals, was also opened in this period. In the zoo visitors can also see such animals as brown bears, European bisons, meerkats, mouflons, lynxes, porcupines, ostriches, Reeves's muntjacs, red-necked wallabys, long-tailed gorals, alpacas, and wild goats. Among the notable legally protected plants in the garden's collection are: Platanus √ó acerifolia, Austrian pine, Ginkgo biloba, Turkish hazel, Fagus sylvatica and European oak.

Life Giuseppe Emanuele Ventimiglia was born in Palermo in 1766, the first son of Prince Vincenzo and his wife Anna Maria Cottone di Castelnuovo. Since an early age he was sent to Rome to study in the Collegio del Nazareno and then for a grand tour of Europe, going through Italy, Switzerland, the German Empire, Hungary and Poland. During this last stop of the tur he made acquaintance with Stanislao Poniatowski and accompanied him for his encounter with Catherine the great. During this journey with the Empress he visited Kiev and Kherson, sailing on the Dnieper river. Once in Crimea he came back through Moldavia and Valachia, stopping at Bucharest, then through Prussia, Saxony then France and finally England. Back in Paris, knew there his cousin Charlotte Ventimille, belonging to the French branch of his family, and he married her, before going back to Palermo with her. The cultural life in Palermo was led by a circle of intellectuals gravitating around his uncle Carlo, Prince of Castelnuovo, and he had the chance to meet the astronomer Giuseppe Piazzi and the economist Paolo Balsamo amongst others. He joined the fight to keep open the Accademia Palermitana degli Studi, threatened by King Ferdinand who wanted to clear it up from liberal influences and hand it back to the Jesuits. Because of his ideas he became one of the key figures of the new Sicilian society under the British protectorate over the island: he was held in great esteem by British prime minister Charles Grey for a possible Anglo-Sicilian alliance to overshadow the Austrian influences of Queen Maria Carolina and her entourage, who were more favourable to the French of Murat. To this end, Ventimiglia formed a militia of 30.000 armed men \\"for the preservation of the existing form of government, of the properties of the individuals, and the privileges of the various orders of society\\". Angst these privileges there was one that Ventimiglia considered intolerable: a fixed donation to Naples not sustained by any formal right and that was more resembling a medieval \\"donatio\\"; he proposed its replacement with a land tax to be based on a land registry, to ve eventually integrated with a form of indirect taxation only if the former were to be insufficient. He openly sustained Louis Philippe, Duke of Orl√©ans, brother in law of the king, and asked the Queen to dismiss the Neapolitan ministers (especially Medici) and also the creation of an independent Sicilian administration, one where the barons could have a meaningful role in the government of the affairs of Sicily once Naples had been conquered back. Along with other 43 aristocrats, Ventimiglia was arrested in the night between the 19th and the 20th of July 1811 and locked up with three others in the Castle of Saint James on the island of Favignana. The formal accusation was based on a series of intercepted letters in which the prince proved to have a secret correspondence with the Prince Regent, asking for a British intervention (even armed if necessary) to protect and defend the rights of the Sicilian population against the will of the Crown. He remained imprisoned notwithstanding his poor health until the 20th of January 1812 when he was freed upon the intervention of lord Bentinck. Immediately Ventimiglia and others started working on a draft for a new Sicilian Constitution, modelled after the British one that he considered the ideal median way between monarchy and democracy. These works resulted in the Sicilian constitution of 1812. At the same time, the ties with England were made even more apparent through the appointment of lord Bentinck to the office of Foreign Secretary, while Britain was keeping the island under her protection against the French. With the Restauration, King Ferdinand officially regained control of Sicily and as a result, Ventimiglia and his collaborators were dismissed. As an extreme measure to try and save the Sicilian Constitution he had loved so much and on whose drafting process he had spent so much effort for a decade, following the advice of his friend the Duke of Orleans, he went to Paris where he was received by King Louis XVIII of France who, even if congratulating him profusely for his achievements, did not undertake any formal obligation to put pressure on the Borbonic administration for the assurance of safeguards to the advantage of the Sicilian people or the keeping of the Constitution.

The film features Shannen Doherty, Matreya Scarrwener, Callan Potter, Chanelle Peloso, Louriza Tronco, Trezzo Mahoro, Ricky He, Sarah Grey, Avery Konrad, Ona Grauer, and Mira Sorvino. The plot differs from the original film, but both are based on the true story of Jamie Fuller, a 16-year-old high school student who murdered his 14-year-old girlfriend, Amy Carnevale, on August 23, 1991, in Beverly, Massachusetts. Plot Sarah Collins (Matreya Scarrwener) and her best friend Nikki Farrow (Chanelle Peloso) attend a wrestling match at their high school. There, Sarah unexpectedly catches the attention of a wrestler and fellow student, Rob Tennison (Callan Potter). Rob is a charismatic, newer student at school, and a star wrestler. Sarah is pleasantly surprised to find out that Rob shows romantic interest in her as well, and they start dating. Before long, Rob starts becoming jealous and controlling of Sarah. At one point during a get- together at Rob's family lake house, Sarah's friends pressure her into reading a poem that Rob had texted her, which angers Rob. Rob takes Sarah's cell phone outside, and when she follows him, he throws it at her in anger, breaking it. Rob apologizes, reminds Sarah of how much he loves her, offers to buy her a new cell phone, and they make up. Nikki comes outside and from a distance, sees a girl living next door. They wave at each other, but the other girl appears to get scared after seeing Rob behind Nikki. This leaves Nikki confused. Rob buys Sarah a new cell phone as promised, setting up a photo of him as the lock-screen. After school, Rob calls Sarah as she is studying for a test in her bedroom. For that reason, she tells him she can't talk at the moment. However, after they hang up, Nikki calls Sarah, needing a place to get away from her alcoholic mother. Rob finds out and gets angry at Sarah, accusing her of lying to him and that Nikki was more important than he was. Nikki overhears the fight and calls Rob's friend, Gus (Ricky He), to ask about the girl she saw next door to Rob's lake house. Gus tells her that the two had dated the previous summer, then asks Nikki why she wants to know. Nikki asks Gus to trust her for a while, and tells him that she'll talk to him about it later. Sarah talks with her mother, Laura (Shannen Doherty), about her relationship with Rob. Laura, who has her own history of rocky relationships, thinks Rob is jealous but speculates that maybe he just doesn't want to lose Sarah. Later that night, Rob arrives at the Collins' house with an expensive dress he bought for Sarah for the upcoming school dance. When Laura tells him of her talk with Sarah, Rob insists that there is nothing Sarah could do that would change how he feels about her. In Sarah's room, Rob convinces her to try the dress on and then, when the zipper won't zip, he suggests to her that she can \\"lose the weight\\" before the dance. At school in the girl's bathroom with Alexa (Louriza Tronco), Sarah is trying on an off-the-shoulder sweater and tight miniskirt. Sarah is pleased and surprised that it fits, and likes how pretty she looks. Alexa notices bruising on Sarah's shoulder, but then instead of asking her about it, only helps Sarah cover it with makeup and hide it with her hair. Sarah takes a selfie in the outfit and posts it online. This angers Rob, who loudly and publicly shames her in the school hallway, telling her she looks like a \\"cheap slut\\". Later, thinking Rob's parents are away, Sarah goes to his house to apologize. She is surprised to be greeted by Rob's mother (Ona Grauer), whom she's never met. Rob turns the situation around on Sarah, claiming she intentionally planned her visit as a way of meeting his mother. Rob angrily declares it \\"wasn't the right time,\\" and when Sarah leaves, Rob follows her outside. The situation escalates as Rob accuses her of always nagging him, after which he punches her so hard she falls to the ground, injured. Stunned and upset, Sarah breaks up with him and runs away, telling him not to contact her. When she arrives home, Sarah finds Laura silent on their couch. Sarah hides her injuries as Laura informs her that her own boyfriend just broke up with her. Just as it looks like Sarah might open up to her mother, Laura takes a phone call from work and Sarah storms off to her room. When Laura enters Sarah's room, she notices Sarah's injuries. Sarah lies, saying she fell and \\"Rob wasn't even there\\", then verbally takes her frustration out on her mother. Later that day, Rob promises to stop abusing her, and Sarah and Rob get back together. Rob gives Sarah a ring, making her promise that they will be together forever. When Sarah tells Nikki that she and Rob broke up and got back together, Nikki says that he's not going to change. Sarah accuses Nikki of betrayal, and walks off to be with Rob. Upset and confused, Nikki seeks out the ex-girlfriend she'd seen earlier at Rob's lake house, hoping to get information and advice. When they meet, the girl describes to Nikki the abuse she suffered at Rob's hands. The girl tells Nikki she stopped talking to Rob altogether, but never reported it because she didn't want to be \\"that girl\\" and that \\"it's not a good look\\" to stay with a guy who was abusing her. Nikki asks her how she can help Sarah, and the girl advises her just to be there for Sarah, no matter who she dates. At the school dance, Nikki sees Sarah for the first time since their fight and apologizes to her. Sarah gladly accepts and says she's sorry, too. On the dance floor, when Rob notices Sarah speaking and laughing with a male friend, Rob punches the boy and then drags Sarah outside. Nikki and Gus follow them to the parking lot and intervene, so that Rob can't hurt Sarah again. With Nikki's support, Sarah finally decides she has had enough of Rob's abuse, and breaks up with him. In the days that follow, Sarah ignores Rob's attempts to contact her. Rob finally tricks Sarah into talking to him by having Jacqueline (Sarah Grey) convince her to do so. Sarah reluctantly agrees to let Rob give her a ride home, and only to tell him it's really over and that she is done. Sarah gets into Rob's car to discover a drunken, passed-out Zack (Trezzo Mahoro) in the back seat. Rather than taking her home, Rob tells Sarah he's taking her for a drive. The next day, Sarah's friends and family are alarmed to discover Sarah is missing. Zack tells Nikki he doesn't know what happened to Sarah, because he was passed out in Rob's back seat. Zack says when he asked Rob about it, Rob claimed that they dropped her off at home, but Zack noticed that Sarah's purse was still in Rob's car. Nikki immediately calls Laura to let her know, and Laura tells her Rob is there with her. Nikki then tells Laura about Rob's abuse towards Sarah. Shaking, Laura hangs up with Nikki and questions Rob, revealing that she knows about the abuse. When he denies it, she angrily tells him to leave her house. Laura and Nikki go together to Rob's lake house, where they find Sarah's phone. A police search team is sent into the lake, where they find Sarah's body. As Rob is arrested by the police and charged with first degree of murder, his mother calls her husband about needing a lawyer for their son. At the trial (used as the framing wraparound for the film), Judge Elizabeth Hanover (Mira Sorvino) presides over the different testimonies. On the stand, Laura firmly tells Nikki that what happened to Sarah was not her fault, and tells the court that they should be looking at Rob's actions. A flashback to the night of the murder reveals that Rob accidentally asphyxiated Sarah. Judge Hanover reads the guilty verdict and then tells the witnesses to tell someone next time they see a friend being abused instead of standing by and doing nothing, implying how it could have saved Sarah from getting killed by quoting \\"Between the years 2001 and 2012, we lost 6,488 souls in battles fought in Iraq and Afghanistan. But during that same time period, 11,766 women were killed, but by their own partners. This is a war that we, in this country, refuse to address. It has to stop because things have gotten so dire that this is what a victory looks like and I am sorry folks but today was no victory. This case should not be closed because when it comes to domestic violence, there needs to be change on a cultural level and that change needs to start with each and every one of you.\\" At school, a memorial for Sarah is created in the hallway, where friends leave photos, flowers and mementos. Back at home in Sarah's room, Nikki and Laura mourn Sarah's death and console one another. A postscript gives advice to people on what to do if they see domestic violence on anyone.

It was one of the first VLSI processors and was the first device in the USA based on I¬≤L technology (integrated injection logic). It was used for research and teaching purposes in the aerospace industry (NASA) and in the learning computer LCM-1001 (Texas Instruments, 1976).

It is powered by a 7 V power supply unit. It is operated via a total of 20 toggle switches, which are divided into nine micro-operation switches, four data input switches, six control switches and the main switch. The switch position \\"down\\" or \\"left\\" corresponds to digital \\"0\\" or LOW; the position \\"up\\" or \\"right\\" corresponds to \\"1\\" or HIGH. The switch position at \\"1\\" is additionally indicated by a red LED lighting up. Nine further LEDs are used as output, four each for data and address, and one for ALUCOUT (ALU carry-out). The commands are entered bit by bit, whereby the 9-bit microinstruction word is divided into four ALU command bits, two target operand and three source operand bits. The least significant bit position (LSB) within each of the three groups is on the right. After each data input or expected output, the \\"CLOCK\\" push-button must be pressed to write the command to the command register and increase the command counter. Depending on the command used, the input is then made via the four data switches. The control switches are: ALUCIN (ripple-carry in), PCPRI (program counter priority, required to turn on the output LEDs on the address bus, PCCIN (program counter carry-in), ENCBY2 (enable program counter increment by a displacement of 1 or 2), POS1, POS0 (most significant, intermediate, or least significant position of the processor slice in a cascade). A DIL-40 socket serves as an optional extension by three further modules of the LCM-1000 series or own modules. The pin assignment is identical to that of the SBP0400 (power supply at the second INJECTOR pin - pin 40). * LCM-1001 base device ($ 149,95) * LCM-1002 controller module for micro programming with 256√ó20 bit PROM ($ 189,95) * LCM-1003 memory module containing 1024 12-bit words ($ 189,95) * LCM-1004 input/output module ($ 109,95)  Prototype, successors, and clones  The prototype was given the designation X0400.ntrs.nasa.gov (PDF).

History  The Eighteenth Century Militia of England and Wales did not sell commissions in the way that the British Army did at the time, but instead restricted them property owners and those with income of a set minimum value. In jurisdictions where the political and economic spheres are dominated by one ethnic, religious or racial group, property qualifications have been used as a way to exclude members of other ethnic, religious or racial groups that may disproportionately lack the required resources. This was the case in Northern Ireland, where a property requirement was used to exclude indigenous Irish Catholics from voting in elections for seats in the Stormont Parliament until 1969.A History of the Ulster Unionist Party: Protest, Pragmatism and Pessimism, by Graham Walker.

Prior to the 1921 Partition of Ireland, the Protestant Ascendancy had similarly barred most of the native Irish Catholics from voting for Irish seats in the Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland once the last bar to Catholics voting in the United Kingdom had been lifted by the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829. The property qualification remained in place for United Kingdom elections until the passage of the Representation of the People Act 1918.

Suppose A, C are respectively p√óp, q√óq positive-semidefinite complex matrices and B is a p√óq complex matrix. Let :M := \\\\left[\\\\begin{matrix} A & B \\\\\\\\\\\\ B^* & C \\\\end{matrix}\\\\right] so that M is a (p+q)√ó(p+q) matrix. Then Fischer's inequality states that : \\\\det (M) \\\\le \\\\det(A) \\\\det(C). If M is positive- definite, equality is achieved in Fischer's inequality if and only if all the entries of B are 0. Inductively one may conclude that a similar inequality holds for a block decomposition of M with multiple principal diagonal blocks. Considering 1√ó1 blocks, a corollary is Hadamard's inequality. Proof Assume that A and C are positive-definite. We have A^{-1} and C^{-1} are positive- definite. Let :D := \\\\left[\\\\begin{matrix} A & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & C \\\\end{matrix}\\\\right]. We note that :D^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}} M D^{-\\\\frac{1}{2} } = \\\\left[\\\\begin{matrix} A^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}} & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & C^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}} \\\\end{matrix}\\\\right] \\\\left[\\\\begin{matrix} A & B \\\\\\\\\\\\ B^* & C \\\\end{matrix}\\\\right] \\\\left[\\\\begin{matrix} A^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}} & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & C^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}} \\\\end{matrix}\\\\right] = \\\\left[\\\\begin{matrix} I_{p} & A^{\\\\frac{1}{2}} BC^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}} \\\\\\\\\\\\ C^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}}B^*A^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}} & I_{q}\\\\end{matrix}\\\\right] Applying the AM-GM inequality to the eigenvalues of D^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}} M D^{-\\\\frac{1}{2} }, we see :\\\\det (D^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}} M D^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}}) \\\\le \\\\left({1 \\\\over p + q} \\\\mathrm{tr} (D^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}} M D^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}}) \\\\right)^{p+q} = 1^{p+q} = 1. By multiplicativity of determinant, we have : \\\\begin{align} \\\\det(D^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}} ) \\\\det(M) \\\\det(D^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}} ) \\\\le 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\Longrightarrow \\\\det(M) \\\\le \\\\det(D) = \\\\det(A) \\\\det(C). \\\\end{align} In this case, equality holds if and only if M = D that is, all entries of B are 0. For \\\\varepsilon > 0, as A + \\\\varepsilon I_p and C + \\\\varepsilon I_q are positive-definite, we have :\\\\det(M+ \\\\varepsilon I_{p+q}) \\\\le \\\\det(A + \\\\varepsilon I_p) \\\\det(C + \\\\varepsilon I_q). Taking the limit as \\\\varepsilon \\\\rightarrow 0 proves the inequality. From the inequality we note that if M is invertible, then both A and C are invertible and we get the desired equality condition.  Improvements  If M can be partitioned in square blocks Mij, then the following inequality by Thompson is valid: : \\\\det(M) \\\\le \\\\det([\\\\det(M_{ij})]) where [det(Mij)] is the matrix whose (i,j) entry is det(Mij). In particular, if the block matrices B and C are also square matrices, then the following inequality by Everett is valid: : \\\\det(M) \\\\le \\\\det \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\det(A) && \\\\det(B) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\det(B^*) && \\\\det(D) \\\\end{bmatrix} Thompson's inequality can also be generalized by an inequality in terms of the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of the block matrices. Expressing the characteristic polynomial of the matrix A as : p_A (t) = \\\\sum_{k=0}^n t^{n-k} (-1)^k \\\\operatorname{tr}(\\\\Lambda^k A) and supposing that the blocks Mij are m x m matrices, the following inequality by Lin and Zhang is valid: : \\\\det(M) \\\\le \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\det([\\\\operatorname{tr}(\\\\Lambda^r M_{ij}]))}{ \\\\binom{m}r} \\\\right)^{\\\\frac{m}{r}},\\\\quad r=1, \\\\ldots, m Note that if r = m, then this inequality is identical to Thompson's inequality.

He won two classic races and was one of the leading greyhounds of the decade. Early life He was bred by John Murphy in Coachford and whelped during March 1950. Racing career Magourna Reject was trained by Noreen Collin at Walthamstow Stadium and owned by Mrs Frances Chandler, the wife of William Chandler. Collin's kennels were at High Warren, Theydon Manor, in Epping. After winning the 1951 Trafalgar Cup, a major competition for puppies, Magourna Reject went into the 1952 English Greyhound Derby as the ante post favourite. However he disappointed and was eliminated during the first round and his great rival Endless Gossip went on to win the competition.  Magourna Reject then reached the Welsh Greyhound Derby final but once again lost to Endless Gossip. He then stepped up in distance to the longer trip of 700 yards and became a crowd favourite with his running style and exceptional pace. However he ended the year without winning a classic race after failing to win both the St Leger and Cesarewitch when priced odds-on during both finals. In the early part of 1953, he came under the training of Tom \\"Paddy\\" Reilly because Collin had relinquished her post at the Walthamstow kennels and was replaced by Reilly. Despite a second failed attempt at the English greyhound Derby, Magourna Reject won the Key at Wimbledon, the Stewards' Cup at Gloucester (setting a track record) and the Wood Lane Stakes at White City during 1953, but it was the two classic wins which sealed his place in an elite group of greyhounds. In the St Leger at Wembley on 14 September, 30,000 people watched the final, a race that was also seen by several million on television (the first televised classic race). His supporters were rewarded as he easily won by five lengths. He then defeated his rivals in the Cesarewitch final on 16 October, winning by three and a half lengths from the Oaks champion, Lizette, his time of 33.24 seconds being the fastest ever for the event at West Ham Stadium. He was voted Greyhound of the Year by a press panel on behalf of the British Greyhound Breeders and Owners Association. Retirement Magourna Reject was retired to stud, demanding 35 guineas for a mating. He died in 1962.

According to Greek mythology, Thalamae was founded by Pelops, who, after his sister Niobe married Amphion, brought colonists from Boeotia; and was called in the time of Strabo the Boeotian Thalamae. It stood 80 stadia north of Oetylus, and 20 stadia from Pephnus., 2 Pephnus was on the coast, on the eastern side of the Messenian Gulf, and Thalamae was situated inland, upon the river Mil√©a, the minor Pamisus of Strabo. Ptolemy also calls it one of the inland towns of Laconia. Theopompus called Thalamae a Messenian town, and we know that the Messenians said that their territory originally extended as far as the minor Pamisus. Indeed, when Hippocoon usurped the throne of Sparta, Tyndareus fled to his brother Aphareus of Messenia where he settled in Thalamae and while living there, children were born to him. Thalamae is mentioned by Polybius. It was subsequently one of the Eleuthero-Laconian towns. In the territory of Thalamae, on the road to Oetylus was a temple and oracle of Ino or Pasipha√´, in which the future was revealed to those that slept in the temple.

It is now the clubhouse of Woodsome Hall Golf Club and a Grade I listed building. Built in the Elizabethan era as a hall house, Woodsome evolved in stages in the possession of several generations of the local Kaye family. The main hall range is built in two storeys with gabled forward projecting wings and a two storey gabled porch. At the rear of each end are L-shaped extensions forming a courtyard with a fountain. History The Woodsome estate belonged in the 13th century to the de Nottons, after which it passed to the Tyas family, who lived there until 1370. It was then granted to Sir William Finchenden, who was responsible for the finch motifs which adorn the building, before coming into the possession of the Kaye family, who occupied the property from 1378 to 1726. Sir John Kaye was created a baronet in 1642 and the Hall passed down to Sir Arthur Kaye, 3rd Baronet who died with no male heir in 1726, the baronetcy thereby becoming extinct. His only daughter Elizabeth married George Legge, Viscount Lewisham, the heir of the 1st Earl of Dartmouth. Unfortunately Viscount Legge died soon afterwards in 1732, to be succeeded in turn by his eldest son, William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth. The Earls of Dartmouth's main seats were elsewhere and thus Woodsome became a country retreat and dower house. The last members of the Legge family to live at Woodsome were Frances, Georgiana and Elizabeth Legge, daughters of the 5th Earl of Dartmouth, who vacated it in 1910. In 1911 the estate was let to Woodsome Hall Golf Club, who then purchased the property and have occupied it ever since.

Life and military service Born at Southsea, Hampshire in November 1896 to Edith Marianne Fulljames and her husband Gilbert Fulljames, he was educated at Sutton Valence School, before attending Downing College, Cambridge. He served during World War I and leant to fly in 1916, before serving with the Royal Flying Corps in France in 1917 with the rank of second lieutenant. He was shot down three times during the course of the war, including once by the infamous German flying ace Baron von Richthofen. The Royal Flying Corps was merged into the Royal Air Force in April 1918, with Fulljames also transferring to the new service. For his services as a pilot during the war he was awarded the Military Cross. He became a flying instructor in 1918, and following the war he was granted the rank of flight lieutenant in 1919. With the war having interrupted his studies, he completed his engineering course at Downing College in 1922. He served as member of the technical staff at RAF headquarters in British India from 1923 to 1926, including as chief technical officer at RAF Drigh Road in Karachi. He made his debut in first-class cricket for the Royal Air Force cricket team against the Royal Navy at The Oval in 1927. He was promoted from flight lieutenant to squadron leader in December 1928, while serving at The School of Technical Training at RAF Halton. His first-class appearances for the RAF continued in 1928, with Fulljames playing first-class cricket for the RAF until 1932, making eight appearances. A successful bowler for the RAF, he would take a total of 38 wickets at a good bowling average of 20.92. He twice took five wickets in an innings and once took ten wickets in a match, with best innings bowling figures of 7/25. His haul of 38 wickets would eventually make him the RAF's leading wicket-taker in first-class cricket. By July 1935, Fulljames had been promoted from squadron leader to Wing Commander. He served during World War II, during which he achieved the rank of Wing Commander in March 1940. By 1945, he held the rank of temporary group captain. He retired from active service in May 1945, retaining the now permanent rank of group captain. Shortly after retiring from the RAF, he stood as the Liberal Party candidate for Southampton in the 1945 General Election. He died at Curdridge, Hampshire, on 31 July 1985. He was survived by his wife, Annie Muriel Fulljames, with whom he had two children.

Previously, the protected regions of the park supported important populations of migratory waterfowl and over 100 species of nesting birds. The current status of wildlife (as of 2018) depends on the varying levels of military activity in the park. Administratively, the park encompasses several subsidiary nature reserves and state lands, which retain their legal status. The park is named for the Maeotians, an ancient people who lived on the Azov shores; ancient names for the Sea of Azov itself included Lake Maeotis and the Maeotian Sea. The park crosses several administrative districts, including Nikolske Raion, Novoazovsk Raion, and Manhush Raion in Donetsk Oblast Topography Meotyda was assembled in 2009 to cover a number of smaller nature reserves, state lands, and cultural monuments along the northern coast of the Sea of Azov, in the southwest corner of Donetsk Oblast. The park is close to the Mariupol, and is about 80 miles south of the regional city of Donetsk and 40 miles west of the border with Russia. The area's habitats themselves show great diversity: steppe, coastal plain, floodplain swamps, estuaries with variable salinity, spits, peninsulas, sandy-shell islands, dunes and saline lakes.

It is held every year on 9 August, the eve of St Lawrence's Day, and consists mainly in planting a beech at the intersection of / and /. It is accompanied by processions and various folk activities during the day. Since 1974, the city of Leuven also claims to be planting the \\"real\\" Meyboom. History According to tradition, the celebration commemorates a victory of Brussels over the nearby city of Leuven in 1213. The Companions of St Lawrence, a city guild, came to the aid of Brussels' inhabitants and vigorously repelled the aggressor. Grateful, the Duke of Brabant at the time (Henri I of Brabant), granted the status of corporation to the guild and gave it the right to plant henceforth a tree of joy or Meyboom. In honour of the new corporation, the date of the plantation was fixed to 9 August, the eve of St Lawrence's Day. To respect the tradition, the tree of joy must thus imperatively be planted before 5 p.m. on 9 August. In 1974, a group of men from Leuven called The Men Of 1929 managed to find out which tree Brussels had earmarked as their Meyboom. During the night of 8 August, the men cut down the tree and transported it to Leuven, where they planted it in front of the city hall. Brussels, however, chose to ignore what had happened and cut down another tree. Ever since, the two cities have been involved in a friendly rivalry to decide who has the \\"real\\" Meyboom. Since 2008, the Meyboom has been recognised as an expression of intangible cultural heritage by UNESCO, as part of the binational listing of 'Processional giants and dragons in Belgium and France'. Celebrations The tree is designated by the city's Plantation Department and \\"chosen\\" by the Companions of St Lawrence in the Sonian Forest, in the outskirts of Brussels. According to tradition, it must weigh at least , measure in height and be leafy. It is cut and then transported by B√ª√ªmdroegers (\\"tree bearers\\"), through the municipalities of Schaerbeek, Saint-Josse-ten- Noode and the City of Brussels. At 1 p.m., a tribute is paid to the deceased Companions. The procession then forms at the corner of / and / (near the local brotherhood of the Companions, at 37, /), and sets off along a fixed route: /, /, /, /, /, /, /, / and the Grand Place. At 2.45 p.m., the procession returns from the Grand Place via /, /, /, /, /, and finally returns to the corner of / and / around 4.30 p.m. Along the way, small branches of the tree are distributed, supposed to bring good fortune for the year to come. The culmination is the plantation itself, which must take place before 5 p.m. The tree is in fact not really planted but stuck in the ground and removed the next day.

It saw action during World War I in both Belgian and German hands.  Design  = Fortress Gun = In 1887 the Belgian War Ministry ordered 185 5.7 cm fortress guns to arm their fortresses including Namur and Liege. The 5.7 cm Maxim-Nordenfelt was a short 26 caliber gun and not the longer 42-50 caliber QF 6-pounder Nordenfelt naval gun. It was a typical built-up gun of the period made of steel with a vertical sliding-block breech and it fired fixed QF ammunition of a number of different styles. The guns were mounted in Grusonwerke gun turrets or in armored casemates on central pivot mounts and used in an anti-personnel role. = Infantry Gun = In addition to its fortress gun role, it was deployed in an infantry gun role. The guns were mounted on light two-wheeled box trail carriages without a recoil mechanism and protected by a three-sided gun shield. During 1914 the Germans captured large numbers of these guns and used them in the infantry gun role mainly to engage enemy machine gun nests in support of infantry assaults. In 1916 the Germans had 450 of these infantry guns in service. = Tank Gun & Anti-tank Gun = In addition to the infantry gun role, the Germans used a number of guns to arm their A7V tanks and the guns were mounted in an armored casemate at the front of the vehicle with limited traverse. The Germans also mounted a number guns on central-pivot mounts on flatbed truck chassis to act as mobile anti-tank guns.

Its use as a burial ground began in 1849, the same year that the fort was established by the United States Army. Pioneers Rest is located in the 600 block of Samuels Avenue near its intersection with Cold Springs Road, immediately north of downtown Fort Worth. Many early settlers are buried at Pioneers Rest, which was referred to as the \\"old cemetery,\\" \\"city cemetery,\\" or \\"Samuels Avenue cemetery\\" until 1909. Veterans of every American war from the War of 1812 to World War II are buried at Pioneers Rest.  History  Local physician Adolphe Gouhenant donated three acres of land on a bluff overlooking the Trinity River for a public cemetery, where the first burials were the eleven soldiers who died (most likely from cholera) in the months after the establishment of the fort. Sophie and Willie Arnold, the two young children of Major Ripley Allen Arnold, the officer responsible for establishment of the fort, both perished in 1850 and were buried at the cemetery. Major Arnold, considered to be the founder of the city of Fort Worth, was killed in a duel at Fort Graham in present-day Hill County, Texas in 1853. Originally buried at Fort Graham, the following year his body was moved and reinterred at what was then Fort Worth's only public cemetery. A cemetery association was organized in 1870 to care for the site; its trustees included city leaders K. M. Van Zandt, M. B. Loyd, W. A. Darter, and W. P. Burts. By this time, the cemetery was nearly full and local leader John Peter Smith donated land to create Oakwood Cemetery, across the Trinity River from downtown Fort Worth. In 1871 an additional three acres was donated by Baldwin Samuels, after which Samuels Avenue is named, to expand the \\"old cemetery.\\" In 1909, the cemetery was formally named \\"Pioneers Rest\\" and the organization known as the Samuels Avenue Cemetery Association reformed as the Pioneers Rest Cemetery Association. Plans were made for a monument to honor Ripley Allen Arnold, and in 1911 a subscription fund for the monument was established under the condition that Arnold's body would be moved within the cemetery to a new Arnold Park. In 1917 it was discovered that the Pioneers Rest property, long considered a \\"no-man's land,\\" was actually owned by the City of Fort Worth, which had purchased it in 1880 for $76. After proposing to convert the property into a city park, the park board ultimately elected to return the property to the Pioneers Rest Cemetery Association and provide free water for maintenance of the cemetery. In 1928, the remains of Tarrant County namesake, Republic of Texas militia member and State Representative Edward H. Tarrant were moved to Pioneers Rest, having been interred for nearly seventy years at his family cemetery in Ellis County, and for one year at Fondren Cemetery in Parker County. A new monument honoring Tarrant was placed in 1931. During the Great Depression, Pioneers Rest became a popular campsite for hobos because it was near the railroad, offered dense shrubs as cover, and the Tarrant County Courthouse lawn in downtown Fort Worth had already become overcrowded. Inscriptions from all grave markers were recorded for Fort Worth's centennial in 1948, and updated in 1976. A Texas Historical Marker honoring Edward H. Tarrant was dedicated in 1987. All grave plots in Pioneers Rest had been sold by the 1920s, but the last burial did not take place until 1993. A marker for the first eleven soldiers buried at Pioneers Rest was placed in 1999 and a monument for Confederate Civil War veterans was dedicated in 2000. Pioneers Rest continues to be maintained by the Pioneers Rest Cemetery Association and is open to the public on weekdays.  Notable graves and monuments  Numerous original Peters Colony settlers, local civic figures, and Civil War veterans are buried at Pioneers Rest. Notable graves include: * Ripley Allen Arnold (1817-1853) - Founder of Fort Worth and major in the United States Army * James J.

Purpose Like all British county militia units (formed in the 18th and 19th Centuries) the purpose of the unit was to act as a territorially based force of able bodied men to serve in Sussex and in time of war would report for duty such as defending against invasion by the French. They were not supposed to serve overseas, although the county militias acted as feeder units for officers and recruits to the regular army in times of needAnn Hudson, Volunteer soldiers in Sussex during the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, 1793-1815, Sussex Archaeological Collections 122, pp. 165-81. Insignia In common with many British infantry regiments who styled themselves as light infantry the Royal Sussex Light Infantry Militia included the coiled huntsman's bugle in their unit insignia. In the case of the soldier's Victorian Bell-Top Shako badge it took the form of a standard Victorian crowned eight pointed star, with a central detail of a silver enamel Garter Star, in common with the regular regiment's cap badge, but surrounded by a light infantry bugle all atop a ribbon title with the words \\"Royal Sussex\\" inscribed . This combination of details and themes was continued on officer's cap badges. Unit history The Royal Sussex Regiment Boer War Memorial in Regency Square, Brighton. The Royal Sussex Light Infantry Militia was formed in March 1778 and had strong association with the Dukes of Richmond. The unit is recorded as having a recruiting and garrison association with Chichester and its Royal and Regimental colours were laid up in Chichester Cathedral on the unit's dissolution in 1881, as part of the Childers Reforms. The unit had a full complement of officers in 1880https://digital.nls.uk/british-military- lists/archive/104566646. In 1881 the unit was absorbed by The Royal Sussex Regiment, becoming the regiment's 3rd Battalion. As such the unit's personnel would have served in South Africa in 1901-1902 during the Second Boer War and 16 members of the battalion would die in South Africahttps://www.iwm.org.uk/memorials/item/memorial/16859Hart‚Ä≤s Army list, 1903. Members of the 3rd Battalion who died in the Second Boer War are commemorated on a war memorial (along with others of the Royal Sussex Regiment) in Brighton. In 1908 further reorganisation of the British Army took place (the Haldane Reforms) and all militia infantry units were designated as training depots for county infantry regiments and the 3rd Battalion, The Royal Sussex Regiment, became a Special Reserve battalion. During the First World War the Battalion (then stationed at Newhaven) trained recruits for service with the active service battalions of the Royal Sussex Regiment. At the end of the war the 3rd Battalion (in 1919) was effectively wound down becoming a Supplementary Reserve unit and its personnel absorbed into the regular 1st Battalion the Royal Sussex Regiment.

John asks Morgan, \\"So, what's your story?\\" Shortly after the war with the Saviors, Morgan Jones decides to isolate himself from everyone else, but after many attempts from Paul \\"Jesus\\" Rovia, Carol Peletier and Rick Grimes, Morgan leaves his community in Virginia, despite being urged to stay. As Morgan prepares to go further, he briefly considers staying but ultimately decides to run away, making his way to the Texas border, where he sees an injured man shivering in a car. Morgan leaves water and a towel, but the injured man refuses, telling Morgan that in this world they're always on their own. Morgan takes back the items and keeps walking. Later that night, Morgan meets John Dorie, who offers him shelter for the night. With some reluctance, Morgan agrees to sleep the night in John's truck, but later that night he leaves and is captured by a man named Leland and a small group of survivors. John comes to save Morgan but is captured himself; they are saved by a woman named Althea, who drives a SWAT vehicle. Althea tells Morgan and John that she is a journalist and wants to get their stories on camera. The following morning, John tells Althea that he is on a mission to find his girlfriend, Laura. When Althea asks for Morgan's story, he refuses and decides to leave and return to going on his own. John catches up to him to give him new pairs of socks, but Morgan and John realize they're being ambushed. They are then held at gunpoint by Leland and his men (along with Althea). Morgan uses his spear to attack, giving John time to shoot back. A quick gunfight ensues, and Morgan is shot in the leg by one of Leland's men. After a brief fight, they fall and the man starts getting devoured by walkers until Morgan grabs a grenade from a walker and throws it at the walkers. He runs to the bathroom for cover as the explosion kills the walkers and the man. Outside, John is dealing with the walkers, while Althea and Leland are fighting over the keys to the SWAT vehicle. Althea throws a set of keys and Leland, believing they're the keys to the SWAT vehicle, goes after them and is bitten by a rattlesnake. He is eventually surrounded and set upon by the walker herd. Althea uses machine guns in the SWAT vehicle to shoot the walkers as Morgan and John duck for cover. After the gunfire has ended, Althea, John and Morgan continue on the road until Morgan asks to pull over. Morgan then tells his story from Atlanta, Virginia and the communities, the king and a tiger, the war with the Saviors, until he left the settlement. Morgan decides to stop, but Althea continues asking what he's trying to get away from. Morgan decides to leave despite John's protest due to Morgan's injured leg. Althea asks Morgan to tell her one real thing. He replies, \\"I lose people and then I lose myself,\\" and walks away. Again on his own, Morgan continues walking until he sees the car from earlier in the episode that the injured man was in. He sees a walker in the distance and follows it, but two walkers notice him. Morgan tries limping away but falls and drops his stick. John comes to save him and tells Morgan that he's wrong about being on his own. Morgan continues toward the walker ahead, whom he realizes is the injured man. Out of mercy, Morgan buries him and agrees to tag along with Althea and John until his leg heals. Along the way, the group stops their vehicle when they see a woman crawling on the ground, who turns out to be Alicia Clark. Morgan, John and Althea are then surrounded at gunpoint by Nick Clark, Victor Strand and Luciana Galvez. Althea asks Alicia, \\"So what the hell is your story?\\", as the episode ends. Production On April 14, 2017, AMC renewed the series for a 16-episode fourth season and announced that Andrew Chambliss and Ian Goldberg would replace the departing Dave Erickson as showrunners. Production began in November 2017 in Austin, Texas. Michael E. Satrazemis, a director of photography for The Walking Dead and director of 12 episodes, joined Fear the Walking Dead as a directing-producer. In November 2017, it was reported that Lennie James who portrays Morgan Jones on The Walking Dead would crossover and join the main cast in the fourth season. The fourth season also sees the additions of several new series regulars, played by Garret Dillahunt, Jenna Elfman, and Maggie Grace. The fourth season features a redesigned title sequence with new theme music. Each episode of the season has a different title card, and tells a story which will become apparent once the season is completed. The Hollywood Reporter reflected on the new intro, calling the new season, \\"a Western with zombies, very much by design.\\"  Reception  \\"What's Your Story?\\" received critical acclaim from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, \\"What's Your Story?\\" garnered a perfect 100% rating, with an average score of 8.88/10 based on 15 reviews. The sites critical consensus reads; \\"What's Your Story?\\" breathes new life into Fear, taking its time to introduce new storylines and characters that will push the show into the wild, wild west. Matt Fowler of IGN gave \\"What's Your Story?\\" an 8.3/10 rating, stating; \\"Fear the Walking Dead was smart to have Morgan join up with a few new characters before he collided with Madison's crew. It allowed us to meet some new faces (including Garret Dillahunt's instantly-great John) and get to know them within the context of Morgan's terse moodiness before the hammer dropped at the end and the ultimate connection to the former cast, and story, was revealed.\\" = Ratings = The episode was seen by 4.09 million viewers in the United States on its original air date, far above the previous episodes ratings of 2.23 million viewers.

Bullard (October 14, 1858 - September 8, 1928) was a Vermont attorney and public official. He was notable for his service as United States Attorney for the District of Vermont from 1916 to 1923. Bullard was a native of Hyde Park, Vermont, and taught school while completing his education at Vermont Normal School and the University of Michigan Law School. He practiced law beginning in 1884, first in Underhill and later in Burlington. A Democrat, Bullard served terms in the Vermont House of Representatives, and ran unsuccessfully for offices including Vermont Attorney General. From 1915 to 1923, Bullard served as Vermont's U.S. Attorney. Bullard died in Burlington and was buried at Riverbank Cemetery, Stowe, Vermont. Early life Vernon Alvord Bullard was born in Hyde Park, Vermont on October 14, 1858, the eldest son of Edwin and Olive (Harrington) Bullard. He was educated in Hyde Park, and began to teach school in 1878. While teaching, Bullard attended the Vermont Normal School, from which he graduated in 1880. Bullard continued to teach while taking courses at the University of Michigan Law School, from which he received his LL.B. in 1884. He was admitted to the bar later that year and commenced practice in Underhill. Early career After practicing in Underhill for ten years, Bullard relocated to Burlington, where he continued to practice. Bullard successfully handled several prominent criminal trials and earned a reputation as a skilled lawyer in civil cases, winning several judgments for medical malpractice. Bullard was active in politics as a Democrat during an era when Republicans won all statewide elections in Vermont and most local and county elections as well. Despite his party affiliation, he was well-enough regarded that he was elected to represent Underhill in the Vermont House of Representatives from 1890 to 1891, and served for many years as moderator of the Underhill town meeting and a Justice of the Peace. From 1892 to 1896, Bullard was a special inspector of customs for the United States Department of the Treasury. Continued career For several years, Bullard was chairman of the Chittenden County Democratic Committee, and he served as a delegate to numerous state party conventions. He was also an unsuccessful candidate for Member of Congress from Vermont's 1st District (1894) and Chittenden County State's Attorney. Bullard represented Burlington in the Vermont House from 1904 to 1905, and was credited with securing the appropriation that made possible the construction of Morrill Hall at the University of Vermont. He was a delegate to the 1904 Democratic National Convention, and in 1906 he was the unsuccessful Democratic nominee for Vermont Attorney General. Bullard served as Burlington's city attorney for several years, and from 1905 to 1913 he was a member of the city school board, including serving as chairman from 1909 to 1913. In 1908, he was the Democratic nominee for United States Senator against incumbent Republican William P. Dillingham, and the Vermont General Assembly chose Dillingham by a vote of 230 to 38. United States Attorney In 1915, Bullard was appointed United States Attorney for the District of Vermont, succeeding Alexander Dunnett. He served until 1923, and was succeeded by Harry B. Amey. During Bullard's tenure, crimes that fell under federal jurisdiction were on the rise as the result of societal changes including increased urbanization, as well an increase in illegal activities connected to criminalizing the sale of opiates and cocaine, World War I, and passage of Prohibition in the United States. As a result, Bullard's office handled as many as four times the cases of his predecessors, including draft evaders, drug dealers, and bootleggers. Death and burial Bullard died in Burlington on September 8, 1928. He was buried in Plot 5G-31 at Riverbank Cemetery in Stowe, Vermont. Family In 1885, Bullard married Fluella R. Stowe (1858-1894) of Morrisville. She died in 1894, and they were the parents of two children, son Haven Stowe and daughter Augusta Ruth, the wife of Earle Benjamin of Plymouth, New Hampshire. His second wife was Anniebel Stowe (1865-1925), a sister of his first wife. References Sources =Books= * =Newspapers=   * =Internet=  External links Vernon A.

Mimicry differs from camouflage as it is meant to be seen, while animals use camouflage to remain hidden. Visual, olfactory, auditory, biochemical, and behavioral modalities of mimicry have been documented in vertebrates. There are few well-studied examples of mimicry in vertebrates. Still, many of the basic types of mimicry apply to vertebrates, especially among snakes. Batesian mimicry is rare among vertebrates but found in some reptiles (particularly snakes) and amphibians. M√ºllerian mimicry is found in some snakes, birds, amphibians, and fish. Aggressive mimicry is known in some vertebrate predators and parasites, while certain forms of sexual mimicry are distinctly more complex than in invertebrates.  Classification  = Defensive =  Batesian  Batesian mimicry is a form of defense that allows a harmless species to mimic the appearance of a toxic, noxious, or harmful species to protect itself from predators. By mimicking the appearance of a harmful species, a predator is less likely to attack the species due to its awareness of the signal of warning color patterns. Batesian mimicry occurs in multiple vertebrates, but is less prevalent in mammals due to a relative rarity of well-marked harmful models. However, this form of mimicry is prevalent in snakes and frogs, where chemical defense has coevolved with distinct coloration. Still, mammals have evolved Batesian mimicry systems where particularly powerful or harmful models exist. A venomous coral snake and some of its multiple nonvenomous mimic species For example, Batesian mimicry may occur in cheetah cubs. They replicate the appearance of a sympatric species, the honey badger (Mellivora capensis). The honey badger has a white or silvery back with a black or brownish underbelly and grows to a body length of about three feet long and ten inches high. As cubs, cheetahs have the same reverse-countershading color pattern and are roughly the same size. Due to this conspicuous coloration, potential predators like lions and birds of prey are less likely to hunt cheetah cubs, as from a distance they appear to be honey badgers. Honey badgers make an effective model because their aggressive nature and glands on their tails that produce a noxious fluid enable them to deter predators up to 10x its size. Batesian mimicry also occurs in the scarlet kingsnake. This species resembles the venomous coral snake, sharing a pattern of red, black, and yellow bands. Although the order of the color rings differ between the two snakes, from a distance a predator can easily mistake the scarlet kingsnake for its venomous model.  M√ºllerian  M√ºllerian mimicry is another form of defensive mimicry, except the system involves two or more species that are all toxic, noxious, or harmful. These species develop similar appearances to collectively protect against predators. This adaptation is said to have evolved due to the additive protection of many species that look the same and reliably have harmful defenses. That is to say, this mimicry system evolves convergently. If a predator is aware of the potential threat of one species, the predator will also avoid any species with a similar appearance, creating the M√ºllerian mimicry affect. Again, the relative lack of noxious models limits most examples to systems that involve reptiles or amphibians. M√ºllerian mimicry is found in many pitvipers. All pit vipers are capable of delivering a life- threateningly venomous bite. In Asia, different species found throughout Asia have evolved separately to have a very similar appearance. Each species is found in different places in Asia, but have the same green coloration with reddish tail tip. These shared colorations are warnings signals for predators. Because a predator is aware of these warning signals, it will avoid all species with this color pattern. Species that benefit from this system include Trimeresurus macrops, T. purpureomaculatus, Trimeresurus septentrionalis, T. flavomaculatus and T. hageni. M√ºllerian mimicry is also found in a ring of poisonous frog species in Peru. The mimic poison frog (Dendrobates imitator) mimics 3 similarly poisonous frogs of the same genus that live in different areas. These are D. variabilis, D. fantasticus, and D. ventrimaculatus. D. imitator can replicate the different appearances of all 3 species with color patterns ranging from black spots with yellow back and bluish green limbs, larger black spots with yellow outline, and black linear spots with yellow and bluish green outline. Examples of the defensive posture and facial markings of the slow loris, which activates the individual's venom glands and may imitate a cobra hood. The slow loris is the only known venomous mammal, and appears to use M√ºllerian mimicry for protection. It is hypothesized that this venom may have allowed it to develop a system of M√ºllerian mimicry with the Indian cobra. Slow lorises appear to look similar to the cobras with \\"facial markings undeniably akin to the eyespots and accompanying stripes of the spectacled cobra\\". Dark contrasting dorsal stripes are also apparent in both species,, helping to confuse predators from above. When in aggressive encounters, slow lorises will make a grunting noise that mimics the hiss of a cobra. This example of M√ºllerian mimicry is likely unique to vertebrates due to its multiple modalities: biochemical, behavioral, visual, and auditory. Since the cobra is undoubtedly more dangerous to predators (and prey, as the loris eats predominantly fruits, gums, and insects), it is unclear if the benefit from this system is mutual; Still, both species are dangerous in their own right, and can therefore most accurately be classified as M√ºllerian. = Aggressive = Aggressive mimicry is a form of mimicry, opposite in principle to defensive mimicry, that occurs in certain predators, parasites or parasitoids. These organisms benefit by sharing some of the characteristics of a harmless species in order to deceive their prey or host. Most examples of aggressive mimicry involve the predator employing a signal to lure its prey towards it under the promise of food, sex, or other rewards‚Äîmuch like the idiom of a wolf in sheep's clothing.  In predators  Some predators pretend to be prey or a third-party organism that the prey beneficially interacts with. In either situation, the mimicry increases the predator's chances of catching its prey. One form of predatory mimicry, lingual luring, involves wriggling the tongue to attract prey, duping them into believing the tongue is a small worm, an unusual case of a vertebrate mimicking an invertebrate. In the puff adder Bitis arietans, lingual luring only occurs in the act of attracting amphibian prey, suggesting that puff adders distinguished between prey types when selecting how to perform a display of aggressive mimicry. Another form of aggressive mimicry is caudal luring, in which the tail is waved to mimic prey. By mimicking invertebrate larva, the predator attracts prey of small vertebrates such as frogs, lizards, and birds. Male puff adders have longer, more obvious-looking tails. Sidewinder rattlesnakes, puff adders, lanceheads, and multiple other ambush-predatory snakes use caudal luring to attract prey. Complicated forms of aggressive mimicry have also been observed in fish, creating a system that resembles Batesian mimicry. The false cleanerfish, Aspidontus taeniatus, is a fin-eating blenny that has evolved to resemble a local species of cleaner wrasse, Labroides dimidiatus, which engages in mutualistic cleaning with larger fish. By closely mimicking the coloration and the cleaner fish's distinctive dancing display, false cleanerfish are able to remain in close quarters with large predatory reef fish, and gain access to victims during foraging. Some aggressive mimics switch rapidly between aggressive mimicry and defensive behavior depending on whether they are in the presence of a prey or a potential predator. For example, the sidewinder rattlesnake ceases aggressive behavior upon the arrival of a predatory toad and begins species-typical defensive displays.  Host-parasite  Host- parasite mimicry is a form of aggressive mimicry in which a parasite mimics its own host. Brood parasitism is a common form of parasitic aggressive mimicry that occurs in vertebrates, with cuckoos being a notable example. Brood parasite mothers will surrender their offspring to be raised by another organism, of either the same or a different species, unbeknownst to the other organism. This allows the progeny to be nurtured without energy expenditure or parental care by the true parent. 200x200px Cuckoos are brood parasites that lay their eggs to match the color and pattern of their host's own eggs. Different species of cuckoo hatchlings have been known to mimic the acoustic sound, such as during begging, and appearance of the host offspring. Unlike most vertebrates that perform aggressive mimicry, certain brood parasitic birds display signals of two distinct modalities at the same time. For example, Horsfield's bronze cuckoo nestlings have been found to employ both acoustic and visual sensory modalities at the same time to increase efficiency and success of their mimicry. However, host-parasite systems are not always as precise. Great spotted cuckoos are brood parasites that lay eggs that can successfully dupe other birds such as the magpie, pied starling, and black crow, despite having different egg color, egg size, and offspring features. It is hypothesized that these differences in characteristic have evolved after the mimicry system due to genetic isolation, as the appearance of eggs laid by European an African great spotted cuckoos are different. Evidence also exists for other forms of parasitic mimicry in vertebrates. One such form is interspecific social dominance mimicry, a type of social parasitism where a subordinate species (usually determined by size) evolves over time to mimic its dominant ecological competitor, thereby competing with its previously socially dominant opponent. One such example is found in the tyrant flycatcher family, in which different birds of similar appearance exist from six different genera. Smaller-bodied species from four genera have been found to mimic the appearance of the larger species of the other two genera, suggesting that an avian mimicry complex has contributed to convergent evolution, providing a competitive advantage in the same ecological niche.automimic, the pattern on its flank resembling an eye. = Automimicry = Automimicry is a type of mimicry that occurs within a single species, in which an individual mimics either a different member of its own species or a different part of its own body. In some cases, it is considered a form of Batesian mimicry, and is exhibited by a wide variety of vertebrates. Many of the basic strategies automimics use in invertebrates is repeated in vertebrates, such as eyespots.  Sexual  In sexual mimicry, an organism mimics the behaviors or physical traits of the opposite sex within its species. Spotted hyenas are one of the few vertebrate examples. In spotted hyenas, females have a pseudo- penis, which is highly erectile clitoral tissue, as well as a false scrotum. Females have evolved to mimic or exceed the testosterone levels of males This is advantageous because it lends females heightened aggression and dominance over the males in a highly competitive environment. Alternatively, it may have evolved for the advantage it bestows upon sexually indistinguishable cubs, which experience a high level of female-targeted infanticide. Another example is in flat lizards, where some males imitate female coloring to sneak around more dominant males and achieve copulation with females.  Anatomical  The eyespots of a pygmy owl Some vertebrates species self-mimic their own body parts, through the use of patterns or actual anatomy. Two widespread examples of this are eyespots and false heads, both of which can misdirect, confuse, or intimidate potential predators. Eyespots are a form of automimicry in which an organism displays false eyes on a different part of its body, considered to be an aversion to predators who believe the prey animal has spotted them or is behaving aggressively, even when they are actually facing the other direction and unaware. In the case of attack, eyespots may also redirect damage away from the true head. Eyespots can be seen across the vertebrate taxa, from the four-eyed butterfly fish to pygmy owls. False-head mimicry occurs when an organism displays a different body part that has evolved to look like a head, achieving the same scare tactic as eyespots, and also protecting the vulnerable and important real head. For example, the rubber boa coil up and hide their heads, instead displaying their tails, which look morphologically like their heads, in a defensive behavior.  Evolution  Mimicry, in vertebrates or otherwise, is widely hypothesized to follow patterns of directional selection. However, it is argued that, while positive evolution might stabilize mimic forms, other evolutionary factors like random mutation create mimetic forms simply by coincidence. Vertebrate evolution systems often operate under unique selective pressures, resulting in the different quantitative and qualitative characteristics we observe between mimicry in vertebrates and other animals. The primary difference between mimicry in vertebrates and in insects is a decreased diversity and frequency. The 50,000 extant vertebrates are dwarfed by the over 1 million known invertebrates. This might create a negative feedback loop for vertebrates whereby fewer examples of mimicry arise due to a rarity of species to mimic, and may help to explain the relative scarcity of precise mimicry in vertebrates. Vertebrates seem to have multiple barriers to precise mimicry that invertebrates do not. Due to the drastic difference in average body size between the two phyla, vertebrates tend to mimic other living things, while invertebrates are much better able to mimic inanimate objects. Large size makes any imprecision much more noticeable to the naked eye, slowing or preventing the evolution of mimicry. However, when a potential prey is highly noxious, as in snakes, predators that avoid even poor mimics gain a strong selective advantage; whereas insects, rarely able to deliver enough toxin to threaten vertebrate predators, would need precise mimicry to avoid detection. The assumption of scarcity in vertebrate mimetic resemblances is largely limited due to human perception. Humans are hyper-perceptive to visual mimicry systems, and find these the most abundant. However, olfactory, biochemical, and even electroreceptive forms of mimicry are likely to be much more common than currently accounted for.

It lives on Common sea-lavender (Limonium vulgare) on the coasts of western Europe and northwest Africa. Description This beetle is to long. Its colour is a metallic purple or copper tone which sometimes includes shades of violet or blue. The body is sparsely covered with tiny white hair. The snout is straight and squat, and is almost identical in both sexes. The short antennae have compact club-like ends. The prothorax is oblong with a small cavity. The forewings on both sides are bulgy with their greatest width in the centre section. They are thinly striped with wide spaces inbetween. Life Pseudaplemonus limonii lives predominantly, if not exclusively, on Common sea- lavender, but it is suggested that it also accepts other species of Limonium and possibly also Frankenia in southern Spain or Portugal. To reproduce, the weevil will chew a slot into the plant's root crown wherein it lays its eggs. The hole is then sealed by the bug with a secretion. The larvae feed from the root crown and the lower part of the stalk. Adult specimens have been observed from June to mid-October. Distribution Like its host plant, this weevil lives on the sea shores of the western Mediterranean and Atlantic Ocean from Algeria and Morocco across Spain, France, Britain and Belgium to Germany.

During the breakdown in relations between the caliph al-Muhtadi and the Turkish leadership in June 870, Muhammad and his brother were targeted by attempts to incite the residents of Samarra against them. Following accusations that he and Musa were guilty of expropriating revenues, Muhammad was seized and placed into prison, and was shortly afterwards put to death.

It is native to shallow waters in the subtropical southwestern Atlantic Ocean. It was first described in 1834 by the French naturalist Alcide d'Orbigny. Description This is a small to medium-sized octopus with a maximum length of about . The mantle is globular with a smooth surface. The head is slightly narrower than the mantle, the eyes are prominent and are surrounded by small granulations. The mantle opening is wide with a long funnel. The neck is constricted and the eight arms are two-thirds to three-quarters of the length of the rest of the animal. The second pair of arms is the shortest and the fourth pair is the longest. The hectocotylus of the male is on the right third arm, and the male also has enlarged suckers. Distribution and habitat Octopus tehuelchus is native to the subtropical southwestern Atlantic Ocean. Its range extends along the coasts of Brazil and Argentina between 30¬∞S and 44¬∞S, and between 50¬∞W and 65¬∞W. It occurs in the intertidal zone and the shallow subtidal zone, down to depths of around . It occurs over reefs and sandy seabeds, often hiding in crevices or under boulders and in empty mollusc shells. Ecology This octopus feeds on crabs and small clams and is known to drill into gastropod shells to extract hermit crabs. The octopus is itself heavily preyed on by young sharks off the coast of Argentina. Breeding in this species takes place between autumn and spring. As with many other octopus species, the female selects a shelter and broods a batch of eggs. An invertebrate shell is usually chosen as a shelter; small individuals usually choose gastropod shells such as Zidona dufresnei, Odontocymbiola magellanica or Buccinanops cochlidium, clams such as Pitar rostratus or Amiantis purpurata or large barnacles in the genus Balanus. Medium-sized individuals favour shells of the oyster Ostrea puelchana, while the largest individuals create their own shelters from shell fragments and other materials. The oyster is the most favoured shelter overall, with the majority of eggs being deposited inside the concave valve.

Balazs while analyzing data from different gamma-ray and X-ray telescopes, in particular the Swift Spacecraft. The ring of GRBs lies at a distance of about 2.8 gigaparsecs (9.1 billion light years) from Earth at the redshift between 0.78 and 0.86 and measures about 1.72 gigaparsecs (5.6 billion light years) in diameter, making it one of the largest structures known.Robert Massey: 5 billion light years across: the largest feature in the universe. Royal Astronomical Society press release Typically, the distribution of GRBs in the universe appears in the sets of less than the 2œÉ distribution, or with less than two GRBs in the average data of the point-radius system. Thus, such a concentration as this appears extremely unlikely, given accepted theoretical models. Proposals include the existence of a giant supergalactic structure. This would be an extremely huge structure of the universe, with a mean size of about 5.6 billion light years. Such a supercluster can explain the significant distribution of GRBs because of its tie to star formation. If such a structure did exist, it would be one of the largest structures of the observable universe.Five billion light years across: The largest feature in the universe  Discovery  In early July 2015, after the discovery of the Hercules-Corona Borealis Great Wall, I. Horvath, J. Hakkila and Z. Bagoly, among others, conducted a further detailed analysis of the spatial distribution of GRBs within the distant universe. Provided by more than 15 years of data from the Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission, amongst other ground-based telescopes, they assessed the data to see if any more structures can be seen using the method of GRB correlation. Suddenly, they noticed a significant clustering of GRBs within z = 0.78 - 0.86, with nine GRBs are concentrated in that region of 43 by 30 degrees of the sky.Astronomers Discover Ring-Like Structure 5.6 Billion Light-Years Across With further tests and analysis of the clustering, they found out that the sample was indeed having a higher concentration than the expected normal level, indication of a massive galactic structure within the vicinity.

Herodotus relates that, during the Greco-Persian Wars, when the Persian army under Xerxes I invaded Phocis, many of the Phocians took refuge in Tithorea near Neon, and that the latter city was destroyed by the Persians (480 BCE). It was, however, afterwards rebuilt; but was again destroyed, with the other Phocian towns, at the end of the Sacred War. In its neighbourhood, Philomelus, the Phocian general, was defeated, and perished in the flight by throwing himself down from a lofty rock. Neon now disappears from history, and in its place we read of a town Tithorea, which is described by Pausanias. et seq. This writer regards Tithorea as situated on the same site as Neon; and relates that Tithorea was the name anciently applied to the whole district, and that when the inhabitants of the neighbouring villages were collected in the city, the name of Tithorea was substituted for that of Neon. This, however, is not in accordance with the statement of Plutarch, according to whom Tithorea, in the time of the Mithridatic War, was a fortress surrounded by precipitous rocks, where the Phocians took refuge from Xerxes. He further states that it was not such a city as the one existing in his day.Plutarch Sull. 15. If the view of Plutarch is correct, that the fortress, the site of which was afterwards occupied by the city Tithorea, was the place where the Phocians took refuge from Xerxes, we may conclude that Tithorea and Neon were two different places. Some modern writers have followed Pausanias in identifying Tithorea and Neon; but , for the reasons which have been already stated, supposes them to have been different cities, and places Neon at the Hellenic ruins on the Cephissus, called Pale√° Fiva, distant from modern Tithorea (formerly Velitsa, since renamed to reflect the association with the ancient town).

Early life and education  Born in Edmonton, Alberta in 1940 as the eldest of three children, Payne spent much of her time in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories supervising work at her father's gold mine and prospecting minerals. Her mother was a nurse and preferred for Payne to pursue a traditional woman's occupation, resulting in Payne's enrollment at Havergal College, an all-girls school in Toronto, in 1955. She was awarded the Old Girls Life Achievement Award by Havergal. Payne earned her BSc in Geology at the University of Alberta in 1962, and was the only female in her graduating class.  Career  After graduation, Payne joined the Geological Survey of Canada in 1962 where her work was limited to the lab, a typical situation as women-geologists worked only as lab technicians in the 1960s. Wanting to perform field work, Payne obtained an MSc in Geology at the University of Alberta in 1965, but the higher degree did not promote her to field work as she had hoped. Social norms towards female scientists were changing in the late 1960s, and Payne found work in short-term projects, and for the University. In 1979, Payne was hired as an exploration geologist for Gulf Canada Resources in Calgary, Alberta where she continued as Senior Geologist for 15 years. During her time at Gulf Canada Resources, she used her expertise in hardrock mining to introduce a new method for searching for oil and gas, and was eventually promoted to supervisor, a rarity in those times for a woman. In 1992, she became the first female president of the Canadian Society of Petroleum Geologists (CSPG), then acted as director of the Calgary Science Centre from 1995 to 1997. Payne retired in 1995, and started her own company Arctic Enterprises Limited. In 2000, she published Quin Kola: Tom Payne's Search for Gold about her father.

In 1895 he left (other sources say he was expelled for participating in a student uprising) the seminary and entered the Moscow secondary school of Ivan Findler. In 1896 he began to take part in A.P. Alabin's Marxist circle, where he met his future wife, Alevtina Ivanovna Rakitina,http://www.centrasia.ru/person2.php?st=1488626790 a gimnasium student. They married in 1898. In 1898 he entered the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party and started studies at the Moscow Higher Technical School. But in 1899 he was expelled from it due to being involved in the all- Russian student strike. In 1900, together with his wife and a new-born daughter, he was exiled to Riga, Latvia, where he lived and studied at the Riga Polytechnical Institute until 1904. In Riga, Pyotr Kobozev worked at the German-Dutch Van der Zypen und Charlier company manufacturing railroad wagons. He was part of the Riga RSDLP section and a member of the editorial board of the Voice of the Soldier Newspaper. Later on, he, together with his family, went to the petrolium mines in the Caucasus, but returned to Moscow in a short while, where he was arrested and exiled to Riga again. He was blacklisted for his revolutionary activity, which resulted in unemployment, and P. Kobozev had to earn through private tuturing. In 1915 ‚Äî 1916 P. Kobozev and his family were in exile in Orenburg, where he worked as a railroad engineer. In Orenburg P. Kobozev became the leader of the local section of RSDLP, and was under personal control of the governorate's gandarmerie head. = The Revolution = After the February Revolution, Pyotr Kobozev organized an agitation train, in which he covered the route from Orenburg to Tashkent agitating among railroad employees for support of the Bolsheviks. In April 1917, P. Kobozev was appointed the Commissar of the Tashkent railroad, which, however, faced opposition from the Provisional Government and he was commissioned back to Pertrograd. In May 1917, P. Kobozev was elected to the Petrograd City Duma from the Bolsheviks, and was appointed the chief inspector over the educational institutions of the Ministry of Transport. = Dutov's Revolt = On the next day of the October Revolution (October 26), the Cossack Ataman Alexander Dutov claimed power in the Orenburg region. The Mensheviks and the Socialist Revolutionaries approved of it, but the Bolsheviks opposed. Eventually, the supporters of A. Dutov had taken over in the region. P. Kobozev was appointed the extraordinary commissar for fighting Dutov's counterrevolution. On November 12, 1917, P. Kobozev secretly came to Orenburg. He had a coordination meeting with the local Bosheviks and left the city for Buzuluk, from where they planned the offensive. However, only in January 1918, Kobozev's troops managed to get Orenburg back to the Soviet authorities. P. Kobozev drove one of the armored trains himself. = Turkestan and the Far East = After the Orenburg campaign, P. Kobozev was sent to Baku to nationalize the local oil industry, as well as transport Turkestan oil to Central Russia. V. Lenin entrusted P. Kobozev with 200 million rubles to support Bolsheviks in Orenburg, Baku and Tashkent. The task was successfully fulfilled and the oil was sent to Russia. In May 1918 he was elected First President of the Central Executive Committee of Turkestan Soviet Federative Republic and a member of the Revolutionary Military Council of the Turkestan Front. Soon he was called out back to Moscow and appointed the Minister of Transport, where he was in office until June 13, 1918. In September 1918 ‚Äì April 1919 he was a member of the all-Russian Revolutionary Military Council. In February 1919 he was appointed President of Turkestan Regional Party Committee. Being in Turkestan he actively organized building of schools and Turkestan People's University, where in 1919 he gave lectures on energetics. On October 4, 1922, P. Kobozev was appointed the Prime Minister of the Far Eastern Republic, and remained in office until November 14, 1922. During his office the Far East became part of the Soviet Union. P. Kobozev signed the peace treaty between the Far Eastern Republic and Japan on behalf of the Soviet Union.  Academic career  Monument to Pyotr Kobozev in Orenburg In autumn 1923, the severely ill Pyotr Kobozev returned to Moscow and asked to transfer him to academic work. In 1923 ‚Äî 1928 he was the rector of Moscow Land Survey Institute; since 1928 to 1929 ‚Äî the rector of Leningrad Polytechnical Institute. Later he returned to Moscow Land Survey Institute where he organized the department of aerial survey. In 1938 he received the degree of candidate of technical sciences. He gave lectures on project geometry, hydraulics and aerial surveying. He was the head of the National Scientific Institute of Locomotive Construction, took part in organizing building the Moskva-Volga Canal, and gave the technical conclusion on the project of Dnieper Hydroelectric Station.

Early life and education  Wishart was born September 6, 1893 to an affluent family in Edwardian Toronto. Her interest in medicine was influenced by her grandfather and father, who were both doctors. Wishart's brother, D. E. Staunton Wishart (1888‚Äì1958), was also a doctor who taught at the University of Toronto and served as the head of the ear, nose and throat department at the Hospital for Sick Children. After travelling in Europe, she returned to North America with the outbreak of WWI, and studied art in Massachusetts. In 1922 she moved to Baltimore to study with the renowned German medical illustrator Max Br√∂del in the Department of Art as Applied to Medicine at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. The training in Baltimore emphasized anatomical, pathological, and surgical illustration.  Career  In 1925 after moving back to Toronto, Wishart was appointed as an \\"artiste\\" in the Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto. She founded, and was the first director of, the Department of Medical Art Service at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto. She was the sole illustrator of all surgical and anatomical work for the first ten years of the service. In addition to artwork, Wishart also created wax models of human body parts, produced to scale, to allow for four-dimensional instruction. Dorothy Foster Chubb, another of Max Br√∂del's students, assisted Wishart as an illustrator from 1931 to 1939, before accepting a position with John C. Boileau Grant as an illustrator for his An Atlas of Anatomy. Chubb was replaced by Eila Hopper-Ross, who worked with Wishart until 1945. In 1945 Wishart founded a three year diploma in medical illustration, the basis for the university's Master of Science in Biomedical Communications program. During an 1949 address to the University Women's Club, regarding medical illustration as a career, she explained that in addition to high academic achievement and fine art training \\"[t]he medical illustrator must be activated by to success by the desire to search for truth.\\" Wishart retired from the University of Toronto in 1962, succeeded by Nancy Joy.

The next day, school closes early due to the high levels of absenteeism and rumors of an epidemic. Nick, Madison, and Travis choose to flee to the desert, and they want Alicia, Liza, and Chris to follow. Alicia finds Matt ill in his disheveled house. Travis arrives and sees a bite on Matt, who convinces Alicia to leave. The group returns to Madison's home to gather supplies. Travis tells Madison to take the kids to the desert without him; he will catch up. Alicia witnesses her zombified neighbor, Mr. Dawson, attacking Mrs. Cruz across the street, but Madison prevents her from intervening. A mob sets fire to the store adjoining the barbershop, forcing the Salazars and Manawas to flee. The group reaches Travis' truck and escapes, but not before Griselda is injured by a collapsing scaffold. Unable to reach a hospital, the group drives to Madison's house, where Nick, Madison, and Alicia temporarily flee when the zombified Mr. Dawson attempts to enter, attracted by the barking dog Nick had let in. Nick leads Madison and Alicia to the Trans' house next door, where they take a shotgun. All three families decide to stay the night and evacuate in the morning. The next morning, as the Clarks and Manawas start driving away, the National Guard arrives and quarantines the block. While Travis says, \\"It's going to get better,\\" Daniel laments that it's, \\"too late,\\" as he watches a guardsman mark the neighboring house. Soldiers take Griselda and Nick to a hospital, but Nick's family protests his departure. Liza agrees to go to assist the medical team, despite not wanting to leave her son. Travis retreats to the roof and sees the signal from the Dead Zone. Seconds later, he sees and hears gunfire, followed by darkness. The group drives to the National Guard's headquarters to rescue Liza, Griselda, and Nick. Adams agrees to be their guide when let go by Travis. The group infiltrates the base after Daniel distracts the guards by leading a horde of walkers from the arena. Travis, Madison, Daniel, and Ofelia go inside, while Alicia and Chris stay behind. Meanwhile, the walkers breach the perimeter defenses and swarm the base. Travis' group reach the holding cells and set the detainees free before reuniting with Nick, Liza, and Strand. They try to escape through the medical ward, where they discover Dr. Exner has euthanized all of the patients. Dr. Exner tells them of an escape route before presumably committing suicide. Before they can escape, the group encounters Adams, who shoots Ofelia in the arm. Enraged, Travis brutally beats Adams and leaves him for dead. Strand leads the group to his oceanside mansion. =Season 2= The group evacuates to the Abigail as the military bombs Los Angeles, in an attempt to contain the outbreak. Out at sea, the group comes across another boat full of survivors, but Strand refuses to pick them up. Strand informs the group they are heading to San Diego. The group docks on a nearby island to escape pursuit of the unknown ship. They soon have to leave because George poisoned his entire family as part of a suicide pact, and the group are forced to leave the remains of George's family behind on the island. =Season 3= =Season 4= Alicia has came a long way since the beginning of the outbreak. She became a warrior in body and soul. Her main priority is to carry on her mother's legacy, which is to help people especially the innocent.

It is unknown how long he was imprisoned at the temporary hospital set up in Raynard Community College before Nick arrived. He is calm and does not panic when confronting the walkers, even when he was trapped at the end of a locked corridor as a herd approached. He appears to have adapted quickly to the new world, telling Nicholas Clark that the only way to survive a mad world is to embrace the madness. Victor has a good sense of judgement, quickly as weak, yet believing that Nick has the skills to survive, identifying his heroin addiction as a precursor to the behavior necessary for survival.

The character was created by Robert Kirkman, showrunner Dave Erickson and screenwriter Marco Ramirez. Character biography Daniel is a highly intelligent, caring, cautious and formidable man who is a strong, determined survivor. Daniel's past as a secret agent of the Salvadoran Junta and CIA has revealed him to be a highly trained killer, having directly killed 100 people himself (with many more killed indirectly). His training and survival skills have shaped him into a formidable combatant. He is highly adept with firearms and hands to hand combat. Daniel is also shown to be a skilled torturer with extensive knowledge of interrogation techniques and is willing, albeit reluctantly, to use this skill when he feel it is necessary to survive. Daniel however does not appear to be pleased with the past atrocities he has committed or was forced to commit, and regrets being the monster that he was forced to become. Despite his murderous past, Daniel has demonstrated that he cares about his family more than anything else and is a loving husband and father who vowed to give his daughter the best life possible in the United States. He hid from her the truth of his past life, and dealt with the trauma privately with his wife's support. Daniel was shown to be devastated by the loss of his beloved wife, the anchor that kept him stable. He subsequently came unhinged for a time and nearly killed himself. Daniel is extremely cautious around those he does not trust, and appears to be highly skilled at identifying a potential threat from body language and social cues. =Season 1= While a riot rages outside, a mob sets fire to the store adjoining the barbershop, forcing the Salazars and Manawas to flee.

While Travis says, \\"It's going to get better,\\" Daniel laments that it‚Äôs, \\"too late,\\" as he watches a guardsman mark the neighboring house. Days after the National Guard quarantines the neighborhood into a Safe Zone, residents try to live normally. Tensions build under the military rule. Ofelia kisses Adams, who was unable to get Griselda's medicine. She sneaks outside the fence to investigate and finds evidence that the guardsmen killed civilians, even the uninfected. Daniel warns Madison of his El Salvador experience, when the sick were taken under the guise of receiving hospitalization but instead killed. Soldiers take Griselda and Nick to a hospital, but Nick's family protests his departure. Liza agrees to go to assist the medical team, despite not wanting to leave her son. Travis retreats to the roof and sees the signal from the Dead Zone. Seconds later, he sees and hears gunfire, followed by darkness. Madison discovers Daniel detaining Adams in the Trans' basement. Travis learns that Daniel tortured Adams into revealing what \\"Cobalt\\" means: in the morning, all civilians will be killed, and the guardsmen will evacuate the city.

Daniel was also being haunted by his dead wife and ultimately set a prison full of zombies on fire to honor her, and the fire spread throughout the island, causing him to disappear in the mid-season finale. He would not be seen for the remainder of the season. =Season 3= Daniel returns in the third episode \\"TEOTWAWKI\\" after his disappearance in the previous season's mid-season finale \\"Shiva\\". He visits Strand in his cell, and asks about Ofelia's whereabouts, Strand lies about knowing where she is, however, Daniel sees through his lies and walks off.

Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a 9/10 rating, stating; \\"\\"100\\" felt fresh and immediate and for the first time, even though it only focused in on one main character, Fear the Walking Dead felt wholly like its own unique endeavor. The same universe as the original series, sure, but with vitally different perspectives, angles, and objectives. It kind of answered that recurring question \\"Why have another Walking Dead show?\\" as Daniel was constantly saved while also constantly being placed in situations where he was called upon to do harm to innocent people. People who he even owned a great debt to. It was stunning and Ruben Blades was mesmerizing.\\" In December 2018, it was reported that Rub√©n Blades would return in season 5 as Daniel Salazar. In the season premiere episode, Daniel makes a second return to the show after being presumed dead in season three's finale.https://screenrant.com/fear-walking-dead-daniel-salazar-alive-how- explained/ References Category:Characters created by Robert Kirkman Category:Fear the Walking Dead Category:Fictional characters from California Category:Television characters introduced in 2015 ","title":"Daniel Salazar"},{"id":"58552020","text":"Gillian Elizabeth Wu (born 1943) is a Canadian Immunologist and the former Dean of Pure and Applied Science at York University. She is currently Professor Emerita in York University's Faculty of Science (Department of Biology) and Faculty of Health and also at the University of Toronto Faculty of Medicine.  Early life and education  Wu was born in London, England and emigrated to Canada in 1951. Her family settled in Southern Ontario, where her father was a shipbuilder and her mother was a homemaker who encouraged her children in their studies Wu attended McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada for her undergraduate studies, completing a BSc degree in Honours Biology in 1967. She went on to become the first female student to enroll in a graduate program in medical biophysics at the University of Toronto (1967-69). Robert A. Phillips supervised Wu's Master's in Science degree (MSc) research. Her thesis, titled Differentiation of Rosette-forming Cells from Clones of Hemopoietic Stem Cells, was supported by two consecutive graduate scholarships from NSERC and the Medical Research Council of Canada (CIHR). Wu's early interest in immunology was encouraged by Hardy Cinader.  Scientific career  After completing her MSc, Wu did not proceed directly to pursue a doctorate. Instead, she worked as a biophysics technician at the Donner Radiation Labs in UC Berkeley (1969-71), and was a Research Associate at the National Cancer Institute, NIH, in Bethesda, Maryland, USA (1975-76). In 1980, she began her PhD studies at the University of Toronto in medical genetics under the supervision of Helios Murialdo, which resulted in four publications, including one in Cell. In 1984, she worked as a post-doctoral fellow at the Basel Institute for Immunology, after which she was recruited in 1986 to be an assistant professor in the newly formed Department of Immunology at the University of Toronto. In 1988, she moved to the Department of Molecular and Medical Genetics at the University of Toronto, staying until 1993, when she became a Senior Scientist at the Wellesley Hospital Research Institute. In 1998, Wu became a Senior Scientist at the Ontario Cancer Institute based in Princess Margaret Hospital. Throughout this time, Wu retained cross-appointments as a professor in the University of Toronto's Departments of Medical Biophysics and Immunology. In 2001, Wu joined York University as Dean of Science and Engineering in 2001. After serving her term, she retained her professorship in the Department of Biology, but moved her main affiliation to the School of Kinesiology and Health Science (currently the Faculty of Health Sciences), retiring in January 2015. Despite shutting down her research laboratory, Wu remains active in research. In May 2020, Dr. Wu received research funding to collaborate with York University Biology professor Vivian Saridakis, to investigate the hypothesis that variations in the genomic sequences of the virus play a pivotal role in geographic differences in rates of COVID-19 infection, transmission and deaths. Over the decades of her scientific career, Wu has been a visiting scientist and professor at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, France (1996) and at Clare Hall, University of Cambridge (2007), where she has been a Life Member since 2008.  Research  Dr. Wu studies how diversity in antigen-specific B-cell and T-cell receptors are generated. As part of her PhD research, she identified a natural mutation in a cell line that inhibited the secretion of immunoglobulins (Ig). Research from her laboratory determined that variation in the strength of V(D)J recombination signal sequence affects the pattern of Ig gene rearrangement and expression. She also examines the role of the immune system in autoimmune diseases and cancers. Wu's research focuses on the mechanisms of normal and abnormal development in the immune system. To this end, her research is directed in two major areas: 1. Understanding normal B Cell development with particular emphasis on the process of V(D)J recombination; and 2. Understanding abnormal development in the immune system with particular emphasis on studying human cancers and autoimmune diseases. Approaches include in vivo and bioinformatics analyses.  Personal life  Wu married Alan Ming-ta Wu, a fellow graduate student who was in Ernest McCulloch's laboratory. They had two sons, Tim Wu and David Wu.

It was designed by Edwin Hubert Henderson of the Commonwealth Department of Works and Railways and built in 1924. It was added to the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 August 2012.  History  The local area was known as \\"Cronulla Beaches\\" from the early decades of the nineteenth century, but remained largely undeveloped. In the 1860s Thomas Holt acquired a large part of the future shire, and placed tenant farmers on the land. Sutherland Shire was proclaimed in 1906, but by World War I the area remained semi rural in character. The population began to increase after this period, and with a large population increase following World War II, Cronulla became more suburban in character. The first post office in Cronulla opened in 1891 in the Oriental Hotel with Clara Springall as postmistress. A purpose-built post office was erected in 1900, which was replaced in 1924 by the current substantial Cronulla Post Office.Sutherland Shire Heritage Study This building, originally comprising a post office, residence and telephone exchange, was designed by architect Edwin Hubert Henderson of the Commonwealth Department of Works and Railways.  Description  Cronulla Post Office is at 41 Cronulla Street, Cronulla, located on part of lots 12 and 13 in DP 5709. Cronulla Street is the main shopping precinct in the original suburban development of Cronulla, with the Cronulla railway station nearby and the main beaches to the immediate east. Cronulla Street has been turned into a mall outside the post office, which sits on a deep allotment. The post office and quarters open onto Cronulla Street at the front, and a back yard area contains timber and metal-clad outbuildings/additions of more recent origin including a former bicycle storage shed. An ablutions block that formerly occupied the rear yard has been removed. The rear yard and the driveway to the south of the post office has been paved in bitumen. The building comprises a single-storey postal hall to the street frontage with a recessed two-storey wing behind, housing the original quarters upstairs and the mail, sorting and service rooms below. The facade was formed in the well-established Queensland, and then Commonwealth, arrangement of a projecting \\"solid\\" breakfront for the public post office area, set between two hollow bay porch components at ground level. The first floor then inverted the pattern with a central columned balcony recessed between two flanking bays with one window to each. The exterior walling was in a standard Sydney face brick. The postal hall was marked out from its flanking porch components by two rusticated brick piers, a recognisably Commonwealth architectural motif. These piers between the end bays and the centrally placed group of three windows to the ground floor, have narrow windows covered by a saltire cross motif formed as a metal grille across them. The three central windows to the postal hall were framed by four quasi-pilasters, using face brick shafts and stucco-rendered Tuscan capitals. These complement the six timber posts that flank the recessed balcony immediately above and support the entablature. The window-heads and balcony lintel are all surmounted by two moulded stucco friezes running across each storey, with the lower forming a plate for the Post Office label. The windows are all double-hung sashes with multipaned upper lights and tilted brick sills. The upper sash of the end bay at south has had its glazing bars removed to fit an electric exhaust fan. Both flanking porch bays have been filled in with brick and with a timber framed window matching those on the postal hall front. The porches internally have been incorporated to form part of the retail space. Another door opening, on the ground floor south elevation, has also been infilled. A flagpole is fixed to the wall, adjacent to the former south porch. It was fitted after the building was completed. The original side gates have been replaced with unsympathetic mock-Victorian aluminium gates. The bicycle shed and store in the back yard are of recent origin. The roof of the first floor is a hipped timber frame. The lower roof is flat and concealed behind a parapet and forms the floor of the upstairs balcony. The roofing here is believed to be asbestos sheeting.Post Manager, pers. comm. 9 April 2008 The rear (west) roofing was in two hipped trailing wings, the northern wing having an addition on the ground level. A rear balcony on the upper floor, between the trailing wings has been infilled in timber and casement windows. The ground floor interior retains little original fabric, and there is a standard post shop retail fitout with modern shelving units, and a suspended ceiling form. The first floor quarters retains most of its original fabric including two timber fireplaces, doors, architraves and joinery including polished timber stair balusters as well as a large panelled timber cabinet at the top of the stairs. The original planning on the first floor has been altered in places through the partial removal of walls and the insertion of new door openings. The extension north along Cronulla Street, was added in the 1970s. It housed a post office box lobby, with two open frontages on either side of a brick screen. This screen was surfaced in similar brick to that on the original building, and seemed intended as a link. The screen has since been removed. This addition has boxed eaves that conceal its metal decking roof. The eaves are fronted by a crimped metal-skinned fascia about 1.6 m deep. This lines up with the main cornice above the original postal hall and one of the projecting courses of the 1924 rusticated brick piers. The soffit in this extension is cement sheet or similar and the walls are rendered and face brick. = Key areas/elements = The key elements of the post office are its: * Cronulla Street (east) elevation * Intact interior of the original quarters and timber stair = Condition = The overall condition of the building is fair, due to the size of and limited compatibility of the extension at the north end, and the infilling of the original porches. The upstairs of the building (quarters) is extremely intact, the remainder of the building, interior and exterior, displays a lower level of intactness. = Original fabric = The surviving original fabric of the building consists of: * Structural frame: concrete footings and piers, the latter clad in brick. Steel box framed roof on newer north wing, with metal deck cladding and fascia. Timber roof frame on original building. Windows to the original building are timber framed, and those to the later north wing are aluminium framed. * External walls: dark fired red face brick in stretcher bond with stucco mouldings, course lines and cornices. The frontal base coursing is cement rendered. * Internal walls: timber (stud) framed walls with plasterboard cladding. Walls of first floor quarters are fibrous plaster or lath on plaster. * Floor: timber floor framing in original post office building. Concrete flooring in the north wing. * Ceiling: suspended ceiling form in retail areas and in the later wing. Lath and plaster or fibrous plaster in upstairs quarters. Other ceilings are plasterboard. * Roof: timber framed, clad in Marseilles-pattern terracotta tile (original building). Steel box frame, crimped metal decking as cladding and fascia on north wing.  Heritage listing  Cronulla Post Office was listed on the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 August 2012 having satisfied the following criteria. Criterion A: Processes Cronulla Post Office, constructed in 1924 and designed by architect Edwin Hubert Henderson of the Commonwealth Department of Works and Railways, has historical significance deriving from its prominent location within central Cronulla, and its association with the growth in local development in the first half of the twentieth century. The building, originally comprising a post office, residence and telephone exchange, was relatively substantial and clearly intended to meet the needs of the developing area. Criterion D: Characteristic values Cronulla Post Office is an example of: * a post office and telegraph office with quarters (second generation typology 1870-1929) * an interwar era building in a Georgian Revival style * the work of EH Henderson, Commonwealth Department of Works and Railways Typologically, Cronulla Post Office was constructed as a combined post and telegraph office with a residence at first floor level in 1924. The original layout of the postal functions at ground level have been removed and replaced with a standard post shop retail fitout and suspended ceiling form, however, the original layout, joinery and fixtures of the residence on the first floor are largely intact. The original porches flanking the postal hall have also been infilled and incorporated into the interior of the post office and an addition has been constructed to the north of the original building. These alterations have compromised the typological intactness of the building, albeit the upper level residence interior remains more intact. Architecturally and stylistically, Cronulla Post Office is a suburban post office in the Interwar Georgian revival style, a decade later than earlier post office designs in this style. Compositionally, the original building is marked by broad reversals of solid and void to its Cronulla Street fa√ßade in a symmetrical fashion, with the postal hall flanked by porches and a setback balcony to the first floor. The infilling of the flanking porch bays and the 1970s addition to the north of the building have compromised the symmetrical nature of the original building, although it remains a reasonably well crafted and finely detailed post office building. Criterion E: Aesthetic characteristics Cronulla Post Office is a good albeit altered example of the Interwar Georgian Revival style. The building demonstrates the strong massing, considered proportions, simple geometric forms and minimal detail typical of this style, all of which enhance its streetscape contribution. The red brick exterior also assists the building in standing out in its streetscape context.

Gameplay Heroic Fantasy is a game in which the players lead a team of characters through a nine-story maze. There is no final object of the game or way to \\"win\\"; the purpose of the game is to advance by negotiating challenging mazes, defeating monsters, and collecting treasure and experience points. At the outset, players choose a party of up to fifteen characters using one hundred \\"points\\", which can be used to maximize the size of the party or choose a smaller party of stronger characters. Various options are available when choosing characters including races such as dwarves, giants, fairies, leprechauns, and gremlins; and types such as magic users or fighters. While negotiating mazes, players have various spells available for use, including \\"blast\\", \\"sleep\\", and \\"fireball\\". Players can find different types of treasure in the mazes, to include four types of potions: healing, strength, poison, and Stygean, the latter which adds \\"ten to the character's Constitution regardless of its current value\\". According to Jim Townsend there is also a fifth‚Äîa cloning potion‚Äîwhich replicates a character that is \\"VERY rare\\". Players can also find magical items such as elf cloaks, fairy rings, glowing amulets, shining and glowing rings, and Thundereggs, which have various properties and effects, as well as basic treasure such as gold rings, coins, and jewels, which provide only experience points. While exploring mazes, players can encounter other player characters as well as monsters run by the computer, or non player characters (NPCs), with the latter being more prevalent. According to Jim Townsend, NPCs belong to clans, and actions taken against one are viewed similarly by other NPCs in the same clan (e.g., an attack against one clan NPC will cause other clan NPCs to attack a player's party on sight later). Publication history Heroic Fantasy was Flying Buffalo's third PBM, which the company also made available as an early turn-based computer game on a commercial network known as \\"TheSource\\".

She was also a metal worker and jewellery designer. Life Kathleen Quigly was born in Dublin on 6 March 1888. Her father was Richard Quigly, a civil engineer. In her early childhood she travelled abroad with her family. She then attended the Central School of Arts and Crafts in London and then entered the Dublin Metropolitan School of Art around 1906. There she studied under the school's first stained glass master, Alfred E. Child, discovering a talent for illuminating glass. She went on to occasionally work with An T√∫r Gloine under Sarah Purser. She showed a copper cup and stand at the 1910 exhibition of the Arts and Crafts Society of Ireland while she was still a student. In 1911 she contributed pages to the illuminated album with panels and borders of Celtic ornament, Address of welcome to Queen Mary from the women of Ireland. She exhibited with the Royal Hibernian Academy (RHA) in 1917 with two works, and was living at 5 Clareville Road, Dublin. The same year she showed a wood-block print, Girl with two lamps, with the Arts and Crafts Society. By 1917, Quigly was a member of the Guild of Irish Artworkers, representing the Guild on the council of the Arts and Crafts Society of Ireland in 1917. Quigly began working for Harry Clarke in January 1919, at his studios in North Frederick Street, becoming a full employee in October 1921. Said by some to have been his most valuable assistant, she worked with Clarke until 1924, working on St Stephen's window in a church in Gorey, County Wexford and the Angel of peace and hope window in Holy Trinity church, Killiney, County Dublin. She created three windows for the dolls house, Titania's Palace. Her most notable work she created with Clarke is the Eve of St Agnes, when it was shown at the Aonach Tailteann art exhibition in August 1924 it won a trophy gold medal. The window is now display at the Hugh Lane Gallery. At the 1925 Arts and Crafts exhibition, Quigly exhibited the Annunciation window, while also helping to organise the exhibition. In the same year she showed three works with the RHA and was living at 14 Westmoreland Street. Between 1930 and 1934, she exhibited a further 7 works with the RHA. She continued to create commissions, including windows for the treasure house of Eu Tong Sen, a wealthy Singapore merchant, in 1927 she completed a window for the chapel at the Sacred Heart Convent, Newton, near Boston, Massachusetts, and in 1929 she created three of the decorative borders of the official handbook for Dublin civic week. In 1932 she showed on portrait and four stained-glass panels at the Oireachtas art exhibition. After this Quigly emigrated to South Africa, where she lived for the rest of her life. At first she painted, exhibiting with Transvaal art society and the South African Academy in Johannesburg in 1935, 1936, and 1939. She began working with A. L. Watson in a stained glass studio after she settled in Johannesburg. From there she made over a hundred windows, and during the 1950s she is thought to be the only female stained glass artist in South Africa. She retired to Rhodesia, and died in Marandellas on 15 August 1981. She is often listed as Kathleen Quigley, but she always signed her name as Quigly.

It is made from Aramid composite materials and is used by all branches of the Bundeswehr. History A Bundeswehr soldier with his basic gear, including a G36 and the M92 helmet. The Federal Office of Defense Technology and Procurement (Bundesamt f√ºr Wehrtechnik und Beschaffung) commissioned the Federal Ministry of Defence to investigate new helmet concepts since the end of the 1960s. In order to achieve a higher impact strength, different materials were tested, including titanium and plastics. However, at that time the use of titanium helmets was uneconomical due to the high production costs, while plastics were not mature enough at the time to meet military demands; composite materials were also checked. The shape of the helmet is derived from the U.S. PASGT helmet. The first M92 was issued in 1992 to the Bundeswehr. Pakistan and Singapore were known to have received 826 helmets for field testing for potential adoption. In May 2015, it was reported that the German Ministry of Defense is considering to replace all M92s used by the Bundeswehr.https://www.n-tv.de/politik/Bundeswehr-tauscht-Helme-aus- article15126926.html This is due to problems in the helmet's production where loose bolts were able to escape from inspections. =Development= Induyco SA M√ºnchen developed the M92 based on the MARTE helmet of the Spanish Army,http://www.cascoscoleccion.com/alemania/al826.html/https://www.n-tv.de/politik/Bundeswehr- tauscht-Helme-aus-article15126926.html consisting of 29 layers of aramid fiber.

It was added to the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 8 November 2011.  History  The Nambucca Post Office opened in Macksville on 1 August 1868 and was renamed Macksville Post Office in 1889. However as the population in the area grew, the post office became inadequate, leading to an announcement in 1912 to erect a new post office at a new location. However, there were issues over purchase of a new site, and in 1914 it was decided that the existing post office would suffice and the need for a new post office would be reconsidered in 1915-1916. By 1915, there was considerable local agitation for the construction of a new post office, with one of the residents describing the existing post office as \\"a medium sized dog kennel\\". Through 1916, there were numerous promises made to construct the new post office, but it was not until January 1917 that residents were advised that the Commonwealth Department of Works and Railways were instructed to build the post office. The new Macksville Post Office opened for business on Monday 18 February 1918 without any ceremony. Macksville Post Office was designed and constructed c. 1917. It was built with a small free-standing telephone exchange beside it, on River Street, which now serves as a mail contractors space. Recent additions include a new private box area, toilets and a lunch/staff room. The National Inventory of Federation Places lists Macksville Post Office as, \\"one of the first two post offices built entirely by the Commonwealth from 1917\\". The building was designed by the Commonwealth Department of Works and Railways (NSW Branch) under the direction of George Oakeshott with E. Ferguson probably being the design architect.  Description  Macksville Post Office is on the southwest corner of Cooper Street (Pacific Highway) and River Street, Macksville, just south of the Nambucca Bridge. It comprises the whole of Lot 1 DP816339. The L-shaped building is expressed in two face brick arms projecting east and north, each fronted with a trio of double-hung timber framed sash windows, single-paned to the lower sash and six-paned in the upper. The face brick is capped by a stucco frieze below the eaves line that cuts across the grouped windows about 30 cm below their heads. The frieze facing Cooper Street carries the inscription MACKSVILLE POST OFFICE. The entry is via an oblong porch between the two wings, and linked to the roofline with a shared pitch line. The porch is supported at the intersection corner by a pair of face brick piers. The roof, clad in corrugated galvanised iron, is a shallow hipped roof, and all pitches are fairly low, brought out to a shallow fascia that is largely concealed behind the guttering. The eaves project c. 60 cm out from the walls, providing some northern and eastern sun shading. The soffits appear to follow the roof pitch. The rafters are exposed on the original section, and the soffit is lined with timber boards, as is the porch ceiling. The projecting north front, facing the river, houses the retail area, and the projecting east front, facing Cooper Street, is now the back office. Two pedestrian ramps have been built up across the Cooper Street frontage. They are paved in a brick tile, as is the porch area. A later addition houses the lunch room and a Post Office box bay, set back from the original Cooper Street frontage, was added after that, probably in the 1970s or early 1980s. The lunch room may have replaced an open, southeast facing porch on the south side of the Cooper Street breakfront, where earlier PO box installations were common. The back yard has an original bicycle shed which has been relined on its exposed face with \\"hardiplank\\". An old garage stands at the end of the Cooper Street yard and is now used for storage. Locker rooms and toilets are located behind the PO box areas. The postal manager has an office in a projecting area to the rear, with an attached storeroom. This office has been completely refurbished in recent times. A former Telecom Australia shed, facing River Street, now houses the contractors' back office, and is sited next to the bicycle shed. The telephone exchange shed is timber-lined and weatherboard clad and in need of repair. It contains a double hung timber framed window which is only visible from within the bicycle store. = Condition = The building is in good condition generally given its age and changes in use. Externally Macksville Post Office's integrity is good with respect to the original concept and design. Changes since that period have been to the south side and away from the principal view from the road intersection. Accretions such as signage, pavements, ramped access and lighting are minor, and have not diminished the overall integrity of this building. Internally, changes are minimal especially in the public space which still retains its original ceiling. Visually it remains a Federation building. One fireplace remains but is bricked in. The chimney remains in place. The original rendered walls with expressed dado moulding and some picture rails are still in situ. The current post office fit-outs include modern shelving systems, furnishings and fit-out that tend to obscure the original fixtures, windows and doors. The former telephone exchange, a freestanding structure beside the post office, was converted to mail contractors space. The additions of the private box area, toilets and lunch space, probably occurred during the 1980s.  Heritage listing  Macksville Post Office was listed on the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 8 November 2011 having satisfied the following criteria. Criterion A: Processes Macksville Post Office, constructed in 1917, is of historical significance as one of the first two New South Wales post offices, along with Botany Post Office, designed by Commonwealth architects. Although extended and modified, the building still presents as a 1917-era structure. The free-standing timber-clad telephone exchange is extant, although in poor condition and no longer used for its original function.

Cause Body odor encompasses axillary (underarm) odor and foot odor. It is caused by a combination of sweat gland secretions and normal skin microflora. In addition, androstane steroids and the ABCC11 transporter are essential for most axillary odor. Body odor is a complex phenomenon, with numerous compounds and catalysts involved in its genesis. Secretions from sweat glands are initially odorless, but preodoriferous compounds or malodor precursors in the secretions are transformed by skin surface bacteria into volatile odorous compounds that are responsible for body malodor. Water and nutrients secreted by sweat glands also contribute to body odor by creating an ideal environment for supporting the growth of skin surface bacteria. Types There are three types of sweat glands: eccrine, apocrine, and apoeccrine. Apocrine glands are primarily responsible for body malodor and, along with apoeccrine glands, are mostly expressed in the axillary (underarm) regions, whereas eccrine glands are distributed throughout virtually all of the rest of the skin in the body, although they are also particularly expressed in the axillary regions, and contribute to malodor to a relatively minor extent. Sebaceous glands, another type of secretory gland, are not sweat glands but instead secrete sebum (an oily substance), and may also contribute to body odor to some degree. The main odorous compounds that contribute to axillary odor include: # Unsaturated or hydroxylated branched fatty acids, with the key ones being (E)-3-methyl-2-hexenoic acid (3M2H) and 3-hydroxy-3-methylhexanoic acid (HMHA) # Sulfanylalkanols, particularly 3-methyl-3-sulfanylhexan-1-ol (3M3SH) # Odoriferous androstane steroids, namely the pheromones androstenone (5Œ±-androst-16-en-3-one) and androstenol (5Œ±-androst-16-en-3Œ±-ol) These malodorous compounds are formed from non-odoriferous precursors that are secreted from apocrine glands and converted by various enzymes expressed in skin surface bacteria. The specific skin surface bacteria responsible are mainly Staphylococcus and Corynebacterium species. The androstane steroids dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) and androsterone sulfate have been detected in an extract of axillary hairs together with high concentrations of cholesterol. Apocrine sweat contains relatively high amounts of androgens, for instance dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), androsterone, and testosterone, and the androgen receptor (AR), the biological target of androgens, is strongly expressed in the secretory cells of apocrine glands. In addition, 5Œ±-reductase type I, an enzyme which converts testosterone into the more potent androgen dihydrotestosterone (DHT), has been found to be highly expressed in the apocrine glands of adolescents, and DHT has been found to specifically contribute to malodor as well. Starting at puberty, males have higher levels of androgens than do females and produce comparatively more axillary malodor. As such, it has been proposed that the higher axillary malodor seen in males is due to greater relative stimulation of axillary apocrine sweat glands by androgens. Genetics ABCC11 is a gene encoding an apical ATP-driven efflux transporter that has been found to transport a variety of lipophilic anions including cyclic nucleotides, estradiol glucuronide, steroid sulfates such as DHEA-S, and monoanionic bile acids. It is expressed and localized in apocrine glands, including in the axilla, the ceruminous glands in the auditory canal, and in the mammary gland. A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 538G‚ÜíA in ABCC11 that leads to a G180R substitution in the encoded protein has been found to result in loss-of-function via affecting N-linked glycosylation and in turn causing proteasomal degradation of the protein. This polymorphism has been found to be responsible for the dry and white earwax phenotype, and is considered to be unique as it has been described as the only human SNP that has been found to determine a visible genetic trait. In addition to earwax phenotype, the ABCC11 genotype has been found to be associated with colostrum secretion from the breasts as well as normal axillary odor and osmidrosis (excessive axillary malodor). A functional ABCC11 protein has been found to be essential for the presence of the characteristic strong axillary odor, with the 538G‚ÜíA SNP leading to a loss of secretion of axillary malodorous precursors and a nearly complete loss of axillary odor in those who are homozygous for the polymorphism. Specifically, the secretion of the amino-acid conjugates 3M2H-Gln, HMHA-Gln, and Cys-Gly-(S) 3M3SH, which are precursors of key axillary malodorous compounds including the unsaturated or hydroxylated branched-chain fatty acids 3M2H and HMHA and the sulfanylalkanol 3M3SH, has been found to be abolished in homozygotic carriers of the SNP, and the odoriferous androstane steroids androstenone and androstenol and their precursors DHEA and DHEA-S have been found to be significantly reduced as well. Patients with axillary osmidrosis (538G/G or 538G/A genotype) were found to have significantly more numerous and relatively large axillary apocrine glands compared to controls with the A/A genotype. Fatty Acids In contrast to the aforementioned odoriferous compounds, the levels of long straight-chain fatty acids such as hexadecanoic acid, octadecanoic acid, octadecanoic acid, and linolic acid and short straight-chain fatty acids such as butyric acid, hexanoic acid, and octanoic acid in axillary sweat have not been found to be affected by the ABCC11 genotype, which suggests that their secretion is independent of ABCC11. These straight-chain fatty acids are odoriferous, but differently and to a much lesser extent compared to branched-chain fatty acids. In accordance, it has been said that it is very likely that these aliphatic straight-chain fatty acids are responsible for the faint sour acidic axillary odor that has previously been observed in most Japanese individuals. In addition to the secretion of straight-chain fatty acids, axillary microflora did not appear to differ between homozygous carriers of the 538G‚ÜíA SNP and non-carriers. The ABCC11 transporter appears to be involved both in the transport of androstane steroids into the secretory cells of apocrine glands and in the secretion of preodoriferous compounds from axillary apocrine glands. Specific steroids that ABCC11 has been found to transport include steroid sulfates like DHEA-S and estrone sulfate and steroid glucuronides like estradiol glucuronide. In accordance with its transport of compounds involved in axillary odor, ABCC11 alleles are strongly associated with axillary odor. Asians have little or faint axillary odor, whereas Caucasians and Africans have strong axillary odor, and this has been found to be due to genetic differences in the ABCC11 gene.

Of those with a diagnosis of PTSD, a co-occurring, or comorbid diagnosis of a SUD is present in 20‚Äì35% of that clinical population. Prevalence of SUD and PTSD may increase depending on specific populations. For example, the prevalence of both PTSD and SUD is higher in combat veterans. Of those with a SUD diagnosis, current PTSD is present in 25‚Äì50%, and lifetime PTSD is present in 15‚Äì40%, averaging 30% overall. Though roughly a third of all people diagnosed with SUD also have PTSD, there is not yet consistent protocol for SUD treatment centers to screen for both PTSD and SUD symptomology upon intake. The presence of both PTSD and SUD can hinder outcomes of those seeking treatment for either PTSD or SUD. Those who experience both diagnoses may generally have poorer overall functioning and worse overall well-being than each diagnosis by itself. This can manifest as being hospitalized more frequently, experiencing increased levels of legal issues, have less social support, and have a harder time retaining employment. In treatment these individuals can have high dropout rates, respond poorly to the treatment of PTSD in general, have greater levels of addiction severity, and shorter periods of remission for substance use treatment.  Etiological theory  Each of the subsequent theories about the causal link between PTSD and SUD have varying levels of empirical support. These etiological theories are not mutually exclusive, and features of more than one can be present for an individual with dual diagnoses of SUD and PTSD. No one clear etiological link has been established between SUD and PTSD. = Susceptibility hypothesis = The susceptibility hypothesis suggests that the substance use may increase the risk of PTSD developing after a traumatic event. Individuals who use substances may lack appropriate coping mechanisms to deal with daily stressors before the traumatic event, they may be less equipped than individuals who do not use substances to cope with extreme stress. Thus, these individuals be more susceptible to developing PTSD following a traumatic event. = Implication of coping strategies = Coping style has recurrently been discussed as a third-party influence on the presence of dual diagnosis for PTSD and SUD. Avoidant coping styles have been shown to have a strong relationship to both PTSD and SUD individually, as well as presentation of concomitant PTSD and SUD together. Those with avoidant coping styles attempt to avoid interacting with or experiencing thoughts, feelings, or physical sensations reminiscent of the stressor in order to gain relief from the distress it causes. Substance use, for example, can allow a person to attempt to escape the distressing thoughts, feelings or physical sensations associated with the stressor the person is attempting to avoid experiencing. An avoidant coping style can therefore increase an individual's likelihood to seek means to avoid experiencing distressing sensations and increase likelihood of substance use overall.  PTSD affects substance use disorders  Individuals with comorbid PTSD and SUD tend to engage in more frequent and heavier substance use than individuals who have SUD alone. Additionally, research suggests that symptoms of PTSD can hinder abstaining from substance use. More generally, individuals with a dual diagnosis of PTSD and SUD have shown to be at increased risk meeting criteria for other psychiatric diagnosis in additional to PTSD and SUD when compared to those with SUD alone. Those with a dual diagnosis of PTSD and SUD have also been shown to seek treatment at higher rates than those who experience SUD alone. = How substance use disorders affect PTSD = The self medication hypothesis, as well as behavioral and emotional conditioning plays a role for people with dual diagnoses of PTSD and SUD. Symptoms of withdrawal, increased heart rate, sweating can mirror a human's natural physiological responses to fear, and can therefore trigger fear responses associated with that person's traumatic experience. Those with comorbid PTSD and SUD diagnoses may seek to avoid experiencing withdrawal to avoid experiencing these sensations that can act as fear inducing and triggering experiential catalysts. Additionally, individuals who chronically use substances as a form of self-medication for PTSD symptoms strengthen an automatic mental link between PTSD symptoms and the substance use itself via conditioning. Therefore, conditioned link between PTSD and substance use may trigger craving for substances when it arises, potentially increasing psychological dependence and complicating treatment outcomes for both diagnoses.  Implicated brain systems  = Hippocampus and amygdala = The hippocampus, which is responsible for encoding memory within the brain, is implicated in both PTSD and SUD. PTSD and SUD have been found to interfere with typical hippocampal functioning. Studies of the involvement of the hippocampus in both sole PTSD and SUD diagnosis as well as comorbid PTSD and SUD evidence that the manifestation of these diagnosis are related to decreased hippocampal volume. Hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis and corticotropin-releasing hormone. The hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis is responsible for the activation of the hormonal stress response system within the human body. Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is activated by the HPA axis during times of stress. Heightened CRH levels have been shown during symptoms of PTSD (particularly for hyperarousal), drug seeking behavior, substance withdrawal, and drug relapse in humans. Research has conveyed that increased levels of CRH are also related to experiences of euphoria. As CRH levels are elevated in PTSD, this can personify feelings of euphoria experienced when an individual uses substances and increase addiction severity as a result of positive reinforcement from euphoric sensation. This can also affect the interplay between withdrawal symptoms and the increased experience of hyperarousal. As increased levels of CRH have been linked to both withdrawal and hyperarousal, those affected by both diagnoses of PTSD and SUD may subsequently continue to seek substances as a means to avoid these escalated aversive sensations. The described relationship has been used to evidence the self-medication hypothesis.  Treatment options  Assessment of effectiveness of treatment for comorbid PTSD and SUD has fluctuated. While some treatments for cooccurring PTSD and SUD have shown promising in symptom reduction for both diagnoses, many have not evidenced the ability to be more effective than treatment of PTSD or SUD alone. This is further complicated by high rates of treatment dropout and substance relapse in studies of treatment in this population. Research has focused on two major forms of treatment for those with comorbid SUD and PTSD: treatments that focus on the traumatic experience(s), and treatments that do focus on traumatic experience(s). Research has not definitely concluded that any form of treatment adequately addresses the treatment needs of those who have both PTSD and SUD. = Non- trauma focused treatments = Treatments that are non-trauma focused do not emphasize the individual's exposure to the trauma memory as a means to treat both PTSD and SUD. Seeking safety is the most well-known non-trauma focused treatment for SUD and PTSD and is based on cognitive behavior therapy. The goal of seeking safety's is to increase the safety of the individual's coping style by addressing thoughts, behaviors, and interpersonal interactions for the individual seeking treatment. Additional non-trauma focused treatments include but are not limited to CBT for PTSD (CBT-P) in existing addiction treatment programs, substance dependency posttraumatic stress disorder (SDPT), and transcend therapy. = Trauma focused treatments = Trauma focused forms of treatment aim to focus on, process, and identify the meaning of the traumatic experience of the individual while concurrently addressing needs of comorbid SUD. A modified version of seeking safety, seeking safety plus exposure therapy revised, incorporates imagined exposure to the traumatic event into the seeking safety treatment protocol. Concurrent treatment of PTSD and cocaine dependence (CTPCD), also referred to as concurrent treatment of PTSD and substance use disorders with prolonged exposure (COPE), merges typical prolonged exposure protocol for the treatment of PTSD with CBT protocol for SUD. Symptom outcomes have shown improvement in the assessment of the efficacy of trauma-focused treatments for both PTSD and SUD, however effects of the treatment have been small, and they have not evidenced ability to treat both disorders over and above the treatment of either PTSD or SUD alone. Of note, research has conveyed that exposure-based treatments for individuals with PTSD and SUD see high dropout rates, with rates typically peaking around the session that introduces exposure of trauma-based memories to the client. This has created impediments for assessing the efficacy of trauma-focused therapies for people with both SUD and PTSD compared to assessing the efficacy of treating PTSD and SUD separately. = Pharmacological and integrated psychotherapy treatments for PTSD and AUD = Pharmacological interventions alone or in combination with psychotherapy have been examined in the treatment of the PTSD and AUD comorbidity, with varying success. The opioid antagonist naltrexone is generally effective when administered alone in reducing drinking outcomes, with no effect on PTSD symptoms, while the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) sertraline is generally ineffective in reducing PTSD symptoms or AUD symptoms when administered without psychotherapy. Research integrating naltrexone with an exposure-based treatment for PTSD, such as prolonged exposure, has demonstrated modest support for this integrative framework on the reduction of drinking outcomes and amelioration of PTSD symptoms.

Background The British under Colonel Donald Campbell, and the Maratha Empire forces under Morari Rao were under march, and they encamped near Ooscata. The British contingent invited the Maratha to encamp within their defensive lines, but due to the illness of Mohammed Ali, the Nawab of Arcot, Rao declined, and they threw up their own picket a short distance away. Meanwhile, Hyder Ali was nearby and decided to attack the Maratha forces in the night. Battle The Mysore cavalry attacked behind Hyder Ali's war elephants, which took down the defences. Rao instructed his cavalry to remain unmounted, so that his forces could bring down any mounted troops; knowing them to be enemy. In the chaos Rao's state elephant broke loose, and wielding its chain as a weapon, threw back the cavalry in the face of the supporting infantry. Disheartened the Mysore troops retreated, with a loss of some 300 troops compared with the Maratha losses of 18. As the British had been alerted and were advancing to relieve the Maratha, Hyder Ali decided against further attacks. The British lost Cambell's aide de camp, Gee who had ridden to the Maratha camp to investigate, and been shot down under Rao's blanket orders to kill mounted men.

It was rediscovered in an archaeological dig in 1931 in Jajce, Bosnia and Herzegovina. History Mithra was worshipped throughout the Roman era, from the late Republic to the later Imperial era. The cult of Mithraism spread from the Middle East to other parts of the Roman Empire throughout the Mediterranean basin, at first by military-political adventurers, travelers, slaves and merchants from the Orient. Later, Mithraism was spread by soldiers whose legions came into contact with the followers of the cult in the East. The temple dates to the early 4th century AD, although it could be as ancient as the 2nd century AD with repairs undertaken during the early 4th century AD. This particular Mithraeum is one of the best preserved sites in Europe. The Jajce site is a typical spelaea. Mithraism followers typically sought to set up their places of worship in caves. In absence of such topographical features, they excavated the soil and built small single-celled temple (spelaea) to reinforce the impression of a cave. Discovery and protection The remains of the Mithraeum in Jajce were discovered accidentally during excavation for the construction of a private house in 1931. The site was purchased by the Society for the Preservation of Antiquities in Jajce and soon after, a protective stone and mortar structure was constructed under the supervision of engineer F. Steiner. This structure was repaired in 1952 and survived until 2012, despite significant damage suffered during the 1992-96 war. A new facility replaced the previous one following the 2012 renovation, which cost approximately 260.000 KM (BAM) and was carried out under the MDG-F program \\"Promotion cultural understanding in Bosnia and Herzegovina\\" with the financial support of the Kingdom of Spain government.

Agrestius was the notary (notarius) of King Theuderic II, probably until the king's death 613. Following the accession of Chlothar II, he entered the monastery of Luxeuil, founded by the Irish monk Columban in 590. Since Columban had been forced into exile by Theuderic, the monastery was under the leadership of Eustace. Eustace sent Agrestius on a mission to evangelize (or reform the church) in Bavaria, a mission which Eustace had himself undertaken previously. According to Jonas of Bobbio, an opponent of Agrestius, the mission was a failure. It was, however, during his return from Bavaria through Italy that Agrestius became persuaded to take the side of the church of Aquileia, in opposition to that of Rome, in the so-called schism of the Three Chapters. Columban himself had been initially sympathetic to the Aquileians, perhaps under the influence of his patron, Queen Theodelinda, before finally siding with Rome. Agrestius wrote a letter to Attala, Columban's successor as abbot of Bobbio, denouncing his adherence to Rome. When this protest failed to gain traction, he took his grievance to Eustace, who at first received him cordially but ultimately excommunicated him. The dispute over the correct interpretation of the Columbanian tradition occupied Agrestius and Eustace into the 620s. Although Jonas, Columban's biographer, writing in the early 640s, portrays Agrestius as a new Judas and Cain, modern scholars consider it likely that his views were closer to those of Columban than were those of Eustace. Agrestius also attacked the Rule of Columban, the norm by which the community of Luxeuil lived. Agrestius' aristocratic connections brought him powerful allies, including Warnachar II, the Burgundian mayor of the palace. He even wrote a petition to Chlothar II, which resulted in a synod being held in M√¢con in 626 or 627 to adjudicate the dispute. This itself was under the auspices of Agrestius' uncle, Abelenus, then bishop of Geneva. A year after the synod, Agrestius was murdered by one of his servants.

This would destroy long-time enemies of the Macedonian state and secure a path to Rome. Some twenty years before, Philip had lost a war against the Roman Republic, known as the Second Macedonian War. However, war was again threatened. The Dardanians used every opportunity to loot Macedonia, and Philip's army was too weak at the time to attack them. In 179 BC Philip died, just after the Bastarnae left their homeland. When they heard the news about Philip's death, the Bastarnae began moving through the Odrysian Kingdom. The Thracians felt that after the king's death, they were no longer under obligation to help and supply these barbarians. The Bastarnae started looting Odrysia in search for food. The Thracians made up an army, but they were weaker than the Bastarnae. The Bastarnae beat them and made them evacuate to hills and mountains. Thracian soldiers and families moved to Thracia's highest peak, Mt. Musala. The Bastarnae chased them, but when they reached the mountains, a heavy storm hit them and they retreated.  War  Some 30,000 Bastarnae started moving to Dardania, while others returned home. They reached Dardania in autumn of 179 BC. The Bastarnae formed several camps. The Dardanians thought they were going to vanquish the enemy easily, but years passed and attackers were still there. In 176 BC Dardanian king Monunius II sent a delegation to Rome, accusing Macedonian king Perseus of invading the Bastarnae. Perseus wanted good relations with the Roman Republic, so he denied all accusations. The Dardanians waited to attack until the Bastarnae‚Äôs allies, the Scordisci and the Thracians, were busy working in the fields. They split into two groups; one to attack the front, and the other attacking from the flank. The first group arrived too early and was defeated. The Bastarnae pushed them and besieged them in their city. The other group of Dardanian soldiers were not aware of this, so they continued moving towards the enemy camp. The Bastarnae left their camp empty. Without their camp, they started retreating. On their way home they crossed the frozen river of the Danube. Ice started cracking and almost all Bastarnae soldiers died. Their leader, Clondicus, survived. The Dardanians won the war, but they were heavily damaged and reduced in power. Dardania continued to exist until Roman conquest in 28 BC.

Adamson is currently Editor-at-Large of The Magazine Antiques, Editor of Journal of Modern Craft, and a freelance writer and curator. Adamson has held previous notable appointments as the Director of the Museum of Arts and Design, Head of Research at the Victoria and Albert Museum, and as Curator at the Chipstone Foundation. Personal life Glenn Adamson was born in 1972 and raised in Boston, Massachusetts along with his identical twin brother Peter Adamson. Glenn Adamson earned his B.A. in History of Art from Cornell University in 1994 and his PhD in Art History from Yale University in 2001. Adamson is currently based in Brooklyn, New York. Museum and curatorial work =Museum of Arts and Design= From 2013 to 2016 Glenn Adamson served as the Nanette L. Laitman Director of the Museum of Arts and Design in New York City, NY. Adamson's hire at the Museum of Arts and Design came as a somewhat surprise. Previously, Adamson had been a critic of the museum, using a 2011 review of the exhibition The Global Africa Project in the magazine Art in America to critique the institution itself. Adamson's critiques included the architecture of the museum's new building and their gallery layouts, the 2002 name change, and the \\"incoherent execution\\" of exhibitions. Holly Hotchner, director of the Museum of Arts and Design from 1996 to 2013, responded to Adamson's critiques in a letter to the editor of Art in America in 2011 where she defended many of the topics Adamson critiqued. In spite of this previous tension, the museum found Adamson to be the \\"most exciting candidate\\" when searching for Hotchner's replacement in 2013. In 2016, when Adamson stepped down from his post as Director at the Museum of Arts and Design, the museum stated: > \\"During his tenure, Dr. Adamson led the institution through a period of > significant growth of its programming and resources, and built a new > leadership team. Dr. Adamson spearheaded an exhibitions program that > explored and expanded MAD‚Äôs unique mission and role in the arts ecology of > New York and the nation, including NYC Makers: The MAD Biennial; Ralph > Pucci: The Art of the Mannequin; Pathmakers: Women in Art, Craft, and > Design, Midcentury and Today; Wendell Castle Remastered; Studio Job: MAD > HOUSE; and Voulkos: The Breakthrough Years. Dr. Adamson created the position > of Windgate Research Curator, in collaboration with the Bard Graduate > Center, to further enhance the scholarship of MAD‚Äôs publications and > exhibitions. He also expanded MAD‚Äôs noted artist-in-residence program by > engaging younger artists from traditionally under-represented communities, > through an initiative funded by a grant from the New York Community Trust.\\" =Victoria and Albert Museum= From 2005 to 2013 Glenn Adamson served as the Head of Research at the Victoria and Albert Museum. During his time there, Adamson published several books and essays, as well as co-curated the exhibition Postmodernism: Style and Subversion 1970-1990 along with Jane Pavitt. Adamson was also a key proponent in initiating the \\"Rapid Response Unit\\" of the V&A;, where contemporary objects like 3D printed guns and \\"pussy hats\\" are added to the museum's collection quickly in direct response to contemporary culture. =Chipstone Foundation= Glenn Adamson served as Curator for the Chipstone Foundation from 2000-2005. The Chipstone Foundation focuses on the study, preservation, and championing of American material culture with heavy emphases on the decorative arts. This mission can be seen reflected in Adamson's work there, where he curated such historically American focused exhibitions as Skin Deep: Three Masters of American Inlay and Tea Table Coffee Table. In addition to his curatorial work, Adamson also made regular contributions to the Chipstone's journals American Furniture and Ceramics in America. =Guest curatorial work= *2003 Industrial Strength Design: How Brooks Stevens Shaped Your World, Milwaukee Art Museum, Milwaukee, WI *2013 fix fix fix, Gallery SO, London, UK *2017 \\"Things of Beauty Growing‚Äù: British Studio Pottery (co-curated with Martina Droth and Simon Olding), Yale Center for British Art, New Haven, CT *2017 Static,Friedman Benda Gallery, New York City, NY *2017 Beazley Designs of the Year, Design Museum, London, UK *2018 Raw Design, Museum of Craft and Design, San Francisco, CA *2018 When Attitudes Becomes Chairs, Pizzuti Collection, Columbus, OH Selected publications =Books= *Fewer Better Things: The Hidden Wisdom of Objects (Bloomsbury, 2018) *The Invention of Craft (Bloomsbury, 2013) *The Craft Reader (Berg, 2010) *Thinking Through Craft (Berg, 2007) *Industrial Strength Design: How Brooks Stevens Shaped Your World (MIT Press, 2003) =Book collaborations= *Creating Ourselves: The Self in Art (Whitechapel Gallery, 2017) (co-authored with Frances Borzello, Nicholas Cullinan, and Amelia Jones) *Art in the Making: Artists and Their Materials from the Studio to Crowdsourcing (Thames & Hudson, 2016) (co-authored with Julia Bryan-Wilson) *Things of Beauty Growing: British Studio Pottery (Yale University Press, 2016) (co-edited with Martina Droth, and Simon Olding) *Peter Voulkos: The Breakthrough Years (Black Dog Publishing, 2016) (co-authored with Elissa Auther, Barbara Paris Gifford, Jim Melchert, Ruby Neri, Andrew Perchuk, and Jenni Sorkin) *Paul Evans: Crossing Boundaries and Crafting Modernism (Arnoldsche, 2014) (co-authored with Edward S.

When the ship is used operationally for rocket landings‚Äîno earlier than 2021, since that is when Blue Origin is planning to make the first orbital launch of the New Glenn rocket‚Äîit is expected that the rocket boosters will be recovered downrange of the launch site in the Atlantic Ocean via LPV while the hydrodynamically-stabilized ship is underway. The ship stabilization technology is designed to increase the likelihood of successful rocket recovery in rough seas, as well as helping to carry out launches on schedule. From 2004 to 2018, the ship was used in ferry service in Europe. History Stena Freighter, 2006 Stena Freighter was built by Societa Esercizio Cantieri of Viareggio, Italy, and completed in 2004 by Elektromehanika d.o.o. at Kraljevica Shipyard, Croatia, for Swedish operator Stena Line. The ship was initially laid down in February 1997 as the Stena Hispanica for the Stena Line, but on 5 May 1998 was renamed after the British Ministry of Defence (MoD) contracted with Stena for a long-term charter of the vessel for freight- carrying capacity to support the Joint Rapid Reaction Force. The ship was launched just four days later on 9 May. Societa Esercizio Cantieri had fallen into financial difficulties, and the contract for the ship was cancelled in 1998 due to delays in construction. At the time, work on the hull was complete and the ship 50 percent finished. The shipyard went bankrupt in 1999, and all work on the ship ceased. In 2002, \\"the incomplete vessel was purchased from a bankruptcy estate at auction by Stena Line\\" and renamed Stena Seafreighter. After months of additional financial and performance difficulties by several shipyards in Slovenia and Croatia in 2003, she was towed to Arsenale Shipyard in Venice, and then steamed under her own power to Kraljevica in Croatia for final completion. As a result of the delays, the ship \\"never sailed as a Royal Fleet Auxiliary\\" for the British MoD. The ship was renamed Stena Freighter and delivered to Stena Line in March 2004. Stena Freighter operated on a number of ferry routes including Gothenburg‚ÄìTravem√ºnde, Gothenburg‚ÄìKiel, and the Harwich‚ÄìRotterdam (Europoort) service. Stena confirmed the sale of the vessel on 30 August 2018, and in October Blue Origin, a U.S. launch service provider and space technology company owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, confirmed it was the purchaser. The vessel sailed to Florida and arrived at Pensacola later that month to commence a refit. In March 2017 Blue Origin had unveiled the concept of landing a rocket on a hydrodynamically-stabilized ship that was underway, but did not reveal which marine vessel would be used as the landing platform until October 2018. Future operations Launches of the New Glenn launch vehicle are planned to be made from Cape Canaveral Launch Complex 36, which was leased to Blue Origin in 2015. The first stage boosters of New Glenn are intended to be reusable, and will be recovered downrange in the Atlantic Ocean via LPV. The hydrodynamically-stabilized ship increases the likelihood of successful recovery in rough seas. Blue Origin plans to make the first orbital launch of New Glenn no earlier than 2021.

Their vertices represent supersingular elliptic curves over finite fields and their edges represent isogenies between curves. Definition and properties A supersingular isogeny graph is determined by choosing a large prime number p and a small prime number \\\\ell, and considering the class of all supersingular elliptic curves defined over the finite field \\\\mathbb{F}_{p^2}. There are approximately (p+1)/12 such curves, each two of which can be related by isogenies. The vertices in the supersingular isogeny graph represent these curves (or more concretely, their -invariants, elements of \\\\mathbb{F}_{p^2}) and the edges represent isogenies of degree \\\\ell between two curves. The supersingular isogeny graphs are \\\\ell+1-regular graphs, meaning that each vertex has exactly \\\\ell+1 neighbors. They were proven by Pizer to be Ramanujan graphs, graphs with optimal expansion properties for their degree. The proof is based on Pierre Deligne's proof of the Ramanujan‚ÄìPetersson conjecture. Cryptographic applications One proposal for a cryptographic hash function involves starting from a fixed vertex of a supersingular isogeny graph, using the bits of the binary representation of an input value to determine a sequence of edges to follow in a walk in the graph, and using the identity of the vertex reached at the end of the walk as the hash value for the input. The security of the proposed hashing scheme rests on the assumption that it is difficult to find paths in this graph that connect arbitrary pairs of vertices. It has also been proposed to use walks in two supersingular isogeny graphs with the same vertex set but different edge sets (defined using different choices of the \\\\ell parameter) to develop a key exchange primitive analogous to Diffie‚ÄìHellman key exchange, called supersingular isogeny key exchange. Additional cryptographic methods based on these graphs include signature schemes and public-key cryptography. They have been suggested as a form of post-quantum cryptography: , there are no known subexponential-time methods for breaking these schemes, even on quantum computers.

It took place from 1 to 8 April 1973. Background Meat prices began to rise in late 1972. The Consumer price index published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics attributed this price increase to poor weather conditions, which increased the price for grain and animal feed, rising domestic demand, and unusually high export demand for pork due to the dollar devaluation in mid-February. Meat prices had risen 5.4 percent in a month, poultry and fish 5 percent and all retail food prices 2.4 percent, and that all consumer prices had risen seven‚Äêtenths of one percent. Boycott The boycott rose out of small, local organizations of consumers across the country as prices for meat rose dramatically. These groups were primarily female led, as women traditionally bought the groceries for their households, and these groups grew both from people that only joined together around this issue and already existing women's and community groups. The boycott included both abstention from buying and cooking meat as well as active protests. The protest was observed by more women than men, as men continued to eat meat that was bought before the boycott took effect. Lasting effects According to some, the boycott was successful in lowering meat prices for a short period of time, although the New York Times reported that there was \\"no significant decline in meat prices.\\" That being said, in the Time Magazine cover story for April 9, 1973, the boycott was called, \\"the most successful boycott by women since Lysistrata,\\" and the public pressure pushed President Nixon to enforce price ceilings on beef, pork and lamb. The leaders supported continued boycotts of meat, specifically by refusing to cook or eat meat on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Ralph Nader wrote that consumers would become more aware of their ability to advocate for and control food policy. Others wrote that \\"housewife activism\\" and women's groups' power gained more recognition, and the boycott's primary lasting effect was as a \\"consciousness- raising experience\\".

It was added to the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 August 2012.  History  Marrickville Post Office was constructed by Messrs Graham and Mercer for ¬£2,197 and opened in April 1891.Warmington and Ward Its construction followed the late nineteenth century establishment or shift of the main business and commercial district of Marrickville to this area of the suburb, in turn following the construction of the tramline along Marrickville Road to Illawarra Road in 1881. The original building included a post office, residence and telegraph office. Extensive alterations were made to the rear single-storey portion in c.1960, and an addition was also built to the rear of this wing. The post office is now located towards the rear of the building and a caf√© occupies the original postal hall. Built in 1891, extensive alterations were made to the rear single-storey portion in c.1960.  Description  Marrickville Post Office is at 274A Marrickville Road, Marrickville, on the corner of Silver Street, comprising the whole of Lot 1 Section 2 DP1943 and Lot 1 DP780055. The site is on a flat and gently tapering. The building frontage to Marrickville Road is two-storied with loosely Renaissance articulation: pilasters on each side of a central doorway on the ground floor, two arched windows either side, and a reproduction of this pattern in the five first floor windows. The first floor was treated as an astylar piano nobile/attic. The pattern was inverted on the Silver Street side, facing northwest, where two entrances were placed at either end of the double- storeyed section's street front, with two bays containing a pair of arched windows placed between each entrance. A pilaster separates the two bays of windows. It is possible that the Silver Street elevation may not have been the side elevation as intended. The rear doorway is flanked by piers, rusticated on the upper level and treated as pilasters on the ground floor, in a distinctly separate bay. This may be an addition or alteration, but was possibly intended as the base of a corner tower. A rear tower placement was not usual in James Barnet designs, but nearby Leichhardt Post Office (1887-8), has a rear-sited tower along its major roadside elevation, rather than a corner tower at its main public entrance.Heritage, p. 2/39 The upper level to Silver Street therefore appears asymmetrically, as the extra bay adds on to a symmetrical five-window elevation. One of the Silver Street upper windows is blind, though with its full drip moulding and segmental arch, this may have been intended as a compositional counterbalance to the extra bay at the south end. All upper windows have partly aedicular treatment with segmentally curved stilted drip mouldings, accentuated keystones and a continuous sill that forms part of a ground floor-first floor entablature. The windows are generally double hung sashes. The roof is on a bracketed cornice, with sparsely and irregularly applied brackets in pairs, and in places, as a trio, which is geared to the varied window placements on the Marrickville Road and Silver Street elevations. A single storey extension was added to the rear (date unknown). This sustains the prominent entablature mouldings that run across the original facades, but much of its original fenestration and Classical detailing has been removed. The Silver Street elevation of this single-storey section now consists of a wide entrance with two plain pillars, creating a tripartite arrangement, and two small square windows. The internal timber stairs have been reconfigured. The stairs of the original two storey portion extend into part of the single-storey rear addition, and at the top of the stairs turned timber balustrading has been removed and replaced with a timber panel. In about 1994 the post office was transformed into a shared tenancy with an Australia Post retail area dominating one area and a caf√© the other.Post Office employee pers comm. 11 April 2008 Australia Post retained its operations in the single-storey building and upstairs it has a lunchroom, storeroom and toilets. The caf√© also leases two rooms upstairs for storage space. On the upper level much of the original fabric is intact and the original planning is still evident. The caf√© now occupies most of the ground floor of the two-storey portion of the building, which accommodates a dining area, kitchen and toilets. The two iron columns with Corinthian capitals in the ground floor caf√©, are believed to have been present when the space was a post office and are probably original. It was possibly around the time that the c.1994 works were completed that an addition was made to the south of the single-storey portion, covering what was formerly a yard. = Key areas/elements = * North (Marrickville Road) and east (Silver Street) elevations. * Former postal hall, including its iron columns. * Timber stair. = Condition = The building overall has a moderate level of intactness and a fair level of condition given changes in the program and the age of the building. = Original fabric = Original elements of the building include: * Structural frame: reinforced concrete footings (underpinned later). Timber flooring and roof frames, load-bearing brick walls. * External walls: rendered brick. * Internal walls: brick rendered in hard plaster and painted. Other walls are timber frame that are clad in plasterboard and painted. * Floor: timber framed. Polished timber within the caf√© tenancy. Carpeted to the retail area and the rear office flooring is vinyl. Vinyl tiled lunch room and storage areas; ceramic tiled wet areas. * Ceiling: acoustic ceiling tiles (caf√© area); in the retail space and back office it has a suspended ceiling with aluminium frame and inset acoustic tiles, flush fluorescent lighting mounts. Upstairs the ceilings are lath and plaster. * Roof: timber frame, clad in cement tile.  Heritage listing  Marrickville Post Office was listed on the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 August 2012 having satisfied the following criteria. Criterion A: Processes Marrickville Post Office of 1891, which originally incorporated a post office, telegraph office and residence, has been an important local postal building for almost 120 years. It helps demonstrate the establishment of this area as the main business and commercial focus of the suburb of Marrickville following the construction of the tramline along Marrickville Road in 1881. The post office is also one of the last designed under James Barnet's direction, before the arrival of Walter Vernon as new government architect. Criterion D: Characteristic values Marrickville Post Office is an example of: * a post office and telegraph office with quarters (second generation typology 1870-1929) * Italianate Style * the work of architect James Barnet Typologically, Marrickville Post Office is a medium- sized post office of the late nineteenth century that incorporated a post office and telegraph office with quarters. The building overall has a moderate level of intactness, including externally, with works concentrated towards the rear. More recently, Australia Post operations have also contracted in the building, with adaptation to caf√© use occurring. These works retained much of the first floor internal planning, with much of the original fabric intact in these spaces. The caf√© occupies most of the ground floor of the two-storey portion of the building, including using these spaces as a dining area, kitchen and toilets. Stylistically and architecturally, the building fits neatly into contemporary retail architecture on its Marrickville Road side, albeit assuming a more singular character on the Silver Street elevation (where it is thought a tower was originally intended). The post office is also a sedate building which reads more like a medium-sized bank branch than a post office, merging into the retail fabric of Marrickville Road. Nevertheless the building has a competent Italianate facade treatment, and a determined symmetry to the Marrickville Road elevation which is counteracted by a direct inversion of the window spacing and placements on the two Silver Street levels. This approach to corner design was unusual in the post offices of James Barnet. Criterion E: Aesthetic characteristics As noted under criterion D above, architecturally and stylistically, the exterior of the Marrickville Post Office fits neatly into contemporary retail architecture on its Marrickville Road side, albeit assuming a more singular character on the Silver Street elevation. Externally the building has retained much of its original character, including Italianate detailing, and is a significant historic corner-sited building within the Marrickville Road context. Criterion H: Significant people Marrickville Post Office is significant for its association with the prolific post office architect James Barnet, and is believed to be one of the last of the postal buildings designed under his direction, before the arrival of Walter Vernon as the new government architect.

The show was produced and scripted by the Mexican professional wrestling promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL: Spanish for \\"World Wrestling Council\\") and took place at Arena M√©xico in Mexico City, Mexico. The special edition of CMLL's Super Viernes show honored CMLL wrestler Negro Casas for reaching his 40th anniversary as a professional wrestler. While Negro Casas was honored at the show he did not wrestle in the main event, instead he teamed up with Atlantis and Blue Panther, defeating Fuerza Guerrera, Octag√≥n and El Solar in the fourth match of the night. In the semi-main event match Volador Jr. regained the NWA World Historic Welterweight Championship from Matt Taven. In the main event Los Lucha Bros (King Phoenix and Penta el 0M) teamed up with L.A. Park to defeat Rush and Ring of Honor representatives The Briscoe Brothers (Jay Briscoe and Mark Briscoe). The show featured three additional matches. Production =Background= Negro Casas, real name Jos√© Casas Ruiz, made his professional wrestling debut in the fall of 1978. Originally trained by his father Pepe Casas, Negro Casas would often team up with his brothers El Felino and Heavy Metal. He would later start a heated rivalry with El Hijo del Santo, a rivalry that led to Negro Casas losing a Lucha de Apuestas to El Hijo del Santo. The rivalry led to a long-term successful partnership between the two, winning the CMLL World Tag Team Championship three times. Casas lost another high-profile Lucha de Apuestas match to M√≠stico in the main event of the CMLL 76th Anniversary Show, one of the matches that helped cement M√≠stico as one of the top names in lucha libre. He later formed the group La Peste Negra, teaming with his brother El Felino and Mr. Niebla. Over the years Casas has won the CMLL World Tag Team championship a total of six times, CMLL World Middleweight Championship twice, CMLL World Trios Championship, CMLL World Welterweight Championship, Mexican National Trios Championship, NWA World Historic Welterweight Championship, and the NWA World Historic Welterweight Championship =Storylines= The event featured six professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Aftermath After the NWA World Historic Welterweight Championship loss Matt Taven turned \\"face\\" (good guy) when he saved Volador Jr. after he was attacked by Rush, together the two chased Rush from the ring. Over the subsequent weeks Volador Jr. and Matt Taven build a rivalry with Rush and his partner B√°rbaro Cavernario that became the main event of CMLL's biggest show of 2018, the CMLL 85th Anniversary Show. Rush and B√°rbaro Cavernario won the tag team Lucha de Apuestas, or bet match, when Taven attacked Volador Jr., forcing both Volador Jr. and Taven to be shaved bald as a result.

It was designed by the Government Architect‚Äôs Office under Walter Liberty Vernon. The property is owned by Australia Post, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 June 2004 and to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 22 December 2000.  History  Pyrmont Post Office, 1902 =History of Pyrmont= Pyrmont was isolated from early Sydney and initial development in the area was generally related to waterfront industries, such as shipyards. The establishment of the Australasian Steam Navigation Company shipyard on Darling Island, plus several other industrial enterprises, including Charles Saunders' stone quarry, brought a residential population of workers, though anyone of means tended to travel to the area from somewhere more desirable. The opening of the Pyrmont Bridge across Darling Harbour in the 1850s facilitated development in both industry and population. Several large businesses became established in Pyrmont in the late nineteenth century, including Colonial Sugar Refinery (CSR) and the woolstores began to move here during the 1880s. A new bridge in 1901, the opening of the power stations (Ultimo Power Station in 1899 and Pyrmont Power Station in 1904) and the extension of wharfage around the waterfront from Darling Harbour cemented the industrial character of the peninsula and it remained this way until after the end of World War II. With only a few notable exceptions, residential development remained largely working class and in fact progressively reduced in size as the new industries demolished housing to accommodate larger premises. After World War II, though, most of the characterising industries either ceased operating or moved to other locations. Since the 1970s, redevelopment of the area has moved slowly, with numerous schemes and proposals. Many of the industrial buildings have been demolished or converted to other uses. = Australian postal history = The first official postal service in Australia was established in April 1809, when the Sydney merchant Isaac Nichols was appointed as the first Postmaster in the colony of NSW. Prior to this, mail had been distributed directly by the captain of the ship on which the mail arrived, however this system was neither reliable nor secure. In 1825 the colonial administration was empowered to establish a Postmaster General's Department, which had previously been administered from Britain. In 1828 the first post offices outside of Sydney were established, with offices in Bathurst, Campbelltown, Parramatta, Liverpool, Newcastle, Penrith and Windsor. By 1839 there were forty post offices in the colony, with more opened as settlement spread. During the 1860s, the advance of postal services was further increased as the railway network began to be established throughout NSW. In 1863, the Postmaster General WH Christie noted that accommodation facilities for Postmasters in some post offices was quite limited, and stated that it was a matter of importance that \\"post masters should reside and sleep under the same roof as the office\\". The first telegraph line was opened in Victoria in March 1854 and in NSW in 1858. The NSW colonial government constructed two lines from the GPO, one to the South Head Signal Station, the other to Liverpool. Development was slow in NSW compared to the other states, with the Government concentrating on the development of country offices before suburban ones. As the line spread, however, telegraph offices were built to accommodate the operators. Unlike the Post Office, the telegraph office needed specialised equipment and could not be easily accommodated in a local store or private residence. Post and telegraph offices operated separately until 1870 when the departments were amalgamated, after which time new offices were built to include both postal and telegraph services. In 1881 the first telephone exchange was opened in Sydney, three years after the first tests in Adelaide. As with the telegraph, the telephone system soon began to extend into country areas, with telephone exchanges appearing in country NSW from the late 1880s onwards. Again the Post Office was responsible for the public telephone exchange, further emphasising its place in the community as a provider of communications services. The appointment of James Barnet as Acting Colonial Architect in 1862 coincided with a considerable increase in funding to the public works program. Between 1865 and 1890 the Colonial Architects Office was responsible for the building and maintenance of 169 Post Offices and telegraph offices in NSW. The post offices constructed during this period featured in a variety of architectural styles, as Barnet argued that the local parliamentary representatives always preferred \\"different patterns\\". The construction of new post offices continued throughout the Depression years under the leadership of Walter Liberty Vernon, who held office from 1890 to 1911. While twenty-seven post offices were built between 1892 and 1895, funding to the Government Architect's Office was cut from 1893 to 1895, causing Vernon to postpone a number of projects. Following Federation in 1901, the Commonwealth Government took over responsibility for post, telegraph and telephone offices, with the Department of Home Affairs Works Division being made responsible for post office construction. In 1916 construction was transferred to the Department of Works and Railways, with the Department of the Interior responsible during World War II. On 22 December 1975 the Postmaster General's Department was abolished and replaced by the Post and Telecommunications Department. This was the creation of Telecom and Australia Post. In 1989, the Australian Postal Corporation Act established Australia Post as a self-funding entity, heralding a new direction in property management, including a move away from the larger more traditional buildings towards smaller shop front style post offices. For much of its history, the post office has been responsible for a wide variety of community services including mail distribution, an agency for the Commonwealth Savings Bank, electoral enrolments, and the provision of telegraph and telephone services. The town post office has served as a focal point for the community, most often built in a prominent position in the centre of town close to other public buildings, creating a nucleus of civic buildings and community pride. = Pyrmont Post Office = The first Post Office in Pyrmont was opened in April 1852 as a sub-office, receiving and delivering letters within the rapidly growing Pyrmont/Ultimo area. The first subdivisions of land within Pyrmont had been held in December 1839, with most of the lots having been sold and developed by 1843. By the early 1850s a number of major developments were beginning to transform the Pyrmont peninsula as large-scale industry sought to established itself there. Industries such as shipbuilding and quarrying attracted workers to settle in the area who in turn encouraged the growth of infrastructure. In 1858 the Pyrmont Bridge was constructed, linking the peninsula to the town of Sydney, further encouraging the development of Pyrmont. From 1 July 1871, money orders became available from Pyrmont Post Office, with a branch of the Government Savings Bank opening from October 1871. The introduction of money orders and Government Savings Banks into Pyrmont indicates that by this time the Post Office had been upgraded from a sub-branch to an official office. With an increase in the population of the area throughout the 1870s and 1880s, local residents began to petition for a new Post and Telegraph Office for Pyrmont. Pyrmont did not have a telegraph office as all telegraphs were delivered via the GPO in Sydney. By the early 1880s approximately 1000 telegrams per week were being delivered to the Pyrmont/Ultimo area, underlining the need for a telegraph office. A temporary post office existed for some years in Harris Street before the local Member of the Legislative Assembly, Francis Abigail, requested a more substantial facility in 1882. Premises were rented from Francis Buckle in Union Street and Frederick Lassre was appointed postmaster, a position he held until his death in 1905. In July 1882 the Post Master General advertised for tenders to lease a new building in Pyrmont for use as a Post and Telegraph Office. Following the advertisement, a number of sites along the peninsula were reviewed with the majority being based around Harris and Union Streets. Of the applicants, seven were eventually shortlisted, with an eight-room shop/residence in Union Street close to the junction of Harris Street being leased from Mr F Buckler for ¬£100pa. In contrast to post offices in other districts, Pyrmont Post Office had two long-term postal officers in its founding years. The first Postmistress, Elizabeth Fleming, served in Pyrmont from 1853 until 1881, after which her son Charles Fleming continued as Postmaster from 1881 until 1896. It was common during this period for postmistresses or postmasters to leave the job due to its poor pay and demanding nature, particularly when an office was still a sub-branch or unofficial office. Many had other jobs, running the postal business from a store or inn that they may also have operated. Pressure to build an official office was again placed on the Post Master General by Pyrmont residents during the 1890s, and by 1899 a site for a new office had been secured. The new office was designed by New South Wales Government Architect Walter Liberty Vernon and built by day labour at a cost of . The Minister for Public Works, Edward William O'Sullivan, officially opened it on 19 January 1901. The office was built using surplus Pyrmont sandstone from the construction of the General Post Office (GPO) and Customs House buildings. The office was two storeys with a basement. The basement originally held the kitchen, dining room, laundry and bathroom, the ground floor housed the main office space and one bedroom, with three more bedrooms on the first floor. It continued to function as the post office for Pyrmont for many years and remains a key part of the civic centre. Renovations were carried out on the building during the 1950s when the original entry door was relocated to the western end of the building and Post Boxes were installed. In December 2009, the post office building became the Pyrmont Community Branch of the Bendigo Bank.  Description  Pyrmont Post Office is located in a prominent position at 148 Harris Street, corner Union Street, Pyrmont, fronting onto Union Square. It was built in 1901 in the Federation Free Style, and is a two- storey, rock-faced, ashlar block building with a basement. The two-storey section of the building has a complex hipped, Marseille tiled roof sited behind a gable-ended parapet on Harris Street that continues straight across the truncated corner of the building and steps down to the rear. The lower skillion sections of roof are clad with corrugated iron. Three rock-faced sandstone chimneys punctuate the roofline, one at each roof level stepping down towards the rear. The Union Street facade faces the splayed corner of the block and has a massive ground floor entry arch. Over the arch is a dressed and moulded stone archivolt ending in rosettes. On either side is a small sash window. Above the arch, on the first floor, is a balcony with two columns. Above this is a stone cornice supported by scrolls and then there is a parapet which steps down behind where the post office abuts the bank next door. There is a string course between the floors. On the Harris Street elevation the ground floor is dominated by two Diocletian windows with dressed and moulded archivolts. The first floor has four sash windows, which like all the windows feature multiple panes in the upper half or upper sash. The parapeted gable has a round vent and the gable ends in a scroll. The basement was originally part of the living quarters of the postmaster. The Diocletian windows, the parapeted gable with scroll, the contrast between rough and smooth stonework and the use of multiple panes in the upper sashes are all features of Federation Free Style design, of which Vernon was a notable practitioner. The building is a prominent one, fronting onto Pyrmont Square and its scale and materials assist the cohesiveness of this central precinct. There is a continuous dentilled string course below the parapet, as well as carved coping, and a shaped stone string course below the first floor. Each street facade is symmetrical and label moulds decorate the ground-floor arched windows of the Harris Street facade and the wide ground-floor arch of the main entry porch. It is a smooth archway with carved label mould ends. Some of the smaller squared windows have thick stone lintels and all the window frames have been painted white. There is a first-floor balcony on the symmetrical, truncated corner of the building. The sandstone balustrade has rounded coping, supporting two thick sandstone columns. It has a v-joint boarded soffit, green painted concrete floor and a single pendant light at the centre. The ground- floor entry porch is housed behind the entry arch, and has a boarded soffit with a moulded cornice and attached fluorescent lighting. The floor has modern red tiles and there is a four-panelled early door to the right and a modern timber and glass door to the left, serving as the retail entry. The basement level has two concrete porches positioned on either side of the former laundry at the rear. Timber posts sit on concrete pedestals and support the skillion roof with a boarded soffit and attached fluorescent lights. The basement level of Pyrmont Post Office remains divided in half as per the original construction of the building, keeping the residence and post office facilities separate. The flooring of the entire basement level is sheet vinyl, excepting the modern tiled bathrooms of the post office area. The post office half of the building has been substantially modified from early plans and currently houses staff facilities including toilets and a lunch room. The residential half to the rear of the building comprises a kitchen, dining room, laundry (not inspected) and store room. Ceilings in the basement of the residence are square set plaster with intrusive, attached fluorescent lighting. The post office side of the basement level has a combination of fibre cement ceilings and square set plaster. Walls of the entire basement level are predominantly rendered and painted masonry in a cream colour scheme, with blind arches adjacent to the two retained fireplaces of the residence. The residence retains a high picture rail in the former dining room, with a cut render dado rail to the rest of the rooms, excepting the small store room. Wide moulded skirtings and architraves appear to be original or early. The Post Office side has later skirting along with a modern fitout, with some original or early architraves retained to the window and external door. Windows to the residence basement are generally nine pane upper and single pane lower timber sash windows with some modifications from air conditioner/exhaust fan installations. Internal doors are four and six panelled, two original doors in the east walls of the kitchen and dining room have been removed. There is a single fanlight over the southern dining room door and the adjacent external door. The Post Office basement level has a squared multi-pane window and a louvred window to the male toilet. Doors to this area are modern flush doors. The ground floor of the Post Office comprises the retail area at the front. There is a small mail room/post box area behind the counter and an office and store room within the former residence space on the next level up, accessed via the main stair and a later constructed stair at the north. There is a small area of sheet vinyl at the front staff entry to the right of the entry porch. The ceilings on the ground floor are a combination of square set plaster in the office and adjacent store room, shallow vaulted corrugated iron and concrete in the safe room and set plaster with a moulded cornice and exposed beams in the retail area. There are both suspended and attached fluorescent lights located on the ground floor, as well as an attached air conditioning unit on the ceiling of the retail area. Architraves are largely original, with some modern architraves to later and altered openings. There is also some minor damage to some detailing through later modification. Some original skirting has been retained, excepting the modern fitout in the retail area. The retail area and office have modern sliding doors, as well as retaining some original or early six panel internal doors. Windows in the front facades include multi-pane, arched windows with casement lower panes, and four to nine pane upper and single lower pane squared sash windows. There are fanlights retained over the internal doors to the office and adjacent store room. The ground-floor walls are painted and rendered masonry in a pastel pink and grey colour scheme. The retail area has a standard Australia Post fitout incorporating a grey colour scheme and some partition walls forming the retail counter area. Three chimney breasts have been retained in the ground floor and a surround has been retained in the office, however the rest are currently concealed behind wall panelling. The first floor is currently vacant, previously in use as the postal residence. It comprises three carpeted bedrooms, a sheet vinyl floored s fitout bathroom and timber- floored storage room. Square set plaster ceilings, with some cracking evident, are located on the first floor with pendant light fittings excepting the fluorescent light to the store room. Architraves and skirting appear to be original or early, excepting the s bathroom fitout and tiling. There is a cut dado rail in the bathroom. The first floor retains four and six panel original or early doors. Windows are predominantly nine pane upper and single pane lower sash squared windows and there are fanlights located over all internal doorways excepting the bathroom. The walls of this level are painted and rendered masonry in a pastel pink colour scheme with grey and white detailing. Two fireplaces have been retained in the first floor with cast iron basket grates, tiled inserts and timber surrounds. There are two stairs accessing the various levels of the building. The original carpeted main stair on the southern side accesses all three levels of the former residence and joins with the Post Office side at the ground floor. It has polished, painted, and turned timber posts and balusters, carved brackets and original or early skirting. The original flight of stairs accessing the basement level of the Post Office matches the main stair, with sheet vinyl treads. Signage on the Post Office is limited to the verdigris brass lettering \\"Pyrmont Post Office\\" above the first floor string course, a standard \\"Australia Post\\" sign attached to the right side of the Harris Street facade and smaller location and information signs located within the ground-floor porch area. The surrounding streetscape of Pyrmont Post Office is predominantly two to three-storey nineteenth to early- twentieth century mixed-use buildings, with Star City Casino dominating the roofscape to the rear of the site. The building fronts onto the paved and terraced Union Square, which retains several trees and recent flower plantings. There is a war memorial near the front of the building within the Square and seating and public phones have been provided. There are also recent street tree plantings along Harris Street. The only outbuilding within the site is a small recent metal shed located at the centre and to the rear boundary of the site. It is located within the bitumen paved rear yard, which is enclosed by a tubular steel and corrugated iron fence. Access to the yard is via a narrow passageway along the northern boundary stepping down from Harris Street through a security gate. = Condition = As at 1996, the building was still in use as a post office and is in good condition, with a high level of integrity. The entrance was slightly altered in the 1950s. As at 4 August 2000, the building was generally in very good condition, with particular reference to the exterior. The archaeological potential of the site is considered high for evidence of early uses of the site. Pyrmont Post Office is substantially intact to its original form. It retains the features that make it culturally significant, including details such as the sandstone exteriors, large round arched entrance and stone parapet and gable, as well as its overall form and style. = Modifications and dates = Pyrmont Post Office, as it stands today, was completed in 1901. It is a two-storey sandstone building with basement, providing a Post Office area to the front half of the building and three-storey residence to the rear half. In the original front entry was altered with the rearrangement of the interior ground floor. Post boxes were installed in their current locations and the current entry door replaced an existing telephone booth. This is possibly when the reconfiguration of the Post Office basement section also occurred. = Further information = Physical condition and/or Archaeological potential - The building is generally in very good condition, with particular reference to the exterior. There has, however, been substantial moisture damage to paintwork and some plaster. This has occurred within several ceilings and walls, particularly to the first floor and the underside of the main stair, with paint peeling in the basement level. All levels show evidence of general wear and tear. The archaeological potential of the site is considered high for evidence of early uses of the site or previous structures, with the open rear yard currently paved in bitumen and little evidence of other works within the site boundary since first construction.  Heritage listing  Pyrmont Post Office, dating from 1901, has historical importance for its association with the development of Pyrmont/Ultimo which, by the turn of the century, was a key industrial and warehouse suburb of inner Sydney. The construction of a permanent postal building, at the time, illustrates the consolidation of the peninsula's infrastructure during the period. Sited prominently on a major intersection fronting onto Pyrmont Square and complementing other buildings nearby, the post office is an important element in the streetscape. As at 4 August 2000, Pyrmont Post Office is significant at a State level for its historical associations, strong aesthetic qualities and social value. Pyrmont Post Office is linked with the original post office established in 1852, and as such is associated with the early development of the Pyrmont/Ultimo area. Pyrmont Post Office is historically significant because it is associated with the population growth in the area during the late nineteenth century, which was the result of its development as a key industrial and warehouse suburb in Sydney. The Post Office was also an important part of the consolidation of communications services to the Pyrmont/Ultimo community. The building has a history of continuous original use that spans almost a century. The unusual architectural footprint of the building reflects the difficulty with designing and constructing new buildings in already well-established suburbs in Sydney. Pyrmont Post Office also provides evidence of the development of workers' conditions in NSW, particularly with regard to the level of self-containment of the residence. Pyrmont Post Office is aesthetically significant because it is a distinctive example of the Federation Free Style of architecture, and makes an important contribution to Pyrmont's historic civic precinct. The architectural style and prominent location of the post office also make it a local landmark. Pyrmont Post Office is also associated with the NSW Government Architect's Office under Walter Liberty Vernon, a key practitioner of the Federation Free Style of architecture. Pyrmont Post Office is also considered to be significant to the community of Pyrmont's sense of place. =Australian Commonwealth Heritage List= Pyrmont Post Office was listed on the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 June 2004 having satisfied the following criteria. Criterion D: Characteristic values The building, with its Diocletian and other windows, its contrasting finishes to stonework, its parapeted gable with scroll and other features reflects well the characteristics of Federation Free style architecture. Criterion H: Significant people Additional significance is attributable to the fact that the building was designed by New South Wales (NSW) Government Architect, W. L. Vernon. =New South Wales State Heritage Register= Pyrmont Post Office was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 22 December 2000 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Pyrmont Post Office is associated with the early development of the area, as it is linked with the original post office established in 1852. The construction of a new, larger building in 1901 reflects the development of the area as a key industrial and warehouse suburb of Sydney, which resulted in the growth of the local population during the end of the nineteenth century. The growing community required improved services, and lobbied for a new post office. The Post Office was also an important part of the consolidation of communications services to the Pyrmont/Ultimo community. The building has a history of continuous original use that spans almost a century. Pyrmont Post Office provides evidence of the development of workers' conditions in NSW, particularly with regard to the level of self-containment of the residence. The residence at Pyrmont included the laundry and kitchen, which differs from post offices constructed up to the 1880s. These facilities were previously housed separately from the main building and added later. The unusual architectural footprint of the building reflects the difficulty with designing and constructing new buildings in well-established suburbs in Sydney. Pyrmont Post Office was designed by the NSW Government Architect's Office under Walter Liberty Vernon, a key practitioner of the Federation Free Style of architecture. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Pyrmont Post Office is aesthetically significant because it is a distinctive example of the Federation Free Style of architecture in NSW. Constructed predominantly of sandstone, Pyrmont Post Office is a visually pleasing element in the historic civic precinct of Pyrmont. The use of stone as a walling material is comparable with earlier post office designs at Cooma (1879) and Wilcannia (1880), and its design compares with Burwood Post Office (1892). Located in the Pyrmont Square Group, the Post Office forms part of a significant late Victorian and Federation period streetscape, which is the focal point of the Pyrmont urban area. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Pyrmont Post Office was constructed after the local community lobbied the Post Master General for improved services to the area. It has also been the centre of communications in Pyrmont for almost a century, and is an important part of the civic precinct. As such, it is considered to be significant to the Pyrmont community's sense of place. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Pyrmont Post Office has some potential to provide archaeological information about the previous use of the site. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Pyrmont Post Office is a largely intact as per its original form, which is rare for post offices in NSW. The unusual architectural footprint of the building adds to its rarity. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Pyrmont Post Office is a strong example of the Federation Free style of architecture. It is part of a group of post offices designed by the NSW Government Architect Office under Walter Liberty Vernon.

The campaign got ugly pretty fast. During the campaign Thompson made many appeals to nativism. One such example was his appeal to antisemitism by villainization of Jewish businessman Julius Rosenwald. In one speech delivered in March he said of Rosenwald, \\"Well, we got a great philanthropist in this town, and he's a Jew, and he's trying to edge his way out of hell by giving part of the money he steals.\\"Mackerels in the Moonlight: Four Corrupt American Mayors By Gerald Leinwand (page 63) Since Cermak was an immigrant from Bohemia, Thompson lodged ethnic attacks : I won't take a back seat to that Bohunk, Chairmock, Chermack or whatever his name is. : Tony, Tony, where's your pushcart at? : Can you picture a World's Fair mayor with a name like that? Cermak was able to respond effectively to these attacks, \\"He doesn't like my name...It's true I didn't come over on the Mayflower, but I came over as soon as I could,\\" which was a sentiment to which ethnic Chicagoans could relate, so Thompson's slurs largely backfired.Wendt, Lloyd (1979).

JSTOR The newspapers also covered allegations that Samuel Insull had contributed money to Thompson's campaign. The Tribune wrote, \\"When the traction case was settled during Thompson's third term Insull was given a perpetual franchise that could not be terminated even for misuse non use or mal use\\". Gossip of Thompson's ties to Al Capone gained new strength after one of Thompson's top city officials, also a friend of Capone, was indicted for conspiring with merchants to use short weights to cheat $54 million. Thompson accused Cermak of being in cahoots with bootleggers and gamblers, and accused Cermak of having profited from misconduct alleging that he had, \\"saved six million out of a $10,000 salary.\\" The election took place amid the Great Depression. The Depression, taking place under the administration of Republican president Herbert Hoover, may have ultimately contributed to Thompson's defeat. For the election, Cermak had managed to overhaul his public image. Long viewed as a political infighter, Cermak rebranded himself as a \\"master executive\\" who would be able to help the city of Chicago survive the Great Depression. =Results= Voter turnout was remarkably high, with 82% of registered voters participating. Cermak carried 45 wards, while Thompson carried five. The five wards that Thompson carried all had sizable black populations. Thompson carried only five of the city's fifty wards.

She was known for her roles as heroine, main parts in salon dramas and later her mother parts. Biography She was one of eight children of the actor Bernard Jakob Frey (1784‚Äì1836) and the actress Elisabeth Frey and the sister of August Johann Frey (1829‚Äì1897). She married the actor Friedrich Frey (1824‚Äì1892) in 1854. She made her debut as a child in her father's theater company in Graz. In 1831‚Äì33 she was active in Brno, in 1833‚Äì34 in Vienna, and 1834, she was engaged in the Estates Theatre in Prague. She was a celebrated leading lady in the roles of sentimental heroine in romantic dramas and tragedies of the theatre and was often given the main female parts, but she also frequently played boys in breeches roles. She was praised for her memorizing technique and was also able to sing, though she preferred to act in drama and avoided prominent roles as a singer. She performed exclusively in the German language. She was ranked among the highest paid actors of the theatre alongside Ferdinand Polawsky, Margarethe Binder, Franz Feistmantel and Franz Rudolf Bayer, and in the 1840s, she was the highest paid woman actor in Prague. She supported her mother and her siblings on her salary after the death of her father in 1836. Despite the low social status of an actor in the 19th century, Marie Magdalena Frey enjoyed respect also as a private person and was noted to socialize with the noble families in Prague, which was unusual for an actress of her time. She was respected also in Austria and Germany, where she made several guest appearances to assist her mother and siblings financially. Aside from her acting, she was also engaged to recite on festivities and celebrations, such as on the visit of the emperor in June 1854. Her most celebrated role was reportedly the title role of Deborah Mosenthalovƒõ. From the 1850s, she progressed to roles as socialites and mother, and became particularly popular in the roles of dignified mother figures. From 1854, she was allowed to take out her pension allowance, but she continued to act. In 1864, she was celebrated for her thirty years onstage. She belonged to the most noted actors in 19th-century Bohemia.

Founded by sisters Trilby and Julia Yates, it operated from the 1920s to the 1950s. Along with Ninette Gowns and Bobby Angus, it is considered one of the founders of New Zealand fashion design. The careers of designers Nancy Hudson and Hall Ludlow began at the label, and it is credited with introducing New Zealanders to trousers as fashionable wear for women.  Founding  The Auckland Town Hall, . The row of shops to the left would later become the first premises of Trilby Yates. The label was founded by sisters Trilby and Julia Yates in the mid-1920s. Trilby, who was the older by nine years, had trained as a milliner at The Bon March√©, an emporium founded in Auckland in 1904. By 1923, the business was operating as a hat shop opposite the Auckland Town Hall at 374 Queen Street, under the name \\"Trilby Yates: the Ladies' Paradise\\". Trilby was a skilled milliner, described as being able to \\"take a tea towel and make a hat out of it\\". Julia, by contrast, could barely sew, but had business skills and connections with artistic friends such as the dancer Freda Stark and the filmmaker Robert Steele.  High-fashion advancements  Around 1930, the shop moved to 179 Queen Street, Auckland, a more prestigious location with two streetfront windows. Julia's niece Ata Yates, who started in the Trilby Yates workroom in 1946, recalled the shop's exotic Oriental d√©cor: > \\"In one window there would be fresh flowers and in the other a mannequin > dressed in something striking. The rest of the clothes were out of sight in > wardrobes. The store was dark red and shadowy ‚Äî you'd have to be brave to go > in if you were an ordinary person.\\" In 1933 Trilby died young, and her daughter Digsy was cared for and later adopted by Julia. In the early 1930s, Julia changed the focus of the shop to high fashion and bespoke womenswear. She hired 22-year-old designer Nancy Hudson, a graduate of the Elam School of Fine Arts who was designing made-to- order garments for the dressmaker Alice Thomas. Julia travelled overseas regularly in the 1930s to Paris and New York, bringing back expensive fabrics and ideas such as branded shopping bags to replace boxes. On one trip she was fascinated to see women wearing trousers \\"√† la Dietrich\\"; her early 1930s display of women's trousers she later created in the Auckland salon sparked an uproar and a \\"Current Controversies\\" column in the New Zealand Woman's Weekly. Julia claimed to be the first woman in New Zealand to wear trousers, which by 1940 she did almost exclusively. She recalled being spat upon on Queen Street for wearing trousers, saying it was one of the most frightening experiences of her life.179 Queen Street, which from around 1930 to the early 1950s was the storefront of the company. The workroom at 26 Durham Street West, the street to the right, has not survived. The designs of Nancy Hudson made the label very successful in the 1940s, aided by US servicemen stationed in New Zealand purchasing clothes for their girlfriends. As Julia put it, \\"as soon as we saw a Yankee uniform walking through the door, we were sure of a sale.\\" The store was redecorated in pink and cream with sliding-mirror cabinets; garments were made in a nearby workroom, on the second floor of 26 Durham St West, which was connected to the shop floor by an intercom. Julia held a winter and spring 'opening' each year. These were major events, as former Trilby Yates designer Kate Lambourne recalled: > \\"I was pushed aside and all but stepped on. Women in full bling fighting > over a garment ‚Äì and in one case a dress was torn apart. Julia would watch > from her office chuckling away at the behaviour downstairs.\\"  Post-war years  Trilby Yates was the starting place for many designers, such as Hall Ludlow, who joined in 1945. Julia claimed Ludlow was \\"the first man in the country to make dresses\\". Nancy Hudson left Trilby Yates in the late 1940s to work in Australia, and was replaced by June Gould ( Todd), and then Maxine Sigglecoe. By the 1950s, Digsy Yates was a cutter and designer; when she left to get married, Julia retired. The business closed in the early 1950s, and staff found work at Emma Knuckey Gowns or Violet Gowns. Ata Yates started a dressmaking business in Te Awamutu. Digsy kept working as a dressmaker into the 1970s with her daughter, who was also named Trilby. Julia travelled the world extensively, and died in her 90s.

It has been protected by the central government as a National Historic Site since 1979. Overview The site is located at the eastern end of Toyama Bay on the right bank of the delta of the Kurobe River. Discovered in 1941, full-scale archaeological investigation did not begin until the 1970s. In total, the remains of 21 buildings were confirmed, with an estimated age from the 9th to the 10th centuries. The buildings were reconstructed at least six times during this period. The buildings were arranged in a U-shape around a large main building, which is presumed to be the manor house of a sh≈çen. Artefacts discovered included Sue ware and Suzu ware pottery shards, wooden note tags, glazed pottery shards and fragments of agricultural implements. From historical records, and the discovery of shards of Chinese blue and white celadon porcelain also found at the site, it is believed that this sh≈çen was part of the estates held by either the temple of T≈çdai-ji or of Saidai-ji in Nara. The site has been excavated 17 times since 1970, so the complete area is now clear. Its is one of the few manor sites from the Heian period thus found in Japan. A stream with a width of 30 meters once flowed from the south to the north through the site, with the building complex surrounded by walls on the west bank. The site is now a public archaeological park, which has been open to the public since April 1990, with concrete pillars marking the locations of foundation posts.

The massacre was described as having been of a particularly brutal nature and its leader, Lieutenant Wolfgang Lehnigk-Emden, was soon after captured by Allied forces. Lehnigk- Emden confessed to part of the crime but was later accidentally released and, for the next four decades, was not put on trial. In 1994 an Italian court sentenced Lehnigk-Emden and a non-commissioned officer of the division, Kurt Schuster, to life imprisonment in absentia, but neither was extradited by Germany. Lehnigk-Emden was also put on trial in Germany in a case that went to the high court, the Bundesgerichtshof; he was found guilty but released as the statute of limitations had expired. This caused considerable outrage in both Germany and Italy because of the particularly brutal nature of the crime. Massacre On 13 October 1943, the day Italy declared war on Nazi Germany, German forces were retreating from the area around the Volturno river. At Monte Carmignano the 3rd Company of the 29th Panzergrenadier regiment had been taking defensive positions, part of the Volturno Line, and were under threat by advancing American forces. The German units in the area feared attacks by local partisans and reacted with violence, resulting in the execution of 33 local civilians in the period between 2 and 13 October, the worst of those incidents being the Caiazzo massacre. In the evening Lehnigk-Emden spotted what he perceived to be secret signals from a large farmhouse nearby the advancing Americans. Lehnigk-Emden, who was not particularly well-respected by his soldiers, entered the farmhouse with a few of them to find 22 peasants from four different families hiding there from the anticipated fighting. His company commander, Draschke, ordered the execution of the four heads of the families. This order was carried out, as well as the shooting of three women who tried to prevent the German soldiers from doing so. Lehnigk-Emden confessed during captivity that he was part of this execution commando, whose deed was classified as manslaughter by the German courts. Following this, Lehnigk-Emden and two sergeants, one of them Kurt Schuster, returned to the farmhouse where the remaining 15 women and children were hiding. They threw hand grenades through the window and shot and bayoneted survivors trying to escape. Wilhelm May, a German soldier who was not involved in the second part of the massacre, later testified as a witness to the events that women and children were brutally murdered. Aftermath =Capture and escape= Lehnigk-Emden and members of his company were captured by American forces on 4 November 1943 and immediately questioned about the massacre by German-born journalist Hans Habe. At an interview in a prisoner-of-war camp in Aversa, Italy, Lehnigk-Emden confessed to having participated in the first part of the massacre, but denied his involvement in the second part. In 1944, while a prisoner of war in a special camp for war criminals in Algeria, Lehnigk-Emden showed no remorse for his actions but instead told another German POW that, had he known he was going to be jailed for his actions, he would have killed more. He attempted escape but was wounded and, eventually, taken to Europe on a British hospital ship. He was accidentally discharged in G√∂ttingen. =Post- war life= In post-war Germany, Lehnigk-Emden worked as an architect and lived, from 1950, in Ochtendung, near Koblenz. He was considered a good citizen and active in the local carnival club. He joined the Social Democratic Party of Germany. He and his family took holidays in northern Italy but he never mentioned the events of Caiazzo. After the court cases, Lehnigk-Emden continued to live in Ochtendung, where his grandchildren were active in events organised with the twinning of Caiazzo and Ochtendung. =Search= At the time of his discharge from captivity, Allied authorities were already trying to track down Lehnigk-Emden, as he was meant to appear at an inquiry into the massacre. However, they were searching for the wrong name, Wolfgang Lemick. The error was made by an US Army clerk. In 1969, Simon Wiesenthal made an attempt to find Lehnigk-Emden, seeking information from the relevant German authorities in Ludwigsburg. He was unsuccessful as he had been given an incorrect name, searching for Lemick Emden. The state prosecutor in Munich also investigated the matter but, like Wiesenthal, searched under the wrong name. In 1988, Giuseppe Agnone, a resident of Caiazzo who had emigrated to the United States, searched the relevant documents, now declassified, in the United States National Archives and was successful in identifying Lehnigk- Emden's correct name. He forwarded this information to Interpol. Shortly before his 70th birthday, on 15 October 1992, Lehnigk-Emden was arrested at his home by the German police. =Trials= Italy In 1946, the documents relating to the inquiry into the massacre were handed over to Italian authorities but, like so many, the files were placed in the Palazzo Cesi-Gaddi war crimes archive and only rediscovered in 1994. In 1991 the Public Prosecutor's Office in Santa Maria Capua Vetere opened an investigation at about the same time authorities in Germany began investigating the case. On 25 October 1994, the court in Santa Maria Capua Vetere sentenced Schuster and Lehnigk-Emden to life in prison in absentia but neither was extradited or served any time. Germany In 1993, Lehnigk-Emden was put on trial at the state court of Koblenz for the murder of fifteen civilians, as the court classified the killing of the remaining seven as manslaughter. The court in Koblenz eventually dismissed the charges on 18 January 1994 on the grounds that the statute of limitations had expired, and declined to extradite Lehnigk-Emden. The case progressed as far as the German high court, the Bundesgerichtshof, which confirmed the ruling of the court in Koblenz and let Lehnigk-Emden go free. At the same time, the ruling judge stated that the crime was so terrible it would even have resulted in a conviction in a Nazi court. Germany abolished its statute of limitations laws for murder in 1969, but the case had been tried under the old laws. Commemoration The massacre remains strong in the mind of the community of Caiazzo. Flowers are regularly laid at the scene and schoolchildren are told about it from a young age. However, the local priest at the time, Don Gerardo Fava, stated in 1993 that the community did not seek revenge, only justice. In 1995, Lehnigk-Emden apologized for his actions, blaming them on the chaotic situation near the front lines and his youth and inexperience. This apology was not accepted by Nicola Sorbo, the mayor of Caiazzo, who suggested that if Lehnigk-Emden was sincere in his repentance, he would return to Italy to face the courts. Lehnigk-Emden's hometown, Ochtendung, was branded as a \\"Nazi village\\", but, in 1995, entered a town twinning agreement with Caiazzo, which had been suggested by the latter. In December 2017, it was announced that the German embassy had approved ‚Ç¨30,000 in funding for a museum in Caiazzo commemorating the massacre.

Background Yasuda Castle is located on the western bank of the Ida River, a tributary of Jinz≈´ River, on the site of the Kureha hills, which divides Etch≈´ Province between the Toyama and Takaoka areas. Yasuda castle consist of three areas. The inner bailey is approximately 80 meters square and was surrounded by a two-meter clay rampart. Given its small size and secure location, it was intended to serve as the commander's residence. The inner bailey is connected to a secondary bailey, which apparently was used to store military supplies. As the castle faced its enemy to the west, the western side is further protected by a large kuruwa enclosure. The total size of the caste was thus some 200 meters in length by 150 meters in width. History The actual foundation of Yasuda Castle is not certain. During the 16th century, the area was contested between the local Jinb≈ç clan, the Uesugi clan and followers of the Ikk≈ç-ikki movement. Approximately five kilometers north of Yasuda Castle was Shiratori Castle, which was part of the outer defences of Toyama, then under the control of the warlord Sassa Narimasa. In 1585, when Toyotomi Hideyoshi launched his invasion of Etch≈´ Province, he expanded Yasuda Castle to serve as a temporary field headquarters for the Toyotomi army. Okajima Kazuyoshi, one of Maeda Toshiie's retainers, was appointed castellan; however, faced with overwhelming odds, Sassa Narimasa surrendered Toyama after only a week, and Yasuda Castle was never used in battle. Following these events, Etch≈´ Province was awarded to Maeda Toshiie, who appointed a magistrate based at Yasuda Castle. After the construction of Kanazawa Castle, Yasuda Castle was abandoned. Field headquarters such as Yasuda Castle normally disappear completely shortly after they are abandoned; however, due to the geography of the site, the outlines of the moats and clay ramparts were preserved. Current situation All of the structures of Yasuda Castle have long been lost and by the modern period, the moats had been filled in and much of the site was covered by rice paddy. In the late 1960s, the site was targeted for urban redevelopment, and in 1977 to 1978, archaeologists found the outlines of the moats and ramparts. The area received protection from development in 1981 with its designation as a National Historic Site. From 1990-1994, the moats were restored and the site was opened as a public archaeological park.

The series stars Nikki Hsieh as a rookie TV reporter and Lego Lee as a disgraced trial attorney from 2018, who become roommates every day between 10:06 pm and 10:52 pm during which their apartment undergoes an apparent times-pace merge. When the attorney realizes that the girl knows his former client, he wonders if he can prevent the 2017 unsolved murder which caused his downfall. The show generated more than 10 million views on the streaming website iQiyi Taiwan, making it the second most-watched series in iQiyi Taiwan's history, behind only the 2018 Chinese TV series Old Boy. Synopsis The story begins with a court case taking place, in which Ke Zhen Yu played by Lego Lee is the defense lawyer for Wu Ji Rao played by Aggie Hsieh. Wu Ji Rao is accused of using a very large trophy to murder her husband Jiang Cheng Hao played by Ryan Kuo, who is a martial arts master that owns his martial arts training center. Mo Si Ming who is played by Kunda Hsieh is the prosecutor for the case. However, Ke Zhen Yu's lawyer license was then immediately suspended due to supposed evidence of him manipulating evidence to the case, which he is then unable to continue to defend Wu Ji Rao. As Ke Zhen Yu leaves the court house, he then spots an origami on the floor and keeps it with him. He is then shown moving to a more affordable apartment due to now being unemployed. The origami possessed supernatural powers, which would turn back the time bringing him several months into the past from 10:06 pm to 10:52 pm, which would then bring him back to the present time. At first, he was unaware of this and had heard voices and noise and assumed his alcohol consumption was just affecting his mind, but one night when he was sleeping between 10:06 pm to 10:52 pm, he had woken up to see a woman Cheng Jia Le played by Nikki Hsieh who is a lying next to him asleep. The unaware asleep Cheng Jia Le unknowingly was grabbing onto Ke Zhen Yu. They had a few more encounters with each other afterward and then, later on, they would realize every night at 10:06 pm, the apartment would go through time travel bringing Ke Zhen Yu to several months back earlier, in which Cheng Jia Le was the tenant in that apartment in that past period and then at 10:52 pm, the apartment would return Ke Zhen Yu back to his present time, which explains why they see each other every night between 10:06 pm until 10:52 pm. In addition, all their apartment items would be overlapping with each other during this time frame, but the origami was the real culprit in doing these time travels, which they both were still not aware of. Because of this, Ke Zhen Yu manages his best to try to change the past situations including trying to stop the murder of Jiang Cheng Hao, who also happened to be very close friends with Cheng Jia Le and even asked Cheng Jie Le to help, but it was not successful and the murder still happened due to lacking the clues needed to stop it despite their efforts and attempts, but the only difference was the time and date of the murder was altered thanks to their attempts to alter the situations surrounding the murder and Wu Ji Rao is still charged in his murder. As Cheng Jia Le's life continues in her time frame, she encounters the Ke Zhen Yu who is still a lawyer in her own present time and often is not very nice to Cheng Jie Le, meanwhile, the present Ke Zhen Yu begins to have memories of the past being altered including his past self having not so nice interactions with Cheng Jia Le and he begins to realize his past self was very egotistic and arrogant. Cheng Jia Le is aware the Ke Zhen Yu she sees in her own time is different from the future Ke Zhen Yu she encounters with in her apartment at night time from the time travel. It is then discovered that Wu Han Wen, who grew up with Wu Ji Rao, but accepted each other like siblings was responsible for Jiang Cheng Hao's murder, especially with the clue of the cigarette bud being moved during the time of the murder, which Cheng Jie Le had noticed and informed Ke Zhen Yu who is several months into her future and they worked together to try solve the case during their time travel overlap every night, which altered many circumstances of the Ke Zhen Yu's past, which is Cheng Jia Le's present. Wu Ji Rao had known it was Wu Han Wen that murdered Jiang Cheng Hao with the large trophy, but has been protecting him, but she eventually becomes mentally insane and is placed in a mental health institution. The present time Ke Zhen Yu would soon discover that Cheng Jia Le would die from a deadly needle injection, from the culprit Zhang De Pei played by Yang Yong Wei, a martial student of Jiang Cheng Hao in an attempt to silence her from revealing the truth, but when the present Ke Zhen Yu is brought back to the past, which is Cheng Jie Le's present, he attempts to stop it, but he is stabbed with the needle instead and then Cheng Jie Le chases down and throws down Zhang De Pei to let the police arrest him. Cheng Jia Le, who was now already in love with Ke Zhen Yu of the future is holding onto him, but he disappears. The series then only shows Cheng Jia Le's time life and she no longer is able to go into the future to see the future Ke Zhen Yu. The current Ke Zhen Yu in Cheng Jia Le's time frame is still a lawyer and thanks to the fact Ke Zhen Yu from the future working with the present time Cheng Jia Le to try to stop the murder, which was not successful and with trying to get the clues to the case, it caused a lot of alterations of the social circumstances and the Ke Zhen Yu in Cheng Jia Le's time frame still manages to be a lawyer. However, the current Ke Zhen Yu in Cheng Jia Le's time life begins having memories Ke Zhen Yu's several months into the future and his future encounters with Cheng Jia Le, which is due to the fact he had picked up the origami that Cheng Jia Le had in her pocket, which was dropped out during the whole fiasco with Zhang De Pei trying to kill her. The origami had existed in both Cheng Jia Le's time frame and the future Ke Zhen Yu, which brought them together during the time travel process and began to have something meaningful between both of them including their love. The now-current Ke Zhen Yu would eventually remember all of the future Ke Zhen Yu's encounters with Cheng Jia Le and they both eventually became a couple and would live together permanently.

On the day they went missing, Sarah accompanied her father Paul, who owned the Tuff Movers moving company in Westminster, on a job along with his employee Chivers. The three were last seen in Morrison that evening. Sarah was reported missing by her mother after Paul failed to return her home from her weekend visitation; at this time, it was discovered that Paul and Chivers were also missing. A moving truck located at the Tuff Movers lot was subsequently discovered with bullet holes in its side, blood evidence, as well as a portion of human scalp near its windshield; a metal extension ramp for the truck was also missing from the lot. The disappearances of the Skibas and Chivers received national attention, and were profiled on The Montel Williams Show, America's Most Wanted, and by true crime journalist Nancy Grace. In 2016, their names were included on a list of missing persons as part of a Colorado Senate bill petitioning for a statewide Missing Persons Day, which was signed into law on February 5, 2016. As of 2018, the whereabouts of the Skibas and Chivers are still unknown, though law enforcement suspects foul play in their disappearances, and they are each presumed victims of homicide. Timeline =Background= Nine-year-old Sarah Arielle Skiba spent the weekend of February 5, 1999, with her father, Paul Carroll Skiba, at his home in Thornton, Colorado. Paul and Sarah's mother, Michelle Russell, were divorced. Paul was the owner of Tuff Movers, a local moving company in the Westminster area, and shared custody of Sarah. Sarah spent every other weekend with her father. Paul's on-and-off girlfriend, Teresa Donovan, lived with him on his property, and had recently given birth to a baby boy. Paul had told friends the week before that he questioned whether or not he had fathered the child, and would often \\"come home from work to find [Donovan] still in bed or partying next door with a neighbor, leaving Sarah to take care of the baby.\\" He also mentioned his plans to kick her out of his home and sue for full custody should a paternity test prove the child was his. =Disappearance= On Sunday, February 7, 1999, Paul's mother Sharon received a phone call from Donovan claiming that Paul had not arrived home that day from a job he had scheduled with his employee and co-worker, Lorenzo DeShawn Chivers. Sarah had accompanied both on a job in Westminster that evening, departing for the Tuff Movers store, located at 72nd Avenue and Raleigh Street, around 5:30 p.m. The three were last seen at approximately 6:00 p.m. in Morrison. When Paul failed to return home, Teresa phoned the police department, but stated they \\"did not take her seriously,\\" after which Sharon placed a call regarding Paul's absence. Some time later, Michelle phoned police again, notifying them that Sarah had not been returned from her weekend stay with Paul. =Subsequent events= On Monday, February 8, Jerry Bybee, another of Paul's employees, arrived at the Tuff Movers store, and noticed that the company's large moving truck had been unusually parked front-first and crooked. Bybee recalled: \\"Paul was a neat freak, anal about everything, so I'm thinking, 'Oh, I can't wait to hear why the truck's parked like that' ‚Äî because Paul would have a story.\\" Bybee also noted that the lock on the front gate had been changed, leaving him unable to enter the parking lot. After Paul and Chivers failed to arrive at the Tuff store, Bybee subsequently phoned police. Three days later, on February 11, law enforcement entered the Tuff Movers lot with Bybee assisting them; there, Bybee noticed a puddle of motor oil partly covered with a piece of plywood in the van lot. Bybee would later state that he felt the investigating officer \\"destroyed more evidence than he was willing to look at.\\" On February 13, a friend of Paul's, Rich Lesmeister, received a phone call from Teresa notifying him that Paul, Sarah, and Lorenzo were missing; he stated this was the first he had been made aware of their disappearances. That afternoon, Lesmeister and his wife, Carol, met with Sharon at the lot to further investigate the premises themselves; Lesmeister, an auto mechanic, had recently worked on a 1978 Chevrolet moving truck at the lot. He and Carol climbed over the fence, and upon investigating, found multiple bullet holes in the side of the truck he had previously been working on. The exterior of the truck also had a bloodstain smeared across it, and a chunk of what appeared to a human scalp was lying near the windshield. =Investigation= Law enforcement initially treated the case as a kidnapping, assuming that Paul had taken Sarah and run away with her. Upon further investigation, the Colorado Bureau of Investigation (CBI) found evidence of blood covering the back of the truck and cab via luminol. DNA analysis proved the blood to be that of a mixture of Sarah and Paul, and it was left in large enough quantities that both were presumed dead by authorities. On February 17, 1999, a vehicle belonging to Chivers was discovered parked at an apartment complex at 3809 68th Avenue in Westminster, several blocks from the Tuff Movers lot. Ten days later, on February 27, a vehicle belonging to Paul was discovered in an apartment complex parking lot at 3129 Arkansas Avenue in Denver. In March 1999, five weeks after the three disappearances, Thornton police and the CBI formally stated they had evidence suggesting foul play. A witness claimed to have heard a woman screaming at the Tuff Movers lot the night of the disappearances, February 7. Other witnesses later told police that the truck in question had been seen leaving the lot between seven and eight times that night before returning around approximately midnight. This led police to determine that the bodies of Chivers, Paul, and Sarah could \\"not be more than a couple of hours away.\\" An extension ramp was missing from one of the trucks, leading authorities to suspect the killer(s) may have used it to sink the three's remains in a lake, as vegetation discovered in the truck radiator indicated it had been driven near a body of water. Search canines were used in an attempt to trace the bodies, and NecroSearch, a company specializing in recovery of human remains, assisted in searches of lakes in the region. Publicity Donovan appeared on The Montel Williams Show to speak regarding the disappearances. She also appeared on a subsequent MSNBC special, during which she disclosed that law enforcement had told her she failed a polygraph examination. \\"I'd never hurt them,\\" she told the MSNBC interviewer. \\"I'd never hurt them. The police have tried to say that I killed them or I had them killed.\\" Donovan claimed in this special that Paul was killed by drug dealers who rented parking spaces from the Tuff Movers lot, and whose vehicles he had recently towed. The case has received coverage from Fox's America's Most Wanted and journalist Nancy Grace.

Background  On 24 June 1960 the Lumumba Government was installed as the first indigenous government of the new Republic of the Congo. Independence followed on 30 June 1960, but governing became chaotic amid an army mutiny, disorder, and Belgian intervention. Throughout August 1960 President Joseph Kasa-Vubu became increasingly bothered by Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba's growing authoritarianism, the collapse in administration, and the enlarging prospects of civil war. On 5 September Kasa-Vubu announced the revocation of Lumumba's ministerial mandate, along with the dismissal of Deputy Prime Minister Antoine Gizenga, three other ministers, and two secretaries of state over the radio. He stated that the President of the Senate, Joseph Il√©o, would form a new government. After Lumumba heard of the firing he held heated discussions with his ministers and made three broadcasts, defending his government and declaring Kasa-Vubu to be deposed. Two days later the Chamber of Deputies convened to discuss Kasa-Vubu's dismissal order. The Chamber voted to annul both Kasa-Vubu's and Lumumba's declarations of dismissal, 60 to 19. The following day the Senate delivered the Lumumba Government a vote of confidence, 49 to zero with seven abstentions. According to Article 51, Parliament was granted the \\"exclusive privilege\\" to interpret the constitution. In cases of doubt and controversy, the Congolese were originally supposed to appeal constitutional questions to the Belgian Conseil d'√âtat. With the rupture of relations in July this was no longer possible, so no authoritative interpretation or mediation was available to bring a legal resolution to the dispute.  Mobutu's coup  On 14 September Colonel Joseph-Desir√© Mobutu announced over the radio that he was launching a 'peaceful revolution' to break the political impasse and therefore neutralising the President, Lumumba's and Il√©o's respective governments, and Parliament until 31 December. He stated that \\"technicians\\" would run the administration while the politicians sorted out their differences. In a subsequent press conference he clarified that Congolese university graduates would be asked to form a government and further declared that all Eastern Bloc countries should close their embassies. Lumumba and Kasa-Vubu were both surprised by the coup.  Organisation and establishment  On 20 September Mobutu announced the formation of the College of Commissioners-General under the chairmanship of Justin Marie Bomboko. Soldiers expelled the remaining politicians from their offices. Of the Commissioners-General, Albert Ndele, Joseph Mbeke, and Martin Ngwete had all been chef de cabinet to a minister in the Lumumba Government. Damien Kandolo, chef de cabinet to Lumumba, was also made a commissioner. Both Thomas Kanza and Andr√® Mandi, members of Lumumba's government, were invited to join the College. Though the latter attended the College's early sessions, both became disturbed by the body's inclination towards Kasa-Vubu and summarily refused to participate in the administration. Their abstention allowed the government's anti-Lumumba slant to worsen without restraint. Meanwhile, Lumumba's Minister of Youth and Sports, Maurice Mpolo attempted to undermine the College and rivaled Mobutu for control of the army.  Composition  The full list of commissioners was printed in the Moniteur Congolais on 10 October. The following all served during the College's existence: = Commissioners-general = # Commissioner-General for Foreign Affairs and External Commerce and President of the College Justin Bomboko (Free University of Brussels) # Commissioner-General for Finance and Monetary Questions and Vice-President of the College Albert Ndele (Catholic University of Leuven) # Commissioner-General for Labour and Social Problems Charles Bokonga (Catholic University of Leuven) # Commissioner-General for National Education and Youth and Sports and Spokesman of the College Mario Cardoso (Catholic University of Leuven) # Commissioner-General for Public Function Valentin Bindo Albi (Free University of Brussels) # Commissioner-General for National Defence Ferdinand Kazadi (Lovanium University) # Commissioner-General for Agriculture and the Middle Class Pierre Lebughe (Lovanium University) # Commissioner-General for Justice Marcel Lihau (Catholic University of Leuven) # Commissioner-General for Public Works Joseph Masanga (Lovanium University) # Commissioner-General for Economic Co-ordination and Planning Joseph Mbeka (Lovanium University) # Commissioner-General for Information and Spokesman of the College Albert Bolela (Catholic University of Leuven) # Commissioner- General for Social Affairs Albert Mpase (Catholic University of Leuven) # Commissioner-General for Telecommunications Aubert Mukendi (University of Li√®ge) # Commissioner-General for Interior Jos√© Nussbaumer (Catholic University of Leuven) # Commissioner-General for Public Health Marcel Tshibamba (Lovanium University) = Commissioners = # Commissioner for Social Affairs Albert Atunda # Commissioner for National Education and Youth and Sports Cl√©ophas Bizala # Commissioner for National Education Honor√© Waku # Commissioner for Labour and Social Problems Andr√© Bo-Boliko # Commissioner for Interior Damien Kondolo # Commissioner for Interior Jonas Mukamba # Commissioner for Foreign Affairs and External Commerce Ernest Kashemwa # Commissioner for Foreign Affairs and External Commerce Evariste Loliki # Commissioner for Economic Co-ordination and Planning Julien Kasongo # Commissioner for Information Pascal Kapella # Commissioner for Information Z√©pherin Konde # Commissioner for Public Function Fran√ßois Kungula # Commissioner for Public Function F√©licien Lukusa # Commissioner for Finance Paul Mushiete # Commissioner for Agriculture Claude Ngondo # Commissioner for the Middle Class Jean-Marie Ngyesse Fran√ßois # Commissioner for Transport and Communications Gilbert Pongo # Commissioner for Justice Etienne Tshisekedi # Commissioner for National Defence Nestor Watum # Commissioner for Public Works Henri Takizala # Commissioner for Public Works Joseph Posho # Commissioner for Public Health Martin Ngwete  Tenure  On 11 October Kasa-Vubu issued a \\"constitutional decree-law\\" officiating the establishment of the College of Commissioners-General, asserting his right as Head of State to appoint and dismiss its members, adjourning Parliament indefinitely, and conferring all legislative authority prescribed to Parliament by the Loi Fondementale to the College. In time, the College would come to bring about the restoration of some order to the administration that had been lost during the Lumumba Government's tenure. Lumumba frequently attacked the body's credibility. As the end of the year approached Mobutu backed away from his promise of restoring democratic processes after December and postponed the return to normal governance indefinitely. In an attempt to indicate a reorientation towards legality, the College of Commissioners was dissolved by Kasa-Vubu on 9 February 1961 and replaced by a new cabinet under Il√©o.  Aftermath  Bomboko returned to his post as Minister of Foreign Affairs.

Whether Tithorea occupied the same, or a nearby spot, to Neon is a matter of some doubt. Pausanias regards Tithorea as situated on the same site as Neon; and relates that Tithorea was the name anciently applied to the whole district, and that when the inhabitants of the neighbouring villages were collected in the city, the name of Tithorea was substituted for that of Neon. This, however, is not in accordance with the statement of Plutarch, according to whom Tithorea, in the time of the Mithridatic War, was a fortress surrounded by precipitous rocks, where the Phocians took refuge from Xerxes I. He further states that it was not such a city as the one existing in his day. If the view of Plutarch is correct, that the fortress, the site of which was afterwards occupied by the city Tithorea, was the place where the Phocians took refuge from Xerxes, we may conclude that Tithorea and Neon were two different places. The city, which existed in the time of Plutarch and Pausanias, was a place of some importance, though it had begun to decline for a generation before the time of Pausanias. The latter writer mentions, however, a theatre, the enclosure of an ancient agora, a temple of Athena, and the tomb of Antiope and Phocus.. A river flowed by Tithorea, called Cachales (ŒöŒ±œáŒ¨ŒªŒ∑œÇ), to which the inhabitants had to descend in order to obtain water.-13. The city also produced a remarkable quality of olive oil that whilst smaller in quantity than that of Attica or Syconia was considered to be superior in quality to that of the Iberian Peninsula and that of Istria., 10.32.18. It was also told that, when the sun passed through Taurus, the inhabitants of Tithorea took earth from the supposed tomb where Amphion and Zethus were buried, which was in Thebes; if this earth was put in contact with the tomb of Antiope, the people of Tithorea would have good harvest and the Thebans bad, for that reason the Thebans had put sentinels in the tomb. The ruins of Tithorea are situated at the modern village of the same name (formerly called Velitsa but renamed to reflect the association with the ancient city), at the northeast foot of Mount Parnassus. The site is fixed by an inscription found there, in which the name of Tithorea occurs. A considerable portion of the walls, and many of the towers, still remain. The town was carefully fortified towards the west and northwest, and was sufficiently protected towards the northeast and east by the precipitous banks of the Cachales, and towards the south by the steep sides of Mt. Parnassus. The walls are almost broad. The Cachales, which now bears the name of Kak√≥reuma, or the evil torrent, flows in a ravine below the village, and thus illustrates the statement of Pausanias, that the inhabitants descended to it in order to obtain water. Behind the village, ascending the Cachales, there is a cavern on the steep side of the rock, which, during the Greek War of Independence, received a great number of fugitives. It is very spacious, is supplied with excellent water, and is quite impregnable. This is probably the place where the inhabitants of Neon and the surrounding places took refuge in the Persian invasion, as the Delphians did in the Corycian cave, more especially as the height immediately above the village is not adapted for such a purpose. A difficult mule path leads at present through the ravine of the Cachales across the heights of Parnassus to Delphi. In the time of Pausanias there were two roads from Tithorea across the mountain to Delphi, one direct, the other longer, but practicable for carriages. In the territory of Tithorea, but at the distance of 70 stadia from the city, was a temple of Asclepius, and also, at the distance of 40 stadia, a shrine of Isis.-13. The temple of Asclepius had an image of the god with a beard, made of stone, to which all the Phocians worshiped, and could sacrifice anything except goats. In the temple there were houses for the supplicants and for the servants of the temple and there was even a bed to the right of the image of Asclepius. The shrine of Isis was within a sacred precinct, where only those whom the goddess had invited in dreams could have access, according to the inhabitants of Tithorea. Celebrations were held in honor of Isis twice a year, in spring and at the end of autumn. Three days before each feast those who could access the site were purified with a secret rite; the first day, if they found any part of the victims of the previous feast, they would pick them up and bury them in a place that was two stadia away. On the second day, the merchants built tents with reeds and other improvised materials and on the third day slaves and animals dressed in gold and silver were sold. After noon the sacrifices were celebrated, in which the richest would sacrifice oxen and deer, while poorer people would geese and guinea fowl. Pigs, sheep and goats could not be slaughtered. The victims were wrapped in cloth and arranged in the Egyptian way. Then there was a procession with the victims and finally the stores were burned.-17.

From his start as an actor in Auckland to his heyday in the early 1900s as a company manager and owner, he toured virtually every town in Australasia with the Brandon-Cremer Players. Brandon-Cremer has the distinction of a record 54 weeks of non-stop stage production in 1917. He also produced at least two early silent films. His directorial debut was the first silent movie travelogue ever shot in Tasmania in 1927. His daughter, Gertrude Brandon-Cremer, was a child star of the stage during the first 20 years of the 20th century and his son, Ernest Gustav Brandon-Cremer, was a well-known adventurer and documentary film maker. The family name generated thousands of newspaper articles over the course of Albert's life. In Adelaide, 1952, Brandon-Cremer was once introduced in an interview by Australian Broadcasting Corporation Radio with \\"its really, um‚Ä¶ rather difficult to think of any theatre movement in Australia, in the total history of the Australian theatre, without thinking of you\\".  Early life  Albert Wilhelm Anton Brandon-Cremer was born on 7 November 1871 in Newry, County Down, Ireland, to parents Gustav Caesar Antonin Cremer and Saretta Frances Brandon. Albert was the fifth child in a family of eight brothers and one sister. The model Victorian Brandon-Cremer parents instilled a tradition of music and literature in their children, many of whom would go on to perform on stage with various skills and talents. At age 15, Albert was indentured to the New Zealand Shipping Company and made several trips from the UK to New Zealand and sailed around the world during the following years.

Coulter sitting on the right side of the carriage driver seat  New Zealand  At the age of 19, Albert departed England for a new life in New Zealand aboard the SS Rangatiki on 22 August 1891, arriving in Wellington, New Zealand, on 22 December 1891. By early 1892, he was working as a farmhand at the Frimley Sheep Station, outside Wellington. His acting career began shortly after, while working with the Vivian Theatrical Co., then the Duncan Theatrical Co., before joining the Cowan & Amy Vaughan Amazon Co.‚Äîall in quick succession. The first mention of Albert working in New Zealand was for the Amy Vaughn Company in July 1892. On 7 January 1893, while touring New Zealand, in the small booming gold mining town of Kumara on New Zealand's South Island, Albert married Annie Beaton, stage name Annie Wyniard, an opera singer. The couple registered the births of three children - Dorothy Saretta, born 1893; Ernest Gustav, 1895; and Leonore Frances, 1896. During this time Albert was managing the Frances Ross Dramatic Company. In August 1897 Albert left for London to find work. London news clippings from February to June 1898 show that Albert was on stage in London. Albert returned to New Zealand in September 1898; in the same year he began touring there with the Robert Henry Theatrical Company. Logo representing the A Brandon-Cremer theatrical company, 1910  The Brandon-Cremer Players Touring Company  In 1900 the family moved to Australia, with Albert travelling back and forth to New Zealand during that year for work. By this time Albert had already met Isora ‚ÄòDolly‚Äô Grey (an actress, stage name - Kathleen ‚ÄòNora‚Äô Arnold), a member of his new acting troupe, the ‚ÄòA. Brandon- Cremer Dramatic Company‚Äô. Albert's Company toured Australia for years to come and visited towns across both Australia and New Zealand. Albert and Isora would marry and produce two children who would both go on to successful careers on stage and early television in Australia. The first: Kathleen Gertrude 'Gertie' Dora Barbara Cremer in 1902. The second: Mollie Stella Sadie Mascot Cremer in 1907. Over the next 20 years Albert and Isora would have great success leasing theatres and running a repertory company across Australia and New Zealand. His work intertwined with such greats as J.C. Williamson as Isora, Albert's wife described in an interview covering this period. One of Albert's greatest successes was a 54-week production run in 1917 while leasing the Kings Theatre (now Mercury Theatre, Auckland), New Zealand, a record at the time. Bert Cross behind the camera at the shooting of 'Tasmania at Work and Play', image taken by son of the movie producer, AWA Brandon-Cremer Cast and Crew of the missing film produced by AWA Brandon- Cremer, 1920  Tasmania at Work and Play  By 1927, Albert was in Hobart, Tasmania, making a silent film entitled, ‚ÄòTasmania at Work and Play‚Äô, starring his daughter Mollie as the central character. The short silent travelogue features scenes with Mollie as a tourist playing ‚ÄòMollie from the Mainland‚Äô. The film has survived and is retained by Tasmanian State archives. The film was credited as the first such movie shot in Tasmania. The cinematographer was Bert Cross from Sydney who worked at Cinesound with Albert's son, Ernest. In 1929, Albert made another short silent film entitled, ‚ÄòNursery Rhymes‚Äô, shot by his son Ernest on Bronte Beach, which was shown across Australia. This movie has been lost. Cinematographer Arthur Higgins was also attached. That same year, Albert's first wife, Annie Cremer (n√©e Beaton), died, age 61, of kidney and liver failure, an illness she suffered with for many years. Annie was buried in an unmarked common grave at the Melbourne General Cemetery, central Melbourne.  A Return to the UK  By 1931, Albert had returned to London once again to find work in the Theatre. Albert was mentioned several times in the book 'The London Stage 1930-1939'. One entry notes stage-managing the play, 'Bed Rock' at the Apollo Theatre, Shaftsbury Avenue, London, in early 1931, the play survived only 12 performances. Some of the many other plays he was involved with were: 'The Fatal Wedding', 'Old Bill' with Sir Seymour Hicks, 'Sweet Nell of Old Drury' and 'Tons of Money' with Nellie Stewart. Also a run with a play entitled 'The Man They Could Not Hang'. While in the UK, Isora, Gertrude and Mollie would join him and start new lives in London.  The End of an Era  In late 1949, Albert, travelling alone, returned to Australia from his 19-year stay in London. In his final years, Albert continued to act in such plays as ‚ÄòCharlie‚Äôs Aunt‚Äô, 'A Worm's Eye View', 'One Wild Oat', and 'Seagulls Over Sorrento' with the Australian actor Gordon Chater. His work was also mentioned in a series of notices in the Brisbane Courier Mail between 3 and 25 January 1952. Albert was credited as working with Australian actor Bill Hodge in 'A Worms Eye View' in 1955, this was one of Albert's last known plays. Albert was mentioned in several books covering the histories of the Australian/British Stage. One book entitled 'When Vaudeville Was King', as well in the book, 'Family of Brothers'. Another mention in 'The London Stage 1890-1959' and in 'Her Majesty's Pleasure' Albert W. A. Brandon-Cremer died on 11 July 1959. His wife, Isora, had died the year before. Albert and Isora were laid to rest in the Fawkner Crematorium and Memorial Park, Hadfield, Victoria (North Melbourne), with no markers.

In 1972, the remnants of 21 pit dwellings as well as food storage pits and many artefacts such as fragments of pottery and stoneware were discovered. Of especially interest was the central part of the ruins, which contained the foundations of a long oval structure measuring 17 meters east-to-west and 8 meters north-south, making it one of the largest pit dwellings found in Japan. At the center of the floor, four stone enclosures are regularly arranged on the longitudinal axis, of which two in the east are rectangular and two in the west are circular. It is presumed that the building served as a public structure, possibility for ceremonial purposes. The site is now an archaeological park, with several reconstructed pit dwellings, and is open to the public.

History Founded in 2001 as Renaissance Education, Music & Sports (Renaissance-EMS), Renaissance Youth Center offers a variety of programs in education, music, sports, and civic engagement. Renaissance was co-founded by Bervin Harris and Darren Quinlan to serve the Bronx's Morrisania neighborhood. Harris was a former recording artist with Orpheus/Capitol Records, while Quinlan was a former NCAA Division 1 college basketball player at St. Bonaventure University, and songwriter who won the 1992 Abe Olman Scholarship from the Songwriters Hall of Fame. Harris and Quinlan helped produce the KRS-One's album Spiritual Minded. Key Programs =Music On Wheels= Music On Wheels, brings music teachers and curriculum to schools that no longer have music programs for more than 30 public schools in New York City. Renaissance holds an annual Music On Wheels Recital where hundreds of students from New York City gather to perform for family and friends. =Music With A Message Band= The Music With A Message Band is a 25-member performance group, aged 6‚Äì21, that write songs about social issues and perform throughout New York City.

In 2016, they opened Mayor Bill de Blasio's 2016 State of the City address at the Lehman Center for the Performing Arts. =Renaissance Youth Council= In 2014, Renaissance's Youth Council spent eight hours painting Unity Park a pink salmon color, only to have the NYC Parks Department paint over their work because the youth group permit only allowed them to use a gray color. After media attention and months of discussions, Renaissance partnered with the Parks Department to repaint the park. In 2016, the Youth Council turned its attention to a nearby slaughterhouse, gathering over 4,700 petition signatures and support from New York State Assembly member Michael Blake to force the clean up of animal carcasses, blood spills, and the foul odor, that lowered the quality of life in the neighborhood. In 2018, Renaissance Youth Council launched Youth Connect: Journey 2 Unity Tour, a five-borough tour with examples of positive teenagers to inspire disconnected youth engage with peers in local programs. Hundreds of youth attended these summer events, including the finale in Mullaly Park, that drew support from New York City Parks Department Commissioner Mitchell Silver and New York City Council member Vanessa Gibson.

Simcheongga is the pansori of the tale.Ïû¨ÎØ∏ÏûàÎäî Ïö∞Î¶¨Íµ≠ÏïÖ Ïù¥ÏïºÍ∏∞, ÏÑúÌï¥Î¨∏Ïßë It was adapted on screen by Shin Sang-ok twice, once in South Korea in 1972, and as The Tale of Shim Chong in 1985 when he and his wife Choi Eun-hee were abducted to North Korea.  Introduction  Sim Cheong-jeon is a story about Sim Cheong who throws herself into the sea of Indangsu as a sacrifice so that her blind father can regain his eyesight. Her filial piety helps her to be resurrected and become an empress, and her father's blindness is cured.  Authorship  The identity of the author is unknown, and the period in which this work was created is also unknown. However, there is a mention of a jeongisu (professional storyteller) reading Sim Cheong-jeon in Chujaejip (ÁßãÈΩãÈõÜ Collected Writings of Chujae Jo Susam), written by Jo Susam (Ë∂ôÁßÄ‰∏â, 1762-1847). Therefore, scholars believe that Sim Cheong-jeon existed as a complete work in the 18th century.  Literature  = Texts = There are handwritten, woodblock print, and metal-type print editions of Sim Cheong-jeon. Sim Cheon-jeon jeonjip (Ïã¨Ï≤≠Ï†Ñ Ï†ÑÏßë Complete Collection of Sim Cheong-jeon) (edited by Kim Jin-yeong et al., Pagijong, 2004) contains a total of 83 different editions of the story. Woodblock editions are largely divided into three groups: ‚ÄúHannam edition version‚Äù and ‚ÄúSongdong edition version,‚Äù which were published in Seoul, and ‚ÄúJeonju edition version.‚Äù Major differences among the three versions are: 1) the appearance of a celestial being who comes down to earth (Hannam edition version), 2) the appearance of Bbaengdeok's mother (Songdong edition version), and 3) the appearance of Lady Jang (Jeonju edition version). Generally, the Hannam edition is considered to be the earliest version of Sim Cheong-jeon, followed by the Songdong edition and the Jeonju edition. Sometimes the different editions of Sim Cheong-jeon are grouped by whether the writing style shows characteristics of pansori or written fiction; by the different spellings of the name of Sim Cheong's father; and by the differences in the section featuring Lady Jang. Most handwritten editions of Sim Cheong-jeonare considered to be the Jeonju edition version. = Plot = The Hannam edition version, published in 24 sheets in Seoul, features the following plot: During the reign of Emperor Chenghua in Ming China, Sim Hyeon and his wife Jeong give birth to a daughter named Sim Cheong. Upon giving birth to Sim Cheong, Jeong dies and Sim suffers from an illness that renders him blind. As a single father, Sim Hyeon raises Sim Cheong all by himself. In the year Sim Cheong turns 13, Sim Hyeon goes out by himself and gets into trouble, whereupon a Buddhist monk rescues him and tells him that he will regain his eyesight if he gives 300 sacks of rice as an offering to Buddha. Sim promises the offering to the monk and returns home. Sim Cheong finds out about her father's promise and volunteers to become a sacrifice for the seamen in return for 300 sacks of rice. When Sim Cheong throws herself into the sea of Indangsu, she is summoned by the Dragon King, is resurrected in a lotus flower, and becomes an empress. Now an empress, Sim Cheong hosts a feast for the blind and reunites with her father. Overjoyed at the reunion with his daughter, Sim Hyeon regains his eyesight. Although the versions of editions printed in Seoul tend to be relatively unpolished, Jeonju edition versions are more detailed and elaborate, featuring a variety of characters, including Lady Jang, Bbaengdeok's mother, Gwideok's mother, and Blind Hwang. = Bbaengdeok's mother = Bbaengdeok's mother is a character who appears after Sim Cheong falls into the waters of Indangsu. She swindles Sim Hyeon and steals his money. The negative image of Bbaengdeok's mother is apparent from the description of her appearance and actions. Although there are differences in different editions, in most cases, Bbaengdeok's mother is described as an ugly woman with a strong sexual appetite. She becomes a more prominent character in the Jeonju edition and Sin Jae-hyo edition, and Sim Cheong's father also becomes more important in the plot. This has led some scholars to argue that Sim Cheong's father becomes a main character in the Jeonju edition version, while Sim Cheong is the sole main character in earlier versions of Sim Cheong- jeon. On the way to the feast for the blind that Sim Cheong hosts as an empress, Bbaengdeok's mother falls in love with Blind Hwang and runs away with him, leaving Sim Cheong's father behind. In relation to the appearance of Bbaengdeok's mother, the yangban culture is often discussed as an important aspect shown through Sim Cheong's father, who is depicted as a foolish man who becomes infatuated with a woman and squanders his fortune away. This shows that while Sim Cheong-jeon tells the story of Sim Cheong's filial piety on the surface, the depiction of Sim Cheong's father shows people's criticism of the reality and ideologies of the time.  Features and Significance  = Pansori-based fiction = As pansori became popular in the late Joseon Dynasty, stories of pansori began to be enjoyed in the book form. Pansori Sim Cheong-ga became a novel, titled Sim Cheong-jeon. Pansori-based fiction is generally thought to have originated from folk narratives (seolhwa), which became pansori, and later novels. But in the case of Sim Cheong-jeon, some believe that the novel version came before the pansori. = Original folk narratives = Sim Cheong-jeon is considered to be a result of several different folk narratives, such as Hyonyeo Jieun seolhwa (Â≠ùÂ•≥Áü•ÊÅ©Ë™™Ë©± Story of Jieun, a Filial Daughter), Gwaneumsa yeongi seolhwa (ËßÄÈü≥ÂØ∫Á∑£Ëµ∑Ë™™Ë©± Story about the Origin of Gwaneum Temple), Insin gonghui seolhwa (‰∫∫Ë∫´‰æõÁäßË™™Ë©± Story of a Human Sacrifice), and Hyohaeng seolhwa (Â≠ùË°åË™™Ë©± Story of Filial Actions). Some also believe that it is a combination of Gaean seolhwa (ÈñãÁúºË™™Ë©± Story of Regaining Eyesight) and Cheonyeo saengji seolhwa (Story of a Virgin Sacrifice). Hyonyeo Jieun seolhwa tells the story of a girl named Jieun who took care of her mother by selling her body. Gwaneumsa yeongi seolhwa is about Won Hongjang who made an offering to the Buddha for her father and later became an empress. After becoming an empress, she sent a statue of Gwaneum to Korea, and Gwaneum Temple was built in Gokseong to house the statue. Insin gonghui seolhwa is a story about making a human sacrifice to a celestial being, while Gaehan seolhwa tells a story about a blind person regaining his eyesight. Lastly, Cheonyeo saengji seolhwa is a folk narrative about offering up an unmarried woman as a sacrifice.  Other  Yeo Gyu-hyeong (ÂëÇÂú≠‰∫®, 1848-1921) rewrote Sim Cheong-jeon in Chinese characters and entitled it Japgeuk Sim Cheong wanghu- jeon (Miscellaneous Play: Tale of Queen Sim Cheong). This edition was created for a performance at Wongaksa, the first modern Korean theater, and therefore is presumed to have been written sometime between 1907 and 1908, when performances were staged at Wongaksa. Sim Cheong-jeon was also rewritten into a sinsoseol titled Gangsangnyeon (Ê±ü‰∏äËìÆ, Lotus in the River) by Yi Hae-jo (ÊùéÊµ∑Êúù, 1869-1927). Gangsangnyeon was published in 33 installments in Maeil Shinbo from March 17 to April 26, 1912. Sim Cheong-jeon has been rewritten as modern fiction and poem and also adapted into song, TV show, film, changgeuk, opera, musical, madang nori, and children's book. Most recently, Universal Ballet held a ballet performance titled Shim Chung (October 2019). The town of Gokseong in Jeollanam-do hosts the annual Sim Cheong Festival in an attempt to celebrate Sim Cheong's filial piety and reinterpret the meaning of filial piety in modern society. Gokseong is considered to be the setting for Gwaneunsa yeongi seolhwa, which is known to be the original story on which Sim Cheong-jeon is based.  Translations  = English = * H. N.

The boy and others hid in a bunker during the final liquidation of the ghetto, but they were caught and forced out by German troops. After the photograph was taken, all of the Jews in the photograph were marched to the Umschlagplatz and deported to Majdanek extermination camp or Treblinka. The exact location and the photographer are not known, and Bl√∂sche is the only person in the photograph who can be identified with certainty. The image is one of the most iconic photographs of the Holocaust, and the boy came to represent children in the Holocaust, as well as all Jewish victims.  Background  Jews forced to board Holocaust trains during the Grossaktion Warsaw Warsaw is the capital of Poland. Before the war, about 380,000 Jews lived there, about one-quarter of the population. Upon the German invasion in September 1939, Jews began to be subject to anti-Jewish laws. In 1941, they were forced to move to the Warsaw Ghetto, which contained as many as 460,000 people in only 2.4% of the city's area. The official food ration was only 180 calories per person daily. Although being caught on the \\"Aryan\\" side of the city was an offense punishable by death, people survived by smuggling and running illegal workshops. In mid-1942, most of the Jews in the Warsaw Ghetto were deported to the Treblinka extermination camp. In January 1943, when the Germans resumed deportations, the Jewish Combat Organization staged armed resistance. Jews began to dig bunkers and smuggle weapons into the ghetto. On 19 April 1943, about 2,000 soldiers under the command of SS and Police Leader J√ºrgen Stroop entered the ghetto with tanks in order to liquidate the ghetto. They expected to quickly defeat the poorly armed Jewish insurgents, but instead the Warsaw Ghetto uprising, the largest act of Jewish resistance against the Holocaust, dragged on for four weeks. The Germans had to set the ghetto on fire, pump poison gas into bunkers, and blast the Jews out of their positions in order to march them to the Umschlagplatz and deport them to Majdanek and Treblinka. According to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, \\"[t]his seemingly hopeless struggle... became one of the most significant occurrences in the history of the Jewish people\\". During the suppression of the uprising, Stroop sent daily communiqu√©s to Higher SS and Police Leader Friedrich-Wilhelm Kr√ºger in Krak√≥w; Propaganda Company 689 and Franz Konrad took photographs to document the events. Selected photographs and communiqu√©s were compiled, along with a summary of German actions, as the Stroop Report, a personal souvenir for Heinrich Himmler. The report was intended to promote Stroop's efficiency as a commander and excuse his failure to clear the ghetto quickly. The report memorialized the supposed heroism of the SS men who participated in the suppression of the uprising, especially the sixteen who were killed by Jewish fighters. More than 7,000 Jews were shot during the uprising, the vast majority noncombatants. The original title of the report was The Jewish Quarter of Warsaw is No More! (). Reflecting Nazi propaganda, the report dehumanized the Jews, describing them as \\"bandits\\", \\"lice\\", or \\"rats\\" and their deportation and murder as a \\"cleansing action\\". Instead of being killed or murdered, Jews were \\"destroyed\\". Three copies of the report were made, for Himmler, Kr√ºger, and Stroop. One copy of the Stroop Report is held by the Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) in Warsaw. Another copy was entered into evidence at the Nuremberg Trials, although the photograph was not ultimately shown to the court. That copy is held by the United States National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).  Photograph  The photograph was taken during the Warsaw Ghetto uprising (between 19 April and 16 May) in the Warsaw Ghetto. An Internet forum discussion on the \\"Marki Commuter Railway\\" Association for Defending the Remnant of Warsaw cautiously identified the location as Nowolipie 34 from similarities in the architectural details, especially the downspout. These claims are discussed in a 2018 Polish-language book, Teraz ‚Ä≤43 (Now ‚Ä≤43), by Magdalena Kici≈Ñska and Marcin Dziedzic. The photographer was either Franz Konrad or a member of Propaganda Company 689. Albert Cusian, Erhard Josef Knoblach and Arthur Grimm served as photographers in Propaganda Company 689; Cusian may have claimed to have taken the photograph. On trial in Poland, Konrad claimed to have taken photographs during the uprising only so that he could complain about Stroop's brutality to Adolf Hitler. The court did not accept this claim. Convicted of personally murdering seven Jews and deporting a thousand others to death camps, Konrad was sentenced to death and executed in 1952. The photograph depicts a group of Jewish men, women and children who have been forced out of a bunker by armed German soldiers. The original caption was \\"Forcibly pulled out of bunkers\\" (). Most of the Jews are wearing ragged clothing and have few personal possessions. After being removed from the bunker, they were marched to the Umschlagplatz for deportation to an extermination camp. In the center of the photograph is a small boy wearing a newsboy cap and knee-length socks who appears six or seven years old. He holds his hands up in surrender as SS-Rottenf√ºhrer Josef Bl√∂sche holds a submachine gun pointing downwards in his direction. The photograph contains many opposites; as Richard Raskin put it: \\"SS vs. Jews, perpetrators vs. victims, military vs. civilians, power vs. helplessness, threatening hands on weapons vs. empty hands raised in surrender, steel helmets vs bare-headedness or soft caps, smugness vs. fear, security vs. doom, men vs. women and children\\". According to Fr√©d√©ric Rousseau, Stroop probably chose to include the photograph in the report because it showed his ability to overcome Judeo- Christian morality and attack innocent women and children.  Identification  = The boy = There are several individuals who have been claimed to be the boy in the photo, but his identity remains unclear. All of the proposed claimants' stories are inconsistent with the known facts about the photograph. The boy was probably younger than ten, because he was not wearing a Star of David armband. Dr. Lucjan Dobroszycki, a historian employed by the Yivo Institute for Jewish Research who has studied the photograph, stated that \\"This photograph of the most dramatic event of the Holocaust requires a greater level of responsibility from historians than almost any other... [i]t is too holy to let people do with it what they want.\\" * Artur DƒÖb SiemiƒÖtek, born in ≈Åowicz in 1935, was first proposed as the subject of the photo in 1950. SiemiƒÖtek was from a well-off family and his father was a member of the Judenrat in the ≈Åowicz Ghetto, liquidated to Warsaw in 1941. Jadwiga Piesecka, a cousin of SiemiƒÖtek and resident of Warsaw, and her husband fled to the Soviet Union in September 1939. They survived the Holocaust and signed affidavits that SiemiƒÖtek was the boy in the photo in the 1970s. * In 1999, a 95-year-old man named Avrahim Zelinwarger told the Ghetto Fighters House in Israel that the boy in the photo was his son, Levi Zeilinwarger, born in 1932. Avrahim escaped to the Soviet Union in 1940, but his wife Chana (who would be the woman in the photograph), son, and daughter are all believed to have been killed during the Holocaust. Richard Raskin personally doubted the Zelinwarger claim because of the lack of resemblance between Levi and the boy in the photograph. * In 1978, Israel Rondel told the Jewish Chronicle that he was the boy in the photograph, but because he said that the photograph was taken in 1941, and other details do not match, his claim has been dismissed. Nussbaum's 1945 passport photograph * Tsvi Chaim Nussbaum (de, fr) (1936‚Äì2012) was born in Tel Aviv but his family returned to Poland before the war. He lived in hiding on the \\"Aryan\\" side of Warsaw. Since he and his family had valid Palestinian visas, they fell into the Hotel Polski trap in which the Germans promised safe passage out of occupied Europe. Liberated by American troops at Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1945, Nussbaum stated in 1982 that he had been arrested in front of the Hotel Polski on 13 July 1943 and forced to raise his arms as depicted. Although some Jewish organizations uncritically accepted this claim at the time it was made, it is not possible that Nussbaum was the boy in the photo. Nussbaum himself never claimed to be certain about the identification, saying \\"I think it‚Äôs me, but I can‚Äôt honestly swear to it. A million and a half Jewish children were told to raise their hands\\". Dobroszycki pointed out the discrepancies between Nussbaum's claim and what is known about the photograph. All images in the Stroop Report are believed to have been taken inside the Warsaw Ghetto, while the Hotel Polski is not in the ghetto. The Hotel Polski roundups occurred in a courtyard, while the photograph depicts a street. Most of the Jews in the photograph are wearing heavy clothing, which suggests that the photograph was not taken in July; they are wearing armbands that they would not have worn while in hiding on the \\"Aryan\\" side of the city. The Germans are wearing combat uniforms which they would not have needed at the Hotel Polski roundups. Furthermore, Nussbaum was arrested more than a month after the Stroop Report was delivered to Himmler. A comparison with Nussbaum's 1945 photograph by forensic anthropologist K. R. Burns of the University of Georgia revealed that Nussbaum had detached earlobes, unlike the boy in the photograph. = Other individuals = The woman emerging from the building directly behind the boy was Go≈Çda Stawarowska, according to Stawarowska's granddaughter Golda Shulkes. The boy with the white bag over his shoulder was identified as Ahron Leizer (Leo) Kartuzi≈Ñski (or Kartuzinsky) (Photograph Number: 26543) from Gda≈Ñsk by his sister, Hana Ichengrin. The same person was also identified as Harry-Haim Nieschawer. Polish-American Holocaust survivor Esther Grosband-Lamet said that the small girl on the extreme left foreground was her niece Channa (Hanka) Lamet (or Hannah Lemet) (1937‚Äì1943) who was murdered at Majdanek. The woman wearing the scarf would then be Hanka's mother Matylda Goldfinger-Lamet or Mathylda Lamet Goldfinger, married to Mosze Lamet; the family was from Warsaw. Bl√∂sche in the photograph The only identification that is certain is that of Rottenf√ºhrer Josef Bl√∂sche, the SS man aiming the MP 28 submachine gun at the boy. Bl√∂sche was born in the Sudetenland in 1912 and served in the Einsatzgruppen, and he was a policeman employed at the Warsaw Ghetto during the uprising. Marek Edelman testified that Bl√∂sche murdered Jews as part of his \\"daily routine\\" and he was known to have committed violence against children and pregnant women. Due to his performance during the suppression of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising, Bl√∂sche was awarded the War Merit Cross 2nd Class with Swords. Bl√∂sche appears in several of the photographs in the Stroop Report. During his trial in East Germany, the photographs were used as circumstantial evidence for the prosecution. He was convicted of the murder of at least 2,000 people and executed in 1969. Of the photograph, Bl√∂sche stated: During the trial, the Judge asked Bl√∂sche about the events depicted in the infamous photograph: > Judge: \\"You were with a submachine gun...against a small boy that you > extracted from a building with his hands raised. How did those inhabitants > react in those moments?\\" Bl√∂sche: \\"They were in enormous dread.\\" Judge: > \\"This reflects well in that little boy. What did you think?\\" Bl√∂sche: \\"We > witnessed scenes like these daily. We could not even think.\\"Porat, Dan. The > Boy: A Holocaust Story (Hebrew). Dvir, 2013.  Legacy  sepia toning preserved in many digital reproductionsupright=1.25 upright=1.25 The New York Times published the picture on 26 December 1945 along with others from the Stroop Report, which had been entered into evidence at the Nuremberg Trial. On 27 December it reprinted the photograph, stating: The photograph was not well known until the 1970s, perhaps because most countries preferred to celebrate resistance to Nazism rather than the anonymous victims. In 1969, it appeared on the cover of the English edition of the work The Yellow Star. In 2016, Time Magazine listed it as one of the 100 most influential photographs of all time, stating that it had an \\"evidentiary impact\\" exceeding that of the many other \\"searing images\\" produced during the Holocaust; the child \\"has come to represent the face of the 6 million defenseless Jews killed by the Nazis\\". Several books have been written about the photograph, including A Child at Gunpoint: A Case Study in the Life of a Photo by Richard Raskin, The Boy: A Holocaust Story by Dan Porat, and L'Enfant juif de Varsovie. Histoire d'une photographie () by Fr√©d√©ric Rousseau. The photograph is perceived quite differently by the SS man who took it and other observers; in Raskin's words, \\"one set of men saw in that photograph heroic soldiers combating humanity's dregs while the vast majority of mankind sees here the gross inhumanity of man\\". According to Eva Fogelman, the photograph has promoted the myth that Jews went passively \\"like sheep to the slaughter\\". The image has been used in some controversial artwork juxtaposing the Warsaw Ghetto uprising with the Second Intifada in Gaza, which some argue is tantamount to Holocaust trivialization. In The Legacy of Abused Children: from Poland to Palestine by British-Israeli artist Alan Schechner, a camera zooms in on the boy in the photo, who is holding a different photograph of a child in Gaza being carried by IDF soldiers. Schechner stated that he did not intend to compare the Holocaust with the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict, but merely illustrate the suffering of children because of the cycle of violence in which trauma causes victims to become abusers. A different approach was used by Norman Finkelstein in a photo-essay titled \\"Deutschland √ºber alles\\", also juxtaposing the Warsaw photograph with images of Palestinian suffering. The subtitle read in all caps: \\"the grandchildren of Holocaust survivors are doing to the Palestinians exactly what was done to them by Nazi Germany\\". The Holocaust survivor and artist Samuel Bak has created a series of more than a hundred paintings inspired by the photograph, as well as by his own experiences and the memory of a lost childhood friend. In these works, the boy's extended arms are often depicted with a crucifixion theme or with the boy seen as a part of an imagined monument. Both NARA and IPN describe the image as in the public domain. However, in the 1990s Corbis Corporation acquired the photograph from Bettmann Archive and licensed three versions of it, charging commercial rates for its usage. , Getty Images, which acquired Corbis license rights in 2016, continues to offer it for sale, providing a copy of it with a copyright claim watermark as a sample.

The character was portrayed by Rajinikanth in Enthiran, as a cameo in Ra.One, and in 2.0. Chitti was imagined, created and developed by S. Shankar.  Concept and creation  The visual appearance of Chitti was based on the G.I. Joe action figures. For Chitti's 2.0 version look, its hair was spiked and brown coloured lenses were used for its eyes, whereas for its \\"good robot\\" look, green coloured lenses were used. The wig used for Chitti's 2.0 look had a silver streak in the middle, made out of yak hair, while its leather jacket was designed by Vogt. Suits made of copper were used for Chitti's costume. chitti is ten times stronger than a normal human being Fictional character biography =Early life= Chitti (played by Rajnikanth) is an humanoid robot created by Dr. Vaseegaran, (also played by Rajinikanth). Dr. Vaseegaran, who is specialised in robotics, created Chitti after a decade of intensive research. =Becoming Chitti= Chitti was first created without emotions however in order for the robot to understand human behaviour, Vaseegaran taught the robot about emotions. But then the robot fell in love with the scientist's fianc√©e, Sana (played by Aishwarya Rai) and thus it caused conflict between them. Angered by the robot, Vaseegaran literally chopped the robot into pieces. He was found by Dr. Bohra (played by Danny Denzongpa) and upgraded into 2.0 because of a red chip. He converts Chitti into a ruthless killer and then Chitti turned into a destructive killing machine and killed Bohra . He then went after Vaseegaran and Sana and crashed their wedding. He showed numerous other powerful abilities including shape shifting as well as duplicating. However, Vaseegaran managed to defeat and stop Chitti. Since, he caused so much damage and destruction to the city, he was de-activated and dismantled. His body parts were then displayed in the museum in the year 2030 as the most advanced humanoid robot ever built. =Helping G.One= Chitti reappeared in the film Ra.One in a special non- canon appearance and communicated with G.One (played by Shah Rukh Khan) with Rajnikanth reprising his role. =Battle over Fifth force= Chitti is forced to be reassembled by Dr. Vaseegaran and the Indian Army in order to stop the antagonist, Fifth force, which is controlled by Pakshirajan, an ornithologist (played by Akshay Kumar) turned into a vengeful spirit. But Chitti is defeated and destroyed in his original form by the antagonist, which leads his CPU head to being rebooted in another advanced mechanical body, identifying himself as Chitti reloaded version '2.0', and will also fall in love with his female counterpart, the super-android Nila (played by Amy Jackson), also created by Vaseegaran. Alongside Chitti, there is another robot created known as \\"Kutty\\" (3.0), which is a microbot capable of shape-shifting. Powers and abilities Chitti is described by Vaseegaran as an advanced \\"andro-humanoid\\" robot. Over his metallic body, he sports synthetic inorganic skin molded after Vaseegaran himself. He is designed with a speed capacity of 1 Terahertz (THz) and a memory capacity of 1 Zettabyte. Initially, Chitti has been programmed with almost all the existing world knowledge managed to put in computable terms in his CPU, thus he is knowledgeable and proficient in all forms of academia, martial arts, communication, creative outlets, athletic skills, and scientific ingenuity. Underneath his synthetic skin, he is fire, water, and acid- resistant. In his original form, he is partially resistant to severe damage such as gunshots, though he can still be damaged or destroyed by properly aimed and adequately forceful attacks such as being chopped with an axe in the joints. Severe electrocution can also overload short-circuit him. As long as his CPU head is still functioning, Chitti is able to repair or fix back his minor parts such as eyes. However, for large damage such as limbs being chopped off, he can only put them back in place and function at a much slower speed. Chitti's eyes are able to not only see and scan his surroundings to extremely acute detail, including X-ray vision, but they can also serve as high-definition projectors. His eyes also allow him to pick up additional skills and literature within seconds. He can also perform virtual phone calls, with displaying his caller or receiver through his eyes as a hologram. However, on downside, the eyes get bleached when exposed to flash light. Aside from Chitti's strength and durability, his most powerful weapon is his build in electromagnetic body, which can attract any metallic object and weaponize it. This and his connection to electronic devices give him enhanced technopathy and telekinesis. Chitti's only known weaknesses are flashing lights from photography or direct sunlight, which causes a \\"vision bleach\\" and temporarily distort his sight, and his susceptibility to battery drainage. However, in the case of the latter, he just needs to absorb a bare minimum amount of electric power to recharge himself in a matter of seconds.  Notes  Since 2.0 is a spiritual sequel that takes place in 2018 instead of 2030, there are a few differences. For example in Enthiran, the red chip which was used for Chitti version 2.0, only works when the robot is still functioning (Chitti was still alive and Bohra just had to fix his destroyed parts) as well as the need of updating \\"Neural Schema\\" in order for the red chip to function, but in 2.0, Chitti is depicted as emotionless in its normal self when it was damaged as it didn't need neural schema in its body.

This species was moved to Glyptoscelis by Jerez and Berti (1987), which would automatically make Dictyneis a synonym of Glyptoscelis. However, Jerez (1991) then designated Myochrous asperatus Blanchard, 1851 as the type species, which is considered invalid by Elgueta, Daccordi & Zoia (2017).

L. Vijay. It is a sequel to the 2016 film Devi. The film features Prabhu Deva and Tamannaah reprising their roles from the first film, along with Nandita Swetha, and Dimple Hayathi in the lead roles. Kovai Sarala, Ajmal Ameer, RJ Balaji, and Saptagiri play supporting roles. The film was simultaneously shot in Telugu as Abhinetri 2 (). The film released on 31 May 2019. Plot The movie starts where Krishna (Prabhu Deva) and his wife Devi (Tamannaah) arriving in Mauritius for Krishna's work, leaving their daughter with Devi's parents. As the story moves, Devi meets with Lawyer Lalitha (Kovai Sarala). They became friends that night. Krishna wakes up and closes the door which was open, but it opens again suddenly. Next, Devi becomes suspicious of Krishna because a colleague hugged him. She makes this as an issue and ask him to promise on their daughter's photo to which he says that it is casual and that he will not make a big deal out of it. Again in the middle of the night, Krishna wakes up and closes the door, but the door suddenly opens after he left. The next day, Devi sees Krishna with Sara (Nandita Swetha) and again became suspicious of Krishna. She asks him about it, but he replied that it was someone else and that he was at his office, and if there is any doubt about him, she can visit him in his office. The next day was their wedding day, but Krishna seems to have forgot it, so Devi was angry and did not give him lunch. On his way to his office, Krishna encounters a gang who warns him not to follow Sara. After sometime, Lalitha convinces Devi, so they both went to Krishna's office, where he was not there. On their way they again, they spot Krishna (who speaks Telugu) with Eesha (Dimple Hayathi). Lalitha mistakes Krishna going behind a girl because Devi does not have time for him after their childbirth, so Devi wears modern dress to impress him, but he mistakes it as Ruby (from the previous film). However, Krishna finds that it is Devi and tells her that he likes her as she is and loves her only, and that no woman will be in his life except her. He even promises on her daughter's photo. The couple goes out the next day as it was Sunday, where Krishna goes to buy ice cream but suddenly, Devi sees him with Sara again. The gang come to beat Krishna, but he escapes and is seen with Eesha. The gang tries to beat Krishna, but he gained the upper hand. While running behind a gang member, Krishna comes behind Devi with ice cream. Devi decides to find what is the mystery. The next scene starts with Devi following Sara, where it is shown that the latter is in band whose head is Rudra (Ajmal Ameer). Devi follows Sara and comes to know about Alex Britto (Prabhu Deva), who loves Sara but died. Next, we see Devi speaking with Eesha's father. She finds out about Ranga Reddy (Prabhu Deva), a person who wanted to marry Eesha but died in a car accident. Again, we see the door being opened. Krishna closes it, but Devi, who was still awoke, follows him and calls Alex and Ranga saying that he came. Devi then becomes terrified. The next morning, Devi asks Krishna to urgently leave Mauritius as her mother was sick, but it backfired. The two ghosts made an agreement with her and with Lalitha as the witness. The two ghosts say that they chose Krishna because of Ruby's recommendation (the contract is same as the first movie). On the first day, both Alex and Ranga possess him, which creates a confusion, so Devi made a new agreement which states that from 9AM to 3PM, Alex can use him; from 3PM to 9PM, Ranga can use him; and when both of their girls who they try to woo say, \\"I love you\\", they have to leave him alone; and Sundays are holidays. We then come to know that there is a concert happening on Monday . Devi and lalitha help the ghost to woo their girls respectively by cooking up stories that they were the same girls whom his brother loved and he is now mentally unstable because both their lovers died and ask the girls to say \\"I love you\\" so that he can return to his normal state. At last, the girls decide to say it, but then Ganesan / Ganesh (RJ Balaji / Saptagiri) comes and ruins everything. The next day was Sunday. When the couple went out, they see Eesha and Sara talking to Krishna, where the girls learn that Krishna is a not a crazy person and has been lying to them. A confused Krishna goes to his home with Devi where they are kidnapped, and it is revealed that Rudra is behind it and that he wanted to marry both of them for their money and that he killed both Ranga and Alex. Alex then escapes and tries to kill Ruda. Devi tries to stop him. Parallely, Lalitha meets Eesha and asks her to say \\"I love you\\", and Rudra meets Sara and asks her to say \\"I love you\\". On Krishna's way to kill Rudra, Devi begs him, to which Alex pushes her, and she cries suddenly. Raj Khanna (Sonu Sood) lifts her. It is revealed that he is the chief guest, and suddenly, a flashback rolls to the first film where he tells Krishna that if she cries, he will shoot him. Raj angrily follows Krishna to shoot him, and both ladies convey that they do not love Krishna but Ranga, and Sara still loves Alex. Both ghosts leave his body. However, Rudra spots Krishna and Raj. Both of them follow Krishna to kill him but mistakenly, Raj shoots Rudra instead of Krishna, and Krishna and Devi reconcile. At the final scene, we see that they both are leaving Mauritius, where Devi still has Ruby's nameplate.

Early years and education  Amalia Heredia Livermore was born in M√°laga, 1830. She was the tenth daughter of the industrialist Manuel Agust√≠n Heredia Mart√≠nez and Isabel Livermore Salas. From childhood, she received a careful education of Catholic roots typical of the bourgeoisie of the time. She grew up in a refined environment that would encourage her love of the fine arts and included numerous trips abroad. She became a cultured and intelligent woman. Career She married Marquis Jorge Loring Oyarz√°bal in 1850. He was a business entrepreneur. They had nine children. After marriage, she transformed her residence in La Concepci√≥n, M√°laga, into a botanical garden, thereby establishing Jard√≠n Bot√°nico La Concepci√≥n with her husband. She stood out for her philanthropy with several projects in Malaga including, assisting with the financing necessary to build the Hospital de San Juli√°n together with others, placing the first stone during the construction of the Civil Hospital (1862), and establishing the College of Asunci√≥n. Heredia Livermore and her husband acquired the tables of Lex Malacitana in order to start an archaeological collection, the Loringiano Museum. She was one of the founding partners of the Royal Spanish Society of Natural History. She was also a dame of the Order of Queen Maria Luisa. When the Sexenio Democr√°tico occurred, the couple supported the monarchist-liberal movement and moved to Madrid shortly before the Bourbon restoration. They were friends of the politician Antonio C√°novas del Castillo, who was a distant relative of hers. Oyarz√°bal died in 1900 and she died as well two years later.

The southern border is defined by the River Usk. The Brecon wards of St John and St David Within lie to the west, Felin-fach to the north and Talybont-on-Usk to the southwest. Since the 1999 elections the ward has elected one county councillor to Powys County Council (prior to this it had elected two county councillors). It is also a community ward, represented by up to five town councillors on Brecon Town Council. According to the 2011 UK Census the population of the ward was 3,111. In 2018 a Review of Electoral Arrangements proposed that all three Brecon county wards be merged into a single, three councillor ward. If accepted, the proposal would take effect from the 2022 election. County Council elections At the May 2017 Powys County Council elections the St Mary ward was won from the Liberal Democrats by Sarah Lewis of the Conservatives. Previous councillor Paul Ashton had chosen not to re-stand. However Cllr Lewis resigned in October 2019, in the resulting by-election the seat was won by Labour Party candidate Liz Rijnenberg. Cllr Ashton had represented the ward since a by-election in 2003. He subsequently retained his seat unopposed at the 2004 election and won the contests in 2008 and 2012.

He is professor emeritus of nuclear and subnuclear physics at the University of Milano- Bicocca.  Early life  Fiorini was born on 19 April 1933 in Verona. His father was the eminent surgeon Enoch Fiorini.  Career  Fiorini graduated in physics from the University of Milan in 1955. After working as a research associate at Duke University from 1959 to 1969, he returned to Milan for the remainder of his academic career, except for a spell in Geneva at CERN (1979-82). He carried out the bulk of his research in Italy at the underground laboratories of Mont Blanc and Gran Sasso.  Scientific achievements  Fiorini has a longstanding research interest in weak interactions and related phenomena. In the 1970s he collaborated with Andr√© Lagarrigue to create the Gargamelle detector, a giant bubble chamber at CERN, and with Carlo Rubbia and Riccardo Giacconi on neutrino experiments that contributed to the discovery of weak neutral currents, thereby providing the first empirical test of the electroweak theory. Fiorini is a pioneering investigator of neutrinoless double beta decay. In the 1960s he proposed and performed the first study of neutrinoless double beta decay (0ŒΩŒ≤Œ≤) in 76Ge using germanium diodes. In subsequent decades he was involved with two far larger collaborations at underground facility of the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso: the CUORICINO and CUORE studies of 130Te. The results of these experiments have relevance for the study of dark matter and solar axions. In the 1980s he directed the NUSEX (Nucleon Stability Experiment) investigation of proton decay located in the Mont Blanc underground laboratory. NUSEX helped determine the limits of proton stability, applying innovative methods to correct for the background effects of cosmic rays. Fiorini also collaborated on the GALLEX project at Gran Sasso that provided the first observations of low-energy neutrinos produced by the initial proton fusion step of the proton-proton chain reaction, confirming that this was the dominant fusion process occurring in the sun. His other research activities include the development of microbolometers for X-ray spectroscopy and high-precision measurements of the transition energies and lifetimes of nuclei, results which could help measure the mass of antineutrinos. More recently Fiorini has conducted several archaeometric studies, using non-destructive techniques such as neutron activation analysis to discover the properties of historical materials. He has proven, using samples of Napoleon's hair, that the former emperor did not die from arsenic poisoning. Another project demonstrated the provenance of lead ingots from a Roman shipwreck  before repurposing them for the lining of the CUORE detector.  Awards  Fiorini received the 2007 Enrico Fermi Prize in recognition for his work on weak neutral currents and solar neutrinos. For his work on neutrinoless double beta decay, he was awarded the 2012 Bruno Pontecorvo Prize. He has been a corresponding member of the since 1988.

It was added to the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 June 2004.  History  Martin Place was originally a small lane called Moore Street which ran between George Street and Pitt Street and was widened into a substantial thoroughfare as part of the setting for the General Post Office in 1891. In 1921, Moore Street was renamed Martin Place. In 1926, the Municipal Council of Sydney purchased a number of properties in Macquarie and Phillip Streets in anticipation of the extension of Martin Place to Macquarie Street, including those properties which would later be demolished for the Reserve Bank of Australia's head office building. After Martin Place was formed the residential land on either side of the street was auctioned in 1936 however, the properties between Phillip and Macquarie Streets were passed in and did not sell until after World War II. The closure of Martin Place to traffic occurred between 1968 and 1978 and it became a pedestrianised civic plaza. = History of the Reserve Bank = The Commonwealth Bank of Australia was established by legislation in 1911. The main functions of the bank were to undertake general banking and savings bank activities. In 1945 the bank's powers were formally widened to include exchange control and the administration of monetary and banking policy with the Commonwealth Bank Act and the Banking Act. The Reserve Bank Act 1959 preserved the original corporate body under the name of the Reserve Bank of Australia to carry on the central banking functions of the Commonwealth Bank, but separated commercial banking and savings banking activities into the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. The Reserve Bank has since then been Australia's central bank with its own Board, Governor and staff. The Reserve Bank has two broad responsibilities‚Äîmonetary policy and the maintenance of financial stability, including the stability of the payments system. The Bank's powers are vested in the Reserve Bank Board and the Payments System Board. In carrying out its responsibilities, the Bank is an active participant in financial markets and the payments system. It is also responsible for the printing and issuing of Australian currency notes. As well as being a policy- making body, the Reserve Bank is a large financial institution which provides selected banking and registry services to Australian Government and state government customers and some overseas official institutions. Its assets include Australia's holdings of gold and foreign exchange. The Bank is wholly owned by the Australian Government. A requirement of the Reserve Bank Act 1959 was that the head office of the bank must not be in the same building as the head office of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) or any other bank. In line with this requirement, separate buildings were constructed for the state capitals Darwin and Canberra. The Bank currently consists of a Head Office, located in Sydney, branches in Adelaide and Canberra, regional offices in Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth and representative offices in London and New York. = Reserve Bank site = The land on which the Reserve Bank is built, was in the 19th century occupied on by the first Wesleyan Chapel built in 1821 and subsequently used as a Unitarian Chapel in 1850, a Wesleyan School House also built in 1821 and purchased in 1843 by the Roman Catholic Church to be used as a school (demolished ). There was also a freestanding Georgian house occupied by a solicitor and a Georgian cottage. By the mid-1870s following the demolition of the church and school a row of three three-storey Italianate terrace houses known as \\"Lucretia Terrace\\" was erected (). The Georgian house was demolished and two four-storey late Victorian terrace houses were erected (1891). In the Georgian cottage was demolished and the cottage next door and two three-storey terraces were built; one of these was demolished in 1921 and a three-storey brick building known as \\"Whitehall\\" was erected on the site. In 1957, the Director-General of Works (Dr Lodge) suggested to the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank that the site at the top of Martin Place, owned by the Sydney City Council would be suitable for the construction of the head office of the Reserve Bank, and it was subsequently purchased for this purpose. The Bank's administrators called for a design for the building which was contemporary and international, to exemplify a post-war cultural shift away from an architectural emphasis on strength and stability towards a design that would signify the bank's ability to adapt its policies and techniques to the changing needs of its clientele. Before plans were drawn up representatives of the Reserve Bank and the Commonwealth Department of Works made detailed studies overseas into Reserve Bank planning and organisation. The Sydney Reserve Bank building was designed by the Commonwealth Department of Works, Bank and Special Project Division (Sydney) in 1959 under the direction of a Design Committee consisting of: C. Mc Growther, Superintendent of Reserve Bank Premises; H.I. Ashworth, Consulting Architect (Sydney University); C.D. Osborne, Director of Architecture Department of Works; R.M. Ure, Chief of Preliminary Planning, Department of Works; F.C. Crocker Architect in charge, Bank Section, Dept. of Works; and G.A. Rowe, Supervising Architect, Bank Section, Dept. of Works. The consulting engineer was D. Rudd and Partners and the builder was E.A. Watts Pty Limited. The site was cleared in 1961 and the building was completed by 1964 ready for occupation in January 1965. It was built to accommodate more than 1850 people at a cost of 10 million dollars. In a press release on the completion of the Reserve Bank headquarters building in Sydney, the then governor, Dr H.C. Coombs highlighted the contemporary design of the building: > \\"The massive walls and pillars used in the past to emphasise the strength > and permanence in bank buildings are not seen in the new head office... > Here, contemporary design and conceptions express our conviction that a > central bank should develop with growing knowledge and a changing > institutional structure and adapt its policies and techniques to the > changing community within which it works\\". The Reserve Bank design is characteristic of buildings of this era on less constrained sites, where the architect utilised the opportunity to define the base from the shaft using a podium. The building was constructed using a steel frame supporting reinforced concrete floor slabs (using lightweight concrete). This was a solution to the need to produce an economical structural system using a combination of steel and concrete. The materials used in construction of the Reserve Bank were to be of Australian origin and manufacture. Externally, maintenance and durability determined the choice of marble, granite, aluminium and glass. The facade of the tower had the structural and functional columns expressed as vertical Imperial black granite shafts with Wombeyan marble spandrel panels. The white marble faced pre-cast concrete spandrel panels alternated with recessed windows between the granite columns. The 1st, 2nd and 3rd-floor perimeter beams were faced with Wombeyan marble with a recessed glazed screen wall to the office areas behind a balcony. Internally decorative ceilings which emphasised the structural bays appeared in buildings of the 1960s and were used in the Reserve Bank. Impressive aluminium decorative ceiling panels emphasised the structural bays of the ground floor public space and lift lobby. The entry and forecourt were paved in Narranderra Grey marble, marble being the most popular stone throughout this period. The ground floor lift lobby walls and internal walls facing the forecourt were clad in Wombeyan marble. The east and west walls of the entry vestibule were clad in Imperial black granite. Prestige areas for the conduct of important company business in buildings of this period generally had ceilings treated in the same manner as general office ceilings, the exception being the board rooms and executive areas, as is the case in the Reserve Bank where shallow, curved plaster vaults enriched the space. The floor of the board room was paved in Wombeyan white marble. Specially woven heavy-duty wool carpet manufactured in Australia was used in the general office and executive areas. Walls of the period were often timber panelled, in the Reserve Bank special areas had demountable timber panelling in Queensland black bean and Tasmanian blackwood. The ground floor, and sometimes mezzanine or first floor levels, of many buildings of this period, accommodated service-based commerce. Often this activity represented a public interface for the owner/occupants of the building. The Reserve Bank was constructed with a four-storey podium divided into two upper floors with projecting horizontal fins and two floors of full height recessed glazing to the mezzanine below. This contained the two-storey public area and the banking chamber in the mezzanine over. Also included in public areas of a number of office buildings of this period was an auditorium or theatrette, and one was included in the Sydney Reserve Bank. Also included were two residential flats to accommodate senior executives travelling from interstate, a relatively uncommon feature for office buildings of this period. The building was the central distribution point for notes and coin for New South Wales and Papua New Guinea and the basement included the vaults or strongrooms. They were innovative in their use of concrete and metal sheet to create an impenetrable surround for the strong rooms. The metal strongroom doors are also significant for their size and sophistication. The Reserve Bank was a prestigious and desirable place to work. There was a strong staff hierarchy and senior positions had considerable community status. This status is demonstrated in physical terms by the design of executive and staff areas in the building. In the 1960s the building was known to provide more extensive staff facilities compared with other contemporary buildings. In this building they consisted of the cafeteria, executive and Board dining rooms, the staff lounge, the staff library, a medical suite, squash courts and associated amenities, an auditorium and an observation deck on the 20th level for the use of staff and ex-staff. A firing range was provided for the training of security guards. The provision of the squash courts and the medical centre would appear to be uncommon facilities provided in multi-storey buildings of this period. Care was often taken in selecting finishes to areas of staff relaxation, special ceiling finishes were occasionally applied, such as in the case of the Reserve Bank third floor cafeteria where the ceiling was plaster domes in a square grid. Occasionally stone veneers were applied to the walls of these areas, such as in the staff lounge of the Reserve Bank, where slate was used as the wall finish. The service areas were designed for ease of cleaning and minimal maintenance with vinyl and ceramic tile finishes popular for both floors and walls. The Reserve Bank used ceramic tiles and vinyl to line the walls of service areas and vaults. The floors of the computer and service areas were of vinyl. The Reserve Bank used terrazzo as a floor finish in the toilets. Terrazzo was often used in this way in more prestigious 1960s developments. The Reserve Bank is also notable for the incorporation of a fire sprinkler system, smoke detectors and fire alarms throughout. All working areas of the building were airconditioned, and notably, the ceiling in the cafeteria was perforated to form a ventilated ceiling which acts as a low- velocity supply air plenum. The lighting of the Reserve Bank was also notable. Wallwashers were used in the Reserve Bank, where a perimeter strip of recessed fluorescents served to visually detach the ceiling from the wall in the passages and reception area. The opposite effect, that gained by concealing strip fluorescents where they would throw light upwards onto the ceiling, was more uncommon but was used in the office of the Governor of the Reserve Bank. Recessed downlights, both fluorescent and incandescent, were a popular means of lighting areas such as lift lobbies, passages and other public spaces where a softer light than that provided in the general office areas was appropriate, as was the case in the Reserve Bank. Of note was the use of recessed downlights in the cafeteria, set into the interstices of the square grid formed by the shallow cast plaster domes. The lighting of a decorative ceiling was a further area of exploration by architects and lighting engineers of the period. Usually, in the major public area of an office building, elaborate decorative ceilings could be either integrated into the lighting design or the subject of it. The latter was used in the Reserve Bank banking chamber public areas where the lighting is the focus of the decorative ceiling bays. The exterior Reserve Bank emblem was lit by shaped cold cathode tubes which follow the outline of the emblem. The detailed aesthetic design input into the building extended beyond the building structure and facade treatments and interior design and included ancillary fixtures, fittings and objects for use specifically within the building. These included artworks specially commissioned for the public spaces, furniture, china, flatware, silverware, napery and accessories specifically selected or designed for use within the building. The interior decor and furniture were designed by the Department of Works R.M. Ure and I. Managan, with Frederick Ward, Industrial designer. Interior furnishings including tables, chairs, couches, credenzas and desks were designed by Fred Ward. Fred Ward (1900‚Äì1990) was one of the leaders in modern Australian industrial design of the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s. During the 1950s, Ward was head of the Australian National University's design department. Around 1961 he resigned from ANU to set up private practice, after being invited by the Reserve Bank Governor Dr H.C. Coombs to undertake the furnishings of several Reserve Bank buildings including Sydney, Canberra, Adelaide and Port Morseby. His furnishings are of a simple and functional design which are now considered to be pieces of art in themselves. Ward also designed the furniture for numerous other important buildings including University House, Canberra, the Academy of Science Building, Canberra and the National Library of Australia, Canberra (with Arthur Robinson). To further enhance the prestige of the building works of art by Australian artists and sculptors were used. Following an Australia-wide competition, the first prize winners were commissioned to execute their works for the Reserve Bank. The lift foyer features a wall relief by Bim Hilder and the freestanding podium sculpture in Martin Place is by Margel Hinder. Both sculptors were actively engaged in the post-war period designing works for multi-storied office buildings and there was a high degree of co-operation between the artists and architects at this period. Prestige buildings of this period generally commissioned public art highlighting the high profile of the buildings in company marketing strategies and also possibly arising from benevolent policies of these companies. Bim (Vernon Arthur) Hilder (1909‚Äì1990) trained at the East Sydney Technical College and first exhibited his sculptures in 1945. Hilder had worked as a carpenter for Walter Burley Griffin. His murals were styled \\"wall enrichments in metal\\". Aside from the Reserve Bank mural (1962‚Äì64) he also designed the large mural on the facade of the Wagga Wagga Civic Theatre (1963) and a memorial fountain to Walter Burley Griffin in Willoughby City area (1965). His work is represented in the Art Gallery of New South Wales and the University of New England. Margel Hinder (1906‚Äì1995) was American born moving later to New South Wales. Along with her husband Frank, they contributed to the development of Modernist Australian art focusing on abstraction. They were contemporaries of the Lewers, Ralph Balson, Yvonne Audette, Carl Plate, and Tony Tuckson. Margel Hinder's work is represented in every major Australian Gallery. Her major commissions include the James Cook Memorial Fountain, Newcastle (1966), Northpoint Tower (1970) (now at Macquarie University, Sydney); Woden City Plaza, Canberra; the Western Assurance Co. Building, Sydney (1960); and the State Office Block, Sydney (demolished). Hinder received an Order of Australia in 1979. Clay from the excavations for the Bank from its initial construction and extension was set aside for the production of a series of commemorative handcrafted pots. These were commissioned from Henry A. Le Grand of Canberra, some were purchased by officers of the Bank and the others were used as decorative elements in the executive suites and remain in the building. A specially woven tapestry, 10 ft by 5 ft for the Board Room was designed by Margo Lewers and woven in France at the Aubusson workshop in 1968. Entitled \\"Wide Penetration\\" the abstract design in blue and yellow was woven in a limited edition of three copies. The tapestry is no longer hung in the Board Room but remains in the Bank's extensive art collection. A second specially commissioned tapestry was made in 1988 by Sue Batten for display in the Board Room. The tapestry was woven at the Victorian tapestry workshop and the design was inspired by the Bank's Charter and includes elements from the paper 5 dollar note. The tapestry is now hung in the currency display area on the ground floor. A series of paintings by Australian artists were purchased by the Bank over a period of time and found their permanent home in the executive offices, foyers and hallways of the bank. On Macquarie Street was a setback created to enable the establishment of a formal Australian Native garden which was designed as the result of a public competition won by Melbourne architect, Malcolm Munro. The garden was flanked on either side by shallow pools and had ornamental gravel surrounds. It was planted with Australian shrubs. This garden feature has now been replaced with landscaping including formal box hedges and flowering shrubs. = Alterations to the building = Between 1974 and 1980 the Reserve Bank was extended to the south, this extension to the original building involved substantial additions on each floor to incorporate the adjacent site to the south. The site consisted of two properties Washington House and Federation House, both properties were demolished for the extension. The addition replicated the original building in height, form, and finishes. From 1991‚Äì1995 upgrading of offices and basement areas, removal of asbestos requiring the stripping of all internal finishes, upgrading of building services and fire protection facilities, new ceilings, lighting and carpets and the extensive restoration and recladding of the external facade of the building. In November 1993 the original facades were overclad. The original Wombeyan marble cladding was deteriorating due to a combination of weathering and pollution. The new facade was a combination of Australian and Italian stone, with the original Imperial Black granite from South Australia being used for the Columns and Italian Bianco Sardo grey granite for the spandrels. The work was designed by Arup Facade Engineering and was designed to have a minimum visual impact on the building. At the same time, the eastern end of the ground floor was modified from a banking chamber to form the public exhibition area. In 2000 the Parliamentary Committee on Public Works approved changes to the building included conversion of the staff cafeteria, auditorium and staff facilities (level 3) to office accommodation; demolition of the two residential flats and creation of new cafeteria space; removal of the two squash courts and plant equipment (level 17) and conversion to office use including lowering of the high level windowsills to the north elevation and enlarging of existing recessed marble panels to windows on the south facade; conversion of level 19 ancillary space to office use; and removal of the firing range.  Description  The building's address on an exterior wall, 2008 The Reserve Bank building is at 65 Martin Place, corners with Macquarie and Phillip Streets, Sydney, a prominent corner position fronting Martin Place between Macquarie Street and Phillip Street. The Reserve Bank 1964, is a refined example of the Post War International style. The building is a 22-storey high-rise tower with three-level basement. It is constructed of a steel frame concrete encased with reinforced concrete slabs. The building contains some unusually long cantilever beams on the 1st to 3rd floors. The Reserve Bank provides a notable example of a characteristic of buildings of this era on less constrained sites, where the architect utilised the opportunity to define the base from the shaft using a podium. The Reserve Bank has a four-storey podium divided into two upper floors with projecting horizontal fins and two floors of full height recessed glazing to the mezzanine below. The building is entered via a bronzed railed grey and black granite terrace with steps to accommodate the site slope and adjacent footpath. The tower section above the second floor is set back from the site boundaries on the three street frontages. The rectangular building floor plate surrounds a central bank of lifts. The tower is capped with recessed balconies to level 20. Above this is a roof terrace with full height glazing and extensive cantilever roof. The facade treatment of the building is distinctive and derives from both the modular design created to allow office subdivision which is expressed in the window mullions and the use of materials including the extensive use of natural stone. The vertical columns faced in black granite and aluminium define the eight bays of the tower and extend up to form the supports for the balconies. The use of black polished granite cladding was a popular choice of the time, the Reserve Bank used Imperial Black granite for the columns. The subdivision of the facade into smaller vertical bays was characteristic of buildings where sun control was a central concern. Between the columns spandrel panels in grey granite alternated with recessed glazing. The glazing panels stop short of the corner. The basements contain vehicular access areas, the main switchboard as well as the three main strongrooms and a series of voucher stores and cash handling areas. Originally they also contained extensive plant areas. The Strong Rooms are located in the basement originally used for the storage of bullion and cash. They have a degree of technical significance for their innovative use of concrete and metal sheet to create an impenetrable surround for the strong rooms. The metal strong room doors are significant for their size and sophistication. The ground floor is symmetrical around the central main vestibule which is a two-storey volume with a general banking chamber on the western side and a public display area on the eastern side. The display area replaces the former Bonds and Stock Banking Chamber of the original design. The ground level entrance foyer/vestibule remains substantially intact including internal finishes of Wombeyan marble to the south wall, granite floor, east and west Imperial granite walls including high-level glazing, anodised aluminium ceiling and the south wall relief by Bim Hilder. Alterations include the introduction of a security desk, new entrance doors, and reconfigured glazing. The mezzanine is set back from Martin Place frontage creating an atrium over the ground floor. With the first and second floors it forms a podium from which the office tower springs. The third floor housed the staff amenities area with a staff cafeteria and kitchen, an auditorium and staff library and a staff lounge outside the lift foyer. These areas were originally designed with a distinctive character which has now been altered by later refurbishments. The eleventh floor contains the board room (featuring a marble floor), board dining room, board members common room and reception and meeting areas. The twelfth floor contains the governor's suite, reception areas and executive suites. The 16th floor housed two residential flats, but the flats have been removed in recent works. The floor also included the medical centre. The 17th to 19th floors held two squash courts and an observation gallery was located along the northern facade. These were all removed in recent works. The 20th floor houses staff amenities. Most lift foyers are marble lined, Level 3 is timber. Some of the original furniture designed for the building including tables, chairs, couches, credenzas and desks remain within the public spaces, offices and special areas of the building. The Westpac (former Bank of NSW) building erected on the opposite corner to the Reserve Bank occupies a similar footprint and has a similar mass, providing a gateway effect at the top of Martin Place. = Public art = The main entrance foyer features an expansive wall relief by Bim Hilder. It is made up of many separate small parts of beaten copper and bronze. One section of it incorporates a six-inch piece of quartz crystal uncovered by geologist Ben Flounders in South Australia's Corunna Hills. Another displays semi-precious stones. The Martin Place forecourt features a freestanding podium sculpture by Margel Hinder. The Podium sculpture is a 26 ft high freestanding sculpture. It is unnamed and has no banking reference, but was designed to complement the architecture of the building. It is welded sheet copper on a stainless steel structural frame with molten copper decoration. The original design Maquette is also located in the Bank. Other important elements include the brass lettering text of the Bank's 1959 charter set on a black granite wall in the main foyer; the opening commemorative plaque; the Bank emblem originally located on the western parapet wall of the building constructed in cast aluminium with green enamelled finish designed by Gordon Andrews (now removed); the portrait of Dr H. C Coombs, the first Governor by Louis Kahan purchased in 1964. = Condition = In general, the building retains its early appearance and character despite having undergone considerable alterations and modification. Internal finishes have been considerably altered in many locations, and have been replaced with new finishes. Internally the building has been remodelled at the upper office levels. The boardroom and the lift foyers have remained largely intact. The ground level double volume spaces are intact; however, there has been substantial alteration to furniture and fittings. The original marble ceiling panel has been replaced in metal. = Comparison = In addition to the Head Office, branch offices were constructed in the central business districts of each of the state capital cities, as well as in Canberra and Darwin during the 1960s and 1970s. A number of purpose-designed office buildings were erected to designs by the Commonwealth Department of Works Banks and Special Projects Branch as part of the initial establishment of the Reserve Bank of Australia. The buildings in Darwin and Brisbane have been sold. The Reserve Bank still owns the buildings in Perth and Hobart (sold 2001), Adelaide, Canberra, and Melbourne. The buildings constructed throughout Australia by the Bank during the 1960s reflected a confidence in things Australian and in the future. The Canberra Branch building of the Reserve Bank was the result of an architectural competition, managed by the National Capital Development Commission. Howlett and Bailey from Perth won the competition from 131 submissions. It was constructed by Civil & Civic and completed in 1965. Also of a contemporary design, the Canberra building is in the Stripped classical style. The architectural qualities of the Canberra Reserve Bank building rely on the lightness of the structure, the regular structural pattern, the contrast between the marble-faced columns and beams and the receding pattern of the glazing. The vertical effect imparted by the columns extending over two levels gives the low rise building a sense of height and is most effective. The columns are cruciform in plan and support a beam carefully separated from the column. The glazed curtain wall is supported on the beam and uses aluminium mullions. The very strong, blank wall of the secure ground floor cash handling area on the external southeastern side of the building is another powerful reminder of its modernist qualities where the internal function gains external expression. Internally the most important space is the banking chamber. It is a symmetrical design with a central entrance under a canopy with black slate entrance floor, converting into carpet once inside the room. The Reserve Bank, Adelaide, was built in 1963-65 to a design by the Commonwealth Department of Works architects C.D. Osborne, R.M. Ure, G.A. Row and F.J. Crocker. It is constructed from largely Australian building materials of high quality including Wombeyan marble, South Australian black granite and Victorian Harcourt grey granite. Of particular interest is the building's inward curving wall to both the east and west elevations.  Heritage listing  Signage on the building, 2008 The Reserve Bank building (1964) designed by the Commonwealth Department of Works, Bank and Special Project Section, is highly significant in the development of post World War II multi-storey office buildings in Australia. It is a significant example of a 1960s office building notable as being a well-designed example of the International style; its construction using high-quality Australian materials; steel and concrete construction; and interior design details and artworks. The building's significance has been retained through a major extension (1974‚Äì1980), recladding (1993) and internal refitting. Through its prestigious design and function as Australia's central bank, the building makes an important contribution to the streetscape and character of Martin Place, Macquarie Street and Phillip Street. Reserve Bank was listed on the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 June 2004 having satisfied the following criteria. Criterion A: Processes The Reserve Bank building (1964) designed by the Commonwealth Department of Works, Bank and Special Project Section, is highly significant in the development of post World War II multistorey office buildings in Australia. The building's significance has been retained through a major extension (1974‚Äì1980), recladding (1993) and internal refitting. The Reserve Bank building is of historical significance in its ability to demonstrate the changing functions and role of the Reserve Bank of Australia, particularly that of the head office, since 1964. The International style of the building represents the post-war cultural shift within the banking industry, away from the traditional architectural emphasis on strength and stability towards a more contemporary and international style. The two foyer artworks are of historical and aesthetic significance. The artworks by Bim Hilder and Margel Hinder are significant examples of Australian modernist sculpture of this period by two significant artists, who were selected as the winners of design competitions by the Reserve Bank. The furnishings by Fred Ward are of historical and aesthetic significance. Designed for the building by Ward, who was one of the leaders in modern Australian industrial design at this time, the furnishings are of a simple and functional design which are now considered to be pieces of art in themselves. When constructed elements of the mechanical and electrical services within the building were considered advanced and innovative, and although many elements have been removed or substantially altered, their incorporation in the building is still of interest today, this included the fire sprinkler system, smoke detectors and fire alarms; interior and signage lighting; and airconditioning. The provision of two residential flats, for use by visitors to the bank; squash courts; and firing range were relatively uncommon for the time (all removed 2001). The two doors to the main strongroom were at the time of construction the largest and most technically advanced in the southern hemisphere. Criterion B: Rarity When constructed elements of the mechanical and electrical services within the building were considered advanced and innovative, and although many elements have been removed or substantially altered, their incorporation in the building is still of interest today, this included the fire sprinkler system, smoke detectors and fire alarms; interior and signage lighting; and airconditioning.

The site has been protected by the central government as a National Historic Site since 2009. It was also known as Background Masuyama Castle is located on a 120-meter hill in the mountainous area which separates the Toyami Plain from the Toyama Plain in Etch≈´ Province. The Hokuriku kaid≈ç, a highway which connected Kyoto with the Hokuriku region, passed Kurikara Pass at the border of Kaga Province and followed the Shokawa river to Toyama Bay and avoided this area by taking a coastal route. However, the more direct route passed through this hilly area and Masuyama Castle was located to guard this strategic area. Masuyama Castle is a regarded as one of three major mountain castles of Etch≈´ Province along with Moriyama Castle near the Noto Peninsula and Matsukura Castle in Uozu area. History The foundation of Masuyama Castle was founded during the Nanboku-cho period by Momonoi Tadatsuna (d.1376), the shugo of Etch≈´ Province. The name Wada Castle came from the nearby Wada River. Momonoi later revolted against the Ashikaga shogunate, and the castle was seized by a shogunal army and awarded to the Ninomiya clan, but the castle fell into ruins shortly after the conclusion of the campaign. Around a hundred years later, the castle was rebuilt as a stronghold of the Jinb≈ç clan, retainers of the Hatakeyama clan, who had been awarded with the position of shugo of Etch≈´ Province. The Hatakeyama preferred to rule in absentia from Kyoto, and the province was sub-divided between the Jinb≈ç, Shiina and Yusa clans to administer on their behalf. By the end of 15th century, Hatakeyama clan was significantly weaker and unable to exert their authority over Etch≈´. Jinbo Yoshimune (d. 1531) attempted to ally with the Ikk≈ç-ikki movement and to become independent, but was crushed by the Hatakeyama and by the forces of the Uesugi clan from neighbouring Echigo. However, his son Jinb≈ç Nagatomo (d.1572) took advantage of internal conflicts within the Hatakeyama and the Uesugi and surpassed the rival Shiina clan, uniting the province and established Toyama Castle, with Masuyama Castle remaining an important secondary centre. Nevertheless, the Uesugi under Uesugi Kenshin invaded Etchu in 1559 and seized both Toyama and Masuyama. He was forced to retake it again in 1562 and in 1576. After Kenshin's death, the area came under the control of Oda Nobunaga, who assigned Etchu to Shibata Katsuie. The Oda army attacked Masuyama and destroyed its j≈çkamachi in 1581. The castle was subsequently restored by Sassa Narimasa in 1582. Narimasa's situation was unstable. A direct bannerman of Nobunaga, he served Toyotomi Hideyoshi reluctantly, and was later sent to Higo Province in Kyushu, with Masuyama Castle being awarded to Maeda Toshiie. After the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate, the castle was finally abolished around 1610. Current situation Masuyama castle spread over a hill enclosing an area 1,000 meter long and 500 meter width, making it one of the largest mountain castles in Hokuriku region. At the western hillside opposite the river was the castle town, and remnants of a clay wall separating the castle town from the castle still remains. All of the structures of Masuyama Castle have long been lost and only some remnants of dry moats and the lines of the clay ramparts remain. The site is open to the public. The castle was listed as one of the Continued Top 100 Japanese Castles in 2017.

It was designed and built by the Metropolitan Board of Water Supply and Sewerage in 1915. It is also known as Wahroonga Reservoir (Elevated) (WS 0124). The property is owned by Sydney Water, a State-owned statutory corporation of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 November 1999.  History  = Northern Suburbs supply = When the Board of Water Supply and Sewerage took over from Sydney City Council in 1888, the only supply to the northern suburbs was by a submarine main from Dawes Point to Milsons Point, taking water by gravitation from Paddington Reservoir. The level of Paddington Reservoir limited supply to the lower areas of Northern Suburbs. In 1888, in order to overcome this problem, the Board erected a pumping station in Junction Street, , with two storage tanks in the grounds of St. Thomas' Church, to meet demand for the higher parts of North Sydney. The plant was dismantled in 1892, the pump being transferred to Carlton and the tanks to Wahroonga (not extant). The above submarine main was abandoned in 1917. In 1892 the Ryde Pumping Station was commissioned, supplied by mains from Potts Hill (via Rookwood Cemetery, along the Concord Peninsula and attached to the 1889 railway bridge at Meadowbank), with reservoirs at Ryde Pumping Station (disused 1930) and Ryde Hill and then by mains to a pair of reservoirs at Chatswood (previously constructed in 1888). With increasing population of the North Shore, brought about by the construction of the railway, new storage reservoirs were required. The tanks, originally at North Sydney, were transferred to Wahroonga in 1896. A steam powered pumping station was erected at Chatswood in 1895 for the supply of Wahroonga. A new steel surface reservoir was constructed at Wahroonga in 1898 (Wahroonga Reservoir No. 1 WS 123). From Wahroonga the main from Chatswood extended to Hornsby, with a branch to Thornleigh and Beecroft. The mains from Chatswood to Wahroonga had deteriorated by 1905, necessitating new direct mains from Ryde to Wahroonga, and from Chatswood to Pymble to connect to former. Wahroonga Reservoir (Elevated) WS 0124 was erected in 1915. A main to Mobbs Hill was constructed in 1916. It was extended to Beecroft and Wahroonga in 1918, superseding the Ryde Wahroonga Main which was now too small. A Pumping Station was erected at Wahroonga for the elevated tank (Wahroonga Reservoir (Elevated) WS 124 in 1935. New mains were constructed from Ryde to Wahroonga in 1937 for the new reservoir (Wahroonga Reservoir No. 3 WS 125), with connection to Pymble.  Description  The Reservoir (Elevated) WS 124), situated at 1678 Pacific Highway, is an unusual and unique reservoir in the Sydney Water Supply System. It has a cylindrical elevated riveted steel tank, with an original roof and a spherical or rounded base, all constructed in riveted steel plate. The reservoir is supported on an eight legged, H section, steel girder riveted frame, with horizontal and diagonal bracing. The top of the reservoir is reached by a stairway up the inside of the frame, with a walkway at the top of the frame (attached by triangular riveted plates) and a stairway to the roof of the reservoir. The whole structure is a fine example of riveted steel design and technology, surviving intact for more than 85 years. It is a prominent local landmark. Standard features include: davit, trigonometric station, access stairway, handrails and inlet and outlet valve chambers. Adjacent to the reservoir is a storage tank constructed with riveted steel plates. Directly opposite the site containing Reservoir (Elevated) WS 124, on the corner of Woonona Avenue and the Pacific Highway, is a large building with high brick walls, the \\"Woonona Avenue\\" site referred to in the heritage document. No indication of its purpose is given on the outside of the building. It probably houses the \\"pumping station\\" referred to in the History section, above. Significant plantings at 1678 Pacific Highway include: cypress, jacaranda and Illawarra flame tree. The full service level is and the capacity of the reservoir is . = Modifications and dates = The reservoir is in good condition and intact.  Heritage listing  As at 7 September 2016, Wahroonga Reservoir (Elevated) WS 124 is an unusual and unique reservoir in the Sydney Water Supply System. The whole structure is a fine example of riveted steel design and technology, surviving intact. It is a distinct local landmark. The reservoirs at Wahroonga demonstrate the variety of reservoir construction techniques used by the MWS & DB, the engineering expertise available to the Board as well as the growth in demand in the Northern Suburbs from 1898 onwards, now more than 100 years of growth. Wahroonga reservoirs have played a major role in the supply of water to the Northern Suburbs. Wahroonga Reservoir was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 November 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.

It is found in tropical waters of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. This is a common species of coral with a widespread distribution, and the main threat it faces is from the destruction of its coral reef habitats. It is rated as a \\"least-concern species\\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. This species was first described in 1846 as Favia pallida by the American zoologist James Dwight Dana; it was later transferred to the genus Dipsastraea, but some authorities continue to use the original name. Description Dipsastraea pallida is a colonial coral forming solid rounded mounds. In shallow water, the corallites (stony cups in which the polyps sit) are circular and set closely together, while in deeper water locations, they are more scattered. The septa (radiating vertical plates forming part of the corallite wall) are widely spaced and often irregular. The palliform lobes (blades rising from the inner margins of the septa) are small. This coral is usually cream-coloured, green or pale yellow, the oral discs of the polyps often being a contrasting colour. Distribution and habitat Dipsastraea pallida has a widespread distribution in the tropical Indian Ocean and the western Pacific Ocean. Its range extends from the East African coast, Madagascar, the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, through the Indian Ocean to southeastern Asia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Japan and the South China Sea, western, northern and eastern Australia and various archipelagoes in the western Pacific Ocean. It is found in various rocky reef habitats and is often the dominant species on the fringes of back reefs. It occurs at depths down to or more. Ecology Dipsastraea pallida is one of several species of corals in the Indo-Pacific region that are bioeroded by the sponge Cliona orientalis, which tunnels into its skeletal structure. Status This coral is collected for the reef aquarium trade, with a quota of around 5000 live pieces exported per annum from Indonesia, the main exporter. However, this is a common species with a wide range and presumed large total population, and the largest threats it faces come from habitat loss, climate change and ocean acidification. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\".

The reservoirs are also known as Pymble Reservoir No. 1 (Covered) (WS 0097) and (WS 0097); and Pymble Reservoir No. 2 (Covered) (WS 0098) and (WS 0098). The property is owned by Sydney Water, a State-owned statutory corporation of the Government of New South Wales. The reservoirs were added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 15 November 2002.  History  = Northern Suburbs Supply = When the Board of Water Supply and Sewerage took over from Sydney City Council in 1888, the only supply to the northern suburbs was by a submarine main from Dawes Point to Milsons Point, taking water by gravitation from Paddington Reservoir. The level of Paddington Reservoir limited supply to the lower areas of Northern Suburbs. In 1888, in order to overcome this problem, the Board erected a pumping station in Junction Street, , with two storage tanks in the grounds of St. Thomas' Church, to meet demand for the higher parts of North Sydney. The plant was dismantled in 1892, the pump being transferred to Carlton and the tanks to Wahroonga. The above submarine main was abandoned in 1917. In 1892 the Ryde Pumping Station was commissioned, supplied by mains from Potts Hill (via Rookwood Cemetery, along the Concord Peninsula and attached to the 1889 railway bridge at Meadowbank), with reservoirs at Ryde Pumping Station (disused 1930) and Ryde Hill and then by mains to a pair of reservoirs at Chatswood (previously constructed in 1888). With increasing population of the North Shore, brought about by the construction of the railway, new storage reservoirs were required. The tanks, originally at N Sydney, were transferred to Wahroonga in 1896. A steam powered pumping station was erected at Chatswood in 1895 for the supply of Wahroonga. A new steel surface reservoir was constructed at Wahroonga in 1898. From Wahroonga the main from Chatswood extended to Hornsby, with a branch to Thornleigh and Beecroft. Both Pymble Reservoir No. 1 and Pymble Reservoir No. 2 were constructed in 1900 to meet local supply. The mains from Chatswood to Wahroonga had deteriorated by 1905, necessitating new direct mains from Ryde to Wahroonga, and from Chatswood to Pymble to connect to the former main.  Description  =Reservoir No. 1= Pymble Reservoir No.1 (Covered) (WS 97) is a circular brick covered reservoir with an octagonal brick entrance chamber constructed at the centre of its roof. The entrance chamber has a concial Marseilles tile roof. The reservoir has cast iron roof ventilation caps, as at Petersham Reservoir (Covered) (WS 89), Waverley Reservoir No. 1 (Covered) (WS 132) and the Randwick Reservoir (WS 001). Adjacent to the reservoir, on the Telegraph Road frontage is an octagonal valve house, of rendered brick, with parapet and flat roof. The valve house has a steel grated floor and an access ladder to the valve below. Plantings include oleander. The site is occupied by the Pymble Bowling Club clubhouse, while the adjacent covered reservoir (Pymble Reservoir No. 2 (Covered) (WS 98)) is used as the bowling green for the club. The recreational and open space usage of the roof of the reservoir is a historical and important feature of most covered reservoirs. The full service level of Pymble Reservoir No.1 (Covered) (WS 97) is and its capacity is . =Reservoir No. 2= Pymble Reservoir No. 2 (Covered) (WS 98) is a fine example of a concrete covered reservoir in an earthen embankment, or partly excavated into rock. The roof of the reservoir is grassed over and is now used as bowling greens by Pymble Bowling Club. The only apparent sign of the covered reservoir from the bowling greens is the pair of ventilation shafts in the likeness of cast iron gateposts, similar to those erected at Waverley Reservoir No. 2 (Covered) (WS 133). The recreational and open space usage of the roof of the reservoir is a historical and important feature of most covered reservoirs. The south side of the reservoir is the location for three valve houses, one large example, central to the side, with two smaller valve houses flanking it. Each valve house is constructed in rendered brick, with parapet and flat roof, the walls cut into the embankment of the reservoir. All the valve houses contain original valves and control gear. The main valve house contains provision for six valves and control mechanisms, some of which have been updated. The two flanking valve houses have a pair of valves and control gear. The original valve control gear is similar to that at Petersham Reservoir (Covered) (WS 89). The full service level of Pymble Reservoir No. 2 (Covered) (WS 98) is and its capacity is . = Modifications and dates = Pool-type fencing added in the late 20th century.  Heritage listing  As at 2 December 2002, Pymble Reservoirs No. 1 (Covered) and No. 2 (Covered) are two reservoirs of a small group of covered reservoirs. Together they demonstrate the variation and development in construction technology and the high level of engineering skill available to the MWS&DB.; The two reservoirs on the Pacific Highway at Pymble form an important group of covered reservoirs, integral with fine examples of valve houses. The valve houses preserve their original valve control gear, which is extremely rare in the SWC system. All covered reservoirs are highly significant within the Sydney system, since all differ in construction technology, design and architectural detailing. All therefore contribute to our understanding of the development of covered reservoirs in NSW. The listing includes both the reservoirs and all associated features, pipework, valves and valve houses to the property boundary. Pymble Reservoirs No. 1 and No. 2 were listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 15 November 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.

Patriarch Thomas held a firm Orthodox theological position and opposed the iconoclasts and the filioque. He is considered a saint, commemorated in May 16. Life Prior to his election as patriarch, Thomas was a deacon and had been a monk at the Monastery of St. Sabas. He also was the abbot of the Lavra of Souka and a doctor in Jerusalem. Thomas was elected patriarch after the death of Patriarch George in 807. Following in the steps of George, Thomas continued to send delegations to the Franks, taking advantage of the treaty of friendship that had been formed by Charlemagne with the Abbasid Caliph Harun al Rashid of Baghdad. The delegations were able to gain financial support for the Church of Jerusalem from Charlemagne that, among other projects, was used to restore the cupola of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre that had been damaged in an earthquake. Thomas also received money from Bocam, a rich Christian Egyptian. While Thomas was patriarch, Jerusalem was infested by locusts that caused a famine and the temporary departure of the Muslims. Taking advantage of their departure, Thomas bought and imported fifteen cedars and fifteen fir trees, stripped of their branches as timber from Cyprus that were used in the restoration of the cupola of the Holy Sepulchre. When the Muslims returned they accused him of making the cupola larger than the Dome of the Rock and imprisoned him. Promising to pay a penalty of a thousand gold coins, Thomas was released and, also, was able to keep the cupola intact. He was never able to fulfill his promise of payment before his death and his successors were held responsible for the debt. Religious views Thomas was also active in the theological disputes of the day. He supported the theology of the Christian faith as expressed during the Fourth Ecumenical Council in a letter to the Armenians. He also opposed iconoclasm and the teaching that the Holy Spirit also proceeds from the Son, the filioque, that was spreading in the Western Church. Patriarch Thomas died in 821, and was succeeded by his follower Basil.

His interests in National Automobile were sold to a New York corporation in 1916 and renamed National Motor Car and Vehicle Corporation. Afterward he spent much of his time in Florida where he was involved in projects with Carl Fisher and James Allison. He was a generous benefactor to hospitals, in particular the James Whitcomb Riley Hospital for Children to establish an outpatient clinic, and to education being one of the founders of Butler University. He also contributed to Earlham College. Arthur Newby died unmarried in September 1933 aged 67. He is buried in Crown Hill cemetery.

At various times from 1995 to 1997, he kept 6 people as prisoners in a 9-meter deep bunker under his own garage. Four of his prisoners were eventually murdered. Komin was featured in several documentaries, including \\"Cooperative Prisoner\\" (1998) from the series \\"Criminal Russia\\", \\"Bunker. The modern version\\" (2015) from the series \\"The investigation was conducted...\\" and a documentary film which appeared on Japanese television from the series \\"Maniacs of the 20th century\\".  Life before the construction of the bunker  Komin was born on July 15, 1953 in Vyatskiye Polyany, where he subsequently committed all of his crimes. Having graduated from an 8-grade school, Komin was sentenced to 3 years imprisonment for hooliganism at the age of 18. While serving his sentence in a penal colony, Komin worked at the colony's garment factory. The work of a tailor pleased him so much that, after his release, he graduated from college in this specialty. However, it was hard for Komin to fulfill his ambitions in a small town, so he worked as a watchman, an electrician and a handyman as well. As Komin later explained, while serving his sentence, he met a prisoner who was convicted of holding several homeless people in his basement, forcing them to work for him. He enjoyed the idea of having unlimited power over others, so Komin wanted to experience the same thing.  Creation of the bunker  In the Soviet era, taking into account the experience of his cellmate, Komin did not risk anything. But with the collapse of the USSR, an opportunity finally arose. To start, Komin needed a reliable partner. Soon, while working on the night shift, he suggested to his colleague, Alexander Mikheev, and he agreed. Initially, Komin only planned to organize a greenhouse with electric heating in the bunker, in which vegetables would be grown. Subsequently, Komin and Mikheev planned to sell them in a cafe. According to their plan, they would not work there, but forced laborers would. Komin no longer had a car, and never sold his garage. Soon, he came up with a new idea - to create his own sewing production. After almost four years under the garage, the companions were digging an underground bunker, where they arranged several rooms, conducted electricity, ventilation, and even made a winch that performed the role of an elevator, and by early 1995, their underground prison was ready.  The first victims  Soon the search for future slaves began, with the ideal option being a young, lone dressmaker. For a while Komin and Mikheev walked around the city looking for potential workers in the market and at the station, but without success. On January 13, 1995, near a school on Gagarin Street, Komin met a woman named Vera Talpayeva, whom he offered to celebrate the Old New Year in good company. Strangely enough, she was not surprised that Komin brought her to the garage. There, he gave her a drink of vodka, which had clonidine laced in it. Initially, Talpayeva was an exemplary prisoner, with whom Komin completely satisfied his sexual ambitions. She could not sew, but wanted to learn. Talpayeva, however, brought Komin to the tailor Tatiana Melnikova, who would become the next prisoner. She did not remember her address exactly, and only called the street - the Steamboat. Going on a search, Komin unexpectedly met on this street a lone boy named Nikolai Malykh. In an incredible coincidence, he turned out to be a cohabitant of Melnikova. Suggesting that they both go celebrate the meeting, he gave the boy vodka laced with clonidine. However, Komin realised that Malykh, knowing the laws of the criminal world, would never have started working for him. Komin and Mikheev then stripped him, took him out of the garage and left the unconscious boy in the twenty-degree frost. His body was discovered in a week.  Work in the underground bunker and new victims  Melnikova began sewing for Komin dressing gowns and shorts, which he successfully sold in markets and enterprises. In parallel, the construction of the bunker continued, where Talpayeva was an auxiliary worker. However, there was not much use for it, and therefore Komin decided to get a prisoner for the earthworks. On March 21, 1995, at a shop in Uritsky Street, Komin and Mikheev met a strong but alcoholic 37-year-old Yevgeny Shishov. He agreed to a free drink and soon found himself in the bunker, but there was little benefit for Shishov. When Komin realised that he knew what to do, he said that Shishov is an electrician of the 4th rank. Komin could not allow any of his prisoners to figure out the electrical junctions of the bunker and cut off the ladder from the current. For the execution of Shishov, he made an electric chair of his own design: he wrapped his legs and hands with bare wires, plugged them into an outlet and made Talpayeva and Melnikova push two switches at the same time. As Mikheev later said: \\"He was like this: 'Aaa!'...And everything...You know, quickly...\\". Shishov's body was lifted on a hoist to the top, taken to the forest and then buried. Work in the bunker continued, but Melnikova alone could not satisfy Komin's increased appetite, and he then released Talpayeva to help find him a new prisoner. Komin's calculation here was also accurate - he knew that, being an accomplice in the murder of Shishov, she would not betray him. On July 16, 1995, Talpayeva brought another future prisoner to the garage - Tatiana Kozikova. Ironically, after five days in it she was to be held in court for petty theft, and, without waiting for it, was immediately in \\"prison\\". Melnikova taught Kozikova the basics of tailoring, and soon the garment factory had a full working force. Komin was merciless - the slaves had to work 16 hours a day, and he had incredible standards: for example, they had to sew 32 dressing gowns per day. Then Melnikova and Kozikova decided to escape. However, the implementation of the plan was made difficult by the fact that it was open and the staircase was cut off from the current only when Komin was inside. Having a perfect opportunity, they locked Komin in one of the rooms, jamming the door with a frying pan. However, they did not manage to escape - Komin broke out and caught them. He offered them a choice - either he cut their mouths to the ears, or would stamp \\"RAB\\" on their faces. They chose the latter, and Komin did it. From now on, the regime was toughened - now, when Komin entered the garage, he signaled a light bulb, and the prisoners had to put on their collars and shackles, and put the keys on a table. Meanwhile, Talpayeva had to look for new prisoners, but she unexpectedly disappeared. Deciding that she had left town, Komin himself continued the search. While visiting the station, he drew attention to a young woman - 27-year-old Tatyana Nazimova, who had been a homeless person for several years, travelling around different stations of the Gorky Railway. The food and lodging offered by an amiable stranger was to her an unexpected gift of fate, and soon another prisoner appeared in the bunker. However, Komin soon realised that this time he was mistaken. Nazimova was seriously ill mentally and physically, so he and Mikheev only had to use her as a lover. A year later, however, Komin became bored with his companion, and after leaving her without food for several days, he eventually killed her with a brake fluid. Komin laid Nazimova's corpse on a sled and drove to the city morgue, wishing to leave it at the entrance, but two hundred meters from the garage, he was frightened by an accidental passer- by, he threw the corpse and fled. Komin tried to realize one more of his dreams - growing cucumbers in a greenhouse with electric heating. But as soon as the prisoners gathered their first harvest, a neighbor complained to Komin that he suddenly felt the heat from the garage cellar, and Komin then began to grow potatoes. However, eventually all of the agronomical experiments were stopped.  Komin's ordinary life  During this time, Komin appeared to live quite an ordinary life. He lived in an apartment on Shkolnaya Street, along with his concubine, but at the same time he visited his garage daily. Neither Komin's partner, nor his neighbors suspected that any unnatural activities were going on in the garage, which for a long time had no car. Also, Komin was registered as unemployed in the public employment service, and regularly received unemployment benefits. Komin was engaged in public activities, and at this time he was already at the zenith of entrepreneurial success. In addition to the usual products of the garment factory, now the slaves began to sew phelonions for local priests, and even wove icons. Komin also forced them to weave a huge coat of arms of Russia, which he tried to sell to the Vyatskiye Polyana administration and even to the local police, but was refused.  The factory's final year  In January 1997, Komin unexpectedly met the missing Vera Talpayeva in the city. He offered her new conditions for cooperation: now she had to look for markets for the garment factory's products for an appropriate reward, and also to bring in new prisoners. A few days later Talpayeva brought into the garage 22-year-old Irina Ganyushkina, whom Komin later tried to artificially fertilize (with the help of a syringe), in order to literally begin to grow new slaves for himself. There, in the garage, with the use of the same brake fluid he killed Talpayeva, but unlike Nazimova, he tormented her for several hours before that.  Arrest, trial and sentence  Komin's arrest was due to his own mistake. He fell in love with Ganyushkina, and wanted to formalize an official marriage with her. Kozikova and Melnikova, realizing that this was their chance to escape, persuaded Ganyushkina to agree. Komin threatened to deal with the 22-year-old woman if she tried to escape. Ganyushkina agreed, but when Komin left her for a few minutes in his apartment unattended, she ran to the police on July 21, 1997. Initially, the employees did not believe the applicant, but when she called the names of those in the bunker, they immediately demanded her to indicate the bunker's location. Komin was arrested near his garage. He tried to stop the electricity in the ladder to try and escape, but Ganyushkina had reported this in advance. After Melnikova and Kozikova were discovered in the bunker they were hospitalized, with both of them wearing a bandage around their eyes, so that they would not be blinded by the sunlight, which they had not seen in two years. Mikheev was arrested soon after Komin, and began to testify, confessing to four murders, the illegal deprivation of liberty of three more people, the use of slave labor and illegal entrepreneurship. In 1999, the Kirov Regional Court sentenced Alexander Komin to life imprisonment, and Alexander Mikheev to 20 years imprisonment. After the sentencing, Komin committed suicide in his cell, by cutting open his inguinal artery.

It is considered to be a major example of the so-called summer architecture of the Cascais area.  History The Palmela Palace was built as a summer palace towards the end of the nineteenth century when Cascais became the summer resort of the royal family and, consequently, of the Portuguese court. This was one of the largest houses built by Portuguese nobility in Cascais at that time. It was constructed on the site of the disused fort of Our Lady of the Conception (), which was acquired by the Palmela family from the state in 1868 or 1869. The agreement signed with the government required the buyers to keep intact the line of fire to the Cascais coastline, ensuring that the new building could be used for military purposes in case of war. The drawings for the palace were delivered in 1873 and construction work began in that year or in early 1874. Designed by an English architect, Thomas Henry Wyatt, it draws heavily on the Perpendicular English Gothic style and uses local stone. The position of the palace next to the sea is well expressed in its profusion of gazebos and bay windows. The plan was asymmetrical; giving the idea of an older house that had been restored and added to rather than a recent construction. In the 1880s, the building was restructured by the architect Jos√© Ant√≥nio Gaspar, with the aim of creating room for a chapel. However, this work was found to be inadequate and the Duke of Palmela then entrusted Jos√© Lu√≠s Monteiro to do further renovation between 1890 and 1895. Under close control of the Duchess, a park was developed in the area around the house, with trees and some small lakes. The park contains a rare Portuguese example of the Canary Island Pine. Its present size is smaller than the original, having been divided by the construction of the railway line from Cascais to Lisbon in 1889.

The Committee is chaired by Deputy Speaker Charles Chong and consist of members; Minister of Law and Home Affairs K Shanmugam, Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information and for Education Janil Puthucheary, Social and Family Development Minister Desmond Lee, Members of Parliament (MPs) Rahayu Mahzam, Seah Kian Peng, Sun Xueling and Edwin Tong, as well as Workers' Party MP Pritam Singh and Nominated Member of Parliament Chia Yong Yong. Background On 3 April 2017, Minister of Law and Home Affairs K Shanmugam called for a review of existing laws to combat fake news. He cited the websites The Real Singapore which published an article claiming that a commotion between Thaipusam participants and the police was sparked by complaints from a Filipino family, the States Times Review which mocked former President S. R. Nathan with an article claiming near-zero turnout for his funeral, and All Singapore Stuff which reported eye-witness account of a collapsed HDB roof at Punggol Waterway Terraces which fooled the police and civil defence to investigate. The Minister claimed that fake news, when not debunked, can quickly cause harm to Singaporeans, panic to public, waste emergency resources, and damage reputations of businesses and people. He also claimed that nasty people seek to profit from fake news and that foreign agencies and foreign governments seek to destabilise the government through fake news. During his keynote speech at \\"Keep It Real: Truth And Trust In The Media\\" conference on 19 June 2017, Shanmugam said the government has to maintain a strong climate of trust, and be able to counter misinformation spread online. He cited a recent government survey that supported his notion for stronger laws to combat fake news. Shanmugam claimed that Singapore has been \\"particularly vulnerable\\" to foreign influences via fake news. \\"If the distrust becomes deep-rooted, people will have serious doubts about the institutions, about leadership, about governance,\\" he said. On 5 January 2018, the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) and Ministry of Law (MinLaw) published a Green Paper titled \\"Deliberate Online Falsehoods\\" detailing the need to establish a Select Committee to examine fake news threat in Singapore. On 10 January 2018, 80 MPs present voted unanimously in Parliament to appoint a Select Committee of eight PAP MPs, one opposition MP and one NMP to study and report on the problem of deliberate online falsehoods and recommend strategies to deal with them. Public hearings The Select Committee convened public hearings from 14 March to 29 March 2018, lasting eight days in total, where 79 individuals and organisations were invited to testify. Singaporean historian Thum Ping Tjin submitted a paper arguing that any legislation by the Singapore Parliament against online falsehood must also apply to the Singapore government. He argued that government's use of detention without trial between 1963 and 1988 during Operation Coldstore and Operation Spectrum. While the government has stated that the detainees were part of a communist plot or Marxist conspiracy to subvert the state, Thum claimed that the government has never produced any evidence to substantiate its claims nor have any detainees been brought to trial on the charges they were detained under. Thum argued that these justifications were false claims made by politicians of the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) for the purpose of political gain. On 29 March, the last day of the sitting of the Select Committee, Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam questioned Thum about a paper he published in 2013 regarding Operation Coldstore and the formation of Malaysia. He said Thum fell short of the standards of an objective historian, saying that he \\"ignores evidence which you don't like, you ignore and suppress what is inconvenient and in your writings you present quite an untrue picture\\". Thum countered that his paper had been peer-reviewed and that no historian had stepped forward to contradict the central thrust of his work. Channel NewsAsia and The Straits Times reported that Thum admitted that there were parts of the paper which he could have worded better, that some of his statements were misleading, and that he had not read nor bother to quote many of the accounts of some communist leaders as he felt that those accounts were unreliable. These included the first-hand accounts of Chin Peng, the leader of the Malayan Communist Party.Historian Thum Ping Tjin, Shanmugam cross swords on Singapore's communism-related past. Channelnewsasia.com However, in a subsequent follow-up submission to the Select Committee, Thum claimed that the reports took his words out of context, arguing that \\"the crux of my original submission was not addressed in the discussion\\", \\"the fundamental arguments... were not raised nor challenged\\", and \\"at no point did I accept that any part of my article was inaccurate or misleading\\". He insisted that \\"my overall point in my article that Operation Coldstore was fundamentally motivated by political, not security, reasons, stands\\".  Reactions  Civil activists groups Community Action Network, Function 8, and Maruah, as well as activists Kirsten Han, Terry Xu, and Thum himself, criticised the open hearings, accusing the Select Committee of failing to adhere to its own terms of reference, and claiming the hearings had not been conducted in an open or consultative manner. A letter signed by 170 academics was submitted to Chong, criticising the hearing as an attempt to attack and destroy Thum's credibility and discredit his research, with the effect of stifling the freedom of expression and academic freedom in Singapore. A letter from six of Thum's colleagues at the University of Oxford's Project Southeast Asia also expressed concerns about how Thum was treated at the hearing, saying that Thum's research, which Shanmugam had criticised, had \\"already met the rigorous standards of examination at Oxford and peer review by fellow historical experts on the region\\". The letter also expressed concerns about the \\"implications for academic freedom, and for freedom of expression in Singapore\\", saying that the hearing \\"appears designed to intimidate those who seek to publish the truth\\". In response, Chong argued that it was Thum who had chosen to make a political point in his written submission to the Select Committee, and that while Thum was entitled to his views, he must expect to be questioned about his claims. He also characterised Thum's submission as a \\"political piece\\" rather than an \\"academic dissertation\\". Chong also released a report based upon attached emails between two trustees of Project Southeast Asia that were copied, likely inadvertently, to the Select Committee, showing email discussions between Thum and Philip Kreager from the University of Oxford's Project Southeast Asia regarding the drafting and sharing of a letter in support of Thum. Chong accused Thum of having \\"engineered\\" the open letter in support of himself, as well as getting Kraeger to canvass for support on his behalf. Chong alleged \\"a coordinated attempt, with foreign actors involved, to try to influence and subvert our parliamentary processes\\". Kreager called Chong's statement \\"clearly preposterous\\", insisting that the emails were merely to \\"exchange views\\", and accusing Chong of imagining a \\"conspiracy\\". On 13 April, the Parliament Secretariat wrote to Thum to clarify his academic credentials following his claims to be a \\"research fellow in history\\" in his submission and holding \\"a visiting professorship in anthropology at Oxford University\\" during his oral testimony. Following media enquiries, the University of Oxford replied that Thum was a research associate at the School of Anthropology and Museum Ethnography. Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act On 1 April 2019, the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation (POFMA) Bill was tabled in parliament for first reading. The Ministry of Law stated that the legislation seeks to protect the society from deliberate online falsehoods created by malicious actors by targeting falsehoods, not opinions and criticisms, nor satire or parody. It defines a falsehood as a statement of fact that is false or misleading. After concerns were raised about the Bill's scope, ministers gave reassurances that the bill will not affect free speech. The Bill was passed with a 72-9 vote on 8 May 2019 after a two-day debate. POFMA came into effect on 2 October 2019, with the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) the agency in charge of the Act. Subsidiary legislation is also laid out in the Act detailing how the Act will work, including court challenges that take nine days at maximum and cost as little as $200.

Characteristics Biker metal has been described as being influenced by punk rock, rock and roll, heavy metal and blues. Sleazegrinder, a writer at Classic Rock, described biker metal as \\"glam metal gone Mad Max\\". Biker metal is characterized by its mid-tempo approach to metal, its \\"gritty and American\\" sound, and its alignment with biker culture as a whole. The genre has been contrasted with slower and more operatic forms of metal, such as Judas Priest's work in the early 2000s. Similarly, biker metal eschews the speed and virtuosity that rose to prominence in the 1980s. Bands such as Black Moth, Orange Goblin, The Obsessed, Earthride and Black Label Society have been described as fusing the style with doom metal, whereas Clutch have been described as merging elements of biker metal and Southern rock into their stoner rock sound. Black Sabbath's song Paranoid has been considered a classic of the genre. Biker metal has proven influential to genres ranging from speed metal to hardcore punk and crust punk, and was integeral to the development extreme metal, Giuseppe Sbrana, of Botswanan heavy metal band Skinflint, has stated that biker metal bands were heavily influential on the aesthetic of African heavy metal bands. Terminology The association with biker culture has been present for most of heavy metal and punk rock's lifetime: Thin Lizzy were photographed frequently with motorcycles stretching as far back as 1973; Joan Jett appeared on the cover of Outlaw Biker Magazine; Judas Priest used a biker image beginning in mid-1970s, however also borrowed heavily from sadomasochism; and the common dressing style of metalheads is closely tied to that of those in biker gangs. Spin hails Mot√∂rhead's lead vocalist Lemmy, as the first to bring motorcycle culture into punk rock and heavy metal, likely through the influence of earlier rock bands such as Steppenwolf, Lynyrd Skynyrd and the Grateful Dead; an early use of the term \\"heavy metal\\" was even present in Steppenwolf's 1968 song \\"Born to Be Wild\\", in reference to a motorcycle.

It was designed by John Shedden Adam (of Sulman and Power and Adam) and built from 1929 to 1930. It is also known as St. John's Uniting Church, Hall and Manse, Knox Church, Wahroonga Presbyterian Church, St John‚Äôs Presbyterian Church, WPS and Wahroonga Preparatory School. The property is owned by the Uniting Church in Australia. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 19 September 2003.  History  Presbyterian services had been held in Hornsby from 1893 and in 1896 the Rev James Marshall was appointed to the newly established Hornsby Pymble Parish. There being a number of Presbyterians living in Wahroonga they pressed for the establishment of their own parish rather than the planned Home Mission station. In November 1897 the Rev J Kemp Bruce came to Wahroonga and was inducted as the first Minister in February 1898. He was followed in succession by the Rev's. C E James (1918-1926), D J Flockhart (1927-1956), R A Blackwood (1957-1969), A F Smart (1971-1995), R I Cirotto (1995-1997) The first church building on the site was an Amusement Hall purchased for A‚Ç§1,000 in 1898 which was a brick building capable of holding 150 people. It came with an acre of land. It was known as the Wahroonga Presbyterian Hall. A Manse was erected in 1899 largely funded by the gift of John Gillespie of 1,000 guineas. In the 1920s (the exact date is not known) two church halls were built on the site. This allowed the original Amusement Hall to be demolished. The large hall was used for worship while the church was being built. The Foundation Stone of the new church was laid by the then Governor of NSW, Sir Dudley de Chair in 1929 and the first service held therein on 26 April 1930. The architect for this ensemble of church buildings was John Shedden Adam. He was also responsible for the design of a number of local buildings including St James's Anglican Church, Turramurra and the Knox Grammar School main building. Of the 13 fine stained glass windows in the church, ten are the work of Norman Carter and are mostly memorials to the war dead of both World Wars. The others are by Henry W Hiscox, Bill Mahony and David Saunders.  Description  The group consists of the Church and two Halls with ancillary rooms, toilets and connecting passages. These are arranged around a central courtyard with arcading forming the fourth side facing the street. The whole is constructed of high quality red face brickwork with darker brick and sandstone trim, under steeply pitched red marseilles patterned tiled roofs. The complex was designed as a whole and was built in stages during the 1920s. The boundaries to the site are defined by rock face stone walls. Each entrance is marked by stone piers. The main entrance to the church complex retains its original light fitting set in the tops of these piers. The entrance path to the church office/vestry is defined by a steel arch over the path. =The church= The church is an Inter-war Gothic building with a gable running north-south for the full length of the building. Hipped octagonal transepts project on the eastern and western sides. Entry is from the courtyard at the northern end. An octagonal stair turret, with copper spire, on the north west corner, leads up to the organ gallery above the entry. A square bell tower (minus bells) is located at the south-western corner of the building and dominates the view from the south, the main approach to the complex. Stone string courses and darker brick bands run around the building and stone copings cap the gables. The windows are set in stone tracery with stone heads and sills. The entry is unusual with a pair of large sliding panelled doors opening the entry porch to the courtyard. A thistle is carved into the stone corbels supporting the lintel over the doors. A large rose window is an important element of this northern elevation. At the southern end of the church an arcaded brick porch links two vestries, which are located either side of the chancel. The church contains a very fine collection of high quality paired lancet stained glass windows, 11 of which are the work of Norman Carter (see images and a detailed description in the book St John's Wahroonga - the first 100 Years 1898-1998 Ed. David Wood). The interior of the church is face brickwork with a panelled timber dado running around the walls below sill height. The ceiling is timber boarded with exposed rafters and is supported by hammerbeam trusses of an unusual and elaborate design. A deep carved timber cornice, featuring vine leaves, runs around the top of the walls above two rows of corbelled brickwork. The trusses are supported on projecting stone corbels. All the finishes are of a very high quality. The timber floor slopes from the entry down toward the chancel, which is on raised platform, containing the Pulpit, Lectern and Communion table with chairs for the officers of the Church. All appear to be original. In the east transept are the choir stalls and organ console. The west transept contains a grand piano and fixed seating around the walls with one pew facing into the transept forming a division with the nave. The nave of the church is filled with benched pews (original) arranged with a central and side aisles. The organ is located in a gallery at the northern end of the church. This has been extended s and is compatible with the design and finish of the church. The church is lit with large amber glazed lanterns (original), recently modified for halogen lights. =Little Hall= The Little Hall is a gabled building, also of inter war Gothic design. The western wall facing Coonanbarra Road repeats themes from the church building in its detailing. It features stone bands, string courses and copings, together with dark brick bands, plinth and vertical panels, framing the whole. The northern and southern walls are buttressed, and where the arcading that links this building to the church meets the Little Hall, there is a stone capped gabled parapet. Other detailing on these elevations, however, including small paned timber casement windows, the bay window facing the courtyard, and the roof reaching down low over these windows, give the building a much more domestic scale and feel. Internally the walls are plastered with timber picture rails and dado rails running around them. The ceiling of the hall is timber boarded with exposed rafters and timber trusses with iron bracing. The smaller rooms have flat plaster ceilings. The floor is timber. A tall narrow leadlight window features in the west wall of the hall. =Hall= The main hall links the church to the little hall on the eastern side of the courtyard by way of an arcaded verandah. The brick arches, with their darker brick headers, reflect those in the arcade on the western side of the courtyard. The hall is two storey in height and has a large hipped roof which sweeps down over the verandah to meet the roof of the Little Hall. Like the adjoining buildings, it also features two tone brickwork and buttresses to its side walls. The windows to the main space are large timber multi-paned double hung windows, while those to the smaller spaces are small paned casements matching those used in the Little Hall. The hall has a second well defined entrance at its northern end leading from the driveway into two offices. These are currently used by the preparatory school located behind the hall. The hall has a full stage at its southern end. A s? stair leads up to a storeroom above the offices at the northern end. The walls are plastered above a face brick dado. The ceiling is timber boarded with exposed rafters and timber roof trusses. Original ceiling vents are spaced between the trusses. =Courtyard= The courtyard is currently paved with a red pebblecrete and is open to the sky. There is a garden planted in the north- west corner. A grand flight of stairs lead up to the courtyard from Coonanbarra Road. These are flanked by low brick walls and original steel handrails. The church and Little Hall are set only one step above the courtyard level, whereas the main hall with its arcaded verandah is set several steps higher, reflecting the natural topography of the site. =Preparatory School= The Wahroonga Preparatory School is located to the east of the hall and church. =Manse= The church site also includes a Manse which is a Federation-style, two-storey house built in 1898. = Condition = As at 30 May 2003, the physical condition was excellent. = Modifications and dates = *1920s - two halls constructed *1929-1930 - Church constructed *1972 - organ loft built at the rear (north) end of the church (architects Laurie & Heath) *1994 - lighting upgraded (architect Gordon Fuller)  Heritage listing  As at 24 April 2009, the Church and Hall complex of St John's Uniting Church, Wahroonga, is of State Significance. Designed as a complete complex by the highly regarded architect John Shedden Adam they have retained a high degree of integrity. As a group, and individually, the buildings are of exceptional aesthetic significance. They are well proportioned, refined in detail and the work is well crafted. They are of high social significance for their continuing use as the local Uniting Church and represent the life both of the former Presbyterian church and now the religious life of the Uniting Church community in the area. The place is highly significant in the lives of Presbyterians and members of the Uniting Church in the local area. The site has been a focus for religious and social expression spanning more than 100 years. It has associations with the Gillespie family, of Fielders Gillespie flour mills, who were locally prominent philanthropists and founders of Knox Grammar School. St John's Uniting Church was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 19 September 2003 having satisfied the following criteria.

Corbella met her future husband Enrico Petrillo in 2002 when both were on a pilgrimage to Medjugorje; they were married on 21 September 2008. The pair had two children in 2009 and 2010 who both died within half an hour of their births due to medical complications which were diagnosed when Corbella was pregnant. The couple had their final child in 2011 at which point she began treatment for a carcinoma that she had been diagnosed with and which was later deemed to be terminal. The cancer spread to places such as her tongue and liver which made sight and talking troublesome as the illness progressed. Both she and her husband also were admirers of the Franciscans and made several pilgrimages to Assisi during their time together; indeed her spiritual director was a Franciscan friar who married the pair in 2008. Corbella and her husband also took to speaking at pro-life events in Rome following the births and deaths of their first two children. Her cause for beatification had long been discussed following her death and concrete steps were taken in 2018 after the formal launch to the cause in Rome. The diocesan process for her cause was opened in the Lateran Basilica on 21 September 2018; Corbella has been titled as a Servant of God. Life Chiara Corbella was born on 9 January 1984 in Rome as the second of two children to Roberto Corbella and Maria Anselma Ruzziconi; her elder sister was Elisa. Her baptism was celebrated on 5 February at the Santi Marcellino e Pietro al Laterano church where she also made her First Communion on 29 May 1994 and received her Confirmation on 8 October 1995. In the summer of 2002 she was on a vacation in Croatia with some high school classmates when she decided to make a brief stop in Medjugorje where her elder sister had been visiting. On 2 August 2002 she first met Enrico Petrillo (then aged 23) at Medjugorje and the two soon started a relationship; Enrico was there with the Charismatic Renewal on a pilgrimage. The pair first met in a crowded hotel dining room and split up several times but each time got back together. The pair broke up in 2006 but reunited after Chiara made another visit to Medjugorje. On another occasion after a break up, Chiara had gone with her father and sister to Australia. Upon her return she saw an email from Enrico who was interested in rekindling their relationship. On 8 December 2006 she was in Assisi for a vocational course that the Order of Friars Minor had been managing where she first met Fra Vito D'Amato whom she asked to be her spiritual director. Enrico had been impressed with the effect that the course had on her and so attended one himself that 31 December. The pair's relationship culminated on 21 September 2008 in Assisi once the two were married with D'Amato presiding over the wedding at the San Pietro church. The couple had travelled to Assisi on a walking pilgrimage in 2008 and became engaged at the end of the walk on 2 August; Enrico had proposed to her three times and each time she accepted. One month after their wedding the pair learnt that Corbella was pregnant after she had just started a postgraduate degree in political sciences. The first ultrasound scan revealed that their daughter had been diagnosed as having anencephaly and the parents were asked if they wished to abort. Enrico and Chiara both refused to do this and remained firmly focused on having the child. The couple's first child Maria Grazia Letizia was born on 10 June 2009 but died after half an hour, long enough for Father D'Amato to baptize her; her funeral was held on 12 June at the Sant'Angelo in Pescheria church. The ultrasound during Chiara's second pregnancy revealed that the child had no legs but the couple were once more determined to have the child. The seventh month scans showed the child had visceral malformations with the absence of his lower limbs as a confirmation of the first scan. Further scans indicated that her second child had no kidneys and therefore his lungs would not be able to develop which would lead to breathing complications. Despite this, the couple persevered and Davide Giovanni was born on 24 June 2010 and baptized quickly as his father placed a small wooden cross around the infant's neck which was the Tau Cross; their daughter was also baptized in this manner. Enrico carried his son to the hospital morgue after his son died after living for 38 minutes. His funeral was celebrated on 26 June in the Sant'Angelo in Pescheria church. The pair soon became popular speakers at a range of pro-life events where they were able to share testimonies about the births of their two children. Both also recited the rosary each Thursday night and ended their prayer of consecration to the Blessed Mother with the words \\"Totus Tuus\\". Chiara became pregnant with her final child not long after and the couple were relieved that the ultrasound scans demonstrated the child would be born in perfect health. However, in the fifth month Chiara became diagnosed with a bad lesion on the tongue and had to undergo a surgical procedure. Doctors informed her that the lesion had in fact been a carcinoma, but she was insistent on bearing her final child even if it meant endangering her life. Corbella had an operation in March 2011 to treat her condition. Her final child Francesco was born at 37 weeks on 30 May 2011 in perfect health and her treatment started after his birth; she had another operation on 3 June. But the cancer's intensification over time meant that it became difficult for her to see and to speak. In March 2012 the pair brought their son to the Portiuncula in Assisi in order to entrust him to the Blessed Mother. In late March Chiara learnt that the cancer had metastasized to one breast and her liver in addition to her lungs and one eye. Her condition was deemed terminal and the diagnosis was made to Enrico who told his wife the news at the hospital chapel before the Blessed Sacrament. This was during Holy Week on 4 April and the two then and there renewed their marriage vows. Corbella met Pope Benedict XVI alongside her husband and son on 2 May 2012 at the pope's general audience where the couple were able to discuss their experiences with the pope. Corbella died at her home at noon on 13 June 2012 dressed in her wedding gown; she had participated in her final Mass on 12 June. Cardinal Agostino Vallini presided over her funeral Mass on 16 June at Santa Francesca Romana where he remembered her as \\"the second Gianna Beretta\\". Her remains are interred with her two children at Campo Verano in Rome. Beatification process The beatification process was opened in Rome on 2 July 2018 after Cardinal Angelo De Donatis issued an edict that established the cause would be introduced in Rome and also naming Corbella as a Servant of God. Cardinal De Donatis presided over the opening of the diocesan process on 21 September 2018 in the Basilica of Saint John Lateran and hoped that Christians would \\"find in her encouragement and support in the service of conjugal love and life\\". The first and current postulator appointed for this cause is the Discalced Carmelite priest Romano Gambalunga.

Crimes  On the night of June 21, 2003, Kalinin and his acquaintance Denis Redrov were resting in the Chita cafe \\"Gan Bay\\", where they met two schoolgirls. They lured one of the girls in the Memorial Park of the Fighting and Labor Glory of the Trans-Baikal Region, where she was raped and killed. Then the criminals brought to the park and then killed the other girl, because they feared that she could inform the police about the crime that they had committed. After the second murder, they decided to simulate a robbery attack on the victims: they took gold jewelry, a pager and a cosmetic bag from the dead, and then threw the bodies into the Chita River. In the summer of 2009, Kalinin met with a female student in Chita, and invited her to a vacation outside the city. The student took a friend with her on the trip. On June 17, the three of them arrived by train to the station \\"Glubokaya Pad\\", from which they reached the dacha cooperative \\"Lokomotiv-82\\". On one of the abandoned dachas, Kalinin raped and killed his new acquaintance. Before that, he had lured into the forest and killed her friend. He took off the gold ornaments and broken cell phones from the dead, and disposed of them in the forest. On June 19, the Railway Police Department received a statement about the two missing girls. On June 23, the main suspect in the murders, Kalinin, was detained.–í –ß–∏—Ç–µ –≤—ã–Ω–µ—Å–µ–Ω –ø–æ–∂–∏–∑–Ω–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –ø—Ä–∏–≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä –Ω–∞—Å–∏–ª—å–Ω–∏–∫—É –∏ —É–±–∏–π—Ü–µ —á–µ—Ç—ã—Ä—ë—Ö –¥–µ–≤—É—à–µ–∫ According to his testimony on June 25, operatives detained at Yekaterinburg's airport the accomplice to the first murders, Redrov, and then brought him back to Chita.

Background  After the short April War in 1941, Axis forces swiftly occupied and destroyed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. A small group of Yugoslav officers, led by Dra≈æa Mihailoviƒá, did not accept the capitulation of the Yugoslav Army and organized resistance in their headquarters at Ravna Gora. As soon as the news about this resistance movement reached Belgrade, many intellectuals and members of non-Communist political parties supported it. This group became the nucleus of CNK, which coordinated their activities with the headquarters.  Establishment  The CNK was established at the end of August 1941 as a consultative body. According to some sources, the CNK was established in September 1941. The Chetniks established Mountain Staff No. 1 and Central National Committee, forming the ideological substance of the Chetnik movement - For Democracy, Against All Dictatorships - their aim for the war. The CNK was composed of the political representatives of all prewar opposition parties. Its Executive Board members were Dragi≈°a Vasiƒá, Mladen Mlaƒëa ≈Ωujoviƒá, and Stevan Moljeviƒá. After some time, regional committees were established in Montenegro () and in Split. () Although they supported Mihajloviƒá, they were not directly subordinated to the CNK.  Activities  The CNK did not have particular importance. Is Executive Board was active for the first two years only. At the beginning of 1943 the CNK was expanded and joined by Aleksandar Aksentijeviƒá, ƒêuro ƒêuroviƒá, Mustafa Mulaliƒá and ƒêuro Viloviƒá. The CNK began with resistance to Axis occupying forces. Photo of ƒêura ƒêuroviƒá, secretary of the Executive Board of CNK and editor of its official organ \\"Glas Jugoslavije\\" According to the decisions of the Ba Congress, the CNK was designated to acquire political responsibility and cooperate with Allies until liberation from Fascists and Communists and with the government of the coming Yugoslav Federation composed of Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia. The vice president of CNK was Mustafa Mulaliƒá. He hoped to collect all Muslim sympathizers of the Yugoslav Federation as projected by the Chetniks. The official organ of the CNK was Glas Yugoslavije, initiated on 10 July 1944. It was edited by the Executive Board of the CNK, mainly by Dr. ƒêura ƒêuroviƒá who was board's secretary between June and September 1944.  Final days  Facing the entrance of pro-Partisan Communist Red Army troops into Axis occupied Yugoslavia the CNK decided to follow advice from the US to gather their forces in Banja Luka and await the invasion of Allied forces on Dalmatian coast and their infiltration into Bosnia and other parts of Yugoslavia. On 21 February 1945, Pavle ƒêuri≈°iƒá organized a conference and the group decided to retreat to Slovenia until more a favourable political situation for their national cause was reached, inviting Mihailoviƒá and CNK to follow their conclusions. In the absence of a reply from Mihailoviƒá, on 1 March 1945 ƒêuri≈°iƒá organized a new conference of the \\"National Committee of Higher Military Commanders and Intellectuals from Montenegro, Boka and Old Ras\\" that reached the same conclusions. Mihailoviƒá and CNK rejected decisions of this conference and condemned ƒêuri≈°iƒá. Some members of the CNK, including its president Dragi≈°a Vasiƒá, joined ƒêuri≈°iƒá and began their journey toward Slovenia, contrary to the decisions of Mihailoviƒá. After the Battle of Lijevƒçe Field they were all captured and together with ƒêuri≈°iƒá and other captured Chetnik officers taken to Jasenovac death camp where they were all killed in April 1945.  Consequences  Many authors emphasize that Stevan Moljeviƒá and his work Homogeneous Serbia played a crucial role in preparation of a coherent set of Chetnik war objectives with establishment of the Greater Serbia as one of the most important Chetnik war objectives. John R. Lampe pointed to the secondary status of the Central National Committee and Moljeviƒá's rise to prominence in this committee only in 1943, as significant details undercut the perception that Moljeviƒá's \\"Homogeneous Serbia\\" was the centerpiece of the coherent set of Chetnik war objectives.

Outline The site is location on the right bank of the Jinz≈´ River in what is now part of the Sarukurayama ski resort on the outskirts of the city of Toyama. In this vicinity there are a number of archaeological sites from the Japanese Palaeolithic to the J≈çmon era, including the Nozawa site, Yagiyama Ono site, Naosaka ‚Ö° site, Naosaka ‚Ö¢ site, Naosaka IV site, indicating that this area has been densely populated since the earliest times. The Sugusaka site was discovered in 1971 during construction work for the establishment of a ranch, when a stone furnace dating from the middle of the J≈çmon period was discovered. In response, in 1972 the Toyama Board of Education conducted excavation surveys of the area. From the Japanese Paleolithic period, some 1200 stone blades were found. These blades were dated to about 25,000 to 30,000 years ago, and are thus the oldest thus found in the Hokuriku region. Apart from this, local polished stone axes and cusp heads of the age following this have been excavated. The site also contained thousands of fist-sized stones which had burn marks. These stones were used for cooking purposes. Early examples of pottery were also found, including pottery with patterns created by a rolling die, and embossed pottery. These pottery shards were from the Hida, Shinano, Kinki and T≈çkai regions indicating long range trade routes from a very early period in Japanese history.
