Reign Govardhan gave Madhabkunda waterfall its name. It is now a major tourist attraction in Bangladesh. Govardhan rose to power following the death of his father, Gouradhwaj Bhabananda. During this period, Raja Upananda was the King of Brahmachal (Southern Sylhet). The long-lasted conflict between the north and south continued during Govardhan's reign. Govardhan appointed his chief minister, Madan Rai, to somehow find a way to lure Upananda's general, Amar Singh, in order to use him in infiltrating the south. Govardhan and Madan Rai then made an agreement with Govardhan's general Virabhadra to give his daughter, Chandra Kala, in marriage to Singh. The marriage was successful, despite protests, and Singh maintained a good relationship with General Virabhadra. Singh also had a friendship with the Kuki Chiefs, the border guards for the Tripura Kingdom, just south of Brahmachal. The Kuki Chiefs were persuaded into raiding Raja Upananda's palace in the dead of the night, massacring most of its inmates. As another battle emerged, a few children of the royal family managed to escape. Babysat by the Upananda's older sister-in- law, Anna Purna, the children reached the jungles where a Bihari sannyasi by the name of Giridhari took guided them to Kamakhya Temple where they were trained into hermitage. The battle hosted casualties on both sides leading to the death of Raja Upananda. General Amar Singh took over Brahmachal for a short while before also being killed. The Kuki Chiefs annexed Brahmachal (modern-day Baramchal in Kulaura) to the King of Tripura and Govardhan sent Jaidev Rai, son of Upananda's minister, to be a feudal ruler under the Tripuras. In fear of Kuki Chiefs, the Raja Shandul of Taraf migrated to Gour and the King of Tripura put Bhadra Janardhan in charge of Taraf. During a hunting expedition in the Patharia hills, Govardhan wished to establish a resting place for the benefit of travellers. He came across a monk by the name of Madhabeshwar meditating under a waterfall. In respect of the monk, the waterfall was called Madhabkunda waterfall. Defeat Although Govardhan's early rule of Gour maintained a healthy relationship with Tripura, the latter part of his reign had to deal with rebels. The Jaintia Kingdom, north of Gour, attempted to invade and annex Gour to its kingdom. The various indigenous tribes including the Pnar, the Khasis, the Kacharis, the Kukis and the Nagas joined forces in attacking Bengali-dominated Gour. Gour was being attacked from both directions and had no support from neighbouring states. Govardhan was killed in battle. However, the royal men of Brahmachal who had migrated to Kamakhya in the start of Govardhan's rule, had returned to Gour being led by Upananda's nephew, Gour Govinda, who would defeat the rebels and re-establish peace with the Tripura Kingdom.

The episode is set around the demise of serial killer Breda McQueen (Moya Brady), who has held Tony Hutchinson (Nick Pickard) against his will for several months, as well as the introduction of Tony's sister Verity Hutchinson (Eva O'Hara). Plot Breda McQueen's (Moya Brady) murderous past has finally caught up with her, after being found out by her family that she is a serial killer. She arrives at her pig farm to find Mercedes McQueen (Jennifer Metcalfe) trying to free Tony Hutchinson (Nick Pickard) from the pig pen, whom she has kept prisoner since July. Verity Hutchinson (Eva O'Hara) meets Diane Hutchinson (Alex Fletcher) for the first time after she and Sami Maalik (Rishi Nair) walked in on Diane kissing Edward Hutchinson (Joe McGann). Breda punches Mercedes and stabs Tony in the stomach with a pitchfork and locks them back up in the pig pen. Verity tells Diane that Edward always gets what he wants and claims she takes after him. Sylver McQueen (David Tag) and his sister Goldie McQueen (Chelsee Healey) argue over how dangerous Breda is, with Sylver being dismissive of Goldie's claims. Lisa Loveday (Rachel Adedeji) bursts in, still believing Mercedes is the serial killer after Breda tried to frame her, and asks them if she knew if Mercedes killed her father Louis Loveday (Karl Collins), and finds his ring in Liberty Savage's (Jessamy Stoddart) jumble shop. Mercedes finds out that Breda has harmed her brother, John Paul McQueen (James Sutton). Breda calls her a whore and says she will be the first \\"bad mum\\" that she is going to kill.

The village pay tribute to the victims at Walter's vigil. Breda tells Goldie why she killed Russ Owen (Stuart Manning) was because he forced her to terminate her pregnancy. Sylver asks her if he really killed Goldie's father, but Breda says she did. Diane confronts Edward about why he is ignoring her, claiming he is nobody's affair. Sylver starts to get angry after he was sentenced to 18 years imprisonment for a murder he did not commit, and tries to strangle Breda. Goldie intervenes and realises that Breda has harmed Mercedes.

It has an apparent visual magnitude of 8.5, and is a RS Canum Venaticorum variable. The system is notable for being young as a member of the 45 Myr old Tucana-Horologium moving group and for the primary star hosting the confirmed exoplanet DS Tucanae Ab, discovered by TESS.  Stellar System  DS Tucanae is a visual binary. The binary consists of a G6V primary and a K3V secondary separated by 5\\". Based on radial velocity measurements it was suggested that the secondary itself is a binary, but later studies could not find evidence for this claim.  Physical properties  High levels of magnetic activity, a strong 6708√Ö lithium line, and the position on the color-magnitude diagram, slightly above the main sequence, strongly support a young age of the system.  Planetary System  DS Tuc Ab is one of the few transiting planets with an age smaller than 100 Myrs. Other examples are K2-33b, V1298 Tauri b and AU Microscopium b. Of these systems DS Tuc is the brightest and it is a good target for atmospheric characterization with JWST. The planet is a super- Neptune or sub-Saturn. The planet might be an inflated planet with an upper mass limit of 20 . DS Tuc Ab will be observed by ESA's CHEOPS mission to characterize the planet. The planet DS Tucanae Ab has a low orbital obliquity (Œª = ¬∞ or Œª = 12 ¬± 13 ¬∞). This means that the orbital plane of this planet aligns with the stellar equator of the star. This is unusual for a short period planet. Many short period planets show high orbital obliquity, which was taken as a sign of the scattering of the planet into this short period orbit. It can also be interpreted as the formation of a planet in an inner disk with an axial tilt. But these previous measurements of orbital obliquity were made for giant planets around mature stars. DS Tucanae Ab is a relative small young planet. This result suggests that DS Tucanae Ab formed in a smooth disk that was not perturbed by the stellar companion DS Tucanae B. DS Tucanae Ab might be therefore a good target to study in-situ planet-formation of short-period planets.

The site is located in an area bearing the same name, or alternatively ƒ¶al ƒ†ilwi, which is known for its archaeological remains, and lies around one kilometre from the Tas-Silƒ° multi-period sanctuary and archaeological site. History Remains of the temple at ƒ¶al ƒ†inwi were found in the vicinity of San Niklaw chapel, to the right of the main road from ≈ªejtun to Marsaxlokk, between ≈ªejtun and the Tas-Silƒ° temple. The site is today represented by a few ashlar blocks still visible in a field wall. More remains may survive beneath the soil, since its excavation was superficial. The site was originally excavated by Albert V. Laferla in 1917. Architect Albert E. Vassallo drew the site during Laferla‚Äôs archaeological excavations. Themistocles Zammit, however, interpreted the remains as a possible domestic dwelling. John D. Evans suggested that the megalithic structures resemble more a dual temple site. Archaeology The site has five semi-rectangular rooms enclosed within a megalithic wall, and like Tal-Qadi temple, it had an anomalous form when compared with other megalithic temples in Malta. The floors were paved in hard stone or covered in beaten earth (Maltese: torba). Many pottery shards were found on site, and stone whorls, while flint and chert remains were scarce. Part of a handled cup, with a decoration of pointill√© triangles was found on site, which can be compared with remains found at , Filicudi, an island off Lipari.

A GPT must specify what kind of physical systems one can find in the lab, as well as rules to compute the outcome statistics of any experiment involving labeled preparations, transformations and measurements. The framework of GPTs has been used to define hypothetical non-quantum physical theories which nonetheless possess quantum theory's most remarkable features, such as entanglement or teleportation, see Features present in all non-classical GPTs. Notably, a small set of physically motivated axioms is enough to single out the GPT representation of quantum theory. Definition A GPT is specified by a number of mathematical structures, which are: * set of types of state spaces, each of which represents a class of physical systems; * composition rule (usually corresponds to a tensor product), which specifies how joint state spaces are formed; * set of measurement outcomes, which map states to probabilities and are usually described by an effect algebra; * set of possible physical operations, i.e., transformations that map state spaces to state spaces. It can be argued that if one can prepare a state x and a different state y, then one can also toss a (possibly biased) coin which lands on one side with probability p and on the other with probability 1-p and prepare either x or y, depending on the side the coin lands on. The resulting state is a statistical mixture of the states x and y and in GPTs such statistical mixtures are described by convex combinations, in this case px+(1-p)y. For this reason all state spaces are assumed to be convex sets. Following a similar reasoning, one can argue that also the set of measurement outcomes and set of physical operations must be convex. Additionally it is always assumed that measurement outcomes and physical operations are affine maps, i.e. that if \\\\Phi is a physical transformation, then we must have \\\\Phi(px+(1-p)y) = p\\\\Phi(x) + (1-p) \\\\Phi(y)and similarly for measurement outcomes. This follows from the argument that we should obtain the same outcome if we first prepare a statistical mixture and then apply the physical operation, or if we prepare a statistical mixture of the outcomes of the physical operations. Note that physical operations are a subset of all affine maps which transform states into states as we must require that a physical operation yields a valid state even when it is applied to a part of a system (the notion of \\"part: is subtle: it is specified by explaining how different system types compose and how the global parameters of the composite system are affected by local operations). For practical reasons it is often assumed that a general GPT is embedded in a finite-dimensional vector space, although infinite-dimensional formulations exist.  Quantum theory as an example of a GPT  Quantum theory is a GPT where system types are described by a natural number D which corresponds to the Hilbert space dimension. States of the systems of Hilbert space dimension D are described by the normalized positive semidefinite matrices, i.e. by the density matrices. Measurements are identified with Positive Operator valued Measures (POVMs); and the physical operations are completely positive maps. Systems compose via the tensor product of the underlying Hilbert space.  Classical theory as an example of a GPT  Classical theory is a GPT where states correspond to probability distributions and both measurements and physical operations are stochastic maps. One can see that in this case all state spaces are simplexes. Examples other than quantum and classical theory The framework of GPTs has provided examples of consistent physical theories which cannot be embedded in quantum theory and indeed exhibit very non-quantum features. One of the first ones was Box-world, the theory with maximal non-local correlations. Other examples are theories with third-order interference and the family of GPTs known as generalized bits.  Features present in all non-classical GPTs  It was shown that many features that were considered purely quantum are actually present in all non-classical GPTs. These include: * impossibility of universal broadcasting, i.e., no-cloning theorem; * existence of incompatible measurements; * existence of entangled states or entangled measurements.

Life Eugene Emme was born on 3 November 1919 in Evanston, Illinois. He graduated from Morningside College in Sioux City, Iowa in 1941. Before the December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor he was a CPT pilot. After the United States joined the war he became a naval aviator. He served in the Pacific theater. In 1948 he transferred to the United States Air Force Reserve. In 1949 Emme received his Ph.D. in Modern European History from the University of Iowa. He became a member of the civilian faculty of the Air University (United States Air Force) in 1949. He was a pioneer in oral history, and interviewed Lord Dowding of the British Royal Air Force, Field Marshal Erhard Milch at Landsberg Prison in 1952, and Dwight D. Eisenhower. In 1958 he moved to Battle Creek, Michigan, as project director in the operations research office of the Office of Civil Defense. Emme became NASA's first historian in 1959. As a pioneer in aerospace history he advocated solid research and documentation. Emme had to address the challenges of obtaining solid support within NASA for historical research while developing scholars who would establish the basis for documenting and interpreting aerospace history, a new discipline that would largely rely on material from NASA programs. In 1962 Emme arranged for the annual Society for the History of Technology (SHOT) meeting to have a special session on the history of rocketry. This led to Technology and Culture devoting its entire Fall 1963 issue to rocketry. The papers were republished in 1964 as The History of Rocket Technology. In 1965 Emme published A History of Space Flight, aimed at younger readers. The book lays out the timeline of developments in rocket and satellite technology from ancient times, with many photographs. It explains the vehicles' scientific purpose, technology, objectives and performance. It is a valuable reference tool with a useful bibliography. However, the book added little information that was not already publicly available, and avoided discussion of controversies such as the decision by President John F. Kennedy to ignore his advisers and send a manned flight to the moon. Emme became co-chair of the history committee of the International Academy of Astronautics, and in this role attended congresses in Paris, Warsaw, Madrid, Constance, Vienna and Moscow. He was a member of the Reserve Officers Association, Air Force Historical Foundation, Air Force Association and Society for the History of Technology. Emme retired from the Ready Reserve as a colonel in 1972. He retired from NASA in 1978. Emme was a member of the Marvin Methodist Church of Silver Spring, Maryland near Washington, D.C.. He died of cancer on 24 June 1985 at the Holy Cross Hospital in Silver Spring, and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery. He was survived by his wife and three children. Legacy Emme was influential in encouraging SHOT historians to work in the areas of aeronautical and space technology, and in ensuring that NASA's historians undertook solid research and documentation of the history of that institution. He established the history committees of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, the American Astronautical Society, the International Academy of Astronautics and the National Rocket Club (now the National Space Club). It was through his efforts that the National Space Club set up its Goddard Historical Essay Award. The Eugene M. Emme Astronautical Literature Awards are named in Emme's honor. They recognize outstanding English-language books that advance public understanding of astronautics. Publications Publications include:    * Emme wrote many other books for NASA and the History Series of the American Astronautical Society.

Active in the disability rights movement for 40 years, she is known for her work with Disabled in Action, ADAPT, The Disability Caucus, and other groups. Her first book, Such a Pretty Girl: A Story of Struggle, Empowerment, and Disability Pride, is a memoir about her life and activism. She lives in New York City.  Early life  LaSpina was born in a fishing village Riposto in Sicily. As a young child she contracted polio, which left her without the use of her legs. Throughout her childhood she was the subject of constant pity, friends and neighbors would call her \\"such a pretty girl\\" with the implication that it was a shame that such an attractive child was disabled. At the age of 13 she moved with her parents to the United States in the hopes of finding a cure and spent much of her adolescence in and out of hospitals. She attended St. John's University in Jamaica Plains, Queens, and received a master's degree in Italian from New York University.  Career and advocacy  LaSpina taught Italian at New York University, Fordham University, and The New School, where she also taught in the pioneering field of disability studies. LaSpina has been involved with many protests and movements. She has mobilized for disabled parking and public transportation access in New York City and was involved in the fight for Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in programs that receive federal financial assistance, the first disability civil rights law to be enacted in the United States. LaSpina was later an important figure in the struggle to pass the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. As a result of her activism, LaSpina has been arrested over 50 times for civil disobedience. LaSpina spoke at the 2018 Women's March in New York City, where she discussed experience with sexual abuse while in the hospital and the prevalence of sexual abuse in women with disabilities. She was the Grand Marshall of the 2019 Disability Pride Parade in New York City. In her writing, LaSpina refutes stereotypical narratives of disability, she shows how harmful the overwhelming focus on pity and on an elusive cure can be for those with disabilities.  Writing  LaSpina's articles, essays, and stories have appeared in publications as varied as AbleNews and Ragged Edge, New Politics, And Then, and Bookwoman. Her first book, Such a Pretty Girl: A Story of Struggle, Empowerment, and Disability Pride, was published by New Village Press in 2019.

His playing career lasted 11 years during which time he played for ≈ölƒÖsk Wroc≈Çaw and Lechia Gda≈Ñsk. Career Born in K≈Çodzko, Pƒôkala started playing football for his local team Nysa K≈Çodzko. He eventually joined Piast Nowa Ruda, being transferred to ≈ölƒÖsk Wroc≈Çaw at the age of 15. He made his league debut for ≈ölƒÖsk in August 1977 against Ruch Chorz√≥w at the age of 15, being the youngest ever player to have played for the team. After shining in his early years, his high amount of playing time and early exposure to alcohol abuse took its toll on Pƒôkala's development. During his time with ≈ölƒÖsk he was involved in a night of drinking when he and three other players partied in a T-34 tank outside of a Soviet cemetery. In the winter of 1984 Pƒôkala was involved in a hit and run driving accident, eventually surrendering himself to the authorities. Eventually ≈ölƒÖsk had had enough of the player and his antics and he was transferred to Lechia Gda≈Ñsk in early 1985. In total for ≈ölƒÖsk Pƒôkala made 137 league appearances in the I liga. Pƒôkala made his Lechia debut on 23 March 1985 against ≈ÅKS ≈Å√≥d≈∫. After his initial troubles at ≈ölƒÖsk, Pƒôkala initially had a more structured life and stayed away from alcohol when he joined the club. However Pƒôkala returned back to his lifestyle outside of football. One event that took place during his time with Lechia was that a player was sent to find Pƒôkala after a night of drinking, eventually finding him in the 54th house they checked. Despite his antics frustrating the club and management, the manager at the time, Wojciech ≈Åazarek, saw him as being so important for the team, with ≈Åazarek saying he'd prefer one Pƒôkala than an additional three players on the pitch. Eventually his drinking habits lead to the player retiring from football in 1988 at the age of 27 having made 114 appearances and scored 14 goals in all competitions. International career It is reported that Pƒôkala made nearly 100 appearances for the Polish international youth teams. He made his first team international debut on 25 January 1981 against Japan. In total he received six caps for Poland, four of those coming against Japan during an international team tour of the country in 1981 with the other two games coming against Bulgaria and Finland.

It is designated as a Cultural Property of National Significance History During the Protestant Reformation in the early 16th century, the city of Bern adopted the new Protestant faith and the city's churches converted, leaving the remaining Catholics in Bern without a church. Over the following centuries, they remained without a church in the city. Following the French invasion of Switzerland in 1798 and the political reforms of the Helvetic Republic, the catholic community of Bern held mass in the choir of the Bern Minster until 1803. Beginning in 1804 they moved to the French Church on Zeughausgasse. The Church of St. Peter and Paul was begun in 1858 as the first Catholic church built in Bern since the Reformation. It was built next to the Town Hall of Bern, on the site of the St. Johannsen granary (which had been built over the ruins of a mint which burnt to the ground in 1787). The church was designed by H Marchal and Pierre-Joseph Edmond Deperthes in the style of the Romanesque and French cathedral Gothic. Construction began in 1858 under the supervision of Emmanuel M√ºller and was completed in 1864. The first mass was celebrated in the church on 13 November 1864. Following the First Vatican Council (1869-1870) some Catholics in Switzerland were dissatisfied with the Council and split away from the church to form the Christian Catholic Church of Switzerland. In 1875, the Church of St. Peter and Paul became the parish church of the Old Catholic congregation in Bern. In 1965-67 the bell tower and south facade were renovated, followed by several additional renovations.

Appointed as Peer of France. King Louis XVIII nicknamed him \\"Frenzy\\". Biography =Early Life= Fran√ßois-Auguste Fauveau de Fr√©nilly was born in Paris, France, on 14 November 1768 to Fr√©d√©ric-Auguste Fauveau de Fr√©nilly and Charlotte-Pauline-Victoire Chastelain. His family was of old nobility and was on the same level with the upper magistrature of Paris. Fr√©nilly was educated and trained to attain the highest levels of the French Aristocracy and as such held disdain for the French Revolution. Fr√©nilly studied law under Bishop L√©vesque de Pouilly in Reims, France successfully defending his thesis after three years of dedicated study. After completing his studies, in consultation with his mother and his uncle, Fr√©nilly began preparation for a financial career in anticipation of receiving title to Receiver-General of the Domaines Poitou and Angoumois. =The First Revolution= In anticipation of being granted his titles, Fr√©nilly moved to the provinces and setup office in Poitou in early 1788, learning dominial tasks. While the French Revolution began in the summer of 1789 Fr√©nilly watched from afar. In the spring of 1790, Fr√©nilly suddenly departed the provinces to return to Paris arriving on the eve of July 14, 1790, known as F√™te_de_la_F√©d√©ration. Fr√©nilly settled in to his Mother's estate on Rue Vivienne. Opposite from their house was the estate of Mme. de Lessart, whose son, Claude Antoine de Valdec de Lessart would be massacred at Versailles years later. During this time in 1790, Catherine No√´l Grand would spend an inordinate amount of time visiting Mme. de Lessart in the hopes of gaining the favor of her son. Sometime later before Catherine would marry Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P√©rigord, and become Princesse de B√©n√©vent, Fr√©nilly would find himself at the center of her attentions and they would vacation together to his Lake Cottage. Ultimately, Fr√©nilly would deem Catherine \\"stupid to the point of silliness\\" and avoided further interaction. During this time of turmoil, Fr√©nilly found \\"There were but two means of shining: one by attacking the throne, the other by defending it\\" and that he was not well versed in either. As Paris descended into turmoil in the summer of 1792, Fr√©nilly joined the Filles-Saint-Thomas and established his estate as one of the rally points upon the sound of the general drum. On August 9, 1792 while enjoying dinner with family, The general drum call to arms was sounded. Fr√©nilly rushed to dress himself and assembled with his whole battalion at Boulevard des Italiens. The Batallion des Filles-Saint-Thomas then noiselessly marched to Tuleries and entered the grand terrace by the Pavilion de Marsan Gate.

The after-effects of the Great Depression had increased opposition to colonial rule, with Nanka-Bruce's ineffective performance in the Legislative Council benefiting Thompson. The media campaign quickly descended into abuse; Nanka-Bruce was supported only by the Gold Coast Independent (which he owned) and the Times of West Africa, whilst Thompson receive the backing of the African Morning Post (and its editor Nnamdi Azikiwe), the Gold Coast Spectator, the Provincial Pioneer and Vox Populi. The African Morning Post accused Nanka-Bruce of being a \\"sycophantic Uncle Tom, an ultra-moderate stooge, a self-seeker, a traitor and a mummified yes-man\\".Edsman, p182 Nanka- Bruce used his Gold Coast Independent to label Thompson as an immoral opportunist in twelve successive issues.

The foundation has supported many projects in Charlotte, the city where it is headquartered. It has funded local non-profits that provide services for refugees and asylum seekers. The foundation has also given millions of dollars to anti-immigration groups such as NumbersUSA, the Federation for American Immigration Reform, and the Center for Immigration Studies. This has been the focus of criticism from local and national groups. America‚Äôs Voice, a pro- immigration group, has asked the foundation to stop funding such groups. The foundation's president and CEO, Michael Marsicano, has defended his group's actions in terms of free speech. He asked: \\"Philanthropy is a form of freedom of speech, and I don‚Äôt think any institution should be cutting off freedom of speech on fund-holders. If we did, where would it stop?\\" The bulk of the foundation's donations are made at the direction of donors who may choose to support any IRS-qualified non-profit organization they wish. The Charlotte Observer conducted a review of the ten largest community foundations in the United States and found that the Foundation for the Carolinas was the only one that supported nativist and anti-immigration causes. The foundation is not a unified fund. It is actually a collection of funds worth about $2.6 billion as of late 2019. The foundation helps philanthropists and non-profit organizations with the investment and administration of their assets for a fee.

Within the military popular forms of resistance included combat refusals, fragging, and desertion. By the end of the war at least 600 officers were killed in fraggings, over 300 refused to combat and approximately 50,000 American servicemen deserted.Vietnam War Resisters in Canada Open Arms to U.S. Military Deserters . Pacific News Service. June 28, 2005. Along with resistance inside the U.S. military, civilians opened up various GI Coffeehouses near military bases where civilians could meet with soldiers and could discuss and cooperate in the anti-war movement. History =Early movement (1964-1967)= The early period of soldier resistance to the Vietnam War involved mainly individual acts of resistance. Some well publicized incidents occurred in this period. The first incident was in November 1965 when Lt. Henry H. Howe, Jr was court marshaled for shouting anti-war slogans during a protest in El Paso. Another in 1966 was a case where three soldiers in Fort Hood refused deployment to Vietnam and were reprimanded, gaining the attention of anti-war activists. Later Capt. Howard Levy a dermatologist who would be punished for refusing to train green beret medics being sent to Vietnam. =Growing protests (1968)= In 1968 more collective acts of resistance would take place inside the U.S. military. Many servicemen fled the military and took sanctuary in various churches and universities. Many veterans and servicemen began involving themselves in anti-war marches, and rebellions in military stockades. At the Presidio of San Francisco a protest was staged by servicemen after another soldier was shot for walking away from a work detail. During the protest a group of AWOL soldiers returned to base to join the demonstration. They were arrested and put into the stockade where they convinced other imprisoned troops to stage another protest. =Later dissent (1969-1972)= Demonstrations inside and outside the army were being conducted by servicemen. More dissident soldiers began to oppose racism felt in the United States, its military, and draft policy. By June, 1971, Colonel Robert Heinl declared that the army in Vietnam was \\"dispirited where not near mutinous.\\" in an article in Armed Forces Journal.

After graduating from the London School of Medicine for Women in 1890, Gordon worked at the East London Hospital for Children, the Evelina London Children's Hospital, and later had a private practice in Harley Street. While working as a physician, she made a number of public addresses and wrote publications on topics including the effects of prostitution and alcohol dependence on women. Gordon was appointed as the first British female prison inspector in 1908. During her time as prison inspector, she enacted a number of improvements including on prison work allocation. She also supported the British suffragette movement, and secretly communicated with the Women's Social and Political Union about conditions in prisons. After retirement in 1921, she wrote the book Penal Discipline (1922), which advocated for reforms to the prison system, and the historical novel Chase of the Wild Goose (1936), based on the Ladies of Llangollen. Early life Gordon was born in 15 August 1861 in Seaforth, Lancashire, to James Gordon and his second wife Mary Emily Carter. Her father sold hide and tallow. She had six sisters and three brothers. Gordon also had an older stepsister and stepbrother, their mother Anne Barnsley Shaw had died from consumption in 1855. Gordon studied at the London School of Medicine for Women, and qualified as a doctor with the Triple Qualification in 1890. Career =Physician= After graduation, she worked part-time as the librarian and curator of the school. She later worked as a clinical assistant at the East London Hospital for Children and at the Evelina London Children's Hospital. Gordon joined the Association of Registered Medical Women (ARMW), a precursor to the Medical Women's Federation, in 1891. She also later worked as a physician in Harley Street, London. During this time, she contributed a number of publications and public addresses regarding a variety of topics including the effects of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), prostitution, and alcohol dependence on women. This included writing a letter which had been signed by 73 members of the ARMW in 1898 to Lord George Hamilton, the Secretary of State for India, to criticise measures enacted in the previous year to combat the spread of STDs in the British Army stationed there. The measures included the mandatory medical examinations of women suspected of carrying an STD living near a military building, if they refused they would be expelled from their homes. =Prison reformer= HM Prison Holloway in 1897 In March 1908, Gordon was appointed as a prison inspector. She was the first woman to hold the position. Her role involved the inspection of the female wings of 47 prisons, and the training of female prison officers. She had no formal training prior to being appointed therefore Gordon visited prisons in Europe in order to learn best practice. She soon identified that the majority of female prisoners had short sentences with high rates of recidivism. Gordon supported a rehabilitative approach in prisons to combat this. She organised the prison labour so that menial tasks such as cleaning were assigned to short-term inmates, while more productive roles were given to long-term inmates such as training for jobs when released. Gordon is also credited with physical improvements in conditions in British prisons, such as better lighting in jail cells with the use of clear glass in windows, and introducing notebooks to HM Prison Holloway. She was a supporter of the British suffragette movement, and secretly communicated with Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence and the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) about the state of prisons, and reached out to incarcerated leaders such as Emmeline Pankhurst. When the WSPU headquarters was raided by the police on 23 May 1914, this correspondence was discovered and she was asked by the Home Office to renounce her association with the movement, which she refused to do so. During the First World War, she served from July to December 1916 with the Scottish Women's Hospitals for Foreign Service in Macedonia. By the end of her career, she was marginalised and isolated for her association with the suffragette movement and her \\"feminist\\" approach to her role. When she asked for an increase in her salary in 1919, an official replied by describing her appointment as a \\"sop to feminism\\" and that any further increase would be \\"a concession to the claims of feminism\\". She retired in 1921. =Author= Gordon wrote a novel about the Ladies of Llangollen (pictured) St. Collen's parish church, Llangollen Gordon wrote her first book in 1907 when she was a physician, a novel called A Jury of the Virtuous under the pseudonym of Patrick Hood. It was about a convicted forger called Richard Ransome who is released from prison at the age of 26, and finds it difficult to reintegrate into society. A review in the British Medical Journal commented that the characters were well-written particularly the convict, and that it taught an important moral, \\"let a man strive ever so hard to retrieve the social ruin entailed by crime that is found out, he can never, in the eyes of the world, live down his past\\". A reviewer for the literary magazine The Athenaeum also felt that the characters were well-written but criticised the \\"conventional happy ending\\". The year after her retirement, Gordon wrote the book, Penal Discipline (1922), in which she advocated for reforms to the prison system. She felt that prisons were too focused on punishment and discipline, which encouraged recidivism. Gordon argued for more focus on rehabilitation which included seeking prisoners' views on what would prevent them from reoffending. On one occasion, she describes helping an inmate who was frequently arrested for stealing men's clothes. The inmate told her that \\"she felt it impossible to live as a woman, but could live as a man, and enjoyed men's work\\". Gordon provided her with men's clothing and a train fare to South Wales, where she obtained work as a coal miner. The former inmate later wrote to Gordon to inform her that in the year after her release, she was \\"living respectably\\", and had experienced her first Easter out of prison in ten years. A reviewer for The Guardian newspaper wrote that it was a \\"very humanly and brightly written book\\". The book, along with Sidney and Beatrice Webb's report English Prisons Under Local Government and Stephen Hobhouse and Fenner Brockway's English Prisons Today, prompted calls for an inquiry into prison conditions. Initially this was thought likely as prison commissioners had recognised the need for reform, but after the 1922 general election, the new Home Secretary William Bridgeman decided against it. In later life, Gordon studied analytical psychology with Carl Jung, and his wife Emma in Switzerland. In 1936, she wrote the historical novel Chase of the Wild Goose, based on the Ladies of Llangollen. The book, dedicated to Emma Jung, is split up into three parts. The first two parts cover the women's initial meeting and their time in Ireland and Wales. In the epilogue, she describes a meeting with the ghosts of the ladies in 1934 during a visit to Llangollen. It was published by writer Virginia Woolf, and her husband Leonard. A review in The Guardian praised Gordon for telling \\"their story with sensitiveness and understanding\\" but suggested that some readers would dislike the fantastical nature of the book's epilogue and her characterisation of the women as early examples of feminists. A year after the release of the book, Gordon installed a marble relief of the women at St. Collen's Church in Llangollen, where they were buried. Gordon was highly critical of Virginia Woolf's 1940 biography of artist Roger Fry, particularly in its portrayal of his wife, the artist Helen Coombe, who she was close friends with. She wrote a letter to Woolf describing her reservations about the book. Gordon felt that Coombe had been described in the book as \\"only the pitiful nebulous ghost she had to be\\" rather than the brave and charismatic woman that she knew from her youth. She also felt it did not discuss the potential contribution, from her point of view, of Fry's extroverted personality to the deterioration in Coombe's mental health in later life. It is not known whether Woolf replied to the letter but in previous brief references to Gordon in her writing she did not describe her with warm words. Death Gordon died on 5 May 1941 in the town of Crowborough, Sussex, at the age of 79.

It was owned by the United Broadcasting Company and served as a semi-satellite of its WOOK-TV/WFAN-TV in Washington, D.C., with some locally originated programs. Due to a series of financial and license difficulties at United, WMET-TV closed in January 1972, a month before WFAN-TV. History =Construction permit= Even though the station did not come on the air until March 1967, WMET-TV's construction permit was issued more than 13 years prior in December 1953, as WTLF on channel 18. The channel specified on the permit was changed from 18 to 24 in 1961, as part of a four- way shuffle that primarily served to cluster the operating TV channels in the Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, area, by changing channels 55 and 71 there to 21 and 33. Activity was minimal for most of the first decade. In 1962, United turned its efforts to constructing WOOK-TV, channel 14 in Washington, D.C., and noted that it hoped to put WTLF on the air within six to twelve months of signing on WOOK-TV. However, channel 24 still was not on the air by 1965, when the Federal Communications Commission put pressure on the owners of dark UHF construction permits‚Äîincluding WTLF‚Äîto explain why they should not be withdrawn; also at that time, the FCC denied an application by United to allow WTLF to begin operations on channel 18 before moving to 24. In August 1965, the FCC approved changes to the construction permit reflecting the facilities it would build; the next month, WTLF changed its call letters to WMET-TV. By November 1966, the station neared completion, though it missed its stated launch date. General manager J. Herman Sitrick noted that channel 24 would carry 80 percent of WOOK-TV's African American-oriented programming. Channel 24 was also announced to be the Baltimore outlet for the Overmyer Network when it debuted. =On the air= WMET-TV, Baltimore's fourth TV station and its first in nearly two decades, finally signed on March 1, 1967. Much as WOOK-TV had pivoted to at the same time, channel 24 aired a lineup of mostly news and panel shows at launch, along with a syndicated Western series and Teenarama Dance Party, its Washington sister station's signature show. It also sought to air network programs not being cleared by the other three stations in town. The station's first live program from its Baltimore studios was a three-hour special on April 17, presenting films on both sides of the Vietnam War argument. Channel 24 also aired The Las Vegas Show, the only program of the renamed United Network (no relation to United Broadcasting Company), at midnight when it debuted on May 1; that day, Trails West and the United Network offering were the only programs not shared with WOOK-TV. The station soon added more movies and syndicated programming. It also aired a weekly variety show, Coffee House U.S.A., with regional performers. Pauline Wells Lewis, then a disc jockey at WSID and in the middle of a 50-year career in gospel music and local radio, hosted a Saturday night half-hour. In March 1968, the station appointed a sports director, Frank Holston, and channel 24 began airing a sports call-in show called Sports View. A year later, the station started airing a locally produced children's show, Pogo the Clown, in early evenings. In 1971, the station's news director was 19-year-old John Domenick, a college sophomore who delivered a half-hour newscast at 4:30 p.m. each weekday compiled from wire service material. Channel 24's studios were a converted movie theater, the former Avalon Theater on Park Heights Avenue, which also housed the United Baltimore radio stations; the radio studios occupied the former manager's office and production room, and the auditorium was converted into a studio. =Closure= In 1969, WOOK radio and television received challenges to their licenses, starting years of legal troubles for United Broadcasting. In 1971, United found a proposed buyer for its Baltimore station: the Christian Broadcasting Network, which agreed to pay $750,000 to buy channel 24. At the time, CBN owned just one television station, WYAH-TV in the Norfolk, Virginia, market. However, any action on the sale was contingent on the outcome of the various hearings into UBC operations. Later in the year, United announced it would exit television completely; by this time, CBN had cut its purchase price to $125,000, a sum negotiated after CBN threatened to pull out of the agreement altogether. As United continued to lose money‚Äî$7,000 a month‚Äîrunning channel 24, and with many of its stations in legal limbo, the company took WMET-TV dark on January 14, 1972, and sought permission to remain silent from the FCC until the transfer to CBN was finalized. The FCC Broadcast Bureau granted it 60 days of silence, worried that, if channel 24 were to wait for the CBN sale to return to air, it might be off air for months or years. On February 12, United then took WFAN-TV in Washington dark, citing the company's financial condition. The February 27 edition of the Washington Post, as well as the next day's issue of Broadcasting magazine, carried a full-page \\"In Memoriam\\" ad for WFAN-TV; the ad, taken out by Eaton, revealed that the D.C. station was a money-losing venture. In 1973, while the hearing examiner's initial decision found against WOOK radio and preferred its competing application to the renewal of that station, it found United qualified to be a licensee and recommended renewal of WFAN-TV's (unchallenged) license. United asked the FCC to keep the WFAN-TV and WMET-TV licenses active pending a sale, but the FCC said that because of the multiple and interrelated proceedings against Eaton that were likely to take years, and since the sales were conditioned on hearing actions, that would simply take too long. The commission ordered United to put WFAN-TV and WMET-TV back on the air by July 1, 1973. The deadline was pushed back to December 1; United notified the FCC that it intended to appeal the order. On April 26, 1974, the FCC ruled that both licenses should be revoked so that new applications could be accepted for Washington's channel 14 and Baltimore's channel 24. Channel 24 after WMET- TV In February 1977, Jesus Lives, Inc., whose president hosted a syndicated talk show of the same name, applied to build a new station on channel 24. Jesus Lives ended the comparative hearing in December 1980 by buying out competing applicant Buford Television of Maryland. After years of trying to obtain funding to obtain the facility and the sale of the construction permit, channel 24 returned to Baltimore nearly 14 years after it had left, as WKJL-TV on December 24, 1985.

In 1931, when he was 23, he won the international architectural competition for the Columbus Lighthouse in Santo Domingo Este, Dominican Republic, a memorial monument that was a tribute to Christopher Columbus. Later in his career he became known for the designing of a number of Scottish hospitals. Life Gleave was the son of a farmer, James Gleave and his wife Hannah n√©e Lea. Between September 1923 to September 1927 he studied on a part-time basis at Manchester School of Architecture. In 1927 he was apprenticed to James Theodore Halliday in Manchester for several months, before moving to work with Francis Jones as assistant, between 1927 and 1928. In the same year Gleave moved employment again to Thomas Cecil Howitt from 1929 to 1930. From February 1930 to May 1931 he assisted with Jones & Dalrymple in Manchester. The following year, Gleave was appointed to Edinburgh College of Art as a senior assistant. In 1935, he was promoted to director of the School of Architecture at the college. =World War II= During the war, he was assigned to the Anti-Aircraft Command and reached the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. =After the war= After he returned to the department in 1946, he spent a year redesigning the Columbus Memorial and working on Renfrew Airport along with his brother-in-law, the Scottish architect William Kininmonth. In 1948, Gleave became a partner at Keppie Henderson, with the firm being renamed to Keppie Henderson & J L Gleave. Initially focusing on houses and schools, he constructed the new Engineering Building at the University of Glasgow, which lead to additional work, in the construction of hospitals. Between 1951 and 1955, Gleave worked on the development of Vale of Leven Hospital. At the time, his practice was expanding. Know to be eccentric and unpredictable in his approach, with a penchant for late night working, sometimes as late as 4am, his approach led to differences and eventually arguments with the two other partners in the firm, Henderson and Alex Smellie. This led him in early 1958, to establish his own consultancy, known as J L Gleave. Shortly after he worked on commissions for the Queen Mother Hospital in Glasgow and additions to Glasgow Prestwick Airport. In 1964, he constructed a new science block for the University of Glasgow that was named in honour of Lord John Boyd Orr of Brechin, named as Boyd Orr Building. Orr was a noted biologist and nutritional physiologist, who was Rector between 1945 to 1947 and chancellor from 1946 to 1971. =Death= On 16 January 1965, Gleave died in the Western Infirmary in Glasgow. He has been suffering from cancer for more than a year, but diagnosed in the spring of the year before. His wife, Margaret Grierson Sutherland survived him. He had two children, a daughter Carolyn, who was an interior designer and a son David. His son David also trained as an architect. He would go on to join his fathers old practice in 1987 that changing name as partners came and went and time went on, eventually becoming Young & Gault.

Although she held several roles at the paper, she is best known for the 15 years she spent as the fashion editor. Foster was born in Owen Sound. She began working for the Toronto Telegram in 1916 compiling lists of World War I casualties. She later recalled how seeing the clippings of birth and death announcements pasted in family bibles underscored the importance of getting names right, explaining that: \\"if what I write is going to be that important to any family it's got to be right.\\" She went on to cover various portfolios including suburban affairs and the Board of Education, and wrote biographies of Toronto business figures as part of a series called \\"A Peep Behind the Curtain of Time\\". Historian Majory Lang described Forster as a \\"zealous advocate on behalf of her readers\\" when it came to Foster's time as the author of \\"Shopper\\", a column dedicated to opinions about goods and where to find them in the city. Despite her many roles at the paper, Foster is best known for her work as fashion editor. Beginning in the 1940s, she reported on each of the New York fashion shows for 15 years, with the exception of one season during which time she was a member of the first Canadian tourist party to visit Russia. She was a promoter of Canadian made clothing, regularly serving as a commentator at fashion shows held during the Canadian National Exhibition. Foster remained with the Telegram for forty seven years. Her role at the paper was celebrated in 1951 by 750 friends who gathered to recognize her 35th year at the paper. In response to questions about her retirement she commented \\"I'll go out of here when they have to carry me out.\\" In addition to her work at the Telegram, Forster was a fan of horse racing and was a member of the Canadian Women's Press Club, at one time serving as the Toronto Branch president. She died September 24, 1963 at Toronto's St. Michael's Hospital following a short illness attributed to a heart condition exacerbated by diabetes.

The name in Sanskrit means \\"slow-stepping\\" or \\"slowly advancing\\".Morgan et al. (2011), p. 142. It is said to have been invented by India's most famous poet KƒÅlidƒÅsa,Deo (2007), p. 105. (5th century CE), who used it in his well-known poem (\\"the Cloud-Messenger\\"). The metre characterises the longing of lovers who are separated from each other, expressed in the Sanskrit word \\"separation (of lovers), parting\\".Reddy (2017), preface. Metrical pattern =Modern analysis= A line in has 17 syllables, divided into three sections, each separated by a pause. The first section consists of four long syllables, the second of 5 short syllables and one long, and the third a mixture of long and short alternating, in this pattern: : ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  u u u u u ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì x  As with other Sanskrit metres, the length of the final syllable is indifferent. Deo (2007) argues that the metre is basically trochaic (i.e. consisting of a \\"strong-weak, strong-weak\\" rhythm). She notes that where the third strong beat should come (after the fourth syllable), some performers traditionally leave a pause equivalent to one short syllable; the third strong beat is then silent, and the fourth strong beat then falls on the fourth short syllable. Deo argues that this rhythm is also (a variation of) trochaic, with a strong beat on the 1st, 4th, and 7th syllables. =Relationship to other metres= The final section of 7 syllables is also found at the end of other metres such as , , , , and . The metre, a variety of , goes as follows: : ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì  ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì x  It thus consists of the beginning and end of the without the central section.

He was one of the leading juvenile colt in Japan in 2019 when he was undefeated in three races including the Saudi Arabia Royal Cup and the Asahi Hai Futurity Stakes. Background Salios is a chestnut horse with a narrow white blaze bred in Japan by Northern Farm. He was sent into training with Noriyuki Hori and carries the colours of the Northern Farm associate Silk Racing. He is a large Thoroughbred, weighing over 530 kg. He was from the tenth crop of foals sired by Heart's Cry a horse whose wins included the Arima Kinen and the Dubai Sheema Classic. His other foals have included Suave Richard, Admire Rakti, Just A Way and Lys Gracieux. Salios's dam Salomina was a German-bred mare who showed top-class form in her native country, winning the Preis der Diana in 2012 before being exported to Japan. Salomina's dam Saldentigerin won the Group 3 Baden-W√ºrttemberg-Trophy and was a female-line descendant of the German broodmare Suleika (foaled 1954), making her a relative of Slip Anchor, Buena Vista and Manhattan Cafe. Racing career =2019: two-year-old season= Salios made his debut in an event for previously unraced juveniles over 1600 metres at Tokyo Racecourse on 2 June and won from Absolutismo and six others. After a break of four months the colt returned to the track and was stepped up in class to contest the Grade 3 Saudi Arabia Royal Cup at Tokyo on 5 October when he was ridden by Shu Ishibashi and started the 0.5/1 favourite against eight opponents. He raced in third place before moving up to dispute the lead in the straight and got the better of the filly Cravache d'Or to win by one and a quarter length in a race record time of 1:32.7 for 1600 metres. On 15 December Salios was partnered by Ryan Moore when he started favourite for the Grade 1 Asahi Hai Futurity Stakes at Hanshin Racecourse. His fifteen opponents included Taisei Vision (winner of the Keio Hai Nisai Stakes), Red Bel Jour (Daily Hai Nisai Stakes), Bien Fait (Hakodate Nisai Stakes) and Meiner Grit (Kokura Nisai Stakes). After racing in third place behind Bien Fait and Meisho Titan he went to the front early in the straight and steadily increased his lead to win by two and a half lengths from Taisei Vision. His winning time of 1:33.0 was a new record for the race, beating the mark of 1:33.3 set by Danon Premium in 2017. Ryan Moore commented \\"He was a lovely horse... he was still very green on the turn so he should run even faster in the future. He's a big powerful colt and when I sat on him you get the impression that he's very strong already, but he should improve and be even better as he gets older being the size that he is and hopefully he‚Äôll carry on\\". In January 2020, at the JRA Awards for 2019, Salios finished runner-up in the poll for Best Two-Year-Old Colt, losing to Contrail by 77 votes to 197. In the official Japanese rankings however, Salios was rated the best two-year-old of 2019, one pound ahead of Contrail. =2020: three-year- old season= On his first run of 2020 Salios faced Contrail in a \\"much- anticipated showdown\\" for the Satsuki Sho over 1200 at Nakayama Racecourse and went off the 2.8/1 third choice in the betting. Ridden by the Australian jockey Damian Lane he raced up the inside before taking the lead in the straight but came of second best in a sustained struggle with Contrail, beaten half a length. Noriyuki Hori later said, \\"It was a difficult race last time, and he didn't change leads in the homestraight, as well as not getting the best ground, making things tough for him\\". Lane was again in the saddle when Salios was moved up in distance and started 3.4/1 second favourite behind Contrail for the Tokyo Yushun over 2400 metres at Tokyo. After being restrained in mid-division he was forced to race on the wide outside to obtain racing room and finished strongly but was never able to get on terms with Contrail and finished second, beaten three lengths by the winner.

In his role as town clerk for the town of Pembroke, Massachusetts, he is known as the author of the \\"Pembroke Resolves\\" . He is buried in Pembroke Centre Cemetery, Pembroke, Massachusetts.  The Pembroke Resolves (1772)  The Boston Committee of Correspondence read their Boston Pamphlet at a Boston town meeting held at Faneuil Hall on November 20, 1772, which enumerated many violations against the American colonists by British Parliament and the King of England. The pamphlet called for towns across Massachusetts to form committees of correspondence of their own. The citizens of Pembroke, Massachusetts held a town meeting on December 28, 1772 to discuss the Boston Pamphlet, and came to a collective agreement that the major grievances outlined in the Boston Pamphlet were reasonable, and they further determined to elect a Committee of Correspondence from Pembroke to create a set of their own Resolves against the British administration. Pembroke elected town clerk John Turner Esq., Dr. Jeremiah Hall (a friend of John Adams), Capt. Seth Hatch, Abel Stetson, and Quaker Samuel Goold to the committee. John Turner Esq. authored the official response, and recorded them in the Pembroke town records. The Pembroke Resolves are known for containing one of the early direct references in the American colonies to an impending split with England: > \\"Resolved, that if the measures so justly complained of by this province and > the other colonies on the continent, are persisted in and enforced by fleets > and armies, they must (we think of it with pain) they will in a little time, > issue in the total dissolution of the union between Mother Country and the > colonies, to the infinite loss of the former and regret of the latter.\\"  Legacy  As of 2019, the Turner estate, located at the intersection of Route 14 and Route 53 on Washington St. in Pembroke, is the subject of an archaeological survey by the Fiske Center for Archaeological Research at the University of Massachusetts Boston.

He became a senator of Italy in 1929. Family life Piero Puricelli, Count of Lomnago, was born the son of Angelo and Carlotta Combi. He attended the Federal Polytechnic Institute in Zurich, from which he graduated in Engineering in 1905. Puricelli married Antonietta Tosi; they had one son, Franco. The first Italian motorway Historic route of the Autostrada dei Laghi, 1926 In the period following the First World War, after economic development recommenced in Italy, a project to build a motorway was conceived - that is \\"... a new road reserved exclusively for motor traffic ... \\". In 1922 Puricelli designed the project, connecting Milan to Lake Como and Lake Maggiore. On September 20, 1923, King Vittorio Emanuele III inaugurated the first section of the motorway, to Gallarate. For its time, this was a futuristic work: the cart and the bicycle were still the dominant means of personal transport in Italy at the time, and there were no more than 85,000 motor vehicles in Italy in 1924, half in Lombardy. On September 21, 1924, the extension to Varese was inaugurated. The Autostrada dei Laghi was the first exclusive-use motorway built in the world because the high-speed AVUS road in Berlin was also used as a test track for motor vehicles. :it:Autostrada dei Laghi The Monza Racetrack Monza track, 1922 The Autodromo Nazionale di Monza (Monza National Racetrack) project was assigned to Arturo Mercanti, then director of the Automobile Club of Milan, and the engineers Alfredo Rosselli and Piero Puricelli. The overall length was , comprising a loop track, and a road track. The Automobile Club commissioned the construction of the racetrack in January 1922 to commemorate its twenty-fifth anniversary. Work began on May 15 and was completed in just 110 days. Pietro Bordino and Felice Nazzaro completed the first lap of the track on July 28 in a Fiat 570. The national racetrack was the third permanent circuit in the world, preceded only by the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in the United States and by the English one at Brooklands, no longer in existence today. The choice of Monza was the result of studies seeking a location near Milan, to limit the \\"travel\\" costs for the maintenance of the racetrack. Setting aside alternative sites near Gallarate and Gagnola (a peripheral location in Milan), the directors of the ACI chose the park at the Villa Reale in Monza.The circuit was then known as \\"the fastest in the world\\". Political career Puricelli was appointed Senator on February 26, 1929, proposed by the Italian National Fascist Party and remained in office until his removal by the Alta Corte di Giustizia per le Sanzioni contro il Fascismo (High Court of Justice for Sanctions against Fascism) in 1945, for having been one of the \\"senators held responsible for maintaining fascism and making war possible, both by their votes and by their individual actions, including the propaganda exercised outside and inside the Senate.\\" In July 1946 he was acquitted of the charge of collaboration. Appointments Among the appointments Piero Puricelli held are: * Vice-president of the Bureau International des Expositions * Member of the Italian National Research Council * 1923 Member of the Superior Council of Public Works * 1927 President of the Milan Fair (until 1943) * 1929 President of the public companies La strada and Autostrade * 1931 President of the International Union of Trade Shows * 1940 General Commissioner for Italy at the International Communications Exhibition in Cologne Italian honors * Cavaliere di Gran Croce decorato di Gran Cordone dell'Ordine della Corona d'Italia - nastrino per uniforme ordinaria (Knight of the Grand Cross decorated with the Great Cord of the Order of the Crown of Italy) - June 8, 1933 * Grand'Ufficiale dell'Ordine della Corona d'Italia - nastrino per uniforme ordinaria (Grand Officer of the Order of the Crown of Italy) - 3 June 1923 * Commendatore dell'Ordine della Corona d'Italia - nastrino per uniforme ordinaria (Commander of the Order of the Crown of Italy) - 14 January 1917 * Laurea honoris causa in ingegneria dal Politecnico di Milano - nastrino per uniforme ordinaria (Honorary degree in engineering from the Politecnico di Milano) - 1927 References Category:1883 births Category:1951 deaths Category:Italian politicians Category:Italian Fascism Category:Italian engineers Category:National Fascist Party politicians Category:20th-century engineers ","title":"Piero Puricelli"},{"id":"62616315","text":"Yekaterinburgsky Uyezd (–ï–∫–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–Ω–±—É—Ä–≥—Å–∫–∏–π —É–µ–∑–¥) was one of the subdivisions of the Perm Governorate of the Russian Empire.

She is best known for starring at the world famous jazz club Cotton Club in New York.  Live  At the age of nine she won her first dance contest doing the Charleston. Her first professional engagement was in a Broadway musical revue Black Birds of 1928 where she started out as chorus girl. Boisseau was married to Frederick D. Ramseur, who died in 2000. Her son is Sterling Bough, a dancer, singer, actor and choreographer. Boisseau died in New York at the age of 100. She is reported to be the last of the Cotton Club girls. Boisseau is buried at Calverton Cemetery in Calverton, New York.  Career  In the early 1930s Boisseau began performing at the Cotton Club, a night club in New York that featured numerous well-known African American jazz musicians and entertainers from 1923 to 1940, through the Prohibition era. She was often on the stage with Ethel Waters, the Nicholas Brothers, Eubie Blake, Noble Sisle, and Lena Horne. The Cotton Club was Boisseau‚Äôs base until she moved to France and became famous during Paris‚Äô Jazz Age. In 1931 she performed in Broadway musical revue Fast and Furious. She left for Paris briefly around 1935 along with other African American entertainers of the time as they were treated better and more appreciated among Europeans. Eventually Boisseau returned to Harlem and lived in an apartment a few streets away from the Cotton Club. She returned to a chorus job at Harlem Apollo Theatre where she worked together with singer George Dewey Washington. She was one of sixteen female dancers who made up the Apollo chorus line and were considered to be the best female dancers in New York. Among other notable dancers who worked in the chorus line during the 1930s were Ristina Banks, Carol Carter, Marion Evelyn Edwards, Elaine Ellis, Myrtle Hawkings, Temy Fletcher, Cleo Hayes and others. In 1939 Boisseau performed as dancing chorus in Lew Leslie‚Äôs Blackbirds of 1939 in Broadway Hudson Theatre. The same year she was rated as one of the most proficient chorus girls in the country. In 1943 Boisseau starred in the movie Stormy Weather. The same year she did choreography at the Hollywood Club in Hollywood, California. In early 1980s Boisseau was hired as a consultant for the film The Cotton Club. She, like the majority of the Cotton Clubs Girls, criticized the film as it didn‚Äôt accurately capture the history of the club and the famous chorus line, focusing more on violence and gangsters. In 1984 Boisseau starred in a cabaret musical entertainment Shades of Harlem. It re-creates Harlem‚Äôs Cotton Club in the decade of the 20‚Äôs. Boisseau appeared in Shades of Harlem as one of there Renaissance Ladies along with two others former Cotton Club Dancers. In 2002 Boisseau was the subject of the documentary Cotton Club Girl. The film draws the portrait of her personality showing her current life and memories from the 1930s when she danced in the Cotton Club working with Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong.

By October 2020, nearly 1,300 websites linked to Timpone, most of which presented themselves as local news outlets. According to the New York Times, Timpone's \\"operation is rooted in deception, eschewing hallmarks of news reporting like fairness and transparency.\\" His sites publish articles for pay from outside groups, and do not disclose it. Education and early career Timpone graduated from Marian Catholic High School in Chicago Heights. He received a bachelor's degree in broadcast journalism from the University of Missouri-Columbia; while attending, he covered sports and news for the University-owned KOMU-TV. After school, he took a job at KDLH in Duluth, Minnesota, which he worked for less than a year before taking another TV job in Champaign, Illinois. Timpone was hired as the personal spokesman to Illinois House Minority Leader Lee A. Daniels in 1997. News publishing Timpone is involved with a number of interconnected media companies, including Local Government Information Services (LGIS), which he co-founded, as well as Metric Media, Franklin Archer, Locality Labs (formerly known as Journatic and LocalLabs), and Record Inc. Journatic (a portmanteau of \\"journalism\\" and \\"automatic\\") was founded by Timpone in 2006. According to Timpone, Journatic used news data processed by workers in the Philippines, but the writers of the articles were all domestic. Journatic managed TribLocal, a hyperlocal news branch of the Chicago Tribune that targeted suburban neighborhoods around Chicago, in the spring of 2012. In a June 2012 episode of This American Life, Timpone disclosed that Journatic was outsourcing its writing to over 300 freelancers using fake bylines in several geographic areas outside of the United States, including the Philippines, Eastern Europe, Brazil, and Africa. Following the release of the episode and the discovery of plagiarism in Journatic's articles, the Chicago Tribune, Chicago Sun-Times, and Gatehouse Media suspended their relationships with the company. Journatic would rebrand as \\"Locality Labs\\" in 2013. According to a 2020 New York Times report, Timpone's network controlled 1,211 sites that presented themselves as local or state news. His companies also delivered unsolicited free newspapers in some towns. In 2019, Locality Labs delivered the Hinsdale School News, using the logo of the local school district to residents of Hinsdale, Illinois. The paper had a heavy focus on articles opposing the upcoming refurendum, which would've raised the school's budget. Officials from the district sent cease and desist letters to several companies in the Timpone network, stating that the use of its logos were deceptive and an instance of trademark infringement.

Set in an open world, the world is partially pre-made and partially randomly generated. The game takes place in a post-apocalyptic science fantasy setting and is inspired by the pen-and-paper role-playing games Gamma World and Dungeons & Dragons.  Gameplay  Contrary to other traditional roguelikes, the game has a quest system as a core mechanic, with some of these quests being scripted while others are procedurally generated. Players can choose to follow the main questline but can also choose to ignore it and play the game without following the pre-written plot. When creating a character, the player can select either a \\"True Kin\\" (unmutated humans) who have higher base stats and access to cybernetic augmentations, or a mutant that has access to both physical and mental mutations that offer a wide degree of utility. The default starting location is the pre-made town of Joppa, but it is also possible to choose to spawn in one of the many procedurally generated towns. A player has their reputation with various factions change due to their decisions and relationships. The game has \\"deeply simulated physical and political systems\\" which are randomly generated and different each session. It generates a set of historical events and group relationships mostly centered around a set of five randomly generated ancient rulers, dubbed Sultans. It takes inspiration from the history systems of the games Dwarf Fortress and Epitaph. Instead of having historical events being generated without bias, its procedural history system is based around historical accounts, like word of mouth and ancient texts.  Reception  While some rate the game as being more accessible compared to other roguelikes, other reviews find the game's interface confusing and are deterred by the lack of an in-depth tutorial.

Together with Jeremy Howard, she is co-founder of fast.ai. Thomas was selected by Forbes magazine as one of the 20 most incredible women in artificial intelligence.  Early life and education  Thomas grew up in Galveston and went to a large, poor public high school that the New York Times ranked as one of the 2% in Texas that are \\"academically unacceptable\\". At high school she began programming in C++. Both of her parent have graduate degrees. Thomas earned her bachelor's degree in mathematics at Swarthmore College. At Swarthmore she was elected to the Phi Beta Delta honor society. She moved to Duke University for her graduate studies, where she came across significant discriminatory behavior, and finished her PhD in mathematics in 2010. Her doctoral research involved a mathematical analysis of biochemical networks. During her doctorate she completed an internship at RTI International where she developed Markov models to evaluate HIV treatment protocols. Thomas joined Exelon as a quantitative analyst, where she scraped internet data and built models to provide information to energy traders. In 2013 Thomas joined Uber where she developed the driver interface and surge algorithms using machine learning. She then became a teacher at Hackbright Academy, a school for women software engineers.  Research and career  Thomas joined the University of San Francisco in 2016 where she founded and now directs the Center for Applied Data Ethics. Here she has studied the rise of deepfakes, bias in machine learning and deep learning. When Thomas started to develop neural networks, only a few academics were doing so, and she was concerned that there was a lack of sharing of practical advice. Whilst there is a considerable recruitment demand for artificial intelligence intelligence researchers, Thomas has argued that even though these careers have traditionally required a PhD, access to supercomputers and large data sets, these are not essential prerequisites. To overcome this apparent skills gap, Thomas established Practical Deep Learning For Coders, the first university accredited open access certificate in deep learning, as well as creating the first open access machine learning programming library. Thomas and Jeremy Howard co-founded fast.ai, a research laboratory that looks to make deep learning more accessible. Her students have included a Canadian dairy farmer, African doctors and a French mathematics teacher. Thomas has studied unconscious bias in machine learning, and emphasised that even when race and gender are nor explicit input variables in a particular data set, algorithms can become racist and sexist when that information becomes latently encoded on other variables. Alongside her academic career, Thomas has called for more diverse workforces to prevent bias in systems using artificial intelligence. She believes that there should be more people from historically underrepresented groups working in tech to mitigate some of the harms that certain technologies may cause as well as to ensure that the systems created benefit all of society. In particular, she is concerned about the retention of women and people of colour in tech jobs. Thomas serves on the Board of Directors of Women in Machine Learning (WiML). She served as an advisor for Deep Learning Indaba, a non-profit which looks to train African people in machine learning. In 2017 she was selected by Forbes magazine as one of 20+ \\"leading women\\" in artificial intelligence.  Work on data ethics and diversity  Thomas is concerned about the lack of diversity in AI, and believes that there are a lot of qualified people out there who are not getting hired. She has particularly focused on the problem of poor retention of women in tech, noting that \\"41% of women working in tech leave within 10 years. That's over twice the attrition rate for men. And those with advanced degrees, who presumably have more options, are 176% more likely to leave.\\" Thomas believes AI's \\"cool and exclusive aura\\" needs to be broken in order to unlock it for outsiders, and to make it accessible to those with non-traditional and non-elite backgrounds.

Sloane MS 1201. Banbury cheese was an English cheese produced in Banbury, Oxfordshire. Once one of the town's most prestigious exports, and nationally famous, the production of the cheese went into decline by the 18th century, and was eventually forgotten. The cheese is best known today through an insult in Shakespeare's Merry Wives of Windsor (1597). History Banbury cheeses first appear in the historical record in 1430, when fourteen were sent to John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford, among supplies for France. In 1586, William Camden spoke of the cheese as a source of fame for the town. The earliest printed cookbook to make reference to the cheese was Thomas Dawson's The Good Huswifes Handmaide for the Kitchin (1594), used in a recipe for the \\"tarte of Cheese\\". The cheese was renowned in its day. It was given as a gift to several significant figures, including Thomas Cromwell (1533 and 1538), Sir Joseph Williamson (1677), and Horace Walpole (1768). Barnaby Googe, in his 1614 guide to husbandry, called in the third best cheese in England. Robert Burton was even more flattering in his Anatomy of Melancholy (1621): \\"Of all cheeses, I take that kind which we call Banbury Cheese to be the best\\". According to the Victoria County History, \\"in the sixteenth century the name of Banbury at once brought to the mind of the hearer the famous cheeses\\". Historically, Banbury's chief exports were its ale, cheese, and cakes. Banbury ale enjoyed a high of popularity in the middle ages, but was virtually unknown outside the town into the 16th century; Banbury cakes maintain popularity today. The production of Banbury cheese essentially constituted a cottage industry. The centre of the cheese-making industry in the area was in the Northamptonshire hamlets, Grimsbury and Nethercote, though some producers were found within the town and in nearby Oxfordshire hamlets. Records from 1600 show twenty-one residences in the parish of Cropredy, four miles north of Banbury, were cheese-makers. The first Thursday after Old Michaelmas was traditionally a cheese fair in Banbury. The production of Banbury cheese declined into the 18th century; Edward Chamberlayne in 1700, Daniel Defoe in 1727, and Richard Pococke in 1756 were among the last to comment on it. By the 19th-century, Alfred Beesley reported in his History of Banbury (1841), \\"the oft-recorded fame of the town for Cheese has departed from it, and the knowledge of the manufacture of the real \\"Banbury Cheese\\" is perhaps now unknown\\". A special form of Banbury cheese, latter-made cheese, was the last to disappear. By 1840, the number of producers of this cheese was diminishing, and in 1848, for the first time, none was offered for sale at the Banbury fair. Local historian Martin Thomas has speculated that the late-18th-century Inclosure Acts were responsible for the decline in the production of the cheese. As land was taken from commoners and appropriated by new landlords, the new owners may have preferred the more profitable sheep over cattle, and so the town would begin to lack the products necessary for the cheese's production. Some attempt has been made to revive the cheese. In 1965, a recipe for the cheese was rediscovered. The Historical Society of Banbury attempted to find a cheese-maker to produce the cheese for the November 1969 annual dinner of the Society, but no capable cheese-makers were found, so the enterprise failed. Description The cheese was made from cow's milk, with a golden yellow colour and a strong flavour. It was made in rounds, with an outer skin, and was only about one inch thick. Jones' Good Huswifes Handmaid (1594) described it with a keen, sharp flavour; Defoe described it as soft and rich; and Camden described it as creamy. According to Defoe, a special form of very rich Banbury cheese was late in the year, never before Michaelmas, called \\"latter-made\\" cheese. It was white and one-inch thick‚Äîotherwise unremarkable as compared to other soft cheeses‚Äîbut commanded high prices and was much more delicious. Defoe reports it cost 1s 6d per pound, new, and about 1s 9d, ripe (equivalent ¬£8.90 and ¬£10.40 in 2010 GBP, according to Thomas). A recipe for the cheese survives in the 15th/16th- century manuscript, Sloane MS 1201: Insult In The Merry Wives of Windsor, Bardolph addresses Abraham Slender with reference to the Banbury cheese: This insult alludes to the thin proportions of the cheese, especially after its rind was removed, mocking Slender's name and figure. This comparison was apparently a common one. A variant is found as early as 1538, when James Dyer reported that a judge in the Court of Common Pleas pithily \\"compared the case to a Banbury cheese, which is worth little when the parings are cut off. And here the case is brief in substance, if the superfluous trifling that is pleaded be taken away\\". A similar insult is made in Jack Dunn's Entertainment (1601): \\"Put off your clothes and you are like a Banbury cheese‚Äînothing but paring\\". According to linguist Frederic S. Marquardt, writing in 1928, \\"you Banbury cheese\\" was still in the common use among American slang; a simplified American descendant of the insult was \\"you big cheese.\\" See also * History of cheese * List of cheeses References Sources      * Category:Banbury Category:English cheeses Category:Historical foods ","title":"Banbury cheese"},{"id":"62616952","text":"Kolong may refer to: * Kolong River, a river in Assam, India * Kolong (film), a 2019 Malaysian horror film * Kolong language, spoken in parts of Himachal Pradesh  See also  * Kulung (disambiguation) ","title":"Kolong"},{"id":"62616997","text":"James P.

Precision railroading or precision scheduled railroading (PSR) is a concept in freight railroad operations pioneered by E. Hunter Harrison. It shifts the focus from older practices, such as unit trains, hub and spoke operations and individual car switching at hump yards, to emphasize point-to- point freight car movements on simplified routing networks. Under PSR, freight trains operate on fixed schedules, much like passenger trains, instead of being dispatched whenever a sufficient number of loaded cars are available. In the past, container trains and general merchandise trains operated separately; under PSR they are combined as needed. Inventories of freight cars and locomotives are reduced and fewer workers are employed for a given level of traffic. The result is often substantial improvement in railroad operating ratios, and other financial and operating metrics. Variations on the method have been adopted by most North American Class I railroads, with the notable exception of BNSF, as of 2019. Harrison first introduced PSR at the Illinois Central Railroad (IC), where he became CEO in 1993. He implemented it at Canadian National after they acquired IC in 1998. After retiring from Canadian National, Harrison was recruited to take over leadership of the Canadian Pacific and implemented precision railroading there. In March 2017, he was appointed CEO of CSX Transportation and began implementing PSR on its large network, but he died eight months later. His successors have continued his PSR program. Precision railroading has been criticized on many fronts. Shippers complain about poorer service and confusion during the transition. Under PSR, service is typically eliminated on shipping lanes, origin-destination pairs, that have low traffic levels. Intermodal terminals have been consolidated, with the railroad relying on trucks for the last hundred miles. Fewer workers are needed, even with higher traffic volumes. As a result, over 20,000 railroad workers have been laid off in 2019.https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/railroads-are-slashing- workers-cheered-on-by-wall-street-to-stay-profitable-amid-trumps-trade- war/2020/01/02/dc757ed4-1603-11ea-a659-7d69641c6ff7_story.html PSR advocates claim that shippers benefit in the long run from reduced costs and more reliable schedules. Railroads that have implemented precision railroading include Union Pacific, CSX, Norfolk Southern, Canadian National, Canadian Pacific, and Kansas City Southern.

In 1965, he became the member of parliament for the Ho constituency, a constituency that was formed from the merging of the Ho East and Ho West constituencies. Prior to Attigah entering parliament, the Ho East constituency was represented by Rev. F. R. Amewotobla. Rev. Amewotobla was wanted for detention under the Preventive Detention Act and consequently sought political asylum in Togo in March 1960. The Ho East seat was then declared vacant and Attigah was elected on the ticket of the Convention People's Party to occupy the seat. Attigah was sworn into office together with Hans Kofi Boni (then the new member for the Ho West constituency) on 11 August 1960.

As built, she had measured 192,679 gross tons and 406,640 deadweight tons, with a length of and a beam of . She was powered by a single steam turbine that gave her a service speed of . In 1987, Esso Japan was converted into an unpropelled storage vessel and renamed Safer. She was moored about off of the coast of Yemen in 1988 under the ownership of the Yemeni government via the national oil company, which used her to store and export oil from inland oil fields around Ma'rib. In her storage configuration, Safer has a capacity of about three million barrels of oil. In March 2015, in the early days of the Yemeni Civil War, Safer fell into the hands of Houthi forces when they took control of the coastline surrounding her mooring. In the following years, her structural condition deteriorated significantly, leading to the risk of a catastrophic hull breach or explosion of oil vapors that would typically be suppressed by inert gas generated on board. The ship is estimated to contain about 1.14 million barrels of oil valued at up to US$80 million, which became a point of contention in negotiations between the Houthi rebels and Yemeni government, both of which asserted claims to the cargo and vessel. In early December 2019, Al Jazeera reported that oil had begun to leak from Safer, though subsequent satellite imagery showed that the report had been inaccurate and there was no sign of oil outflow from the ship. Following a leak in the cooling system, water entered the machine room, prompting the United Nations Security Council to hold a special meeting about it in July 2020. On 15 July 2020, the United Nations warned that the FSO Safer could spill four times as much oil as the Exxon Valdez oil spill. On 24 September 2020, Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United Nations wrote in a letter that experts had observed that \\"a pipeline attached to the vessel is suspected to have been separated from the stabilizers holding it to the bottom and is now floating on the surface of the sea.\\"  Weblinks  * FSO Safer at MarineTraffic References Category:1976 ships Category:Ships built by Hitachi Zosen Corporation Category:Floating production storage and offloading vessels ","title":"FSO Safer"},{"id":"62617566","text":"The P√©ribonka East River is a tributary of the P√©ribonka River, flowing in the province of Quebec, in Canada.

This problem is widely studied in computer vision, natural language processing and machine perception. Unlike standard generalization in machine learning, where classifiers are expected to correctly classify new samples to classes they have already observed during training, in ZSL, no samples from the classes have been given during training the classifier. It can therefore be viewed as an extreme case of domain adaptation.  Prerequisite information for zero- shot classes  Naturally, some form of side information has to be given about these zero-shot classes, and this type of information can be of several types. * Learning with attributes: classes are accompanied by pre-defined structured description. For example, for bird descriptions, this could include \\"red head\\", \\"long beak\\" . These attributes are often organized in a structured compositional way, and taking that structure into account improves learning * Learning from textual description. Here classes are accompanied by free-text natural-language description. This could include for example a wikipedia description of the class * Class-class similarity. Here, classes are embedded in a continuous space. a zero-shot classifier can predict that a samples correspond to some position in that space, and the nearest embedded class is used as a predicted class, even if no such samples were observed during training.  Generalized zero-shot learning  The above ZSL setup assumes that at test time, only zero-shot samples are given, namely, samples from new unseen classes. In generalized zero-shot learning, samples from both new and known classes, may appear at test time. This poses new challenges for classifiers at test time, because it is very challenging to estimate if a given sample is new or known. Few approaches to handle this include: * A gating approach. Here an additional module is first trained to decide if a given sample comes from a new class or from an old one. The gater could output a hard decision , but emitting a soft probabilistic decision further improves the accuracy of this line of approaches * Generative approaches. Here, a generative model is trained to generate feature representation of the unseen classes. Then a standard classifier is trained given samples from all classes, seen and unseen. = Domains of application = Zero shot learning has been applied to the following fields: * image classification * semantic segmentation * image generation * object detection * natural language processing  References  Category:Machine learning algorithms Category:Computer vision ","title":"Zero-shot learning"},{"id":"62617606","text":"USA-289, also known as GPS-III SV01 or Vespucci, is an United States navigation satellite which forms part of the Global Positioning System.

Usage history =Russian Empire= The march was used as an unofficial national anthem in imperial times. =Modern Russia= March of the Preobrazhensky was often used in modern Russia, particularly in the annual Victory Day Parade for the trooping of the colours (Flag of Russia and Banner of Victory), notably at the 2005 Victory Day Parade. However as of 2010 The Sacred War has been played instead, both for the trooping of flagsMarch; and the inspection of troops. It is not believed to have been officially used in the Soviet Union much, but it was played by Soviet military bands in concerts and, infrequently, during the inspection segment of parades. =Other uses= Before World War I, the work was used as the presentation march (Prasentiermarsch) in several military formations in Prussia Since 1964 is used as the slow march of the Royal Marines in the arrangement of Francis Vivian Dunn.

Judging from an old title of the march, \\"March of the Peter the Great\\", some conjecture that it was written in the time of Peter the Great. Some European scholars suggested Swedish authorship, but there is no evidence to that. In German sources the name of Ferdinand Haase (1788‚Äî1851) is mentioned.

It has a long, low-profile hood and a high-visibility cab. Designed as straight trucks for local construction, waste removal, and other vocational jobs it is also available as a semi-tractor. Introduced in 2001 it remains in production in 2020.  Design  The Granite is a long-hood conventional. It measures 117.5 from the bumper to the back of the cab. Designed for local use it usually has a day-cab but a 36\\" integral sleeper is available. Commonly a 6x4 (3 axles, 2 powered) there are packages from 4x2 (2 axles, 1 powered) to 8x6 (4 axles, 3 powered) and can be fitted with driven front, tandem-steer, lift, and extended trailing axles. Total loaded weight can be up to on four axles. Advanced electronics are used for engine, chassis, and body controls, as well as maintenance. All trucks have ABS. Mack builds their own major components (engines, transmissions, axles, and suspensions) and the Granite has specific packages for different applications. Most vendor components are also available but engine choice is very limited.  Engines  The Granite is available with two Mack diesels, a Cummins diesel, and a Cummins Westport natural gas engine. Between 2003 and 2005 an earlier generation Mack diesel was used. The Mack MP7 is the base engine in the Granite. It is a overhead cam turbocharged inline six-cylinder engine. It develops and of torque. The Mack MP8 is the largest engine in the Granite. It is a overhead cam turbocharged inline six-cylinder engine. It develops and of torque. The Cummins ISL9 used in the Granite MHD when weight is more important than power. It is a turbocharged inline six-cylinder engine. It develops and of torque. The Cummins Westport L9N is a natural gas engine able to be set up to use either a CNG or LPG. It is a turbocharged spark ignition inline six- cylinder engine. It develops and of torque. The Mack AMI series was used in the Granite between 2003 and 2005. It is a turbocharged inline six-cylinder engine. It develops and of torque.  Transmissions  Both Mack and Eaton- Fuller have manual and automated shifting models. Manual transmissions have five or six main gears, extra ratios are made with different combinations of ranges. Allison transmissions are fully automatic. Mack mDRIVE automated manual is the Granite's base transmission. It has no clutch pedal and shifts itself on demand. The driver can override it but it is normally driven in \\"D\\". It can have 12, 13, or 14-speeds. Other Mack manual transmissions have from 8- to 18-speeds. Eaton-Fuller UltraShift automated shifting systems are available on all of their transmissions from 9- to 18-speeds. Allison RDS series 5- or 6-speed transmissions are available. The RDS is a fully automatic planetary gear transmission with a lock-up torque converter.  Frame  A ladder frame with beam axles is used. Normally there is a single undriven front axle on semi-elliptical leaf springs, but driven and tandem steer (popular in Canada) axles are available. The base rear suspension is a Mack tandem (two powered axles). Granites are also available with single and tridem (three driven) axles, different axle/suspension combination types. Lift axles can be installed by either Mack or bodybuilders. Up to three axles can be driven. Wheelbases are from A set-forward or set-back front axle is offered. A set forward axle, with the tires immediately behind a straight bumper, is used when overall length is limited or when wheelbase has to be as long as possible for bridge-formula laws. Set back axles, where the hood extends in front of the axle, are used when maneuverability is more important than length or weight distribution. Dana-Spicer and Meritor supply air brakes, steering systems, driveshafts, and other components.  Axles and suspensions  Front axles are available from , Dana-Spicer and Meritor driven axles up to are also available. Multi-leaf leaf springs are base, tapered leaves are optional. Mack powered axles have the drive carrier on top of the housing. This lets the driveshafts be in line from the transmission to and between the axles at a higher level above the ground. With the higher level above the ground the driveshafts and u-joints are less prone to dirt and damage, important in on/off road construction. Other powered axles are available from Dana-Spicer and Meritor. These have front mounted carriers and in tandems the two axle housings are different. Single rear axles rated at are available from Mack and Meritor. The Camelback tandem is the base rear suspension. The Camelback has multiple leaves that rock above the bogey pivot then curve down and under the axles. It is strong in on/off-road service. It is available in ratings of . The mRIDE tandem has tapered leaves that rock above the bogey pivot then go out and above the axles. Struts go from the bottom of the bogey pivot out and under the axle. They have more wheel travel and ground clearance than the camelback. They are rated at . The Twin Y air suspension has trailing arms that fork to the rear and attach to both the top and bottom of the axle. There is an air bag behind the axle on each side and each axle is sprung individually. They are rated at . Walking beams have low bogie pivots with a balance beam going out and under the axles. Any suspension is above the bogey pivot. They can have leaf springs, rubber load cushions, air bags, or be solidly mounted. Walking beams are very stable at low speeds and when stopped. Mack and Hendrickson models are available. Vendor tandems from Chalmers, Hendrickson, Meritor, and RAYCO are rated at up to . Meritor tridems (three powered axles) rated at are needed for maximum weight trucks regardless of any other extra axles.  Applications  Mack has standard packages for dump, concrete mixer, roll-off, and rear loader bodies, as well as semi-tractor. Other packages can be special ordered. = Construction = The Granite, with its extra heavy-duty chassis, high ground clearance, and high-visibility cab, was designed to be operated on construction\\" job sites\\". Dump trucks are the first standard packages. Typically 6x4 (three axles, two driven) lift axles are available. Body builders can add lift axles and extended trailing axles for higher weights. Concrete mixers are operated on/off-road locally at high weights. Available driven front axles are often used on mixers. Mixers often can benefit from a set forward front axle and extended trailing axle for increased bridge formula weights. Other types like flatbeds, including those that self-unload by dumping or with their own crane, Volumetric concrete mixers, and cranes can use the strong chassis. = Refuse = Refuse is largely on-road use and doesn't need as much power as off-road use. Mack suggests that the Granite MHD with the lighter and less-powerful Cummins ISL9 engines be used. Roll-off container trucks have a container that is raised in the front and slides off the back of the truck onto the ground. When a loaded box is carried it can be unloaded like a dump truck. They commonly haul construction debris but refuse containers are also left at commercial sites. Rear-loading compactor bodies have a large hopper on the rear end. Typically a rear crew can load loose material, bins with assist, oversize pieces, and small containers. They are used for residential and light commercial pickup. = Semi-tractor = There are semi-tractor packages but the Granite was designed primarily as a straight truck. = Snow plowing = In the northern United States snow-plowing is a severe service that the Granite is suited for. The Granite has high ground clearances as designed, Mack has an increased frame height option to give under-truck blades even more clearance. Reinforced front frame rail extensions are available. A number of cold-weather options include heated windshield, windows, mirrors, and mechanical components. = Other uses = The Granite can also be built to custom designs for most local heavy-duty applications. Vocational, utility, heavy delivery, any application that needs a strong chassis.

At its founding in March 1842, it was the 28th congregation in what would later become South Africa and the tenth outside of the Western and Southern Cape Synod. Background The congregation was founded on the banks of the Mooi River thanks to the efforts of Rev. Daniel Lindley, an American missionary who arrived in the Natal Colony shortly after the Great Trek and was moved by the plight of the pastor-less Voortrekker congregations. The Natalia Republic Volksraad appointed him as region-wide minister after he furnished proof of his ordination as a pastor of the Presbyterian Church in America. The church followed Cape patterns closely, and Rev. Lindley thus served an area stretching from Winburg to Potchefstroom. Foundation Early the year after his appointment, Rev. Lindley arrived at the banks of the Mooi, and on March 26, 1842, he met members for the first time and baptized several children. This date is regarded as the foundation of the first congregation east of the Vaal. The first two registers record 103 confirmed and 188 baptized members, whom he returned to Potchefstroom to visit in 1844 and 1846. In 1848, Drs. Philip Eduard Faure and William Robertson became the first representatives of the Cape Church to visit Potchefstroom as it shifted toward serving members outside colonial boundaries. First building, 1851 Just before the foundation of the congregation, on November 1, 1841, Commandant Hendrik Potgieter circulated a donation list to fund the construction of a church building. The Rev. Andrew Murray, Jr. became the minister of Bloemfontein in 1848 and started visiting Potchefstroom regularly as a consulent that year, preaching at the site on his third visit. Murray‚Äôs brother Rev. (and later Prof.) John Murray opened the finished church on April 19, 1851. Rev. Andrew Murray returned to visit the following year, accompanied by Rev. J.H. Neethling. NHK breakaway No ministers from back west, however, wanted to settle in the pioneer settlement. Therefore, the congregation did not get its first pastor until the arrival of Rev. Dirk van der Hoff from the Netherlands on June 6, 1853. The Rev. Andrew Murray was to ordain him, but this was postponed and avoided when the church council decided in November of that year to separate from the Cape Church and found separate Transvaal denomination, the Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa (NHK). However, many members left by Elder Wessel Badenhorst refused to follow Rev. Van der Hoff and stayed in the NGK. The NGK worshipers had to make do with visiting preachers until Rev. Frans Lion Cachet arrived from Utrecht to help organize them. First pastor The first official pastor of the Potchefstroom NGK, however, was proponent J.P. Jooste, appointed in 1868 and serving until 1881, during which time a new church was built to replace the old NHK one. By 1889, Rev. H.J.L. du Toit and Rev. C.D. du Toit were NGK and NHK ministers respectively. The Rev. H.J.L. du Toit, who played a major role in the merger of the two denominations in 1889, left for Lichtenburg once Rev. M.L. Fick began serving as curate and later pastor of the united congregation. The Rev. C.D. du Toit, however, joined the once more schismatic NHK almost immediately, depriving the NGK of all the hard-won gains of the previous years including Rev. Jooste‚Äôs church. On February 3, 1894, Rev. Fick‚Äôs NHK saw its current church cornerstone laid by State President of the South African Republic Paul Kruger. It was built by architect Richard Wocke. Along with Kruger, who married in Potchefstroom, Voortrekker leader Andries Pretorius baptized his children there. Among later pastors of the congregation were Drs. Beyers Naud√© and Nico Smith, both prominent opponents of apartheid. Mooi River secession The Potchefstroom- Mooi River Reformed Church (NGK) was founded on February 5, 1917, as a result of the turmoil of World War I and the Maritz Rebellion of 1914. The old church building had been deemed a ‚ÄúRebel‚Äù edifice. During World War II, Mooi River was nicknamed the ‚ÄúBarrish Church‚Äù while the mother church was labeled the ‚ÄúWorst Church‚Äù; the two churches were frequented by South African Party/United Party voters and National Party voters respectively. Building in ruins A fire almost razed the building to the ground on July 5, 2007. Restoration work took three years, but the 1894 building re-opened with a witness service on Sunday, November 7, 2010. Former minister Adriaan Vlok gave the keynote, though organ builder Jan Elsenaar was still restoring the organ, which was finished in August 2011. The organ had first been used in Birmingham, United Kingdom in 1897, but was removed and sold to a Dutch organ builder many years later, from whence Elsenaar obtained it and bought it for the congregation. By the first service in three years, the restoration bill had reached R7.4 million, paid for with insurance, bequests, and other donations.

He is a second-generation professional wrestler, part of the Reyes family that includes his father Universo 2000, uncles Cien Caras and M√°scara A√±o 2000, as well as cousins El Cuatrero, Sans√≥n, Forastero, and M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr.. His birth name is not a matter of public record, which is a strong tradition for masked wrestlers in Mexico, where their private lives are kept a secret from the wrestling fans. In CMLL he has won the 2019 edition of La Copa Junior. Personal life Universo 2000 Jr. is the son of Andr√©s Reyes Gonz√°lez, a professional wrestler known under the ring name Universo 2000. As Universo 2000 Jr. is an enmascarado or \\"masked wrestler\\" his birth name is not a matter of public record, a tradition in lucha libre where the personal lives of masked wrestlers are kept out of the spot light. His father, Andr√©s, and his uncles Carmelo (known as Cien Caras) and Jes√∫s (M√°scara A√±o 2000) were established professional wrestling headliners in Mexico. Several Reyes family members became professional wrestlers including cousins Forastero, El Cuatrero and Sans√≥n, and El Hijo de M√°scara A√±o 2000. Despite using the names El Hijo de Cien Caras (\\"The Son of Cien Caras\\") and Cien Caras, Jr. neither wrestler were actually related to the Reyes family but instead paid for the rights to use the ring characters and masks. The Mini-Estrella Peque√±o Universo 2000 is also not a Reyes family member but a Mini who was allowed to use the name and mask some years ago when Universo 2000 still wrestled in CMLL and continues to use the character to this date. Professional wrestling career The earliest recorded results for Universo 2000 Jr. is from late 2009 as he teamed up with his uncle M√°scara A√±o 2000 and El Hijo del Cien Caras on a show in Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, Mexico. While working sporadically early in his career, he would usually team with his family. On June 26, 2011 he teamed up with his father to defeat M√°scara Sagrada and El Hijo del M√°scara Sagrada on a show in his home town of Lagos de Moreno, Jalisco. In September 2012 he participated in a La Copa Junior battle royal as part of International Wrestling League's second anniversary show, won Kung Fu Jr. =International Wrestling Revolution Group (2014‚Äì2015)= In 2014, Universo 2000 Jr. and his cousin El Hijo de M√°scara A√±o 2000 began working for International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG) under the nameLos Primos Dinamitas, or \\"The Dynamite Cousins\\" inspired by the name Los Hermanos Dinamita (\\"The Dynamite Brothers\\") that his father and uncles used when working as a team. On November 2, 2014, Universo Jr. was one of ten wrestlers who risked his mask on the outcome of that year's El Castillo del Terror steel cage match. He escaped the cage early on, watching from the outside as Golden Magic defeated Kenshi Kabuki to unmask him. He later competed for the number one contendership for the IWRG Junior de Juniors Championship, but was eliminated by eventual winner El Hijo de Dos Caras. Los Primos Dinamita competed in the 2015 Guerra de Familias tournament, but were eliminated by El Hijo de Dos Casas and S√∫per Nova in the first round. On July 19, 2015 Los Primos Dinamitas competed in a tournament for the vacant IWRG Intercontinental Tag Team Championship. The two defeated Eterno and Hip Hop Man in the first round, Los Crazy Americans (Coloso Chris and Principe Orion) in the semi-finals but lost to El Hijo del Pantera and El Pantera in the finals. In one of his final appearances in IWRG, Universo 2000 Jr. teamed up with his father for IWRG's Legado Final tournament, a tournament for father/son tournament. The Universos were eliminated halfway through the tournament. =Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (2017‚Äìpresent)= After his stint in IWRG, Universo 2000 Jr. began working regularly for Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL), the same promotion his cousins worked for. In his debut math Universo 2000 Jr., Disturbio and Virus lost to Esfinge, Fuego, and Pegasso. While he was not positioned as a full-time member of Nuevo Generacion Dinamaitas he did team up with his cousins on occasion early in his CMLL stint. The 2018 Gran Alternativa (\\"Great Alternative\\") tournament was Universo 2000 Jr.'s first major exposure in CMLL as he teamed up with his uncle M√°scara A√±o 2000 for the tournament. The Reyes lost to eventual tournament winners Templario and √öltimo Guerrero on the first night of the tournament. He followed that up by participating in the 2019 Reyes del Aire (\\"King of the Air\\") tournament, where he was eliminated by Black Panther. He was also given a chance to qualify for a Rey del Inframundo (\\"King of the Underworld\\") championship match, but was eliminated early on in the ten-man torneo cibernetico elimination match.

It was written by David Silberklang and published in 2013 by Yad Vashem.  Author David Silberklang is an American-born Israeli historian, who is currently the Senior Historian of the International Institute for Holocaust Research at Yad Vashem and the lead editor of Yad Vashem Studies. His 2003 doctoral dissertation at the Hebrew University was titled The Holocaust in the Lublin District. Title The title comes from an October 1942 letter written by Rabbi Zvi Elimelech Talmud in the Majdan Tatarski Ghetto, which stated in part: > Only the gates of tears have not been locked before us, and we are able and > entitled to bemoan the destruction of our nation, to eulogize the rupture in > our destroyed people, and to lead the river of our tears with us to the > grave. This they cannot take from us. And He who sits on high in heaven hid > His face, and hidden will His soul weep, depressed and downtrodden. The title also references the Talmudic teaching: \\"Rabbi Elazar said, 'Since the day of the ruin of the Temple, the gates of prayer have been locked. Although the gates of prayer have been locked, the gates of tears have not been locked\\" (Berakhot 32b). Contents Although some 250-300,000 Jews lived in the Lublin District prior to the war, there was a lack of scholarship on the region. Unlike other historians who had written on the subject, such as Bogdan Musia≈Ç, , and Christopher Browning, Silberklang makes extensive use of Jewish sources in Yiddish and Hebrew. Nine chapters, thematically organized, discuss such issues as the Nisko Plan, German administration, forced labor, and deportations to the extermination camps. The book only touches on interactions between Jews and non-Jewish Poles, but with the implication that little help was to be expected from the latter. Silberklang demonstrates that the initial phase of ghettoization occurred in a haphazard way subject to local influences. Although knowledge of the purpose of Be≈Ç≈ºec extermination camp was widespread, Jews were not able to use this knowledge to save their lives. Even when Jewish partisans stormed the labor camp at Janisz√≥w and urged the 600 Jewish prisoners to escape, most of the Jews (both partisans and former prisoners) soon perished following roundups, in which local Poles participated. Silberklang argues (contrary to Raul Hilberg) that Ostindustrie was turning a profit off of Jewish slave labor, and that labor camps had the best chance to survive (especially after Operation Harvest Festival in November 1943) if they were profitable for local German administrators and did not attract the attention of higher authorities. Extermination was sudden and brutal‚Äîof 300,000 Jews alive in the area at the beginning of 1942, only 20,000 were alive a year later‚Äîwhile survival was random, unlikely, and determined by factors that were outside of the control of Jewish victims. Silberklang argues that, contrary to the centrality of Auschwitz-Birkenau in Holocaust studies, Be≈Ç≈ºec was \\"perhaps the place most representative of the totality and finality of the Nazi plans for Jews\\". He also criticizes the tendency to generalize from the well-studied example of the Warsaw Ghetto (also the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Ghetto) to the Holocaust in Poland as a whole. According to Silberklang, Reception Samuel Kassow describes Gates of Tears as a \\"superb book, based on massive archival research\\". A review by Andrea L√∂w in , stated that the book is the first comprehensive study of the Holocaust in the Lublin District. Laurence Weinbaum writes, \\"His incisive and analytical book is an outstanding contribution to the rapidly expanding literature on the destruction of local Jewish communities and regional centers.\\" The book was a finalist in both the Jewish Book Council awards and the Yad Vashem International Book Prize for Holocaust Research.

The trial was conducted at 24 sites in Australia, Europe, South America, and the United States. The benefits and side effects of inotersen were evaluated in one clinical trial that enrolled patients with hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis. Patients were randomly assigned to receive inotersen or placebo by subcutaneous injection given once a week for 65 weeks. During the first week of treatment, patients received three doses of treatment, followed by once weekly subcutaneous injections for 64 weeks. Neither the patients nor the health care providers knew which treatment was being given until after the trial was completed.

He made his in-ring debut in late 2017 under the name Tibur√≥n (\\"Shark\\") but was revealed to be the son of luchador Atlantis in late 2018 when he changed his name to Atlantis Jr. and began wearing the same mask as his father. His real name is not a matter of public record, as is often the case with masked wrestlers in Mexico where their private lives are kept a secret from the wrestling fans. Personal life Atlantis Jr. was born in 1998, son of professional wrestler Atlantis, and older brother of El Hijo de Atlantis. With neither Atlantis nor Atlantis Jr. having been unmasked, Mexican published sources have not revealed their name as per Lucha Libre tradition. His uncle was a professional wrestler in the 1990s. Atlantis Jr. started training for a professional wrestling career at the age of 12, with the only condition set was that he had to continue to study. He was trained first by his father and later by the trainers at the Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) wrestling school through the contacts of his father. At the school he was trained by Ringo Mendoza, Virus, Arkangel de la Muerte, √öltimo Guerrero, √öltimo Dragoncito, and Franco Columbo over the subsequent 8 years. in 2018 he revealed that he never finished a college degree, opting to become a full-time wrestler. Professional wrestling career =Independent circuit= Tibur√≥n (2017‚Äì2018) In interviews Atlantis Jr. stated that he made his professional wrestling debut in 2017, although he did not confirm if he used the ring name Tibur√≥n (Spanish for \\"Shark\\") early on or if he worked under a different, unrevealed, identity. The first documented match for Tibur√≥n took place on April 21, 2018 as he teamed up with Divino Boy, defeating Rokambole Jr. and Tackle as part of the Promociones Tragedias 25. Aniversario Mr. Niebla show. His highest profile match at the time was the Dragon Scramble match that was part of the Toryumon Mexico Dragonmania XIII show, won by Argos. =Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre= Atlantis Jr. (2018‚Äìpresent) His father Atlantis, wearing the same mask design as Atlantis Jr. In late 2018, Atlantis and Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) officially introduced Atlantis Jr., acknowledging him previous ring name and officially giving him a mask identical to the one worn by his father. He was introduced with the nickname El Principe del Atlantis (\\"The Prince of Atlantis\\"). During his debut interview he mentioned wanting to continue the rivalry his father had with Villano III as El Hijo de Villano III (\\"The Son of Villano III\\") had begun working for CMLL shortly before Atlantis Jr. was introduced. Atlantis Jr. made his official in-ring debut in Osaka, Japan, as part of the 2019 Fantastica Mania tour. The match saw Sans√≥n and Okumura defeat the father/son duo, followed by them being humiliated as Sans√≥n and Okumura stole their masks. Atlantis Jr. would get a small measure of revenge on the last day of the tour as he defeated Okumura in his first singles match. In his first match on Mexican soil he, his father and M√≠stico defeated B√°rbaro Cavernario, Templario and El Hijo del Villano III on January 29, 2019. He worked his first major CMLL show as he, his father and Trit√≥n defeated Los Hijos del Infierno (Ephesto, Luciferno, and Mephisto) on the undercard of the 63. Aniversario de Arena M√©xico show. While working for CMLL, Atlantis Jr. was also allowed to work on the independent circuit, which led to Atlantis Jr. and El Hijo de Octag√≥n defeating El Hijo de L.A. Park/El Hijo de Pirata Morgan and El Canek Jr./El Hijo de Dos Caras to win the UWE Tag Team Championship on June 29, 2019. The second-generation rivalry between the Atantis and the Villanofamily led to Atlantis Jr. and El Hijo del Villano IIIfacing off in their first one-on-one match on July 5, 2019, a match that ended in a double count out as both wrestlers were fighting outside the ring for too long. During the latter half of 2019 Atlantis Jr. began working more and more matches where he did not team up with his father. For the 2019 =International Gran Prix show, Atlantis Jr. teamed up with Audaz, and Flyer defeated El Hijo del Villano III, Rey Bucanero, and Tiger. This was followed by Atlantis Jr., Flyer, and Fugaz defeating Hechicero, El Hijo del Villano III, and Templario on the undercard of the 2019 D√≠a de Muertos show.

It is the largest and most important mosque in the old city and one of its oldest monuments.  Historical background  Like many grand mosques in other Moroccan cities (e.g. Ben Youssef Mosque in Marrakech or al-Qayrawiyyin in Fes), the mosque is located at the center of the old city and anchors its most important commercial and religious district, which contains the city's main souq streets (also referred to as the qaysariyya or kissaria) and its major historic madrasas, all located near the mosque. The mosque is believed to have been built in the 12th century under the Almoravid dynasty. It underwent significant restoration and expansion under the Almohad caliph Muhammad al-Nasir (ruled 1199-1213), who, among other things, diverted a new source of water to it from a source 9 kilometres south of the city. From the Almohad period the mosque also preserves a large and ornate copper chandelier similar in style to the great Almohad chandelier in the al-Qarawiyyin Mosque in Fes. The mosque underwent major restorations again in the 14th century, under the Marinids. Among other things, the minaret was repaired after having earlier collapsed and killed 7 worshipers. The Marinids were especially responsible for building the major madrasas of the city, which tended to orbit around the mosque. These included the nearby Bou Inania Madrasa (built in 1336) and two other madrasas, Madrasa al-Qadi and Madrasa Shuhud, all built by Sultan Abu el-Hassan. Abu el-Hassan also added a library to the mosque and arranged for a number of Islamic scholars to teach at the mosque. Lastly, further restorations and modifications took place under the Alaouite sultans. Moulay Ismail (ruled 1672-1727) remodeled the mihrab area and gifted the mosque with its current minbar, its anaza, and some of the fountains in its courtyard. Moulay Mohammed ben Abdallah (ruled 1757-1790), in turn, built the minaret that stands today.  Architecture  View of the courtyard and fountain from the northern entrance. alt= The form and layout of the mosque is typical of traditional Moroccan or North African mosques. It has an area of about 3500 square metres. It is made up of a vast interior prayer hall whose main area (south of the courtyard) is divided into nine aisles by rows of arches running parallel to the southern/southeastern wall (i.e. the qibla wall, the wall in the direction of prayer). The arches and columns are plain, while the floor is covered with mats. Down the middle of the prayer hall, running roughly north-to-south and perpendicular to the southern wall, is a central \\"nave\\" which is slightly more prominent than the rest of the space around it and which leads towards the mihrab (a niche symbolizing the direction of prayer). The mihrab itself is decorated with carved and painted stucco and dates from the remodeling under Moulay Ismail (ruled 1672-1727). The nearby minbar (mosque pulpit) dates from this time too. In the northern section of the mosque is a large courtyard (sahn) with a central fountain to assist in ablutions. The courtyard is paved with zellij tiles and is surrounded on three sides by the prayer hall and its arches, while on its northern side is one of the main entrances to the mosque. From the courtyard the prayer hall can be entered through any of the surrounding arches, but the middle arch on the southern side of the courtyard, opposite the mosque entrance and corresponding to the archway of the central nave leading towards the mihrab, is surrounded by rich carved and painted stucco decoration. Its opening is also covered by an ornate wooden screen with mihrab motifs, called the anaza, which acts as an outdoor or \\"summer\\" mihrab for prayers taking place in the courtyard. The anaza is richly carved and has a similar form to the anazas of the Marinid era, such as the one at the Qarawiyyin Mosque in Fes completed in 1290, but it is dated to 1715 and was thus fabricated under the reign of Moulay Ismail. The exterior of the mosque is largely obscured by the surrounding buildings and the dense urban fabric of the old city. The mosque has 11 gates, and one of the main entrances to the west, called Bab al-Kutub (Gate of the Books), is framed by rich stucco decoration and a canopy of sculpted and painted wood. From above, the mosque is distinguished by its rows of sloped green-tiled roofs, as well as by its large and prominent minaret. The current minaret dates from the reign of the Alaouite sultan Moulay Mohammed ben Abdallah (ruled 1757-1790). Like other Moroccan minarets it has a long square shaft which is crowned by stylized merlons and topped by a much smaller and shorter tower, which in turn is topped by an iron finial holding up four golden copper balls. The four facades of the minaret are covered in a surface of gleaming green faience tiles, which are a distinctive trait of minarets in Meknes. Near the base of the minaret, overlooking the courtyard of the mosque, is a dar al-muwaqqit or traditional chamber for the timekeeper of the mosque.

It is believed to have been painted in 1879‚Äì80, several years after C√©zanne's residence in Auvers-sur-Oise, a small village northwest of Paris. The painting depicts a landscape of Northern France; the exact location has not been determined. Victor Chocquet bought the painting from the artist, and it remained in his family's collection until the early 20th century. Later it came into the possession of Bruno Cassirer, who loaned it to the Kunsthaus Z√ºrich. It was inherited by Cassirer's daughter Sophie, and after her death in 1979 it was accepted in lieu of inheritance tax and allocated to the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford University. Shortly after midnight on New Year's Day 2000, guards at the Ashmolean, responding to a fire alarm, discovered the painting was missing. Police believe the thief or thieves used a smoke bomb and that night's millennium celebrations as a cover for the theft of the museum's only C√©zanne and the only painting taken. It has not been recovered. Description The oil on canvas painting depicts a rolling landscape below a blue sky filled with clouds, represented as smears of paint. Down a green slope from the viewer are a group of houses, white with roofs either blue or orange, again not depicted in detail. Scattered among them are trees, most green, but some with more yellowish color apparent. In the background another hillside with houses amid trees rises; a church spire rises at the crest.See image in article infobox The location of the landscape depicted in the painting is unknown. The painting is high by wide. C√©zanne's signature is in red paint at the lower left. History Camille Pissaro, whom C√©zanne came to see as both friend and mentor, moved to Pontoise, a small country town northwest of Paris, in 1872 after his previous country residence in Louveciennes, west of Paris, was stripped of all its contents while he was in Paris during the Franco-Prussian War two years earlier. The following year, C√©zanne moved to neighboring Auvers-sur-Oise, where he and Pissaro lived within walking distance of each other, and often painted side by side in plein air. They painted the same subjects, but in different and distinctive works. The two were trying to capture the \\"perception of sensation\\" in their work. C√©zanne's style, especially in his landscapes, reflected the influence of his fellow artist, even as the two preferred different techniques‚ÄîPissaro dabbing while C√©zanne daubed or smeared, according to a local resident who watched them both paint. C√©zanne began using brighter colors than he had previously, with less stark contrasts. A catalogue to a 2006 joint exhibition of their work from this period at the Mus√©e d'Orsay in Paris calls the two Impressionism's \\"painters of the earth\\", counterparts to its two \\"painters of water\\", Claude Monet and Alfred Sisley. But \\"with C√©zanne the spectator is openly invited to observe the way he portrays surfaces\\" the catalog observes. \\"Shapes are simplified and each brushstroke is amplified. His paintings are intense reflections of his method.\\" View of Auvers-sur-Oise was painted later, in 1879‚Äì80. By this time, C√©zanne was preparing to leave Paris and return to his native Aix-en-Provence, where he continued painting in this style, including similar landscapes, moving toward Post-Impressionism. Ashmolean Museum director Christopher Brown describes the painting as important to understanding the artist's career, showing him transitioning from his early work to the mature style he brought to well-known later works. =Provenance= French bureaucrat Victor Chocquet, a collector and advocate for Impressionism, bought the painting. After his death in 1891, it was bequeathed to his wife Marie. In 1899 the Chocquet collection was exhibited at Galerie Georges Petit in Paris, under the title Auvers. In turn it was purchased by another collector of Impressionist works, Thad√©e Natanson. Natanson auctioned his collection, including View of Auvers-sur-oise, at the H√¥tel Drouot in 1908. It passed that way to another prominent collector, German publisher Bruno Cassirer. He loaned it to his cousin Paul for a 1921 Berlin exhibit of C√©zanne works in private German collections; it was titled Ansicht an Aix. Bruno made the painting part of an extended loan to the Kunsthaus Z√ºrich, which exhibited it in 1933 as Regenlandschaft. On another loan to a Swiss museum, the Kunsthalle Basel. This time it was known as Bei Auvers. The Ashmolean Museum Bruno's daughter Sophie inherited it after his death in 1941, by which time the family had moved to Oxford following Nazi persecution. She kept it in the family's hands and did not loan it out. Upon the deaths of her husband Richard Rudolf Walzer in 1975, followed by her own four years later, the estate incurred a large inheritance tax bill. The painting was accepted by the British government in lieu of inheritance tax to become part of the collection at the Ashmolean, which lists it in its catalogue under the English title A View of buildings in a valley in the Ile- de-France. In 1998 the Ashmolean loaned it to the Art Gallery of New South Wales, in Sydney, for its Classic C√©zanne exhibit; in this it was given the French title Groupe de maisons, paysage d'√Æle de France, the title used in the artist's current catalogue raisonn√©. Theft At midnight on 31 December 1999, fireworks went off in Oxford as part of the global millennium celebrations that year. Police believe that at that time, someone used the distraction and noise to prevent anyone from noticing that they were climbing scaffolding around an extension to the museum's library that was under construction. Once they reached the roof, they broke a skylight over the museum's Hindley Smith Gallery and dropped a small smoke bomb in. The burglar carried with them a small holdall holding a scalpel, tape, gloves and portable fan. They dropped a rope ladder into the gallery and descended. Once there they used the fan to blow the smoke around so neither the museum's security guards, should they come into the gallery, nor its CCTV cameras would be able to get a good view of their faces. After cutting View of Auvers-sur-Oise from its frame, they smashed the empty frame on the floor, climbed the rope ladder, went back down the scaffolding and out into the crowds still celebrating the new year and millennium. Alarms had been set off during the burglary, but security at the museum assumed from the smoke that there had been a fire. When police and firefighters reached the museum at 1:43am, they went into the Smith Gallery and found the smoke had dissipated, with no signs of a fire. Instead what was left of the smoke bomb was on the floor, and a flashing light on the wall alerted them to the absence of the C√©zanne painting next to it. Director Brown, in London for the millennium celebrations, was alerted within the hour. He went immediately back to Oxford and saw the crime scene for himself. \\"It was like coming into your own house and finding evidence of a break-in,\\" he said. \\"Any director builds up an intense relationship with the works of art that he or she is responsible for, and this was very personal to me.\\" Police soon determined that View of Auvers-sur-Oise was the only work taken from a room that also displayed paintings by Renoir, Rodin and Toulouse-Lautrec. This led them to theorise that the burglary had specifically targeted the painting, the only work by C√©zanne in the Ashmolean. The thief or whoever they were working for had wanted it for a personal private collection. They may also have been motivated by the ¬£18.2 million sale at Sotheby's of a C√©zanne still life, Bouilloire et fruits, itself recently recovered following a theft in 1978, and hoped to make a similar profit. Katrina Burrows, editor of the London-based magazine Trace, which covers stolen art, doubted the thieves or anyone working for them would be able to sell the painting, if that was their goal, due to the considerable publicity surrounding the theft. The Ashmolean valued the painting at ¬£3 million. Like other artwork in British museums, it was not insured due to the high premiums required. Burrows also said that contrary to public perception of art theft as prevalent due to the recent box office success of The Thomas Crown Affair, it had actually become much rarer due to increased security and awareness of which works might have been stolen. \\"Anyone offered this painting will walk over to the shelf and look it up in a Cezanne book, and would see where it belongs\\", Brown said. There had been other thefts and attempted thefts of art from the museum and other Oxford facilities in the late 1990s. A pair of 17th-century French bottles were taken in 1996, and the following year three thieves were caught after they broke open a glass display case to take a jewel made for Alfred the Great. Brown said the museum had not relaxed its security for the holiday. The theft also drew comparisons to another recent film, Entrapment, in which the characters use the millennium celebrations as cover for an art theft. Investigators said the thief demonstrated a high level of skill. \\"It was a very clever ploy, a very professional theft\\", an unnamed police source told The Guardian. \\"Whoever has taken this painting has given some thought to how to steal it\\" agreed Oxford police superintendent John Carr. Novelist Iain Pears, who lived nearby, said that he could have been a witness. \\"If I had been there 10 minutes earlier, I could have helped them load it into the car\\", he joked to The New York Times. He called the theft \\"jolly brilliant\\". He believed it was likely that the painting would be recovered. \\"Twenty years ago the Ashmolean lost a Persian carpet in a theft. They eventually got it back from a dry cleaners in New York.\\" In January 2014, the Ashmolean made up for the painting's absence by becoming the first European museum to host an exhibit of Impressionist works from the Henry and Rose Pearlman Collection at the Princeton University Art Museum. Of the fifty paintings in C√©zanne and the Modern, twenty-four were by the title artist, spanning his whole career. Museum staff recalled the theft as a low point in the museum's recent history that made them more elated to host the Pearlman exhibit. =Investigation= The Thames Valley Police assigned six officers to investigate. They knew their own resources would not be enough. \\"This is not a crime which is going to be solved overnight.\\" said a spokesman. \\"We are more used to run-of-the-mill crimes. We need expertise.\\" Accordingly they had called in specialists in art theft; customs officers at airports and harbours had been alerted in case anyone tried to take the painting out of Britain, although police believed that it was more likely in the possession of some domestic collector. At first police withheld some details of the crime in case a ransom request came in. Later in January they believed they were on the verge of recovering it after receiving a tip that it had been seen in a West Midlands pub. When they went there to investigate, it turned out to be a copy, its paint still wet, being painted by the landlord. , no other leads have come in that police have discussed publicly; the investigation continues. In 2005 the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) named the theft one the world's top ten art crimes; its Art Crime Team actively seeks information from the public that may lead to the recover of View of Auvers-sur-Oise.

She was for many years a professor of mathematics at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign. Early life and education Hamstrom was born in Pittsburgh, one of three sisters. She frequently abbreviated her name as M-E, but never Mary. She was a student at Germantown High School (Philadelphia), where Anna Mullikin, a mathematician and doctoral student of Robert Lee Moore, had become a teacher. She did her undergraduate studies at the University of Pennsylvania, where Moore had taught many years previously, and completed her bachelor's degree there in mathematics in 1948, after having worked there as an assistant to John Robert Kline, who had been another of Moore's students at the University of Pennsylvania before becoming a faculty member there himself. Given this background, \\"she seemed predestined to pursue graduate work with Robert Lee Moore at the University of Texas\\", as on Kline's recommendation she did. A letter from Moore to Hamstrom, while she was still a senior at the University of Pennsylvania, describes the Moore method of teaching mathematics and expresses Moore's regret that she had already begun study in her intended specialty; Moore preferred to begin with a clean slate. This letter has been described as being \\"of considerable importance in the history of mathematics education\\". Hamstrom completed her Ph.D. at the University of Texas at Austin in 1952. Her dissertation, under Moore's supervision, was Concerning Webs in the Plane. F. Burton Jones, another Moore student on the Texas faculty, became another of her mentors. Career and later life On completing her doctorate, Hamstrom became a faculty member at Goucher College, then a women's college, and she earned tenure there in 1957 after a year at the Institute for Advanced Study. While visiting the Institute, she was encouraged to move to the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign by Paul T. Bateman, who was a professor there and was also visiting the Institute at the same time. Hamstrom had known Bateman from the University of Pennsylvania, where he was a graduate student when she was an undergraduate. Following Bateman's advice, she moved to the University of Illinois in 1961. Five years later, when the university promoted her to full professor, she became only one of four women with that rank in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. She retired in 1999. Hamstrom's \\"period of greatest creative activity\\" was from 1950 to 1980, during which she published 24 papers on point set topology, geometric topology, and the homeomorphisms of manifolds, and supervised eight doctoral students. (A ninth student completed a doctorate in 1999, the year of Hamstrom's retirement.)

In 1913 she became an elementary school teacher in Washington County, Utah, later moving to Garfield County, Utah. She wrote newspaper article. In 1918 Olive graduated B.A. from the University of Utah, and in 1922 she married Cyril Ray Burt, with whom she had a son and two daughters. In 1927 she moved back to Salt Lake City, and began work at The Salt Lake Tribune. She later worked as an editor on the Deseret News. There she took it badly that the News would not print her favorable review of Juanita Brooks's edition of the diaries of John D. Lee. Olive Burt died on 10 September 1981. Collecting murder ballads Burt became interested in true crime stories while on The Salt Lake Tribune. She did extensive research on murder ballads and their associated narratives, with fieldwork collecting of unpublished material and a letter to each state historical society. Her 1958 book American Murder Ballads and Their Stories received in 1959 a special Edgar Award. A review in Western Folklore by John Greenway, largely positive, noted the absence of detailed sourcing, and cautioned that newspaper reports of murders (which he said were a major source) were often inaccurate.John Greenway, Reviewed Work: American Murder Ballads and Their Stories by Olive Woolley Burt, Western Folklore Vol. 18, No. 3 (Jul., 1959), pp. 264‚Äì265.

He is a lecturer in social research methodology at the Evangelical theological institution and a senior fellow in China studies at the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation. Education Zenz received a Master's degree in Development Studies from the University of Auckland and a PhD from the University of Cambridge in Social Anthropology with a doctoral thesis on minority education, job opportunities, and the ethnic identity of young Tibetans in western China. Anthropology =Xinjiang= In 2019, Zenz studied the mass detention of Uyghurs in re-education camps in Xinjiang based on Chinese government documents and spreadsheets pointing toward factories with interned workers from the internment camps. In July 2019, Zenz published a study giving a speculative upper limit to the total number of people detained at any time since late 2016 in Xinjiang re-education camps at 1.5 million, based on extrapolations from food allowance subsidies figures. Newsweek Japan reported that the accounting figures of the camps that were used to base Zenz's initial estimate of 1 million, were sourced by Istiqlal, an Uyghur exile operated media organization based in Turkey who had said they obtained the numbers from a reliable local public security source. It was described by the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung as delivering solid evidence for the extent of the repression that had only been previously known through anecdotal evidence. In November 2019, Zenz estimated that the number of internment camps in Xinjiang had surpassed 1,000. Zenz has also published research, using publicly available Chinese government documents on the Chinese internet, that showed that the Chinese government has spent tens of millions of dollars since 2016 on a birth control surgery program that includes cash incentives for sterilization procedures and concluded that birth control violations are punishable by internment in the Xinjiang re-education camps. Zenz and his work on Xinjiang have been criticized by the Chinese government. =Tibet= Zenz is the author of 'Tibetanness' Under Threat?, a study of the modern Tibetan education system. In the book, he examines the career prospects of students who major in Tibetan-language studies and the notion that the greater market value of Chinese-language education threatens Tibetan ethnocultural survival. A 2019 Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung article described Zenz's research methods on Tibetans as being unconventional and arousing little interest in the professional world. The article stated that Zenz had analyzed job postings for security personnel in Tibet, compared them with data on self-immolation by Tibetans, and then used that data to draw his conclusions about the Chinese government's policies of repression. Zenz authored a report in September 2020 that said that 500,000 Tibetans, mostly subsistence farmers and herders, were trained in the first seven months of 2020 in military-style training centres experts say akin to labour camps. Theology Zenz is a born-again Christian. He stated that he feels \\"led by God\\" in his research on Chinese minority groups. With his father-in-law Marlon L. Sias, Zenz co-authored the 2012 book, \\"Worthy to Escape: Why All Believers Will Not Be Raptured Before the Tribulation\\", which re-examines biblical end-times. Zenz advises doctoral students at the European School of Culture and Theology at the .

Education and affiliation  He received his degree in law from Geneva University (Switzerland) (1996) and was admitted to the Bar of Geneva (Switzerland) (1999). He received his masters (LL.M) at Columbia University, New York (2003).  Career  Werner worked in Freetown and in the Hague for five years (2003‚Äì2008) for the Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) of the Special Court for Sierra Leone (SCSL) prosecuting the rebels of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) and former Liberian President Charles Taylor. He was also a lawyer for the civil parties (victims) at the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC) in Phnom Penh on the \\"Kaing Guek Eav\\" a.k.a \\"Duch\\" case (2009‚Äì2010). Since 1998 he also worked for Chadian victims of the former Chadian President Hiss√®ne Habr√© and was the one of civil parties lawyers representing them in Habr√©‚Äôs trial in Dakar (2015‚Äì2017) at the Extraordinary African Chambers. In 2012, he founded Civitas Maxima in Geneva, Switzerland.http://www.acatfrance.fr/public/c327-40ans-32-alain_werner.pdf Werner began studying law in Geneva under Professor Robert Roth (later Presiding Judge of the Special Tribunal for Lebanon) from 1993 to 1996 just as the discipline of international criminal law was emerging. He went on to complete his masters at Columbia University, after which he was accepted on a Swiss government program to work on international projects. The program took him to the Special Court for Sierra Leone (SCSL) in Freetown, Sierra Leone, where he became a Trial Attorney for the OTP of the SCSL in the team prosecuting three RUF commanders following the end of the conflict in 2002. He continued in the program for three years, being then hired directly by the SCSL-OTP as Trial Attorney. = Charles Taylor = In 2006, former Liberian president Charles Taylor was arrested while in exile in Nigeria and handed over to the SCSL, which had previously indicted him. Werner joined the SCSL prosecution team led by Brenda Hollis and Nicholas Koumjian, gathering witness statements and other evidence, and appearing in Court. Taylor was eventually convicted and, following an unsuccessful appeal, was imprisoned in the UK for a term of 50 years. = Hiss√®ne Habr√© = Between 2008 and 2017, alongside other projects, Werner worked for Reed Brody of Human Rights Watch on the case of the former President of Chad, Hiss√®ne Habr√©, and represented some of the victims for the two-year trial before the Extraordinary African Chambers in Dakar from 2015 to 2017. = Kaing Guek Eav\\" a.k.a \\"Duch\\" = In 2009, he was invited by Karim Khan QC to join a team working for the victims on the \\"Kaing Guek Eav\\" or \\"Duch\\" case, the first case heard at the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC). This experience cemented Werner's focus on the importance of documentation and preservation of evidence. = Aegis Trust = From there he moved to London to the Aegis Trust, an organization dedicated to preventing genocide and mass atrocities worldwide. At Aegis he worked with Hassan Bility, a prominent Liberian journalist who had been arrested and tortured under the Taylor regime. Their focus was on crimes that had been committed in Liberia and on working with partners in Sierra Leone to obtain evidence on the trade by Western players of 'blood diamonds' Civitas Maxima At that point, Werner decided to set out on his own network and, in September 2012, he founded Civitas Maxima, an organisation that focuses on the meticulous documentation of mass crimes, and pursue of justice on behalf of the victims. Since its establishment in 2012, Civitas Maxima, working with its partners ( Global Justice and Research Project in Liberia and Center for Accountability and the Rule of Law in Sierra Leone) has built cases and contributed to the arrest of several individuals suspected of involvement in war crimes and crimes against humanity, collaborating with several different war crimes units, agents and/or prosecutors in Europe and the United States. = Public Cases of Civitas Maxima =  Martina Johnson  Martina Johnson, a former commander of the National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NFPL, group headed by Charles Taylor), was arrested and indicted in 2014 for her implication in mutilations and mass killing committed in Liberia during the First Liberian Civil War.  Alieu Kosiah  In 2014, Alieu Kosiah was arrested for suspected involvement in war crimes committed by the United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy (ULIMO) while fighting the NPFL between 1993 and 1995. In November 2019, the Swiss Federal Criminal Court listed the criminal case against Alieu Kosiah for trial in Bellinzona for April 2020 (14 to 30). Michel Desaedeleer In 2015, Michel Desaedeleer, an American and Belgian citizen, was arrested indicted for enslavement, and pillage of blood diamonds in Sierra Leone. Desaedeleer's arrest was the first case ever on international crimes connected to suspected participation in the blood diamond trade. No trial ultimately took place as, shortly before it was due to start, Desaedeleer committed suicide in prison in Brussels.  Mohammed Jabbateh  In 2016, Mohammed Jabbateh (aka Jungle Jabbah) was arrested, indicted and charged by the US Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania with two counts of fraud in immigration documents in violation of the 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 1546 and two counts of perjury in violation of 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 1621. Jabbateh pleaded \\"not guilty\\" on all counts. Jabbateh denied his involvement during the First Liberian Civil War when he sought asylum in the late 1990s. Jabbateh was sentenced to 30 years in prison on April 19.  Agnes Reeves Taylor  In 2017, Agnes Reeves Taylor, ex-wife of Charles Taylor, was arrested by the Metropolitan Police and charged with torture on grounds of her suspected involvement with the NFPL during the First Liberian Civil War. On December 6, 2019, the Central Criminal Court in London decided that Agnes Taylor will not face trial in the UK. ‚ÄúThe supreme court refined the interpretation of the law and in light of their judgement, the trial judge granted Agnes Taylor‚Äôs application to dismiss the case against her. We will give careful consideration to that ruling,‚Äù a CPS spokesperson commented.  Kunti K  In 2018, Kunti K was arrested for his alleged involvement in crimes against humanity committed during the First Liberian Civil War (1989-1996) while acting as a commander for the United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy (ULIMO). He had been in pre-trial detention in Paris, but was released in September 2018 due to a procedural error. Kunti K. was subject to conditions of release, including being prohibited from leaving France. The French and Liberian authorities have continued carrying out investigations on the ground in Liberia. In January 2020, Kunti K. was rearrested by French authorities, after he violated the conditions placed on his release.  Jucontee Thomas Woewiyu  In 2018, the trial of Jucontee Thomas Woewiyu took place at the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania at the James A. Byrne United States Courthouse. Woewiyu‚Äî co-founder, and for several years defense minister of Charles Taylor‚Äôs National Patriotic Front of Liberia‚Äîbecame one of the few Liberian leaders to be arrested in the United States and charged with multiple counts of immigration fraud and perjury. After a trial in June 2018, featuring testimony from Liberian victims about the NPFL‚Äôs crimes, he was convicted and found guilty on eleven counts of immigration-related perjury and fraud related to lying about his violent past. The sentencing hearing was scheduled for October 15, 2018 but has been postponed multiple times. Woewiyu was not in custody awaiting sentencing. He died on April 12, 2020 of COVID-19 after a week of treatment at the Bryn Mawr Hospital in Philadelphia, U.S.  Gibril Massaquoi  In 2020, Gibril Massaquoi, a former Revolutionary United Front (RUF) combatant of Sierra Leone, was arrested in Finland for war crimes and crimes against humanity allegedly committed in Liberia during the Second Liberian Civil War. Awards In April 2019 Werner was awarded the prize B√¢tonnier Michel Halp√©rin for Excellence by the Geneva Bar Association.https://www.odage.ch/medias/documents/Les%20Essentielles/Prix_Michel_Halpe%CC%81rin_2019.pdf References Category:1972 births Category:Swiss lawyers Category:University of Geneva alumni Category:Columbia University alumni Category:Human rights lawyers Category:Living people ","title":"Alain Werner"},{"id":"62619634","text":"Nicola Grigg is a New Zealand politician and Member of Parliament in the House of Representatives representing the Selwyn electorate and is a member of the National Party.

He is a corresponding member of the French Academy of sciences. Biography =Training= He was born on November 20, 1935 in Paris, to Fernande Bernhart, decorator and Marcel Rochefort, photographer. After secondary studies in Paris (lyc√©e Carnot) where he became a laureate of the Concours G√©n√©ral des lyc√©es en Sciences Naturelles, he followed a university education with a doctorate in medicine in 1968, a licence √®s sciences in 1965, a doctorat √®s sciences 3e cycle endocrinologie- in 1966, then a doctorat √®s sciences in 1972. He was a medical intern in the Paris hospitals in the 1961 competition in clinical endocrinology departments and trained in research as an associate and then as a research fellow in √âtienne- √âmile Baulieu's Inserm Unit from 1964 to 1970. =Career= He was recruited at the Faculty of Medicine of Montpellier as Associate Professor, Hospital Biologist in 1970, then Professor of Biochemistry in 1981, then as Professor of Cell Biology from 1984 to 2004, and finally Professor Emeritus since 2005. At the hospital as a Hospital Biologist, (1970-2001) he developed assays for steroid hormones, hormone receptors and prognostic and predictive tissue markers for response to targeted therapies in breast cancer. He continues his research as founding director of Unit 148 of the Inserm Cellular and Molecular Endocrinology Unit and then Hormones and Cancers Unit (1970-2000) He is married and has 3 children. Main scientific contributions Henri Rochefort's scientific work has focused on the influence of sex steroid hormones and their antagonists in breast and ovarian cancer. 1\\\\. Pharmacology of sex steroid receptors. Some androgens are estrogenic when they interact with estrogen receptors (ER) (1-3). As early as 1972, Henri Rochefort showed that antiestrogens inhibit tumor growth via ERs, which then facilitated their routine use in the treatment of positive ER breast cancers. Discovery of a metabolite with a high affinity for RE, 4-hydroxytamoxifen, which is produced in vivo and accumulated in RE positive cancers. A mutation of the enzyme activating tamoxifen by hydroxylation is responsible for some innate tamoxifen resistance in patients treated for breast cancer. Antiestrogens also inhibit the effect of growth factors in the absence of estrogens. RU 486, a progesterone antagonist, inhibits the growth of breast cancer via the progesterone receptor, suggesting the value of anti-progestins for the treatment of antiestrogen-resistant breast cancers expressing this receptor. 2\\\\. By specifying the mechanism of estrogen mitogenic action in breast cancer lines, Henri Rochefort and his team discovered cathepsin D (cathe D) as an actor in tumor progression. (17-33) As early as 1980, H. Rochefort with F Vignon introduced the notion of autocrine regulation by mitogenic factors secreted and induced by estrogensF. Vignon et al., ¬´ Endocrinologie.

With monoclonal antibodies, developed with Sanofi, an assay of 52 K protein in breast cancer extracts in several retrospective double-blind studies showed in a totally unexpected way that high concentrations of this protein in the primary tumor predicted the subsequent development of clinical metastases (an example of serendipity) . The 52k protein was then identified as the precursor of cathepsin D (cathept D) a lysosomal protease diverted into the extracellular matrix . Henri Rochefort has clarified the mechanism of its transcriptional regulation by estrogens and its deregulation in breast cancers leading to its secretion . Pro cath D acts, depending on the pH of the extracellular tumor medium, as a protease or as the ligand of a membrane receptor to facilitate the survival and growth of micro-metastases that have escaped from the tumor before its removal. After confirmation in many Centres around the world, Cathedral D has become the first example of a protease, the measurement of which in the primary tumor has a prognostic value . Its overexpression after transfection of the D-cath gene into tumor cells increases their metastatic power in athymic mice. Conversely, the inhibition of its production by transfection of anti-sense RNA into breast cancer cells inhibits their growth and metastatic power in these mice. (29-32) Thus, cath D is a potential therapeutic target for breast cancers, mainly triple-negative cancersH Rochefort et al., ¬´ How to target estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer? ¬ª, Endocrine Related Cancer, 10, (2003), p. 261-266 as well as other solid tumors that overexpress it, such as colorectal cancer and melanoma . 3\\\\.

The coastal shipping trade carried on by these ships was known colloquially as the 'Stone Trade' or 'Blue Diamond Trade'. The trade ended finally in 2011.  The 'Stone Trade' or 'Blue Diamond Trade'  The predominant bedrock in the Sydney metropolitan area is sedimentary rock‚ÄîHawkesbury Sandstone with some isolated areas of shale. Crushed stone was needed as aggregate for concrete, road making, and as ballast for railways and tramways. Sandstone and shale are totally unsuited to such purposes, which typically use crushed igneous rock. There are some intrusions of igneous rocks in the Sydney area, particularly at Prospect Hill and Hornsby, but these isolated outcrops, although later quarried, were insufficient to meet demand. In the southern part of the Illawarra region, south from Sydney, there are extensive igneous rock formations‚Äîmainly basalt‚Äîstretching from north of Shellharbour to south of Kiama at Gerringong, and extending right to the coastline. Around Kiama, the formations‚Äîknown as the Gerringong Volcanics‚Äîare the result of lava flows from the extinct collapsed volcanic vent known as Saddleback Mountain. It is by far the largest formation of igneous rocks relatively close to Sydney and was well situated to allow transport by sea. The South Coast railway line did not reach Shellharbour (Dunmore) and Bombo until 1887 and it took until 1893 to reach Kiama; by that time, shipping of 'blue metal' by sea was already well established. After the railway reached the district, significant amounts of the quarried and crushed stone were sent by rail, and some quarries had their own sidings. Coastal shipping remained cost-competitive as a means of transport for many years and the coastal shipping trade in \\"blue metal\\" continued until 2011. Another colloquial name for this trade, the 'Blue Diamond Trade' probably stems from the term 'Black Diamond' used to describe coal, with a similar analogy being applied to 'blue metal', as the quarried and crushed basalt was known colloquially. = The ports of the Stone Trade =  Kiama  The harbour at Kiama (c. 1905‚Äì1917). Photographer Kerry, Charles H., from the Tyrrell Collection of the 213x213px Kiama was a port of the 'Stone Trade' from around 1881, when the Pike's Hill quarry opened on the outskirts of the town. The harbour at Kiama relies upon the natural shelter provided by Blowhole Point but is largely artificial. The Robertson Basin was excavated from solid rock between 1871 and 1876. The connection from Blowhole Point to the mainland‚Äîpreviously submerged at high-tide‚Äîwas raised by adding rock excavated from the basin in 1871. It was also in 1871 that the first commercial shipment of crushed basalt‚Äîwaste from the excavation of the basin‚Äîwas made to Sydney. From 1881, there were two staithes for loading crushed stone at the Robertson Basin. From 1887, the port had the Kiama Light as a aid to navigation. It was difficult for sailing ships to enter Kiama, with a following wind, and not collide with the basin walls or other vessels; this problem was partially solved by placing a heavy chain on the seafloor at the harbour entrance, which ships could use to decelerate by dragging an anchor over it. Ultimately, sail gave way completely to steam, ending the need for this unique method of shedding speed. A narrow gauge (2-foot / 610mm) railway line ran from the quarries to the port, via Terralong Street, from 1914 until 1942, when the quarries at Kiama closed. Hoppers and staithes for loading crushed stone were located on the eastern side of the Robertson Basin.  Bombo  Bombo was the site of an ocean jetty for the nearby headland quarry. Bombo was more exposed to the weather than Kiama and a less reliable port as a result. The jetty only operated from 1883 until 1889. The arrival of the railway in 1887 and the acquisition of the quarry by the NSW Government Railways in 1889 made the jetty redundant.  Shellharbour  RAHS Collection) Blue metal was loaded at times at the small coastal- shipping port at Shellharbour. It was a difficult port to navigate, used only by small craft‚Äîsuch as Paterson ‚Äîand masters who had local knowledge. There was a small jetty there by the end of the 1850s. A larger jetty was constructed in the late 1860s. Although receiving some protection from Bass Point to the south and Cowrie Island to north, the Shellharbour jetty was exposed to heavy seas from the east or north-east. An artificial harbour was constructed in the 1880s, with one breakwater running for 100 yards In a north-easterly direction and another to the south-east for 50 yards‚Äîfrom Cowrie Island‚Äîproviding an entrance only 100 feet wide, with a depth of six feet of water. The breakwater was extended westward around 1899, to block completely the gap between Cowrie Island and the mainland. The jetty ran from the south-east corner of the basin, for 50 yards to the north-east. There was only one berth on the north-west side of the jetty, with from five to seven feet of water at low tide. A 'swinging buoy' was used when berthing vessels that had to head north-east as they went alongside. There was also a smaller, high wharf on the northern side of the basin, near the site of the modern-day boat ramp.  Bass Point (near Shellharbour)  A wooden jetty constructed around 1880. It was damaged by storms in 1922 and repaired. The jetty closed during the Second World War and did not resume operation after the war. It survived until 1957, when it was damaged in bad weather; its remains were demolished in 1958. The existing jetty and its loader were completed in 1973. It could load a ship at a rate of 900 tonnes per hour. Bass Point was the last port of the 'Stone Fleet', closing in 2011.  Sydney Harbour (Pyrmont, Woolloomooloo and Blackwattle Bay)  In the early 20th Century, 'blue metal' was unloaded at Pyrmont, by gangs of men in a similar way to 'coal lumping'. This was dangerous work. During the 1930s, Blue Metal and Gravel Company Pty Ltd had discharge hoppers at Woolloomooloo and 'blue metal' was unloaded there. 'Blue metal' was unloaded at wharves at the head of Blackwattle Bay in Sydney Harbour. From 1972, this facility has been owned by Hanson. In its last decade, Blackwattle Bay was unloading 380,000 tonnes of crushed stone per annum. Part of the facility, the concrete batching plant, was still operating in 2019, but ships no longer unload there.  The ships  SS Bombo in 1939 In the earliest years of the coastal trade, the \\"Stone Fleet\\" ships were sailing vessels. These were quickly supplanted by small coal-fired steamers designed to carry bulk cargo. The steamers in the earlier years of the trade were relatively small, wooden ships, like the Dunmore, built in 1891. Some of the steamships such as the second Kiama‚Äîbuilt in 1920‚Äîwere capable of making a round trip, from Kiama to Sydney and return, in one day, 22 hours. There was also a similar type of small bulk cargo ship, usually dedicated to carrying coal, known as a 'sixty-miler'. Some 'sixty miler' ships carried construction aggregate from time to time. 'Stone Fleet' ships would occasionally carry coal, as part of the coastal coal-carrying trade. Given the density of their cargo, 'Stone Fleet' ships were smaller and had relatively smaller holds than the typical 'sixty-miler' designed to carry coal. The last ship of the 'Stone Fleet', the self-discharging bulk carrier MV Claudia, was much larger and faster than the earlier vessels. The ship had three separate holds and could handle three different materials in any one trip, with a total capacity of 3,800 tonnes.  Incidents and losses  Over the years of the 'Stone Trade', many ships of the Stone Fleet were wrecked, involved in collisions with other ships, or foundered. Many sailing vessels were lost in the earlier period of the 'Stone Trade' In 1881, the schooners Industry and Mary Peverley where both attempting to enter port at Kiama, with a strong north-east wind blowing. The Industry 'missed the chain', and ran into the stone wharf. Mary Peverley managed to drag a second anchor over the chain, narrowly avoiding collision with another schooner, Prima Donna. Prima Donna later foundered and capsized, in a squall off Bondi in 1882, with the loss of six of her seven crew. In 1894, the small wooden steamer Resolute, out of Kiama, sprang a leak off Five Islands and was saved by being beached In Wollongong Harbour. She was refloated and her cargo of 'blue metal' offloaded at Wollongong. Also in 1894, the Bowra, a wooden steamer that had been put on the Kiama run in 1893 assisting the Resolute, also sprang a leak near Seal Rocks, while carrying coal to the Clarence from Newcastle, and foundered, without loss of life. Not lucky for a second time, Resolute went aground on the notorious Bellambi Reef, in 1907, and broke up. No lives were lost, but the vessel was uninsured at the time. She had been in service since 1883. The wooden-hull Dunmore had a narrow escape after she collided with a much larger ship, the 'sixty-miler' Kelloe, two miles off the Botany Bay heads in May 1902. The Kelloe sank within 15 minutes. Dunmore picked up the Kelloe's crew and made it through the heads of Botany Bay, where she was only saved by being beached at Kurnell. Dunmore collided with a naval longboat off Mrs Macquarie's Point in Sydney Harbour in 1909, resulting in the drowning of 15 sailors from HMS Encounter. Outbound from Sydney, Dunmore was involved in another collision, in 1914, off the Heads of Sydney Harbour; this time she collided with another 'Stone Fleet' ship, the steel-hull Kiama, which was inbound and fully-laden with crushed stone. Although Dunmore was left with a gaping hole in her bow, she remained afloat. In 1915, the Dunmore ran aground on a reef near Bradley's Head, but sustained little damage. In 1918, the Dunmore was involved in yet another collision‚Äîthis time with the tug Champion‚Äîand sustained damage; a Court of Marine Inquiry found the Champion's master responsible. in 1924, the wooden steamer Kiltobranks had just loaded 'blue metal' at Shellharbour but, upon leaving the wharf, she went aground nearby during a north-easterly gale. Her back broken and with large seas breaking over her, she was a total loss. In 1939, the small wooden steamer Belbowrie, en-route for Shellharbour, ran onto a rock shelf and was wrecked, at the southern point of Maroubra Bay. Although the rescue of her ten crewmen was difficult, no lives were lost She had escaped serious damage, in 1923, when she ran aground at Doughboy Point five miles north of Cronulla. In 1949, Bombo, carrying 'blue metal', was attempting to make for the safety of Port Kembla, when her list became so great that she rolled over and sank off the coast between Wollongong and Port Kembla. Twelve of the fourteen crew lost their lives; the two survivors and the ship's dog making it to shore, but a considerable distance north of the location at which the ship sank. Paterson had a near miss, in 1949 during a storm off Wollongong, soon after she had replaced Bombo on the Kiama run. With her bunker coal wet due to waves breaking over the ship, it took her 46 hours to reach Sydney, after needing to take shelter in Botany Bay. In 1951, the 'Stone Fleet' ship, Kiama, was carrying coal from Newcastle to Sydney, during a gale that carried her onto the Tuggerah Reef‚Äîlocated offshore due east of Toowoon Bay. The crew took to lifeboats and rafts but were too close to the reef to be picked up safely by the CSR ship the Fiona that was nearby. The Kiama broke up and sank within a few minutes. Only five of the thirteen crewmen survived by making it to shore. Later in 1951, Paterson ‚Äîcarrying general cargo at the time‚Äî sprang a leak and foundered off Norah Head without loss of life. In 1954, while the second 'Stone Fleet' ship known as Dunmore (MV Dunmore, formerly Nassau) was in Kiama Harbour, her engineer was badly burned when a diesel engine back-fired. He leapt into the water to extinquish his burning clothing but later died of his injuries. Hexham Bank had survived her time carrying coal as a 'sixty-miler' but, in June 1978, while preparing to load crushed stone at Bass Point, she caught fire. All her crew were rescued. Her engine room was destroyed and she was deemed a \\"constructive loss\\" and scrapped. Her hulk later was later sunk off Sydney Heads.  Decline and end of the 'Stone Fleet'  = Impact of the Second World War = HMAS Bombo in Sydney, during WWII, after her conversion to a minesweeper. (Australian Navy, Naval Historical Collection, Australian War Memorial.) There was an interruption to the trade during the Second World War, when the Kiama, Dunmore and Bombo were requisitioned for wartime service. The quarries and narrow-gauge railway at Kiama closed permanently at this time. Around the same time, the Bass Point quarry and jetty also closed. Bombo was used as a minesweeper during the war. Loading at Bass Point did not resume after the war, and its disused jetty was destroyed in a storm in 1957. = End of operations at Kiama = After the war, the trade resumed but ground had been lost to road and rail transport. Kiama became, once again, a port for loading 'blue metal' but now it was brought from nearby quarries to the port by road transport. Both Bombo and Kiama survived the war, but were lost in incidents in 1949 and 1951 respectively. The fate of the original wooden- hulled SS Dunmore seems to be not recorded. A new steel-hulled MV Dunmore (ex- Nassau) entered service in 1951, with Kiama as its home port. 171,829 tons of gravel was shipped by sea from Kiama Harbour‚Äîvessels making 242 trips‚Äîduring the 1956‚Äì57 financial year. MV Dunmore took the last shipment of 'blue metal' from Kiama on 21 December 1961, then becoming redundant. She was sold (c. 1962‚Äì1963) and renamed Fijian Trader, under which name she ran aground and was wrecked in 1964. The hoppers at the Robinson Basin were demolished in 1965. = Reopening of Bass Point and final years = The Bass Point quarry reopened in 1973 using a new jetty and loader, beginning what would be the final phase of the Stone Trade. With the older Stone Fleet ships all gone by then, the trade at the new Bass Point jetty used ex-'sixty-miler' colliers, like Hexham Bank, which were available after the end of gas production from coal. The new operation at Bass Point and the use of a larger ship, MV Claudia, resulted in the last years of the trade achieving the highest shipments. Over 14 years, MV Claudia delivered over 2.8 million tonnes of aggregate to the Sydney. Three times a week, she made the return journey from Blackwattle Bay Concrete Plant to Bass Point, loading at the Bass Point Jetty, with 3,800 tonnes of crushed basalt carried by conveyors direct from the Bass Point Quarry. Each trip that MV Claudia made was the equivalent of 100 truck movements through the Sydney area. MV Claudia was retired in 2011, finally ending the \\"Blue Diamond\\" or \\"Stone\\" coastal-shipping trade. She was sent to be scrapped in China. All transport from Bass Point is now by road.  Legacy and remnants  None of the 'Stone Fleet' ships survive. Bombo and her crew are commemorated by two plaques near Kiama Harbour. Her wreck lies on the seabed near Port Kembla. The Robinson Basin at Kiama remains but is no longer a shipping port. Remnants of the narrow-gauge railway can be found in Terralong Street, Kiama, outside the Presbyterian Church and the locations of the loading bins at the basin can still be identified. A locomotive from the railway is under restoration at the Illawarra Light Railway Museum. The headland quarry at Bombo is now the Bombo Headland Quarry Geological Site but nothing remains of its ocean jetty. The harbour at Shellharbour is now used for recreational boating. The disused ocean jetty, at nearby Bass Point, remains as part of the Bass Point Reserve. A Hanson concrete batching plant remains at Blackwattle Bay in January 2020, at the site of the former unloading facility, but is no longer used by ships. The southern Illawarra has continued to be the main source of construction aggregate and ballast‚Äîfor Sydney and much of New South Wales‚Äîfor over 140 years.

Despite Jones's extensive career working with prominent engineers (such as John Rennie, William Jessop and Josiah Clowes) on many waterways, he gained a reputation of unreliability and inability, and was dismissed from a number of projects.  Career  Jones had experience in masonry and mining; he likely learned his trade in the coalfields of Shropshire or Gloucestershire. In 1773 he was living at Preston on the Hill, from where he undertook a number of contracts on the Bridgwater Canal. He later undertook contracts on the Preston Brook tunnel on the Trent and Mersey Canal and on the Chesterfield Canal. Jones's work on the Norwood Tunnel on the Chesterfield Canal earned him ¬£3 per yard. Sapperton Tunnel in Gloucestershire (north portal shown) Jones gained a reputation for failing upon debts, as well as becoming known for ineptitude and dishonesty. Despite this, in 1783 he was contracted by the Thames and Severn Canal Company to dig the Sapperton Tunnel at 7 guineas per yard, with a completion date of 1788. The tunnel was to be the longest in the country at . Jones's engagement at Sapperton was ensured through recommendation by the canal's engineer, Josiah Clowes, who described him as \\"well qualified by experience to take the conduct and management [of the works]\\". Jones's budget allowed for him to use an early type of railway in the construction, although his financial management led him to fail to pay his workers and he spent various periods in debtors' prison at Bisley, Minchinhampton, and Gloucester. After each release, Jones resumed work on the tunnel. One spell in jail almost caused Jones to break his contract, which stated that he was not to be absent from the tunnel works for more than 28 days at a time. He was released on the 27th day, to find that the canal company had enacted a lien on his personal belongings as a means of security. In retaliation, Jones's son George made a drunken death threat to Samuel Smith, the canal company's owner; this resulted in the son being prohibited from coming within of the canal for five years. In 1785, after a spell in gaol, Jones wrote to a Samuel Smith stating that of his own volition he would not set foot in the inns near the tunnel's ends at Hailey Wood or Sapperton. The same year, after Jones disappeared on a three-day drinking binge, the canal proprietors gave him a three-month ultimatum to finish the tunnel or resign. It is probable that Jones was dismissed during the summer of 1785, after digging just ‚Äîless than half of the total tunnel length. Jones had opened a portal at the Daneway end of the tunnel and sunk a number of access shafts. The portal suffered at least one collapse, as did the tunnel roof at Hailey Wood near its southern end. Jones did not open a southern (Coates) portal during his tenure. Jones was back in contact with the canal company in 1788. He took them to court, claiming that he fulfilled his contract. This claim was refuted by the proprietors, and in retaliation the company described him as \\"neither a skilfull Artist, Attentive to his Business or Honorable, but Vain, Shifty and Artfull in all his Dealings\\". They outlined that they had made payments on Jones's behalf totaling ¬£14,355, and that he was indebted to them by almost ¬£2,000. The case against the canal company was dismissed, with costs, in 1795. In late 1788, William Jessop gave Jones the contract to drive the Greywell Tunnel on the Basingstoke Canal. Despite referring to himself as the \\"Architect of Grewell \\", Jones's tunneling on the Basingstoke Canal was much like that on the Thames and Severn Canal‚Äîhe failed to progress satisfactorily and the proprietors' visit to the works in August 1789 led to him being dismissed. John Pinkerton described the reason for his dismissal as \\"improper conduct\\". It is likely this referred to Jones's intoxication and probable alcoholism. Pinkerton later requested that the canal proprietors reinstate Jones, although this plea was refused. Following his dismissal, Jones continued to reside at his engineer's house near the eastern end of the Greywell Tunnel works. He was resident there in September 1790, when John Rennie wrote to him regarding works on the Andover Canal. In August 1791, Jones was engaged on the Rother Navigation near Midhurst; it appears that a number of employees from the Basingstoke Canal‚Äîincluding Jessop and Pinkerton‚Äîwere also involved in the project. Jones's later projects include the Braunston Tunnel on the Grand Junction Canal, described by Alec Skempton as \\"less than successful\\". Skempton identified that Jones may also have been the same \\"Mr Jones\\" who was briefly employed by Rennie to work with James Spedding on the Bruce Tunnel on the Kennet and Avon Canal.  Family  Jones had three sons‚ÄîCharles Jr., George, and Samuel. All three became civil engineers, with Charles and George working with him on the Sapperton Tunnel. One of the sons worked as an agent on the Norwood Tunnel on the Chesterfield Canal, with poor results. In 1804‚Äì1805 George was employed by John Rennie on the Royal Military Canal; slow progress meant that Rennie lost the contract and he blamed the poor works on his contractors. In 1814, George again worked with Rennie, this time as resident engineer on the Stoneleigh Abbey bridge project. It is possible that Rennie's willingness to re-employ George on an engineering project shows how little he prioritised the project. In 1830, Charles Jr. had retired through ill health. By the mid-1830s it appears that the family of engineers firm had ceased to trade; one of the last Jones projects was that of the Devonport Waterworks.

The main savannah (fig. 1) lies between 400m and 800m above sea level and is probably the result of extensive deforestation during late 19th century. Actually it extends around 93 ha (Costa, Molina, K√ºnne and Gelliot 2019) and is overgrown by dispersed bushes and trees. The entire grass land forms a peculiar contrast to the nearby tropical forests (Nuhn 1978: 31) covering the remaining volcanic slopes. They consist of pre-montane dry forests as well as montane wet and rain forests, depending on their altitude. Fig. 1: Aereal photography of the Pedregal site on the slopes of the Oros√≠ volcano All decorated stones occur in open terrain and vary in size. While the largest boulders can be up to 5.20m long, up to 4.30m wide and up to 2.10m high (fig. 2), their majority does not measure more than 2.00m x 1.00m x 1.00m (length x width x height). All worked boulders consist of volcanic rocks. Considering its disperse location they seem to form a chaotic ensemble at the first impression. Due to the large size, the high number and the iconographic complexity of decorated stones, the Pedregal site is one of the most impressive archaeological monuments of Costa Rica and one of the most important rock art sites in Central America. Fig. 1: Engraved rock art boulder at the Pedregal site The boulders iconographies The most frequent decorations of the Pedregal site show geometric petroglyphs (spirals, concentric circles and crosses, squares, meanders, etc.) and/ or curvilinear iconographies. While the latter ones can form complex compositions, the sites figurative representations are less numerous. They depict bimorph faces and heads as well as anthropomorphic figures. Some of these motifs show specific clothing and jewellery attributes. Although some anthropomorphic images take on dynamic poses, they rarely interact with other decorations. Besides, the sites figurative inventory also includes zoomorphic representations. They can embody snake- (fig. 3), lizard-, bird- or tapir-like creatures. In contrast, phytomorphic motifs doesn‚Äôt appear clearly. The iconographic inventory of the volcano Oros√≠ seems to originate from a local convention of stone processing which is embedded into the traditions of the Greater Nicoya region. Additionally, the iconography of the Pedregal site also imitates Mesoamerican and South American patterns. They witness a broad variety of transcultural interrelationships maintained by the indigenous societies of Costa Rica before the arrival of European conquerors. A large number of the site‚Äôs petroglyphs can also be recognized on the pre- Columbian ceramics originating from northwest Costa Rica. Their classification indicates a considerable number of motifs dating back to the early Tempisque- Bagaces period (500 BD - 800 AD) whereas a minor iconographical corpus may be associated to the later Sapo√°-Ometepe (800-1530 AD) era (Stone and K√ºnne 2003: 205; K√ºnne and Baker 216: 273). Fig. 3: Zoomorph representation (serpent) at the Pedregal site Study and research projects In 1993 the North American archaeologist Ellen Hardy initiated a first systematic research project dealing with the Pedregal petroglyphs under the name ‚ÄúProyecto Arqueol√≥gico Volc√°n Oros√≠ (PAVO)‚Äù (Hardy and V√°zquez 1993). Cooperating with the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) and the Museo Nacional de Costa Rica (MNCR) the long-term study documented a total of 324 decorated boulders until 2008. Although the recorded data were incorporated into a first geographical information system during the following years. The first research results of the PAVO was exposed in the 59th Annual Meeting for the Society for American Archaeology (SAA) in abril 1994. Since 2018 the investigation of the Pedregal rock art has been continued by the ‚ÄúProyecto Arqueol√≥gico Guanacaste (PRAG)‚Äù. Resulting from the cooperation of scientific institutions located in France, Germany and Costa Rica the particular focus of the recently initiated project is on the sites position within the transcultural networks of the Greater Nicoya region (Costa et al. 2019). The creation of a modern geographical information system permits the inclusion of the formerly required data of Hardy and V√°zquez. By using a drone, more than 2000 distortion-free and georeferenced orthographies were recorded from the site‚Äôs main savannah. In addition, the project developed three-dimensional models of more than 30 decorated boulders. They are based on photogrammetric images and can be animated. A series of virtual tours is in progress. The PRAG is supported by the Institut Francais d'Am√©rique Centrale (IFAC), the Laboratoire d'Arch√©ologie des Am√©riques (ArchAm, UMR 8096), the Museos del Banco Central de Costa Rica (MBCCR), the √Årea de Conservaci√≥n Guanacaste (ACG), the Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit√§t Bonn (Department of Ancient American Studies) and the Deutsche Altamerika Stiftung (DAS). Further project partners are the Museo Nacional de Costa Rica, the Centro de Estudios Mexicanos y Centroamericanos (CEMCA) and the Institut National de Recherches Arch√©ologiques Pr√©ventives (INRAP). The whole project has a duration of 5 years (2018-2022) and includes further prospections, the application of new recording technologies, archaeological test excavations and archaeometric investigations. The projects implementation lies in the hands of Philippe Costa, Priscilla Molina Mu√±oz, Martin K√ºnne and Eric Gelliot.

He was one of the first disc jockeys in Germany and co-founder of the music program Beat-Club. Augustin helped generate a shift in Germany culture by introducing various genres of music at a time when schlager was the standard by giving exposure to krautrock bands such as Amon D√º√ºl II and Popol Vuh. He later became the head of A&R; for United Artists Records in Munich, and then the producer and manager for American R&B; duo Ike & Tina Turner.  Life and career  Handprints by Uschi Nerke and Gerd Augustin at Lloyd-Passage (Mall of Fame) in Bremen, Germany. Augustin was born in Hagen, Germany. When he was 15 years old, he heard Elvis Presley's song \\"Don't be Cruel\\" on the AFN Bremerhaven in 1956 which began his love for music. In the early 1960s, received a green card to live in New York City for two years. He adapted easily to the new country due to his knowledge of popular American music. When he arrived in New York City, he first lived in the Bronx, then Greenwich Village. There he met Richie Heavens and Bob Dylan in 1962. He shared an apartment with the musicians Charlie Chin of Cat Mother & the All Night Newsboys, Steve Turnage and Charles Kimbrough. He worked at Stechert-Hafner bookstore attended concerts of Nina Simone and Thelonious Monk, who created his music in front of the audience on stage by involving the audience in the composition process. Augustin often visited the Village Gate and Village Vanguard clubs, where he met Miriam Makeba, Harry Belafonte, Miles Davis, and Bill Cosby. In 1963, Augustin became first German disc jockey in Bremen. He created a discoth√®que named the Twen Club in the basement of a restaurant, The Gypsy Cellar. He became well-known in Bremen and northern Germany. In 1965, Augustin met Michael Leckebusch at his Twen Club. Leckebusch, a former trumpet player in a theatre band in Hamburg, came to work for Radio Bremen TV. Augustin became friends with Leckebusch and they created the television show Beat-Club, which is considered Germany's first rock music program. The series was inspired by Augustin's travels where he had seen the American music program Shindig! and the British music program Top of the Pops. The Beat-Club premiered in September 1965, broadcast from Bremen and produced by the regional TV network Radio Bremen. Augustin was a co-host of the first seven shows. The show became an immediate sensation. \\"People from the older generation (old Nazi's) hated it, young kids loved it and said things like 'keep it going' and so on. It caused a real reaction between the generations,\\" Augustin said. Eventually, his relationship with Leckebusch deteriorated because Leckebusch was taking credit for the success of the show, and Augustin got phased out of the show. In December 1972, the Beat-Club was replaced by another music program, Musikladen, which was on air until 1984. After Augustin left the Beat-Club in 1967, he moved to San Francisco in 1968. There he met and befriended promoter Bill Graham who introduced his to bands such as the Grateful Dead, Quicksilver, Sly & the Family Stone, and Ike & Tina Turner. While in San Francisco, he worked at KQED TV. He was awarded a scholarship to attend Stanford University where he received a diploma in Mass Communications. After graduation, he worked in Los Angeles with United Artists Records. In 1969, United Artists sent Augustin to work for the company in German. Siegfried Loch, head of Star-Club record label, started a German flagship label for United Artists/Liberty Records, to aim both at the domestic market and abroad. After two years as assistant managing director of United Artists' German office, Augustin joined the A&R; department in 1971. He signed the bands Amon D√º√ºl II, Popol Vuh, and Can to the label. Augustin produced various Ike & Tina Turner songs and albums, including Feel Good 1972), Blues Roots (1972), and Sweet Rhode Island Red (1974) which were made at the Turners' Bolic Sound studio. In 1975, he left his position as head of A&R; for United Artists Records in Munich to become their manager until their split in 1976. In 1976, Augustin formed the company Gammarock Musik in Los Angeles with Patrick Gammon. In 1979, United Artists overtook the administration of Gammarock Musik. He later hosted a public radio show in Bremen. In 2015, Augustin's handprints were added to the Mall of Fame in Bremen with Uschi Nerke who hosted Beat-Club and Musikladen.

He is the incumbent President of Korean Broadcasting System (KBS) and the Deputy President of Korean Broadcasters Association (KBA) since 2018.  Career  Born in Gongju, Yang was educated at Kimin Secondary School and Daejeon High School. He earned a bachelor's degree in political science and international relations, as well as a master's degree in international politics from Korea University. Yang was hired to KBS as a producer of the Issue and Culture Department in 1989, and directed TV programmes such as KBS Special, Good Insight, History Special, In Depth 60 Minutes and so on. In 2007, he served as the President of Korean Producers and Directors Association and KBS Producers and Directors Association, and as the Organisation and Production Director of KBS Busan in 2013. In 2008, Yang was one of the co- Presidents of the KBS Employees Action to Defend Public Broadcasting (shortly Employees Action), an organisation fighting against the media control of the President of the Republic, Lee Myung-bak. The organisation also aimed to protect the incumbent KBS President Chung Yeon-joo from dismissal. After Lee Byung-soon replaced Chung, Yang was sacked from KBS, but filed an appeal so that the punishment was eased to 4-month suspension. He was assigned to the Non-production Department for 2 years. On 5 February 2018, almost a year after Moon Jae-in and the Democratic Party of Korea came to power, Yang announced his bid for KBS presidency after considering for a month. According to an interview with Media Today, he explained that one of his juniors advised him to take the office. He also added that KBS, as a public broadcasting, should be independent from bureaucrats and capitals, citing examples of JTBC and MBC. On 26 February, Yang was formally chosen as the sole presidential candidate for KBS. The decision was subsequently endorsed by National Union of Mediaworkers KBS (shortly KBS New Trade Union). On 6 April, he was officially appointed by the President of the Republic Moon Jae-in, though he failed to pass the National Assembly hearing process, in which the Liberty Korea Party opposed his appointment. On 31 October, Yang was re-elected for his office, after passed an interview of KBS board of directors and citizens' advisories.

Yang at first denied it, but soon Park revealed a statement describing that Yang purchased at a karaoke via KBS credit card on the day of the tragedy. Another Liberty Korea MP, Min Kyung-wook, criticised, \\"Although he did not breach the law, he kept denying the facts. It means that he disdained the Parliament.\\" In the end, Yang finally apologised. = End of long-lived programmes = Yang was widely criticised for ending several long-lived programmes, such as KBS TV Novel (1987-2018), KBS News Line (1994-2018), Viewers Column The World We Live In (1998-2018), VJ's on the scene (2000-2018), Smart Consumer Report (2007-2018), and so on. Controversies were provoked when KBS decided to end Concert 7080 (2004-2018) but did not explain the actual reason. Sunday Journal, an US-based Korean newspaper called the action as the \\"media control of the Moon Jae-in administration worse than the Lee Myung-bak and Park Geun- hye\\". The newspaper also criticised that the new programmes i.e. Tonight Kim Je-dong and Your Red Cheek have low ratings than the old ones. = Tonight Kim Je-dong = Yang has also been criticised for Tonight Kim Je-dong, a new programme organised under his presidency. Sunday Journal cited that Kim Je- dong, the programme's emcee, receives high performance fees despite of its low ratings. On 4 December 2018, the programme broadcast an interview with Kim Soo-geun, a founder of the now-defunt Youth Party and the incumbent President of the Welcome to The Great, who praised Kim Jong-un during the interview session. The KBS Public Trade Union filed a lawsuit against Yang and the in charges under the breach of the National Security Act. Na Kyung-won, the Liberty Korea parliamentary leader, urged its all MPs to not appear on the programme.

In historiography he is known mostly for his role in the 1899 conflict between the archbishops of Toledo and Seville. Catapulted to nationwide notoriety, in the early 1900s he was a point of reference for heated debates on religion and politics; today he is considered a representative of intransigent religious fundamentalism. Roca served as lecturing canon by the cathedrals of Las Palmas (1876-1892) and Seville (1892-1917), animated some diocesan periodicals, and published numerous booklets. He was one of very few nationally recognizable personalities of the Spanish Church who openly and systematically supported the Carlist cause, though he remained sympathetic also towards the Integrist breed of Traditionalism. Family and youth Vich, 19th c. The ancient Catalan family of Roca became very branched throughout the centuries, with its representatives scattered across all of the region. It is not clear what particular line the ancestors of Roca y Ponsa followed; none of the sources consulted provides any information on his distant forefathers. It is established that his father, Cayetano Roca Subirachs (1828-1918), in some sources his segundo apellido is spelled as \\"Subirat\\", see e.g. La Gaceta de Tenerife 09.04.18, available here. However, the official death certificate of Jos√© Roca y Ponsa adheres to the \\"Subirachs\\" spelling, Partida de defunci√≥n de Jos√© Roca y Ponsa, [in:] Registro Civil de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria 97-1 (95): 49 was a native of Vich; he formed part of the local bourgeoisie and in the mid-19th century either owned or otherwise operated a corset factory, manufacture or workshop. Coses del Vic vell (13 setembre 1863), [in:] Diari de Vic 05.05.1933, available here At an unspecified time he married Engracia Ponsa; nothing is known either about her or about her family. The couple settled at Calle de la Riera. It is not clear how many children they had; among Jos√©‚Äôs siblings there was at least one brother Cayetano Cayetano died in 1912, La Prensa 17.06.12, available here and two sisters, Dolores and Margarita.Dolores married married Manuel Gonz√°lez Mart√≠n, descendant to a bourgeoisie Las Palmas family. She died shortly afterwards and the widower married her sister, Margarita.

A few sources claim that he ‚Äúcommenced ecclesiastic education‚Äù upon entering the local diocesan Vich seminary in 1861; B. de Artagan [Reinaldo Brea], Pol√≠ticos del Carlismo, Barcelona 1903, p. 278, Juan Mar√≠a Roma (ed.), Album hist√≥rico del Carlismo, Barcelona 1933, p. 223 it is not clear whether at the age of 9 he was indeed admitted to the seminary or was rather attending a school run by local Church structures. Roca y Ponsa spent teenage years in his native town as a seminarian preparing for religious service. His education in Seminario de Vich was terminated in unclear circumstances, related to the fall of the Isabelline monarchy and the Glorious Revolution. Later, vague accounts suggest that in the early 1870s he was engaged either in the Carlist conspiracy or Carlist propaganda,‚Äúsu adhesi√≥n al tradicionalismo catal√°n le crearon grandes dificultades con la Autoridad civil, vi√©ndose obligado a abandonar aquella di√≥cesis y a acogerse a la hospitalidad brindada por la de Canarias‚Äù, Alzola 1992, p. 38 and that ‚Äúin times of political agitation, persecutions, deportations‚Äù Roca y Ponsa was ‚Äúdeclared undesirable and expelled from the peninsula in order not to interfere in consolidation of revolutionary work‚Äù. Tradici√≥n 01.02.33, available here Either in late 1872 or in early 1873 Roca y Ponsa and 3 other Vich seminarians were transferred to the seminary in Las Palmas; it is there he completed bachillerato in teolog√≠a in 1873.

Roma 1933, p. 223, Barreto Romano 1998, p. 67, Brea 1903; p. 278 Back on the Canary Islands he assumed teaching at the Las Palmas seminary, first as catedr√°tico of Hermen√©utica y Oratoria Sagrada S√°nchez Rodr√≠guez 2017, p. 8 but over the years having classes also in Latin, philosophy, Hebrew and dogmatics. Brea 1903, p. 278 Still in 1876 he passed exams for prebenda de Can√≥nigo Lectoral by the Las Palmas cathedral. S√°nchez Rodr√≠guez 2017, p. 8 Ecclesiastic career Las Palmas cathedral In Las Palmas Roca y Ponsa kept serving as lecturing canon by the cathedral and as catedr√°tico by the local seminary. Another role he assumed was managing newly launched diocesan reviews. Roma 1933, p. 223, Jaime del Burgo, Bibliografia del siglo XIX. Guerras carlistas. Luchas pol√≠ticas, Pamplona 1978, p. 438 He was gradually gaining recognition; in 1877 the Canary bishop Jos√© Mar√≠a Urquinaona nominated him head of the diocesan pilgrimage to Rome. Roma 1933, p. 223 Roca was also assuming prestigious roles during local ceremonies. e.g. in 1878 Roca spoke during the Las Palmas ceremony marking the death of Pius IX, Jes√∫s Perez Plasencia, El pontificado de Pio IX visto por un cura ultramontano desde Canarias, [in:] Almogaren 22 (1998), p. 77 His position in the Las Palmas hierarchy was enhanced with the 1879 arrival of the new bishop, Jos√© Proceso Pozuelo; Proceso Pozuelo served in 1863-1865 as the canon in Vich; he knew Roca since his childhood and later turned into his promoter, Barreto Romano 1998, p. 67 in 1881 Pozuelo nominated him to sort out the politically sensitive question of the local cemetery. the Las Palmas bishop contested ‚Äúusurpaci√≥n del cementerio catolico‚Äù of 1868 by the then Junta Revolucionaria, Del Burgo 1978, p. 345 At the turn of the decades Roca launched a short-lived diocesan daily Del Burgo 1978, p. 345 and then a bi-weekly, Del Burgo 1978, p. 846 which he managed until 1888. Agust√≠n Millares Cantero, Anticlericales, masones y librepensadores en Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (1868-1931), [in:] Almogaren 22 (1998), p. 113 His militant articles aimed against the liberal regime cost him trial; in 1885 he was sentenced to living 3,5 years 25 km away from Las Palmas,the 1885 sentence was a follow-up of an 1883 article, published by Roca in La Revista de Las Palmas and titled El despotismo liberal; in very militant tone it protested official measures aimed against religious orders, Barreto Romano 1998, p. 69. Oddly enough, also in 1885 Roca was nominated by the official administration a Fiscal de la Subdelegaci√≥n Castrense de Canarias, Brea 1903, p. 270 but it is not sure whether the sentence was enforced. the Las Palmas bishop tended to side with Roca, Barreto Romano 1998, p. 69 In 1890 Roca ascended to rectorship of Seminario de Canarias. Roma 1933, p. 223, Brea 1903, p. 279 In the early 1890s Roca was already basking in local prestige as a great preacher.Roca used to give 3 sermons per day; the last one was usually the most improvised one and was considered the best, Tradici√≥n 01.02.33, available here However, for reasons which remain unclear it is not known whether Roca‚Äôs decision to leave Canarias was related to departure of bishop Urquinona, who in 1890 left the islands to assume the bishopry of Segovia he decided to leave the islands and applied for the position of canon at the Seville cathedral. In 1892 he was nominated canonigo penitenciario, Roma 1933, p. 223 and in 1893 he took over Canong√≠a Magistral. Roma 1933, pp. 223-224 His first years in Andalusia were uneventful, as in the mid-1890s he was noted merely for regular sermons.apart from the cathedral Roca preached also to various local institutions and organisations, e.g. in 1897 he was noted as speaking to Hermandad de Monserrate in Seville, ABC 26.03.94, available here Things changed in 1899 when Roca gained nationwide recognition following publication of his pamphlet directed against teachings of the primate, cardinal Sancha. in 1899 the archbishop of Toledo and the primate, cardenal Sancha, published an article which called the clergy and the Catholics to remain faithful and trust in the government of Sagasta. Roca responded with an anonymous booklet Observaciones que al capitulo XIII del op√∫sculo del cardenal Sancha ha inspirado a un ciudadano espa√±ol, which claimed that the primate went off limits and that Catholics were free to follow their own political preferences, for details see e.g. Crist√≥bal Robles Mu√±oz, Maura, un pol√≠tico liberal, Madrid 1995, , pp. 92-100 Because it was wrongly assumed that the criticism was authorised by the Seville archbishop Sp√≠nola since Roca‚Äôs Observaciones was published with the official ‚Äúlicencia ecclesi√°stica‚Äù, issued by the Seville archbishopry, Sancha assumed that Roca voiced on behalf of the Seville archbishop Marcelo Sp√≠nola, who was probably either unaware or vaguely aware of the content of the booklet. Later Sancha and Sp√≠nola got to know each other better, and in 1904, during coronation of V√≠rgen de los Reyes, a great Seville feast engineered by Sp√≠nola, it was Sancha who performed the act. This conciliatory gesture might be interpreted as some sort of apology on part of Sp√≠nola, ABC 04.12.2004, available here it caused a scandal and widespread debate.during the conflict, lasting for few months between 1899 and 1900, Roca‚Äôs ‚Äúname reverberated across all Spain‚Äù, ABC 04.05.43, available here As a well-known personality he was then active in Catholic congresses staged in the early 1900s. Though he gained recognition bordering notoriety, Roca did not progress in terms of his ecclesiastical career, especially since in 1911 his new booklets triggered a negative response from the Vatican.

Some later commentators appreciated Roca‚Äôs popularization of great apologists but they note also that because of ‚Äúthe fire of his blunt and passionate word‚Äù, in his case ‚Äúorator surpassed theoretician‚Äù. ABC 04.05.1943, available here Especially after 1910 Roca used to speak also at secular venues, usually marked by right-wing militancy; some were half-scientific sessions commemorating personalities like Jaime Balmes El Restaurador 13.09.10, p. 1 and Marcelino Menendez Pelayo La Correspondencia de Espa√±a 15.07.12, available here or Traditionalism-flavored, openly political conferences. ABC 05.09.10, available here For about 15 years Roca was the moving spirit behind a number of Catholic Canarias periodicals, either issued directly by the bishopric or by related institutions. Since the early 1870s he managed a El Golgota, some authors claim that Roca managed also El Triunfo and La Tregua, Roma 1933, p. 223, Del Burgo 1978, p. 438; however, other scholars claim these were independent Carlist dailies, Perez Plasencia 1998, p. 78 though its lifetime is uncertain; Roma 1933, p. 223, Del Burgo 1978, p. 438 it went beyond the format of a local parochial print, as thanks to Roca‚Äôs ingenuity El Golgota had correspondents in France, England and Italy. Perez Plasencia 1998, pp. 78-79 In 1879 he launched a diocesan daily, El Faro Cat√≥lico de Canarias. Del Burgo 1978, p. 345 It was probably rather short-lived, as in 1881 Roca focused on a new bi-weekly Del Burgo 1978, p. 846 La Revista de las Palmas. It turned out to be a more lasting enterprise, with youth supplement Los Jueves de la Revista added in 1885; as director, Roca Del Burgo 1978, p. 547 managed the publication until 1888. Millares Cantero 1998, p. 113 Having moved to Seville in 1899 Roca launched a diocesan daily El Correo de Andalucia and for a while was its key editor.Jesus Donaire, ¬°El Correo de Andaluc√≠a cumple 120 a√±os!, [in:] El Correo de Andaluc√≠a 02.02.19, available here In the 1900s he vigorously took part in conferences known as Asamblea Nacional de Buena Prensae.g. in 1906 in Seville or in 1908 in Zaragoza, Jos√© Ferm√≠n Garralda Arizcun, Jos√© Roca y Ponsa, [in:] Real Academia de Historia service, available here and until the early 1910s remained active in their Sevillan outpost, inspecting Catholic papers in terms of their orthodoxy. Roca was active in Centro General de Sevilla, a local Andalusian body of Asociaci√≥n Nacional de la Buena Prensa; he served as one of the ‚Äúconsultores‚Äù, Jos√©-Leonardo Ruiz S√°nchez, Periodismo cat√≥lico en Sevilla, [in:] Jos√©-Leonardo Ruiz S√°nchez (ed.), Catolicismo y comunicaci√≥n en la historia contempor√°nea, Sevilla 2005, , p. 147 Observaciones... (1899) Between 1873 and 1935 Roca published some 15 booklets, formatted either as collections of essays, often based on his earlier sermons, or as pamphlets. in 1890 Roca published El hijo pr√≥digo, a 3-act drama; it was actually played on stage in Las Palmas, Mar√≠a del Mar L√≥pez Cabrera, Sobre la critica teatral en la prensa Gran Canaria (1853-1900), [in:] Signa: revista de la Asociaci√≥n Espa√±ola de Semi√≥tica 14 (2005), p. 269 They usually dwelled on religion and politics; the author used to offer his ‚Äì routinely highly critical ‚Äì diagnosis of Spanish public life, and advanced his own suggestions for the future. Some were responses to specific issues, persons or episodes; El Licenciado Lorenzo Garc√≠a ante la F√© y la Raz√≥n (1876) was an onslaught on Darwinist theories as presented by a Canarian liberal theorist, Rafael Lorenzo y Garc√≠a; El Congreso de Burgos y el Liberalismo (1899) was highly critical commentary to the Catholic congress concluded in Burgos; Observaciones que el capitulo XIII del op√∫sculo del cardenal Sancha ha inspirado a un ciudadano espa√±ol (1899) was repudiation of political recommendations of the primate; En propia defensa. Carta abierta al Excmo. Sr. Cardenal Sancha (1899) was a continuation of Observaciones; Las normas dadas en Roma a los integristas (1910) was summary of the Integrist pilgrimage to Rome; El Rey soberano y la Naci√≥n en Cortes. Ideas de Balmes recogidas por el Magistral de Sevilla (1911) was a historiographic essay on Jaime Balmes; De Liberalismo. Sobre las conferencias del P. Coloma (1912) was critical account of social theories advanced by Luis Coloma some contained more general lectures. Bosquejo de la civilizaci√≥n moderna (1873), A los buenos espa√±oles: la regeneraci√≥n liberal (1899), Como debe combatirse al liberalismo en Espa√±a?

Su origen, naturaleza, vida terrenal y su destino (1935), Cristo-Maestro (1936) Roca used to sign with various, easily attributable pen-names, like \\"Ciudadano Espa√±ol\\" or \\"Cat√≥lico Espa√±ol\\" though he was best known as \\"Magistral de Sevilla\\"; as ‚ÄúMagistral de Sevilla‚Äù Roca signed Carta abierta al Excmo. Sr. Cardenal Sancha, Las normas dadas en Roma a los integristas, Como debe combatirse al liberalismo en Espa√±a? or ¬øCu√°l es el mal mayor y cu√°l es el mal menor? his late writings were published under his own name. this is how Roca signed Vivamos alegres or El hombre. Su origen, naturaleza, vida terrenal y su destino The booklet which made particular impact and caused nationwide controversy was Observaciones que el capitulo XIII del op√∫sculo del cardenal Sancha ha inspirado a un ciudadano espa√±ol (1899). full title Observaciones que al capitulo XIII del op√∫sculo del cardenal Sancha ha inspirado a un ciudadano espa√±ol, Sevilla 1899 ¬øSe puede, en conciencia, pertenecer al partido liberal-conservador? (1912) and ¬øCu√°l es el mal mayor y cu√°l es el mal menor? (1912) also gained sort of notoriety, namely when the Vatican voiced its skepticism as to the political intransigence advanced; moderate Catholics were quick to stigmatize them as ‚Äúdoctrinas condenadas por Su Santidad‚Äù. Robles, Robles Mu√±oz 1997, p. 288 Outlook ¬øSe puede ... (1912) Roca y Ponsa gained his name mostly thanks to views on religion and politics. They were underpinned by confidence that a community without an officially accepted and enforced orthodoxy, a community where various concepts of public life constantly compete for domination, can not form an orderly, peaceful, operational society. In his view the only appropriate orthodoxy was Catholicism, which for centuries shaped the Spanish self and contributed to greatness of the nation; Catholic principles should serve as guidelines organizing both state and society. Their antithesis was liberalism, not only useless as a political doctrine, but also unacceptable as a moral concept; it remained responsible for decline of Spain and would lead to further calamities in the future. Compare excerpts from Observaciones: ‚ÄúLos males que pesan sobre la Iglesia espa√±ola proceden de nuestras Constituciones liberales. No ha habido, no hay verdadera lucha con el protestantismo: ni √©ste ha hecho descre√≠do al pueblo, ni ha pagado a profesores pante√≠stas o racionalistas que corrompieran a la juventud, ni ha empobrecido al clero, ni ha encanallado nuestros espect√°culos. Todo esto es obra del liberalismo, que s√≥lo se ha presentado en Espa√±a triunfador y dominador por medio del Constitucionalismo\\". Also: \\"Podr√© confiadamente afirmar que el Trono actual es el mismo de Alfonso XII y de Isabel II, y representa lo mismo que represent√≥ el a√±o 1833 y siguientes, Do√±a Mar√≠a Cristina, augusta abuela de D. Alfonso XII... ¬øY qui√©n duda que el Poder moderador en Espa√±a, desde 1833, se ha identificado con el liberalismo; pues el liberalismo lo estableci√≥, defendi√≥ tenazmente y rode√≥ con amor; a condici√≥n de que el Trono fuera fiel a la causa liberal y a sus partidarios, nunca les hiciera traici√≥n ni les abandonara, aunque tuviera que pasar por el b√°rbaro deg√ºello de los Religiosos, el inmenso robo sacrilego (que dir√≠a Men√©ndez Pelayo) de los bienes de la iglesia y el rompimiento consiguiente con el Vicario de Cristo? Estos son los hechos consignados en la historia, de que no es posible dudar‚Äù, referred after Del Burgo 1978, p. 865 Roca‚Äôs view was fairly typical for some sections of the Spanish society, yet it was expressed in a most absolute and intransigent form; politics was viewed as battleground between God and Satan. Roca understood Spanish public life as constant confrontation between Liberalism and Christianity, the two being clearly incompatible. He classified all political groupings into just two categories: liberal and anti-liberal ones; ABC 30.12.12, available here basically, only the Carlists and the Integrists were considered part of the latter;during a Carlist conference of 1910 in Valencia Roca named Traditionalism ‚Äúfuerza antirrevolucionaria y patri√≥tica, √∫nica que se preocupa en reestablecer el impe-rio de Cristo\\"; he went on to note that ‚Äúvosotros, los carlistas, sois la fuerza antirrevolucionar√≠a de Europa. Los cat√≥licos de Italia y de Francia no cumplen con su deber‚Äù, ABC 05.09.10, available here all other parties formed the ungodly, sinister liberal camp. Roca reserved particular criticism for the Conservatives,¬øSe puede, en conciencia, pertenecer al partido liberal-conservador? caused outrage as Roca claimed that being a Catholic was not compatible to being a member of the Conservative Party, Crist√≥bal Robles Mu√±oz, Jesuitas e Iglesia Vasca. Los cat√≥licos y el partido conservador (1911-1913), [in:] Pr√≠ncipe de Viana 192 (1991), p. 200. Particular criticism was reserved for these deemed traitors, who left the righteous Traditionalist camp, especially Uni√≥n Cat√≥lica of Alejandro Pidal, Barreto Romano 1998, p. 59 who accepted the Restoration political framework; El Restaurador 23.09.08, available here though theoretically catering to Christian sections of the society, in fact with their hypocrisy they undermined Christian values. the Conservative embracement of malmenorismo was since 1812 \\"mal grav√≠simo, causa de todas las injusticias de que es v√≠ctima la Iglesia en Espa√±a, y de la indiferencia religiosa del pueblo, y de la p√©rdida de la fe en tantas almas\\". Its hypocrysy ‚Äúenga√±a a los cat√≥licos, los divide y los debilita, al paso que hace posible y f√°cil el triunfo de la revoluci√≥n m√°s anticlerical, en las esferas del gobierno, sin sacudidas ni graves excesos contra el orden material, consiguiendo que, sin oposici√≥n suya, se conviertan esos excesos en leyes, sin alarma de los cat√≥licos, sin indignaci√≥n, sin adecuada resistencia‚Äù, Del Burgo 1978, p. 865 They were guilty of accepting an erroneous understanding of lesser evil, which in fact paved the way for revolution; Barreto Romano 1998, p. 59 similarly, he blamed for ‚Äúmalmenorismo‚Äù also some sections of the religious hierarchy. It was his pamphlet against the primate, who called for Catholics to ‚Äúremain faithful and trust in the [liberal] government‚Äù, that caused heated nationwide debate, especially since Roca quoted papal authority. Roca pointed out that the Pope did not tell the Spaniards to follow any dynasty or any constitution, Vic V. C√°rcel, Le√≥n XIII frente a los integristas espa√±oles. El incidente Sancha-Spinola, [in:] Miscellanea Historiae Pontificiae 50 (1983), pp. 477-504 I will reign in Spain In the early 1900s Roca tried to format the emerging popular Catholic political movement, which at the time was taking shape at numerous Catholic congresses, as a vehicle of militant intransigent policy. Jos√© Ferm√≠n Garralda Arizcun, Proyeccion sociopol√≠tica de los congresos cat√≥licos en Espa√±a (1), [in:] Verbo 333-334 (1995), pp. 369, 373 He tried to orient them towards rejection of malmenorismo, which in practical terms would have stood for adopting an anti-regime posture; having failed, he then denounced the congresses as doomedRoca clashed Alfredo Bra√±as as to the role of the Catholic congresses and their position versus liberalism, Jos√© Ferm√≠n Garralda Arizcun, Jos√© Roca y Ponsa, [in:] Real Academia de Historia service, available here and based on false principles. Garralda Arizcun 1995, p. 374, Ruiz S√°nchez 2005, p. 137 Though at the time classical Spanish liberalism was in decline, giving way to new socialist and republican movements, Roca did not re-focus his approach; for him, new radical revolutionary ideas were merely extreme embodiments of liberalism. While absolutism ‚Äì also considered a brainchild of the liberal fallacy - was usurpation of an individual, republicanism, nationalism or socialism were also usurpations against godly order, but attempted in the name of specific groups. according to Roca, absolutism and revolution are two forms of ‚Äúespirit√∫ de orgullo y rebeld√≠a‚Äù, which grew out of ‚Äúregalismo cism√°tico de Jos√© II de Austria y del Galicanismo‚Äù, Perez Plasencia 1998, pp. 82-83 He kept opposing also social-Catholic and Christian- democratic movements, tailored to operate in a liberalism-ridden democratic regime and guilty of abandoning unity between religious and political objectives. compare e.g. his criticism of Gonzalo Coloma, Robles, Robles Mu√±oz 1997, p. 288 Carlist Carlist standard Roca was one of very few recognizable figures of the Catholic Church who openly and systematically supported the Carlist cause. He inherited Carlist enthusiasm from his father. Roca Subirachs remained a Carlist until death; already an octogenarian, in the 1910s he formed part of the Carlist Comit√© Provincial of Las Palmas, El Correo Espa√±ol 23.11.10, available here, and in 1911 served as honorary member of Juventud Tradicionalista of Las Palmas, El Correo Espa√±ol 07.04.11, available here As Vich was ‚Äúa city known as a centre of clerical Carlism and Integrism‚Äù‚Äúuna ciudad que habia destacado como centro activo del carlismo clerical y integrismo‚Äù, Barreto Romano 1998, p. 67 Roca got his zeal reinforced during the seminary years; involved in Carlist conspiracy in the early 1870s, he was then forced to move to the Canary Islands.‚Äúsu adhesi√≥n al tradicionalismo catal√°n le crearon grandes dificultades con la Autoridad civil, vi√©ndose obligado a abandonar aquella di√≥cesis y a acogerse a la hospitalidad brindada por la de Canarias‚Äù, Alzola 1992, p. 38 Under his management El Golgota, theoretically a Catholic diocesan periodical, became almost undistinguishable from local Las Palmas Traditionalist reviews of the late 1870s; Perez Plasencia 1998, p. 78 also Roca‚Äôs sermons and writings were increasingly saturated with the Traditionalist vision of religion and politics. The same line was maintained in La Revista of the 1880s; the bi- weekly assaulted Carlist breakaways led by Pidal Barreto Romano 1998, p. 59 and supported the intransigent anti-regime line advocated by Nocedal. Jos√© Miguel Barreto Romano, Manifestaciones de la divisi√≥n de los cat√≥licos durante el obispado de Jos√© Pozuelo y Herrero (1879-1890), [in:] Almogaren 22 (1998), p. 54 However, when in 1888 the latter broke away from orthodox Carlism himself to set up the branch known as Integrism, Roca did not take sides and remained equidistant.it appears that Roca‚Äôs traditionalism was deprived of the dynastic ingredient and was closer to the Integrist rather than to the Carlist blueprint. At one point he noted that ‚Äúel tradicionalismo se avendr√≠a con la rep√∫blica si √©sta confesase √° Dios, y atacar√≠a la Monarqu√≠a si sus Gobiernos le persiguiesen‚Äù, ABC 05.09.10, available here Some sources refer to him as ‚Äúardent Integrist‚Äù, William James Callahan, The Catholic Church in Spain, 1875-1998, Lansing 2009, , p. 72 some name him ‚Äúblockhead Carlist‚Äù, El Pa√≠s 08.09.99, available here. Some scholars count Roca among very few Carlists ‚Äúfor ever‚Äù active in the 1930s, Manuel Martorell P√©rez, Nuevas aportaciones hist√≥ricas sobre la evoluci√≥n ideol√≥gica del carlismo, [in:] Ger√≥nimo de Uztariz 16 (2000), p. 104 and some note that his departure to Andalusia weakened the position of both Canarian Carlists and Integrists. Barreto Romano 1998, p. 55 During his Canarian and Andalusian spells Roca did not engage in Traditionalist political structures, though following the move back to the peninsula his relations with the movement strengthened; under pen-names he contributed to the unofficial Carlist mouthpiece El Correo Espa√±ol Roma 1933, p. 224 and other regional party dailies, e.g. with Diario de Valencia, see Diario de Valencia 18.03.11, available here. In 1899 Roca promised his contribution to Jos√© Domingo Corbat√≥, a somewhat unorthodox Carlist at odds with the religious hierarchy, Jos√© Andres Gallego, La pol√≠tica religiosa en Espa√±a 1889-1913, Madrid 1975, , p. 167. In 1909-1910 Roca managed also a Traditionalist Sevilla daily La Unidad Catolica, Concha Langa Nu√±o, De c√≥mo se improvis√≥ el franquismo durante la Guerra Civil: la aportaci√≥n del ABC de Sevilla, Sevilla 2007, , p. 49 helped to launch El Radical, a Seville periodical issued by the local Juventud Jaimista, Jos√© Ferm√≠n Garralda Arizcun, Jos√© Roca y Ponsa, [in:] Real Academia de Historia service, available here. In the 1910s Roca served also as director espiritual of Juventud Jaimista of Seville, Brea 1903, p. 279 toured the country invited by Jaimista youth, e.g. he visited Gij√≥n, invited by the local Jaimista youth organisation, El Correo Espa√±ol 06.03.12, available here or attended party banquets hailing the Carlist leader Bartolom√© Feli√∫; El Correo Espa√±ol 14.09.10, available here in return, Roca was cheered as great theorist and author by various Carlist bodies. in 1908 Roca was awarded ‚Äúpluma de oro‚Äù by the Carlist youth organisation from Madrid, El Correo Espa√±ol 24.12.08, available here However, he cultivated also the Integrist link; on some public conferences he appeared jointly with pundits like Manuel Senante, El Restaurador 24.09.08, available here remained on friendly terms with Juan Olaz√°bal and perhaps contributed also to the chief Integrist daily, El Siglo Futuro. Robles Mu√±oz 1991, p. 204 Roca at Junta de Biarritz, 1919 As a key attendant Roca took part in a grand Carlist meeting known as Magna Junta de Biarritz of 1919 and delivered one of his key lectures; Melchor Ferrer, Breve historia del legitimismo espa√±ol, Madrid 1958, p. 102 his embrace with the claimant Don Jaime was among iconic scenes from the rally. Diario de Valencia 04.12.19, available here In 1920 Roca helped to re-formatwith permission and assistance of the archbishop of Seville, La Gaceta de Tenerife 07.04.25, available here a Catholic daily El Correo de Andalucia and employed Domingo Tejera as its manager, paving his future path as a Traditionalist editor.

XXX/2, Sevilla 1979, p. 44 as such, in 1935 he published at least one piece in the Carlist intellectual review Tradici√≥n.Deberes pol√≠ticos de los cat√≥licos, [in:] Tradici√≥n 1935; see also Antonio M. Moral Roncal, La cuesti√≥n religiosa en la Segunda Rep√∫blica Espa√±ola: Iglesia y carlismo, Madrid 2009, , p. 230. Roca kept contributing to other Carlist papers, also these at the vergy of the party orthodoxy like El Cruzado Espa√±ol, compare El Cruzado Espa√±ol 11.04.30, available here. In a homage article in Tradici√≥n by Domingo Tejera, the editor whom Roca invited in 1920 to lead a diocesan Seville periodical, honored him by calling that the Carlists ‚Äúformemos la guardia sobre la borda, y saludemos al viejo soldado de Cristo, nuestro capit√°n‚Äù, Tradicion 01.02.35, available here Reception and legacy Roca y Ponsa, 1910s Until the late 1890s Roca y Ponsa was known locally and appreciated in Catholic circles of Las Palmas and Sevilla for his unyielding, well-delivered sermons. Tradici√≥n 01.02.35, available here It was the 1899 Sancha‚ÄìSp√≠nola controversy which catapulted him to nationwide notoriety; Traditionalist dailies saluted him as righteous Christian, see e.g. El Siglo Futuro 18.10.30, available here while progressist papers ridiculed him as reactionary relic.‚Äúpobre zopenco de Roca y Ponsa, magistral de Sevilla y carlista de clase de testaferros‚Äù, El Pa√≠s 08.09.1899, available here The issue was formally brought before the Vatican; the pronouncement of the Extraordinary Congregation for Ecclesiastic Affairs, which somewhat ambiguously sided with Sancha,‚ÄúEl nuncio y la Santa Sede manifestaron su apoyo al cardenal Sancha, condenaron las cr√≠ticas que hab√≠a recibido su pastoral y reprobaron la conducta de Sp√≠nola. Sin embargo todo ello se hizo en secreto y, para no alimentar la pol√©mica, se prohibi√≥ la publicaci√≥n del folleto de Roca y Ponsa pero no se conden√≥ su contenido.

Robles Mu√±oz 1995, p. 97 However, in the following decades the Church opted for a moderate political strategy; Roca‚Äôs defeat was sealed by another official Vatican pronouncement of 1911; it stated that though doctrinally correct, his writings were not official political recommendations for Catholics. Robles, Robles Mu√±oz 1997, p. 288 Since the 1910s Roca remained a champion of Catholic virtues only for extreme right-wing groupings like Integrists or Carlists. at the turn of the 1910s and 1920s Roca was cultivated mostly by El Siglo Futuro and El Correo Espa√±ol; see also homage articles in Carlist publications, Brea 1903, pp. 278-281, and Roma 1933, pp. 223-224 Save for a single article written during early Francoism, ABC 04.05.43, available here after death Roca y Ponsa generally fell into oblivion.

Other, somewhat more sympathetic portraits of Roca in Alzola 1992, Garralda Arizcun 1995, Ferrer Mu√±oz 1996, and S√°nchez Rodr√≠guez 2017 In 2012 he was unexpectedly elevated to protagonist of an urban legend in-the-making. A podcast series Milenio 3, focused on paranormal activity, suggested that a house in Villanueva de Ariscal, Roca‚Äôs home during his Seville tenure, was haunted; the authors floated gossip speculations about his private life.the podcast author, Iker Jimenez, suggested that Roca y Ponsa maintained an intimate relationship with his longtime servant, a certain Dolores S√°nchez. As reportedly she suddenly disappeared, the locals allegedly speculated that Roca either murdered her or immured her alive in the dungeons of the house, Fen√≥menos paranormales: la finca del magistral, [in:] Sevilla ciudad de embrujo service, available here.

It conducts, compiles, and disseminates research and technologies to further those aims. Its mission statement makes no mention of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU), the responsibility of other agencies such as the Ministry of Labour. History The government began to take an interest in Thai fisheries management in 1901, primarily as a source of taxes and tariffs. A royal proclamation on 22 September 1921 gave the Ministry of Lands and Agriculture responsibility for aquaculture, preservation of aquatic animals, and regulating fishing equipment. The Department of Aquatic Animal Conservation was established on 21 September 1926. It was renamed the Department of Fisheries (DOF) in 1933, then combined with the Department of Agriculture as the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries. Two years later, it was again made a separate department. In 1954 it assumed its current name, Krom Pramong, 'Department of Fisheries'. Mission The department is both a promotional and regulatory agency, with emphasis on the former. Organization DOF's central administration is composed of 24 units. At the local level, the department has offices in all 76 provinces as well as 527 DOF district offices. Budget The DOF's budget was 4,094 million baht in FY2019, down from 4,457 million baht in FY2018. Legal framework Many laws deal with aspects of Thai fisheries. These are the most salient according to the FAO: * Royal Ordinance on Fisheries B.E. 2560 (2017) * Royal Ordinance on Fisheries B.E.2558 (2015) * The Wildlife Reservation and Protection Act, B.E. 2535 (1992) * The Enhancement and Conservation of National Environmental Quality Act, B.E. 2535 (1992) * Fisheries Act B.E. 2490 (1947) Revised in 1953 and 1985. * The Act Governing the Right to Fish in Thai Waters, B.E. 2482 (1939) * The Thai Vessel Act, B.E. 2481 (1938) See also * Fisheries management * Ocean fisheries * Thailand fisheries * World fish production References Category:Government departments of Thailand Category:Fishing in Thailand Category:Fishing organizations ","title":"Department of Fisheries (Thailand)"},{"id":"62620391","title":"List of Belgian football transfers winter 2019‚Äì20"},{"id":"62620399","text":"Travaglini is a surname.

Life and career  As a child, Edwards was raised by her grandmother and had pet rabbits since the age of 8. At the age of 15, she began a modelling career with a Birmingham agency. Two years later, she was married and stopped modelling until her youngest child was born. Edwards became Miss Birmingham at the age of 29 whilst caring for six children at the time. Later, a ruling would prevent young mothers to compete, leading Edwards to support a campaign to overturn the ban in 2014. Edwards was featured in adverts for Nivea Visage face cream in a 2014 Mother's Day campaign. She was 45 at the time. In an interview about this campaign, Edwards spoke about inappropriate advances from photographers and how this type of harassment had not changed in her lifetime. She has spent around ¬£18,000 on surgery to resemble the likeness of cartoon character Jessica Rabbit, and appeared on the show 50 Greatest Plastic Surgery Shockers. The majority of these surgeries were performed when Edwards was 57, coinciding with the birth of her rabbit Darius, the world's longest rabbit. A photo of Edwards dressed as Jessica Rabbit was made Picture of the Day by The Telegraph in 2009. In 2001 Edwards voiced the character Misty in the Japanese anime horror Malice@Doll. In 2018 Edwards announced that she was retiring from glamour modelling after 40 years of being a model, having previously been awarded the world's oldest Page 3 model by the Guinness Book of World Records. However, since 2004 Edwards has crafted a career in breeding giant rabbits. In 2014 Edwards and her record-breaking rabbit Darius were featured on the Alan Titchmarsh show. Edwards has a large family; she has ten children, and 14 grandchildren. In 2014 Edwards appeared on the BBC radio show Home Truths to discuss her openness to being a surrogate for her daughter, who cannot conceive.  Rabbit breeding  Edwards breeds giant rabbits known as Continental Giants, reportedly at a cost of ¬£5000 per year, covering 2000 carrots and 700 apples. The rabbits require a dog crate but run free in the garden during the day. Edwards has bred four rabbits that have won awards from the Guinness Book of Records, including Roberto who was her first rabbit to be crowned the largest rabbit in 2004. The award for world's longest rabbit has been held by Edwards consecutively since then, spanning over three generations of rabbits. Since 2010, Darius has held the record for the world's longest rabbit, with a length of 4 ft 4inches and a weight of 3.5 stone. Darius took this award from his own mother Alice, who herself took the title from her mother Amy in 2009. In 2018, Edwards announced the retirement of Darius, then 8 years old. Darius has been featured on the Jimmy Carr show and the CBC show Remarkable Rabbits. Edwards feeds her rabbits two meals per day consisting of carrots, rabbit mix, apples and cabbage. In 2019 Daisy May won longest tail in the world, with a length of 17 cm. One of Edward's rabbits, Simon, died in the cargo section of a Boeing 767 during a United Airlines flight from London to America in 2017. Simon was 10 months old and three-foot long at the time. According to Edwards, Simon had a vet check-up three hours prior to the flight. Simon was cremated without permission from Edwards, preventing her from organising an examination. In response to this event, United Airlines then CEO, Oscar Munoz apologised by stating \\"we are deeply sorry for the loss of anything from your luggage, to, of course, a loved pet\\", prompting complaints that he was comparing the death of a pet to misplaced luggage.

He had been an academic in Paris, teaching at the Sorbonne's Institute for Latin American Studies as an external lecturer between 1999 and 2005, and also lectured at the University of Paris-Est Marne- la-Vall√©e. In December 2019, he was extradited by France to stand trial in Argentina. Prosecutors in Argentina based their extradition request on the case of student Hern√°n Abriata, who disappeared in 1976. The extradition was possible because the crimes he was accused of were committed before obtaining the French citizenship. He is also accused of involvement in 500 other cases. According to the New York Times, \\"Mr. Abriata was one of about 5,000 people who disappeared at the Higher School of Mechanics of the Navy, or ESMA\\". The news of his extradition from France to Argentina was welcomed by Argentine human rights activists and relatives of victims of the dictatorship.

Description  The species is distinguished from other elmids by its 8‚Äìsegmented antennae, its side‚Äìlying and silk like elytra, pimply abdominal sternum, and other minor genetic differences. In general, but not always, the more slender form of Z. thermae can visually differentiate it from its sister species, Z. parvula.  Taxonomy  Zaitzevia thermae is sometimes treated as a synonym of or subspecies to Z. parvula; though this appears to be because a morphology report by Hooter in 1991 went unpublished and widely unread, which concluded that Z. thermae was its own distinct species and not a subspecies of another member of the genus. Due to this and the fact that the species is appropriately listed by the US Fish and Wildlife Service, Z. thermae is generally considered its own unique species.  Distribution  Zaitzevia thermae has a very limited range of less than 35 square meters in one specific location. They are known from only a handful of occurrences around a small warm spring along Bridger Creek, near Bozeman, Montana, on land owned by the US Fish and Wildlife Service. The primary threat to the species was the massive reduction of its habitat by human intervention, namely water collection infrastructure at the spring. In addition, fill in and around the spring further reduced the beetle's feeding grounds and habitat. The species is classified as N1, or critically imperiled, by NatureServe, but threats to its longevity have largely been eliminated, and drastic change in the size of its population in the next ten years is unlikely. Another riffle beetle, Microcylloepus browni, has an almost identical distribution, endemic to the warm springs less than 300 meters down stream. Z. parvula, the sister species of Z. thermae, has a distribution that actually overlaps that of the latter species, and has an almost nationwide distribution in the United States.  Ecology  The species is found only in warm springs, in surface flowing water from 60‚Äì84 degrees Fahrenheit. The species attaches itself to the underside of rocks or clings to watercress and feeds on algae on the gravel bottom of the spring using their mandibles. They are non‚Äìmigratory, and their lack of wings makes their dispersal opportunities limited, but are most likely long‚Äìlived, with lifespans of greater than a year.

It describes a place in the spirit world, which varies greatly according to the religious current, but which could generally be equated with a kind of spiritual colony. It is often understood as a spiritual citadel that would orbit the ionosphere of planet Earth. Meanings Despite the abundant literature, Umbanda is not considered a codified religion. For this reason, the term Aruanda may have several meanings, depending on the terreiro, or spiritualist center in which it is mentioned. It is even used by other spiritualistic religions such as Quimbanda and Candombl√©, in generic reference to \\"spiritual plane\\", the place where the higher \\"guides\\" would live. For the traditional Umbanda, founded in 1908 by the Caboclo das Sete Encruzilhadas, the inhabitants of Aruanda are working spirits of goodness and charity, newly disembodied in learning, and light spirits who have not been returning to the physical realm for a long time. These spiritual guides, despite their spiritual evolution, remain in the vibrating dimension of Aruanda to continue assisting the incarnate and discarnate, manifesting on Earth under the fluidic clothing (in spiritual typology) of old blacks, caboclos and children. Its true forms, however, transcend race, creed, or ethnicity, and their manifestation is possible in any congregation that practices the love-charity binomial and admits spiritual communication. For Spiritism (codified by Allan Kardec), Aruanda would be the denomination of a spiritual colony, similar to the Nosso Lar colony, described in the book Nosso Lar (Our Home), by Andr√© Luiz (spirit), psychographed by the Brazilian medium Chico Xavier. In Aruanda, however, magical elements of African culture would be present, in syncretism with symbolisms of Judeo- Christian culture.

It was located in present-day southern Shandong and northern Jiangsu. Donghai Commandery was established in the Qin dynasty, possibly under the name Tan Commandery (ÈÉØÈÉ°). In early Western Han, it became part of Liu Jiao's Chu Kingdom. After the abortive Rebellion of the Seven States, Donghai was carved out from Chu. Later, the commandery's borders gradually expanded as marquessates split from nearby kingdoms were added to the commandery. In late Western Han, it administered a total of 38 counties and marquessates: Tan (ÈÉØ), Lanling (Ëò≠Èôµ), Xiangben (Ë•ÑË≥Å), Xiapi (‰∏ãÈÇ≥), Liangcheng (ËâØÊàê), Pingqu (Âπ≥Êõ≤), Qi (Êàö), Qu (Êúê), Kaiyang (ÈñãÈôΩ), Fei (Ë≤ª), Licheng (Âà©Êàê), Haiqu (Êµ∑Êõ≤), Lanqi (Ëò≠Á•∫), Zeng (Áπí), Nancheng (ÂçóÊàê), Shanxiang (Â±±ÈÑâ), Jianxiang (Âª∫ÈÑâ), Jiqiu (Âç≥‰∏ò), Zhuqiu (Á•ùÂÖ∂), Linyi (Ëá®Ê≤Ç), Houqiu (Âéö‰∏ò), Rongqiu (ÂÆπ‰∏ò), Dong'an (Êù±ÂÆâ), Hexiang (ÂêàÈÑâ), Cheng (Êâø), Jianyang (Âª∫ÈôΩ), Quyang (Êõ≤ÈôΩ), Siwu (Âè∏Âêæ), Yuxiang (‰∫éÈÑâ), Pingqu (Âπ≥Êõ≤), Duyang (ÈÉΩÈôΩ), Yinping (Èô∞Âπ≥), Wuxiang (ÈÉöÈÑâ), Wuyang (Ê≠¶ÈôΩ), Xinyang (Êñ∞ÈôΩ), Jianling (Âª∫Èôµ), Changl√º (ÊòåÊÖÆ), Duping (ÈÉΩÂπ≥). The population was 358,414 households, or 1,559,357 individuals.Book of Han, Chapter 28. A number of counties and marquessates were merged in early Eastern Han. The commandery constituted part of the Lu Kingdom during the reigns of Emperor Guangwu and Emperor Ming, until Liu Qiang (ÂäâÂΩä), the prince of Donghai, offered the territory back to the imperial government.Book of Later Han, Chapter 42. In 72 AD, several counties were separated to created the new Xiapi Commandery (‰∏ãÈÇ≥ÈÉ°). In 140, there were 13 counties, namely Tan, Lanling, Qi, Qu, Xiangben, Changl√º, Cheng, Yinping, Licheng, Hexiang, Zhuqi, Houqiu, and Ganyu (Ëµ£Ê¶Ü). The population was 148,784 households, or 706,416 individuals.Book of Later Han, Chapter 111. During Cao Wei dynasty, Donghai served as the fief of Cao Lin, a son of the Emperor Wen, and his son Cao Qi (ÊõπÂïü).Records of the Three Kingdoms, Chapter 20. By the reunification of Jin dynasty in 280, 11,100 households remained in the commandery. In 291, a new commandery, Lanling, was established.Book of Jin, Chapter 15. Donghai subsequently became the fief of the prince and regent Sima Yue.Book of Jin, Chapter 59. After the Disaster of Yongjia, the region fell to Later Zhao. Emperor Ming of Qi reestablished Donghai Commandery at Xiangben. In 549 during Eastern Wei, a commandery centered in Ganyu was renamed Donghai, while the former commandery was renamed to Haixi (Êµ∑Ë•ø). Meanwhile, the former seat of Han and Jin era Donghai, Tan, was part of a new Tan Commandery.Book of Wei, Chapter 106. They were abolished in early Sui dynasty. In Sui and Tang dynasties, Donghai Commandery became an alternative name of Hai Prefecture.Book of Sui, Chapter 31.

The company operates ten stores in Hong Kong as of 2018. History The company was founded in 2014 by So Hiu-fan. So opened the company's first location in a 40-square-foot space in the Apple Mall section of the Dragon Centre shopping mall in Sham Shui Po, which she leased for per month, soon after she separated from her ex-husband. The store initially sold low-cost jewellery and a small amount of stationery purchased online from mainland China, with teenage schoolgirls being its main target audience. Later that year, So expanded the store by leasing ten shop spaces in the Apple Mall, giving a total area between 300 and 400 square feet, and rebranded the store \\"Cheap Lab\\" along with introducing its logo. Cheap Lab opened its second location at Cheung Sha Wan Road in Sham Shui Po. As the company was able to attract a wider range of customers owing to the shop's location on a busy street, the company expanded the types of products it sold to include more types of stationery, household items and smartphone accessories. So met Law Ka-cheung, her current husband, in 2016; Law's parents founded stationery wholesaler Tung Fong Stationery Co. and operated the company for 30 years. Law joined Cheap Lab as a shareholder, injecting capital and introducing new sources for procuring products, such as by bypassing wholesalers and directly importing products from a Korean manufacturer. The company opened six new locations in 2016. As of 2018, the company operates ten locations in Hong Kong. Operations Sit Wai-kit of Ming Pao attributed the rapid expansion of Cheap Lab to various strategies, including its Chinese name Âü∑Á¨†ÂÄâ which gives the impression of a constant clearance sale, and its strategy of importing products and leasing shops. Sit also noted that the company allowed retail staff to manage and interact with customers on the company's Facebook fan page based on their own creativity, including by taking videos of themselves promoting new products, with few restrictions. This stands in contrast with similar stationery retailers in Hong Kong which rarely use social media and instead focus on low pricing and quick inventory turnover. Sit pointed to several examples, including a Cheap Lab employee showcasing a low-cost fidget spinner by demonstrating in a video several ways with which it can be played; and another employee using a pair of 3M titanium scissors, instead of a knife, to cut a roast suckling pig. As of 2019, customers spend an average of HK$20 per purchase at Cheap Lab. The company trialed the sale of higher-priced products in 2019, though So noted that customers were generally unwilling to purchase products priced above HK$50. Rent constitutes 20-30% of the company's costs, higher than most retailers. To reduce costs, the company usually selects shops with both a ground floor and an upper or basement floor, with a combined area larger than 1500 square feet to accommodate multiple types of products. The company said it had difficulty expanding into shopping malls despite its size because most mall operators were unwilling to accept branding the store \\"Âü∑Á¨†\\", which literally means \\"going out of business\\". In addition to founding Cheap Lab, So also founded online baby products retailer Little Monster in 2019, with an initial investment of HK$100,000. In explaining why she decided to start a new brand instead of selling baby products in Cheap Lab locations, she explained that as a mother herself, she felt that the environment inside Cheap Lab stores was not suitable for the sales of baby products. However, she \\"did not rule out\\" potential cooperation between the two brands, such as by setting up a corner in Cheap Lab stores selling baby products.

It began as the Burgersdorp Theological School, founded in 1869 and moved to Potchefstroom, South Africa, at the end of 1904, opening the following year. First building The School‚Äôs first offices, including the dormitories, teachers‚Äô quarters, and classrooms of the Preparatory School, were sold to the Transvaal provincial government in 1926 for ¬£7,500. In 1956, the School repurchased it for the nominal fee of ¬£600. Second building Classes could include up to 12 students. To make more room for students in the Department of Literature (forerunner of the Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education (PU for CHE), the aforementioned buildings and library were moved to a side wing of the Preparatory School. When this too became insufficient, the Theological School shifted to a house on the corner of Molen and Esselen Streets. Around 1918-1919, the original building began to be rented out to the provincial administration for other classes. The GKSA Jubilee Fund, at the 1920 Synod, approved ¬£3,000 to build a new school, after 3 morgans of land had already been purchased for a nominal ¬£25 in 1917. This building, later known as Theological School Number 2, was restored in 1984 for use as the GKSA church museum. Costing ¬£2,475 to build, the schoolhouse opened on April 7, 1922. The TSP stayed there for thirty years. Current complex The TSP buildings were repurposed in the 1950s as part of the GKSA Administrative Offices and Archives, as well as the house of worship for the Potchefstroom-Die Bult Reformed Church. From its dedication on October 18, 1952 to 2015, the main church building housed the Potchefstroom North Reformed Church (GKSA), until it merged with the Noordbrug Reformed Church. The building was errected on decree of the high preacher tannie Ammi du Toit Both the TSP and GKSA needed more room before the current complex was built. The library and reading room especially needed additional space, to the point that the books were stored in an outbuilding. The Archives were also outgrowing their premises, while the GKSA Administrative Offices had taken up two TSP rooms so far. At the 1949 GKSA Synod, the TSP Curator proposed a construction plan to provide space for the library, reading room, archives, and administrative offices, as well as the classrooms and meeting hall of the TSP. The Synod did not see the need to buy new land, since the Potchefstroom City Council had already donated land opposite the old TSP site. The architecture firm of Gerard Moerdyk and Henry Watson (architect) was hired to draw up the blueprints. The sticking point remained the Synod‚Äôs demands for either a long, flat building or a tall, narrow one, neither of which seemed practical. The solution came from an unexpected source. In June 1949, the Potchefstroom North congregation seceded from the Potchefstroom Reformed Church (NGK) without a dedicated building. The Curatorium of the GKSA agreed with the new congregation‚Äôs council that it could build a church alongside the TSP buildings as long as the GKSA Synod meetings could be held therein. This altered the construction plans, requiring a much larger complex and construction all at once rather than in stages. The architects thus agreed upon a unified complex that would be more than the sum of its discreet parts. On the south side, the library and archives were to be housed in a section numbering three 8-ft-high (2.5-m-high) stories, including a top floor for the GKSA Archive with ample expansion room. Shortly before its completion, Rev. Izak Lessing (working for the Admin. Offices from 1948 until his death in 1974) wrote in the 1953 GKSA Almanak that ‚Äúit will be many years before the Theological School runs out of room for books.‚Äù Shelves were built from steel to avoid fire damage, given fresh memories of the February 23, 1949 fire started by a short circuit in the PU for CHE library, which destroyed an estimated 30,000 books, 4,000 magazines, and original manuscripts of poet Jan F. E. Celliers. The cornerstone for the new PU for CHE library was laid in March 1951. The two-story main building faces east. On the lower floor are the reading room (adjoining the library) and the offices. The top floor includes the TSP classrooms, a meeting hall, and the rector‚Äôs office. On the north side, the church building‚Äôs entrance also faces east. It seats 700 in the pews and has space for 100 guests in front of the pulpit for communion services. The square tower is crowned by a clock and bell. This church was designed to serve the Potchefstroom North congregation as well as the TSP students and faculty. The Rev. Lessing wrote in 1952 that the buildings were specially designed, elaborating as follows: > As far as we know, one cannot find a similarly built structure elsewhere, > i.e. one where the Theological School, archives, administrative offices, and > church were all part of the same unit. All those who consider and know the > building find it not only beautiful and interesting but extraordinary. Here > is a complex that can be used week-round. Theology students use the church > building, for instance, during the week for sermon practice. The architects, > however, also planned the buildings‚Äô shape deliberately. The building evokes > the Reformation Wall in Geneva and takes on the aspect of a fortress > symbolizing the simplicity and power of Calvinism. In addition to the aforementioned uses, the GKSA also planned to use the buildings for Synod meetings and parts of the TSP as halls for committee meetings underneath the Synod‚Äôs aegis. Most day-to-day Synod functions, however, could use the administrative offices. The site was ideal for Synod meetings, even down to the hall across the street where refreshments could be served. Construction cost the GKSA and Potchefstroom North around ¬£60,000. The GKSA tendered ¬£23,525. The steel shelves cost ¬£2,450 and the rest of the furniture ¬£1,250. Once fencing was factored in, the 1952 Synod estimated a cost of ¬£30,000 to the denomination to be paid over 20 years. The church building cost around ¬£25,000, excluding the ¬£4,200 organ. The congregation, including large numbers of students and teachers, paid this cost. Potchefstroom North had 565 confirmed members from 130 families in 1952. T.H. Bolton‚Äôs accepted bid for the church building was seen as beyond the congregation‚Äôs means, so several cuts were made to bring the cost to ¬£23,521, including ¬£5,500 for the parsonage and ¬£3,000 for the organ. The organ would be shared by the church with the PU for CHE Conservatory. Prof. M.C. Roode commissioned the specifications for import and construction by South African Organ Builders, and stipulated that conservatory students could practice and give recitals there. This arrangement continued until 1998, when the university gave up use of the instrument after spending R80,000 to restore it. Of what was at the time the largest and most expensive building in over 90 years of GKSA history, Rev. Lessing wrote: > In the past, we lacked the means to undertake such an endeavor. By the grace > of God we prospered to the point where it was possible. Dr. Sarel van der Walt laid the cornerstone on February 2, 1952. On October 18 of that year, the complex was officially opened. Prof. Totius gave the keynote, and the proceedings ended with the singing of Psalm 90‚Äôs verses 1 and 9. References * Lessings, Rev. I.J. and Venter, Rev. A.A. (1952).

New Alamein lies on the Mediterranean Sea, approximately 85 km west of Borg El Arab International Airport. Still under construction, New Alamein was conceived by the Egyptian government as a center for tourism,h education, and government. The city has its own presidential palace and ministry building. Construction is ongoing at New Alamein for three universities, fifteen skyscrapers and high rise towers, and 10,000 hotel rooms. Work has begun on Phase II of the New Alamein megaproject, which includes ten additional coastal towers.  History  Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi inaugurated New Alamein on March 1, 2018. Together with the as-yet-unnamed New Administrative Capital, which is set to replace Cairo as Egypt's capital, New Alamein is one of the mega-projects of the al-Sisi government. Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed al Nahyan toured the construction sites in New Alamein in March 2019. Completed projects include a mega-mall, restaurants, three cinemas, and the Al Masa mosque.  Economy  The al-Sisi government intends for New Alamein to bring large numbers of tourists to the Mediterranean beaches of the northwest coast. The government asserts that approximately 30 developers have been granted permits to move forward with the construction of hotels for 30,000 rooms. Many of these units are in high-rise buildings along the beach, with towers already under construction including The North Edge Towers and The Gate projects. Other centers of activity in New Alamein will include three universities and a \\"city of culture and arts\\" to encompass a Roman Theater, studio complexes, an opera hall, and a cinema complex. Unlike the resorts on the northwest coast, which have private beaches sealed from public access, New Alamein is conceived as being an open city permitting entry to the general public.  Criticism  Some critics have suggested that instead of building new cities, the government of Egypt should instead refurbish buildings and infrastructure in existing cities such as Cairo. Cairo, a city of 19 million, is expected to grow to 24 million by 2027. Due to inadequate public transportation, Cairo has some of the worst traffic jams on the planet. Backers of the new cities counter that with Egypt's population expected to rise to 150 million within a few decades, the government must create new cities to help take some stress off the established cities.

Early life Florence Hamilton Davis was born in New York City around 1865. Flora, as she was known, was the daughter of Bellevue, Ohio born Florence (n√©e Chapman) Davis and John Hagy Davis, a Wall Street banker with John H. Davis & Co., located at 10 Wall Street. She grew up at 24 Washington Square North in New York. Her half-brother, John Ethelbert Davis (1900‚Äì1966), was married to Maude Reppelin Bouvier, a daughter of John Vernou Bouvier Jr. and sister of Edith Ewing Bouvier Beale (of Grey Gardens infamy) and John Vernou Bouvier III (father of Jackie Kennedy Onassis and Princess Lee Radziwill).

When her husband, then Lord Terence Blackwood, was Secretary to the British Embassy at Paris, she frequently sang in private salons in the cause of charity.\\" Personal life Spy published in Vanity Fair in 1896.

On outset of the American Revolutionary War, he started a military career with enthusiasm with his neighbor Anthony Wayne in 1775. His furnace supplied cannon and cannonballs for the Revolutionary Army. Biography Captain Samuel Van Leer was born in 1747 at Marple Township. After his mother's death, he was raised by his father Bernardhus Van Leer, who was known for traveling on horseback until the age of 102 and for being one of the first medical doctors in New York. Dr. Van Leer also maintained an exclusive office practice, which was unique for the time. Bernardhus would later be studied at several medical universities. In 1770 Captain Samuel married his Childhood sweetheart Hannah Wayne, sister to Anthony Wayne and granddaughter of Captain Anthony Wayne, an officer for Prince William of Orange in the Battle of the Boyne. Captain Samuel Van Leer's family and history is also part of historical tour for the Van Leer Cabin and his family's home Van Leer Pleasant Hill Plantation. His family was considered one of the more well known families in Pennsylvania at the time and noted in the anti-slavery cause. Another Van Leer Cabin was used as a station for the Underground Railroad. Captain Samuel was with \\"Mad\\" Anthony Wayne during the famous Battle of Paoli which is also known as the \\"Paoli Massacre\\". He also commanded the Seventh Company, Fifth Battalion during the Battle of Brandywine and during the Battle of Germantown. All of his brothers were military officers during the war. Later in his military career, he was selected to lead the Light Horse Dragoons Company, a small elite group with great horsemanship. Horses were trained and selected for stealthy activities and only existing American citizens could apply. After his retirement from the military, Captain Samuel went on to grow his Iron business in Reading Furnace, which was already supplying cannons for the Continental Army and lived in the historical Warwick Furnace Farms mansion with his wife Hannah. The furnace was a center of colonial iron making and is associated with the introduction of the Franklin Stove, and the retreat of George Washington's army following its defeat at the Battle of Brandywine, where they came for musket repairs.\\"General Washington retreated to Warwick to have the army's muskets repaired,,\\" Warwick Furnace Historical Marker, May 12, 1948.

All children would own or be involved with the iron industry. On 10 July 1786 They had twin girls and Hannah would die due to birth complications. After her death, Anthony Wayne offered to have Van Leer's kids stay with his family. Captain Van Leer Instead kept his children at his home and never remarried. His granddaughter Ellen Francis Van Leer married George Hussey Earle Sr., who was also part of the anti-slavery movement and prominent Philadelphia lawyer.

The film presents the biblical stories of Adam and Eve, David and Bathsheba, and Samson and Delilah in the form of pornographic vignettes, and stars Bo White, Caprice Couselle, Georgina Spelvin, Nicholas Flammel, Brahm van Zetten, and Gloria Grant. It is the only straight pornographic film to be directed by Poole, who was primarily a director of gay pornography. Cast Little people Willie and Kathy Hermine play Delilah's servants. Production Writer-director Wakefield Poole avidly studied the Bible as a child, and wanted to tell three stories from the Old Testament from a female perspective, as he felt that biblical narratives often cast women in a negative light. He wanted to make the film without dialogue, instead staging it to a musical composition, √† la \\"an adult Fantasia.\\" Poole initially wanted to cast Charles Ludlam and Lola Pashalinski respectively as David and Bathsheba, but after encountering creative differences with Ludlam, Poole instead cast Georgina Spelvin as Bathsheba and his neighbor John Horn as David. In order to protect his career, Horn was credited as \\"Nicholas Flammel\\". Candy Darling wanted the role of Mary in the film, but Poole cast Bonnie Mathais, a soloist with the American Ballet Theatre, as Mary instead. In his 2000 book Dirty Poole: The Autobiography of a Gay Porn Pioneer, Poole expressed regret for not having given Darling the part, writing: \\"To this day I'm sorry I didn't use her.\\" Poole offered Gloria Grant, a waitress at a Steak and Brew he frequented, the part of Delilah after watching her \\"move gracefully through the tables\\", and she accepted. Bible! was filmed in the Caribbean and in the United States on 16 mm. Scenes which take place in the Garden of Eden were shot on the island of Virgin Gorda in the British Virgin Islands. The David and Bathsheba segment was filmed in a large garage on Mulberry Street in Little Italy, Manhattan, and the final scenes featuring Mary were shot in Yuma, Arizona. Poole and producer Marvin Shulman spent over $100,000 to make the film. Marketing and release According to the 2004 book Contemporary American Independent Film: From the Margins to the Mainstream by editors Chris Holmlund and Justin Wyatt, Bible! was advertised in mainstream publications, and elicited protests as a result. Press screenings were held, and the film was exhibited at the Lincoln Art Theatre in 35 mm, blown up from its original 16 mm format. The film ultimately performed poorly at the box office. Several sources list the film's release year as 1973, including writer-director Poole and home video distributor Vinegar Syndrome. Other sources list the release year as 1974, and a 1973 issue of Cinefantastique lists a more specific release date of April 1974. The Cinefantastique listing is included under a disclaimer which notes Bible! as being among a number of films that were \\"in release during the rating period, [but] were seen by no one\\", indicating that \\"these films are in very limited release\\" or \\"have not been in release long enough to appear on the chart, but will be included in the future.\\" Critical reception Lee Pfeiffer of Cinema Retro wrote that the film \\"has some striking visual elements, some of them effective and creative and others bordering on the pretentious\\", and called it \\"one of the strangest film projects of its era.\\" In his 2016 book Dirty Words and Filthy Pictures: Film and the First Amendment, writer Jeremy Geltzer called the film \\"the strangest genre-hybrid of the porno chic era, if not of all time\\".

After 1945 he embarked on a career as a party official in what became East Germany. In 1951 he was appointed to a consultancy position with the national statistical office. In February 1957 he took over as head of the East German statistical service, retaining the post till his death in an air crash not quite six years later. His wife M√§rta and two of the couple's three sons, Kurt and Bernd, were also killed. Life Heinz Rauch was born into a working class family in Sch√∂nefeld (Leipzig). His first full-time job, between 1929 and 1932, was as a clerk with the Dresdner Bank. In 1933 he joined the Communist Party in his home city of Leipzig. 1933 was also the year in which the Hitler government took power and lost little time in transforming Germany into a one-party dictatorship: one effect of that was that at around the same time that Rauch joined the party, his membership of it became illegal. In July 1933 he emigrated via Denmark to Sweden, where he remained till 1936. In August 1934, as the result of a highly publicised extradition application, Rauch came into contact with the well-known Swedish lawyer-politician (and son of the former \\"statsminister\\" - loosely, \\"prime minister\\" Hjalmar Branting), Georg Branting (1887‚Äì1965). A set-back came in November 1934, however, when Rauch was arrested. Rauch's detention was relatively brief, since during 1935/36 he was working as a toolmaker in Stockholm. In the summer of 1936 he travelled with Rudi M√ºller to Spain where civil war was breaking out. Their purpose was to participate in the anticipated fighting as members of the communist inspired International Brigades. He fought initially as a member of the 14th Brigade and then with the 11th Brigade. He attended the internationalists' Pozo Rubio officers' training school at Albacete. Subsequently he was badly wounded and appointed to the rank of lieutenant. At around the same time he was accepted for membership of the Spanish Communist Party. In or shortly before 1938 Rauch also undertook an engineering traineeship. Later in 1938 he returned to Sweden. In 1940 he became a member of the leadership team of the exiled German Communist Party. It was also in 1940 that Heinz Rauch married the Swedish communist, M√§rta Jansson (1919 ‚Äì 1962). In July 1940 Rauch was sent by the party to Norway where for several months he engaged in \\"illegal political work\\" among German soldiers stationed there. His stay in Norway was cut short, however, following intervention by the Communist Party of Norway which at this point was desperately keen to avoid becoming involved in any confrontation with the German occupation forces. On 5 July 1941, accompanied by Franz Stephany, he was sent back to Norway in order to make contact with the (by this time illegal) Central Committee of the Communist Party in Oslo. They stayed for several days before Rauch slipped quietly across the border back into Sweden. Back in Berlin Heinz Rauch's continuing political involvement during his Swedish exile had not gone unnoticed, and on 2 March 1942 he was formally stripped of his German citizenship. Although Rauch managed to remain below the radar during most of his time in Sweden, there is little doubt that he remained politically active till the war ended. One source points to powerful, albeit circumstantial evidence that the purpose of Rauch's visit to Norway at the start of July 1941 had been to meet up with Asbj√∏rn Sunde and \\"activate\\" the sustained sabotage operation that now emerged in occupied Norway. In 1944 Rauch was a delegate to the party conference held in Sweden by the German Communist Party in exile. Heinz Rauch returned to the region administered as the Soviet occupation zone in Germany via Danzig with other activist comrades who had spent the war in Sweden, including Georg Henke, Josef Miller, Wolfgang Steinitz and Paul Verner. The men arrived at the Stettiner Bahnhof (as the \\"Nordbahnhof\\" was then known) on the north side of central Berlin on 19 January 1946. The military authorities agreed that Rauch should be permitted to return to his Saxon homeland, where for a couple of months, till March 1946, he attended the \\"Fritz Heckert\\" party academy at Ottendorf. The next month he took part in the party conference in Berlin which implemented the contentious merger between the Communist party and the Social Democratic Party, resulting in the creation of the Socialist Unity Party (Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands / SED). The stated purpose of the party merger, which in the event took effect only in Germany's Soviet occupation zone, was to avoid a return to power of a nationalist-populist government (as had happened in 1933), facilitated by divisions on the political left. Heinz Rauch was one of hundreds of thousands of Communist Party members in the Soviet zone who lost no time in signing their Communist Party membership over to the new party. Still in Saxony, during 1946/47 he served as Party Secretary in Bautzen and as a member of the regional party executive (\\"Bezirksvorstand\\") for East Saxony (as the Dresden region was identified at the time). A further practical indication that Rauch had found favour with the military authorities and party establishment came in 1947/48, during which time he served as head of the Soviet News and Information Service for East Saxony. It was also during 1948 that his wife and the couple's (at this stage two) children relocated from Sweden to join him, reuniting the young family in the Soviet occupation zone. M√§rta took a job in the foreign trade sector. In 1947 Rauch became a member of the Vereinigung der Verfolgten des Naziregimes (VVN / \\"Union of Persecutees of the Nazi Regime\\"). Between 1948 and 1950 Rauch worked as the head of the Agitation section with the national leadership committee of the \\"Freier Deutsche Gewerkschaftsbund\\" (FDGB / \\"Free [East] German [National] Trade Union Federation\\". It was during this period, in October 1949, that the Soviet occupation zone was formally relaunched as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic (East Germany). In November 1950 Rauch accepted a position as senior press officer (\\"Pressereferent\\") with the East German Ministry of Labour. In February 1951 he was installed as chairman of a government audit commission. Also in 1951 he took a consultancy position with the national statistical office: in January 1952 he became first deputy head. Between 1953 and 1955 he undertook a correspondence course with the \\"Karl Marx\\" Party Academy in Berlin. Clearly marked out for further party-political advancement, between September 1956 and September 1957 Rauch was in Moscow, attending the Party academy of the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee. On his return from Moscow, in October 1957 Heinz Rauch succeeded Fritz Behrens as head of the East German statistical service. On 19 July 1958 Rauch was appointed to membership of the important National Planning Commission, then under the chairmanship of Bruno Leuschner.Neues Deutschland 20 July 1958 On 4 July 1962 he was also appointed to the Ministerial Council.Neues Deutschland 5 July 1962 Among his other appointments, Heinz Rauch was made a member of the party's National Audit Commission (\\"Zentralen Revisionskommission der SED\\") at the fourth party congress in April 1954.Neues Deutschland 7 April 1954 Heinz Rauch's work conferred significant and (in East Germany) highly unusual international travel privileges, which evidently extended to family members. On 19 December 1962 Rauch and his wife M√§rta, along with two of their sons, were passengers on the second leg of a LOT flight from Brussels to Warsaw, which had touched down in Berlin for a mid-way stop. On the final approach to Warsaw the Vickers Viscount 804 crashed slightly more than a kilometer short of the runway and burst into flames. There were no survivors among the 28 passengers and 5 crew members. Heinz and M√§rta Rauch were survived by their youngest son, Lars Rauch. Agnes Rauch, the mother of Heinz Rauch, was also still alive at the time of his death. Following the accident, during the early afternoon of 28 December 1962, the Party Central Committee and the Ministerial Council held a high-profile celebration ceremony (\\"Trauerakt\\") for Rauch and his recently deceased family members at Berlin's Baumschulenweg Crematorium.

He mostly worked in Neo-renaissance, Neo-romanticic and Serbo-Byzantine Revival styles. Biography Nikoliƒá finished elementary school in Senta, and continued his education in Panƒçevo, Maribor, Munich and later went on to Vienna and enrolled at the Polytechnic but did not finish his studies. He spent nine years working on several projects in the Kingdom of Serbia, for which he was awarded Order of the Cross of Takovo by king Milan I of Serbia. In early 1892 Nikoliƒá moved from Belgrade to Sremski Karlovci, which was the spiritual capital of Serbs of Vojvodina. At the behest of his godfather or cousin Patriarch Georgije Brankoviƒá, he designed and built numerous buildings in Sremski Karlovci and other parts of Vojvodina, including the Patriarchate Court. Nikoliƒá was an active hunter and winemaker. The architecture of the Patriarch's Palace (1892) belongs to the neo-Renaissance and the Secession, although the author found his inspiration on the boundaries of the Renaissance, and among the Romantic and Byzantine symbols. After constructing the Bishop's Palace according to the principles of Theophil Hansen (1901), he remained faithful to the spirit of neo-Romanticism, the Byzantine tradition and the Secession.

It aims to observe the B-mode polarisation signal from inflation in the early Universe. It is located at Teide Observatory, on the island of Tenerife in the Canary Islands.  Scientific goals  The telescope was constructed to measure the B-mode signal in the polarisation of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), in order to look for evidence of cosmic inflation in the early universe. It aims to observe the reionization bump at l<20 and the recombination peak around l=200. The name 'GroundBIRD' indicates that the telesope is ground-based, while BIRD stands for B-mode Imaging Radiation Detector. It is related to the future, similarly-named, LiteBIRD CMB satellite.  Telescope  The detector focal plane (left) along with the primary (bottom) and secondary (right) mirrors, which are all located in the cryostat. The telescope consists of two mirrors in a Mizuguchi-Dragone configuration, with a diameter of . The telescope is inside the cryostat, which is mounted on a rotation table, with a rotary joint that provides helium gas and electricity to the cryostat. The mirrors are cooled to using a Pulse tube refrigerator to reduce the thermal noise from the mirror surfaces. The experiment uses microwave kinetic inductance detectors (MKIDs), which are cooled to 250mK by a sorption cooler within the cryostat, which uses Helium-3, and was manufactured by Chase Research Cryogenics Ltd. The signals from the detector are multiplexed, and around 100 detectors can be measured in both phase and amplitude with a single digital read-out system with a bandwidth of 200MHz, recording 1,000 samples per second. The digital system uses 12-bit ADCs and a Kintex-7 FPGA from Xilinx initially, and now uses Kintex ultrascale FPGAs. The cryostat rotates at 20 rpm (120¬∞ per second) to minimize 1/f noise. It observes at zenith angles up to 20¬∞, mapping around 40% of the sky. The field of view is 10¬∞, with an angular resolution of 0.5¬∞ FWHM at 145GHz, and 0.3¬∞ at 220GHz. It will measure the CMB at 6 The telescope was constructed at KEK in Japan. Test observations started in Japan in 2014.

Federation of Pakistan was the first constitutional case after the promulgation of Constitution of Pakistan of 1956 and an important case in Pakistan's political history. The case got prominence as it indirectly questioned the first martial law imposed by President Iskander Mirza in 1958. Dosso was the tribal person from district Loralai in Baluchistan then under Provincially Administered Tribal Areas who committed a murder and got arrested by tribal authorities and handed over to Loya jirga which convicted him under Frontier Crimes Regulation. Relatives of Dosso challenged the decision in Lahore High Court the then West Pakistan High Court which ruled in favour of Dosso. Federal Government went on to the Supreme Court of Pakistan which reversed the High Court's decision by referring to the Hans Kelsen theory of Legal positivism famously the Doctrine of necessity.  Case facts  Dosso a resident of tribal district Loralai committed a murder and got arrested by the Levis Forces which handed him over to the tribal authorities where he was trialed by Loya Jirga. He was charged for murder under the section 11 of the FCR 1901 and was convicted for it by Loya Jirga. Dosso‚Äôs relatives challenged the decision of Loya Jirga in Lahore High Court. The High Court considered the case according to the 1956 constitution of Pakistan and ruled in favour of Dosso. The High Court declared that FCR is against the constitution and Dosso is entitled to equality before law under article 5 & 7 of the constitution. Loya Jirga‚Äôs decision was declared null and void. Federal Government of Pakistan filed an appeal in Supreme Court of Pakistan against the verdict of High Court.  Hearing in High Court  Relatives of Dosso filed a petition against his conviction by Loya Jirga in West Pakistan High Court (Lahore High Court) that he is the citizen of Pakistan and being a citizen of Pakistan he must be tried according to the Pakistani laws, not the FCR. Articles 5 of the Constitution of Pakistan 1956 states that all citizens are equal before law and under article 7 enjoy equal protection of the constitution. Dosso‚Äôs relatives also challenged the relevant provisions of FCR considering them against the article 5 and 7 of the constitution. = Judgement = High Court decided the case in favour of Dosso and declared that FCR is against the 1956 Constitution. The Constitution of Pakistan ensures the equality and protection of citizens and declared the proceedings of Loya Jirga as null and void.  Legal effects of the judgement  The effect of Lahore High Court's decision was that after declaring FCR against the constitution and proceedings of Loya Jirga as null and void, the cases which were decided since the promulgation of new constitution of 1956 were in question. It was said that if conviction of Loya Jirga in Dosso case is declared null and void then what about the previous convictions of Loya Jirga after promulgation of Constitution in 1956.  Supreme Court's hearing  Federal Government of Pakistan appealed against the decision of Lahore High Court in the Supreme Court of Pakistan and Supreme Court set the hearing date for the case on 13 October 1958. = First Martial law 1958 = On 7 October 1958, a harsh change came in the political history of Pakistan. President Iskander Mirza imposed first martial law of the country and made Commander-in-Chief of Pakistan Army General Ayub Khan as Chief Martial Law Administrator (CMLA). All of the government machinery; legislatures, central and provincial were dissolved. After three days of martial law, an order named Laws (Continuance in Force) Order 1958 was issued by CMLA Ayub Khan. This order was a new legal order which replaced the old legal order i.e The Constitution of Pakistan 1956. The legal order validated all the laws other than constitution of 1956 and restored the jurisdiction of all courts.  Impacts of Martial law on the case  Martial law impacted the case significantly and raised some technical points that if Supreme Court maintains the decision of Lahore High Court, it meant that constitution was still in force because the Lahore High Court decided the case under article 5 and 7 of the Constitution of Pakistan 1956. Also if the constitution was still in force then what will be the status of martial law regulations and Laws (Continuance in Force) Order 1958 as it also challenged the martial law administration. = Judgement = The Supreme Court after restoration decided the case against the decision of Lahore High Court with sole dissenting note by Justice Cornelius. Supreme Court bench headed by Justice Munir based its decision on Hans Kelsen's General Theory of Law and State.  Main aspects of judgement  The judgment legitimized the martial law of 1958 as a bloodless coup and a kind of peaceful revolution which was not resisted or opposed by the public implied that public is satisfied with this change or revolution, so therefore this martial law is legit. According to the Supreme Court, Laws (Continuance in Force) Order 1958 is the new legal order instead of Constitution of Pakistan 1956 which got abrogated and the validity of a law is determined by this new legal order. Furthermore it was held that the constitution is abrogated, therefore FCR 1901 is in force according to the Laws (Continuance in Force) Order 1958 which validated the decision of Loya jirga.  Significance  Dosso case has a far reaching effect on the political history of Pakistan. The recognition of martial law and with the reborn of Kelsen‚Äôs outdated theory which afterwards was applied in many other cases in Pakistan as well as in the outer world. = Politics of Pakistan = Supreme Court's judgement in Dosso case greatly impacted the politics in Pakistan and opened the doors for the future martial laws in the country. Legitimization of martial law given power to CMLA Ayub Khan who used it to rule the country for next 10-11 years. Democratic process in the country was crippled which had recently been on the road after the promulgation of 1st constitution in 1956 and made the country to run on the track of dictatorship. Military was encouraged by it for future interventions which occurred three times afterwards. The decision also deprived country of its first constitution just after two years of its promulgation after the struggle of 9 long years. Abrogation of the 1956 Constitution also disturbed the ties between East and West Pakistan which were recently settled by establishing parity between both wings and incorporating both Urdu and Bengali as national language. The decision of the Supreme Court re-validated the British implied legacy of Frontier Crimes Regulation, which was known as the Black Law continued to be enforced in the tribal region till 2018. = Independence of Judiciary = The decision of the Supreme Court of Pakistan was a serious blow to the independence of judiciary and judiciary was bound to render its service under new legal order. The decision also deprived the courts to hear appeals against the action of government.

History  The party was founded during a ceremony held in Yerevan on September 15, 2018. The party did participate in the 2018 Armenian parliamentary election, however the party received just 0.51% percent of the popular vote and failed to gain any political representation in the National Assembly. The party had nominated 82 candidates to run in the election across the country. Following the election results, the party pledged to support the elected government of Nikol Pashinyan but that it would also act as an extra- parliamentary force to ensure that democratic principals are upheld in the country.  Ideology  The party supported the developments of the 2018 Armenian revolution and aimed to strengthen the results of the revolution by establishing a new political party, based on Christian morals and democratic values. During a press statement, Levon Shirinyan stated, \\"We want to develop the cultural values of the country and revive the Armenian high culture.\\"https://arminfo.info/full_news.php?id=36694‚ü®=3] The parties chairman also stated that the principal ideology will be a combination of both socialism and conservatism, while strongly opposing liberalism. Shirinyan stated, \\"In the 1990s, we had communistic extremism and now we have liberalism. Both are dangerous, both direct to nowhere.\\" In terms of economics, the party advocates for a strong social market economy and a revival of the industrial sector. In regards to foreign policy, the party does not wish to align completely with either Russia or the West. The party is opposed to the Russification of Armenia. Rather, party leaders advocate towards maintaining neutrality and developing a mutually beneficial relationship with Russia.

From 1964 to 1993, she was head of the district court in Engelhartszell. She was the first woman to head a rural district court in the Judiciary of Austria. Biography Alice Ingrid Annemarie Nargang was born in Chernivtsi, Romania, April 17, 1929. She came from an old Austrian family of civil servants. Her great-grandfather was the classical philologist and high school director, Stefan Wolf; a grandfather was a lawyer. The family lived in Czernowitz in Bukovina, which until the end of World War I belonged to the Austrian monarchy as its own crown land, then fell to the Kingdom of Romania and is currently partly in Ukraine (including Chernivtsi). She was raised by her mother and grandmother. The father left the family when she was two years old. In the summer of 1940, when Nargang was eleven years old, the Soviet Union entered into northern Bukovina as a result of the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact and agreed with the German Reich to resettle the population of German origin. With mother and grandmother, Nargang first moved to Lower Silesia, then to Upper Silesia. When the Russians approached towards the end of World War II, they fled to Upper Austria. As so-called \\"expellees\\"\\" and \\"ethnic Germans\\" living in Oberweis near Gmunden, Nargang attended the secondary school in Gmunden from autumn 1945. After graduating in 1948, she studied jurisprudence in Innsbruck. She also attended a graduate course at the commercial academy. In 1952, she received her doctorate in law. After a year-long judicial clerkship, she studied economics until 1955. In 1959, she completed a doctorate in social and economic sciences. During this time, Nargang had already started working as an apprentice lawyer in Linz and passed the bar exam. Subsequently, she worked as a lawyer at the Linz Magistrate. In 1963, she became a judge. From 1964 until her retirement in 1993, Nargang headed the district court of Engelhartszell. She was the first woman to head a rural Austrian district court . As a contemporary historian, Nargang researched the history of the Bukovina Germans and the situation of the refugees in Upper Austria after the Second World War. She was also a founding member of the regional team of the Bukovina Germans in Linz . In her later years, Nargang lived in Engelhartszell, Linz, and Vienna. She died in Sch√§rding, May 10, 2019.

Smith, 588 U.S. ___ (2019), was a United States Supreme Court case from the October 2018 term. In a 6-3 ruling, the Court held that the 3-year statute of limitations for a fabrication of evidence civil lawsuit under section 1983 of the Civil Rights Act begins to run when the criminal case ends in the plaintiff's favor. (2019). This case was notable as a victory for criminal defendants; the precedent it set would make it easier to sue prosecutors and police for fabricating evidence against defendants. The Court's ruling also resolves a circuit split between United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and other federal appeals courts.  Case background  = Case history = The Working Families Party (WFP) is a small political party in New York State. In September 2009, its Rensselaer County affiliate held a party primary to select its nominees for the upcoming Troy city council elections. During the primary, at least 50 absentee ballots were fraudulently obtained and cast by local political operatives attempting to gain control of the WFP's ballot line for the New York State Democratic Party. These ballots were submitted to Ed McDonough, who - as a commissioner of the Rensselaer County Board of Elections - was responsible for processing the applications. The scandal was exposed after a local Republican Party official, Robert Mirch, funded an initial investigation into reports that some absentee ballots that were cast in the WFP primary were fraudulent. Several residents swore affidavits claiming to have never filled out an absentee ballot application or to have never received or cast votes that were recorded in their name. A county judge appointed special prosecutor, Youel \\"Trey\\" Smith, to conduct the investigation following the recusal of the local District Attorney, a Democrat. The resulting investigation led to eight indictments; of these, four individuals (two Democratic Party operatives, a city clerk, and a city councilman) pled guilty; the charges against two other former city councilmen were dropped). The two remaining defendants, former councilman Michael LoPorto and former Board of Elections Commissioner Ed McDonough, were tried twice; in their first trial, they were tried together and the jury deadlocked, necessitating a mistrial. In their second trials, which were conducted separately, both defendants were acquitted by their respective juries. In his lawsuit, which was first filed in 2015 (just under 3 years since he was acquitted), McDonough claimed that Smith had intentionally framed him, fabricating evidence to link him to the ballot fraud case. According to McDonough, Smith falsified affidavits, coached witnesses to lie, and orchestrated a faulty DNA analysis to connect McDonough to the fraudulent ballot envelopes. For example, McDonough points to one witness who did not implicate McDonough before the grand jury but changed his testimony after allegedly receiving a phone call from Smith directing him to do so. McDonough alleged that Smith chose to frame him due to a political grudge that Smith had against his family.  In lower courts  McDonough's case was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York under 42 USC 1983. He asserted two separate constitutional violations: denial of due process because of fabrication of evidence and malicious prosecution, which are violations of the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.. In late 2016, District Court dismissed the malicious prosecution claim because Smith had prosecutorial immunity. It then dismissed the fabricated-evidence claim due to the statute of limitations. McDonough appealed his case to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which heard the case in late 2017. The case was heard by a three-judge panel consisting of Judges Christopher F. Droney, Reena Raggi, and Dennis Jacobs. Writing for the Second Circuit, Judge Droney upheld the District Court's ruling dismissing the lawsuit against Smith. The Second Circuit found that the statute of limitations on a fabricated-evidence claim runs when the plaintiff becomes aware of the fabricated evidence and has been deprived of liberty in some way. Under this framework, the statute of limitations began to run during McDonough's first trial, which took place more than three years before he filed his lawsuit. This approach created a circuit split since it contradicted the approaches taken by the Third, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits, each of which had held that the statute of limitations begins when the criminal proceedings ended. McDonough appealed his case again, this time to the United States Supreme Court. He filed a writ of certiorari requesting that they hear the case in October 2018. The justices granted the writ, agreeing to hear the case in January 2019. In oral arguments before the Court, which took place in April 2019, McDonough was represented by Neal Katyal, former acting United States Solicitor General under President Barack Obama. Thomas O'Connor, from the Albany law firm Napierski, VanDenburgh, Napierski, & O'Connor, represented Smith.  Supreme Court opinion  = Majority opinion = In a 6-3 opinion written by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the Supreme Court held that the three-year statute of limitations for fabricated- evidence claims under section 1983 of the Civil Rights Act did not begin until the case had been favorably adjudicated in favor of the plaintiff. Under common law, a statute of limitations usually begins to run once the plaintiff has a complete and present cause of action (e.g. once all elements of the tort have taken place). However, under certain circumstances, a claim can't be realistically filed while the violation is ongoing; under those circumstances, the statute of limitations may be delayed until a later time. In determining what common law principles to apply, the Supreme Court drew an analogy between McDonough's Constitutional fabricated-evidence claim and the common law tort known as malicious prosecution, which the Court found to be the tort most similar to McDonough's allegation. For malicious prosecution cases, the statute of limitations does not begin to run until the case is resolved in favor of the plaintiff. The Supreme Court opinion noted that the common law rule for malicious prosecution had a pragmatic purpose as well, to ensure that criminal and civil cases over the same subject matter would not overlap or result in conflicting determinations. = Dissent = The dissent, authored by Justice Clarence Thomas and joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Neil Gorsuch, argued that the Supreme Court should not have granted McDonough's petition for a writ of certiorari. The dissent noted that the nature and elements of his claim (e.g. the specific Constitutional rights he claims were violated) were not clearly defined, making it difficult to determine which common law principles should be applied. = Effect = The Supreme Court overturned the Second Circuit's initial decision against McDonough and allowed his case to go forward. Following the ruling, the Second Circuit issued an order returning the case to the Northern District in New York for further litigation.

Shirazi was of Persian descent, originally from the Iranian city of Shiraz.  Career  Shah Jalal's mausoleum. Documents show that Shirazi was a commander for the Subahdar of Bengal, Shah Shuja. He succeeded Noorullah as Faujdar of Shujabad Sarkar (Kamrup region) in 1656. In 1657, Shirazi built the hilltop mosque at Hajo, known as Powa-Makkah Barmaqam. It contained the shrine of Ghiyath ad-Din Awliya, an Iraqi prince and preacher commonly credited for introducing Islam to the region. Shirazi was a disciple of Shah Syed Niamatullah of Karnal and he was visited by the Shah in this mosque according to inscriptions. As Mir Jumla's invasion of Assam commenced, Shirazi fled from Guwahati to Dhaka in 1658 after the Ahoms and the Koch Biharis rebelled, being led by their rulers Supangmung and Pran Narayan respectively. In Dhaka, he was then appointed the faujdar of Sylhet Sarkar and migrated there, replacing Sultan Nazar. In 1660, he established a strong enclosure in Shah Jalal's dargah in Sylhet town and also built a small mosque next to it. The Persian inscription stating this is still in existence today.

Gentoo family tree  Calculate Linux   Chromium OS and Chrome OS   Container Linux (formerly CoreOS)   FireballISO  FireballISO (or \\"Fireball\\") is a VMware virtual appliance that builds a security-hardened Live CD containing a stripped-down custom version of Gentoo Linux. The original intent of the project is focused on providing firewall and networking services to a network, but the appliance can be customized in almost limitless ways to build bootable ISOs that can do many different things. When burned to a CD-ROM, it will allow a perhaps otherwise unused, old computer to boot it and act as a network security device. It may also be used in a virtual environment as a secure cloud appliance. Notable features in the generated ISO include: * (Version 1.4) Encryption is now truly optional (there were issues with how 1.3 handled unencrypted builds). Many updates to Gentoo Hardened files, including compiler-provided increased stack protection. Extensive cleanups to build script; now supports \\"test\\" build which can be customized to make a different ISO than the \\"deployment\\" build, suitable for testing or other purposes. Many features removed (tunnels, DSL support, etc.) to make appliance more generic. * (Version 1.3) Except for the files required early in the boot process (such as the kernel and initramfs), the contents can now be optionally encrypted, which makes it much more difficult and time-consuming for someone that may steal the ISO to access the contents. Default encryption is 256-bit AES. See the documentation for issues related to encryption. * (Version 1.2) All programs updated and recompiled with Hardened Gentoo kernel and compiler toolchain, resulting in increased protection from several kinds of overflows and other security vulnerabilities. * IPv4 and IPv6 support * iptables and ip6tables firewalls * SSH server for full command-line access * DNS cache and DHCP server * tcpdump & other networking utilities * Perl and Python scripting languages * NTP client * Extremely customizable, just like a regular Gentoo Linux system * Unnecessary programs removed from generated ISO; can be customized for even smaller size * Low hardware requirements for ISO: Pentium computer with a CD-ROM drive capable of booting, and two network interface cards, or equivalent virtual environment. No hard disk, monitor, or keyboard is needed for the unencrypted configuration (though a monitor and keyboard might be useful for troubleshooting configurations as needed). A keyboard and monitor are required at start-up if encryption is used. The virtual appliance can be updated just like a normal Gentoo system, allowing new Live CD images to be generated with the latest security fixes, bug corrections, additional features, and updated configurations. The Live CD should be re-generated as often as important changes are released by the authors of the various software packages it contains. =Release history= * Fireball Release 1 - March 3, 2009 * Fireball Release 1.1 - June 22, 2009 * Fireball Release 1.2 - December 30, 2010 * Fireball Release 1.3 - January 13, 2012 * Fireball Release 1.4 - March 6, 2015 * Fireball Release 1.5 - June 9, 2017  Funtoo  Funtoo Linux( ) is a Linux distribution based on Gentoo Linux, created by Daniel Robbins (the founder and former project leader of Gentoo Linux) in 2008. It's developed by a core team of developers, and built around a basic vision of improving the core technologies previously used by Gentoo Linux. = History = In early 2008, Daniel Robbins proposed to resolve the Gentoo Foundation problems. But he had left the project in 2004, and his offer was refused. The Funtoo project was born as an initiative to implement his vision, with aims to share innovations. =Features= Funtoo is a source based Linux distribution. Its development is discussed on IRC and a mailing list. Changes are sometimes announced in advance, and published via an Atom feed. =Core technologies= Funtoo features in addition to native UTF-8 by default include:  Kits  In July 2017 Funtoo switched from plain portage approach to splitting the portage tree into kits. This should tie software updates together and help with the dependency problems of a rolling release distribution. Kits also are gaining maturity status as they are tested and as patches are applied. Git Funtoo uses Git to store the Portage tree. The tree is split into kits now with meta-repo being the repo holding all the kits as submodules. Metro Metro is an automatable software package for building stages used in installing Funtoo. boot-update boot-update provides a unified mechanism for configuring the GNU GRUB2 and GRUB Legacy boot loader versions. Core networking Funtoo has its own core networking solution to allow users to simplify the creation of complex network interfaces based on pre- created profiles. Kernel Since May 2015 Funtoo offers a pre-build generic kernel with stage3 Although Funtoo is a source-based distribution, it should be possible to use a prebuilt Linux kernel. Funtoo no longer encourages the use of the Sabayon kernel; however, with many improvements to Funtoo's design and init process, one should be able to load a binary kernel plus initrd from a preferred distribution hosting a precompiled/preconfigured kernel. Ubuntu's kernel linux-3.2.0-17-generic has been tested and is known to work. This can benefit those who like to avoid building custom kernels. Using a generic kernel from another distribution should be straightforward if using boot-update.  Other differences  There are multitude of users blog posts or discussions about difference between Gentoo and Funtoo. The most marked difference between the two would be no systemd support in Funtoo, but still delivering for example a working Gnome desktop without the systemd need.  Incognito   Nova   Pentoo   Sabayon Linux   Redcore Linux   Tin Hat Linux  Tin Hat is a Security-focused Linux distribution derived from Hardened Gentoo Linux. It aims to provide a very secure, stable, and fast desktop environment that lives purely in RAM. Tin Hat boots from CD, or optionally from USB flash drive, but it does not mount any file system directly from the boot device. Instead, Tin Hat employs a large SquashFS image from the boot device which expands into tmpfs upon booting. This makes for long boot times, but fast speeds during use. = Design goal = The central design consideration in Tin Hat is to construct an operating system that can hide data from an attacker even if he has physical access to the computer. Physical access to a computer with unencrypted filesystems does not secure the data and an attacker could easily retrieve the data. Encrypting the filesystem provides protection from such an attack, but many implementations of encryption do not hide the fact that data is encrypted on the filesystem. For example, the LUKS encryption system includes metadata which detail the block cipher and block cipher mode used in encryption. This information does not help the attacker decrypt the filesystem, but it does reveal that it contains encrypted data and not random data. However, Tin Hat stores its filesystem in the RAM, leaving no data in the computer's hard drive. If the user stores any data via a more permanent means than RAM, the encrypted data is indiscernible from random data. Tin Hat's preferred method of encryption is via loop-aes v3. Beyond these considerations, Tin Hat has to also protect against more common exploits based on networking or security holes in software. The hardening model chosen is PaX/Grsecurity which is already provided by the Hardened Gentoo project. Hardening of the kernel and the toolchain make most code born exploits less likely. A non-modular compiled kernel further frustrates the insertion of malicious kernel modules. =References= This article uses content from this page, where it is licensed under the GNU General Public License.

It depicts a cow standing in front of a table of bizarre, misshapen implements with the caption \\"Cow tools.\\" The cartoon confused many readers, who wrote or phoned in seeking an explanation of the joke. In response to the controversy, Larson issued a press release clarifying that the thrust of the cartoon was simply that, if a cow were to make tools, they would \\"lack something in sophistication.\\" It has been described as \\"the most loathed Far Side strip ever.\\"  Description  The single panel cartoon depicts a bull standing on its hindquarters at a table, on which are placed four oddly- shaped objects. One object resembles a crude hand saw. The caption simply reads \\"Cow tools.\\"  Reactions  Immediately upon the cartoon's publication, Chronicle Features, which syndicated The Far Side, was inundated with queries from readers and newspaper editors seeking an explanation of the cartoon. According to the general manager of Chronicle Features, \\"the phone never stopped ringing for two days.\\" Larson himself received hundreds of letters about \\"Cow Tools,\\" some of which were reprinted in the 1989 anthology The Prehistory of The Far Side. In one letter, a reader from Texas wrote that they had shown the cartoon to \\"40-odd professionals with doctoral degrees,\\" and none could understand it. Reflecting on the cartoon's reception, Larson suggested he had erred in making one of the tools resemble a saw, which misled many readers into believing that to understand the cartoon's message, they needed to decipher the identities of the other three tools.  Explanation  Larson took the unusual step of issuing a press release, explaining the joke and apologizing for the confusion caused: > The cartoon was intended to be an exercise in silliness. While I have never > met a cow who could make tools, I felt sure that if I did, they (the tools) > would lack something in sophistication and resemble the sorry specimens > shown in this cartoon.

The mission of the DCARNG Honor Guard is to provide military funeral honors (MFH) to qualifying veterans and participate in ceremonial and special events. Based on the mission and support needed, selected members of the Air National Guard's Honor Guard program are required to work jointly with the DCARNG to support missions that fall under the DCNG as a whole. The DCARNG Honor Guard program is assigned to the District of Columbia National Guard (DCNG) Joint Force Headquarters (JFHQ) Command. Overview DCARNG Honor Guardsmen display US Flag, May 27, 2019, during Memorial Day ceremony. (photo: SFC Ron Lee, DCNG) The DCNG is a joint command. It has both DCARNG (Army) and Air National Guard (DCANG) components. Both Guard components have an Honor Guard program established to support its members. When directed by the Commanding General of the DCNG, both Guardsmen and Airmen Honor Guard components perform jointly to support required missions. The DCARNG Honor Guard program serve several purposes. One is to provide MFH support for fallen Soldiers/Airmen, while the other is to participate in national ceremonies and special events when requested by the Commanding General of the DCNG. The Department of Defense (DoD) is the authority for ensuring all branches of the military services, provide MFH support to eligible veterans. DoD releases the guidelines and policies for all branches of the military to follow when providing military funeral honors. DoD policies state that, at minimum, MFH support will consist of two uniformed service members. One service member will administer the playing of \\"Taps\\", while the other present the US flag to family members. The DCARNG Honor Guard program follows the traditional protocol when presenting or bearing the US flag during selected ceremonies and events, such as the Fourth of July, Veteran's Day, or Memorial Day. The US flag is also displayed during official district/municipal or federal functions. The picture above depicts the DCARNG Honor Guard members presenting the US flag during a Memorial Day ceremony held on May 27, 2019. The ceremony was in support of the US Army, 1st Infantry Division and was held on the grounds of the White House, in President's Park. History DCARNG Honor Guard members practicing for a ceremony in front of the DC armory during the 1940s. The DCARNG Honor Guard, along with other branches of the military, has been providing honor and military funeral support to its members as far back as 1899. In 1899, President William McKinley gave full military honors to 336 Soldiers that died in the Spanish-American war. On April 6, 1899, the military escorts for this funeral procession included artillery and cavalry troops from the Washington barracks in Fort Myer, Virginia, a Marine Battalion from the Navy Yard in DC., and the entire District of Columbia Army National Guard. During the procession, each casket included eight pallbearers. At the gravesite, \\"Taps\\" was played, and a three-volley salute was fired. The deceased Soldiers were buried in Arlington National Cemetery. During the 1940s, the DCNG recruited members from various units to participate in performing the Honor Guard protocol. In the picture to the right, five members of the DCARNG, are shown practicing ceremonial flag carry in front of the DCNG armory, located in Washington, DC. The DCNG Honor Guardsmen and Airmen are the only Guard components in the history of the US to fall under the direct Command and Control of the President of the United States. Although the use of the Honor Guard has been delegated to the Secretary of the Army, and then to the Commanding General of the DCNG. Though these authorities, the DCNG is able to support requests from the DC mayor's office and other agencies within the District of Columbia, such as the DC Metropolitan Police Department. Upon the death of US citizens that are considered distinguished and have made significant contributions to the US, Congress approves the use of the US Capitol Rotunda for viewing and tribute by the public. In August 2005, US Congresswomen, Eleanor Holmes-Norton (House of Representatives, District of Columbia) secured the use of the DCNG Honor Guard for use in the \\"lay-in- honor\\" viewing of Rosa Parks. Rosa Parks was the catalyst that changed the efforts of the civil rights movement during the 1960s. Eleanor Holmes-Norton also requested the support of the DCNG Honor Guard components for another prominent US citizen, Dorothy Irene Height. Ms. Height's funeral service was held at the US National Cathedral in Washington, DC. on April 29, 2010. Ms. Height was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal by previous President George W. Bush in 2004, the Presidential Medal of Freedom by previous President Bill Clinton in 1994 and was known for her contributions as a civil rights leader.

The DCARNG uses a full-time technician, an Honor Guard NCOIC (Non-commissioned officer in charge), and a team leader to implement its Honor Guard program. Members of the Honor Guard are all volunteers from all ranks. The volunteers are solicited from different commands under the 74th Troop Command such as the 372nd Military Police (MP) Battalion, the different MP companies, 547th Transportation Company, and the 104th Maintenance Company within the DCARNG.

He joined the cartel in the late 1990s and was a trusted enforcer of kingpin Jorge Eduardo Costilla S√°nchez. Barrag√°n Balderas was the regional boss of Miguel Alem√°n and helped coordinate international drug trafficking shipments from South and Central America to Mexico and the U.S. His role in the cartel also included providing them with information on the movement and location of Mexican security forces to ensure safe passage of their cocaine and marijuana shipments. In 2008, an indictment issued by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia detailing his criminal activities was unsealed in court. In 2009, the U.S. Department of State and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) issued a US$5 million bounty for information leading to his arrest and/or conviction. In 2010, the U.S. Department of the Treasury sanctioned Barrag√°n Balderas under the Kingpin Act. Barrag√°n Balderas was arrested by the Mexican Federal Police at a ranch in Reynosa in 2011 while he celebrated his birthday. He was imprisoned at the Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 1, a maximum-security prison in the State of Mexico. In 2020, he was extradited to the U.S. for his outstanding drug trafficking charges. Early life and background Gilberto Barrag√°n Balderas was born in Miguel Alem√°n, Tamaulipas, Mexico, on 19 May 1970. He is related to Manuel Balderas Ram√≠rez, who served as the mayor of Miguel Alem√°n Municipality from 1990 to 1992. According to information from the Secretariat of Public Security (SSP), Barrag√°n Balderas joined the Gulf Cartel, a criminal group based in Tamaulipas, Mexico, in the late 1990s when former kingpin Osiel C√°rdenas Guill√©n became its leader. In the cartel he was the regional boss of Miguel Alem√°n, which is across the U.S.-Mexico border from Roma, Texas, located in an area known as La Frontera Chica. He coordinated international drug trafficking shipments for the cartel from there. He was a close collaborator of former kingpin Jorge Eduardo Costilla S√°nchez. In the Gulf Cartel, he worked under a faction known as Los Metros. His code name was \\"Metro 18\\" (\\"M-18\\"). Like Barrag√°n Balderas, Los Metros were loyalist to Costilla S√°nchez. According to his U.S. Department of State (DOS) criminal profile, Barrag√°n Balderas goes by his aliases \\"Heriberto\\" and \\"Tocayo\\", is tall and weighs . He has black hair and brown-colored eyes. The DOS's Narcotics Rewards Program is offering up to US$5 million for information that leads to his arrest and/or conviction. In conjunction with the DOS, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) listed him among the top ten most-wanted Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas members in 2009. This list was made up with information compiled from the DEA's Dallas jurisdiction. The total reward for Barrag√°n Balderas and his collaborators was up to US$50 million. He was later moved to the most-wanted fugitives list of the DEA's Houston jurisdiction.  Career and indictments According to a sealed indictment sworn in by a grand jury of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (D.D.C.) on 15 November 2007, on or around June 2006, Barrag√°n Balderas and other members of the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas conspired with intent to distribute at least of cocaine and of marijuana from Mexico, Colombia and elsewhere into the U.S. In addition, the D.D.C. stated that in November 2007, Barrag√°n Balderas was charged with conspiring with intent to distribute at least of cocaine. For these two counts, Barrag√°n Balderas was ordered to forfeit all money and properties derived from the sale of these drugs, as well as any properties used to facilitate his operations. If such properties could not be located, were sold or transferred to a third-party, and/or largely diminished in value, Barrag√°n Balderas was ordered to forfeit other assets to make up for the total amount of said property. This indictment was unsealed in court on 12 March 2008. In a superseding indictment issued by the D.D.C. on 15 May 2009, Barrag√°n Balderas was charged with more international drug charges. The prosecution also added more details of his criminal activities. Concerning the cocaine trafficking charges against him in the previous indictment, the prosecution specified that the cocaine shipments came from Colombia, Guatemala, Panama, Mexico and elsewhere before they reached the U.S. They also stated that he was responsible for coordinating cash smuggling activities from the U.S. to Mexico, and referred to his criminal organization as La Compa√±√≠a (English: The Company), a name that collectively referred to the co- organization of the Gulf Cartel and its former paramilitary group, Los Zetas. They also charged him with providing his criminal group with information on law enforcement operations directed against them. The information included the movement and checkpoints erected by the Mexican Armed Forces, the Federal Police (PF) and the Tamaulipas State Police to prevent disruption of their marijuana and cocaine shipments.

They talked about who was responsible for the seizure and how the merchandise was to be recovered. In a phone conversation on or around 18 February 2008, Barrag√°n Balderas and Flores Borrego discussed two cocaine deals. In their first conversation, they discussed a cocaine shipment. In their second conversation, they talked about the distribution of of cocaine from McAllen, Texas, to Tennessee. According to the indictment, Barrag√°n Balderas expected a payout of US$23,000 for each kilogram sold. About a month later, on 4 March 2008, Barrag√°n Balderas and Flores Borrego discussed a marijuana handover of intended for four suspects. of marijuana were given to Jaime Gonz√°lez Dur√°n, another high-ranking member of La Compa√±√≠a. Barrag√°n Balderas and Flores Borrego discussed storing the marijuana with Juan Reyes Mejia-Gonz√°lez and other unnamed suspects. The U.S. government again ordered Barrag√°n Balderas to forfeit his earnings from these drug transactions or forfeit other assets to make up the total value. In a D.D.C. superseding indictment sworn in by a grand jury on 7 May 2012 and unsealed in court on 9 May 2013, U.S. authorities detailed more information on his drug trafficking activities. They stated that in or around 2000 and up to February 2010, Barrag√°n Balderas and other of his colleagues manufactured and intended to distribute or more of cocaine from Colombia, Guatemala, Panama, Mexico and elsewhere into the U.S. They also charged him with intending to distribute of marijuana from Mexico to the U.S. The U.S. government again ordered Barrag√°n Balderas to forfeit his drug proceeds or other assets equivalent to the total value he made from these drug deals. According to the former PF chief Ram√≥n Eduardo Peque√±o Garc√≠a, Barrag√°n Balderas was responsible for commanding Gulf Cartel cells in Tamaulipas to fight off rival cells from Los Zetas (though previously together, both groups broke ties in 2010). On 6 February 2011, Barrag√°n Balderas's henchmen reportedly mutilated five alleged Zetas' members bodies and dumped them beside a highway in Los Ramones. They were piled together on public display. The victims were tortured before being killed (as shown by their visible torture wounds and duct tape covering their eyes). They were then beheaded and mutilated; their torsos, arms and legs were chopped off. Their assassins left a banner reportedly signed by Barrag√°n Balderas. In its message, Barrag√°n Balderas taunted Los Zetas leader Jes√∫s Enrique Rej√≥n Aguilar's (\\"El Mamito\\") attempt to send his forces to the Gulf Cartel's turf. \\"Keep on sending more idiots like these,\\" the banner read. = Economic sanctions = On 24 March 2010, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), a branch of the United States Department of the Treasury, sanctioned 54 high- ranking members of the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas, including Barrag√°n Balderas, under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (Kingpin Act). This sanction was made after U.S. and Mexican officials met in Mexico City the day before as part of the M√©rida Initiative. It also included the support of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and their special operations team, which assisted the OFAC in identifying the designated suspects. The list of designated suspects included drug traffickers, money launders, hitmen, and enforcers. Several of them controlled drug trafficking operations in Tamaulipas, Nuevo Le√≥n, and other parts of Mexico, and had previous drug charges in the U.S. As part of the sanction, the U.S. government prohibited U.S. citizens from engaging in business activities with Barrag√°n Balderas and froze all of his U.S.-based assets; this was done to reduce his financial support to the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas and prevent him from having access to the international financial sector. Corporate officers could face up to US$5 million in fines and up to 30 years in prison for violations of these provisions.  Arrest  On 20 May 2011, the PF arrested Barrag√°n Balderas while he celebrated his birthday at a ranch on the outskirts of Reynosa, alongside a highway that led to Miguel Alem√°n. Authorities were tipped off that he was planning to attend a birthday party along with other high-ranking cartel members. When they confirmed his location, they proceeded to the place to apprehend him. No shots were fired during this operation. He was arrested with two of his accomplices‚ÄîRomeo Eduardo Mej√≠a Gonz√°lez and Sergio Guti√©rrez Casta√±√≥n. At the scene, security forces seized a Chevrolet vehicle with U.S. license plates, an AR-15 rifle with two supplied magazines, and a .357 Glock pistol and two .9 mm handguns with supplied magazines. Reynosa residents reported on Twitter that there was gunfire and heavy law enforcement presence in neighborhoods southwest of the city. The PF presented Barrag√°n Balderas to the media at their offices in Mexico City, and explained the charges and investigations he faced to national press. The PF confirmed that the detainees were handed over to the Subprocuradur√≠a de Investigaci√≥n Especializada en Delincuencia Organizada (SIEDO), Mexico's organized crime investigation agency. He gave his legal declaration at the SIEDO offices on the day of his arrest. Authorities confirmed that the SIEDO had 48 hours to determine his legal status, though they could request more time to gather more evidence against him. On 26 May, a federal penal judge ordered Barrag√°n Balderas to remain under SIEDO custody for 40 days. This was granted after the SIEDO presented evidence to the judge that Barrag√°n Balderas was wanted for his suspected participation in drug trafficking (including drug possession), organized crime involvement and illegal possession of military-exclusive firearms. The SIEDO continued to gather more evidence against him. He was kept at the Federal Investigation Center (CIF) of the Attorney General's Office (PGR) in Colonia Doctores during this 40-day period. On 14 July 2011, Barrag√°n Balderas was transferred to the Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 1 (\\"Altiplano\\"), a maximum-security prison in the State of Mexico, after a judge issued an arrest warrant for his formal transfer to a penitentiary. The judge considered the charges he faced were sufficient to order his imprisonment. Federal authorities confirmed that Barrag√°n Balderas's accomplices were also sent to Altiplano.  Extradition  On 13 January 2020, Barrag√°n Balderas was extradited from Mexico to the U.S. along with seven other suspected drug traffickers from the Gulf Cartel, Los Zetas and the Ju√°rez Cartel to face his outstanding drug trafficking charges. At the time of his extradition, per Article 12 of the National Code of Criminal Procedures (CNPP), he was considered innocent until proven guilty through due process.
