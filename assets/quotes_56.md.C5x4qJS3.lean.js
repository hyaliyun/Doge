Early life and education Lowson was born at Snitterfield House, Warwickshire,1911 England Census the third child and second son of James Gray Flowerdew Lowson, a Scottish paper manufacturer, and Adelaide Louisa Scott. His mother was born in British India, the daughter of Col. Courtenay Harvey Saltren Scott of the Bengal Staff Corps, who was born in Dublin, Ireland, and Margaret Julia Colquhoun, a novelist.India, Select Births and Baptisms, 1786‚Äì1947 Lowson's elder brother, Courtenay Patrick Flowerdew Lowson (1897‚Äì1917), was killed in action in the First World War. His sister, Eleanor, married Maj.-Gen. William Revell Revell-Smith. He was educated at Winchester College and Christ Church, Oxford. Career In 1930, was admitted as a barrister to Inner Temple. He gained prestige as a financier, specialising in unit trusts, and in the 1940s took control of the National Group of Unit Trusts. According to The Times, Lowson \\"showed consistently that he was more concerned to turn situations to the advantage of himself and the interests he controlled than with his fiduciary duty to the companies of which he was a director.\\" Lowson served as Sheriff of the City of London (1939‚Äì40), Alderman of London (1942‚Äì73) and Lord Mayor of London (1950‚Äì51). Lowson, then 44, became the youngest modern Lord Mayor upon his election. He was also High Steward of Stratford-upon-Avon in 1952 and Governor of the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon. He was also a Freeman of the City of London.London, England, Freedom of the City Admission Papers, 1681‚Äì1930 Lowson held a number of positions of influence in various organisations, including as governor of hospitals, a Master of livery companies and president and vice- president of multiple national and Commonwealth organisations. He was created a Baronet Lowson, of Westlaws, County Perth on 27 June 1951. Financial troubles and death In July 1974, the Investors Chronicle published an expos√© on Lowson, in which it revealed his financial empire was a \\"tangle of cross shareholdings, based on some 100 trading and industrial companies throughout the world, owned and controlled, at the end, through 14 often interrelated investment trusts.\\" It was revealed that in 1972, Sir Denys bought shares of the National Group, which he controlled, for just 62 pence each and resold them within months for ¬£8.67 each, for an estimated personal profit of ¬£5 million. After an investigation requested by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, inspectors accused Sir Denys of \\"grave mismanagement\\" of his companies \\"to obtain very substantial gain for himself and his family.\\" Sir Denys apologised and promised to make substantial repayments, while his legal counsel blamed his mistakes on \\"age, ill-health, obstinacy and secretiveness rather than to any intent to deceive\\" ‚Äî an explanation rejected by inspectors. Within a few weeks, Lowson retired from executive positions in his various companies and trusts. His health rapidly declining, Sir Denys went on an extended cruise on the Queen Elizabeth 2. He died the following year in Marylebone, London, aged 69. He was buried at Kinfauns Parish Churchyard in Kinfauns, Perth and Kinross, Scotland. Following Lowson's death, Philip Inman, 1st Baron Inman wrote to The Times: Family On 17 July 1936, Lowson married Hon. Ann Patricia Macpherson, daughter of Ian Macpherson, 1st Baron Strathcarron. They had three children: *Sir Ian Patrick Lowson, 2nd Baronet (born 4 September 1944) *Gay Ann Lowson, Countess of Kinnoull (1938‚Äì2016), married the 15th Earl of Kinnoull *Melanie Fiona Louisa Lowson (born 1940), married Charles Archibald Adam Black Lady Lowson died in 2003.

Proponents of the term animal‚Äìindustrial complex claim that activities described by the term differ from individual acts of animal cruelty in that they constitute institutionalized animal exploitation. Definitions The term animal‚Äìindustrial complex was coined by the Dutch cultural anthropologist and philosopher Barbara Noske in her 1989 book Humans and Other Animals, saying that animals \\"have become reduced to mere appendages of computers and machines.\\" The term relates the practices, organizations, and overall industry that turns animals into food and other commodities to the military‚Äìindustrial complex. Richard Twine later refined the concept, regarding it as the \\"partly opaque and multiple set of networks and relationships between the corporate (agricultural) sector, governments, and public and private science. With economic, cultural, social and affective dimensions it encompasses an extensive range of practices, technologies, images, identities and markets.\\" Twine also discusses the overlap between the AIC and other similar complexes, such as the prison‚Äìindustrial complex. Origin and properties of the complex According to Kim Stallwood, the animal‚Äìindustrial complex is \\"an integral part of the neoliberal, transnational order of increasing privatization and decreasing government intervention, favouring transnational corporations and global capital.\\" According to Stallwood, two milestones mark the shift in human attitudes toward animals that empowered the animal‚Äìindustrial complex, namely, Chicago and its stockyards and slaughterhouses from 1865 and the post-World War II developments such as intensive factory farms, industrial fishing, and xenotransplantation. According to Stallwood, the animal‚Äìindustrial complex breeds animals in the billions in order to make products and services for human consumption, and all these animals are considered legal property of the animal‚Äìindustrial complex. The animal‚Äìindustrial complex is said to have transformed the already confused relationship between human and non-human animals, significantly increasing the consumption and threatening human survival, and the pervasive nature of the animal‚Äìindustrial complex is such that it evades attention. Sociologist David Nibert argues that while it has its origins in the use of animals during the establishment of agricultural societies, the animal-industrial complex is ultimately \\"a predictable, insidious outgrowth of the capitalist system with its penchant for continuous expansion\\". According to Nibert, this complex is so destructive in its pursuit of resources such as land and water to rear all of these animals as a source of profit that it warrants comparisons to Atilla the Hun. As the human population grows to a projected 9 billion by the middle of the century, meat production is expected to increase by 40%. Nibert further states, Contributors to the 2013 book Animals and War, which linked critical animal studies and critical peace studies, explored the connections between the animal-industrial complex and the military-industrial complex, proposing and analysing the idea of a military-animal industrial complex. The exploitation of animals, argues Colin Salter, is not necessary to military- industrial complexes, but it is a foundational and central element of the military-industrial complex as it actually exists. One of the aims of the book as a whole was to argue for the abolition of the military-animal industrial complex and all wars.

Returning to the United Kingdom for schooling, Colquhorn was educated at Campbell College and Glenalmond College, playing cricket for the latters school team from 1909 to 1912. He played first-class cricket in June 1914, when he played for GJV Weigall's XI against Oxford University at Oxford. Opening the batting in both innings', Colquhoun was dismissed for 15 runs in the first-innings by Orme Bristowe, and for the same score in their second- innings by Donald Johnston. He served during World War I with the Highland Light Infantry, enlisting in 1914 with the rank of second lieutenant. He was promoted to temporary lieutenant in May 1916. He transferred to the Durham Light Infantry in 1917, where he supervised physical and bayonet training. He remained with the Durham Light Infantry following the war and by June 1919 he held the rank of temporary captain, which he relinquished with the cessation of his supervisory duties and military service in 1919. He later played minor counties cricket for Cornwall in 1929 and 1930, making six appearances in the Minor Counties Championship. He was later made an MBE.

It is a trapezoidal flat mountain rising 1,500 metres above the seafloor to a depth of less than 1,500 m, with a summit platform 35 by 70 kilometres wide. The Mid-Pacific Mountains lie west of Hawaii and northeast of the Marshall Islands, but at the time of their formation were located in the Southern Hemisphere. The tablemount was probably formed by a hotspot in the present-day Southern Pacific before plate tectonics moved it to its current location. Several hotspots, including the Easter, Marquesas and Society hotspots, may have been involved in the formation of the Mid-Pacific Mountains. Volcanic activity is dated to have occurred circa 111‚Äì85 million years ago and formed a volcanic island. Subsequently, carbonate deposition commenced as Allison Guyot subsided and eventually buried the island, forming an atoll-like structure and a carbonate platform. Among other animals, crocodilians lived on Allison Guyot. The platform emerged above sea level during the Albian and Turonian ages. It drowned about 99 ¬± 2 million years ago for unknown reasons; possibly a phase of renewed emergence damaged the reefs, or it was located in unfavourable waters. Later, pelagic sedimentation commenced on the seamount and led to the deposition of sediments including limestone, ooze and sand, which bear traces of climatic events and ocean currents.  Name and research history  Allison Guyot is named after E.C. Allison, an oceanographer and paleontologist at the San Diego State College; formerly it was named \\"Navoceano Guyot\\". The name \\"Hamilton Guyot\\" has also been applied to Allison Guyot but is not correct; Hamilton Guyot is a separate formation in the Mid-Pacific Mountains. The seamount is the source of the Ocean Drilling Program drill core 865A, which was bored into the summit platform of Allison Guyot in 1992 but did not reach the volcanic structure of the underwater mountain. Two other cores 865C and 865B were obtained during the same operation; Allison Guyot is Site 865 Ocean Drilling Program. These drill cores were part of a larger project to investigate and clarify the history of the flat-topped submarine mountains in the Pacific Ocean.  Geography and geology  = Local setting = Allison Guyot is located in the equatorial Pacific Ocean, part of the western Mid- Pacific Mountains. The Mid-Pacific Mountains contain seamounts which were covered by limestones during the Barremian and Albian (circa 129.4 ‚Äì circa 125 million years ago and circa 113‚Äì100.5 million years ago, respectively). Hawaii lies due east and the Marshall Islands southwest; Resolution Guyot is 716 kilometres northwest. The guyot (also known as tablemount) has an outline resembling a trapezoid and consists of two connected volcanic ridges facing north-northwest to east-northeast. Its western parts may be a distinct volcano. The surface platform has dimensions of 35 by 70 kilometres, with an upwards-doming form 0.3‚Äì0.5 kilometres high, and is covered by large sediment mounds; the rim surrounding the platform lies at a depth of about 1,650 metres and there is evidence of former reefs. The structure appears to consist of lagoonal sediments surrounded by a reef, and the shallowest point of Allison Guyot lies at less than depth below sea level. Volcanic cones dot the eastern side of the summit plateau. The seamount bears traces of slumping, which on the southeastern side of Allison Guyot has removed part of the platform perimeter. The seamount rises 1.5 kilometres above the seafloor. Underneath Allison Guyot, the seafloor is about 130‚Äì119 million years old, and a 128-million year-old magnetic lineation is located nearby. The Molokai Fracture Zone forms a ridge which passes close to Allison Guyot and intersects with another ridge at the seamount. Tectonically the seamount is part of the Pacific Plate. = Regional setting = Diagram showing a cross section through the Earth's alt=Diagram of how an active volcano is accompanied by decaying inactive volcanoes that were formerly located on the hotspot but have been moved away The west central and south central Pacific Ocean seafloor contains many guyots of the Mesozoic age that developed in seas shallower than typical of the present-day ocean. These are submarine mountains which are characterised by a flat top and usually the presence of carbonate platforms that rose above the sea surface during the middle Cretaceous period. Many of these seamounts were formerly atolls, though there are some differences to present-day reef systems. All these structures originally formed as volcanoes in the Mesozoic ocean. The crust underneath these volcanoes tends to subside as it cools, and thus the islands and seamounts sink. Fringing reefs may have developed on the volcanoes, which then became barrier reefs as the volcanoes subside and turn into atolls; these rims surround lagoons or tidal flats. Continued subsidence offset by growth of the reefs led to the formation of thick carbonate platforms. Sometimes volcanic activity continued after the formation of the atoll or atoll-like structure, and during episodes where the platforms rose above sea level erosional features such as channels and blue holes developed. Eventually, these platforms drowned for reasons that are often unclear. The formation of many such seamounts has been explained with the hotspot theory, which describes the formation of chains of volcanoes that get progressively older along the length of the chain, with an active volcano only at one end of the system. This volcano lies on a spot of the lithosphere heated from below; as the plate moves the volcano is moved away from the heat source and volcanic activity ceases, producing a chain of volcanoes that become older away from the currently active one. The \\"South Pacific Superswell\\" is a region in the Southern Pacific at the present-day Austral Islands, Cook Islands and Society Islands, where intense volcanic activity was underway during the Cretaceous, and is where the Cretaceous seamounts of the Mid-Pacific Mountains originated. The Easter hotspot, Marquesas hotspot and the Society hotspot may have been involved in the formation of the Mid-Pacific Mountains. After the Mountains had formed, plate tectonics shifted them northwards to their present-day position. Allison Guyot appears to have formed in the same region. = Composition = One drill core on Allison Guyot has found a 136-metre-thick layer of pelagic sediments, under which are 735-metre- thick limestones that formed in lagoons and might continue down for almost 600 metres. The limestone consists mostly of calcite with little dolomite and occurs in the form of bafflestone, grainstone, packstone, peloid, rudstone and wackestone; ooliths have also been found. The carbonates are of biogenic origin, and fossils of dasyclads, echinoderms, gastropods, green algae, molluscs, ostracods, oysters, red algae, rudists and sponges occur within the limestones; some of the fossils have partially dissolved and are thus poorly preserved. Remnants of crocodilians have been found within Aptian‚ÄìAlbian mudstones, together with fossils of fish and unidentified vertebrates. The limestone is partly altered by karstification and phosphatisation, and manganese has accumulated in the upper layers. Basalts occur in the form of cobbles and sills within the limestones. These basalts define an alkali basalt suite and contain clinopyroxene, feldspar, ilmenite, plagioclase, pyroxene, spinel and titanomagnetite. They probably also contained olivine but the basaltic rocks sampled are so heavily altered that no olivine is left. The basalts are typical of intraplate volcanism and their geochemistry shows evidence that fractional crystallisation and mixing between different magmas were involved in their genesis. The component minerals have often been completely altered to calcite, clays, gypsum, hematite, quartz and other, unidentified minerals, either when exposed above sea level or through hydrothermal fluids when the sills formed. The formation of the sills led to the hardening and hydrothermal alteration of the surrounding sediments. Clays are found both within the limestones and in layers between the carbonates. They consist of berthierine, chlorite, feldspar, hydromica, illite, kaolinite, mica, quartz, serpentine, smectite and possible zeolite. The clays were in part derived from lateritic soils that developed on the volcanic island before they were completely buried in carbonates, and in part formed in settings with limited water exchange during lagoonal stages. Dolomite, gypsum and pyrite co- occur with some clays, and claystones have been found in some places. Mudstones with evidence of animal burrows and containing amber, glauconite, organic material including plant debris and pyrite have also been encountered; pyrite indicates that anoxic environments existed on Allison Guyot. Black shale and coal form layers in one drill core. The lower limestones contain substantial amounts of organic material that originated from terrestrial settings, and remnants of animal burrows and plant roots have been found in many layers of the platform. The clays and mudstones are rich in organic material. Most of this organic material appears to come from plants but some material has been attributed to algae. Cells and tracheids can be found in the plant remnants.  Geological history  alt=Light blue circle (a reef) with green splotches (islands) is surrounded by deep blue (the ocean) and surrounds deep blue (the lagoon) Radiometric dating has been performed on some of the volcanic rocks. Potassium‚Äìargon dating on the sills has yielded ages of 102 ¬± 6 million years ago and 87 ¬± 3 million years ago, while argon‚Äìargon dating also on the sills produced ages of 111.1 ¬± 2.6 million years, 111.2 ¬± 1.2 million years ago and 104.8 ¬± 0.8 million years ago. Other ages from the sills are about 110.7 ¬± 1.2 million years ago and 104.9 ¬± 2.0 million years ago. Rocks dredged from the slopes of Allison Guyot have yielded ages of 101.2 ¬± 0.8 million years, 102.7 ¬± 2.7 million years and 85.6 ¬± 1.3 million years ago. Overall, the volcano is considered to be at least 111 million years old and volcanic activity probably spanned 30‚Äì25 million years and several stages. Both the sills and the dredged rocks were probably erupted after the main shield stage and they may constitute a late stage of secondary volcanism; two or three separate stages might have taken place, including one which formed a secondary cone on the eastern side of Allison Guyot. This may indicate that the seamount passed over more than one hotspot. The volcano of Allison Guyot was apparently already partially eroded when the secondary volcanism took place. Paleomagnetic data taken from limestones show that Allison Guyot developed in the Southern Hemisphere, at a latitude of about 11.2¬∞ ¬± 2.0¬∞ south. = Emergent phase = Aerial image of the rim of alt=Dark green land with the deep blue sea behind and a ligher blue lagoon in the foreground; the lagoon has isolated reefs visible through its water Allison Guyot began as a volcanic island with a relief of perhaps 1.3 kilometres. Located in equatorial waters suited to the deposition of carbonate platforms, limestone platform grew on the guyot as it rapidly subsided during the Albian. Eventually, the seamount became an atoll. Volcanic rocks cropped out for some time before they were buried into the carbonates, and weathering products of the volcanic rocks accumulated in the limestones. The islands were covered by vegetation, and vegetation cover decreased over time as the volcanic edifice sank. The climate was probably humid and runoff was intense. The platform contains lagoon and swamp environments, with water depths not exceeding 10 metres, and at some stage contained sand shoals and islands formed by storms as well. The interior was not protected from the sea and the sector of the platform that was investigated by drill cores apparently became increasingly accessible to it over time. The inner platform had a quiet muddy water setting; generally Allison Guyot at that time resembled the present-day Bikini and Eniwetok atolls in terms of morphology when Allison Guyot was emergent. The carbonate deposits indicate sea level changes following orbital cycles consistent with Milankovitch forcing; parts of the platform occasionally rose above sea level. At some point, karst environments existed on Allison Guyot and are probably the reason for the irregular surface of the summit platform and the presence of sinkholes; there are clear indications of about 200 metres of emergence. Bivalves including rudists, corals, echinoderms, foraminifera, green algae, hydrozoans, red algae and sponges have been found in the platform's deposits. Rudists were at that time important reef builders and together with sponges colonised the margin of the platform. Among the rudist species discovered on Allison Guyot is Requienia cf. migliorinii. Teeth of crocodilians have been found on the seamount. Its 110 million years old remnants are the oldest known crocodilians in the region of the Pacific Ocean. They indicate that such species lived within the lagoon of Allison Guyot and may give clues about the history of Pacific animals and their dispersal. = Drowning and post-drowning evolution = A carbonate platform is said to 'drown' when sedimentation can no longer keep up with relative rises in sea level. Carbonate sedimentation on Allison Guyot ended during late Albian times, about 99 ¬± 2 million years ago, at the same time as at Resolution Guyot. By Turonian times (93.9 ‚Äì 89.8 ¬± 0.3 million years ago), pelagic sedimentation was prevailing on Allison Guyot. On both Allison and Resolution Guyots, the drowning was preceded by an episode where the platform rose above the sea; possibly it was this emergence and the following submergence which terminated carbonate deposition and prevented it from beginning again. Such emergence and drowning has been recorded at carbonate platforms of that age around the world and may be the consequence of tectonic events across the Pacific Ocean, culminating in the uplift of a part thereof. At that time, a last phase of volcanic activity on Allison Guyot generated several cones on its eastern part. The evidence for this theory is not conclusive, and another theory holds that the drowning of Allison Guyot occurred when it moved through equatorial waters, where upwelling increased the amount of nutrients available, hampering the growth of platforms. The waters might also have been too hot to support the survival of reef builders, as happens in present-day coral bleaching events. About 160 metres of pelagic sediment in the form of sand, ooze and pelagic limestone accumulated on Allison Guyot; pelagic limestone is of Turonian to Campanian (83.6 ¬± 0.2 ‚àí 72.1 ¬± 0.2 million years ago) age while the oozes and sands were deposited starting in the early Paleocene (66‚Äì56 million years ago). In drill cores, the ooze has a sandy, watery habitus owing to the prevalence of fossil foraminifera in the sediment. The pelagic sediments have been bioturbated in some places and modified by sea currents, which have formed the large mound of pelagic sediment. In drill cores, the ooze overlies Cretaceous shallow-water limestones, which were modified by phosphatisation and manganese accumulation. As plate tectonics moved Allison Guyot northward, its surrounding water masses changed, as did the properties of the pelagic cap. Slumping of the platform occurred during the Cenozoic (the last 66 million years). The pelagic ooze bears evidence of the Paleocene‚ÄìEocene thermal maximum, including temporary dissolution of carbonates, changes in the isotope ratios of carbon in sediments on Allison Guyot and changes in foraminifera and ostracod fossils found in the ooze. The latter underwent a major extinction during the Paleocene‚ÄìEocene Thermal Maximum on the seamount and took a long time to recover. Sea currents have altered the pelagic deposits by removing smaller particles. In particular deposits from warmer periods have been altered in this way on Allison Guyot, perhaps because warmer climates increased hurricane activity and thus the energy available in sea currents or deep-sea circulations shifted. Furthermore, pauses in the sedimentation or episodes of slowdown have been identified.

Thanks to study trips to the United States, she was a pioneer of visual pedagogy in Denmark, publishing Anskuelsesundervisning, Haandbog for L√¶rere (Visual Instruction: a Handbook for Teachers) in 1889. She was also an active contributor to the women's movement, chairing the Women Readers' Association from 1875 to 1879, and the Danish Women's Society from 1887 to 1894. Biography Born on 6 February 1845 in Fuglsang Manor on the Danish island of Lolland, Elisabeth Kirstine Frederiksen was the eldest daughter of the successful estate owner and farmer Johannes Ditlev Friderichsen (1791‚Äì1861) and Maria Hansen (1811‚Äì1901). In 1870 she travelled to London and in 1872 to Italy and Switzerland, before settling in Copenhagen where she became active in supporting women's rights, especially by heading the Women Readers' Association. When she was 33, she began to study stenography, becoming the first woman in Denmark to pass the qualifying examination in 1878. As a woman, she was however refused a position as a stenographer at the Rigsdag. In 1879, after qualifying as a teacher, she received an appointment in a state school. In addition to teaching at Frederiksberg's state school (1879‚Äì1895), from 1882 to 1844, she taught pedagogy at N. Zahle's School in Copenhagen. Although Frederiksen did not undertake university studies, in 1891 she received the University of Copenhagen's gold medal for her pedagogical dissertation titled De vigtigste almene Love for Opdragelsen, som lader sig udlede af den nyere Psykologi og Etik, a work which was never published. She had in fact already begun publishing in the 1880s, contributing critical articles to journals such as Vor Ungdom, and writing books on teaching methods including Anskuelsesundervisning (1889), Barnets Sj√¶leliv (1890), and Amerikanske Undervisnings-Eksperimenter (1896). Thanks to study trips to the United States and Germany, she suggested that in their first years at school, children should be encouraged to learn on the basis of their sense of smell, taste, look and feel rather than on reading books. In regard to women's rights, she chaired the Women Readers' Association from 1875 to 1879, presenting a lecture on English women's voluntary contributions to society in 1875 and trying to make the association more suited to the needs of university students. She then became one of the most effective leaders of the Danish Women's Society, chairing the organization from 1887 to 1894 when she began to suffer from serious health problems. She was also a board member of the Women's Art College, Tegne- og Kunstindustriskolen for Kvinder. In 1903, Frederiksen travelled to the United States with her friend Augusta Fenger. On 31 August 1903, she died while staying in the Allegheny Mountains.

The 2017 El Protector was the eight annual event produced under that name and the fourth to be held in January. The focal point of the show was the El Protector tag team tournament where eight teams composed of a \\"rookie\\" and a \\"vet\\" team up to compete for a trophy. Rookie Diablo Jr. teamed up with veteran Black Terry to win the 2017 El Protector tournament defeating Demonio Infernal and Negro Navarro in the finals. The tournament also saw the teams of Black Drag√≥n and Internacional Pantera, El Hijo de Dos Caras and El Hijo del Alebrije, Herodes Jr. and Imposible, Hip Hop Man and Mr. Electro, Drag√≥n Fly and Villano IV, Alfa and M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr. participated in the tournament. The show also featured four non-tournament matches. Production =Background= Lucha Libre has a tradition for a tournament where a rookie, or novato, would be teamed up with an experienced veteran wrestler for a tag team tournament in the hopes of giving the Novato a chance to show case their talent and move up the ranks. Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre has held a Torneo Gran Alternativa (\\"Great Alternative Tournament\\") almost every year since 1994, but the concept predates the creation of the Gran Alternativa. The Mexican professional wrestling company International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG; at times referred to as Grupo Internacional Revoluci√≥n in Mexico) started their own annual rookie/veteran tournament in 2010. The first two tournaments were called Torneo Relampago de Proyeccion a Nuevas Promesas de la Lucha Libre (Spanish for \\"Projecting a new promise lightning tournament\\") but would be renamed the El Protector tournament in 2012. The El Protector shows, as well as the majority of the IWRG shows in general, are held in \\"Arena Naucalpan\\", owned by the promoters of IWRG and their main arena. The 2017 El Protector show was the eight time that IWRG promoted a show around the rookie/veteran tournament. =Storylines= The El Protector event featured 11 professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension- building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. =Tournament participants= *Alfa and M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr. *Black Drag√≥n and Internacional Pantera *Demonio Infernal and Negro Navarro *Diablo Jr. and Black Terry *Drag√≥n Fly and Villano IV *El Hijo del Alebrije and El Hijo de Dos Caras *Hip Hop Man and Mr. Electro *Imposible and Herodes Jr. Event During the fourth match of the night, Rel√°mpago dove out of the ring at Apolo Estrada Jr., who moved out of the way at the last moment which caused Rel√°mpago to crash into the steel barricade. As a result of the impact, Rel√°mpago was unable to return to the ring and was counted out. It's unclear if this was the planned end or if Rel√°mpago hit the guardrail harder than expected, rendering him unable to get back up. Aftermath As a result of winning the 2017 El Protector Diablo Jr. and Black Terry earned a match for the IWRG Intercontinental Tag Team Championship. A week after the tournament Diablo Jr. and Black Terry defeated Chicano and Veneno to win the championship. Their reign as champions lasted for 190 days and included two successful championship defenses until they were defeated by Black Warrior and Warrior Jr. on September 3, 2017.

The event took on January 1, 2017, at \\"Arena Naucalpan\\" in Naucalpan, State of Mexico, IWRG's main venue. The show was also the IWRG 21st Anniversary Show, marking the creation of IWRG on January 1, 1996. It was the seventh time IWRG held a Prisi√≥n Fatal event, all of which featured the eponymous Prisi√≥n Fatal (Spanish for \\"Deadly Prison\\") Steel cage match as the main event. In the Prisi√≥n Fatal match the last person remaining in the cage is forced to unmasked as per the match stipulation. For this version of the Prisi√≥n Fatal steel cage match IWRG booked Golden Magic, Imposible, Pirata Morgan Jr. and Rel√°mpago, who all risked their wrestling mask. During the match both Golden Magic and Rel√°mpago escaped the cage, leading to Imposible pinning Pirata Morgan Jr. to win the match. Afterward, Pirata Morgan Jr. unmasked and revealed that his real name was Pedro Ortiz Soto, 35 years old at the time and that he had been a professional wrestler for 15 years. The show featured four additional matches Production =Background= In the 1960s, wrestler Adolfo \\"Pirata\\" Moreno began promoting wrestling shows in his native Naucalpan, State of Mexico, Mexico, bringing in wrestlers from Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre (EMLL) to Naucalpan to work shows with local wrestlers from the Mexican independent circuit. Initially he ran sporadic shows, but later on began promoting regular shows at \\"Arena KO Al Gusto\\". In the 1970s he served as the local Universal Wrestling Association (UWA) promoter under the name Promociones Moreno efforts. In 1977 Moreno bought Arena KO Al Gusto instead of renting it. After buying the old arena it was demolished to make way for a new arena, Arena Naucalpan, an arena designed specifically for wrestling shows, with a maximum capacity of 2,400 spectators. Arena Naucalpan became the permanent home for Promociones Moreno. In late 1995 Adolfo Moreno decided to create his own promotion, using a regular core roster supplemented with wrestlers from Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL, formerly EMLL), creating the International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG; sometimes referred to as Grupo Internacional Revoluci√≥n in Spanish) on January 1, 1996. From that point on Arena Naucalpan became the main venue for IWRG, hosting the majority of their weekly shows and all of their major shows as well. The first IWRG Anniversary Show was held on January 1, 1997 with all subsequent shows being held on or right after January 1 each year, all at Arena Naucalpan. Posters for the January 1 show mistakenly lists it as the 20th anniversary show, but also bills it as a Prisi√≥n Fatal (\\"Deadly Prison\\") show. Starting as far back as at least 2000, the Mexican wrestling promotion International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG; Sometimes referred to as Grupo Internacional Revoluci√≥n in Spanish) has held several annual events where the main event was a multi-man steel cage match where the last wrestler left in the cage would be forced to either remove their wrestling mask or have their hair shaved off under Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"bet match\\", rules. From 2012 IWRG has promoted a variation of the steel cage match under the moniker Prisi√≥n Fatal at least once a year since its inception. The Prisi√≥n Fatal has the added twist that each competitor is chained by the wrist to the cage with a long steel chain and to escape they fight have to get a key to unlock their chain before they are able to escape. The added chain helps to distinguish it from other Steel cage matches held throughout the year such as the IWRG Guerra del Golfo (\\"Gulf War\\"), IWRG Guerra de Sexos (\\"War of the Sexes\\") or IWRG El Castillo del Terror (\\"The Tower of Terror\\") shows. The Prisi√≥n Fatal shows, as well as the majority of the IWRG shows in general, are held in \\"Arena Naucalpan\\", owned by the promoters of IWRG and their main arena. The 2017 Prisi√≥n Fatal show was the seventh time that IWRG promoted a show under that name and the third time the loser would unmask as a result. =Storylines= The Prisi√≥n Fatal event featured five professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Event For the main event of the show, Golden Magic, Imposible, Pirata Morgan Jr. and Rel√°mpago all had individual chains tied to their wrist, secured with a padlock. The chains were long enough to allow the wrestlers to move around the cage, but not long enough to allow them to escape. The first three wrestlers who managed to climb up a ladder and get a key could unlock their change and climb out. During the first portions of the match Rel√°mpago and Impossible focused on each other, while Pirata Morgan Jr. and Golden Magic fought each other, pairing up based on the storyline feuds that had led up to the cage match. Golden Magic was the first wrestler to escape the cage, followed by Rel√°mpago. In the closing moments of the match, it looked like Pirata Morgan Jr. would escape the match, but as he climbed the cage Golden Magic returned to the arena and his rival over the head with a steel chair. Moments later Rel√°mpago tried to prevent Imposible to escape, but Golden Magic prevented it, allowing Imposible to climb out of the cage. After the match was finished Pirata Morgan Jr. stood in the middle of the ring, removing his torn, blood- soaked mask and announced that his real name was Pedro Ortiz Soto, legitimately the son of Pirata Morgan (Pedro Ortiz Villanueva). Then stated that he was 35 years old and had been a luchador for 15 years.

The main event of the show was the Torneo de Legado Final (\\"The Final Legacy Tournament\\"), a 16-man Torneo cibernetico. The Legado Final match saw eight teams compete where all teams were made up of fathers and sons teaming together in a multi-man elimination match. For the 2017 tournament Villano V Jr. teamed up with his uncle Villano IV, as his father (Villano V) was retired for health reasons.

Production =Background= professional wrestling has been a generational tradition in Lucha libre since its inception early in the 20th century, with a great deal of second or third- generation wrestlers following in the footsteps of their fathers or mothers. Several lucha libre promotions honor those traditions, often with annual tournaments such as Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre's La Copa Junior. The Naucalpan, State of Mexico based International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG) has held a Legado Final (Spanish for \\"Final Legacy\\") on an almost annual basis since 2011, with the 2017 show marking the sixth time they used the name. The Legado Final show, as well as the majority of the IWRG shows in general will be held in \\"Arena Naucalpan\\", owned by the promoters of IWRG. In addition to legitimate second-generation wrestlers there are a number of wrestlers who are presented as second or third-generation wrestlers, normally masked wrestlers promoted as \\"Juniors\\". These wrestlers normally pay a royalty or fee for the use of the name, using the name of an established star to get attention from fans and promoters. Examples of such instances of fictional family relationships include Arturo Beristain, also known as El Hijo del Gladiador (\\"The Son of El Gladiador) who was not related to the original El Gladiador, or El Hijo de Cien Caras who paid Cien Caras for the rights to use the name. =Storylines= The Legado Final event featured six professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Event For the Legado Final match the eight fathers started in the ring while the second-generation wrestlers would wait on the floor, only entering the match when their father was eliminated. Black Warrior, Bombero Infernal, El Hijo del Diablo, Mr. Magic, Negro Navarro, Pantera, Pirata Morgan, and Villano IV all entered the ring, while Bombero Infernal Jr., Diablo Jr., Golden Magic, El Hijo del Pantera, El Hijo de Pirata Morgan, Trauma I, Villano V Jr. and Warrior Jr. remained outside. After 14 eliminations the Legado Final tournament came down to Trauma II and Villano V Jr., leading to Villano V Jr. winning the match moments later. After his victory, Villano V Jr. made a challenged Mr. Electro to defend the IWRG Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship at a future date.

It does not contain cysteine residues or disulfide bridges. The polypeptide can block skeletal muscle contraction by blocking nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.  Sources  The toxin is derived from the venomous glands of the Azemiops feae viper species. The Azemiops feae viper is the only species within the Azemiopinae subfamily, which, together with Crotalinae and Viperinae subfamilies, belongs to the Viperidae family.  Chemistry  = Structure = Azemiopsin is a polypeptide molecule consisting of 21 residues, which does not contain cysteine residues or disulfide bridges. Its amino acid sequence is DNWWPKPPHQGPRPPRPRPKP and its molecular weight 2540 Da. Azemiopsin predominantly contains beta-structures: 62% consists of beta-structure (beta sheet + beta-turn), 34% consists of unordered structure, and the remaining 4% consist of alpha helix. This suggests that the polypeptide may likely adopt a hairpin-like structure. = Homology = Azemiopsin is structurally similar to waglerins, which are peptides from the venom produced by Tropidolaemus wagleri. This resemblance is especially apparent in the C-terminal part, which includes alternating prolines and positively charged residues. However, the absence of disulfide bridges in azemiopsin makes this toxin less stable compared to other acetylcholine receptor-blocking peptides.  Target  Azemiopsin is a high-affinity selective inhibitor of muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and it can thus block synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction. The peptide can inhibit (IC50 ‚âà19 nM) the muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, assessed by measuring acetylcholine-evoked calcium responses in muscles. The peptide efficiently competes with bungarotoxin for binding to the Torpedo nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (IC50 0.18 ¬± 0.03 ŒºM). Additionally, it has shown an inhibitory effect on mouse muscle type Œ±1Œ≤1ŒµŒ¥ nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in nanomolar range (IC50 = 19 ¬± 8 nM). The peptide is less effective (IC50 ‚âà3 ŒºM) at Œ±7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. The peptide displayed low affinity to Œ±4Œ≤2 and Œ±3-containing muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. The peptide showed no effect on the GABA receptor and the 5-HT receptor at concentrations up to respectively 100 Œºm and 10 Œºm. In conclusion, azemiopsin shows high selectivity in inhibiting certain nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes.  Mode of Action  Azemiopsin is a blocker of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in muscle.  Toxicity  Research has been done on the toxicity of azemiopsin for three different routes of administration in mice: intraperitoneal, intravenous and intramuscular. For intraperitoneal administration LD50 was 2.6 ¬± 0.3 mg/kg, for intravenous administration LD50 was 0.51 +/- 0.06 mg/kg, and for intramuscular injection, it was 0.732 +/- 0.13 mg/kg. intramuscular injection of Azemiopsin at a dosis between 0.3 mg/kg and 0.7 mg/kg results in various symptoms, including impaired coordination of movements, loss of muscle tone, decreased motor activity, impaired breathing, and decreased response to external stimuli. The symptoms appeared roughly 5 to 7 minutes after injection and were the most severe between 10 and 20 minutes. After a period of 60 minutes, most mice showed almost complete recovery but still had lowered motor activity and muscle tone  Therapeutic Use  Azemiopsin has potential to be used therapeutically as a muscle relaxant because of its ability to selectively inhibit the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Moreover, the peptide is not inferior to the relaxants that are currently used but it is still in the preclinical study phase.

He was a consistent top-class performer who recorded his best results over a distance of seven furlongs. As a two-year-old in 1987 he won his first three races including the Somerville Tattersall Stakes before running third in the William Hill Futurity. In the following year he won the Beeswing Stakes, Hungerford Stakes, Park Stakes, Challenge Stakes and Prix de la For√™t. He finished second in his other three races, namely the Jersey Stakes, Bet With The Tote Trophy and Queen Elizabeth II Stakes. He retired at the end of the year with a record of eight wins, four seconds and one third place: the only horses to beat him were Warning, Indian Ridge, Emmson and Sheriff's Star. After his retirement from racing he became a successful breeding stallion. He died in June 2001. Background Salse was a \\"rangy, useful-looking\\" bay horse with a large white star bred in Kentucky by Oxford Stable. As a yearling he was auctioned at the Keeneland September Yearling Sale and was bought for $190,000 by the bloodstock agent Tote Cherry-Downes. He was sent to race in Europe where he raced in the colours of Sheikh Mohammed and was trained by Henry Cecil at the Warren Place Stable in Newmarket, Suffolk. His sire Topsider was just below top class as a racehorse, recording his biggest win in the Grade III Sport Page Handicap in 1978. As a breeding stallion the best of his other progeny included North Sider, Twafeaj and Assatis (Gran Premio del Jockey Club). Salse's dam Carnival Princess won one minor race from two starts, and was a half-sister to the Oaks d'Italia winner Carnauba. She was a great-granddaughter of the American broodmare Arena (foaled 1926) whose other descendants included Miswaki, Almutawakel, Manila and Tobougg. Racing career =1987: two-year-old season= On the Newmarket training gallops Salse showed considerable promise but also appeared to be somewhat headstrong and hard to handle: he was therefore accompanied to the start by his trainer's assistant in his early races. The colt made his racecourse debut in a maiden race over six furlongs at Yarmouth in August and won by two and a half lengths from Persian Heights. In the Sancton Stakes over seven furlongs at York Racecourse in September Salse recorded an impressive victory as he drew away from his opponents in the closing stages and came home six lengths clear of Strike Force. The colt was then stepped up in class for the Somerville Tattersall Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse and after taking the lead approaching the final furlong he pulled clear to win very easily by four lengths from Rawnuk. On 24 October Salse started the 4/7 favourite for the Group 1 William Hill Futurity over one mile at Doncaster Racecourse but was beaten into third place behind Emmson and Sheriff's Star. In the official International Classification of two-year-olds for 1987, Salse was given a rating of 116, nine pounds behind the top-rated pair Ravinella and Warning. The independent Timeform organisation rated him on 118, nine pounds inferior to Warning, who was their best two-year-old of the season. =1988: three- year-old season= Salse had training problems in the early part of 1988 and did not reappear until the Royal Ascot meeting on 15 June when he started the 11/10 favourite for the Jersey Stakes and finished second of the twelve runners, a length behind the winner Indian Ridge. Ten days later at Newmarket he was beaten a short head by Cadeaux Genereux (to whom he was conceding two pounds in weight) in the Criterion Stakes. In the Bet With The Tote Trophy at Lingfield Park on 9 July he was narrowly beaten by Warning at level weights, but finished eight lengths clear of the other six runners. Sixteen days later Salse started 4/5 favourite for the Group 3 Beeswing Stakes over seven furlongs on soft ground at Newcastle Racecourse. Ridden by Steve Cauthen he took the lead approaching the last quarter mile and won by one and a half lengths from Always Fair. The Hungerford Stakes at Newbury Racecourse on 12 August saw a repeat of the Beeswing result, with Salse beating Always Fair in a field which also included Indian Ridge. The Park Stakes at Doncaster saw the colt matched against five opponents headed by the 1000 Guineas runner-up Dabaweyaa. With Cauthen in the saddle he led from the start and accelerated clear in the last quarter mile to win \\"comfortably\\" by three lengths. On 24 September Salse faced Warning again when he was stepped up in class and distance to contest the Group 1 Queen Elizabeth II Stakes over one mile at Ascot. He took the lead in the straight but was unable to deal with the acceleration of his rival and was beaten into second, with Persian Heights, Soviet Star, Indian Ridge and Magic of Life finishing behind. In the Group 2 Challenge Stakes at Newmarket on 13 October the colt was ridden by Michael Roberts and started favourite ahead of seven opponents. He took the lead a furlong out and won by two and a half lengths from his stablemate Reprimand. On 23 October Salse was sent to France for the Group 1 Prix de la For√™t over 1400 metres at Longchamp Racecourse in which he was ridden by Willie Carson. His twelve opponents included Big Shuffle (Cork and Orrery Stakes), Bitooh (Crit√©rium de Maisons-Laffitte), Blue Note (Prix Maurice de Gheest), Bon Vent (Prix du Palais-Royal), Fair Judgment (International Stakes), Gabina (Prix d'Astarte), Harmless Albatross (Prix des Ch√™nes), In Extremis (Prix du Rond Point) and Raise A Memory (Prix Thomas Bryon). Salse turned into the straight in fifth place, took the lead 200 metres from the finish and wo by one and a half lengths from Gabina, with a further two and a half lengths back to Big Shuffle in third. Stud record Salse was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion at the Side Hill Stud in Newmarket. Despite recording all of his biggest wins over distances short of a mile he proved surprisingly adept as a sire of stayers. The best of his offspring included Classic Cliche, Lemon Souffle, Air Express, Bianca Nera, Luso (Hong Kong Vase), Timboroa (Turf Classic), Sanmartino (Ebor Handicap) and Sausalito Bay (Supreme Novices' Hurdle). He was also the damsire of Rekindling. Salse was euthanized in June 2001 at the age of sixteen because of a \\"crumbling pedal bone\\". Pedigree *Salse was inbred 3 √ó 4 to Princequillo, meaning that this stallion appear in both the third and fourth generations of his pedigree. He was also inbred 4 √ó 4 to Nearco.

Sakima's music frequently explores LGBT themes not typically portrayed in mainstream music.  Early life  Isaac Sakima is originally from Newcastle upon Tyne, but was raised in Milton Keynes. He later returned to Newcastle and identifies as a Geordie. At the age of 6, Sakima felt his first gay attraction towards another classmate. He started making music at 8 years old.  Career  Sakima is a London-based singer-songwriter. His debut track \\"Energy\\" as premiered by Zane Lowe on BBC Radio 1 in August 2014. \\"Energy\\" is a \\"moody pop ballad\\". He has worked with Cyril Hahn and Ryan Hemsworth. Sakima was working with a Chicago-based manager Ardie Farhadieh and the company Wick Management. Farhadieh connected Sakima with Jakwob and his label Boom Ting for his song \\"Energy\\". In 2014, Sakima was managed by the UK-based company, Empire. In May 2017 Sakima released his debut EP, Facsimile, containing four-tracks. Out describes Facsimile as \\"an accidental gateway into queer eroticism\\". The opening track is titled \\"I Used to Have an En Suit\\". Other tracks include \\"He's Trippi\\" and \\"Happy Hr\\". \\"He's Trippi\\" was influenced by Zayn Malik's \\"She\\". Sakima liked the song but noticed the pronouns and highly sexualized nature of the song. He wanted to release a song using pronouns applicable to gay people. He released his EP Ricky on 13 October 2017. In the seven-track EP, Sakima sings about the rejection of heteronormativity and explores Polari. The track \\"Daddy\\" featuring YLXR, used Polari in a queer-themed song inspired by \\"Work from Home\\".

He released the LGBT-themed single \\"Show Me\\" in 2018. It explores homophobia and cruising for sex. In 2018, R3hab released the album The Wave including the track \\"Back To You\\" with Sakima. On 14 September 2018, Sakima released the single \\"Holy Water\\" from his debut album Project Peach, which was released in 2019. Joshua Bote of Billboard describes \\"Holy Water\\" describes the song \\"with a reverb-and-trap-heavy fog surrounding him, he treads through self-love as a spiritual exercise, in effect, turning RuPaul‚Äôs iconic mantra into a prayer of sorts\\". His single \\"Apps\\" was inspired by hookup culture and the relationship complications caused by dating apps.  Artistry  In the media, Sakima has been described as a \\"R&B; artist\\", \\"alternative pop singer\\", \\"electro-R&B; musician\\", and a \\"pop artist\\". Sakima sings pop and R&B; songs with queer themes. Sakima stated that he aims to add queer stories and a gay perspective to traditional pop and R&B; music with the hope of normalizing LGBT experiences.  Personal life  Sakima lives in London. He is a gay man. On his sexuality, Sakima reported that \\"I never 'realized' I was gay...I always knew. I‚Äôve never known anything different. I‚Äôve never known what it's like to be in the closet.

Life, education & career Midgley had won a classical scholarship to Oxford, but served four years as a radar engineer in the RAF during the Second World War. After the war he completed the PPE course at New College, Oxford and studied under Isaiah Berlin and Gilbert Ryle. Since 1949 he worked at the Department of Philosophy, Newcastle University, as lecturer and senior lecturer (1949-1986), and as head of department (1982-1986). In 1950 he married a fellow philosopher, Mary Scrutton, with whom he raised three sons (Tom, David and Martin). Philosophy Midgley, influenced by Wittgenstein and J.L. Austin, did some groundbreaking work in the fields of deontic logic, philosophy of language and speech act theory. He published two seminal papers (in 1955 and 1959) on the concept of a linguistic rule. The concept of constitutive rules finds its origin in Wittgenstein and Rawls John Rawls: Two Concepts of Rules (1955), and has been elaborated by Midgley G.C.J. Midgley: Linguistic Rules (1959), Max Black Max Black: Models and Metaphors (1962), G.H. von Wright G.H. von Wright: Norm and Action (1963), David Shwayder David Schwayder: The Stratification of Behaviour (1965) and John Searle Searle: Speech Acts (1969). In their treatment of the distinction between regulative rules and constitutive rules Midgley and Searle are on the same page. Kathrin Gl√ºer and Peter Pagin: Rules of Meaning and Practical Reasoning (1998) Whereas regulative rules are prescriptions that regulate a pre-existing activity (whose existence is logically independent of the rules), constitutive rules constitute an activity the existence of which is logically dependent on the rules. For example: traffic rules are regulative rules that prescribe certain behaviour in order to regulate the traffic. Without these rules however, the traffic would not cease to be. In contrast: the rules of chess are constitutive rules that constitute the game. Without these rules chess would not exist, since the game is logically dependent on the rules.

The database is a geospatially-organized collection of material drawn from published and unpublished sources held in public libraries and archives throughout Canada. History The atlas was created from 1999 to 2014 by a team consisting of individuals from the Cartographic Research Centre at Carleton University, the Marine Affairs Program at Dalhousie University, and the Scott Polar Research Institute at Cambridge University. The research was co-directed by Claudio Aporta (Dalhousie University), Michael Bravo (Cambridge University), and Fraser Taylor (Carleton University). The atlas was featured in the 2014 documentary The Polar Sea. Funding was procured from the Canadian federal research-funding agency Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council. Description The atlas documents the historical and present communities established and the land, sea, and ice routes travelled. It also contains information about geographical features. The maps are published on a dedicated website using Google Maps, with each marked feature accompanied by anecdotes and other details. These are intended as an educational resource, not a navigational aid. Taylor states that more research is necessary to document other regions, including Labrador, arctic Quebec, and the western Canadian arctic. The creators hope to expand the atlas with information about the Inupiat, Inuvialuit, and peoples of Nunatsiavut and Nunavik. The network of trails and routes were often created for hunting, and were seasonal based on animal migration, including open water routes in the summer and ice routes in the winter. Others were used for trade and communication. Trails depicted include those travelled by foot, sled, and boat, many of which are still used today. Sources used to create the maps include the lore of Inuit elders, maps from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and unpublished documents from explorers, ethnographers, and visitors preceding the Inuit resettlement of the early twentieth century. The source maps from which information was culled are published on the Pan Inuit Trails Atlas website. The maps also provide an additional point of argument for the Government of Canada to claim that the Northwest Passage through the Canadian Arctic Archipelago is part of the Canadian Internal Waters and thus under Canadian sovereignty. The maps document Inuit place names that \\"extend from the land onto the sea ice\\", and previous rulings by the International Court of Justice state that indigenous groups possess rights to areas they have traditionally occupied. Some of the traditional trails have been modified recently with \\"deviations or detours from original routes\\" to mitigate sea ice forming later in the autumn or breaking up earlier in the spring as a result of climate change in the Arctic.

The adults are dark brown or black, have purple eyes and sport a large bump on their foreheads. Juveniles are bright blue on their backs, with orange or yellow on the underside. Distribution Microspathodon bairdii is endemic to the Eastern Pacific where its occurs from the mouth of the Gulf of California in Mexico south to Ecuador. Its range includes the Revillagigedo, Cocos, Malpelo and Galapagos Islands. Habitat and biology Microspathodon bairdii occurs on rocky inshore reefs exposed to wave action and currents, being found down to . It is most frequently recorded in the vicinity large boulders in the shallow subtidal zone. In the Gulf of Chiriqu√≠, Panam√°, the bumphead damselfish is found among huge corals and exposed shallow rocky reefs. It is mainly herbivorous, feeding on algae, but will take a hook baited with animal matter and will readily eat meat in the aquarium. They form pairs to breed and the eggs are laid in crevices in rocks where there is a strong current, on the leeward side of the current. The eggs are hoarded and aerated by the male.

Biography  In 1985, Cito founded the local TV station Antenna Taranto 6 (AT6); his channel gets great success and Cito becomes very popular in his city also because, intercepting the dissatisfaction with the bankruptcy management of the city administration lead by the Christian Democracy and the Socialist Party in the early 1990s, he created a political column in which he denounced the offenses committed by local administrators. In 1997 some of his family members bought the historic Lucanian broadcaster Tele Basilicata Matera, whose operational headquarters were soon transferred to Taranto. Between 2003 and 2007, during his detention to serve the sentence for external competition in mafia association, he graduated in Legal Sciences.

In 1992, Cito founded his own party: AT6 - Southern Action League, a far-right meridionalist party. Cito candidates for mayor of Taranto in the municipal elections of 1993, winning the run-off against the progressive candidate Gaetano Minervini, often insulted by Cito during the electoral campaign through his television channel. In 1996, Cito leaves the office of mayor in order to candidate for the Chamber of Deputies during the 1996 general elections, managing to gain a seat in Parliament.

In the grounds he built a Gothic mausoleum using knapped flint and surrounded by Irish Yew trees. Both Bliss and his wife were laid to rest in the mausoleum but were later moved to Brandon Cemetery. When the gun flint industry began to decline Bliss had his work force plant over 1 million trees, in the process creating Thetford Forest.

Of the nations that won medals at these Games, two had not won an Olympic medal nor Youth Olympic medal, Honduras and Saint Lucia. Burundi, Iceland, Malaysia, Mauritius, Qatar and Saudi Arabia won their first gold medal at an Olympic/Youth Olympic event, having previously only won silver and bronze medals. Afghanistan, Algeria, Kosovo, Luxembourg, Macedonia, Mauritius, Niger, Philippines, Sri Lanka and United Arab Emirates won their first ever Youth Olympics medals.  Medal table  The Organising Committee is not keeping an official medal tally. The ranking in this table is based on information provided by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and is consistent with IOC convention in its published medal tables. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won (in this context, a \\"nation\\" is an entity represented by a National Olympic Committee). The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If nations are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically. Two gold medals were awarded for a first-place tie in the Mixed BMX freestyle park event. No silver medal was awarded as a consequence. Two silver medals were awarded for a second-place tie in the Boys' 50 m butterfly swimming, Boys' IKA Twin Tip Racing and Girls' IKA Twin Tip Racing events. No bronze medal was awarded as a consequence. In November 2019, in the girls' +63 kg event in weightlifting, Thailand gold medallist had tested positive for a banned substance, and the medal was stripped. As a result, Turkey was raised from a silver to gold medal, Uzbekistan from the bronze medal to silver and New Zealand received a bronze medal. In judo (9), karate (6) and taekwondo (10) two bronze medals are awarded in each event (25 additional bronze medals total).

She was created by Erin Bozon, wife of Matt Bozon, WayForward's creative director. She has been voiced by Cristina Vee since 2014's Shantae and the Pirate's Curse. Shantae is a half-genie, the daughter of a human father and a mother who was a Guardian Genie. She consequently has limited magical powers, including her signature whipping hair and magical dances that allow her to change into magical creatures, and has to rely on her skills and magical items that she acquires during her adventures to fight her adversaries. The character has been well received and is featured in several lists of the greatest video game heroines. Shantae has since become WayForward's mascot. Concept and creation left Erin Bozon, wife of WayForward's creative director Matt Bozon, came up with the idea for Shantae in 1994 while coming back from a day camp where she worked as a counselor. The character was named after one of the campers. She came up with the basic design and had the idea that she could whip her hair as a weapon and would use dancing to charm or summon animals, which was later changed to transformations into animals and mythological creatures. Matt Bozon tried to incorporate more conventional weaponry to the concept, but ultimately reverted to fighting moves which incorporated Shantae's hair. Erin Bozon's initial inspiration for the character was the TV show I Dream of Jeannie, while Matt's subsequent work on the character and her universe were based on Ranma ¬Ω, Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water or Hayao Miyazaki's films, as he was introduced to Japanese animation around that time while studying at CalArts. By 1997, Shantae's design was still not completely locked, as she sported brown hair, didn't wear earrings but wore golden bracelets, and had different proportions. At that point, her magic was still meant to summon animals, her dances were generating magical attacks based on the four elements, and she had different outfits giving her different abilities. By the year 2000, Matt Bozon had locked the final proportions and her ultimate graphical style, adding earrings and replacing the bracelets with wrist guards, and coloring her hair into her signature purple. After the first game, Matt Bozon worked to make the character easier for other people to work with. Her hip sash was progressively removed, and attempts to turn the character into 3-D generated a new batch of issues as her initial appearance had to be revamped to make her look more natural, with her hair in particular blocking the view and needing to move naturally. Various experiments were done to make her feel more kid-like and heroic, but feedback was mixed, which led to reverting to a look closer to her original one, but with the clothing alterations kept. For Shantae: Half-Genie Hero, her proportions were altered, being described by WayForward as featuring \\"[a] bowling pin shaped body, [...] very tall eyes, [...] [a] long torso, and black triangular pants\\" with the main aim being on-screen contrast and readability regardless of the distance from the camera. Her lighter skin on the first sketches in contrast to her former design generated minor controversy, and WayForward worked to fix it later on. Portrayal upright In Shantae: Risky's Revenge, Shantae was voiced by Meagan Glaser. For all subsequent appearances, the character has been portrayed by voice actress Cristina Vee, who had started collaborating with WayForward in 2012. Appearances In the first game, Shantae is described as a half-genie, the offspring of a human father and Guardian Genie mother whom she never met, as they disappeared when she was only a baby. She wishes to prove her worth as Scuttle Town's Guardian Genie, despite her scarce magical abilities. She is described as a \\"spirited dancer with a strong sense of right and wrong\\", and \\"trouble-prone\\". When the evil lady-pirate Risky Boots comes to the town and steals her adoptive uncle Mimic's steam engine, she sets on an adventure to stop Risky and recover the engine. By the end of the game, she has come to terms with her nature and is relieved to hear from Mayor Scuttlebutt that the fact she is not a full genie doesn't matter, since she proved her worth by stopping Risky. In the sequel, Risky's Revenge, Risky Boots sets to take her revenge on Shantae, and ultimately succeeds by stripping her of her magical powers. This, however, backfires in Shantae and the Pirate's Curse when the magic that escaped Shantae's body awakens Risky's old mentor, the Pirate Master, which leads to Shantae and Risky reaching a temporary truce to defeat him, as Shantae needs to fight with magical items and Risky's pirate equipment since she no longer has her powers. Shantae ultimately succeeds and recovers her magic. In Shantae: Half-Genie Hero, Risky reverts to being the antagonist, as she tries to take control of the Genie Realm, an ethereal place where all Guardian Genies were locked several years ago, when Shantae was only an infant. Shantae thwarts Risky's plans and the genies reward Shantae by informing her of her mother's whereabouts: Shantae's mother left to the Genie Realm long ago with other genies to ward evil beings, leaving Shantae in Mimic's custody, asking her to understand her sacrifice and reassuring her of her love. In Shantae and the Seven Sirens, Shantae and her friends arrive on a tropical island, where she meets and allies with a group of other half-genies. =Other appearances= Outside of the Shantae series, Shantae has been featured as a guest character in a number of other games. She appeared as a playable character in the 2015 WayForward Apple Watch game Watch Quest. She was also featured in the 2010 downloadable WarioWare: D.I.Y. microgame Shantae NAB!, created by Matt Bozon. Shantae appeared as a guest character in Mutant Mudds Super Challenge and in Runbow and Blaster Master Zero as a downloadable guest character. Shantae appears in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate as a spirit. Reception Publishers were initially skeptical regarding the character, and asked Matt Bozon to consider switching to a male lead, as they believed male gamers would never play as a female lead character. Matt Bozon stood by Shantae, believing that she \\"had to exist\\" to see \\"if there was an audience reaching back\\", although, after the game's commercial failure, he later acknowledged that publishers probably \\"genuinely knew their markets\\". Despite the initial difficulties, the series' lasting critical appeal led WayForward to adopt Shantae as their official mascot. Shantae herself was well received by fans and critics. Michael Rougeau for Complex included Shantae in his list of the greatest heroines in video game history in 2013, declaring that \\"there's [...] something about the half-genie girl\\". In 2017, Robert Workman of Comicbook.com named Shantae in his list of the greatest video game heroines, having some reservations about her sexy design, but claiming that \\"there's no question that this genie has had no trouble making players' wishes come true\\". Chris Isaac of Comic Book Ressources listed Shantae 11th in his list of female video game characters making a huge impact in 2017. Tristan Jurkovich of GameRant.com depicts Shantae as a \\"cool heroine\\". Daniel Alvarez for TheGamer.com called Shantae a \\"famous Half-Genie Hero herself\\", describing her as \\"the undisputed queen of indie characters\\". In 2018, readers of Source Gaming.com voted Shantae as the 10th-top most wanted characters for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. In 2020, Shantae was ranked 13th-top most requested character for a dlc.

Initially the term applied to changes in the natural environment, but increasingly it is also used for adaptation to anthropogenically induced change. History Alexander von Humboldt was the first to note the resilience of life forms with increasing altitude and the accompanying decreasing prevalence in numbers, and he documented this in the 18th century on the slopes of the volcano Chimborazo. Understanding of bioresilience evolved from research led by The Mountain Institute when establishing two of the national parks that surround Mount Everest, Makalu-Barun National Park in Nepal, and Qomolangma National Nature Preserve in the Tibet Autonomous Region of China. The research documented greater biodiversity at Everest's base than higher up. There were progressively fewer documented species as the mountain ascended into higher biomes, from subtropical to temperate to alpine to Arctic-like. These fewer species, though, had greater biologic robustness correlating directly with increasing bioresilience. Current research Monitoring of bioresilience, beginning in the Everest ecosystem but expanding to other mountain ecologies globally is being carried out by the Biomeridian Project at Future Generations University. The concept of bioresilience has also been applied to human health to explain aging or chronic diseases decrease the ability of the body to adapt; in such cases, the system becomes rigid and unable to cross different life demands. As the human body loses robustness with age, an individual becomes unable to accommodate new life demands, be they contagions, stress, or events such as injury or even jet lag. The importance of resilience in biological systems has been widely recognized in terms of the impacts on life by anthropogenic changes. Accelerating environmental change and continuing loss of genetic resources positions lower biodiversity around the planet threatening ecosystem services. A major mitigating factor will be life forms with higher resilience. Paralleling the work in mountain environments, a growing number of studies is applying the concept of bioresilience to assess the robustness of life in other ecological systems challenged by the Anthropocene. One such study was with the adaptive renewal and natural perturbation in Lake Victoria, the world's second largest freshwater lake.

History The origins of the 7.62 cm FlaK L/30 go back to the Russian 76 mm divisional gun M1902 field gun which was captured in large numbers during the first two years of World War I. A combination of factors led the Germans to issue M1902's to their troops as replacements. These included: * An underestimation of light field artillery losses during the first two years of the war and an inadequate number of replacement guns being produced. * An underestimation of ammunition consumption, inadequate production capacity, and resulting shortages. * The superior ballistic performance of the M1902 compared to German designs. Once adequate numbers of new field guns such as the 7.7 cm FK 16 were being produced obsolete types such as the 9 cm Kanone C/73 and captured guns such as the M1902 and Canon de 75 mod√®le 1897 were withdrawn from front-line service and issued to anti- aircraft units. At first, all of the combatants employed field guns on improvised anti-aircraft mounts, which were typically earthen embankments or scaffolds to get the muzzle pointed skyward. Later in the war, specialized anti-aircraft mounts were developed. Design The 7.62 cm FlaK L/30 was a conversion of captured M1902's that were placed on high-angle mounts for the anti-aircraft role. Unlike the 7.7 cm FlaK L/35, which was bored out to fire German ammunition the 7.62 cm FlaK L/30 could fire Russian or German made ammunition. The reason why the M1902 was not converted was that the steel it was made from was brittle and didn't take well to reboring. The conversion was mainly focused on modifying the M1902's carriage to accommodate a pedestal mount which allowed up to 70¬∞ of elevation and a travel lock on the recoil mechanism. In the field, the guns were anchored to a firing ring to allow 360¬∞ of traverse. At least 120 guns were converted by Krupp during World War I.

It was built from 1876 to 1945. It is also known as Lithgow Pottery and Brickworks. The property is privately owned. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The site listed on the State Heritage Register No. 78 contains the archaeological remains of the clay products division of Lithgow Valley Colliery Co. Ltd. one of Lithgow's most significant and long- lived industrial companies. The rich and accessible coal seams in the Lithgow Valley were exploited vigorously after the rail link to the coast and to the west was opened in 1869. Thomas Brown, a Scottish pastoralist who owned the central and eastern part of the valley, himself opened two coal mines (Esk Creek and Eskbank); he also sold his southerly portions (54 and 87 in the original parish of Lett) to Bathurst entrepreneurs who established Lithgow Valley Colliery (LVC) in 1872-3. =Diversification= The three principal colliery companies in Lithgow all diversified in the later 1870s: Eskbank into iron and bricks, the Vale of Clwydd into copper and LVC into clay products. The area immediately to the east of the LVC mine was developed first by lease, then by direct investment. The name used by the LVC in all its surviving catalogues for clay products is the Lithgow Pottery and Brickworks which produced bricks, pipes, chimney-pots, tiles and, for a time, domestic pottery. The brickworks was the first to be established in 1876 when a brickmaker called Aston was operating a clamp-kiln. This was followed by a pipe-making kiln in 1878, manufacturing both sanitary and agricultural pipes. In 1879 the first pottery kiln was built, operated by a skilful English potter, James Silcock. Domestic pottery The domestic products from the pottery have won justifiable acclaim, with major collections on display at Eskbank House's new gallery in Lithgow and at the Powerhouse Museum in Sydney. Under a succession of master potters,Silcock 1879-81, Brough 1883-6, Henderson 1886, Abbott 1887-90 and Brough again 1890-4 the pottery flourished aesthetically but was the least profitable part of the LVC business and was closed between 1896 and 1905. A brief, though celebrated, revival occurred under a lessee, Arthur Brownfield, another English potter, from 1905 to 1907, but thereafter there was no commercial production of domestic wares. Pipes and bricks Although the domestic pottery did not function after 1907, pipes, tiles, chimney-pots and bricks continued to be produced in large quantities, right through the Depression and during the Second World War. The competition from Fowlers in Sydney, which had a similar reliance on heavy industrial wares, was successfully met, while there was sufficient demand for bricks to make profitability possible for four or five brickworks in twentieth century Lithgow. =Spatial arrangement= In the nineteenth century the spatial arrangement of the clay products plant placed pipe-making to the north, the brick kilns to the west and the pottery to the south. In 1901 LVC same substantial capital into a state-of-the-art continuous brick-kiln, patented by Sercombe on the Hoffman model: this new and much larger kiln was inserted in the central area east of the pipe-kilns, close to the clay quarry. In addition to these three sections (bricks, pipes, pottery) each with its own kilns, chimney-stacks, specialised work-sheds and, storage areas, there were general utilities such as a blacksmith's shop, engine house, boiler house and clay store which changed over time. The LVC company offices had been constructed in 1878 and still survive at 69 Bent Street, adjacent to a superior house for an executive at 67 Bent Street, at the extreme north of the site. The offices but not the house are covered by the State Heritage Register listing. =Clay supplies= Raw materials for all these products were on site. Just beyond the works to the east, clay and shale were excavated from the hillside, creating an ever larger clay-pit as well a quarry face. Clay was also brought in from leases at Clarence and at Marrangaroo but the combined quarry and pit on site remained in use and the quarry face is a striking feature of the modified landscape. The clay pit itself is filled in and submerged under large quantities of industrial materials. =Tramways= The tramway system which grew in complexity up to 1906 is barely visible. The last part to be built, leading from Bent Street to the east end of the Sercombe kiln, was visible as a drainage channel until the new Coalex offices and laboratory were built across it in 1981. The north end of this earlier tramway from Bent Street running south parallel to the original Hassan Street is now under Silcock Street and the tramway connecting the colliery with the clay-products section has been largely removed by works associated with the supermarket on the colliery site. =Closure= The entire production of clay products ceased in 1945 and the plant was auctioned off early in 1946. The millions of bricks manufactured on the site over 69 years built many of Lithgow's houses, can be seen in the major tunnels and deviation works on the eastern railway line and in many contexts throughout the state. The stoneware pipes met many government and municipal contracts both in the Lithgow and the metropolitan area: sewerage in many parts of the state commenced using Lithgow pipes and repair work keeps revealing these relics. Since the auction in 1946 the clay-products site has been progressively cleared. The last surviving kiln, Big Ben, pipe- kiln no. 4, built around 1900, fell down in 1977 and since then most of the site has been cleared and/or used for dumping building materials. The only structures (other than the offices and company housing) from the industrial plant to survive are the store for patterns and pottery which also housed a sulky; the square pottery chimneystack; the rectangular clay-store with a water-tank on top, (all three in the south); and the more recent powder magazine away to the east. The colliery site to the west was systematically obliterated in 1972 to construct a supermarket, so these clay products buildings are the sole industrial relics of LVC. =Re-use= The storehouse was occupied by the distinguished local craft-potter, Bob Cunningham, in the 1970s and 1980s. Cunningham built a pottery kiln of brick in front of the store (to the east) and installed another kiln within the store. Since Cunningham left the premises in 1994, another craft-potter Cameron Williams and his wife Colleen have leased the store area, so the traditional use of the site is maintained. Development The north end of the Pottery and Brickworks site was developed in 1981 when the then owners Coalex Pty. Ltd. were allowed to construct new offices and laboratories on lots 2 and 3, immediately behind the original offices at 69 Bent Street. An archaeological investigation of lots 2 and 3 was undertaken by Dr Edward Higginbotham: his excavations established precise locations for the third and fourth of the four nineteenth-century pipekilns, for the two pipe-drying sheds, for the Sercombe brick-kiln of 1901 and for the last of the rail-sidings which served that brick-kiln. The legibility of the foundations was unexpectedly high and Higginbotham's photograph of the excavated foundations of part of pipe-kiln no. 3 was used as a poster by the then Department of Planning.Jack 1996 Following community representations from the National Trust of Australia (NSW) and the then Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences a section 136 order was placed over the site on 11 July 1979 to prevent demolition of remaining structures. An Interim Conservation Order was placed over the site on 10 August 1979 to provide to time to further investigate the significance of the site. On 31 July 1981 the Heritage Council of NSW in recognition of the sites State heritage significance placed a Permanent Conservation Order over the site. The site was transferred to the State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  Description  Chimney The Lithgow Valley Colliery and Pottery Site listed on the State Heritage Register was once a part of a much larger site. The current site listed is 4.2 hectares. It contains the following: *Pottery and Pattern Store - a brick building. Used to store pottery and patterns and also housed a sulky *Square pottery chimney stack - brick construction. Served a number of kilns *Clay Store - rectanglar with water tank on top *Magazine - 20th century powder magazine. Brick structure, sunk with brick protective walling and partly obscured by modern chitter *Original Offices - Designed by a founder of Lithgow Valley Colliery, Edward Gell, a Pugin-trained architect from Yorkshire who practiced in Bathurst in the 1860s and 1870s until he moved to Lithgow as general manager of Lithgow Valley Colliery in 1880. The offices were convenient both to the colliery and the pottery. In the 1890s a new western wing, matching the gabled east wing, was added to the offices. They remained Coalex offices until the new block was built behind in 1980s and are now leased as a doctor's surgery. = Archaeological - condition = As at 27 September 2011, the archaeological potential is high. = Modifications and dates = *1981 - New Office and laboratories constructed on lots 2 and 3.  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries As at 27 September 2011, Lithgow Pottery and brickworks is of State heritage significance as an important producer of basic industrial products for wide-ranging markets over a period of 69 years and distinguished tableware for 20 years. The pottery founded by James Silcock in 1879 continued by other skilled potters and refounded in 1905 by Arthur Brownfield, brought Staffordshire skills to create colonial wares capable of competing with British imports. However it was not a financial success and the high collectability of Lithgow wares today gives the pottery a higher national profile than it enjoyed whilst operating. Industrial and agricultural pipes remained an economic strength of the Lithgow Valley Colliery Co. for more than thrice the life of the pottery. Despite strong competition from Sydney makers of ceramic pipes and from the Hoskins firm's iron pipes, Lithgow products were used in many important drainage and sewerage plants throughout New South Wales. The brick production was very large, up to 50,000 bricks a day after the Sercombe kiln was installed in 1901 and is reflected in many major public works in the state as well as private houses in Lithgow. The site is historically rare because of its relationship of clay products with a major colliery and an adjacent clay pit; the exceptionally high esteem in which its domestic pottery products are held and its economic importance within the Lithgow region. It is also representative of pipeworks and of successful brickworks in the state showing investment in up-to-date technology after 1901 as well as traditional brick-kiln technology. The site's significance of its potential contribution to understanding clay-products technology in the period 1876 to 1945 is dependent entirely on the integrity of the subsurface archaeological record. A great deal of disturbance has diminished the practicality of realising the archaeological potential of much of the area. There are however two small areas containing substantial intact portions of brickwork an important concretion of pipewares and other industrial remains. These are probably not in-situ but should be investigated before any development takes place. The pottery produced enjoys extremely high local esteem, as evidenced by the new building opened in 1996 at Eskbank House Museum in Lithgow specially to house its collection of pottery from this site. Although the pottery was in fact of minor economic significance and survived for only twenty years on a site used for other clay products for 69 years, its products are visible and collectable where pipes, chimney pots, tiles and bricks have for the most part remained functional and less well regarded. As an aspect of Lithgow Valley Colliery, the most long-lived of all Lithgow enterprises, the clay products division offered employment and company facilities (such as quoiting) which were a significant part of Lithgow life for a century. Lithgow Valley Colliery & Pottery Site was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

Baba Mukhteshwar Puri was 4th saint of the Kosli math. He lived in 12th century A.D. and practiced meditation throughout his life, which bestowed him with great vision and divine power. The enlightened soul is also called Gusai ji(‡§ó‡•Å‡§∏‡§æ‡§à‡§Ç ‡§ú‡•Ä ). All communities in & around Kosli still worship him. He is the prime deity of ‡§ï‡•ã‡§∏‡§≤‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ Kausaliya Yadav people, who are descendants of Kaushal/Kosal Dev Singh. Early life Baba Mukhteshwar Puri Ji Maharaj was born in 1130 AD in Daboda village, under Bahadurgarh Tehsil in the Jhajjhar District. He was born in a Brahmin family and his childhood name was Mukund Ram. His mother was a religious women & he too showed great inclination towards Bhakti & Dharma since very beginning. Aged 5, he was sent to his Nana‚Äôs Home in Bijana/Beejna village. His Nana (maternal Grandfather) was a very learned scholar of Vedas and he fondly educated Mukund Ram. Mukund discovered that he wants to become a Yogi as worldly pleasures didn‚Äôt appealed him. He left home to join the company of saints. Mukund Ram reached Puri Math in Kosli in 1143 AD and become a disciple of Rajpuri ji Maharaj. Upon acquiring complete knowledge from his Guru he was designated the fourth mahant under title Mukhteshwar Puri in 1165 AD. He was aged 35 then and did Tap (tough religious undergoings) for 54 Years. Brahmins from Beejna village are Purohits of Kosaliya people. People of Daboda, Bahadurgarh also acknowledge Baba Mukhteshwar Puri as their descendant. Foundation of Matha  Saint Krishna/Santosh Puri, who came from Uttrakhand to this place (present day Kosli) at around 1000 AD established the monastery/matha tradition at Baba Mukteshwar Puri, Kosli under the Trademark & Evergreen Hins/Heens tree (Capparis sepiaria) in Kosli. Wild animals like Lions, Tigers, Fox, wolf, Reptiles were the inhabitants of the Jungle at that time. Shri Krishna Puri fearlessly meditated in harmony with Nature. He was followed & succeeded by Durga/Prahlad Puri, Rajpuri/Parmanand Puri & Mukhteshwar Puri respectively. In 1193, after the battles of Tarahin, Kaushal Singh & Laxmi Devi came helplessly near his math & asked for help. The holy soul Baba Mukhteshwar Puri, Kosli blessed the Kaushal/Kosal Dev Singh family & the events led to the establishment of Kosli and Baba Mukhteshwar Puri, Kosli math in 1225 AD. Legend King Anangpal Tomar ruled Delhi from 1130 AD to 1170 AD. His Kingdom included Kannauj, Gajni, Sultana, Patan, Jaipur, Shekhawati, Ramdevra. He had 2 daughters Sur Sundari and Kirtimalini/Kamla. When Anangpal became old, he decided to handover the kingdoms under his reign to his relatives and trustable court Nobles. He handed over the Delhi & Kannauj throwns to his Grandsons Prithviraj Chauhan & Jaichand respectively. Patan (lies between Narnaul and Neem Ka Thana in Rajasthan) was given to loyal brothers: Sulen Singh and Ushna(‡§ä‡§∑‡•ç‡§£)/Kesri Singh. Rao Kaushal singh was born to Kesri Singh. But gradually the feuds between the brothers became violent over the matters of kingship. Consequences led Kesri Singh, his wife Kausalya Devi & their son Kaushal Singh to leave from Patan‚Äôs Royal Home to avoid family confrontation. They lived in exile for many years. One day, they received message of Prithviraj Chauhan which asked for support from fellow kings to fight unitedly against Muhammad of Ghor who had attacked Delhi. Kesari singh decided to stood up for his motherland in the hour of adversity. They first reached the residence of Raja Dilip Singh (father of Kausalya) in Delhi. Dilip Singh introduced beautiful, educated, able and dynamic Kosal Dev Singh (aged 16) to Thakur Jaswant Singh. Jaswant Singh was impressed with Kaushal singh and married her daughter Laxmi Devi with Kaushal Singh. Battle of Tarain, 1192 AD & afterwards Then Second Battle of Tarain followed in which Kesri Singh and Kaushal Singh fought for Prithviraj Chauhan against the Muhammad Ghori. It was one of the greatest & Landmark battle in the History of India. After massive Bloodshed, Hindu rulers led by Prithviraj Chauhan got defeated. Maharaj Kesari went missing or was dead. The invaders exploited the Hindus, their wealth and their religious shrines. It is mentioned in Prithviraj Raso. Thakur Jaswant Singh asked his pregnant daughter Laxmi Devi and son-in-law Kaushal singh to leave from Delhi immediately and gave them ownership of 45 villages in Dowry. Kaushal Dev singh and Laxmi Devi exhibited bravery and reached the designated intense Forest 40 km south of Jhajjar. There were wild animals like Tiger, Bears, Monkeys and shrubs with thrones. With great courage and amid difficulties Laxmi Devi gave birth to a boy at midnight. The Chandravanshi couple became happy and recognized the presence of a divine power in the vicinity. Meeting with Baba Mukteshwar Puri Kosal Dev Singh looked nearby for Water in the dense forest after the birth of his son. He noticed fire light and smoke coming from a direction. He moved ahead considering it a good omen. An ash smeared saint was meditating under a Heens Tree in that Jungle. Kaushal Dev singh was astonished and pleased. He bowed to this saint Baba Mukhteshwar Puri. The saint asked the King about his identity and purpose to visit here. Kaushal Dev Singh narrated the entire story of war and exile and asked for shelter. At the crack of dawn (sunrise), Baba Mukteshwar Puri did Shanknaad as usual. He blessed Rao Kaushal Dev Singh, his escort Kausalya and newborn baby. Baba Mukteshwar named the newborn as Mohan Dev Singh because he was born in midnight like Lord Krishna. Laxmi Devi offered Shawl to the spiritual leader. 3 Boons & Further Development Baba Mukteshwar Puri gave three boons to Kaushal Dev Singh in 1193AD. First, establish a settlement here. It will be a big town consequently. Nobody will be able to challenge you. Second, your clans will see a unprecedented Growth. Third, the glory of your brave clan will propel in all directions. The sage asked Kaushal Dev Singh to be confident and Hard working and also warned him to be aware of water and fire calamities. In this area Kaushal singh established Kosli/Kaushalgarh with the blessings of Baba Mukteshwar Puri in 1193 AD. The clan of Rao Kaushal Singh have Kosaliya gotra and Yadav caste. Kaushal Singh and his wife Laxmi Devi made their settlement in the forest i.e present day Kosli. The couple was Educated, Brave, adorable & Hard- working. For earning livelihood they removed nearby shrubs and started engaging in Horticulture and Animal Husbandry. The tough days passed and the boundaries & population of Kosli flourished. In 1225 AD, Kaushal Dev Singh announced that Kosli is his throne & glory of Baba Mukteshwar Puri increased further. Good upbringing of son Mohan Dev was ensured & subsequently he was married to Veermati who was from nearby village. Matha establishment: A small monastery/math in the honour of Baba Mukteshwar Puri was also built at the same place where the saint used to meditated under auspicious Heens ‡§π‡•Ä‡§Ç‡§∏ tree. Kaushal Dev Singh vowed that he and his generations will always be worshippers & maintain the sacredness of Matha Baba Mukteshwar Puri, Kosli. 825 have passed and the promise is cheerfully observed till this date. Kosaliya gotra people from all across the India & abroad worship Baba Mukteshwar Puri Maharaj. Youths offer their 1st salary in respect. Ahirwal soldiers and officers in Indian Army acknowledge Baba Mukteshwar Puri. Social Importance & Teachings After Muslim rulers invaded India under Muhumad Gori in 1193 AD, the nation was under great turmoil. The locals including women were cruelly exploited. Wealth was drained and Hindu Temples were destructed preposterously. People left their native places and took shelter in nearby forests and mountains. Hundreds of sages like Baba Mukteshwar Puri were guiding light to society as they contained & transferred the traditional knowledge, Vedas & moral values to next generations. Baba Mukteshwar Puri believed in Peace, Brotherhood & Truth. He believed that inner enlightenment is the eternal bliss. Meditation provokes the spiritual energy which gives us soothing qualities like Positivity, prosperity, Strength and Peace. These parameters aligns/connects our Body-Mind-Soul to the Supreme deity which is the true Wealth. Om sound is humming spontaneously in the Universe and the creature of all is ever Benevolent & helpful. Everybody is sent by God to this earth with a purpose. One should discover his duties & responsibilities through all the delusions & disarray. Fairs It is believed that Baba Mukteshwar puri is immortal in his Samadhi. Newly wed couples and new born babies of Kosli and Kosaliya gotra visit Baba Mukhteshwar Puri Math with devotion. The Kosli people credit Baba for their prosperity & Harmony. Rot- Churma(‡§∞‡•ã‡§ü-‡§ö‡•Ç‡§∞‡§Æ‡§æ), Dahi(curd), Flag is offered to the sage. In Kosli Math, Shakkar(‡§∂‡§ï‡•ç‡§ï‡§∞ ) Prasada is distributed and turmeric teeka(‡§π‡§≤‡•ç‡§¶‡•Ä ‡§ü‡•Ä‡§ï‡§æ) is applied on the forehead of devotees who come from nearby towns and far states also. Fairs/mela is organised in the Baba Mukhteshwat Puri, Kosli during Holi and 14 Sep every year. Committee To look into the administrative matters of Baba Mukteshwar Puri Matha a committee was formed 23 December 2007. It was registered as ‚ÄúBaba Mukhteshwar Puri Math Adarsh Samiti‚Äù Kosli, Rewari, Haryana. The campus of holy shrine was enlarged in 2008. The 86 feet tall Gumbad, new rooms, railing near Heens tree, efficient water arrangements, Clean and planned Gardens, toilets, new Hall, etc were built by the Adarsh Samiti. A Book titled \\"History of Kosli and Kosaliya gotra & Glory of Baba Mukhteshwar Puri\\" has been published in 2017 by the Native Kausaliya Ahirs/Yadav people.

The arms are a differenced version of those of de Clare, the senior branch of the family. John FitzWalter, 2nd Baron FitzWalter (Fitzwalter or Fitz Wauter; 131518 October 1361) was a prominent Essex landowner best known for his criminal activities, particularly around Colchester. His family was of a noble and ancient lineage, with connections to the powerful de Clare family, who had arrived in England at the time of the Norman conquest of England. The FitzWalters held estates across Essex, as well as properties in London and Norfolk. John FitzWalter played a prominent role during the early years of King Edward III's wars in France, and at some point FitzWalter was married to Eleanor Percy, the daughter of Henry, Lord Percy. FitzWalter built a strong affinity around him, mainly from among leading members of the county's gentry, but also including men from elsewhere, such as a Norfolk parson. At their head, FitzWalter waged an armed campaign against the neighbouring town of Colchester, almost from the moment he reached adulthood. The townsmen seem to have exacerbated the dispute by illegally entering FitzWalter's park in Lexden; in return, FitzWalter banned them from one of their own watermills and then, in 1342, he besieged the town, preventing anyone entering or leaving for some weeks, as well as ransacking much property and destroying the market. One historian has described him, in his activities, as the medieval equivalent of a 20th-century American racketeer. Other victims of his Essex gang were local jurors, royal officials, a man forced to abjure the realm, and the prior of Little Dunmow Abbey. FitzWalter intermittently returned to France and the war, but notwithstanding his royal service‚Äîhe also served on the royal council and attended parliament regularly‚Äîhe never held office in his county. Historians explain this as being due to his repeated defiance of the king's peace and his deliberate usurpation of the royal authority. FitzWalter was too powerful, and too aggressive in defence of his rights, for the local populace to confront him in court, and it was not until 1351 that he was finally brought to justice. The King despatched a royal commission to Chelmsford to investigate a broad range of social ills, among which was FitzWalter and his gang. Although most of his force received little or no punishment, FitzWalter himself was arrested and sent to London; he was immediately imprisoned in the Marshalsea. He then languished in the Tower of London for over a year until the King agreed to pardon him. FitzWalter was released and restored to his estates, but only on the condition that he buy the lands back from the King for the immense sum of over ¬£800. FitzWalter died in 1361‚Äîstill paying off his fine‚Äîleaving a son, Walter, as his heir. Lady FitzWalter had predeceased him; they were both buried in Dunmow Priory. Historians have considered FitzWalter's criminality as illustrating how the disorder that pervaded the 15th century had its origins in the 14th. Although historians have generally considered his activities to demonstrate King Edward III's failure to maintain law and order, as FitzWalter's downfall demonstrates, royal justice could be firm when it chose, if not always swift.  Early life  Map of the Hundreds of Essex. With Lexden highlighted, the approximate locations of principal FitzWalter manors are shown. The FitzWalter family was a wealthy and long-established family in the north-Essex area. Descended from the conquest-era Lords of Clare, the family held estates concentrated around the lordship of Dunmow. They also held estates as distant as Woodham to the south east of the county, Chigwell to the south west, Diss in Norfolk, and Castle Baynard in London. John FitzWalter was the son (probably the only son) of Sir Robert FitzWalter and Joan, daughter of Thomas, Lord Moulton. The family has been described as \\"warlike as well as rich\\" even before FitzWalter was born: his ancestor, also named Robert, had been a leading rebel against King John in the early 13th century. John FitzWalter was around 13 years old when his father died in 1328. The medievalist Christopher Starr in his Oxford Dictionary of National Biography entry on the FitzWalter family, suggests that John was raised by his widowed mother. This may have turned him into \\"a difficult and dangerous adult\\". Although by law he could not receive his inheritance until he was 21, in the event, King Edward III allowed him to enter into his estates and titles slightly early, in 1335, when FitzWalter was about 20. FitzWalter received livery of two-thirds of his inheritance, the remainder being held by his mother as her dower. This, says Starr, \\"represented a significant slice of the FitzWalter estate\\", and a wish to augment his wealth may have contributed to FitzWalter's later criminal behaviour. He encountered financial difficulty in London over lands which his grandfather, Robert, had transferred as fine land in 1275 to help found Blackfriars Abbey. Robert had reserved his rights to certain other city properties. This reservation was successfully challenged by the city authorities, and both Robert and John repeatedly attempted to assert their claim. According to the Elizabethan antiquarian John Stow, the last time the latter attempted this in 1347, FitzWalter's demands were \\"peremptorily\\" refused by the mayor and Common Council. The FitzWalter family was also traditionally responsible for the defence of the city. In a time of war, the then-Baron FitzWalter was to attend St Paul's Cathedral with a force of 19 knights. There he would receive the city's banner under which London's soldier-citizens would march with him. Caroline Barron, a historian of Medieval London, says that while this may be a \\"fanciful tale\\", it paid FitzWalter ¬£20 per annum for the privilege. By the 14th century, though, the city had an established militia and the city authorities no longer deemed the position relevant, and they revoked FitzWalter's privileges and payment. Notwithstanding these financial troubles, as a prominent Essex estate holder, the medievalist Gloria Harris suggests that \\"with youth, power and wealth, FitzWalter was the 'rich kid' of his day\\" in Essex society.  Royal service and war in France  Diplomatic relations between England and France had been tempestuous for some years, and in 1337 crisis broke out when the king of France, Philip VI, confiscated the Duchy of Aquitaine, then a possession of English kings. In response, King Edward invaded France, thus beginning the Hundred Years' War. Harris has described the young men of FitzWalter's class and generation as being \\"untapped pools of genteel manpower\\", manpower which the King was determined to exploit. FitzWalter was summoned alongside 43 other Essex knights to muster in Ipswich in December 1338. Armed and ready to fight, FitzWalter joined the retinue of William de Bohun, who had recently been created Earl of Northampton. FitzWalter gained a reputation as a good soldier during Edward III's early campaigns, and he periodically returned to fight in France over the course of his career. In 1346, for example, no longer serving under Northampton, he served with the Prince of Wales, with whom FitzWalter indentured to serve for six months at a wage of 100 marks. In return he brought the Prince 20 men-at-arms (himself, four other knights and 15 esquires) and 12 archers. As part of the Black Prince's vanguard FitzWalter fought at the Siege of Calais in 1346. He was by now an experienced soldier and had been made a knight banneret. He was still on campaign in France in 1348, by which time he had returned to Northampton's service. FitzWalter frequently returned to England to attend parliament. He was first summoned as Johannes de fitz Wauter in 1340, and was to attend every session for the next 20 years. He was also a royal councillor, having been appointed in 1341 and serving in that capacity until 1358. In 1342 FitzWalter was one of 250 knights to take part in a great tournament held at Dustable, alongside his later partner in crime, Sir Robert Marney. At some point in his career, FitzWalter married Eleanor, second daughter of Henry Percy, Lord Percy. They had at least two children, Walter, his heir, and a daughter Alice (d. 11 May 1400). Alice married Aubrey de Vere, 10th Earl of Oxford, although it is unknown whether this was during her father's lifetime.  Criminal career  National Archives, document SC 8/311/15549: Petition of John, Baron FitzWalter to the king, . Although faded, FitzWalter is complaining to the king and council that the law is unclear regarding whom one holds escheated lands that have been granted in fee simple, when they were previously held by a lord who has forfeited them. FitzWalter requests clarity on this point of law, and the king endorses it. The Historian Margaret Hastings described FitzWalter as being of \\"good family and great possessions, but nonetheless a familiar racketeer type\\". Starr suggests that for many men of his generation, experience on the Scottish and then French fronts exacerbated a \\"natural appetite for aggression and intimidation\\". Essex gentry and their affinities had been at the forefront of Edward I's Gascon campaigns of the late-13th century, and by the early 14th century Essex society was a highly militarized one. These factors, says Starr, probably contributed to FitzWalter's increasingly violent behaviour, and by 1340 he was launched on a career of crime during which he terrorised the county. The medieval scholar Ian Mortimer, in what the Washington Post reviewer Aaron Leitko called a \\"Fodor's-style\\" book‚ÄîThe Time Traveller's Guide to Medieval England‚Äîsays of FitzWalter \\"nor do you want to come up against\\" him. In 1340, FitzWalter took part in an incursion of John de Segrave's manor in Great Chesterford. FitzWalter was in a gang of more than thirty men led by the Earl of Oxford: Segrave later reported that FitzWalter and his associates \\"broke his park... hunted therein, carried away his goods and his deer from the park, and assaulted his men and servants\\". FitzWalter gathered his own affinity of prominent local gentry around him. They included such figures as Lionel Bradenham‚Äîsteward of FitzWalter's Lexden manor, and who held the manor of Langenhoe from FitzWalter for knight's service‚Äîand Robert Marney. Marney, like FitzWalter, was a seasoned soldier from the French wars and something of a gangster in his own right. With the support of powerful and influential local men like these, FitzWalter earned himself \\"a considerable reputation... as a thug of the first order\\", and the most feared man in Essex, wrote Harris. The names of many of FitzWalter's gangsters are known to historians by the survival of their later indictments. They include Walter Althewelde, William Baltrip, John Brekespere, John Burlee, John Clerke, Thomas Garderober, William Saykin, Roger Scheep, John Stacey and William de Wyborne. Another, known only as Roger, was the parson of Osemondiston. In return for furthering FitzWalter's causes, his retainers could expect his full protection: on at least one occasion he broke one of his men, Wymarcus Heirde, out of Colchester gaol before he could be brought before the justices. Heirde had been attached and imprisoned at the berestake by the bailiffs of Colchester, but before they could begin proceedings FitzWalter despatched \\"Simon Spryng' and others\\" to free Heirde with force of arms. The later indictments list FitzWalter's litany of crimes. He took illegal distraints. He behaved as he liked, it was reported, \\"to his poor neighbours, because no sheriff or bailiff dared to free any distraint which he had taken, be it ever so unjust\\". He also indulged in extortion. On one occasion he extorted 100 shillings from two men in Southminster. On another, FitzWalter persuaded one Walter of Mucking to transfer lands worth ¬£40 a year to FitzWalter, for which FitzWalter was to pay Walter an annual rent of ¬£22. FitzWalter also pledged to provide Walter with luxurious robes and tunics in kind. In the event, FitzWalter not only paid hardly any rent but refused to hand over the clothes he had promised. Walter of Mucking dared not take legal action against FitzWalter. Few men did. For example, Richard de Plescys, Prior of Dunmow Priory, was intimidated into storing and looking after a cart and horses of FitzWalter's, at the prior's own expense. The prior did not report FitzWalter, despite the fact that his house, at least in theory, enjoyed the king's personal protection. FitzWalter later despatched his henchman Baltrip to forcibly and illegally amerce and distrain the prior. Cattle rustling was an important pastime of the FitzWalter gang as it was a major source of revenue. They seized cattle from Colchester's main monastic house, the Priory of St. John, for which the prior later denounced FitzWalter as \\"a common destroyer of men of religion\\". In this particular case, FitzWalter treated the priory's cattle extremely poorly: they were either worked to death or left to starve. For two years, he also illegally pastured his own sheep and cattle on common land used by the town's burgess, which abutted his own Lexden Park estate. FitzWalter's gang were also responsible for killings. In 1345, one Roger Byndethese was sentenced at Waltham to abjuration of the realm. As part of his sentence, he was to carry a large cross from Waltham to Dover, where he was to sail from. He never reached the port: intercepted by FitzWalter's men outside Waltham, they‚Äîclaiming to act \\"under the banner of God and of Holy Church\\", but actually at the command of their lord‚Äîsummarily beheaded Byndethese by the roadside. Larceny was also much favoured by the gang. One method was to force men to enfeoff FitzWalter and his band with their possessions, who would then have to be paid off before returning the goods. Similarly, FitzWalter confiscated sacks of wool from a Burnham-on-Crouch merchant which they refused to return until he paid them a substantial sum. FitzWalter and his men regularly looted all the fish, meat and victuals they required from Colchester doing so \\"at their will, to the oppression of the whole market\\". They repeatedly violated the town's rules of trade, both inside and outside the marketplace. Such was the fear FitzWalter was held in, that when he refused to pay what he had been assessed for a royal tax‚Äîeven though he had intimidated the tax assessor into rating him for the lowest amount possible‚Äîthe \\"men of the villages paid for him to their great impoverishment\\". He had, after all, threatened to break the legs and arms (\\"tibia et bracchia\\") and leave to die anyone who refused to do so. = Siege of Colchester = A portion of Lexden Park, seen in 2016. The small portion that remains of FitzWalter's estate is now a nature reserve. The FitzWalter family had long had turbulent relations with their Colchester neighbours. In 1312, townsmen and merchants had broken into Lexden Park and hunted Robert FitzWalter's deer. The principal source of antagonism between the two parties was over disputed pasture rights in Lexden, and the area was the scene of many confrontations and assaults from both sides. FitzWalter, in turn, denied the jurisdiction of Colchester burgesses there and prevented the town from taxing his tenantry on the estate. There was also repeated friction over a watermill adjacent to FitzWalter's Lexden Park. Although owned by Colchester men, FitzWalter objected to the presence of any men from the town near his property and refused them entry to their own mill for over six months. The townspeople later complained that, although FitzWalter had, at some point, offered to buy it from them, \\"Lord John has not paid for it and still keeps it\\". Further, to ensure a constant supply of water for his mill, FitzWalter evicted the owner of another watermill in nearby West Bergholt to use it as a backup for his own; the mill's owner was also a townsman of Colchester. FitzWalter's grievances against the men of Colchester may not have been without foundation. In 1342, claimed FitzWalter, Colchester men had invaded Lexden Park, in an attempt to assert their own rights of pasturing, hunting and fishing there. The medievalist Richard Britnell has highlighted how \\"on this issue feelings ran sufficiently high for large numbers of burgesses to take the law into their own hands; pasture riots are more in evidence than any other form of civil disturbance\\" in Essex at this time. Britnell also notes, though, that it is unlikely that anyone held rights to common pasture on the Lexden estate. FitzWalter petitioned the king that about a hundred Colchester men had, in the course of their trespass, \\"broke [FitzWalter's] park at Lexden, hunted therein, felled his trees, fished in his stews, carried away the trees and fish as well as deer from the park and assaulted his servant John Osekyn there, whereby he lost his service for a great time\\". Lexden Park was one of FitzWalter's most valuable possessions, consisting of over of pasture, which in 1334 had been valued for tax purposes at over ¬£1,300. In July a commission of oyer and terminer was sent to Essex to investigate FitzWalter's complaints. A crisis point was reached when one of FitzWalter's men was killed during another attack on Lexden Park. An inquest was held in Colchester, but FitzWalter disputed its findings. Instead‚Äîand in breach of the borough's liberties which allowed it to administer its own internal affairs‚ÄîFitzWalter brought in the county coroner (probably one of his own retainers) to perform another inquest. Neither inquest appears to have satisfied the parties involved. FitzWalter attempted to have a bailiff of Colchester, John Fordham, indicted for the death, but to no avail. FitzWalter reacted violently to the death of his man, doubtless encouraged by previous attacks on Lexden and the injuries to Osekyn. Now he began to hunt down members of both inquest juries and beat them up. The first victim was Henry Fernerd of Copford, a juryman who had publicly expressed his faith in Fordham's innocence. FitzWalter's men beat him nearly to death. FitzWalter soon widened his attacks to Colchester tenantry more generally, seeking them out as far afield as Maldon and Southminster. FitzWalter then escalated his attacks on individuals to the town itself, and on 20 May 1342 placed Colchester under an armed siege. He ambushed anyone caught entering or leaving the town, \\"until no man [could] go to a market or fair from Easter until Whitsuntide\\". FitzWalter and his men barricaded the roads with wood from the broken doors and roof beams of houses they had destroyed. His physical campaign against the townsmen was accompanied by legal attacks, in which he attempted to fix juries against them. FitzWalter's siege lasted until 22 July, when the burghers paid FitzWalter ¬£40 compensation. This did not bring peace between them: FitzWalter again besieged the town from 7April to 1June the following year. This may have been provoked by continuing incursions by the town onto his Lexden estate. He was paid another ¬£40 to lift this siege, and those who attempted to sue for the damage he and his men had caused found that local juries were too afraid to bring verdicts against FitzWalter and his gang. Not only did the gang fully support their lord, its members often carried out their own operations in the knowledge of his protection. For example, Bradenham himself besieged Colchester for three months in autumn 1350. The country had been ravaged by the Black Death in 1348, and Partington suggests that this was the catalyst for the King to take action against FitzWalter. Society had been unsettled by the disease, and Edward \\"was determined that lords should be made to look to their responsibilities to the realm\\". = Indictment = Essex, Jennifer Ward has written, \\"suffered severely\\" from the FitzWalter gang's activities throughout the 1340s. It was difficult for justice to be done, though, and was to take nearly ten years. During that time he effectively usurped the king's writ in the north of the county. This forced the role of keeping the king's peace upon him, with what has been described as a \\"rival system of justice\\" to that of the crown. FitzWalter's expeditions to France‚Äîwhich periodically removed him from the theatre of conflict‚Äîwere deliberate attempts by King Edward at solving the problem without a need for taking legal action. This was an impermanent solution. Eventually, in response to FitzWalter's continuing outrages, a commission of the peace, probably under the authority of William Shareshull, was despatched to Chelmsford early in 1351. As a result, writes the scholar Elizabeth C. Furber, \\"justice, of a sort, finally caught up\\" with FitzWalter. Shareshull's commission indicted FitzWalter for failing to appear to answer accusations of felony. Thus outlawed, FitzWalter was judged guilty of multiple serious crimes, such as extortion and refusal to pay taxes. His fundamental offence, says Ward, was \\"encroaching on the royal power\\". FitzWalter's indictment roll, notes Margaret Hastings, listed so many offences that it \\"read like an index to the record of indictment for a whole county\\". On 31 January 1351, the King summoned FitzWalter by a writ of capias and he appeared before the King's Bench at Westminster Palace. Found guilty, he was cast into Marshalsea Prison and his estates confiscated. In November, FitzWalter was transferred to the Tower of London, where he was allocated ten shillings a day from his estates for his subsistence. FitzWalter, says the historian Mark Ormrod, had been \\"publicly discredited\\". The King not only wanted Essex to return to a state of peace, he also intended to make an example of FitzWalter to the nobility generally. The King, he argues, \\"expected his beneficiaries to observe standards of behaviour more acceptable to him and to the political community\\". Likewise, argues the medievalist Richard Partington, \\"Edward's anger was especially terrifying in cases where he believed nobles were abusing their position to oppress others\\". The King also did not, it seems, take FitzWalter's earlier loyal service in France into account when weighing up FitzWalter's punishment. Some, although not all, of FitzWalter's associates were also convicted. Marney and Bradenham were imprisoned and fined (and later released) with their lord. The parson was forced to give up his benefice. Others were either pardoned‚Äîin at least one case following military service in Brittany‚Äîor exigented. Some were exonerated outright. Only one minor member of the gang, William de Wyborne, was hanged for his crimes; his chattels‚Äîworth 40d‚Äîwere confiscated. FitzWalter was imprisoned for a year, and following his release in June 1352, the King pardoned him. The pardon was a substantial document, and covered murder, robbery, rape, arson, kidnapping, trespass, extortion and incitement, and ranged from thefbote and illegally carrying off other's rabbits to the usurpation of royal justice. medieval priory, whose prior FitzWalter terrorised and where he and his wife were buried. FitzWalter was also bound to pay Edward the \\"colossal\\" amount of (at least) ¬£847 2s 4d; this he paid off incrementally. In doing so, FitzWalter effectively bought his estates back from the King. Indeed, the size of the fine‚Äîwhich he spent the last decade of his life paying‚Äîis probably the only reason his estates were returned to him in the first place. For ten years, comments Barbara Hanawalt, the pipe rolls \\"benignly enter payments to the king from his 'dear and faithful' John FitzWalter\\".  Later life  Probably as a direct consequence of his violent behaviour in Essex, and although he sat in parliament and on the king's council, he never held royal office in the county, and nor was he appointed to any of its commissions. FitzWalter died on 18 October 1361, and was buried alongside his wife and ancestors in Dunmow Priory. Eleanor had predeceased him, although not, apparently, by long. His mother survived him, still controlling a third of his estate. On the day of FitzWalter's death, one farthing remained owing to the crown from his fine a decade earlier. He was succeeded in his estates and titles by his son Walter, who had been born in 1345 (\\"at the height\\", says Starr, \\"of his father's criminal activities\\"). Walter, unlike his father, was to be a loyal servant of the crown and helped to suppress the Peasants' Revolt in Essex for King Richard II in 1381. Walter was also to be a close ally of his brother-in-law the Earl of Oxford in the politically turbulent years towards the end of Richard's reign. The criminal activities and disregard for the law demonstrated by men such as John FitzWalter, says Elisabeth Kimball, suggests that \\"the lack of governance associated with fifteenth-century England seems to have had its roots in the fourteenth\\". FitzWalter, argues the historian G. L. Harriss, was fundamentally \\"flawed in character\\" and from his youth had been on a \\"downward spiral of violence which brought the withdrawal of lordly and neighbourhood protection\\" both by the crown and by the rest of the local gentry. Characters such as FitzWalter have traditionally been seen by historians as demonstrating Edward III's poor record with law and order; on the other hand, suggests Ormrod, although royal justice may have been delayed, it was still sure, and when it came, harsh.

It promotes the opening of voltage-gated Na channels (Nav) in German cockroach (Blattella germanica) by interacting with the paddle motif in domain II.  Etymology and chemical structure  Dc1a contains two Œ≤-sheets and one Œ≤-hairpin loop whereas the sheets are held together by four disulphide bonds. Three of these four disulphide bonds form a classical cysteine knot region (ICK). ICK region is common in spider toxins and provides chemical, thermal and biological stability to the protein. Although this region is evolutionary conserved in the spiders family, it has remarkable differences with other ICK-like proteins. One of the special characteristics is that Dc1a contains an additional disulphide bond that links cysteine 42 with cysteine 45 and stabilizes the serine-rich hairpin loop. Another feature is a unique three-standard antiparallel Œ≤-sheet in the amino-terminal region which is formed by an unusually large loop between cysteine 26 and cysteine 40. This difference in structure creates a spatial separation between the ICK domain and the rest of the protein, leaving the charged residues more exposed. However, clusters of hydrophobic residues that could potentially interact with lipid bilayers have not been found.Bende, N. S., Dziemborowicz, S., Mobli, M., Herzig, V., Gilchrist, J., Wagner, J., ... & Bosmans, F. (2014). A distinct sodium channel voltage-sensor locus determines insect selectivity of the spider toxin Dc1a. Nature Communications, 5, 4350.  Target and mode of action  In 1996, Bloomquist et al. conducted experiments to investigate the action mechanisms of Dc1a on fleshfly (Sarcophaga bullata), housefly (Musca domestica) larvae.Bloomquist, J. R., Kinne, L. P., Deutsch, V., & Simpson, S. F. (1996). Mode of action of an insecticidal peptide toxin from the venom of a weaving spider (Diguetia canities). Toxicon, 34(9), 1072-1075. They observed that Dc1a injection caused hyperexcitability in both neuromuscular junction and sensory cells and elevated spike charges. Recent studies have shown that the toxin has only lethal effects on German cockroach (B.germanica) and not on American cockroach (Periplaneta americana). Dc1a acts as a gating modifier. It shifts the voltage dependent activation to more negative values by interacting with domain II in the paddle motifs of the voltage sensing area of Nav channels. As a consequence, Na channels will already open at more negative potentials. Although German and American cockroaches are closely related, they have different kinds of domain II: serine 1 and 2 in Nav channels of the German cockroach form a more accessible angle for the toxin to interact with the channel. No effects have been found on vertebrate Nav channels, which might be useful in the production of new insecticides.  Toxicity  American cockroach (P.americana) Nav channels are resistant to the toxin's effects because of the different structure in domain II on its Nav channels. Even with relevantly high doses of Dc1a, P.americana has minor contractions in abdominal muscles and reversible reduced motor activity. On the other hand, Dc1a is lethal for the German cockroach (B.germanica) and it induces dose-dependent paralysis 8 hours after injection. KD50 value of Dc1a is 3.0 ¬± 1.2 nmol/g and LD50 value of Dc1a is 4.2 ¬± 3.4 nmol/g for B.germanica. Human Nav channels are insensitive to Dc1a.

Etymology The name Shia originates from the activities of the Forebears of Shia who were particularly brave and so decided to carry out an act of knowing the content of an item and in the process tore open the item. The noise that emanated from the process was used to describe the people who had engaged in that act. The noise was shiiaaa and so the people were identified as the Shia people.. Location Shia is a town in Ghana within the Volta Region of Ghana. It is located about 16 Kilometers from Ho the regionals capital of the Volta region. It is to the east of Ho and is a border town between Ghana and Togo. It is within the Ho district and resides in the Shia-Ave constituency for electoral purposes. It is one of three border towns within the eastern Ho corridor. History The Shia people were part of the Original Ewe people who originated from Nutsie in Nigeria and travel all the way through Benin, Togo, through the Keta and Anlo areas and finally settle in the Ho surrounding areas. The Shia people in particular settled at Taviefe where they were for several years and only moved to their present location after some disagreement with colleagues about the content of product which resulted in them splitting the item into two which ultimately resulted in them being forced to vacate the community to their present day place. Climate The Climate of Shia is a forest area with rainfall patterns similar to that of Ho. It lies 153 millimeters above sea level. It has a tropical climate. The average annual temperature is 26.8 degrees Celsius. It has about three active seasons; Rainfall Season, Mix of autumn and spring season and Harmattan season. Administration Shia is in the Ho District and has Ho as the district capital. Shia is also part of the Norvisi Traditional area made of 11 communities who decided to be together for purposes of unity and development. Demographics The town has a population of about 2000 inhabitants. There are more women and children than men. The population split is guessed at 60/40 split in favour of women Migration There has been significant migration of the people of Shia to the cities. The main cities that have benefitted from the skills of the people of Shia are Accra, Kumasi and Ho. There has also been the migration of Shia people abroad. It is estimated there would be over 100 Shia person domiciled abroad. Housing The community was communally developed. The houses are well spaced with cleared streets etc. Economy The Economy is agrarian and some minimal commercial activities that are mainly driven by the activities at the Ghana Togo border. Primary sector The primary sector is Agriculture Education There are a number of schools from Pre-schools through to Jss and Secondary school. There is however no tertiary school in the community. Healthcare There is one active Health Clinic in the community that takes care of the people. Infrastructure There is a motorable road to the community. The road is tarred and leads from Ho and ends at Shia. T Transportation There are taxis and buses that ply the road to Shia. The private sector provides regular active transportation. Sport Shia had an active football club call Shia mighty warriors. Unfortunately due to administrative challenges the club is not so active. Places of worship There are a lot of active Orthodox, evangelical, Pentecostal and Charismatic churches Churches include Catholic Church, Evangelical Presbyterian church, Assemblies of God Church, Pentecost Church, Christ is the same Church, Light House Church and Global Evangelical Presbyterian church. Culture The Culture of the people is built on the general culture of the Ewe people of Ghana. The Shia people are humanist in nature. Their activities are communal in they are each other‚Äôs keeper. The family structures are built around the extended family structures. Shia houses a Senior High and Technical School, a second cycle institution that was admitted by the Ghana Education Service in 2010.

The whirlwind campaign took place between August and November 1345 in Gascony, an English-controlled territory in south-west France. Derby, commanding an Anglo-Gascon force, oversaw the first successful English land campaign of the war. He twice defeated large French armies in battle, taking many noble and knightly prisoners. They were ransomed by their captors, greatly enriching Derby and his soldiers in the process. Following this campaign, morale and prestige swung England's way in the border region between English-occupied Gascony and French-ruled territory, providing an influx of taxes and recruits for the English armies. As a result, France's ability to raise tax money and troops from the region was much reduced. Ralph, Earl of Stafford, had sailed for Gascony in February 1345 with an advance force and, following conventional practice, laid siege to two French strongholds. Derby arrived in August and immediately concentrated available Anglo-Gascon forces and headed directly for the largest French force, which was gathering at Bergerac, east of Bordeaux. Bergerac had good river supply links to Bordeaux and would provide a suitable forward base from which to carry the war to the French. He decisively defeated the French there, before moving to besiege the provincial capital of P√©rigueux. By this time the French had diverted their main effort to the south-west, under the overall command of John, Duke of Normandy, the son and heir apparent of King Philip VI of France. Unable to take P√©rigueux, and threatened by John's much larger force, Derby left garrisons blockading it and withdrew. One garrison, at Auberoche, was besieged by the French. Derby advanced with a small force, launched a surprise attack against the much larger French army and won another decisive victory. The French army started to disintegrate: men were unpaid, even unfed; there was a lack of fodder for the horses; desertion was rife; and troops were selling their equipment. John lost heart on hearing of the defeat at Auberoche. The French abandoned all of their ongoing sieges of other Anglo- Gascon garrisons and retreated to Angoul√™me, where John disbanded his army, possibly because the French had run out of money. Derby moved back to the Garonne valley, captured the strong and well garrisoned town of La R√©ole, all of the French outposts downstream of it, and other strong French positions in the area. In November Derby paid off his army and overwintered in La R√©ole. Various small Anglo-Gascon groups maintained the pressure on the French, capturing several significant fortified places between December 1345 and March 1346. Background Since the Norman conquest of England in 1066, English monarchs had held titles and lands within France, the possession of which made them vassals of the kings of France. The status of the English king's French fiefs was a major source of conflict between the two monarchies throughout the Middle Ages. French monarchs systematically sought to check the growth of English power, stripping away lands as the opportunity arose. Over the centuries, English holdings in France had varied in size, but by 1337 only Gascony in south-western France and Ponthieu in northern France were left. The independent-minded Gascons had their own customs and claimed to have a separate language; they preferred their relationship with a distant English king who left them alone, to one with a French king who would interfere in their affairs. Following a series of disagreements between Philip VI of France () and Edward III of England (), on 24 May 1337 Philip's Great Council agreed that the Duchy of Aquitaine, effectively Gascony, should be taken back into Philip's hands on the grounds that Edward was in breach of his obligations as a vassal. This marked the start of the Hundred Years' War, which was to last 116 years. =Gascony= thumbupright=0.75leftalt=A map of French territory as it was in 1340, showing the enclave of Gascony in the south-westFrance in 1330. Before the war commenced, well over 1,000 ships a year departed Gascony. Among their cargoes were over of locally produced wine. The duty levied by the English Crown on wine from Bordeaux raised more money than all other customs duties combined and was by far the largest source of state income. Bordeaux, the capital of Gascony, grew rich on this trade; it had a population of over 50,000, greater than London's, and Bordeaux was possibly richer. By this time English Gascony had become so truncated by French encroachments that it relied on imports of food, largely from England. Any interruptions to regular shipping were liable to starve Gascony and financially cripple England; the French were well aware of this. Although Gascony was the cause of the war, Edward was able to spare few resources for it. When an English army had campaigned on the continent earlier in the war it had operated in northern France, causing the Gascons to largely rely on their own resources; they had been hard pressed as a consequence. In 1339 the French besieged Bordeaux, even breaking into the city with a large force before they were repulsed. Typically the Gascons could field 3,000‚Äì6,000 men, the large majority of whom were infantry, although up to two-thirds of them would be tied down in garrisons. There was no formal border between English and French territory. Many landholders owned a patchwork of widely separated estates, perhaps owing fealty to a different overlord for each. Each small estate was likely to have a tower house, larger estates had castles. Fortifications were also constructed at transport choke points, to collect tolls and to restrict military passage; fortified towns grew up alongside all bridges and most fords over the many rivers in the region. Military forces could support themselves by foraging so long as they moved on at frequent intervals. If they wished to remain in one place for any length of time, as was necessary to besiege a castle, then access to water transport was essential for supplies of food and fodder and desirable for such items as siege equipment. Warfare was usually a struggle for possession of castles and other fortified points, and for the mutable loyalty of the local nobility; the region had been in a state of flux for centuries and many local lords served whichever country was stronger, regardless of national ties. By 1345, after eight years of war, English- controlled territory mostly consisted of a coastal strip from Bordeaux to Bayonne, and isolated strongholds further inland. The French had strong fortifications throughout what had once been English-controlled Gascony. Several directly threatened Bordeaux: Libourne, to the east allowed French armies to assemble a day's march from Bordeaux; the strongly fortified town of Blaye was situated on the north bank of the Gironde downstream of Bordeaux and in a position to interdict its vital seaborne communications; the fortress of Langon, south of Bordeaux, blocked upstream communication along the Garonne, and facilitated the supply of any French force advancing on Bordeaux.

The Earl of Northampton would lead a small force to Brittany, a slightly larger force would proceed to Gascony under the command of Henry, Earl of Derby and the main force would accompany Edward to either northern France or Flanders. The previous Seneschal of Gascony, Nicholas de la Beche, was replaced by the more senior Ralph, Earl of Stafford, who sailed for Gascony in February with an advance force. Derby was appointed the King's Lieutenant in Gascony on 13March 1345 and received a contract to raise a force of 2,000 men in England, and further troops in Gascony itself. The highly detailed contract of indenture had a term of six months from the opening of the campaign in Gascony, with an option for Edward to extend it for a further six months on the same terms. Derby was given a high degree of autonomy, for example his strategic instructions were: \\"si guerre soit, et a faire le bien q'il poet\\" (...if there is war, do the best you can...). French intelligence had uncovered the English plan for offensives in the three theatres, but France did not have the money to raise an army in each. The French anticipated, correctly, that the English planned to make their main effort in northern France. Thus they directed what resources they had there, planning to assemble their main army at Arras on 22July. South- western France was encouraged to rely on its own resources, but as the Truce of Malestroit, signed in early 1343, was still in effect, the local lords were reluctant to spend money, and little was done. =Initial operations= Derby's force embarked at Southampton at the end of May. Bad weather forced his fleet of 151 ships to shelter in Falmouth for several weeks en route, finally departing on 23July. The Gascons, primed by Stafford to expect Derby's arrival in late May and sensing the French weakness, took the field without him. The Gascons captured the large, weakly garrisoned castles of Montravel and Monbreton on the Dordogne in early June; both were taken by surprise and their seizure broke the tenuous Truce of Malestroit. Stafford carried out a short march north to besiege Blaye with his advance party and perhaps 1,000 men-at-arms and 3,000 infantry of the Gascon lords. Having established the siege he left the Gascons to prosecute it and proceeded to Langon, south of Bordeaux, and set up a second siege. The Anglo-Gascon forces at both sieges could be readily supplied by ship. The French issued an urgent call to arms. Meanwhile, small independent parties of Gascons raided across the region. Local French groups joined them, and several minor nobles threw in their lot with the Anglo-Gascons. They had some successes, but their main effect was to tie down most of the weak French garrisons in the region and to cause them to call for reinforcements. The few French troops in the region not garrisoning their fortifications immobilised themselves with sieges: of Casseneuil in the Agenais; Monchamp near Condom; and Montcuq, a strong but strategically insignificant castle south of Bergerac. Large areas were effectively undefended. Edward's main army sailed on 29 June. They anchored off Sluys in Flanders until 22July, while Edward attended to diplomatic affairs. When they sailed, probably intending to land in Normandy, they were scattered by a storm and found their way to English ports over the following week. After more than five weeks on board ship the men and horses had to be disembarked. There was a further week's delay while the King and his council debated what to do, by which time it proved impossible to take any action with the main English army before winter. Aware of this, Philip despatched reinforcements to Brittany and Gascony. Peter, Duke of Bourbon was appointed commander-in-chief of the south- west front on 8August. =Battles of Bergerac and Auberoche= On 9August 1345 Derby arrived in Bordeaux with 500 men-at-arms, 1,500 English and Welsh archers, 500 of them mounted on ponies to increase their mobility, and ancillary and support troops, such as a team of 24 miners. A high proportion of the archers and some of the men-at-arms were convicted felons promised pardons if they served for the duration of the campaign, but the majority, including many of the felons, were veterans of other campaigns. After two weeks of further recruiting and organising Derby marched his army to Langon, rendezvoused with Stafford and took command of the combined force. While Stafford had to this point pursued a cautious strategy, Derby's intention was quite different. Rather than continue a war of sieges he was determined to strike directly at the French before they could concentrate their forces. The French forces in the region were under Bertrand de l'Isle-Jourdain, since the Duke of Bourbon had not yet arrived. Hearing of Derby's arrival, he decided to fall back to the communications centre and strategically important town of Bergerac, east of Bordeaux, where there was an important bridge over the Dordogne River. This was a convenient place to concentrate French forces and assimilate reinforcements. After a council of war Derby decided to strike at the French at Bergerac. The capture of the town, which had good river supply links to Bordeaux, would provide the Anglo-Gascon army with a base from which to carry the war to the French. It would also force the lifting of the siege of the nearby castle of Montcuq and sever communications between French forces north and south of the Dordogne. The English believed that the town could be easily taken if the French field army could be beaten or distracted. After eight years of defensive warfare by the Anglo-Gascons, there was no expectation among the French that they might make any offensive moves. Derby moved rapidly and took the French army at Bergerac by surprise on 26August, decisively beating them in a running battle. The exact details of the battle are confused and there are contradictions between the original sources, which is reflected in the modern accounts. Clifford Rogers provides a summary of the contemporary accounts, their discrepancies, and the treatment of these by modern historians. In any event, French casualties were heavy, many being killed or captured. Prisoners included Henri de Montigny, Seneschal of P√©rigord, ten other senior noblemen and many lesser nobles. Derby's share of the ransoms and the loot was estimated at ¬£34,000 (¬£ in terms), approximately four times the annual income from his lands. The survivors of the French field army rallied around de l'Isle and retreated north to P√©rigueux. Within days of the battle, Bergerac fell to an Anglo-Gascon assault and was subsequently sacked. Strategically, the Anglo-Gascon army had secured an important base for further operations. Politically, local lords who had been undecided in their allegiance had been shown that the English were again a force to be reckoned with. Derby consolidated and reorganised for two weeks, left a large garrison in the town and moved north to the Anglo-Gascon stronghold of Mussidan in the Isle valley with 6,000‚Äì8,000 men. He then pushed west to P√©rigueux, the provincial capital of P√©rigord, taking several strongpoints on the way. P√©rigueux's defences were antiquated and derelict, but the size of the French force defending it prohibited an assault. Derby blockaded P√©rigueux and captured strongholds blocking the main routes into the city. John, Duke of Normandy, the son and heir of Philip VI, replaced the Duke of Bourbon, gathered an army reportedly numbering over 20,000 and manoeuvred in the area. In early October a very large detachment relieved the city and drove off Derby's force, which withdrew towards Bordeaux. Further reinforced, the French started besieging the English-held strongpoints. A French force of 7,000, commanded by Louis of Poitiers, besieged the castle of Auberoche, east of P√©rigueux. Auberoche perches on a rocky promontory completely commanding the River Auv√©z√®re. The French encampment was divided in two, the majority of the soldiers camped close to the river between the castle and village while a smaller force was situated to prevent any relief attempts from the north. The chronicler Froissart tells an improbable tale that a soldier attempting to reach the English lines with a letter requesting help was captured and returned to the castle via a trebuchet. A messenger did get through to Derby, who was already returning to the area with a scratch force of 1,200 English and Gascon soldiers: 400 men-at-arms and 800 mounted archers. After a night march Derby attacked the French camp on 21October while they were at dinner, taking them by surprise and causing heavy initial casualties. The French rallied and there was a protracted hand-to-hand struggle, which ended when the commander of the small English garrison in the castle sortied and fell upon the rear of the French. They broke and fled. Derby's mounted men-at-arms pursued them relentlessly. French casualties are uncertain, but were heavy. They are described by modern historians as \\"appalling\\", \\"extremely high\\", \\"staggering\\", and \\"heavy\\". Many French nobles were taken prisoner; lower ranking men were, as was customary, put to the sword. The French commander, Louis of Poitiers, died of his wounds. Surviving prisoners included the second in command, Bertrand de l'Isle-Jourdain, two counts, seven viscounts, three barons, the seneschals of Clermont and Toulouse, a nephew of the Pope and so many knights that they were not counted. The ransoms alone made a fortune for many of the soldiers in Derby's army, as well as Derby himself, who was said to have made at least ¬£50,000 (¬£ in terms) from the day's captives. Over the following year Philip paid large amounts from the royal treasury as contributions towards the captives' ransoms. =Exploitation= The Duke of Normandy lost heart on hearing of the defeat. There are accounts that he resigned his command and returned to Paris, only to be reinstated and sent back by his father, the King. The French abandoned all of their ongoing sieges of other Anglo-Gascon strongpoints. There were reports of the French army disintegrating: men unpaid, even unfed; lack of fodder for the horses; desertion; troops selling their equipment. Despite heavily outnumbering the Anglo-Gascon force the Duke of Normandy retreated to Angoul√™me and disbanded his army, possibly because the French had run out of money. Derby was left almost completely unopposed for five months. Derby moved south after his victory, falling back on his communications as winter weather was setting in. He started clearing French fortifications from the border of English territory: the small castle at Pellegrue surrendered; that at Mons√©gur was stormed. He then moved on the large, strongly fortified town of La R√©ole. This occupied a key position on the north bank of the Garonne river, only from Bordeaux. The town had been English until captured by the French twenty-one years earlier. It had enjoyed considerable autonomy and lucrative trading privileges, which it had lost under the French. After negotiations with Derby, on 8November the citizens distracted the large French garrison and opened a gate for the English. The garrison fled to the citadel, which was considered exceptionally strong; the English proceeded to mine it. The garrison agreed a provisional surrender; if they were not relieved within five weeks they would leave. They were allowed to communicate this to the Duke of Normandy, but as he had just disbanded his army, and it was anyway mid-winter, there was little he could do. In early January 1346 the garrison left and the English replaced them. The town regained its previous privileges. Derby spent the rest of the winter there. While this was happening the main Gascon forces disbanded. Many of the English soldiers took ship for home. After the main forces had gone home for the winter, small groups of Anglo-Gascons remained active. They cleared the valley of the Garonne downstream of La R√©ole of French presence, and raided the poorly fortified towns and weakly garrisoned French castles and smaller fortifications within their reach. Langon, which had resisted Stafford in the summer, was taken. Frequently Derby negotiated trade concessions or privileges with towns, or reinstated previous ones, to encourage them to open their gates to the English forces. The towns could more readily participate in the lucrative export trade through Bordeaux if under English rule, and Derby's performance lessened their fear of French retribution. Derby had considerable success with this approach, which also allowed the towns to avoid the possible dangers of a siege or sack. The citizens of several French garrisoned towns persuaded the soldiers to withdraw, so that they could pre-emptively surrender to Derby. In at least one case they seized the French soldiers in their beds and expelled them. A letter from a committee of French garrison commanders sent to PhilipVI in November claimed that towns were defecting to the English on a \\"daily\\" basis, and to Anglo-Gascon forces of trivial size. The French defenders were thoroughly demoralised. The Duke of Bourbon, the newly- appointed French Seneschal of Gascony, unexpectedly found himself under assault. Stafford marched on the vitally important town of Aiguillon, which commanded the junction of the Rivers Garonne and Lot, \\"the key to Gascony\\", in late November. The inhabitants attacked the garrison and opened the gates to the English. By March 1346 almost the entire province of Agenais was in English hands. Bourbon held only Agen, the capital, and four castles; all were blockaded by the English. Morale was not good. As Bourbon started to assemble a new army at Agen, fights broke out with the townsfolk. Several Italian mercenaries were lynched. Since the start of the campaign the English had captured over 100 towns and castles. Assessment The campaign had been a disaster for the French, the worse for being unexpected; during the previous eight years of the war, the Anglo-Gascons had made no large-scale offensive moves. They had lost towns and castles; suffered heavy casualties; and had many nobles taken prisoner, who would not be available to fight until they had paid their heavy ransoms, much of which would go to fund the English war effort. Towns throughout south-west France embarked on urgent and expensive programmes to repair, improve or in some cases build from scratch their fortifications. They also paid attention to keeping them adequately garrisoned. It became next to impossible to raise tax money from the region, or to persuade men to serve away from home. This extended to areas far from where Derby had campaigned. After two and a half years of uneasy peace, the war had restarted with a series of French humiliations. In the border region morale and, more importantly, prestige had decidedly swung England's way following this campaign, providing an influx of taxes and recruits for the English armies. Large parts of the Gascon nobility had been wavering with regard to committing themselves, and Derby's victories tipped the balance for many. Local lords of note declared for the English, bringing their retinues with them. Derby's success was essentially defensive: he had secured Gascony. He had also set the scene for a possible future Anglo-Gascon offensive; this was to come late the following year, with his series of mounted raids. For the time being, while French financial resources were hampered, their ability to raise and project large forces were not seriously impaired. The four-month campaign has been described as \\"the first successful land campaign of... the Hundred Years' War\\", which had commenced more than eight years earlier. DerbyDuring the 1345 campaign he was known as the Earl of Derby, but his father died in September 1345 and he became the Earl of Lancaster. went on to lead another successful campaign in 1346. Modern historians have praised the generalship demonstrated by Derby in this campaign: \\"superb and innovative tactician\\"; \\"ris[ing] to the level of genius\\"; \\"brilliant in the extreme\\"; \\"stunning\\"; \\"brilliant\\". A chronicler writing fifty years after the event described him as \\"one of the best warriors in the world\\". Aftermath In October 1345 Northampton commenced his campaign in northern Brittany, but it fizzled out in a series of failures to capture French-held Breton towns. The French decided to make their main effort in 1346 against Gascony. A large French army, \\"enormously superior\\" to any force Derby could field, assembled early in the campaigning season under the Duke of Normandy and marched up the Garonne valley. Their plan was to retake La R√©ole; to ensure their lines of supply they first had to retake Aiguillon. Stafford, in charge of Aiguillon's Anglo-Gascon garrison of 900 men, withstood an eight-month siege. Derby concentrated the main Anglo-Gascon force at La R√©ole, as a threat, and ensured that the French were never able to fully blockade the town. They found that their own supply lines were seriously harassed. Edward III was meanwhile assembling a large army in England. The French were aware of this, but anticipated that it would sail to Gascony and attempt to relieve Aiguillon. Instead it landed in Normandy in July, achieving strategic surprise and starting the Cr√©cy campaign. Philip VI ordered his son to abandon the siege and march north; after several delays John did, arriving in Picardy two weeks after Philip's army had been decisively beaten at the Battle of Cr√©cy with very heavy losses. The areas facing Derby were left effectively defenceless, and he sent local Gascon forces to besiege the few major strongholds in the region still held by the French. Taking a force of approximately 2,000 Derby set out from La R√©ole on a grand chevauch√©e, a great mounted raid. During the following two months this was devastatingly successful. Not only Gascony, but much of the Duchy of Aquitaine was left securely in English hands. It was to be held until formally ceded by the French in 1360 in the Treaty of Br√©tigny.

The passengers were mostly from communities around the Capital District, primarily Amsterdam, and were on their way to celebrate a birthday at Brewery Ommegang near Cooperstown. Among them were four sisters and two recently married couples. The crash was the deadliest transportation-related disaster in the United States since the 2009 Colgan Air Flight 3407 crash outside Buffalo killed 50; it was also the deadliest road transportation disaster in the U.S. since a 2005 bus fire in Wilmer, Texas, killed 23 nursing home residents evacuating from the path of Hurricane Rita. Investigators uncovered problems with the limousine, the driver and the limousine company. The state had ordered the vehicle removed from service after it failed two inspections due to mechanical problems including deficient brakes; a shop hired to fix the brakes allegedly made inadequate repairs and then falsified their records. The vehicle was only certified for 10 seats but had 18 installed. The driver lacked the required endorsement to his license for carrying 15 or more passengers. The New York State Police (NYSP) determined that the operator, Nauman Hussain, was aware of these issues yet continued to rent the vehicle, and he was arrested and indicted on 20 counts each of criminally negligent homicide and and second-degree manslaughter. His lawyers argue that the brakes failed in ways that state inspectors and Hussain could not have foreseen, pointing to the repair shop's alleged fraud. The case has not gone to trial. The criminal investigation created tensions over access to the vehicle; the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)‚Äîthe federal agency charged with investigating transportation accidents and recommending safety improvements‚Äîalleged that the NYSP did not allow NTSB staff to examine the wreck for several months. Larger issues have been implicated. The NTSB questioned whether safety regulations governing limousines, which critics have called lax, are sufficient to protect passengers; in September 2019, the agency issued an interim report suggesting that some passengers may have survived had they worn seat belts, and called on the industry and the state to do more to promote and mandate their use. The intersection of the two highways, which residents say remains hazardous due to its steep downhill approach, has been cited as a possible contributing factor despite efforts by the state to reduce the risk. The victims' families have filed civil lawsuits against the limousine operator, the state, a Pakistani tycoon, the repair shop and the store in whose parking lot the two pedestrians were killed. Background Axel Steenburg and his new wife Amy, of Amsterdam, New York, west of Albany, had planned a group outing for themselves, their siblings, and close friends at Brewery Ommegang, south of Cooperstown, where he had celebrated his bachelor party in June, to celebrate Amy's 30th birthday on October 6, 2018. So that all guests could drink freely, Steenburg arranged for a party bus to take the group there and back. On the morning of the party, the group, ranging in age from 24 to 34, gathered at the Steenburg home. It included all three of Amy's sisters, two of whom were also accompanied by their husbands, and Axel's brother. The party's reservation at Ommegang was for noon that day, but two days earlier, Axel Steenburg learned that the bus to be used had broken down, and the operator refunded him the $50 fee. At 9 a.m. on the morning of the party, he was able to arrange another ride through Prestige Limousine Services, a small operator based in Gansevoort, north of Albany outside Saratoga Springs, for $1,475. They were able to send a stretch limousine that would hold 18 people, one more than was in the group that would make the trip. Prestige dispatched a 2001 Ford Excursion expanded to seat the additional passengers. Unbeknownst to Steenburg or anyone in his group, the vehicle had failed two inspections earlier that year. The issues that had led to those failures included its brakes, and the state Department of Transportation (DOT) had ordered it to be taken out of service in September, with inspectors placing a sticker reading \\"unserviceable\\" across its windshield, but it had been removed before it was driven to Amsterdam. It had also been listed for sale on Craigslist two days earlier, advertised as \\"DOT ready\\". Driver Scott Lisinicchia, of Lake George, had complained at times about the safety of the company's vehicles. His wife recalled having overheard him say he would not drive a particular vehicle at some times when Prestige called. While he had driven trucks in the past and held a valid commercial driver's license (CDL), it lacked the \\"P\\" endorsement needed for him to transport 15 or more passengers at a time.New York State Commercial Drivers Manual Lisinicchia had been cited for driving without this endorsement; he also had several outstanding traffic tickets in Saratoga Springs, enough that his license should have been suspended. However, a clerical error had prevented the paperwork from being filed. Crash alt=A two-lane paved road curves gently ahead of the viewer in a mostly wooded area under a mostly cloudy sky. There is a left-turn lane immediately ahead and another road leaving at a right angle to the right, going slightly uphill, with steel guardrails on the right. Black and white signs at the right identify the road ahead as \\"30A\\", the road to the right as \\"30\\", and state that the road ahead will lead the driver to an \\"88\\", signed in red, white and blue. Delayed by the change in vehicle, the group left Amsterdam late, well after their noon reservation at Ommegang. The Excursion left the city by heading west on the New York State Thruway to the next exit, at Fultonville, where the limousine went south on New York State Route 30A (NY 30A), a long winding two-lane rural road. Why the group chose this route is not known; an investigative report said there were some stops planned between Amsterdam and the brewery. South of Glen, from Fultonville, the section of Route 30A the limousine was traveling climbs to a plateau between the Mohawk and Schoharie valleys. The road goes southwest, then southeast and south, through a mostly rural landscape and then Charleston State Forest. Shortly before crossing into Schoharie County, the highway reaches a height of land at in elevation. In the next three miles (5.8 km) NY 30A descends , with a stop sign where New York State Route 162 joins it and a traffic light at the junction with U.S. Route 20 in Sloansville, to the side of Schoharie Creek, which it follows along relatively level land three miles to Central Bridge. Just south of that hamlet, Route 30A joins New York State Route 7, which the limo turned left to do. A mile east of that junction, Route 30A leaves the concurrency to continue south towards an interchange with Interstate 88. The Excursion went instead east on NY 7, climbing in two miles (3.2 km) to its blinkered intersection with New York State Route 30, where it turned right, south, towards Schoharie. Immediately south of the intersection, before NY 30 crosses over I-88, several sets of signs topped by paired orange diamonds warn that trucks are not permitted on this stretch of road and advise them to use Route 7 instead. For those drivers who continue south, many more signs warn drivers about the steep grade ahead, through which the speed limit is ; a sign located from the intersection indicates the limit is reduced to at that point. According to the state's crash investigator, the Excursion had departed from its course for some reason as the turn up Route 7 to the Route 30 junction is not the most direct route from Amsterdam to Ommegang. It was reported as possible that they changed their minds about the trip completely, or had decided to stop at the Apple Barrel. Lisinicchia may also have gotten lost; the driver of a vehicle going south on NY 30, along with two passengers, recalled later to the NTSB that they had been stopped at the intersection while the Excursion turned. They described his appearance as \\"confused\\" and \\"frazzled\\", and noted that immediately after turning, the vehicle pulled over onto the shoulder and put its flashers on. They put the time of this as two minutes, at most, before the crash based on the driver's own experience of traveling the road. The witness recalled that it was slowly rolling forward, but its backup lights were on, as well as its back-up beepers. They continued past it. A passenger in the vehicle said that they saw Lisinicchia pointing toward the valley. At the bottom of the hill is a right-angled three-way intersection where NY 30A forks off to the north while NY 30 turns southward toward Schoharie, two miles (3.2km) away. Southbound traffic on NY 30 must stop regardless of which way it intends to turn; a sign warns of this several hundred feet uphill of the intersection. When the Excursion reached the junction, at 1:55 p.m., it did not stop and was, according to a witness, going very fast. The witness who had earlier seen the Excursion on the side of the road recalled that after they stopped at the intersection, they saw the limousine coming downhill behind them, its speed increasing. They recalled that the vehicle's engine was loud, almost sounding like a jet. They feared they would be hit but at the last second it swerved around them. alt=A broad stretch of curved paved road, with turn lanes and a double yellow line down the center, photographed from its side. At the right is a small building with a reddish cross-gabled roof; a sign on the road says it is the \\"Apple Barrel Caf√©\\". In the front right are two black on white signs with the numbers \\"30\\" and \\"30A\\" on them The vehicle continued into the parking lot of the nearby Apple Barrel Country Store where it struck a parked 2015 Toyota Highlander, which in turn struck two pedestrians in the lot who were attempting to get away, and then came to a stop in a gully. The store manager told reporters that customers in the store parking lot were killed when the limo sped down the hill \\"probably over \\". Later it emerged that two pedestrians in the parking lot were killed after being struck by the Highlander, which was driven into a drainage ditch away. All 18 people in the limousine were killed. All but two were pronounced dead at the scene. A helicopter standing by to transport one was instructed instead to standby at a hospital in nearby Cobleskill, while the patients were transported there by ground so as to avoid disrupting treatment one was already receiving. One was pronounced dead on arrival; the other was transferred to the helicopter and taken to Albany Medical Center, where they were likewise pronounced dead. An eyewitness claimed the crash sounded like an explosion, and when she exited her parked car, she saw a body on the ground, and then registered the screaming from bystanders. Another eyewitness told reporters she saw \\"...this large van, a very unusual looking vehicle out here in Schoharie in the bushes and really wrecked, hit a tree\\", and she watched first responders break windows to get victims out. Investigations Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) were at the scene of the crash. A state trooper told reporters that they had deployed a reconstruction unit, facial identification and a drone in order to gather data about the crash and the victims. NTSB head Robert Sumwalt told reporters two days after the crash that it was too early to say whether the limo had been speeding at the time; the agency was focusing on human and mechanical factors as causes. It was, however, a \\"high-energy impact\\" that had severely damaged the front and left portions of the vehicle, and, Sumwalt intimated, driven the engine into the passenger compartment. There were no skid marks on the pavement, suggesting the driver had not applied the brakes, or that they had not been functioning well, before reaching the stop sign. Investigators would be looking at the airbag control module for data that might answer their questions. Robert Patnaude, commander of State Police Troop G, which patrols the Capital District, said on October 9 that his agency was treating the case as a criminal investigation due to the level of negligence possibly involved. \\"We'll determine if there's any criminal culpability on the part of anyone,\\" he told the media. \\"If there is, we'll hold them accountable.\\" In August 2020 the NTSB announced it would hold a hearing at the end of September to consider the draft final report. The board is expected to vote on findings, probable cause, recommendations and any changes to the draft. It will be held virtually; the public will be able to view. =Conflict between NTSB and state police over access to vehicle= The state police's investigation led to some tension with the NTSB team. Since the former investigation is a criminal case, it takes priority, and the limousine remains in NYSP custody until it is finished. The NTSB was not listed on the original search warrant, which was apparently interpreted as disallowing them access to the vehicle, despite the issuing judge's belief to the contrary. Almost two weeks after the crash, the federal investigators complained privately to the Associated Press that they had not been able to even look over the vehicle. On October 22, the state police announced that it would soon be allowing Hussain's defense attorney, Lee Kindlon, and defense experts, to look at the limousine, along with the prosecution. NTSB investigators, said state police spokesman Beau Duffy, had been able to look at the vehicle's exterior but not yet examine its internal mechanics. The day after the article was published, Senator Charles Schumer told the media that an NTSB investigator had been \\"granted limited access\\" to the limousine. The state police issued a statement confirming that, and also noted that it was not the first time their federal counterparts had been able to view the Excursion. However, they were not yet permitted to examine it as they wanted to until the criminal investigation had concluded, and the defense attorney for arrested suspect Nauman Hussain and any investigators he had hired had had a chance to do so as well, an issue the NYSP said the NTSB was fully aware of. The state police promised the NTSB its investigators would get their chance to more fully examine the limo in the following weeks. Schumer said that the NTSB would likely release a report on the crash in three months; a board spokesman clarified that that report would likely be preliminary (the first report, merely describing the circumstances of the accident and not making any conclusions about the cause, came out in February 2019). The investigation, and the full final report, could possibly take a year or two. In late December, the NTSB still had not gotten the access to the Excursion, nor even other Prestige vehicles it wanted to examine, and went public with a letter to Mallery, the Schoharie County district attorney. \\"[W]e are gravely concerned that your lack of responsiveness to our requests has seriously impeded our abilities to carry out our congressionally-mandated duties to properly complete this safety investigation and potentially prevent similar accidents in the future\\", the agency's lawyer wrote, alleging that the delays had possibly compromised evidence. The D.A. and state police had expressed concerns of their own that the NTSB might release information that could compromise the criminal investigation, and that federal investigators might be called as witnesses in any criminal trial. In mid-January the NTSB and Mallery's office reached an agreement under which the board's investigators would be recalled from their furlough due to the government shutdown and allowed to examine the Excursion, then stored in a tent behind Troop G headquarters in Colonie, north of Albany. A more permanent structure would be erected to shelter the limousine. However, a spokesperson for Capital District congressman Paul Tonko stressed that \\"while progress has been made, terms for a final agreement remain unresolved.\\" The NTSB became concerned and objected in light of a request by state investigators to remove the transmission and torque converter from the vehicle without its investigators present, since without doing that carefully evidence the board wanted to examine could have been destroyed. The NTSB has still not been added to the search warrant due to a delay from Schoharie County District Attorney Susan Mallery. In correspondence between Mallery, NTSB counsel Kathleen Silbaugh and Schoharie County Court Judge George Bartlett, who had issued the warrant, the federal agency accused Mallery of being obstructionist and deceptive. The D.A.'s office, Silbaugh wrote in a January 7 letter, had made an in camera request of Bartlett on December 24 for a supplemental warrant that would allow state police to remove the transmission and converter. He told prosecutors they had four days to let the NTSB know of their request, and that it in turn had until January 7 to make any comments to him before he made any ruling. However, Silbaugh told the judge, only on December 31 did Mallery's office even inform the NTSB that it had made the request, and did not go into specifics about the intended removal. \\"Indeed, the NTSB was under the impression that the supplemental search warrant was being sought for the purpose of adding NTSB investigators to the list of persons and entities authorized to examine the crash vehicle.\\" However, on January 4, Silbaugh wrote, she was discussing the request with the Schoharie County Clerk of Courts, who informed her of its specific purpose. After the close of business that day, Bartlett said in a letter of his own, Mallery sent him a fax asking that he sign the warrant so the transmission and converter could be removed three days later and examined by a state police expert. Mallery's fax said that NTSB director Robert Molloy had verbally acquiesced in the request and that she would soon send a copy of an email from him saying the same; however the correspondence, as reviewed by the Schenectady Daily Gazette, did not include any email from him. Silbaugh told the judge that Molloy had not consented to the search; rather he had told Mallery that the NTSB was still working on its response, and reiterated that its investigators needed physical access to the Excursion. Silbaugh claimed that the state police had not allowed any NTSB personnel access to the vehicle since October 12, and even then made them stand away. Mallery countered in a letter of her own that the state police had allowed the board's investigators \\"three lengthy opportunities\\" to review the limousine and remained in regular contact with them over their findings. Silbaugh reiterated that the NTSB had been kept at a distance, and that Mallery had told her that even taking measurements and photographs could compromise the evidence without explaining how. A January 11 attempt to resolve differences via a conference call involving Bartlett and all the parties reportedly resulted in Mallery hanging up after 45 minutes. Mallery argued to Bartlett that since the NTSB was not named in the search warrant it did not have access to the Excursion. The judge rejected that argument, but wrote her that \\"[i]t appears the easiest way to break this impasse is to include the NTSB on the search warrant.\\" He asked the agency to submit suggested language, and for defense counsel and Mallery's office to submit any opposition, by January 14 so he could rule on it by January 16. In the interim he issued an order that the limousine remain at its present location. In her letter responding to Bartlett, Mallery said that the NTSB had had more access to the vehicle than it claimed, citing several dates in October. She also disputed the agency's claim that evidence had been compromised, and proposed that the board's investigators be allowed to examine closely, photograph and measure the Excursion under the supervision of state troopers, as long as they did not alter, remove or destroy any evidence. \\"It is concerning\\", she wrote, \\"that politics are seemingly of greater concern to some than justice ...\\" At the end of January, Bartlett was able to broker an agreement between Mallery, the state police, Kindlon and the NTSB. It allows the federal investigators to photograph the limousine and take some scrapings. However, they may not take any brake fluid from the vehicle since there is too little to share. In early February the limo, which remained in a parking lot at state police headquarters, was moved a hundred feet (30 m) to a special protective shed built by the NTSB. Joe Tacopina, newly retained as Nauman Hussain's defense attorney, suggested that Mallery's efforts to keep the federal agency from examining the vehicle was the former's attempt to protect a weak case: \\"It is very telling that the DA has been trying to prevent the NTSB, the agency that has the most expertise in investigating transportation accidents in the world, from inspecting the vehicle.\\" The supplemental search warrant ordering the state police to remove the transmission and torque converter was signed on January 30; it is not known whether it has been executed. Lawyers for the victims' survivors, only one of whom at that time had served Hussain with paperwork, expressed concern that they had not been able to access the vehicle. They feared that crucial evidence might be destroyed or altered by the investigation. =State police= The state police concentrated their investigation on factors specific to the accident: the vehicle, its driver and Prestige Limousine. Within a week of the crash, they had enough evidence to make an arrest. Vehicle 2000‚Äì2004 Ford Excursion stretch limousine, similar in configuration to accident vehicle New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said at an October 8 news conference that Scott Lisinicchia, the driver of the limo, did not have a Commercial Driver's License with a passenger endorsement required to operate the vehicle. Cuomo added that the limo was a \\"chopped vehicle\\", cut and extended to long, more than its original length, with added seats. It would thus need a federal certificate to operate, which the limo involved in the crash did not have. The Excursion had also failed inspection the previous month due to not only the absence of this certificate, but mechanical issues like a hydraulic antilock brake warning indicator light that stayed on, a dangling brake line that could have made contact with a tire, defective emergency exits and defective windshield wipers, making it illegal to operate on public roads in the state until those issues were corrected. In April 2019, a court filing by prosecutors indicated that DOT had held a hearing before an administrative law judge into Prestige's failures to maintain the vehicle on October 6, 2017‚Äîexactly a year before the crash. No one from Prestige attended the hearing, which could have resulted in a default fine of up to $5,000. Mallery said she planned to argue that Hussain had criminal intent from the beginning of Prestige's ownership of the limousine, since he had improperly registered it as a livery vehicle, allowing him to get the vehicle inspected twice under less stringent Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) standards rather than DOT's. The inspection further noted that similar issues had been found in a March spot inspection; the September inspection report notes that the Excursion had been driven since then. In the previous inspection the vehicle was also cited as having 18 seats installed, in excess of its designed passenger capacity of 10. Prestige Limousines, the owner and operator, was told to cease and desist from limousine operations until further notice. It was later reported that different license plates had been affixed to the limousine at its March and September inspections; however, the vehicle identification number had not changed. During the first six months of 2018, Global Liberty, Prestige's insurance company had canceled coverage on the Excursion six times. Whenever that happens, DMV automatically revokes the vehicle's registration, restoring it only when the owner can get the coverage restored or find new coverage; otherwise the license plates must be surrendered. The limousine's registration had been restored for the sixth time the day before the crash. Why Global Liberty had canceled the coverage, which usually costs $5‚Äì10,000 annually, was not known; the company would not comment. Prestige had failed to attend an April DOT hearing where they could have either offered proof that the issues that had led to the previous month's failed inspection had been addressed, or contest the agency's claim. Since they did neither they were fined $700, less than the company charged to rent the limousine. The state cashed the check from Prestige, its records show, but took no further action. In August a state trooper specializing in commercial vehicle enforcement wrote a violation notice, but no tickets, when he observed that the vehicle did not have its owner's name and contact information visibly stated on the side as required by law after he saw it unloading passengers in a no-parking zone on the day of the Travers Stakes horse race in Saratoga Springs. A final hearing was held on October 5, 2018, the day before the accident; again Prestige did not appear. In December, WNYT spoke with the owner of an Albany limousine company that had sold Prestige the Excursion in 2016. He said they had owned it for 15 years prior to the sale; it had been in good working order at that time and had passed its last inspection. He was cooperating with both the state police and the NTSB. Two days before the crash, the limousine had been listed for sale on Craigslist. The asking price was $9,000; the seller claimed it was \\"DOT ready\\" and was in \\"excellent condition\\" with on it. The seller did not identify themselves but the phone number given as a contact was one that Prestige had used. The aunt of victim Erin McGowan told the media that shortly before the crash her niece had texted her with concerns about the vehicle's condition, calling it a \\"junker\\".. A last-second replacement for the bus originally rented, which had broken down, its engine was apparently unusually loud. \\"When we get to the brewery we will all b deaf\\", McGowan wrote, with several Face with Tears of Joy emojis appended, at 1:37 p.m. Three minutes later, Allison King texted her fianc√© that the brakes were burning and the vehicle was coasting. In a Times-Union story, other limousine company operators around the state questioned how Prestige was able to continue operations with all the violations it had accumulated and the lack of proper permits; in their experience the state was diligent in enforcing its regulations. One owner said it was his understanding that if more than 20 percent of an operator's vehicles have been declared unserviceable, the state can force it to cease operations, an order only a court can override. Records kept by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, which also has authority over limousine operators, showed that Prestige had 80 percent of its vehicles unserviceable at the time of the accident. When Hussain was talking with state police and DOT officials two days after the accident, one of the latter reportedly admitted to him that \\"we've been treating you with kid gloves\\". The Times- Union analyzed federal data and found that, while the state DOT has been proactive in inspecting the vehicle types it regulates, it has a poor record of following up and ensuring violators make the required repairs, since at least 2003. In a 2017 federal audit, the state DOT admitted it had only managed to verify repairs made to 1 percent of the 10,000 school buses, limousines, and motor coaches it inspects twice a year. The state comptroller's office had likewise found in a 2014 audit that of the out-of- service violations it issues, no written record of repair existed for 40 percent and another 25 percent were filed later than the mandated 15 days after the violation. Some had even filed certifications later found to be false. Mallery appended the full report on the causes of the crash by prosecution expert Brian Chase to her October 2019 response to the defense motion to dismiss the charges. He ascribed the cause to \\"catastrophic brake failure due to the neglect of mandated commercial vehicle inspections and maintenance by company personnel\\". Chase found the brake pads were corroded and the tubing to the rear brakes deficient enough that they had failed to work at the time of the accident. He had also examined the soles of Lisinicchia's shoes, noting that his right loafer was severely deformed, with an imprint of the tread on the brake pedal suggesting he was desperately trying to stop the Excursion. Driver A couple who had rented the same vehicle, also driven by Lisinicchia, for their wedding a year earlier told Albany station WNYT that the limo was in poor condition then. Its exterior was flecked with rust, some of which was covered by duct tape. They, too, found its engine loud. The couple also recalled that Lisinicchia had been erratic and made dangerous moves such as backing up to make a turn he had missed while on a busy road. They had noticed empty beer cans in the rear as well, and said he had an unidentified passenger in the front seat all day. When they asked him about these things, he responded belligerently and profanely. The couple's complaints to management of what was then doing business as Saratoga Luxury Limousine were initially dismissed and only resulted in a partial refund. A driver who had worked for a different limousine company that used the same property as Prestige and sometimes shared its fleet told WTEN that he had driven the Excursion in 2015 and it was \\"absolutely unsafe\\". In particular, the brakes barely worked. \\"I was terrified\\", he said. \\"You just couldn't stop. You really had to put your foot on the brake.\\" When the vehicle had begun smoking during a prom, the children's parents refused to let them ride in it. Neither Prestige nor his employer, the driver said, did anything more than minimal maintenance work. After leaving the company he reported the vehicle to the state. Lisinicchia's family said he had been given an unsafe vehicle to drive and would never have knowingly put passengers in harm's way. His wife said he had been driving for Prestige part-time for a year. She recalled overhearing him on the phone, when the company called with an assignment, complaining that he would not drive a particular vehicle and requesting another one. At the time of the accident Lisinicchia was not listed on the limousine's insurance policy as a driver. James Pachter, one of three who were, said that while he readily drove any of the Lincoln Town Cars that made up the rest of Prestige's fleet he had refused any assignments in the Excursion for 18 months prior to the accident. \\"The brakes were not functioning properly\\", he said. He later testified before the grand jury that indicted Hussain. In April 2019 the Times-Union reported that toxicology tests had found that Lisinicchia had \\"significant amounts\\" of marijuana in his system when he died, in addition to traces of anti-seizure medication. The marijuana levels suggested he might have been a regular user. The family's attorney told the newspaper that those marijuana levels did not necessarily indicate impairment at the time of the crash; the disclosure, which neither state police nor Mallery confirmed, was seen as possibly complicating the prosecution of Hussain. Company Further investigation led to disclosures that other Prestige vehicles had failed inspections in the past. The company's address was a hotel in Gansevoort, north of Albany, and its owner, Shahed Hussain, was provisionally identified by The New York Times as a former Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) informant in the Newburgh Four terrorism case who had previously avoided prosecution for his alleged involvement in a scheme to sell false identification while he was employed at the state's Department of Motor Vehicles. Police were unable to interview him after the accident as he had returned to his native Pakistan, reportedly for health reasons; the day after his departure the March inspection found the limousine unserviceable. In February 2019 it was reported that he had since the accident moved to Dubai, which as part of the United Arab Emirates has no extradition treaty with the U.S.; his son's attorney maintained that he was still in Pakistan. Two months later, prosecutors alleged in a court filing that on several occasions after his father had left the country, Hussain's son Nauman had claimed to be Shahed when DOT inspectors contacted him about the Excursion, only admitting his true identity when they visited him at the business a month before the accident. Hussain's attorney, Lee Kindlon, spoke from personal experience when he later dismissed the notion that there was any intent on his client's part to deceive by answering to his father's name. He, too, had worked alongside his father, a prominent Capital District criminal defense lawyer, and had often been confused with his father or addressed by the older man's name. \\"I ran a business and worked with my dad for 10 years, and sometimes it's just easier to answer the phone and get to the heart of the conversation instead of (talking about) exactly what you are being called or who's being asked about it.\\" After the accident, Nauman spoke with the police in his father's stead, telling them he was running the company until Shahed returned. At the 2019 suppression hearing, the trooper who had written the August 2018 DOT violation notice for the lack of owner information on the Excursion said Hussain, who had gone up to Saratoga, told him that he was in the process of setting his own limousine rental company separate from Prestige and was just borrowing that limousine from his father's company as he established his business. His attorney, Lee Kindlon, suggested the crash was due to Lisinicchia's unfamiliarity with the intersection. \\"You just can't stop at something like that,\\" he said. \\"I think the state Department of Transportation [DOT] is just looking to point a finger.\\" Authorities had also found issues with the Hussains' maintenance of the Gansevoort hotel Prestige used as its business address. Neighbors had frequently complained about the condition of the property; in early 2017 the state Department of Health (DOH) shut it down and temporarily evicted the generally low-income long-term residents after a sewer line failed. The Hussains attributed it to sabotage by a tenant they had evicted; an inspection found, however, that it had been poorly installed, with improper fittings and no support. A few days after they put the property on the market for $1 million in October 2019, DOH again shut it down, citing structural hazards that could pose an immediate risk of death such as missing smoke detectors, and raw sewage on the grounds. The decision did not affect three other properties in the region they had also listed; a week later a court barred them from selling any of their other properties while the lawsuits against them were pending. =NTSB= While the NTSB is also interested in what the state police have learned about the Excursion, Lisinicchia and Prestige, they are also looking into some larger issues raised by the crash that could have contributed to not only it but other accidents: the state of limousine regulation generally, and the design of the intersection. In February 2019 the agency released a preliminary report describing the facts of the crash but saying that the investigation into its cause was ongoing. Limousine safety regulation \\"This didn‚Äôt have to happen\\", Helaine Olen wrote in a Washington Post column after the crash. \\"There are massive loopholes in the federal safety regulations governing limousines\\". Primarily, she wrote, vehicles that have to meet strict safety standards when manufactured do not have to be re-examined after being expanded. Efforts to change this at the federal and state level have generally failed in the face of vigorous opposition from the industries involved. Raul Arbalaez, an engineer with the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, agreed. \\"They don't have to go back and prove that they meet any of the crash safety criteria\\", he said of vehicle expanders and the limousine operators. The Excursion that crashed in Schoharie, he speculated, likely weighed at least , even without accounting for its passengers. \\"That is a lot to ask of the same four tires and brakes that vehicle came with.\\" In January 2019, the Times- Union reported that, among the many violations found by state inspectors prior to the crash, the limousine did not have a required manufacturer's tag identifying the company that had expanded it. Its own attempts to determine who had done so were unsuccessful. The newspaper found that after being built at Ford's Kentucky Truck Assembly, the vehicle was shipped and sold new at a dealership in St. Charles, Missouri; who bought it was unknown as the dealership does not keep sales records for longer than a decade. After American auto manufacturers stopped making limousines themselves in the 1960s, a cottage industry of expanders emerged, and most of them are based either in Southern California or around Springfield, Missouri, the latter a three-and-a- half-hour drive from St. Charles. In September 2019, the NTSB reported the vehicle had been purchased from a Ford dealership by 21st Century Coachworks in Rogersville, east of Springfield, who converted the limousine, sectioning it, extending the frame and adding three bench seats in the new rear passenger compartment. The NTSB was unable to find any evidence that the vehicle had ever received the required Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards tag with information on the alteration following the expansion. The Times-Union found in Missouri state records two companies based in Rogersville with \\"21st Century\\" in their names. Both used the same address but had different principals, and went out of business around the same time in 2003. Their principals had both died and their widows could not be reached. State records showed the vehicle's odometer had on it when it was bought by Albany-area Royale Limousine, whose owner would not say who had expanded it‚Äîat the time it had nine seats, half those it had when it crashed. Many of the Los Angeles- area companies that expanded limousines at the time have gone out of business. The manager of the Ford dealership in St. Charles told the newspaper said he did not recall selling to one of the larger ones, and the two biggest expanders in Springfield said they had not expanded the Excursion, though a manager at one believed its size and interior features pointed to one of the defunct California concerns. Kindlon said all the modifications to the limousine predated his clients' ownership. They, too, were attempting to find out who had made them. \\"Ultimately, one of the questions I think everybody needs to answer is were those modifications some sort of proximate cause of this event\\" he said. After it was reported that the limousine in the crash had been cited several times for insufficient braking capacity, defined as having less than 80 percent of the brakes' designed capacity, Frank Figueroa, a California vehicle constructor who had not worked on the Excursion, told NBC News that that failure might have resulted from constricted brake lines. While the original brake lines to the front wheels are retained when a vehicle is expanded into a limousine, he said, it is necessary to extend those that reach the rear wheels. For that reason, the extended lines are usually made of steel to avoid any risk of obstruction or constriction. Vehicles such as the Excursion used by Prestige are associated in the industry with \\"third-tier guys\\" based in smaller cities, Figueroa said. Nonetheless, he maintained, as manufactured it had an towing capacity. If its original braking system were in place, it should have been able to come to a complete stop at the intersection. Another issue relevant to the accident was seat belt requirements, or the lack thereof, for passengers in limousines. New York, like many states, only requires passengers in the front seat to use them. Expanders are not even required to add them, nor any additional side airbags. \\"[W]earing seat belts does save lives\\", Sumwalt told the media. \\"Whether or not it would've made a difference here or not, that remains to be seen.\\" Peter Goelz, a former NTSB managing director, said the crash would be \\"a watershed event for the limousine industry\\", as he predicted that the lack of or failure to use seat belts would be cited as a major cause for the loss of life in the accident and rules would be changed to require them. The board's preliminary report, however, noted that the seats added to the vehicle did have lap belts but not whether they were in use at the time of the accident. NTSB diagram from HSR1902, contrasting destruction of front with relatively intact rear passenger compartments The NTSB issued Safety Recommendation Report HSR1902 in September 2019, entitled Providing Occupant Protection for Limousine Passengers. In the report, the NTSB determined the crash was not survivable for the limousine driver as the front seating compartment suffered a \\"complete loss of occupant survival space\\". The rear passenger compartment was able to retain survival space, but the additional seats and seat belt restraints installed during the limousine extension were not adequately anchored, nor were they properly designed for crash protection. In addition, although the seats originally installed by Ford remained attached to the floor and intact, none of the occupants were wearing seat belts at the time of the crash; the seat belts for the aftermarket seats were under the seats and inaccessible. As a result, the NTSB issued a recommendation to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, asking the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to mandate minimum performance standards for aftermarket seats installed in vehicles modified into limousines. The NTSB also recommended that limousine operators encourage passengers to wear seat belts, and that mandated state inspections should check that seat belts are functional and accessible. =Federal and state responses= After a 2015 limousine crash on Long Island that killed four, Schumer, the Senate's current minority leader, had asked the NTSB to study limousine accidents as the beginning of an effort to improve safety and regulation. He and Kirsten Gillibrand, New York's other U.S. Senator, along with Connecticut senator Richard Blumenthal, again wrote to the board after the accident, saying it pointed to the need to improve regulation and safety standards for limousines and the companies that operate them. New York state legislators also have introduced bills to improve limousine safety. State senator Simcha Felder's bill would ban the use of any stretch limousines older than 10 years and require a minimum of $2 million in liability insurance coverage, as well as changing procedures for vehicles that fail inspection. Assemblywoman Amy Paulin, who has made limousine safety a cause since 2006, introduced several bills in her chamber to implement recommendations made by a grand jury that investigated the 2015 crash, including requiring seat belt use. A lobbyist for the industry told the Times- Union that many of these bills seemed premature since the cause of the accident was not yet known and the state's regulations for limos were already among the strictest in the U.S. Nonetheless, the state has already made some administrative responses, changing responsibility for inspecting limos to the DMV from the DOT and reclassifying any vehicle designed to carry more than nine passengers in addition to the driver as a bus. In January 2019 the Times- Union reported that state police had seized the license plates of 59 limousines owned by companies whose registrations had been suspended for failure to comply with state DOT safety regulations; later the paper reported that the DMV had \\"blacklisted\\" the vehicle identification numbers of those limousines from which it had removed plates to prevent them from being re- registered under new ownership. DMV officials declined to respond to the paper's questions as to why this had not been done to the Excursion before the accident although it had been pulled over twice after being ordered off the road, citing the ongoing criminal investigation. \\"The state is acting affirmatively to crack down on bad actors who put innocent New Yorkers in danger\\", a spokesman said. However, the article noted, such action might not have prevented Prestige from operating it anyway, since at the September 2018 inspection the company had put a second set of plates on not just the Excursion but a Lincoln Town Car that had also been ruled unserviceable earlier that year. At his news conference announcing his state budget proposal shortly afterwards, Cuomo announced a package of sweeping reforms to state limousine safety regulation, reforms suggested not only by the Schoharie crash but the 2015 Long Island crash that killed four women on their way to a bachelorette party. The centerpiece is an outright ban on stretch limousines similar to the Excursion; the governor also called for criminal penalties, some felonies, for vehicle owners and inspection stations that circumvent regulations as Prestige and its inspectors allegedly did. He also proposed prohibiting limousines from making U-turns, requiring inspection stations to report attempts to bring unauthorized vehicles in for inspection, and ending the state's exemption from seatbelt laws for passengers in all vehicles for hire. After heavy lobbying by limousine operators, Cuomo left the stretch ban out of his state budget proposal in late February, although the other measures remained. Trade organizations for the limo industry applauded the move, saying it would have forced many of them in state to sell their fleets and go out of business. However, an auto body shop owner whose niece, Rachel Cavosie, was one of the victims, criticized Cuomo for doing so, saying the governor had \\"abandon[ed] the families of 20 people\\". When the budget did pass in early April, several reform measures were included. A felony offense for operating a limousine that causes a death was created, civil penalties for operating one without authority and/or in violation of safety regulations were increased as were liability insurance coverage requirements. The authority of DOT and the state police to confiscate the license plates of non-compliant limousines was clarified, and DMV inspection stations were required, under pain of certification suspension, to report any attempt by a vehicle under DOT's jurisdiction, such as a limousine, to attempt to get a DMV inspection instead. Stretch limousines were also forbidden to make U-turns. Configuration of intersection The family that owns the Apple Barrel Country Store told reporters that the intersection and hill are a recurring issue. Sumwalt confirmed to the media that his agency will be looking at the configuration of the junction as a possible contributing factor. \\"We do know that there have been other crashes at this intersection,\\" he said. \\"[S]o we want to see: Were there factors in the roadway itself that could have led to the conditions of this crash?\\" The intersection was originally configured as a Y, slightly uphill of its present location, which was more developed in the early 20th century and today's Route 30A was part of NY 43. After World War II, Route 30, which had followed the course northeast that 30A does today, was realigned to its present course and the intersection reconfigured into a Y with Route 43 following a new road, parallel to a former rail corridor, that forked off south of the original intersection; the portion that had led west from the intersection to the realignment was vacated. In 1960 Route 43 was truncated to end at its junction with Route 30 in Schoharie; the portion north of the Route 30 intersection was made part of Route 30A, newly created at the behest of the Fulton County Automobile Club. alt=Two roads meeting at a very oblique angle with a large stop sign at the junction. Signs at the right indicate that traffic going straight ahead is following Route 30 southbound, with a right turn indicated for Route 30A northbound. Between the two signs a white-on- green sign says that it is three miles to Schoharie straight ahead and two miles to Central Bridge on the left. Beyond the intersection are some trees, trailer homes and parked cars This configuration of the intersection necessitated that traffic on southbound 30 not only stop at the bottom of the hill but turn left just before doing so. After Interstate 88 was built through the area in the early 1980s, with an exit on Route 30A a mile north of the intersection serving both roads, Route 30 was likewise realigned to clear a corridor for the interstate. Its brief concurrency with NY 7 two miles (3.2km) northeast of the 30A junction was replaced with a four-way intersection, and a new, curved section along the hillside replaced the previous straight descent to the intersection. With the interstate access trucks began using that section of Route 30 more, sometimes having accidents at the bottom of the hill when their brakes failed. Residents in the intersection's vicinity, and Schoharie's town board, asked the state to do something about it. After a fatal accident in 2008, the state DOT began a multiyear project to reconfigure the intersection a third time, straightening Route 30 to make a T intersection with 30A. When it was completed, vehicles over were banned from the section of the highway between routes 7 and 30A; those traveling south on Route 30 must follow Route 7 down to Route 30A just north of the I-88 exit. The weight limit was eventually lowered to and, by the end of 2015, all trucks. Schoharie town supervisor Alan Tavenner told The New York Times that he believed the intersection had become more dangerous since then, but two days later said to reporters from Gannett News Service that the required truck detours \\"seem to have helped\\" lower accidents at the site. The family that owns the Apple Barrel says accidents still occur. Four days after the accident, The Daily Gazette filed a request with DOT under the state's Freedom of Information Law for emails to and from its resident engineer for Schoharie County, and the department's regional engineer, \\"concerning safety or concerns about safety or accidents\\". DOT refused the request, saying public disclosure of those requests could interfere with the ongoing investigation by the state police. In December, the newspaper decried this in an editorial: \\"Explain to the public exactly how releasing information already prepared by state officials and known within the DOT about this intersection is going to impede a police investigation into the crash.\\" It doubted that it would, and noted that any statistical data in those records was not covered by that exemption and should be disclosed. In August 2019, the state DOT announced it would not be changing the speed limit on the section of Route 30 going downhill into the crash site. Morrissey said that not only were the posted limits in accord with engineering standards, \\"[t]here is also absolutely no indication that the posted speed limit in this area contributed in any way to the tragic crash last October.\\" Sal Ferlazzo, who had filed a civil suit against the state and Hussain over the crash for the family of victim Amanda Rivenburg, disputed that claim, saying a former DOT engineer he had retained as an expert witness said the placement of a speed limit sign so close to the intersection was \\"a major design error\\". In an editorial, the Schenectady Daily Gazette, after facetiously wondering if the state was afraid the speed limit could sue it over being lowered, asked what harm might be done by lowering the speed limit. \\"Urging drivers to slow down as they near an intersection is never a bad thing.\\" A year after the crash, Floyd Guernsey, a Schoharie town councilman who lives near the intersection, recounted at a meeting that he had seen more accidents than he could count there, even since October 2018. He suggested that the only solution would be permanently closing Route 30 at the top of the hill. \\"I think most people would be fine with taking the extra two minutes to go around\\", he said, suggesting a barricade at the top of the hill would be as much a monument to the victims as the actual monument then planned for the site. Tavenner agreed but reminded the board that the state DOT would have to agree, and the board resolved to make that request. =Inspection stations= On October 15, the Times-Union reported that the limousine had received a valid inspection sticker from a state Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) inspection station, which it should not have. Vehicles designed to carry more than 10 passengers had, since 2011, been subject to inspection by the DOT, and privately operated repair shops licensed to do inspections are legally required to refuse them to such vehicles unless they have a waiver allowing them to do so. The limousine also had livery license plates, which again it could not have legally borne due to its high passenger capacity. In late November the Times-Union followed up on the story. Both the truck stop in Wilton that had issued the Excursion its first sticker in July 2016, and the Mavis Discount Tire in Saratoga Springs that had issued the second one in May 2018, 10 months after the first one had lapsed, were still offering inspections. Neither business would comment to the newspaper. The DMV likewise refused to say whether it had taken any action, citing the ongoing criminal investigation into the crash. Five months later the newspaper reported that the Excursion had first come to DOT's attention in June 2017 when Chad Smith, one of its investigators visiting the Saratoga Springs Mavis had seen the Excursion in the shop's lot. He noticed that it had livery plates, which can legally be placed only on unstretched \\"town car\\" limousines (or \\"black cars\\" in New York City). At work he checked the car's registration and found it was approved for 11 seats, confirming his suspicions; records showed it was registered to the Hussain's companies and address. An email to them received no reply, and Smith was unable to contact them until January 2018, when he found their advertisements online, after which he issued a violation notice after being quoted nearly $700 for a rental, and only in April was he able to actually inspect the vehicle and order it off the road, he told state police. Seven months later, Ferlazzo told the Times-Union he believed that the Mavis inspection would be a more significant aspect of both the civil and criminal case than was apparent at that time. Attorneys for the other victims' families were also looking into the company's role in the accident, and were, Ferlazzo suggested, encountering resistance. \\"People are circling the wagons\\" he told the newspaper. In October 2019, the Times-Union reported that a former manager at Mavis had told investigators the month before that it had falsified its records of repairs, including those it allegedly performed on the Excursion, in order to meet corporate sales quotas. In May 2018, he had purchased a brake master cylinder from a nearby auto parts store to install in the limousine, but another employee told him later that it had not been even though Prestige had been billed for that work, and he returned it to the store. Other brake work done on the vehicle at different times had not actually been done, he also claimed. Hussain's defense team suggested that their client had been deceived by Mavis as well and that the store's fraudulent practices were the real cause of the accident. A Mavis spokesman defended the chain's business practices and said many of the defense's claims were inaccurate, without going into any specifics. Paul Davenport, who had as attorney for Erin and Shane 's families sued Mavis, said that even if the defense claims were true Hussain was still at least civilly liable since passenger safety was his responsibility. Mallery concurred in a letter to the court a week after the story was reported, writing that there were other problems with the Excursion's brakes that a diligent owner would have become aware of and addressed. The prosecution's expert, Brian Chase, had concluded the master cylinder was functional, and had recently been replaced, when the accident occurred, she noted. In response, Hussain's lawyers continued to blame Mavis. Arrest of Nauman Hussain On October 10, state police arrested Nauman Hussain, the operator of the limousine company and son of the owner, in Watervliet and charged him with criminally negligent homicide, a Class E felony, the least serious under the New York Penal Law. He was taken to County Court in Cobleskill and arraigned, after which he pleaded not guilty to the charge, posted $150,000 bond and was released. District Attorney Susan Mallery asked for higher bail than usual to be set for a nonviolent felony, and for the court to require that Hussain surrender any passports he might have, due to the perception of a flight risk. Upon his arrest, she told the court, his vehicle was packed with his personal belongings, including several suitcases. Kindlon said his client had no passports to surrender, and was not even a citizen of Pakistan. It was later reported that he had surrendered his U.S. passport, and a state police inventory of his belongings made public in October 2019 included an airplane ticket and passport application Hussain had not been fleeing, Kindlon said, but moving in response to death threats he had received; investigators did not find that claim credible. Kindlon said he, too, had received threats, and as a result, there was a greater police presence in the courtroom. If convicted of just that charge, Hussain would face from 15 months to four years in prison. Kindlon added, however, that he had been advised the state could press 20 counts of the charge, one for each victim, and ask for the terms to be served consecutively, which would result in a 26‚Äì80-year sentence. He complained that the state had \\"jumped the gun\\", since Mallery had told him the day before that charges might not be filed for months, due to the seriousness of the accident. Kindlon conceded the limo had minor safety issues which the state told Prestige to fix, but said it did not reach the criminal level. He claimed that DOT had evidence that the brakes had been repaired in June. When asked why the state did not have a record of this repair, he told reporters, \\"That's a great question for DOT\\". A DOT spokesman had previously stated that in the wake of failing the September inspection, a large sticker indicating the vehicle was \\"unserviceable\\" was placed on the windshield; the sticker also has language warning that anyone other than an inspector who removes it can be fined for doing so. It was found, crumpled, on the front seat of Hussain's Infiniti QX56 after his arrest. Even if all the violations had been corrected, the company would have been required to have the vehicle reinspected in its entirety. He called Kindlon's claim that they were fixed \\"categorically false\\". The arrest was not Hussain's first. After a 2014 traffic stop in Cohoes, police said he and his brother Shahyer, who was driving, attempted to pass themselves off as the other. Police eventually learned their true identities. Shahyer's license had been revoked after several dozen suspensions; Nauman's license had been suspended several times but was valid at the time. Nauman was charged with false personation and conspiracy, both misdemeanors; the disposition of the charges is not known. It was reported that a Bentley Continental GT owned by Shahyer had been destroyed in a suspicious 2013 fire. Suspicions first arose at a Queensbury garage after the mechanic repairing it found that damage to the transmission appeared to have been deliberately inflicted and was thus not covered by the warranty. However, no charges were ever filed. Within a month of the crash, prosecutors began presenting evidence against Hussain to a Schoharie County grand jury. In February 2019, Hussain retained Joe Tacopina as defense attorney, who criticized the impasse between the state and the NTSB as an effort to protect a weak case. He accused the state of \\"trying to get evidence to match their misguided theory\\". =Trial= On April 5, 2019, just before the six-month deadline to do so, the grand jury indicted Hussain on 20 counts each of criminally negligent homicide and second-degree manslaughter. Mallery declined to discuss details at a news conference afterward. Kindlon had not seen the indictment paperwork, but he called it \\"flawed [and] fundamentally at odds with itself.\\" A week later, Hussain was free on $450,000 bond. His lawyers argued he was not a flight risk; Kindlon said Hussain had stronger ties to the region than he himself did. Mallery withdrew her request for a source hearing after Tacopina objected, saying that Hussain had not been charged with running a criminal enterprise. Trial was set for September. Later in the week, after Kindlon had reviewed the indictment, he was still dismissive. \\"They've never once asked for him to come back here and explain what happened, never once asked to interview him\\", he told WNYT. \\"[It] really makes me think that they just reached out and grabbed the closest person they could.\\" The bail application Kindlon filed for Hussain suggested three points the station speculated he might be planning to use in defending his client: that the state was simultaneously arguing that Hussain knew the limousine was unsafe and that he did not know, that the state's own evidence shows that he was trying to keep the vehicle in proper repair and that the intersection's design was a greater cause of the accident. Late in May, a defense filing by Tacopina opposing a prosecution request for a sample of Hussain's DNA to compare with any left on the \\"unserviceable\\" sticker removed from the Excursion cited a prosecution report from a month before which had concluded that \\"catastrophic brake failure\\" was the reason for the accident. A New Hampshire consultant retained by the state police had written that the right rear disc brake caliper pistons were inoperable, that the crossover rear brake line was severely corroded resulting in a burst line, and that two of the other wheels had reduced braking efficiencies due to poor condition. Although inspectors had ordered the vehicle out of service and placed the sticker a month before the accident, Tacopina argued that none of the violations cited at that time concerned the affected portions of the brake; the hanging line that was specifically noted was part of the antilock brake system which was not involved in the crash. Therefore, he said, the issue of the removed sticker was \\"a red herring\\" as far as the cause of the accident was concerned. On June 17, Bartlett ordered Husain to provide a DNA sample within ten days. Since the defense had only received access to the limousine and its parts a week before the filing, Hussain's trial has been postponed to January 2020. In June 2019, the court approved Mallery's request for Gail Heatherly, an assistant state attorney general and former Manhattan prosecutor, to join her team, which only includes one other full-time assistant and two part-time prosecutors, due to the case's \\"unusual complexity\\". In August the state police forensics lab found a DNA match between Hussain and the discarded sticker. Kindlon said that did not prove any theory of how it got there, only that it was there. \\"It's an evidentiary nullity,\\" he said. He argued that test results on the limousine's brake fluid, which he was awaiting, would shed more light on how the accident happened and who might be responsible. At the beginning of September Kindlon and Tacopina filed an omnibus motion seeking several actions. First, they asked that all charges be dismissed for \\"insufficient evidence\\", a standard defense motion that is often denied, as well as for unforeseeability. Were the trial to be held, they asked to suppress Hussain's statements to police after the accident. Lastly they asked that Mallery turn over a transcript of the grand jury proceedings to them, and disclose any aspects of Hussain's prior arrest record they might introduce at trial as evidence against him. Hearings on the matter and any other pretrial motions will be held in early November. At the end of the month Bartlett gave Mallery three weeks to turn over the requested information. The court later released some of the documents Mallery had filed; in one of them she had said that among the materials they would turn over as potentially exculpatory was a security camera video from Mavis. What it depicted was not known. Barlett again postponed the trial until March 2020. In her response, filed in late October, Mallery appended the full report on the crash by the prosecution's expert, Brian Chase, which attributed it to \\"catastrophic brake failure\\" caused by neglect of the vehicle. Chase dismissed defense contentions that Mavis's alleged fraud left Hussain with the mistaken impression that the master cylinder had been replaced when it actually had not, since he had found the cylinder to be functional and recently installed. Mallery also explained that the Mavis security camera footage from April 2018 showed the manager who had alleged the fraud told an employee who had informed him that the Excursion's calipers, hoses and master cylinder all needed to be replaced that Hussain only needed a \\"temporary\\" repair since he planned to sell the vehicle; footage from the actual inspection in May shows the manager telling Hussain that \\"[it] brakes now and I'm hoping it stays that way because if it happens again you're gonna need the other three calipers.\\" Mallery added that Hussain had also been informed of the issues with Lisinicchia's license as a result of a traffic stop two months before the accident. Judge Bartlett denied the motion by the end of the month, ruling that there was sufficient evidence to support the charges when interpreted in the light most favorable to the prosecution. Hearings were scheduled on a defense motion to suppress statements Hussain made to DOT inspectors and investigators from March 2018 onwards, when they had first approached him about the issues with the Excursion. Bartlett also allowed the defense to review the grand jury transcript, although he denied their request to make them public. In late November Bartlett also ruled the statements Hussain made to state police before and shortly after the crash were admissible, since he was not in custody and the police interest was \\"investigatory, not accusatory.\\" Kindlon called the decision \\"100 percent expected.\\" Since the defense had been able to inspect and review materials it had not previously had access too, \\"in that sense, it was a win for us.\\" Two months later, Bartlett again postponed the trial date to early May 2020. At a news conference afterwards, Tacopina said that the prosecution had been slowed by bail reform laws in New York that had gone into effect at the beginning of the year, which also required that the state provide defendants with the names of witnesses against them earlier in the process than it previously had; it was at the time awaiting results from a Texas lab analyzing liquids found at the scene. While Hussain could have had his bail exonerated under those laws as well, Tacopina added, he chose not to out of respect for the victims' families. After a late February pretrial hearing, Tacopina speculated about whether a truly impartial jury could be found due to the small size of the Schoharie County jury pool. It might, he thought, be difficult to find jurors who did not know, or had not formed an opinion on, the crash. He did not think he would have to request a change of venue, though. The COVID-19 pandemic, which led to a statewide stay-at-home order in mid-March, has delayed the trial further since Schoharie County has suspended all jury trials until normal court operations can resume. Kindlon said a March 30 hearing was postponed; he was hopeful that the court might be able to handle some matters via teleconferences. Possible plea deal In July it was reported that a plea deal was being considered after Mary Ashton, victim Kenneth Ukaj's mother, reported receiving a memo from the state police's crime-victims unit suggesting the possibility, which she was unhappy about. Mallery, according to lawyers for the victims' families, fears the case may be too complex for a jury to understand; she confirmed her office had been talking to Hussain's attorneys. If Hussain takes a plea, he will likely be sentenced to time served under his bail conditions and probation, without any prison time. Ashton feared that the state was seeking the plea deal partly to avoid testimony about DOT and DMV's lax oversight of Prestige. The state might also have been concerned about the defendant's connection to Malik Riaz Hussain, the Pakistani billionaire and brother of Shahed Hussain, Nauman's father. Attorneys for other families, and several members of those families, said at a later news conference that while they were not opposed to a plea deal, they wanted any such arrangement to require that Hussain allocute, or state the facts of the crime, in open court when pleading, to resolve the contradictory accounts of the Excursion's maintenance from himself and Mavis. Such a statement would be admissible as evidence in civil proceedings. Aftermath Governor Cuomo released a statement which expressed his heartbreak for the victims, commended first responders for helping through the night, and noted the state police were working with federal and local authorities to investigate the crash. On October 8, Prestige refunded the $1,475 Axel Steenburg had paid for the limo to his credit card. Hussain was arrested the same day. The Steenburg family had not asked for the money back. The Apple Barrel Country Store began to collect donations for local first responders, a mostly volunteer organization, and planned a vigil to honor the victims at the store on October 9. The family that owns it said it was establishing a non-profit organization to build a permanent memorial at the crash site next to the store. They hoped it could be completed by the first anniversary of the crash. The 20 wooden crosses placed at the site as a temporary memorial were donated to the state museum in September 2019. Thousands attended an Amsterdam candlelight vigil for the victims along the banks of the Mohawk River on the evening of October 8; many residents of the city knew at least one of the dead. Since three of the dead had been state employees, Cuomo ordered all state government agencies to fly the flags outside their buildings at half-staff on October 11. Funeral services for eight victims‚Äîthe four sisters, their three husbands and one husband's brother‚Äîwere held at St. Stanislaus Roman Catholic Church in the city a week after the crash. Hundreds paid respects at the wake the day before, including Tonko and state Assemblyman Angelo Santabarbara, whose district includes Amsterdam. One victim, Adam Jackson, had been a Republican deputy commissioner of elections for Montgomery County. His death had distracted his coworkers so much that the absentee ballots they sent out for the November elections accidentally omitted a line for Republican congressional candidate Joe Vitollo. When the mistake was discovered, new ballots were mailed to 89 voters in the town of Amsterdam who had received the incorrect ones. On October 28, Healing Schoharie, a non-profit founded to help the victims' families and first responders to the accident, held a benefit concert at Mohawk Harbor in Schenectady, raising $43,000. To reach the organization's $50,000 goal, Healing Schoharie reached out to Bruce Springsteen via the Backstreets fanzine. In May 2019 the singer autographed a poster from the concert to be auctioned on eBay; the $1,525 winning bid, helped Healing Schoharie reach that target by the end of that month. The money will be used first for a dinner in honor of the first responders, then for building a permanent memorial at the site. At the same time the Reflections Memorial Foundation, the non-profit set up by the Apple Barrel, unveiled its design for a permanent memorial at the site based on an idea suggested by Janet Steenburg, mother of two of the victims; the store would donate the land. It would consist primarily of 20 concrete stepping stones; each one would have a print of one victim's shoes. Around the base of the memorial would be the words \\"You left your footprints on this Earth as a reminder you were here, we know you walk together and are forever near\\" carved in stone. In June 2019 the town of Guilderland held a softball tournament in memory of Patrick Cushing, who had grown up there and played many sports, at the field he had once played on. Ten teams competed; all the money raised was donated to the Amsterdam Youth Sports Association. Afterwards, a memorial bench with his name on it was unveiled. The street in front of Wilbur H. Lynch Literacy Academy, one of the Amsterdam school district's two middle schools, has been named Abby Jackson Way after Adam's wife, since she taught reading there. =Civil litigation= In late November, the parents of Amanda Rivenburg, one of the limousine passengers, filed the first civil lawsuit related to the accident. Their action, brought in Supreme Court for Albany County, named Shahed and Nauman Hussain as defendants, making many of the same allegations of negligence that state investigators had already publicized. Their suit did not specify any amount of monetary damages they were seeking, as their attorney, Sal Ferlazzo, indicated they were just trying to find out what had happened. He also said they would be suing governmental entities such as state agencies in a separate action in the state's Court of Claims. If they did, those lawsuits might have less chance of succeeding, due to the outcome of similar actions against the state brought by the families of victims of the 2005 Ethan Allen accident, where a small tour boat on Lake George capsized in the wake of a bigger one, killing 20. The NTSB had later faulted state regulators for not reducing the boat's passenger capacity; however the state's highest court, the Court of Appeals, had dismissed the suit, holding that the facts of the case did not create an exception to the state's sovereign immunity, a legal doctrine under which governments it applies to can be sued only if they allow themselves to be. A lawyer who had represented some of those victims, and had been retained by two of the families of limousine crash victims, told the Times Union that the state's more direct role in regulating Prestige might result in a different verdict. In March 2019, attorneys for the Hussains filed their answer to the Rivenburgs' lawsuit. They asserted a range of affirmative defenses, such as that the plaintiffs contributed to their own deaths by failing to wear the seatbelts in the limousine, and that the crash as a whole was an act of God for which their clients could not be held liable. An attorney for the Rivenburgs characterized the defense as \\"boilerplate\\", suggesting that the Hussains' attorneys chose to raise an array of standard defenses without settling on one or two that might be best suited to the instant case. Two months later, Global Liberty Insurance, which had covered the Excursion at the time of the crash, filed court papers saying its liability for the accident was capped at $500,000. Divided among all 20 victims, that meant some families would receive, at most, $25,000‚Äîand that was before legal fees the company's lawyer sought to have deducted. Ferlazzo called the insurer's motions \\"outrageous and an insult to the victims\\". A personal-injury lawyer consulted by the Times-Union agreed that \\"these families are getting screwed\\" and that as things stood they were not likely to see any more money from Global Liberty. However, it was possible that they could recover additional money from the victims' own insurance companies, if the victims had cars of their own, since New York requires all motorists to have supplemental uninsured motorist coverage as part of their mandated auto insurance policies, and Lisinicchia was not listed as a driver on Prestige's policy for the limousine. At the end of August, family members of Erin and Shane , another of the married couples killed in the crash, sued Mavis Discount Tire, alleging poor repair work on the limousine and the alleged illegal inspection by the chain's Saratoga store contributed to the McGowans' deaths; \\"They played a role here\\", said their lawyer. \\"We're going to hold them accountable.\\" Prestige, too, was named as a defendant. In 2020 the Rivenburgs joined other plaintiffs in adding Mavis as a defendant. While Mavis said it sympathized with the crash victims, the company \\"bears no legal responsibility for this tragedy and the events that led up to it, and we will defend ourselves vigorously against all claims.\\" It was possible that the plaintiffs could recover more from Mavis than they could from Prestige due to the latter's liability cap. The McGowans were joined in suing both defendants by the mother of Matthew Coons, killed along with his girlfriend Savannah Bursese, in October, the day after the first anniversary of the crash, in Fulton County Court. Her lawyer and Ferlazzo have both indicated that after the criminal trial, when more evidence is available, they planned to add the state DOT as a defendant. The McGowans' attorneys would not wait that long for the state's evidence. In December they sued DOT and DMV in Supreme Court for Albany County in the name of the two victims' estates after those agencies denied their requests for records under the state's Freedom of Information Law (FOIL) pertaining to the inspections of the limousine, citing the ongoing investigations, just as they had in response to requests from media organizations. The estate argued that neither agency cited a specific statute or precedent that applied to that. Some of the information they sought has since been made available in prosecution filings in the criminal case, but the McGowans' lawyers maintained that it should have been disclosed under FOIL in response to their request over the summer. In May 2020 an Albany County state Supreme Court justice agreed with their argument on appeal that the investigations were insufficient justification for withholding the records and ordered them released within 20 days. Late the following month the state announced it would appeal that decision. In mid- September Jaclyn Schnurr, the wife and daughter of Brian Hough and James Schnurr respectively, the two pedestrian victims, filed suit in Supreme Court for Cayuga County. In addition to Hussain and Mavis as defendants, she named the Apple Barrel Country Store, whose parking lot she had been in with her husband and father when the Excursion struck them just feet away from her, claiming that the store should have put up barriers to prevent crashes into its parking lot since it knew that the intersection was dangerous. The accident was not the first time vehicles that could or did not stop at the bottom of the hill had gone into the store's parking lot. The store's owners could not be reached for comment. The family of another victim, Amanda Halse, filed their lawsuit a month later. Like the other plaintiffs, they have named Mavis and the Hussains as defendants. The Halses have additionally named Pakistani business magnate Malik Riaz Hussain, Shahed's brother, since he allegedly financed the Hussains' acquisition of the Wilton motel where Prestige is based; his name is on the deeds to the Wilton motel Shahed and Nauman operate. Shortly before Christmas, seven more victims' families filed two separate suits. The first names the state as defendant, alleging it was negligent both in ensuring the intersection and Prestige were safe. The second, filed in Supreme Court for Montgomery County, names Prestige, the Hussains and Mavis as defendants, with the same allegations as those made by other plaintiffs. A June 2020 suit filed by the family of victim Michael Ukaj, in Saratoga County, goes into greater detail in alleging Mavis's liability. Prestige's drivers, including Lisnicchia, refused when possible to drive the Excursion as they were aware of its inadequate braking capability, the Ukaj family claims. Employees at Mavis, the Ukajes' complaint says, were aware that repair work the shop had done to the limousine's brakes was insufficient and that problems remained. Two years before the accident, the suit alleged, a Mavis mechanic put a vice grip on the bent left rear brake line following a rotor replacement, leaving the vehicle reliant almost entirely on its front brakes, and in May 2018 the store put a valid inspection sticker on the Excursion without performing the inspection. Mavis denied responsibility and said it will ask to be removed as a defendant from all suits filed against it over the crash. At the end of August of that year, lawyers hired by Hussain's insurance company filed their response to the Steenburg family's action. They claimed that the plaintiffs should have been aware of the risks of limousine travel, and by embarking on the journey they \\"willingly and voluntarily assumed\\" them. Ferlazzo, not representing the Steenburgs, called the defense \\"dubious\\", since people hire those vehicles and their drivers on the assumption that they are safe. The defense also claimed the passengers' failure to wear seatbelts contributed to their deaths; the NTSB's preliminary report said those seatbelts had not been installed properly and were unreachable. Just prior to the crash's second anniversary, Lisnicchia's family sued the Hussains and Mavis, citing the vehicle's poorly maintained brakes as the cause of the driver's death.

A member of the Republican Party, Bond also served as the Majority Whip and President of the Senate. Prior to his tenure in the Kansas Senate, he served as an assistant to three members of the United States House of Representatives. Bond was born in Kansas and practiced law after graduating from the University of Kansas. He served as a city attorney and as an administrative assistant to Representatives Robert Ellsworth, Larry Winn, and Jan Meyers. In 1986, he was appointed to the Kansas Senate to fill the vacancy caused by Jack D. Walker's election as lieutenant governor. In 1992, he was selected to serve as the Majority Whip for the Republicans and was later selected to serve as the President of the Senate in 1997. After leaving the Kansas Senate he served on the Kansas Board of Regents until his term expired in 2007. During the 2014 and 2018 gubernatorial elections he supported the Democratic nominees and opposed the policies of Governor Sam Brownback and the right-ward shift of the Republican Party. Early life and education Richard Lee Bond was born on September 18, 1935, in Kansas City, Kansas, to Ivy and Florine Bond. He gradated from Shawnee Mission High School, and then from the University of Kansas with a bachelor's degree in political science in 1957, and a Juris Doctor in 1960. In 1958, he married Suzanne Sedgwich and had two children with her. After graduating from law school he served as a lawyer in Mission, Kansas, and later served as the first city attorney of Overland Park, Kansas. Career =Congressional aide= From 1961 to 1985, Bond served as an administrative assistant to Representatives Robert Ellsworth, Larry Winn, and Jan Meyers. When Winn announced his retirement in 1983, Governor John W. Carlin stated that Bond was a likely candidate for the Republican nomination to succeed Winn. However, he chose to not seek the Republican nomination. He was retained as an administrative assistant by Representative Meyers who was elected to succeed Winn. =Kansas Senate= Elections In 1986, Mike Hayden and Jack D. Walker won the Kansas gubernatorial election. Walker, a member of the Kansas Senate, would have to resign and have a replacement selected by the Johnson County Republican precinct committeemen appointed by Governor Hayden. On December 1, Bond was appointed to serve the remaining two years of Walker's term by Governor Hayden after being unanimously selected by the Johnson County Republican committeemen. On June 10, 1992, he filed to run for reelection and won reelection without opposition. In 1996, he won reelection without opposition. Bond did not seek reelection during the 2000 elections.

In 1990, the Kansas House of Representatives voted 85 to 35 in favor of the legislation and the Kansas Senate voted 24 to 15 in favor before Governor Hayden signed the legislation into law on May 18. While the state legislature was discussing possible ways to have Kansas exempted from the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, as it would cost millions and state law would have to be extensively changed to become compliant with federal law, Bond proposed enacting automatic voter registration for all eligible people. =Health= In 1988, Bond supported legislation that would define AIDS as a non-communicable disease as that would prevent school districts from prohibiting children with HIV or AIDS from attending school.

He is a significant representative of colored realism in Serbian art. Also, he was instrumental in choosing the art in Pavle Beljanski Memorial Collection. Biography As a young high school graduate, Jefto Periƒá went to work as a photographer‚Äôs assistant in the studio of Mihailo Merƒáep in Zagreb. There Periƒá decided that painting was a career for him. He first attended the Arts and Crafts College, and then at various private art academies in Zagreb where he learned to hone his craft. In Munich his art teachers were Carl Johann Becker-Gundahl (1856-1925) and Hans Hoffmann, and in Paris at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des beaux-arts, where his mentor was Paul Signac. He copied the works of the great masters in the Louvre, where he attained superior artistic skills. It was in Paris that he met Pavle Beljanski and numerous other distinguished Serbian intellectuals from all walks of life. Periƒá struck a friendship with Beljanski that was to last until the death of the art collector. Between the two world wars Beljanski was working hard on expanding his collection, and in 1935 when Jefto Periƒá moved back to Belgrade, Beljanski authorized him to choose and buy pieces while he promoted the works of the artists through organizing exhibitions and writing reviews for art magazines. Periƒá was a member of ULUS and Lada and a regular participant in the exhibitions of these associations. He exhibited independently in Zagreb in 1927 and in Belgrade in 1936, 1939 and 1951. The concept of the exhibition, in addition to the complex cooperation on the collector-artist relationship, is based on Periƒá's works created over a long period of time, from the student drawings from 1914 to the late achievements of the mature creator.

The Brunton Theatre in Musselburgh is named after his family. Owner of a large wireworks he was the creator of lenticular line, used for aircraft production. Originally called Bruntonised wire, due to inadequate patenting the creation was taken over by the Royal Aircraft Factory in 1912 and this streamlined (non-circular) wire was thereafter called RAF wire. Life The Brunton family grave, Inveresk He was born in East Lothian in 1837 and spent most of his life in Musselburgh. In 1870 W. N. Brunton (either his father or older brother) opened \\"W. N. Brunton\\" a metalworks in Musselburgh known as the Seamill. It was one of the first British manufacturers to employ a high number of female workers. In 1876 John opened the Brunton Wire Works in Musselburgh. The company made specialist wires such as piano wire. In 1888 they began making wire rope (mainly for shipping or dock use). In 1909 he first created streamlined galvanised aircraft wire and offered it to the War Office. The War Office was impressed but effectively stole his idea, patenting it as \\"RAF Wire\\". However, they returned to Bruntons as the only factory capable of actually making the wire. The wires were originally made in Duraluminum but quickly changed to the more reliable steel. Over and above aircraft wires, Brunton's wartime work included 100,000 rifle rods, field telephone wires, anti-submarine nets and bomb-proof nets for buildings. After the war the decline in need for wire brought diversification, with the company branching into spark plugs and cinema projectors. In 1931 they took over the rival company George Elliot & Co. John Brunton died in 1937. He is buried in Inveresk cemetery with his wife, who died in 1899. His name is written on the reverse of the large red granite monument and is only visible from the northern cemetery. The monument includes a stone bench on its south side.

Sobir established his reputation during the Soviet era. His poems, books, and articles have been published throughout the former Soviet Union and translated into Western languages, as well as Persian, Dari, Uzbek, Slavic languages, and several other languages of the Soviet Republics.Radio Free Europe. https://www.rferl.org/a/tajikistan-bozor-sobir-poet-former- opposition-figure-dies-at-79/29204740.html His poetry books were also published in Afghanistan and Iran.World Literature Today Vol. 70, No. 3, Literatures of Central Asia (Summer, 1996), p. 574 Sobir's poetic style is known for its imagery, nationalism, patriotism, its inclusion of the history of the Tajik people, and also for its strong political views. Many of his poems have been set to music by various Tajik composers. After his poem We are of Siyovush's Bloodline (Az Khuni Siyovushem) was set to music, it became the de facto Tajikistan national anthem. As a poet, he contributed much to the revival of Tajik national culture after Mikhail Gorbachev's call for perestroika.Shahrbonu Tadjbakhsh, The New York Times, 1993 https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/05/opinion/l-in-new-tajikistan-islam-can-be-a- crime-702493.html Many Tajiks know his poems by heart. Sobir is a laureate of a prestigious National Rudaki Poetry Award, Tajikistan's most eminent prize for poetry (1988) and the Star of the President 3rd degree (2013). With the advent of glasnost, Sobir became actively involved in political and cultural movements for an independent national identity. He was one of the founders of the Democratic Party, serving as its deputy leader.REEU Newsletter, 1991 Autumn The Democratic Party was the secular component of the Democratic- Islamic coalition that governed Tajikistan in 1992, until it was overthrown by pro-communist forces with Russian military support.The Jamestown Foundation. Tajik Opposition Activists Pardoned. https://jamestown.org/program/tajik- opposition-activists-pardoned/ He was elected a senator in the Supreme Council of Tajikistan, but resigned from this post and remains the only politician to have done so. He also subsequently resigned from the party, reportedly because of a disagreement with the leadership over the growing Islamic elements within the party. A strong proponent of separation of state and religion, Sobir believed religious figures should not engage in politics. Sobir remains popular in Tajikistan and is the best-known Tajik poet outside the country.Wilks, Judith M. World Literature Today Vol. 70, No. 3, Literatures of Central Asia Numerous books have been written about him and his poems. A play about his life called A Night Away from Homeland (Shabe Dur Az Vatan) was performed by the Tajik State Theater named after M. Vakhidov, with the role of Sobir played by the Honored Artist of Tajikistan, Abdumumin Sharifi. Biography =Early years and education= Bozor Sobir was born on 20 November 1938 in Sufiyen, which is part of the city of Ordzhonikidzobod (now Vahdat District) in Tajikistan. He is the fourth-youngest of seven children. After his father died at an early age, he was sent to study at a boarding school in Hisor in western Tajikistan, about from the capital of Dushanbe.National Library of Tajikistan. Bozor Sobir. http://kmt.tj/bozor- sobir-shoiri-daroshnoi-millat-darguzasht There, he met Turkish poet Nazim Hikmet, who visited the school as a speaker. The poet's father was a government tax collector. His mother was a housewife. His younger brother Temur Sobirov was a respected mathematician, with a school and a street named after him in Tajikistan.Temur Sobirov Museum. His second youngest brother, also a mathematician, ran for a Senate seat. The poet's nephew, another mathematician, was the head of a Democratic Party in Tajikistan until his resignation in the 2000s. Another relative was head of the now-banned Islamic Renaissance Party of Tajikistan (IRPT), whose closure Bozor Sobir had advocated.Islam News. July 2013. http://islamnews.tj/tajikistan/768-bozor- sobir-oni-mully-ya-poet.html His other siblings went into teaching. The first publication of Bozor Sobir's poetry was in 1960, while he was a university student. In 1962, he completed his graduate work in philology and Tajik- Persian literature at the Tajik National University. =Writing career= After completing his studies, Sobir served as a translator in Afghanistan for a year. Thereafter, he worked at various newspapers and magazines in Soviet Tajikistan, including Education and Culture (), Voice of the East (Sadoi Shark), and Justice (Adolat). He was also commissioned to translate works of British poet and politician Lord Byron, French poets Arthur Rimbaud and Guillaume Apollinaire, Chilean poet and politician Pablo Neruda, Russian poet Sergei Yesenin and Lithuanian-Soviet poet Eduardas Mie≈æelaitis. In 1979, he began working at the Writers' Union of Tajikistan as a poetry and editorial consultant.Denber, R. Human Rights in Tajikistan: In the Wake of Civil War. Helsinki Watch. At their request, he edited and improved the poems of almost all famous Tajik poets throughout his lifetime, though he worked at the Writers' Union for ten years. Literary work =Style and contribution= The poems of Bozor Sobir are characterized by their novel form, penetrating lyricism, high spirituality, and a tense search for truth and beauty in work and love. Defining motifs are: the ancient and recent history of Tajikistan's people; the formation of national identity in the complex, changing world of the end of the 20th century; the comprehension of modernity through the moral experience of a man of the post-war generation; the beauty of his native land; and intimate lyrics with features of the mythological understanding of women and nature.¬´–í—ñ—á–Ω—ñ –∫–∞–º–µ–Ω—ñ¬ª –ö–∏–µ–≤, –∏–∑–¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–æ –¶–ö –õ–ö–°–ú–£ ¬´–ú–æ–ª–æ–¥—å¬ª 1989. –†–µ–¥–∞–∫—Ç–æ—Ä –ú. –ì. –í–∞—Å–∏–ª–µ–Ω–∫–æ Sobir contributed much to the revival of Tajik national culture, the formation of the Tajik identity and building of a national consciousness in Tajikistan before, during and after the Soviet era.SHAHRBANOU TADJBAKHSH. In New Tajikistan Islam Can Be a Crime. New York Times 05 Nov 1993 His poems are known for their imagery and creativity. They are nuanced, intricate, and make creative use of grammar, linguistic features, and subtle semantic features. The art of speech as a praise, allegory, and antithesis is used in the artistry and imagery of his poems, which may account for their soulfulness.Tohiriyon, Shahlo. Theoretical problems of poetical language in works of Bozor Sobir (Lexical-semantic aspect). Academy of Sciences of Tajikistan. Institute of Language, Literature and Eastern Studies. 2017 According to a study of his works by Shahlo Tohiriyon, a notable feature of Sobir's poetry is that its style reveals the essence of the concept, the case and the images through comparison and contrasts. Antonyms in various forms and manifestations of meaning are a feature of his poetry. A certain order of application of antonyms and homonyms in the work of the poet indicates that he always expresses his opinion with exact thought about each word. The same use of one of the lexical means of expression, such as synonyms, homonyms and antonyms, is found in almost every poem by Sobir. While a majority of his early poems have romantic elements and imagery of his birthplace, from the late 1970s there is a change in direction: themes of Tajik ancestry, their ancient Zoroastrian religion, history, and patriotism. His poems became highly political, including current national and international events, and at times anti-religious. =Poems of the independence movement= Sobir's poem about the history of Tajiks and the Tajik language, Mother Tongue (Zaboni Modari ), shows indignation about the sad history of the only Persian minority in Central Asia (i.e. the Tajiks). Written on the eve of independence, became an anthem for Tajik nationalists at the time. The poem tells the history of Tajiks, their accomplishments, great figures, and the losses. The poem highlights the importance of the Tajik language in maintaining the Tajik nation. The poem was written when Russian was the dominating language in Tajikistan, and the Tajik language had been relegated to unofficial non- governmental matters.Van Den Berg, Gabrielle. PERCEPTIONS OF POETRY. SOME EXAMPLES OF LATE 20TH CENTURY TAJIK POETRY. Oriente Moderno, Nuova serie, Anno 22 (83), Nr. 1, La letteratura persiana contemporanea tra novazione e tradizione (2003), pp. 37-56 Sobir saw the promotion of the Tajik language for Tajik people, during the predominance of use of Russian in Soviet times, as of utmost importance. He was one of the very few who actively wrote and politically worked to ignite people's awareness about Tajik identity, history, and traditions.Nooshin, L. Music and the Play of Power in the Middle East, North Africa and Central Asia The feeling of having been robbed throughout history is prominent in this poem, as is the resentment about the fact that Bukhara and Samarkand, the ancient Iranian cities and the traditional centers of the Tajiks' literature and culture, were in 1929 allotted to Uzbekistan by the foundation of the Soviet Republics. Bukhara and Samarkand feature as lost Tajik treasures, and ancient pre-Islamic Zoroastrian heritage is placed in the foreground (as can be seen by references made to the Shahnameh figures Rostam and Sohrab, the Soghdians). The poem expresses the quest for lost roots. These sentiments amalgamated in the formation of new political parties, such as Rastokhez (). This party in particular was focusing on Iran as a political example. Although Sobir was one of the founders of the Democratic Party, he wrote On the Foundation of Resurrection, published in 1991. This poem an open support of opposition and rebellion and is much less acquiescent than Sobir's earlier work. The poem Square of Freedom (Maydoni Ozodi) conjured the electrified atmosphere of the square where protests for independence took place. The calls for independence were seen as returning and embracing one's forgotten roots. The poem elevates the square to the nation's place of prayer. =Poetry of the civil war= During the Tajikistani Civil War (1992‚Äì1997), Sobir wrote poems about the tragedy of the war:The River Was Once a Drop of Water: Tajik Poetry in the Past Six Years. World Literature Today, Summer 1996, Vol.70(3), p.577 > Warm blood shed through love of blood relations Bridges of kinship broken In > the waters of orphans' eyes. My Kulob has heedlessly gone its way - Gone, > perhaps, until the day of Resurrection. No bridge is left but that across > the chasm of Hell, Alas, alas! The bridge refers to the Chinvat Bridge of Zoroastrianism (the religion of Tajiks before Islam), which is \\"finer than a hair and sharper than a sword\\" over which all must pass to the hereafter. A sifting bridge, the righteous will cross safely while the wicked will tumble into the infernal fires. =Poetry of secularism= Some years following his exile, some of Sobir's poems developed a new anti-Islam theme. The poet saw religion as a menace to development and progress of society, and felt that religious leaders had contributed nothing concrete toward improving the lives of humans. One poem ironically praised Vladimir Lenin and compared him to religious leaders and prophets for similar contributions to the development and progress of Tajik people and Tajikistan. His poems criticizing religion caused a furor, especially among the religious, which has yet to settle down. Sobir was also a proponent of bettering the standing of women in society, and for equality of the genders. When he was told a common saying in a form of a wish, such as \\"may your wife be always at your service\\", the poet would retort \\"What kind of a wish is that? Is my wife my slave to always be at my service?\\" He saw religion as a major contributing factor in the lower status of women in society, their limited freedom, submission of women to men, and their forced role as de facto servants. He penned multiple poems criticizing the role religion enforces on women, including the rhyming poem titled Entombed Alive, Women in Muslim Nations (Zani Khalki Musulmon Zindadargur): > No one fights with their enemies like Islam fights with women from cradle to > grave... Women in Muslim nations, while alive are consigned to the grave, > When women die they deepen their grave. Alas, Islam's poems lack love for > women, They are not situated to voice their opinion. There are none like > women so ill-fated, Concealed life-long and black-fated. After the 2015 murder of Farkhunda Malikzada, who was stoned to death over four hours and then incinerated at the center of Kabul, Afghanistan, for allegedly burning a copy of the Koran, Sobir wrote Nowruz became a Worldwide Holiday, but Not a Happy One (Idi Navruz Jahoni Shudu Farkhuna Nashud) about the incident: > The death of ill-fated Farkhunda forces me To write at each door and wall > with charcoal: Death to Afghanistan! Prison of women! If this is Islam in > Afghanistan All those bombs shelled by the Yankees on its head Still are not > enough. =Collections= *Link (Paivand) is the first collection of Sobir's poems.

Political life Sobir became involved in politics in the 1980s. He was among the founders of the country's pro-democracy movement, and the Democratic Party. In 1990, he was elected as Senator in the Supreme Council of Tajikistan. He later voluntarily resigned his post, and remains the only politician to do so in Tajikistan's history. He resigned from his position as a deputy leader of the party after Islamic elements joined the movement. Sobir was the first well-known literary figure to join the gatherings at the main square in Dushanbe, the capital, in what became months-long protests. When his political activism was criticized by poets and writers, who were of the opinion that politics was not suited for intellectuals, Sobir responded that poetry is always connected to politics. According to Sobir, \\"A poet must always be with his people.\\" He reasoned that a poet had to be with the people to grasp the emerging culture of the times. To carry out his mission, the poet must be educated, cultured and civilized. Sobir felt that a poet must feel all the problems of the people and reflect them in his work. \\"The poet must respect the culture of the people, he must be the best intellectual of the nation.\\" Sobir was one of the leading planners and orators in the protests. His support and push for independence and democracy, and as one of the leaders of the United Tajik Opposition (UTO) during the Tajikistani Civil War, led many of the known poets to write a collective letter, which was published and submitted to authorities, calling Sobir an extremist and requesting his arrest. Sobir's first collection of poems, Simkhor (), published after his arrest, opens with: > \\"From all the poets, I was the only poet in prison, Others poets were > serving as guards.\\" He became known as the 'conscience of the nation'. =Arrest and trial= Sobir was one of the leaders of the opposition when the civil war erupted. On 26 March 1993, he was arrested at Dushanbe International Airport, where he had reportedly gone to send a parcel to his sons who were studying in Moscow.Denber, Rachel.

His arrest took place without a warrant, and it was only three days afterwards that an official warrant was issued.Amnesty International.

Tajikistan: The Trials of Independence A group of parliamentary guards sympathetic to the demonstrators had taken sixteen parliamentary deputies and two deputy ministers hostage, holding them until the following morning.

Commenting on his detention, a university professor said of Sobir: \\"He was fighting for independence of Tajikistan. Now we celebrate independence and he sits in jail.\\" The trial opened in the Supreme Court of Tajikistan in Dushanbe on 20 September 1993, and proceedings were interrupted multiple times due to threats of violence against the defense lawyers.

On the morning of his disappearance he had been carrying a medical report on Sobir, intending to present it to the authorities in an attempt to secure his release from prison. The trial ended on 29 December 1993 when Sobir was found guilty on all three charges. However, Sobir was immediately released.RFE/RL Research Report: Weekly Analyses from the RFE/RL Research Institute, Volume 3. 1994 Tajikistan President Emomali Rakhmonov had signed a decree pardoning Democratic Party leaders, ordering their release from jail. Specifically, the decree pardoned party chairman Shodmon Yusupov and his two deputies, poet Bozor Sobir, and Oinihol Bobonazarova. There had been international pressure for Sobir's release. Amnesty International stated that the criminal charges against Sobir were without reasonable foundation. Russian President Boris Yeltsin exerted political pressure after being contacted by the Writers' Union of Russia, who themselves had been contacted by Sobir's wife. Rakhmonov ordered the criminal cases closed and exempted Sobir from his suspended sentence of two years. Sobir had been under arrest for nine months and nine days.United States.

The Norwegian Author's Union invited Sobir to attend the Freedom of Expression symposium focusing on seven writers who had been jailed or exiled, including Salmon Rushdie and Bozor Sobir.Madison Wisconsin State Journal September 22, 1994 In 1995, Sobir moved his family to the United States, where he worked at the University of Washington in Seattle, Washington, teaching Tajik in the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilization.Newsletters.

In 2011, almost all of the country's newspapers, including national, regional and district newspapers carried excerpts from an interview with Sobir. In this, Sobir recommended that the authorities limit the Islamization of Tajikistan and dismantle the Islamic Renaissance Party of Tajikistan (IRPT) ‚Äì the only Islamic party in Central Asia ‚Äì stating that if it ever came to power it would reduce the country to a feudal state. This provoked a round-table discussion on the weekly Millat in Dushanbe on 4 March 2011.BBC Monitoring Central Asia. Tajik opposition concerned over \\"persecution\\" by authorities. May 2011. The IRPT was subsequently banned. In 2013, in order to prevent the rise of Islamists in Tajikistan, and for the security of the country, he called on the intelligentsia of the country to support the current secular government. Tajikistan is situated on the borders of Taliban-ruled Afghanistan, with a large Tajik-ethnic population of its own, and near the religiously-ruled Iran. According to him, it was the involvement of the religious elements that caused Tajikistan's civil war. A proponent of separation of religion and the state, Sobir stated that \\"a mosque cannot work with the government. A mosque must do its own job, government its own\\". Solidifying his secularist view in defense of closing the Islamic party, Sobir said that \\"many unnecessary demagogues have emerged in Tajikistan, which must give way to sober-minded forces\\". Following the publication of the statement, the IRPT invited Sobir to discuss matters at a joint conference, which he declined:Islam News. July 2013 http://islamnews.tj/tajikistan/768-bozor-sobir- oni-mully-ya-poet.html Sobir likewise saw value in keeping the Cyrillic alphabet and was against adopting the Arabic alphabet, stating that Russians and Tajiks are strongly linked by history and lineage. In a documentary about Yesenin, Sobir reaffirmed the idea of close roots linking the Russian and Tajik peoples.BBC Monitoring Central Asia. Tajik northern press selection list for 25 Aug 2001 He felt that ties to Russia should never be severed, and Tajikistan should always cooperate with Russia. \\"Tajiks have two languages ‚Äì Russian and Tajik. The Russian people are the closest people for us,\\" he said in a 2016 interview. He saw those who pushed for switching to the Arabic alphabet, and the journalists and editors who replaced commonly used Tajik words with their Arabic equivalents, as an effort to erode the Tajik language and culture. Though the government had focused on promoting Tajik by limiting the use of Russian, it has since made efforts to promote Russian in public schools. Reception Many of Sobir's poems have been set to music by Tajik composers, and are played on Tajik TV channels on an almost daily basis. His patriotic verses in We are of Siyovushe's Bloodline (), which traces the Tajik lineage to Zoroaster, and sees Siy√¢vash, Ismail Samani and Ferdowsi as its heroic predecessors, has become the de facto national anthem since it was set to music. Other popular poems set to music by renowned Tajik composers include To Build You the Second Time, Homeland (Dubora Sozamat Vatan), Why Don't You Come? (Charo Nameoi?), Alovparak (Jumping Over Fire), Mother (Modar), Clothed Cherries (Olichai Lattador), and Mother Tongue (Zaboni Modari). CDs of this music have been released, and his works continue to have popularity over his contemporaries. During the Soviet era, Sobir's patriotic and nationalistic poems were a source of much discussion and controversy, and the subsequent poems throughout his life have maintained that effect on the people and the government. His poems, which promoted the new Tajik identity, and his work in popularizing the old traditions of the Tajik people, like the celebration of Nowruz (Persian New Year), faced some resistance in the Soviet era. His anti- government poem at that time was cited as one reason for his arrest, in particular of \\"promoting social discord\\". His secularist views and criticism of religion continue to stir people in a Muslim-majority Tajikistan and also in Iran and Afghanistan, where Tajik language and culture are practised. The self-identified atheist is viewed by a some as a heretic and an infidel. A member of the Islamic State was arrested for planning Sobir's murder in 2016. Afghan Ambassador to Tajikistan Abdulgafur Orzu called Nowruz became a Worldwide Holiday, but Not a Happy One an insult to Afghans and Sobir an extremist. Sobir agreed to the former, stating that those of Kabul were either participants or bystanders to the brutal murder.http://www.dialog.tj/news/bozor-sobir-ya-uveren-chto-ekstremisty- ubivshie-farkhundu-est-nikto-inye-kak-tadzhiki-afganistana Sobir and the poem were labeled anti-Islamic. =Death threats= Although Sobir denied receiving direct personal death threats, the government authorities released a statement that a 26-year old Tajik national \\"admitted in court that had planned to murder the poet in order to gain the trust of an Islamic State commander\\", who had encouraged him to kill all those who had abandoned Islam. The man was sentenced to 13 years in prison. Return to Tajikistan The poet visited Tajikistan twice after his exile, in 2003 and in 2011. In 2013, President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon formally invited Sobir to return to Tajikistan. Sobir agreed and was met in Dushanbe Airport by government officials. His arrival and a meeting with the president at the Palace of Nations on 30 May 2013 were televised internationally by MIR24, the channel encompassing all former Soviet bloc countries. During the meeting, Rahmon said: \\"We have always remembered you and remember, that this is not the first time we had invite you to our Motherland.\\"Official Statement of President of Tajikistan.

In a televised announcement, Rahmon ordered the country's US and UN representatives to see that Sobir was visited and \\"to assist in ensuring his intensive care, comprehensive support and early return of the poet to his homeland.\\" Sobir died on 1 May 2018.

He held the rank of Major General in the Indonesian Army, and was the Ambassador of Indonesia to China between 2005 and 2009. Currently, he is the CEO of Susi Air. Born in Balikpapan, Sudrajat began his military career in 1971, upon graduation from the Indonesian Military Academy. He served in various positions, before retiring as a MG in 2004 and becoming an ambassador. Afterwards, he became the CEO of Susi Air replacing Susi Pudjiastuti. In 2018, he ran in West Java's gubernatorial election, but lost to Ridwan Kamil. Background and family Sudrajat was born in Balikpapan on 4 February 1949, moving to Bandung at the age of 6. After completing his first 12 years of education in Bandung, he would join the Indonesian Military Academy in 1967, after he graduated from a trade school. Later on in his career, he would study at Harvard University, taking a Masters in Public Administration course. Sudrajat is of Sundanese descent, with his father originating from Sumedang and his mother from Cianjur. He is married to Sally Salziah, and has two children. Career =Military= After graduating from the Indonesian Military Academy on 1971, he became a second lieutenant at the communications battalion of Kostrad. He then served as a technical officer at the Indonesian contingent for the United Nations Emergency Force in Egypt, before becoming the communications company commander of a Kostrad infantry brigade. He was then assigned to the Washington, D.C. Embassy as an aide to the defense attache, before becoming a secretary to the Panglima in 1983 and a general planning staff at TNI headquarters. After further diplomatic placements, he was promoted to brigadier general in 1997, became the deputy head of public affairs in 1998, and eventually head of public affairs in 1999 along with a promotion to major general. During the presidency of Abdurrahman Wahid, Sudrajat openly disputed with Wahid on the interpretation of the Indonesian Constitution about the president being having authority over all military branches, with Sudrajat stating that the Constitution does not imply the President of Indonesia being the highest commander of the Indonesian National Armed Forces. He was then removed from his post as head of the military's public affairs department. He also opposed to a military district reorganization proposal in 1999, going against then-Panglima Widodo Adi Sutjipto. Following his removal from public affairs, he became a special staff to the Panglima on economics. Eventually, he became the director-general of defense strategy at the Ministry of Defense in 2003. He retired on 11 November 2004, holding the rank of Major General while still working at the ministry. Contemporary major general Agus Wirahadikusumah was quoted as saying that \\"[Sudrajat] did not understand signals of professionality in the army.\\" =Diplomatic= During his time in the military, he was assigned to the Indonesian Embassy in the United Kingdom as a defense attache on 1994. In 1997, he would also be assigned to the same post in the Washington, D.C. Embassy. On 11 November 2005, Sudrajat was appointed by President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono as the Ambassador of Indonesia to the People's Republic of China and Mongolia. He was attacked by some legislators from the People's Representative Council in 2006, when he was not present during the legislators' visit. While he was ambassador, he aided the investigation into a corruption case by his predecessor, which eventually led to a conviction. His tenure as ambassador ended on 27 November 2009. Following his time as ambassador, he would serve as the chairman of the Indonesia-China Economic, Social and Cultural Cooperation Foundation. =Susi Air= Susi Pudjiastuti, the founder and CEO of Susi Air, was appointed as Minister of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries by Joko Widodo in 2014. She then decided to resign as CEO, and appointed Sudrajat to replace her. Before this appointment, Sudrajat had been the president commissioner of the company since 2004, with the company initially starting from Sudrajat's house in Kebayoran Baru. =Politics= In 2011, he was one of the founders of Nasdem in West Java, when it was still a mass organization. Not long after, however, he resigned when Nasdem registered to become a political party, citing that one of Nasdem's initial vision was to become a mass organization and not a political party. His departure was followed by a mass resignation of the central committee of Nasdem in the province. Sudrajat ran for governorship of West Java in the 2018 gubernatorial election with the backing of three parties - Gerindra, PKS and PAN - and Bekasi Vice Mayor Ahmad Syaikhu as his running mate. During the campaigning period, he openly declared that his victory would mean a presidential change in the 2019 presidential election, and endorsed the #2019GantiPresiden movement. While forecast to win just around 8% of the votes in surveys preceding the election, Sudrajat ended up winning 28.74% of the votes (6,317,465), placing second behind Bandung mayor Ridwan Kamil (with Gerindra claiming that their internal survey placed Sudrajat in the first place). Close to Kamil's swearing in, his campaign team demanded the ceremony be cancelled due to administrative errors conducted. He was part of Prabowo Subianto's 2014 presidential campaign team, as one of its spokespersons. He retained that position in the 2019 campaign team.

Eastern Han ceramic unearthed at Chengdu, China. The Weak River also known as the Weak Water or Ruoshui () is an important feature in the mythical geography of Chinese literature, including novels and poetry over a course of over two millennia from the Warring States to early Han dynasty era poetry of the Chuci onward. The Weak River is one of the mythological rivers flowing near Kunlun, home of a Western Paradise. The Weak River flowed with \\"water\\" so lacking in specific gravity that even a feather would not float, thus being a protective barrier against the unworthy, who otherwise would profane the paradise on Kunlun, and perhaps even climb up to Heaven and disturb the deities and other inhabitants residing there. In the novel Journey to the West, the Weak Water River forms one of the obstacles the fictional version of the monk Xuanzang, the magic monkey Sun Wukong, and companions must cross over on their mission to fetch the Buddhist scriptures from India and return them to Tang China. Mythical geography Chinese mythology and imagination developed an extensive collection of ideas. =Weak Water River= The Weak River, or Weak Water, was so-called because nothing could float in it (Hawkes, 1985 (2011): 337). =Nearby features= Various mythological geography is associated with the Weak River, including one or more of the eight mountain pillars, especially the (mythological) Kunlun Mountain, the Red River, intervening terrain, such as the Moving Sands. Jade Mountain was also in the vicinity. (Yang 2005: 160-162). Ideas As the mythology of the Weak River and related mythical geography developed, it was influenced by ideas from the cosmology of India related to Mount Sumeru as an axis mundi, together with related cosmological features, such as rivers (Christie 1968:74). Also India was the goal of the Buddhist priest Xuanzang and his companions in the Journey to the West. =Literature and poetry= Literature The companions in one episode of Journey to the Weet. Mural in the Long Corridor, a covered walkway in the Summer Palace in Beijing, China. In the novel Journey to the West the Weak Water river forms one of the barriers on the way, one of the many difficult areas which the Xuanzang the Monk, Sun Wukong the Monkey, and their companions must cross over. Poetry The Weak Water River is an allusion in various Chinese Classical poems, the early Chuci anthology included. Pulled through the sky by a team of dragons, Qu Yuan soars above all obstacle rivers and hostile terrain at will during his spirit journey as described in his poem \\"Li Sao\\". The Li Sao helped set the tone for other poems of the Chuci, which also allude to this type of mythical geography. Although Qu Yuan is largely credited for the Chuci material, other authors are also known. \\"Alas That My Lot Was Not Cast\\" was written by Zhuang Ji also known as Yan Ji in the second century BCE (Hawkes (1985 [2011]): 262-263). Also known as \\"Ai shi ming\\" this poem is an example of the use of the Weak Water River as an image, where in lines 15-22 the poet laments that he is not only irremediably separated from his lord due to earthly rivers which are wide and bridgeless, but that his desire to visit the Hanging Garden of Kunlun is not possible due to his inability to pass the barrier of the \\"rushing Weak Water\\" (Hawkes translation (1985 [2011]): 264, line 21). Apparently he was less worthy than Qu Yuan and chose to write a poem lamenting this. =Western Paradise= Queen of the West in her paradise. Eastern Han ceramic tomb tile. Unearthed at Chengdu, China. The Weak River was often seen as a protective barrier against the profane and unworthy, protecting a Western Paradise. Often this Paradise was presided over by Xiwangmu, the Queen Mother of Meng Hao in the West, in later accounts was relocated to a palace protected by golden ramparts, within which immortals (xian) feasted on bear paws, monkey lips, and the livers of dragons, served at the edge of the Lake of Gems. Every 6000 years the peaches which conferred immortality upon those who ate them would be served (except the time when they were purloined by Monkey King) (Christie 1968: 78-79). However, as a barrier The Weak Water River would be crossed over by those who were worthy, such as immortals (xian), humans who had metamorphosed into superhuman form, or those well on the Way to immortality. The xian were often seen as guests who visited by means of flying on the back of a magical crane or dragon. The Wu or shamans were people that practiced divination, prayer, sacrifice, rainmaking, and healing: they in specialized traveling by spirit flight, induced through the usual shamanic means. Real Ruo Shui Taklimakan Desert, with real Ruo Shui visible as the faint green trace to the right of the satellite image. There is a real, geographical Ruo Sui ( also Etsin Gol or Ruo He or Ejin River). This Ruoshui (\\"Weak River\\") is not identical with the mythological Weak River. Are there historical points of tangency? What is the relationship between the two? One major difference between the modern river and the mythological river is that the modern river of that name was named for its seasonal weak flow in its lower reaches: the mythological Weak River was named for the inability of the liquid substance constituting it to float any objects. Another difference is that the geographical river rises as the Heishui (, black water) on the north slopes of the Qilian Mountains, a major river system of northern China, then flowing approximately from its headwaters on the northern Gansu side of the Qilian Mountains, on a spur of the Kunlun range, north-northeast into the endorheic Ejin Basin in the Gobi Desert, forming one of the largest inland deltas or alluvial fans in the world, its drainage basin covering about in Gansu and Inner Mongolia: on the other hand, the mythological Ruoshui River circles Kunlun and is the scene for all sorts of activities by deities, immortal, would-be immortals, and so on, and generally exists in an alternate reality of culture. However, both Ruo Shui rivers are directionally located in a somewhat northern and western way.

The star is too faint to be seen with the naked eye, having an apparent visual magnitude of 8.97. The distance to HD 3167 can be determined from its annual parallax shift of as measured by the Gaia space observatory, yielding a range of 154 light years. It has a relatively high proper motion, traversing the celestial sphere at the rate of per year. Since it was first photographed during the Palomar observatory sky survey in 1953, it had moved over by 2017. The star is moving away from the Earth with an average heliocentric radial velocity of +19.5 km/s. This is an ordinary K-type main-sequence star with a stellar classification of K0 V and no significant variability. The star has 86% of the mass of the Sun and 86% of the Sun's radius. This gives it a bulk density of . It is a chromospherically inactive star and is radiating 56% of the Sun's luminosity from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 5,261 K. The spin of the star displays a relatively low projected rotational velocity of around 1.7 km/s. It has a near solar metallicity ‚Äì a term astronomers use for the proportion of elements other than hydrogen and helium in a stellar atmosphere. Planetary system In 2016, data collected during the extended K2 mission of the Kepler space telescope was used to identify two transiting exoplanet candidates orbiting this star, designated HD 3167 b and HD 3167 c. This makes it one of the closest and brightest such multi-transiting stars known. The lack of chromospheric activity makes it ideal for the precise radial velocity (RV) measurements needed to estimate the masses of its planets. Follow-up RV observations showed additional perturbation signals beyond the two planets already identified. This led to the discovery in 2017 of a third, non- transiting planet, designated HD 3167 d. The close-orbiting body HD 3167 b has a mass of and radius . It most likely has had its atmosphere stripped away by the host star, leaving a rocky planet with about 15% iron by mass. HD 3167 b is orbiting HD 3167 with a period of , an orbital inclination of 83.4¬∞, and an assumed orbital eccentricity of zero ‚Äì a circular orbit. The semimajor axis of its orbit is , or just four times the star's radius. The second planet, HD 3167 c, has an orbital period of 29.8454 days and an eccentricity of less than 0.267. The semimajor axis is . It has and , giving it a low bulk density of . This suggests either a mini-Neptune with a gaseous envelope consisting mainly of hydrogen and helium, or a planet consisting of mostly water. The incident flux from the host star is around 16 times the amount the Earth receives from the Sun, and it is less susceptible to atmospheric stripping than HD 3167 b. The proximity of the host star to the Earth makes this planet a particularly suitable target for spectroscopic observation of the atmosphere. The orbital inclination of HD 3167 d is inclined at least 1.3¬∞ away from the orbital planes of the other two exoplanets. Its orbit is expected to remain stable for periods longer than 100 million years only if this inclination is less than 40¬∞. It has an orbital period of , placing it in between the other two orbits, and shows a minimum mass of . The true mass is most likely less than Neptune.

(Powerhouse Museum Collection) The Lithgow Blast Furnace is a heritage-listed former blast furnace and now park and visitor attraction at Inch Street, Lithgow, City of Lithgow, New South Wales, Australia. It was built from 1906 to 1907 by William Sandford Limited. It is also known as Eskbank Ironworks Blast Furnace site; Industrial Archaeological Site. The property is owned by Lithgow City Council. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  =1875 to 1900= Lithgow's association with its iron and steel works was another of this city's big manufacturing eras. Its iron and steel works commenced in October 1875 when the first iron smelting took place. Ore had been discovered by Dan Williams on Eskbank land which was then owned by Enoch Hughes, who had previously worked at the Fitzroy Iron Works at Mittagong. The foundry was erected nearby after Hughes convinced James Rutherford, of Cobb & Co. fame, from Bathurst to become involved. The other principal shareholders were the NSW Minister for Public Works, the Hon. John Sutherland and Dan WIlliams, an engineer from Canada who worked on the Lithgow Zig Zag railway project. The Lithgow Valley Iron Works (later the Eskbank Ironworks) then consisted of a blast furnace, foundry and two bar rolling mills with the necessary fitting and smiths' shops. About of pig iron was made initially from local ores, which was converted into rails and bars. Work was carried on intermittently, until it was decided to pull down the blast furnace and convert the castings into merchant iron.McRae, 2016, 3 In May 1880 in the Lithgow Report it stated that the Eskbank Ironworks were working at the rate of four miles of rails per week. The new rails stood the test of , the required standard being . The blast furnace was in full swing and per week of iron was anticipated. The original blast furnace at the Eskbank Ironworks closed in 1882, and it is reported that James Rutherford - to avoid the temptation to ever reopen it - in the dead of night, used two dray-loads of blasting powder to blow it up. After the blast furnace closed down, the rolling mills were used to re-roll old iron rails into merchant bars. In 1886, William Sandford, leased the rolling mills at the Eskbank Ironworks to roll rails. Sandford bought the ironworks in 1894. The Lithgow Blast Furnace was erected by William Sandford in 1906-1907, a short distance from the Eskbank Colliery which he had purchased outright in 1892. The construction of this later furnace over away from the Colliery was widely criticised, but its proximity to the railway and its size, providing scope for expansion, made it an understandable choice. It was constructed for the sole purpose of smelting iron from ore. It is a popular misconception that the site was also an ironworks. Indeed the Eskbank Colliery furnace, which operated between 1875 and 1882, is often confused with Sandford's later furnace.Cremin and Jack 1986: 8-35 After a layoff the mills at the Eskbank Ironworks were restarted on 30 July 1894. The old system had been discarded and the mills had now commenced on a partially co-operative principle, which it was expected would cheapen production and give better results generally. During the cessation of work the plant was added to and improved, in this way the sheet mill now starts equipped to produce nearly double its former product. An order for of spike iron, to be supplied at the rate of weekly, had been obtained from the Railway Commissioners. The company soon found themselves with an overdraft of about A‚Ç§60,000 and had decided on closing the works when Sandford took them on lease in 1885. He added mill after mill, with powerful shears, furnaces, boilers and rollers, so that now the mills were fully equipped for the work they had to do. Output for all classes of finished iron and steel for the three years ending 31 December 1901 averaged over per annum. It did not cover more than a small percentage of what was imported into Sydney.SLNSW). Verification needed, this looks more like the Colliery site, just up the valley ?. The works and sidings occupied a space of about , situated between the Main Western Railway Line and Farmer's Creek, being connected with the main line at Eskbank Station, with sidings all round the works. Sand for the works was obtained from Farmer's Creek, close by, and loam for the foundry from a paddock adjoining the works. Within the ironworks' fence is a colliery adit, where the coal was drawn out by an engine, and the same skips drawn around the works, so that coal was only handled once, into the skips; and the same skips were tipped into the furnace bins in the ironworks. Coal was thus used fresh from the colliery, and bore comparison in heating qualities with most of the English coals. On the siding to the works was situated the steam sawmills, where timber of any ordinary size could be cut and delivered to the works. To heat the iron for the mill, four large furnaces were used, each capable of heating from of iron per shift. Attached were large horizontal boilers for raising steam by the waste-head from the furnaces. There was a great deal of equipment on site including immense Cornish boilers, weighing for raising steam by the waste heat from the furnaces. There was a steam hammer, massive shears for cutting up rails into lengths, a large gantry, horizontal condensing engine and giant fly-wheels with diameters, weighing . The No. 2 Sheet Mill had a flywheel. In the fitting shops were lathes, screwing, drilling and punching machines, nut and bolt machines, and a complete spike-making machine, where spikes for the Railway Construction Department had been made the previous three years. The foundry department had two large travelling cranes, a large and small cupola and an air furnace. There was also a large Siemens melting furnace, for dealing with scrap, scrap and pig iron. It was complete with a steam travelling crane capable of lifting cast iron moulds and large wrought iron ladles. Cement used in the works was mostly made at the Cullen Bullen Company's lime and cement works, about from Lithgow There was another mill principally for rolling sheets for galvanising and corrugating sheets up to long and 27 gauge. =Since 1901= On 24 April 1901 Sandford organised a gala dinner to announce that he and his son Esk had successfully tapped the first viable quantities of steel produced in Australia at the Eskbank Ironworks. He had been working Eskbank since the 1880s, and although tapping steel was a triumph, he was nearly exhausted by it. Sandford felt iron and steel were basic commodities and needed to be boosted, and tried every which way to protect and support his venture. While Lithgow's coal miners were free traders, iron workers and their bosses were protectionists, so, to advance his cause, Sandford ran as a protectionist against Joseph Cook in the 1901 federal parliamentary election. He then tried to convince the NSW government to take over the works. Finally, when a tender for steel and iron supply became available he bribed three parliamentarians, including WIlliam Holman, to win the contract. Part of that deal included the construction of a blast furnace, to enable production of pig iron for steel. Sandford complied. 344x344px The Blast Furnace was \\"blown in\\" and officially opened by the premier of New South Wales, on 13 May 1907. It was Sandford's proudest moment and won him the title of the father of the Australian steel industry. His relations with workers were relatively harmonious and beneficent and the Eskbank estate was, to him, a satisfyingly noisy and smoky place. However behind the scenes, Sandford was financially and mentally strained. He could not raise capital but was unwilling to cede his management to external investors such as John Lysaght Ltd., and although Charles Hoskins and his brother George looked at the plant, they pulled out when they saw the state of the books. The Commercial Banking Company of Sydney, which had underwritten the operation, foreclosed on the ironworks on 9 December 1907, although it kept the Blast Furnace running. William Sandford Limited could not fulfil its contract to supply the government with iron and steel. With 700 out of work, the Premier invited the Hoskins brothers to take over the Lithgow iron and steelworks. They took over Sandford's overdraft of ¬£138,000, paying ¬£14,000 to shareholders in the form of 4 per cent bonds and paying ¬£50,000 to Sandford himself. Although the complicated deal ensured Sandford's debts were paid and he received enough money to guarantee his financial security, he was devastated and felt deceived by Charles Hoskins. His parting with the Lithgow community was sad for him, his wife Caroline, the workers and their community.McKillop, 2006, online at Lithgow.com/historyavenue/1901_steel.htmlBlast Furnaces at Lithgow. Because there are two furnaces shown, this photograph was taken, between 1913 and 1928, during the period the Hoskins owned the plant.In 1908 the company was purchased by Hoskins Bros, owners of the premier manufacturer of iron pipes in Australia. They made few initial alterations to the Blast Furnace, although the ironworks underwent substantial changes. The Hoskins also succeeded in having Sandford's government contract transferred to themselves and extended until the end of 1916. Their success prompted them to build 80 coke ovens and a second blast furnace at the eastern end of the site in 1913. The second furnace was a near replica of Sandford's original construction, although slightly larger. Fifteen coke ovens were added shortly afterwards to cope with the extra fuel requirements. The Hoskins were highly active in the development of the ironworking industry and staunchly opposed the growth of unionism. The Hoskins were clear-sighted about the technological problems of the steel and ironworks, and the labour issues, and had considerable business acumen, but Charles Hoskins was impatient and imperious and provoked industrial unrest as soon as he set foot in Lithgow in 1908. He was also a protectionist, and although his negotiations with government over tariffs were never entirely successful, he did manage to get the Eskbank enterprise onto a solid footing before the surge in production caused by World War I. The outbreak of WWI saw considerable expansion in operations, although Lithgow's monopoly on iron smelting was about to be seriously challenged by BHP, who opened their Newcastle plant in 1915. However, the opening of a Small Arms factory in Lithgow ensured that the Hoskins' works flourished. A great deal of their profit was ploughed back into the expansion of capacity at the steelworks. In 1923 a fifth blowing engine was added to the original furnace. At , it was the largest in Australia. In the mid 1920s, the decision was taken to move operations to Port Kembla, where the natural resource and transport network were more attractive. The Lithgow site was abandoned in 1928, although the last employees were dismissed in 1932. The site was bought by the Lithgow City Council and was opened to the public as The Lithgow Blast Furnace Park in 1988.  Description  The site is on the south-western edge of the former Coal Stage Hill, a natural ridge which has been much modified by the construction and operation of the furnace and plant. It is roughly wedge shaped, with its base line and southern boundary on the line of the Great Western railway line, which runs south-west north-east. The western boundary is formed by the back of Inch Street, while the northern boundary is an artificial line west-east. The site is on three levels: *The top level, and above, houses the plant itself. This occupies a strip approximately long and wide. *The middle level, at , is the area of the rail embankment and rail line to the former Steelworks site. It is connected to the top level on its eastern side by an almost imperceptible gradient. *The bottom level is the area between the rear of Inch Street and the upper level. It forms the natural base of Coal Stage Hill. This area has slag dumps in it. Archaeological remains of the three phases of occupation are as follows: *Phase 1: walls of the Davey blower house; pump house foundations; footings for the first Parsons turbo- blower; the well outside the pumphouse; the floor of the boiler house; the brick revetment wall of the furnaces and stoves area; the foundations of No. 1 furnace and its four stoves; the base of the brick chimney stack; iron bottom- plates for three of the four stoves; the pig bins; the brick walls of the material bunkers; the pit for the truck drop. *Phase 2: The brick revetment wall of the furnaces and stoves area; the foundations of No. 2 furnace and its four stoves; the brick base for the chimney stack; the footings for the second Parsons turbo-blower; the rail embankment in the south-west corner; the rail bridge over Inch Street; the bolts for the boiler stacks. *Phase 3: footings for the third Parsons turbo-blower; footings for the Thompson engine; other extensions to the engine house; footings of the pig-breaking machinery; footings for its associated gantries.Cremin and Jack 1986: 36-43 *Has an Engineers Australia Historic Engineering Marker. *Thompson blowing engine: An air blowing engine which produced of air per minute at 25psi. The engine weighed 400 tonnes and was installed in 1923. *Parsons Turbines: Three air blowing engines each installed as the blast furnace increased in size. They varied in capability from per minute. *Davy engine house: This building housed the Davy air blower which produced of air per minute. The blower was installed in 1906 and weighed . *Boiler house: This building housed ten Babcock and Wilcox boilers that were fired by waste gases from the blast furnaces. *Material storage bins: This area has a capacity to store of iron ore, limestone and coke. *Travelling crane walls: the electricity driven crane ran along these walls maintaining the raw material stockpiles. *Blast Furnace No. 1: Built in 1907. It was high and in diameter. *Blast Furnace No. 2: Built in 1913. It was almost identical to the No. 1 just slightly bigger dimensions. *Cowper Stoves: These stoves which were filled with firebricks were used to pre-heat the air from the blowing engines before it went to the blast furnaces. *Rail siding No. 2: Built in 1913 to service Blast Furnace No. 2 carrying molted slag to the dump and liquid iron to the steelworks. *Pig Beds: The Pig Beds were sand cast moulds in which the molten iron that was tapped from the furnace was run into. *Gantry supports: These gantry support blocks held the crane that lifted the pig iron combs over to the pig breaker. The gantry crane was erected in 1918. *Rail siding No. 1: Constructed in 1907, but very much altered as the site expanded. After 1913 a ladle was shunted into here for taking molten iron to the steelworks. *Water return channel: Returned the cooling water from the furnace to the cooling pond. *Cooling pond: The cooling pond was constructed in 1907 and was used as a reservoir for water for use in the boilers and cooling the blast furnace sprays. *Ferrant engine house: constructed in 1914 to house a steam electric power generating set. *Air intake tunnel: construction in 1923 the air intake tunnel for the parsons turbine blowers and Thompson Blowing engine. It runs under the foundations and connects to each turbine house. = Condition = The archaeological potential is high. = Modifications and dates = Construction was in three phases: *Phase 1: No. 1 blast furnace and plant built by William Sandford 1906-7.  artificial level for the furnaces cut (1906) *Phase 2: Extensions made to the 1907 plant and construction of No. 2 blast furnace by G. and C. Hoskins Ltd., 1908-13.  the construction of rail sidings to connect the furnaces with coke ovens (1907 and 1910-1911).  the construction of the Hoskins coke ovens at the eastern end of the hill (1910-1912).  the excavation of the water reservoir, known as Lake Pillans (1911).  the construction of the railway line to the Hoskins' Steelworks (1911). *Phase 3: Improvements to the plant by G. and C. Hoskins Ltd., 1914-1919 and Hoskins Iron and Steel, 1920-1925.Cremin and Jack 1986: 36-37  Heritage listing  As at 8 April 2009, The layout of the Blast Furnace site represents the organic and uninterrupted growth of a workplace which is now the only relic of one of Australia's major industries. The Blast Furnace was the sole producer of iron in Australia for the first seven years of its life. The remains are in themselves a resource for studying technical changes in ironmaking.Cremin and Jack 1986: 6 Lithgow Blast Furnace was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. *The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Built in 1906-7, the Blast Furnace was the sole producer of iron in Australia for the first seven years of its life. It remained a major producer for the next thirteen, until its closure in 1928. It reflects the growth of the Australian iron and steel industry and the confidence of the emerging nation. These industries were also of enormous importance to New South Wales and Lithgow in particular.Cremin and Jack 1986: 5 *The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Blast Furnace has aesthetic value in its superb siting clear of the town, its fine views and its functional architecture. It also has a romantic appeal and has been photographed often. The slag dumps which border the western part of the site powerfully evoke the elemental forces at work in the blast furnace. *The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The men who built the furnace and worked there under difficult conditions, displayed endurance, solidarity, skill and pride in their work which deserves to be remembered. It is a symbol for the struggle for better conditions. There is still a \\"spirit of Lithgow\\" of which the site is a potent expression. *The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The remains represent an organic growth and refinement of a major industrial plant and are in themselves a resource for studying technical change in ironmaking.

As a branchless direct bank, it offers checking accounts, payment cards and securities trading. Company History On 9 August 1968, the W√ºstenrot Bank AG for Housing was registered in the commercial register at the district court Ludwigsburg. The main task of the bank at that time was to support the customers of the Bausparkasse in financing their real estate projects. Later, the entire non-collective deposit business was taken over by the Bausparkasse. In 1985, the construction of the first 10 bank branches began. In 1988 there were already 34 branches with 300 employees on the ground, and the range was expanded to include all forms of money and asset formation, current account payments, personal loans and securities transactions. The bank's name was also shortened to W√ºstenrot Bank AG. However, the field service - especially the W√ºstenrot Bausparkasse - saw the branches increasingly as competitors. The bank's sales did not perform as expected and lacked the necessary returns. In 1990, a reorganization took place centralizing all administrative tasks in the central administration and new, cheaper locations for the remaining branches were sought after. At the end of 2002 the last branch was dissolved. In 2005, the W√ºstenrot Bank AG merged with W√ºstenrot Hypothekenbank to form W√ºstenrot Bank AG Pfandbriefbank. It became one of the first universal banks with mortgage bond license under the new law. On June 1, 2017, the parent company W√ºstenrot & W√ºrttembergische AG announced that a sale of the bank would be considered. At the end of March 2018, the sale was made to Bremer Kreditbank. Affiliation Client funds are secured by the Deposit Guarantee Fund of the Federal Association of German Banks and Entsch√§digungseinrichtung deutscher Banken. Since 2017, online banking has been offered in cooperation with GAD, which was previously an in-house development. Furthermore, the W√ºstenrot ATMs are connected to CashPool.

It was designed by New South Wales Government Railways and built from 1885 to 1925 by NSW Government Railways. The property is owned by RailCorp, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 30 August 2013.  History  The line opened in 1869 but there was no station for Lithgow until 1877. Lithgow Coal Stage Box is the third built in this locality and was constructed in 1925 to cater for the expanded marshalling yards and locomotive depot which replaced the original Eskbank locomotive depot. It was a standard design of the period. The box takes its name from the 1888 unique on-line overhead coaling bunker, now demolished, but which existed when the box was built and was situated immediately westwards. It controlled access to and from the locomotive depot, local colliery branch lines as well as locomotives using the 1888 on-line overhead coaling bunker. Initially, it contained 64 mechanical levers but now many of those are not in use. In 1957 with electrification of the Lithgow Yard its signalling system was adapted for changing technology including electric light signalling. The original timber steps have been replaced by metal steps.  Description  The complex comprises a type 1, timber elevated coal stage signal box, erected in 1925. Externally, the Signal Box is a large rectangular elevated timber framed traditional signal box of a standard design with a hipped corrugated iron roof, lapped timber weatherboard wall cladding and timber framed sliding multi-pane sash windows. At the east end there is a recent steel framed staircase with a landing above the ground floor entry door. Internally, the signal control room's walls are clad with flat beaded edge boards with flat asbestos cement panels sheeting to the ceiling. The signal and point control level mechanism remains of 64 levers while 41 still operating levers have been sympathetically adapted to operate the power light signals, points and track diagram. Also retained is an older model of telephone system, bells and other signal tools. The ground floor has exposed timber frame and ceiling/floor with the chains and rods of the interlocking lever mechanism. The space is also used for storage purposes. = Condition = As at 10 December 2009, the condition of the building and equipment is good. The Signal Box retains a high level of intactness, and its integrity is excellent due to its operational status. = Modifications and dates = *1957: Signal system adapted for electric light signals.  Heritage listing  As at 2 December 2008, the Lithgow Coal Stage Signal Box is significant as a large and imposing elevated timber signal box that has remained in continuous operation since 1925. The signal box retains most of its original equipment and is an excellent example of a traditional early 1900s elevated timber railway signal box, sympathetically adapted to operate electric light signals and power activated points mechanisms. It is now one of the largest signal boxes remaining from a relatively small sub-group of standard railway building types. Located close to Eskbank railway station, the signal box is an important part of the larger historic Lithgow railway corridor controlling access to and from Eskbank locomotive depot, local colliery branch lines as well as locomotives using the nearby 1888 on-line overhead coaling bunker. As such, the signal box has strong associations with the surrounding industrial history of Lithgow, and remains as an important element in the evolution of railway operations in the area. Lithgow Coal Stage Signal Box was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 30 August 2013 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Lithgow Coal Stage Signal Box is of historical significance as one of the largest and most intact traditional timber signal boxes remaining in the State and continues in operating condition dating from 1925. It is part of the larger Lithgow railway historic precinct and marks an important phase in the evolution of railway operations in the city. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The Coal Stage signal box has strong associations with the earlier coaling operations as well as the branch colliery and other industrial lines in particular the State Mine and Power Station line. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Coal Stage Signal Box is of aesthetic significance as an excellent and intact example of the traditional larger timber elevated signal box. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Signal Box has a high level of both technical and research potential for its ability to demonstrate characteristics and design requirements of standard elevated timber boxes of the 1920s as well as changing technology in the signalling system. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Coal Stage Signal Box is relatively rare as an operating box of this vintage. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The Signal Box is a representative example of traditional timber elevated signal boxes of its design.

He is best remembered as a character in the poetry of Dante Alighieri and Giovanni Boccaccio. Biography Conrad Malaspina was born sometime in the first two decades of the 13th century. Natural son of Frederic I, Marquess of Villafranca in Lunigiana and of Virgoletta, he was raised by his grandfather Conrad the old, the forefather of the Spino Secco branch of the Malaspina, lords of Lunigiana since the 11th century. =Wedding= The first documents attributed to him date back to 1234 and are about his wedding, which took place two years before to a woman named Urica, the biological daughter of Marianus II of Torres, a judge from Sardinia. Other documents from 1281 to 1305 talk about a certain Orietta as Conrad's wife, who may be tied to the Genoese families of the Zanche or the Spinola, but it is also possible that it is the same woman, with her name translated from the Sardinian dialect. He didn't have any legitimate heirs, but there was an illegitimate son nicknamed Figliastro (Stepson), and Boccaccio talks about a daughter called Spina. It is plausible, however, that she was just invented for the tale.She is present in the sixth novella of the second day, like her father, however, in the Decameron by Vittore Branca, published by Mondadori, footnote 45 of the novella 2;6 says: \\"Personaggio probabilmente immaginario, il cui nome fu naturalmente suggerito dal cognome\\"-\\"Probably an invented character, whose name was naturally suggested by the surname\\" If she existed, she would have been born around 1264. =Wars and management of the family's wealth= The wedding between Conrad and the daughter of the judge of Torres brought an expansion of the Malaspina family interests also in Sardinia; however, in 1266 the wealth acquired there was divided into three parts between Conrad and his uncles Moroello and Manfredi because Conrad didn't have a legitimate male heir. In 1278, on the initiative of the uncle Moroello, the Malaspina occupied the town of Chiavari causing a war with Genoa to which Conrad only participated marginally, to the point that he was absent for the peace oath, being in his overseas lands of Sardinia. The management of the territory in the following years proved fruitful for the bonds with Genoese families that were strengthened by weddings and both political and financial joint ventures. The collaboration with the Genoese families was linked to the war between Genoa and Pisa. The Malaspina family supported Genoa's faction by funding the expeditions (with maneuvers like the acquisition by Conrad of the localities of Casteldoria and the curator√¨a (judgedom) of Anglona from Brancaleone Doria, for 9,300 lire, that were immediately handed back) and militarily by participating on the first line in the expedition that culminated in the battle of Meloria (1284) and the Pisan defeat. Concerning the heirloom of his grandfather in 1266 the possessions in Lunigiana and on the Apennines were divided amongst the heirs, i.e., Conrad and his two brothers Tommaso and Opizzino and his three uncles Manfredi, Alberto, and Moroello. (Majorat was not yet enforced) Conrad and his brothers earned the Lunigianese settlements with Villafranca as the most important of them and other assets in Val Trebbia and Val Staffora (in the Oltrep√≤ Pavese), plus the Sardinian belongings. In 1281 there was yet another division of the Spino Secco possessions, most likely due to conflicts between the Malaspina and the bishop of Luni. Also this time Conrad's contribution seems minimal. The last information about Conrad is his testament, written in September 1294 in Mulazzo, in which he recognized his brothers Tommaso and Opizzino as universal heirs. Because there is no trace of him afterward, it is believed that he died later the same year. Conrad in Literature Conrad distinguished himself in the Spino Secco branch because of vast interest in traditions and conscience of the history and standing of the family.Salvatore S. Nigro in his commentary on the eighth canto, p.135 of the Purgatorio by Umberto Bosco e Giovanni Reggio, writes:\\"La menzione dell'antico non √® certo fatta per chiarire l'omonimia, ma per segnare una linea genealogica a cui egli tiene sopra ogni cosa\\" translated: \\"the mention of the antico was obviously not aimed at clearing the doubt of the omonimy, rather to define a genealogical line he (Conrad) held dear over everything else.\\" His figure has become that of the virtuous noble that represents the courteous ideals of chivalry. It has inspired two of the major authors of the fourteenth century: Dante Alighieri and Boccaccio. Dante's encounter of Conrad Dante, in the eighth canto of Purgatory, presents his encounter with Conrad in the Valley of Rulers where he stands out because of his values of love and family. He starts with a captatio benevolentiae, wishing that Dante will have the strength to reach the \\"Sommo Smalto\\", the Empyream, using a \\"literary and graceful language\\" that shows the \\"moral and material decorum\\" of the character.Synthesis of Bianca Garavelli's comment on the verses 112 to 114 of the eighth canto of purgatory, page 121 of \\"La Commedia-Purgatorio\\" by Bianca Garavelli, supervised by Maria Corti. He then presents himself by stating his name and surname, a rare happening in the Divine Comedy and immediately completes the identification by including his parentage to another well-known member of the family. He is not boasting, but talking with dignity and pride. He concludes by saying that his love for his family is why he has to wait in the Ante-Purgatorysynthesis of Bianca Garavelli's comment on the verses 118 to 120 of the eighth canto of purgatory, page 121 of \\"La Commedia-Purgatorio\\" by Bianca Garavelli, supervised by Maria Corti. =Conrad's presentation, original version= \\"Se la lucerna che ti mena in alto truovi nel tuo arbitrio tanta cera quant'√® mestiere infino al sommo smalto\\", cominci√≤ ella, \\"se novella vera di Val di Magra o di parte vicina sai, dillo a me, che gi√† grande l√† era. Fui chiamato Currado Malaspina; non son l'antico, ma di lui discesi; a' miei portai l'amor che qui raffina\\". Divina Commedia Purgatorio Canto 8 vv.112-120 =Conrad's presentation, translated= \\"So may the lantern leading thee above, find in thy will the wax that is required for one to reach the enamelled green on high;\\" he thus began, \\"if thou of Val di Magra, or of its neighboring land, dost know true news, tell it to me, who once was mighty there. Corrado Malaspina I was called; I ‚Äôm not the elder, but from him descended; I bore my race the love which here is cleansed.\\" Divine Comedy Purgatorio canto 8 vv.112-120, Courtney Langdon 1921 translation Then starts Dante's famous homage to the family, whose hospitality is legendary not only in Italy but in Europe. It is a tribute to those who welcomed him when he was in exile, but also an example that is set for others to follow.Salvatore S. Nigro in his commentary on the eighth canto, p.135/136 of the Purgatorio by Umberto Bosco e Giovanni Reggio, also talks about him as a symbol of old values that Dante remembers with nostalgia as if they are the last family to practice them. =Boccaccio's magnanimous lord= Conrad appears in Boccacio's Decameron, in the sixth novella of the second day, the one dedicated to stories of people that after a great misfortune are able to turn the tables with the help of luck and end up in a better situation than at the beginning. In Boccaccio, he embodies the ideal of the generous lord and, just like in Dante his family is characterized by hospitality. In the end after finding out the true story of Giuffredi he helps him reunite with his mother, his father and his brother and lets him marry his daughter.

The bridge is located approximately from Central railway station. The bridge was designed by John Whitton as the Engineer-in-Chief for Railways and was built in 1869 by contractor, P. Higgins. It is also known as Lithgow (James St) Underbridge. The property is owned by RailCorp, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 30 August 2013.  History  The Main West Railway Line runs from Granville to Bourke and was completed in 1885. By 1900 certain sections of John Whitton's single track railway network were operating at or near saturation, these included the famous Zig Zag near Lithgow, the Main West from Emu Plains right through to Bathurst, the Main South from Picton as far as Harden and the Main North between Maitland and Muswellbrook. Also, the metropolitan railways were congested by the combination of suburban and freight traffic. The Line was duplicated through Lithgow to Bowenfels in 1891 and then onto Wallerawang in 1922. John Whitton chose to use stone arch construction when denied sufficient funds to use imported wrought iron girders. It is the second oldest railway arch bridge in New South Wales built for two tracks. The James Street railway bridge was built in 1869 as part of the Lithgow to Bathurst railway extension, which was completed in 1875. Economic constraints forced Whitton to build the others on this line for single track. They were progressively bypassed by double track brick arch bridges but the bridge at James Street continues its original function.  Description  Three span, double track, sandstone arch railway bridge with clear central span between solid stone piers and abutments, with a low stone parapet. The arches are half circles in elevation with sandstone imposts at the junction of the arches and piers. = Condition = As at 19 October 2009, the bridge is in moderate condition with the following defects: several cracks and erosion in the stone arches, and parapets out-of-line with missing mortar. The James St Underbridge is of high integrity, retaining its original fabric in a good condition. = Modifications and dates = Anchors in spandrel walls added. Concrete retaining wall adjacent.  Heritage listing  As at 9 October 2009, the James St Underbridge is significant as the second oldest stone arch railway bridge in New South Wales still in use. The bridge was designed by John Whitton, Engineer-in-Chief for the railways between 1856 and 1890, and is one of the only Whitton designed bridges remaining in use on the Main West Line. John Whitton has been described as the \\"Father of New South Wales Railways\\", responsible for the establishment of the basic framework of the NSW rail network. The bridge forms part of the larger historic Lithgow railway corridor, and exemplifies the style and technique used in construction of stone arch bridges, a form of construction which is relatively rare within the NSW rail network. Lithgow Underbridge was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 30 August 2013 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The James St Underbridge has historical significance as the second oldest stone arch railway bridge in New South Wales still in use, and as one of the only original Whitton-era bridges still in use along the Main West Line. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The James St Underbridge has associative significance as it was designed by John Whitton, Engineer-in-Chief for Railways between 1856 and 1890. When Whitton was denied funds to continue with bridge construction using the expensive, imported wrought iron girder bridges, he chose to use stone arch viaducts for his major bridge works. The James Street bridge is a typical example. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The James St Underbridge has aesthetic significance as it exemplifies the style and technique used in construction of stone arch bridges, in a form highly representative of railway construction. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The stone construction of James St Underbridge is a comparatively rare technique within the NSW rail network. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The James St Underbridge is representative of railway viaduct construction.

Behind her, in the shadows, is her husband, and on the right are two steles. The top one lists the details of their family story in Latin, proclaiming it as A Wonder of Nature.A Foul and Pestilent Congregation: Images of Freaks in Baroque Art, by Art historian Barry Wind, 1998 The full text on the top stele is: EN MAGNV[M] NATVRAE / MIRACVLVM / MAGDALENA VENTVRA EX- / OPPIDO ACVMVLI APVD / SAMNITES VVLGO, EL A-/ BRVZZO REGNI, NEAPOLI-/ TANI ANNVRVM 52 ET / QVOD INSOLENS EST CV[M] / ANNVM 37 AGERET COE- / PIT PUBESCERE EOQVE / BARBA DEMISSA AC PRO- / LIXA EST VI POTIVS As the second stele with inscription explains, the wonder lies not only in this unusual woman and her beard story, but also in her fertility and the work of the painter and the proud owner who commissioned it. The full text on the lower stele is: ALCIVIOS MAGISTRI BARBATI / ESSE VIDEATVR QVAM MV- / LIERIS QVAE TRES FILIOS / ANTE AMISERIT QVOS EX / VIRO SVO FELICI DE AMICI / QVEM ADESSE VIDES HA- / BVERAT.

MART. / ANNO MDCXXXI The painting was mentioned in various period diaries. All we know about Magdalena today is derived from these quotes and documents referring to the painting itself. The break in the text could be where the family's own story ends and the public story begins. The Duke of Alcal√° was moved to commission the painting based on rumors he heard about her. She probably either assisted in the family income or was sole breadwinner by not trimming her beard growth, an aspect implicitly emphasized by the length of her beard compared to the more fashionably trimmed beard of her husband. The painting was part of a gallery of unusual portraits of people with various characteristics that were popular in travelling acts of the period, such as dwarfism. In this case, the center of attention is drawn to hirsutism. Though unusual hair-growth is unrelated to strength, the simple act of standing while nursing was an unusual pose for 17th-century women, and echoes period accounts of strong African women nursing in unusual ways. In his 1602 account of the Gold Coast of Africa, Pieter de Marees mentions the women \\"who stand up after birth and go about their business, often taking to the streets just days afterwards\\". His book was the standard text on Africa and was translated in several languages before this painting was made. Either Ribera himself or his patron, the collector Fernando Af√°n de Ribera, duke of Alcal√° de los Gazules, would have seen and read the book. File:Johann Theodor de Bry - Vier vrouwen uit Guinea RP-P-BI-5251.jpg'Four Women of Guinea', 1602 illustration by Johann Theodor de Bry, with explanatory text by Pieter de Marees. Not only has Ribera emphasized her manliness by having her stand while nursing, he shows Magdalena's strength in her hands in the way she grips her child, and her height almost equal to that of her husband, as if hirsutism may also cause a growth spurt. The stele claims she was aged 52 and had only begun to show facial hair growth at age 37. She had at least two other children and was Italian from the nearby town of Abruzzi. The commission was a success for Ribera who was later commissioned to make a portrait of a club-footed boy, The Clubfoot, in 1642.

Location  ‚ÄúPrati di Caprara‚Äù (Meadows of Caprara) is a former military area of Bologna located near the city center, outside Porta San Felice, opposite to the Maggiore Hospital. The area develops between Via Emilia Ponente, the Ravone stream and the small canal Ghisiliera.  History  The noble family of Caprara probably donated Prati di Caprara to Bologna Municipality around the end of the eighteenth century; during Napoleon Bonaparte‚Äôs official visit to the city, on June 21‚Äì25, 1805Napoleon Bonaparte‚Äôs official visit to the city, on June 21-25, 1805 a military parade in his honor was staged at Prati di Caprara. After the unification of Italy in 1861, Prati di Caprara became a military area and was used as a ground for conducting military exercises, parades and horse competitions. The flat and clear nature of the area had always made Prati di Caprara the ideal site for horse racing organized by the Bolognese Horse Racing Society. The mixed military-equestrian use of the area was sealed in 1897 with the inauguration of a racecourse that replaced the inadequate one of the Montagnola park, in the city center. With the permission of the military authorities, in 1909 the area welcomed the soccer field of the newly founded Bologna Football Club.The picture of a Bologna Football Club match inside Prati di Caprara taken in 1910 is available on website of the Biblioteca Sala Borsa di Bologna Prati di Caprara hosted an aviation event in 1910, and on September 24, 1913, the flight of Francesco Baracca landed here from Taliedo (Milan). A few days later, on October 1, 1913, the parade ground of Prati di Caprara became the airport for the aircraft and the airships of the army. When the Bologna Airport was relocated to Borgo Panigale, in 1931, the airfield of Prati di Caprara became playground for the paramilitary exercises of \\"Fascist Saturdays\\".The main references to the Prati di Caprara history are on the website \\"Istituzione Bologna Musei, Area Storia Memoria\\" According to Giulio Pallotta (Mayor of the nearby village of Fontanelice during World War Two), Prati di Caprara in Bologna was used as a concentration camp for prisoners of the Allied army. \\"When signing the Armistice the gates were opened and hundreds of American, British, South African, Canadian, Indian and Australian prisoners escaped from town and vanished in the nearby countryside\\".The evidence is inside the book quoted in bibliography, available on the IBC Emilia Romagna website http://ibc.regione.emilia-romagna.it/parliamo- di/percorsi-di-memoria-guerra-e-resistenza-in-emilia- romagna/allegati/pallotta.pdf On the day of the liberation of Bologna from the Nazi-fascist occupation, citizens, partisans, allied soldiers and tanks crowded the main square, Piazza Maggiore; the future Mayor of Bologna, Giuseppe Dozza, Borghese and Zoccoli, the President of the regional CLN (Comitato Liberazione Nazionale, National Committee for Liberation) greeted the citizens from the balcony of the municipality. The celebration was disrupted by the finding of the corpses of the partisans Sante Vincenzi and Giuseppe Bentivogli, slaughtered and abandoned into the Prati di Caprara by the fascists while fleeing.  Prati di Caprara today  Channel Ghisiliera near the Prati di Caprara Est northern border Prati di Caprara today is a state-owned area entrusted to Invimit Sgr, a company of the Ministry of Economy and Finance, which offers asset management services for real estate investment trusts. They comprehend two areas, which have been left over to landscape evolution and to nature alone since the late fifties. The east ground with its 27 hectares is an urban woodland, by far the biggest green area of Bologna, even larger than the main park Giardini Margherita. The west ground, of about 16 hectares, is only partially inhabited by spontaneous vegetation and houses the dismantled San Felice Barracks (only a few buildings are still in use). The Meadows of Caprara is currently a candidate in the competition for ‚Äúplace of the heart 2018‚Äù, a campaign of the Italian Environment Fund (FAI). = Characters of the Prati di Caprara Est urban forest = thumb The ‚ÄúPrati di Caprara Est‚Äù is a \\"wild urban woodland\\" (sensu Kowarik 2005) that is the result of a \\"spontaneous establishment of shrubs and trees that occurs in abandoned urban and industrial areas without any human predefined scheme\\". The dominant tree layer is mainly composed of pioneer species such as black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.), white poplar (Populus alba L.) and Canadian poplar (Populus x canadensis Moench). Some areas are dominated by young communities of tree of heaven (Ailanthus altissima (Mill.) Swingle) and narrow-leafed ash (Fraxinus oxycarpa M. Bieb. ex willd). There are many trees of considerable diameter and height of about forty years old. These species are gradually going to be replaced by other species more typical of the remnant plain forests: there are in fact several saplings of common oak (Quercu robur L.) and field elm (Ulmus minor Mill.). Inside the woodland are numerous ecological niches (dead wood in different stages of decomposition, shady and humid microenvironments alternated with little meadows) which are essential for the life of many biodiversity taxa (insects, small mammals, mushrooms, plants) linked to wild forests; indeed these species aren‚Äôt able to survive in more conventional urban green areas. Until now, field surveys reported at least 150 plant species, most of them typical of woodland or ecotones environment. Regarding bird life, researchers highlight the presence of European robin (Erithacus rubecula), a species which normally doesn‚Äôt nest in urban areas, common nightingale (Luscinia megarhynchos) and peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), which flies above the woodland for trophic reasons. Moreover the presence of the common moorhen (Gallinula chloropus) highlights the existence of temporary wet areas within the forest.  Peculiarities  Prati di Caprara appears in the novel by the Bolognese writer Riccardo Bacchelli, The Devil at Pontelungo, which tells the Italian vicissitudes of the Russian revolutionary Michail Bakunin and his disciple Carlo Cafiero. Among the episodes of the novel there was the failed anarchist insurrection of 1874 in Bologna, which brought the young Andrea Costa to jail. The insurrection was meant to start at the Anarchist meeting at Prati di Caprara and precisely at Pontelungo‚Äôs bridge, between the rione Santa Viola and Borgo Panigale. In April 1906 Prati di Caprara was the site of the second Buffalo Bill‚Äôs Italian tour, as documented by the photographs of Indians riding outside the exhibition tent.Pictures of the Native Americans in the Buffalo Bill show at Prati di Caprara are kept in the archive Fondo Romagnoli, available on the website Genus Bononiae https://collezioni.genusbononiae.it/products/dettaglio/13801 The famous Italian writer and director Pier Paolo Pasolini used to play soccer at the Prati di Capara during his university years in Bologna: \\"The afternoons I spent playing soccer on the Meadows of Caprara... were undoubtedly the most beautiful of my life. I almost get a knot in my throat if I think about it. At that time, the Bologna football team was the most powerful of its history: that of Biavati and Sansone, of Reguzzoni and Andreolo (the King of the camp), of Marchesi, Fedullo and Pagotto. I have never seen anything more beautiful than the exchanges between Biavati and Sansone (Reguzzoni was taken a bit as a model by Pascutti). What Sundays at the Municipal Stadium!\\"Pasolini's interests on football and the relationship with the Prati di Caprara are documented on http://www.centrostudipierpaolopasolinicasarsa.it/panoramiche/pasolini-e-il- calcio-passione-di-una-vita/ Below the western ground of Prati di Caprara is buried the rubble of the 1980s massacre at Bologna‚Äôs railway station; they were the subject of evidence during the third process, in July 2018.

It is written by showrunner and executive producer Chris Chibnall, directed by Mark Tonderai, and was first broadcast on BBC One on 14 October 2018. In the episode, the Thirteenth Doctor (Jodie Whittaker), an alien time traveller, accidentally transports her human friends Graham O'Brien (Bradley Walsh), Ryan Sinclair (Tosin Cole), and Yasmin Khan (Mandip Gill) to a distant solar system, whereupon they become part of an interplanetary alien rally that crash lands at their final stop on the hostile planet of Desolation. Becoming involved in the race themselves, the Doctor and her friends find themselves seeking out the finish line, revealed to be the TARDIS, in order to get back to Earth. \\"The Ghost Monument\\" is the first to air the programme's title sequence for Whittaker's tenure, which was omitted from the season's premiere, \\"The Woman Who Fell to Earth\\". The episode was viewed by 9.00 million viewers and received generally positive reviews from critics.  Plot  After arriving in deep space by mistake, the Thirteenth Doctor and her friends are rescued by Angstrom and Epzo, two humanoid pilots competing in a large intergalactic race. Reaching the dead, yet hostile planet of Desolation, slightly removed from its gravity field, the group and pilots meet with the race's organiser Ilin, using a long-distance hologram. Both pilots learn that the race's final event involves reaching an object referred to as the Ghost Monument for extraction before the planet completes a single rotation. A curious Doctor learns from Ilin's data that it is the TARDIS, stuck in mid-phasing due to the damage it suffered. Joining the pilots in their race, the Doctor promises to get her new friends home once they have reached the finish line. The group and the pilots locate and repair a solar-powered boat, using it to reach the ruins of a former civilisation that is now inhabited by sniper robots. The Doctor uses the remains of one robot to temporarily disable the others with an electromagnetic pulse, locating a series of tunnels the group can use as a shortcut to the finish line. During this time, the Doctor learns that Angstrom seeks the cash prize to save her family from ethnic cleansing by the Stenza, while Epzo is out for himself due to his upbringing to distrust others. Uncovering Desolation's history in the tunnels, the group learn that the residents died from creating weapons of mass destruction for the Stenza, with the dead cleared up by cloth-like creatures called the Remnants. Trapped by a group of Remnants when forced to a gas-ridden area on the surface, the Doctor destroys them with Epzo's self-lighting cigar igniting the gas. Reaching the monument's location, the Doctor convinces the pilots to claim joint victory in Ilin's holographic tent. Ilin reluctantly agrees to this, but refuses to teleport the Doctor and her friends off the planet with the pilots. A despondent Doctor apologises to her friends for stranding them, but pauses when she hears the TARDIS emerging, using her sonic screwdriver to fully materialise it. With her ship returned, finding that it changed itself both externally and internally in her absence, the Doctor offers her friends a trip home as she promised.  Production  = Casting = Shaun Dooley was announced to be appearing in the series in July 2018, while after the premiere episode, \\"The Woman Who Fell to Earth\\", was broadcast, it was confirmed that Susan Lynch and Art Malik would be among a number of guest actors that would appear in the series. = Filming = Exterior shots for the episode took place within South Africa, marking the first time that Doctor Who conducted filming within the country. The choice of site by showrunner Chris Chibnall was aimed at providing the right environment towards his story for \\"The Ghost Monument\\", though this came with issues when filming began in January 2018. One major issue faced by the cast and crew, during the three week period that exterior scenes required to be filmed over, was a severe drought taking place during work, restricting cast members to having showers within two-minutes. The heat at the location also led to one member, Tosin Cole, developing heatstroke during the work and requiring treatment. The interior scenes ‚Äì including those involving Art Malik‚Äôs character Ilin ‚Äì were primarily filmed back in the United Kingdom once the cast had finished in South Africa, at Cardiff‚Äôs Roath Lock Studios.  Broadcast and reception  = Television = The new opening title sequence was not included in the premiere episode, \\"The Woman Who Fell to Earth\\", but instead premiered in the second episode. = Ratings = The episode was watched by 7.11 million viewers overnight, making it the third highest program of the week, accounting for an audience share of 33.4%. The episode received a total of 9.00 million viewers and an Audience Appreciation Index score of 82. In the United States, the broadcast on BBC America had 1.12 million viewers for the night. = Critical reception = \\"The Ghost Monument\\" received positive reviews from critics. The episode holds an approval rating of 93% on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average score of 7.54.

Before the French Revolution he was a lawyer at Rochefort-en-Terre. In 1790 the young Gillet was sent by the electors of Rochefort to the assembly of Pontivy and in May of the same year he was elected to a position in the administration of the newly-created d√©partement of Morbihan. On 5 September 1791 Gillet was elected as an alternate deputy to the National Legislative Assembly but he was never called on to take a seat. Seven days later he was appointed procureur-g√©n√©ral-syndic of Morbihan, making him, at 25, the highest-ranking local political figure. On 9 September 1792 he was elected to the National Convention, coming sixth out of eight deputies elected. At just over 26 he was one of the youngest Convention members. He generally followed a moderate line, sitting with the Plain while having a number of Girondin acquaintances. During the trial of Louis XVI he voted against an appeal to the people and then in favour of the king's detention until peace was restored. However he refused to grant a reprieve on the death sentence once it was decided. Repr√©sentant en mission Gillet was sent as a repr√©sentant en mission to the western d√©partements in the Spring of 1793. He dismissed administrators and arrested judges. From l'Orient he opposed the Insurrection of 31 May - 2 June 1793 but did not sign the protest petition, which saved him from arrest later. In June he was at Nantes with Merlin de Douai when the Vendean rebels laid siege to the city. On 20 June the Vendean commanders, including Cathelineau offered to allow the Republican forces to withdraw with honour if they sent over the Convention deputies as hostages. Gillet and Merlin de Douai attempted to flee, but the citizens cut the reins of their carriages, forcing them to stay. After the siege was lifted, Gillet dismissed General Beysser, attacked Baco, the mayor of Nantes, and demanded the recall of Jean-Baptiste Carrier. He accompanied the Republican armies in the Vend√©e, before being sent to the Army of the Moselle in 1794. There he denounced a conspiracy in the 17th demi- brigade and followed the army into Hainaut. On 8 Messidor Year II (26 June 1794) he was present at the battle of Fleurus. He was still on mission when Robespierre was overthrown, and quickly rallied behind the new government. After Thermidor On 18 Germinal Year III (7 April 1795) he joined the Committee of Public Safety. Although his attendance was sporadic, he was in charge of military supplies. During the Revolt of 1 Prairial Year III he directed the led the forces that put down the uprising. He left the committee on 15 Messidor (3 July). On 21 Vend√©miaire Year IV (13 October 1795), Gillet was elected from Morbihan to the Council of Five Hundred. His term of office began on 4 Brumaire (26 October) but he never took his seat. He fell ill, exhausted after two years of work to support the Republic, and died on 13 Brumaire (4 November 1795) at the age of 33.

Wasabi is loosely based on Wasabi-No-Ginger and is voiced by Damon Wayans Jr. in the film and Khary Payton in other forms of media. =Fred= Frederick Flamarian \\"Fred\\" Frederickson IV is a total comic book nerd who, despite being the son of a billionaire, spends his time as a sign flipping school mascot who is a \\"science enthusiast\\". Armed with a kaiju costume dubbed \\"Fredzilla\\" and his knowledge of comic book lore, his antics amuse, annoy and aid his friends on the team. Fred is loosely based on the character of the same name and is voiced by T.J. Miller in the film and Kingdom Hearts III and Brooks Wheelan in the series. =Tadashi Hamada= Tadashi Hamada was the older brother to Hiro and, just like him, displayed a knack for understanding and building various forms of technology. He built Baymax for the sole purpose of helping people, but was unable to see this to fruition due to his early death. His death sets in motion a series of events that would lead Hiro to forming the Big Hero 6. Tadashi is voiced by Daniel Henney in all forms of media. =Aunt Cass= Aunt Cass is Hiro and Tadashi's aunt and guardian who was granted custody of them after the death of her sister and brother-in-law. Cass continued to care and love them as if they were her own children though like any other parent she would feel concern and anger whenever they got into any trouble. She bailed them out of jail after an incident involving bot fighting and regretted the fact that she never picked up a book on parenting. She is present when Hiro presents his microbots at the SFIT showcase and expressed joy at seeing him succeed. Cass planned on an after party for her nephews and friends, but Tadashi is killed in a fire, devastating her and Hiro. Weeks later, Cass tries to cheer Hiro up and get him out of the house, leading into a series of events involving Hiro, Baymax and his friends becoming Big Hero 6, all while Cass remains blissfully unaware. Hiro eventually begins attending SFIT much to Cass' happiness and support. The television series expands on her character, depicting her as not only being unaware of her nephew's heroics, but displaying some eccentricities when it comes to cooking and food. This is further shown in the episode \\"Food Fight\\" where she not only is shown mastering many uncommon dishes with a variety of unfamiliar ingredients, but she is shown to love doing so to challenge herself. Cass also displays a ditsy personality that sometimes hinges on ignorance. Though once she does become aware she takes her situation seriously. She also has never dated or gotten married prior to the events of \\"Aunt Cass Goes Out\\" and while she did find Alistair Krei interesting and romantic, she ultimately saw his flaws enough for her to dump him. In season two, she starts dating Chief Diego Cruz, whom she had known since high school. In season three, she displays some athletic ability; revealing that she used to play softball when she was in college. Despite being Hiro's aunt, she acts more like a mother; setting him up to have a date with a girl his age and taking pictures of them when they are going to a dance. She is also shown to be heavily oblivious to major events happening throughout the city, usually due to Hiro and his friends stopping her from seeing anything major happening. =Alistair Krei= Alistair Krei is the self-made CEO of Krei Tech. Considered an influential man, Krei is always searching for the next best thing and found it in Hiro Hamada's microbots at SFIT. He is heavily impressed with Hiro's microbot project and ask that his tech be bought by his company, but he is turned down after a stern talking to by Professor Robert Callaghan with whom he had a rough past with. It is soon revealed that Krei had helped develop a special teleportation device for the government of which Callaghan's daughter, Abigail, was a test pilot to. The test went wrong and Abigail was thought lost somewhere in the unknown and since then Krei has been blamed. Despite this, he has continued in his illustrious career as if nothing happened revealing a morally dubious side. Krei is soon attacked by a vengeful Callaghan, but is rescued by Hiro and his friends who became the Big Hero 6 superhero team. After Callaghan's defeat and Abigail's rescue, Krei went back to business now somewhat more aware of his actions. The series continues to display his morally ambiguous personality. While not evil, he is manipulative and seems to hold absolutely no concern for anything. He outright decides to copy Hiro's microbot transmitter, something his assistant outright confirms and rushes production on a defense drone that he failed to run diagnostic checks on. When he realizes this, he demands that the Big Hero 6 fix the problem or else he will blow their identities. He presents a charming facade when he meets Hiro's Aunt Cass which she falls for, but after revealing his true self, even she found him despicable. While he considers the Big Hero 6 as allies, he prefers that they not visit him often as shown in \\"Killer App\\" where after explaining the original plans for Noodle Burger Boy to them, he politely, yet hurriedly, told them to leave. He initially held a minor grudge against Globby for stealing his wallet, but later hires him to be a spokesperson. He accepts Hiro as an intern at his company so as to compete with Liv Amara whom he has a one sided rivalry with. In \\"Muira-Horror!\\", Krei finally reveals an honorable, sentimental and even intuitive side. He reveals that when he was a child he did not have any friends, so when he went to summer camp he would train himself to know the wilds as much as possible, making him surprisingly knowledgeable about nature. He also jumped into action when Go Go was in trouble, something that surprised her and Hiro. He initially disliked Christmas due to not being able to celebrate it while at boarding school, but immediately changed his mind after Hiro had Baymax dress up as Santa for him. He also wanted to have a bunny when he was younger, but his parents forbade him to have any \\"weak\\" pets. Despite constantly covering for Big Hero 6, he works with Chief Cruz in trying to capture the team. It was later revealed that he was taken advantage of by Trina. =Yokai= Yokai (Professor Robert Callaghan) is a supervillain who was once a kind and respectable Professor and dean at SFIT. Coming from a military background, Professor Robert Callaghan is a pioneer in developing many cutting edge tech inventions including the Callaghan-Catmull Spline. He had a daughter that he loved dearly named Abigail who grew up to become a test pilot for Krei Tech. When a teleportation accident left her test pod lost in an abyss, Callaghan angrily blamed Krei and swore revenge. He taught many students at SFIT and met Hiro Hamada the younger brother of his star student Tadashi. Callaghan was impressed with Hiro's invention: Microbots that are controlled by a head transmitter. Seeing this as an opportunity to get back at Krei, Callaghan seemingly started a fire and stole Hiro's microbots, but unintentionally killed Tadashi. Nevertheless, he continued his quest under the name Yokai and stole many parts to recreate the teleportation machine in an effort to destroy Krei Tech's new building and Krei himself. He is thwarted by the arrival of the Big Hero 6 who manage to stop him and are able to retrieve Abigail from the portal. When Callaghan is carted away by police, he sees his still living daughter being tended to and could only put his head down in shame for the crimes he had and was about to commit. Callaghan returns in the episode \\"Mini- Max\\" where it is shown that he is being kept in a high-level security prison. He reveals that he has worked with Professor Granville in the past as she was one of the best teachers working at SFIT and that she had initially resigned due to an accident. Callaghan admits that he is very remorseful of his actions, especially towards causing the death of Tadashi, and that he understands that his apology is not enough for Hiro to forgive him. He briefly returns in \\"Hiro the Villain\\", where Chief Cruz interviews him about Big Hero 6, but he defends them and warns him that his belief of considering them criminals is wrong. =Mr. Yama= Mr. Yama is a notorious Japanese gangster who runs much of the underground illegal activities in San Fransokyo which includes bot fighting. He owns his own bot dubbed \\"Little Yama\\" which he prides himself on using due to its violent attacks. However, he is outsmarted by Hiro Hamada whose simpler bot managed to overpower and destroy his own. Not wanting to be outdone, Yama asked his men to \\"teach [Hiro] a lesson\\". He gives chase when Hiro is rescued by Tadashi, but after the whole commotion, Yama, Hiro, Tadashi as well as everyone participating in the illegal bot fighting are arrested. Sometime later, he got out of prison and has gone back to doing illegal work. In the premiere episode of Big Hero 6: The Series, \\"Baymax Returns\\", Yama has started to work for the mysterious Obake of whom he himself is afraid of. The series further shows that despite his large overweight appearance, he does display some technical knowhow as he was able to replicate and mass produce Baymax's skeleton after having him for a limited amount of time. He is nevertheless defeated by Hiro once again along with his friends. Yama is also shown to not be very good at working with or controlling others such as in \\"Food Fight\\" he was easily outsmarted by Momakase who paralyzed and stole back a device she initially stole for him. In \\"Small Hiro One\\", Yama is also revealed to have a giant variant of Little Yama called \\"Mega Yama\\" which he had attempted to upgrade. In that same episode, he is shown to be unaware that Hiro and his Big Hero 6 alter ego are one and the same. Despite his criminal occupation, Yama takes samba classes on the side. Television introductions =Professor Granville= Professor Grace Granville is the new dean of SFIT after Professor Callaghan is arrested. Granville came to replacing him the day Hiro started his first day at school. Despite finding Hiro unfocused and selfish, she saw great potential in him due to being related to Tadashi whom she found to be an exceptional student. She continued to question Hiro's motivations and is shown to dislike direct physical contact with people. Later on, she realizes how important it was for Hiro to remember his brother and opted to give him his lab in the hopes that it will keep him focused. Granville shows concern for all if not most of her students including the envious Karmi. Granville gave off the impression that Hiro needed to socialize more and paired him up with Karmi, seemingly unaware of the fact that she disliked Hiro. However, it becomes apparent that Granville intended for Karmi to take a lesson from their brief gathering implying that she is well aware of her moody personality. When Hiro attempted to give up on a project, Granville refused for him to quit, showing that despite her prior perceptions of him, she still considers him a genius. Granville has shown a comically eccentric side as well. In \\"Rivalry Weak\\", she is shown to take the pranks between SFIT and San Fransokyo Art Institute seriously by forcing Wasabi and Fred to act as guards to the cafe, which is the source of SFAI's pranking. It is revealed in \\"Small Hiro One\\" that she had taught at SFIT twenty years prior, something that she had apparently never brought up to Hiro with some of her students including Trevor Trengrove and Wendy Wower. \\"Mini- Max\\" and \\"Countdown to Catastrophe\\" reveal Granville was also a mentor to Bob Aken (Obake) whom she considered enough of a genius to give him free rein in his research. But Aken injured himself as a result in an accident caused by his research, with Granville taking the fall while resigning. She returned years later, but with the intent of keeping her students under control as she feels that \\"students need limits, even geniuses\\" while attempting not to make the same mistake with Hiro. She is later comforted by the fact that Hiro is genuinely a good person. Evidently, it is revealed that she is well aware of Hiro and his friends' efforts as Big Hero 6. In season two, she begins taking a mentor like role and in \\"The Present\\" showed a very nurturing side when she comforted Hiro on his first Christmas without Tadashi. In season three, it is revealed that Granville owns three dogs, all of whom have varying needs. =Obake= Obake (Bob Aken) is a mysterious villain and former SFIT student with a strange fascination towards Hiro, extending to the Big Hero 6 since before they officially decided on being superheroes. He has control over many other villains including Mr. Yama. Through Yama, he also worked with Momakase. In the episodes \\"Mini-Max\\" and \\"Countdown to Catastrophe\\", Obake was revealed to be Granville's student whom she allowed free rein in his research. This resulted in him suffering injuries caused by an explosion from his attempt of creating an energy amplifier, severely affecting his temporoparietal junction which greatly warped his sense of morality and is gradually worsening; despite being given awareness from Baymax, he refuses treatment, finding the condition \\"liberating\\". Out of this insanity and his obsessions, Obake masterminded various events in the first season from Globby stealing one of Lenore Shimamoto's paintings for her energy amplifier blueprint to pointlessly learning of Big Hero 6's identities through hacking Krei's personal files and Burger Noodle Boy's prediction algorithm. Obake finally reveals himself while acquiring the notes he needed from Shimamoto's journal, furthering his goals by help in Steamer's capture and acquiring a super magnet by subjecting the team to their fears. In the three-part season one finale \\"Countdown to Catastrophe\\", acquiring the power amplifier Hiro made while hijacking Baymax, Obake reveals his goal to recreate the Great Catastrophe and remake San Fransokyo in his image with Hiro as his apprentice. But the Big Hero 6 circumvent the disaster, with Obake resigning himself as his underwater base crumbles from the shockwave with his fate left ambiguous. =Karmi= Karmi is an intellectually gifted biology student at SFIT and Hiro's academic rival. Karmi was initially the youngest student attending SFIT, a fact that she was inherently proud of. She was considered anti-social by many and did not have any friends, considering the germs and microbes that she studied as her friends and treated almost as pets. When Hiro Hamada began seriously attending SFIT, Karmi felt threatened and showed an egotistical, cynical and boastful side. She cared very little for Hiro and hated working with a student that she felt \\"stole her thing\\" as the youngest student at SFIT. Ironically, Karmi has a huge crush on Hiro's superhero alter ego of which she was completely unaware was the same person. She is also under the assumption that Hiro has a crush on her of which she mocks him for. She prefers seeing Hiro fail to the point that she will record and upload his failures online, though it has been proven that he is smarter than her to a certain degree. Despite this, her invention gets funded by billionaire Liv Amara. She can be purposefully manipulative to those around her such as in \\"Kentucky Kaiju\\" when she convinced other students that Hiro's accidental mishaps were done on purpose. Karmi has shown some concern for the health of others and criticized Hiro for not considering his own health and those around him when he was sick. She later gained his sympathy when famed scientist Trevor Trengrove kicked her out of his lecture and thanked Hiro for understanding, though they were both mutually disgusted by this afterwards. Karmi also writes fan fiction about herself and the Big Hero 6 with Hiro (whom she calls \\"Captain Cutie\\") depicted as her boyfriend. She incorporates her own scientific thoughts into her stories as they end up inspiring the heroes to use their powers in new and interesting ways. In season two she gets an internship at Sycorax. It is also slowly revealed that she does consider Hiro one of her only true friends and shows actual concern about him. She later develops a bond of sorts with Honey Lemon due to their similar fields of study, but is oblivious when she points out how similar she is to Hiro. She finally bonds with him in \\"City of Monsters\\" and reveals that she admired Tadashi for his genius. She is later transformed into a monster by Amara, but Hiro manages to get through to her by admitting that he cares about her. The real Liv Amara turns her back to normal. Later, Karmi leaves SFIT and San Fransokyo, at the behest of her parents, following the events without saying goodbye to Hiro, but continues to write her fan fiction about Big Hero 6 and herself as Lab Lady. In \\"Legacies\\", she streams Hiro's graduation speech about Tadashi; clearly showing support for him. Since moving away, Karmi has become a success as a webseries creator for her series Big Chibi 6. She reconnects with Hiro where it is heavily implied that she has feelings for him which he might reciprocate. Because of this, she is no longer attracted to \\"Captain Cutie\\", unaware that they are one and the same. She has also taught herself about programming, again implied to have been inspired by Hiro, and uses her new ability to aid the team. She also displays a calmer and more sincere personality. =Richardson Mole= Richardson Mole is a fanboy, comic book nerd and Fred's arch-nemesis. Self-described as \\"San Fransokyo's most eligible eleven year old\\", Mole is a short, overweight, rich snob who is the antithesis to Fred. He owns his own comic book store and does everything he can to outsmart and humiliate his much older rival. He fancies himself as a ladies' man and pursues Go Go whom he affectionately calls \\"dream girl\\". However, the only thing the two seem to have in common is their mutual feeling of annoyance from Fred, though in Go Go's case it is only mild bemusement while Mole outright dislikes him. He owns a whole arcade dedicated to his hatred to Fred with a Whac-A-Mole variant being his favorite. Fred only gets favors from him as a last resort which Mole is happy to oblige simply to show his superior collection compared to Fred's. Ironically, he praises Fred's alter ego, whom he calls \\"Lizard Guy\\", and is completely disinterested in Go Go's alter ego. His mother Binky Mole appears to not like her son's hobby, which does not seem to bother him, but he does hate it when people comment on his hygiene which is apparently terrible. He is further shown to be selfish, manipulative and even downright sinister as shown in \\"Big Hero 7\\". When he found out about the Big Hero 6's identities, he did not feel concern for the potential harm it could bring to others. By the end of the episode, a major static shock to him by High Voltage's orb caused him to forget their identities. In \\"Supersonic Sue\\", it is revealed that Mole does not have any friends, considering the action figures that he has as his only \\"real\\" friends. While he boasts a big collection, he has no one to show it to. He continues to taunt Fred as he purchased the entire Mech-Wrestling League, despite the fact that he does not like wrestling and only did it to annoy Fred. In season three, Mole is shown to be fully capable of converting to villainy; teaming up with the likes of Supersonic Sue and Supersonic Stu just so he can get back at Big Hero 6 for ignoring him, which ironically was his own fault to begin with for abusing their Halp phone for his own selfish needs just to hang out with them, essentially a Boy Who Cried Wolf situation. However, he manages to find some way to weasel himself out of any captial punishment, but his reputation is essentially ruined. =Globby= Globby (Dibs) is a minor thief who was transformed into a super-powered villain. Dibs lived in the more harsher parts of San Fransokyo where he partook in his favorite pastime: taking part in petty crime by stealing purses. He was a terrible at his \\"job\\" as he always found himself losing whatever it was he tried to steal. He was finally successful in stealing Honey Lemon's chem- purse, thinking it was a regular purse, and hid in a warehouse belonging to Alistair Krei. Krei created a neuro-transmitter headband based on Hiro's design, with Dibs deciding to steal it after realizing it was worth something. But Dibs accidentally destroys the chem-purse while fleeing with the transmitter, the unstable chemical mix turning him into a blob-like humanoid mutant with the neuro-transmitter fused to his skull. Taking the name Globby which Fred made up, he had decided to become a career supervillain, though he prefers humiliation over killing people. In \\"Failure Mode\\", Globby learns that he can use the transmitter to alter his composition into any form of matter he can think off, allowing him to actually defeat Big Hero 6 while becoming the first of Obake's lackeys. Globby eventually sees the error of his ways once learning Obake's plans to destroy the city (explaining that he was aware of Obake's insanity but \\"thought it was a 'fun' crazy\\"), and eventually reforms by helping the Big Hero 6 stop his plan. He apparently considers Felony Carl his only true friend. He had Honey Lemon and Karmi create a serum to turn him back to normal after realizing that he could not get a job. He ends up missing his powers and gets them back while also saving the city, earning the adoration of the public. He still hangs out with Felony Carl. Following the events of \\"The Globby Within\\", Globby has gone back to being viewed as a criminal due to Nega-Globby's influence. While it managed to get removed, Globby has been forced to go into hiding which, fortunately for him, he is capable of doing by transforming his appearance. He is later presumably cleared of any wrongdoing when he helps Big Hero 6 defeat Trina and her robot uprising. =Felony Carl= Felony Carl is a former criminal in San Fransokyo. Carl was given his nickname by his own mother, which he does not seem to mind as it is technically an accurate name. He gave up a life of crime, but continued to live in the rougher neighborhoods in San Fransokyo. He is shown to be positive about his own masculinity, as he admitted that he liked having his motorcycle colored glitter-pink. Carl is somewhat friends with Dibs, though he looked down on his attempts to be a criminal and told him to give up. After Dibs transformed into Globby, he still continued to criticize him though the two still seemed to be okay with him. Despite his huge and intimidating appearance, he is shown to be a very insightful person and very good at analyzing certain things and people. He nevertheless manages to find work as a bouncer for various places including the underground Food Fight competition and for various clubs throughout the San Fransokyo night life. Carl is also a self-described \\"hopeless romantic\\" and is shown trying to pursue a love life. He apparently also has a good relationship with his father as he seems to remember his birthday. He maintains information on criminal life despite putting it all behind him and apparently likes to be around Baymax due to his huggable appearance. According to Globby, he used to be known as \\"Delinquent Carl\\". Carl is shown to truly value his friendship with Globby as he was concerned for his safety after being framed by Nega-Globby. =Noodle Burger Boy= Noodle Burger Boy is the robotic mascot to Noodle Burger. He is known for his prediction algorithm which allows him to guess his customers' choices. His designs were originally for the military and designed by Krei Tech, but abandoned. He was reused to become the \\"ultimate nostalgic robot boy mascot\\", but without the weapons. Obake used his technical capabliities to turn him back into a weapon and proceeds to cause trouble all across San Fransokyo. He is able to predict the Big Hero 6's abilities, but is defeated by Hiro and Wasabi when they switch costumes and abilities. He rerurns in \\"Kentucky Kaiju\\" where he takes over the titular monster to battle the Big Hero 6, but is once again defeated and escapes. He eventually moves in with Obake full time and aids him in attempting to blow up the city, though he fails. He completely turns his back on the Noodle Burger franchise and starts working alongside Trina whom he calls \\"big sis\\" and becomes openly affectionate to her. He spends much of season two aiding Trina and becoming something of a sidekick for her in an effort to continue Obake's plans. He attempts to bring the plan to furition, but their plan fails and Noodle Burger Boy escapes while Trina is presumably incarcerated. In the season three premiere, Noodle Burger Boy is by himself and openly misses Trina and Obake and sets out to make a new family consisting of mini A.I.'s such as himself. He succeeds in \\"recruiting\\" Hyper-Potamus, Hangry Panda and Crushroom, all of whom he refers to as \\"sis\\". In \\"Mini Noodle Burger Max\\", he is shown to retain some sensibility as not only was he willing to team up with Baymax and Mini- Max to rescue their respective teams, but he also sympethized with wanting to save what they considered family and shared his power when they were low on it. =Mini-Max= Mini-Max is a miniature sized version of Baymax. He was created by Hiro to act as a babysitter of sorts for Fred when the team realized that he was incapable of being kept out of trouble. However, Fred takes to him like a sidekick and openly treats him like one, declaring that he was the funny one compared to his \\"serious\\" demeanor, though it is plainly obvious that Fred displays absolutely no serious traits while Mini-Max possessed a more determined spirit. He is designed to be overly heroic and displays excellent martial arts skills despite his size. He eventually heads out to fight alongside the team, dressed in a small dark blue armor variant of Baymax's suit. He plays a big role in helping to defeat Obake in \\"Countdown to Catastrophe\\". In season two, Mini-Max becomes a more prominent character and frequently dons his armor to aid the heroes. He gets involved with the numerous shenanigans that the team take part in and displays numerous skills such as cooking. In \\"Mini-Maximum Trouble\\", Mini-Max is doused with water, causing him to short circuit. However, this causes him to glitch and he briefly turns evil, displaying that same amount of enthusiasm he had when he was a hero. Luckily, the team manage to switch him off and reprogram him back to his old self while also waterproofing him. He once again aids the team against Trina and Noodle Burger Boy when they attempted to obliterate San Fransokyo. In the season three episode \\"Trading Chips\\", it is revealed that Mini-Max is slightly self-conscious about his size, but he learns to overcome them. =Di Amara= Diane \\"Di\\" Amara is an evil clone of Liv Amara, the 23 year old billionaire CEO of Sycorax, one of the biggest corporations in San Fransokyo. While posing as her birth clone, she was considered an idol in the technology world and is always looking for the next best thing. Everyone loves her except for rival Alistair Krei whom she does not pay much attention to. While initially interested in Baymax, she was quick to turn Hiro away when she learned that he did not actually build him and thus did not think that Hiro was worthy of her company. She ultimately chose Karmi after finding her nano- receptors more interesting. Over time the two develop a close bond over similar interests and begin to collaborate over projects. She eventually takes her in as an intern for her company. Her villainous side is revealed when she begins offering her services to the likes of Momakase, High Voltage and being the one who transformed Orso Knox into a monster through her own technology. Di displays a benevolent appearance, but is in reality a conniving and clever individual. In \\"Lie Detector\\", she is revealed to be keeping the real Liv Amara in a cryo-stasis for her condition. Di states that she \\"would do anything\\" to help her, explaining her motivation. She later turns on Karmi by transforming her into a monster and then kidnaps Hiro and Baymax in an attempt to remove the anti-viruses that were actually killing Liv. Despite succeeding, she wanted to continue her plans for creating monsters. She was stopped by Liv once she regained consciousness and promptly arrested along with her assistant Chris soon afterwards. =Trina= Trina Aken is the gynoid \\"daughter\\" created by Obake for the sole purpose of enticing Hiro into becoming part of his planned empire. She first appears posing as young bot-fighter who teams up with Hiro in the underground bot fighting circuit. It is soon revealed that she had been hacking into other competitors robots to rob banks. Despite Hiro gaining a crush on her, he turns against Trina forcing her to flee back to Obake. Trina later reveals her robotic origin to Hiro while also casually flirting with him. Following Obake's defeat, she fled. She becomes a full time villain by giving herself a haircut and upgraded robot body. She works alongside Noodle Burger Boy whom she calls \\"little brother\\" and seems to show genuine concern for him. Trina spends much of season 2 trying to concoct her own plan for revenge against Big Hero 6. In \\"Something Fluffy\\", she and Noodle Burger Boy proceed to dig through garbage looking for parts for some kind of device. She openly voices her distaste for the other villains' recent monster transformations; calling them \\"losers\\". It is later revealed that her plan involves using what coding is left of her \\"father\\" Obake. Her plan finally comes to fruition in \\"Legacies\\" where she worked under Krei to create the Buddy Guardians. Now made to look much older and sporting a hairstyle similar to her creator, Trina, along with Noodle Burger Boy, attempted to use thermonuclear reactors, disguised as garbage trucks, to obliterate San Fransokyo; believing that she would continue her father's legacy. She is ultimately defeated and is not seen after that event. =Megan Cruz= Megan Amelia Isabella Cruz is a girl who is the same age as Hiro who recently moved to San Fransokyo with her father, Diego Cruz, who is the chief of police. She is first introduced by Cass who wanted to set Hiro up with her as a potential date for him. Despite having only been with each other for a short time, the two get along really well with one another. Megan begins treating Hiro to regular teenage customs such as going to the prom. The two have since grown fond of one another and, as revealed by Fred, have apparently been \\"dating\\" for quite sometime. She wishes to become a journalist so she can learn Big Hero 6's identities. Not knowing that Hiro is, in fact, the leader of the team, she is unaware of his attempt to deter her from seeking the truth and simply mistakes Hiro's cover ups to him being weird. In \\"Hiro the Villain\\", she begins to double down on her researching when she hits a roadblock and quickly discovers that Big Hero 6 have mostly been spotted at places such as Krei Tech and SFIT. She tries to interview Krei and Granville, but she sees through their defensive interviewing maneuvers. When she learns about Tadashi's death at SFIT and Callaghan's involvement, Megan finally surmises that all Big Hero 6 related events tie back to Hiro. She confronts Hiro on her information and threatens to tell her father about them, but after being allowed to shadow the group and witnessing Hiro's heroic acts, changes her mind and decides to keep their secret. She becomes more active in \\"Legacies\\" where she aids Hiro in finding out where the Buddy Guardians came from. Following her father's revelation that Big Hero 6 are good and that Hiro is their leader, her relationship with her father improves. =Chief Cruz= Chief Diego Cruz is the newly elected chief of police of San Fransokyo. He has known Aunt Cass for years and left the city to pursue his career in law enforcement. When he came back, he had sired a daughter named Megan and had chosen to stay permanently. He considers Big Hero 6 a problem to the city and wishes his new position will allow him to double down on quelling vigilantism. Like most typical fathers, he is very protective of his daughter. Despite the fact that he is close with Aunt Cass, he is slightly suspicious of Hiro, mostly due to his closeness with Megan. Nevertheless, he supports her journalistic endeavors, especially since she is launching a project to discover the identities of Big Hero 6 which would make his job easier. Cruz apparently has a crush on Cass to the point that he is willing to down coffee, a drink he dislikes, in her presence and insists that she call him by his first name. He begins his war against the Big Hero 6 in \\"The Globby Within\\", when Globby's powers begin acting up (a side effect from devouring Nega- Globby). He puts a warrant out for his arrest and for anyone aiding him. When he discovers Big Hero 6's effort in doing so, he puts a warrant out for them. He proudly claims that the Big Hero 6's presence is what causes all the villains to show up. Despite this, Hardlight appears demanding to face them and kidnaps Cruz. Even though the heroes rescue him, he still holds a strong prejudice. It was later revealed in \\"Fred the Fugitive\\" that his attempt to quell vigilantism was mainly due to the fact that his father sacrificed his life to a villain so save his son, and Boss Awesome arrived too late. In \\"Legacies\\", Cruz finally sees the error of his ways when Megan is kidnapped by Trina and calls upon Big Hero 6 to help find and rescue her. Afterwards, he learns their identities. Other characters =Film= * Sergeant Gerson (voiced by Dan Gerson)  The police sergeant of the local San Fransokyo precinct. He appears uninterested in his job or really anything around him.

It was built from 1941 to 1942 by Water Conservation & Irrigation Commission, Defence. It is also known as Lithgow Anti Aircraft Gun Emplacements and Heavy Anti Aircraft guns 3.7 inch anti aircraft guns. The property is owned by Lithgow City Council. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 5 August 2011.  History  Prior to the entry of Japan into World War II in early December 1941 it was the policy of Military Command in New South Wales to give priority to the fortification of the industrial areas of Newcastle, Sydney and Port Kembla. However, Japan's rapid advance and its attack on Malaya and Pearl Harbor, saw the decision made that certain country areas also needed defensive measures in the event of an air attack, including Lithgow and Bathurst. In addition, bridges and roads were identified for destruction, road blocks and obstacles were erected in northern suburban areas of Sydney, tank traps were constructed and a variety of activities undertaken to prevent a land based enemy invasion reaching the inland areas. Lithgow was included as an adjunct to the Sydney Fortress Area in order to place its industries, transport infrastructure and defence site under protection from aerial attack, including the Small Arms Factory in the centre of Lithgow, the ammunition depots at Clarence and other railway tunnels, the major depot at and the various coal mines in the Lithgow Valley and nearby. Sydney Command was particularly concerned about attack from the high level Japanese bombers and low level strafing fighter planes or dive bombers. The Army Command inspection of December recommended the defences take the form of two 4-gun 3.7 inch anti- aircraft batteries plus a Lewis Machine Gun detachment for the close defence of the Lithgow Small Arms Factory. The Small Arms Factory had been constructed as a central defence arsenal between 1909 and 1911 as part of Australia's general movement towards self sufficiency following Federation in 1901. This movement saw greater desire to manufacture and grow food, supplies and other needs at home rather than buying them from overseas.Southall, 1995: 7-9.Robertson & Hindmarsh, 2006: 66-94. The Army concluded that any aerial attack on the Lithgow area would, because of the topography of the Lithgow Valley, be from either end of the valley rather than across the narrow valley. This dictated the placement of one Heavy Anti Aircraft Gun Station (A Troop) at the western end of the valley at South Bowenfels and the other Heavy Anti Aircraft Gun Station (B Troop) at the eastern end of the valley on the heights of Scenic Hill overlooking the Vale of Clwydd. A third detachment was to be mounted on the roof of the Small Arms Factory using a Lewis Machine Gun for the close defence of the factory and to provide protection against strafing fighters and from dive bombers. Work began on the stations immediately and workmen from the Water Conservation and Irrigation Commission poured the concrete floors of the emplacements prior to 22 December 1941. The emplacements were ready to receive and mount the guns on their hold-down bolts on that date. The urgency for completion of the gun stations increased as the Japanese moved through Malaya, Singapore and finally to various islands north of Australia. As a result, no time was allocated to allow the concrete to cure. However the original guns intended for Lithgow were sent to Singapore and remained on the docks there until captured by the Japanese in 1942. This delayed the delivery of the guns to the last week of 1941. The Clwydd guns were not installed until 2 January 1942. The guns at the Bowenfels Gun Station were installed soon after. The guns were protected by temporary sand bag revetments until the reinforced concrete and brick revetments were constructed. These revetments also became the ammunition/storage bays and were designed to protect the gunners from bomb blasts. The Command Posts at both batteries were the next items to be constructed. The Command Post was centrally located among the four gun emplacements and was, according to Southall, of a World War I blockhouse design. From the central room of the blockhouse protected passages gave access to the platforms containing the tracking instruments: the Predictor on the roof of the octagonal section of the Command Post and the Barr & Stroud Height Range Finder and the Telescope (or Toc 1). All the platforms were protected with removable roofs which could swing open on hinges ready for action. The Predictor, manned by six gunners, was manufactured by Vickers in England and was the equivalent of a computer which determined the direction and speed of travel of the enemy aircraft and the time of flight for the projectile fuse setting. This information was transmitted by coaxial cable to each of the four guns in the battery. Whilst the Predictor may have been a primitive computer it had to be kept on target visually by one operator following the \\"line\\" and the other the \\"elevation\\".Southall, 1995: 10-1. The gun stations were connected to the Headquarters in the Lithgow Drill Hall. Both were operational by the end of January 1942. Dummy gun emplacements, farms and other facilities were established around them. The threat to Australia moved further north and the guns were removed during December 1943 and January 1944. The guns and their artillery crews are believed to have been shipped to islands off the northern coast of Australia. The \\"hoax farm\\" buildings were auctioned off after 1945. In 2003 three anti-aircraft guns of the type originally located at South Bowenfels and Scenic Hill were installed at Bowenfels, following their restoration. Works were then completed around the gun emplacements to facilitate public access to the site.Lithgow Mercury, 2003:1. = Anti- aircraft gun station sites = There were over 100 static Anti Aircraft Gun Station sites for defence against air attack were established in Australia during World War II. Approximately thirty were established in NSW, primarily along the coast between Port Kembla and Newcastle. By the end of 1940 Sydney had 36 anti-aircraft guns and a variety of other guns. Newcastle had 28 Anti- Aircraft guns and six others. Numerous additional guns had been added by 1943. Guns, searchlights and other facilities were located at places including Bankstown, Clemton Park, Beverly Hills, Moore Park, Rathmines North Stockton and Nobbys Head (Newcastle), and Port Kembla (Wollongong). Inland, east of the Blue Mountains, facilities were located at Freeman's Reach and Clarenden near Richmond. The Anti Aircraft sites at Lithgow were the only sites located west of the Blue MountainsRobertson & Hindmarsh Vol 2, 2004-2006: 73-74. =The role of heavy anti-aircraft artillery= The primary role of HAA artillery is defence against hostile aircraft flying at a height up to . During World War II the accuracy of bombing was limited to the skill of the aircrew and the higher the bombers were flying the less likely they would hit their target.Browning, K., July 2010. The main equipment of the Heavy Anti Aircraft artillery was the 3.7 inch anti-aircraft gun which came in two versions, static and mobile. The main difference between the two types of gun was that the mobile has the outrigger legs and the static was bolted to the ground and had a large arm atop to counter the weight of the barrel being slightly further forward of the point of balance. It is believed that approximately 50 mobile units are known to survive in Australia. Only two static guns are known to remain. The gun fired a 3.7 inch round (shell weight ) to an effective height of . The muzzle velocity was . Maximum rate of fire was between 12 and 15 per minute. The manning of units varied throughout the war but basically they consisted of a four-gun sub-unit with command post. HAA guns were sited in fours, with a multi core cable from the predictor to each gun. This cable operated two dials (bearing and elevation) on the gun, and with time fuses, a fuse dial, each with an operator matching pointers. The Command Post (CP) was manned by a Lieutenant, Gun Position Officer (GPO); a Sergeant, Gun Position Officer Assistant (GPOA); a telescope identification (TI) operator; a height finder (UB7) manned by three men; and the predictor manned by six men including a bombardier. Each static gun had eleven personnel; one sergeant, one bombardier, nine gunners. Mobile guns had nine; the difference was that the static gun needed two men to load the shell, as the gun was too high for the method used with the mobiles, where a gunner punched the shell into the breach. The guns were located in revetments built to trunnion height and laid out in a shallow arc of about 90 degrees close to and easily seen from the Command Post. At the end of World War II all static guns were removed and only the mobile versions retained. Although Australia produced 600 static 3.7 inch guns of the type originally located at Lithgow, only two are known to remain today. Both are located at North Fort on North Head in Sydney. Surviving mobile guns at South Bowenfels are considered the largest collection of their type in NSW.  Description  Gun Battery A The Lithgow Anti Aircraft Gun Stations are set in vastly different landscapes. The Bowenfels Gun Station is located in a vast cleared area which gives way to new development in some directions with the mountains clearly visible in the distance. The Great Western Highway is in close proximity. The station at Scenic Hill is located in a vastly different environment among disturbed bushland demonstrating the more isolated environment it was historically a part of. Its dummy gun station is located off a track in the middle of bushland. Gun Battery B The two stations include four octagonal reinforced concrete gun emplacements for 3.7 heavy anti-aircraft guns arranged around a central reinforced concrete command bunker consisting of a square, three level building connected to a smaller two level octagonal building. The four gun emplacements are designed to house 3.7\\" anti-aircraft guns. Each has a single entry point via a break in the outer walls. Inner and outer concrete walls form the rifle trench. The emplacements all contain evidence of the gun fixings in the centre. These consist of eight locating bolts arranged in a circular pattern. Concrete revetments which form ammunition storage bays and provided protection from bomb blasts are built into the main walls on alternate sides of the octagon. Commencing on the first side left of the entry point of the emplacement, the storage bays are accessible from inside the emplacements only. The rear of these storage spaces projects beyond the outer of the wall of the reinforced concrete rifle trenches. What appear to be later addition, purpose built blonde brick walls are located parallel to the original sides on the remaining walls. The reinforced concrete command post bunker is a square, three level building connected to a smaller two level octagonal building. It contains various rooms in the form of a World War One Block House (a single small fort). Protective, narrow concrete passages link the buildings. The two smaller buildings each include a flat concrete platform. One was for the predictor, the other for the Barr & Stroud height finder and the Telescope. All structures have fittings such as bolts, indicating the locations of various elements such as timber covers long since deteriorated. The Bowenfels gun station has been cleared of debris and made accessible. Alternatively, the Scenic Hill gun station is in much poorer condition due to their isolation. Three 3.7 inch heavy anti aircraft guns have been relocated to the Bowenfels Gun Station and positioned in three of the emplacements. They are similar to the original guns but are a mobile version. All three appear to be in good condition when viewed by the casual observer, however they are in need of some conservation and ongoing maintenance works to arrest rust and other forms of deterioration resulting from exposure to the weather. At least two examples of dummy gun emplacements are known to exist near Hassans Wall Road at Lithgow. They are accessed via a driveable track leading from Chifley Road. The dummy emplacements are located in small clearings with small, scrubby, native plantings. Raised octagonal cement platforms with a central iron pipe located in the centre cut off to the height of the platform are located on a larger circular base appearing to consist of sand, cement, slag and other materials that have now broken down to form a loose surface that has deteriorated significantly. Overall, each dummy emplacement has a diameter of approximately six metres. = Condition = As at 3 November 2010, the Bowenfels Gun Station is in good, sound condition having been cleaned, stabilised and had debris removed. The Scenic Hill Gun Station has suffered significant subsidence resulting in partial collapse in some areas and nature has begun to reclaim the site. The Dummy Battery emplacements are in fair condition, although the outer areas have begun to crumble and are likely to continue to do so. The only changes to the gun stations have been the conservation and cleaning of the gun station at Bowenfels an installation of mobile heavy anti-aircraft guns there. = Modifications and dates = *1943-44 - Guns removed from Gun stations *2003 - Bowenfels Gun Station cleared and cleaned and guns representative of the original guns located in three of the four emplacements.  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries for Gun Battery A As at 11 May 2011, the Lithgow Anti Aircraft Gun Stations and Dummy Station have state significance as the only known inland heavy anti aircraft gun stations of their type in NSW. The emplacements were introduced as an important part of the network of defence sites established at Lithgow during the latter half of World War II. The defences were introduced to protect Lithgow's important mining, manufacturing and transport industries and the Lithgow Small Arms Factory. The construction of these defence facilities together with those at the Small Arms Factory represents a changing national defence policy in response to the entry of Japan into World War II, and an increased perception of the vulnerability of inland areas brought about by improvements in aircraft technology. This is further demonstrated by the construction of the dummy batteries to ensure local defence facilities were not easily targeted during an enemy attack. Heritage boundaries for Gun Battery B Lithgow Heavy Anti Aircraft Gun Stations and Dummy Station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 5 August 2011 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Bowenfels and Scenic Hill Anti Aircraft Gun Stations and the Scenic Hill Dummy Anti Aircraft Gun Stations have state historical significance as an important part of the World War II network of defences of Lithgow established during the War to defend the important mining, manufacturing and transport hub located there, in particular the Small Arms Factory. The construction of the stations and the associated dummy stations, farm and villages in the Lithgow area demonstrates the increased perception of the threat of the enemy to Australian inland industries and defence sites when Japan entered the war and concerns regarding Japan's ability to reach Australian shores. The establishment of the site represents a change in military defence policy connected with the changing course of the war, and a move from coastal defences to inland defences. The Scenic Hill Dummy Anti Aircraft Gun Station, on which the dummy guns no longer exist, demonstrates not only a change in military defence policy connected with these events, but the desire to ensure that those facilities designed to defend Lithgow did not themselves become targets of the enemy. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Bowenfels Anti Aircraft Gun Station has significance to a broad section of the local community who participate in commemorative activities at the site, actively support its ongoing conservation and provide informal surveillance of the site. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The sites have considerable research potential at a state level in terms of the design, layout and construction of the type and in relation to their use as an inland anti-aircraft gun station and their relationship to other defence sites. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The anti aircraft gun stations and dummy anti aircraft gun station have state significance as the only known inland heavy anti-aircraft gun stations, and dummy gun station complexes of their type in inland NSW. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. One of a series of World War II anti aircraft defence sites developed in NSW from Newcastle to Port Kembla and of a limited number constructed inland from 1941.

In 2006, he founded the UCSF Center for Vulnerable Populations, whose mission is to advance health in poor communities. His research focuses on health communication for vulnerable populations, and the prevention and control of Type 2 diabetes. Schillinger has advocated for increasing awareness and prevention of type 2 diabetes, and became a vocal proponent for the successful passage of a sugary drink tax in the cities of Oakland, Berkeley and San Francisco, California. In 2019, Schillinger was appointed as co-chair of the General Populations Prevention Sub-Committee of the congressionally-chartered National Clinical Care Commission.  Medical training  Schillinger attended Brown University, where he studied Russian Language & Literature, and obtained his medical degree in 1991 from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. He performed his residency training in Internal Medicine at UCSF. He served as Chief Medical Resident at San Francisco General Hospital before joining the faculty there.  Early career and research  Schillinger has led a number of studies exploring the impact of limited health literacy on prevention and control of diabetes and heart disease. His research helped to demonstrate that different levels of health literacy affects diabetes control, complications and overall death rates. Schillinger has sought to improve provider-patient communication by demonstrating the effectiveness of tools such as ‚Äúthe teach- back method‚Äù and the benefits of visual forms of communication with respect to the quality and safety of medical care. He co-authored and edited the medical textbook, Medical Care of Vulnerable and Underserved Patients, and co-directs an international course on this topic for healthcare providers. The patient self-management book he co-authored and developed in collaboration with diabetes patients has been distributed by the American College of Physicians to over 1 million individuals.  Public health advocacy Schillinger served as the Chief Medical Officer for the Diabetes Prevention and Control Program for the California Department of Public Health from 2008-13. Schillinger serves as one of 12 non-federal members of the National Clinical Care Commission, charged with making recommendations to Congress about how federal agencies can be leveraged and coordinated to prevent and control diabetes. Schillinger is a longtime advocate for the public health regulation of sugary drinks. In 2016, he served as the scientific expert for the City and County of San Francisco in defense of a lawsuit filed in federal court by the American Beverage Association for an injunction against the city‚Äôs ordinance to mandate health warning notices on billboards advertising sugary drinks. As a result, the first sugary drink warning label law in the world was set to go into effect July 25, 2016. However, in 2017, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals granted the beverage industry‚Äôs request to block the warning labels, rested on an assessment that the warning notice was too large, not absence of disease causation. The city recently reinstated the ordinance with a smaller-sized warning notice. Industry conflicts of interest in nutritional science and policy were also the subject of two Schillinger authored articles. The first demonstrated that sugar-sweetened beverage companies funded nearly every clinical study that concludes that their products do not cause diabetes or obesity. The second revealed the ways in which scientists funded by the International Life Sciences Institute ‚Äì which is financed by fast food and chemical industries ‚Äì used questionable methods to draw conclusions that national and international dietary guidelines to limit added sugar intake are not based in sound science. The controversy surrounding this conflict of interest was the subject of an investigative journalism piece in The Atlantic Monthly. Schillinger‚Äôs research team demonstrated that the sugary drink tax in Berkeley, California resulted in nearly a 50% reduction over three years in the consumption of sugary drinks, relative to changes in consumption in neighboring non-taxed cities. Schillinger co-created a social media campaign called The Bigger Picture, which engages young people to inspire policy action to prevent Type 2 diabetes through art, particularly spoken word poetry. In April 2020, Schillinger appeared in the PBS documentary Blood Sugar Rising, and the European documentary Un Monde Ob√®se (An Obese World) aired on Arte , which explores some of the root causes and societal consequences of obesity and type 2 diabetes. For his efforts to promote public health literacy in California, Schillinger received the 2016 James L. Irvine California Leadership Award, which also led to a state Senate resolution to honor his contributions on behalf of the people of California.  Publications  * Talmadge E. King, Margaret B.

In 1908, she held her first exhibit, with the students of the School of Arts and Crafts, and received praise for her works from Serbian literary magazines. Before the end of the decade, she married Vojislav Marinkoviƒá, a Serbian economist and politician. Career In 1910, Marinkoviƒá was invited as a guest artist to exhibit with the Lada Art Society, a group founded by the Vukanoviƒás, and became a member of the society in 1911. When the Balkan Wars broke out in 1912, Marinkoviƒá joined her art teachers Petroviƒá and Vukanoviƒá as a volunteer nurse in the Army Medical Corps. During World War I, she accompanied her patients as they made the Albanian retreat across the Prokletije Mountains, taking them safely to Corfu. Among the other painters who accompanied the Medical Corps was Kosta Miliƒçeviƒá, whose impressionistic style influenced Marinkoviƒá's later works. In 1919, Marinkoviƒá became one of the founders of the () and around the same time helped found the Cvijeta Zuzoriƒá Association to promote artistic endeavors in Belgrade. Her works, along with Ljubomir Ivanoviƒá, Kosta Miliƒçeviƒá, and Borivoje Stefanoviƒá, the group of \\"Belgrade Impressionists,\\" and Mihailo Milovanoviƒá among other Yugoslav artists were exhibited in the Fifth South Slav Exhibition in Belgrade in 1922. Years later, she had major exhibits in Turin and Sofia before World War II. Because of the wealth and influence of her family, Marinkoviƒá did not have to take in students to support her art and was able to paint still-life, interiors and landscapes, primarily of surroundings of Belgrade, at her leisure. She also worked in voluntary endeavors with Queen Marija Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá helping poor women and their children. In 1935 her father, Sima Lozaniƒá, died on 7 July; her husband, Vojislav Marinkoviƒá, died on 18 September; and her brother-in- law, John Frothingham, a former International Red Cross official during World War I and husband of her sister Jelena, also died on 20 November. During the Nazi-occupation of Belgrade, Marinkoviƒá lived a quiet and solitary life. When the war ended and the communists came into power, she decided to leave the country. She moved to the seaside town of Gu√©thary on the southwestern coast of France, where her sister had established an orphanage. She lived modestly painting landscapes until the 1970s and near the end of her life donated several paintings from her private collection by Paja Jovanoviƒá and Kosta Miliƒçeviƒá to the National Museum of Serbia. Death and legacy Marinkoviƒá died on 30 May 1973 in Gu√©thary. She has paintings in the permanent collections of the Belgrade City Museum, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Belgrade, the National Museum of Serbia, and other locations both in Serbia and abroad. Some of her works, together with Zora Petroviƒá, Nade≈æda Petroviƒá, and other women artists who were Serbian Red Cross volunteers, are on display alongside each other in the Pavle Beljanski Memorial Collection. Their art bears stylistic similarities, such as expressionist, dramatic, emotional and colorful paintings.

The village of Melnyky was its capital. Kholodny Yar Republic was the last territory in which Ukrainians continued to fight for an independent Ukrainian state before the incorporation of Ukraine into the Soviet Union as the Ukrainian SSR. Thus it was an important part of the Ukrainian War of Independence. During the Soviet era, the history of this entity and its figures was silenced or distorted because, according to many researchers, it could lead to an increase in undesirable attitudes from the point of view of the authorities in society.  History  In 1918-1922, the Orthodox Motronynsky Monastery became the center of the Ukrainian insurgent movement against the invaders (German occupiers and Russian \\"white\\" and \\"red\\" invaders), led by the Chuchupaky brothers. Because of the coup, at the request of the abbot, residents of the village of Melnyky formed a self-defense unit to protect the monastery from looting. The detachment was headed by Oleksiy Chuchupak and consisted of 22 people. Later, in 1919, the detachment turned into a regiment, and Vasyl Chuchupak was elected commander of the regiment (before that he was an ensign of the Russian Imperial Army, and even earlier ‚Äî a village teacher). His brother Petro Chuchupak became chief of staff of the regiment. During the occupation of Ukraine by the Denikin's troops, the regiment took part in their expulsion from Cherkasy. The regiment was constantly replenished and its number reached 2,000 people. Subsequently, the Kholodny Yar Republic was formed. Its territory covered more than 25 surrounding villages and had about 15,000 peasant insurgent army, whose soldiers called themselves Cossacks, and their commanders ‚Äî otamans (in memory of the military tradition of the Cossacks). In November 1919, the otaman of the Katerynoslav and Kherson regions, Andriy Hulyi-Gulenko, arrived in Kholodny Yar. The Chief Otaman of the Kholodny Yar was Vasyl Chuchupak. Otamans Gerasym Nesterenko-Orel, Tryfon Gladchenko, Mykhailo Melashko, Sirko, Oko, Chorny Voron (Chornoguzko), Mefodiy Golyk-Zalizniak, Semen Vovk, Oleksa Kotsyubenko, Kalyuzhny, D. Kanatenko, 1st and 2nd Olexandrian Regiments were subordinated to him. After the death of Vasyl Chuchupaka, the Kholodnoyarsk Republic was headed by the Deputy Chief Otaman, Ivan Derkach, a member of the Kholodnoyarsk Insurgent Committee. He commanded the armed forces of the Kholodny Yar region during the anti-Soviet uprising in the spring and autumn of 1920. In March 1920, the Steppe Division of the UPR Army, numbering between 12,000 and 18,000 men, liberated Kherson from the Bolsheviks and led a successful offensive to the west (via Bilozerka) along the Kamyanka- Yehradivka-Ruzhychiv-Chyhyryn line. The division stopped in the Kholodny Yar tract, where it joined the Kholodny Yar Armed Forces. On September 24, 1920, in Medvedivka, where Koliivshchyna once began, a meeting of the Kholodny Yar Otamans took place, attended by commanders of the Steppe Division and otamans of other regions. At this meeting, Kostya Blakytny was elected Chief Otaman of all insurgent units of the Kholodny Yar and its environs. The influence of the Kholodny Yar was not limited to Cherkasy region. The authorities of the Kholodnoyarsk Republic were also recognized by coastal villages (up the Dnipro to Cherkasy: Ratseve, Tinky, Borovytsia, Topylivka, Sagunivka, Khudyaky, Buzhyn, Lesky, and others). Otaman Gerasim Nesterenko-Orel was the last of the Chief Otamans of the Kholodny Yar elected at the general representative congress of all otamans of the republic. = The fall of the Republic = One of the stages of the Cheka's special operation to liquidate the Kholodnoyarsk Republic was the so-called \\"amnesty\\" promised to those insurgents who surrendered voluntarily. The transition took place in the village Zhabotyn on the 4th (in other documents on the 7th) August 1921. Ivan Petrenko, Chairman of the Kholodnoyarsk District Headquarters, Otamans Derkach, Vasylenko, Oleksa Chuchupak, S. Chuchupak, Tovkachenko (Tovkach), Temny, Lytvynenko, Pinchenko, and more than 20 Otamans and 76 security guards, including Ponomarenko and Wislow, were amnestied. After that, the \\"amnestied\\" wrote a letter to the otamans Khmara, Zagorodny, Zaliznyak and others calling for an end to the struggle and the transition to the side of the Ukrainian Soviet government. The Russian Bolsheviks planned to eliminate the amnestied otamans from the very beginning, but did not dare to do so until November, when they set out to eliminate not only the otamans but also the entire insurgent, \\"suspicious\\" and \\"sympathetic\\" element in the Kholodny Yar area. Very soon, repression against the population became the main means of combating the insurgency. Families of insurgents and \\"kurkul\\" (\\"kulak\\") elements who helped the insurgents were evicted. Property, inventory and food supplies were confiscated from them. All able-bodied people were sent to labor units, disabled people were placed in cities and towns. The Kholodny Yar Republic lasted until 1922, when the Bolsheviks deceitfully lured the otamans into an ambush. However, even in captivity, within the walls of the Kyiv prison, the rebel leaders broke through the guards, seized weapons and tried to break free. During the unequal battle, they all died heroic deaths. Legacy In the 21st century the Kholodny Republic flag was used during the Euromaidan demonstrations and by the Azov Battalion.\\"Russian-Ukrainian war never stopped\\", Gazeta.ua (12 December 2014) In January 2018 the 93rd Mechanized Brigade of the Ukrainian army received the honorary name \\"Kholodny Yar\\" as reference to the Kholodny Yar partisan movement.93 –û–ú–ë—Ä –ó–°–£ —Å—Ç–∞–Ω–µ –•–æ–ª–æ–¥–Ω–æ—è—Ä—Å—å–∫–æ—é. –§–û–¢–û // –í—ñ–π—Å—å–∫–æ–≤–∏–π –Ω–∞–≤—ñ–≥–∞—Ç–æ—Ä –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∏  In art  = Literature = * ‚ÄúCold Yar‚Äù or \\"Kholodny Yar\\" ‚Äî a historical documentary novel by Yurii Horlis-Horsky.

It shows a scene from Classical mythology, of Ixion being is being tortured as the eternal punishment meted out by Zeus. It is one of a series of four paintings by Ribera of the four \\"Furies\\" or \\"Condemned\\" from Greek mythology. It is held by the Museo del Prado in Madrid, along with Ribera's painting of Tityos; the other two, of Sisyphus and Tantalus, are lost. Background Ixion was king of the Lapiths and later father of the Centaurs. He was outlawed after murdering his father in law Deioneus. Pardoned by Zeus, he was welcomed to Mount Olympus, but betrayed Zeus's hospitality by trying to seduce his host's wife Hera. As punishment, Zeus sentenced Ixion to be tied to a perpetually turning wheel of fire in Tartaros. Titian made a similar series of four paintings in 1548-1549 for Binche Palace, the residence of Mary of Hungary in the Habsburg Netherlands, where Mary was Governor for 24 years. On her death in 1558, the series was inherited by Philip II of Spain, and displayed at the Royal Alc√°zar of Madrid, where they may have influenced Ribera's similar series. Titian's Ixion and Tantalus were lost in the catastrophic fire at the Royal Alc√°zar in 1734, but the Prado holds Titian's and Tityos (although the Tityos is believed to be a later version by Titian dated to c.1565, and not the 1540s original). The composition of Titian's lost painting of Tantalus is known from engravings by . Joachim Sandrart wrote in 1675 that Ribera had painted an earlier series of four paintings of the Furies, similar to Titian's series, for Lucas van Uffelen, which Van Uffelen rejected because his wife found them unsettling. The original versions by Ribera are lost, but the series is known from later copies in the Museo del Prado. Description In the painting, the condemned man is depicted face down, his agony expressed by his contorted position and strained muscles, with the dramatic tension accentuated by the lighting. Ixion's large body emerges from a black background and seems to be toppling onto the viewer, whose attention is also drawn by the executioner's fierce gesture to the lower left. His tormentor is a male figure with horns and pointed ears, possibly a satyr. This character is an invention of the artist; in classical mythology, the torments of Hades were administered by the Furies, who were all female, Alecto, Megaera and Tisiphone. The painter may have been inspired in this by an epic poem L'Adone (Adonis) by Giambattista Marino, published in 1632, in which a character with donkey's ears represents greed and ignorance. A second devilish figure appears in the shadows to the lower right. This work measures . It was part of a series of four paintings known as Las Furias (Spanish: \\"the Furies\\", also known as \\"the Condemned\\"): the other three showed the tortures of Sisyphus, Tantalus and Tityos. Only two of Ribera's series - this painting of Ixion and the painting of Tityos - still survive, both now in the Museo del Prado. Reception Ribera's Ixion in a vertical orientation It is not known who commissioned Ribera's series of the \\"Furies\\", though its large format and theme of torture inflicted on rebels against just authority suggests a royal commission. All four paintings were sold in 1634 by the Marquesa de Charela (mother of Maria de Charela, who was a mistress of Philip IV of Spain and mother of his short-lived illegitimate son Fernando Francisco Isidro de Austria), and bought by , protonotary of the Council of Aragon, for the Spanish royal collection. They were displayed at the Royal Alc√°zar of Madrid, and Ixion and Tityus were moved the Buen Retiro Palace, where they remained until they were transferred to the Prado after it was founded in 1819. Ribera's paintings of Sisyphus and Tantalus are lost, possibly among the 500 works destroyed in the 1734 fire at the Royal Alc√°zar. The art historian Jonathan Brown has suggested that the painting of Ixion was intended to be displayed in a vertical format, so the satyr appears in a more normal upright position and the composition appears more balanced, but the placement of the signature implies a horizontal format.

Aims and origin ALQST was founded in August 2014 by Yahya Assiri, a former Royal Saudi Air Force officer, with the aim of documenting human rights violations in Saudi Arabia and publishing reports on these. Assiri described the choice of the name as deliberately using a term from the Quran that means \\"justice\\", in order to avoid the organisation being perceived as attacking Saudi Arabian culture. Reports and appeals =Human rights activists= In February 2018, ALQST opposed the conviction and sentencing of Issa al-Nukheifi, who was sentenced to six years' imprisonment, to be followed by a six-year international travel ban and social media ban, for having tweeted his criticism of Saudi authorities for the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen and against official handling of \\"criminal proceedings and security procedures\\". ALQST has documented the detention of women's human rights activists, including the wave of arrests that started with the detention of Noha al-Balawi in January 2018, who was questioned during her detention for her women's rights activities. Al-Balawi was the first in a 2018 wave of arrests of women's rights activists involved in the women to drive movement and the anti male-guardianship campaign. ALQST described the series of arrests as an \\"unprecedented targeting of women human rights defenders\\" while United Nations special rapporteurs called them a \\"crackdown\\". In August 2018, ALQST called for the dropping of charges against Israa al-Ghomgham, a human rights advocate especially known for her documentation of and participation in the Qatif unrest that started in 2011 and continued during 2017‚Äì18. ALQST stated that the prosecutor in al-Ghomgham's case had requested that she be sentenced to death for what ALQST described as \\"her involvement in peaceful rights activism\\". =Muslim scholars= In September 2018, ALQST reported that Salman al-Ouda, a Saudi Muslim scholar who had in 1993 co-founded the Committee for the Defense of Legitimate Rights, a Saudi opposition group, risked the death penalty for l√®se-majest√© in a court case against him in the Specialized Criminal Court. =Kafala system= In 2018, France 24 and ALQST reported on the use of Twitter and other online social networks by kafala system employers, \\"kafils\\", to \\"sell\\" migrant domestic workers to other kafils, in violation of Saudi law. ALQST described the online trading as \\"slavery 2.0\\". =Appeal to United Nations General Assembly= In October 2018, ALQST joined 160 other civil society organisations in calling for an independent international investigation into the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi and for Saudi Arabia to be suspended from the United Nations Human Rights Council. =Salman reign human rights report= In its second annual conference in December 2018, ALQST released a report summarising the human rights situation during the reign of King Salman. ALQST described the beginning of the reign as a \\"period of repression unprecedented both in its scope and its range of methods, exceeding in intensity anything seen before in previous eras.\\" ALQST listed human rights violations including \\"excessive use of armed force ‚Äì including artillery ‚Äì in a densely-populated residential area\\" during the 2017‚Äì19 Qatif unrest, the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen, and the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi. ALQST divided waves of arrests during 2017‚Äì2019 into three waves. The 10 September 2017 arrests of Salman al-Ouda, Abdullah al-Maliki, Essam al-Zamel and other academics, intellectuals, media professionals and religious leaders constituted the first wave. The second wave was the 2017 Saudi Arabian purge that started on 4 November 2017, in which several hundred prominent Saudi Arabian princes, government ministers, and business people were detained. ALQST defined the third wave as the 2018 crackdown on women involved in the women to drive movement and the anti male- guardianship campaign and their male supporters. The women were detained and several of them were tortured.

The website is based in Toronto, Canada, but is available worldwide and includes user-generated listings for parks, saunas, public toilets and popular sex locations for men who have sex with men (MSM). The site was described as \\"unique and ideal for cruising world-wide\\" by the 2006 Spartacus International Gay Guide. Website Squirt.org is primarily a hookup website. Profiles are completely uncensored. The site has profiles to serve standard hookups, live cam chatrooms, gay cruising spots, videos and Cocktales, which are erotic stories generated by the users. It is available as a free service or can be upgraded for full service. The smaller cities the website usually list public parks, truck stops and mall bathrooms. Larger cities include gyms, malls, hotel washrooms, city parks, libraries, sex clubs, bathhouses/saunas, fetish bars and strip clubs, beaches, public washrooms, video arcades, theaters, cinemas, booths and college and university campuses. The cruising listings on the site include a general description of the location and how to get there. There is a description on the type of people who go there and when the location is generally busy. There are cruising info and tips related to the location. Some listings include a section for pet peeves and warnings to inform users about police activity on the location or about security monitoring. Each location includes a comment section where everybody can share their personal experience about the location. Gay rights campaigner Peter Tatchell says that the listings and postings on the website make people \\"easy targets\\", and \\"brings the places to the attention of people who would be prepared to close them down\\". Increased sexual activities in public toilets (cottaging) due to their listing on the website have caused facilities to close in the United Kingdom and Australia. Squirt.org originally launched its mobile site in 2009 but due to the changes in the gay online dating market space caused by Grindr they released a new format in 2012, which followed adopting the GPS location based technology used by Grindr and Scruff. Squirt Mobile is available via the regular web browser format making it accessible with almost any mobile device. It is not available in the app stores due to the guidelines related to nudity, which is allowed on Squirt Mobile. Squirt Mobile was released first to the UK and later to the rest of the world. Campaigns and controversy The website has attracted controversy due to its supposed promotion of illegal activity, and municipal police branches in some jurisdictions have been known to have \\"vice units\\" monitor websites such as Squirt.org. Due to the ability to seek out others for unprotected sex on the website (\\"barebacking\\"), the site has been used in sexually transmitted infection (STI) and HIV/AIDS research and outreach, as well as research on \\"hookup\\" sites for MSM. The website itself has co-operated with HIV/AIDS outreach programs, which have provided sexual health information to its users. The site's 2015 \\"Non-Stop Cruising\\" campaign sparked a backlash in Dallas, Texas, after complaints were received over their billboard, which featured three ethnically diverse men embracing. In September 2015, the Toronto Transit Commission decided to remove advertisements for the website from its subway trains after riders complained the website promoted illegal sexual activity. Its advertisements were removed from bus stops in Cardiff, Wales, in 2016, following claims they were inappropriate. In 2016 the Dutch Advertising Standards Board received numerous complaints of indecency regarding large signs and posters featuring shirtless men appearing in Amsterdam and other large cities. The Board disagreed with the contention and pointed out that the men were not posed in a sexual manner or even suggesting sexual acts. In 2017 in the United States, a 60-year-old man who met a 13-year-old boy on the website was arrested for sexual assault. In 2018, the website came out in opposition to the Trump administration's view of LGBT rights, using the slogan \\"Make America Gay Again\\" (a parody of Make America Great Again, Trump's campaign slogan) on posters throughout Los Angeles and New York City to coincide with the inauguration of Donald Trump.

History After the Franco-Prussian War, the German Army began to study replacements for its 9 cm Kanone C/64 breech loaded cannons. Although the C/64 had outclassed its French rivals during the war its breech was weak and there was a tendency for barrels to burst due to premature detonation of shells. The new gun designated the C/79 would retain the same ammunition as the C/64 and was assigned to fortress and siege artillery regiments of the Army. Design During the Franco-Prussian war, large numbers of French bronze cannons were captured and this material was melted down and used to build the new 9 cm Kanone C/79 and the similar 12 cm Kanone C/80. The C/79 was basically a bronze barreled variant of the steel barreled 9 cm Kanone C/73 on a fortress carriage rather than field carriage. The C/79 featured a new breech which although similar to the square breech block of the C/64 had a semi-circular face which allowed the gun to avoid the stress fractures which caused catastrophic failures in its predecessor. This type of breech was known as a cylindro- prismatic breech which was a predecessor of Krupp's horizontal sliding-block and the gun used separate-loading, bagged charges and projectiles. The C/79 could fire many of the same projectiles as the C/73 but may have not been able to fire some of the newer high explosive shells that the upgraded C/73-91 could fire. Like many of its contemporaries, the C/79 had a tall and narrow box trail carriage built from bolted iron plates with two wooden 12-spoke wheels. The carriages were tall because the guns were designed to sit behind a parapet with the barrel overhanging the front in the fortress artillery role or behind a trench or berm in the siege role. Like many of its contemporaries, the C/79's carriage did not have a recoil mechanism or a gun shield. However, when used in a fortress the guns could be connected to an external recoil mechanism which connected to a steel eye on a concrete firing platform and a hook on the carriage between the wheels. For siege gun use a wooden firing platform could be assembled ahead of time and the guns could attach to the same type of recoil mechanism. A set of wooden ramps were also placed behind the wheels and when the gun fired the wheels rolled up the ramp and was returned to position by gravity. There was also limited traverse 6¬∞ so the gun had to be levered into position to aim. A drawback of this system was the gun had to be re-aimed each time which lowered the rate of fire. For transport, the gun was attached to a limber for towing by a horse team or artillery tractor. The C/79 used the same limber as the C/73 and the limber had seats for crew members plus ammunition and supplies.  World War I  The majority of military planners before the First World War were wedded to the concept of fighting an offensive war of rapid maneuver which in a time before mechanization meant a focus on cavalry and light horse artillery firing shrapnel shells. Since the C/79 was heavier and wasn't designed with field use in mind it was employed as a fortress gun. However, once the Western Front stagnated and trench warfare set in fortresses, armories, coastal fortifications, and museums were scoured for artillery to send to the front. A combination of factors led the Germans to issue C/79's to their troops as replacements. These included: * An underestimation of light field artillery losses during the first two years of the war and an inadequate number of replacement guns being produced. * An underestimation of ammunition consumption, inadequate production capacity, and resulting shortages. * Since the C/73 had been replaced by the 7.7cm FK 96 n.A and relegated to reserve status there was a surplus of unused C/73's and C/79's. Since there wasn't another gun that used the same ammunition there was also an adequate stockpile of ammunition. * Existing light field guns weren't tall enough to fire over the edge of trenches and their carriages weren't capable of high-angles of fire which meant that despite having gun shields their crews were vulnerable to counter-battery fire. Also, many light artillery pieces didn't have the range necessary to be used in an indirect-fire role. Once adequate numbers of new field guns such as the 7.7 cm FK 16 with better range and high angles of elevation were being produced obsolete types such as the C/79 and captured guns such as the 76 mm divisional gun M1902 field gun and Canon de 75 mod√®le 1897 were withdrawn from front-line service and issued to anti-aircraft units. At first, all of the combatants employed field guns on improvised anti- aircraft mounts, which were typically earthen embankments or scaffolds to get the muzzle pointed skyward. One such conversion for the C/79 was known as the Wohlgemuth system and this entailed removing the wheels from the carriage and placing the front of the carriage on a pedestal made from a large wooden crate with angle iron supports and stabilizers. It was estimated there were still 614 improvised anti-aircraft guns of various types in service in 1918.

To complete this stage, major crossings were required, of Farmers Creek via the Bowenfels rail viaduct, completed in 1870 and replaced in 1921; Marrangaroo Creek (also known as Middle River) via the Marrangaroo railway viaduct; and the Coxs River via a single-track stone railway bridge at Wallerawang, completed in 1870. = George McGarvie Donald, stonemason = The builder, George McGarvie Donald of Lithgow, was a master stonemason and builder who helped create the city of Lithgow. Born in Paddington in 1846, he was son of a Scottish stonemason, George Donald. Donald senior had been encouraged to migrate to New South Wales by Governor Macquarie who wished him to assist with government building works. Donald junior did an apprenticeship as a stonemason under his father and uncle. After this he was engaged on railway construction projects in the Bowenfels district in the late 1860s. He worked on stone railway bridges at The Great Zig Zag and Marrangaroo, and married Marion Wiles, daughter of one of the construction foremen. Following completion of the railway he moved to Hill End and worked on a range of construction projects. Among these was Hill End Methodist church, built of basalt rubble from the gold mines. It is now used as an Anglican church. After the failure of the deep lead gold boom of the 1870s George returned to the Lithgow valley and established a construction business with Thomas Crowe. In the early 1880s he constructed St Mary's Presbyterian Church for Thomas Brown, built as a memorial to Brown's wife, Mary. He also built Cooerwull Academy for Brown, and the St John the Evangelist Church at Wallerawang. Other projects included Lithgow Town Hall, Wallerawang Public School the Lithgow Oddfellows Hall and many residences. Donald and Crowe also built Mort's freezing works. George Donald was extremely active in community affairs and had a great sense of social justice. He was founding member of the GUIOOF Lily of the Valley Lodge and the Good Templars Lodge. Popular among citizens he was elected the first mayor of Lithgow after establishment of the Municipality of Lithgow in 1889. He held the seat of Hartley in the NSW Legislative Assembly jointly with Joseph Cook from 1891.  Description  Located approximately from Central station, the single-track Marrangaroo railway viaduct comprises eight sandstone arches, filled with stone rubble. The viaduct was designed by John Whitton, Chief Engineer of Railways, and built by George McGarvie Donald with convict labour. Crossing Marrangaroo Creek, at the time known as Middle River, Whitton used stone arch construction almost exclusively between and Wallerawang, despite a government decree to use local timber for bridge construction. This was possible due to the availability of local sandstone, which made the introduction of stone viaducts an economical option. While Whitton's stone arch viaducts were replaced by brick bridges during duplication works in the 1920s, many of the original stone bridges remain extant, including the Middle River Bridge at Marrangaroo. The stone viaduct was replaced in 1923, following duplication of the track and construction of a replacement brick and masonry viaduct, comprising four spans.  Heritage listing  Marrangaroo railway viaduct was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. The underbridge at Marrangaroo is significant as one of a small series of early stone arch railway viaducts built in New South Wales in the mid-to-late nineteenth century. The bridge is closely associated with Engineer-in-Chief and ‚Äòfather‚Äô of the New South Wales Government Railways, John Whitton. It is an impressive and highly visible curved sandstone structure. The bridge has historical significance, largely due to its contribution to the early and continuing development of railway infrastructure and services in western NSW in the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century, and also as an example of the use of local sandstone during a period of economic restraint but rapid expansion of railway services during which Whitton was required to use local materials as far as possible in bridge construction. It is a fine, intact and representative example of a stone arch railway viaduct.

He is best known for leading the Loyalists in the Battle of Kings Mountain and for helping, after the war, to settle the new royal colony of New Brunswick. Biography =American Revolution= Born in 1753 into an upper-class family of New York City, Abraham was the great- grandson and namesake of former city mayor Abraham de Peyster. Upon the outbreak of war in 1775-1776 between the rebel colonists and the colonists loyal to King George III, de Peyster chose the King's side. He served in the King's American Regiment, a regiment of Loyalists who were ordered to serve in the interior of the American colonies to re-awaken loyal sentiment and hearten those opposed to the rebels, and was commissioned in December 1776 as a captain. This became dangerous duty in the rebel colony of South Carolina, where de Peyster served under and tried to assist his regimental commander, the recklessly aggressive Patrick Ferguson. Major Ferguson had led the regiment into the Upcountry of South Carolina, where he and his men were badly outnumbered. After the hemmed-in Loyalist regiment tried to entrench themselves on a low mountaintop near Kings Pinnacle, Patriot riflemen surrounded the small detachment of King's troops on 7 October 1780. The Loyalists were besieged and, after rifle bullets struck down Major Ferguson, Captain de Peyster became the struggling regiment's scratch commander. His strategic position was hopeless and he was almost immediately forced to offer the white flag of surrender. In a scene of brutality and poor discipline, many of the Patriots continued to storm parts of the enemy encampment and shoot down their defeated enemies, and de Peyster was forced to watch many of his men get massacred. By the battle's end, there were 1,018 Loyalist casualties and only 698 living prisoners, including de Peyster. =New Brunswick= Following the decisive defeat of the British and Loyalist cause at the Battle of Yorktown in 1781, de Peyster was allowed to return to the royal garrison in his home city of New York. There, on 2 August 1783, he married Catharine Augusta Livingston. He and Catharine evacuated New York in November 1783, bound for British North America. In 1785, the couple began a new life in the recently-organized colony of New Brunswick. In consideration of his loyal services to the Crown, de Peyster was granted lands and appointed to a variety of offices. In 1792, he was appointed by royal Lieutenant Governor Thomas Carleton to be Treasurer of the new colony. While serving in office as Treasurer, however, de Peyster died in Saint John in February 1798. Although honored by his superiors and his neighbors, colonial records indicate that de Peyster died intestate and insolvent.

The Galaxy S10 series is a celebratory series of the 10th anniversary of the Samsung Galaxy S flagship line, its top line of phones next to the Note models. Unveiled during the \\"Samsung Galaxy Unpacked 2019\\" press event held on February 20, 2019, the devices started shipping in certain regions such as Australia and the United States on March 6, 2019, then worldwide on March 8, 2019. It is the tenth generation of Samsung's Galaxy S series of smartphones. As has been done since the Galaxy S6, Samsung unveiled flagship Galaxy S10 and Galaxy S10+ models, differentiated primarily by screen size and an additional front-facing camera on the S10+. In addition, Samsung also unveiled a smaller model known as the Galaxy S10e, as well as a larger, 5G-compatible version, the Galaxy S10 5G. In 2020, a midrange variant, the Galaxy S10 Lite, was also introduced. The Galaxy S10e, S10 and S10+ launch prices started at $749/¬£586, $899/¬£704 and $999/¬£782, while the S10 5G's launch price was $1299. On March 6, 2020, Samsung launched the successor to the S10, the Samsung Galaxy S20.  Specifications  =Hardware=  Display  The S10 line comprises five models with various hardware specifications; the main S10 and S10+ respectively feature 6.1 and 6.4-inch 1440p \\"Dynamic AMOLED\\" displays with HDR10+ support and \\"dynamic tone mapping\\" technology. The displays have curved sides that slope over the horizontal edges of the device. Unlike previous Samsung phones, their front-facing cameras occupy a rounded cut-out near the top-right of the display, and both models use an ultrasonic in-screen fingerprint reader. While providing better performance over the optical in- screen fingerprint readers introduced by other recent phones, they are not compatible with all screen protectors. Due to this, the S10 and S10+ are both supplied with a pre-installed plastic screen protector.  Chipsets  International models of the S10 use the Exynos 9820 system-on-chip, while the U.S. and Chinese models use the Qualcomm Snapdragon 855. The two devices are sold with 128 or 512 GB of internal storage along with 8GB of RAM, with the S10+ also being sold in a 1-terabyte model with 12GB of RAM. They respectively contain 3400 mAh with the standard S10 and 4100 mAh batteries for the S10+ model, supporting Qi inductive charging, and the ability to charge other Qi- compatible devices from their own battery power.  Cameras  The S10 features a 3-lens rear-facing camera setup; it retains the dual-aperture 12-megapixel and 12-megapixel telephoto lenses of the Galaxy S9+, but now uses a camera module introduced on the Note 9 and also adds a 16-megapixel ultra- wide angle lens. The front-facing camera on the S10+ is accompanied by a second RGB depth sensor, which Samsung states helps improve the quality of photo effects and augmented reality image filters. Both sets of cameras support 4K video recording and HDR10+. The camera software includes a new \\"Shot Suggestion\\" feature to assist users, \\"Artistic Live Filters\\", as well as the ability to post directly to Instagram posts and stories. S10+ uses a double hole punch design for the front camera, while S10 uses a single hole punch design. The Galaxy S10e and S10 make use of \\"advanced heat-pipe\\" cooling systems, but the more expensive Galaxy S10 Plus uses a vapor chamber cooling system. In the manual mode, the exposure time can be increased up to ten seconds.‚ÄúHow to use long exposure on my Samsung phone‚Äù ‚Äî Samsung.com support  Models  Alongside the main S10 and S10+, Samsung also unveiled two additional models. The S10e is a downsized version of the S10, featuring a smaller, flat, 5.8-inch 1080p display with no curved edges. Its fingerprint reader is contained within the power button on the right side rather than in- display, and it excludes the 12-megapixel telephoto camera of the S10. It still includes the dual-aperture 12-megapixel and 16-megapixel ultra-wide- angle sensors. There is also a larger, phablet-sized premium model known as the S10 5G, which features support for 5G wireless networks, a 6.7-inch display, 256 or 512 GB of non-expandable storage, additional 3D time-of-flight cameras on both the front and rear, and a non-user-replaceable 4,500 mAh battery. This model was temporarily exclusive to Verizon Wireless on launch in 2019 before expanding to other carriers in the weeks after launch. Charging speeds are 45 Watts on the S10 Lite, 25 Watts on the S10 5G and 15 Watts on the S10e. The S10 series (except S10 Lite) is the last model in the Galaxy S series to feature 3.5 mm headphone jack as its successors, the S20, S20+ and S20 Ultra, do not. In January 2020, the S10 Lite was released. It is a midrange variant of the S10, containing the same cameras as the main variant. It features 128 GB of expandable storage, a 6.5 inch 1080p screen on a plastic frame, and a 4,500 mAh battery. This variant removes the 3.5 mm headphone jack featured on all of the 2019 variants of the S10, as well as wireless charging, instead being equipped with 25 watt Super Fast Charging picked up from the Galaxy Note 10. Unlike the main variants, the S10 Lite is only offered with Snapdragon 855 chipset.  Colours  Galaxy S10e, S10, and S10+ are available in the colors Prism White, Prism Black, Prism Green, Prism Blue, Cardinal Red, Flamingo Pink and Smoke Blue. Galaxy S10e is also available in Canary Yellow. Galaxy S10 5G comes in the colors Crown Silver, Majestic Black, and Royal Gold. Galaxy S10+ and Galaxy S10+ Performance Edition offer two additional color choices: Ceramic Black and White. The Performance Edition ceramic models offer 12GB RAM and 1TB of internal storage. =Software= The S10 range ships with Android 9.0 \\"Pie\\". They are the first Samsung smartphones to ship with a major revamp of Samsung's Android user experience known as One UI. A main design element of One UI is intentional repositioning of key user interface elements in stock apps to improve usability on large screens. Many apps include large headers that push the beginning of content towards the center of the display, while navigation controls and other prompts are often displayed near the bottom of the display instead. Samsung released the Android 10 update to the Galaxy S10 series on 28 November 2019. The update includes One UI version 2.0.  Known issues  The fingerprint scanner had a security flaw that allowed anyone to unlock the phone with a silicone screen protector, which also affected the Note 10.Samsung: Anyone's thumbprint can unlock Galaxy S10 phone Samsung rolled out a patch to fix this problem on October 23, 2019.Samsung develops a fix for the Galaxy S10 and Note 10 fingerprint flaw  Reception  Dan Seifert from The Verge gave the S10 a score of 8.5/10, praising its excellent display, performance, battery life, versatile camera system and headphone jack inclusion. However, he noted that the new in-screen fingerprint scanner was slower and more finicky and camera performance was not as good as the Pixel 3's in low light. Andrei Frumusanu from AnandTech reported that the Exynos 9820 performed significantly better than last year's Exynos 9810, although he also stated that the Exynos 9820 still couldn't keep up with the Snapdragon 855. He has not tested the power efficiency of the Exynos 9820 yet. Marques Brownlee praised the S10's One UI for improving one- handed usability. He labelled the S10+ as one of the few $1000 smartphones that are worth their price tag. Jeffrey Van Camp from Wired rated the S10 9/10 for its all-screen design, fun features, ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, wireless charging with power sharing and headphone jack inclusion.

It was formed in a 1931 when the Evening Telegram, founded in 1877, was sold to the News, a paper with roots in the East Side News, founded under interesting circumstances in 1906. According to Oregon newspaper historian George Turnbull, following the merger, the character of the consolidated paper reflected the News more than the Telegram, though the Telegram provided \\"a number of valuable staff members.\\"  The Telegram  The Telegram was founded in 1877 by Henry Pittock, who had founded the Oregonian 16 years prior. His ownership state connected the Telegram to the Oregonian; although the Oregonian was a solidly Republican paper, the Telegram tended to be more Democratic, in order to keep competitors out of the field. A. C. McDonald, one of the owners of the Telegram Publishing Company, was killed in a duel with James K. Mercer, assistant editor of the Portland Bee, in 1878. The paper had a high degree of turnover in its leadership in its first decade. One consistent presence was Catherine Amanda Coburn, sister of Harvey W. Scott and Abigail Scott Duniway, who ran the editorial page from 1883 to 1888, when she left for the Oregonian. Richard D.

It was designed by the New South Wales Government Railways and the station building was built by Goodsell & Wright, as a contractor. It is also known as Eskbank Railway Station group and Lithgow Goods Station/ Lithgow Site S1. The property was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The Great Western Railway opened through Lithgow in 1869. As part of the rail construction a road overbridge was erected at Bells Line of Road (now called Bridge Street) at Eskbank. This was the first road overpass to be built outside Sydney. It was completed on 18 October 1869 and is one of the oldest surviving overbridges on the NSW railway system. It was modified in the 1880s when the line was duplicated and modified further when the deck width was increased to accommodate modern road traffic. The latter modifications can be seen in the brick extensions to the abutments on the Down side. In 1875 a private stopping place was developed, near Coal Stage Hill (close to the site of the former Eskbank Locomotive Depot), for the use of Thomas Brown, owner of the property called Eskbank. This stopping place was originally called 'Brown's Siding'. The name was changed to Esk Bank in August 1876. The new Eskbank Station was opened on 1 March 1882 following the duplication of the Western Line through Lithgow in October 1880. Two side platforms were erected but only a shelter was erected on the Bourke-bound platform. The present brick and stone structure on the Sydney-bound platform was opened for the duplication. Eskbank played a role in the extensive trials which were undertaken during the 1880s and 1890s to ascertain the most suitable types of locomotives to be used for the haulage of freight and passengers on the Blue Mountains line. One of the most significant of these trials was the comparative assessment of the British built 373 class locomotive against the American 304 class which took place in 1887. These trials established the dominance of the American design features, which were to influence locomotive acquisitions in NSW for several decades. The small, cramped Eskbank Locomotive Depot opened in 1882 and operated until 1915 when a new locomotive depot was established about one kilometre further to the east. It existed principally to stable and service locomotives operating between Eskbank and Sydney, Eskbank and Bathurst, and Eskbank and Mudgee. It was home to locomotives which provided assistance to trains on the steep grades of the Lithgow Zig Zag, and also to locomotives that operated the many industrial and colliery sidings in the Lithgow Valley. The new loco site to the east contained a 60-foot turntable, provision for two round houses, an engine shed, stores and coal loading ramps. In addition to these structures the depot had an enginemen's barracks situated at the north-west entrance to the depot site. Archaeological remains of the 1880s locomotive shed are extant. The goods shed at Eskbank was also erected in 1882 and its \\"through\\" design provides some evidence to a notion that it had been relocated from Wallerawang. There is an open loading platform on the west end where the first goods loading crane once stood. Parts of this platform were originally enclosed on part of the building, but the extent is not clear. The current awning was constructed c.1960 when an earlier awning was removed. The goods shed suffered a major fire in 1996. Some timber roof framing members and parts of the roof sheeting were damaged and subsequently repaired. The shed was reduced in length at this time and one timber door was salvaged and stored in the building as a spare. The yard also features a small workshop/ gangshed ; a Avery \\"cart\\" weighbridge and shed ; a gantry crane (TC707) ; and a \\"stiff-legged\\" or \\"tripod\\" crane (T499) . There is a tank and water column south of the Inch Street bridge, thought to have been re-located in the 1990s. The items were transferred from Tarana and have no relationship to their current site where no watering facilities have stood before. The site also contains a number of ground level and sub-ground relics relating to past site activities and in particular steam railway activities. They include remains of the horse dock, loading banks, tracks and points and communications structures. The signal box at Eskbank was opened in the same year and is the oldest signal box in use in NSW. It was built as a component of the provision of new passenger and goods facilities for Lithgow in the first half of the 1880s. It was a standard design of the period. An overline coal stage was provided at Lithgow Coal Stage Box enabling engines to take coal on both main lines without detaching from their trains. The impending electrification to Bowenfels in 1957 saw the need for this facility greatly diminished and it was demolished, possibly prior to electrification to reduce the interaction between falling coal and the overhead wiring. For more than four decades Eskbank was the centre of railway activities in the Lithgow Valley, and for steam operations in and out of the Valley. Trains started or terminated their journeys at Eskbank and through-trains were timed to stop there. However its importance waned in 1925 with the construction of Lithgow Station about 1 kilometre to the west. The new station was constructed in response to local agitation to establish one central station rather than to persist with two stations so close together. All buildings associated with the Locomotive Depot were removed from the site following the depot closure, and the turntable was relocated to Coolah. The station was closed for passenger use in 1925 when the present Lithgow station was opened. Eskbank became the Lithgow Goods Depot and Station Master's headquarters from the mid 1920s until the 1980s. Since that time it has served as a depot for railway maintenance activities in the district. The Eskbank platform building remained in use as an office for track staff until it was vacated and a lease for the premises was taken out by the State Mine Railway.  Description  The complex comprises the following buildings and structures: *Main Station Building (1882) *Down Platform Shelter () *Workshop/ Gang Shed () *Weigh Bridge and Shed - 20 ton, post war (s) *Goods Shed (, ) *Yard Signal Box, type E, timber elevated (1885) *Up Platform () *Down Platform () *Bridge Street Overbridge (1869) *Culvert *Tank and Water Column *Former pedestrian entrance ramp *Yard Crane- T499, (/60s) *Horse Dock, () *Former Locomotive Depot including Gantry Crane (7 tons) =Main station building, erected 1882= External: The 1882 station building is a fine example of the design adopted by John Whitton for stations at significant locations along the western, southern and northern railway lines during the first decades of NSW railway construction and is an example of the Victorian Italianate style. The design is based on a simple pavilion with a pitched gable roof. The principal design features, such as chimneys, windows and doors are arranged symmetrically in the classical manner, reinforced by the use of stone cornices, quoins, architraves and base course in an otherwise brick masonry building. The main fa√ßade features a pronounced breakfront with a pedimented stone window bay with large-section, sandstone architraves and finely worked sandstone dentils under the cornice of the pediment. The sandstone window bay is made up of full sections of stone in the lintel and architraves with a finely detailed dentilled cornice. The brickwork is laid in red bricks in Flemish bond and tuckpointed with fine white joints. The northern side of the station was the principal entrance in the original design. It features the central breakfront, with the fine sandstone bay window, and originally a pair of symmetrical verandahs that protected visitors entering the station via the general waiting room. The verandahs were removed from the northern fa√ßade, and the doorways that provided access from the verandahs to the general waiting room were bricked up. The platform awning is timber framed with columns set back from the platform edge and a large cantilever, corrugated iron roof. The supports are ornate cast iron Corinthian columns and ornate cast iron cantilever brackets. The verandah is intact in its authentic form. The main roof of the station is a hipped gable with a short transverse hipped gable over the northern breakfront and a segment in the roof over the smaller, southern breakfront. The roof is sheeted with corrugated steel. The former west end wall of the building was demolished to create a larger room by the addition of a timber extension. Internal: The original linear floor layout arrangement remains intact. The planning arrangement is typical. The large central room was the general waiting room adjoined by a booking office with two ticket windows. The room on the Down side of the general waiting room was the telegraph office. At the Down end there were two additional rooms; a parcels office and the porter's and lamp room. On the Up end there was a ladies' waiting room with an adjoining toilet. The men's toilet and urinals were accessible from the platform. The function of the rooms changed following the conversion of the station to the goods depot and Station Master's headquarters. The traditional interior finishes are mostly plain including timber-boarded floors; plain plastered walls and ceilings; timber boarded ceilings in minor spaces and painted timber moulded joinery. These finishes remain largely intact although damaged by years of use and lack of maintenance. Fireplaces have been boarded up and the toilets fittings are relatively recent with tile wall cladding and flooring. =Down platform shelter, erected = The shelter is built in a style to match the main station building. It features plain stretcher bond brickwork on the brick and stone platform base with a low-pitched hip gable roof with corrugated iron or steel sheeting. It was built with two small, enclosed rooms with an open area between. The walls of the two rooms were subsequently demolished and the whole structure was altered to be entirely open on the trackside with a single solid wall on only the south side. =Workshop / Gang shed, erected = External: It is a simple timber-framed, gable roofed structure with corrugated steel roof sheeting and unpainted cliplock profile steel wall cladding that stands on the north-western side of the former station forecourt. Internal: The interior is plain unlined and there are timber storage racks, generally relocated or reused items. There is evidence that the building was extended at the southwest end at some stage. The upturned edge on the concrete slab floor continues across the space and has evidence of external cladding. =Weighbridge and shed, erected s= The AVERY weighbridge was made by W&T; Avery of Birmingham, England, and dates from the post war period. The scales were probably not enclosed originally but are now protected by a small structure clad with asbestos cement sheeting in a 1950s style. The scales are not extant. =The Goods Shed, erected s, modifications in s= Standard timber-framed, corrugated steel clad through goods shed with an elevated timber loading deck on the northern side with large timber sliding doors on the northern fa√ßade. A modern concrete platform has recently been built north of the loading dock where there would originally have been road vehicle access. There is an open loading platform on the west end where the first goods loading crane once stood. The current awning was constructed when an earlier awning was removed. The goods shed suffered a major fire in 1996. Some timber roof framing members and parts of the roof sheeting were damaged and subsequently repaired and the shed was reduced in length at this time. =Yard signal box, erected 1885= External: A small relatively square shaped and elevated timber framed traditional signal box of early standard design with a gabled corrugated iron roof with cantilevered iron awnings above the windows. The walls are clad with rusticated timber weatherboards and the gable bargeboards are in the form of decorative scalloped shapes with timber turned finials. The sliding windows are small multi-paned and timber framed and sashed and the first floor landing containing a toilet is cantilevered on cast iron decorative brackets. Access to the signal control room is by a recent steel staircase. It is located on the Down side near the Eskbank Station. Internal: Internally the walls and ceiling are clad with flat beaded edge lining boards. The signal and point control lever mechanism of 24 levers remain, of which 16 are still in use. The lever operations have been sympathetically adapted in some cases to operate the contemporary power light signals and associated track points while a number of them still operate mechanically to serve the nearby sidings. On the walls are fitted the original track diagrams and a number of signal tools extant. =Platforms, Up Platform erected , Down Platform erected = The main station building (Up) platform is brick faced with bitumen paving and concrete deck. It has been secured by wire mesh and pipe fencing along the rail side. The Down platform is brick faced with projecting stone edge and aggregate surface. It extends as a ramp on one side. =Former locomotive depot and gantry crane= Originally located to the east of the station site, on the Up side, and consisting of a sixty-foot Sellars turntable and a three-road, timber-framed, corrugated iron-clad engine shed with a central ventilating ridge and separate smoke chutes over each road. Each of the three roads contained an inspection and servicing pit. The locomotive coaling facilities were located to the east of the locomotive depot on the site that is now called Coal Stage Hill. Watering facilities were located at the south-west corner of the depot, adjacent to the Main Western Railway Line. The gantry crane TC707 may have been installed in the 1960s. The only physical remains of the depot are water tank and building footings, pipes and the servicing and turntable pits. These had been filled with ash and partly covered with soil. The turntable pit has a sandstone coping. =The Bridge Street overbridge, erected 1869= The overbridge is constructed of rusticated sandstone abutments and a plate iron deck. The modern concrete bridge deck on iron girders was constructed in 1957 to accommodate the overhead wiring when the line was electrified. The eastern abutments are believed to be substantially as-built while the southern abutments were reconstructed or encased within new brickwork to accommodate widening for modern road traffic requirements. The bridge has an open chainmesh balustrade and pipe railing, which replaced original low stone parapet. =Tank and water column= Located to the south of the Inch Street bridge at a new platform and thought to have been re- located in the 1990s. The items were transferred from Tarana and have little significance to their current site where no watering facilities have stood before. =Other structures= The overhead wiring portals and masts are simple unpainted steel structures that presumably date from the late 1950s. The overhead wiring is modern. These are minor structures that are generic to the railway environment and not specific to the site. There is a single white painted semaphore signal mast on the Down side of the Down track at the Sydney end of the Down platform. This might be the same as formerly located directly opposite on the Up side. =Yard crane, erected = A type 2 tripod crane No.T499 and is an example of the last type of tripod crane made of welded steel on a concrete base. =Horse dock, erected = Timber frame dock with timber post supports at the corners and sides with additional steel posts for strength. It is located near the yard crane. =Moveable items= Apart from one extant cast iron bubbler on the main Platform there are no known moveable items within the Eskbank Railway Precinct. =Landscape features= The site is generally in the form of an industrial area with a large number of remnant structures, bitumen parking areas and sidings associated with the early station and goods yard activities. Landscaping consists of overgrown garden, trees and shrubs of the surrounding sites around the perimeters. =Potential archaeological features= The archaeological remains of the locomotive depot may exist however; they have moderate technical significance for their connection to the evaluation and adaptation of comparative British and American technologies which took place in the l880s and 1890s. The site also contains a number of ground level and sub-ground relics relating to past site activities and in particular steam railway activities. They include remains of loading banks, tracks and points and communications structures. The turntable pit has a sandstone coping that is rare and possibly the only remaining example of its type. It has not been modified since the 1920s. = Condition = *Station Building: Moderate. The masonry elements of the station building are generally sound although there is some deterioration in the decorative stonework quoins and dressings and surface soiling on the platform fa√ßade. The major cause of deterioration of the station building is the entry of water into the footings and sub-floor spaces. This comes from overland flows from the carpark and from downpipes which discharge onto the ground. The problem is exacerbated by raised ground levels, the demolition of the north verandahs and the installation of concrete slabs in some rooms. This has caused rising damp and associated salt attack of the stonework and encouraged termite infestation and related damage in the western addition. *Down Platform Shelter: Moderate *Workshop/Gang Store: Moderate *Weighbridge and Shed: Good-Moderate *Goods Shed: Moderate *Yard SB: The condition of the building and equipment is good and have high archaeological potential. *Locomotive Depot: Moderate to Poor *Work is required to stabilise the masonry of the archaeological remains relaying loose and dislodged bricks and stone in lime mortar, preserving timber and metals and adjusting ground levels and clearing drains to ensure site drainage is functioning. *Yard Crane: Good condition. The Eskbank station building is largely intact and the precinct retains many of the original structures on site, including one of the oldest goods sheds in the State. The signal box retains a high level of intactness, and its integrity is excellent due to its operational status. = Modifications and dates = *: Down Platform Shelter walls demolished and the whole structure altered *: Slate roof replaced with corrugated steel on station building *1957: Yard SB signal system partially adapted for electric light signals. *1996: Some timber frame elements and roof sheeting replaced in goods shed following a major fire *s: Minor internal modifications to station building for new use . *N.d: Various minor changes, most of which have been removed since 1960. Locomotive Depot: All buildings were removed from the site following the depot closure, and the turntable was relocated to Coolah. The yard was subsequently used for other railway purposes with further lines and structures.  Heritage listing  As at 26 October 2010, The Eskbank Railway Precinct is of state significance as an early railway precinct, important in the course of NSW's history due to its key role in the industrial development of the Lithgow Valley. It was the first railway yard and locomotive depot in the Lithgow Valley and served as a major locomotive depot through the 1880s boom, the 1890s depression and the Federation era. Eskbank Railway Precinct is of further significance as the terminating place of locomotive trials undertaken in the 1880s and 1890s, which evaluated the technologies and design principles which were to influence locomotive design in New South Wales until the close of the steam era. The Eskbank station and the nearby remains of the locomotive depot, branch line and associated infrastructure demonstrate a class of first generation railway places. The site was established within the context of other economic and industrial developments including mining, housing, transportation of goods to Sydney and greater NSW, and it is from these that it draws its greater significance. The precinct retains most of the original structures including one of the oldest goods sheds in the State; however, the demolition of all above ground locomotive depot structures in the 1920s has compromised the overall value of the place. Eskbank Railway Precinct is of aesthetic significance as a fine example of the first stations built on the NSW railway system. The station building is aesthetically significant as an example of a Victorian Italianate style station building utilising tuck pointed brickwork to the body of the wall and classically detailed stone quoins, cornices and a pedimented bay window. The masonry details and Victorian ironwork was both functional and decorative and was a forerunner to the next generation of grander stations in NSW. The Eskbank station building is of state heritage significance as a largely intact example of the simple, classically-inspired, masonry station building type introduced by John Whitton in the 1860s. Its history is closely associated with an area that is sometimes referred to as the cradle of Australian industry. As such it has a high level of significance due to its association with important developments in transport, technology and industry. The goods shed and the remains of the locomotive depot contribute to the overall value of the place, as well as the link to the State Mine site. Eskbank Railway Precinct has research significance as a railway yard with varying buildings and infrastructure that remain partly intact and as an example of traditional country railway station yards in New South Wales. The weighbridge, yard crane, horse dock, gantry crane, two major bridges and the branch line contribute to the significance of the precinct. The archaeological remains of the locomotive depot have moderate technical significance for their connection to the evaluation and adaptation of comparative British and American technologies which took place in the l880s and 1890s. Lithgow Yard signal box is of state significance as a small and intact elevated signal box dating from 1885, and as the oldest operating in the state. The signal box retains most of the original equipment and still operates a number of original semaphore signals in the yard. It forms a classic 19th century railway structure in the historic Eskbank station yard. It is closely related to the early development of the Eskbank station precinct and branch colliery lines. Eskbank railway station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Eskbank Railway Precinct is of historical significance as an important place in the railway history of New South Wales and Lithgow. It was the first railway yard and locomotive depot in the Lithgow Valley and served as a major locomotive depot through the 1880s boom, the 1890s depression and the era of Federation. Eskbank Railway Precinct has high significance as the terminating place of locomotive trials undertaken in the 1880s and 1890s, which evaluated the technologies and design principles which were to influence locomotive design in New South Wales until the close of the steam era. Eskbank Railway Precinct has high significance for its association with the state mining and industrial developments within the Lithgow Valley from the 1870s until the 1920s. The precinct played an important role in housing, maintaining and servicing the locomotives which operated on the railway lines in the Lithgow Valley and that transported goods to Sydney and greater NSW. Lithgow Yard Signal Box is of historical significance as the oldest known surviving railway signal box in NSW remaining in near original condition with most of its equipment dating back to 1884. It is closely related to the early development of the Eskbank Station Precinct and branch colliery lines. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Eskbank Railway Precinct is of significance for its association with John Whitton, Engineer-in-Chief of the NSW Railways, and his colleagues and successors. Eskbank Station is one of the now small number of purpose-built railway stations introduced by John Whitton for a then new function. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Eskbank Railway Precinct is of aesthetic significance as a fine example of the first stations built on the NSW railway system. The station building is aesthetically significant as an example of a Victorian Italianate style station building utilising tuckpointed brickwork to the body of the wall and classically detailed stone quoins, cornices and a pedimented bay window. The masonry details and Victorian ironwork was both functional and decorative and was a forerunner to the next generation of grander stations in NSW. Eskbank has significance as a relatively intact railway station that has more or less survived in the form it was in the 1920s. Lithgow Yard signal box is of aesthetic significance as an excellent and intact example of the traditional smaller timber elevated signal boxes. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Eskbank Railway Precinct has social significance as an important site in the social history of Lithgow up to the 1920s. The place is now held in high esteem by the rail heritage groups, local council and volunteers who continue to be associated with the site and promote its conservation. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Eskbank Railway Precinct has research significance as a railway yard with varying buildings and infrastructure that remain partly intact and as an example of traditional country railway station yards in New South Wales. The weighbridge, yard crane, horse dock, gantry crane, two major bridges and the branch line contribute to the significance of the precinct. The signal box has a high level of both technical and research potential for its ability to demonstrate characteristics and design requirements of standard elevated timber boxes of the 1880s as well as changing technology in the signalling system. The archaeological remains of the locomotive depot have moderate technical significance for their connection to the evaluation and adaptation of comparative British and American technologies which took place in the l880s and 1890s. The challenge of moving freight across the rugged Blue Mountains and through the demanding Zig Zags from Eskbank to Penrith led local engineers into a worldwide search for steam engineering solutions, which were tested between Sydney and Eskbank. The results of the trials were then translated into purchasing and design decisions which led to the creation of Australian locomotives which were an amalgam of British and American design and construction principles. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Eskbank Railway Precinct has rarity significance for its collection of distinctive railway buildings and infrastructure. The goods shed has significance as an early, albeit altered, example of a through-shed and is one of only a few of its type that remain in the Metropolitan area. The Down platform structure has significance as an early and rare platform shelter. The locomotive depot is an archaeological site with remnants of a turntable pit that has been rimmed with sandstone coping. This gives the pit some significance, as it is possibly the only remaining pit of this type. The yard signal box is one of the oldest in NSW and one of only six similar boxes remaining in the State. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The Eskbank Railway Precinct is of representative significance as one of a large number of purpose built railway stations in NSW built in the period of intense activity between the early 1860s and the late 1880s. It is a representative example of the first group of linear station buildings built in a simple but elegant domestic style with some decorative elements in the Victorian Italianate style. The station building is representative of the John Whitton style and the yard layout is typical of the period. The signal box is a representative example of traditional timber elevated signal boxes of its design. The substantial archaeological remains of the locomotive depot are representative of a medium-sized locomotive servicing depot of the 1880s. They and the branch line also represent the link between industrial and railway development. It is not considered to be rare as many other locomotive depots of this era survive in a far more complete state but it enhances the value of the overall site.

With a current circulation of 3,600, it is both the oldest and the largest paper in the area. Still independently owned, it is currently run and written by Joan Lawrence-Bauer, with a headquarters in Arkville, NY. It is available in print and on-line editions.  History  The News traces its roots to the founding of the Utilitarian in 1863. The first newspaper in the town of Margaretville, the paper was published by Orson M. Allaben. After passing through a number of hands it was purchased by the Catskill Mountain News. In 1894, the Margaretville Messenger was founded by a stock company, which hired as editor John Grant. It continued to 1902, when it was sold to W. E. Eells, who renamed it the Catskill Mountain News. When Eells died suddenly, just two years later, Clarke Sanford, a local schoolteacher, approached his widow about the paper. Eells's widow offered to let Sanford run it on credit. If he were to make a profit, he would pay her the purchase price; if not, she would reclaim the paper. Sanford agreed to the terms and after a tough initial few years made good on the loan. Sanford would run the paper for over 60 years, presiding over the expansion of the newspaper. In 1918, he purchased the Utilitarian, altering the News's numbering to date back to that paper's 1863 founding. He also invested in updated Linotype printing, and changed locations as the paper grew. The paper would be passed on to Clarke's son Roswell, on his death in 1964. In turn it was passed to Roswell's son Richard D. Sanford. By 1990, the paper was struggling, which the younger Sanford believed was a result of low overall economic activity in New York's more rural areas. Sanford noted that with shopping increasingly being concentrated in larger stores in more central cities, advertising in rural towns was less sustaining: \\"Stamford is about 25 miles out of Oneonta, and the growth of the Oneonta market has had a corresponding negative impact on the retail industry in Stamford.\\" He went on to note the future of the publication was a relentlessly local focus, and that of the weeklies he published Catskill Mountain News was the most robust. In 2017, the paper was sold to Joan Lawrence-Bauer, a former writer for the News.

The field of social vision is highly interdisciplinary and located at the nexus of social psychology, communication studies, and vision science.Johnson, K. L., & Adams, R. B. (2013). Social Vision: An introduction. Social Cognition, 31 (6), 633-635. Much of the research in social vision is based on the prevailing theory that the visual system is particularly attuned to social cues in the environment. More of the human brain is devoted to vision than all other senses combined, and social vision research seeks to understand how humans are able to use vision to accurately perceive characteristics of other individuals such as age, race, gender, and sexual orientation in a short time frame as well as how individual beliefs may bias the way humans perceive said individuals.  Historical development  Social vision was developed as a research field in the early 2000s. The Science of Social Vision, an amalgamation of social vision research, was released in 2010,Adams, R. B., Jr., Ambady, N., Nakayama, K., & Shimojo, S. (Eds.), 2010. The Science of Social Vision. New York, NY: Oxford University Press. followed by a special edition issue of Social Cognition in 2013 that focused on social vision. The field developed at the intersection of social psychology and vision science, borrowing techniques from both fields to investigate social perception.  Thin-slice vision  Thin-slice vision refers to the accuracy with which observers are able to correctly identify imperceptible characteristics of a person after watching the individual alone or acting in a group for only a short amount of time.Weisbuch, M., & Ambady, N. (2010). Thin- slice vision. In R.B. Adams, N. Ambady, K. Nakayama, & S. Shimojo, The Science of Social Vision (pp. 228-247). New York: Oxford University Press. When examining thin-slice vision, researchers provide anywhere from thirty seconds to five minutes of recorded behavior to an observer who has no relationship with the recorded individual and no knowledge of the context of the recorded behavior. Thin-slice vision research has found that people are generally more accurate with inferences using visual elements of a scene alone rather than recordings that have both visual and auditory elements; therefore, it focuses exclusively on the use of visual stimuli.Ambady, N., & Rosenthal, R. (1992). Thin slices of expressive behavior as predictors of interpersonal consequences: A meta-analysis. Psychological Bulletin, 111, 256-274. In addition, observers tend to be just as accurate in correctly guessing information about an individual in short time segments such as fifteen seconds of perception as they are during longer segments such as fifteen minutes.Murphy, N.A. (2005). Using thin slices for behavioral coding. Journal of Nonverbal Behavior, 29, 235-246. As a result, thin-slice vision research is argued to be its own unique modality of social perception, separate from auditory perception and relying on very short time frames. = Individual characteristics = Research has consistently demonstrated that thin-slice vision leads to highly accurate perception of individual characteristics. When they were examining personality, observers were able to accurately assess men's extraversion, interpersonal warmth, and sociosexuality levels after they watched a short, silent clip of the men being interviewed.Gangestad, S. W., Simpson, J. A., DiGeronimo, K. & Biek, M. (1992). Differential accuracy in person perception across traits: Examination of a functional hypothesis. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 62, 688-698. In a different set of studies, observers watched a silent clip of a man entering an empty room, reading a weather report, and then exiting the room; yet they were highly accurate in assessing his masculinity, extraversion, conscientiousness, and neuroticism levels.Borkenau, P., & Liebler, A. (1993). Convergence of stranger ratings of personality and intelligence with self-ratings, partner ratings, and measured intelligence. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 65, 546-553. Additional research has replicated these results while additionally finding that life satisfaction was perceivable in these thin-slices as well.Yeagley, E., Morling, B., & Nelson, M. (2007). Nonverbal zero- acquaintance accuracy of self-esteem, social dominance orientation, and satisfaction with life. Journal of Research in Personality, 41, 1099-1106. One set of studies conducted in 2003 asked participants to view silenced clips of one minute or less depicting an individual engaging in an informal social interaction and found that observers were able to accurately assess the IQ of the observed person well above a chance.Murphy, N. A., Hall, J. A., & Colvin, C. R. (2003). Accurate intelligence assessments in social interactions: Mediators and gender effects. Journal of Personality, 71, 465-493. The relative power and status of employees in a company was additionally assessed with high accuracy by observers who were given a one-minute clip of the employees engaging in a puzzle task.Hall, J. A., & Friedman, G. B. (1999). Status, gender and nonverbal behavior: A study of structured interactions between employees of a company. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 25, 1082-1091.  Attitudes  Perhaps because of the significant social consequences of appearing prejudiced towards racial minorities,Blanchard, F. A., Lilly, T., & Vaghn, L. A. (1991). Condemning and condoning racism: A social context approach to interracial settings. Journal of Applied Psychology, 79, 993-997. objective observers are extremely accurate in assessing racial bias during silenced thin-slice clips. In one study, na√Øve judges were given twenty-second clips of a white subject interacting with either a white or black confederate, and observers were able to accurately assess racial bias as well as negative effect even when the clip did not include information about the race of the confederate that the subject was interacting with.Richeson, J. A., & Shelton, J. N. (2005). Thin slices of racial bias. Journal of Nonverbal Behavior, 29, 75-86. In another example of attitudes being quickly perceived in thin-slice videos, subjects were given ten-second silent clips of teachers giving a lecture to a classroom. After they watched the clip, observers stated how likely it is that the teacher would treat high-achieving and low-achieving students equally, and their ratings were positively correlated with the teacher's actual biases.Babad, E. (2005). Guessing teachers differential treatment of high- and low-achievers from thin slices of their lecturing behavior. Journal of Nonverbal Behavior, 29, 125-134. Raters who were given thin-slice silent clips of judges in court cases were also above-chance in guessing whether the judge personally believed the defendant was innocent or guilty based on watching said judge give the jury their final instructions at the end of the trial. Judges who believed the defendant would be found guilty were seen as less warm, competent, and wise in the clip while additionally appearing more anxious.Blanck, P. D., Rosenthal, R., & Cordell, L. D. H. (1985). The appearance of justice: Judges verbal and nonverbal behaviour in criminal jury trials. Stanford Law Review, 38, 89-164.  Mental health  Perceivers are highly reliable in correctly assessing mental health as well. For example, one meta-analysis found that perceivers were able to accurately and reliably estimate how much state- and trait- anxiety individuals possessed when provided clips of the individuals' silent behavior alone.Harrigan, J.A., Wilson, K., & Rosenthal, R. (2004). Detecting state and trait anxiety from auditory and visual cues: A meta-analysis. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 30, 56-66. In another study that presented observers with silenced admissions interviews at a psychiatric hospital, both experts and non-experts in mental health were correct in assessing whether patients did or did not suffer with depression 88% of the time on average.Waxer, P. H. (1974). Nonverbal cues for depression. Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 83, 319-322. In one set of studies researchers found that, while most personality disorders are not guessed accurately by observers in thin-slice exposures, observers were highly accurate in assessing avoidant, histrionic, and obsessive-compulsive personality disorders.Friedman, J. N. W., Oltmanns, T. F., Gleason, M. E. J., & Turkheimer, E. (2004). Mixed impressions: Reactions of strangers to people with pathological personality traits. Journal of Personality, 40, 395-410.  Relationships and sexuality  Despite the highly personal nature of sexuality, observers are able to reliably estimate the sexuality of strangers with relative ease. A series of studies in 1999 provided observers with silent clips that were either ten- seconds or one-second long in which heterosexual and homosexual subjects discussed their academic and extracurricular activities. Observers were well- above chance in correctly identifying which participants were heterosexual or homosexual and remained correct far above chance even when the videos were digitally degraded so that only the outlines of the individuals were presented.Ambady, N., Hallahan, M., & Conner, B. (1999). Accuracy of judgments of sexual orientation from thin slices of behavior. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 947-961. Another study examined perceptions of gait and their relationship to sexuality assessment. The researchers found that men who swayed their hips but did not swagger their shoulders while walking were significantly more likely to be categorized as homosexual by observers, and that over-all the observers who relied upon this information during thin-slice videos were more accurate than their peers in correctly guessing the sexuality of a recorded male walking.Johnson, K. L., Gill, S., Reichman, V., & Tassinary, L. G. (2007). Swagger, sway, and sexuality: Judging sexual orientation from body motion and morphology. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 93, 321-334. Observers are additionally accurate at assessing the socio-sexuality of individuals in silent thin-slice clips. In one study, observers were given silent thin-slice videos of people engaging in a first- date interview. These observers correctly identified to what degree said interviewees were socio-sexual, even when controlling for the physical attractiveness of the person being interviewed.Simpson, J. A., & Gangestad, S. W. (1991). Individual differences in sociosexuality: Evidence for convergent and discriminant validity. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 60, 870-883. Another set of studies found that observers were able to reliably judge how likely it was for a man to sexually harass women he encountered by showing the observers a short, silent clip that lasted less than three minutes of him being interviewed by an attractive woman.Craig, T. Y., Kelly, J. R., & Driscoll, D. (2001). Participant perceptions of potential employers. Sex Roles, 44, 389-400. Additional research has examined how reliably observers can estimate if individuals are in a romantic relationship. One set of studies provided na√Øve judges with fifteen-second silent clips of two individuals having a brief discussion side-by-side. Observers were able to reliably predict if the pair were friends, strangers, or involved romantically.Ambady, N., & Gray, H. M. (2002). On being sad and mistaken: Mood effects on the accuracy of thin-slice judgments. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 947-961. Another set of studies had observers examine silent thin- slice clips where two strangers were asked to plan a trip around the world together. Observers were able to reliably predict how close the two individuals felt by the end of the session.Grahe, J. E., & Bernieri, F. J. (1999). The importance of nonverbal cues in judging rapport. Journal of Nonverbal Behavior, 23, 253-269. When observers were given access to only transcripts, only auditory, or only visual information from the two strangers planning a trip, individuals that were provided silent thin-slice visual recordings remained the most accurate at judging the rapport of the strangers. = Predictiveness = Some of the most well-known research conducted in thin- slice vision involves the way thin-slice visual clips allow observers to reliably predict future behavior or efficacy in a variety of situations. These results range from the effectiveness of teachers during instruction to the future performance of health practitioners or likelihood of a crime being committed, all judged from silent clips.  Occupational efficacy  In a series of studies, silent thin-slice clips were found to be highly predictive of teacher effectiveness. In 1993, college and high school teachers were videotaped while teaching classes, and silent thin-slice videos of these lectures were provided to na√Øve judges. Observers were highly likely to agree on the perceived efficacy of a teacher or professor based on the thirty-second clips they were shown, and these ratings were strongly correlated with both student evaluations and supervisor evaluations of the teacher's efficacy in teaching the course.Ambady, N., & Rosenthal, R. (1993). Half a minute: Predicting teacher evaluations from thin slices of nonverbal behavior and physical attractiveness. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 64, 431-441. Another set of studies provided observers with fifteen-second thin- slice clips of occupational therapy students. Students who were rated poorly in the fifteen-second clips by na√Øve observers subsequently displayed poor clinical performance as well.Tickle-Degnen, L., & Puccinelli, N. M. (1999). The nonverbal expression of negative emotions: Peer and supervisor responses to occupational therapy students' emotional attributes. Occupational Therapy Journal of Research, 19, 18-29. An additional study provided observers with one-minute slices of silent behavior where physical therapists interacted with elderly patients. The more the observers rated the practitioners as distant, the less likely patients were able to pursue daily living activities such as bathing or walking after discharge.Ambady, N., Koo, J., Rosenthal, R., & Winograd, C. H. (2002). Physical therapists' nonverbal communication predicts geriatric patients' health outcomes. Psychology and Aging, 17, 443-452.  Behavior  Much of the behavior prediction research that has occurred in the thin-slice domain of social vision has been focused on the topic of criminal justice. One set of studies examining jury behavior examined silent thin-slice clips of trial judges reading final instructions to the jury. The more the observers rated the trial judge as dominant, the more likely they were to be accurate in predicting that jury would find the defendant innocent. Another set of studies examined the likelihood of a crime being committed based on a short, silent thin-slice clip. Videos were taken from closed- circuit television cameras; eighteen silent clips that led to a crime were matched with eighteen roughly similar clips that did not lead to a crime, and the beginning of these clips were shown to na√Øve judges. The observers were extremely reliable in stating which clips were leading to criminal behavior and which clips were not, with later analyses suggesting observers were able to detect future criminal behavior based on the gait and gesture of the individuals caught on film.Troscianko, T., Holmes, A., Stillman, J., Mirmehdi, M., Wright, D., & Wilson, A. (2004). What happens next? The predictability of natural behaviour viewed through CCTV cameras. Perception, 33, 87-101.  Body motion  Research on body motion in social vision focuses on what information perceivers are able to extract when seeing an individual move.Shiffrar, M., Kaiser, M. D., & Chouchourelou, A. (2010). Seeing Human Movement as Inherently Social. In R.B. Adams, N. Ambady, K. Nakayama, & S. Shimojo, The Science of Social Vision (pp. 248-263). New York: Oxford University Press. This research is primarily conducted by showing subjects point-light displays of human movement. The underlying premise of body motion research is that a large amount of social information is conveyed when a body is in motion, and the human visual system is fine-tuned to detect such social information. = Social perception =  Personality characteristics  Individuals have been able to correctly identify the identity of themselves and others in point-light displays.Cutting, J., & Kowzlowski, L. (1977). Recognizing friends by their walk: Gait perception without familiarity cues. Bulletin of the Psychonomic Society, 9, 353-356. They are also able to accurately guess an individual's psychological openness,Brownlow, S., Dixon, A. R., Egbert, C. A., & Radcliffe, R. D. (1997).

(2002). Victim selection and kinematics: A point- light investigation of vulnerability to attack. Journal of Nonverbal Behavior, 26, 129-158. Emotional state is reliably extracted from point-light displays as well. In one study, observers were provided a point-light display of only an arm knocking on a door yet were still able to reliably assess the emotional state of the individual who performed the knocking.Pollick, F. E., Kay, J. W., Heim, K., & Stringer, R. (2005). Gender recognition from point-light walkers. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception & Performance, 31, 1247-1265. The accuracy of perceiving emotion in point-light displays is additionally amplified when two or more individuals are presented in the display.Clarke, T.J., Bradshaw, M. F., Field, D. T., Hampson, S. E., & Rose, D. (2005). The perception of emotion from body movement in point-light displays of interpersonal dialogue. Perception, 34, 1171-1180.  Gender and sexuality  Body motion is highly diagnostic of sex category membership, and observers have proven to reliably identify the gender of a walker in a point-light display.Barclay, C., Cutting, J., & Kozlowski, L. (1978). Temporal and spatial factors in gait perception that influence gender recognition. Perception & Psychophysics, 23, 145-152. Untrained observers have additionally proven to be adept at assessing another person's reproductive fitness based on light display motion.Brown, W. M., Cronk, L., Grochow, K., Jacobson, A., Liu, C. K., et al. (2005). Dance reveals symmetry especially in young men. Nature, 438, 148-150. Overall, people are extremely adept at gender perception in body motion, even proving able to detect when point-light displays are attempting to deceive the observer about what gender a walker may be. In a classic study in 1983, individuals who were being recorded walking for point-light display videos were asked to walk in gender consistent and inconsistent ways. When the videos were played for observers, the subjects were able to easily detect when point-light displays were walking in gender inconsistent ways rather than categorizing the point-light display as the gender the walk was mimicking.Runeson, S., & Frykholm, G. (1983). Kinematic specification of dynamics as an informational bias for person-and-action perception: Expectation, gender recognition, and deceptive intent. Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 112, 585-615. Researchers suggest that because men's and women's bodies differ biologically, body motion is also likely to vary accordingly.Mather, G., & Murdoch, L. (1994). Gender discrimination in biological motion displays based on dynamic cues. Proceedings of the Royal Society of London: Biological Sciences, 258, 273-279. People have also proven to be highly reliable at detecting an individual's sexual orientation from dynamic motion in point-light displays as well. = Detection errors = Body motion research in social vision relies on the underlying theory that quickly and reliably perceiving body motion is vital for successful social interactions. However, this leads to the prediction that difficulty in social interaction may be in part due to the inability to read body motion accurately. Research has verified this result using Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), showing that individuals with ASD have unique challenges when perceiving body motion as compared to controls.Moore, D. G., Hobson, R. P., & Lee, A. (1997). Components of person perception: An investigation with autistic, non-autistic retarded and typically developing children and adolescents. British Journal of Developmental Psychology, 15, 401-423. Researchers found that children with ASD showed significant delays in recognizing point-light displays, as moving people and were much less likely to describe the emotional state of people being portrayed in point-light displays, with both results also being replicated among a population with Asperger's Syndrome.Hubert, B., Wicker, B., Moore, D. G., Monfardini, E., Duverger, H., Da Fonseca, D., et al. (2007). Recognition of emotional and non- emotional biological motion in individuals with autistic spectrum disorders. Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 37, 1386-1392. These results have been used to argue that body motion is indeed a significant source of information in social behavior.

During the Second World War, it served in the air defence and medium artillery roles at home and in the Far East. Its successor unit continues to serve as a battery in the modern Army Reserve. Volunteer Force The enthusiasm for the Volunteer movement following an invasion scare in 1859 saw the creation of many Volunteer Corps composed of part-time soldiers eager to supplement the Regular British Army in time of need.Beckett.Spiers, pp. 163‚Äì8. One such unit was the 15th Lancashire Artillery Volunteer Corps (AVC) of two batteries, which was formed at Garston, Liverpool, on 2 April 1860, with additional batteries raised on 2 July 1863 and 16 November 1865.Frederick, p. 664.Litchfield & Westlake, pp. 107‚Äì13.Beckett, Appendix VIII.Lancashire Record Office, Handlist 72. The first officers commissioned into the unit included two Captains (one for each battery), with the senior, Philip Tinne, as Captain-Commandant.London Gazette, 2 April 1860. One of the First Lieutenants, John Mewburn, was formerly of the Queen's Own Canadian Militia. He was promoted to captain on 20 November 1860,London Gazette, 4 December 1860. and became captain-commandant in April 1862.London Gazette, 29 April 1862. By 1865 he was a Major.Army List, various dates. Although the smaller Lancashire AVCs were grouped together into administrative battalions, the 15th remained independent, although between 1863 and 1867 it was attached to the Manchester- based 19th Lancashire AVC for administrative purposes. As the unit expanded, Mewburn was superseded in command by the local linen merchant Robert Trimble, who joined from the Liverpool Irish and had financed the raising of the third battery. Obituary, Hawera and Normanby Star (New Zealand), 5 September 1899. Trimble was commissioned lieutenant in the 15th Lancashire AVC on 13 December 1862,London Gazette, 26 December 1862. promoted to captain on 2 July 1863,London Gazette, 21 July 1863. and became Lieutenant-Colonel in command. Mewburn returned to the command with the rank of Lt-Col on 23 February 1875 after Trimble resigned to emigrate to New Zealand,London Gazette, 16 February 1875. whereupon Trimble became the first Honorary Colonel of the unit.London Gazette 13 July 1875. Mewburn retired on 19 April 1890.London Gazette, 18 April 1890. and H.J. Robinson, VD, later succeeded as Lt-Col in command (11 May 1892). The unit established its headquarters (HQ) at Lark Lane, Liverpool, in 1877, and moved to 65 Admiral Street by 1880. When the Volunteers were consolidated in 1880, the unit was redesignated the 6th Lancashire AVC (the original 6th had been disbanded in 1863), with the following organisation: * No 1 Battery at Liverpool * No 2 Battery at Liverpool * No 3 Battery at Liverpool * No 4 Battery at Garston * Half Battery at Hale * No 5 Battery By the end of 1880 the unit had reached a strength of nine batteries. In 1882 it was assigned to the Lancashire Division of the Royal Artillery, but when the divisional structure was reduced in 1889 it joined the Southern Division.Litchfield & Westlake, pp. 4‚Äì5. The AVCs were intended to serve as garrison artillery manning fixed defences, but a number of the early units manned semi-mobile 'position batteries' of smooth-bore field guns pulled by agricultural horses. However, the War Office (WO) refused to pay for the upkeep of field guns and the concept died out in the 1870s. It was revived in 1888 when some Volunteer batteries were reorganised as 'position artillery' to work alongside the Volunteer infantry brigades. From 14 July 1892 the 6th Lancashire Volunteer Artillery had an establishment of one position bty and seven garrison companies, but by 1893 consisted entirely of position batteries, referred to as 'heavy batteries' from 1902.Litchfield & Westlake, p. 6. On 1 June 1899 all the Volunteer artillery units became part of the Royal Garrison Artillery (RGA) and from 1 January 1902 when the RA's divisional structure was abolished, the unit became the 6th Lancashire Royal Garrison Artillery (Volunteers). Lieutenant-Colonel W.W. Gossage, VD, took over the command in 1904. Territorial Force When the Volunteers were subsumed into the new Territorial Force (TF) under the Haldane Reforms of 1908,Dunlop, Chapter 14.Spiers, Chapter 10. the 6th Lancashire transferred to the Royal Field Artillery (RFA) as the 3rd West Lancashire Brigade, with the following organisation:Frederick, p. 677.Litchfield, pp. 125‚Äì7.London Gazette 20 March 1908. * HQ at 65 Admiral Street, Liverpool * 12th Lancashire Battery at Admiral Street * 13th Lancashire Battery at 1 Earp Street, Garston * 14th Lancashire Battery at Widnes * 3rd Lancashire Ammunition Column at Admiral Street It formed part of the TF's West Lancashire Division, and each battery was equipped with four BLC 15-pounder guns.Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 133‚Äì9.55 (WL) Division at Long, Long Trail. First World War =Mobilisation= BLC 15-pounder gun issued to TF field brigades Annual training had just begun when war was declared on 4 August 1914, and the units returned to their peace stations to mobilise. 3rd West Lancashire Brigade mobilised at Admiral Street under the command of Lt-Col J.P. Reynolds, CO since 1909.Coop, p. 12. Immediately after the outbreak of war, TF units were invited to volunteer for Overseas Service, and on 15 August the War Office issued instructions to separate those men who had signed up for Home Service only, and form them into reserve units. On 31 August, the formation of a reserve or 2nd Line unit was authorised for each 1st Line unit where 60 per cent or more of the men had volunteered for Overseas Service. The titles of these 2nd Line units would be the same as the original, but distinguished by a '2/' prefix. In this way duplicate brigades, batteries and divisions were created, mirroring those TF formations being sent overseas.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 1‚Äì7. =1/3rd West Lancashire Brigade, RFA= 18-pounder gun preserved at the Imperial War Museum. During the winter of 1914‚Äì15 the infantry of the West Lancashire Division were sent to reinforce the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) fighting on the Western Front. In April 1915 the artillery and other divisional units remaining at home were attached to the 2nd West Lancashire Division, which was training round Canterbury and whose own artillery did not join until September.57 (2nd WL) Division at Long, Long Trail. In September 1915 the brigade was re- equipped with modern 18-pounder guns, handing its old guns over to the 2nd Line, and it sailed for the Western Front with 2nd Canadian Division. It completed disembarkation at Le Havre on 1 October and moved up to Locre and Berthen. The Lancashire RFA brigades were only with the Canadians for a short time, because in November the War Office decided to re-form the 1st West Lancashire Division (as the 55th (West Lancashire) Division). The 3rd West Lancashire Bde joined the reformed division at Hallencourt on 4 January 1916.Coop, p. 23. 4.5-inch howitzer preserved at the Royal Artillery Museum. In May 1916 the BEF's field artillery underwent reorganisation. First, on 5 May, the 3rd West Lancashire formed a fourth 4-gun battery, designated D. Then on 15 May the other three batteries were redesignated A, B and C, and the brigade became CCLXXVII (or 277) Brigade, RFA. The brigade ammunition columns were absorbed into the divisional ammunition column on 18 May. Finally, on 23 May, D Bty was swapped with C (H) Bty of CCLXXVIII (H) Brigade (the former 4th West Lancashire (Howitzer) Brigade, though C/CCLXXVIII Bty was originally a Kitchener's Army battery from 18th (Eastern) DivisionBecke, Pt 3a, pp. 79‚Äì85.18 (E) Division at Long, Long Trail.). This battery became D (H), armed with 4.5-inch howitzers.Coop, pp. 28‚Äì9.Frederick, p. 689. Somme Once assembled, 55th (West Lancashire) Division went into the line in the Wailly‚ÄìBretancourt area. When the Battle of the Somme opened further south on 1 July, the divisional artillery fired an intense bombardment along its whole divisional front as a diversion. The division was then relieved on 25 July, when it moved south into the line opposite Guillemont in the Somme sector.Coop, pp. 25, 30. On 8 August, two infantry brigades of the division carried out an attack on Guillemont. For the whole of the previous day and up to Zero hour (04.20) on 8 August, the divisional artillery and heavy guns kept up a continuous bombardment (described as 'awe-inspiring') of the enemy positions, particularly Guillemont village, which was known to be strongly fortified. When the infantry advanced they were preceded by a creeping barrage (a new technique at the time) fired by the divisional artillery supported by other batteries. The attack on the right was successful, and at 05.20 the infantry on the left were reported to be in Guillemont Station, but the centre was held up by a belt of barbed wire and the barrage had to be brought back to support them. Meanwhile, the Liverpool Irish held on the village until most were killed or captured. The attack was renewed the following day with another barrage commencing at 04.20 and making its first 'lift' forward at 04.23. However, the leading battalion was unable to get into position until 05.00, and then made a gallant attack without the benefit of the barrage, suffering heavy casualties.Coop. pp. 31‚Äì5.Farndale, Western Front, p. 150. The division was relieved on the night of 14/15 August, but the divisional artillery remained in the line supporting other formations. 55th (West Lancashire) Division came back into the line on 4/5 September, facing Ginchy and Delville Wood, where it launched an attack on 9 September (in the Battle of Ginchy). The divisional and heavy artillery began a deliberate bombardment at 07.00 and continued to Zero hour (16.45), when the field artillery fired a creeping barrage behind which the infantry advanced. The German artillery replied to the bombardment by shelling the support trenches and firing gas shells into the battery positions. The leading infantry companies followed the barrage closely and attacked 'Hop Alley', 'Ale Alley' and 'Pint Trench', but Hop Alley proved stronger than expected and there was an additional hidden trench that had not been discovered or bombarded. The rest of the divisional attack was successful, and another attempt on the Hop Alley‚ÄìAle Alley complex was made two days later by a surprise attack without artillery preparation, which was also unsuccessful.Coop. pp. 35‚Äì40. After a short rest the 55th (West Lancashire) Lancashire Division was thrown in again at the Battle of Morval on 25 September. The infantry attacked at 12.35, keeping closer to the creeping barrage than ever before, and the first phase of the attack was successful. The captured position was consolidated behind a standing barrage, and then the barrage moved on and the infantry captured the second objective. Next day the success was exploited towards 'Gird Trench' and 'Gird Support' after a seven- hour bombardment. The Liverpool Irish took the objectives by 15.15 and the retreating Germans were caught by the barrage and suffered heavily. A counter- attack attempt at 15.50 was also caught in the open by the artillery and the German infantry fled from the guns. The division was relieved on 28 September and left the Somme front.Coop, pp. 41‚Äì44.Farndale, Western Front, p. 152. Army Field Brigade In October there was another reorganisation of the field artillery to bring the 18-pounder batteries up to a strength of six guns each. On 4 October, A Bty was split up between B and C, and on 7 October it was replaced by B/CCLXXVIII Bty. On 18 January 1917 the brigade left 55th Division and became an Army Field Brigade (AFA).'Allocations of Army Brigades, RH & RFA', The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 95/5494/2.Farndale, Western Front, Annex D. The recently joined A Bty left again and was replaced by A/CLXXIX Bty (from 179th (Deptford) Brigade, RFA, of 39th (Deptford) Divisional Artillery). D (H) Bty was brought up to 6-gun strength by Right Section from D (H)/CLXXIX. 39th Division was a 'Pals' formation whose artillery had been recruited by the mayor and Corporation of Deptford from Deptford and Lee Green in East London.Becke, Pt 3b, pp. 91‚Äì100.39 Division at Long, Long Trail. * A Bty (6 x 18-pounders) ‚Äì originally A/CLXXIX from Lee Green * B Bty (6 x 18-pounders) ‚Äì originally 13th Lancashire Bty + half 12th Lancashire Bty * C Bty (6 x 18-pounders) ‚Äì originally 14th Lancashire Bty + half 12th Lancashire Bty * D (H) Bty (6 x 4.5-inch howitzers) ‚Äì originally 266 (H) Bty from Eastern England + R Section of D (H)/CLXXIX from Deptford Ypres At first the brigade was attached to VIII Corps supporting 55th and 39th Divisions. Then on 28 May it moved to X Corps for the Battle of Messines (7 June) when it fired in support of 41st Division. The field artillery were allocated 1000 rounds per gun for 18-pounders and 750 rounds for 4.5-inch howitzers, together with large amounts of gas and smoke shells. The guns and all this ammunition were assembled in secrecy, the AFAs moving into the area a battery at a time over a long period, though some were subjected to German counter-battery (CB) fire. The battle is remembered for the explosion of massive mines, but after that it was fundamentally an artillery battle, with two-thirds of the 18-pounders firing a creeping barrage ahead of the attacking infantry, the remainder and the 4.5s firing standing barrages beyond that. These barrages were practised on 3 and 5 June. At Zero on 7 June, after the mines had been fired, the infantry advanced behind their barrage with little opposition. Local counter-attacks were destroyed by the creeping and standing barrages. Later in the day the field batteries began to move forward across the shattered No man's land to bring the further objectives into range.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 184‚Äì91. Gunners digging an 18-pounder out of the mud near Zillebeke, 9 August 1917. CCLCCVII AFA left X Corps on 8 July and moved to II Corps supporting 8th Division to prepare for the Third Ypres Offensive. Once again there was a massive concentration of guns and ammunition: for this assault there was one 18-pounder for every of the attacking front. On II Corps' front the guns were hidden close-packed behind woods between Zillebeke and Verbrandemolen. The artillery duel went on for several weeks before the attack, with British batteries taking heavy casualties from German CB fire and gas shelling. The offensive opened on 31 July with the Battle of Pilckem Ridge, the infantry advancing behind the biggest barrage programme yet devised. Despite setbacks ‚Äì II Corps suffering the worst hold-up in front of Westhoek on the Gheluveldt Plateau and losing the barrage ‚Äì a general advance of was achieved, but by evening rain was falling heavily and it proved almost impossible to move the guns and ammunition up through the mud. Gun detachments became exhausted and the bombardment for the next phase attack had to be postponed.Becke, Pt 1, p. 95.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 195‚Äì204.Heinz Hagenlucke, 'The German High Command', in Liddle (ed), p. 51.Wolff, pp. 155‚Äì63. The brigade came under the orders of 25th Division for the Capture of Westhoek on 10 August and then of 18th (Eastern) Division for the Battle of Langemarck on 16‚Äì18 August. The time for preparation had been too short and the artillery plan for Langemarcke was not a success.Becke, Pt 3a, pp. 85, 141.Farndale, Western Front, p. 204.Ashley Ekins, 'The Australians at Passchendaele', in Liddle (ed), p. 232.John Lee, 'The British Divisions at Third Ypres', in Liddle (ed), p. 217.Frank E. Vandiver, 'Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig and Passchendaele', in Liddle (ed), p. 37. After a spell back under 8th Division, the brigade was withdrawn for rest on 25 August. It moved to IX Corps on 9 September, supporting 19th (Western) Division in the more successful series of set-piece battles at the Menin Road Ridge (20‚Äì25 September), Polygon Wood (26 September‚Äì3 October), and Broodseinde (4 October), followed by the failures at Poelcappelle (9 October) and the First Battle of Passchendaele (12 October). The earlier battles were marked by effective artillery support, but later the strain of bringing guns and ammunition up through the mud, casualties suffered, and the unstable gun platforms leading to inaccuracy, led to this support falling away as the campaign developed. At First Passchendale the 18th Division advanced scarcely .Becke, Pt 3a, p. 93.Ekins in Liddle (ed), pp. 233‚Äì43.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 205‚Äì12.Lee in Liddle (ed), pp. 219‚Äì22.Wolff, pp. 191‚Äì4, 198-9, 207-8, 222‚Äì35, 249‚Äì51. Cambrai After Passchendaele, CCLXXVII Bde was withdrawn to rest for the remainder of the month, then spent the first half of November in a quiet sector with 46th (North Midland) Division in I Corps before moving to support 12th (Eastern) Division in III Corps for the Battle of Cambrai. As with Messines, the first phase of this battle was an artillery victory thanks to massive and well-planned preparation and tactics, though in this case the element of surprise was provided by the first mass use of tanks and the guns were silent until Zero hour on 20 November. Behind its tanks and barrage (one third smoke shell, one third Shrapnel shell, and one-third high explosive (HE)), 12th Division took its objectives of Bonavis Rdge, Gonnelieu Ridge and Lateau Wood. The barrage was fired according to plan, with two successive lifts (rather than creeping) to Lateau Trench, then falling behind Bonavis Farm (leaving the buildings for the heavy guns) and finally providing a protective barrage beyond the Brown Line (the second objective). The guns were then moved forwards.Becke, Pt 3a, p. 33.Cooper, pp. 63‚Äì4, 96, 111, 115.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 216‚Äì23. After its initial success, the battle bogged down into bitter fighting round Bourlon Wood, during which 12th Division was largely inactive. The Germans were preparing a major counter- offensive, and on 29 November III Corps assigned HQ, A and D (H) Btys of CCLXXVII Bde to support 6th Division. Both divisions were caught up in the counter-attack that came on 30 November, when the Germans penetrated behind 12th Division to Gonnelieu and III Corps lost 12 18-pounders and other guns. Desperate defence continued for several days, with the British withdrawing to a stronger line on 5 December.Cooper, pp. 167‚Äì70, 177‚Äì8, 192‚Äì3.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 249‚Äì57. Spring Offensive On 8 December the brigade was reunited and transferred to 16th (Irish) Division in VII Corps, with which it stayed during the winter, apart from a period of rest for most of January 1918. When the German Spring Offensive opened on 21 March 1918, the salient held by 16th Division was quickly overrun and the survivors tried to make a stand round Ronssoy. The field guns were in gun pits and could neither be swung to meet close threats, nor easily withdrawn, although some were removed at the trot by their horse teams. Although their observation posts (OPs) were virtually blinded by the mist and their communication links cut by shellfire, many batteries continued firing until overrun. Of the division's own two field brigades, and the two AFAs attached to it (including CCLXXVIII), only six 18-pounders and 4.5-inch howitzers were got away as the Great Retreat began.Blaxland, pp. 46‚Äì7, 57, 64.Farndale, Western Front, p. 264.Middlebrook, pp. 209‚Äì12, 224‚Äì5 237.Murland, pp. 91‚Äì7. By 27 March, 16th Division had been transferred to XIX Corps and had received some replacement guns, so that its own two field brigades and CCLXXVIII fielded 60 guns between them. The division made a stand at Proyart but was driven out by the heavy attacks made that day, some of the field batteries remaining in action until the enemy were only away. 16th (Irish) Division was pulled out of the line on 3 April, but its guns remained to cover 14th (Light) Division.Becke, Pt 2a, p. 69.Blaxland, pp. 89‚Äì92.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 273‚Äì6.Murland, p. 187. 14th Division came under heavy attack on 4 April (the Battle of the Avre) and fell back about , but then the enemy were stopped dead by the artillery. All the batteries had been shelled heavily with HE and gas during the preliminary bombardment, and again the OPs were blinded by mist. When the German bombardment shifted to the infantry's front line trenches at 06.20, the field batteries responded by firing their pre-planned 'SOS' tasks blindly into the mist. About 11.00 the mist began to clear and the OPs brought down shrapnel fire on the massed German infantry with devastating effects. But they still came on and the commander, Royal Artillery (CRA), of 14th Division issued the order that 'This attack can and must be stopped by artillery fire. If any battery can no longer effectively stop the enemy from its present position, it will at once move fighting to a position on the crest, to engage the enemy over open sights. It is essential that the artillery should hold the line and they will do so'. As the RA historian comments, the order was obeyed: one gun of C/CCXXLVII AFA Bde 'stood in the open for two hours with no pause in its firing, and lived to tell the tale. D Battery of the same brigade smothered attack after attack with a pile of lethal gas shell which it found dumped'. All afternoon 14th Division's guns fought on until at 15.30 the enemy had withdrawn, and the CRA was able to order 'cease firing' after 10 hours continuous fighting, the guns having fired about 500 rounds each. CCLXXVII AFA brigade was itself pulled out to refit on 6 April.Blaxland, p. 104.Farndale, Western Front, pp. 276‚Äì8. On 22 April the brigade went back into the line, attached to 56th (1st London) Division near Arras. There were no major actions, but normal trench warfare bombardments and support for small trench raids continued. On 15 July the Canadian Corps took over the sector and CCLXXVIII Bde transferred to the command of 1st Canadian Division and later 4th Canadian Division.Dudley Ward, pp. 246‚Äì252. Hundred Days Offensive On 31 July the brigade joined 52nd (Lowland) Division, newly arrived from the Palestine, which went into the line north-east of Arras.Becke, Pt 2a, p. 115. Then on 14 August, as the Allied Hundred Days Offensive was getting under way, it rejoined 8th Division in VIII Corps, supporting it in the Battle of the Scarpe (26‚Äì30 August). It stayed with VIII during the autumn battles in Artois, supporting 20th (Light) Division's patrol actions from 2 to 8 October,Becke, Pt 3a, p. 101.Edmnds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 128‚Äì30. 50th (Northumbrian) Division from 8 to 13 October (including the Second Battle of Cambrai and the pursuit to the Selle)Becke, Pt 2a, p. 100. and then from 13 October back to the 12th (Eastern) Division as it established a bridgehead across the Scheldt on 28 October. When 12th Division was relieved on 3 November the brigade briefly went back to 52nd Division before moving to 63rd (Royal Naval) Division in XXII Corps for the Passage of the Grand Honnelle behind a massive barrage on 7 November. 63rd (RN) Division was advancing rapidly when the Armistice with Germany came into force on 11 November.Becke, Pt 3b, p. 128.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 512, 525‚Äì6, 535, 553. After the war CCLXXVII Brigade was demobilised in 1919. =2/3rd West Lancashire Brigade, RFA= Training for the 2/3rd West Lancashire Brigade was seriously delayed by lack of arms and equipment. Finally, in June 1915 it received two obsolete 15-pounder Mk I guns (without sights). In September 1915 it was designated CCLXXXVII (or 287th) Brigade, reorganised into A, B, C (H) and D (H) Btys. It moved from Weeton Camp in Lancashire to join 57th (2nd WL) Division at Canterbury where it took over BLC 15-pounders and BL 5-inch howitzers from the 1st Line. Now serious training could begin. In December the divisional artillery received its first 18-pounders, and in January 1916 the 4.5-inch howitzers arrived. Until the middle of 1916, 57th (2nd WL) Division formed part of Second Army, Central Force, in home defence. By July it had transferred to the emergency reserves and moved into Aldershot Command's area in Hampshire. On 5 January 1917 the War Office ordered it to France, embarkation beginning on 6 February. CCLXXXVII Brigade, consisting of two 6-gun 18-pounder batteries (A and B) and two 4-gun howitzer batteries (C (H) and D (H)), disembarked at Le Havre on 9 February, but it was immediately broken up. Batteries and sections were distributed to brigades within 57th (2nd WL), 59th (2nd North Midland) and 66th (2nd East Lancashire) Divisions and to AFAs. Brigade HQ joined 57th Divisional Ammunition Column on 20 February and the brigade ceased to exist. Interwar After the war 3rd West Lancashire Brigade was reformed in 55th (West Lancashire) Infantry Division in 1920, but with its batteries renumbered 9th‚Äì12th Lancashire Btys. When the TF was reorganised as the Territorial Army (TA) in 1921, the brigade was redesignated 89th (3rd West Lancashire) Brigade, RFA (then as a 'Field Brigade, RA', when the RFA was subsumed into the Royal Artillery (RA) in 1924) and with batteries renumbered again:Frederick, p. 523.Titles & Designations, 1927. * 353 (12th West Lancashire) Bty at Liverpool * 354 (13th West Lancashire) Bty at Garston * 355 (14th West Lancashire) Bty at Widnes * 356 (27th West Lancashire) Bty (Howitzer) at Liverpool =70th (3rd West Lancashire) HAA Regiment= In the late 1930s the need for improved anti- aircraft (AA) defences for Britain's cities became apparent, and a programme of converting existing TA units was pushed forward. In October 1937 89th Field Brigade became 70th (3rd West Lancashire) Anti-Aircraft Brigade, RA ('Anti- Aircraft Regiment' from 1 January 1939) with the following organisation:Frederick, pp. 755‚Äì9, 773.70 HAA Rgt at RA 1939‚Äì45. * HQ at Tramway Road, Aigburth, Liverpool * 211 (13th West Lancashire) AA Bty at Tramway Road, Aigburth, Liverpool * 212 (27th West Lancashire) AA Bty at Tramway Road, Aigburth, Liverpool * 216 (14th West Lancashire) AA Bty at Peel House Lane, Widnes * 225 (12th West Lancashire) Light AA Bty at Tramway Road, Aigburth, Liverpool * 267 (Wirral) AA Bty raised at Birkenhead November 1938 * 309 AA Bty raised at Bootle on 1 April 1939 The Tramway Road drill hall was shared with the Lancashire Fortress Royal Engineers. By the outbreak of war, 267 (Wirral) AA Bty had left to become the cadre for a new 93rd AA Regiment at Birkenhead, raised from the shipping, insurance and bank offices in Liverpool. This regiment later served in the Faroe Islands and the Middle East. Similarly, 225 Light AA Bty provided the cadre of a new 25th Light AA Rgt in Liverpool. This regiment later served in North Africa, Sicily and North West Europe.Frederick, pp. 803, 824.Litchfield, pp. 32, 131. Second World War =Mobilisation and Phoney War= The TA's AA units were mobilised on 23 September 1938 during the Munich Crisis, with units manning their emergency positions within 24 hours, even though many did not yet have their full complement of men or equipment. The emergency lasted three weeks, and they were stood down on 13 October.Routledge, pp. 62‚Äì3. In February 1939 the existing AA defences came under the control of a new Anti-Aircraft Command. In June, as the international situation worsened, a partial mobilisation of the TA was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each AA unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected AA gun and searchlight positions. On 24 August the whole of AA Command was fully mobilised, ahead of the declaration of war.Routledge, pp. 65‚Äì6, 371. 70th (3rd West Lancs) AA Rgt mobilised at Liverpool in 33rd (Western) Anti-Aircraft Brigade, also based at Liverpool. It formed part of 4th AA Division.AA Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot FilesRoutledge, Table LX, p. 378. At this point the Gun Defended Area (GDA) around Liverpool had a strength of just 19 Heavy AA (HAA) guns (3-inch, 3.7-inch and 4.5-inch), plus three guns out of action.Routledge, Table LVIII, p. 376; Table LIX p. 377. During the period of the Phoney War, the AA defences of NW England were not tested in action, and the time was spent in equipping and training the TA units. In June 1940, the Royal Artillery's AA Regiments were redesignated Heavy AA (HAA) to distinguish them from the new Light AA (LAA) regiments being formed. By the start of the Battle of Britain, in July 1940, the number of HAA guns deployed in the Liverpool GDA had reached 52.Farndale, p. 106.Collier, Appendix IX. The first Luftwaffe attack on Liverpool came on 28 August, and there were a number of raids thereafter.Collier, Chapter XIII.Collier, Chapter XVI.Collier, Appendix XIV.Collier, Appendix XV. =The Blitz= Victoria Monument in foreground, the burned-out shell of the Custom House in middle distance Another panoramic view, looking towards the River Mersey When the nightly bombing of Britain's cities The Blitz began in September 1940, 70th (3rd West Lancs) HAA Rgt was in 33 AA Bde covering Liverpool, and by the time it ended in May 1941 had transferred to 44 AA Bde covering Manchester.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 12 May 1941, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/79. The cities of NW England were heavily bombed during the winter of 1940‚Äì41 (the Liverpool Blitz and Manchester Blitz) and 'the actions fought [by the AA batteries] were as violent, dangerous and prolonged as any in the field'. 'On an HAA 4.5-inch position of 44th AA Brigade in Manchester, the power rammer on one gun failed. One Gunner loaded 127 of the 86-lb [40 kg] rounds himself in eleven hours of action, despite injuries to his fingers'. As the night raids continued into the Spring, Liverpool and its docks along the Mersey became the most heavily bombed area of Britain outside London, with particularly heavy attacks in December 1940 (the Christmas Blitz); in April 1941; and again the following month (the May Blitz).Routledge, pp. 394‚Äì5.Liverpool Bitz at History of LiverpoolCollier, Chapter XVII.Collier, Appendix XXX. The regiment sent a cadre to 209th HAA Training Rgt at Blandford Camp to provide the basis for a new 399 Bty; this was formed on 12 December 1940 and later joined 98th HAA Rgt. The regiment sent another cadre to 209th HAA Training Rgt for a new 479 (Mixed) HAA Bty; this was formed on 11 September 1941 but was disbanded on 8 October. In the summer of 1941 the regiment was reorganised. On 20 August 309 HAA Bty left to provide an experienced cadre for a newly-formed 128th HAA Rgt and was replaced in 70th (3rd West Lancs) by 434 HAA Bty, which had been formed on 12 June 1941 at the AA training centre at Oswestry, partly from the personnel of 254 and 259 LAA Btys, which had been disbanded. Mobile 3.7-inch HAA gun preserved at Imperial War Museum Duxford. As the flow of new AA units from the training centres continued, experienced units began to be prepared for overseas service, and 70th (3rd West Lancs) was one of those chosen in early 1942. The establishment of an HAA Rgt in the field was only three batteries, so on 13 March, 434 HAA Bty transferred to 108th HAA Rgt in the Orkney and Shetland Defences. Then 70th HAA embarked for India with 211, 212 and 216 HAA Btys. =India= The regiment arrived at Bombay on 11 May 1942, and RHQ with 211 and 212 HAA Btys made the journey across India to Madras, leaving 216 HAA Bty at Bombay. On 26 July, RHQ and 211 HAA Bty returned to Bombay, leaving 212 HAA Bty occupying the Island site at Madras under the command of 3rd Indian AA Bde. The regiment and its batteries continued to move around India's cities: on 6 December RHQ and 216 HAA Bty went to Asansol where they came under the command of 2nd Indian AA Bde, then on 27 March 1943 they went to Calcutta where they came under 1st Indian AA Bde and 212 HAA Bty rejoined. By April 1943, the regiment was back under 3 Indian AA Bde at Bombay while 216 HAA Bty was with 1 Indian AA Bde in the Calcutta area.Joslen, p. 520.Farndale, Far East, Annex K.Routledge, Table XXXVII, pp. 252‚Äì3. HAA gun in action in Burma Calcutta was raided regularly during the winter of 1942‚Äì43, as was the supply base at Chittagong when British forces advanced int the Arakan in December 1942. This offensive was a failure, but British forces continued to build up for the eventual reconquest of Burma. On 5 June 1943, 211 HAA Bty was sent up from Bombay to Chittagong, where it was joined by the rest of the regiment on 10 November, coming under the command of 13 AA Bde in time for Fourteenth Army's renewed offensive.Routledge, pp. 237‚Äì9.Woodburn Kirby, Vol II, pp. 259‚Äì60. By early 1944 the Japanese air threat to Fourteenth Army's communications was greatly reduced. On 14 May 1944 the regiment moved back to India, coming under 101 Lines of Communication (LoC) area at Piska in Ranchi district, and then via Ratu and Jubbulpore to Poona by 20 July. A manpower crisis in South East Asia Command was leading to a reduction in AA units, with many of the gunners being sent for infantry training. Between June and August 1944 the regiment was disbanded and the remaining personnel were reduced to battery strength and converted to become the 70th (West Lancashire) Medium Battery (also absorbing some personnel from 202 HAA Bty of 56th (Cornwall) HAA Rgt). The converted battery joined a newly formed 'C' Medium Regiment, designated 87th Medium Rgt from 18 August. The regiment was commanded by Lt- Col R.J. Kirton of 70th HAA Rgt. The other battery was formed by 63rd (Northumbrian) HAA Rgt.Frederick, p. 740.Joslen, p 513.Farndale, Years of Defeat, Annex M.Routledge, p. 244; Table XXXIX, p. 255.87 Med Rgt at RA 1939‚Äì45. =70th (3rd West Lancashire) Medium Battery= 5.5-inch guns of 87th Medium Regiment firing in 1945. Equipped with 5.5-inch guns, the new regiment was initially under the command of 9 AA Bde at Poona, then at Secunderabad. At the end of December, it returned to Ranchi, the base of operations for the Burma Campaign, under 101 LoC area. In late March 1945, the regiment moved up through Gauhati and came under the command of the 256th LoC Sub Area when it reached Kohima on 30 March. Here, 63 Med Bty was detached from the regiment and moved independently into Burma. The rest of the regiment, with 70 (3rd West Lancs) Bty, moved to Dimapur under 202 LoC Area by the end of May. Here it was run down further, some of the personnel probably transferring to 160th Field Rgt. Although 87th Med Rgt was officially still in existence when the war ended in August 1945, 70th Med Bty had been placed in suspended animation Postwar When the TA was reconstituted o 1 Januaryn 1947, the regiment was reformed at Aigburth as 470th (3rd West Lancashire) HAA Rgt.Frederick, pp. 1016‚Äì7.444‚Äì473 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on. The regiment formed part of 79 AA Bde (the wartime 53 AA Bde) at Woolton, Liverpool, in 4 AA Group at Warrington.Routledge, Table LXXIV, p. 441.Litchfield, Appendix 5.Watson, TA 1947.67‚Äì106 AA Bdes at British Army 1945 on. When AA Command was disbanded in 1955, there was a significant reduction in the number of AA units in the TA: 470th HAA Rgt merged with two other Liverpool-based units, 525th LAA Rgt (descended from 25th LAA to which the old 70th had contributed a cadre in 1939, see above), and 626th (Liverpool Irish) HAA Rgt, and was reorganised as 470th (3rd West Lancashire) LAA Regiment in 2nd Army Group Royal Artillery (AA).Routledge, Table LXXV, p. 442.AGRAs at British Army 1945 onwards. with the following organisation: * RHQ and P Btys ‚Äì from 470th HAA Rgt * Q Liverpool Irish Bty ‚Äì from 626th HAA Rgt * R Bty ‚Äì from 525th LAA Rgt In 1961 the regiment absorbed the technically trained personnel of 855 (Essex Fortress) AA Control and Reporting Bty, and in 1964 the designation was changed from 'Light Anti-Aircraft' to 'Light Air Defence'. When the TA was reduced into the TAVR in 1967, the regiment was amalgamated with 252nd (The Manchester Artillery) Field Rgt and 253rd (The Bolton Artillery) Field Rgt to form 103rd (Lancashire Artillery Volunteers) Rgt, RA, in which the '3rd West Lancs' heritage is continued by 208 (3rd West Lancashire) Bty. In 1973, 208 (3rd West Lancs) Bty absorbed the cadre of the former West Lancashire Regiment, RA, which represented the lineage of the 1st and 4th West Lancashire Artillery, the Lancashire Hussars, Liverpool Scottish, and Liverpool Rifles. Honorary Colonels The following served as Honorary Colonel of the unit: * Robert Trimble, former CO, appointed 14 July 1875 * W.W. Gossage, former CO, appointed 1 October 1910 * Gen Sir Walter Kirke, appointed 28 April 1934 Memorial In the entrance hall of the Garston Branch of the Royal British Legion there is a brass memorial plaque to 38 men of 13th Lancashire and B/277 Btys who died in WWI.IWM War Memorial Register Ref 15515.

Monaghan became one of the early responders to U.S. President Abraham Lincoln's call for volunteers to defend Washington, D.C. following the mid- April 1861 fall of Fort Sumter to the Confederate States Army. After enrolling for military service in the American Civil War, Monaghan officially mustered in as a private with Company F of the 48th Pennsylvania Infantry.Rodenbough, Uncle Sam‚Äôs Medal of Honor: Some of the Noble Deeds for Which the Medal Has Been Awarded, Described by Those Who Have Won It 1861‚Äì1886: ‚ÄúThree Thinking Bayonets‚Äù, p. 113.

Harrisburg, Pennsylvania: Pennsylvania State Archives. Armed with Harper's Ferry muskets, Monaghan and his fellow 48th Pennsylvania Volunteers were trained in basic light infantry tactics before being shipped on September 24 to Baltimore, Maryland via the Northern Central Railroad, where they transferred to the steamship, Georgia. Transported to Fortress Monroe, they disembarked there on September 26, and resumed their training. After departing Fortress Monroe on November 11 via the steamship, S.R. Spaulding, they arrived at Hatteras Island in North Carolina the next day. Encamped in wooden barracks at Fort Clarke, Monaghan and his regiment continued to hone their skills via drills and inspections. During the early winter of 1862, they received their first exposure to combat when they participated in the capture of Roanoke Island (February 7‚Äì8, 1862). Monaghan then remained behind at their Hatteras encampment with his fellow F Company members, as well as those from Companies E and K, when the bulk of the regiment participated in operations related to the Battle of New Bern (March 14). They then reconnected with the main body of their regiment on May 23, which had been reassigned, on April 11, to the 1st Brigade of the division commanded by Brigadier-General Jesse L. Reno. At this juncture, they were then issued Enfield rifles. Moved back to Fortress Monroe in early June, they were then ordered to Newport News, Virginia where, on August 2, they sailed for Aquia Creek, and were transported from there two days later by rail to Fredericksburg, where they supported Union Army operation for roughly a week before being assigned to the Northern Virginia Campaign, during which they fought in the Battle of Cedar Mountain (August 9), engaged in operations at Kelly's Ford, White Sulphur Springs, Warrenton, and Manassas Junctions, and fought against the Confederate forces led by Stonewall Jackson in the Second Battle of Bull Run (August 28‚Äì30). According to historian Samuel P. Bates, Monaghan and his fellow 48th Pennsylvanians reached the battlefield at Bull Run at 1 p.m. on August 29 after ‚Äúthe action already having begun‚Äù, and were quickly positioned on the Union Army's far right:Bates, Samuel P.

Re-engaging with the enemy the next day (August 30), the 48th Pennsylvanians experienced more intense combat during the Battle of Chantilly (September 1), during which the 48th Pennsylvania was again positioned at the far right of the Union Army. Ordered to Alexandria after the battle's conclusion, the regiment was reassigned to the Maryland Campaign (September 4‚Äì20). After fighting again near Fox's Pass in the Battle of South Mountain (September 14), Monaghan and the 48th Pennsylvania persevered through the brutality of the Battle of Antietam (September 17). Having engaged the enemy that morning at Burnside's Bridge, they then led the 1st Brigade in its pursuit of CSA troops through Sharpsburg and its surrounding bluffs while under heavy enemy artillery and rifle fire. Continuing to march and skirmish periodically with the enemy that fall, they then fought again in the Battle of Fredericksburg (December 11‚Äì15).Bates, Samuel P.

Still serving with the U.S. Army's 9th Corps during the opening months of 1863, Monaghan and the 48th Pennsylvania Infantry were transferred with their corps to duties in the west. Transported on March 26 from Newport News to Cincinnati, by way of Baltimore, Harrisburg and Pittsburgh, they spent less than 24 hours in the city on March 30 before moving on to their assigned provost duties in Lexington, Kentucky. A corporal by this point in his military career, he was subsequently attached to Battery M of the 3rd U.S. Artillery from September to December 1863, during which time he fought with the Army of the Potomac in the East Tennessee Campaign (also known as the Knoxville Campaign), including the Battle of Campbell's Station (November 16) and Siege of Knoxville.Rodenbough, Uncle Sam‚Äôs Medal of Honor: Some of the Noble Deeds for Which the Medal Has Been Awarded, Described by Those Who Have Won It 1861‚Äì1886: ‚ÄúThree Thinking Bayonets‚Äù, p. 113.Bates, Samuel P.

Having returned to service with his regiment in February 1864, Monaghan joined his fellow 48th Pennsylvania Volunteers in their next phase of service. Attached to the 1st Brigade of the 2nd Division of the U.S. Army's 9th Corps, they were then assigned to the Overland Campaign led by Lieutenant-General Ulysses S. Grant. While re-engaging the enemy in the Battle of the Wilderness (May 5‚Äì7), Monaghan was wounded again. The 48th Pennsylvania was then even more heavily battered by the enemy during the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House (May 8‚Äì21), a fight in which the 48th ‚Äústeadily maintained its position under a destructive fire of musketry and artillery, and captured two hundred prisoners‚Äù that morning, according to Bates, and charged the enemy that afternoon ‚Äúunder a galling fire‚Äù that felled multiple members of the regiment. After charging the enemy again on the 18th, they then skirmished off and on with Confederate troops in the vicinities of the North Anna and Pamunkey rivers and Totopotomoy Creek before fully re- engaging with the enemy during the Battle of Cold Harbor (June 3‚Äì12).Bates, Samuel P.

Involved with his regiment in the June and July preparations for the mine placement and explosion at Petersburg, but not the ensuing Battle of the Crater (July 30), Monaghan and his fellow 48th Pennsylvanians next fought with Confederates in the Battle of Poplar Springs Church (September 30‚ÄìOctober 2), and were then reassigned to the occupation of Fort Sedgwick from early December 1864 through April 1, 1865. The next day, they participated in the Union's assault on Fort Mahone, and began the occupation of Petersburg (April 3), continuing in operations related to this action until their regiment was honorably mustered out on July 17, 1865.Rodenbough, Uncle Sam‚Äôs Medal of Honor: Some of the Noble Deeds for Which the Medal Has Been Awarded, Described by Those Who Have Won It 1861‚Äì1886: ‚ÄúThree Thinking Bayonets‚Äù, p. 113.Bates, Samuel P.

Originally billed as the \\"Official Paper of the Village\\", it was known as The Batavia Daily News from 1879 through1881, and the \\"Daily Morning News\\" from 1878 to 1879. Published from the county seat of Genesee County, the paper also serves portions of neighboring Wyoming and Orleans counties. It is published six days a week, Monday through Saturday. Its circulation estimate is 10,500 copies in 2018, and it is currently owned by Johnson Newspaper Corporation.  History  The Daily News began publication on June 25, 1878. From 1881 to 1938, G.S. Griswold served as publisher along with partner McWain. A prominent member of the community, he was one of the charter members of the Associated Press and its one-time president. In 1897, the Daily News bought The Batavian, a rival weekly that had operated since 1868. Enlarging it, they turned it from an independent paper to a Republican one. In 1984, The Daily News won a USA Today printing contract. The contract allowed regional printing of USA Today serving Western New York, and resulted in a printing plant expansion. In 1992, Mark Graczyk is promoting to managing editor of the paper. Graczyk, who has been with the newspaper since 1988. By spending time with the organization for the last 4 years he was able to show a connection with a community. The Tom Turnbull era as Publisher started from 2002 till 2013. One of the challenges in the 21st century was and still is to this day of the internet. Some may call it helpful but others may feel differently about it. Even those who grew up in the country still rely on their news source from newspapers, television, and radio. Three loyal sources that have been a traditional go-to source that you can trust. With the internet, you will need to be careful about what you read. As in, if you read an idea then the source will be print first before going online. Almost like a double-check make sure everything was reading correctly. From a societal point of view, this was going to take time to transition. Regardless if you live in a country, suburbs, and/or city. In a step by step process of watching an idea of a newspaper website introducing do you start or do you let someone else create it? This was a big question not just in Batavia but also across the country and globe. There was a lot of thinking before going into the project like an example presentation. In time, companies have adapted to the idea of jumping into the newspaper website; because, the theme of living in the new era has started. In May 2008, Howard Owens decided to adventure out into the Batavia area. From there he established an online newspaper community known as The Batavian; however, there was a twist to the idea of adding blogging from a neighborhood point of view. When the website was release not many people knew what to think of the idea. From local subscribers to businesses and the Batavia Daily News. This actually gave the organization to see how everyone will react when the idea is being introduced. As in brainstorm their own ways of how they want to make their own website. The wait and see approach was a better way to look at it; because this is an adjustment staff and community as well during the 21st century. 2009 has become one of the most challenging years for every industry in the country. After recovering from a 2nd Slightly Recession started back in 2007 was still continuing in 2009. However, in some opinion, there are a few companies out there that actually will call a small time period of the 2nd Great Depression due to ideas becoming shut down. Less \\"Ma and Pa\\" Companies and more commercial companies taking over. The Obama Presidency did not factor much of the situation due to time of the length of a Recession 19 Months (1 year and 7 months). The Great Depression was 43 months (3 years and 8 months). Because of changing business models under the modern time of learning, cuts were being made. This was being led by the class of 2006-2008 of a college education. Plus the House and Senate that draw the ideas to help during the Recession. By having these ideas factoring in made some unique opportunity that was being noticed throughout the country. For example, Gannett, who owned the USA Today paper had to make a very difficult decision by ending the contract with the Johnson Newspaper Corporation during that summer. Losing this contract will lead to future changes in this organization of the Printing Press. Not just the media we‚Äôre going through changes, other industries as well. Another example, the car industry... almost a repeat of an era of history in the 1980s. Sort of similar during the 1st Slightly Recession during the Presidency of Ronald Reagan. On February 17th, 2010 the BDN joined the YouTube Channel (U2BE), bought by Google on Nov. 13th, 2006. Google was created back on September 4th, 1998. The U2BE was created back in Feb. 14th, 2005 an idea that had a society multi-point of view on what life can be a picture in. There were several reasons and benefits, why the organization joined in. 1.) This was a way to connect the local audience, who are subscribers to understand what is going not a reading and/or a single image or multiple images point of view or the audio file... but a full-motion image with the sound being displayed to them while understanding a story. 2.) For those, who may not live in the surrounding area that may be moving there due to their personal storyline, may wish to watch this from wherever their current location is. 4.) This also served as an online Time Capsule in that area. 5.) Since Facebook (FB), was created back in 2004 didn't allow video uploading process a link from YouTube can be used to place on their page. Yet, to this date (June 6th, 2020) there are still growing problems with organization and society that are still being address. 5.) Plus with any Social Media ideas can always crash also known as close down. That is why, using YouTube Channel is a Primary Source of uploading Video; while, other Social Platforms sites are Secondary. Plus placing the link from the source to the main website. 6.) Keep in mind in with the Newspaper industry that was back in 1690 was and is to this today to paint a picture of a society in that area. This is no different when using the YoutTube Channel. As in what can be improved, and how to inform the public what is going on. 7.) Youtube Offer Live video starting on November 22nd, 2008 which gave the organization an upper hand. 8.) For an educational purpose for the training modules for their current staff and also for a college student and/or professor that needs to do research on a visual concept of what is going on in their current study. One of the misconceptions that many people in the latest era of the YouTube Channel movement is that you didn't need the latest technology to use a video recorder. Even if you use something back in 2000 or even 2005 can still be used in 2008 to run a live video as long as you had other modern technology at the time. Then on August 30th, 2010 the Buffalo News started to print BDN. Not only did they print the Daily News, but they also printed the Livingston County News and Drummer Pennysaver. The Batavia Daily News also took on responsibility on social media in the Facebook and Twitter world. Unfortunately haven't focused on fun Instagram, an idea missing out on. Pros vs Cons of Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Digital Paid Subscription vs Free Digital Subscription - to continue. In 2014, the history of the home location of Batavia Daily News went up for sale. A successful buyer purchased the building on September 20th. There was a lot of talk about the organization moving closer to the City of Batavia. Unfortunately, the company was looking for at the time availability didn't make any sense to make a move. They will always keep an open eye if an opportunity does open up. Some wonder what lead to the situation. There was a notice of a steady decline of the population in the coverage they offer for news-wise. In 2010 the population of Counties - Genesee: 59,940, Orleans: 42,842 and Wyoming: 42,121. During the sale of 2014, there was a steady decrease in all three areas - Genesee: 58,725, Orleans: 41,861, and Wyoming: 41,129. Then five years later (2019) numbers continue to dwindle - Genesee: 57,280, Orleans: 40,352, and Wyoming: 40,085 (2018 due to no results in 2019). The Buffalo News reported on the date, June 14, 2014, that the circulation of numbers was at 10,200 being published for public to read. During 2015, long time faithful Managing Editor Mark Graczyk chose a different path and went up to the Watertown Daily Times. He accepted a position as Copy Editor which did overlook several newspapers. One being the Batavia Daily News. In the wake of the change of the newspaper industry, the Batavia Daily News was fortunate to hire Tiffany Towner to take on the ropes of the future of the paper. Towner spent some time getting to know the community. In September 2017, John Anderson replaced Tiffany Towner as the managing editor of the paper. 2018-2019 the Batavia Daily News started to relook at the contract with the Buffalo News. Due to the cutting down of newspapers being printed that was not necessary, a change of having the home office in Watertown, NY became a very large interest to do. Batavia Daily News switched from publishing six days a week to a five day was another adjustment with the business model of times. By eliminating Monday's the focus of readers interest was still from Tuesday-Saturday. Then later in 2019, Ben Beagle took over the job as John Anderson. Anderson took on a similar job down in Texas. Beagle, who before had a connection with the Batavia Daily News as the Lifestyles editor went to the sister paper, the Livingston County Newspaper as Editor. After spending just over 5 years in Geneseo and the work experience that he learn to guide him to become the Regional Editor. Poll History A 2009 poll in The Batavian, an online news site and a competitor to the Batavia Daily News founded in 2008, indicated that 37.2 percent of respondents felt that partisanship did not figure into The Daily News coverage, while 23.4 percent of respondents felt it leaned Republican, and 17.9 percent felt it leaned Democrat. 21.1 percent answered, \\"not sure.\\" Awards and Recognition (As of 4/6/20) The Batavia Daily News (BDN) staff had a lot of heart to show in the product of the newspaper industry.

The band featured Tali K√§llstr√∂m (vocals), Rhodri Daniel (guitar), Steffan Pringle (bass), and Adam Thomas (drums). The band's debut album You Say I'm Too Much, I Say You're Not Enough was released in 2018. The band officially disbanded on 20 February 2019.  History  The bands roots traced back to 2013 when Welsh-Canadian lead singer, Tali K√§llstr√∂m, met guitarist Rhodri Daniel in Aberystwyth. After meeting, the two began collaborating musically, which lead to the creation of \\"Estrons\\", which is Welsh for \\"misfits\\" or \\"strangers\\" or also \\"aliens\\". Daniel wrote their garage pop influenced single \\"Make A Man\\" while at a Berlin nightclub. The second song of theirs \\"Drop\\" was written in a police cell after their first concert in Cardiff. This was following a romantic breakup K√§llstr√∂m was going through. \\"Make a Man\\" was first released on the band's SoundCloud account on 25 September 2015, while the music video came out on 3 November 2015. On 4 December 2015 the song was released as a single. \\"Drop\\", the band's second single came out on the band's SoundCloud on 7 April 2016. The song was another written while K√§llstr√∂m was in prison. \\"Drop\\" was released as a standalone single on 5 May 2016. On 3 November 2016, about a year following their debut single, Estrons released their debut extended play, She's Here Now. The E.P. was described by Noisey as \\"blistering\\", and that the songs \\"don't skirt around their topics‚Äîthey dive into them head first like a rugby player hurtling towards a kebab shop\\". A year later, Estrons released their third single, \\"Strobe Lights\\" on 8 April 2017. The music video was released on their Vevo page on 5 June 2017. The song was considered a \\"back to the basics\\" track by DIY magazine. The year concluded with the band opening for Honeyblood on their tour. In 2018, the band released three singles ahead of the debut album: \\"Lilac\\", \\"Cameras\\", and \\"Body\\". You Say I'm Too Much, I Say You're Not Enough was released on 5 October 2018 through Goford Records to little attention from the major music press. After six years, on 20 February 2019, the band announced that they were disbanding ahead of a UK headline tour which was consequently cancelled.

It is a gradual, integrative process through which children acquire the capacity to understand, experience, express, and manage emotions and to develop meaningful relationships with others.Cohen, J., Onunaku, N., Clothier, S., & Poppe, J. (2005). Helping young children succeed: Strategies to promote early childhood social and emotional development. In Research and Policy Report. Washington, DC: National Conference of State Legislatures. As such, social emotional development encompasses a large range of skills and constructs, including, but not limited to: self-awareness, joint attention, play, theory of mind (or understanding others' perspectives), self-esteem, emotion regulation, friendships, and identity development. Social emotional development sets a foundation for children to engage in other developmental tasks. For example, in order to complete a difficult school assignment, a child may need the ability to manage their sense of frustration and seek out help from a peer. To maintain a romantic relationship after a fight, a teen may need to be able to articulate their feelings and take the perspective of their partner to successfully resolve the conflict. However, it is also interrelated with and dependent on other developmental domains. For example, language delays or deficits have been associated with social-emotional disturbances. Many mental health disorders, including major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, borderline personality disorder, substance use disorders, and eating disorders, can be conceptualized through the lens of social emotional development, most prominently emotion regulation. Many of the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder reflect abnormalities in social emotional developmental areas, including joint attention and theory of mind.  Early childhood (birth to 3 years old)  = Attachment = Attachment refers to the strong bond that individuals develop with special people in their lives. Though we can have attachment relationships with significant others in adulthood, such as marital partners, most humans‚Äô first and most influential attachment is with their primary caregiver(s) as infants. John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth first delineated and tested attachment theory as an evolutionarily informed process in which the emotional ties to a caregiver are adaptive for survival. Their research supported the presence of four stages of attachment formation: # Undiscriminating social responsiveness (0‚Äì3 months) ‚Äì Instinctual infant signals, such as crying, gazing, gasping, help facilitate caregiver interactions with infants. Infants do not consistently discriminate with whom they signal or how they respond. # Preferential social responsiveness (3‚Äì6 months) ‚Äì Infants now clearly respond differently to primary caregiver(s) than strangers. Infants have learned that this caregiver will consistently respond to their signals. # Emergence of secure-base behavior (6‚Äì24 months) ‚Äì Young children use their attachment figure as a ‚Äúsecure base‚Äù from which to explore the world and a ‚Äúsafe haven‚Äù to return to for reassurance or comfort. When the attachment figure is not available, children may exhibit separation anxiety. # Partnership (24 months and older) ‚Äì Children develop an internal working model about the availability and responsiveness of attachment figures that can impact their future behavior and relationships. An infant with her mother, a possible attachment figure Early attachment is considered foundational to later social-emotional development, and is predictive of many outcomes, including internalizing problems, externalizing problems, social competence, self-esteem, cognitive development, and achievement. Mary Ainsworth's work using the Strange Situation method identified four types of attachment styles in young children: # Secure attachment: Children in this category are willing to explore the room/toys independently when their caregiver is present. They may cry when separated, but seek out comfort and are easily soothed when their caregiver returns. This style is associated with sensitive, responsive care by the attachment figure. # Anxious/Avoidant attachment: Children in this category tend to be less responsive to separation from their caregiver, do not differentiate as clearly between caregivers and strangers, and are avoidant of caregivers upon return. This style is associated with overstimulating care or by consistently detached care. # Anxious/Ambivalent attachment: Children in this category may seek out closeness with caregiver and appear unwilling to explore. They show distress upon separation and may appear both mad (e.g., hitting, struggling) and clingy when the caregiver returns. These children are often harder to soothe. This style is associated with inconsistent responsiveness or maternal interference with exploration. # Disorganized attachment: Children in this category often do not show a predictable pattern of behavior, but may be non-responsive or demonstrate flat affect. This style is associated with unpredictable and/or frightening experiences with caregivers, and is more common in children who have experienced maltreatment. = Emotional experiences =  Emotional expression  Smiling begins in infants at a young age, progressing into social smiling, and becoming more intentional as they grow older Beginning at birth, newborns have the capacity to signal generalized distress in response to unpleasant stimuli and bodily states, such as pain, hunger, body temperature, and stimulation. They may smile, seemingly involuntarily, when satiated, in their sleep, or in response to pleasant touch. Infants begin using a ‚Äúsocial smile,‚Äù or a smile in response to a positive social interaction, at approximately 2 to 3 months of age, and laughter begins at 3 to 4 months. Expressions of happiness become more intentional with age, with young children interrupting their actions to smile or express happiness to nearby adults at 8‚Äì10 months of age, and with markedly different kinds of smiles (e.g., grin, muted smile, mouth open smile) developing at 10 to 12 months of age. Between 18‚Äì24 months, children begin to acquire a sense of self. This gives rise to the onset of self-conscious emotions (e.g., shame, embarrassment, guilt, pride) around that same age, which are considered more complex in nature than basic emotions such as happiness, anger, fear, or disgust. This is because they require that children have recognition of external standards, and evaluative capacities to determine whether the self meets that standard.  Emotion regulation  Emotion regulation can be defined by two components. The first, ‚Äúemotions as regulating,‚Äù refers to changes that are elicited by activated emotions (e.g., a child's sadness eliciting a change in parent response). The second component is labeled ‚Äúemotions as regulated,‚Äù which refers to the process through which the activated emotion is itself changed by deliberate actions taken by the self (e.g., self-soothing, distraction) or others (e.g., comfort). Throughout infancy, children rely heavily on their caregivers for emotion regulation; this reliance is labeled co-regulation. Caregivers use strategies such as distraction and sensory input (e.g., rocking, stroking) to regulate infants‚Äô emotions. Despite reliance on caregivers to change the intensity, duration, and frequency of emotions, infants are capable of engaging in self-regulation strategies as young as 4 months. At this age, infants intentionally avert their gaze from overstimulating stimuli. By 12 months, infants use their mobility in walking and crawling to intentionally approach or withdraw from stimuli. Throughout toddlerhood, caregivers remain important for the emotional development and socialization of their children, through behaviors such as: labeling their child's emotions, prompting thought about emotion (e.g., ‚Äúwhy is the turtle sad?‚Äù), continuing to provide alternative activities/distractions, suggesting coping strategies, and modeling coping strategies. Caregivers who use such strategies and respond sensitively to children's emotions tend to have children who are more effective at emotion regulation, are less fearful and fussy, more likely to express positive emotions, easier to soothe, more engaged in environmental exploration, and have enhanced social skills in the toddler and preschool years. = Understanding others =  Social referencing  visual cliff experiment. A mother urges her child from across the deep side of the visual cliff. Despite a transparent surface covering the cliff, the child hesitates to move forward. Starting at about 8‚Äì10 months, infants begin to engage in social referencing, in which they refer to another, often an adult or caregiver, to inform their reaction to environmental stimuli. In the classic visual cliff experiments, 12-month-old babies who were separated from their mothers by a plexiglass floor that appeared to represent a dangerous ‚Äúcliff‚Äù looked to their mothers for a cue. When mothers responded to their infants with facial expressions signaling encouragement and happiness, most infants crossed over the cliff. In contrast, if mothers displayed fear or anger, most infants did not cross. As infants age, their social referencing capacity becomes more developed. By 14 months, infants are able to use information gained from social referencing to inform decisions outside of the immediate moment. By 18 months, infants are able to socially reference interactions not directed at them. For example, if their caregiver responded with anger when their older brother went to take a cookie, the infant is able to harness that information and is less likely to take a cookie themselves. At this age, social referencing also begins to support children's understanding of others, as children learn what others like and dislike based on the information gained from social referencing (e.g., facial expression). As such, if an adult reacts by smiling when given a ball but with anger when given a doll, an 18-month-old will choose to give that adult a ball, rather than a doll, regardless of their own preferences.  Empathy  From an early age, newborns are reactive to others‚Äô distress, as evidenced by behaviors such as crying in response to another infant's cry. As children continue to develop, they begin to display behaviors that indicate an understanding of and connection to others‚Äô emotional states beyond the simple informational value those emotional states provide. Children at 18‚Äì30 months will respond to verbal and nonverbal cues, such as facial expressions or body posture, of discomfort or sadness with simple helping behaviors (e.g., giving an adult a blanket if they are shivering, rubbing their arms, and saying ‚Äúbrr‚Äù). Throughout this period (18‚Äì30 months), children become more adept and need fewer cues to engage in helping behavior. However, helping behavior at this age is already dependent on the cost of helping (e.g., they are less likely to give the adult their own blanket) and the recipient of the help (e.g., children are more likely to help and show concern for caregivers than strangers or peers). = Social interactions = Between 3 and 6 months old, infants begin engaging in simple back-and-forth exchanges, often with their caregivers. These exchanges do not consist of words, but of coos, gurgles, smiles or other facial expressions, and bodily movements (e.g., lifting arms, kicking legs). These back and forth exchanges mimic the turn-taking that occurs in conversations.  Joint attention  Joint attention refers to the ability of individuals to share a common point of reference or attention. In children, this common point of reference often is an object in the environment, such as a toy. The development of joint attention initially starts with the infants' ability to respond to joint attention bids (e.g., looking where their parent looks), and eventually develops with age to the ability to initiate joint attention by directing the attention of another to shared point of reference. This can be done through many means, including gaze, gesture (e.g., pointing, showing), or speech. As early as 3 to 4 months of age, infants show the beginning requisites of joint attention, by looking in the general direction as adults; however, they are not consistently able to find the shared point of reference. At 10 months, this accuracy improves, and infants are also more discerning in their response to joint attention. For example, at this age, a 10-month-old will not look in the same direction as an adult if that adult's eyes are closed, a mistake that younger children make. Initiation of joint attention begins at approximately 1 year old. This might look like a child pointing to an airplane, then looking at their mom, and back at the airplane, as if to say \\"do you see that?\\" or \\"look at that!\\" Joint attention is a critical social skill that drives development in other domains. Joint attention enables infants to identify objects that adults are labeling and promotes shared back- and-forth communication about them. Fifteen-month-old infants who were engaged in interactions with caregivers that include a joint attentional focus (e.g., a toy) demonstrated more frequent communicative utterances than when not in joint attention episodes. These episodes of joint engagement were predictive of later vocabulary and word learning, especially when the joint attention was focused on an object that the infant was initially attending to, such as when an infant picks up a ball, then the mother engages in a joint attention episode with the infant using the ball as the shared point of reference. At later ages, when initiating joint attention, the frequency that a child combines one word with a gesture (e.g., pointing to the plane and saying \\"plane\\") is associated with earlier onset of multi-word utterances, and more complex speech overall at 3.5 years old.  Preschoolers (3‚Äì6 years old)  = Self-concept = Self-concept refers to the set of attributes, abilities, attitudes, and values that one identifies as defining who he or she is. Although some initial milestones occur before this period that support self- concept, including basic self awareness (i.e., the ability to recognize themselves in a mirror) and self-labeling of their gender, this period involves several advances in this domain. By 42 months, children are able to describe their likes and dislikes, suggesting a developing awareness of what elicits positive and negative emotions in themselves. By 5 years old, children demonstrate agreement with their mothers' ratings of their behavior on basic behavioral indicators of personality.  Gender identity  During the preschool period, children are deepening their gender identity and integrating gender socialization information into their self-concept. Preschoolers learn gender stereotypes quickly and definitively, ranging from toy preferences, clothes, jobs, and behaviors. These stereotypes are initially held firmly, such that 3 to 4-year-olds will often state that violations are not possible and that they would not want to be friends with a child who violates their stereotypes. Children acquire gender stereotypic behaviors early in the preschool period through social learning, then organize these behaviors into beliefs about themselves, forming a basic gender identity. By the end of the preschool period, children acquire gender constancy, an understanding of the biological basis of sex and its consistency over time. = Understanding others = Younger preschool aged children demonstrate the basics of theory of mind, or the ability to take the perspective of others. However, this skill is constrained by children's limited understanding of how thoughts and beliefs, even when false, influence behavior. This is demonstrated in the following scenario: > Danny puts his toy on the shelf, then leaves the room. His friend Sally > comes in, plays with the toy, and puts it in the cabinet. When asked where Danny will look for his toy, a young preschool aged child will state that he will look in the cabinet, therefore not recognizing Danny's current false belief about the toy's location. Between 4 and 6 years, children's capacity to understand false beliefs, and subsequently their accuracy in perspective taking, becomes strengthened. = Social interactions = Play can have an important role in social emotional development, allowing opportunities to engage in practice cooperation, negotiation, and conflict resolution skills. Play is often cited as a central building block to children's development, so much so that it has been stated as a human right of all children. The complexity and diversity of play increases immensely in the preschool years, most notably with the onset of cooperative play, where children work toward a common goal, and socio-dramatic play (a type of cooperative play), where children act out make believe scenes. Socio-dramatic play is rooted in the child's real-life experiences, falling into three categories: family scenes (e.g., \\"playing house\\" with assigned mommy and daddy roles), character scenes (e.g., being a superhero, or a princess), and functional scenes (e.g., playing doctor). Cooperative play and socio-dramatic play both bring about increased social interactions, as compared to solitary play and parallel play, where children play similarly next to each other without significant interaction (e.g., two children building their own towers). It is here where play becomes intertwined with social emotional development. The characteristics of socio-dramatic play allow children to practice cooperation, negotiation, and conflict resolution skills, as well as engage in role-playing that promotes perspective taking. As such, socio- dramatic play has been associated with all of these social emotional skills in children.  Middle childhood (7‚Äì12 years old)  = Self-concept = Between 8‚Äì11 years old, children begin to use self-evaluations and competencies to define their sense of self. This derives from the recently developed ability to make social comparisons. At 6 years old, these social comparisons may be to a specific individual; however, this becomes more complex in the coming years, allowing children to compare themselves and their performance to multiple individuals to arrive at a general conclusion. School aged children also show the ability to simultaneously hold differentiated self-evaluations across domains (e.g., having good physical appearance, but poor school performance).  Gender identity  In middle childhood, boys and girls form peer groups segregated by gender, which may act to perpetuate previously learned gender stereotypes. Deriving from the ability to make social comparisons, school aged children begin to integrate attributions about how gender typical they are into their gender identity. At this age, children's ability to make more global self-evaluations also allows them to recognize contentedness or dissonance with their gender assignment. Children's gender identity on these two dimensions is significantly correlated with their self-esteem, such that children with higher levels of typicality and contentedness report having higher self-esteem and worth. = Emotional experiences =  Emotion vocabulary  By 3 years old, children have acquired a basic vocabulary for labeling simple emotional experiences, using words such as \\"scared,\\" \\"happy,\\" and \\"mad.\\" However, the emotional vocabulary of children grows much more rapidly during middle childhood, doubling every two years in this period before slowing down dramatically in adolescence. At the end of the preschool period, most children reliably comprehend the meaning of around 40 emotion words; by the time they are 11 years old, most children see a sevenfold increase to understanding almost 300 emotion words.  Display rules  Emotional display rules are culturally bound norms that dictate when, how, and with whom individuals can express emotions. Accordingly, the ability to enact display rules relies on children's capacity for emotional expression and emotion regulation. Socialization toward these display rules begins in infancy, and children show some capacity in the preschool period. However, children's use of display rules and understanding of their value become increasingly complex in elementary school. As children age from 1st to 7th grade, they are less likely to outwardly express anger or sadness. Children also report using display rules to control their emotional expressions more with teachers than with peers, and more than peers than with parents. There is some evidence to suggest that this emotional masking also increases with age throughout the school age period, at least with teachers. Display rules also inform how children choose to express emotions; as children move from the preschool period to middle childhood, they become more likely to use verbal communication to express negative emotions than nonverbal behaviors, such as crying or hitting. Finally, at around 9 years old, bolstered by increased perspective taking skills, display rules are recognized as important to maintaining social harmony and relationships rather than simply a means to avoid punishment.  Emotion regulation  Upon school entry, children's emotion regulation repertoire becomes increasingly diverse as previously relied upon methods (e.g., seeking support from parents, moving away/avoiding an emotionally activating stimuli) become less effective. In middle childhood, children implement more complex distraction techniques, cognitive appraisal strategies (e.g., choosing to focus on the positive), and problem solving methods. At 10 years old, children's emotion regulation involves a balance of problem-focused coping and emotion-focused coping strategies. Problem-focused coping represents a change driven strategy, focused on attempting to eliminate the source of stress through proactive action (e.g., if a child feels worried about a test, choosing to study to regulate that worry). In contrast, emotion- focused coping is acceptance based and can be more effective when the stressor can not be easily changed or removed (e.g., if a child is disappointed about their grade on the test, using strategies to reduce disappointment in the moment: \\"this will help me know what to study for the final\\"). And although diversification of emotion regulation strategy use occurs at this age, school aged children continue to strengthen their use of previous regulation strategies as well. Notably, school age children continue to seek out regulation support, but not just from their parents, but increasingly from teachers and peers in this period. Children also show a developmental progression in differentiation of whom to go to for emotional support given then specific situations. Thus on the whole, by the beginning of adolescence, children have been become more skilled emotion regulators on the whole.  Adolescence (13‚Äì18 years old)  = Self-concept =  Identity development  As adolescents navigate an increasingly diverse social world, their self-concept shifts to create and accommodate an organized understanding of how situational factors may influence their behavior (e.g., how and why behavior is different with friends as compared to with parents). With this added complexity, a fundamental task of adolescence is considered forming a unified, coherent identity, inclusive of traits, values, and goals. Erik Erikson theorized that adolescence is characterized by a period of exploration and commitments. The combination of these two traits resulted in four identity statuses: * Identity achievement: a status characterized by a past period of exploration, and subsequent commitment to values and goals * Moratorium: a status characterized by continued active exploration, without commitment * Foreclosure: a status characterized by strong commitment to a prescribed identity (e.g., by teachers, parents), without a previous period of self exploration * Diffusion: a status characterized by both a lack of exploration and a lack of commitment Past research suggests that over the course of high school, the distribution of identity statuses changes, such that many adolescents begin high school in a Diffusion status, but many adolescents reach Identity Achievement status at the end of high school. This general pattern is echoed in specific studies of minority group ethnic identity development, where youth initially have an unexplored ethnic identity, then enter a moratorium phase, followed by ethnic identity achievement. In general, Identity Achievement and Moratorium statuses appear to be associated with positive psychological adjustment, including higher self-esteem, goal-oriented behavior, self-efficacy, and openness. = Social interactions =  Friendships  Adolescence is a time in which peer relationships become increasingly important and frequent. In this period, adolescents reliably spend approximately twice as much time with their peers than with their parents. At the same time, there is a developmental shift occurring in the quality and nature of friendships in this period. Adolescents' friendships are characterized by increased emotional support, intimacy, closeness, and loyalty. This is contrasted to friendships in early childhood, which is built upon time spent in joint activities, and middle childhood, which is defined by reciprocity and helping behavior. Close friendships in adolescence can act as a buffer against the negative impacts of stressors, provide a foundation for intimacy and conflict resolution necessary in romantic relationships, and promote empathy for others.  Peer acceptance  Peer acceptance is both related to children's prior social emotional development and predictive of later developments in this domain. Sociometric status identifies five classifications of peer acceptance in children based on two dimensions: social liking and social impact/visibility: popular, average, rejected, neglected, and controversial. These patterns of acceptance can become self-perpetuating throughout childhood and adolescence, as rejected children are excluded from peer interactions that promote relationship skills, such as perspective taking and conflict resolution.  Peer groups  During adolescence, children increasingly form peer groups, often with a common interest or values (e.g., \\"skaters,\\" \\"jocks\\"), that are somewhat insular in nature (e.g., \\"cliques\\" or \\"crowds\\"). Theoretically, peer groups have been hypothesized to serve as an intermediary support source as adolescents exert independence from their family. This is supported by data that indicates that the importance of peer group membership to youth increases in early adolescence, followed by a decline in later adolescence. Peers and peer groups at this age become important socialization agents, contributing to adolescents' sense of identity, behavior, and values. Peer groups, whether intentionally or unintentionally, exert peer pressure and operant learning principles to shape behavior through reinforcement, resulting in members of peer groups become increasingly similar over time. Many adolescents report the effects of peer influence on many aspects of their behavior, including academic engagement, risk-taking, and family involvement; however, the direction of this influence varied dependent on the peer group the adolescent was affiliated with.  Assessment of social-emotional development  The assessment of social emotional development in young children must include an assessment of both child-level factors, such as genetic disorders, physical limitations, or linguistic and cognitive developmental level, as well as contextual factors, such as family and cultural factors. Of particular importance for young children is the caregiving context, or the parent-child relationship. = Early childhood Assessment = The majority of measures designed to assess early childhood social emotional development are parent report questionnaires. Parent reports using such measures repeatedly indicate that the 7%-12% of children show early social-emotional problems or delays. Increasing evidence suggests that these problems remain moderately stable over periods of 1‚Äì2 years, suggesting clinical and societal benefits to early identification and intervention. Standardized assessments have been developed to identify social emotional concerns as young as 6 months old. Below is a list of some more widely used parent-report screening measures and comprehensive assessments: * Ages and Stages Questionnaire: Social Emotional (ASQ-SE)  Appropriate for children ages 6‚Äì60 months  Screening measure: produces one score, with high scores indicating possible need for further evaluation * Brief Infant and Toddler Social Emotional Assessment (BITSEA)  Appropriate for children ages 12‚Äì36 months  Screening measure: produces Problem and Competence scores, combined cut-off point determines concern * Child Behavior Checklist ages 1.5-5 (CBCL)  Appropriate for children ages 18 months ‚Äì 60 months  Comprehensive measure: produces specific DSM-oriented scale scores, as well as Internalizing, Externalizing, Total Problems standardized t-scores = Later Childhood Assessment = The Social Thinking Methodology is a developmental, language-based and thinking-based (metacognitive) methodology that uses visual frameworks, unique vocabulary, strategies, and activities to foster social competence for children ages 4 ‚Äì 18 years old. The methodology has assessment and treatment components for both interventionists and social learners. The methodology includes components of other well-known and evidence based interventions such as Social Stories, Hidden Curriculum, 5-point scale, and others, etc. Social Thinking‚Ñ¢ shares ideals with executive functioning, central coherence issues, and perspective-taking. The assessment itself is multi-faceted, pulling information from a variety of sources and contexts. A thorough assessment of social skills includes: (a) observing the student with his peers and in different environmental contexts; (b) the diagnostician relating with the student without facilitating the student's social success; (c) a battery of informal assessment tools; (d) administering carefully considered standardized measures; (e) interviewing teachers and parents with regard to the students social cognition and social behaviors.  Social emotional development in schools  Social and emotional learning in schools involves 5 key abilities: self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship skills, and responsible decision-making.Oberle, E., & Schonert- Reichl, K. A. (2017). Social and Emotional Learning: Recent Research and Practical Strategies for Promoting Children‚Äôs Social and Emotional Competence in Schools. Handbook of Social Behavior and Skills in Children, 175‚Äì197. These skills are seen as the foundation upon which people can build all other relational skills. These core skills allow people to regulate and process emotions, think critically, maintain positive relationships, collaborate, and communicate effectively.Woolfolk, Anita, et al. Human Development, Learning and Diversity 2015-2016: Third Custom Edition for the University of British Columbia/Adapted by Work from Anita Woolfolk, Nancy E. Perry, Teresa M. McDevitt and Jeanne Ellis Ormrod. Access and Diversity, Crane Library, University of British Columbia, 2016. Social and emotional learning also has a clear connection with and is positively linked to academic success. It promotes active learning within a community setting, providing the emotional support many need to grow academically. Social and emotional learning recognizes that learning is a social activity and is most productive through collaboration. Many child theorists stress the importance of learning as a social process in theories of child development. Vygotsky's developmental framework highlights the importance of children as social learners needing connections to learn and grow.John-Steiner, Vera, and Seana Moran. \\"Vygotsky‚Äôs contemporary contribution to the dialectic of development and creativity.\\" Creativity and development (2003): 61-90. = Social emotional development in Latin America = In Mexico, efforts to promote social emotional development are challenged by the cultural stigma against mental health. Beginning in 2013, the Mexican government implemented programs of emotional pedagogy, like psicoeducacion, to raise self-knowledge and disseminate mental health information in many domains of public life in order to address this stigma. Mexico's secretary of health defines pyschoeducacion as the teaching of expression, feelings, and behavior. In Oaxaca, government-initiated psychoeducacion projects are common in health clinics, public health communications, as well as in the projects of nonprofit organizations. Efforts have even been made to work with religious organizations to replace previous language for mental illness with more clinical terms. The psychoeducacion trainings by the Mexican government, some of them mandatory, are aimed at teaching children the vocabulary to be able to express themselves in order to recognize the need for early treatment. Although cultural barriers exists the identification and management of emotions are treated as teachable skills. In the global mental health sector, there is concern that Western psychology is crowding out traditional understandings and treatments of mental illness, leading to some backlash against mental health care - such as, for example, amongst indigenous groups in Mexico. To address this, some organizations advocate a close collaboration with indigenous communities. Western experts are studying how specific terminology used in indigenous communities corresponds with common mental health syndromes recognized by the American Psychiatric Association. By Western standards, the treatment and diagnosis of community \\"healers\\" is inconsistent and therefore devalued. Trained mental health experts express frustration, for example, towards those who wait until their symptoms are severe before seeking professional help.

Abe, which profiles 25 women from history. The subjects featured are from a diverse range of historical periods and locations, and include women who had a negative impact on the world. The book has received positive critical reception. Background Anita Sarkeesian is a Canadian-American critic and founder of Feminist Frequency, a website and YouTube channel dedicated to feminist analysis of media. The series Tropes vs. Women in Video Games ran from 2013 to 2017, analysing gender tropes in video games. Beginning with the project's 2012 announcement, Sarkeesian was subject to a widespread online campaign of sexist harassment. Ebony Adams has worked extensively with Sarkeesian on later Feminist Frequency series, such as The FREQ Show. The book was announced in September 2017. Bustle notes that the book is part of a trend of books about women whose achievements have been overlooked. Synopsis The book profiles 25 historical women in a writer's voice, with illustrations of each of the subjects. The subjects' lifespans range from third-century to 20th century, as the authors' only criterion was that living women would not be included. The book contains a mixture of women with a positive and negative impact on the world, with Adams saying that feminism should reflect \\"the fullness of women\\" rather than only \\"women who are doing heroic, amazing things\\" and Sarkeesian commenting that \\"Women are fully human. Sometimes, that means we're terrible.\\" The women chosen include American motorcyclist Bessie Stringfield, American trans woman Lucy Hicks Anderson, Colombian drug lord Griselda Blanco, Italian painter Artemisia Gentileschi, Punjab fighter Mai Bhago and Vietnamese warrior B√† Tri·ªáu. Also included are a British prime minister, a Chinese pirate, an Egyptian scientist, a Mongolian wrestler, a Native American ballerina and a Japanese novelist. Release The book was released on October 2, 2018 by Macmillan Publishing. Sarkeesian and Adams began an eight-day tour for the book on October 3, 2018. Reception School Library Journal gave the book a starred review, praising the global and economic diversity of the women featured in the book. The review summarised: \\"Filled with strength, this collection is incredibly inspiring and will instill in teens a take-charge attitude and powerful mind-set.\\" Kerri Jarema of Bustle praises the \\"beautiful full-color illustrations\\" and writes that the book is \\"perfect\\" for \\"anyone who wants to read different take on history\\". Jody DiPerna of Pittsburgh Current also praises the illustrations that \\"bring each subject to life with movement and humanity\\".

Biography  Born in Fermo, in the Italian region Le Marche, Daniele Cudini completed his secondary education at the Istituto Statale d'Arte in Fermo with the specialisation in ceramics and then continued his studies at the Accademia di Belle Arti di Macerata with a degree in Painting. After a few exhibitions around Italy, in 1992 he was invited to exhibit his works at the Galleria nazionale d'artemoderna in Rome and at the Istituto Giapponese di Cultura in the exhibition Giappone Italia nuove generazioni (Japan Italy new generations), where he showed a series of large paintings created with a working technique that makes use of tar. In 1998 he began his collaboration with Lucio Dalla, who invited him to create a personal exhibition in his gallery in Bologna titled \\"Inspira Trattieri Respira\\" (Breath in - Hold - Breath out), featuring a text by Demetrio Paparoni in the catalogue. In 2001 Umberto Eco invited him to exhibit his works in a solo exhibition titled Interiors at the Istituto Superiore di Scienze Umanistiche in Bologna for the opening of the new academic year. It consisted of 10 large paintings representing interiors where ritual actions take place, both in the intimacy of home and in mythical places such as church and science. In the same year he moved to Berlin for a while then exhibited at the NAK Neure Aachener Kunstverein, in Aachen and in 2018 at the Morsbroich Museum in Leverkusen in a group exhibition with international artists Bjork, Stanley Brouwn, Rodney Graham, Bruce Nauman, Panamarenko, Thomas Ruff and Lawrence Weiner.

History Operation Fox Hunt was launched in June 2014. In the course of six months during 2015 Operation Fox Hunt repatriated 680 people to China. In 2015 Operation Fox Hunt scored its first big success in Europe with the arrest and extradition of a woman surnamed Zhang from Italy. It was the first time a European country had extradited someone to China on accusations of financial crimes. American response The Obama administration in the United States protested the use of undercover intelligence agents as part of Fox Hunt in 2015. In 2020 Federal Bureau of Investigation director Christopher A. Wray gave a speech at the Hudson Institute in New York where he talked at length about Fox Hunt. As of 2020 FBI believes that the purpose of Fox Hunt is political repression not anti-corruption. According to the FBI targets are given the option of returning to China or committing suicide.

Evrard (September 20, 1895 - March 21, 1974) was an attorney and the second president of the Green Bay Football Corporation, the non-profit organization that owns the Green Bay Packers. In addition to his role as Packers president for one year, Evrard also served on the Packers board of directors and was the team's lawyer until 1929. Evrard was also elected for three terms as district attorney of Brown County, Wisconsin, serving from 1922 to 1929. He continued practicing law until the 1970s. Evrard played an important, yet often overlooked role in helping to organize the Packers during the team's early years through his various leadership roles. Evrard died on March 21, 1974. Early life Raymond E. Evrard was born on September 20, 1895 in Green Bay, Wisconsin to Joseph and Mary () Evrard. His family's farm, which was established in 1874 by his grandmother Desire Evrard, was located on the current site of St. Mary's Hospital Medical Center on the west side of Green Bay. He was an alumnus of Green Bay West High School and enrolled at Marquette University at the age of 17. At the age of 21, he graduated with a law degree before serving in World War I as an artillery instructor based at Fort Sheridan in Lake County, Illinois. He left the United States Army in 1919 at the rank of lieutenant. Legal career At the age of 21, Evrard became the youngest lawyer in Wisconsin at the time. He went to work for the law firm of Sheridan, Evans and Merrill, which would eventually be renamed to Sheridan and Evrard. Evrard was elected as district attorney for Brown County, Wisconsin in 1922, serving in that position for three terms until 1929. During his time as district attorney, he won 34 consecutive jury verdicts and was a well-known enforcer of alcohol restrictions stemming from the implementation of Prohibition in the United States. In one month alone he issued 114 citations for alcohol-related offenses, although most of these were dismissed because juries were unwilling to convict. He also served as the president of the Wisconsin District Attorney's Association. After his time as district attorney, he became well known for representing labor unions in Brown County in the 1930s. He practiced law with his brother Francis Evrard in Green Bay, first with Sheridan, Evans and Merrill. They then formed their own firm, which was called Evrard & Evrard, but would later go on to become Evrard, Evrard, Duffy, Holman & Faulds. He also was a political lobbyist, most notably for the Wisconsin fishing industry on Lake Superior and Lake Michigan. He was recognized by the Brown County Bar Association in 1966 for his 50th anniversary as a practicing lawyer and was awarded a lifetime membership in the Marquette Alumni Association, among other honors. Green Bay Packers Evrard was a local Green Bay civic leader and sports fan who has been identified as one of the key contributors to the development of the Green Bay Packers franchise, especially when it came to fundraising. He was elected the second president of the Green Bay Football Corporation after his predecessor Andrew B. Turnbull stepped down. He served for just one season from June 27, 1928 to August 1, 1929, although he had also a member of the board of directors throughout the early 1920s and served as the Packers official lawyer until 1929, when he was replaced by Gerald Francis Clifford. As a member of the board, he chaired the sales committee in 1924 and 1925, focusing on selling box season tickets. Under Evrard's leadership as president, the Packers went 6-4-3 during the 1928 season, earning a fourth-place finish in the National Football League standings. He stepped down after the 1928 season and was succeeded as president by Dr. W. Webber Kelly. Although often overlooked, Evrard's contributions as a team executive were significant to the early development of the Green Bay Packers. Personal life Evrard's brother Francis was his legal partner for many years and served on the Brown County Board of Supervisors from 1938 to 1950 representing the Green Bay area. His sister Pauline was a Green Bay teacher, principal, and librarian for 53 years for various public and private schools. His other sister Alma lived on and maintained the family farm for her entire life. Evrard married Margaret Grasser and had two children: John R. Evrard and Emily Culligan (). John would go on to become a prominent doctor and professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at Brown University Medical School (now known as Alpert Medical School). Evrard was an active Catholic, serving in the local Knights of Columbus Council 617 and was a noted collector of firearms, glassware, and wood carvings, among other items. He suffered a number of heart attacks in the early 1970s that limited his mobility. He died on March 21, 1974.

History  The term ‚Äúgenetic alteration agent‚Äù first appears in a 2016 work plan by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) describing a tender for contracts to develop genetically modified plant viruses for an approach involving their dispersion into the environment. The prefixing of ‚Äúhorizontal environmental‚Äù to the former to generate the acronym HEGAA was first used in a 2018 scientific publication. The acronym HEGAA or its plural HEGAAs has subsequently been used in scientific defence and general media.  General usage  Agents such as pathogens, symbionts or synthetic protein assemblages that can be acquired through horizontal transmission in the environment can potentially be engineered to become HEGAAs. This would be achieved using biotechnology methods to confer to them the capacity to alter nucleotides in the chromosomes of infected individuals through sequence-specific editing systems like CRISPR, ZFNs or TALENs. No known infectious agent naturally has the capacity to gene edit eukaryotes in a manner that can be flexibly targeted to specific sequences (distinct from substantially random natural processes like retroviral integration). By definition, HEGAA induced gene editing events are intended to occur outside of contained facilities such as laboratories or hospitals. While genetically modified viruses with CRISPR editing have been successfully used as research tools in laboratories or for gene therapy in clinical settings, all gene editing events are intended to physically occur within contained facilities. By contrast, HEGAAs for their intended mode of action relies on inducing gene editing events that occur largely or exclusively in the environment. Where HEGAAs are engineered to target obligate sexually reproducing species they can usefully be thought of being of two types:- * Somatic-HEGAAs: all genetic alterations introduced by gene editing of the host's genome do not impact tissues that can ultimately generate germline cells. Consequently, no genetic alterations arising as a consequence of gene editing events are inherited by the offspring of infected individuals. Applications using somatic-HEGAAs are intended to only manipulate traits of the individual they have infected. * Germline-HEGAAs: genetic alterations introduced by gene editing impact somatic cells and also cell lineages from which germline cells can be ultimately generated (e.g. sperm, oocytes, pollen, ovules, zygotes or seeds). Consequently, alterations arising as a consequence of gene editing events can potentially be inherited by the offspring of any infected individuals. Applications using germline-HEGAAs share the same potential to manipulate traits in the individual they have infected, but also have the capacity to alter the genetic material of subsequent generations through inheritance of gene edits. Note that the detectable presence of HEGAAs in sperm, oocytes, pollen, ovules or seeds is not a necessary requirement for germline-HEGAAs, as transient infection of cell lineages from which they ultimately arise is sufficient. Where HEGAAs are engineered to target host species that can reproduce asexually, for example vegetatively reproducing plants, the above distinctions are largely no longer meaningful. Despite an expanding number of techniques which employ engineered infectious agents to alter the genetic material of a second species, often involving genetically modified viruses, only a very small minority rely on gene editing events occurring in the environment. Furthermore, while there are a number of proposed applications which rely on the intentional dispersion of genetically modified infectious agents in the environment, only those where gene editing occurs are considered HEGAAs. Consequently, proposed applications of viral immuno-contraception, transmissible vaccines, and agricultural field transient expression systems are not examples of HEGAA approaches, because none currently involve gene editing. HEGAAs are only those agents that are proposed for applications that require both horizontal acquisition (infection) and gene editing events that are intended to occur in the environment. No HEGAAs have been intentionally dispersed into the environment, though some are reportedly in development.  HEGAAs in development  = Insect Allies program = Horizontal Environmental Genetic Alteration Agents is agricultural technology currently being developed by DARPA to ensure long term food security. It is under research in DARPA known as the Insect Allies project. On a high level, insects serve as vectors to \\"infect\\" crops with a virus to alter their genes to become more resilient against pests, weeds and climate changes.  HEGAA like scenarios in fiction  Fictional plagues of engineered pathogens have been a feature of science fiction literature considerably prior to the advent of targetable gene editing systems. However, despite informed conjecture in media sources or reports on HEGAA like scenarios, there have been few in a fictional context. An example of a HEGAA like scenario is a storyline in the season 10 of The X-files, with a virus engineered to contain a CRISPR system targeted to disrupt the sequence of the human adenosine deaminase gene. Gene editing of the virus is triggered in the environment as a means to destroy the human immune system in the fictional story.

Manabe, in poor health, resigned after the 33rd move. Later that day, he confided to his colleague Hiroshi Kobayashi that he had come up with the B-42 move and believed he might have won had he played it. However, he feared this would extend the match against Toyoshima and felt he could not endure a longer game. When he was later interviewed, Toyoshima acknowledged that the move would indeed have required a long time to formulate a response. Kobayashi did not appreciate the move at the time, but his conversations with Isao Nakata about the potential move began to draw public attention. On November 27, a wake was held for Manabe. Simultaneously, a game position identical to Toyishima's match was reached in the C2 ranking match between Yasuaki Murayama and Nobuyuki ≈åuchi. ≈åuchi, playing White (gote), played Manabe's ... B-42. ≈åuchi would later claim he was not aware of the move's relationship to Manabe's last game. Much as Manabe had predicted, Murayama took over 110 minutes to respond to B-42. Though Murayama ultimately won the match, when ≈åuchi was later told about Manabe's game with Toyoshima, he said \\"I should have won.\\" Amazed at the move's recurrence during Manabe's wake, Kobayashi claimed it was a kind of miracle. The coincidence quickly became a topic of conversation in the Shogi world, and the move soon became known as the \\"splendid, phantom move\\" (Âπª„ÅÆÂ¶ôÊâã, Maboroshi no my≈çshu).

It was designed by Colonial Architect James Barnet and built from 1875 to 1888. The original building was built by a Mr. Johnson, with the second-story addition in 1888 added by Samuel Bought. It is also known as Richmond Telegraph and Post Office. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 23 June 2000.  History  The lower Hawkesbury was home to the Dharug people. The proximity to the Nepean River and South Creek qualifies it as a key area for food resources for indigenous groups. The Dharug and Darkinjung people called the river Deerubbin and it was a vital source of food and transport. Governor Arthur Phillip explored the local area in search of suitable agricultural land in 1789 and discovered and named the Hawkesbury River after Baron Hawkesbury. This region played a significant role in the early development of the colony with European settlers established here by 1794. Situated on fertile floodplains and well known for its abundant agriculture, Green Hills (as it was originally called) supported the colony through desperate times. However, frequent flooding meant that the farmers along the riverbanks were often ruined. Governor Lachlan Macquarie replaced Governor Bligh, taking up duty on 1 January 1810. Under his influence the colony prospered. His vision was for a free community, working in conjunction with the penal colony. He implemented an unrivalled public works program, completing 265 public buildings, establishing new public amenities and improving existing services such as roads. Under his leadership Hawkesbury district thrived. He visited the district on his first tour and recorded in his journal on 6/12/1810: \\"After dinner I chrestened the new townships...I gave the name of Windsor to the town intended to be erected in the district of the Green Hills...the township in the Richmond district I have named Richmond...\\" the district reminded Macquarie of those towns in England, whilst Castlereagh, Pitt Town and Wilberforce were named after English statesmen. These are often referred to as Macquarie's Five Towns. Their localities, chiefly Windsor and Richmond, became more permanent with streets, town square and public buildings. With the Hawkesbury area being notoriously flood prone, the five towns were established to provide security and accommodation to those settlers whose farms were exposed to flooding from the Nepean, Hawkesbury and Georges Rivers, and to act as depots for shipments of grain and produce to and from the district. Richmond became a focal point in the region as an important market town and social centre. Between 1819 and 1857 the region remained flood free and experienced a peak in prosperity, with the town growing steadily as a result. During this time the Hawkesbury region provided a substantial part of the agricultural supplies to the colony. Despite the decline of the farming communities in the later Victorian period, Richmond remained an important service centre within the region, and continued to grow into the twentieth century. Mail was delivered to Richmond three times per week from 1830 where the local constable would deliver it on a voluntary basis. The first post office was officially established in Richmond in 1844, with a telegraph office later operating out of the railway station. In , the residents of Richmond petitioned for a new post office to be built. The new office, designed by Colonial Architect James Barnet, was opened in October 1875. Originally a one- storey office costing ¬£1,479, the colonnade around the building was added in 1879, with stables and other additions constructed in 1882. The original form of the ground floor suggests that part of this space was initially used as a residence for the postmaster. A second storey was added soon after to provide additional residential space, being completed in August 1888 at a cost of ¬£869. The Georgian Revival style infill of the ground floor colonnade was constructed in 1906. Australia Post vacated the building and moved to a shopfront across the road in 1998-99.  Description  Richmond Post Office is a two-story English bond, Victorian Italianate building of struck trowelled clinker brick, with a hipped slate roof to the main building and lead ridge capping. The roof is punctuated by two double brick and render chimneys to the southwestern side, and a single brick and render chimney to the centre southeastern side of the main building. Attached to the rear of the building are two single-storey brick additions with hipped corrugated steel roofs. They extend over a former service wing to the northwest side and later toilet facilities to the southeast side. The additions appear to have occurred in two stages, the northwest section being extended later under a separate corrugated steel hipped roof, with a much later brick and fibre cement sheet shed attachment to the end. The two lots of additions are separated by a covered walkway at centre, supported by timber posts, with a later concrete floor. There is a first floor corrugated steel roofed verandah that wraps around the front facade and halfway down both sides, supported by green painted decorative cast iron posts, with lace brackets and valance. The posts rest on the upper floor verandah balustrade, formed by the rendered and cream painted entablature with dentil detailing, to the ground floor colonnade.

History In the 1630s, there were ideas being proposed between Duke Jacob Kettler and the King of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, John II Casimir Vasa for Polish colonization of Venezuela. Polish ships had explored settlements within the Caribbean and tried on four occasions to establish a colony on the nearby island of Tobago, however the attempt of a colony failed and all plans to establish a colony in Venezuela faltered.Polonia y Venezuela: Historia y actualidad (in Spanish) In 1787, Polish King Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski hosted future Venezuelan military leader and revolutionary, Francisco de Miranda for a few days in Kani√≥w (in present day Ukraine) while Miranda was traveling Europe. During the Venezuelan War of Independence, several Polish officers served and fought for Venezuelan independence against Spanish troops. One Polish officer, Izydor Borowski fought for Venezuelan independence and was promoted to general by Sim√≥n Bol√≠var. Soon after Venezuela obtained independence, small numbers of Poles immigrated to Venezuela, many of them scientists, clergy, architects and engineers. In 1918, Poland re-obtained its independence after World War I. That same year, Polish Chief of State J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski informed all independent nations, including Venezuela, of Poland's newly obtained independence. In 1933, Poland and Venezuela officially established diplomatic relations. Initially, Poland accredited an ambassador to Venezuela from its diplomatic legation in Mexico City, Mexico from 1933‚Äì1942 and then from Bogot√°, Colombia from 1942‚Äì1944. At the same time, Venezuela accredited its ambassador in Berlin, Germany to Poland. During World War II, both nations were part of the Allies, however, Venezuela did not participate militarily in the war and the Venezuelan government maintained diplomatic relations with the Polish government-in-exile resident in London. Soon after the end of the war, the Venezuelan government established relations with the Polish Provisional Government of National Unity in 1945. Between 1947-1949 approximately 4,000 Poles arrived to Venezuela, many were from refugee camps in Germany and a large number of former soldiers of the Polish Armed Forces. In 1948, the first Polish organization, the Union of Poles in Venezuela, was established in Caracas. In 1952, Venezuela suspended diplomatic relations with Poland when the Polish government declared a communist system within the country. Relations were re-established in 1960.Relaciones pol√≠ticas entre Polonia y Venezuela (in Spanish) In 1980, as head of the Polish (Solidarity) Trade Union, Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa paid a visit to Venezuela. In 1989, Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa paid a second visit to Venezuela where he was bestowed the Order of Francisco de Miranda by President Carlos Andr√©s P√©rez. In June 2000, a Venezuelan Delegation paid an official visit to Poland and met with Polish parliamentarians and a Senator for bilateral conferences on relations between both nations. In 2003, a Polish delegation paid a visit to Venezuela. In January 2013, during the first Summit between the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States and the European Union held in Santiago, Chile; Foreign Ministers, El√≠as Jaua and Rados≈Çaw Sikorski met and signed several bilateral cooperation agreements. During the presidential crisis in Venezuela, Poland officially recognized Juan Guaid√≥ as the interim president of Venezuela in February 2019. Bilateral relations Both nations have signed several bilateral agreements, such as an Agreement on Cultural Cooperation (1973); Agreement on Scientific and Technical Cooperation (1988); Agreement to Abolish Visas for Diplomatic and Service Passport Holders (1996) and Agreements on Economic, Energy, Infrastructure, Agricultural, Touristic and Environmental Cooperation (2013).

His first monograph, The Jews in a Polish Private Town (1992), studies social and economic history of Opat√≥w Jewry in the eighteenth century, exemplifying Jewish autonomy and identity and their crucial commercial roles in the later period of the Commonwealth. The work also sheds new light on Polish local history and Jewish microhistory. His more renowned second monograph, Jews in Poland-Lithuania in the Eighteenth Century (2004), is an essential revisionist work in early modern European Jewish historiography. It examines the life of the understudied, but extremely important, East Central European Jewry‚Äîworld's largest Jewish community at the time, and argues for their mentalit√© of chosenness and their particularities on the path towards modernity. Another achievement is the groundbreaking The YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe published in 2008. 450 leading scholars from the world have contributed to this decade-long project, of which Hundert served as the editor-in-chief. The work includes more than 1,800 entries and covers all aspects of Eastern European Jewish experiences from the Middle Ages to the late twentieth century. The searchable version of the encyclopedia was launched in 2010. Besides, he edited an essay collection on the development of scholarship on Hasidism in 1991 and co-compiled a bibliography on Eastern European Jewish historiography in 1984.

Discovered in 1981 and put online in 2017, the Hebron field is estimated to contain over 700 million barrels of producible hydrocarbons. The field is contained within a fault- bounded Mesozoic rift basin called the Jeanne d'Arc Basin.  Location  The Hebron Oil Field is located off the coast of eastern Canada in Newfoundland in the Grand Banks. It resides 350 kilometers southeast of St. John in the Jeanne d'Arc Basin which covers roughly 8000 square kilometers. It is part of a larger oil field structure consisting of the Hibernia, White Rose, and Terra Nova oil fields. The main oil rig sits at 92 meters of water. Hebron Oil Field Location  Tectonic overview of the Jeanne d'Arc Basin  The Hebron Oil field formed as result of the early Mesozoic break up Pangea. Prior to break up the northern part of Africa was connected to what is now Newfoundland. At the break up a passive rift margin formed due to the creation of the Atlantic Ocean. Three major phases of Mesozoic Rifting phases occurred that affected the formation of the Hebron Oil field and Jeanne d'Arc Basin. =Tethys phase= The Tehtys phase occurred in the late Triassic and continued in the Early Jurassic. During this time the Jeanne d'Arc Basin was formed due to rifting forming half grabens as major crustal detachment occurred. This phase is most important phase in the construction of the Jeanne d'Arc Basin as it gave it its size. =North Atlantic phase= The North Atlantic phase occurred in the late Jurassic to early Cretaceous. The basin formed in the Tethys phase experienced faulting with a North to South trend. The southern boundary of the Jeanne d'Arc Basin was formed by the reactivation of the Egret Fault. The central ridge of the basin was formed along the Voyager Fault. After this period of faulting the Avalon Uplift, a series of rift basins, occurred that allowed for uplift and erosion to occur within the basin. During this time the Atlantic Ocean continued to expand along the Newfoundland Transform Fault Zone. During the early Cretaceous in the Kimmeridgian the source rock, called the Egret Source Rock, was deposited in the basin which provided the basin oil fields a source for their oil, mainly the Hebron. =Labrador phase= The Labrador phase occurred from the middle to late Cretaceous. This rifting phase began with northwest to southwest trending faults fragmenting the basin. One of the major faults formed was the Trans Basin Fault Zone which formed some of the traps to the adjacent oil fields. The major event happening at the end of this period was the deposition of the Ben Nevis formation which forms the main reservoir for the Hebron Oil Field. The Tethys, North Atlantic, and Labrador Phases were all followed by periods of tectonic subsidence and post rift thermal subsidence. At the end of the rifting phase, a passive rift margin phase occurred allowing for new depositional areas within the basin. This shows the stratigraphy of the Hebron fault block within the Jeanne d'Arc Basin. The four main reservoirs which are depleted are labeled.  Stratigraphy  The Hebron Oil Field was deposited from the Triassic to the Late Cretaceous. Sediments continued to be deposited after the Cretaceous to create the surface structure of the field. Five major periods of deposition are what created the field and its residing structures. =Triassic to Middle Jurassic= This period begins with the Mesozoic break up of Pangea and the beginning of the basin formation in the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. In the Late Triassic sediments begin to be deposited in what is now the Jeanne d'Arc Basin during a series of Mesozoic rifting events. During the lower Jurassic period, a marine environment existed in the area allowing for the deposition of interbedded carbonates and evaporates. =Oxfordian - Middle Kimmeridgian= During this upper Jurassic period, the deposition of oolitc limestones, shales and carbonated cemented sandstones were deposited in the basin. The deposition of these sandstones creates ideal seismic reflectors to aid in the understanding of formations deep within the Jeanne d'Arc Basin. In the middle Kimmeridgian the deposition of the Egret source rock occurred. This source rock is composed of marls and organic rich laminated shales. After the deposition a period of uplift and erosion occurred due to the further expansion and rifting of the Atlantic Ocean that forms an unconformity at the top if the middle Kimmeridgian deposits. =Middle Kimmeridgian to Valanginian= This period began with the deposition of the Jeanne d'Arc Sandstone formation which provides a minor reservoir to the Hebron field. Sandstones were deposited from the southwest of the Grand Banks. This deposition also led to the creation of the Hibernia sandstone reservoir that is also produced in the Hebron Oil field. However, it expresses poor reservoir quality. =Hauterivian to Upper Barremian= This period began with minor uplift resulting in erosion after the Hibernia sandstone was deposited. After the uplift and erosion period, overlaying sandstanes, shales and limestones were deposited into the Hebron field. Subsidence and faulting continued to occur in the basin during this time. =Middle Cretaceous= The main reservoir for the Hebron Oil field was deposited. The Ben Nevis Sandstone contains roughly 80% of the producible hydrocarbons for Hebron. It was formed in a marine shore face environment and is 80 to 120 meters thick. The deep part of the Ben Nevis contains good quality sands, carbonate cemented sandstones and has good reservoir properties. It has a porosity ranging from 16% to 30% and a permeability of 360 millidarcies. The shallow section contains silty, bioturbated sands with poor reservoir quality.  Reservoir and trapping characteristics  The Hebron field is separated into three distinct fault blocks: The Hebron Fault Block, The West Ben Nevis Fault Block and the Ben Nevis Fault Block. Reservoir reside in each of these due to the deposition of the Egret Source Rock in the middle Kimmeridgian. The Hebron Fault block, also called \\"pool one\\", contains the majority of the producible hydrocarbons for the field in the Ben Nevis Sandstone formation. It contains heavy oil but has good porosity and permeability. The other two fault blocks or pools are located at deeper depths and express poor reservoir quality. They are still produced but prove to be engineering challenges when it comes to extraction methods. = Trapping mechanism = During the late Cretaceous major faulting occurred due to the continued rifting of the Atlantic Ocean at the Newfoundland Transform Fault Zone. The lower reservoirs, Hibernia and Jeanne d'Arc formations, are trapped along the up dips of Anticlines and faulted tilted blocks. The main reservoir, the Ben Nevis, is trapped due to a stratagraphic trap occurring above the sandstone and trapped on the sides due to the Egret Fault.  Production history and the Hebron rig  Originally discovered in 1981 as a part of the Jeanne d'Arc Basin exploration, the Hebron field is the fourth production field to be put online in the basin. Construction of the rig began in 2012 and completed in 2017. The field is estimated to have over 700 million barrels of recoverable hydrocarbons. The Hebron rig is rated to produce an average of 150,000 barrels a day for at least 30 years. This is the second largest field in the Jeanne d'Arc Basin and contains relatively heavy oil between 18 and 25 API.

Duvalier broke off relations first after the United States urged member-states of the Organisation of American States to cut ties with Cuba after the Cuban Revolution. In 1977, despite having no official diplomatic ties, the Caribbean Nations signed Cuba‚ÄìHaiti Maritime Boundary Agreement setting the official maritime border in the Windward Passage. Jean-Bertrand Aristide and Fidel Castro agreed to reestablish relations in 1997 and later that year, a Cuban Embassy opened up in Port-au-Prince. Aid and development Since Hurricane Georges, Cuba has sent medical aid to Haiti in the form of doctors, education and medical supplies. Over 3,000 doctors have been sent to Haiti since 1998 and have educated 550 Haitians at Latin American Medical School in Havana with 567 Haitians currently studying at ELAM as of 2010. From 1998-2010, Cuba performed over 207,000 Surgeries, restored eye sight to 45,000, 14.6 Million patient- doctor consultations, taught 100,000 how to read and helped in the birth of 100,000 children.

She published the only Chinese-language children's magazine in China and Hong Kong during World War II, and later served as Vice President of the Guangdong Writers Association. Considered a pioneer of children's literature in Hong Kong, she received the Best Artist Award from the Hong Kong Arts Development Council in 2009.  Biography  Huang was born in British Hong Kong in 1920. She studied at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou (Canton), Guangdong, China, and received her master's degree from the Teachers College, Columbia University in New York, the United States. In 1941, she established the bi- monthly magazine Modern Children (Êñ∞ÂÖíÁ´•), the only Chinese-language children's magazine in China and Hong Kong that was published during World War II. In \\"Letters to Big Sister Wan\\", a distinguished feature in the magazine, Huang, using the pen name Sister Wan (Èõ≤ÂßêÂßê), corresponded with young readers. She encouraged them to study and helped them cope with life in wartime, when Hong Kong and much of China fell under Japanese occupation. After the end of World War II, the British authorities closed Huang's magazine in 1948 for its alleged sympathy for the Chinese Communist cause. She moved to Guangzhou and stayed in mainland China after the Communist takeover in 1949. She served as vice-president of the Guangdong Writers Association in the People's Republic of China. Huang moved back to Hong Kong in the late 1980s. Still active in the literary circle, she also became widely known as the mother-in-law of Lo Hoi- sing, the political activist who helped Chinese dissidents escape China after the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. Lo was the husband of Chow Mat-mat (Zhou Mimi), who also became a well known children's writer under her mother's influence. Huang died on 20 September 2018, at the age of 98. Selected works and awards Huang published more than 60 books over a career spanning more than seven decades. Her works include: *The Strange Red Star (Â•áÁï∞ÁöÑÁ¥ÖÊòü, 1956) *Flowers in Full Bloom (Ëä±ÂÖíÊúµÊúµÈñã, 1966) *Daughter of the Moon (Êúà‰∫ÆÁöÑÂ•≥ÂÖí, 1982) *A Golden Childhood (ÈáëËâ≤Á´•Âπ¥, 1985) She twice won the Hong Kong Chinese Literature Prize for Children's Literature, for The Smart Dog and the Ever-Changing Cat (ËÅ∞ÊòéÁãóÂíåÁôæËÆäË≤ì) and Strange Adventure of the Cat QQ (Ë≤ìÂí™QQÁöÑÂ•áÈÅá).

It was designed by John Stewart Barney and Stockton B. Colt of the architectural firm of Barney & Colt for Dr. Thomas Addis Emmet, a prominent gynecological surgeon who was also an author of books on Irish history. He was the son of Emmet John Patten (1796 - 1842), a chemistry professor at the University of Virginia who was born in Ireland and was the nephew of Robert Emmet, the advocate for Irish independence. Emmet Building in 1913, photograph by Irving Underhill The building was constructed between 1911 and 1912, replacing Emmet's own townhouse at 89 Madison, and four other properties at 91-95 Madison which he had acquired. Although the building's primary function was to serve commercial tenants in the area north of Madison Square Park,Herman, Margaret (February 20, 2018) \\"95 Madison Avenue (The Emmett Building) Designation Report\\" New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission Emmet had a penthouse apartment that included custom designed furnishings by Keeble, Ltd. It was served by a private elevator. He moved in with his 51-year old son, his nurse, and his cook, Koricki Myamiata, and lived in the building for more than 40 years. Commercial space was located on the lower floors of the building; early tenants included wholesale silk merchants William Openhym & Sons and the Manhattan Shirt Company. Architecture The neo-Renaissance building building is adorned in terracotta Gothic Revival ornamentation. The exterior of the first two floors used limestone and were adorned with cast-iron ornamentation and green marble-clad pillars. The lower story exterior features Medieval figures, canopies, and gargoyles, as well as \\"cavaliers and courtesans\\". Exterior columns span between the fourth and eleventh floors. The lobby was adorned with Sienna and Numida marble, mosaic floors, and bronze elevator doors and surround. The facade underwent restoration in 1991. The fifth edition of the AIA Guide to New York City speculates that the design of the building may have been inspired by the Woolworth Building. Landmarking The Emmet Building, as well as the Beaux Arts architecture James NoMad hotel (formerly the Seville Hotel) at 22 East 29th Street across the street from it, were designated as landmarks by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission on March 6, 2018. Landmarks Presveration Commission chairperson Meenakshi Srinivasan said, \\"These elegant buildings are not only distinctive and exemplary on their own, but together they represent an era of change and development in the area north of Madison Square during the early 20th century.\\" The family that owns it has been renovating the building, and, after initially supporting the landmarking, later expressed displeasure with how the Landmark Preservation Commission operates and its bureaucracy.

The North Vietnamese made some minor territorial gains and suffered heavy losses, while South Vietnamese forces were severely weakened by the fighting. Background Southwest of ƒê·∫°i L·ªôc District was the vast mountain district of Duc Duc. Only in the extreme northeast region of Duc Duc did South Vietnamese officials maintain full-time residence. The area west of the S√¥ng Thu B·ªìn, which included part of the \\"Arizona Territory\\", was insecure and sparsely populated, as were the southern and western reaches of Duc Duc. Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) influence extended south to the N√¥ng S∆°n coal mines in the narrow canyon of the S√¥ng Thu B·ªìn, about 10 kilometers from the district seat. Here at a place called Da Trach, not far north of the major operating base of the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) 2nd Division, the ARVN maintained a garrison with outposts manned by Regional Force (RF) units and Popular Force (PF) platoons. Duc Duc was the other principal entrance to the Qu·∫£ng Nam lowlands from the PAVN-held highlands of Qu·∫£ng Nam and Qu·∫£ng T√≠n Provinces. The ARVN 3rd Infantry Division was responsible for the defense of Qu·∫£ng Nam and that part of Qu·∫£ng T√≠n lying within the Qu·∫ø S∆°n Valley. In June 1974, General Nguyen Duy Hinh, the 3rd Division commander, had his 2nd Infantry Regiment operating in the Go Noi () and Duc Duc areas while the 78th Ranger Battalion held Da Trach. Da Trach, a battalion-sized camp, was a strongpoint situated on a prominent hill about above the S√¥ng Thu B·ªìn south of the subsector headquarters at Duc Duc. It had been quiet at Da Trach and around the outposts manned by one RF company and seven PF platoons. Three of these outposts were in the hills and along the river south of Da Trach, while the others were in the valley of the Khe Le stream (), which flowed into the S√¥ng Thu B·ªìn northeast of Da Trach post. Also located in the valley was the 4th Company, 146th RF Battalion, which had its 80-man garrison in the Ap Ba hamlet group (), along the road that twisted eastward over the Deo Le Pass to Qu·∫ø S∆°n. Possession of the Khe Le Valley would give the PAVN not only another flanking approach to the ARVN defenses in the Qu·∫ø S∆°n Valley but would provide access to the several good trails into Duy Xuy√™n District, bypassing the defenses in Duc Duc. The 78th Ranger Battalion at Da Trach, with about 360 men, was scheduled for retraining at the Ranger Training Center, and on 17 July 1974, the 3rd Battalion, 56th Infantry, arrived to execute the relief. The infantry battalion pulled in on trucks just before dark. The relief was to take place at noon the next day, but the 78th had withdrawn most of its outposts and was bivouacked for the night in the village. Although unfamiliar with the layout of the camp defenses, the 3rd Battalion, with three of its four companies, assumed the responsibility. The strength of the 3rd Battalion, 56th Infantry, was only about 360 men, but its 2nd Company was not in the camp; rather, it had set up outposts on two hills along the east bank of the S√¥ng Thu B·ªìn. One rifle platoon was on Cua Tan Mountain() directly across the river from Da Trach, and the rest of the company was at Khuong Que (), to the north. PAVN Military Region 5 was responsible for all of Qu·∫£ng Nam Province to the Kon Tum Province boundary, its campaign plan for the summer and autumn of 1974 involved elements of three regular divisions, a separate infantry brigade, and several independent regiments. Objectives ranged from central Qu·∫£ng Nam to southern Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i Provinces. To cope with the tactical and logistical requirements of this offensive, the PAVN leadership activated a new headquarters, the 3rd Corps. Operational in June, the corps began concentrating resources for the Qu·∫£ng Nam campaign. The 36th Regiment was formed in the spring of 1974 from replacement groups sent from North Vietnam into the mountains of western Duc Duc. It was a light regiment, having only two infantry battalions, an antiaircraft machine gun company, light artillery, and administrative support units. On 10 July, a week before the planned relief of the 78th Ranger Battalion at Da Trach, the 36th Regiment moved undetected into assembly areas close to ARVN outposts around Da Trach. Also on the move toward Da Trach were elements of all three regiments of the 2nd Division, the 1st, 31st, and 38th, plus the 10th Sapper Battalion, division artillery, and batteries of Military Region 5 artillery. Battle Shortly after midnight on 18 July, PAVN artillery, rockets and mortar rounds began exploding on the defenses and outposts of Da Trach. A relatively weak attack by the PAVN 2nd Battalion, 36th Regiment, on the camp's main defenses was beaten back with heavy losses to the PAVN and light casualties to the defenders, but contact with the 2nd Company, 3rd Battalion, 56th Infantry, outposts at Khuong Que and Cua Tan was lost before daybreak. By that time, the 4th Company, 146th RF Battalion at Ap Ba had been attacked and overrun, and the survivors were trying to escape through the mountains toward Duc Duc headquarters. Shelling of the main camp meanwhile had stopped, and the attackers regrouped for another assault. The 2nd Battalion, 1st Infantry Regiment and a battalion of the 31st Infantry Regiment, joined the two battalions of the 36th Regiment for the next attempt. As the reconnaissance platoon and the 4th Company, 3rd Battalion, 56th Infantry, tried to retake a lost outpost south of the camp, they were stopped by intense artillery and automatic weapons fire, which killed the company commander and the battalion commander of the 78th Rangers. The PAVN resumed infantry assaults on the camp, and the 3rd Battalion commander, who had assumed command of the 78th Rangers as well, reported the situation critical. The camp's radio was knocked out before noon, and all contact was lost with whatever PF outposts remained in action. Simultaneously with their assault on Da Trach, the PAVN began the Battle of Th∆∞·ª£ng ƒê·ª©c to the northwest, stretching the ARVN forces in the area. PAVN tanks were sighted about 5km southwest of the camp, and the Republic of Vietnam Air Force (RVNAF) began to provide fire support to the defenders. Heavy artillery, rocket, and mortar fire continued, augmented by antiaircraft guns, up to 37 mm, used in direct fire. Contact was also lost with the 4th Company, 78th Rangers, and the two-gun platoon of 105 mm howitzers in the camp had been knocked out of action. At mid-afternoon, the five-battalion PAVN assault, which by this time included the 10th Sapper Battalion against the northern sector, had carried through the southwest defense line. With all bunkers and fighting positions demolished by a bombardment of more than 5,000 rounds, the survivors of the 3rd and 78th Battalions withdrew and the PAVN rounded up civilians in the hamlets and villages; about 7,500 of them would be moved to PAVN controlled regions of Duc Duc District. General Hinh moved a forward division command post to ƒê·∫°i L·ªôc and ordered the 2nd Infantry Regiment to deploy immediately to Duc Duc and relieve the defenders at Da Trach. Operation Quang Trung 4/74 had begun. Only the 3rd Battalion, 2nd Infantry, was immediately available; the 1st Battalion remained at Firebase Baldy in the Qu·∫ø S∆°n Valley, and the 2nd was still in Qu·∫£ng T√≠n Province. Orders were sent to both battalions to move immediately to ƒê·∫°i L·ªôc District, and the 3rd Battalion moved from Da Nang to Hill 55 in northwestern ƒêi·ªán B√†n District to protect the deployment of artillery to support Duc Duc. General Hinh saw as his first priority securing the bridge over the S√¥ng Thu B·ªìn, north of Duc Duc base and over which all division elements would have to pass en route to the battlefield. He ordered the 1st Battalion, 2nd Infantry, just arrived from Firebase Baldy, with the 2nd Troop, 11th Armored Cavalry, to secure the bridge and had the 3rd Battalion, 2nd Infantry, on 18 July move to Duc Duc base. His staff went to work immediately drafting the tactical plan for Quang Trung 4/74 with the objective of retaking Da Trach. The bridge secured, the 1st Battalion joined the 3rd, and both moved south of Duc Duc, prepared to continue on toward Da Trach. By nightfall on the 18th, the 2nd Battalion, 2nd Infantry, had also moved to Duc Duc base, as had a battery of 155 mm howitzers. Meanwhile, a battery of 175 mm guns moved into firing positions in the Qu·∫ø S∆°n Valley, within range of Duc Duc. These ARVN artillery positions soon received heavy and accurate counterbattery fire. The commander of the 2nd Infantry, Lt. Col. Vu Ngoc Huong, having assumed tactical command of all ARVN forces in the Duc Duc-Da Trach battlefield, had communications with only two platoons of the original Da Trach defense force by the evening of 18 July. The PAVN resumed its coordinated offensive in Qu·∫£ng Nam in the pre-dawn hours of 19 July. A salvo of 35 122 mm rockets fell on Da Nang Air Base, damage to RVNAF operations was slight, although 16 people died and over 70 were wounded many of whom were civilians and military dependents. In the morning Duc Duc received 45 rocket and mortar rounds. PAVN 130 mm guns hit an ARVN 105 mm battery and the 2nd Infantry's command post. Meanwhile, north of ƒê·∫°i L·ªôc on Route 540, the 370th RF Company repulsed a strong enemy attempt to interdict the ARVN line of communication, killing 30 of the attackers and capturing many weapons. With the PAVN fire erupting in their rear, the 1st and 3rd Battalions, 2nd Infantry, advanced south from Duc Duc toward Da Trach and by noon reported securing their initial objectives without opposition. The 1st Battalion was on Ky Vi Mountain (), southeast of Duc Duc base, and the 3rd Battalion was on Hill 284 (), past Khuong Que and at the entrance of Khe Le Valley. The 2nd Battalion was in reserve. The plan called for the 3rd Battalion to continue the attack to Cua Tan Mountain, across the river from Da Trach, and for the 1st Battalion to attack south, first seizing Hill 454 () and then descending into the Khe Le Valley at the village of Ap Ba. The feasibility of the plan came into question, however, when the last contact with the Da Trach defenders on 19 July revealed that the command group and two companies of the 78th Rangers were under heavy attack on the hill at Cua Tan. After seizing Da Trach, the PAVN placed infantry battalions and antiaircraft guns in the hills above the valley, awaiting the arrival of the ARVN 2nd Infantry. The RVNAF struck hard at these forces on the 18th and 19th and caused heavy casualties, but the PAVN could not be dislodged. By the afternoon of 19 July, the 1st Battalion, 2nd Infantry was in contact with elements of the PAVN 36th Regiment on Ky Vi Mountain and on Hill 238 (), to the west. The RVNAF flew 18 attack sorties in support, killing 75 PAVN infantrymen and destroying a mortar, but the ARVN advance had to be halted. Suspecting a trap in the Khe Le Valley, General Hinh ordered the 2nd Infantry to stop and sent reconnaissance patrols forward. Correctly anticipating that the PAVN's Qu·∫£ng Nam campaign had only begun and that more forces would be required to deal with it, I Corps commander General Ng√¥ Quang Tr∆∞·ªüng on 19 July ordered the 12th Ranger Group to move from Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i to Qu·∫£ng Nam. The 37th Ranger Battalion, already in Da Nang for rest and retraining, moved to Hieu Duc District on 20 July. That day, the 6th Infantry, 2nd Division, began relieving the other two battalions of the 12th Ranger Group in ƒê·ª©c Ph·ªï and M·ªô ƒê·ª©c Districts in Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i Province, and the 12th began to move north. By 22 July, the PAVN command at Da Trach apparently realised that the ARVN 2nd Infantry Regiment was not advancing into the trap in the Khe Le Valley. Plans were accordingly changed; the rest of the PAVN 1st Regiment was ordered to Da Trach to attack the ARVN 2nd Regiment in the hills south of Duc Duc, while the 38th Regiment was to move through the hills above the valley toward Go Noi and ƒêi·ªán B√†n District. On 24 July the 1st Regiment began moving into the attack, and the 38th Regiment started deploying east. General Tr∆∞·ªüng was gathering more forces also, he ordered the 29th and 39th Ranger Battalions, 12th Ranger Group, newly arrived from Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i Province, to displace west of Go Noi Island, and he directed that the 1st Division in Th·ª´a Thi√™n Province and the 2nd Division in Qu·∫£ng Ng√£i each prepare one regiment for deployment to Qu·∫£ng Nam on 24 hours' notice. On 24 July, the ARVN 2nd Infantry established its command post 700 meters north of Nui Song Suo, the first hill south of Duc Duc. The 2nd Troop, 11th Armored Cavalry, was providing security for the command post. The 2nd Battalion was moving past Hill 238 and advancing on Hill 284, which had been vacated by the 3rd Battalion under strong PAVN pressure. The 3rd Battalion had withdrawn to the hill at Nui Duong Coi (), above a lake between it and Duc Duc Subsector, where the 1st Battalion was in reserve. The 1st Battalion, 56th Infantry, attached to the 2nd Infantry, was protecting the regiment's right flank west of the S√¥ng Thu B·ªìn. The attack of the PAVN 1st Regiment met the advancing ARVN 2nd Battalion, 2nd Infantry, on the slopes of Hill 284. The two leading companies of the 2nd Battalion broke under a withering attack. By early afternoon on 24 July, the PAVN attack reached the 3rd Battalion on Nui Duong Coi. The battalion held and with good air and artillery support inflicted heavy casualties on the PAVN, but the assault continued, the 3rd Battalion commander fell wounded, and the battalion began to break. By dusk, both forward battalions of the 2nd Infantry were badly scattered and withdrawing toward Duc Duc. The PAVN attack reached into the rear area of the 2nd Infantry and forced the command post to withdraw 1,000 meters. Seeing a disaster in the making for the 2nd Infantry, General Hinh had his division reconnaissance company lifted in by helicopter to help defend the command post. Reaching the command post late in the afternoon, the reconnaissance company was soon joined by the 37th Ranger Battalion and two troops of the 11th Armored Cavalry which General Hinh had sent overland to reinforce the beleaguered 2nd Infantry. On the morning of 25 July, while an attempt was being made to regroup the scattered 3rd Battalion, General Hinh ordered the 12th Ranger Group to bring its three battalions forward and relieve the 2nd Infantry. As this relief was beginning, General Tr∆∞·ªüng had the 1st Division send its 54th Infantry Regiment to Qu·∫£ng Nam for attachment to the 3rd Division. The fighting in the hills south of Duc Duc took a heavy toll of the PAVN 1st Regiment and the 2nd Division had to withdraw it from action, just as the ARVN 3rd Division had to relieve the 2nd Infantry. The PAVN 38th Regiment was ordered to stop its eastward movement and come to the relief of the 1st Regiment, while elements of the 31st Regiment still around Hau Duc in Qu·∫£ng T√≠n Province were called forward to the division base at Hi·ªáp ƒê·ª©c to prepare to assist the 1st and 38th Regiments. The PAVN plans for the 38th Regiment to move east into Go Noi were upset by the rapid ARVN deployment of the 12th Ranger Group. The battered 1st Regiment was no longer equipped to protect the rear of the 38th or its line of communication against the expected counterattacks of the three Ranger battalions of the 12th Group. Further, the PAVN soon learned of the movement of the 54th Regiment to Qu·∫£ng Nam, but they could not discover its mission or location. Considering these uncertainties, the PAVN command suspended the attack and held its gains, replacing depleted battalions with fresh ones. General Hinh had reached similar conclusions on 25 July. He declared the counterattack to retake Da Trach at an end; Quang Trung 4/74 was over and Quang Trung 8/74, an interim operation to defend the shallow positions south of Duc Duc Subsector, began. By this time virtually all of the survivors of Da Trach had made their way back to South Vietnamese lines: 64 from the 3rd Battalion, 56th Infantry; 79 from the 78th Ranger Battalion; 59 from the 4th Company, 146th RF Battalion; and 20 from the PF platoons. The 54th Infantry Regiment, arrived in Qu·∫£ng Nam on 26 July, put its headquarters at ƒêi·ªán B√†n District Town and immediately went into action. While the 1st Battalion took over a security mission in the Da Nang rocket belt near Hill 55, the 2nd and 3rd Battalions began clearing the area around Ky Chau Village on Go Noi Island. Both the 2nd and 3rd met heavy resistance and proceeded westward slowly, engaging a PAVN force on 28 July and dispersing it with heavy losses. Duc Duc and ƒê·∫°i L·ªôc were struck on 25 July and again the next day by PAVN rocket and artillery fire, but casualties were light. On 26 July, the Rangers completed their relief of the 2nd Infantry and assumed responsibility for the sector. The 21st Ranger Battalion to the east was holding Nui Van Chi, the 37th Ranger Battalion was on Hill 238, just south of Nui Song Su and the 39th Ranger Battalion was at Duc Duc base in reserve. The shattered 2nd Infantry moved west of ƒê·∫°i L·ªôc District Town along Route 4 to protect the division's right flank, while its 3rd Battalion was being reformed at the division base near Da Nang. Meanwhile the RVNAF was trying its best to blunt the PAVN attacks. The 1st Air Division flew 67 sorties on the 25th and 57 on the 26th, destroying a tank and several antiaircraft and mortar positions, striking large troop concentrations, and killing about 90 PAVN soldiers. With the withdrawal of 2d Infantry, Quang Trung 8/74 was declared over on 29 July. Quang Trung 9/74 was to begin on 30 July. The troop list had the 12th Ranger Group in contact south of Duc Duc, the 2nd Infantry on the flank west of ƒê·∫°i L·ªôc, the 54th in the Go Noi east of ƒê·∫°i L·ªôc and the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 56th Infantry in reserve in ƒê·∫°i L·ªôc District Town. The 3rd Battalion, 56th Infantry, the battalion destroyed at Da Trach, was being reformed at Da Nang, while the 78th Ranger Battalion was undergoing the same process at the D·ª•c M·ªπ Ranger Training Center in Kh√°nh H√≤a Province. On 29 July 1974, the ARVN 21st Ranger Battalion on the left flank of the Ranger positions protecting Duc Duc base came under heavy attack. Although they inflicted heavy casualties on the PAVN 36th Regiment, the Rangers were forced back about 1,000 meters to the slopes of Nui Duong Coi. The PAVN pursued, and fighting continued in the rough terrain in front of Nui Duong Coi for several days. Then on 3 August, the 36th Regiment launched a strong attack. Several Ranger positions collapsed and the commander of the 12th Ranger Group ordered the 39th Ranger Battalion to assist the 21st. After an all-day battle, the PAVN withdrew and the Rangers regained all lost ground. The RVNAF contributed greatly to the ARVN success; although Ranger casualties were high, more than 35 killed, 100 wounded, and 25 missing, the PAVN left over 200 dead on the field. While the infantry fought in the hills, the PAVN artillery slammed 280 rounds of 122 mm rockets and 100 mm gunfire into the command post of the 12th Ranger Group, casualties were light, however. Fatigued and badly depleted, the 12th Ranger Group was relieved by the 54th Infantry, 1st Division. Through August and early September, the ARVN 54th Infantry made major advances even though the PAVN reinforced the 36th Regiment with the 1st Infantry. In September, faced with a deteriorating situation north of the H·∫£i V√¢n Pass, General Tr∆∞·ªüng ordered the 54th Infantry to return to the 1st Division. General Hinh relieved the 54th with his own division's 56th Infantry. Thus, in early September, the infantrymen of the 56th Regiment returned to the hills south of Duc Duc. The 3rd Battalion took up positions on the right, on Khuong Que Hill where its 2nd Company had fought and lost the first engagement of the PAVN's Duc Duc campaign. The 1st Battalion was on the left, on Ky Vi Hill, and the 2nd Battalion was in reserve with the regimental headquarters near Duc Duc base. On 4 October the PAVN 1st Regiment, 2nd Division, launched simultaneous, heavily supported assaults on both forward battalions of the 56th Regiment. While mortar and artillery fire pounded the 3rd Battalion command post, PAVN sappers entered the headquarters perimeter and severed communications with the two forward ARVN companies. These companies, under infantry attack from the front, withdrew and were caught in a devastating crossfire from the rear and flanks. The 1st Battalion fared little better; its outposts were also overrun, but casualties were lighter. The PAVN coordinated artillery fire with great skill in this assault; a steady rain of shells kept the 56th Regiment's headquarters and the 2nd Battalion from reacting while the two forward battalions were being overrun. As soon as he was able, the regimental commander ordered the attached 21st Ranger Battalion back into the line to relieve the shattered 3rd Battalion. The PAVN 1st Regiment had accomplished its mission, but casualties were heavy, and it lacked the strength either to pursue or to consolidate its gains. The ARVN defensive line south of Duc Duc remained virtually unchanged, but the 56th Regiment was nearly out of action. Only the 2nd Battalion could put more than 300 men in the field, and the 3rd Battalion had only 200. General Hinh had to relieve the regiment again with the 12th Ranger Group. Aftermath During the summer and autumn of 1974, the ARVN 3rd Division and attached Rangers had reached exhaustion. More than 4,700 men had been killed, wounded, or were missing in the actions in and around Duc Duc in the three months since the PAVN offensive began at Da Trach on 18 July. A disproportionate number were officers and noncommissioned officers for whom no experienced replacements were available.

In the foreground: firing positions, covered chambers with ammunition niches in the parapet, and the parapet topped by a railway rail. View over the parapet toward the Fetsund Bridge, a combined rail and road bridge that the battery protected. The Fetsund Battery ( or Fetsundbatteriet) is an artillery battery in Fetsund in Viken county, Norway. Locally, the battery is also known as Vilbergfestningen 'the Vilberg fortress'. As part of the arming of Norway and the Glomma Line in the years up to 1905, a battery was installed in Fetsund for four Ehrhardt 7.5 cm and four Cockerill-Nordenfeldt Model 1904 10.5 cm field cannons from the Norwegian Field Artillery (). The installation was started in December 1898 and was completed in April 1900. It is located on the Vilberg farm on a hill west of Fetsund Station. Below the Fetsund Battery, a forward battery was built during the same period, the H√∏g√•s Battery at Fjellsrud. The battery is designed as a long arch with a low parapet with ammunition niches and shallow covered chambers for the crew. Behind the battery's left wing stood a small ammunition building, which no longer exists. From the battery there is a broad view of the center of Fetsund and the east side of the Glomma River. The purpose of the battery was to prevent any military advances southward from S√∏rumsand or northward from Fjellsrud crossing the Glomma over the Fetsund rail and road bridge. At that time, these were the only two roads from the east. County Road 170 from Aurskog was built in the 1960s after the closure of the Urskog‚ÄìH√∏land Line. On September 13, 1905, mobilization orders were issued, and the Fetsund and H√∏g√•s batteries were manned with 1,450 men from the Valdres Battalion and an squadron of militia dragoons. This is the only time the battery was mobilized. Depot camp Cannon shed (red building to the right), arsenal building (two stories, to the left), ammunition shed (in the middle), and armory at far right. In a sheltered area behind the hillside there are several storage buildings belonging to the battery. There is a cannon shed, an ammunition shed, an armory, and a regimental arsenal building that was moved here from Enebakk Church in 1907. The fact that the battery's buildings still exist and are close to their original condition makes the Fetsund Battery unique among Norway's smaller border fortifications. Later use The battery area originally extended a considerable distance forward from the battery itself in order to provide a free line of fire. When the battery no longer had any military value, the land below the battery was returned to the Vilberg farm for agricultural use, and the area between the battery and Garderveien (Farm Road) was assigned to the Armed Forces. Military buildings were built there. The facility was used by the Germans during the Second World War as a warehouse for aviation fuel. German soldiers were quartered at the Vilberg farm, located between the battery and the depot camp. Non-commissioned officers were accommodated on the second floor of the main house, and privates in a smaller house north of the farmyard. To the left, at the gate of the depot camp, there is the foundation of a smaller building. Its layout indicates that this may have been a guardhouse from the German occupation. Any small arms, equestrian equipment, and remaining cannons have been removed from the site. Bridge material The protection plan for the Fetsund Battery states that one of the buildings in the depot camp was used for storage of prefabricated military bridge material and another was used for ammunition storage. However, the plan is not clear and it confuses Buildings 0003 and 0004 in its text and images. Building 0003 is located in a blasted- out recess, whereas Building 0004 is small and exposed. It can be assumed that Building 0003 was used for ammunition storage. It is not clear whether the site was originally planned for storing bridge materials when it was established, or if this use of the depot camp was made at a later date. During the 1980s, material for a prefabricated pontoon bridge of American make for crossing the Glomma was stored partly at the installation and partly in the buildings in the depot camp. This pontoon bridge was previously stored over an extended time at Stasjonsstranda next to Fetsund Station. The property received protected status on May 6, 2004 and is regulated for public purposes. It was transferred from the Armed Forces to Municipality of Fet for NOK 50,000 in 2008. The depot camp has now been refurbished and is being rented out. With the refurbishment, the roofing of two of the buildings was changed from the original rounded corrugated panels to modern aluminum panels with a trapezoidal corrugated profile. This has reduced the visual authenticity of the protected buildings.

This led to the development of this technique as a standard in research and industry. Career Rau studied physics at the University of T√ºbingen, Germany, and the Universit√© Claude Bernard, Lyon. Both his diploma thesis (1987) and his doctoral thesis (1991) were obtained for work performed in the group of Huebener, at the University of T√ºbingen, on the breakdown of Germanium under high magnetic fields, and for non-linear charge transport in semiconductors. He then moved to the Max Planck Institute for Solid State Physics in Stuttgart, where he first did work on crystalline silicon solar cells. In 1995, he moved to Bayreuth where he worked dominantly on the device physics of Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cells. 1997, he moved back to Stuttgart to work at the University of Stuttgart, Institute of Physical Electronics, which was led by J√ºrgen Werner. In Stuttgart, he continued work on Si and Cu(In,Ga)Se2, but also started work on dye-sensitized solar cells, organic solar cells, and the fundamental aspects of luminescence in solar cells. In 2002, he obtained his habilitation from the University of Oldenburg, Germany, for work on the electrical transport properties of semiconductors and interfaces for photovoltaics. Since 2007, Rau is a full professor at the RWTH Aachen and Director of the Institute for Energy and Climate Research at the Forschungszentrum J√ºlich. Since 2011, he is in addition, the scientific director of the HITEC graduate school at the Forschungszentrum J√ºlich. Currently, he is the director of the JARA-Energy, (JARA = J√ºlich-Aachen Research Alliance) which coordinates research at Forschungszentrum J√ºlich and RWTH Aachen in the field of renewable energy.  Achievements  Rau is well known for his various contributions to the basic principles of photovoltaic energy conversion and to improving the understanding of solar cell device physics. Most notable, perhaps, is his publication in 2007 of a paper on a \\"reciprocity relation between photovoltaic quantum efficiency and electroluminescent emission of solar cells\\". This work uses the principle of detailed balance to derive basic relationships between the photovoltaic and the light-emitting mode of a semiconductor diode. This work had substantial influence on the field of characterizing solar cells or modules using luminescence-based techniques. In addition, it has provided a framework for analyzing voltage losses at the open circuit in solar cells. Uwe Rau also contributed towards the analysis of thin film solar cells, with seminal papers on the ideality factor, on metastability of the electronic conduction in Cu(In,Ga)Se2, on photovoltaic device stability and self-healing, and on the passivation of grain boundaries in polycrystalline thin film solar cells. He also contributed to several important papers to understand the conversion efficiency limitations of solar cells, among which the role of disorder and potential fluctuations, and on the impact of light trapping on the Voc of solar cells.

It is scheduled to open in mid-2022 as a replacement for the Sydney Football Stadium. The New South Wales Waratahs, Sydney FC and Sydney Roosters will be the ground's major tenants. It will be used as one of the venues for the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup. History In October 2018 plans for the new stadium to replace the original Sydney Football Stadium were released by the Government of New South Wales. In December 2018 Lendlease were appointed to build the stadium. Construction was initially scheduled to commence in 2019 with an early 2022 completion date. In July 2019 the construction part of the Lendlease contract was cancelled by the government with John Holland and Multiplex shortlisted to bid for the contract. In December 2019 John Holland was awarded a $735 million construction contract, representing a $99 million increase in the original budget for demolition and construction. The stadium is expected to be complete by October 2022. Construction Demolition of the previous stadium began in March 2019. Opposition from local interest groups saw them attempt to prevent or slow the demolition via legal action before the 2019 New South Wales state election. After a short court-ordered delay just prior to the election, the existing Government was returned and the destruction of the old stadium continued through to completion in late 2019 at a cost of $40 million. Construction of the stadium commenced in April 2020, with major drilling beginning the following month. Controversy The demolition and rebuild of the stadium was a subject of controversy during the 2019 New South Wales state election. In December 2018, Lendlease was unveiled as the successful bidder to carry out the demolition and construction work. At the time, then Sports Minister Stuart Ayres was quizzed over how the contract for construction could be awarded, because development consent had not been secured for stage two. On 26 July 2019, Sports Minister, John Sidoti announced Lendlease would not be constructing the new stadium because it was unable to complete the $729 million project within budget. At this stage demolition was mostly complete and it appeared the original contract was a fixed price option for the construction phase.

She was raped and murdered at age 30. Her death caused international outrage during a time of increased violence against investigative reporters.  Career  Marinova was the administrative director of TVN Television in Ruse. She presented a current affairs talk programme called Detector for Ruse's TVN television which had recently been relaunched. The first episode of the show on September 30 included with investigative journalists Dimitar Stoyanov and Attila Biro, about an investigation of alleged fraud with EU funds linked to big businessmen and politicians. The second episode that had been planned to air afterwards would have covered the Hitrino train derailment accident, which resulted in the death of 7 people and injured more than 29 others. According to Bulgarian investigative journalists, the same companies that had been involved with the alleged fraud with EU funds, had also won a public procurement deal in the Hitrino case. Among the suspects are Russian citizens, associated with the Bulgarian division of \\"Lukoil\\".  Death  In the afternoon of October 7, 2018, Marinova's body was found in a riverside park in Ruse, which is a popular walking and jogging spot for the citizens of the town.

The attacks triggered the exodus of the migrants. Background The 14-months old girl from a Thakor community was allegedly raped by a migrant labourer from Bihar on 28 September 2018. He worked at the ceramic factory at Dhundhar village near Himmatnagar, Sabarkantha district in north Gujarat where the incident took place. He was arrested by the police next day. It angered the Thakor community which held protests across Gujarat. Attacks and exodus On 2 October, a mob, allegedly led by Kshatriya Thakor Sena members, attacked on the migrant workers in a factory near Vadnagar in Mehsana district. The police had arrested the twenty people for rioting. The next day, Alpesh Thakor, a leader of Kshatriya Thakor Sena and Indian National Congress MLA; had announced the fast from 8 October to seek justice of the rape survivor. He had reportedly demanded the preference to the local people in jobs in industries in the state while addressing the protest. He had also accused the government of filing false cases against the members of his community and demanded their release. On 3 October, there was an attack in Chandlodiya, Ahmedabad. There were further incidents of attacks on the migrant labourers and the factories employing them by the Thakor community and others. By 7 October, the six districts were affected including Sabarkantha, Mehsana, Gandhinagar, Patan, Banaskantha, Aravalli and Ahmedabad district. The first two districts were the worst affected. The attacks were chiefly in industrial estates and industrial belts. On 8 October, there were attacks in villages near Vadodara also. No incidents of attack reported after 9 October. The attacks triggered exodus of the more than thousand labourers from Gujarat to their native states. The Director General of Police denied the exodus and attributed the leaving migrants to the upcoming festive season. Uttar Bharatiya Vikas Parishad, an outfit supporting north Indian migrants, claimed that around 20,000 people had left Gujarat by 8 October. Government action By 8 October, total 55 FIRs were lodged and 431 people were arrested. Ten people were arrested for spreading rumours and hatred on social media. The government of Gujarat provided security to more than hundred factories. Apart from State Police, seventeen companies of State Reserve Police (SRP) were deployed in the affected districts. The Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI) urged the government to restore the peace as the industries were affected. Political reactions The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Indian National Congress (INC), two major political parties in Gujarat assembly, appealed for peace and harmony. The opposition INC state chief Amit Chavda reasoned the rising unemployment in youth behind the anger and criticised the attackers. INC President Rahul Gandhi called the attacks \\"completely wrong\\" and attributed it to unemployment and shutdown of the factories. BJP blamed Alpesh Thakor and his outfit for the violence. Alpesh Thakor denied his involvement and appealed for peace to his community. He kept \\"goodwill\\" fast in Ahmedabad for a day on 11 October. The Government of Gujarat appealed to the migrants to return.

His rule was unusually tumultuous and marked by intrigue, the secession of Sharjah's dependencies and constant conflict. He was also briefly the Ruler of Ras Al Khaimah from 1868‚Äì1869 and its wali, or governor, from 1908‚Äì1919.  Accession  Salim bin Sultan was the son of the former Ruler of Sharjah, Sultan bin Saqr Al Qasimi and a slave girl. On his accession as Ruler of Sharjah, following the death of Khalid bin Sultan in 1868, his nephew Humaid bin Abdullah assumed the role of wali of Ras Al Khaimah and the following year proclaimed independence from Sultan bin Saqr. The Saudi agent from Buraimi, who had been actively involved in a number of coastal disputes in the area, managed in April 1869 to organise a dynastic shuffle of remarkable proportions when he had Salim bin Sultan imprisoned, his brother Ibrahim bin Sultan (who had long been wali of Ras Al Khaimah under Sultan bin Saqr) established as Ruler of Ras Al Khaimah and Humaid bin Abdullah of Ras Al Khaimah established as Ruler of Sharjah. This act of political prestidigitation was immediately followed by an outbreak of fighting in Sharjah and the Saudi agent was killed by gunfire. In what has been labelled an attempt to palliate the wrath of the Saudi King, Salim ceded his rule to his brother Ibrahim, but failing any reaction from Riyadh (and the move apparently being in name only), he reasserted his rule a few months later. = Breach of Maritime Truce = In May 1869, Salim and Ibrahim moved together against Humaid bin Abdullah at Ras Al Khaimah, landing 1,500 men from 32 boats. Humaid was supported by a force of some 500 men landed from Umm Al Qawain and fighting took place both at Jazirat Al Hamrah and in Ras Al Khaimah town. The British Resident, Colonel Lewis Pelly, on hearing of this breach of the maritime truce sailed from Lingeh in the Dalhousie with the gunboat Hugh Rose. Arriving at Ras Al Khaimah on the 12th May, Pelly then ordered Salim and Ibrahim to withdraw their forces from Ras Al Khaimah by sunset the next day. Alliances shifted quickly, however, and in 1871, Salim took advantage of Ibrahim's absence on a journey to Abu Dhabi and, with the support of Humaid bin Abdullah of Ras Al Khaimah together with the Ruler of Umm Al Qawain, he cemented his ascendancy over Ibrahim by retaking total control of Sharjah. At the same time, Humaid bin Abdullah retook the dependencies of Sha'am, Rams and Shimal, which had managed to secede from Ras Al Khaimah. = Sharjah Dependencies = Hamriyah, which had previously rebelled against Sharjah, now did so again and its headman Saif bin Abdulrahman led a confederation of smaller Sheikhs against Sharjah in 1873. By 1875 he had played a role as mediator between the Ruler and the other Sheikhs (likely of Heera, Khan and Abu Hail) and proclaimed the independence of Hamriyah once again. Salim appointed his younger brother Ahmed as wali of Dibba, on the East coast, in 1871, granting him the revenues from the town which were however eroded by the encroachments of the troublesome Shahiyain tribe. Salim bin Sultan was deposed in 1883 by his nephew, Saqr bin Khalid Al Qasimi, who moved against him when he was travelling to Ras Al Khaimah (and his brother, Ahmed was on the island of Abu Musa, where he kept horses). = Wali of Ras Al Khaimah = Salim was appointed wali of Ras Al Khaimah in 1908 and, despite suffering from paralysis, consolidated power to the point where the emirate was in all but name independent of Sharjah. His son Muhammad managed his affairs and he renounced his position in July 1919 to allow Salim's other son, Sultan to take power. Two years later, Salim would achieve Salim's long-held dream of independence for Ras Al Khaimah when the British recognised the emirate as a Trucial State in its own right. Sheikh Salim bin Sultan died in August 1919.

In 2013, Antonio Rodrique represented Haiti as the Ambassador to The Bahamas. Both nations are a part of Caribbean Community (CARICOM) with The Bahamas joining in 1983 and Haiti joining in 2002. Bilateral trade In 2014, the Agriculture Minister of The Bahamas, Renward Wells, visited The Haiti to discuss marketing Haitian Food Products in the country along with visiting several universities, Banana and Mango farms. The minister discussed with Haitian government officials on the progress of Haiti's food products meeting international health standards. In 2018, Haitian President Jovenel Moise and Bahamas Prime Minister, Hubert Minnis, met in Port Au Prince to discuss several issues involving trade, illegal immigration, agriculture and further relations. A trade deal was argued at the meeting, allowing Nassau to buy Fruits and Vegetables from Haiti in exchange for stemming illegal immigration from Haiti./ Illegal immigration Relations were strained as of recently due to the ongoing illegal immigration of Haitians to The Bahamas. Thousands of Haitians flee Haiti for The Bahamas using makeshift rafts creating problems for the Island. Haiti has discussed plans to establish a document center at their embassy in Nassau to keep track of the illegals in The Bahamas. It is estimated there are 80,000 Haitians in The Bahamas, a nation of only 350,000 people.

All Paris was astonished at the Marquise's similarity with the actress Madeleine Brohan, who played the role of an old duchess with spiritual distributions. Ad√©la√Øde-Louise d'Eckm√ºhl de Blocqueville (8 July 1815 ‚Äì 6 October 1892), was a French woman of letters and a poetess. The last daughter of Louis Nicolas Davout, she devoted a large part of her life to honouring the memory of the \\"glorious marshal\\" of Napol√©on.  Life  Born in Paris, in 1835, Davout married a Mar√©chal de camp twenty-six years older than her, Edmond Fran√ßois de Coulib≈ìuf, marquis de Blocqueville.Biographical information based after: (1) Axel Duboul, Les Deux Si√®cles de l'Acad√©mie des Jeux floraux, vol. 2, √âdouard Privat, Toulouse, 1901, . (2) Jules Claretie, La Vie √† Paris, 1897, , Paris, 1898, . She shone at the court of king Louis Philippe and attracted queen Maria-Amalia's affectionate friendship. She published her first novel, Perdita, in 1859. Becoming a widow in 1861, she held a salon in her Parisian hotel where many personalities from the political, artistic and literary worlds met, including Dominique Ingres, Adolphe Thiers, Henri Lacordaire, Octave Feuillet, Elme-Marie Caro, Charles Ernest Beul√©, Victor Cousin, Franz Liszt. In 1869, the latter composed a musical portrait in honour of the Marquise. One of the most frequent visitors was Jules Claretie, who wrote: In 1874, the marquise published Les Soir√©es de la villa des Jasmins, where she portrayed four friends \\"who talked about the soul and its destinies, the unfathomable mysteries of the human heart and discussed a thousand different questions of philosophy, literature and art\\"; we find there, wrote the critic of the Journal des Savants, \\"in the midst of many longueurs, many generous ideas, noble impulses, fine observations, right and elevated thoughts\\".Journal des savants, year 1874, . From 1879 onwards, she published several volumes dedicated to her father's memory as well as several collections of poetry. At the Academie des jeux floraux, which conferred on her the title of \\"Master of Games\\" in 1878, she established the Eckm√ºhl Prize in 1880, a biennial competition that rewards the best essay on a subject of Christian philosophy with a golden jasmine. She then founded a museum, the Salle d'Eckm√ºhl in Auxerre, to which she donated many family souvenirs. In 1885, she bequeathed by will the sum of 300,000 francs for the construction of the famous phare d'Eckm√ºhl at Penmarc'h.

She was also part of the team which developed a poverty line as part of the Henderson Inquiry into poverty in Australia and helped to introduce the double randomisation method of ordering candidates used in Australian elections. Early life and education Harcourt was born Alison Doig in Colac, Victoria, in 1929. Her father was Keith Doig, a physician and Australian rules footballer who received the Military Cross during World War I. Her mother, Louie Grant, was of Scottish descent and was sister to physicist Sir Kerr Grant.Richard and Alison Harcourt profile She was schooled at Colac West State School, Colac High School and Fintona Girls' School. After her schooling, she enrolled at the University of Melbourne, gaining a Bachelor of Arts with a major in mathematics, and then a Bachelor of Science majoring in physics. While specialising in statistics undertaking a Master of Arts degree, she developed a technique for integer linear programming. London School of Economics On the basis of her work in linear programming, she started work at the London School of Economics (LSE) in the late 1950s. In 1960, Doig and fellow LSE mathematician Ailsa Land, published a landmark paper in the economics journal Econometrica (\\"An Automatic Method for Solving Discrete Programming Problems\\"), which outlined a branch and bound optimisation algorithm for solving NP-hard problems. The algorithm has applications in many fields, including transport logistics and beam angle optimisation in radiation therapy treatment. University of Melbourne In 1963, Doig returned to Melbourne, where she took up a position as a senior lecturer in statistics at the University of Melbourne. In the mid-1960s, she joined a team headed by the sociologist Ronald Henderson which was attempting to quantify the extent of poverty in Australia. The team developed the Henderson Poverty Line in 1973, which was the disposable income required to support the basic needs of a family of two adults and two dependent children. The techniques developed by the Henderson team have been used by the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research to regularly update the poverty line for Australia since 1979. In 1970, Harcourt took study leave in Sweden, where she co-authored two papers on theoretical chemistry‚Äî\\"A simple demonstration of Hund‚Äôs Rule for the helium 2S and 2P States\\" and \\"Wavefunctions for 4-electron 3-centre bonding\\",‚Äîwith her husband, the chemist Richard Harcourt. In 1975, following the dismissal of the Whitlam government, Harcourt and fellow statistician Malcolm Clark noticed irregularities in the distribution of party ordering on the Senate ballot papers for the 1975 federal election which was determined by drawing envelopes from a box, with Coalition parties holding one of the first two positions in every state. Harcourt and Clark made a submission to the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform, which resulted in a 1984 amendment to the Commonwealth Electoral Act to introduce a more rigorous double randomisation method. Harcourt and Clark published a paper about their analysis and recommendations for the Australian & New Zealand Journal of Statistics in 1991. Harcourt retired as an academic from the University of Melbourne in 1994, but continues to work there as a sessional tutor in statistics. In October 2018 Harcourt was named as 2019 Senior Victorian Australian of the Year. In early December 2018, the University of Melbourne awarded Harcourt with an honorary Doctor of Science degree. In June 2019, Harcourt was made an Officer of the Order of Australia in recognition of her \\"distinguished service to mathematics and computer science through pioneering research and development of integer linear programming\\".
