It was the first institution of higher education in the New World. The University is now called UASD (Universidad Aut√≥noma de Santo Domingo), and has a rich history behind it. Although the University was not recognized until 1558, classes were in session since inception in 1538. Many of the first universities argue that they were the first because UASD was not yet recognized. The argument from many dominicans is that it does not matter whether the university was recognized by a foreign body or not, since the university granted higher education degrees since it was founded (starting in 1538). History Founded during the reign of Charles I of Spain, it was originally a seminary operated by Catholic monks of the Dominican Order. Later, the institution received a university charter by Pope Paul III's papal bull In Apostulatus Culmine, dated October 28, 1538. However, it did not obtained the official Privilege by Charles V to be officially recognized as a university until 1558. Thus, there is a debate on whether it is officially the first university in the Americas. Prior to its conversion into a full university, the institution had been a Studium Generate (seminary), founded in 1518 and operated by the Dominican Order. In its structure and purpose the new university was modeled after the University of Alcal√° in the city of Henares, Spain. In this capacity it became a standard- bearer for the medieval ideology of the Spanish Conquest, and gained its royal charter in 1558. In this royal decree, the university was given the name University of Saint Thomas Aquinas (Universidad Santo Tom√°s de Aquino). The university was closed in 1801 under the French, but reopened in 1815 as a secular institution. It closed for good in 1823, during the Haitian occupation of Santo Domingo, when all students were ordered into military services. The Autonomous University of Santo Domingo was founded 1912 as a successor to extinct University of St. Thomas Aquinas.

His career spanned 16 years, retiring in 1935 by which time he had played 351 first-class matches, but returning in a crisis for two games two seasons later. Career In his youth, Bellamy focused chiefly on soccer, at which he was good enough to play for Northampton Town as an inside forward. Bellamy joined the ground staff of Northamptonshire, which shared its ground with the soccer club, in 1912, but his powers as a cricketer ripened very slowly indeed. He was denied a regular place in the county team until 1922, due to the First World War and the long career of Walter Buswell. By this time he was thirty-one years old. Bellamy then remained the first choice wicket-keeper for 14 seasons, making his last appearance for the county as a batsman with Ken James having become the preferred wicket keeper. He was a most unusual wicket-keeper - along with Clyde Walcott probably the tallest to regularly play this position - and his clumsy build suggested a complete lack of style behind the stumps.Wisden obituary His debut behind the stumps came in one of the most remarkable county matches of all time. When Northamptonshire played Surrey at Northampton in 1920 the match produced 1,475 runs (a championship record which stood for nearly seventy years), including a century in around 35 minutes by Percy Fender. Bellamy's first victim was Jack Hobbs, and he conceded only 11 byes as Surrey totalled 619-5 declared and 120‚Äì2. Initially he was not regarded as a serious batsman, but as early as 1922 Bellamy scored his career best batting total of 168 against an admittedly weak Worcestershire bowling attack. Three years later, after Northamptonshire lost eight wickets for 216 he put on 93 with Phillip Wright for the ninth wicket and with fellow Wollaston boy Vernon Murdin 148 runs for the last wicket against Glamorgan, which is still a county record.Northamptonshire v Glamorgan in 1925 Bellamy reached his peak in 1928, when he scored 1,116 runs with two centuries, but injury and age gradually began to catch up with him in the 1930s. He missed the last eighteen games of 1931Caine, C. Stewart (editor); John Wisden's Cricketers' Almanack; Sixty- Ninth edition (1932) pp. 443-444. and never reached the same records he had in the previous decade during his last four seasons with the side. Ben Bellamy was well regarded by his county, and as the team were struggling around the time of his career, his competence in cricket was very welcomed. Many famed him for his routine of leaving his motorbike at Wellingborough train station en route to away fixtures. After his retirement, Bellamy spent 22 years as the coach at Wellingborough School. When he died in 1985, aged 94, he was the oldest surviving County Championship cricketer.

The flag of Hawkins County, Tennessee, is the official flag of Hawkins County, Tennessee. It was designed by 15-year-old Dillon Barker, a local high school student, and adopted by the Board of County Commissioners (the county legislative body) in 1999. Design =Flag arrangement and symbolism= The flag consists of a blue field and a Tennessee-style white and gold fly and is purposely modeled after the Tennessee state flag. The field bears six, five-pointed and golden stars. The stars represent the six incorporated municipalities of the county and are arranged as they would appear on a map. The county seal is trimmed in gold and placed within a white disc in the upper, hoist side of the flag. The gold bar is said to represent those who do not live within one of the municipalities. =County seal= The seal of Hawkins County, Tennessee, was designed by the first Board of Trustees to govern the county after it transitioned from Spencer County, North Carolina, to Hawkins County, North Carolina, in 1787. The seal bears the all-seeing Eye of Providence, over-seeing the scales of justice. The year \\"1787\\" notes the year that the county's current name was established by the North Carolina General Assembly. The county became a part of Tennessee in 1796, when the state was established. History The flag was designed in 1999 by Dillon Barker, a fifteen-year-old student at Cherokee High School. Barker petitioned the county commissioners on his own and persuaded them to adopt the flag. Barker purposely based the flag on the Tennessee flag and designed the flag to represent the towns of the county as they would appear on a map. The resolution approving the flag's design was adopted unanimously, but no action was taken on procuring or raising it. In June 2008, a member of the Board of County Commissioners, Linda Kimbro, placed a resolution before the Board to procure the flag and fly it from the flagpole at the Hawkins County Courthouse in downtown Rogersville. The resolution, after some debate, was approved, and Hawkins County Mayor Crockett Lee had the flag made for the first time. It was flown for the first time at the Courthouse in Rogersville during the Raising of the Colors Ceremony at Heritage Days on October 10, 2009.

It is within the medieval walls of Caernarfon, a few hundred yards from Caernarfon Castle. Name Prior to 1828, the pub was known as the 'Black Boy'. Though still referred to by its traditional name, it was officially altered to the 'King's Arms' and, later, the 'Fleur de Lys', until a change of ownership led to the restoration of the old name and the creation of the \\"Black Boy Inn\\" as it is today. The Inn signs each show a 'black buoy' on one side and a 'black boy' on the other. The Inn's name has caused controversy and there are at least three theories to explain its name. One is believed to come from a 'black buoy' which existed in the harbour in the early days of the Inn. Another refers to the nickname given to Charles II by his mother Henrietta Maria of France because of the darkness of his skin and eyes, as well as the fact that Royalists met at the Inn secretly at that time. Later, the place became the local fishermen's favourite drinking place and the name of ‚Äòblack boy‚Äô may come from this period. History Sketch of the early Black Boy Inn In Caernarfon's heyday as a port-town, Northgate Street ‚Äì on which the Black Boy Inn is situated ‚Äì was the heart of the red- light district. Northgate Street's Welsh name Stryd Pedwar a Chwech translates to \\"Four [shillings] and Six [pence] Street\\": what the sailors are reputed to have paid for a room, a bottle of gin, and the services of a woman for the night. The 'North Gate' archway found at the end of Northgate Street was added in or about the 1820s. It was designed to help facilitate the flow of traffic in and out of the old town, and is not part of the original town wall design. Prior to the 'North Gate' archway, a census carried out in 1794 revealed this street was commonly referred to as 'Black Boy' street. The earliest reference to the \\"Black Boy\\" can be found in Caernarfon's archives dated 1717, a Deed of Sale of a house in \\"Street Y Black Boy\\" between Thomas Wynne, Glynllifon and a Henry Robyns. The ghost of a nun is said to pass through the inn on her way to a nunnery that was once situated at the rear. The pub has been listed as Grade II, being a rare surviving 17th century building in Caernarfon that still retains some original interior details. Present day The Black Boy Inn is one of the few remaining free houses owned by an independent family business in the United Kingdom. In 1990 an archaeological excavation was carried out alongside the Black Boy Inn. Archaeologists discovered the skeleton of an old woman, believed to have been buried there to save the expense of a funeral. During restoration work in 2009 workmen uncovered a range of relics underneath the dining room floorboards. The collection included a child's shoe, clay pipes, and a coin thought to date back to 1860. Upstairs rooms unveiled old beams which are thought to come from old sailing ships. In 2008 and 2009, the Black Boy Inn was presented with the Cask Marque award for its cask ales. It is also included in CAMRA's 2010 edition of its annual Good Beer Guide, which features the best real ale venues in the United Kingdom.

Mythology The story of her life is contained in only one source, namely Antoninus Liberalis's Metamorphoses. Antonius cites Boeus‚Äô second book, ‚ÄòThe Origin of Birds‚Äô as the source of the story; however, Boeus‚Äô work has been lost. Polyphonte was the daughter of Hipponous and Thrassa; her grandparents on her mother's side were the war god Ares and Tereine, a daughter of the river god Strymon.Antoninus Liberalis, Metamorphoses, 21. tr., , Greek and Latin Wishing to remain a virgin, Polyphonte fled to the mountains to become a companion of Artemis. This provoked the ire of Aphrodite, the goddess of love and procreation, who viewed Polyphonte's decision as a personal affront. To punish Polyphonte for failing to honor her womanly duty, Aphrodite drove her mad and caused her to lust after a bear. Artemis was disgusted with Polyphonte and so turned the wild animals against her. Fearing for her life, Polyphonte was forced to return to her father's home. =Birth of the Bear Twins= Once at home, Polyphonte gave birth to two humanoid bear-like sons, Agrius and Oreius (the result of her union with the bear). Agrius and Oreius grew into huge men of immense strength. As perhaps befits their feral patronage, the Bear Twins honored neither men nor gods. Indeed, they were cannibals who attacked strangers on the road. Zeus despised Agrius and Oreius and so sent Hermes to punish them as he saw fit. The brothers almost had their hands and feet severed by the vengeful god were it not for the intervention of their great-grandfather Ares. Despite their monstrous nature, Ares persuaded Hermes to commute the sentence. Together, Hermes and Ares transformed Agrius, Oreius, Polyphonte, and the family's female servant into birds. Polyphonte was transformed into the owl- like strix, which neither ate nor drank and cried during that night, which portended war and sedition for mankind. As for her sons, Oreius was turned into a \\"bird called lag≈çs\\" (hypothetically translated as an \\"eagle owl\\") regarded as ill omen, and Agrius was turned into a vulture, a despised carrion-eating bird. In a small act of mercy, Ares and Hermes heeded the female servant's prayer where she had no involvement in the Bear Twins' actions and decided not to transform her into a bird heralding evil for mankind. Instead, she was transformed into a woodpecker (supposedly a sign of good luck if seen before a hunt). Parallels to other stories The story bears strong similarities with the tales of Atalanta and Callisto. It has been suggested that all these tales deal with the function of Artemis within the rituals of Ancient Greece and shed light on how they saw a woman's first sexual encounter.Scanlon, Thomas F. (2002), , pg. 161-165 In so far as the tale details bestiality as a punishment for offending the gods, the myth is also similar to that of Pasipha√´ and the Minotaur where Pasipha√´ mated with a bull resulting in the Minotaur's birth.

The Porr√∫a name has been associated with books and publishing since the beginning of the 20th century, through its flagship Librer√≠a Porr√∫a bookstore in Mexico City and subsidiary stores throughout the country, and the company's renowned and extensive publishing business operating under the names and imprints of Librer√≠a Porr√∫a Hermanos and Editorial Porr√∫a. History Hermanos Porr√∫a has over 100 years of history as bookseller and publisher in Mexico. In the second half of the 19th century, three brothers emigrated from Spain to Mexico City: Jos√©, Indalecio and Francisco Porr√∫a. Indalecio had a market stall on what is now Del Carmen Street, north northwest of the Z√≥calo, in which he had a sign stating that he bought and sold libraries. His business was successful enough that he asked his brothers to join him. The libraries that they purchased were important not only for the works that they contained but also because from whom they were purchased, including some of the Mexico City‚Äôs nobility. They published Mexico‚Äôs first bibliography called the ‚ÄúBolet√≠n Bibliogr√°fico‚Äù which categorized the antique books for sale. It and others like it would set the value of most of the antique books in Mexico over the following century. Publishing Porr√∫a began publishing in 1910, starting with a ‚ÄúGuide to the City of Mexico‚Äù by Jos√© Romero, physically printed in Spain but distributed in Mexico by Porr√∫a. Four years later, the first book completely published in Mexico, a collection of poems, was offered by the company. The company‚Äôs logo, called the ‚ÄúCaballero Aguila‚Äù (Eagle Knight) was devised in 1915 by Saturnino Herr√°n. During the 1930s (at least), the business published as \\"Porr√∫a Hermanos y compania\\". The modern organization of the business took shape in 1940, changing its name to Editorial Porr√∫a and the company began printing specialty books, such as those on law and art. In 1959, Porr√∫a began printing a series of classical works with the aim of making these more affordable to the general public. Starting in 1964, Porr√∫a began publishing its own reference work called ‚ÄúEl Diccionario de Historia Biograf√≠a y Geograf√≠a de M√©xico‚Äù (Dictionary of the History, Biographies and Geography of Mexico) and in 1992 began a division dedicated to young readers, starting with a version of the story of Don Quixote. Bookstore The original site of Librer√≠a Hermanos Porr√∫a is at the corner of Rep√∫blica de Argentina and Justo Sierra Street in the historic center of Mexico City. The building was originally a house that dates from the 18th century and has two floors. The outside of the building maintains much of original d√©cor, such as the geometric design on both floors, a niche with a statue of the Virgin Mary and iron railings on the windows of the upper floor. The inside of the building has been completely modernized and the lower floor is dedicated to the bookstore. From the original store in the Centro Hist√≥rico, Porr√∫a now has stores in all of the states of M√©xico and is also present in many location of the department store El Palacio de Hierro and the office supply chain Office Max in M√©xico.

It hosts concerts, sports, and other events. It officially opened on February 25, 2012. The total cost of the arena was $300 million. The arena has a maximum capacity of 22,300 spectators. It is operated by Zignia Live. It is located in Avenida de las Granjas, close to Ferrer√≠a metro station, Fortuna railway station of the Suburban Railway, and next to TecMilenio University. History The construction began on March 18, 2009, where the Mexico City Mayor, Marcelo Ebrard, was present. The place where the Arena is located used to be the Old Ferreria Cattle Ranch many years ago. It is an 8-hectare land. KMD Architects Mexico was in charge of the design of the Arena along with AVALANZ Group. Construction companies Grupo Garza Ponce, Corey and ADIPPSA are responsible for the development. It is the most up-to-date Arena in Mexico City, the biggest and it is the first arena in the city to have its own parking lot. On November 17, 2010, there was an event that took place in the early construction of the Arena which was called '300 days'. Guillermo Salinas Pliego, head of AVALANZ, promised to finish the project in 300 days. He added \\"It looks difficult but, the Monterrey Arena was the same and it was finished in nine months\\". He also talked about the idea sent to KMD Architects for the design of the Arena. He wanted it to \\"be astonishing on an urban level. Like an icon of the city\\". The Arena was opened officially with a concert by Mexican singer Luis Miguel on February 25, 2012. For the construction 5,000 tons of structural steel, 25,000 tons of reinforced steel and 100,000 cubic meters of concrete were used. 225,000 square meters of construction built on an 8 hectare land. The Arena is 45 meters high. It has 2 heliports, a parking lot with capacity of 5,000 cars, 124 luxury suites, 650 security cameras, 850 LCD screens and a capacity of 22,300 people depending on the event. One of the most distinctive things about the Arena are the outdoor LED screen, which has an area of 6,200 square meters, and the indoor screen in the centerhung, with an area of 700 square meters, making both of the screens one of the largest indoor and outdoor displays in the world. Also, 450 meters of digital rings can be seen inside. All of the LED displays are provided by Daktronics. On February 24, 2012, one day before the official opening, Marcelo Ebrard unveiled the Arena's inauguration plaque. He spoke about the benefits of the Arena, one of them being the 2,500 permanent jobs and the development of Azcapotzalco. On the other hand, Guillermo Salinas mentioned that \\"this Arena built for the people in Mexico City will modernize the current entertainment infrastructure, because the last place built for that kind of purpose was the Sports Palace Dome, which was built in 1968\\". Zignia Live promises the best shows in the city, given the alliance with Feld Entertainment. Shows like Disney On Ice, Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus and Advance Auto Parts Monster Jam took place on the Arena during 2012. Additionally, the NBA has expressed interest in having a team in M√©xico, potentially in this arena. On December 4, 2013, a regular-season game between the San Antonio Spurs and Minnesota Timberwolves scheduled at the arena was canceled when a fire from a generator malfunction filled the building with smoke. As a result, their rematch would instead be played at the Target Center. However, the NBA has held games in the arena since then, with the most recent games coming on January 12 and 14, 2017, with the Phoenix Suns playing against both the Dallas Mavericks and the San Antonio Spurs respectively. The Suns would lose 113‚Äì108 to the Mavericks, but win 108‚Äì105 against the Spurs. In December 2017, the Brooklyn Nets hosted the Oklahoma City Thunder and Miami Heat at the arena. On December 13, 2018, speaking before the Orlando Magic faced the Chicago Bulls at the 22,300-seat Arena Ciudad de Mexico, Silver was complimentary of the building, and said he hoped other, similar venues would pop up in other parts of the Americas. For the 2019-20 NBA Season, the Dallas Mavericks will play host to the Detroit Pistons and the Phoenix Suns to the San Antonio Spurs.  Events  The arena has been a frequent host of boxing, mixed martial arts and lucha libre (professional wrestling) events.

He is most well known for linear style, influenced by architecture and other objects relating to the built environment. Breaking News by Stephen Baron Johnson Background Johnson was born and raised in Lakeland, Florida. From a young age, he began showing an interest in drawing and would sketch constantly. His passion for art never wavered and Johnson would even sketch while on his father's construction sites.Joye, Mary, Today & Tonight Magazine (February 2009). Contemporary Citiscapes His connection with art and the built environment was a natural development and one he has perpetuated into his current body of work. Career Early in his adult life, he earned his living as an AutoCAD operator designing electrical layouts, industrial components and residential structures. This was perfect training, as it turned out, for an artist fascinated with linear design. Johnson deftly applies this \\"blueprint\\" technique to his colorful and energized paintings. Like past pop artists, Johnson adapts the visual language of advertising and pop culture (often funny, vulgar, and outrageous) to the context of fine art. Johnson has said the following about his art: \\"Rather than flee from the dowdy, I make it my own. My work is a celebration of America‚Äôs built environment. In many of my images, buildings loom large, isolated almost like sculptures in their own right. Scenes are reduced to the skeleton of their structuring geometries. The viewer is invited to take pleasure in not only the subject as a whole, but also in its individual components. My paintings of icehouses and corner stores, of movie theaters and shop signs, revel in precisely these kinds of unassuming geometric marvels. My work lends dignity to the unspectacular.\\"Quinn, Marialice, Polk Voice (January 21, 2009).

Directed by Matt Austin, the film was named after the 1985 song of the same name by Simple Minds, which in turn was the theme song for Hughes' film The Breakfast Club. The film specifically focused on Hughes' fade from prominence in the early 1990s. Background The documentary details the journey of a group of young filmmakers who go in search of the reclusive icon, documenting their search through interviews of the people with whom Hughes had worked and fans of his films. Those interviewed include Ilan Mitchell-Smith, Ally Sheedy, Judd Nelson, Kelly Le Brock, Mia Sara, Alan Ruck, Kevin Smith, Roger Ebert, and Jim Kerr of the band Simple Minds. Filming began in 2006. Home media The film was completed in 2008, but did not find a distributor for over a year. When Hughes died of a heart attack, aged 59, on August 6, 2009, a bidding war broke out for the film. It was announced on August 11, 2009, that the film would be distributed by Alliance Films. The film aired on the TV channel Encore for a brief time as well.

As the last poem running as part of the Sonnets on Eminent Characters series, it describes Coleridge's appreciation of Richard Brinsley Sheridan and his theatre talents. Coleridge, unlike most, preferred Sheridan's somber works over his comedies and emphasizes them within the poem. Coleridge also respects Sheridan's political actions. Background Coleridge's \\"To Richard Brinsley Sheridan, Esq.\\" became the final poem in his Sonnets on Eminent Characters series when it was published in the 29 January 1795 Morning Chronicle. It was revised somewhat and published again in Coleridge's 1796 collection of poems with a note about Hymettian Flowrets. It was reprinted again in 1803 without any changes. The poem was included in Coleridge's collections in 1828, 1829, and 1834, with the only change being the removal of the note.Mays 2001 pp. 167‚Äì168 Sheridan was a famous comic playwright, but Coleridge emphasized the sentimental aspects of Sheridan's writing. The connection that Coleridge felt in regards to the sadder works of Sheridan is what prompted him to dedicate a poem to the playwright and not to someone else, such as a political figure. Coleridge also had a personal connection to Sheridan through his friendship with William Smyth, the tutor to Thomas Sheridan, the playwright's son.Mays 2001 p. 168 Coleridge also knew of Sheridan as a political figure; Sheridan was a witness during the 1794 Treason Trials and also argued for the repeal of the Habeas Corpus Suspension Act.Patterson 2002 p. 241 A speech on the matter was printed in the January Morning Chronicle before Coleridge's sonnet was published.Barrell 2006 p. 52 Poem The 1796 edition of the poem read: A note attached to line four read: \\"Hymettian Flowrets. Hymettus a mountain near Athens, celebrated for its honey. This alludes to Mr. Sheridan's classical attainments, and the following four lines to the exquisite sweetness and almost Italian delicacy of his Poetry.‚ÄîIn Shakespeare's 'Lover's Complaint' there is a fine stanza almost prophetically characteristic of Mr. Sheridan.\\"Mays 2001 qtd. p. 168 Following the note are these verses: In the original Morning Chronicle edition, the first four lines read: Themes The Sonnets on Eminent Characters contained many poems dedicated to those Coleridge considered his hero from many fields.Ashton 1997 p. 61 The heroes were divided into those who were artists, intellectuals, political figures, and military figures in a way similar to how John Milton divided his poems dedicated to various individuals. In particular, Milton's sonnet on Henry Vane (\\"Sonnet 17\\") was the model for Coleridge's poem on Sherida along with the poem \\"To Erskine\\".Curran 1986 p. 35 With Coleridge's poem \\"To Bowles\\", \\"To Sheridan\\" was the only representation of Coleridge's contemporaries from literature within his 1796 collection of poems.Joseph and Francis 2004 p. 267 Notes References * Ashton, Rosemary.

Written by Lamar Trotti and based on a story by Niven Busch and Cameron Rogers, it was produced by Kenneth Macgowan for 20th Century Fox, and shot in Technicolor. The film is very loosely based on the life of 19th-century American outlaw Belle Starr. It was the fourth film and the third sound film to portray Starr on the screen, but it was the first major Hollywood production to do so. Its success led to many more such portrayals, although the real Starr was fairly obscure during her lifetime. Plot After her family's mansion is burned down by Yankee soldiers for hiding the rebel leader Captain Sam Starr (Randolph Scott), Belle Shirley (Gene Tierney) vows to take revenge. Breaking Starr out of prison, she joins his small guerrilla group for a series of raids on banks and railroads, carpetbaggers and enemy troops. Belle's bravado during the attacks earns her a reputation among the locals as well as the love of Starr himself. The pair get married, but their relationship starts to break down when Sam Starr lets a couple of psychotic rebels into the gang, leaving Belle to wonder if he really cares about the Southern cause.

It is a monotypic genus, containing the single species Zeus olympius, originally discovered in 1987 on Mount Olympus in Greece. Fruit bodies are yellow discs that grow in the decaying wood of Bosnian pine trees. Taxonomy and classification Zeus olympius was first described scientifically 1987 by David Minter and Stephanos Diamandis, based on collections made by the latter from Greece's Mount Olympus. The generic and specific epithets refer to the king of the gods in Ancient Greek mythology, who is said to have lived on Mount Olympus. Based on physical characteristics, Zeus produces fruit bodies that are most similar to Colpoma, Therrya, and Coccomyces, all genera in the order Rhytismatales. The authors also noted some similarities with Cerion and Ocotomyces. None of these genera have species with ellipsoid ascospores; ascospore shape is known to be an important criterion in the Rhytismatales for distinguishing between genera, so the authors felt justified in creating a new genus for their discovery. Description Unopened fruit bodies of Zeus olympius are circular blackened crusts that occur below the bark. When ripe, the fruit body expands, breaking through the bark, and the crust splits radially into small black teeth. This exposes the fertile layer (hymenium), which is an orange- to golden-coloured angular or circular disc ranging from 0.2‚Äì5 mm in diameter. The spores are thin-walled, smooth, more or less ellipsoidal, and measure 12‚Äì15 by 5‚Äì8 Œºm. The asci are eight-spored, and measure about 110‚Äì120 by 10‚Äì12.5 Œºm before the spores are discharged. Habitat and distribution Zeus olympius is known only from the type locality in Greece, at an elevation of about on Mount Olympus, as well as from the Pirin and Slavyanka Mountain in Bulgaria. The fruit bodies grow scattered or in small groups on the dead portions of twigs and small branches of Bosnian pine (Pinus leucodermis) that are still living towards their bases. This habitat suggests that the fungus may be a parasite or a facultative endophyte. Although its conservation status is not officially listed by the IUCN, it is considered \\"potentially Critically Endangered\\". Threats to its habitat include forest fires and climate change.

Such developments were discontinuous across the market. After this upturn in all the market segments in the second quarter of 2003, there was a sharp downturn in the interest rate, cross currency and FX swaps in the second quarter of 2004. This was contrasted by a rise in the turnover in the unsecured, secured and other interest rate swaps. The forward rate agreement and the short term securities also witnessed a rise. The secured segment happens to be the largest money market segment. The overnight interest rate swap segment also saw a sharp downfall in the second quarter of 2004 although it had experienced a strong rise in the second quarter of 2003. this change is attributed to the interest rate speculation which was high in 2003 but low in 2004. The overnight interest rate swap segment of the money market is provided impetus by the EUIRIBOR-ACI. The unsecured, secured and the overnight interest rate swap and the FX swap segments are characterized by activities that have very short term maturity periods.

History In the mid 19th century, Colt manufactured revolvers for the Army and Navy that were based on a design by William Mason and Carl J. Ehbets. William Mason left Colt in 1882 to work for Winchester, but Ehbets remained at Colt, and continued to refine the design that they had collaborated on. These refinements led to the Model 1889. Colt was the first manufacturer to produce a revolver with a swing-out cylinder. Smith & Wesson followed seven years later with the Hand Ejector, Model 1896 in .32 S&W; Long caliber. This was an improvement over the Colt 1889 design since it used a combined center-pin and ejector rod to lock the cylinder in position. The 1889 did not use a center pin and the cylinder was prone to move out of alignment. Design features The Colt Model 1889 was the first double-action revolver with a swing-out cylinder, released by a sliding latch. This design had two advantages over previous designs as it enabled fast loading but also maintained the strength of a solid frame. The Model 1889 was chambered for the .41 Long Colt, .38 Long Colt and .38 Short Colt cartridges. The Navy version was blued, and had a six-inch barrel. It was manufactured with hard rubber grips. Civilian versions had either a blue or nickel finish, and had walnut grips. Sometimes it can have ivory grips. The Model 1889 differed from earlier Colt revolvers in that its cylinder rotated counterclockwise instead of clockwise. This seems to have originated with U.S. Navy requirements, however, the direction of rotation worked against the cylinder lock and tended to force the cylinder out of alignment with the barrel. This weakness allowed the cylinder to rotate while holstered or even while the shooter was pulling the trigger. Use The Model 1889 and variants were adopted by the United States Military and used prior to the introduction of the M1911 pistol. The Model 1889 was also sold commercially as the Colt New Army and Navy. Approximately 31,000 Colt Model 1889 revolvers were produced.

The highway travels through both Greeneville and Rogersville, bisecting Interstate 81 between the two towns. Route description =Greene County= SR 70 begins in Greene County as a primary highway at the North Carolina border, with the highway continuing as North Carolina Highway 208. It begins as a curvy 2-lane highway, going through the mountains along the Tennessee - North Carolina border. It goes west, crossing the Appalachian Trail a few hundred feet across the border before going through some mountains before lowering down into the farmland of Greene County and turning north, straightening and widening into a 2-lane rural highway with a speed limit of 55 (mph). SR 70 then enters the community of South Greene and coming to a Y-intersection with SR 107, becoming concurrent with that route. They then come to an intersection with SR 351 (which is also Tennessee State Route 107 Cutoff, an unsigned Auxiliary Route of SR 107) before leaving South Greene at a crossing of the Nolichucky River, just a few yards away from the historic Nolichucky Dam and its reservoir, Davy Crockett Lake. SR 70/SR 107 continue north through some farmland before entering Greeneville. They go through some suburbs and pass by a few businesses before coming to an intersection with US 321/SR 35, with the SR 107 separating to follow that route northeast into downtown, all the while SR 70 completely bypasses downtown to the south. SR 70 then widens to 4-lanes, through undivided, and goes to intersect and become concurrent with US 11E Bus/SR 350, turning west. They then come to major interchange with US 11E/SR 34 (Andrew Johnson Highway), where US 11E Bus/SR 350 both end and SR 70 becomes concurrent with US 11E/SR 34, turning east as a 4-lane divided highway, with the road continuing as Blue Springs Parkway (Old US 11E). Shortly afterwards, they come to another intersection, where SR 70 separates and turns north, returning to a 2-lane highway and leaving Greeneville. It then becomes narrow and curvy again as it goes through more farmland. It then makes a sharp right turn at an intersection with a county road (Marvin Road) before continuing north for about 2 miles before coming to an interchange with I-81 (Exit 30). It then come to a T-intersection with Horton Highway, a major county road the connects the highway to the town of Baileyton, the community of Fall Branch, and SR 93. It then turns left to go west around a mountain before going down a narrow valley before weaving through some mountains and crossing into Hawkins County. =Hawkins County= SR 70 then weaves through some more mountains before finally turning west to enter farmland again and widen and straighten into a 2-lane rural highway with a speed limit of 55 (mph). It then intersects with Old Highway 70, the narrow and curvy former alignment of SR 70 through the area before it was realigned onto a new highway. It then continues west before entering and going through the town of Persia before coming to an intersection and becoming concurrent with SR 66, just north of that route's intersection with SR 113. They then go north and catch-up with the other end of Old Highway 70 before crossing a bridge over the Holston River/Cherokee Lake. They then enter Rogersville and pass through a business district and some neighborhoods before coming to an interchange with Main Street (Old US 11W), which connects the highway to downtown to the northeast as SR 66/SR 70 bypass it to the southwest. They then come to an interchange with US 11W/SR 1 (Lee Highway/Memphis to Bristol Highway), where SR 70 separates to become concurrent with US 11W/SR 1 to the northeast while SR 66 continues north as curvy and narrow secondary highway towards Sneedville. They then pass along the northern edge of downtown, as a 4-lane divided highway, before coming to an interchange with SR 347 (Main Street/Old US 11W), where SR 347 ends and SR 70 separates to take over that route and it goes north as a narrow and curvy 2-lane highway through both mountains and farmland before coming to an intersection with SR 94 (Pressmen's Home Road), which runs through the abandoned town of Pressmen's Home, before entering a long mountain pass over several mountains and ridges before crossing into Hancock County just north of the community of Edison. =Hancock County= SR 70 then winds its way along the banks of the Clinch River before crossing it along the historic Kyles Ford Bridge and entering Kyles Ford. It then immediately has an intersection and concurrency with SR 33 as they go through the heart of the community before separating with SR 33 turning southwest towards Sneedville while SR 70 continues north, becoming a secondary highway and going through some countryside before crossing the Virginia state line and continuing as Virginia State Route 70 (Trail of the Lonesome Pine) towards Jonesville, VA. History Throughout the highway's duration, and its companion route across the state line in Virginia, SR 70 is known and signed as Trail of the Lonesome Pine, with markers placed along the entire route, though they have not been maintained in many years and are now few and far between. This was done to commemorate the history of the highway as it was originally built as the Trail of the Lonesome Pine auto trail, an auto trail from Detroit to Florida. In 1924, a group of citizens from far western Virginia appeared before the Virginia State Highway Commission, asking them to take it over as a state highway. A member of the Tennessee Legislature stated that be was sure that it would be designated a state highway in Tennessee if Virginia took over their part, which happened in a period between 1924-1928.

Biography Henry Roberts was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1803.Dictionary of Scottish Architects, accessed 9 September 2010 His family returned to England shortly thereafter. In 1817, Roberts began an apprenticeship with Charles Fowler, where he stayed until 1825. He then entered the Royal Academy Schools and worked for Robert Smirke, took part in competitions, and traveled in Italy before returning to London to set up his architectural practice there in 1830.Dora Ware, A Short Dictionary of British Architects (London: Allen & Unwin, 1967), p. 200 In 1832, Roberts won the competition for the Fishmongers' Hall at London Bridge, which was to be his most well-known large-scale work. George Gilbert Scott was his pupil during this period. He also designed a number of country houses, including Escot House, Devon (1838) and Norton Manor, Norton Fitzwarren, Somerset (1843). He also designed the Camberwell Collegiate School (1843). In 1844, Roberts was appointed architect to the joint companies building the Brighton, Croydon, Dover and Greenwich Railway, and was jointly responsible for designing the rebuilt London Bridge railway station. The same year, he became Honorary Architect to the Society for Improving the Condition of the Labouring Classes. For that Society, and later for the Metropolitan Association for Improving the Dwellings of the Industrious Classes, Roberts designed a number of buildings that represented innovations in workers' housing, including the houses in Lower Road, Pentonville, London (1844) and the famous model dwellings in Streatham Street, Bloomsbury (1849‚Äì1851). Another estate of model dwellings built by Roberts in 1852 survives today in Windsor, Berkshire, and the only other example of 2 storey Model dwellings that exists are to be found in Newcomen Road, Tunbridge Wells, Kent. Roberts was very influential on subsequent efforts in the area of workers' housing throughout Europe and the United States, both through his built work and his writings.

She was the thirteenth of fifteen children of Leopold, Duke of Lorraine, and his spouse √âlisabeth Charlotte d'Orl√©ans. Her mother was the niece of Louis XIV of France and sister of Philippe II, Duke of Orl√©ans and Regent of France during the minority of Louis XV. Family Anne Charlotte was born at the Ch√¢teau de Lun√©ville because the Capital of Lorraine, Nancy, was occupied by French troops of Louis XIV due to the War of the Spanish Succession. She was given her mother's name of Charlotte. At the time of her birth, she had three brothers and a sister alive: L√©opold Cl√©ment, heir to the throne since the death of Louis in 1711; Francis Stephen born in 1708; √âlisabeth Th√©r√®se born in 1711; and then Charles-Alexandre born in 1712. In 1715 her mother lost a daughter who died soon after birth. In 1716, another daughter was born, but she died in childhood. In 1719 the Ch√¢teau de Lun√©ville where Anne Charlotte was born was damaged greatly by a fire. Anne Charlotte was seven and a half when she went to the French court of her maternal family, the Royal House of Bourbon. She met her grandmother, the Dowager Duchess of Orl√©ans, the Princess Palatine for the first and last time; the occasion was for the coronation of Louis XV at the Cathedral of Notre-Dame in Rheims. Her grandmother said that Anne Charlotte was a \\"little beauty\\" and that she and her siblings had been brought up well; her mother would always be praised for her maternal instinct. Uncommon for the time, Anne Charlotte's mother insisted that she raise her children, and had a close and affectionate relationship with them. Marriage negotiations with the King of France In 1723 Anne Charlotte's father, L√©opold, disappointed with his relations with France, decided to send his heir to finish his education in Vienna under the supervision of Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor. L√©opold had been secretly hoping to have his son marry the Emperor's heiress, Archduchess Maria Theresa. The young prince of 16 years died the same year and as a result his brother Francis Stephen became the heir to Lorraine and left Lun√©ville for Vienna. Francis Stephen later married Maria Theresa and became Holy Roman Emperor upon her accession, the couple having sixteen children. Anne Charlotte's younger sister Marie Louise also died on the same day. Two years later, the Ducal couple hoped and tried fiercely to get Anne Charlotte to marry the King of France Louis XV who at the time was just 15 years old. The intrigues of the Prime Minister, the Duke of Bourbon, prince of the blood, head of the Cond√© family and great rival of the House of Orl√©ans also fought fiercely to stop the marriage as it would have decreased their influence over the young king. This did not stop the Duke of Bourbon and his mistress the marquise de Prie, from suggesting the king marry the sister of the Duke, Henriette Louise de Bourbon. Despite the plans of the Prime Minister, Marie Leszczy≈Ñska, a poor and plain catholic princess who was the second daughter of Stanislaw I of Poland was chosen as the bride of the monarch. Anne Charlotte's parents were greatly insulted that the daughter of an exiled Pole was to become Queen and not someone who was French. Marriage negotiations with the Duke of Orl√©ans In 1726, the son of the now dead Regent, nephew of the Duchess of Lorraine, became a widower aged 23; his wife Margravine Auguste Marie Johanna of Baden- Baden had died in Paris in childbirth. The Duchess of Lorraine once again tried to get her daughter a husband; it failed; The Duke of Orl√©ans refused all offers of marriage, the last one being made in 1729 when Anne Charlotte was 15. In the same year Anne Charlotte lost her father L√©opold. Her brother, Francis Stephen, still in Vienna returned to Lorraine. While awaiting the return of the latter, √âlisabeth Charlotte seized the regency because her son was 17. In 1737, however, the Duchy of Lorraine was annexed by France in exchange for the Duchy of Tuscany in a treaty between France and Francis Stephen. The Dowager Duchess princess now went with Anne Charlotte to Vienna. The marriage of Francis and Maria Theresa then allowed them to negotiate the marriage of Princess √âlisabeth Th√©r√®se to Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia, his first cousin and already two times widower. The Queen of Sardinia died four years later in childbirth in Turin. =Abbess of Remiremont= By the marriage of her sister to the King of Sardinia, Anne Charlotte was aged 23. All proposals of marriage being either ignored or declined, Anne Charlotte was made the Abbess of the prestigious Remiremont Abbey on 10 May 1738. Remiremont had previously been the \\"property\\" of her older sister √âlisabeth Charlotte (who died before Anne Charlotte was born) who was the titular abbess of the prestigious abbey which had many connections with the House of Lorraine. Her new title caused irritation between certain sovereign princes because this abbey, composed solely of ladies of high nobility and of which the temporal domain included a big number of towns, answered only to authority of the pope. Later on, Anne Charlotte decided to build a sumptuous abbey palace. =Vienna= In 1744 the Dowager Duchess of Lorraine, Princess of Commercy died aged 68. After her mother's death, she went to Vienna. She attended the Imperial family in Frankfurt and witnessed the coronation of Fran√ßois as Emperor on 4 October 1745, feast day of Saint Francis. The Abbess was given apartments at the vast Sch√∂nbrunn Palace. =Brussels= In 1754 at the age of 30, Anne Charlotte was made the Secular Abbess of the chapter of Noble Ladies of Saint Waltrude of Mons; thus she went to Belgium to see her youngest brother Charles Alexander who had been the Governor of the Austrian Netherlands since 1744. As a Secular Abbess, she could therefore manage this monastery, all the while remaining in the world. Two years later, she was again named by her sister-in-law coadjutor of the monastery of Thorn and in 1757 coadjutor of the one of Essen. In Brussels, she enjoyed great influence over her brother and served as \\"first lady.\\" Although Charles Alexander had been a widower for ten years, his wife was the youngest sister of the Empress and she reproached him about his liaison with Madame de Meuse. In 1763, she designated as coadjutor and successor of Remiremont the Princess Kunigunde of Saxony, sister of the Queen of Naples and Sicily and the Dauphine of France. In 1765, she attended the marriage of her nephew the future L√©opold II to Infante Maria Luisa of Spain in Innsbr√ºck; the same year her brother the Emperor died. From April to September 1770, Anne Charlotte made a last trip to Vienna. On the way, Anne Charlotte crossed the path taken by her niece, the 14-year-old Archduchess Maria Antonia towards that of her French marriage. Anne Charlotte died in Mons in present-day Belgium at the age of 59. She was buried at the Ducal Crypt in Lorraine, the √âglise Saint-Fran√ßois-des- Cordelier. She was joined by her brother Charles Alexander in 1780.

Degrassi Goes Hollywood is the first feature-length movie of the Next Generation cast, and the second feature-length film in the Degrassi franchise, the first being 1992's School's Out in which Brogren co-starred. Degrassi Goes Hollywood is the first in-continuity Degrassi production recorded and/or set principally outside of Canada. For syndication purposes, the film has been shown as a four-part episode titled \\"Paradise City\\". An extended version of the film was released as a bonus on the show's season 8 DVD on 1 September 2009.  Plot  As the name suggests, the cast of Degrassi: The Next Generation travels to Los Angeles, California as they attempt to live out their dreams. While Manny Santos continues to pursue her acting career, Paige Michalchuk manages to acquire a leading role in a Hollywood film directed by Jason Mewes about his high school story and the girl of his dreams, Trixie. The dramatic relationship between Craig Manning and Ellie Nash continues to intensify after years of turbulence. Meanwhile, St√ºdz‚Äîthe band composed of Peter, Danny, and Sav‚Äîseems to be headed towards their big break.  Cast  Former Degrassi: The Next Generation co-star, Shenae Grimes and her current series, 90210, are spoken of in dialogue by Hailey Montel (Mary Ashton) at a party, making Grimes the first Degrassi actor to exist within the Degrassi fictional universe independently of her character. Her Degrassi character, Darcy Edwards is neither seen nor referred to in Degrassi Goes Hollywood, and was said to be volunteering in Africa in a previous season. The line of dialogue, \\"Does 90210 have an After Show?\\" also refers to the Canadian series The After Show, which is co-hosted by Dan Levy who plays Robbie in the film. Also making an appearance is Romina D'Ugo, who appeared on the first season of So You Think You Can Dance Canada, as well as Janna Polzin, who was runner-up on How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria? This was done again the following year with Degrassi Takes Manhattan, when The After Show's Jessi Cruickshank mentions Drake. Stacey Farber earned a Gemini Award nomination for best performance in a children's or youth program or series, as Ellie Nash in \\"Paradise City (Part Three)\\". The award was won by Michael Seater (who also appeared in Degrassi Goes Hollywood) for his work on Life with Derek. He would then star beside Farber in 18 to Life. Production Filming was split between Toronto, Canada, and Hollywood, California with the majority being the former to keep production cost low. Adamo, Stacey, Lauren, Jake, and Jason all filmed in both locations while everyone else filmed only in Canada. All of the studio scenes were shot in Toronto during Degrassi's regular filming schedule while a lot of outdoor Los Angeles was filmed on location in less than a weeks time. Paige's mansion was filmed in both Canada and Los Angeles. Absences The following characters do not appear in the movie, but were regular characters on the show during the previous season. * Sarah Barrable-Tishauer as Liberty Van Zandt * Stefan Brogren as Archie \\"Snake\\" Simpson * Paula Brancati as Jane Vaughn * Aislinn Paul as Clare Edwards  Music  Degrassi Goes Hollywood: Music from the Original Movie is the title of the movie soundtrack released on CD on 4 August 2009, and digital download 25 August 2009. It features songs from little known Canadian artist as well as five original songs performed by cast members Cassie Steele and Jake Epstein. Some of the songs featured on it were previously used in the show, thus making this the eighth season soundtrack as well.

Synopsis The film is set during the Russian Civil War. Across the white sands of Central Asia, the Red Army's detachment is advancing, led by the Commissioner Yevsyukov. They are dying of thirst and are pursued by the Whites. Based on the battle account, the best shooter of Maryutki's squad killed forty Whites. In the last battle to capture the caravan, a White lieutenant aristocrat Govorukha-Otrok is captured, who was sent on a diplomatic mission from Alexander Kolchak to Anton Denikin. Masha is entrusted with guarding him. Tensions arise between both: the officer is a well-educated aristocrat who is both amused and impressed by the crude attempts of Masha, a fisherman's orphan daughter, to compose Agitprop poetry. When their camels are stolen, their commander decides to send his captive on a boat to their headquarters in Kazalinsk via the Aral Sea. The vessel capsizes in a sudden storm, and only Masha and Otrok remain alive, stranded on an isolated island. The Red soldier treats the White officer when he catches a fever and is slowly charmed by his manners, while he is overcome with gratitude and begins to call her 'Man Friday' with affection. When she demands to know what he means, he tells her the story about Robinson Crusoe. The two fall in love and seem to forget about the war. When a boat approaches their isle, they first think these are fishermen and run toward them. Otrok recognizes them as White soldiers and intends to join them. Masha shoots him in the back, killing him. As she realizes he is dead, she runs into the sea and embraces his corpse.

Name  Named after the Himalayan peak, Dunagiri, the ship was a Nilgiri-class frigate that was a part of the Navy's 14th Frigate Squadron. Dunagiris crest had a Himalayan Osprey on it and her motto read Victory is My Profession. Operational history  Dunagiri was the fourth of the Nilgiri- class frigates to be built at the Mazgaon Docks and it took almost 58 months from the commencement of production till her final delivery to the Navy. However, Dunagiri also had a large number of indigenously produced equipment in her although much of her firepower and radars and sensors were of British or Dutch origin. Vice-admiral S Jain who later served as flag-officer- commanding-in-chief of the Western Naval Command was the Dunagiri's first commanding officer.  Operational issues  Dunagiri underwent a medium refit in 1990 but the process took 40 months against a normal schedule of 12 months, being finally completed in February 1994. India's Comptroller and Auditor General observed that the delay in the work had not only failed to rectify the ship's main defects but had also led to corrosive damage to it on account of prolonged detention at the shipyard that necessitated a short refit in 1995 and cost overruns of 4.52 crores. In 2006 Dunagiri was involved in a collision off the coast of Mumbai when it struck a Shipping Corporation of India merchant vessel, MV Kiti.

In 2017, sixty indigenous women in Saskatchewan sued the provincial government, claiming they had been forced to accept sterilization before seeing their newborn babies. Canadian compulsory sterilization operated via the same overall mechanisms of institutionalization, judgement, and surgery as the American system. One notable difference is in the treatment of non-insane criminals; Canadian legislation never allowed for punitive sterilization of inmates.  History of Eugenics in Canada  Eugenics movements appeared in many European and American jurisdictions in response to historical, social, scientific, economic, and political processes occurring at the time. Francis Galton invented the term \\"eugenics\\" in 1883, building it from its Greek roots meaning \\"good in birth\\" or \\"noble in heredity\\". \\"The science of eugenics was concerned with the improvement of the human standard and focused on the influence that would give 'the more suitable races or strain of blood a better chance of prevailing speedily over the less suitable'\\". Eugenicists were concerned with managing the direction human evolution would take: natural selection, about which Galton's cousin Charles Darwin wrote, was insufficient to deal with the needs of modern society.Bashford, A., Levine, P. (Eds.). (2010). The Oxford handbook of the history of eugenics. If left solely to nature, eugenicists argued, the dangerous classes who were thought to have a high-volume reproductive rate would take over; ideas, promoted abroad, were quick to gain popularity in Canada in the early 1900s.Grekul, J., Krahn, H., & Odynak, D. (2004). \\"Sterilizing the 'feeble-minded': eugenics in Alberta, Canada, 1929‚Äì1972\\". Journal of Historical Sociology, 17, 358‚Äì384. Nova Scotia, in 1908, was home of the first \\"eugenics movement\\" in the country when the League for the Care and Protection of Feebleminded Persons was established in the province.The Right to Consent?: Eugenics in Alberta, 1928‚Äì1972, Jana Grekul 2009 In Quebec, Ontario, and elsewhere, academics and physicians worked to enlist hereditarians to their ranks and publicly supported eugenics. Eugenicists sought to actively support the reproduction of some women while at the same time seeking to ensure their cooperation in efforts to curb the reproduction of others through their support for measures like marriage regulation, institutionalization and sterilization.Menzies, Robert. (1998). \\"Governing Mentalities: The Deportation of 'Insane' and 'Feebleminded' Immigrants Out of British Columbia From Confederation to World War II\\". Canadian Journal of Law and Society Many eugenicists were prepared to support certain rights for some women to the extent that these would help support the political and economic enterprise of nation building based on an inherently racial notion of who belonged.McLaren, Angus. (1986). \\"The Creation of a Haven for 'Human Thoroughbreds': The Sterilization of the Feeble-minded and the Mentally Ill in British Columbia\\". Canadian Historical Review, LXVII, 2, pp. 127‚Äì150. Ideology worked to conceal the historical and material relations that gave rise to many of the social problems of Canadian society in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries by locating the causes of poverty, crime and illness within individuals. Adoption of proposed interventions like sterilization served as a cost-effective public health solution allowing systemic explanations to be avoided, private interests to benefit and exploitative relations to continue. In their efforts, eugenicists also encouraged the reproduction of the \\"fit\\", namely women of Anglo-Saxon, middle- and upper-class origins.An Act of Genocide Colonialism and the Sterilization of Aboriginal Women Karen Stote 2015 Fearing a decrease in the birth rate due to their increased access to education, the achievement of work outside the home and rising infant mortality rates, eugenicists sought to bring these women \\"back home\\" by enticing them to become crusaders to the eugenic cause.Equality Deferred Sex Discrimination and British Columbia's Human Rights State, 0953-84 DOMINIQUE CLEMENT 2014 Alberta The most damaging sterilization program in Canadian history was afforded via the passing of the Sexual Sterilization Act of 1928. From the years 1928 to 1972, sterilizations, both compulsory and optional, were performed on nearly 3000 \\"unfit\\" individuals of varying ages and ethnicities. In total, over 2800 procedures were performed. Initially, the act only provisioned sterilizations where consent was given by the subject or legal guardian of the subject, depending on the competency of the individual scheduled to undergo the operation. The 1937 amendment to the act allowed for sterilizations to be carried out without consent in the case of those deemed mentally defective. Sterilization of individuals deemed mentally ill still required consent. At the end of World War II, while other eugenic sterilization programs were being phased out, Alberta continued on, even increasing the scope of eligibility for sterilizations. They continued until 1972, when approximately 50 people were operated upon. =Targeted sterilization= Youths, minorities, and women were sterilized in disproportionately high numbers. Minors, because of their legal dependency on adults, were almost always assigned as \\"mental defectives\\", thus bypassing the parental consent requirement. Albertan Aboriginal people and M√©tis, regardless of age, were also targeted. Aboriginal people represented only 2.3% of the general population in Alberta, but made up 6% of the institutionalized population. Towards the end of Alberta's sterilization program, Aboriginal people and M√©tis made up 25% of the sterilizations performed. Furthermore, those of Aboriginal ancestry were disproportionately assigned the \\"mentally deficient\\" rating, which denied them their legal rights and made them eligible for sterilization without consent. Women, particularly women who were young, poor, and unmarried, were also disproportionately represented; they were thought to be at high risk for prostitution or at the very least promiscuity, activities suspected of breeding further immorality. While it was conceded that sterilization would not change the behavior of these women, sterilization was intended to prevent them from bearing similarly defective progeny. =Aftermath= Despite the inaccuracy of IQ testing and the tremendous grey area in classifying the mentally defective, nearly 3000 people were rendered sterile by the Sexual Sterilization Act. The true nature of the Act was revealed when Leilani Muir, a former inmate of the Michener Centre (also known as the Provincial Training School for Mental Defectives, PTS), discovered in 1971 that she had been sterilized. After being admitted to the PTS at age 10 as an unwanted and abused child, Leilani was given a substandard education. She was inaccurately designated a mentally defective moron (an individual with an IQ between 51 and 70), effectively nullifying her human rights. She was administered powerful antipsychotic agents without any due cause, as she had not manifested any symptoms of psychosis during her incarceration at the PTS. Eventually she was given an impromptu IQ test, on which she scored a 64. Shortly thereafter, she was taken before the Eugenics Board, and sterilization was authorized pending her mother's consent (which was readily given). In 1995, in damages for her humiliation at being labeled a moron and her subsequent sterilization, Leilani was awarded C$750,000 and C$230,000 (together $ in dollars). Since the victory, another 1300 cases have been opened, several of them concerning individuals who may have actual mental disabilities. British Columbia In 1933 British Columbia became one of two provinces to implement a clear eugenic sexual sterilization law. The province's Sexual Sterilization Act, legislated in 1933 and repealed in 1973, closely resembled Alberta's 1928 legislation, although the practices differed. The Act created a Board of Eugenics, consisting of a judge, psychiatrist, and social worker. The Board was granted the authority to order the sterilization, with consent, of any inmate recommended to them by a superintendent, who \\"if discharged ... without being subjected to an operation for sexual sterilization would be likely to produce or bear children who by reason of inheritance would have a tendency to serious mental disease or mental deficiency\\". Many of the individuals presented for sterilization under the province's eugenics program came through Riverview Hospital (Essondale). In comparison to the \\"2834 individuals sterilized under Alberta's eugenic policy, historian Angus McLaren has estimated that in British Columbia no more than a few hundred individuals were sterilized\\".[2] The disparity between the numbers sterilized in the two provinces can be attributed in part to the tighter provisions of British Columbia's Sexual Sterilization Act. Whereas the Alberta legislation was amended twice to increase the program's scope and efficiency, British Columbia's sterilization program remained unchanged.[3] Although this appears to have settled the issue, in the early 1970s the public would learn that coercive sterilizations were in fact taking place in the North in spite of the lack of legislation. = Targeted Peoples = Concepts of race have long been connected to dealings with Aboriginal peoples in Canada. Eugenic ideology served as a convenient justification for the terrible circumstances created by colonization and was instrumental in determining how to interfere in the lives of Aboriginal peoples. Interventions were often guided by the view that the less progressed were a hazard to society and this justified drastic invasions in their lives. Initial measures advocated in the spirit of negative eugenics including marriage regulation, segregation and sterilization were all imposed on Aboriginal peoples. = Policy = http://alexwellerstein.com/publications/wellerstein_statesofeugenics.pdf The Canadian sterilization laws created a Eugenics Board that could impose sterilizations on people without their consent. This developed into a familiar practice, especially in relation to indigenous men, women and children. In 1926 Dr. Adolf Lorenz of Vancouver stated, \\"our sense of humanity is destroying humanity.Hegemonic Heterosexuality, Moral Regulation and the Rhetoric of Choice: Single Motherhood in the Canadian West, 1900 ‚Äì Mid 1970s Joanne Marie Ritcey 2009 We are allowing more and more of the poorer human stock to survive and reproduce. Sterilization was the best method to decrease the number of feeble-minded being produced. Once the feeble-minded were sterilized and the \\"problem cured.\\" In order to conclude who was a potential candidate for sterilization or institutionalization, intelligence tests were being overseen in schools, hospitals, and boys and girls schools. Intelligence tests were initiated in California, which also had the most active eugenic policy in the United States. Members of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia, such as the \\"Honourable William Sloan\\", stated California was the leader in developing and carrying out a eugenics act. In accordance with the Act, only people who were a \\"patient or in custody\\" of an institution as defined by the \\"Mental Hospitals Act\\" or the \\"Industrial Home for Girls\\" or the \\"industrial School Act\\" would be affected by the Act. These individuals, termed by the Act as \\"inmates\\", would be involved or living in Essondale (now known as Riverview Psychiatric Institution), or the Boys' or Girls' Industrial Schools (for children deemed delinquent). Decisions as to which inmates would be sterilized were to be made by the Board of Eugenics. The Board of Eugenics consisted of a judge, a psychiatrist, and a social worker who were appointed by the Lieutenant Governor in Council. The Board of Eugenics would receive recommendations from one of the above institutions if the superintendent of the institution believed that the release of an inmate would result \\"by reason of inheritance\\" in having children who would have \\"serious mental disease or mental deficiency.Cornwall, W. D. \\"Eugenics vs. Euthenics as a Method for Race Betterment\\". Canadian Medical Association Journal, October 1933; p. 444. The recommendations were to be in writing and were to include a history of the inmate to support the institution's recommendation for sexual sterilization. The inmate may, there after, be examined or seen by the Board of Eugenics. If after the examination of the inmate the Board of Eugenics unanimously agreed that this person would be likely to produce children who would have a serious mental disease or mental deficiency due to inheritance, the Board of Eugenics could order, in writing, that the sterilization take place. The Board of Eugenics would or could appoint the doctor who would perform the procedure. If the Board of Eugenics believed that the inmate was not capable of consent, a spouse, guardian, or family member would be requested give their for consent. If the inmate had no family, the Provincial Secretary, the predecessor of the Superintendent of the Ministry of Social Services, was to consent on the inmate's behalf.  United Nations Convention for the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide  Article II of the United Nations Convention for the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide defines genocide as any of the following acts committed with the intent to destroy in whole or in part a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group as such:https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%2078/volume-78-I-1021-English.pdf a) Killing members of the group; b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; d) Imposing measures to prevent births within the group; e) Forcibly transferring children from one group to another.

The formation of the Eugenics Society of Canada (ESC) in 1930 sought to organize supporters of eugenics into a coherent group in order to make their lobbying of the government more effective. Founded in Ontario, the ESC boasted a large number of physicians in its ranks, including Clarence Hincks, one of the most devoted proponents of the Alberta Sexual Sterilization Act. Other notable members included the Lieutenant-Governor of Ontario, Dr. H. A. Bruce, and eminent psychiatrist Clarence B. Farrar, who had been head of the Toronto Psychiatric Hospital since 1925. As social traits like criminality and promiscuity began to edge off the list of heritable traits, the ESC found itself adapting its strategy to that of birth control, while maintaining a focus on economic benefit. It garnered considerable support, but was never able to table eugenic sterilization effectively in the political arena. The ESC met its end shortly after a public relations blunder in 1938, when a representative implied the ESC and the Nazi party sought to achieve similar goals through similar means. It is not surprising then, that when World War II broke out in 1939, the ESC lost nearly all of its support. =Manitoba= Recent court discussions in Manitoba have investigated the legality and ethical permissibility of involuntary sterilization of the mentally disabled. Focusing on those individuals found legally incompetent, the 1990 and 1992 reports outlined the scenarios where an involuntary sterilization could be warranted. As stated by the 1990 discussion, three conditions are necessary for an individual to undergo any medical procedure. * The individual must be informed of both the nature, and risks/benefits of the procedure. * The consent must be voluntary, not the product of coercion, threat, or fraud. * The individual must be competent enough to give the above consent. Individuals who are legally incompetent include minors and sufficiently-disabled adults. The discussion reached a consensus that involuntary sterilization (or sterilization with substituted consent) is only permissible if it has an explicit positive effect on the physical or mental health of the individual: this is called therapeutic sterilization. One such case involved was a seriously disabled girl with an aversive phobia to blood, who was scheduled to undergo a hysterectomy. The rationale of the surgery was not eugenic, but rather to protect the girl from the direct mental trauma that would likely arise upon initiation of menses. This judgement was seen to be on the very threshold between therapeutic and nontherapeutic surgical intervention. This discussion also cites a landmark case in substituted consent known as the Mrs. E. vs. Eve case. In it, a mother, \\"Mrs. E.\\", wished to have her moderately intellectually disabled daughter \\"Eve\\" sterilized to save her the emotional distress potentially caused by pregnancy and childbirth. Additionally, it was argued that Eve would neither be capable of using any other method of contraception, nor caring for a child should she become pregnant. Since the sterilization was not explicitly therapeutic and carried grave physical harm and an intrusion on Eve's rights, Mrs. E. could not be given the authority to have her daughter sterilized. It was then explored whether or not the government itself could make the decision, using parens patriae jurisdiction. Parens patriae allows the government to make authorizations in the \\"best interests\\" where no other source of consent can be attained; this includes children and mentally disabled persons. In the Eve case, the risks were deemed too high and the benefits too obscure to authorize a nontherapeutic sterilization via parens patriae jurisdiction, since a surgical sterilization is an irreversible procedure.E.

Bravo's system emphasizes developing students for submission-only grappling competition rather than points, he focused his jiu-jitsu training without the traditional gi, becoming one of the first jiu-jitsu schools to do so. The idea behind this was to try to implement as many of the techniques as possible in mixed martial arts (MMA) competitions. Bravo worked for the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) during this time and felt high-level jiu-jitsu practitioners weren't winning as much as they should have, mainly attributing this to them wearing a gi when training jiu-jitsu but competing in MMA without one. 10th Planet Jiu-Jitsu has been controversial since its inception;https://bjj-world.com/top-10th-planet- jiu-jitsu-innovative-grappling-concepts-bravo-inside/ abandoning the gi drew some backlash from other Jiu-Jitsu schoolshttps://www.vice.com/en_us/article/mgyz8n/inside-eddie-bravos-10th- planet-jiu-jitsu and there has been debate as to how much 10th Planet techniques, most notably its iterations of the rubber guard, translates to MMA. In addition to the original 10th Planet headquarters in Los Angeles, there are over 100 schools worldwide. Some are established BJJ training facilities that have adopted the system as an expansion of the art. The style has spread overseas to Ireland, the United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden, Australia, and Korea.

Vindhyagiri was commissioned on 8 July 1981. Having served in the Indian Navy for nearly thirty years, the vessel sank a few hours after colliding with a merchant vessel on 30 January 2011. It was subsequently salvaged and then decommissioned on 11 June 2012. It served for 31 years in the navy and in its prime served as the flagship of the Western Naval Command. It was decommissioned a year earlier than envisaged due to the collision. Coup attempts In 1986, there was a series of coup attempts against President Ren√© led by the Seychelles Minister of Defence, Ogilvyi Berlouis. This included a plot in June 1986, codenamed Operation Distant Lash, which involved some 30 mercenaries and 350 Seychellois. When New Delhi was informed of an impending coup by intelligence sources, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi personally contacted the Indian Chief of Naval Staff, Admiral Radhakrishna Hariram Tahiliani, with a verbal request to provide assistance to Ren√©. Coincidentally, the Indian Navy had already dispatched the Vindhyagiri on a scheduled visit to Seychelles. It was decided that on arrival Vindhyagiri would report an engineering defect requiring an extended stay in Port Victoria. A senior Indian naval officer was then sent to the Seychelles on a commercial airline to command the operation and an \\"engineering\\" team of 20 sailors trained in weapons was readied for dispatch to Port Victoria. The extended presence of the Vindhyagiri in Port Victoria averted the planned coup. January 2011 collision On 30 January 2011, Vindhyagiri collided with the Cyprus-flagged merchant ship MV Nordlake near Sunk Rock lighthouse at the entrance of Mumbai harbour at 3:30 pm. It was reported that several civilians, including family members of the crew, were on board at the time of the incident. No casualties were reported. The collision caused major damage in the hull of the ship, affecting the boiler room and motor room. The collision also caused a major fire to break out, which took more than 15 hours to control. On 31 January 2011, Vindhyagiri settled on the sea bed at Berth No 5 the Mumbai Naval Dockyard due to flooding in some of its compartments from the collision and fire. Chief Public Relations Officer (Defence) Captain M. Nambiar told The Hindu newspaper that: \\"The place where the ship is berthed hardly has enough water. It is just seven metres deep. The ship touched the bottom because of flooding in some compartments. She is on the sea bed. Of course, she can be recovered.\\" After spending close to five months on the seabed, the ship was raised by the Titan Salvage company, with the assistance of the naval architect firm Salvage Master and a 24-hour diving crew. The procedure started with patches to the hull, followed by using multiple pumps to remove the water from inside the wreck, all while a giant floating crane lifted the wreck and kept it stable while the salvage crew performed their work. Decommissioning On 8 May 2012, the Bombay High Court granted permission to the Indian Navy to decommission and destroy the ship after one ammunition chamber could not be emptied. It was due to be expended as a target. The ship was decommissioned subsequently on 11 June 2012.

He held the highest rank in the kingdom, that of count (Latin comes), from at least 24 September 1089. He was the last Count of Asturias de Oviedo and was succeeded by a castellan, a novus homo, perhaps in an ecclesiastical‚Äìroyal effort to curtail the power of the Asturian aristocracy.Reilly (1982), 286‚Äì87. Santa Cruz de Casta√±eda, church passed on to Fernando's children by their aunt, Jimena Mu√±oz, and later donated to the Abbey of Cluny Fernando was the second son of Diego Fern√°ndez and his second wife, Cristina Fern√°ndez, daughter of Fernando Gundem√°riz and granddaughter of Gundemaro Pini√≥liz. His father and his elder brother Rodrigo before him were also Counts of Asturias. His younger sister Jimena was the wife of Rodrigo D√≠az de Vivar, el Cid.The genealogy is mapped out in Canal S√°nchez-Pag√≠n (1991), 23. Fernando's first wife was Goto Gonz√°lez, the eldest daughter of Gonzalo Salvad√≥rez and his first wife, Elvira D√≠az. Goto was dead by July 1087 when Fernando, as an executor of her will, made a donation to the monastery of San Salvador de O√±a of the land in Hermosilla inherited by Goto from her father and her uncle, √Ålvaro Salvad√≥rez. By 31 July 1096,On that date Fernandus comes et eius uxor Inderquina confirmed a donation made by Mar√≠a Pel√°ez to the monastery of Cornellana, cf. Barton (1997), 235. Fernando was married to Enderquina (Henderquina) Mu√±oz, a daughter of count Munio Gonz√°lez. As her arras (special gift of a husband to a wife) she received the monastery of Santa Mar√≠a in Oviedo on 17 April 1097.Barton (1997), 53. On 20 September 1120 the \\"children of count Fernando and countess Lady Enderquina\\" made a donation of the monastery of Santa Cruz de Casta√±eda to the Abbey of Cluny \\"for the souls\\" of their grandfather Munio and his wife Mayor. The names of Fernando's children with Enderquina were Diego, Munio, Sancha, Jimena, Aldonza, and Mar√≠a.This charter is edited and published in Canal S√°nchez-Pag√≠n (1991), 38‚Äì41. Fernando is first mentioned in a charter kept at the monastery of San Pedro de Eslonza and dated 15 October 1071.Barton (1997), 235, provides a set of vital statistics and a brief biography of Fernando, from which this article is largely drawn. There is a highly dubious reference to Fernando with the title of count, an act of Alfonso VI, dated 8 May 1080, but the first secure reference to Count Fernando dates to 1089.The 1080 document is accepted by Reilly (1989), 140. A document of 18 January 1086 preserved in the cartulary of San Vicente de OviedoA Benedictine monastery he patronised from as early as his donation of 4 December 1083, cf. Barton (1997), 235. is the earliest reference to his holding the tenencia of Asturias de Oviedo, which he had until at least the 7 February 1104. In April 1098 Fernando and Enderquina donated the monasteries of San Andr√©s de Ag√ºera and San Esteban de Villar de Cobos to a certain priest named Juan Pel√°ez of Belmonte de Miranda. According to the cartulary of the monastery of Sahag√∫n, Fernando visited the Holy Land and Jerusalem in 1100.Barton (1997), 155 n38, 212, and 235. Ferdinand witnessed the Sahag√∫n charter on 12 February 1101, signing Fernandus comes, anno quo uenit ex Iherosolimis (\\"Count Ferdinand, in the year that he came back from Jerusalem\\"). While this is usually taken to refer to a pilgrimage after the success of the First Crusade, it may indicate that Fernando was one of the few Spaniards who participated in the Crusade.Reilly (1989), 305. According to the Cr√≥nicas an√≥nimas de Sahag√∫n, in 1101 Alfonso VI received a decorated cross made from the wood of the True Cross from the Byzantine emperor Alexius I Comnenus. The king proceeded to donate it to the monastery of Sahag√∫n. It has been thought that Fernando probably brought the present back from Constantinople after his pilgrimage. Around 1104, Fernando and Enderquina were engaged in lawsuits with the bishop Pelagius of Oviedo concerning episcopal seignory in Asturias.Barton and Fletcher (2000), 67‚Äì68. These also involved Munio, the abbot of the San Juan Bautista de Corias, who had previously settled a division of serfs and properties with Fernando and Enderquina in 1097 and 1099. In 1104, Fernando and Enderquina exchanged the villa of Reconco for that of Laureda with the abbey of Corias. Fernando does not appear in any documents after 19 March 1106, and it has been speculated he died at the Battle of Ucl√©s in May 1108.Reilly (1989), 354. References *Barton, Simon (1997).

In 1213, it was granted to Donnchad mac Gilla Brigte, and passed into the possession of the de Lacys two years later. Later in the century, it passed into the possession of the Bissets.Williams (1990) p. 50. In 1306, after being defeated by Sir Aymer de Valence at the Battle of Methven, and then by the Lord of Lorne at the Battle of Strathfillan, King Robert I of Scotland retired to Rathlin Castle for the winter with a small following of his most faithful men, including James Douglas, Lord of Douglas, Bruce's brothers Thomas, Alexander and Edward, as well as Sir Neil Campbell and Malcolm II, the Earl of Lennox. They were welcomed by the owners of the island and castle, the Scoto-Irish Bissett family, lords of the Glens of Antrim, who were later dispossessed of it by the English for this reason. In July 1575, English forces led by Francis Drake and John Norreys attacked the castle with cannons and upon the surrender of the garrison of some MacDonnells of Antrim, the defenders, except for some prisoners, and the island's residents were put to the sword; the event is known as the Rathlin Island Massacre. The main army of MacDonnells of Antrim, led by Sorley Boy MacDonnell and stationed at Ballycastle, had witnessed the event taking place on Rathlin Island, where their families and valuables had been lodged for safety. Sorley Boy led his army in a successful retaliatory raid on Carrickfergus, from where the Rathlin Island raid had left.

From 1989 to 1990, he studied at the Cooperation College (Kooperativny technikum) of Chi»ôinƒÉu, going on to study law at the University of Ia»ôi (1990‚Äì1994). As a student, he was the leader of the \\"League of students from Bessarabia in Romania\\", an organization formed by Moldovan students in Romania. In Ia»ôi, among his classmates was Alexandru TƒÉnase. While he was a student in Ia»ôi, he met his wife Sanda in the autumn of 1991; they dated for only three months before they married. Between 1994‚Äì1998, Vlad Filat initiated and conducted more business in Romania.

Alliance for European Integration  After the July 2009 parliamentary election, alongside Mihai Ghimpu, Marian Lupu, and Serafim Urechean, Vlad Filat signed the Alliance For European Integration in a press- conference on August 8, 2009. Towards the end of August 2009, he became the candidate of the Alliance For European Integration for the post of Prime Minister of Moldova.

However, on April 22, 2013, the Constitutional Court ruled that this decree is unconstitutional, stating that a Prime Minister ousted by vote of no confidence following suspicions of corruption cannot further perform this duty and that the President has the constitutional obligation to appoint in the interim capacity a member of the government whose integrity was not affected.

Biography James Blenk was born in Edenkoben, Rhenish Palatinate, to James and Catherine (n√©e Wiedemann) Blenk. Born and raised in a Protestant family, he was the youngest of seventeen children and also a twin but his twin brother died at six months. In 1866 he and his family emigrated from Germany and moved to New Orleans, Louisiana, in the United States. His parents died only some weeks later and the orphan James Blenk was brought up in a Catholic family. Converting to Catholicism at age 12, Blenk was baptized at St. Alphonsus Church in 1869 and later confirmed by Archbishop Napol√©on-Joseph Perch√©.Points, Marie Louise. \\"New Orleans.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 11. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 26 February 2019 After completing his primary education in New Orleans, he entered Jefferson College (in Convent, Louisiana), eventually joining the Society of Mary (more commonly known as the Marist Fathers) 1878. He was then sent to the Marist House of Studies in Belley, France, and completed his probationary studies at the novitiate in Lyons before being sent to further his studies at the Catholic University of Ireland in Dublin. In Ireland, he taught mathematics at St. Mary's College, Dundalk (1881‚Äì82). Blenk was ordained to the priesthood by Archbishop Francis Redwood, S.M., on August 16, 1885. Upon his return to Louisiana in October 1885, he served as professor of humanities, rhetoric, philosophy, mathematics, and natural science at his alma mater of Jefferson College, where he later served as president from 1891 to 1897. In 1896, at the invitation of the superior general of the Marist Fathers, he visited all the houses of that religious institute in Europe. He returned to New Orleans in February 1897, and was named rector of the Church of the Holy Name of Mary in Algiers. When Archbishop Placide Louis Chapelle was chosen as Apostolic Delegate to Cuba and the Apostolic Nunciature to the Philippines in 1899, Blenk became auditor and secretary of the Apostolic Delegation. On June 12, 1899, Blenk was appointed Bishop of Puerto Rico by Pope Leo XIII.O'Brien, Miriam Therese. ‚ÄúPuerto Rico's First American Bishop.‚Äù Records of the American Catholic Historical Society of Philadelphia, vol. 91, no. 1/4, 1980, pp. 3‚Äì37. JSTOR He received his episcopal consecration on the following July 2 from Archbishop Chapelle, with Bishops Gustave Rouxel and Theophile Meerschaert serving as co-consecrators. Before his departure for Puerto Rico, the island was struck by Hurricane San Ciriaco; through his personal efforts he raised $30,000 to take with him to alleviate the sufferings of his new congregation. During his tenure, Blenk established a college and founded several schools and convents. He was, however, forced to suppress the seminary due to a lack of resources and seminarians. He also renovated the Cathedral of San Juan Bautista for over $12,000. Blenk was promoted to the seventh Archbishop of New Orleans on April 20, 1906. He received the pallium, a vestment worn by metropolitan bishops, on April 24, 1907. During his tenure, Blenk systematized the Catholic school system in New Orleans, unifying and standardizing the Catholic educational board and insisting upon the establishment of parochial schools in each parish. He also continued the practice of segregated parishes for African Americans and established several himself, including St. Dominic ParishSt. Dominic Parish, New Orleans in 1909. He believed it was through segregated churches that \\"racial feelings and natural differences can be best adjusted.\\" He also organized the Louisiana State Federation of Catholic Societies (1908), Catholic Societies of Women of Louisiana (1911), Knights of Peter Claver at Opelousas (1912), and Catholic Women's Club (1916).

It was released on August 12, 2009 as part of the second annual Xbox Live Summer of Arcade and was later re-released in a retail pack alongside Limbo and 'Splosion Man in April 2011. It is a 2.5D puzzle/racing game. The player must guide a trial motorcycle with exaggerated physics through various obstacles to reach each stage's finish line. On September 6, 2012 it was announced that a Microsoft Windows version of Trials HD would be bundled inside a special version of Trials Evolution, dubbed Trials Evolution: Gold Edition‚Äîalthough this version changes the physics of the game. It is the third game in the series. On February 11, 2016, Microsoft added Trials HD as part of its backwards compatibility program for Xbox One. Gameplay In Trials HD players must manipulate the rider and motorcycle to traverse obstacles and objects found throughout each level. In Trials HD the player controls a rider on a physics-based motorcycle from the start of the level to the end while navigating a number of obstacles. The objective is to complete the course as fast as possible and with as few crashes, known in the game as faults, as possible. The game uses 3D graphics, but is played on a 2D plane, so the rider can only move forwards and backwards. Players can also control the bike's pitch at slow speeds or while in the air. The game has a variety of courses in a range of difficulties from beginner to extreme. There are a total of thirty-five courses in the game, and players can replay completed courses to attempt a faster time. Tournament mode sees the player attempt to complete a number of courses in sequence, trying to achieve a fast overall time with minimal faults. Twelve skill games can also be unlocked which place the player in different challenges. These include things such as riding inside or on top of a large spherical cage, achieving as many flips as possible within a set time limit, or towing a trailer with two large bombs as far as possible while keeping them from exploding by impact. Players earn medals based on their completion time, number of faults, and in the case of skill games, other specialized criteria. When connected to Xbox Live, the player can view their performance in relation to players in their friends list. This is done by an in-game meter which displays the closest friend to the player's time which adjusts based on whether the player is leading or trailing the friend's course time. Trials HD includes a level editor that allows players to construct their own courses and share them with players in their friends list. Every course in the game was created using the level editor, which allows users to create professional-quality levels. It also features leaderboards for each of the game's courses and modes. For each course the fastest five thousand times are able to be viewed as replays. During the replay the viewer can view that recorded player's controller presses, allowing them to learn patterns and skills from it. Development and marketing Trials HD is the second 2.5D game in the Trials series, following Trials 2: Second Edition. The game is based on the popular flash games from the same series. It was released on August 12, 2009 as part of the second annual Xbox Live Summer of Arcade. RedLynx developed Trials HD using an in- house engine coupled with a modified version of Bullet Physics Library which was optimized to utilize the Xbox 360's CPU and vector units. RedLynx applied the physics system to give a realistic feel, but to maintain the enjoyment of a video game, they tweaked the physics to \\"bend the reality in just the proper way.\\" RedLynx saw this as a \\"crucial thing in making Trials such a fun and addictive game\\" Previous Trials games used a much simpler in-house physics engine, however for Trials HD developers opted to use the Bullet library and devote one of the 360's cpu cores entirely to physics. Developers also improved on the Trials 2 engine by adding more advanced lighting and real time soft shadows. Trials HD levels were created using the same in-game editor which players can also use to create and share their own levels. Levels created for Trials HD were designed using the same in-game level editor that allows players to make user-based content. All of the tools and abilities the developers had at their disposal can be used by the community. In an interview with Eurogamer, RedLynx's Lead Programmer Sebastian Aaltonen stated that there were no plans to port the game to other platforms, adding \\"Trials HD technology has been specially designed for the Xbox 360 feature-set.\\" The voice work for the game was done by three Pennsylvanian voice actors, Rake Yohn, Brandon DiCamillo, and Art Webb. Trials HD was announced June 1, 2009 at a Microsoft luncheon during E3 2009. It was released August 12, 2009 as part of the Xbox Live Summer of Arcade. On December 23, 2009 the first downloadable content, known as the Trials HD Big Pack, was released. The content features twenty three new courses, new objects for the game's built-in level creator and new achievements. A second downloadable content pack was announced for the game in July 2010. The Trials HD Big Thrills Pack features forty new courses made by RedLynx, but unlike the Trials HD Big Pack it also features ten user created courses. These ten courses are to be decided from entries to the Big Thrills Track Creation Competition. The top three contestants were awarded prizes of $5,000, $3,000, and $1,000, respectively. Winners were announced on November 15, 2010. The Big Thrills Pack was released December 1, 2010. Reception and sales Trials HD received \\"favorable\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In its first month, the title sold over 300 thousand units. On September 14, 2010 RedLynx announced that Trials HD had surpassed 1.3 million units in sales. Sales of the first downloadable content pack had also exceeded 360 thousand, with the second pack selling over 90 thousand units. On May 27, 2011 RedLynx announced that sales have exceeded two million units. In 2009, Trials HD received two awards voted on by the Xbox 360 community, Best Overall Arcade Game and Best Innovation. In a September 2010 ranking, IGN listed Trials HD sixteenth in their top twenty-five Xbox Live Arcade titles of all time. It was also awarded a perfect score by Xbox World 360. Reviewers generally praised the game's replay value. IGN's Daemon Hatfield remarked that Trials HD had \\"truckloads of content\\" adding that the game's features \\"really take advantage of what can be done with Xbox Live.\\" GameTrailers staff also praised the amount of content in the game stating that it was an excellent value for the price. Eurogamer stated that \\"it's a game built for endless replay and community expansion beyond that.\\" The game's leaderboards, especially the ability to have a view of where other players were at a certain time during a run, were widely praised by Brad Shoemaker of Giant Bomb. One of the primary criticisms given by critics was Trials HDs steep difficulty curve. Brad Shoemaker of Giant Bomb stated that he wished the difficulty curve was \\"a little smoother.\\" Daemon Hatfield of IGN further commented on the game's difficulty, stating \\"It's when you get stuck trying to get over some small hill and you see that fault counter in the top left corner counting up [...] that the game starts being more frustrating than fun.\\" GameSpy's Anthony Gallegos added that the \\"limited number of tries per track feels arbitrary.\\" He was also critical of the game's file sharing system, noting that instead of a repository from which to download tracks that sharing is limited to those in the player's friends list. Tom McShea of GameSpot also agreed that the difficulty on the latter tracks was \\"ridiculously hard\\" and shared disappointment in the file sharing system.

It was headed by a dynasty of Ashikaga rulers called Kamakura Kub≈ç (or Kant≈ç Kub≈ç). They were assisted by deputies called Kant≈ç Kanrei traditionally chosen among the members of the Uesugi clan. Structurally, the Kamakura-fu was a small-scale duplicate of Kyoto's government, had full judiciary and executive powers within its territories and was responsible for its military.Shirai (1976:78) At first its territory included just the eight Kant≈ç provinces (the ), plus Kai and Izu.Iwanami Nihonshi Jiten, Kamakura-fu Later, Kant≈ç Kub≈ç Ashikaga Ujimitsu was given by the shogunate as a reward for his military support the two huge provinces of Mutsu and Dewa. History of the Kamakura- fu The stele that marks the spot in Kamakura where the kub≈ç's mansion, seat of the government, used to stand In 1333, immediately after the Kamakura shogunate's fall, Emperor Go-Daigo wanted to re-establish his rule in Kamakura and the east of the country without sending there a sh≈çgun, as this was seen, just a year from Kamakura's fall, as still too dangerous. As a compromise, he sent his six-year-old son Prince Norinaga to Mutsu Province (in today's Aomori region) and nominated him Governor-General of the Mutsu and Dewa Provinces. In an obvious reply to this move, Ashikaga Tadayoshi, without an order from the Emperor escorted another of his sons, eleven-year-old Prince Nariyoshi (a.k.a. Narinaga) to Kamakura, where he installed him as Governor of the K≈çzuke Province with himself as a Deputy and de facto ruler. Since he ruled without interference from Kyoto and the area in itself was in effect a miniature shogunate, this event can be considered the first embryo of what was going soon to be the Ashikaga shogunate.Yasuda (1990:22) Ashikaga Takauji, founder of the Ashikaga shogunate which, at least nominally, ruled Japan during the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries, at first established his residence deliberately at the same site in Kamakura where Yoritomo's ≈åkura Bakufu had been, but in 1336 he left Kamakura in charge of his son Yoshiakira and went west in pursuit of Nitta Yoshisada.Sansom (1977:22) Persistent problems with Emperor Go-Daigo then convinced Takauji of the necessity to stay in the East. The Ashikaga ended up residing permanently in Kyoto, making Kamakura instead the capital of the , a region including the provinces of Sagami, Musashi, Awa, Kazusa, Shim≈çsa, Hitachi, K≈çzuke, Shimotsuke (the so-called Hassh≈´), plus Kai and Izu. The Kamakura-fu was therefore the equivalent of today's Kant≈ç, plus the Shizuoka and Yamanashi Prefectures.Matsuo (1997:V‚ÄìVI) In 1391 Kub≈ç Ashikaga Ujimitsu was rewarded by sh≈çgun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu for his help against the Yamana clan with the two huge provinces of Dewa and Mutsu, bringing the total to twelve provinces. The de facto beginning of the Kamakura-fu can be considered the arrival in Kamakura Ashikaga Takauji's son Yoshiakira. As already mentioned, Yoshiakira had been sent by his father to the Kant≈ç in 1336 as his representative.Kokushi Daijiten (1983:542) The first official Kamakura- fu however was born in 1349 when Ashikaga Motouji was sent to Kamakura by his father to replace Yoshiakira, who was wanted in Kyoto. Motouji was followed in order by Ashikaga Ujimitsu, Mitsukane, Mochiuji, and Shigeuji, all of his bloodline. Motouji had been sent by his father, sh≈çgun Ashikaga Takauji, precisely because the latter understood the importance of controlling the Kant≈ç region and wanted to have an Ashikaga ruler there, but the administration in Kamakura was from the beginning characterized by its rebelliousness, so the sh≈çguns idea never really worked and actually backfired.Jansen (1995:119:120) The problems that had characterized the institution from its beginning culminated in 1439, when Mochiuji was deposed and the Kamakura-fu retaken by force. After a lapse of ten years, an effort was made to revive the institution and Ashikaga Shigeuji was sent to take his father Mochiuji's place. Tensions between the Kub≈ç, on one side, and the shogunate and the Uesugi Kanrei on the other immediately resurfaced and in 1455 Shigeuji was forced to flee Kamakura to the friendly city of Koga in today's Ibaraki Prefecture, never to return. The Kamakura-fu's organization thereafter changed greatly, as it was left in the hands of the Uesugi clan, until then at the orders of the Kub≈ç. The Uesugi slowly started to exercise their power to their advantage, and not to Kyoto's, and the Kamakura-fu for all practical purposes ceased to exist. However, according to the Shinpen Kamakurashi, a guide book published in 1685, more than two centuries later the spot where the kub≈ç's mansion had been was still left empty by local peasants in the hope he may one day return.Takahashi (2005:21) See also *Kanrei *Kant≈ç kub≈ç *Uesugi clan Notes  References  * Iwanami Nihonshi Jiten (Â≤©Ê≥¢Êó•Êú¨Âè≤ËæûÂÖ∏), CD-Rom Version.

The name frawardigan is a Zoroastrian Middle Persian allusion to the fravashis, which - among other aspects (including the souls of the living and the not-yet born)- also include the souls of the dead. The practice is however much older than this name, and it is already attested in the Avesta, specifically Yasht 13.49, where it is called Hamaspathmaidyem in Avestan, of uncertain meaning. In modern times the festival is also called mukhtad or panji, and in English \\"all souls\\" festival. Like all other Zoroastrian festivals, Frawardigan was originally a one-day festival, in this case observed on the last day of the religious year. That day, the last day of the religious year, is now known as Pateti, from patet, \\"confession\\", a day of self-reflection prior to the celebration of Zoroastrian New Year's Day. As is also the case for other Zoroastrian festivals, the calendar reforms initiated during the 3rd or 4th century resulted in the one- day observance being extended to a five-day observance, in this case during the last five days of the twelfth month. The calendar reforms also introduced five intercalary days (\\"Gatha\\" days) following the twelfth month, and so, because the \\"all souls\\" festival was conventionally observed on the last day of the year, the festival was then also observed during the newly introduced last days of the year, i.e. the five intercalary days. Taken together, Frawardigan thus came to span the last five days of the last month of the religious year (called the \\"lesser five\\" days of Frawardigan), plus the \\"greater five\\" intercalary days at the end of the religious year. Among Indian Zoroastrians, an extended mukhtad of eighteen days is also observed. Frawardigan should not be confused with Fraward Jashan, which is a name-day feast celebrated on the 19th day (named frawarden) of the 1st month (also frawarden) of the Zoroastrian calendar. In medieval times, as known from Al- Biruni's 10th-century Chronology, for the ten days before Zoroastrian New Year's Day consecrated food was set out to feed the spirits of one's ancestors, and the spirits of the pious were believed to return for a while‚Äîinvisible to the living‚Äîto be among their families. Still today, in both Indian Zoroastrian communities (Parsi and Irani), houses are meticulously cleaned and made ready for the annual coming of spirits, and a lamp is lit to welcome them, and kept alight for the duration of the festival. Frawardigan is colored by a sense of happiness and family piety, and is hardly touched by any dread of the other world. Frawardigan is also seen as a period of reflection: an opportunity to examine one's conscience and repent for past wrongs. In the present day, Zoroastrians congregate in the fire temples to offer prayers on behalf of their ancestors. After the worship, families will offer fruit, flowers, incense, wood, and money in individual rituals conducted by a priest around a small temple fire.

The plan would create diocese-like structures for former Anglicans within the Roman Catholic Church independent of existing Latin Rite dioceses. It would allow them to preserve elements of Anglican liturgy, spirituality and religious practice, including married priests but not married bishops.

Benedict's decision to step down as leader of the Catholic Church made him the first pope to relinquish the office since Gregory XII in 1415 (who did so in order to end the Western Schism), the first to do so on his own initiative since Celestine V in 1294, =Francis= Pope Francis (left) and his predecessor Pope emeritus Benedict XVI (right) Since the election of Pope Francis in 2013, he has displayed a simpler and less formal approach to the office, choosing to reside in the Vatican guesthouse rather than the papal residence. Following the resignation of Benedict, Francis became the first Jesuit pope, the first pope from the Americas, and the first from the Southern Hemisphere.Cardinal Walter Kasper Says Pope Francis Will Bring New Life To Vatican II On 18 June 2015, Francis released his encyclical Laudato si', in which he critiqued consumerism and irresponsible development, laments environmental degradation and global warming, and calls all people of the world to take \\"swift and unified global action.\\" Since 2016, Francis has faced increasingly open criticism, particularly from theological conservatives, on the question of admitting civilly divorced and remarried Catholics to Communion with the publication of Amoris Laetitia, and on the question of alleged systematic cover up of clergy sexual abuse. In September 2016, Cardinals Raymond Burke, Carlo Caffarra, Walter Brandm√ºller, and Joachim Meisner wrote a letter to Francis, requesting that he clarify five statements from Amoris laetitia. After the letter was ignored, the cardinals publicized their letter, popularly known as the dubia. The following year, in August 2017, a filial correction was issued by 62 critics of Pope Francis including Bishop Ren√© Henry Gracida of Corpus Christi, Bishop Bernard Fellay of the Society of Saint Pius X, and Joseph Shaw, the chairman of the Latin Mass Society. Among Francis's most notable critics is Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigan√≤ a former apostolic nuncio who claimed in an open letter that Francis \\"knew from at least June 23, 2013 that Theodore McCarrick was a serial predator. He knew that he was a corrupt man, he covered for him to the bitter end.\\" McCarrick submitted his resignation from the College of Cardinals in July 2018, which was quickly accepted by Francis. Francis ordered McCarrick to a life of prayer and penance until a canonical trial could be held.US prelate McCarrick resigns from College of Cardinals (AP) After a church investigation and trial, he was found guilty of sexual crimes against adults and minors and abuse of power, and was dismissed from the clergy in February 2019. McCarrick is the most senior church official in modern times to be laicized commonly referred to as defrocking and is believed to be the first cardinal ever laicized for sexual misconduct. On 9 May 2019, Francis issued the motu proprio Vos estis lux mundi, establishing new procedural norms to combat sexual abuse and to ensure that bishops and religious superiors are held accountable for their actions. On 2 August 2018, it was announced that the Catechism of the Catholic Church would be revised to state that the Church teaches that \\"the death penalty is inadmissible because it is an attack on the inviolability and dignity of the person\\". A full letter to the bishops regarding the change stated that it was consistent with the previous teachings of the Catholic Church regarding the dignity of human life, and that it reflected how modern society had better prison systems with a goal of criminal rehabilitation that made the death penalty unnecessary for the protection of innocent people. Within two weeks, 45 Catholic scholars and clergy signed an appeal to the cardinals of the Catholic Church, calling on them to advise Pope Francis to retract the recent revision made to the Catechism, on the grounds that its appearance of contradicting scripture and traditional teaching is causing scandal. In October 2019, a Synod of Bishops for the Pan-Amazon region was held in Vatican City \\"to identify new paths for the evangelization of God's people in that region\\", specifically the indigenous peoples who are \\"often forgotten and without the prospect of a serene future\\". The synod was largely focused on issues of married viri probati priests and allowing the institution of deaconesses. The Amazon synod also drew attention after accusations of idolatry arose after videos from the synod featuring statues, allegedly of the Andean fertility goddess Pachamama, surfaced online. On 21 October 2019, Alexander Tschugguel removed several Pachamama statues from Santa Maria in Transpontina, took them to Ponte Sant'Angelo, and threw them into the River Tiber. Pope Francis responded by denouncing the removal of the statues and stating that the statues had been kept at the church \\"without idolatrous intentions.\\" In November 2019, a group of 100 conservative and traditionalists Catholics accused Francis of indulging in \\"sacrilegious and superstitious acts\\" during the synod. On 2 February 2020, Francis published the apostolic exhortation Querida Amazonia, ignoring the question of married priests, calling for women to be given greater roles in the Church, but not within the holy orders of the diaconate or the priesthood, and promoting inculturation with a request that the faithful \\"respect native forms of expression in song, dance, rituals, gestures and symbols\\". In March 2020 all public masses were suspended in Vatican City and Italy due to the coronavirus pandemic. These suspensions began in late-February in the Archdioceses of Milan and Venice and were extended to the rest of the Italian peninsula on 8 March. Setting an example for churches unable to celebrate public masses due to the lockdown, Pope Francis began livestreaming daily masses from his home at Domus Sanctae Marthae on 9 March. Outside Italy, masses in cities around the world were suspended in the days that followed. At the height of the outbreak in Italy, on 27 March, Pope Francis imparted the Urbi et Orbi blessing, normally reserved for Christmas and Easter, from an empty Saint Peter's Square following a prayer for the health of all the world.. For the prayer service, Francis brought the crucifix from San Marcello al Corso which had processed through the streets of Rome during the miraculous plague cure of 1522. The prayer service concluded with Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament, as church bells were rung and sirens blared across Rome.. The spread of COVID-19 soon slowed in Italy and public masses were allowed to resume on 18 May, with Pope Francis celebrating his last daily live-stream mass and first public mass since the lockdown on the centenary of the birth of Pope John Paul II. Eastern Orthodoxy St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church in New York City, currently under construction after the original church was destroyed in the September 11 attacks After the fall of Mosul, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant demanded that Assyrian Christians living in the city convert to Islam, pay tribute, or face execution, by 19 July 2014. Al-Baghdadi further noted that Christians who do not agree to follow those terms must \\"leave the borders of the Islamic Caliphate\\" within a specified deadline. This resulted in a complete Assyrian Christian exodus from Mosul, marking the end of 1,600 years of continuous Christian presence. A church mass was not held in Mosul for the first time in 1,800 years. On 9 July 2017, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider Al-Abadi arrived in preparation to announce the full liberation of Mosul and reclaim the city after three years of ISIL control.Mosul: Iraq PM to celebrate victory over IS in the city BBC, 9 July 2017 = Pan-Orthodox Council = The Pan-Orthodox Council, officially styled the Holy and Great Synod, opened at Crete, on 19 June 2016. The 10 Churches that sent representatives to Crete were the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople and the Orthodox Churches of Alexandria, Jerusalem, Serbia, Romania, Greece, Poland, Albania, Cyprus and the Czech Lands and Slovakia. Of the 14 national Orthodox churches, four did not attend the event, including the Russian Orthodox Church, the Georgian and Bulgarian Orthodox Churches, as well as the Orthodox Church of Antioch. The Council concluded on 26 June 2016, the Sunday of All Saints, with a Patriarchal Concelebration. = 2018 Moscow‚ÄìConstantinople schism = Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew (left) handing the tomos of autocephaly to Metropolitan Epiphanius (right), January 6, 2019 On 11 October 2018, the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople announced it would grant autocephaly to the \\"Church of Ukraine\\" thus separating it from the canonical jurisdiction of the Moscow Patriarchate. Four days later, the Moscow Patriarchate broke the communion with the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople over the latter's endorsement of the Ukrainian Orthodox church's autocephaly. The decision was made following a meeting of the Russian Holy Synod in Minsk, the capital of Belarus. Metropolitan Hilarion announced that the Moscow Patriarchate had taken the decision to \\"rupture full communion with the Constantinople Patriarchate\\", meaning that priests from the two churches will not be able to serve together while worshippers of one cannot take communion in the other. Two months later, on 15 December 2018, a unification council was convoked by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople at St Sophia's Cathedral in Kiev, during which the Kiev Patriarchate, the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church and parts of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) were united into a single church: the Ukrainian Orthodox Church. Metropolitan Epiphanius was elected the first Metropolitan of Kiev and All Ukraine of the newly unified Ukrainian church. Patriarch Kirill of Moscow denounced the new Ukrainian Church as \\"a union of two schismatic groups.\\" On 5 January 2019, Patriarch Bartholomew signed a tomos officially granting autocephaly to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church. The tomos was signed at St. George's Cathedral in the presence of Petro Poroshenko, the President of Ukraine, and was presented to Metropolitan Epiphanius to be brought to Kiev in time for Christmas, the first liturgy celebrated by the united Ukrainian Orthodox Church. On 30 May 2019, Vladimir Legoyda, head of the Synodal Department for Church, Society and Media Relations of the ROC, said the ROC was aware of the efforts of the Church of Cyprus primate, Chrysostomos II, and added that \\"to some extent [Chrysostomos'] actions can be considered in line with the ROC proposal (...) He has consistently held talks with representatives from various local Churches, telling of the need to resolve the problem\\" Legoyda also said the ROC \\"has repeatedly stressed the desire and the need for a pan-Orthodox decision on this issue because it cannot be resolved unilaterally\\" On 12 October 2019, the Orthodox Church of Greece recognized the Autocephaly of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine, stating that \\"the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople has the right to granting autocephalies\\" Protestantism Mars Hill Church, part of the emerging church movement, closed in 2015 =Megachurches= Postmodern Christianity has influenced the emerging church movement, with proponents challenging the mainstream Christianity on issues such as: institutional structures, systematic theology, propositional teaching methods, a perceived preoccupation with buildings, an attractional understanding of mission, professional clergy, and a perceived preoccupation with the political process and unhelpful jargon (\\"Christian-ese\\"). Globally, megachurches are a significant development in Protestant Christianity.Anne C. Loveland, Otis B. Wheeler, From Meetinghouse to Megachurch: A Material and Cultural History, University of Missouri Press, USA, 2003, p. 3 In the United States, the phenomenon has more than quadrupled in the past two decades. It has since spread worldwide. In 2007, five of the ten largest Protestant churches were in South Korea. The largest megachurch in the United States is Lakewood Church in Houston, Texas with more than 40,000 members every weekend and the current largest megachurch in the world is South Korea's Yoido Full Gospel Church, an Assemblies of God church, with more than 830,000 members as of 2007. Mark Driscoll, a leader in the emerging church movement, had more than 12,000 followers at Mars Hill Church in Seattle, Washington before controversy led to Driscoll's resignation in 2014 and Mars Hill's dissolution. Like other churches in the emerging church movement, Mars Hill combined alternative worship with Calvinist theology. In 2015, not without controversy, a video featuring Driscoll was featured at a Hillsong Church conference in Sydney, Australia. Hillsong Church is a megachurch, founded in 1983, that has grown to over 100,000 followers. Their 2013 song \\"Oceans (Where Feet May Fail)\\" was released and spent 61 weeks atop the Billboard Hot Christian Songs chart, longer than any other song. Some megachurches, including Lakewood and Yoido Full, teach prosperity theology, a controversial doctrine seen as a heresy by most Christians. In 2007, U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley opened a probe into the finances of six televangelism ministries that promoted prosperity theology: Kenneth Copeland Ministries, Creflo Dollar Ministries, Benny Hinn Ministries, Bishop Eddie Long Ministries, Joyce Meyer Ministries, and Paula White Ministries. In January 2011, Grassley concluded his investigation stating that he believed self-regulation by religious organizations was preferable to government action. Only the ministries led by Meyer and Hinn cooperated with Grassley's investigation. The inauguration of Donald Trump as the 45th President of the United States in 2017 featured prayers from two preachers known for advocating prosperity theology. Paula White, one of Trump's spiritual advisers, gave the invocation. The heterodox Shincheonji megachurch was the source of the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea, with most cases in South Korea being tied to the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus within the megachurch. On 1 March 2020, Seoul mayor Park Won-soon announced that the Seoul City Government had made a criminal complaint about the church's pastor Lee Man-hee, whom Shincheonji adherents believed to be the messiah, asking for an investigation into him and twelve others connected to the sect on charges of murder by negligence and violations of the Disease Control Act, citing their negligence in preventing an outbreak among their congregants and their refusal to cooperate with the government throughout the crisis. =Anglican Communion= Holy Trinity Anglican Church, an ANCA church built in 2015 in Raleigh, North Carolina One month prior to the Lambeth Conference, the ten- yearly gathering of Anglican Communion bishops, a seven-day conference of conservative Anglican bishops and leaders held in Jerusalem from 22 to 29 June 2008 to address the growing controversy of the divisions in the Anglican Communion, the rise of secularism, as well as concerns with HIV/AIDS and poverty. As a result of the conference, the Jerusalem Declaration was issued and the Fellowship of Confessing Anglicans was created. The conference participants also called for the creation of the Anglican Church in North America (ANCA), as an alternative to the Episcopal Church in the United States and the Anglican Church of Canada, and declared that recognition by the Archbishop of Canterbury is not necessary to Anglican identity. Follow-up conferences have been held every five years since 2008. The conventions of four dioceses of the Episcopal Church voted in 2007 and 2008 to leave that church and to join the Anglican Church of the Southern Cone of America. Twelve other jurisdictions, serving an estimated 100,000 persons at that time, formed the ACNA on December 3‚Äì4, 2008. The ACNA is seeking official recognition as a province within the Anglican Communion. The Anglican Church of Nigeria declared itself in communion with the new church in March 2009 and the Fellowship of Confessing Anglicans recognized it as well. In June 2009, the Anglican Church of Uganda also declared itself in full communion with ACNA, and the Anglican Church of Sudan followed suit in December 2011. Two of the major events which contributed to the Anglican realignment were the 2002 decision of the Diocese of New Westminster in Canada to authorise a rite of blessing for same-sex unions, and the nomination of two openly gay priests in 2003 to become bishops. Jeffrey John, an openly gay priest with a long-time partner, was appointed to be the next Bishop of Reading in the Church of England and the General Convention of the Episcopal Church ratified the election of Gene Robinson, an openlyBBC ‚Äì US Church 'unfairly criticised' 01 Jan 2008 Bishop Schori \\"He [Robinson] is alone in being the only gay partnered bishop who's open about that status.\\" (But see Otis Charles). gay non- celibateThe issue is less sexual orientation than sexual practice. Many conservative Anglicans disapprove of his being openly sexually active more than his sexual attractions as such. man, as Bishop of New Hampshire. Jeffrey John ultimately declined the appointment due to pressure. =United Methodist Church= Like many other mainline Protestant denominations in the United States, the United Methodist Church has experienced significant membership losses in recent decades. By the opening of the 2008 General Conference, total UMC membership was estimated at 11.4 million, with about 7.9 million in the US and 3.5 million overseas. Significantly, about 20 percent of the conference delegates were from Africa, with Filipinos and Europeans making up another 10 percent. During the conference, the delegates voted to finalize the induction of the Methodist Church of the Ivory Coast and its 700,000 members into the denomination. One Congolese bishop has estimated that typical Sunday attendance of the UMC is higher in his country than in the entire United States. Given current trends in the UMC, with overseas churches growing, especially in Africa, and US churches collectively losing about 1,000 members a week, American influence on the UMC is declining. In February 2019, a Special Session of the General Conference of the United Methodist Church was held in St. Louis, Missouri, to examine church teachings on human sexuality. While most American delegates at the General Conference supported the One Church Plan, a resolution that would have made the UMC open and affirming on LGBT issues, allowing individual conferences to allow same-sex marriage and openly gay clergy, the resolution failed. In its place, the Traditional Plan, opposed by most American delegates but supported by the African delegates, was passed by the conference. The Traditional Plan reaffirms traditional teachings on sexuality, penalizes UMC clergy who conduct same-sex marriages or ordain openly gay clergy beginning in 2020. Some conferences have allowed both same- sex marriage and openly gay clergy for years. One conference in the American Southwest has a lesbian bishop, Karen Oliveto. It is unknown how these clergy will be affected by the rule change. A similar General Conference decision in 1984 led to the early retirement of some openly gay clergy, including Paul Abels. Many progressive clergy have vowed to ignore the new rules if and when they come into effect, and many clergy and congregations are openly contemplating the idea of a schism within the United Methodist Church. With the Traditional Plan in place, the UMC increasingly saw schism as inevitable and so plans were drawn up to be voted upon at 2020 General Conference. However, due to the coronavirus pandemic, the General Conference was delayed to 2021. Oriental Orthodoxy St. Giragos Armenian Church in Turkey, restored and reopened in 2011 and reconfiscated by the Turkish government in 2016 =Armenian Church= The construction of the Holy Mother of God Cathedral in Stepanakert, Nagorno-Karabakh began in 2006.http://en.hayernaysor.am/2015/11/04/ Construction of St. Mary Mother Cathedral of Stepanakert In October 2013 Father Asoghik Karapetyan, the director of the Museum of the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin, stated on television that an atheist Armenian is not a \\"true Armenian\\". A spokesperson for the Armenian Apostolic Church stated that it is his personal view. The statement received considerable criticism, though Asoghik did not retract his statement. In an editorial in the liberal Aravot daily Aram Abrahamyan suggested that religious identity should not be equated with national (ethnic) identity and it is up to every individual to decide whether they are Armenian or not, regardless of religion. According to a 2018 survey by the Pew Research Center, in Armenia 82% of respondents say it is very or somewhat important to be a Christian to be truly Armenian. On 23 April 2015, the Armenian Apostolic Church canonized all of the victims of the Armenian Genocide as martyrs, which began a hundred years prior to the following day on 24 April 1915; this service is believed to be the largest canonization service in history. It was the first canonization by the Armenian Apostolic Church in four hundred years. On 25 September 2017, a deaconess was consecrated in the Tehran Diocese of the Armenian Apostolic Church, the first Armenian deaconess in a hundred years. On 2 October 2019, Turkish newspaper H√ºrriyet reported on a 2012 lawsuit advancing through Turkish courts; the lawsuit was filed by Patriarch Nourhan Manougian of Jerusalem in an attempt to reclaim patriarchate property confiscated by the Turkish government during the Armenian genocide in 1915. According to Patriarch Manougian, the \\"Armenian Patriarchate in Jerusalem owned around 1,200 properties in Istanbul alone\\" prior to the genocide. The court had originally dismissed the case in 2012, despite the patriarchate winning an appeal, but a decision from the Constitutional Court of Turkey ruled on 12 September 2019 that the previous court had violated the rights of the patriarchate. =Coptic Church= Cathedral of the Nativity in Cairo, the largest church in the Middle East, consecrated in 2019 In Tahrir Square, Cairo, on Wednesday 2 February 2011, Coptic Christians joined hands to provide a protective cordon around their Muslim neighbors during salat (prayers) in the midst of the 2011 Egyptian Revolution.Christians protect Muslims during prayer in Cairo's dangerous Tahrir square, Nevine Zaki, 3 February 2011, accessed 9 February 2011 On 17 March 2012, the Coptic Orthodox Pope, Pope Shenouda III died, leaving many Copts mourning and worrying as tensions rose with Muslims. Pope Shenouda III constantly met with Muslim leaders in order to create peace. Many were worried about Muslims controlling Egypt as the Muslim Brotherhood won 70% of the parliamentary elections. Pope Tawadros II was chosen to replace him on 4 November 2012. In February 2015, twenty-one Coptic Christians were kidnapped and beheaded in Libya by ISIS insurgents. Six days later, they were canonized as martyrs by Pope Tawadros II. In January 2017, following twin terrorist attacks that killed at least 27 Coptic Egyptians at St. Peter and St. Paul's Church in Cairo in December 2016, the President of Egypt Abdel Fattah el-Sisi commissioned the construction of the country's largest mosque and church in the new administrative capital to become symbols of coexistence and national unity. For decades, the building of churches in Egypt was restricted to avoid offending Islam. The Cathedral of the Nativity in Cairo was inaugurated on 6 January 2019 by President el-Sisi and Pope Tawadros II. On the same day of the inauguration, Divine Liturgy was celebrated in the chapel of the cathedral with the participation of some 3,000 people that included representatives from all over the country. =Ethiopian Church= Patriarch Abune Paulos died on 16 August 2012, followed four days later by Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi. On 28 February 2013, a college of electors assembled in Addis Ababa and elected Abune Mathias to be the 6th Patriarch of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. On 25 July 2018, delegates from the Patriarchate in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia and those in the United States, declared reunification in Washington, D.C., with the assistance of Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed.https://www.borkena.com/2018/07/26/ethiopian-church- officially-declared-reunification-in-the-presence-of-pm/ Declaring the end of a 26 year old schism, which began in 1991 when the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front seized power in Ethiopia and exiled the patriarch, the Church announced that it now acknowledges two patriarchs: Abune Merkorios, the 4th Patriarch of Ethiopia, and Abune Mathias, the 6th Patriarch of Ethiopia. Eritrean Church The first Patriarch of the newly independent Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church, Abune Phillipos, died in 2002 and was succeeded by Abune Yacob. The reign of Abune Yacob as Patriarch of Eritrea was very brief as he died not long after his enthronement, and he was succeeded by Abune Antonios as the 3rd Patriarch of Eritrea. Abune Antonios was elected on 5 March 2004, and enthroned as the third Patriarch of Eritrea on 24 April 2004. Coptic Pope Shenouda III of Alexandria presided at the ceremony in Asmara, together with the Holy Synod of the Eritrean Orthodox Church and a Coptic Orthodox Church delegation. In August 2005, Abune Antonios, the Patriarch of the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church, was confined to a strictly ceremonial role. In a letter dated 13 January 2006, Patriarch Abune Antonios was informed that following several sessions of the church's Holy Synod, he had been formally deposed. In a written response that was widely published, the Patriarch rejected the grounds of his dismissal, questioned the legitimacy of the synod, and excommunicated two signatories to the 13 January 2006 letter, including Yoftahe Dimetros, whom the Patriarch identified as being responsible for the church's recent upheavals. Patriarch Antonios also appealed his case to the Council of the Monasteries of the Eritrean Orthodox Church and to the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria. Abune Antonios was deposed by the Eritrean Holy Synod supposedly under pressure from the Eritrean government and he remains under house arrest. Abuna Antonios was replaced by Abune Dioskoros as the 4th Patriarch of Eritrea. Many believe that Abune Antonios was wrongly deposed and still consider him Patriarch. Many Eritrean Orthodox followers disagree with the Eritrean government making decisions in religious matters. The ruling Patriarch Abune Dioskoros died on 21 December 2015.Africa Yearbook No successor has been elected to date and the seat of the patriarchate remains sede vacante. Ecumenical dialogue =Catholic‚ÄìArmenian= Cathedral of the Holy Martyrs in Gyumri, Armenia, an Armenian Catholic cathedral dedicated in 2015 to the martyrs of the Armenian Genocide On 18 February 2001, Pope John Paul II during his Angelus address commemorated the 1,700th anniversary of the baptism of the Armenian people and referred to St. Gregory of Narek () as \\"the great doctor of the Armenian Church.\\" In September 2001, John Paul II traveled to Armenia and participated in an ecumenical liturgy at the newly consecrated Cathedral of St. Gregory the Illuminator in Yerevan.

On 26 June 2016, Catholicos Karekin II and Pope Francis signed a joint declaration on the family. It stated that the secularization of society and its \\"alienation from the spiritual and divine\\" are damaging to the family, and affirmed that the Catholic and Armenian Apostolic churches share a marriage‚Äìbased view of the family. The declaration also took note of various positive steps taken towards unity between the two leaders' churches, and \\"acknowledged the successful 'new phase' in relations\\" between them. It also lamented \\"immense tragedy\\" of the widespread persecution of Christians in the Middle East; the Pope and the Catholicos prayed \\"for a change of heart in all those who commit such crimes and those who are in a position to stop the violence\\". On 5 April 2018, a two- meter-high bronze statue of St. Gregory of Narek, erected by Davit Yerevantsi, was unveiled at the Vatican Gardens by Mikael Minasyan, Armenia's Ambassador to the Holy See.

Treweek later made headlines by calling for gender-inclusive language, saying that \\"God is not to be seen as male. God is God.\\" In late 2009, in response to requests from various groups of Anglicans around the world who were dissatisfied with liberalizing movements within the Anglican Communion, Pope Benedict XVI issued the apostolic constitution Anglicanorum Coetibus. This document invites groups of traditionalist Anglicans to form what are termed \\"Anglican ordinariates\\" or \\"personal ordinariates\\" under the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Catholic Church, while preserving elements of the liturgical, musical, theological and other aspects of their Anglican patrimony. Under these terms, regional groupings of Anglican Catholics may apply for reception by the Holy See under the jurisdiction of an \\"ordinary\\" (i.e. a bishop or priest) appointed by Rome to oversee the community. While being in a country or region which is part of the Latin Church of the Roman Catholic Church, these ordinaries will nonetheless retain aspects of the Anglican patrimony, such as married priests and traditional English choral music and liturgy. As of 2013, marrying a Roman Catholic no longer disqualifies a person from succeeding to the British Crown.Succession to the Crown Bill, Schedule paragraph 5 (as introduced) The explanation published when the bill had been introduced mentioned that those who had lost their places in the line of succession by marrying a Roman Catholic would regain their places, but that those \\"with a realistic prospect of succeeding to the Throne\\" would not be affected. The first person in the new line of succession to be affected by this change when it came into effect was George Windsor, Earl of St Andrews, who had married a Roman Catholic in 1988, and was restored to the line of succession in 34th place, after his father the Duke of Kent, although his Catholic children remain excluded.\\"What do the new royal succession changes mean?\\" at Royal Central website, 26 March 2015 (retrieved 30 March 2015). The provision of the Act of Settlement requiring the monarch to be a Protestant continues, as the monarch remains the Supreme Governor of the Church of England. On 13 October 2019, Pope Francis canonized Saint John Henry Newman, a London-born priest who led the Oxford Movement in the Church of England before converting to Catholicism and becoming an Oratorian Father and eventually the Cardinal-Deacon of San Giorgio in Velabro. Newman is the first Englishman who has lived since the 17th century to be officially recognised as a saint by the Catholic Church. In attendance at the canonization ceremony in St. Peter Square was Charles, Prince of Wales, the heir apparent to the Supreme Governorship of the Church of England. =Catholic‚ÄìOrthodox= Pope Francis and Patriarch Bartholomew in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. In June 2004, the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I's visit to Rome afforded a meeting with Pope John Paul II, for conversations with the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity and for taking part in the celebration for the feast day in St. Peter's Basilica. The Ravenna Document in 2007 re-stated the notion that the Bishop of Rome is indeed the first () among the patriarchs, although future discussions are to be held on the concrete ecclesiological exercise of papal primacy. Patriarch Bartholomew attended the Papal inauguration of Pope Francis on 19 March 2013, paving the way for better Catholic‚ÄìOrthodox relations.

Francis arrived at 2 pm local time, and the two leaders embraced and kissed. A 2-hour private meeting was followed by the signing of a joint declaration, which had been prepared in advance. The 30-point declaration contained a joint call by the two church primates for an end to the persecution of Christians in the Middle East and to wars in the region, expressing their hope that the meeting might contribute to the re-establishment of Christian unity between the two churches. A range of other issues are mentioned in the declaration, including atheism, secularism, consumerism, migrants and refugees, the importance of marriage and the family, and concerns relating to abortion and euthanasia. On 3 July 2019, it was revealed that during a Vatican meeting with Orthodox Archbishop Job of Telmessos, who represented the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew of Constantinople, during the feast of Sts. Peter and Paul on 29 June 2019, Pope Francis stated that unity rather than leveling differences should be the goal between the Catholic and Orthodox Churches.https://www.catholicsun.org/2019/07/03/ecumenical-goal-is-unity-not- leveling-differences-pope-says/ Pope Francis also gave Bartholomew nine bone fragments which were believed to have belonged to Saint Peter and which were displayed at a public Mass which was held in the Vatican in November 2013 to celebrate the Year of Faith.https://www.catholicnews.com/services/englishnews/2019/pope-gives- relics-of-st-peter-to-orthodox-patriarch.cfm Despite holding a \\"cordial\\" meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, with whom the Pope has had a history of good relations with, on 4 July 2019, tensions between the Vatican and Russian Orthodox churches still remained, with Pope Francis stating that it is unlikely that he will visit Russia unless Putin agrees to not include the Russian Orthodox Church in the visit.https://cruxnow.com/vatican/2019/07/04/pope-meets-putin-two-leaders- talk-about-ukraine-syria-venezuela/ Putin also stated to the Pope that he would not invite the Pope to Russia without this condition.

During the 5 July 2019 meeting, Pope Francis also accused the Russian Orthodox Church of attempting to manipulate \\"other religions\\" in Ukraine as well.https://tass.com/society/1067305 On 12 November 2019, Patriarch Bartholomew, the Abbot of Xenophontos and a hiermonk from Pantokratoros Monastery on Mount Athos participated in a Vespers service at the Abbey of Notre-Dame de Saint-R√©my, a Trappist Catholic monastery. Upon returning with the abbots to Mount Athos, Bartholomew gave a speech at Pantokratoros Monastery declaring that union with the Catholic Church is inevitable as no theological differences exist between the churches and only historical differences have kept the two churches from union. =Catholic‚ÄìLutheran= In 2016, on the 499th anniversary of the start of the Protestant Reformation, Pope Francis travelled to Sweden (where the Lutheran Church is the national Church) to commemorate the Reformation at Lund Cathedral, which serves as the seat for the Lutheran Bishop of Lund. An official press release from the Holy See stated: An ecumenical service was presided over by Munib Younan, the president of the Lutheran World Federation, Martin Junge, the General Secretary of the LWF, as well as Pope Francis. Representatives from the Anglican Communion, Baptist World Alliance, Eastern Orthodox Church, and Salvation Army also participated in the predominantly Lutheran and Roman Catholic event. Pope Francis, in a joint statement with Munib Younan, stated that \\"With gratitude we acknowledge that the Reformation helped give a greater centrality to sacred Scripture in the Church's life\\". =Catholic‚ÄìCoptic= On 28 April 2017, Pope Francis and Coptic Pope Tawadros ll agreed that they would not require re-baptism for Roman Catholics who seek to join the Coptic Orthodox Church, and vice versa. The Roman Catholic Church baptizes by sprinkling and the Coptic Orthodox Church baptizes by immersion, but this declaration opens the way for the two churches to recognize each other's baptism sacrament.

Much of the land to the west of the Waikato River and in the King Country to the south has been covered by limestone and sandstone, forming bluffs and a karst landscape. The volcanic cones of Karioi and Pirongia dominate the landscape near Raglan and Kawhia Harbours. To the east, the land has been covered with ignimbrite deposits from the Taupo Volcanic Zone. Large amounts of pumice from the Taupo Volcanic Zone have been deposited in the Waikato Basin and Hauraki Plains. Basement rocks As with most of New Zealand, the basement rocks of the Waikato Region and King Country are composed of greywacke (indurated sandstone, siltstone and mudstone). The Waipa Fault passes north‚Äìsouth through the Waikato-King Country region, from Taupiri, along the Waipa River, and south to near Ohura. It represents a major dividing line between different terranes. Murihiku Terrane greywacke lies beneath the Waikato-King Country region on the western side, and outcrops to the west of the Waipa Fault, from south of Waikato Heads to Awakino. The Murihiku Terrane is considered to be an accretionary wedge of mainly volcanogenic forearc sediments. It was formed in Late Triassic to Late Jurassic times (220-145 Ma). A line of Dun Mountain-Maitai Terrane rocks are assumed to pass north‚Äìsouth along the Waipa Fault, through the centre of the Waikato-King Country region, separating the Murihiku Terrane and Waipapa Composite Terrane, and produce a detectable Junction Magnetic Anomaly, but only outcrops at one place, at Wairere. Some Murihiku rocks occur to the east of the Junction Magnetic Anomaly, forming the Taupiri and Hakarimata Ranges, but it is assumed that these rocks have been shifted to their present position. The Waipapa Morrinsville Terrane greywacke lies beneath the Waikato- King Country region on the eastern side, south of the Hunua Ranges, and east of the Waipa Fault. It was formed in Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous times (160-120 Ma). Te Kuiti Group coal and limestone The Te Kuiti Group rocks overlie the basement rocks, and are present in Northland, Auckland, the Waikato, and King Country, although they have often been eroded or covered. Rocks containing coal were formed from swampland in Late Eocene times (37-34 Ma). The land sunk and the sea transgressed, and calcareous sandstone, mudstone, and limestone were deposited in Oligocene times (34-24 Ma). The coal deposits outcrop near Huntly and Maramarua, where they are mined. Limestone exists in the area south and west of the Waikato River, down to Piopio and Te Kuiti, producing impressive bluffs around Port Waikato, Raglan Harbour, Kawhia Harbour, Otorohanga, Waitomo, Te Kuiti, etc. The Karst landscape around Waitomo contains many cave systems, including the Waitomo Glowworm Cave. Miocene sediment In early Miocene times (24 Ma), plate convergence caused regional compression. The land eroded, and was deposited throughout the Miocene (24-5 Ma) in rapidly subsiding basins. These soft sandstones and mudstones remain to the southwest of Te Kuiti. Mohakatino Volcanic Arc The volcanic arc that developed to the west of Northland and Auckland extended further south towards Taranaki. These andesitic and basaltic volcanoes were mostly active in middle Miocene times (14-11 Ma), and contributed to the sandstone and mudstone deposits that formed around that time. Recent volcanic activity Mount Karioi and Mount Pirongia, near Raglan and Kawhia Harbours, are large stratovolcanoes composed of andesite and basalt, that erupted about 2.5 Ma ago. Other volcanoes in this group include Kakepuku, Te Kawa, and Tokanui. Maungatautari, west of Te Awamutu, is a volcano, composed of andesite and dacite, that erupted about 1.8 Ma. Ignimbrite and pumice deposits Over the last 2 million years, pyroclastic flows from the Taupo Volcanic Zone have deposited ignimbrites over the area East of Te Kuiti. Some of the largest deposits are from the Whakamaru eruption, north of Taupo, around 330,000 years ago. The ignimbrite deposits from the Oruanui eruption 26,500 years ago, and the Taupo eruption, 1800 years ago are also major deposits. They form impressive cliffs in many areas. The Hauraki Plains and Hauraki Gulf are believed to represent a rift valley. The rift valley is assumed to have developed about 2 Ma ago, due to the clockwise rotation of the Eastern North Island, that stretched the land between Auckland and East Cape. The Waikato River used to flow from Lake Karapiro, through the Hinuera Gap, and Hauraki Plains, to come out on the east coast in the Hauraki Gulf. The sediment from the 26.5 ka Oruanui eruption of Lake Taupo caused the river to change direction, and come out to the west. In fact, the Waikato River changes its route quite regularly, as eruptions occur in the Taupo Volcanic Zone, and the river channel becomes blocked. Many lakes and swamps in the Waikato Basin represent old routes. Pumice from the Taupo Volcanic Zone has been deposited throughout the Waipa and Waikato Basins, and the Hauraki Plains, forming excellent soils and swampland. = Tauranga Group = Tauranga Group describes sediments of the last 5 million years, mainly of volcanic pumice, initially Pliocene deposits (Walton Subgroup) from Coromandel and latterly Holocene from Taupo (Piako Subgroup). They underlie the Hamilton lowlands and extend into the Waipa basin, but elsewhere are mainly alluvial deposits in valleys. As well as pumice gravels and sands, they include silts, muds and peat. Coastal dunes Substantial sand dunes with high iron content have formed around the Kawhia and Aotea Harbours. David Kear's 'Geology of Ironsand Resources of New Zealand' (NZ Dept of Scientific & Industrial Research 1979) says, \\"The ironsand deposits extend from south Kaipara and Muriwai, north of Auckland, for over 300 miles southwards to the Whangaehu River, south of Wanganui\\". Soluble iron in concentrates exceeds 50% in most locations. It is currently mined at Taharoa and Waikato North Head. Geological sites worth visiting *Hinuera Gap, State Highway 29, between Lake Karapiro and Matamata is the course of the Waikato River, before it changed to go through Hamilton. The cliffs on either side show how big the river was. *Much of the Western hill country from Waikato Heads down to Te Kuiti contains interesting limestone countryside, with impressive bluffs. However, you need to take the small, unsealed roads to see much. The Lake Disappear polje is on one of these roads. *The Waitomo Area contains excellent examples of a Karst landscape, and several tourist caves, including the most famous Waitomo Glowworm Cave. *The Raglan, Aotea, and Kawhia Harbours are worth a visit, especially the dissected hill country around Raglan formed on greywacke basement rocks, the limestone countryside, the sand dunes and beach near Kawhia, and Albatross Point west of Kawhia Harbour. *Karioi and Pirongia volcanoes are well worth climbing, for those with sufficient fitness. A drive around Karioi has impressive scenery, especially the Te Toto Gorge. *Wairere has the one outcrop of serpentine in the North Island. *Mangpehi Mine, near Benneydale is an abandoned coal mine. *The coastal highway down to Taranaki has rugged sandstone cliffs, and black sand beaches. *The road from Te Kuiti through to Atiamuri has impressive Whakamaru Group welded ignimbrite cliffs.

He is credited with developing the idea of molding shapes and designs from the frame to the gas tank, and he designed the first pop-off gas tank, a significant improvement for motorcycle safety and repair. From 1977 to 1982, Chicano Roy was the first Hispanic motorcycle chopper builder to conquer the custom motorcycle magazine world, with his right-hand man, and youngest brother of 10, David Garcia. These magazines included Easyrider, Big Bike, Street Chopper, Custom Bike, Chopper, Iron Horse and others. Chicano Roy was the first to invent items, including, but not limited to, the \\"Molded Frame\\", which is a motorcycle frame that has the gas tank and frame molded together to look as one, to give body to the entire skeleton frame; however, the gas tank actually un-bolted just in case the gas tank was damaged in an accident. Chicano Roy molded all types of motorcycle frame from stock to after-market to complete personal fabricated frames. Chicano Roy and Lil brother David also included in their arsenal of customizing the \\"Frenched Spoon Seat\\", where the seat actually sat inside the frame, so you did not see a separation in between the frame and the seat. Laminations between the seat and the gas tank or recessed in the gas tank. Plus \\"The Frenched Axle\\", where the large ugly back-wheel axle nuts did not protrude outward anymore; rather, they recessed flush with the new body of the frame; extreme front and back leg peaking. In 1980, Custom Bike magazine featured a four-page article called \\"The Art of Molding\\" which indicates, \\"The bolt-on or pop-off gas tank a big feature of the molded frame  didn't come along until Chicano Roy\\". All of these styles are still being used by some of the world's greatest chopper builders of today. In 1968, Roy was with his eldest brother Eddie Garcia AKA Gypsy (engine builder and race car driver) who had the first Harley Davidson (1948 Panhead) in the Garcia Family. Gypsy tore down the Panhead, Roy molded his first frame, his brother Gypsy's Panhead frame. This was not the pop-off gas tank yet, the gas tank was welded onto the frame and then molded, this was the old approach. Gypsy ran all his wiring inside the stock Panhead frame which gives a cleaner look which was not being done at that time. In 1970 Chicano Roy molded his first Molded pop-off gas tank frame on his own Pan- Shovelhead (Gypsy built motor) Chopper at his home in San Fernando, California. Note: in this time frame Brother (artist) Johnny Garcia AKA Oso, would draw the two older brothers \\"Chopper\\" concepts w/extreme detail. Easyrider re-issued a chopper that had been molded by Chicano Roy and brother David Garcia as they worked out of a motorcycle shop called \\"Two Broke Tramps\\" in San Fernando, California. The chopper was epoxy painted by Raja, owner of Chopper Specialties in Orange County, California and assembled by Two Broke Tramps. The Chopper was featured in 1978 then re-issued in Easyrider's 1903-2003 Harley-Davidson's First One Hundred Years History Magazine to represent when Harley-Davidsons were first being [\\"chopped\\"]  customized beyond the \\"Bobber\\" look.

Life and work Fontenla was born in 1930, and while still a child, began attending the National Conservatory of Music and Scenic Art, in Buenos Aires. She was later accepted into the dance school of the Col√≥n Theatre, the nation's premier opera house. Fontenla was made part of the opera house's ballet company and was eventually named its prima ballerina.Ministry of Education: Norma Fontenla She joined the Rio de Janeiro Ballet in the early 1960s, and with them made her first European tours. Returning to Buenos Aires, she led the Col√≥n Theatre Ballet in works such as Fr√©d√©ric Chopin's Les Sylphides, Adolphe Adam's Giselle, L√©o Delibes' Coppelia, and as Odette in Peter Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake. Her 1967 performance in Giselle was notable also for her collaboration with Margot Fonteyn and Rudolph Nureyev. Fontenla performed in Paris in 1968 and in Santiago, Chile in 1969, where she opened the Municipal Theater's ballet season that year. She organized a tour of opera houses in the Argentine hinterland in 1970, and was invited to direct the ballet company in Milan's renowned La Scala.Buenos Aires: Anniversary of the Col√≥n ballet tragedy Her previous collaboration with Nureyev earned the Col√≥n Theatre his choosing that venue to perform Tchaikovsky's The Nutcracker for the 1971 season. The success of the program was followed by a series of performances by Nureyev for Argentine television, alongside Fontenla and her primo ballerino, Jos√© Neglia. Fontenla, Neglia and seven other members of the ballet company boarded a flight at Jorge Newbery Airfield on October 10, 1971, en route to Trelew, a city in Patagonia where they were scheduled to perform. Shortly after takeoff, however, the twin- engine plane stalled, nose-diving into the R√≠o de la Plata and killing all aboard. Their remains lay in state at the Col√≥n, and on the first anniversary of the tragedy, a monument in their honor was unveiled on Lavalle Plaza (within steps of the opera house).

She is the President and Chief Executive Officer of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights civil rights coalition. Previously, she was the Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General and head of the Civil Rights Division at the U.S. Department of Justice until January 20, 2017. She was appointed to lead the division and serve as the chief civil rights prosecutor for the United States by Barack Obama in October 2014. Formerly, she was a civil rights lawyer and the Deputy Legal Director of the American Civil Liberties Union, where she oversaw its national criminal justice reform efforts. Prior to that, she was Assistant Counsel at the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. Throughout her career, she has drawn support from a wide range of liberal and conservative activists, as well as law enforcement leaders, for building collaborative support and finding common ground on policing and criminal justice reform.  Early life  Gupta was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Indian immigrant parents. She received her B.A. degree magna cum laude from Yale University. She received her J.D. degree from New York University School of Law in 2001.  Career  Her first case, while working for the LDF directly after law school, involved 40 African Americans and six white or Latino people who were romantic partners of African Americans in Tulia, Texas, who had been convicted by all-white juries on drug dealing charges. In almost every case, the only evidence was the testimony of an undercover agent, Tom Coleman. Coleman did not use wiretaps or marked money and records showed that he had \\"filed shoddy reports.\\" He had previous misdemeanor charges for stealing gasoline from a county pump and abuse of official capacity. Gupta won the release of her clients in 2003, four years after they were jailed, then negotiated a $6 million settlement for those arrested. In August 2017, director Seth Gordon announced that he would be directing a film called Tulia about the case. In 2007, after becoming a staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union, Gupta filed a lawsuit that was subsequently settled with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency on detention conditions for asylum seekers. In August 2007, a landmark agreement was reached between ACLU and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, under which the conditions in the T. Don Hutto detention center improved and a number of children from the center were released. On August 6, 2009, the Department of Homeland Security announced intentions to improve the nation's immigration detention system, including ending family detention at the T. Don Hutto family detention center in Taylor, Texas. After her time as a staff attorney at the ACLU, she served as its Deputy Legal Director and Director of its Center for Justice. She has been credited with pioneering the ACLU's National Campaign to End Mass Incarceration. Department of Justice Gupta speaks at a naturalization ceremony in 2016 Under Gupta's leadership, the Civil Rights Division worked to advance criminal justice reform and constitutional policing, including by investigating and working to reform police departments in Ferguson, Missouri; Cleveland; Baltimore, and Chicago, among other cities. Gupta also oversaw a wide range of other enforcement efforts for the Division. This work included prosecuting hate crimes and human trafficking, promoting disability rights, protecting the rights of LGBT individuals and combating discrimination in education, employment, housing, lending and voting. = Justice Department cases = Gupta's tenure was marked by several high profile matters that included the investigations of the Ferguson, Baltimore, and Chicago police departments; the appeals of the Texas and North Carolina voter ID cases; the challenge to North Carolina‚Äôs HB2 law and other transgender rights litigation; enforcement of education, land use, hate crimes, and other statutes to combat Islamophobia and other forms of religious discrimination; the issuance of statements of interest on bail and indigent defense reform, and letters to state and local court judges and administrators on the unlawful imposition of fines and fees in criminal justice system; and the Administration‚Äôs report on solitary confinement. In 2016, under Gupta's leadership, the division sued North Carolina, alleging that the state's implementation of a law known as House Bill 2 discriminates against transgender individuals in violation of federal civil rights laws. In August 2016, Gupta announced the division's findings of its civil investigation into the Baltimore Police Department (BPD). The division found that BPD engages in a pattern or practice of conduct that violates the Constitution and federal statutory law, including unconstitutional stops, searches, and arrests; excessive force and enforcement strategies that produce an unjustified disparate impact on African-American residents.

History The War Office leased the and twenty seven perches from the Archdale family on 10 April 1875 for sixty pounds per annum. The lease ran for 999 years or until the War Office ceased to use for military purposes or sublet, assigned the premises for use other than military. The original lease is still held by the Ministry of Defence. The site was acquired as part of the Cardwell Reforms which encouraged the localisation of British military forces. The barracks became the depot for the 27th (Inniskilling) Regiment of Foot and the 108th (Madras Infantry) Regiment of Foot. Following the Childers Reforms, the 27th and 108th regiments amalgamated to form the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers with its depot in the barracks in 1881. In 1924 the barracks also became the depot of the Royal Irish Fusiliers. An Auxiliary Territorial Service camp was established on the site during the Second World War and Lisanelly Camp was built on an adjacent site around this time. In October 1954, an attempted IRA raid on the barracks to capture weapons failed, with five soldiers and two IRA men injured. Eight men were arrested, and convicted to 10‚Äì12 years imprisonment. The base was the subject of a botched proxy bomb attack on 24 October 1990, when the main charge of the bomb failed to explode.English, p. 126 The barracks closed in 2007 as part of the demilitarisation of Northern Ireland according to the Good Friday Agreement.

It is directed by Roger Nygard and written by Nygard and Scott Nimerfro (who is credited under the name, Lloyd Keith). The film was produced by W.K. Border, Thomas Calabrese, Takashige Ichise, Aki Komine, Michael Leahy, and Joel Soisson. It stars Michael Rooker, Ryo Ishibashi, and Danielle Harris. It is a sequel to the 1993 film, American Yakuza. Plot An explosive situation erupts when a mob war thrusts a yakuza, an ex-cop, and his adolescent daughter into a deadly, no-win situation. Booted in disgrace from the L.A. police force Bob Malone suffers a seemingly endless unlucky streak. Matters don't improve when a robbery led by a crazed criminal transpires at the bank where Malone is filling out foreclosure papers. Witnessing the crime, something inside Malone snaps and he single-handedly wipes out most of the robber gang. Unfortunately, the ringleader escapes and Malone ends up jailed by his corrupt former colleague Lt. Tony Dussecq. At the same time, two Japanese yakuza arrive in L.A. to deliver a special message to L.A.'s most prominent Mafia don. The yakuza are in a restaurant when the bank robber (wearing a vest covered with explosives) bursts in and threatens to blow the place up. One of the Japanese, Koji, intervenes in an explosive sequence. He too ends up at the police station just as Malone's feisty teen daughter Chelsea arrives with bail money. The yakuza suddenly escapes, taking Chelsea and Malone with him as hostages. Now pursued by the crooked coppers and the mob, the unlikely threesome have no choice but to team up to survive.

The CRTC implements the policies of the Broadcasting Act and the Telecommunications Act within Canada but, because its jurisdiction is limited to these, does not regulate the ownership of newspapers or of non-audiovisual Internet activity. However, it has taken press and non-audiovisual Internet activity taken into consideration in deciding on broadcasting matters. Thus far, the CRTC has undertaken very little regulation of Internet-based audiovisual programming. Media Concentration in Canada The Canadian media industry is not governed exclusively by free-market economics but rather through a combination of public and private enterprise. Apart from a limited number of community broadcasters, media in Canada are primarily owned by a small number of companies: Bell, Corus, Rogers, Quebecor and the government-owned Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. Each of these companies holds a diverse mix of over- the-air television, cable television, radio, newspaper, magazine, and/or internet operations. A few smaller media companies exist within the Canadian media landscape as well. In 2007, CTVglobemedia, Astral Media, Quebecor, Canwest Global, and Rogers all expanded significantly, through the acquisitions of CHUM Limited, Standard Broadcasting, Osprey Media, Alliance Atlantis, and City, respectively. In 2010, Canwest was sold off and split between Shaw (now Corus) and Postmedia Network due to financial troubles. Between 1990 and 2005 there were a number of media corporate mergers and takeovers in Canada. For example, in 1990, 17.3% of daily newspapers were independently owned. In 2017, 6% of daily newspapers are independently owned. These changes, among others, caused the Senate Standing Committee on Transport and Communications to launch a study of Canadian news media in March 2003. (This topic had been examined twice in the past, by the Davey Commission (1970) and the Kent Commission (1981), both of which produced recommendations that were never implemented in any meaningful way.) The Senate Committee‚Äôs final report, released in June 2006, expressed concern about the effects of the current levels of news media ownership in Canada. Specifically, the Committee discussed their concerns regarding the following trends: the potential of media ownership concentration to limit news diversity and reduce news quality; the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) and Competition Bureau‚Äôs ineffectiveness at stopping media ownership concentration; the lack of federal funding for the CBC and the broadcaster‚Äôs uncertain mandate and role; diminishing employment standards for journalists (including decreased job security, less journalistic freedom, and new contractual threats to intellectual property); a lack of Canadian training and research institutes; and difficulties with the federal government‚Äôs support for print media and the absence of funding for the internet-based news media. The Senate report expressed particular concern about the concentration of ownership in the province of New Brunswick, where the Irving business empire owns all the English-language daily newspapers and most of the weeklies. Senator Joan Fraser, author of the report, stated, \\"We didn't find anywhere else in the developed world a situation like the situation in New Brunswick.\\" The report provided 40 recommendations and 10 suggestions (for areas outside of federal government jurisdiction), including legislation amendments that would trigger automatic reviews of a proposed media merger if certain thresholds are reached, and CRTC regulation revisions to ensure that access to the broadcasting system is encouraged and that a diversity of news and information programming is available through these services. Role within small markets Due to Canada's smaller population, some types of media consolidation have always been allowed. In small markets where the population could not adequately support multiple television stations competing for advertising revenue, the CRTC began permitting twinstick operations, in which the same company operated both CBC and CTV affiliates in the same market, in 1967. This model of television ownership was restricted to smaller markets until the mid-1990s, when the CRTC began to allow companies to own multiple television stations in large markets such as Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver. National media conglomerates As of 2007, almost all Canadian television stations are owned by national media conglomerates. Most, in fact, are directly owned and operated by their associated networks, although even the few private affiliate stations are almost entirely owned by non-network conglomerates rather than local companies. These acquisitions have been controversial; stations in smaller markets have frequently had their local news programming cut back or even eliminated. For instance, CTV's stations in Northern Ontario and in Atlantic Canada are served by a single regional newscast for each region, with only brief local news inserts for headlines of purely local interest. This, in turn, has contributed to the rise of independent local web media such as SooToday.com, The Tyee, and rabble.ca. Based on revenue in 2015 Bell owns 21.4% of market share in Canada. The next leading would be Shaw with 13.4%, Rogers with 8.3%, and Quebecor with 7.5% . This has been controversial because large media corporations now make it harder for smaller media companies to compete in Canada . Controls over mergers Many, though not all, Canadian newspapers are also owned by the same media conglomerates which own the television networks. Companies which own both television and newspaper assets have strict controls on the extent to which they can merge the operations. The issue of newspaper ownership has been particularly controversial in Canada, especially in the mid-1990s when Conrad Black's Hollinger acquired the Southam chain. Black's 1999 sale of the Hollinger papers resulted in an increase in the diversity of newspaper ownership, with new ownership groups such as Osprey Media entering the business, but was even more controversial because the CRTC, waiving its former rules against broadcasting companies acquiring newspaper assets, permitted Canwest Global to purchase many of the Hollinger papers. The Toronto Star is a partial exception to this ‚Äî it is owned by Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd., a subsidiary of the Torstar ‚Äî but was itself a part owner of CTVglobemedia. Radio norms In radio, a company is normally restricted to owning no more than three stations in a single market, of which only two can be on the same broadcast band. For example, a company may own two FM stations and an AM station, or two AMs and one FM, but may not own three FMs. In a few major markets with a large number of radio stations, the ownership cap is increased to four stations, but the limit of two stations per band still applies. A company may also exceed this cap if it operates stations in both English and French; for instance, Bell Media owns four FM radio stations in the Montreal and Ottawa/Gatineau media markets, in each case consisting of two English- language and two French-language stations. As well, CRTC regulations do not prevent a company from exceeding the station cap through ownership of rimshot stations in neighbouring markets; Rogers Media, for example, owns two FM radio stations in Ottawa and two which effectively serve Ottawa from the smaller town of Smiths Falls. Under certain circumstances, local marketing agreements may be implemented, or the ownership rule may be waived entirely. For example, Bell Media owns most of the commercial broadcast outlets in Windsor, Ontario due to the city's unique circumstances. Due to its proximity of the Metro Detroit market in the United States, Windsor has historically been a difficult market for commercial broadcasters, so the CRTC waived its usual ownership restrictions to help protect the Windsor stations' financial viability. When licensing a new broadcast outlet, the CRTC has a general (but not strict) tendency to favour new and local broadcasters. However, in the modern media context, such broadcasters often struggle for financial viability, and are often subsequently acquired by larger companies. The CRTC rarely denies the acquisition applications. Canada also has strict laws around non-Canadian ownership of cultural industries where a media company in Canada may not be more than 20 per cent foreign-owned. Broadcasting Public Notice CRTC 2008-4 Before 2008, the CRTC had long had common ownership policies limiting the number of radio stations and over-the-air television stations a person could control in a single geographic market in the same language. But it did not have cross-media policies or regulations limiting the number of _types_ of media owned by one person. Under new rules announced in 2008, the CRTC limited companies to two types of media in a given market ‚Äî a company may, for example, own television and radio assets in one city, or radio and newspaper, or television and newspaper, but may not own all three simultaneously. In addition, with the ownership of cable specialty channels increasingly consolidating under the same few media conglomerates that own most of the country's conventional television stations, the CRTC also imposed a market share cap: no company can own broadcasting assets holding more than 45 per cent of the country's total television viewership.\\"CRTC puts new restrictions on media ownership\\", The Globe and Mail, January 15, 2008. The new regulations had no effect on past mergers but were designed to stop the Canadian media landscape from greater concentration and to prevent further takeover of smaller media companies. Two notable exceptions are The Globe and Mail and the National Post, which the CRTC deem as national newspapers rather than local publications. As such, they do not impact the rule changes. The rule changes by the CRTC essentially preserve the status quo but there is one area that could see a big impact in years to come‚Äîthe 45 per cent cap on audience share‚Äîbecause this would limit how many specialty channels a broadcaster can own. To determine audience share, the figure is calculated by adding up each broadcasting asset owned by a particular company based on BBM Nielsen ratings data then comparing it to the total audience based on the same ratings compiled across Canada. The rule change which restricts cable and satellite carriers from controlling the delivery of programming would effectively prevent Shaw Communications, which owns Shaw cable in the West and the StarChoice satellite service from buying the rival Bell ExpressVu Satellite service.

The United Order Family of Christ was founded specifically for young gay men only, ages 18 to 30. Because they practiced a uniquely Mormon form of communalism called the United Order in which they held \\"everything in common\\", Desmond affirmed that the Family was \\"not for the great majority of the Gay LDS\\". Desmond's title as the President of the Church was First Key. He may have solemnized same-sex marriages between people in his congregation. This Mormon schismatic church was the third gay Christian church founded in the United States, the first being a Catholic schism founded by Father George Hyde in 1946 in Atlanta, Georgia, and called the Eucharistic Catholic Church, which later moved to New York City. The second is the Metropolitan Community Church, founded by the Revd Troy D Perry in 1968 in Los Angeles. Desmond's Homosexual Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints lasted at least until 1973, when Desmond was still corresponding with David C. Martin (then editor of the Restoration Reporter), and probably until 1974.Quinn, Michael D.

Electronic digital hardware design has evolved from low level abstraction at gate level to register transfer level (RTL), the abstraction level above RTL is commonly called high-level, ESL, or behavioral/algorithmic level. In high-level synthesis, behavioral/algorithmic designs in ANSI C/C++/SystemC code is synthesized to RTL, which is then synthesized into gate level through logic synthesis. Functional verification is the task to make sure a design at RTL or gate level conforms to a specification. As logic synthesis matures, most functional verification is done at the higher abstraction, i.e. at RTL level, the correctness of logic synthesis tool in the translating process from RTL description to gate netlist is of less concern today. High-level synthesis is still an emerging technology, so High-level verification today has two important areas under development # to validate HLS is correct in the translation process, i.e. to validate the design before and after HLS are equivalent, typically through formal methods # to verify a design in ANSI C/C++/SystemC code is conforming to a specification, typically through logic simulation.

Development  Developed especially for the 1958 World Gliding Championships, the SZD-22 Mucha Standard was a direct descendant of the IS-2 Mucha (Fly), from 1948, and SZD-12 Mucha 100, from 1953, with very similar lines and dimensions. The Mucha Standard was designed to the new Standard class rules which discarded the old Olympic 15-15-15 Span, Aspect Ratio, Area rule. The first flight of the SZD-22 took place at Bielsko with Adam Zientek at the controls on 10 February 1958. It was followed by the second prototype in June 1958. Flight trials were successful, leading to a long production run with six variants, which introduced various modifications. Built primarily of wood, the SZD-22 had airbrakes in the wings, a streamline cockpit canopy, short nose and tail skids with a single mainwheel. The SZD-22C model replaced the plywood covering of the wings with fabric and some models had provision for water ballast in rubber bags fitted to the wing roots. Most of SZD-22s - 271, were built in ZSLS in Krosno. Many SZD-22's, mostly SZD-22C models, were exported to the Great Britain, Argentina, Austria, Australia, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Greece, Yugoslavia, Mexico, Norway, West Germany, Switzerland, Sweden, Tunisia, Turkey, USA, Hungary and Italy Adam Witek flew the SZD-22 Mucha Standard to first place in the Standard class at the 1958 World Gliding Championships at Leszno in Poland.

Kruger, photographed as Commandant- General of the alt=A man of about 40 with a large dark beard. The thumb on his left hand is absent. The Transvaal Civil War was a series of skirmishes during the early 1860s in the South African Republic, or Transvaal‚Äîin the area now comprising Gauteng, Limpopo, Mpumalanga, and North West provinces of South Africa. It began after the British government had recognized trekkers living in the Transvaal as independent in 1854.Some information The Boers divided into numerous political factions. It only ended in 1864 when an armistice treaty was signed under a Karee tree south of the site of the later town of Brits.  History  In late 1859 the President of Transvaal, Marthinus Wessel Pretorius, was invited to stand for President in the Orange Free State, where many burghers now favoured union, partly as a means to overcome the Basotho. The Transvaal constitution he had just enacted made it illegal to simultaneously hold office abroad, but nevertheless he readily did so and won. The Transvaal volksraad attempted to side-step the constitutional problems surrounding this by granting Pretorius half a year's leave, hoping a solution might come about during this time, and the President duly left for Bloemfontein, appointing Johannes Hermanus Grobler to be Acting President in his absence. Pretorius was sworn in as President of the Free State on 8 February 1860; he sent a deputation to Pretoria to negotiate union the next day. Commandant-General Paul Kruger and others in the Transvaal government disliked Pretorius's unconstitutional dual presidency, and worried that Britain might declare the Sand River and Orange River Conventions void if the republics joined. Pretorius was told by the Transvaal volksraad on 10 September 1860 to choose between his two posts‚Äîto the surprise of both supporters and detractors he resigned as President of the Transvaal and continued in the Free State. After Schoeman unsuccessfully attempted to forcibly supplant Grobler as Acting President, Kruger persuaded him to submit to a volksraad hearing, where Schoeman was censured and relieved of his post. Willem Cornelis Janse van Rensburg was appointed Acting President while a new election was organised for October 1862. Having returned home, Kruger was surprised to receive a message urgently requesting his presence in the capital, the volksraad having recommended him as a suitable candidate; he replied that he was pleased to be summoned but his membership in the Dopper Church meant he could not enter politics. Van Rensburg promptly had legislation passed to give equal political rights to members of all Reformed denominations. Schoeman mustered a commando at Potchefstroom, but was routed by Kruger on the night of 9 October 1862. After Schoeman returned with a larger force Kruger and Pretorius held negotiations where it was agreed to hold a special court on the disturbances in January 1863, and soon thereafter fresh elections for President and Commandant-General. Schoeman was found guilty of rebellion against the state and banished. In May the election results were announced‚ÄîVan Rensburg became President, with Kruger as Commandant-General. Both expressed disappointment at the low turnout and resolved to hold another set of elections. Van Rensburg's opponent this time was Pretorius, who had resigned his office in the Orange Free State and returned to the Transvaal. Turnout was higher and on 12 October the volksraad announced another Van Rensburg victory. Kruger was returned as Commandant- General with a large majority. The civil war ended with Kruger's victory over Jan Viljoen's commando, raised in support of Pretorius and Schoeman, at the Crocodile River on 5 January 1864. Elections were held yet again, and this time Pretorius defeated Van Rensburg. Kruger was re-elected as Commandant- General with over two-thirds of the vote. The civil war led to an economic collapse in the Transvaal, weakening the government's ability to back up its professed authority and sovereignty over the local chiefdoms, though Lydenburg and Utrecht did now accept the central administration. By 1865 tensions had risen with the Zulus to the east and war had broken out again between the Orange Free State and the Basotho. Pretorius and Kruger led a commando of about 1,000 men south to help the Free State. The Basotho were defeated and Moshoeshoe ceded some of his territory, but President Johannes Brand of the Free State decided not to give any of the conquered land to the Transvaal burghers. The Transvaal men were scandalised and returned home en masse, despite Kruger's attempts to maintain discipline. The following February, after a meeting of the Volksraad in Potchefstroom, Kruger capsized his cart during the journey home and broke his left leg. On one leg he righted the cart and continued the rest of the way. This injury incapacitated him for the next nine months, and his left leg was thereafter slightly shorter than his right. In 1867, Pretoria sent Kruger to restore law and order in Zoutpansberg. He had around 500 men but very low reserves of ammunition, and discipline in the ranks was poor. On reaching Schoemansdal, which was under threat by the chief Katlakter, Kruger and his officers resolved that holding the town was impossible and ordered a general evacuation, following which Katlakter razed the town. The loss of Schoemansdal, once a prosperous settlement by Boer standards, was considered a great humiliation by many burghers. The Transvaal government formally exonerated Kruger over the matter, ruling that he had been forced to evacuate Schoemansdal by factors beyond his control, but some still argued that he had given the town up too readily. Peace returned to Zoutpansberg in 1869, following the intervention of the republic's Swazi allies. Pretorius stepped down as President in November 1871. In the 1872 election Kruger's preferred candidate, William Robinson, was decisively defeated by the Reverend Thomas Fran√ßois Burgers, a church minister from the Cape who was noted for his eloquent preaching but controversial for some because of his liberal interpretation of the scriptures. He did not believe in the Devil, for example. Kruger publicly accepted Burgers's election, announcing at his inauguration that \\"as a good republican\\" he submitted to the vote of the majority, but he had grave personal reservations regarding the new President. He particularly disliked Burgers's new education law, which restricted children's religious instruction to outside school hours‚Äîin Kruger's view an affront to God. This, coupled with the sickness of Gezina and their children with malaria, caused Kruger to lose interest in his office. In May 1873 he requested an honourable discharge from his post, which Burgers promptly granted. The office of Commandant-General was abolished the following week. Kruger moved his main residence to Boekenhoutfontein, near Rustenburg, and for a time absented himself from public affairs.

He was interested in sports and listened to Indian classical music but did not intend to become a musician and trained as a geologist. During a visit to Kolkata he discovered the Hawaiian lap slide guitar and convinced his father to let him learn it by promising to only play classical music.

Kabra became the first Indian musician to play raga on the guitar, performed publicly, and recorded the successful album Call of the Valley (1967) with bansuri player Hariprasad Chaurasia and santoor player Shivkumar Sharma. The guitar was seldom used in Indian classical music, and his guitar playing gained popularity in the 1970s hippie culture.

The ancient Slavic-Scythian settlement of Krakowiec at the Szk≈Ço river (a tributary of San)S≈Çownik geograficzny Kr√≥lestwa Polskiego i innych kraj√≥w s≈Çowia≈Ñskich, Tom XI, page 921 seems to have become wooden fortifications after the Turko-Mongol raids of the 13th century and received town privileges in 1520. In 1590 Aleksander Ostrogski built the Krakowiec castle. The town became property of the Cetner, Potocki and Lubomirski families and remained a small strategic outpost protecting the core territories of Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and its capital Krak√≥w from invasions of the Khazar Khaganate, Varangians, Pechenegs, Golden Horde, Nogais, Ottoman Empire, Tatars, Cossacks, Grand Duchy of Moscow and their successors. Until the Partitions of Poland in 1772 Krakowiec was part of the Przemy≈õl Land of the Ruthenian Voivodeship (Rusyn Satrapy), part of Lesser Poland Province of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. During Partitions of Poland the town became part of Galicia in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In 1923 Krakowiec returned to Poland, but shortly thereafter in 1939, according to the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact, Krakowiec became victim of genocide, ethnocide and other crimes and atrocities detailed by Gestapo‚ÄìNKVD conferences, e.g. the Massacres of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia performed by Ukrainians of Turkic and Germanic roots and after the establishment of District of Galicia in 1941 The Holocaust (Shoah) of the Jews. After World War Two, Krakowiec became part of Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, part of the Soviet Union and was since known as Krakovets. In 1990 Krakovets became part of the independent Ukraine, since 2014 invaded by Russia. Changing nationalities The Holocaust map: German extermination camps, marked with white skulls in black squares, set up by the SS in occupied Poland, 1942. The German Be≈Ç≈ºec extermination camp was just 50 km north of Krakowiec. In the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth and also between 1772 and 1918, under Austrian rule, and continuing under Polish rule until the Second World War, the inhabitants of Krakowiec were a multi-national and multi-cultural mix of ethnic Poles, Polans, Lemkos, Boykos, Drevlyans, Volhynians, Sarmatians (Iazyges, Iaxamates, Siraces, Alans, Roxolani, Serboi...), White Croats, Ukrainians, Byelorussians, Lithuanians, Yotvingians, Arya, Silesians, Armenians, Lipka Tatars, Germans and Ashkenazi Jews. In the era of the decline of multi-national empires and the rise of nation states, the Poles were deported or killed, the Jews were slaughtered en masse, and as a result of genocide, Krakowiec became an exclusively Ukrainian town.Jews and their Neighbours in Krakowiec by Bernard Wasserstein In 1945 the remaining Polish and Sarmatian survivors were deported, mainly to Silesia (Bytom, Brzeg, Wroc≈Çaw, Legnica...). The destruction of the Jews of Krakowiec Before the Nazi invasion of Poland and establishment of the General Government, it is estimated that between one-third and one-half of the citizens of Krakowiec‚Äî1,000 or more people‚Äîwere Jewish. Krakowiec was also the birthplace of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army general Roman Shukhevych (1907-1950), who shot Jews on sight in at least two villages and is said to have been involved in the June‚ÄìJuly 1941 massacre of over 4,000 Jews in pogroms in Lviv and other cities in western Ukraine.Holocaust and Memory in Europe; Holocaust Amnesia: The Ukrainian Diaspora and the Genocide of the Jews by Grzegorz Rossolinski- Liebe Following that atrocity, most of the Jews of Krakowiec perished in the ghettos, labor camps, and death camps of the holocaust.Krakovets, Ukraine, at JewishGenJewish Gen edition of Swastika over Jaworow by Samuel Druck, pages 12, 15, etc. The nearby Be≈Ç≈ºec extermination camp, one of the biggest extermination camps in human history, was just around 50 km (30 miles) away.

He took an early interest in the ballet, and at age 12, began taking lessons at the National Conservatory of Music and Scenic Arts, and later from Michel Borowski, a well- known local figure in the ballet. Neglia was accepted into the dance school of the Col√≥n Theatre, the nation's premier opera house, was made part of the opera house's ballet company and was eventually named its primo ballerino.Ministry of Education: Jos√© Neglia Leading the ballet company, he became well known during the 1950s and '60s for his performances with his female counterpart in the company, Norma Fontenla. He received numerous distinctions at home and abroad, including the Vaslav Nijinsky Prize from the International Dance Association, and the gold medal at the 6th International Festival of Dance, both in Paris, in 1968. Among his many leading roles, some of the most notable were in Maurice Ravel's Bol√©ro, as Laertes in Hamlet, and in the title roles in Orpheus and Romeo and Juliet. Russian ballet virtuoso Rudolph Nureyev chose the Col√≥n Theatre for his 1971 season of Peter Tchaikovsky's The Nutcracker, for which he joined the ballet company led by Fontenla and Neglia.

Theatre of Cambodia known as Lakhon () is composed of many different genres. There are three main categories: classical, folk, and modern. Many forms of theatre in Cambodia incorporates dance movement into performances and are referred to as dance dramas. Classical Cambodian dancers *Lakhon Preah Reach Trop (, also known as the Royal Ballet of Cambodia) is the main form of classical dance drama performed in Cambodia. It is also referred to as Lakhon luong and Lakhon Kbach Boran Khmer in Cambodia. This dance drama is the most refined of all theatre in Cambodia and was particularly patronized by royalty. It is heavily stylized with gestures and postures meant to entrance the viewer. *Lakhon Khol (, Masked Drama Dance) is a masked dance drama featuring male performers. The repertoire consists solely of material from Reamker. The choreography is styled similarly to the Royal Ballet of Cambodia although not as refined and is performed along to narrators and a pinpeat ensemble. *Lakhon Pol Srey (, Female Narrative Theatre) is a dance drama akin to the lakhon khol; the performers being female however. Both forms combine classical theatre and dance and are accompanied by the traditional pin peat orchestra. Unlike Lakhon Khol, which use a separate group of narrators, lakhon pol srey dancers take turns narrating while other members continue to dance. The dancers often lift their masks and narrate directly to the audience. It is believed to have originated from the Kingdom of Oudong between 1618-1628 during the reign of King Chey Chettha II. In 1878, Ms. Chinh, a great art teacher from Koh Oknheatey, came to teach Lakhon Pol Srey in Wat Keansvay Krao. Today, one of her students, a 70-year-old woman, Ms. Chea Samut, has taken a lead role in reviving lakhaon poul srei and currently teaches this drama form to students at Wat Keansvay Krao, after having disappeared for more than 40 years.Poul Srei (Female Masked Theatre) *Lakhon Berk Bat is a lost theatre form in Cambodian Court. It is believed to have originated in the Post-Angkor period. Some older Royal Ballet dancers also recalled hearing that it was created in the late Angkor period, but little is known as to why it was discontinued. Evidence reveals that the drama was re-instituted during the reign of Oudong city by King Norodom in the late 1950s. The form disappeared again in the late 1970s during the time of the Khmer Rouge regime. It is assumed that lakhon berk bat was only performed in the presence of royal or noble families due to the dancers elaborate and expensive costumes and jewelry. As the art form emphasized beauty, character and technique, performers were expected to be not only beautiful, but to be able to act, sing, and speak well. The ability to sing unaccompanied was especially prized.berk Bat (Berk Bat Theatre) *Lakhon Nang Sbek (Khmer: ·ûõ·üí·ûÅ·üÑ·ûì·ûé·û∂·üÜ·ûÑ·ûü·üí·ûî·üÇ·ûÄ, Shadow Puppet Theatre) refers to Khmer shadow theatre Folk *Yike is dance drama with strong influences from Cham and Malay culture.

It was about two aliens who crash landed on earth by mistake and met a new friend called Emily. Format and premise  A ten- minute slapstick series for Children's television. The principal characters are Snug and Cozi, aliens from the planet Squadge. Travelling in deep space their pink rocket is hit by an asteroid and knocked off course. They crash land on the Earth, where they are discovered, and befriend a girl called Emily. She hides them in her the garden shed at the bottom of her garden. Snug and Cozi speak a language called Squidge, which is gibberish to humans, but the occasional English word is recognisable. Creation and pilot episode The idea was dreamt up by actor and film maker, Richard Vobes in 1994, with fellow actor Nigel Cooper, when they produced a low budget pilot version of the show on 16mm film. The original concept explored the idea of aliens living in a potting shed on an allotment. When commissioned in 1996 by STV, the series developed further to included a slight alteration from \\"cosy\\" to the spelling of Cozi in the title. The opening sequence was also altered, but incorporated some of the original animation footage of the rocket ship in the opening titles and explained how the aliens crashed on Earth. The characters never tried to integrate into the environment and continued to wear their conspicuous spacesuits. Vobes was never entirely happy with the TV series as he was not allowed to direct it, and a lot of the slapstick stunts in the scripts were faked or never done. He said in an interview the only stunt they were allowed to do was riding a bed down a hill and into a carwash (In the episode 'A New Home'). Characters * Snug, played by Richard Vobes, wears a yellow and silver spacesuit. Snug seems slightly more dim witted than Cozi, often getting things completely wrong and getting shouted at and pushed over by Cozi. * Cozi, played by Nigel Cooper, wears a red and silver spacesuit and he looks very similar to snug except he has a mustache. Cozi seems slightly brighter than Snug but still occasionally gets things wrong. * Emily, played by Sarah Montgomery, is a 10-year-old girl who discovers Snug and Cozi after they had crashed on earth, she decided to look after them and keeping them away from other people by hiding them in her father's garden shed (series 1) or their summerhouse (series 2). Emily also takes Snug and Cozi on trips with her, such as the seaside or her schools sports day. Popularity The show received a 32% audience share on CITV when Britain had only four terrestrial channels. Though not widely remembered, its available to watch on YouTube. Two series of 16 episodes aired before changes at ITV Network abruptly stopped the commission of a planned third series. Live shows and tours Snug and Cozi made appearances on many other CITV programmes, such as Wow in 1996, Scratchy & Co. in 1997 and Timmy Towers in 1998. In 1998, Snug and Cozi appeared in a pantomime of Cinderella at the Doncaster Civic Theatre. Their role were Brokers Men. No one in the audience could really understand Squidge so Snug and Cozi ate dictionary's and suddenly were able to speak English. Snug and Cozi also did a Pink Caravan tour, where they did shows around Britain in their pink caravan. However, there were not many gigs, and on one of the shows, the Rocket Car they used set on fire, and the fire brigade had to come and put the fire out. Merchandise The show has never been released on VHS or DVD. A Snug and Cozi CD called 'Pink Heads' was released in 1997.

They are often thought to be related to the ancestors of the similarly-named Clan Barrett of the mountainous Mayo-Galway areas, who are otherwise considered Gaelic in origin. Of the two, the Cork branch was considered numerically stronger, while the Mayo-Galway branch held more prominence in the Middle Ages. The Barrett family gained influence and power through the centuries for services to various kings and nobles, such as in the 14th century when they served as underlords to the de Cogan family, and later when one John Barrett fought in the First War of Scottish Independence for the Crown.  Name  There are numerous suggested origins for the surname Barrett. The chief source is the first name that has the form or (or ) in French, and means 'bear power'. It is closely associated in derivation with Bernard, meaning 'firm bear'. It has also been suggested that Barneveld, a name from the Middle Ages with the significance of 'bear-headed', is associated with Barrett. = Two clans theory = There are two Barrett clans in Ireland which arrived in Ireland at the same time; one group is the Munster Barrett family of Cork, and the other is the Barrett family of Connacht, most numerous in the Mayo-Galway mountainous areas. The founders of the two clans were believed to be unrelated, with the similarity of their names being thought purely coincidental before recent research proved otherwise. The English pipe rolls of the 13th century indicate that the overlords of both the Cork and the Mayo-Galway Barretts were the same people, and the records further indicate that both families migrated from Pendyne County, Wales. The view prevailed that the Barretts of Cork derived their name from the Norman- French (), while the Barretts of Connacht derived their name from the Gaelic name , or which means 'quarrelsome' or 'warlike'. O'Donovan wrote that both families were descended from Welsh lines, with Woulfe writing 60 years later that is instead a derivative of , and that is Anglo-Saxon.  History  Historical research suggests that the Barrett family can be traced back through France to medieval Italy, where they were known as Barretti in Alessandria and were makers of felt hats, though some authorities refute this claim. The Barrett clan definitively trace their ancestry to one John Baret (or Robert Baret), a Norman knight who went with William the Conqueror during the Norman conquest of England in 1066, and is listed in the Battle Abbey Roll and the 1086 Domesday book as having settled in Pendine. Beginning in 1169, some Barretts migrated from Pembrokeshire to Ireland during the Norman Invasion of Ireland as hired mercenaries for the Norman warlord Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke. In 1236 Barretts travelled to Connacht with John de Cogan's Munster contingent, which seemingly made them tenants of the de Cogans' lands at Carrigrohane. Both families living in Connacht and Munster were fully assimilated into Irish culture and married into many old Irish families; they are said to have become \\"more Irish than the Irish themselves\\". Barretts Country, in the approximate centre of Cork, would come to be named after them. Around the turn of the 14th century, John Barrett was pardoned Crown debts and rents by King Edward II in return for services during the First War of Scottish Independence. The debts otherwise would have been chargeable to Barrett's son William. Batin (or Wattin) Barrett, great-great grandfather of Robert Mac Wattin, also lived circa 1300. The Chief Barrett of Tirawley was for centuries known by the Gaelic name , or , which eventually evolved into , or . This is the source of the Padden surname found in Mayo today. To this day, the Barretts and Barrys of Connacht are known as \\"Welshmen of Tirawley\\". By 1468 the Barretts had purchased Sir Robert Coll's estate lands at Ballincollig, extending and improving the site of Ballincollig Castle. In 1485, among other Welsh and Irish mercenaries, troops from the Barretts of Cork were hired and knighted by King Henry VII to fight in the Battle of Bosworth Field. According to legend, the accompanying clans rode 'swift Irish ponies' and overtook the opposing army's heavily armoured knights. After the battle was won, the King led the remaining forces back to Pembroke. By 1600 the Barretts had lost Ballincollig Castle due to infighting, with Sir Walter Coppinger gaining full ownership of the lands in 1630. By October 1601, the Barrett family acquired Castlemore (or Castle More; later called Castle Barrett), which had previously been owned by the Earl of Desmond. According to one Dr. Smith, it is said that Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone when marching to Kinsale asked who lived in the castle, and upon being told that the owner was a Barret, described as a 'good Catholic' whose ancient English family had owned the estate in Barretts Country for just over 400 years, the Earl swore in Irish: \\"No matter, I hate the English churl, as if he came but yesterday.\\" The castle was damaged in 1645 by Oliver Cromwell's army. After the Battle of the Boyne in 1690, where Colonel John Barrett fighting on the side of the Jacobites lost to the Williamites, Castle Barrett was destroyed and 12,000 acres of Barrett land was forfeited. The first of the name in the United States was James Barrett, who landed in Charlestown, Massachusetts in about 1643. His home eventually was Malden, Massachusetts. His son, James, was in a troop of horse in King Philip's War. Another member of the family, James Barrett, was a colonel in the Lexington Alarm in 1775.  Coat of arms  The blazon of the Barrett coat of arms is: Barry of ten per pale argent and gules counterchanged; Crest: A demi-lion rampant sable, ducally crowned per pale argent and gules. In layman's terms, this means that the shield is divided vertically into two halves, both halves striped horizontally red and white, with the colour changing at the mid point; while the crest is a black half-lion crowned with a red-and-white ducal coronet. The clan motto is: \\"\\", whose meaning is commonly given as \\"Unbowed, Unbroken: Honour and Courage\\" but actually means \\"You may break [me] but will not bend [me]: Power and integrity\\".

Background history  In 837, soon after Presian's accession, the Slavs in the vicinity of Thessalonica rebelled against the Byzantine Empire. Emperor Theophilos sought Bulgarian support in putting down the rebellion, but simultaneously arranged for his fleet to sail through the Danube delta and undertake a clandestine evacuation of some of the Byzantine captives settled in trans-Danubian Bulgaria by the Bulgarian rulers Krum and Omurtag. In retaliation the kavhan Isbul campaigned along the Aegean coasts of Thrace and Macedonia and captured the city of Philippi, where he set up a surviving memorial inscription in a local church.

It first aired in the United States and Canada on April 8, 2001, on Fox. It was written by executive producers Chris Carter and Frank Spotnitz, and directed by Tony Wharmby. The episode explores the series' overarching mythology and earned a Nielsen rating of 7.6 and was viewed by 7.77 million households, receiving mixed to positive reviews from television critics. The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny), Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and John Doggett (Robert Patrick) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, Mulder secretly conducts his own investigation after a man is gunned down on the White House lawn attempting to inform the President of a planned alien invasion. However, he is soon in over his head as he tries to expose further evidence of colonization. The episode was written as a way to signal Mulder's exit from the FBI. The producers and writers felt that, if Mulder's character was given a clean exit, the show could more easily focus on the characters of John Doggett and Monica Reyes in the following season. Former series star and recurring actor David Duchovny later declared that he had been happy to see his character depart in this manner. Plot Under the cover of darkness, an unidentified man jumps over the fence to the White House and is intercepted by Secret Service personnel. As he struggles with them, he pulls a gun and accidentally shoots himself. Bleeding on the ground, the man hands over a computer disk, begging them to give it to the President. Three words are written on the disk: \\"FIGHT THE FUTURE\\". While still at the hospital, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) recalls how he was tortured on the alien ship. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) enters with Dr. Lim and they give him surprisingly good news: The neurological condition that was killing him, before his disappearance, is gone and he is in perfect health. Mulder returns to his apartment with Scully and he congratulates her on the pregnancy she had sought for a long time. Meanwhile, in prison, an inmate librarian gives former UFO cult leader Absalom a book about the apocalypse. Hidden inside is a newspaper article about the man who jumped the fence. Absalom later escapes during a work detail by attacking a guard with a board with a nail in it. At FBI Headquarters, Deputy Director Alvin Kersh informs John Doggett (Robert Patrick) and Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) that Mulder has applied for reinstatement to the X-Files. He intends to deny the request, claiming a higher percentage of success with Doggett. Kersh ignores Doggett and Skinner's defenses of Mulder, perceiving him to be a crusader unfit for proper Bureau work. Doggett later finds Absalom waiting for him at home with a gun, demanding that Doggett show the back of his neck to confirm his identity. He tells Doggett that the man killed at the White House, Howard Salt, died for what he knew about an alien invasion. Absalom duct tapes his gun to Doggett's back in a plan to get Salt's information, with Doggett used as a hostage. The two attempt to sneak into the census bureau's database, which Absalom claims contains data showing the aliens are already here. Unfortunately, the plan fails when an X-ray scanner detects the gun. Absalom is shot and killed by security. Mulder later accuses Doggett of deliberately attempting to cover up the truth by setting up Absalom to be killed, to which Doggett takes great offense. Doggett later meets with his liaison, Knowle Rohrer, who reveals the password to the census bureau is \\"Fight the Future.\\" Scully, on Doggett's request, tells Mulder that the disk was labeled ‚ÄúFight the Future.‚Äù Mulder realizes that this is the password and breaks into the census bureau with the help of The Lone Gunmen, searching computer data. Doggett soon arrives, realizing that the password leak was a trap. After a bitter argument (and upon both Scully and the Gunmen revealing to Mulder the arrival of black ops mercenaries on the scene), they are forced to leave. Doggett confronts Rohrer about the false tip, but Rohrer claims he was just trying to help Doggett learn the truth. As Doggett and Skinner leave, strange protrusions are seen at the back of Rohrer's neck.  Production  \\"Three Words\\" was written by executive producers Chris Carter and Frank Spotnitz, directed by Tony Wharmby and saw Nelson Mashita reprise his role of Doctor Lim, having appeared in the previous episode \\"Deadalive\\". Judson Scott also made his third appearance in the series as cult leader Absalom, reprising the role from both \\"Deadalive\\" and \\"This Is Not Happening\\". The baseball field scene was filmed at Cheviot Hills Park, in Los Angeles; the park had previously been used in the sixth season episode \\"The Unnatural\\" and would be later re-used in the ninth season episode \\"Lord of the Flies\\".Fraga, p. 82 In the episode, Mulder prepares to submit his application to be reassigned to X-Files division. Meanwhile, Mulder's boss, Deputy Director Kersh, informs Doggett that he intends to deny the request. As season eight was nearly over, the producers and writers decided to refuse Mulder re-admittance into the FBI as a way to segue John Doggett and Monica Reyes into the series as the new main stars of season nine. David Duchovny agreed with this method, noting, \\"I completely thought it was correct that they should be trying to focus elsewhere, and that, since I was going to come back for the second half of season eight, if you were to refocus on whatever Mulder's up to, you'd be in the same lousy situation at the beginning of season nine.\\"Hurwitz and Knowles, p. 193  Broadcast and reception  The episode first aired on Fox on , earning a Nielsen household rating of 7.6, meaning that it was seen by 7.6% of the nation's estimated households. \\"Three Words\\" was viewed by 7.77 million households and ranked as the 32nd most-watched episode for the week ending April 8. Fox promoted the episode with the tagline \\"Who will control the X-Files?\\" The episode was later included on The X-Files Mythology, Volume 4 ‚Äì Super Soldiers, a DVD collection that contains episodes involved with the alien super soldiers arc. \\"Three Words\\" received mixed to positive reviews from critics. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode five stars out of five, calling it \\"extremely well-performed by all concerned.\\" Shearman and Pearson felt that the episode was similar to the earlier \\"Per Manum\\" and was somewhat formulaic; however, they noted that this was a necessary and positive step towards redefining the series after the changes made in its last two seasons explaining \\"the point of all this is only to emphasise how different The X-Files universe now feels, the familiarity of the ingredients only making us more aware that the mix is never going to be the same again\\".Shearman and Pearson, pp. 243‚Äì244 Writing for Television Without Pity, Jessica Morgan rated the episode a \\"B\\", although she felt that by this stage the series' mythology was moving \\"in concentric circles of pain and confusion\\". Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a \\"B+\\" and wrote that the episode, \\"finds Duchovny back on his feet and ready for action, and he brings a new energy to the part.\\" He enjoyed the way the show presented the story as one wherein, \\"we spend as much time watching Mulder from the outside as we do seeing events from his perspective,\\" because it \\"makes things interesting.\\" Handlen also wrote that while the episode did not hit the emotional notes that its predecessor, \\"Deadalive\\", did, it was nonetheless \\"stronger plotwise\\" and built to an \\"inevitable conclusion in classic X-Files style\\". Not all reviews were positive; Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, gave the episode a mixed review, writing, \\"This was an episode that had tremendous promise and Carter and Spotnitz almost got it right. Sadly, they failed to invest themselves fully and intelligently into Mulder's return.\\"Kessenich, p. 169 Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a largely negative review and awarded it one-and-a-half stars out of four. Vitaris wrote that, despite opening \\"with tremendously affecting acting from [David] Duchovny\\", the episode lapses into \\"a lost opportunity to explore the psyche of a person who has suffered torture\\".

The airport was named after Bartolomeu Louren√ßo de Gusm√£o (1685‚Äì1724), a Portuguese priest born in Brazil who did research about transportation with balloons. History LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin over Rio de Janeiro Between 1931 and 1937, Deutsche Luft Hansa had regular flights between Germany and Brazil, which were operated by Luftschiffbau Zeppelin using its rigid airships Graf Zeppelin and Hindenburg. Rio de Janeiro was the final stop, where passengers could connect with aircraft services to Southern Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, Chile and Bolivia operated by Syndicato Condor, the Brazilian subsidiary of Deutsche Luft Hansa. During its five years of regular scheduled summer season intercontinental commercial airship service between Germany and South America, the hangar was used only nine times: four by the LZ-127 Graf Zeppelin and five by the LZ-129 Hindenburg.Brooks 1992, p. 167. Assembled from parts brought from Germany, the construction was subsidized by the Brazilian government.Dick and Robinson 1985, p. 41. Zeppelin Hangar. The airport was inaugurated on December 26, 1936 by President Get√∫lio Vargas, in the presence of the German Ambassador Schmidt Elskop. Before this, rigid airships were docked at Campo dos Afonsos. Tank for manufacture and storage of hydrogen to supply Zeppelins. The new airport consisted of an airfield, a hangar, a customs house, an office building, a radio-operations building, 5 bedrooms for workers, crew-lodgings, a work and storage house, a hydrogen factory, a plant to mix hydrogen with butane, and a branch line connecting the complex to the main railway line to downtown Rio de Janeiro 54 km away. The whole complex was built by the Luftschiffbau Zeppelin and are partially still in use by the Brazilian Air Force, which occupies the site. The hangar is an original surviving example of a structure built to accommodate rigid airships and the only Zeppelin airship hangar which remains a hangar. Because of its historical importance, it was listed as a National Heritage Site on March 14, 1999. As a consequence of the Hindenburg disaster on May 6, 1937 at Lakehurst Air Naval Station in New Jersey, US, the Luftschiffbau Zeppelin requested to the Brazilian Government on June 17, 1937 the suspension of services. After that no more civil operations were handled at this facility. On February 12, 1942, six months before Brazil declared war against the Axis, the airport was taken over by the Brazilian Air Force Ministry and became a base of the Brazilian Air Force and therefore with exclusive military use. It is located in the neighborhood of Santa Cruz in the western region of Rio de Janeiro. The name of the facility was changed to Santa Cruz Air Force Base on January 16, 1943. Access The airport is located from Rio de Janeiro downtown.

Out of those, four‚Äîinflux (ƒÅsrava), bondage (bandha), stoppage (sa·πÉvara) and release (nirjarƒÅ)‚Äîpertain to the karmic process. Karma gets bound to the soul on account of two processes: *ƒÅsrava ‚Äì Influx of karmas, and *bandha ‚Äì bondage or sticking of karmas to consciousness Influx of Karma The ƒÅsrava, that is, the influx of karma occurs when the karmic particles are attracted to the soul on account of vibrations created by activities of mind, speech and body. p.112 TattvƒÅrthas≈´tra, 6:1‚Äì2 states: \\"The activities of body, speech and mind is called yoga. This three-fold action results in ƒÅsrava or influx of karma.\\" p.151 The karmic inflow on account of yoga driven by passions and emotions cause a long term inflow of karma prolonging the cycle of reincarnations. On the other hand, the karmic inflows on account of actions that are not driven by passions and emotions have only a transient, short-lived karmic effect.Tatia, Nathmal (1994) p.152 =Causes of influx= The karmas are attracted to the consciousness by combination of the following factors pertaining to action‚Äîinstrumentality, process, modality and motivationTatia, Nathmal (1994) p.191 Thus, the karmas are attracted and bound on account of combination any element of the following four factors: *the instrumentality of the actions, that is, either through: body ‚Äì physical action, speech ‚Äì verbal action, or mind ‚Äì mental action *the process of action which consists of: decision or plan to act, making preparations for the act, like, collecting necessary materials, or actually beginning of the action *the modality of action, that consists of: the act carried out by self, or instigating someone else to carry out the act, or giving approval or endorsing the act. *the motivation for action. This includes any of the following negative emotions that motivates the action: Anger Greed Pride Manipulation or deceit With a combination of any of the elements of the above four factors, there are 108 ways with which the karmas can be attracted to the soul. pp. 239‚Äì40 Even a silent assent or endorsements of acts of violence done by someone else far away, have karmic consequences for the soul. p.33 Hence, the scriptures advice carefulness in actions, awareness of the world, and purity in thoughts as a means to avoid the karmas. p.61Varni, Jinendra (1993) p.195 Bondage of karmas The karmas have effect only when they are bound to the consciousness. This binding of the karma to the consciousness is called bandha.Tatia, Nathmal (1994) p.6 However, the yoga or the activities alone do not produce bondage. Out of the many causes of bondage, passion is considered as the main cause of bondage. The karmas are literally bound on account of the stickiness of the soul due to existence of various passions or mental dispositions. The passions like anger, pride, deceit and greed are called sticky (kasayas) because they act like glue in making karmic particles stick to the soul resulting in bandha. Hence the ancient Jain texts talk of subduing these negative emotions: p. 36 > When he wishes that which is good for him, he should get rid of the four > fault‚Äîanger, pride, deceit and greed‚Äîwhich increase the evil. Anger and > pride when not suppressed, and deceit and greed when arising: all these four > black passions water the roots of re-birth. ‚ÄîDa≈õavaikƒÅlika s≈´tra, 8:36‚Äì39 =Causes of bondage= According to TattvƒÅrthas≈´tra, the causes of karmic bondage‚Äîin the order they are required to be eliminated by a soul for spiritual progress‚Äîare: * MithyƒÅtva (Irrationality and a deluded world view) ‚Äì The deluded world view is the misunderstanding as to how this world really functions on account of one-sided perspectives, perverse viewpoints, irrational scepticism, pointless generalisations and ignorance. * Avirati (non-restraint or a vowless life) ‚Äì The second cause of bondage, avirati is the inability to refrain voluntarily from the evil actions, that harms oneself and others.Jaini, Padmanabh (1998) p.158 The state of avirati can only be overcome by observing the minor vows of a layman. * PramƒÅda (carelessness and laxity of conduct) ‚Äì This third cause of bondage consists of absentmindedness, lack of enthusiasm towards acquiring merit and spiritual growth, and improper actions of mind, body and speech without any regard to oneself or others.Tatia, Nathmal (1994) p.190 * ' (passions or negative emotions) ‚Äì The four passions‚Äîanger, pride, deceit and greed‚Äîare the primary reason for the attachment of the karmas to the soul. They keep the soul immersed in the darkness of delusion leading to deluded conduct and unending cycles of reincarnations.Tatia, Nathmal (1994) p.194 * Yoga (activities of mind, speech and body) ‚Äì The threefold activities of mind, body and speech attract and bind the karmas when such actions are influenced by passions. Each cause presupposes the existence of the next cause, but the next cause does not necessarily pre-suppose the existence of the previous cause. A soul is able to advances on the spiritual ladder called ', only when it is able to eliminate the above causes of bondage one by one. Duration and intensity of the karmic bond are determined by \\"\\" and type and quantity of the karmas bound depends on yoga.Sanghvi, Sukhlal (1974) p.302 Causes of different types of karmas Chapter VI of TattvƒÅrthas≈´tra provides a detailed description of various causes for various types of karmas. According to Jain texts, there are eight main types of karma‚Äîj√±ƒÅnavƒÅra·πáa (Knowledge obscuring karma), dar≈õanƒÅvara·πáa (perception obscuring karma) mohanƒ´ya (deluding karma), antarƒÅya (obstacles creating karma), vedanƒ´ya (feeling producing karma), nƒÅma (body determining karma), ƒÅyu (life span determining karma) and \\"gotra\\" (status determining karma). =Causes of knowledge obscuring and perception obscuring karmas= J√±ƒÅnavƒÅra·πáa and dar≈õanƒÅvara·πáa karma are knowledge obscuring and perception obscuring. They are caused by:Sanghvi, Sukhlal (1974) pp.244‚Äì45 #harbouring a feeling of jealousy towards knowledge or perception, towards a possessor of it and towards a means of it. # Wilful concealment of knowledge or perception #Ungenerosity as to knowledge #Obstruction of knowledge or perception to others #Denial of receipt of knowledge # False accusation or misrepresentation =Causes of feeling producing karma= Vediniya karma: Pain and Pleasure is induced on account of licking honey from the sword Vedanƒ´ya, feeling producing karmas can be of two types: sƒÅtƒÅvedanƒ´ya i.e. pleasant and asƒÅtƒÅvedanƒ´ya i.e. unpleasant feeling producing karmas. Causes of asƒÅtƒÅvedanƒ´ya karma AsƒÅtƒÅvedanƒ´ya karma is bound on account of causing to other or oneself the following:Sanghvi, Sukhlal (1974) p.246 #External or an internal pain #To feel troubled and worried on having been deprived of the company of a well-wisher #Experience of acute distress or heart burning on account of insult or insulting others #To enjoy or wallow in misery, to weep and wail #Injuring self or others #Lamenting on recalling the merits of a departed one Causes of sƒÅtƒÅvedanƒ´ya karma SƒÅtƒÅvedanƒ´ya karma is bound on account of causing to other or oneself the following:Sanghvi, Sukhlal (1974) p.247 #Harbouring a feeling of compassion towards all the living #Leading a religious life i.e. practice of minor vows or anuvrata by householder and mahavrata by monks and ascetics #Donation and charity with humility #Self restraint or proper attentiveness towards disciplined life even if it is tinged with some attachment #Forbearance and forgiveness #Inculcating purity by suppressing the tendency towards greed and the like defilements =Causes of deluding karmas= Mohanƒ´ya karmas produce a delusion in a soul i.e. the soul is not able to distinguish between right and wrong. They are of two subtypes‚ÄîDar≈õana- mohanƒ´ya (Perception delusion) and cƒÅritra-mohanƒ´ya (conduct deluding) karmas.Sanghvi, Sukhlal (1974) pp.248‚Äì49 Causes of Dar≈õana-mohanƒ´ya #Speaking ill of the omniscient and holders of true knowledge #Speaking ill of the scripture i.e. a jealous intellect leveling false charges against the scripture (e.g. Saying that this scripture is useless because it is composed in Prakrit which is a language of the illiterate alternatively, because it is composed in a complication ridden language of the pedant or that it contains a futile and bothersome description of the various vows, regulations, expiations etc.) #Speaking ill of the religious order or levelling false charges against the religious order composed of four divisions viz. monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen (e.g. saying that these monks unnecessarily take the trouble of observing vows, regulations etc., since monkhood is in fact an impossibility nor is it conducive to a wholesome result, or saying about the laymen that they undertake no cultured performances like bath, donation etc., nor do they lead a life of purity.) #Speaking ill of the religion #Speaking ill of the deities or denigrating them Causes of CƒÅritra-mohanƒ´ya karmas #To produce a kasaya (passions) in oneself or in others and to undertake unworthwhile acts under the influence of a kasaya #To ridicule the true religion, to make fun of a poor or helpless person, to develop the habit of frivolous joking #Indulging in various recreations evincing disinclination towards the proper moral restrains like vows and regulations #To cause worry to others, to disturb someone in one's rest and to keep the company of petty persons #To maintain a sorrowful demeanour and to arouse a feeling of sorrow in others #To feel afraid and to frighten others #To despise a beneficial act and a beneficial general conduct #A habit for cheating and finding fault with others #To nourish mental impressions of various sexual feelings =The causes of lifespan determining karmas= The ƒÅyu karmas are the life span determining karmas and they determine the next destiny or reincarnation of a soul. Accordingly, as per the next reincarnations lifespan determined, a soul takes birth in either hell, heaven, animal kingdom or as a human (this list is not exhaustive).Sanghvi, Sukhlal (1974) pp.250‚Äì52 Causes of the Narakayus karma or birth in hells Following reasons result in birth in naraka or hells: #Killing or causing pain with intense passion # Excessive attachment to things and worldly pleasure with constantly indulging in cruel and violent acts. #Vowless and unrestrained life Causes of the Tiryagayus karma or birth as animals Following actions conducted with deceit lead to births animals, plants or microbes: #Preaching religion to introduce sheer falsity #Propagate religion with a selfish motive #Vowless and unrestrained life Causes of Manusyayus karma or birth as human #To reduce the tendency to inflict injury and that to accumulate possession. #To exhibit softness and simplicity. #Vowless and unrestrained life #Helping the needy (poor, friends, old peoples, blind and handicaps etc.) #Doing charity #Forgiveness #To respect humans Causes of the Devayus karma or birth in Heavens #Having a disciplined and restrained life yet accompanied by some attachment #Partial practice of vows like non-violence, etc. #Refraining from evil acts but out of compulsion from external factors or for imitating others #Undergoing childish penances like fasting and austerities without understanding Practicing vows and austerities normally leads to destruction of karmas and of attainment of moksa or liberation, but in above cases leads to merit and birth in heavens as demi-gods for a long but finite period of time. =Causes of body determining karma= The nƒÅma karmas or body determining karmas are of two types‚Äîasubha and subha nama karmas i.e. auspicious and inauspicious karmas. Their causes are:Sanghvi, Sukhlal (1974) pp.252‚Äì53 # Crooked and misleading actions (pertaining to mind, speech and body) causes inflow of inauspicious nƒÅma karma # The opposite of the above‚Äîstraightforwardness and genuine behaviour‚Äîcauses inflow of auspicious nƒÅma karma. # Sixteen dispositions that cause rebirth as a Tƒ´rtha·πÖkara on account of Tƒ´rtha·πÖkara‚ÄìnƒÅma-karma: ## purity of worldview, ## humility, ## non-violation of vows and abstinences, ## persistent cultivation of knowledge, ## ever present fear of worldly existence, ## charity and renunciation as per one's capacity, ## penance as per one's capacity, ## ensuring harmony and peace in the religious order particularly the order of monks, ## offering services to the competent and deserving persons, ## devotion towards Siddhas and Tƒ´rtha·πÖkaras, ## devotion towards the preceptor, ## devotion towards learned monks, ## devotion towards scriptures, ## regard for compulsory duties, ## to cultivate and honour the path of mok·π£a, ## feeling of unattached affection towards the co-religionists. =Causes of Status determining= The gotra karma or status determining karma is of two types:Sanghvi, Sukhlal (1974) pp.254 #Nicagotra karma: Praising oneself, defaming others, hiding others‚Äô merits and finding fault in others are the causes of low status or low class. #Uccagotra karma: Praising others, displaying one‚Äôs own shortcomings, ignoring one‚Äôs own merit along with humility and modesty cause the inflow of high status determining karma. =Causes of Obstructing karma= The causes of inflow of obstructing or antarƒÅya karma are‚Äîcausing obstruction to others or intending to place or placing obstacles before others in their attempts towards beneficence, gain, satisfaction, comfort and power.Sanghvi, Sukhlal (1974) p. 255 See also *Types of Karma *Gunasthana References Category:Karma in Jainism ","title":"Causes of karma in Jainism"},{"id":"23897697","text":"Sand Hill, New York is a hamlet in the town of Newstead in Erie County, New York, United States.

Often the corridor widens in the end into an irregular blotch with much less frass. The mine may begin at an egg shell, but the larvae can leave their mine and start a new one elsewhere in the leaf. In the latter case the corridor begins with a small round opening. Before the leaf is shed the larva leaves the mine and bores into the bark, where it hibernates. After hibernation they live as shoot borer or free among spun leaves. Prays fraxinella has two colour forms, the typical white and black colouration and the melanic form f.rustica.

The carapace is low and flat and the eyes are in a compact group. The female resembles the male but has a larger abdomen. The male can grow to nearly long with the female going over that. Like all funnel- web spiders, this spider's web is funnel-shaped with trip-threads around the entrance, built among stones and roots. Its geographical range includes Gibraltar, Spain, Portugal and north-west Africa. The venom is not deadly to humans. It is the type species of its genus. References *Arnedo, M.A., Ferr√°ndez, M.

At their retreats, which are between 2 and 5 days long, teens and adults alike share their love for Jesus through the Eucharist, adoration, and praise and worship. It has been active since 1990 in the UK. The first weekly prayer group was held at the Carmelite Priory in Kensington. Youth 2000 - About  Beginnings  Youth2000 was started in response to Pope John Paul II's invitation to the youth to take an active part in the Decade of Evangelization leading up to the Great Jubilee Year 2000. In his address at World Youth Day in Santiago de Compostella in Spain in 1989, Pope John Paul II asked young people to evangelize each other by coming together, learning about and experiencing the love of God, saying \\"It is up to you young people that the task first falls of bearing witness to the faith and bringing into the Third Millennium the Gospel of Christ, who is the Way, the Truth and the Life\\" Ernest Williams, a twenty-six-year old IT specialist from England, was moved by the challenge and came up with the idea of Youth 2000, formally founding the organization in Medjugorje in 1990. Purpose Whilst specific details vary from country to country, the main focuses of Youth 2000 tend to be as follows : * Increasing the awareness and love of Jesus in the Eucharist, through Mass and Eucharistic Adoration. * Promoting devotion to Mary as a means of coming closer to Christ, through saying the Rosary. * Encouraging young people to read the Bible, get to know Jesus through Scripture and also to promote understanding of and fidelity to official Church teaching. * Bringing about Christian conversion. The Structure of a Youth 2000 Retreat Youth 2000's activities generally include the running of both prayer groups and weekend retreats for young people. The main event is the annual Youth 2000 Prayer Festival which takes place at the Walsingham Catholic Shrine in Norfolk over 5 days covering the August Bank Holiday weekend. Controversies In 2006, members of a small, militant group which had attached itself to a peaceful \\"Youth 2000\\" Retreat organised with Father Kevin Knox-Lecky, the Catholic Priest of St Mary's church, Glastonbury were cautioned by police for throwing salt and shouting at local pagans. The police warned two women and arrested (and later released) one youth. Father Kevin Knox-Lecky said that the poor behaviour witnessed by the Pagan Community had come from a small, militant \\"fringe group\\" that \\"attached\\" itself to the Youth 2000 retreat in Glastonbury. He said this militant fringe group were ‚ÄúunChristian and unrepresentative‚Äù of Youth 2000. Charlie Connor, the managing director of Youth 2000, said: \\"For the avoidance of doubt, Youth 2000 does not condone or encourage this kind of behaviour from anyone. We fully agree that differences on matters of faith cannot and should not be resolved by any kind of harassment.‚Äù But he added: ‚ÄúYouth 2000 would also like to place on the record that many young people at the retreat were harassed, sworn at and even cursed by people. One incident included the taking of photographs of young people, including children, and numbers plates by people present in the town.\\" References External links * Youth 2000 UK site * Youth 2000 Ireland site * Youth 2000 America site * Youth 2000 French site * Youth 2000 German Site Category:Catholic youth organizations ","title":"Youth 2000"},{"id":"23897861","text":"Kazimierz Pap√©e Dr. Kazimierz Pap√©e (sometimes Anglicized Casimir, January 10, 1889 - January 19, 1979) was the ambassador from Poland to the Holy See from 1939 to 1958, during and after World War II. Due to the Nazi invasion of Poland months after Pap√©e's appointment, Pap√©e represented the Polish government-in-exile for the remainder of Pope Pius XII's papacy, before being dismissed by his successor, Pope John XXIII. Early life Kazimierz Pap√©e was born January 10, 1889, in Lwow. His father Fryderyk was a renowned historian employed by the Ossolineum,Stanislaw Mikos: Dzialalnosc Komisariatu Generalnego Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej w Wolnym Miescie Gdansku 1920 - 1939. Warszawa: Panstwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe, 1971 his mother Wladyslawa was daughter of poet Wladyslaw Anczyc. In 1905, the family moved to Krakow, where Fryderyk Pap√©e got a job at the library of the Jagiellonian University. Kazimierz graduated from law department of the Jagiellonian University, later receiving his PhD. During World War I, he served in the Polish Legions (1915 - 1916), and after the war, when Poland regained independence, he became a diplomat, working in Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On April 1, 1920, Kazimierz Pap√©e took a job in Polish legation in The Hague, and two years later he was transferred to Berlin. In 1923, after returning to Poland, Pap√©e became a deputy to the Director of the Political Department. On January 14, 1924, he took the post of charg√© d'affaires of the Polish legation in Copenhagen, where he remained until December 1, 1924. The next four years Pap√©e spent in Poland, working for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On January 1, 1928, he became director of the consular office of the Polish legation in Ankara. In the first half of 1929, he worked in the Polish legation in Tallinn, and on July 16, 1929, he became general consul of Poland in K√∂nigsberg.

Pap√©e unsuccessfully pressured Pius XII to more strongly speak out against the situation in occupied Poland throughout the war.Phayer, 2000, p. 23.Chadwick, 1988, p. 82. For example, Pap√©e met with Pius XII on September 30, 1940along with Cardinal August Hlond, the primate of Poland, and Wladimir Ledochowski, the Superior General of the Jesuitsbut all three left disappointed when Pius XII declined to condemn the double invasion of Poland because he did not want the Vatican \\"to become a platform for Polish objections against Germany\\".Phayer, 2000, p. 24.New York Times. 1939, September 30. \\"Pope Will Address Poles Today; Hopes for an End of Nazi Occupation\\". p. 7. However, Pius XII's June 3, 1941, and May 21, 1943, meetings with Pap√©e were perceived as de facto recognition of the Polish government-in-exile.New York Times. 1941, June 4. \\"Polish Envoy Received by Pope\\". p. 2.New York Times. 1943, May 22. \\"Pope Receives Polish Envoy\\". p. 14.

Later, in May 1942, he complained to Cardinal Secretary of State Luigi Maglione that Pius XII had not condemned the recent wave of terror in Poland. When Maglione replied that it was impossible to document such atrocities, Pap√©e retorted \\"there was sufficient proof and, besides, when something becomes notorious, proof is not required\\". Pap√©e reported after the war: \\"I remember when I came to see the Holy Father for [...] perhaps the tenth time in 1944; he was angry. When he saw me as I entered the room and stood at the door awaiting permission to approach, he raised both his arms in a gesture of exasperation. 'I have listened again and again to your representations about Our unhappy children in Poland. Must I be given the same story yet again?'\\".Phayer, 2000, p. 61. Pap√©e pressured Pius XII to speak out not only against the persecution of Poles, but also against The Holocaust. Pap√©e was present in a 1944 audience with Polish officers where Pius XII urged Poland to avoid retribution against Germany or Russia.New York Times. 1944, July 29. \\"Pontiff Bids Poles Work With Russia\\". p. 4. By 1953, Pap√©e was entitled by virtue of seniority to the title of dean of the diplomatic corps, but had not acted as dean for years due to his continuing representation of the government-in-exile, not Communist Poland.New York Times. 1953, November 20. \\"38 Lands Protest Poles Church War\\". p. 8. Pope John XXIII revoked Pap√©e's accreditation as ambassador in December 1958, in a move that somewhat improved relations between the Vatican and the People's Republic of Poland.Paul Hofmanns. 1959, January 29. \\"Pope John Names 4 Polish Bishops\\". p. 9. Also de- recognized was Stanislovas Girdvainis, the ambassador of the Lithuanian government-in-exile.Luxmoore and Babiuch, 2000, p. 111. Memoir After the war, Pap√©e published Pius XII i Polska (Pius XII and Poland, 1954), documenting the policies of Pius XII vis-a-vis Poland from 1939 to 1949. He wrote that when he pleaded with Pius XII to denounce or condemn the mass killing centers of Auschwitz and Birkenau, he received only a generic reply: \\"The Vatican is always ready to alleviate all misery due to war\\" (p. 94).Phayer, 2000, p. 249. Pap√©e wrote memos to the Pope notifying him specifically about topics such as the liquidation of the Warsaw Ghetto, mass executions in specialized killing centers, and mass deportations of Jews.Phayer, 2000, p. 48. He died on January 19, 1979 in Rome.

Richards was born in Balsall Heath in Worcestershire (now part of Birmingham). A right-handed batsman, he played cricket for Warwickshire from 1883 until 1896. He made three centuries, against Yorkshire in 1889, against Hampshire in 1889, and against Cheshire in 1890, but all before Warwickshire achieved first-class status in 1894. He played seven games of first-class cricket after Warwickshire became a first- class county, six in 1895 and one in 1896. He achieved his highest first-class score of 61 not out against Lancashire in July 1895, his only first-class half century. He also took 4 catches in first-class matches. He was an umpire in the University Match in 1895, and in the County Championship match between Yorkshire and Middlesex at Bramall Lane in August 1897. He was a regular first-class umpire from 1898 to 1914. He umpired 10 Test matches between 1899 and 1912, all played in England, six involving Australia and four South Africa He made his debut as a Test umpire in the 5th Ashes Test in August 1899, played at the Oval, standing with Archibald White.

The televising of Test cricket was in its infancy and the notion of Test umpires using slow-motion replays or other modern techniques was considered absurd. Instead the umpires had to make judgements based on what they saw in a split-second, and honest mistakes were accepted as part and parcel of the game. However, touring teams sometimes felt that there was a natural bias towards the home team which led to some acrimony. Keith Miller thought \\"Mel McInnes, Colin Hoy and Ron Wright were our leading umpires in the 1954-55 M.C.C. tour of Australia, and I have no hesitation in saying that McInnes gave the finest exhibition of umpiring in a Test series that I have experienced\\".Keith Miller, Cricket Crossfire, Oldbourne Publishing, 1956 The England team thought well of him too, but in 1958-59 he lost the confidence of the England players and himself, appeared hesitant and gave some surprising decisions.p115, Swanton, 1977 In the Fourth Test he hesitated to give Ken Mackay out even after the batsman walked after snicking a catch off Brian Statham.p74, Freddi. Later Colin McDonald should have been run out when Fred Trueman flattened the stumps after his runner Jim Burke ran round the back of McInnes. McInnes gave him out, but then changed his mind and gave him not out as he had not seen whether Burke had made the run or not. On his next ball McDonald sportingly pulled his bat out of the way of the stumps to give Trueman \\"the easiest Test wicket I have ever taken\\". Trueman was affected again when he batted, given out caught by Wally Grout off Richie Benaud when he had dropped his bat and missed the ball.p221-222, Trueman The England team became dispirited by the umpiring mistakes and, believing the officials to be against them, lost heart.p96, Willis and Murphy As Fred Trueman wrote > ...the Australian umpires demonstrated as much impartiality as a religious > zealot. We just couldn't get favourable decisions and they no-balled England > bowlers left, right and centre...one of the umpires consistently no-balled > me...It was annoying, especially as this umpire seemed to allow Gordon Rorke > to bowl with both his feet over the front line!...I suffered, as did others, > from appalling umpiring decisions when batting...It was > unbelievable.\\"p219-222, Trueman Throwing > There was much comment in the Press box as to the legitimacy of this > delivery but Meckiff certainly generated a considerable amount of pace. It > is always difficult to assess exactly whether a bowler is throwing and it is > something of which one must be sure before being too dogmatic. Once a bowler > is condemned for throwing his career is finished and it is a great step to > take by any umpire, especially so in a Test match...he certainly looks very > much like a thrower. The umpires, however, are satisfied that he is all > right and they are the judges. :Alec Bedser p65, Bedser In cricket to throw the ball when bowling is illegal and results in a no-ball, but until 1960 it was undefined and it took a strong minded umpire confident of the backing of the authorities to call a bowler for this offence.p668-669, Swanton, 1986 To accuse a bowler of throwing was to call in question his sportsmanship, in effect to call him a cheat, and could result in libel charges by the offended bowler. A bowler who threw the ball increased his pace, from slow to medium or medium to fast, and the whip of the wrist altered the line of the ball, variations that could easily dismiss a batsman.p131, Brown. When applied to short-pitched deliveries the speed and inconsistent bounce of a \\"chucker\\" could be very dangerous, as demonstrated by the feared West Indian fast bowler Charlie Griffith. Another difficulty for the umpires was that although the upright straight arm was the ideal many bowlers had a slightly bent bowling arm without throwing the ball, and of course leg spinners used a strong wrist action, so it was not easy to sort out the innocent from the guilty. Sir Donald Bradman said \\"It is the most complex question I have known in cricket, because it is not a matter of fact, but a matter of opinion and interpretation. It is so involved that two men of equal good will and sincerity could take opposite views\\".p669, Swanton, 1986 Dragging > ...and as for photographic evidence! They produced this of Lindwall once, > which showed clearly that his back foot was either over the line or in the > air before the ball was delivered, but on the eve of the 1948 tour of > England and a pending dispute about Lindwall, in particular, somebody let > the story out that Tate and Larwood were also shown once in a film to be > over the line before the ball was delivered. As O'Reilly vehemently argues, > it is humanly impossible for a ball to be delivered legitimately with the > back foot still on the ground and behind the line, and so everybody forgot > about that one. :Jack Fingletonp158, Brown and Company, Collins, 1951'' > Trying to recall who was responsible for the front-foot law is a tax on the > memory. Some will say it was Gordon Rorke. Others would want the privilege > shared by Fred Trueman and Frank Tyson and a couple of South Australian pace > bowlers, Peter Trethewey and Alan Hitchcox. I am more inclined to lean > towards Con Simons and Pat Crawford. :Richie Benaud, 1980 p54-55, Ian > Chappell, Austin Robertson and Paul Rigby, Chappelli Has the Last Laugh, > Lansdowne Press, 1980'' In modern cricket the bowler is no-balled if he bowls without some part of the front foot (either grounded or raised) behind the popping crease and if his back foot is not wholly inside the return crease. In the 1950s the front foot rule had not been written, so the requirement was that one foot be behind the bowling crease. The 1958-59 series was a catalyst towards the change as fast bowlers tended to drag the toe of their rear foot over the bowling crease in order to decrease the distance between them and the batsmen when they released the ball. If they timed it well the delivery was made when the toe was still behind the crease, but sometimes they would drag it over the line and they would be no-balled. The dust raised by the dragging foot and the distance between the bowling hand and the dragging foot of some six or seven feet made it difficult for umpires to make the correct decision. As you can see on this old cine film of Ray Lindwall dragging his foot over the bowling crease. See Film on YouTube. It should have been called as a no-ball as his rear foot was past the crease when he delivered the ball, easy to see in a slow motion replay, but difficult for the umpire and impossible for the bowler. Australia *Jim Burke: Burke was an opening batsman whose occasional off spin bowling brought him 12 Test wickets (28.75) and whose action was likened to a policeman hitting a small offender with a truncheon.p68, Freddi. He was no-balled for throwing in grade cricket and Benaud was reluctant to use him in the Tests. E.W. Swanton wrote \\"I am sorry that the chief memory of him is that he was the worst chucker I ever saw bowl, bracketed equal with Meckiff and the South African, Griffen: that and the memory of his piano playing - off the field in fact no one was better company\\".p79, Swanton, 1977 Even his own Sydney crowd shouted \\"give him a coconut\\" when he hit the stumps with his bowling p147, Bedser *Ray Lindwall: Like Trueman Lindwall's action was a text book model, but he was known for his heavy drag, and Rorke was described as having \\"an even more phenomenal drag than Lindwall\\".p112, Swanton, 1977 Even so, \\"When Australia blooded some fast bowlers with distinctly dubious actions against England in 1958, it was a pleasure to avert the eyes from the bent elbows and feast on the purity and beauty of Lindwall's action\\".p80, Willis and Murphy *Ian Meckiff: Ian Meckiff's bowling action The biggest culprit in English eyes was the \\"jerky erratic Meckiff\\".p75, Arnold. who took 17 wickets (17.17) in the series, but dragged his foot and his \\"action was generally conceded to constitute a throw\\". Several former English and Australian Test players stated that his action was illegal; Jack Fingleton, Keith Miller, Alf Gover, Ernie McCormick, Ian Peebles and Johnny Wardle, as did many in the England team; Trevor Bailey, Jim Laker, Peter Richardson and Fred Trueman. Meckiff was defended by his captain Richie Benaud said he was \\"completely satisfied that his delivery was fair and legitimate\\".p74, Whimpress and Jack Pollard, who wrote \\"Meckiff, in fact, went to the crease with a beautifully relaxed approach, paused momentarily with his arm absolutely straight, and then let the ball go with a blurred swing of the arm that was impossible to follow from 60 yards away, even with the aid of good binoculars\\".p473‚Äì478, Coleman. The England manager Freddie Brown wanted to make an official complaint about Meckiff's bowling after the First Test, but captain Peter May declined as it would look like sour grapes. Instead they talked unofficially to the Australian chairman of selectors Sir Donald Bradman who retorted \\"And what of the action of the England bowlers Tony Lock and Peter Loader?\\" and that they should \\"first of all put their own house in order\\". May never did make an official complaint, but \\"Englishmen who fell to Meckiff's speed and lively lift were hardly happy at being victims of deliveries that began with a bent arm and finished with a pronounced wrist-whip\\".p297, Swanton, 1986 He was subsequently no-balled for throwing twice in the Sheffield Shield, but his career was ended when Australian umpire Colin Egar no-balled him four times in his first over against South Africa in the First Test at Brisbane in 1963-64. Some thought this was arranged for the benefit of sporting relations, but Meckiff never played cricket again. *Gordon Rorke: Gordon Rorke's bowling action A six-foot five-inch \\"Blond Giant\\", Rorke was the fastest Australian bowler and accused of throwing by the English press, but this paled beside his excessive dragging. With his gigantic seven foot stride and yard long drag he could be only eighteen yards from the batsman when he finally delivered the ball and at times seemed impossible to score from.p437, Frithp131, Brown Fred Trueman was no-balled for dragging his foot a couple of inches over the crease and wrote \\"It was really annoying as this umpire seemed to allow Gordon Rorke to bowl with both his feet over the front line!\\"p221, Trueman One picture showed him with his rear foot past the bowling crease before he had even begun to drag and Colin Cowdrey joked \\"I was frightened that he might tread on my toes\\".p59, Frank Tyson, The Cricketer Who Laughed, Stanley Paul, 1982 *Keith Slater: Slater was another bowler accused of throwing during the series, but as he only took 2 Test wickets for 110 runs he was not considered to be a major problem. At the MCC's first game in Perth Keith Miller wrote \\"this pencil-slim youngster bowled off-spinners in the first innings with a highly suspect and jerky action...but no one bothered much about him because of his comparatively modest success. The balloon really went up in the second innings when he used the new ball...I thought he looked less like a chucker when bowling quick but the M.C.C. were incensed\\".pp76-77, Miller England *Peter Loader: A whippet-thin Surrey fast-medium bowler accused of \\"chucking\\" because his bouncers were noticeably faster than his normal delivery. Frank Tyson wrote \\"His inexplicable wide range of pace has from time to time, raised the suspicion of a 'kink' in his action. He can certainly generate a great deal of speed for a man who is of slender build\\".Tyson, p166 *Tony Lock: The Surrey slow-medium left arm bowler Tony Lock was called for no-balling in a county match in 1952 and by a West Indian umpire after he bowled George Headley in the Kingston Test match of 1953-54.p668-669, Swanton, 1986. Lock's bent arm action, the result of practicing in a Croydon indoor school with its low ceiling, had caused grumblings for years, especially with his wicket-taking faster ball.p147, Freddi Unlike modern players with access to television highlights and close-up videos of their play, Lock never saw his own action until shown a film when touring New Zealand in 1958-59. The horrified bowler completely re-modelled his bowling action to eliminate the \\"kink\\" in his arm, and removed the faster ball from his repertoire.p204-205, Swanton, 1986p122, Brown. *Fred Trueman: Fred Trueman was an outspoken critic of Australian throwing actions; \\"I believed Meckiff's action to be totally illegal and he should never have been allowed to play\\".p218, Trueman. Amazingly, Meckiff returned the compliment by describing Trueman as \\"a Thrower\\" in a book he wrote several years later.p219, Trueman. Trueman, whose classic side on bowling action was considered a model, was an unlikely candidate for such an accusation.p288, Arnoldp40, Kelly and Lemmonp87-89, Willis and Murphy Like all fast bowlers Trueman dragged his foot over the crease and was no-balled for it, but found it annoying that Australian bowlers were not treated the same even though they had both feet over the return crease.p221, Trueman. Another problem was the long spikes he wore which made everybody talk about \\"Freddie's big boots ploughing up the wicket for the benefit of Lock\\".p76, Miller *Frank Tyson: Australian newspapers had accused Tyson of dragging in the 1954-55 tour and an English newspaper responded; \\"Will Tyson be \\"sacrificed\\" to avoid any risk of giving the Australians a chance to scream that Tyson persistently bowls no-balls by foot-drag over the crease?\\" with pictures of his bowling action.Tyson, p211 In the match between the Victoria and the M.C.C he was photographed dragging his foot 18 inches past the crease, but Pat Crawford of New South Wales was photographed with his foot 36 inches over the crease. The caption read \\"Oh Tyson. You are an Angel compared to Pat!\\".Tyson, p85 An enterprising Sydney newspaper paid Harold Larwood to give his name to an article declaring \\"Replay Tests - Tyson Not Fair\\". Despite his exceptional pace \\"Typhoon Tyson\\" does not appear to ever been accused of throwing the ball.

Smart was born in Forest Hill near Marlborough in Wiltshire, into a cricketing family. His father was a professional cricketer for Wiltshire; and his brother Cyril Smart played first-class cricket for Warwickshire and Glamorgan, who set a world record in 1935 by hitting 32 runs off one over. Two other brothers played as professionals at clubs in Wales. Smart worked as a miner before becoming a professional county cricketer. He played Minor Counties cricket for Wiltshire from 1910 to 1912, and made his first-class cricket debut for Warwickshire in 1919, playing alongside his brother Cyril from 1920 to 1922. He became a regular fixture in the Warwickshire side from 1920, playing 238 games in all. He began as an attacking batsman and occasional off break bowler, but became the team's wicket-keeper after the retirement of Tiger Smith in 1930, catching 317 victims while standing behind the stumps and stumping 105 (in addition to 77 catches as an outfielder). He made 79 dismissals in 1932, a then county record which was bettered by Geoff Humpage in 1985. He scored a total of 3,425 runs in 340 innings, at the relatively low batting average of 11.53, including 9 half-centuries (four in 1923), and a high score of 68 not out against Worcestershire in 1922. He took 22 wickets at a bowling average of 57.36, with best bowling of 3/31 against Northamptonshire in 1922. He played his last first-class cricket in 1936, and turned to umpiring the following year. He umpired 4 Test matches, all played in England, two involving India in 1946 and two South Africa in 1947. He made his debut as a Test umpire in the 1st Test against India at Lord's in June 1946, standing with Herbert Baldwin. His second Test as umpire was the 3rd Test that August, at the Oval, which was spoiled by rain. He also umpired the high-scoring but drawn 1st and 5th Tests against South Africa in 1947, at Trent Bridge and the Oval. He finally retired in 1948. He died in Bulkington, near Nuneaton, in Warwickshire.

He played college football for the University of Alabama, was recognized as an All-American, and was a member of two BCS National Championship teams. Considered the top running back prospect for the 2012 NFL Draft, Richardson was considered by some as the best running back prospect since Adrian Peterson, and was selected third overall by the Cleveland Browns. After being traded away from the Browns to the Indianapolis Colts during his second season, his production saw a massive decline. Having been out of the NFL after five seasons, he is sometimes considered one of the biggest draft busts in league history. He played for the Birmingham Iron of the Alliance of American Football in 2019, and led the league with 12 rushing touchdowns. Early years Richardson was born in Pensacola, Florida. He played football at Escambia High School Richardson finished his senior season with 2,100 yards on 228 carries scoring 25 touchdowns. In a game against Milton High School in September 2008, Richardson rushed for 419 yards on 29 carries and scored six touchdowns, a performance that earned him a selection as the first ESPN RISE National Football Player of the Week. As a junior, Richardson also reached the 400-yard plateau, as he ran for 407 yards in his opening game against Tate High School. He finished his junior season (8 games) with 1,390 yards and 13 touchdowns, and received FSWA All-State 5A second team honors. He sat out his second year due to an injury. He made the FSWA 5A All-State First Team as a senior, and was named 5A Florida Player of the Year and a finalist for the 2008 Mr. Football. Richardson also received consensus All-American honors and was named to the Orlando Sentinel's All Southern Team (Florida). Richardson also lettered in track & field at Escambia. In 2008, he captured a regional title in the 100-meter dash (10.81 s) and placed 5th at the state meet with a time of 10.9 seconds (World-class sprinter Jeff Demps won the event). He owned a personal-best time of 10.5 seconds in the 100 meters. In addition, he also participated in the long jump event and had a best-mark of 6.55 meters. Richardson was frequently compared to Emmitt Smith, who also starred at Escambia (1987 graduate), but his physique and running style are more similar to Earl Campbell. Richardson also drew comparisons to Michael Turner and O. J. Simpson. Considered a five-star recruit by Rivals.com, Richardson was listed as the No. 2 running back prospect in the nation (behind only Bryce Brown). He chose Alabama over Florida, Florida State, and LSU, among others. College career Kent State defensive line during his junior season at Alabama. Richardson accepted an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Alabama, where he played for coach Nick Saban's Alabama Crimson Tide football team from 2009 to 2011. =2009 season= In his first year at Alabama, Richardson stepped in quickly for the departed Glen Coffee, and shared time at the tailback position with Roy Upchurch and Mark Ingram, Jr. When recruited, Crimson Tide coach Nick Saban called Richardson, \\"the real key to the class,\\" and \\"an outstanding player at a position that a young player can contribute next year.\\" In the second game of the season against Florida International, Richardson had 118 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns in the 40‚Äì14 victory. Richardson was named SEC Freshman of the Week for Week 2 and Week 4. Richardson was also named to the 2009 SEC All-Freshman team alongside Barrett Jones and Nico Johnson. He also contributed significantly in the 2010 BCS National Championship against the Texas Longhorns with 109 yards rushing and 2 touchdowns. For the season, he had 145 carries for 751 yards rushing and 8 touchdowns. He also had 16 receptions for 126 yards receiving on the season. =2010 season= Richardson started the first two games of the season with Mark Ingram sitting out due to an injury.

The club was founded in 1881 and has seen members of its club represent the Scotland national rugby union team. Club history The Fettesian-Lorettonians Club was formed in 1881, when a scratch team of ex-Fettes College students underwent a tour of North Yorkshire under the name Fettes Rovers in 1880.Marshall (1892), pg 64. Failing to recruit a full team, the side approached the headmaster of rival college Loretto School, and requested if he would allow members of the Loretto XI could play for the team. Their request was granted, and the partnership between the two schools was so successful it was turned into a friendly sporting club. The original circular for the official formation of the club was signed by A. R. Paterson, a well known Lorretonian and Oxonian and Andrew Ramsay Don-Wauchope, representing Fettes and Cambridge. Although formed primarily as a rugby union club.Marshall (1892), pg 65. the club also branched into other sports and athletics. In March 1881, as part of the Home Nations encounters, Fettesian-Lorettonian were first represented at international level when Andrew Ramsay Don-Wauchope was chosen to play for Scotland against England. Don-Wauchope played 13 matches for Scotland, all whilst a playing club rugby for Fettesian-Lorettonian. Don-Wauchope was followed soon after by his younger brother Patrick, who won six caps for Scotland while representing the club. The most notable Scottish player was David Bedell-Sivright, who studied at Fettes, and made most of his international appearances with Cambridge University, but in 1901 made appearances against Ireland and Wales as a Fettesian-Lorettonian player. Beddell-Sivright was a major character of Scottish rugby and not only captained his country, but also led one of the earliest British Lions teams to Australia.

It is reached by visitors from the nearby Groudle Glen railway station on the Manx Electric Railway. Naming The main terminus of the Groudle Glen Railway is located in the heart of the glen and it's commonly thought it was named after a small glen spur from the main glen, but that is in fact called Glen Coan which translated from the local Manx Gaelic means \\"Narrow Valley\\" but at some point in history it adopted the name Lhen Coan for reasons unknown, which translated means \\"Narrow Lane!\\" Location The station sits on a shelf on the northern side of the valley and was originally served by a run-round loop, covered overall by a Swiss-style canopy, with single-road locomotive shed and siding. There was also a souvenir shop which took hexagonal form in a style similar to those seen on the nearby Manx Electric Railway. The locomotive shed was destroyed by a fallen tree in 1967 and the unsafe canopy was destroyed in 1979, leaving the site empty. Restoration When the restoration of the line by volunteers from the Isle of Man Steam Railway Supporters' Association began in 1982 the site was merely a footpath and took considerable effort to reach with the new railhead. By 1986 however a new metal-framed, three-road locomotive and carriage shed was opened, just forward of the site of the original, serving as the line's only covered area for stock. Canopy By 1993 a replica of the distinctive station canopy was completed, and in the intervening years a number of small temporary huts had been erected beginning with a booking office (later moved and used as a store), a souvenir shop (now located under the canopy and at one time used as a tea room until the installation of facilities at the outer terminus), larger replacement souvenir shop and store room which doubles as a grotto for the festive services. A further siding was added the locomotive yard in 2005 and a lean-to building created to store permanent way vehicles. Developments In 2007 the railway erected a two-road, purpose-built locomotive shed in a similar style to the original, which necessitated the removal of the station siding and widening of the area; this shed is now in use, and a further siding is being laid in front of what is now the carriage shed for further permanent way stock storage. The station site is now considerably larger than it was in the days of the original line but the volunteers have been careful to not lose the feeling of the original station. In the early part of 2009 a new souvenir shop was erected, similar in style to the replica canopy; the station was also refurbished in a lighter shade of brown and cream. In 2011 the 1992 booking office hut was deemed beyond repair and was replaced with a new booking office constructed in similar style to the new shop and canopy building and painted in the station colour scheme of brown and cream. In 2012 planning permission was granted to extend the platform area substantially out into the glen, and to construct a new larger utility building to replace the old tea hut of 1986. Construction work started in September, funded by the Manx Lottery Trust and Tower Insurance, and required the railway to transport 140 tons of rock to the site, for the platform extension foundations and infill. New stone faced walls to link the 2007 engine shed to the existing 1896 dry stone wall were also part of the project. The building was constructed by volunteer joiner Stephen Goody to match the style of the canopy, shop and booking office, and the entire area was completed in time for the Christmas services.

It is situated at the midpoint of the short line, above the nearby beach and car park. Naming The halt is named for a nearby lime kiln, along the course of the old packhorse road which now forms part of the Raad Ny Foillan, the island's coastal footpath. The station area is demarcated by a section of white picket fencing and has waiting shelters but no raised platform: the railway's coaches have a low enough floor level to enable access from ground level. The station became official when sign boards were erected denoting its status during 1986 when the restored railway was officially opened. Origins There was no station here in the early days of the railway: trains ran from one terminus to the other with no intermediate stopping places; it was born out of necessity, being the spot where tracklaying commenced in 1982 at the start of the restoration, and it became a station by default. For the first year or so trains only operated between this point and the headland, a few hundred yards east. When track laying extended into the glen section, reaching Lhen Coan in 1986, Lime Kiln Halt was retained owing to its ease of access from the nearby car park. Structures The first structure placed on the site was a portion of porch from an old cottage named \\"Myrtle Cottage\\", so that was the colloquial name given to the hut; this was replaced in 1992 by a plywood structure and gained the nickname \\"Myrtle II\\". This too was replaced in 2001 by a much wider and shallower structure which remains on site today. There is also a donated ex-Bus Vannin shelter at the eastern end of the platform and this was installed in 2007. All structures were repainted in a green and cream colour scheme by a team from Barclays Wealth in 2010 as part of a community project, and all picket fencing was replaced around the station by the Onchan Rotary Club as part of a project in 2011. North Pole Halt In conjunction with the railway's Santa Trains each December the station is renamed North Pole Halt and is transformed into a waiting area, serving as the line's temporary terminus for the running days (the headland section is not used as it is exposed to possible inclement weather). Festoon lighting is erected, and a large temporary canopy provided as shelter for passengers, and the area suitably fenced to provide a queuing area for waiting passengers. So, despite being one of the quietest stations on the island generally, for four days each December it is transformed into one of the island's busiest. Access The station can be accessed on foot, climbing the footpath from the nearby Groudle Beach ,or from above, using the old packhorse road which now provides limited vehicular access for the railway's staff, largely for delivery purposes. Other than this, the railway is the easiest way to reach the station, by informing the train guard of your intentions.

It also served as the terminus between 1950 and 1962. Origins The station was created as the terminus of the line from the end of the Second World War until closure in 1962. A landslide on the section following it ensured that the line was impassable upon reopening after the war and a run-round loop installed here to facilitate the locomotive Polar Bear running around its rake of coaches. At this time steps installed to serve the headland cafe which overlooked the picturesque beach below. The loop utilised a shortened section of what had originally been an extra long passing loop installed in the early years of the twentieth century, facilitating the passing of two trains without the need for either to draw to a halt. Upon closure the lines were lifted and the site became part of a footpath. Reopening Albeit slightly further along the line, from 1983 until the \\"extension\\" to Sea Lion Rocks opened in 1992, the area provided the outer terminus for the line, when resurrected by volunteers. The site was also the first workshop area until the line reached Lhen Coan in the spring of 1986 and the cleared site can be seen today from the passing train. At this time proposals were put forward for the erection of a stone-build hut based on the design of level crossing keepers' huts on the Isle of Man Railway but ultimately the work was concentrated on the lower portion of the line. At the end of the 1991 season the loop was removed and the extension laid. Resurrection Once the line was reinstated to its full length in 1992, the line only had one rake of coaches and locomotive so there was no need for a passing loop here. It wasn't until 1994 when a second locomotive \\"Jack\\" arrived, that a smaller (three coach length) passing loop was installed on the site of the original (later) terminus to enable the restored line to operate two or three train operations. A siding, for the loading and unloading of locomotives and stock, spurs off the loop line and has been dubbed the \\"ski jump\\" owing to its steep gradient. This \\"ski jump\\" siding was removed in 2011, when the loop was relaid and doubled in length towards Sea Lion Rocks. A new siding is due to be laid in future years further around the corner towards Sea Lion Rocks on the site of the early 1980s siding that was laid during reconstruction of the line. This area of the line is ear-marked for a special halt by arrangement in the future for people with disabilities, as access to the railway is improved.

It served as the outer terminus from 1896 until 1939 and again from 1992 to date. Location The terminus is situated some three-quarters of a mile away from the other end of the line. It opened as the outer terminus of the line in 1896, at which point the building was erected including tea rooms, bake house, fish store and seasonal living quarters for the staff. The zoo, created in the adjacent cove, had been a feature from 1893 and was the reason for the building of the line. The station closed at the outbreak of the Second World War; although the railway reopened in 1950, a landslip during the war years prevented the line being re-opened this far, and it was not until the restored line was extended in 1992 that the station re- opened, later receiving a replica station building in 2000. Structures Over the years, there were several additions to the buildings and structures, and very few photographs of any quality are in existence; those that do exist show a main building with several smaller and somewhat ramshackle huts surrounding it. It is unclear when the station building was demolished, but it is understood to have still been there in the early 1960s. By the time the line was resurrected in 1982 it had vanished completely. In the winter of 1991 major earthworks were carried out so that the line could once more terminate at Sea Lion Rocks. Reopening Sea Lion Cove September 2017 From Coastal Road On 23 July 1992 the line was fully reopened as the line's terminus by James Crookall Cain (Speaker of the House of Keys, the lower branch of the island's parliament) who hammered into place the final burnished pandrol rail fastener. It was another eight years before any form of building was erected, leading to the volunteers nicknaming the area \\"Soil & Rocks\\" as opposed to \\"Sea Lion Rocks\\". The building that now stands on the site of the original was built directly on top of foundations discovered at the time and is largely faithful to the original, based on postcard views of the time. Construction began in the year 2000 and has since continued over the summer months, owing to the inclement nature of the weather on the site. The station area has, in the time since the building was erected, been fenced and landscaped in a sympathetic way to blend with the environs and this is an ongoing task by the volunteers who operate the railway. Since 2002 a tea room and souvenir outlet has operated at the station, which also houses historical displays and an indoor seating area. The site continues to be slowly developed by the volunteers. Period details such as coin-operated telescopes have been installed in recent times, and the large flagpole which dominates many old photographs of the site in its heyday was reinstalled in 2010, making the site more visible from the nearby coastal road which runs on the opposite headland. Ornamental railings surrounding the lawn in front of the station have also been erected. Further development In 2011/12 there was a large development project, following five years of fundraising and applying for various permissions. An extension was built on the rear of the building to provide the railway's first proper toilet facilities, disabled facilities and a store room fitted with a silent generator to provide power for the building. New paving was added to the patio area, ramped pathways to a new paved station platform area. The remaining area was landscaped with turf and appropriate shrubs were planted, and the time-expired station nameboards were replaced, along with new signage, fencing and station benches and CCTV. Inside the building was developed further as a free visitor centre with displays and artefacts depicting the history of the line and its restoration. It partially reopened for Easter 2012, and fully reopened as a Visitor Centre in May 2012. Zoo The zoo that the station was built to serve pre-dates the railway by three years, having been established in 1893. A rocky inlet was dammed off to create a living environment for sea lions, and cages were constructed to house polar bears; and it was these attractions that gave the railway's locomotives their names. The zoo remained popular until the outbreak of the First World War when the zoo closed for the duration. When reopened in 1920 the polar bears were no longer a feature, but the sea lions survived until the complex closed at the end of the 1939 season, never to reopen. rightAt various points during the zoo's life there were also brown bear cubs (which for a small fee could be taken for a walk around the cliffs), and an aviary with tropical birds, and it has also been reported that there were penguins, though no evidence has come to light to support this. The remains of the complex are still visible today. The site was used during the filming of an episode from the first series of the popular television drama Lovejoy in 1986 entitled Friends, Romans & Enemies. Today there are several images and displays in the nearby visitor centre and tea rooms which illustrate the zoo when it was open.

The yaw system is located between the wind turbine nacelle and tower. The yaw system of wind turbines is the component responsible for the orientation of the wind turbine rotor towards the wind. History The task of orienting the rotor into the wind was a complicated issue already for historical windmills. The first windmills able to rotate in order to \\"face\\" the wind appeared in the mid-18th century.Wind Power Plants, R. Gasch and J. Twele, Solarpraxis, Their rotatable nacelles were mounted on the main structure of the windmill using primitive wooden gliding bearings lubricated with animal fat. The necessary yawing torque was created by means of animal power, human power or even wind power (implementation of an auxiliary rotor known as fantail). Vertical axis wind turbines (VAWT) do not need a yaw system since their vertical rotors can face the wind from any direction and only their self rotation gives the blades a clear direction of the air flow. Horizontal axis wind turbines however need to orient their rotors into and out of the wind and they achieve that by means of passive or active yaw systems. Horizontal axis wind turbines employ some sort of yaw system which can be passive or active. Both passive and active systems have advantages and disadvantages and various design solutions (both active and passive) are being tried in order to find the optimal design for each wind turbine depending on its size, cost and purpose of operation. Types a) Upwind wind turbine equipped with an active yaw system, b) Upwind wind turbine equipped with a passive yaw system, c) Downwind wind turbine equipped with a passive yaw system. = Active yaw systems = The active yaw systems are equipped with some sort of torque producing device able to rotate the nacelle of the wind turbine against the stationary tower based on automatic signals from wind direction sensors or manual actuation (control system override). The active yaw systems are considered to be the state of the art for all the modern medium and large sized wind turbines, with a few exceptions proving the rule (e.g. Vergnet). The various components of the modern active yaw systems vary depending on the design characteristics but all the active yaw systems include a means of rotatable connection between nacelle and tower (yaw bearing), a means of active variation of the rotor orientation (i.e. yaw drive), a means of restricting the rotation of the nacelle (yaw brake) and a control system which processes the signals from wind direction sensors (e.g. wind vanes) and gives the proper commands to the actuating mechanisms. The most common types of active yaw systems are: * Roller yaw bearing - Electric yaw drive - Brake: The nacelle is mounted on a roller bearing and the azimuth rotation is achieved via a plurality of powerful electric drives. A hydraulic or electric brake fixes the position of the nacelle when the re-orientation is completed in order to avoid wear and high fatigue loads on wind turbine components due to backlash. Systems of this kind are used by most of the wind turbine manufacturers and are considered to be reliable and effective but also quite bulky and expensive. * Roller yaw bearing - Hydraulic yaw drive: The nacelle is mounted on a roller bearing and the azimuth rotation is achieved via a plurality of powerful hydraulic motors or ratcheting hydraulic cylinders. The benefit of the yaw system with hydraulic drives has to do with the inherent benefits of the hydraulic systems such as the high power-to-weight ratio and high reliability. On the downside however the hydraulic systems are always troubled by leakages of hydraulic fluid and clogging of their high pressure hydraulic valves. The hydraulic yaw systems often (depending on the system design) also allow for the elimination of the yaw brake mechanism and their replacement with cut-off valves. * Gliding yaw bearing - Electric yaw drive: The nacelle is mounted on a friction based gliding bearing and the azimuth rotation is achieved via a plurality of powerful electric drives. The need for a yaw brake is eliminated and depending on the size of the yaw system (i.e. size of the wind turbine) the gliding bearing concept can lead to significant cost savings. * Gliding yaw bearing - Hydraulic yaw drive: The nacelle is mounted on a friction based gliding bearing and the azimuth rotation is achieved via a plurality of powerful hydraulic motors or ratcheting hydraulic cylinders. This system combines the characteristics of the aforementioned gliding bearing and hydraulic motor systems. = Passive yaw systems = The passive yaw systems utilize the wind force in order to adjust the orientation of the wind turbine rotor into the wind. In their simplest form these system comprise a simple roller bearing connection between the tower and the nacelle and a tail fin mounted on the nacelle and designed in such a way that it turns the wind turbine rotor into the wind by exerting a \\"corrective\\" torque to the nacelle. Therefore, the power of the wind is responsible for the rotor rotation and the nacelle orientation. Alternatively in case of downwind turbines the tail fin is not necessary since the rotor itself is able to yaw the nacelle into the wind. In the event of skew winds the \\"wind pressure\\" on the swept area causes a yawing moment around the tower axis (z-axis) which orients the rotor. The tail fin (or wind vane) is commonly used for small wind turbines since it offers a low cost and reliable solution. It is however unable to cope with the high moments required to yaw the nacelle of a large wind turbine. The self-orientation of the downwind turbine rotors however is a concept able to function even for larger wind turbines. The French wind turbine manufacturer Vergnet has several medium and large self-orienting downwind wind turbines in production. Passive yaw systems have to be designed in a way that the nacelle does not follow the sudden changes in wind direction with too fast a yaw movement, in order to avoid high gyroscopic loads. Additionally the passive yaw systems with low yaw-friction are subjected to strong dynamic loads due to the periodic low amplitude yawing caused by the variation of the inertia moment during the rotor rotation. This effect becomes more severe with the reduction of the number of blades. The most common passive yaw systems are: * Roller Bearing (free system): The nacelle is mounted on a roller bearing and it is free to rotate towards any direction. The necessary moment comes from a tail fin or the rotor (downwind wind turbines) * Roller Bearing - Brake (Semi-active system): The nacelle is mounted on a roller bearing and it is free to rotate towards any direction, but when the necessary orientation is achieved an active yaw brake arrests the nacelle. This prevents the uncontrolled vibration and reduced gyroscopic and fatigue loads. * Gliding Bearing/Brake (Passive system): The nacelle is mounted on a gliding bearing and it is free to rotate towards any direction. The inherent friction of the gliding bearing achieves a quasi-active way of operation.  Components  The main components of a typical yaw system found on most modern medium or large wind turbines. = Yaw bearing = One of the main components of the yaw system is the yaw bearing. It can be of the roller or gliding type and it serves as a rotatable connection between the tower and the nacelle of the wind turbine. The yaw bearing should be able to handle very high loads, which apart from the weight of the nacelle and rotor (the weight of which is in the range of several tenths of tons) include also the bending moments caused by the rotor during the extraction of the kinetic energy of the wind. = Yaw drives = The yaw drives exist only on the active yaw systems and are the means of active rotation of the wind turbine nacelle. Each yaw drive consists of powerful electric motor (usually AC) with its electric drive and a large gearbox, which increases the torque. The maximum static torque of the biggest yaw drives is in the range of 200.000Nm with gearbox reduction ratios in the range of 2000:1.Bonfiglioli Power & Control Solutions Consequently, the yawing of the large modern turbines is relatively slow with a 360¬∞ turn lasting several minutes. = Yaw brake = Schematic representation of a wind turbine pneumatic yaw brake system. In order to stabilize the yaw bearing against rotation a means of braking is necessary. One of the simplest ways to realize that task is to apply a constant small counter-torque at the yaw drives in order to eliminate the backlash between gear-rim and yaw drive pinions and to prevent the nacelle from oscillating due to the rotor rotation. This operation however greatly reduces the reliability of the electric yaw drives, therefore the most common solution is the implementation of a hydraulically actuated disk brake. The disk brake requires a flat circular brake disk and plurality of brake calipers with hydraulic pistons and brake pads . The hydraulic yaw brakes are able to fix the nacelle in position thus relieving the yaw drives from that task. The cost however of the yaw brake in combination with the requirement of a hydraulic installation (pump, valves, pistons) and its installation in the vicinity of brake pads sensitive to lubricant contamination is often an issue. A compromise that offers several advantages is the use of electric yaw brakes. These replace the hydraulic mechanism of the conventional brakes and with electro-mechanically actuated brake calipers. The use of electric yaw brakes eliminates the complexity of the hydraulic leakages and the subsequent problems that these cause to the yaw brake operation.Hanning & Kahl GmbH Azimutbremsen Several wind turbine design and manufacturing companies experiment with alternative yaw breaking methods in order to eliminate the drawbacks of the existing systems and to reduce the cost of the system. One of these alternatives involves the use of air pressure in order to achieve the necessary yaw braking moment. In this case, some of the gliding surface (usually the axial, due to higher available surface) is utilized in order to accommodate the yaw brake pads and the pneumatic brake mechanism. The pneumatic actuator can be a conventional pneumatic cylinder or even a flexible air chamber which inflates when supplied with pressurized air. Such a device is able to exert very high braking forces due to the high active surface. This is achieved with a simple industrial air pressure compression system () which is a reliable and low cost solution. Furthermore, in the even of leakage, the environmental impact is practically zero compared to hydraulic oil leakages. Finally brake actuators can be produced with very low cost from lightweight plastic materials thus significantly reducing the overall cost of the system. = Yaw vane (passive systems)= The yaw vane (or tail fin) is a component of the yaw system used only on small wind turbines with passive yaw mechanisms. It is nothing more than a flat surface mounted on the nacelle by means of a long beam. The combination of the large surface area of the fin and the increased length of the beam create a considerable torque which is able to rotate the nacelle despite the stabilizing gyroscopic effects of the rotor. The required surface area however for a tail fin to be able to yaw a large wind turbine is enormous thus rendering the use of such a device un- economical.

The yaw system is located between the wind turbine nacelle and tower. The yaw bearing is the most crucial and cost intensive component of a yaw system found on modern horizontal axis wind turbines. The yaw bearing must cope with enormous static and dynamic loads and moments during the wind turbine operation, and provide smooth rotation characteristics for the orientation of the nacelle under all weather conditions. It has also to be corrosion and wear resistant and extremely long lasting. It should last for the service life of the wind turbine) while being cost effective.  History  Windmills of the 18th century began implementing rotatable nacelles to capture wind coming from different directions. The yaw systems of these \\"primitive\\" windmills were surprisingly similar to the ones on modern wind turbines. The nacelles rotated by means of wind driven yaw drives known as fantails, or by animal power, and were mounted on the windmill towers by means of an axial gliding bearing. These gliding bearings consisted of multiple gliding blocks fixed on the windmill tower structure. These blocks maintained sliding contact with a gliding ring on the nacelle. The gliding blocks were wooden cube-like pieces with convex gliding surface covered with animal fat, or even lined with copper (or brass) sheet as a friction reduction means. These wooden blocks were fixed in wooden slots, carved in the wooden bearing substructure, by means of nails or wedges and were carefully leveled to create a flat surface where the nacelle gliding ring could glide. The gliding blocks, despite the lubrication would wear quite often and would have to be exchanged. This operation was relatively simple due to the wedge-based connection between substructure and gliding blocks. The gliding blocks were further locked via movable locking devices which, in a different form, remain as a technical solution in modern gliding yaw bearings. The gliding ring of the windmill nacelle was made from multiple wooden parts and, despite the old construction techniques, was usually quite level, allowing the nacelle to rotate smoothly around the tower axis.Molenbouw, A. Sipman, Zutphen, 2002, The hybrid yaw bearing system combines the solutions old windmills used. This system comprises multiple removable radial gliding pads in combination with an axial roller bearing. Schematic representation of a historical hybrid yaw bearing with axial rollers and radial gliding pads.  Types  The main categories of yaw bearings are: * Roller Yaw Bearing: Large diameter bearing (usually four-point bearing) * Gliding Yaw Bearing: Dry or lubricated gliding bearing with plurality of axial and radial gliding pads being in friction contact with a large diameter steel disk, usually combined with the gear-rim as a single element  Roller yaw bearing  Schematic representation of a typical roller yaw bearing configuration of a modern wind turbine. The roller yaw bearing is a common technical yaw bearing solution followed by many wind turbine manufacturers as it offers low turning friction and smooth rotation of the nacelle. The low turning friction permits the implementation of slightly smaller yaw drives (compared to the gliding bearing solution), but on the other hand requires a yaw braking system. Some manufacturers use a plurality of smaller yaw drives (usually six) to facilitate easy replacement. Such a configuration with plurality of yaw drives often offers the possibility of active yaw braking using differential torque from the yaw drives. In this case half of the yaw drives apply a small amount of torque for clockwise rotation and the other half apply torque in the opposite direction and then activate the internal magnetic brakes of the electric motor. In this way the pinion-gear rim backlash is eliminated and the nacelle is fixed in place.  Gliding yaw bearing  Schematic representation of the components of a modern gliding yaw bearing. Schematic representation of a typical gliding yaw bearing configuration of a modern wind turbine. The gliding yaw bearing is a combined axial and radial bearing, which serves as a rotatable connection of the wind turbine nacelle and the tower. Contrary to the old windmill concept, the modern yaw bearings support the nacelle also from the to thus restraining the nacelle from being rotated by the Y-axis due to the moments induced by the upper half of the rotor sweep disk and the X-axis due to the torque of the drive train (i.e. rotor, shaft, generator, etc. ). Principally, the simplest way to accomplish the yaw bearing tasks with gliding elements is with two gliding planes for the axial loads (top and bottom) and a radial gliding surface for the radial loads. Consequently, the gliding yaw bearing comprises three general surfaces covered with multiple gliding pads. These gliding pads come in sliding contact with a steel disk, which is usually equipped with gear teeth to form a gliding-disk/gear-rim. The teeth may be located at the inner or the outer cylindrical face of the disk, while the arrangement of the gliding pads and their exact number and location vary strongly among the existing designs. To assemble the gliding yaw bearings, their cages split in several segments that are assembled together during wind turbine installation or manufacturing. In its simplest form, the gliding yaw bearing uses pads (usually made out of polymers) distributed around the three contact surfaces to provide a proper guiding system for the radial and axial movement with relatively low friction coefficient. Such systems are economical and very robust but do not allow individual adjustment of the axial and radial gliding elements. This function importantly minimizes the axial and radial \\"play\\" of the gliding bearing due to manufacturing tolerances as well as due to wear of the gliding pads during operation. To solve this problem, yaw systems incorporate pre-tensioned gliding bearings. These bearings have gliding pads that are pressed via pressure elements against the gliding disk to stabilize the nacelle against undesirable movement. The pressure elements can be simple steel springs, pneumatic, or hydraulic pre-tension elements, etc. The use of pneumatic or hydraulic pre-tension elements allows active control of the yaw bearing pre-tension, which provides yaw brake function.  Wear and lubrication  In all gliding bearings wear is an issue of concern, as well as lubrication. Conventional gliding yaw bearings incorporate gliding elements manufactured out of polymer plastics such as polyoxymethylene plastic (POM) or polyamide (PA). To reduce friction, wear, and avoid stick-slip effects (often present in such high friction slow moving systems), lubrication is often introduced. This solution generally solves the gliding issues, but introduces more components to the systems and increases the general complication (e.g., difficult maintenance procedures for removal of used lubricant). Some wind turbine manufacturers now use self lubricating gliding elements instead of a central lubrication system. These gliding elements are manufactured from low friction materials or composites (e.t.g polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon)) that allow reliable operation of dry (non-lubricated) gliding yaw systems.  Maintenance and repair  Despite the fact that the gliding yaw bearings and their components are designed and constructed to last the service life of the wind turbine, it should be possible to replace worn out yaw bearing gliding elements or other components of the yaw system. To allow for replace-ability of worn out components, the yaw systems are designed in segments. Usually one or more gliding planes comprise several sub-elements that contain a number of gliding elements (radial or axial or a combination). These sub-elements can be individually removed and repaired, re-fit or replaced. In this way the yaw bearing can be serviced without the need of dis-assembly of the whole gliding yaw bearing (e.g., in case of a roller yaw bearing, dis-assembly of the whole wind turbine). This rep-arability offered by the segmented design of the gliding yaw bearing is one of the most important advantages of this system against the roller yaw bearing solution. The only remaining issue is the replacement of the gliding elements of the gliding yaw bearing surface, which is not segmented. This is usually the top axial surface of the gliding bearing, which constantly supports the weight of the whole nacelle-rotor assembly. For the gliding elements of this gliding surface to be replaced, the nacelle-rotor assembly must be lifted by an external crane. An alternative solution to this problem is the use of mechanical or hydraulic jacks able to partially or fully lift the nacelle-rotor assembly while the gliding yaw bearing is still in place. In this way and by providing a small clearance between the gliding elements and the gliding disk, it is possible to exchange the sliding elements without dismantling the gliding yaw bearing.  Bearing Adjustment  Detailed view of a typical pre-tension system for an azimuth (yaw) gliding bearing of a modern wind turbine. When the wind turbine nacelle is positioned on the tower and the yaw bearing assembly is completed it is necessary to adjust the pressure on the individual gliding pads of the bearing. This is necessary in order to avoid un-even wear of the gliding pads and excessive loading on some sectors of the yaw bearing. In order to achieve that, an adjustment mechanism is necessary, which enables the technicians to adjust the contact pressure of each individual gliding element in a controllable and secure way. The most common solution is the utilization of bottom bearing plates equipped with large opening, which accommodate the adjustable gliding bearing systems. These adjustable gliding bearings comprise a gliding unit (i.e. gliding pad) and an adjustable pressure distribution plate. In between the gliding pad and the pressure plate several spring (pre- tension) elements are located. The vertical position of the pressure plates is usually controlled by an adjustment screw. This adjustment screw presses against the pressure plate while being retained by a counter-pressure support plate, fixed on the bearing assembly with strong bolts. In this way it is possible to apply various levels of contact pressure among the different gliding pads and therefore to ensure that each gliding component of the yaw bearing arrangement is performing as anticipated.

He was educated at Mount Albert Grammar School, where he enjoyed success as a boxer, defeating Kerry Ashby in the final of the weight division of the school's boxing championships in 1944. He won the same division as well as the open championship the following year. Engel was the stroke of the West End Rowing Club eight that won the men's eight title at the New Zealand championships in 1949; the other crew members were Kerry Ashby, Bill Tinnock, Murray Ashby, Don Rowlands, Grahame Jarratt, Bruce Culpan, Edwin Smith, and Donald Adam (cox). The same crew subsequently represented Auckland in the 1949 interprovincial rowing championships, and were again victorious. The latter race was seen as an important trial for the 1950 British Empire Games, and the entire West End crew was selected to represent New Zealand. At the 1950 Games, raced on Lake Karapiro, the New Zealanders finished second in a time of 6:27.5, half a second behind the winning Australian crew.

She took political refuge in Iceland in 1981, following the declaration of martial law in the People's Republic of Poland. She has been living in Reykjavik, Iceland since 1982. In 1996, she began working on individual and mass graves exhumation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Since then, she has been responsible for the excavation and identification of over 2,000 victims, and in 2005 she was nominated to the list of the 1,000 Women for the Nobel Peace Prize.  Biography  Dr. Klonowski has completed courses at the University of Bretagne Occidentale, Brest, France, and the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C. She is a member of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences. In 1981, she became head of the laboratory at the Department of Pathology (Forensic Medicine Division), University of Iceland, Reykjavik. In 1996, she began working for the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the Hague in 1996 on individual and mass graves exhumation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Since then, she has worked with the Bosniak Commission on Missing Persons, Physicians for Human Rights, as director of the Monitoring Exhumations Project of International Forensic Program, and as a member of Forensic Experts Team of the State Commission for Tracing the Missing Persons, Bosnia-Herzegovina. In 2002, she was the only woman working for the International Commission on Missing Persons (ICMP), established by the Bosnian state in 1996. In 2007, she was working as a Senior Forensic Anthropologist for the International Commission on Missing Persons.  Work in Bosnia and Herzegovina  In 1996, Dr. Klonowski left her position as a specialist in paternity inquiries to work excavating mass graves throughout Bosnia. She returned by herself in again 1998, volunteering to work directly for Bosnian Muslims who, she says, \\"have the least money, and the most dead.\\" The task she and her team face is far from simple, working in bombed-out clothing factories and other makeshift morgues. Of her work, she says, \\"I love bones; bones speak to me. I can look at some bones and I know what illnesses the person had, how he walked, how he liked to sit. I can determine nationality by bones. A Muslim‚Äôs femur is bent into a slight arc, because Muslims squat. Japanese have the same feature because they often kneel.\\" Since beginning her work in Bosnia, Dr. Klonowski has played a critical role in helping many grieving families identify their missing loved ones. = Motivation = Klonowski explained to BBC that her interest in identifying the dead goes back to the exhumation of her grandfather from the Katyn Forest massacre in Poland, 1940. He was in the Polish Army reserve in 1939 and was sent to the east, where he was captured and later shot by the Russians. He was uncovered in the first exhumation. That event, she said, was what gave her the belief that relatives should have remains over which to mourn. \\"It is absolutely important and the same all over the world. When someone you love dies, you bury them or perhaps scatter the ashes (...) Our human reaction is to have a place to go and sit or pray or put a candle or a flower. It is exactly the same whatever religion.\\" When the Bosnian war broke out in 1992, she was \\"...horrified. It was part of Europe. You saw the horse carts, the people on tractors, the burned houses. I felt I was totally useless as a human being. So when the war ended and there was talk of exhumation, this was something I could do.\\" = Excavation = Klonowski's project, to attempt to exhume and identify all of the victims of the Bosnian war \\"was not an easy one to start nor has it been straightforward to carry out.\\" The complexity of the job goes far beyond what the simplicity of the phrase \\"DNA\\" might suggest. To begin with, she must contend with the complex physical history of the graves themselves. \\"There are primary, secondary and even tertiary graves,\\" she says. Once those carrying out the massacre realized that the outside wirld knew what was happening, they began moving bodies to more and more remote sites. Klonowski explains, \\"They brought in back-hoes and diggers to do the job and the decomposing bodies often broke up. Sometimes we get different parts of a body from different graves. Once I predicted that two pieces of bone would fit together. They did. People applauded.\\" In other cases, identification isn't simply possible. In one case, the remains of a girl's relative were found - remains which could have been any of her five brothers or her father. Dr. Klonowski related that, \\"I asked if she wanted them buried. She said she would wait for completion.\\" Often, due to financial restrictions, DNA testing is not an option, or is only able to go so far. Klonowski says, \\"...this means that we often have to use other means of making a final confirmation, such as bone structure, previous fractures and teeth. That is where I come in. Sometimes we get a DNA match to any of perhaps several brothers and we cannot identify an individual.\\" The graves come in many shapes and sizes. Of the two thousand bodies which Dr. Konowski has exhumed, she has \\"fished them out of wells, hauled them out of caves, dug them out of rubbish tips or from under piles of pig bones‚Äù In his book Like Eating A Stone, Wojciech Tochman described one of Dr. Klonowski's excavations. Travelling to the site, the exhumation convoy is protected by soldiers from the international forces (SFOR). First, sappers and a speleologist enter the site - often a cave or open pit - in order to reconnoitre and to check for mines. When they are late, it is not unusual for Dr. Klonowski to climb down alone. However, in the case which Tochman describes, ‚ÄúA speleologist went down on a rope and came back up. He said the pit was twenty metres deep, a beautiful chimney-shaped cave; it had honey-beige walls and was full of stalagmites. At the bottom there were some clothes, blankets and bones. He brought up a single skull as proof they were human. (‚Ä¶) Rope ladders were let down, replaced two days later by metal ones - better, because they‚Äôre stiff. \\" The bodies were lifted out of the pit using a rope system, and their sexes were identified before they were packed into plastic bags. At this exhumation, nine bodies were recovered on the first day, and sixteen on the second. Two of the bodies, both female, were identified on site by surviving former prisoners. Dr Klonowski expects that completion of the excavation and identification process, if even possible, will take another 10 years, and she \\"intends to be there to see it through\\". = Conflict = Eva (Ewa) Klonowski first worked for the US-based Physicians for Human Rights, a contractor for the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal. However, these organizations were only interested in gathering evidence about how people died and who killed them. Klonowski admits frustration with that approach, since it excludes identification from the process. From the start, her determination has clashed with lack of funding, indifferent governments, and ulterior political motives. In 2001, this led her to start working with the International Commission on Missing Persons, which aims identify the victims. Klonowski has also been critical of the motives of many of those working on exhumations of the mass graves. The initiative receives significant external funding, and when asked, Klonowski said, \\"God forbid [that the excavations be completed]. It‚Äôd be the end of the high incomes, careers and trips to international conferences. The digging has to be done very gradually. It has got to last for years, until retirement. What about the mothers and widows? Who cares? Who‚Äôs bothered about them? Nobody cares that I care. It grieves me, even though it‚Äôs not my country and they‚Äôre not my people..‚Äù = Impact = During her time in Bosnia, Dr Klonowski has identified more than two thousand family members, and has seen first hand the effect which having even part of a body identified as a loved one has on relatives of the victims . A woman named Mersada told the author of Like Eating A Stone that, ‚ÄúEveryone in Bosnia knows Dr. Ewa. She digs up bones here and identifies people. She has found my son for me and has promised to find the other‚Äù In Like Eating A Stone, Klonowski recounted the reactions of some family members which particularly stood out in her memory: > \\"In one factory where we were examining bones, I heard a woman sobbing near > a body bag. She was clutching her hands to her chest. Her sobbing and > choking became uncontrollable and she was collapsing, so we called an > ambulance. I noticed she was holding part of a shoe with thread hanging from > it. She had recognized it as the shoe of her son which she had mended. The > ambulance crew wanted to take it off her but I told them they would have to > cut her hands off first. > Another woman once sat quietly patting some bones. A tear slowly fell from > her right eye. Her brother said it was time to go and she replied: 'Let me > touch him just once more.' I showed a skull to one woman who recognized the > teeth of the dead husband. Her daughters were with her and crying. One of > them asked me to take the skull back and close the body bag but the woman > reached back in, took out some bones and started to kiss them.\\" Dr. Klonowski's work is particularly valuable for the attention she pays to identifying the victims and reassembling remains. She is unique in this respect - Tochman writes, \\"In the places where Ewa doesn‚Äôt go, no-one is particularly concerned whether a skull fits a spine. If five bodies are dug up, at most they have to be divided into five bags and buried in five coffins. If they were to assemble all the bones they dig up as painstakingly as Ewa does, there would be enough work for several anthropologists for a hundred years.‚Äù Additionally, the results of her work have immense promise for future identification of the victims of other mass disasters. Authorities in Thailand, for example, are trying to learn from her experience in the aftermath of the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami.  Honors  In 2002, Dr. Klonowski was awarded the Officer‚Äôs Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland by President Aleksander Kwa≈õniewski In 2005, her name was added to the list on a joint application called 1,000 Women for the Nobel Peace Prize. She has also received honorary citizenship from the authorities of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

It was one of the first structures to be built outside the Old City of Jerusalem ‚Äì the others being Kerem Avraham, the Bishop Gobat school, Mishkenot Sha‚Äôananim, and the Russian Compound ‚Äì and paved the way for the expansion of Jerusalem in the 19th century. As a philanthropic institution offering academic and vocational training to hundreds of orphaned and abandoned Arab children, it also exerted a strong influence on the Arab population of Jerusalem and the Middle East through its graduates, who spread its philosophies of \\"orderliness, discipline, and German language\\" throughout the region.Ben-Arieh (1979), p. 451. The Syrian Orphanage was born out of South German Pietism, which combined Biblicism, idealism, and religious individualism. The orphanage provided both academic and vocational training to orphaned boys and girls from Palestine, Syria, Egypt, Ethiopia, Armenia, Turkey, Russia, Iran, and Germany, graduating students skilled in such trades as tailoring, shoemaking, engraving, carpentry, metalworking, pottery, painting, printing, farming, and gardening. In 1903 a school for the blind was opened on the premises, including dormitories, classrooms and vocational workshops. The orphanage also operated its own printing press and bindery; flour mill and bakery; laundry and clothing-repair service; carpentry; pottery factory; tree and plant nursery; and brick and tile factory. Located on high ground and surrounded by a high stone wall, the orphanage's distinctive onion-dome tower, multistory buildings, and decorative facades exuded the power and influence of European Christians in Jerusalem in the mid-19th century. Continuous building and land acquisitions increased the size of the orphanage grounds to nearly 150 acres (600 dunam) by World War I.Chinkis, Binyamin. \\"A Peek Behind the Gates of the Schneller Compound\\". Hamodia Israel News, 2 July 2009, pp. A22‚ÄìA23. At the beginning of World War II, the British mandatory government deported the German teachers and turned the compound into a closed military camp with the largest ammunition stockpile in the Middle East. On March 17, 1948, the British abandoned the camp and the Etzioni Brigade of the Haganah used it as a base of operations during the 1948 Israeli War of Independence. For the next 60 years the site served as an Israeli army base known as Camp Schneller. The army vacated the premises in 2008. As of 2011, the compound is being developed for luxury housing. In 2015, remains of a Jewish settlement of the late Second Temple period were discovered at the site. In 2016, archaeologists unearthed an ancient Roman bathhouse and a large wine production facility. History =J. L. Schneller's family house (1854-60)= View of the onion-dome tower and other buildings of the Schneller Orphanage from Malkhei Yisrael Street In the mid-19th century, English and German Protestant missions were operating in the Old City of Jerusalem. In 1854 Johann Ludwig Schneller (1820‚Äì1896), a German Lutheran missionary, came to Jerusalem from W√ºrttemberg together with his wife Magdalene B√∂hringer and six other members of the Brudergemeinde of Saint Chrischona, Basel, Switzerland, in order to manage the German Protestant mission.Kark, et al. (2008), p. 162. On 11 October 1855 Schneller bought from the people of Lifta a parcel of land outside their village, approximately northwest of Jaffa Gate, with the intention of living among and missionising to the local Arab population, and drew up plans for the construction of a home for his family.Ben-Arieh (1979), p. 102. The house was constructed from 1855‚Äì56. After Schneller and his family took occupancy, the house was attacked several times by Arab robbers from the village of Beit Sorek, forcing them to retreat to the safety of the Old City. At the end of the decade, after the Turks had erected outposts and dispatched armed guards on horseback to patrol Jaffa Road (the route between Jerusalem and the port city of Jaffa, which lay near the Schneller compound), Schneller and his family were able to return to their home. =Schneller's Syrian Orphanage (est. 1860)= In 1860 Lebanese Druze massacred thousands of Maronite Christians in Lebanon and Syria. Schneller travelled to Beirut with the intention of rescuing battle-orphaned children. He was rebuffed by the local community, which did not trust foreign Protestant missionaries, but managed to bring back nine orphaned boys to Jerusalem in October 1860. He decided to open an orphanage for them in his home, and by the end of 1861 had enrolled 41 boysBen-Arieh (1979), p. 447. in what became known as the Syrian Orphanage (). Over the next four years Schneller expanded his property to 13.6 acres (55 dunam) and erected a -high stone wall around it.Ben-Arieh (1979), p. 104. Through 1867 Schneller expanded and added new infrastructure, creating a kitchen, dining room, storage cellar, bedrooms and living areas. In 1867 the orphanage began accepting girls. Funds for construction and expansion, together with clothing and blankets, were solicited from Protestant communities in Germany and Switzerland. Between 1861 and 1885 Schneller collected a total of 550,000 francs in donations. =Enrollment, staff and curriculum= Schneller was determined to give orphaned and abandoned Arab children a complete education, including teaching them a trade. To that end, he employed both academic and vocational teachers, primarily from Germany. The latter led professional workshops in tailoring, shoemaking, engraving, carpentry, metalworking, pottery, painting, printing, farming, and gardening. Children stayed at the orphanage for up to 10 years, graduating at the age of 18. They came from all parts of Palestine as well as Syria, Egypt, Ethiopia, Armenia, Turkey, Russia, Iran, and Germany. They were also of differing religious denominations, including Protestant, Greek Orthodox, Catholic, Coptic, and Maronite. Notwithstanding the ethnic diversity of the student body, the language of instruction was German and Arabic. Most of the teachers employed during the orphanage's first 50 years were German, with some Armenians and Arabs.Ben-Arieh (1979), p. 448. In 1876 the orphanage had an enrollment of 70 students aged 4 to 17. By 1898 enrollment stood at 200 students. By the time of Schneller's death on 18 October 1896, 1500 students had passed through the orphanage's doors. The actual number of graduates totaled 425 in 1885 and 1169 at the 50th anniversary of the orphanage in 1910.Ben-Arieh (1979), pp. 447‚Äì448. =The school for the blind, est. 1901= Blindenheim, the school for the blind, erected in 1903 In 1901 a German noble bequeathed his entire fortune of 700,000 marks toward the establishment of a school for the blind at the orphanage. It opened in 1903 with space for 40 to 50 children, plus workshops to teach the blind weaving and spinning. =Expansion= Besides classes and vocational workshops, the orphanage operated its own printing press and bindery where it produced its own textbooks, Braille books, and German-language newspapers. It also operated a flour mill and bakery that produced 35,000 loaves of bread a year, a laundry and clothing-repair service, a carpentry, a pottery factory that produced all the clay utensils used in the orphanage, and a tree and plant nursery. At the beginning of the 20th century, a large brick and tile factory was erected on the premises, which produced one million bricks and 250,000 tiles annually.Ben-Arieh (1979), pp. 448‚Äì449. In 1889 Schneller acquired 1,235 acres (5,000 dunam) in Bir Salem (today Kibbutz Netzer Sereni) in order to develop an agricultural school and land for settlement for his students and graduates. In 1906 another 890 acres (3,600 dunam) was added to the original parcel. Although the agricultural school did not materialise, the grain, fruits and vegetables produced by the farm supplemented the orphanage diet during the food shortages of World War I.Ben-Arieh (1979), pp. 450‚Äì451. =Administration after J. W. Schneller (1889-1940)= In 1889 Schneller gave over the operation of the orphanage to a consortium based in Stuttgart, while his eldest son, Theodor (1856‚Äì1935), became manager of the institution.Kark et al. (2008), p. 164. In 1927 Theodor's youngest son, Ernst, took over the management of the institution until its confiscation by the British in 1940. Architecture Close-up of epigram in German and Arabic on the main building's fa√ßade Like other European Christian institutions built in Jerusalem in the 1800s, the Schneller Orphanage was situated on high ground and was surrounded by a high stone wall, with an iron gate that was locked at night.Kark and Nordheim (2001), p. 126. The property exuded the power and influence of European Christians in Jerusalem with its multistory buildings, a clock tower, and decorative fa√ßade, including reliefs in stone and epigrams.Kark and Nordheim (2001), p. 132. Engraved on the fa√ßade of the main building is the verse \\"Jesus the Messiah, have compassion upon us!\\" in German and Arabic, as well as the name of the institution, Syrian Orphanage (). There is also a stone relief of a lamb carrying a flag with a cross on it. Following the visit of Kaiser Wilhelm to Jerusalem in 1898, the orphanage received three bells for its tower. The architectural style of the main building is a combination of Southern German and local Arabic. The tile roof and onion-dome tower mounted on a square base reflects the former, while wide, rounded arches for doors and windows reflect the latter.Kark and Nordheim (2001), p. 133. A lightning rod extends from the onion dome. The H-shaped main building has two interior courtyards which held a water cistern, garden and play area. The entire building covers an area of 50,590 square feet (4,700 square meters). At three stories, the main building housed the central dining room, a kitchen, a study hall, a library, a reading room, a small museum, and a Lutheran church in which students and staff worshipped. Johann Ludwig Schneller brought in skilled Arab laborers from Bethlehem and Beit Jala to construct a total of eight buildings, which were constructed in stages and completed in the early 20th century. The year of completion and the name of the German city in which the donors for that building lived were engraved on each building fa√ßade. One of the buildings, called ‚Äúthe Red House‚Äù or ‚Äúthe model house,‚Äù was built entirely from materials produced on the orphanage grounds, including bricks, floor tiles and wrought-iron work. For most of its existence, the orphanage was in a continual state of expansion and modernization. Ruth Kark et al. notes: > ... the locksmith-shop was remodeled and changed location within the complex > five times between the period of 1861 and 1930 (1861, 1867, 1900, 1908, > 1930).

(2008), p. 166. One of the Schneller Houses, bearing the German city name of M√ºnchen (Munich). Johann Ludwig Schneller also purchased land in the vicinity of the orphanage and constructed houses for workers. Two of these Batei Schneller (Schneller Houses) still stand across the street from the main entrance, as well as three of the original five homes built several yards to the west (near the present corner of Malkhei Yisrael and Sarei Yisrael Streets). A plaque on each home bears the name of the German city of its donors. The cities are: Halle, Stuttgart, Kletz, Munich, Hamburg, Petersberg, and Erpfingen, Schneller's birthplace.Ben-Arieh (1979), p. 449. 20th century 1935 funeral service for Theodor Schneller in the orphanage's Lutheran church By 1903 the educational facility had grown to eight buildings and included the orphanage, the school for the blind, and vocational workshops for youth. In 1910, the jubilee year of the orphanage's founding, a fire destroyed the third floor and wooden roof of the main building, and damaged the second floor where the church was housed. Ludwig Schneller, a son of the founder who was the administrator at the time, managed to collect over 200,000 marks in donations from Germany and rebuilt the entire structure.Ben-Arieh (1979), p. 450. The upper story of the building was rebuilt in stone. Building and expansion continued up to World War I, by which time the orphanage occupied 150 acres (600 dunam) of land. The Schneller grounds reached all the way to present-day Romema, where Schneller planted forests on land that eventually housed the Jerusalem Biblical Zoo. The orphanage's holdings were gradually reduced to 17.5 acres with the sale of land to the new neighborhoods of Mekor Baruch and Kerem Avraham. During World War I, the compound was used by the Turkish army and its allies as a barracks. From 1921 to 1927, Theodor Schneller resumed management of the orphanage, overseeing the modernization of the property with electrical and sewage installations, as well as new machinery for the various workshops. His son Ernst directed the orphanage from 1927 until its confiscation by the British army in 1940. The orphanage's German funding sources were severely curtailed during the 1930s when the Nazi government of Germany banned citizens from sending funds abroad. Military base =British military camp= One of the orphanage buildings, behind a high stone wall and protective fencing When World War II broke out, the British shut down the orphanage and deported its German teachers. The British turned the compound into a closed military camp known as the Schneller Barracks, installing about 50 watchtowers and huts. The camp housed the largest ammunition stockpile in the Middle East, as well as grain storehouses. The Royal Army Pay Corps 90th Battalion occupied the barracks in the late 1940s. The British camp was targeted for attack by the Irgun on two occasions. On 27 June 1939, the paramilitary group placed a letter bomb in the mailbox attached to the outside wall; the subsequent explosion collapsed part of the wall and injured five Arabs in the vicinity. On 12 March 1947, the Irgun penetrated the camp itself in a pre-dawn operation and detonated explosives in one of the buildings to protest the imposition of martial law on Jerusalem. One British soldier was killed and eight injured in the blasts; martial law was lifted four days later. =Israeli military base= Schneller Orphanage after occupation by Palmach Harel Brigade stationed in the orphanage, 1948 On 17 March 1948, the British abandoned the camp and the Etzioni Brigade of the Haganah used it as a home base during the 1948 Israeli War of Independence. For the next 60 years, the compound served as a training base for the Israel Defense Forces and an army clinic; at one point, it also served as headquarters for the Home Front Command. In 1951 the Israeli army summoned representatives of the World Lutheran Church to remove religious artifacts from the orphanage church; church representatives removed bells, windows and a pipe organ, but left the heavy marble altar encased in a wooden chest. The church was then converted into a basketball arena for the soldiers. In October 2009, on a tour of the facility after the army had vacated the grounds, the provost of the Evangelical German Lutheran Church of the Redeemer noticed the chest and asked for it to be opened, exposing the altar. The Lutherans negotiated for it to be moved to the Lutheran church at Augusta Victoria Hospital, where it was inaugurated in November 2010. During the 60 years of occupancy by the Israeli army, the base was served by an army synagogue in one of the halls of the main building, including a Torah ark, bookcase, and a balcony door set with 12 stained-glass windows depicting the Twelve Tribes of Israel. Current use In 2008 the army base relocated to the Ofrit base near Mount Scopus. The Jerusalem municipality put together a \\"preservation and construction plan\\" for the Schneller compound, calling for the eight historic buildings to be developed for public use by the Orthodox Jewish community nearby. In November 2010, part of the Schneller grounds were designated as a public parking lot by the municipality to ease the parking problems in the neighboring Geula commercial district. One hundred parking spaces were made available for up to three hours.\\"Israel News\\", Hamodia, 4 November 2010, p. A15. In 2011 the Israel Land Administration approved plans for the development of 218 luxury apartments on the property while preserving the eight historic orphanage buildings.Spielman, Sarah. \\"Merom Yerushalayim at Schneller's: From estate to military camp ... to estate once more\\". Hamodia, 24 November 2011, pp. A16‚ÄìA17. As of 2012, parts of the complex are being used for a Bais Yaakov girls' school, a Gerrer Talmud Torah, a training area for urban combat police, and municipal waste storage. Successor schools The philosophy and mission of the Schneller Orphanage continued after World War II in two successor schools in the Middle East. *The Johann Ludwig Schneller School in Khirbat Qanafar, Western Beqaa District, Lebanon, was started in Lebanon in 1948 by Elias al-Haddad and 12 Schneller students, and was established in its present location in 1952 by Hermann Schneller, a grandson of Johann Ludwig Schneller. Like the Schneller Orphanage in Jerusalem, it provides academic and vocational training for impoverished local children. Today the school is owned and operated by the National Evangelical Church of Beirut. *The Theodor Schneller School was founded in Marka, northwest of Amman, Jordan, in 1959 by Hermann Schneller and graduates of the Schneller Orphanage in Jerusalem. Providing academic and vocational training for 265 orphaned and impoverished boys, it is funded by the Schneller Schools Society in Stuttgart and is under the auspices of the Episcopal Church in Jerusalem. The Marka refugee camp, established nearby in 1968, is often called the \\"Schneller camp\\" because of its proximity to this school. References Sources Kark, Ruth; Denecke, Dietrich; Goren, Haim.

The area runs adjacent to Melbourne Chinatown on Little Bourke Street. According to the 2001 Australian census, Melbourne has the largest Greek Australian population in Australia (151,785 or around 47%), and the largest Greek population of any city in the world ‚Äì outside Greece. Economic bilateral relations between Australia and Greece are worth over A$140 million. Melbourne is also a sister city to Thessaloniki, Greece‚Äôs second-largest city. The Precinct The Greek Precinct is located between Swanston Street and Russell Street, along Lonsdale Street, in the Melbourne city centre. It is home to many Greek restaurants and Greek cultural shops. Located on the corner of Lonsdale Street and Russell Street is the Greek Community Centre of Melbourne, and at 209 Lonsdale Street is the Sam Papasavas Building - the home of the Australia-Greek Learning and Resource Centre of the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT). Located nearby, on the corner of La Trobe Street and William Street, is the Hellenic Foundation for Culture's centre and the Hellenic Museum of Melbourne. Both the centre and museum are housed in the historic former Melbourne Mint, and is contiguous with the National Centre for Hellenic Studies and Research of La Trobe University. In March 2009, the Government of Victoria and the City of Melbourne announced that the Greek Precinct would receive a A$3.5 million rejuvenation. Antipodes Festival The annual Melbourne Antipodes Festival is held on Lonsdale Street over a week in March, and has been held since 1987.

They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine starts as a narrow, linear passage extending toward the leaf margin. This early stage of the mine is usually obliterated as the mine is enlarged. Immediately following the serpentine stage, the mine broadens to form a large, somewhat inflated blotch. Full-grown larvae drop to the ground and burrow into the soil. Here, they create a relatively tough oval cocoon of silk and small particles of soil. The larvae have a dark brown body and a pale brown to light yellow head.

It is the busiest as well as one of the largest intersections in Kerala. This node intersects the main north-south artery of the state of Kerala, namely, the Kochi Bypass, with three city roads of Kochi viz, the S. A. Road (One of the city's most prominent arterial road in the East-West direction), the Vyttila-Petta Road, and the Thammanam Road. The name Vyttila is said to be evolved from the word \\"Vayal Thala\\" meaning the main part of the paddy field. Once the area including Elamkulam, were paddy fields and paddy cultivation was the main source of income. The paddy field existed from Ernakulam, Girinagar, Panampilly Nagar, Gandhi Nagar, Jawahar Nagar, Kumarananshan Nagar and extended to Kaniyampuzha and Panamkutyy bridge. Some also say that because there existed a bunch of dacoits, who murdered and looted the travelers the name evolved from 'Vazhithala'. Once the Puthenpalam bridge that connected Chilavennoor Lake and Chettichira was the only link from Vayalthala with Ernakulam. Vyttila hosts the Vyttilla Mobility Hub, which converges different ways of surface transport (namely, local as well as long distance buses, rail, Metro Rail and inland water transport) to the city onto a single node. Vyttila is also the name of the region in the city of Kochi, of which the Vyttila Intersection is a part. Until 1967, Vyttila was a panchayat.

He intentionally trips an elderly woman and harasses two women on the street. The mouse then walks into a shop where he tries to buy a bottle of alcoholic cider from the shopkeeper, but the shopkeeper refuses to sell alcohol to him, leading to an argument that causes the mouse to beat him up. The mouse drinks the cider and starts to feel bad about his actions. Finally a cat, who is a man dressed in a cat outfit being a public hero, chases and wins a fight against the mouse, presumably killing him with a brick as the music video ends.

During his time in Bosnia he discovered the Ahmiƒái massacre in which 103 people had been killed. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order on 12 June 1993 on his return to the United Kingdom. He was promoted colonel on 31 December 1993, and went on to take up the position of Chief of Policy at Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe, before officially retiring from the army on 1 February 1996. Career after the army In 1997 Stewart took three weeks' leave from the public relations company Hill & Knowlton to help his friend Martin Bell who was standing for Parliament in Tatton as an Independent candidate. Stewart was alongside Bell when they were confronted by the sitting Conservative Member of Parliament for the constituency, Neil Hamilton and his wife Christine on Knutsford Heath. Bell, who was opposing Hamilton as a result of accusations that Hamilton had accepted money for promoting causes in Parliament, gave Stewart the credit for defining his criticism of Hamilton as having already admitted to \\"conduct unbecoming\\". Since leaving the army Stewart has become a well-known commentator upon military and political affairs, frequently commenting upon the defence policy of the British Government and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. In 2009 he condemned the system compensating injured soldiers, accusing the MOD of acting with \\"the speed of a striking sloth\\". He also accused the government of repeatedly refusing the requests of army commanders for more troops and more helicopters in Afghanistan. Political career On 28 July 2009, it was revealed that Stewart had been approved to put himself forward for selection to constituency associations as a PPC for the Conservative Party. As the former commander of the Cheshire Regiment he was linked to the safe Conservative East Cheshire seats of Macclesfield and Congleton, however the final shortlists for Macclesfield and for Congleton from Conservative Central Office did not contain his name. In summer 2009 he was shortlisted for Beckenham, one of the safest Conservative seats in the country, and on 6 December it was announced that he had been selected as Conservative candidate there, winning an overall majority on the second ballot. At the 2010 general election on 6 May, Stewart was elected as the new MP for Beckenham though was accused of making a crude remark about the outgoing female MP Jacqui Lait. In 2013, Stewart voted against same-sex marriage and called on the then Prime Minister David Cameron to drop the proposal. Five years later in May 2018 he apologised unreservedly in the House of Commons chamber for voting against same-sex Marriage, after he had seen ‚Äúthe joy‚Äù it had brought to the lives same-sex couples. In 2019, he voted to extend same-sex marriage to couples in Northern Ireland. Stewart served on the House of Commons Defence Select Committee and in May 2014 he was one of seven unsuccessful candidates for the chairmanship of the committee. Stewart has been vocal in criticising cuts to the defence budget, suggesting in March 2015, that if the Joint Chiefs of Staff were to resign over the issue it would \\"make a very powerful message\\". When asked if he would resign as an MP himself, he said that he was considering it. Stewart's seat was a target seat for the Liberal Democrats at both the 2017 and 2019 general election, following his open support of Brexit. At the snap 2017 general election, Stewart held his seat with an increased vote share of two percent. But in 2019, his vote share fell by 5.4% as the Liberal Democrats doubled theirs, although still only achieving third place behind Labour. In the House of Commons Stewart sits on the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee and has previously sat on the Committees on Arms Export Controls and Defence Sub- Committee. Controversies In 2016, Stewart was criticised after it was revealed he had described Isabel Hardman, The Spectator's assistant editor, as \\"totty\\". He later apologised to the journalist, but went on to publicly defend himself against an environment that he described as overly 'politically correct'. In 2017, Stewart's name was included on a leaked internal list of Conservative Party MPs who has been alleged to have acted inappropriately. He publicly denied accusations that he was regularly inebriated in Parliament and was inappropriate with female colleagues. Unlike some of the other MPs featured on the leaked list, he was not suspended or subject to further documented disciplinary action. Stewart employs his wife as a Senior Parliamentary Assistant. He was listed in an article in The Daily Telegraph criticising the practice of MPs employing family members, on the lines that it promotes nepotism. Although MPs who were first elected in 2017 have been banned from employing family members, the restriction is not retrospective ‚Äì meaning that Stewart's employment of his wife is lawful. During an interview with Russia Today that followed the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, Stewart spoke in favour of arming teachers in American high schools. In March 2020, Stewart was accused of fueling xenophobia after he described COVID-19 as a ‚Äúfoul Chinese illness‚Äù in a Facebook post. After receiving complaints from constituents, he edited the word 'Chinese' out of the post. Personal life Stewart lives in Beckenham in London. He has six children and is married to Claire Podbielski, whom Stewart met whilst he was commanding British forces in Bosnia in 1993.

According to Rolland, this feeling is the source of all the religious energy that permeates in various religious systems, and one may justifiably call oneself religious on the basis of this oceanic feeling alone, even if one renounces every belief and every illusion.The Ontology of Religiosity: The Oceanic Feeling and the Value of the Lived Experience Freud discusses the feeling in his Future of an Illusion (1927) and Civilization and Its Discontents (1929). There he deems it a fragmentary vestige of a kind of consciousness possessed by an infant who has not yet differentiated himself or herself from other people and things.Freud, Sigmund. Civilization and Its Discontents, pp. 11‚Äì13.  History  On December 5, 1927, Rolland coined the phrase in a letter to Freud, writing that he should consider spiritual experiences, or \\"the oceanic feeling,\\" in his psychological works:\\"Oceanic Feeling\\" by Henri Vermorel and Madeleline Vermoral in International Dictionary of Psychoanalysis . In strict translation: Rolland based his description on the example of Ramakrishna, who had his first spiritual ecstasy at the age of six. From his 10th or 11th year of school on, the trances became common, and by the final years of his life, Ramakrishna's samƒÅdhi periods occurred almost daily. Romain Rolland described the trances and mystical states experienced by Ramakrishna and other mystics as an \\"'oceanic' sentiment\\", one which Rolland had also experienced. As described by Rolland, it is \\"a sensation of ‚Äòeternity‚Äô, a feeling as of something limitless, unbounded,\\" a \\"feeling of an indissoluble bond, of being one with the external world as a whole.\\" Rolland believed that the universal human religious emotion resembled this \\"oceanic sense.\\"page 12 Primitive Passion: Men, Women, and the Quest for Ecstasy By Marianna Torgovnick University of Chicago Press, 1998 In his 1929 book La vie de Ramakrishna, Rolland distinguished between the feelings of unity and eternity which Ramakrishna experienced in his mystical states, and Ramakrishna's interpretation of those feelings as the goddess Kali. Freud ends The Future of an Illusion with a discussion of the concept, and picks up the discussion at the beginning of Civilization and Its Discontents, answering Rolland's request. There he credits the concept to an anonymous friend.  Freud's explanation  Freud argues that the \\"oceanic feeling\\", if it exists, is the preserved \\"primitive ego-feeling\\" from infancy. The primitive ego- feeling precedes the creation of the ego and exists up until the mother ceases breastfeeding. Prior to this, the infant is regularly breastfed in response to its crying and has no concept that the breast does not belong to it. Therefore, the infant has no concept of a \\"self\\" or, rather, considers the breast to be part of itself. Freud argues that those experiencing an oceanic feeling as an adult are actually experiencing a preserved primitive ego- feeling. The ego, in contrast, comes into existence when the breast is taken away, and involves the infant's recognition that it is separate from the mother's breast, and therefore, that other people exist. Freud argues that it would not necessarily contradict psychoanalytical theory for this primary ego- feeling to coexist along with the ego in some people. The main argument for this is that psychoanalytical theory holds that all thoughts are preserved in a conservation of psychic energy. Therefore, the \\"oceanic feeling\\" described as a oneness with the world or a limitlessness is simply a description of the feeling the infant has before it learns there are other persons in the world.  Other explanations  The relevance of Romain's stance on the oceanic feeling has been recognized by scholars, who argue for a more encompassing understanding of religion and spirituality, offering a transformational model of psychology which validates the claims of mystics. Neurotheology, on the other hand, investigates the neurological basis religious experiences, such as oneness with the universe and ecstatic trance. Early on, Ramakrishna's spontaneous experiences have been interpreted as epileptic seizures, an interpretation which was rejected by Ramakrishna himself. According to Anil D. Desai, Ramakrishna suffered from psychomotor epilepsy, also called temporal lobe epilepsy. These experiences can also be intentionally induced. Andrew B. Newberg, Eugene G. d'Aquili, and Vince Rause \\"discovered [...] that intensely focused spiritual contemplation triggers an alteration in the activity of the brain that leads one to perceive transcendent religious experiences as solid, tangible reality. In other words, the sensation that Buddhists call oneness with the universe.\\" See also Notes References Sources   ; (Macmillan Publishers edition). ; (St. Martin's Press edition)    * Category:Psychoanalytic terminology Category:Criticism of religion Category:Words coined in the 1920s ","title":"Oceanic feeling"},{"id":"23898707","text":"Durkin is a surname.

It was a 1939 twelve-cylinder engine, four-door convertible originally built by Lincoln and was specifically modified for the President by a speciality coach builder, Brunn & Company, Inc., in Buffalo, New York, at a cost of $4,950 (the original cost of the car was $8,348.74).Siuru, William D. and Stewart, Andrea.

Presidential Cars and Transportation. Krause Publications, 1995, p. 36. as a reference to its retractable roof, and was famously enjoyed by the president, who had its roof brought down during public gatherings. At other times, the car was used as traditional presidential transportation. This was in spite of a previous assassination attempt on Roosevelt as he was riding in a Buick convertible, prior to the creation of the Sunshine Special. History =Original specifications= The Sunshine Special was originally a Lincoln K-series built by the Lincoln division of Ford, and modified by Brunn & Company to U.S. government specifications. It was powered by a 150hp, 414 cubic inch V12 L-head engine. The limousine was originally equipped with a siren, running lights, and a 2-way radio, as well as extra-wide running boards and grab handles for Secret Service agents. The vehicle had a convertible roof, hence the reasoning for the car's nickname. The car quickly became known as a favorite of the president, who was a polio survivor and used a wheelchair. With the convertible top down Roosevelt sometimes appeared before crowds without actually leaving the vehicle. There are newsreels of the time showing the car being driven on stage, such as at the podium constructed for a campaign appearance at Ebbets Field in New York in 1944. =Following Pearl Harbor= After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the Secret Service began to express concern in relation to potential assassination attempts on the president, as his limousine at that time was not armored and had no protective features. The Secret Service did not use Al Capone's car on 8 December, as some think. Images of the president between the White House and Capitol show him in a car that does not match any of Capone's known automobiles. The Sunshine Special was modified to be capable of protecting him, with armor plating for the doors, bullet-proof tires, inch-thick windows and storage compartments for pistols and sub-machine guns. All of the safety modifications increased the car's weight to 9,300 pounds (4,218 kg). Despite these precautions, Roosevelt preferred to ride with the top down during parades and at most public gatherings. The car was also fitted with the then-current 1942 Lincoln front end in 1942 from the Lincoln H-series. =Travels= When the president traveled, the Sunshine Special, along with other Secret Service vehicles, was either driven to the president's destination (if the distance was short) or was transported on a special rail car. One special rail car was equipped with equipment and supplies for the maintenance of the vehicles. Although some sources allege the Sunshine Special was transported to Tehran, Casablanca, Malta, and Yalta, there appears to be no evidence to confirm this. Wartime censorship makes these claims difficult to disprove; but while there are many photographs and newsreels of President Roosevelt riding in standard military-issue Jeeps during the aforementioned overseas trips, there are no photographs of the Sunshine Special taken on these occasions. The need to maintain secrecy about the president's travel during wartime makes it highly unlikely his special limousine would have been used overseas. The practice of transporting presidential limousines overseas did not start until after the Roosevelt administration. In March 1947 Life featured a photograph of President Truman visiting the pyramids at Teotihuacan near Mexico City, riding in the Sunshine Special or another nearly identical Lincoln. =Following Roosevelt's death= After Roosevelt‚Äôs death in 1945, the Sunshine Special remained in the White House fleet and was used by President Truman until a new fleet of Lincoln limousines was acquired after the 1948 election. The limousine is now on permanent display at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan. The Sunshine Special did travel to the Potsdam Conference in July 1945, for use by President Truman, including tours of the Potsdam area accompanied by Prime Minister Winston Churchill, Admiral Ernest King, and Secretary of State James F. Byrnes, among others. See also * Official state car * Presidential State Car (United States) * Franklin D.

The locomotive was built by W.G. Bagnall & Co., Stafford and delivered to the line in May of that year, providing sole motive power until joined in 1905 by sister locomotive Polar Bear. When delivered to the railway, the locomotive carried an olive green livery with vermilion and yellow lining and the name carried on the side water tank in gold leaf with blue shadowing, with distinctive round \\"spectacle\\" cab windows back and front. These were changed over to rectangular windows very early in the engine's career to improve driver visibility however. One distinctive feature was a displacement lubricator mounted atop the highly polished brass dome. The locomotive was fitted with unusual valve gear patented by E.E. Baguley and is one of only four locomotives to remain in existence with this (the others being Isabel at Amerton Railway, Rishra on the Leighton Buzzard Narrow Gauge Railway, and an unknown Bagnall locomotive on display in India). By the 1920 season the locomotive was deemed too costly for repair and the line purchased two battery electric locomotives that inherited their steam engine names. The modern engines proved to be financially disastrous and within a few years \\"Sea Lion\\" had been returned to the works for re-build. It continued to operate the line until closure at the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939. When the line eventually re-opened in 1950 it was decided to operate with Polar Bear only owing to decrease in demand and the poor condition of Sea Lion which had been stored in the open air for some time. The railway survived until 1962 but by this time Sea Lion was virtually derelict having had many of her brass components removed or stolen. She was saved from scrapping by local preservationist John Walton who transported her to his Steam Centre in Kirk Michael where the engine lay in the car park as an exhibit. When he moved to Loughborough he took the locomotive with him. When the project to restore the railway began, the remains of the locomotive were transported back to the island for restoration and ultimately operation on her original metals and a campaign to have the engine restored was begun. The apprentices of British Nuclear Fuels however stepped in and the engine was taken to Sellafield in 1986 where the restoration was carried out. By 1987 the engine had been transported to the nearby Ravenglass & Eskdale Railway where a section of 2' 0\\" track was laid and the engine turned a wheel under its own steam for the first time since 1939. Thereafter it was returned to works for completion and painting before arriving at Groudle Glen that September to the delight of the railways' restorers, the Isle of Man Steam Railway Supporters' Association. The engine first performed passenger duties that Christmas, appearing in original olive green colour scheme and entered service thereafter. Reboilering was completed in 2003 at which time the locomotive was repainted into the darker brunswick green that it carried in the 1920s and it is this guise that she remains in service today. To honour one of the line's engineers, a plaque in his name, Alastair Lamberton, was erected inside the cab in 1999, and the rebuild plates were also removed from the exterior as part of the reboilering, making for a more authentic appearance. Sea Lion carried a back lamp bracket between the cab windows which is inaccurate (although correct on Polar Bear) as hers was originally on the waistband of the cab sheet. Sea Lion visited the Ffestiniog Railway in 1997, and made a visit to Amberley Museum in 2005 to celebrate Polar Bear's centenary. This visit was immediately followed by a return visit of Polar Bear back to the GGR. She was withdrawn from service following Christmas 2011 for her ten year overhaul. Her boiler was taken to the Isle of Man Railway Workshops for re-tubing, with her frames and motion receiving attention at the Isle of Man Steam Packet Workshops on the island. She was re-assembled and back in service by July 2012 still in her 1920s livery. Following the end of the season she was stripped back to bare metal and received a full re-paint, reappearing at Christmas with a return to her 1896 livery with her name now appearing in gold leaf. The volunteers did a lot of research to ensure this livery was accurate down to the shades of paint used and the livery detail, including the early design of lined out green and black buffer beams which she now carries.

It usually provides a plot of deformation vs compressive force. It is commonly used to evaluate shipping containers made of corrugated fiberboard as well as wooden boxes and crates. Industrial and consumer packages other than boxes can also be subjected to compression testing: drum, pail, bottle, tub etc. Package components are also evaluated for compression resistance. It is usually a laboratory test involving a special machine, a compression tester, to apply controlled compression on a test specimen. A universal testing machine is sometimes configured to perform a package compression test. Compression testing can also involve a superimposed dead load to a test package. Compression test for steel drum Test procedures A common method of conducting the test, as described in several published standard test methods, is to compress a box at a constant rate of 1/2 inch (12.5 mm) per minute between two rigid platens. The platens can be fixed so that they remain parallel or one can be pivoted or \\"floating\\". The test can be conducted on empty or filled boxes, with or without a box closure. Conditioning to standard temperature and humidity is important. The results of the constant rate of compression test can be: * The peak load * The deformation at peak load * The load at a critical deformation (head space, etc.) * The ability of a container to protect the contents from compression damage * etc. The dynamic loads have some relationship with expected field loads.: often factors of 4 or 5 are used to estimate the allowable working load on boxes. A test can also be conducted with platens that are not mechanically driven but are free to move with a fixed mass (or fixed force) loaded upon them. The results of static load testing can be: * The time to failure * The time to a critical deformation * The ability of a container to protect the contents from compression damage * etc. As with any laboratory testing field validation is necessary to determine suitability. Corrugated box testing Corrugated shipping containers are exposed to compression hazards during storage and shipment. Proper compression strength is a key performance factor. =Factors potentially affecting test results= * Size and construction of the specific shipping container under test * Grade and flute structure of corrugated fiberboard * moisture content of the corrugated board (based on relative humidity) * Orientation of the box during the test * Inner supports, if used during testing (wood, corrugated board, cushioning) * Contents (when box is tested with contents) * Box closure * Whether the compression machine has \\"fixed\\" or \\"floating\\" (swiveled) platens. * Previous handling or testing of box *Vent and hand holes * etc. =Estimations= Corrugated fiberboard can be evaluated by many material test methods including an Edge Crush Test (ECT). There have been efforts to estimate the peak compression strength of a box (usually empty, regular singelwall slotted containers, top-to-bottom) based on various board properties. Some have involved finite element analysis. One of the commonly referenced empirical estimations was published by McKee in 1963. This used the board ECT, the MD and CD flexural stiffness, the box perimeter, and the box depth. Simplifications have used a formula involving the board ECT, the board thickness, and the box perimeter. Most estimations do not relate well to other box orientations, box styles, or to filled boxes. Physical testing of filled and closed boxes remains necessary. =Calculating compression requirement= Fiber Box Association have a method for calculating the required compression losses which includes the following factors: * Time * Moisture * Palletizing type * Pallet patterns * Pallet type * Handling Dynamic compression Containers can be subjected to compression forces that involve distribution dynamics. For example, a package may be impacted by an object being dropped onto it (vertical load) or impacted by freight sliding into it (horizontal load). Vehicle vibration can involve a stack of containers and create dynamic compression responses. Package testing methods are available to evaluate these compression dynamics.

Paris has more than two hundred fountains, the oldest dating back to the 16th century. It also has more than one hundred Wallace drinking fountains.239 existing fountains are listed in Paris et ses fontaines, de la Renaissance √† nos jours, texts edited by Dominque Massounie, Pauline-Prevost-Marcilhacy and Daniel Rabreau, in the Collection Paris et son Patrimoine, D√©l√©gation √† l'action artistique de la Ville de Paris, 1995. In addition, according to the official site of Eau de Paris, which maintains the fountains, there are 108 working Wallace fountains in Paris, not listed in Paris et ses fontaines, making a total of 347 fountains, not counting fountains built since 1995. Paris et ses Fontaines cites the number 365 fountains in Paris. (pg. 19). Most of the fountains are the property of the municipality. In 2017, an investigation by the cultural heritage magazine La Tribune de l'art revealed that more than half of these fountains were not functioning.http://www.latribunedelart.com/la-grande-misere-des-fontaines- parisiennes For the list of Paris fountains by arrondissement, See List of Paris fountains.  Paris Fountains of the 16th and 17th centuries  The Fontaine des Innocents in the 1st arrondissement as it looks today. It was moved in 1788 and made into free-standing fountain, and then moved again in 1858 to its present location in the middle of the March√© des Innocents. The Medici Fountain in the Jardin du Luxembourg (1630), was built for Marie de' Medici by Tommaso Francini, a Florentine fountain-maker brought to France by King Henry IV of France. (View of fountain about 1820, after additions by Chalgrin. Source: Biblioth√®que Nationale de Paris) The history of fountains in Paris until the mid-19th century was the history of the city's struggle to provide clean drinking water to its growing population. The building of fountains also depended upon the law of gravity; until the introduction of mechanical pumps, the source of the water had to be higher than the fountain for the water to flow. In the third century BC, the original inhabitants, the Parisii, took their water directly from the River Seine. By the first century BC, the Roman engineers of the town of Lutetia had built the aqueduct of Arcueil using gravity to provide water for their baths and for their public fountains. In the Middle Ages, the Roman aqueduct of Arcueil had fallen into ruins and residents once again took their water from the Seine or from wells. By the reign of Philip II of France (1180‚Äì1223), two large monasteries existed outside the city walls north of Paris; the Abbey of Saint-Laurent, at the foot of Montmartre, and the Abbey of Saint-Martin-des-Champs. These monasteries received fresh water from two aqueducts; the Abbey of Saint Laurent by lead pipes coming from the heights of Romaineville and Menilmontant, and the Abbey of Saint-Martin-des-Champs by a masonry aqueduct coming from the summit of Belleville. In the first half of the 13th century, these two aqueducts were used to supply water to the first recorded fountains in medieval Paris, the Fontaine des Halles, the Fontaine des Innocents, and the Fontaine de Maubu√©e.P.S. Girard, Recherches sur les eaux publiques de Paris, 1812, cited in Paris en qu√™te d'eau by Philippe Cebron de Lisle in Paris et ses Fontaines. These fountains did not gush water; water poured out continually in thin streams from bronze masquerons, masks, usually of animals, into stone basins so local residents could fill their vessels with water. By 1498, when Louis XII of France became King, the water supply of Paris was controlled jointly by the merchants of the city, led by the Pr√©vot des Marchands, and the king. They decided how water would be distributed and were responsible for building public fountains. The water supply of Paris was still very limited; by the end of the 15th century, there were only seventeen fountains providing water in Paris, including five outside the walls. All of the fountains were on the Right Bank; the two aqueducts supplied water, and, as the water table was close to the surface, and it was easy to dig wells there, while on the Left Bank the water table was deep underground and there were no working aqueducts so almost all water had to be carried from the Seine. As a result, the Left Bank had hardly grown since the time of Philip II.Cebron de Lisle, Paris en qu√™te d'eau. p. 32. In the early 17th century, King Henry IV of France decided to bring water to the Left Bank for the University and for the planned Luxembourg Palace of his wife, Marie de' Medici. A new aqueduct was built between 1613 and 1623 to bring water from Rungis. This new aqueduct supplied six new fountains on the Left Bank, including the present-day Medici Fountain, and one on the Right Bank. In addition, five new fountains were built on the right bank using the two original aqueducts. Henry's brought Tommaso Francini, a Florentine fountain maker, to Paris, where he designed the Medici Fountain in the Jardin du Luxembourg. In 1636 he became the Intendant general des Eaux et Fontaines, in charge of all royal fountains and water projects. His descendants held this title until 1781.Philippe Cebron De Lisle, Paris en qu√™te d'eau, p. 34. Another major contribution of Henry IV was the construction between 1578 and 1608 of La Samaritaine, an enormous hydraulic water pump, powered by a water wheel under the Pont Neuf, which lifted water up from the Seine to a reservoir near Saint-Germain-l'Auxerois, for use in the Louvre Palace and the Tuileries Gardens. Two more pumps were added in 1673. Thanks to the pumps and the new aqueduct, by 1673 Paris, with an estimated population of 500,000 people, had 16 fountains on the Right bank fed by aqueducts, 14 fountains on the Left Bank fed by the new Aqueduct of Arcueil, and twenty one new fountains along the Right and Left banks of the river, fed by the new hydraulic pumps. Of the fountains built in the 16th and 17th century, all were either rebuilt or demolished in the following two centuries. Only a few, such as the Fontaine Boucherat, the Fontaine des Innocents and Medici Fountain, all extensively rebuilt, still preserve the character of their time. File:Fontaine des Innocents1.jpgThe Fontaine des Innocents was built in 1549 to welcome King Henry II on his solemn entry to Paris.

(Bibloiotheque d'Art et d'Archeology, Paris)  Paris Fountains of the 18th century  The massive Fontaine des Quatre-Saisons on the rue de Grenelle (7th arrondissement) (1739), by sculptor Edme Bouchardon, had a crowd of monumental statues but only two faucets, and irritated the philosopher Voltaire because of its large scale on the narrow street. The eighteenth century saw the construction of thirty new fountains, of which fourteen still survive, and the building of three ch√¢teaux d'eau, water reservoirs located inside large structures.Christophe Morin, Le 18e si√®cle, Les fontaines de pierre, in Paris et ses fontaines, pg. 80. Many of these fountains were the work of Jean Beausire, who, by royal edict, was Contr√¥leur des b√¢timents of the city of Paris between 1692 and 1740. His fountains were usually small, set against a wall, with a niche and a single spout pouring water into a small basin, but they were dignified and elegant, decorated with seashells, mythological figures, and sometimes had imitations of the calcified walls of grottos, imitating natural springs. In the middle of the 18th century Voltaire and other critics began to demand more open squares and more ornamental fountains. In Les Embellisements de Paris, written in 1749, Voltaire wrote, \\"We have only two fountains in good taste, and they should certainly be better placed. All the others are worthy of a village.\\"Cited by P. Lavadan, Histoire de l'urbanism a Paris (1975), 1993, p. 304. Translation by D.R. Siefkin. The government responded to these demands for grander fountains by commissioning the Fontaine des Quatre-Saisons (1739) and by an even grander project for a square with fountains, Place Louis XV, which became the Place de la Concorde.Janine Barrier, Fontaines et embellissements de Paris, in Paris et ses fontaines, pg. 125. Despite the new fountains, the city had problems supplying enough water to the growing population of the city. In 1776, a private water company, La Comagnie des Eaux de Paris, was started by two mechanical engineers, Jacques-Constantine and Augustin-Charles P√©rier. They promised to deliver water directly to anyone who could pay for it through a system of pipes directly to homes. They imitated the city of London and installed a steam-powered water pump at Chaillot in 1782. The first pumps, built in Birmingham, England, and named Constantine and Augustine, raised water from the Seine and filled four reservoirs near the hill of Chaillot, from which the water flowed downhill through iron pipes (also made in England) to their private subscribers, and also to seven new public fountains. In 1786, after the success of the first pumps, two new engines, Louise and Th√©r√®se, were added along the quai d'Orsay and the Gros Caillou, which, beginning in 1788, pumped water to a tower, which flowed down through pipes to the neighborhoods of les Invalides, Ecole Militaire, and the faubourg Saint-Germain. The creation of the private water company created a bitter political struggle between those who supported the company, including the playwright Pierre Beaumarchais, the author of the Marriage of Figaro, who was one of the directors and became wealthy from the water company, and those who opposed it, including the guild of water-porters, whose jobs were threatened, led by the Comte de Mirabeau. In 1788, after a financial crisis, the company went bankrupt and passed into the hands of the Royal Treasury, but its technical success was proven; of the eighty-five fountains in Paris in 1807, 45 were fed with water from the company's steam pumps.Philippe Cebron de Lisle, Paris en qu√™te d'eau, p. 38. File:Garanci√®re04.JPGFontaine Palatine, Rue Garanci√©re, 6th arrondissement. Built by Princess Anne Henriette of Bavaria in 1715.

Paris Fountains of the Consulate and the First Empire (1799-1815)  Fontaine du Palmier, Place du Ch√¢telet, (1st arrondissement.) (1806-1808.), honoring Napoleon's victories. Fran√ßois-Jean Bralle, architect. The building of monumental fountains was interrupted by the French Revolution; the Place Louis XV was renamed Place de la Revolution, and the guillotine was placed near where the fountains were to have been built. The supply of water and the building of fountains became a subject of prime concern for the new First Consul, Napoleon Bonaparte, beginning in 1799.Katia Frey, L'enterprise napol√©onienne, in Paris et ses Fontaines, p. 104. Napoleon asked his Minister of the Interior, Jean-Antoine Chaptal, what would be the most useful thing he could do for Paris, and Chaptal replied, \\"Give it water.\\".Chaptal, Mes Souvenirs sur Napoleon, Paris, 1893, pp. 357-58, cited in L. Beaumont-Maillet, L'eau a Paris, Paris, 1991 p. 25, and in Philippe Cebron de Lisle, \\"Vers l'abondance\\", article in Paris et ses fontaines, p. 39. In 1802 Napoleon ordered the construction of the first canal bringing water from a river outside the city, the canal d'Ourcq. The canal was built by Napoleon's energetic Chief Engineer of Bridges and Highways and head of his service of water and sewers, Pierre Simon Girard, who had served with him on his campaign in Egypt. Girard's grand projects included the Canal Saint-Denis (finished in 1821), the Canal d'Ourcq (finished in 1822), the Canal Saint-Martin (finished in 1825) which brought enough water for both drinking fountains and decorative fountains.Philippe Cebron de Lisle, p. 40. While his engineers were building canals to bring water to Paris, Napoleon turned his attention to the fountains. In a decree issued May 2, 1806, he announced that it was his wish \\"to do something grand and useful for Paris.\\" and proposed building fifteen new fountains. He also ordered the cleaning, repair or rebuilding of the many old fountains which had fallen into ruin, such as the Fontaine des Quatre-Saisons and the Medici Fountain. His engineers built new fountains in the city's major outdoor markets, and installed several hundred bornes-fontaines, simple stone blocks with a water tap, all over the city. In 1812, he issued a decree that the distribution of water from fountains would be free, and anyone who speculated in drinking water would be severely punished. Many of the fifteen monumental fountains built by Napoleon were designed by the same architect, Fran√ßois-Jean Bralle, chief engineer of the water service for the City of Paris, who had worked on the big water pumps at Chaillot, Gros-Caillau and la Samaritaine. The early Napoleonic fountains, built before the canals were finished, were modest in scale and supplied with a limited amount of water, which poured through the traditional masquerons, or spouts. The later fountains by Napoleon, including the fountain in the Place de Vosges and the Chateau d'eau, were not used primarily for drinking water, and had water shooting into the air and cascading from the vasques into the basins below. These were the first truly decorative fountains in Paris.Dominique Massounie, La fontaine urbaine: le mod√®le Parisien, in the collection Paris et ses fontaines, pp. 160-162. *Fontaine place des Invalides. This fountain was one of the first completed under Napoleon, built to display the winged lion from the St. Mark's in Venice, brought to Paris as a war trophy by Napoleon in 1797. It was a simple stone pedastal with four small spouting bronze heads of lions, with the statue of the winged lion on top. The lion was returned to Venice after Napoleon's defeat in 1815, and the fountain was finally removed in 1840. *Fontaine Desaix. Located in Place Dauphine, this fountain honored the French general Louis Desaix, killed at the battle of Marengo in 1800. It featured a figure of La France Militaire, a woman in a toga and helmet, atop a cylindrical pedestal, with water pouring from spouts around the base. It was taken down when the square was enlarged in 1875 and moved to the city of Riom, Desaix's home, where it still stands.Katia Frey, L'enterprise napol√©onienne, article in Paris et ses fontaines, p. 109. *Fontaine du Palmier. (1808) In the Place du Ch√¢telet, this is the largest surviving fountain from the Empire, built in the form of a Roman triumphal column with the names of Napoleon's victories and bas reliefs on the column, with a statue of Victory on the top. The name comes from the palm-leaf decoration just below the statue. The base of the column is decorated with four figures representing Prudence, Vigilance, Justice and Strength. In 1856, when rue Sebastopol was built, the column was moved and placed on a new pedastal designed by G. Davioud, ornamented with four sphinxes and basins of water. *Fontaine de la Paix (1807) originally in Place St. Sulpice, then in March√© saint Germain, now in the Allee du Seminaire, not far away. A neo- classical monument in a square basin, with allegorical figures representing the sciences, the arts, peace, commerce, agriculture, and other figures. The statue was moved in 1937 to its present location. *Fontaine du Fellah, (1806), built against the wall of hospice des Incurables at 52 rue de S√®vres, was designed by Bralle to resemble an Egyptian temple, with a figure of Antinous, a favorite of the Roman Emperor Hadrian, in Egyptian costume, pouring water from two pitchers. It was designed to commemorate Napoleon's Egyptian campaign, and features an Imperial eagle above the statue. . *Fontaine du Palais des Arts (1809‚Äì1810). Four lions of cast iron, made by the sculptor Antoine Vaudoyer, were placed on separate pedastals in front of the Palais des Beaux-Arts, spouting water from their mouths into two basins. The fountain stopped working in 1865, and the lions were moved to the square of Boulogne- Billancourt, where they can be seen today. *Fontaine de Mars. This fountain is still in its original location on the rue Saint-Dominque, near the military hospital. It is ornamented with a bas-relief by sculptor Pierre Beauvallet of Mars, god of war, and Hygieia, goddess of health, cleanliness and sanitation, placed together because the statue was near the military hospital.Katia Frey, L'enterprise napoleonienne, p. 134. *Fontaine de L√©da. This fountain depicting Leda and the Swan, with water pouring from the beak of the swan, was made by sculptor Achille Valois. It originally stood at the corner of the rue du Regard and rue de Vaugirard. iT was moved in 1856 to the Jardin du Luxembourg, where it is attached to the Medici Fountain. *Chateau d'eau du boulevard Bondi (1812). This fountain, along with the fountains of Ponceau and those in the Place de Vosges, were the first fountains in Paris where the water itself was the chief decorative element, and the sculpture and architecture were secondary.Katia Frey, L'enterprise napoleonienne, p. 119. They were all designed by engineer Pierre Simon Girard. The Chateau d'eau was the first monumental fountain in Paris to feature two circular vasques, or stone basins, one above the other on a column, with water overflowing the basins and falling into a larger circular basin below. This design of fountain had existed on a small scale in Roman gardens and in Rome during the Renaissance, and in Aix- en-Provence, but not in Paris, and not on such a large scale. In addition to the central fountain, cast-iron lions spouted water into the lower basin. The novelty and scale of this fountain made it a popular promenade destination of Parisians. The fountain was moved in 1867, and today is located in front of the former Halle from the demolished Paris market of Les Halles located in la Villette. *Place des Vosges. (1811). A new fountain designed by Girard was built in the center of the Place des Vosges. It was one of the first in Paris, along with the chateau d'eau, without water taps to fill pitchers or jugs. It had an octagonal basin, with water spouting upwards and splashing into the basin. The originals by Girard were removed in 1824 and replaced in about 1830 with new fountains by Jean-Fran√ßois M√©nager.Katia Frey, L'Enterprise napol√©onienne, in Paris et ses fontaines, pp. 120 *Fontaine de l'elephant. The grandest of all Napoleonic fountains was begun in 1811, in the empty space where the Bastille had stood. Work began on the construction of a fountain in the form of a huge bronze elephant, with an observation platform on its back reached by a stairway inside the elephant. The basin for water base was constructed, along with a full-size plaster model of the elephant, but work stopped after the defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo in 1815. The model elephant was not removed until 1848.Katia Frey, L'Enterprise napol√©onienne, in Paris et ses fontaines, pp. 120-21.

Paris Fountains of the Restoration and the Reign of Louis-Philippe (1816‚Äì1848)  Fountain in the Place des Vosges, (4th arrondissement), The original fountain by Pierre Simon Girard in the Place des Vosges was replaced in 1830 by four fountains, designed by Jean-Fran√ßois- Julien M√©nager. the Fontaine du Cirque was placed in the new Gardens of the Champs-√âlys√©es by Hittorff shortly after he finished the Place de la Concorde. The four children on the fountain represent the four seasons. From the fall of Napoleon in 1815 to the coming to power of Louis Philippe in 1830, as France went through the Restoration of the old monarchy, few new fountains were built, and they were of modest size and artistic ambitions. Between 1813 and 1819 a new market, the march√© des Blancs-Manteaux, was constructed by the rue des Hospitaliers. The fountain in the meat market was adorned with bronze spouts in the shape of bull's heads by the sculptor Edme Gaulle. The market was demolished in 1910 but the heads still remain, now attached to the wall of an ecole maternelle.Beatrice LaMoitier, 1815-1830- Politique Modeste, Programmes Varie√©s, in Paris et ses fontaines. (pg. 167). Place des Vosges (1830). The original fountain by Pierre Simon Girard in the Place des Vosges (renamed la place Royale during the Restoration) was replaced in 1830 by the current four fountains, designed by Jean-Fran√ßois-Julien M√©nager, a student of Vaudoyer, winner of the prix de Rome, and architect of the City of Paris. The new fountains are made of volcanic stone from Volvic in the Auvergne, and have two circular vasques one above the other, with lions' heads spouting water into the circular basin. The Fontaine de Gaillon (1828) on the rue d'Antin (2nd arronidissement) was the first major fountain by Louis Visconti, which replaced an earlier fountain by Beausire. Visconti later became famous as the architect of the tomb of Napoleon in the Invalides. The fountain has two vasques, decorated with a young triton armed with a trident and a horse on a dolphin, and an inscription in Latin: \\"for the utility and ornament of the city.\\"Beatrice Moitier, op. cit. pg. 169 In July 1830 the absolute monarchy of Charles X was overthrown and replaced by the constitutional monarchy of Louis- Philippe. The new government, like earlier ones, faced the problem of a rapidly growing population in Paris, whose need for water was far greater than Napoleon's canal de l'Ourq could supply. Public fountains caused congestion in the narrow streets; carriage and wagon drivers watered their horses in the fountains; water porters fought with local residents for access to the water taps; the fountains in markets were used to wash vegetables and fruits and to clean the streets. A cholera epidemic in 1832 made it evident that Paris needed better water and better sanitation.Beatrice Lamoitier, L'Essor des fontaines monumentales, in Paris et ses fontaines. pg. 171. The new of the Seine, Rambuteau, ordered the construction of two hundred kilometers of new water pipes and the installation of 1700 borne-fontaines, the simple blocks with water taps introduced by Napoleon. Thanks to these new fountains, which supplied drinking water to the population, the city's architects had the freedom to design new monumental fountains that were purely ornamental in the city's squares. Fontaines de la Concorde. (1836‚Äì1840) The two fountains in the Place de la Concorde are the most famous of the fountains built during the time of Louis-Philippe, and came to symbolize the fountains of Paris. They were designed by Jacques-Ignace Hittorff, a student of the neoclassical sculptor Charles Percier at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts, who had served as the official Architect of Festivals and Ceremonies for the deposed King, and had spent two years studying the architecture and fountains of Italy. Hittorff's two fountains are both on maritime themes, because of their proximity to the Ministry of Navy on the Place de la Concorde, and to the Seine. Their arrangement, on a north‚Äìsouth axis aligned with the obelisque of Luxor, and the Rue Royale; and the form of the fountains themselves, were strongly influenced by the fountains of Rome, particularly Piazza Navona and the square of St. Peters. Both fountains have the same form: a stone basin; six figures of tritons or naiades holding fish spouting water; six seated allegorical figures, their feet on the prows of ships, supporting the piedouche, or pedestal, of the circular vasque; four statues of different forms of genius, arts or crafts supporting the upper inverted upper vasque; whose water shoots up and then cascades down to the lower vasque and then the basin. The north fountain is devoted to the Rivers, with allegorical figures representing the Rhone and the Rhine, the arts of the harvesting of flowers and fruits, harvesting and grape growing; and the geniuses of river navigation, industry, and agriculture. The south fountain, closer to the Seine, represents the seas, with figures representing the Atlantic and the Mediterranean; harvesting coral; harvesting fish; collecting shellfish; collecting pearls; and the geniuses of astronomy, navigation and commerce.Beatrice Lamoitier, pg. 173. Fontaines des Champs-√âlys√©es. (1839‚Äì1840). Having finished the fontaines de la Concorde, Hittorff built four additional fountains in the squares on the Champs-√âlys√©es between the Place de la Concorde and the Arc de Triomphe, which had just been finished in 1836. The lower part of each fountain is the same; a circular basin, a pedestal with seashell ornamentation; a vasque supported by dolphins and ornamented with palm leaves; and (on three of the four) lion heads spouting water. The upper part of each fountain was different; Carr√© des Ambassadeurs - a Venus brushing her hair, surrounded by roses and flowing water. (sculptor: Francique-Joseph Duret.) Carr√© le Doyen - statue of Diana with roses. (Sculptor: Louis Desprez) Fontaine de Cirque (north side): Four children, representing the four seasons, with a second vasque decorated with the heads of lions and wild boars. (Sculptor: Jean-Auguste Barre). Fontaine de l'Elys√©e (north side). A simple single vasque with cascading water. The Fontaine Louvois (1839), by architect Louis Visconti, was built in the new Place Louvois, on the site of the old opera house. The lower vasque is decorated with signs of the zodiac and masks of the seasons; four female figures representing the rivers Seine, Loire, Garonne and Sa√¥ne surround the column supporting the upper vasque. The figures and vasques were made of cast iron, painted to look like bronze. Fontaine Cuvier (1840‚Äì1846). Dedicated to Georges Cuvier (1769‚Äì1832), the naturalist, pioneer of paleontology and comparative anatomy. This fountain is located near the Jardin des Plantes and the museum of natural history, where Cuvier had worked. The statue is placed against a wall, with a low basin, water pouring from the heads of reptiles, and a band of human and animal heads. Above that is an allegorical figure of a seated woman representing Natural History, surrounded by numerous animals, and holding a tablet with Cuvier's motto: \\"Rerum cognoscere causas.\\" (\\"to know the causes of things.\\") Naturalists pointed out that the crocodile in the group of statues of is turning its head, something that crocodiles are unable to do.Beatrice Lamoitier, L'essor des fontaines monumentales, pg. 175. Visconti, who later became famous as the designer of the tomb of Napoleon in the Invalides, designed two other fountains of this new type, commemorating famous Parisians and located in places associated with them. Fontaine Moli√®re. (1841‚Äì44). This fountain by Visconti, located at the corner of rue Traversi√®re and rue Richelieu, was originally going to be a simple Renaissance fountain with a state of a nymph, but R√©gnier, the head of the Com√©die Fran√ßaise, proposed that it be instead a monument to the playwright Moli√®re, since the fountain was near the original site of the Com√©die Fran√ßaise and the home of Moli√®re. A public subscription raised money for the fountain. The bronze statue of Moli√®re is by Bernard-Gabriel Seurre, and the two allegorical figures at the base of the fountain, representing Light Comedy and Serious Comedy, are by James Pradier. Fontaine Saint-Sulpice, (1843‚Äì1848), by Louis Visconti was designed to represent the idea of religious elequence, since it was located on Place Saint-Sulpice, near the famous theological seminary of St. Sulpice. It honored four famous religious orators of the 17th century; Bossuet, F√©nelon, Fl√©chier, and Massillon. Fontaine de l'Archev√™che (1843‚Äì1845), by Alphonse Vigoureux, located on the present day square Jean XXIII, is a neo-Gothic structure built where the archbishop's palace once stood. The lower part of the fountain shows three archangels defeating the allegorical figure of heresy, while the spire contains a statue of the Virgin and child. Several more modest fountains from the time of Louis-Philippe still exist: *Fontaine Place Jean-Baptiste Cl√©ment', (1835), in Montmartre, is a wall fountain with a niche decorated with seashell pattern, and a bronze vase with water flowing from a lion's head. *Fontaine Charlemagne, rue Charlemagne, (1835), built against the wall of presbytere of the Church of St. Paul. In the niche, decorated with aquatic plants and animals, is a vasque of cast iron supported by dolphins, with a statue of a child holding a seashell over his head. *Fontaine Saint-Louis, rue de Tourenne. (1846). Similar to Fontaine Charlemagne, with vasque in the form of a seashell and a figure in zinc representing the Ourq River. The coat of arms of Paris is carved on the upper part of the fountain. The sculptor is Boitel, a pupil of James Pradier and David d'Angers. *Fontaine de la Roquette, rue de la Roquette, (1846), an arcade with a triangular fronton, decorated with the arms of Paris, dolphins, and fruit, floral patterns and lion heads. Inside the niche are two benches and a mascaron from which water still flows, though the fountain is closed with a gate.Beatrice Lamoitier, L'essor des fontaines monumentales, in Paris et ses Fontaines, pg. 178-179.

Paris Fountains of Louis-Napoleon and the second Empire (1848-1870)  Fontaine Saint-Michel, Place Saint-Michel, (1858-1860), Gabriel Davioud, architect. The reign of Louis-Philippe ended abruptly with the Revolution of 1848, and the establishment of the Second Republic, under Louis Napoleon, which became, by a coup d'√©tat in 1851, the Second Empire. After an epidemic of cholera in 1849, one of Louis Napoleon's highest priorities became improving the quality of the water of Paris. At the time Paris had about sixty fountains supplying drinking water for the population, and a dozen fountains which were purely ornamental.Beatrice LaMoitier, \\"Le r√®gne de Davioud\\", in Paris et ses fontaines, pg. 180 Under his new pr√©fet of the Seine, Baron Haussmann, and his new chief of the waters of Paris, Belgrand, the Paris water system was reconstructed so that water from springs, brought by aqueducts, was used exclusively for drinking water, while less healthy river water was used for washing the streets, watering gardens and parks, and for fountains. During the Second Empire, as Baron Haussmann launched his reconstruction campaign, famous old fountains were relocated and rebuilt. In 1858 the Fontaine des Innocents was moved to a new, lower pedestal in the middle of the square, and six basins of flowing water were added on each side., In 1864, to make room for the new boulevard des Medicis, the orangerie behind the Medici Fountain was demolished, the fountain was moved to a new location in the Jardin du Luxembourg, statues were added, the fountain of Leda and the Swan, built during the first Empire, was moved to a place behind it, and a long basin built in front of it. The modest original fountain in the Rond-Point of the Champs-√âlys√©es, built under Louis-Philippe, with just two vasques, was replaced by a larger fountain with six vasques cascading water. Most of the new monumental fountains built during the reign of Louis Napoleon were the work of a single architect, Gabriel Davioud. Davioud studied sculpture at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts, then became architect of the service de promenades et plantations of the prefecture of the Seine. He was responsible for the design of many of the squares, gates, benches, pavilions, and other decorative architecture of the Second Empire. His principal basins and fountains were: *Fontaines Boulevard Richard-Lenoir. (1862.) When part of the canal St. Martin was covered by the Boulevard Richard Lenoir, Davioud built a long series of fifteen small basins and fountains to aerate the water. Each fountain had a spray of water coming from a bouquet of roses made of cast iron. The fountains were rebuilt in a more modern, less picturesque style in the 20th century. * Fontaine Place Edmond-Rostand. Davioud built the basin and fountain first, in 1862. In 1884, the statue by Crauk of a triton and a naiade, holding a large seashell spraying water. was added to the fountain. *Fontaine de la place Pigalle. (1862-63.) The fountain has a circular basin, an octagonal pedestal and a fluted column supporting a single vasque. It was used by residents as a basin place to dump trash, to wash fish, and to do laundry. Today the fountain and place have been renovated. *Fontaine Square des Arts-et-Metiers (now called Square Emile-Chatemps) (1861). The fountain is composed of an oblong basin with semi-circular ends, in which are placed allegorical statues related to arts and professions, since the fountain was next to the conservatory of arts and metiers. On one side are two statues by Ottin, who also did the statues in the Medici Fountain; a statue of Mercury, holding a scale, an anchor, and a horn of plenty; and Music, wearing a laurel wreath, holding a lyre and a torch. On the other end of the fountain are two statues by Gumery; Agriculture, holding sheaves of wheat, and Work, holding a hammer. Between the two groups is a single vasque fountain with a spray of water and water pouring from the heads of lions. *Fontaine place de la Madeleine (1865). (one now located in square Santiago-du-Chili, the other to place Fran√ßois Iier). Davioud built two fountains in front of the Madeleine church, each with a circular marble basin, a pedestal with four griffins, supporting a column with a single vasque decorated with lion heads spouting water. From the vasque rises a column decorated with rings and faces of women. In 1902 both fountains were moved to different parts of Paris to make room for a statue of philosopher and politician Jules Simon. *Fontaine Saint-Michel (1860) is the best-known fountain of Davioud. Built as part of Baron Haussmann's grand project for the reconstruction of Paris, it was intended be the chief ornament of the enlarged Place Pont-Saint-Michel created by the new boulevard Sebastopol-rive gauche, now Boulevard Saint-Michel). Davioud originally wanted a free-standing fountain with a statue of a woman representing peace, but he was required to make a wall fountain hiding the wall of a building at the corner of boulevard Saint-Michel and Saint-Andr√© des Arts. His new design featured a structure like a triumphal arch with a statue of Napoleon Bonaparte, but this aroused opposition by the opponents of Louis Napoleon, so it was changed to a statue of the Archangel Michael wrestling with the devil. Nine sculptors worked on the different figures in the composition. It was the last monumental fountain in Paris built against a wall, a style that had been borrowed from Italy and used in the Medici Fountain and the Fontaine des Quatre-Saisons. Later fountains would be free-standing, in the center of squares or parks.Dominique Jarass√©, La fontaine Saint-Michel, Le classicism controvers√©, Archives d'architecture moderne, 1982, number 22, pgs. 80-87.  Paris Fountains of the Third Republic (1870-1900)  Fontaine de l'Observatoire, (1867-1874), Jardin du Luxembourg, Gabriel Davioud, architect. Louis Napoleon was captured by the Germans at the disastrous battle of Sedan in 1870 and lost his title. After the occupation of Paris by the Germans and the brief rule of the Paris Commune, the Third French Republic was born. Davioud remained as the chief architect of fountains for the city. His first task was to repair the damage caused to the fountains by the German siege of Paris and the fighting during the suppression of the Paris Commune, which had destroyed the Tuilieries Palace and the Hotel de Ville. Davioud was able to complete two monumental fountains begun under the Second Empire. *The Fontaine de l'Observatoire, with sculpture by Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux. This fountain had been proposed in 1866 as part of the creation of the new grand avenue du Luxembourg, a project which called the creation of two new squares, with ornamental lamps and columns, statues, and a fountain. Carpeaux had made the sculptures of La Danse on the facade of the Paris Opera; these had caused a scandal because of the free expression of the sculpture and the unrestrained emotions on the faces of the statues, much different from the calm expressions of neo-classical statues. Davioud instructed Carpeaux not to block he view of the Luxembourg Palace or the Paris Observatory, but otherwise he had freedom to design what he wanted. He proposed four figures representing the four corners of the world, holding aloft a celestial sphere, and trying to turn it. The sculptor LeGrain was commissioned to make the sphere, and the sculptor Emmanuel Fr√©mier made the horses in the basin around the statue. Work on the fountain was stopped because of the war in 1870, but resumed in 1872, and it was dedicated in 1874. *Fontaine du Triomphe de la R√©publique, Place de la Nation, (1899). In 1879, the place Ch√¢teau d'Eau was renamed place de la R√©publique, and a competition was held for a monument in the center. The architect Fran√ßois-Charles Morice and his sculptor brother Leopold won the competition, but a project by another sculptor, Aim√©-Jules Dalou, won the most public favor. Dalou had participated in the Paris Commune uprising in 1871 and had been sentenced to forced labor for life, then exiled to London. He designed a twelve-meter high group of allegorical statues: at the base is the Chariot of the Nation was drawn by two lions, led by the Spirit of Liberty and surrounded by figures representing Law, Work, Justice, Peace, and the Spirit of Instruction. A terrestrial globe supports the figure of the Republique, a woman in classical costume, wearing a liberty cap and holding the fasces, the Roman symbol of the law.Daniel Imbert, Jules Dalou et le Triomphe de la Republique, catalog of Exposition Quand Paris dansait avec Marianne 1879-1889, Petit Palais, 1989. The Prefecture instructed Davioud to replace the old fountain of the Place du Tr√¥ne with the Dalou's monument in the renamed Place de la Nation. The statues were cast in bronze, A basin was rebuilt, and the fountain opened in 1899. Later, in 1908, six bronze amphibian animals spouting water sculpted by Georges Gardet were added to the basin. The bronze statues of the amphibians were taken by the Germans during World War II and disappeared. The basin was removed in the 1960 to make way for the RER regional railway station, but the statues, without basin or water, are still there.Beatrice Lamoitier, Entre innovation et tradition, in Paris et ses fontaines, pg. 187-88. *Fontaines place Andr√© Malraux (formerly Place du Th√©atre-Fran√ßaise.)

File:Place Andr√© Malraux (View north towards Op√©ra), Paris, France.jpgPlace Andr√© Malraux showing the two fountains. Davioud built this fountain in the new place, created in 1867, which marked the beginning of the new avenue de l'Op√©ra, which connected the city's most famous theater with the opera house. The project was begun in 1867, but was interrupted by the war and not finished until 1874. According to Davioud's plan, two fountains were built. Each has a circular stone basin; a base of gray marble with four seated children in bronze; a bronze vasque; a pi√©douche, or column, of white marble with medallions with the seal of city, and water spouting from the top; and, at the top of the Piedouche, a river nymph at the top of the fountain nearest the theater, and a sea nymph at the top of the second fountain. The sea nymph sculpture is by Albert-Ernest Carrier-Belleuse and the four children at the base by Louis-Adolphe Eude; the river nymph was made by Mathurin Moreau, and the four children at the base by Charles Gauthier.Beatrice Lamoitier, Paris et ses Fontaines, page 188 *Wallace fountain. In 1872 a British millionaire, temperance advocate and philanthropist, Sir Richard Wallace, who had spent much of his youth in Paris and had lived there during the 1870 war, recognizing the difficulty and cost of finding drinking water in Paris after the 1870 war, and following a program he had already begun in London, donated fifty cast-iron drinking fountains to the city of Paris. The sculptor of the fountains was Charles-Auguste Lebourg, a student of Fran√ßois Rude. He designed two models, one free-standing and the other to be attached to a wall, and in 1881, added a third, simpler version. The fountains were a popular success, and new ones were still being installed until the beginning of the First World War.Elie Frebault, Les fontaines de sir Richard Wallace, l'Illustration, August 17, 1872, pg. 103-105.

Paris Exposition Fountains (1855-1937)  The \\"'Theatre d'eau\\" from the 1931 Colonial Exposition presented a performance of dancing water, changing shape and color. It was the ancestor of the modern musical fountain. The \\"Pont d'eau' from the 1931 Paris Colonial Exhibit, a \\"bridge\\" of water over Lake Daumesnil forty meters long and six meters wide. This was the first fountain purely composed of water, with no architectural element, the ancestor of the Jet d'eau in Geneva created twenty years later. Eight universal expositions took place in Paris between 1855 and 1937, and each included fountains, both for decoration and for sale, which demonstrated the latest in technology and artistic styles. They introduced illuminated fountains, fountains which performed with music, fountains made of glass and concrete, and modern abstract fountains to Paris. The first such exposition, organized in 1855 by Louis Napoleon in response to the huge success of the Universal Exposition in London in 1851, displayed cast-iron fountains, on the model of the Fontaine to Louvois of Visconti, which could be purchased by any town or city.Virginie Grandval, Fontaines √©ph√©m√©res, in Paris et ses fontaines, pg. 209-247 *The Exposition Universelle of 1867 took place in the Champs-de-Mars and across the river at the Trocadero. For the Exposition, Baron Haussmann created a large basin, filled with water pumped by the Seine, to be used for fountains. Artificial rocks and grottos were built in the Champs-de-Mars, with cascading water, ponds and streams. Two monumental fountains were also built, at each end of the Pont d'I√©na, which was the ceremonial entrance of the exhibit. The most spectacular fountain in the exhibit was a crystal fountain, 7.3 meters high, with two vasques 3.1 meters in diameter, made by the firm of Baccarat. Only drawings remain of the crystal fountain. *The Exposition Universelle of 1878. For this exposition, the first held during the new Third Republic, a ch√¢teau d'eau with a grotto, upper basin and fountains, a series of cascades, and a lower basin with fountains were built on the slopes of Chaillot, at the foot of the Palais du Trocadero, at the present site of the fountains of the Trocadero. The basins were surrounded by six gilded cast iron sculptures of animals representing the six continents. (These statues are now located on the parvis of the Mus√©e d'Orsay.).The fountains and cascades no longer exist, but a very close copy does exist, at the Palais Longchamps in Marseille. *The Exposition Universelle of 1889 celebrated the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution. Its most memorable feature was the Eiffel Tower, and it took place, like the previous exhibit, on the Champs-de-Mars and the Trocadero. A highlight of the exposition was a fountain illuminated by electric lights shining up though the columns of water, a method first developed in England in 1884. The fountains, located in a basin forty meters in diameter, were given color by plates of colored glass inserted over the lamps. The Fountain of Progress gave its show three times each evening, for twenty minutes, with a series of different colors. The system was primitive; it could only illuminate the water up to a height of four meters - but the effect was new and dramatic and extremely popular.Virginie Grandval, pg. 223. *The Exposition Universelle of 1900 was held both at the Champs-de-Mars and next to the Champs-√âlys√©es, where a Grand and Petit Palais were constructed. One of its most popular features was the Temple of Electricity, near the Champs-√âlys√©es, which had a series of illuminated fountains in front, with lamps shining blue, white and red light. The innovation of 1900 was a keyboard which allowed a rapid series of different colors. But by 1900 electricity was no longer a novelty, and the lighted fountains did not have the same effect that they did in 1889. It was agreed by critics that something new was needed for the 20th century fountain.Virginie Grandval, pg. 229 *The Exposition Internationale of 1925. This exhibit introduced the first fountains made of modern materials and in the modernist aret styles of the 20th century. The fountain by sculptor Gabriel Guevrekian was composed of four triangular basins, colored blue or red, and a fountain of glass in the center, surrounded by triangles of grass and flowers. It was the first fountain in Paris composed like a cubist painting. The most original fountain in the exposition was Les Sources et les Rivieres of France, made by Ren√© Lalique. It was a column of glass five meters high, made up of 128 caryatids of glass, each with a different decoration and size, each spraying a thin stream of water into the fountain below. At night the column was illuminated from within, and could change color. It was placed on a cross of concrete covered with decorated plates of glass, and in an ocagonal basin also decorated with colored and black tiles of glass.VIrginie Grandval, Fontaines √©ph√©m√®res, pg. 233. *'Colonial Exposition of 1931. This exhibit, designed to showcase France's overseas empire, was held in the eastern part of Paris, at the edge of the Bois de Vincennes, and it expressed two themes; the exoticism of France's distant colonies, and the modernism of France. New technologies shown at the exhibit included neon lights, indirect lighting of building facades (tested on Notre Dame Cathedral, the Place de la Concorde, and the Arc de Triomphe,) and eight monumental modern illuminated fountains. *The cactus was a metal structure 17 meters high and 16 meters in diameter, with a dozen long branches reaching from the top the ground. Water poured from the top down the branches, and jetted out from the branches to the basin below. The whole structure was illuminated with white light. *The Th√©√¢tre d'eau, or water theater, located on one side of the lake, covering an arc of a circle of about 80 meters, created a performance of dancing water, forming changing bouquets, arches, and curtains of water from its jets and nozzles. It was the ancestor of the modern musical fountain. *The pont d'eau was made by jets of water from both sides of Lake Daumesnil, which formed an illuminated water \\"bridge\\" forty meters long and six meters wide. This was the first fountain made entirely of water, with no architectural element; the ancestor of the Jet d'eau in Lake Geneva, created twenty years later.Virginie Granval, Fontaines √©ph√©m√®res, pg. 233. *The Exposition Internationale of 1937, the last exhibit of its kind, was held at the Trocadero and the Champs-de- Mars, and once again the fountains were the highlight. Water jets were placed on both sides of the Seine, with a range of 25 meters, and 174 other fountains placed under the surface of the river. The choreography of the fountains was combined with light, and, for the first time, with music, amplified from eleven rafts with loudspeakers in the river. The music featured compositions by the leading modern composers of the period, including Igor Stravinsky, Darius Milhaud, and Arthur Honegger. The cascades, fountains and basins of the Trocadero, built for the 1878 exposition, were completely rebuilt for the 1937 exposition. Two monumental statues, Apollon by Henri Bouchard and Hercule by Albert Pommier, were placed on the esplendade above the fountains. The main feature was a long basin, or water mirror, with twelve fountain creating columns of water 12 meters high; twenty four smaller fountains four meters high; and ten arches of water. At one end, facing the Seine, were twenty powerful water cannon, able to project a jet of water fifty meters. Above the long basin were two smaller basins, linked with the lower basin by casades flanked by 32 sprays of water four meter high, in vasques. These fountains are the only exposition fountains which still exist today, and still function as they did. The exhibit also featured two more unusual fountains; a fountain in the Spanish pavilion by Alexander Calder, the Fontaine de Mercure, where a small metal structure created a flow of mercury, and a fountain of wine, imitating one once created for Louis XIV at Versailles.

Louis Madeleine, architect, Leon Drivier, sculptor. Paris fountains in the 20th century no longer had to supply drinking water - they were purely decorative; and, since their water usually came from the river and not from the city adqueducts, their water was no longer drinkable. Twenty-eight new fountains were built in Paris between 1900 and 1940; nine new fountains between 1900 and 1910; four between 1920 and 1930; and fifteen between 1930 and 1940.Figures cited by Pauline Prevost- Marcilhacy, Doctor of the History of Art at the University of Paris IV- Sorbonne, in her essay on fountains, 1900-1940- Entre tradition et modernit√©, in Paris et ses fontaines, pg. 257. The removal of the ring of fortifications around Paris created space for many new parks and squares. Most of the new fountains were located in parks and other green spaces, and most were modest in scale. The biggest fountains of the period were those built for the International Expositions of 1900, 1925 and 1937, and for the Colonial Exposition of 1931. Of those, only the fountains from the 1937 exposition at the Palais de Chaillot still exist. (See section above on Exposition fountains.) The form of the classic Paris fountain of the 19th century, with a single or double circular vasque, nearly vanished during the 20th century. replaced by a wide variety of styles and new materials. They ranged from neo- classical styles to a glass fountain made by Ren√© Lalique for the Rond-Point des Champs-√âlys√©es (no longer existing). Several fountains were created to showcase statues made for other purposes, such as the statue \\"France brings peace and prosperity to the colonies\\", by sculptor Leon Drivier, originally atop the Palace of Colonies of the 1931 Colonial Exposition, which, after the exhibit closed, was moved to be the centerpiece of a new fountain, the Fontaine de Madeline, in place Eduouard Renard. The subject matter of the new fountains also varied widely: there is a fountain honoring composer Claude Debussy (The Fontaine Debussy, Place Debussy, 1932); a fountain honoring the engineer who discovered the first artesian well in Paris (The Fontaine George Mulot, on the location of the first artesian well on Rue Grenelle): a fountain for writer Leo Tolstoy; ; a fountain honoring Emile Lavassor, the driver who won first Paris-Bordeaux automobile race in 1895; (Fontaine Lavassor, Porte Maillot; and two fountains in the 16th arrondissement devoted to love; the Fontaine des Amours in the Bagatelle garden (1919) and the Fountain de l'Amour, l'Eveil a la vie. (the awakening of life) in Place de la Porte d'Auteil.Prevost-Marcilhacy, pg. 260. The notable fountains of the pre-war period include, in chronological order: *Fontaine Levassor, Porte Maillot, 16th arrondissement ((1907). Jules Daulou and Lefevre, sculptors. The fountain honors √©mile Levassor, the winner of the 1895 Paris to Bordeaux automobile race, and is the only fountain in Paris with a bas-relief of an automobile. *Fontaine des Amours de Bagatelle, Parc-de-Batagelle, 16th arrondissement, (1919). Raymond Sudre, sculptor. *The Chateau d'eau in Place Jean-Baptiste- Clemente at the foot of the butte of Montmartre, 18th arrondissement (1932.) Paul Gasq, sculptor. *The Fontaine Debussy, in Square Debussy. 16th arrondissement (1932), by sculptors Jan and Joel Martel, and Jean Burkhalter, architect. *Fontaine Tolstoi, Square Leon Tolstoi, 16th arrondissement (1934). Cassou, sculptor. *Fontaine de la Porte Dor√©e, Place Edouard-Renard, 12th arrondissement (1935). Sculpture by Leon Drivier, Louis Madeline, architect. The fountain was built to showcase the statue, France the Colonizer, which had stood at the entrance of the Paris Colonial Exposition of 1931. *Fontaine Steinlen, Square Constantin-Pecquier, 18th arrondissement (1936). Paul Vannier, sculptor. *The Fontaines de la Porte de Saint-Cloud, Place Port de Saint-Cloud, 16th arrondissement (1936). Paul Landowski, sculptor, and Robert Pommier and Jacques Billiard, architects. The monumental fountains were made to fill a vast square created in 1926 for a tramway and railway station and meeting point of seven avenues, where the old gates and fortifications of the city had been. The central features were two cylindrical columns, fifteen meters high, spouting water and covered with bas-reliefs, and illuminated at night, designed to serve as a symbolic entrance to the city. Their creator, the sculptor Paul Landowski, wrote, \\"these are the first fountains in Paris in which the effects of light, architecture and sculpture were joined from the very beginning.\\"cited in Pauline Prevost-Marcilhacy, 1900-1940, Entre tradition et modernit√©, essay in Paris et ses Fontaines, pg. 264. *Fontaines de Trocad√©ro and Fontaines de Varsovie on the Esplenade and in the gardens of the Palais de Trocad√©ro, (1937), built for the 1937 International Exposition. (see Exposition Fountains above.) The pumping room under the fountain basin was renovated between 2010 and 2011, and the fountain fully functions as it previously did. *L'Accueil de Paris, Femme au Bain in Square de la Butte-du- Chapeau-Rouge, 19th arrondissement (1938.) The architect was L√©on Az√©ma, city architect, who created a series of new squares and parks where the old city fortifications had been. The sculpture, by Raymond Couvegnes, had been featured at the 1937 International Exposition.

Jean-Yves Lechevallier Polypores Fountain. Jean-Yves Lechevallier Only a handful of fountains were built in Paris between 1940 and 1980. The most important ones built during that period were on the edges of the city, on the west, just outside the city limits, at La Defense, and to the east at the Bois de Vincennes. Between 1981 and 1995, during the terms of President Fran√ßois Mitterrand and Culture Minister Jack Lang, and of Mitterrand's bitter political rival, Paris Mayor Jacques Chirac (Mayor from 1977 until 1995), the city experienced a program of monumental fountain building that exceeded that of Napoleon Bonaparte or Louis Philippe. More than one hundred fountains were built in Paris in the 1980s and 1990s, mostly in the neighbourhoods outside the centre of Paris, where there had been few fountains before.Andr√© Hoffman, La cr√©ation contemporaine, in Paris et ses fontaines. Pg. 266, The Fountain Cristaux by Jean-Yves Lechevallier in the new Front de Seine district, the Stravinsky Fountain, the Fountain of the Pyramid of the Louvre, the Buren Fountain and Les Sph√©rades fountain in the Palais-Royal, the Fontaine du Parc Andre-Citroen, the Polypores fountain and new fountains at Les Halles, the Jardin de Reuilly, and beside the Gare Maine-Montparnasse were all built under President Mitterrand and Mayor Chirac. The Mitterrand-Chirac fountains had no single style or theme. Many of the fountains were designed by famous sculptors or architects, such as Jean Tinguely, I.M. Pei, Claes Oldenburg and Daniel Buren, who had radically different ideas of what a fountain should be. Some of them, like the Pyramide de Louvre fountain, had glistening sheets of water; while in the Buren Fountain in the Palais-Royal, the water was invisible, hidden under the pavement of the fountain. Some of the new fountains were designed with the help of noted landscape architects and used natural materials, such as the fountain in the Parc Floral in the Bois de Vincennes by landscape architect Daniel Collin and sculptor Fran√ßois Stahly. Some were solemn, and others were whimsical. Most made little effort to blend with their surroundings - they were designed to attract attention.Andr√© Hoffman, La cr√©ation contemporaine, in Paris et ses fontaines. Pg. 266. President Mitterrand and Culture Minister Lang were closely involved in many of the projects they commissioned. Mitterrand personally selected the architect of the Louvre project, and Lang negotiated the design of the Stravinsky Fountain with the sculptors, reducing the number of colorful \\"nanas\\" by Niki de Saint- Phalle from two to one.Arnauld Pierre, La fontaine Stravinsky, in Paris et ses Fontaines.pg. 279. Many of the fountains were built thanks to a change in the law for public financing of works of art, which required that one percent of the budget for the construction of a public building in Paris be devoted to artistic decoration. This law, originally passed in the 1930s, was extended in the 1980s so that the funding could be used to build art works in the squares and other public areas around the new building. The law was also amended so that the one percent applied to the Grand Projects of the Head of State, which allowed the construction of the fountains near the Pyramid of the Louvre. A special fund, called the Le Fonds de la Commande Publique de l'√âtat, was established to fund new works by living artists. This fund paid for the Daniel Buren fountain in the courtyard of the Palais Royale, and the 'Bicyclettte ensevelie\\" by Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen, and Horloges by the sculptor Arman, located in the Park of the Cite of Sciencds and Industry at La Villette. Several new parks were constructed during this period with fountains as their centrepieces. These included the Parc de Belleville (1988), the historic source of the Paris water supply since the 12th century, where a new park was built, with a flowing stream, cascades, and water stairways, along with two basins with jetting fountains; and Parc Andr√© Citro√´n (1992), on the banks of the Seine in the 15th arrondissement, on the site of the former automobile factory, where a series of thematic gardens were created by architects Patrick Berger, Jean-Paul Viguier and Jean-Fran√ßois Joddry and landscape architects Alain Provost and Gilles Cl√©ment. These different fountains shaped water into columns, mirrors and canals, decorated with modern versions of classical peristyles and nympheums. The old produce markets of Paris, Les Halles, were the site of another new garden with fountains (1988) by architect Louis Arretche, Jean Willerval Pierre Mougin. The Jardins de Reuilly (1992) by Pierre Colboc, were built along the Avenue Daumesnil. with water shaped into canals along the pedestrian paths, inspired by gardens in Andalusia. A new park, the Jardin Atlantique, was built in 1994 on the concrete slab that covers the railway lines of the train station Gare Maine- Montparnasse. This included three modern fountains, the Fontaine des Humidit√©s, the Fontaine des Miroitements, and Fontaine des Hesp√©rides, by architects Christine Schnitzler and Fran√ßois Brun, along with landscape architect Michel Pena, which added water and greenery into an urban space surrounded by huge concrete buildings. Other new fountains were highly original and personal visions of the artists who created them: The Fontaine de l'Embacle (1984), in Place du Qu√©bec, across from the church of Saint-Germain- des-Pr√©s, by the sculptor Daudelin and architect Alfred Gindre, represents a spring bursting through the pavement, pushing up the paving stones, and then pouring back into the earth. The fountain called Canyoneaustrate (1988) in front of the Palais Omnisport at Bercy, by the sculptor Singer, shows a giant crevice in the earth, similar to the canyons of the American west, with water cascading down into the canyon to return to its source. Deux Plateaux in the courtyard of the Palais-Royal by minimalist sculptor Daniel Buren, does not look like a fountain at all. A group of columns with black and white vertical stripes are arranged in a courtyard, and water flows beneath them, seen, except through a grill in the pavement, as if at the bottom of a well. The largest of the new fountains is Le Creuset du temps (1988) by sculptor Shamai Haber, in the Place de Catalogne behind the Montparnasse train station. It features a gigantic disc, slightly inclined, covered with thousands of granite paving stones in concentric circles, over which water gently flows.  Paris fountains since 2000  Few new fountains have been built in Paris since 2000. The most notable is La Danse de la fontaine emergente, located on Place Augusta-Holmes, rue Paul Klee, in the 13th arrondissement. It was designed by the French-Chinese sculptor Chen Zhen, shortly before his death in 2000, and finished by his widow and collaborator Xu Min in 2008. It shows a dragon, in stainless steel, glass and plastic, emerging and submerging from the pavement of the square. Water under pressure flows through the transparent skin of the dragon.

It is now preserved and runs on the Amberley Museum Railway.  Groudle Glen Railway  The Groudle Glen Railway on the Isle of Man is a gauge tourist railway opened in 1896. It was originally worked by a single locomotive supplied by W.G. Bagnall, called Sea Lion. The railway proved popular, and in 1905 a second, slightly larger version of the same design was ordered from Bagnall. This locomotive was named Polar Bear. From 1905 onwards, Sea Lion and Polar Bear worked all the trains on the railway. The railway was closed between 1915 and 1918. The two Bagnalls were taken out of service in the 1920s, when they were replaced by a pair of battery locomotives. The electric locomotives quickly wore out, and Polar Bear and Sea Lion were returned to traffic. The railway was closed for the duration of World War II and, when the line reopened in the late 1940s, only Polar Bear was returned to traffic. The Groudle Glen Railway closed in 1962.  Preservation  Polar Bear was sold to the Brockham Museum Trust in 1967. In 1982 it passed, with the rest of the Brockham collection, to the Amberley Museum Railway, where it was returned to traffic in 1983. Polar Bear's boiler was condemned around 1988, returning to service with a new boiler in 1993. Its boiler certificate expired at the end of 2010; with a retube and work on the firebox being required before a return to service. Since being based at Amberley, Polar Bear has returned to the Groudle Glen on three occasions (1993, 1996 and 2005) to visit. Polar Bear was stripped down for overhaul in early 2011. The boiler was moved to Chatham for overhaul, with mechanical work being undertaken in-house at Amberley. The boiler was returned to Amberley in January 2012. Polar Bear was relaunched on 13 July 2013 by BBC newsreader and railway enthusiast Nicholas Owen. Polar Bear made its fourth visit to the Groudle Glen Railway since it was preserved in late July 2016. After its two week stay there, it returned home to Amberley museum.  Brown Bear  In January 2013 the Groudle Glen Railway announced a plan to construct a new locomotive to be named Brown Bear. Brown Bear will be built using the original Bagnall drawings for Polar Bear (Works No. 1781 of 1905) which have largely survived. Once the locomotive is complete it will operate alongside its older sister Sea Lion allowing the railway to accurately represent period from 1905 through until the outbreak of the Second World War when these diminutive locomotives would have been in service together daily during the busy summer months. Polar Bear was an updated and more powerful version of Sea Lion incorporating a number of modifications. Some of these such as the change from Baguley's modified valve gear to Bagnall Price gear can be put down to changes in key personnel at W.G Bagnall's but others such as the larger diameter cylinders, increased grate area and increased driving wheel diameter were probably specified in light of 9 years experience with Sea Lion in service. The most obvious visible difference between the two locomotives of course is the change from round to rectangular spectacle plates in the front cab sheet which improved the forward vision for the driver. As Polar Bear was the last locomotive ordered by the original railway company and is arguably a more advanced design Brown Bear will be built as close as modern manufacturing techniques will allow to Polar Bear‚Äôs design. The original locomotives made extensive use of cast components and while the new build will use castings where patterns are already available some one-off components will be fabricated. Working on the assumption that major components will be manufactured off site by a series of specialist firms before coming together for final assembly at Groudle the total cost of the build is expected to be in the region of ¬£50,000.00 with completion expected within 5 years  References  Category:Groudle Glen Railway Category:Preserved narrow gauge steam locomotives of Great Britain Category:2 ft gauge locomotives ","title":"Polar Bear (locomotive)"},{"id":"23898865","text":"The Business of Dying is the first novel written by Simon Kernick.

Dennis Milne and his friend Danny are waiting at the Traveler's Rest Hotel car park to kill three unarmed men they think are drug dealers. A black Jeep Cherokee drives into the car park and comes to a halt. Milne goes up to the driver's side and shoots two of the men dead. The third tries to get out of the car and run, but does not make it. Milne is seen by a girl at the back door of the hotel, but he just walks away. They drive away and when they are away from the scene they set the car on fire and go their separate ways. Milne is stopped at a roadblock by the police. He has to show his ID and it turns out he is a police officer. At home he acts normal and starts a new case on a murder of a prostitute. Through the news, he finds out that he killed two customs officers and an accountant. Raymond Keen, who hired Milne to do the kill, he says they did something terrible and had to die for it, but does not say what it was. It gets worse when the police working on the hotel killing show an efit of Milne. Danny calls him to say he was being followed but Milne does not think anything of it and says he should go on a holiday. While trying to question a woman on the prostitute case, thinking that it might be involved in what is going on, she runs away. He chases her but she gets away and he is left by himself. Two people with hoodies walk up the street towards him. They have guns and try to kill him. After a chase, he kills one and hurts the other. He finds out who killed the hooker and wraps him up in a chair and tortures him to talk before setting him on fire. He goes to Keen's house and kills his guards after almost being killed by them and shoots Keen and makes him talk. At the end of the book he is flying off to the Philippines with a fake passport and a different appearance.

Design The replica Annie was built by Richard Booth to the design of a Bagnall class 'E' 0-4-2T tank locomotive named Annie which was built in 1911 and shipped to New Zealand to operate the Gentle Annie Tramway near Gisborne. The original Annie later ended up at a quarry at Motuhora along with another Bagnall engine from the Gentle Annie Tramway, and was buried on the site by a landslide in the late-1950s/early 1960s. Dug up in the late 1970s, the remains of Annie passed through several owners, and are now owned by the East Coast Museum of Technology at Makaraka near Gisborne, who have prepared what remains of the engine for static display. The replica Annie was constructed based upon working drawings; mechanically identical to Polar Bear but with a 0-4-2 wheel arrangement. The cylinder mould was obtained from the Bennett Brook Railway in Australia, where another replica Annie had been built. The two replicas are both 2' (610mm) gauge whereas the original Annie was built to run on 2' 6\\" (762mm) gauge tracks. Construction The locomotive was built locally and at the time of construction was the island's newest steam locomotive, having been completed in 1998 and officially launched as part of the Steam 125 event that year. Since this time two new steam locomotives have been provided for the Laxey Mines Railway making them the newest locomotives on the island, although the volunteers at Groudle Glen Railway are currently in the process of building Brown Bear, a replica of the railway's 1905 locomotive Polar Bear which they aim to have in service by 2018. Components The locomotive has carried a number of steam whistles/hooters since entering service, with as many as three carried at any one time. Despite having been \\"built from scratch\\", the locomotive can claim some original components - the water tank lid on one of the side tanks is in fact an original one from Sea Lion, new ones having been fabricated as part of her 1987 rebuild. Livery The locomotive carries a deep tuscan red livery, the same as that carried by Manx Northern Railway locomotive Caledonia upon her return to service in 1995, with the notable difference that Annie carried a black/yellow lining out scheme whereas Caledonia carries a more intricate vermilion lining with gold leaf detailing. Service Together with Sea Lion she provides the main traction on the Groudle Glen Railway and can be seen in service at summer weekends on the line as well as some evenings in peak season and various out of season special services, notably the popular annual Santa Trains. She has been out of service since Easter 2013 for a rebuild which includes new cylinders, works to her side tanks and a new livery. She's expected back in regular service during the 2014 summer season.

Early career Three similar locomotives were in 1952 by the Hunslet Engine Company for Robert Hudson (explaining the unusual manufacturers' title which appears prominently, cast into the locomotive's radiator frontage). They were built to run in a sand and gravel pit in Twickenham and did so until closure, after which the three were put up for sale. This pair were purchased by Doddington Park in Chipping Sodbury where a pleasure ground had been established. It was at this time that the locomotives acquired a \\"steam outline\\" structure. This consisted of a sheet metal half-cab with oval windows, false dome and chimney. The exhaust from the engine which had previously been directed beneath the frames was re-routed to be shot from this new chimney to give the appearance that the engine was \\"steaming\\" along. Walrus was given the name the \\"Doddington Dragon\\" at this time and heraldic crests added to the side panels. By 1980 the park was suffering losses and was closed, the locomotives, carriages and all trackwork were put up for sale. To Groudle Glen When restoration of the Groudle Glen Railway began in 1982 the locomotives were purchased from the park together with all the rails, sleepers and associated pointwork, arriving on the Isle of Man shortly thereafter. In line with previous naming policy (the original locomotives had been named Sea Lion and Polar Bear as these animals were features of the zoo in the glen) the volunteers of the Isle of Man Steam Railway Supporters' Association named Dolphin (fleet number \\"1\\") and Walrus (fleet number \\"2\\"). This was the first time fleet numbers had been given to locomotives on the railway. Both locomotives were given a green livery and wooden nameplates, and until the return of Sea Lion in 1987, provided all the motive power for the line's public operations and permanent way trains. The locomotives are retained today and perform shunting duties and winter works train duties regularly. Livery and maintenance Walrus is identifiable from her sister as she retains her false dome (actually half a gas cylinder welded to the cladding), and sports dummy side tanks; other than these visible features she is largely identical to Dolphin in all but livery. Dolphin is fitted with headlights, unlike her shedmate. In 2012 to mark the locomotives' 60th anniversary, they received new brass nameplates to replace the 1980s wooden nameplates which have subsequently been mounted for display in the Sea Lion Rocks Visitor Centre and the Lhen Coan Engine Shed. =Dolphin= Having carried the lighter green livery since arrival in 1983, it was in 1992 that she was re-painted into a darker brunswick green shade, then again in 1998 she received an unusual all-over grey livery (including buffers, side frames, cab interior, etc.) but this was short-lived and by the summer of 2001 a further full repaint saw the locomotive outshopped in a royal blue livery. All maintenance is carried out on site and the engine receives annual attention, alternating with Walrus each year. Although now largely relegated to works duties, it does appear in service occasionally as part of gala events each summer, and occasionally for the Santa Trains. It was this locomotive that was renamed Rudolph each yuletide between 1984 and 1997 at which time new nameplates denoting Blitzen were installed. These have, since 2003, been carried by Walrus instead. In 2012 she was stripped down and fully repainted back into her 1980's green livery to mark the 30th Anniversary of the railway's restoration by volunteers, in this guise she hauled public trains on the Special 30th Anniversary day in May. =Walrus= Having carried the lighter green livery since arrival in 1983, the locomotive was withdrawn in 1989 and the wheels removed for reprofiling and major engine work. Being surplus to requirements it was several years before this work was carried out and the locomotive lay on blocks in the back of the carriage shed at for many years. When the line had visiting locomotives in 1998 as part of the Steam 125 event, \\"Walrus\\" needed to be stored in the open to accommodate the visitors so the wheels were replaced at this time, and a coat of battleship grey paint applied to smarten her up. War Department transfers were also applied to the false tanks at this time. By 2003 interest had resurfaced (the 50th anniversary of the two the previous year having sparked interest), and over the winter the locomotive was overhauled and repainted into a maroon colour scheme with yellow features. It now operates on gala days and performs works train duties, shared with No.1 \\"Dolphin\\". Since returning to service she has been selected for standby duties on Santa Train days, and is renamed annually as \\"Blitzen\\" for the occasion.

Don Wauchope played an important role within the early growth of Scottish rugby and after retiring from international rugby he became a refereeBunny Wauchope Scrum.com and was the President of the Scottish Rugby Union. He was considered Scotland's outstanding half-back of the early 1880sGriffiths (1987), 2:5. and is credited as being one of the pioneers of modern half-back play.A.A. Thompson Unhistorical history of Rugby (1957), Chapter 2 Born into the Don- Wauchope Baronetcy, Don-Wauchope was an all-round sportsman, representing his school and then university in rugby and athletics. He was a prolific try scorer, scoring six tries in his international career, though as a try was not worth any points at the time his scoring record remains blank. Don-Wauchope was also a keen cricketer, he went on to represent Scotland, playing in the very first encounter between Scotland and Ireland in 1888.Andrew Ramsay Don- Wauchope profile CricketScotland.com Personal history Don-Wauchope was born in Bridgeton, Glasgow in 1861 to Sir John Don-Wauchope, 8th Baronet of Newton and Bethia Hamilton Buchanan. He was the second son of the Baronet, and the title passed onto his elder brother John Douglas when their father died in 1893. Don-Wauchope was educated at Fettes College before graduating to Trinity College, Cambridge in 1880. He graduated from Cambridge with a BA in 1884, and whilst at university he won sporting Blues in rugby and in athletics for hurdling. Don-Wauchope became a stock-broker by profession and in 1903 he married Emma Margaret Salmond, daughter of Sir William Salmond. By 1941 he had taken up residency in Saint-Briac-sur-Mer in France, and died in 1948 in Paris. Rugby Union career =Amateur career= Don-Wauchope first came to note as a rugby player while studying at Cambridge. He won two sporting Blues for rugby in 1880 and 1881, and captained the Cambridge University team. Whilst still at University, Don-Wauchope and A.R. Paterson of Loretto School organised the first meeting of the Fettesian-Lorettonian Club,Marshall (1892), pg 65. until then a loose collection of former school pupils that had played cricket together the previous season. The Club was founded in 1881, and Don- Wauchope became captain of the Fettesian-Lorettonian club. While at Cambridge, Don-Wauchope took his Fettesian-Lorettonian team, firstly on tours of Scotland, and then venturing into North England. After playing several games against more well founded Scottish teams, such as West of Scotland and Edinburgh Wanderers, the club faced English teams, Manchester and Huddrsfield. Although losing my narrow score lines in Scotland, the Fettesian-Lorettonian team won both matches in England, which saw the Athletics News report \\"...persons who saw the doings of the Fettes-Loretto boys in Huddersfield and Manchester are willing to swear that a better team never existed, and a general wish has been expressed that Don-Wauchope should bring his grand team into the North of England once more.\\" In 1883 he was playing for Edinburgh University.https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=MbtEAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=pbUMAAAAIBAJ&pg;=1873%2C4820432 Later that same season, he moved to Edinburgh Wanderers.https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000452/18840128/022/0003 =Provincial career= He was capped by Edinburgh District for the inter-city match in 1883.https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=MbtEAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=pbUMAAAAIBAJ&pg;=1873%2C4820432 He was capped by East of Scotland District in their match against the West of Scotland District in January 1884.https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000452/18840128/022/0003 =International career= He was chosen to represent Scotland in the 1881 international friendly with England. The game ended in a draw, and although not present for Scotland's next encounter, against Ireland, he was again playing at half-back for the next match to England. The game was played at Manchester, with Scotland winning by two tries to nil, the first time Scotland had beaten the English on their own soil. After playing in the very first Scotland match against Wales in early 1883, scoring his first international try in the game, Don-Wauchope was incapacitated for the rest of the season with a knee injury. He regained his place for all three matches of the 1884 Home Nations Championship, paired at half back with Oxford University rival Augustus Grant-Asher. After victories over Wales and Ireland, where he scored another try, this time against Ireland; the Scottish team were beaten by England in a contentious game at Blackheath. The next season saw Scotland draw to Wales, beat Ireland, and refuse to face England. Don-Wauchope played in both games of the 1885 Championship and in the home clash with Ireland, not only scored his third international try, but was also joined at half-back with his younger brother Patrick Hamilton Don-Wauchope. This was Patrick's first international game, and he would go on to win five more caps for Scotland. The 1886 Championship saw Scotland win the tournament trophy for the first time, with wins over Wales and Ireland, and a draw against England. Don-Wauchope scored a try in the encounter with Wales and two in a massive victory over the Irish. Although missing all of the 1887 international matches, Don-Wauchope played one final game for his country in 1888. Played at home against Ireland, he was given the honour of the Scotland captaincy, leading his team out to a final victory.

He first officiated an international match in 1889 when he took charge of the Home Nations Championship encounter between Wales and Ireland. It had been a busy day for Don-Wauchope, as he had spent the morning chairing a meeting of the International Rugby Board.Godwin (1984), 22. He went on to referee another two international games, in 1890 and 1893. =Administrative career= Don- Wauchope became the 17th President of the Scottish Rugby Union.

The equations originate from the central projection of a point of the object through the optical centre of the camera to the image on the sensor plane. The three points P, Q and R are projected on the plane S through the projection centre C x- and z-axis of the projection of P through the projection centre C Let x,y, and z refer to a coordinate system with the x- and y-axis in the sensor plane. Denote the coordinates of the point P on the object by x_P,y_P,z_P, the coordinates of the image point of P on the sensor plane by x and y and the coordinates of the projection (optical) centre by x_0,y_0,z_0. As a consequence of the projection method there is the same fixed ratio \\\\lambda between x-x_0 and x_0-x_P, y-y_0 and y_0-y_P, and the distance of the projection centre to the sensor plane z_0=c and z_P-z_0. Hence: :x-x_0=-\\\\lambda (x_P-x_0) :y-y_0=-\\\\lambda (y_P-y_0) :c=\\\\lambda (z_P- z_0), Solving for \\\\lambda in the last equation and entering it in the others yields: :x-x_0=-c\\\\ \\\\frac{x_P-x_0}{z_P-z_0} :y-y_0=-c\\\\ \\\\frac{y_P-y_0}{z_P-z_0} The point P is normally given in some coordinate system \\"outside\\" the camera by the coordinates X, Y and Z, and the projection centre by X_0,Y_0,Z_0. These coordinates may be transformed through a rotation and a translation to the system on the camera. The translation doesn't influence the differences of the coordinates, and the rotation, often called camera transform, is given by a 3√ó3-matrix R, transforming (X-X_0,Y-Y_0,Z-Z_0) into: :x_P-x_0=R_{11} (X-X_0)+ R_{21}(Y-Y_0) + R_{31} (Z-Z_0) :y_P-y_0=R_{12} (X-X_0)+ R_{22}(Y-Y_0) + R_{32} (Z-Z_0) and :z_P-z_0=R_{13}(X-X_0) + R_{23} (Y-Y_0) + R_{33} (Z-Z_0) Substitution of these expressions, leads to a set of two equations, known as the collinearity equations: : x - x_0= -c\\\\ \\\\frac{R_{11} (X-X_0)+ R_{21}(Y-Y_0) + R_{31} (Z-Z_0)} {R_{13}(X-X_0) + R_{23} (Y-Y_0) + R_{33} (Z-Z_0)} : y - y_0= -c\\\\ \\\\frac{R_{12} (X-X_0)+ R_{22}(Y-Y_0) + R_{32} (Z-Z_0)} {R_{13}(X-X_0) + R_{23} (Y-Y_0) + R_{33} (Z-Z_0)} The most obvious use of these equations is for images recorded by a camera. In this case the equation describes transformations from object space (X, Y, Z) to image coordinates (x, y). It forms the basis for the equations used in bundle adjustment. They indicate that the image point (on the sensor plate of the camera), the observed point (on the object) and the projection center of the camera were aligned when the picture was taken.

The light station was established in 1828 as a guide to the southern entrance to Frenchman Bay. The present tower was built in 1855; the well-preserved tower, keeper's house, and associated outbuildings were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Description The present light station includes four buildings: the tower, keeper's house, oil house, and fuel house. The tower and keeper's house were both built in 1855, the oil house is a small brick structure built in 1895, and the fuel house is a small wood frame structure built in 1905. The keeper's house and tower were originally connected by a covered way. The tower stands at the high point of Baker Island, about above sea level. The focal plane of its lens is above its base. The brick tower had two windows in the stairwell, but these have been bricked over. The brick tower has an octagonal iron lantern house with a surrounding railing and walkway mounted on it, which is topped by a polygonal dome. When built, the station was given a fourth-order Fresnel lens. The keeper's house is a small L-shaped wood frame building, with a gable roof and a brick foundation. Now finished in clapboards, it was originally clad in board-and-batten siding. There was originally a covered passage from the house's east end covering the short distance to the tower, but this has been removed. History The Baker Island station was established in 1828, and was the first along Maine's coast located in the general vicinity of Mount Desert Island. The light is an aid to navigation for reaching that island's major ports, including Bar Harbor and Northeast Harbor. The buildings of the station are now owned and administered by Acadia National Park; the light itself is maintained by the United States Coast Guard.

The River Brittle meanders southwards through the glen towards its mouth in Loch Brittle. The island of Rum is visible in the distance. Waterfalls running into the River Brittle Glen Brittle (Gleann Breadail in Scottish Gaelic) is a large glen in the south of the Isle of Skye, in Scotland. It runs roughly south to north, along the River Brittle, which has its mouth at Loch Brittle (a sea loch). The glen is also overlooked from the east by the formidable Cuillin, the largest mountains on Skye. Many tributaries of the Brittle run down from these mountains into the glen, including a stream with waterfalls known as the Fairy Pools, a popular place to go for a walk. Because of its location by the peaks, the area is popular with hikers and mountain bikers. The name is probably derived from old Norse Bred Dal (\\"broad valley\\") with the Gaelic glean (\\"valley\\") being prefixed later.Norsk-engelsk ordbok ved Willy Kirkeby: Gyldendal Norsk Forlag A single road and power line run through the glen on the east side of the river. On the slopes on the west side there are large sections of forest maintained by the Forestry Commission. In terms of settlement there are two scattered hamlets in the south of the glen - Glenbrittle and Bualintur. The most popular choice of accommodation is Glenbrittle Campsite and the SYHA's 1930s youth hostel by the Allt a' Choire Ghreadaidh (a Brittle tributary) just north of Glenbrittle hamlet. This is an ideal starting point for walks up to the Cuillin hills. The sandy beach at the southernmost point of the glen is the most popular attraction. It is adjacent to the campsite, where there is also a grocery shop, and campers often visit the beach and swim in the loch. Wildlife enthusiasts also enjoy the glen, as it is home to many interesting animals and plants. In the northern woods and fields red deer can be seen. Sheep and meadow pipits graze pretty much everywhere, whilst there are also large flocks of herring gulls and hooded crows about, as well as a pair of ravens by the hostel. Rabbits and swallows tend to be restricted to the farmland in the south. Again, the beach is the star attraction for wildlife. Turnstones, ringed plovers, grey herons, dunlins, curlews and most of all oystercatchers all hang around probing in the mud for food. One of the less pleasant species to populate the beach at dusk is the highland midge.

A ho trai can come in different shapes and sizes. For many centuries, the sacred Tripitaka scriptures had been written on palm leaves. To preserve the scriptures against humidity and against termites, the library was often built on columns to raise the storage from the ground. Bricks were preferably used in constructions to battle termites. Sometimes the ho trai would be built, especially for this reason, above man-made ponds. Traditionally, the Tripitaka scriptures consisted of individual palm leaves, each measuring around 50 cm in length and around 4 to 6 cm in width. They were perforated and threaded in order to combine them in stacks of 20 to 40 pages. These stacks are kept pressed between two pieces of teakwood which is then wrapped in cloth and stored in a special bookcase. These bookcases are sometimes exquisitely crafted with mother-of-pearl inlay or with gold leaf applied on black lacquer. Beautiful examples of bookcases can be seen in the Bangkok National Museum.

Plot introduction The book involves a reunion of the Godley family as the family patriarch, Adam, lies in a coma on his deathbed. The book takes place in an alternative reality with the world powered by cold fusion and steam trains are still in use. His family, consisting of Adam his son (and Adam's wife Helen), his daughter Petra and his wife Ursula are present at this reunion. The story is narrated by the god Hermes, who dictates how the story will unfold along with his father Zeus and his mother Maia.http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/b/john- banville/infinities.htm History Banville intended The Infinities as a faithful adaptation of the play Amphitryon by the German playwright Heinrich von Kleist. The novel did not turn out quite like this though - \\"I kept the Skeleton, but fiction always goes in its own direction.\\" Irish Examiner; 5 September 2009. Reception The Infinities, Banville's first novel under his own name since 2005, was well received and seen to fit naturally into his oeuvre. \\"In the 1980s, Banville challenged his readers to imagine a Nabokov novel based on the life of a G√∂del or an Einstein,\\" wrote Irish literary critic Val Nolan in The Sunday Business Post. \\"The Infinities is finally that book. Old Adam's lineage runs through Oppenheimer, Hilbert, Brahe, Kepler, and hence to Banville's so-called Revolutions Trilogy of science novels.\\" External links * Articles and More: John Banville Author interview about The Infinities from the Irish Examiner, 5 September 2009.

Life He was son of William Stanley, gentleman, of Hinckley, Leicestershire, by his wife Lucy, daughter of William Beveridge, D.D., vicar of Barrow-upon-Soar, and sister to Bishop William Beveridge. He was born at Hinckley in 1647, and baptised there on 22 August the same year. He was educated in a school at Ashley, Lancashire, by Jeremy Crompton, and was on 4 July 1663 admitted a sizar of St. John's College, Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. in 1666. He was elected a fellow of Corpus Christi College in 1669, and commenced M.A. in 1670. After being ordained priest in 1672, he became a university preacher in 1676, and graduated B.D. in 1678. He became curate of Hadham Magna, Hertfordshire, and chaplain to Arthur Capell, 1st Earl of Essex, who presented him to the rectory of Raine Parva, Essex, on 20 October 1681. This he gave up for the rectory of St. Mary Magdalen, Old Fish Street, London. He was preferred to the prebend of Codington Major in St Paul's Cathedral, 18 September 1684. At this time he was engaged in a scheme for printing an edition of the English Bible, with a plain practical and Protestant commentary, the portion assigned to him being the minor prophets; but the plan was eventually abandoned. He was appointed chaplain to the Princess of Orange on the dismissal of John Covel in 1685, and before he proceeded to Holland the archbishop of Canterbury conferred upon him the Lambeth degree of D.D., 12 November 1685. As soon as Mary was seated upon the throne of England, he was advanced to the post of clerk of the closet with a salary of 200l. a year settled upon him for life. In 1689 he became canon residentiary of St. Paul's; on 13 August 1690 he was collated by Bishop Henry Compton to the rectory of Hadham Magna; and on 5 March 1692 he was appointed archdeacon of London. The natural tone of his voice was so loud that when taking part in the cathedral services he was heard above all the other singers. A humorous account was given of him by Richard Steele in The Tatler, under the name and character of Stentor. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1689 He was unanimously chosen master of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, 13 July 1693, in succession to John Spencer, and served the office of vice-chancellor of the university in the same year. On 18 January 1694 he was created D.D. at Cambridge. He resigned the mastership in 1698, and he accepted the deanery of St. Asaph on 7 December 1706, at the request of Bishop Beveridge. He defrayed the whole cost an Act of Parliament (it annexed prebends and sinecures to the four Welsh sees in order to relieve the widows and children of the Welsh clergy from the distress of paying mortuaries to the bishops upon the death of every incumbent). He died on 9 October 1731, and was buried in St. Paul's Cathedral.

Mohammed Ali annexed the two palayams of Ariyalur and Udayarpalayam located with troops were in the Ariyalur district on the grounds of default in payment of Tributes and failure to assist him in quelling the rebellion of Yusuf Khan. In November 1764, Mohammed Ali represented the issue to Madras Council and obtained military assistance on 3 January 1765. The forces led by Umdat-Ul-Umara and Donald Campbell entered Ariyalur and captured it. The young Poligar together with his followers there upon fled to Udayarpalayam. On 19 January the army marched upon Udayarpalayam. The Poligar‚Äôs troops were defeated and the playams were occupied. The two poligars fled their town and took refuge in Tharangampadi, then a Danish Settlement. The annexation of the palayam gave the Navab un- interrupted possession of all his territories extending Arcot to Tiruchirapalli.

It should not be confused with the TV network RT, which was known as Russia Today prior to 2009. However, the network is still sometimes referred to as \\"Russia Today\\" or the \\"New Russia Today\\" in foreign media.  History  Rossiya Segodnya incorporates the former RIA Novosti news service and the international radio service Voice of Russia (formerly Radio Moscow). According to the Decree of the President of Russia on December 9, 2013, the mandate of the new agency is to \\"provide information on Russian state policy and Russian life and society for audiences abroad.\\" Vladimir Putin's chief of staff, Sergei Ivanov, said that Rossiya Segodnya was being created in order to increase the cost efficiency in Russian state media. However, RIA Novosti's own report about the move speculated it was an attempt to consolidate state control over the media sector and Western news outlets stated that this was also a move by Putin to propagate a more pleasant image of Russia abroad. According to a report on the RT news channel, Rossiya Segodnya is \\"in no way related\\" to the RT news channel despite the similarity in name (RT was known as Russia Today prior to its rebranding in 2009). However, a report by the BBC states that it \\"seems likely [...] that [Rossiya Segodnya] will complement the work of the state-funded foreign-language TV station, RT.\\" On 31 December 2013, Margarita Simonyan was appointed editor-in-chief of the news agency, as well as being RT's news channel editor-in-chief. She will serve in both positions concurrently. On 10 November 2014, the agency launched the Sputnik multimedia platform with Radio Sputnik as its audio component, replacing the Voice of Russia. The radio service is available internationally on FM, digital DAB/DAB+ (Digital Radio Broadcasting), HD-Radio, as well as mobile phones and the Internet. Within Russia itself, Rossiya Segodnya continues to use the RIA Novosti brand as its Russian-language news agency using the website ria.ru. In 2015 Rossiya Segondya received 6.48 billion Rubel from the state budget. Following his transfer from Ukraine to Russia on 7 September 2019 as part of the Ukraine-Russia prisoner exchanges, Kirill Vyshinsky became the executive director of Rossiya Segodnya on 9 September 2019. Controversy =Allegations of homophobia= This organisatation is headed by Dmitry Kiselyov, a pro-Putin news presenter on the domestic Russia-1 television channel, who has gained significant controversy in the Western media with his remarks claiming foreign conspiracies against Russia and verbally abusing homosexuals. Dmitry described as the \\"spearhead\\" of such anti-LGBTQ propaganda on the network, making various provocative comments regarding the Russian LGBTQ community. He has stated that a gay person's organs are unworthy of being transplanted heterosexual, and that gay men should be prohibited from donating blood or sperm. The Russian LGBTQ community has also been referred to by Kiselyov as an \\"aggressive minority\\" opposed to \\"parents fighting to give their children a healthy upbringing\\", stating falsified statistics that \\"40% of children brought up by homosexuals have venereal diseases\\".  Allegations of censorship  On December 1, 2014, Ukrainian journalist Oleksandr Chalenko accused \\"Russia Today\\" of censorship after an interview with the former Defense Minister of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, Igor Strelkov. The Strelkov's press service and the agency's editorial staff reduced it, removing the confirmation of Igor Strelkov's own title of Colonel of the FSB and the negative assessment of the assault by Donetsk airport units.

MLIA was a spin-off from the website FMyLife. The website's purpose was to demonstrate to its readers that, like them, there are many average people in the world. MLIA sought to show that a person being average does not necessarily mean that he or she is boring. MLIA was co-founded by UCLA students Guru Khalsa and Enrico Mills. Khalsa said that MLIA sought to \\"bring to light how much stupid and boring stuff gets posted on the Internet.\\" Nathalie Graham wrote in The Stranger in 2019 regarding MyLifeIsAverage, \\"The site doesn't really work anymore\\". Submission After being submitted, the stories were screened by moderators. If enough users voted that the story was worthy of being posted, then it became the first story on the home page, and would later be pushed down the page. The website allowed anyone to submit stories for a chance of publication. After being posted, users could click on the story I.D. to leave a comment. The stories almost always began with the word \\"Today\\" and ended with the phrase \\"MLIA\\". MLIA received more than 2,000,000 stories. On average, each story garnered several hundred votes. The majority of the users were students in high school or college. MLIA contained humorous reasons for the existence of its features. When a person would attempt to add a story when not signed in, the page would read: \\"Our mediocre server was being inundated with submissions, so until it recovers, only registered users can submit.\\" As a response to why a user should join, MLIA stated: \\"No one cares. It would let you comment on submissions, but really, does anyone need or want to read your literary flatulence?\\" Karin Fuller of The Charleston Gazette found a number of MLIA stories to be her favorites. In The Charleston Gazette, Fuller shared the MLIA post: \\"Today, I saw a commercial about a dandruff shampoo that said '85 percent of women agree that dandruff is a turn-off.' Does that mean 15 percent think it's a turn-on? MLIA.\\" She also shared: \\"Today, I met a girl named Unique. She has an identical twin sister. No one else thought it was funny. MLIA.\\" A third story she chose was: \\"Today, I was helping my 10-year-old brother with his homework. One math problem ended with 'Is Susie correct? Explain.' I told him you never argue with women. He wrote that. He got full credit. MLIA.\\" Inactive website The Strangers Nathalie Graham, a former user of the website, wrote in 2019 about MyLifeIsAverage, \\"It was formulaic, it was consumable, and it was easily mocked. It was my gateway drug into being very online.\\" She found that MLIA participants started a tight-knit community in which initially comments were largely about MLIA submissions but later comments were just an avenue to engage in unrelated online chats. The next stage of MLIA comments was that some participants began using year-old submissions to engage in cybersex, causing cruel cyberbullying to take place. MLIA moderators began prohibiting commenters from using profanity which caused people to use \\"asterisk workarounds\\" such as \\"sh*t\\" instead of \\"shit\\" and to use \\"fudging\\" instead of \\"fucking\\" which Graham found \\"really solidified the death of the comments section and the death of the site\\". Graham said the MyLifeIsAverage website \\"doesn't really work anymore\\". MyLifeIsTwilight MyLifeIsAverage inspired the website MyLifeIsTwilight (MLIT), which was founded by Christopher McElvogue. MyLifeIsTwilight allows users to share stories about how Twilight has impacted their lives. The website publishes submissions that applaud and criticize the Twilight books. Journalist Emily Handy wrote in The Oracle that \\"the site offers an entertaining look into the world of Twilight fans that will both entertain and disturb\\". She shared a MLIT post: \\"Today I asked my boyfriend if he would hold ice to his lips for a minute before he kissed me, so I could pretend I was kissing Edward. He did.

Although usually given the chemical formula (C2H5)2AlCl, it exists as a dimer, [(C2H5)2AlCl]2 It is a precursor to Ziegler-Natta catalysts employed for the production of polyolefins. The compound is also a Lewis acid, useful in organic synthesis. The compound is a colorless waxy solid, but is usually handled as a solution in hydrocarbon solvents. It is highly reactive, even pyrophoric. Structure Compounds of the empirical formula AlR2Cl (R = alkyl, aryl) exist as dimers with the formula (R2Al)2(Œº-Cl)2. The aluminium adopts a tetrahedral geometry.  Production  Diethylaluminium chloride can be produced from ethylaluminium sesquichloride, (C2H5)3Al2Cl3, by reduction with sodium: :2 (C2H5)3Al2Cl3 \\\\+ 3 Na ‚Üí 3 (C2H5)2AlCl + Al + 3 NaCl It is also obtained from the reaction of triethylaluminium with hydrochloric acid: :(C2H5)3Al + HCl ‚Üí (C2H5)2AlCl + C2H6 Reproportionation reactions can also be used: :2 (C2H5)3Al + AlCl3 ‚Üí 3 (C2H5)2AlCl :(C2H5)3Al2Cl3 \\\\+ (C2H5)3Al ‚Üí 3 (C2H5)2AlCl  Uses  Diethylaluminium chloride and other organoaluminium compounds are used in combination with transition metal compounds as Ziegler‚ÄìNatta catalysts for the polymerization of various alkenes. As a Lewis acid, diethylaluminium chloride also has uses in organic synthesis. For example, it is used to catalyze the Diels‚ÄìAlder and ene reactions. Alternatively, it can react as a nucleophile or a proton scavenger. Safety Diethylaluminium chloride is not only flammable but pyrophoric. References * Hu, Y. J.; Jiang, H. L.; Wang, H.

The second, in 2004, involved the disclosure of custodial information to an outside source. =Pay Pop Inc.= In 1998, Alnoor Jiwan, a manager in CIBC Mellon's Vancouver office, was approached by Pay Pop Inc. and asked whether CIBC Mellon could issue Pay Pop Inc. shares without the required disclaimer which stated that the securities were not registered with the SEC. It was alleged by the SEC, in the subsequent investigation, that Mr Jiwan knew that the securities were not registered, but agreed to act as the transfer agent (in order to issue the stock certificates) in return for 820,000 Pay Pop shares. The SEC subsequently cited CIBC Mellon for acting as an unregistered broker and transfer agent, and for offering to sell unregistered securities in addition to alleging that the company was uncooperative in the investigation. Alnoor Jiwan was subsequently terminated for cause from CIBC Mellon, following the company's discovery of the transactions, and simultaneously ceasing all dealings with Pay Pop Inc.Toronto Star, February 17, 2005, p.D.4 CMTC agreed to pay a civil monetary penalty of US$5 million and disgorgement of $889,773 and prejudgment interest of $140,270. CMTC was permanently enjoined from prescribed violations of Securities Act Section 5, Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, Exchange Act Section 15(a), Exchange Act Section 17A(c)(1), and from aiding and abetting future violations of Exchange Act Section 10(b) or Rule 10b-5. Payment was made on March 4, 2005. CMTC also consented, without admitting or denying the SEC complaint's allegations, to the entry of an SEC administrative order based on the final judgment on March 2, 2005. Pursuant to the order, CMTC was censured and agreed to an undertaking to engage an independent consultant to review its relevant businesses and procedures.TA1 dated January 12, 2011 =Privacy breach= In 2004, a long-term employee of CIBC Mellon was terminated, after it had been discovered that they had been disclosing institutional holdings in certain companies to unidentified parties in return for gifts. It was reported that the employee had received hockey and baseball tickets as well as up to $100 in cash for tips on big investors who owned specific stocks. The disclosures were discovered when a temporary worker received a request for data through an email. The subsequent investigation, which included reviewing phone and email records, discovered that the employee had been disclosing information for years.Toronto Star, December 9, 2004, p. C.1 =Related party transactions with Enron= In 2003, CIBC paid out $80 million in charges for complicity with its involvement with Enron.

The album was recorded by the original members of the band as a result of their inability to access their masters or re-release their own earlier material, which had passed from the ownership of label Cameo to Allen Klein. It included all of the songs released on their first album, 96 Tears, as well as several other tracks. The rerecorded version of \\"96 Tears\\" was subsequently incorporated into compilations. Background In the 1960s, Michigan-based band ? & the Mysterians found a regional hit with the song \\"96 Tears\\", particularly popular in Texas. The song was originally released on the Pa-Go- Go label, but aggressive offers from several larger distributors resulted in their selling the master to Cameo. Cameo shortened the recording and distributed the single nationally, resulting in a #1 Billboard hit. The band subsequently released several singles and two albums, 96 Tears and Action, on the label. In 1968, the entire catalogue of Cameo-Parkway releases, including those by ? & the Mysterians, were purchased by Allen Klein. Klein refused to permit \\"96 Tears\\" to be included on compilations or to permit their albums to be reissued, so in 1997 members of the band, including its vocalist, came together after a studio recording hiatus of several decades to re-record their original songs. The eponymous album was the first of two such re-recordings by the band, who were subsequently able to license their new version of the song for compilations. It would be October 2005 before Klein's company, ABKCO Records, would make a CD of the original releases, The Best of ? & the Mysterians: Cameo Parkway 1966-1967. Album The new album included all 12 tracks from the original album 96 Tears, plus an additional four. Two of the tracks, \\"Smokes\\" and \\"Got To\\", had were included on the band's second album, Action. The other two songs, \\"Do Something to Me\\" and \\"Make You Mine\\", had been released as singles in 1967 and 1968. In its review, Allmusic notes that although the album is made by the original line-up, the material doesn't sound the same as it did when first released, but adds that \\"the group sounds tough, dynamic, and exciting...these guys can still kick hard, which is what makes the record worthwhile for die-hard garage freaks.\\" Track listing All songs written by Rudy Martinez, except where noted. #\\"96 Tears\\" ‚Äì 3:01 #\\"Midnight Hour\\" ‚Äì 2:52 #\\"I Need Somebody\\" ‚Äì 2:12 #\\"'8' Teen\\" ‚Äì 2:46 #\\"Smokes\\" ‚Äì 1:50 #\\"Got To\\" ‚Äì 2:38 #\\"Do Something to Me\\" (Jimmy Calvert, Norman Marzano, Paul Naumann) ‚Äì 2:32 #\\"Stormy Monday\\" (traditional) ‚Äì 3:45 #\\"Up Side\\" ‚Äì 2:56 #\\"Don't Break This Heart of Mine\\" ‚Äì 2:02 #\\"Ten O'Clock\\" ‚Äì 2:24 #\\"Why Me\\" ‚Äì 1:45 #\\"You're Telling Me Lies\\" ‚Äì 2:29 #\\"Don't Tease Me\\" ‚Äì 1:37 #\\"Set Aside\\" ‚Äì 2:48 #\\"Make You Mine\\" ‚Äì 2:44 Personnel =Musicians= * ?

In 1973, Stranch enrolled at Vanderbilt University earning a Bachelor of Arts degree, summa cum laude, in 1975.

Early in her career Stranch practiced law in both the state and federal courts with a focus in labor employment, Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), personal injury, worker's compensation, wrongful death, and utility law. During the latter part of the 1990s, Stranch's practice was mainly complex litigation and class action work throughout the United States. Many of her cases involved representation of plan participants who had lost their individual account pensions due to fiduciary breaches, often concurrent with corporate scandals. Stranch litigated approximately 85% of her cases before the federal courts and 15% in state courts and other administrative agencies. The vast majority (95%) were in civil proceedings.  Federal judicial service  On August 6, 2009, President Barack Obama announced that he had nominated Stranch to a vacancy on the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, to the seat vacated when Judge Martha Craig Daughtrey assumed senior status on January 1, 2009. Stranch was one of several candidates whom NashvillePost.com had reported in April 2009 was being considered for the seat, along with United States District Judge William Joseph Haynes, Jr., United States District Judge Bernice B. Donald, Nashville criminal defense attorney David Raybin and Vanderbilt University Law School Professor Lisa Schultz Bressman. In addition, in the February 8, 2009 Nashville Tennessean, Stranch was interviewed by the newspaper about her interest in the vacancy, and she told The Tennessean that \\"I think there's value in a judge having a great deal of federal experience, but also one who's litigated. I would hope to bring to the bench a fair temperament but also an understanding of what it means to be a litigator in the courts.\\" After a more than one-year wait, the United States Senate voted on September 13, 2010 with a vote of 71 to 21 in favor of Stranch, who has waited longer than any other Obama nominee for a confirmation from the Senate.U.S. Senate Roll Call Votes 111th Congress - 2nd Session, Vote Number 230: Confirmation Jane Branstetter Stranch, senate.gov (September 13, 2010).

Young, the Sixth Circuit considered whether a mandatory 15-year sentence, as required under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) constituted cruel and unusual punishment for a convicted felon who possessed seven shotgun shells. Young's prior felony offenses, for burglary, had occurred roughly twenty years before he was found with the shells. On September 11, 2014, a three-judge panel, including Judge Stranch, upheld the sentence. But Judge Stranch wrote a concurrence to express her view on mandatory minimum sentencing: \\"I therefore join the continuous flood of voices expressing concern that the ACCA and other mandatory minimum laws are ineffective in achieving their purpose and damaging to our federal criminal justice system and our nation. I commend this case as another example of the need to reconsider the ACCA and mandatory sentencing in general.\\"  Personal  Stranch's husband, James G.
