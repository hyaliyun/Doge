The Master of the Legend of the Magdalen (sometimes called the Master of the Magdalen Legend) was an Early Netherlandish painter, active from about 1483 to around 1527. He has not been identified; his name of convenience is derived from a large, now-dispersed altarpiece with scenes from the life of Mary Magdalene, which has been dated to between 1515 and 1520 based on the costumes of the donor portraits. However other works attributed to him are extremely difficult to date with any accuracy. Many paintings have been linked with the triptych, which is thought to have been finished late in the artist's career. Other major works include his two Magdalen panels in London. He is not to be confused with the \\"Master of the Mansi Magdalen\\" (fl. ?Antwerp, c. 1515‚Äì25) or the Magdalen Master (fl. Florence, c. 1265‚Äì90).Hans M. Schmidt, et al. \\"Masters, anonymous, and monogrammists.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press, accessed May 7, 2015, subscription required Some of his portraits suggest a possible link with artists in Brussels, and it is thought that he worked there, and headed a large workshop. An early influence appears to have been Rogier van der Weyden; his work also shares characteristics with that of Bernard van Orley, and a link with the Master of the Death of the Virgin has been suggested. Like van Orley, this artist is believed to have been active in the court of Margaret of Habsburg, regent of the Netherlands from 1507 until 1530. Works ascribed to the Master are in the collections of the National Gallery, London, the Philadelphia Museum of Art and the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge. He is sometimes associated with Pieter van Coninxloo based on similarities of style, time and location.Meester van de Legende van de Heilige Magdalena in the RKD A number of art historians, including Max Friedl√§nder, who first made the association between the works now attributed to the Master of the Legend of the Magdalen, have speculated that they may have been the same person.Friedl√§nder, Max J. Early Netherlandish Painting: Volume 13: Antonis MOR and His Contemporaries. Kluwer Academic Publishers, ed 1975. 48. It is possible also that van Coninxloo for a time was a member of the master's workshop.Campbell, 114 Works Master of the Magdalen Legend - \\"The Magdalen\\" 1510-20 Thirteen versions of a portrait format image of \\"The Magdalen\\" were painted by the Master of the Magdalen Legend and his workshop between the years of 1510-20. This piece in particular was originally thought to depict Mary of Burgundy under the guise of the Magdalen, but it has since been discovered to be her daughter, Margaret of Austria. The faint gilding in the shape of a halo above the head of the sitter implies it is of a saint, and she wears a dress similar to those worn by 16th century courtesans, which was representative of Mary Magdalene's sinful past. The jar of ointment which she holds was the usual attribute of the Magdalen, as she was known for pouring this ointment on Jesus's feet. Notes SourcesCampbell, Lorne.

E-prescribing allows a physician, physician assistant, pharmacist, nurse practitioner to use digital prescription software to electronically transmit a new prescription or renewal authorization to a community or mail-order pharmacy. It outlines the ability to send error-free, accurate, and understandable prescriptions electronically from the healthcare provider to the pharmacy. E-prescribing is meant to reduce the risks associated with traditional prescription script writing. It is also one of the major reasons for the push for electronic medical records. By sharing medical prescription information, e-prescribing seeks to connect the patient's team of healthcare providers to facilitate knowledgeable decision making.MedRunner Inc.

Safety checks include: automated prompts that offer information on the drug being prescribed, potential inappropriate dose or route of administration, drug-drug interactions, allergy concerns, or warnings of caution * Flagging availability of lower cost, therapeutically appropriate alternatives (if any) * Providing information on formulary or tiered formulary medications, patient eligibility, and authorization requirements received electronically from the patient's insurance provider * System integration capabilities (e.g., connection with various databases, connection with pharmacy and pharmacy benefit manager systems) * Educational capabilities (e.g., patient education, provider feedback) Model High-level dataflow diagram outlining the roles and processes involved in electronic prescribing The basic components of an electronic prescribing system are the: # Prescriber - typically a physician # Transaction hub # Pharmacy with implemented electronic prescribing software # Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM) The PBM and transaction hub work closely together. The PBM works as an intermediate actor to ensure the accuracy of information, although other models may not include this to streamline the communication process. In addition to pharmacies, medical tests can also be prescribed. = Prescriber = The prescriber, generally a clinician or healthcare staff, is defined as the electronic prescribing system user and sign into the system through a verification process to authenticate their identity. The prescriber searches through the database of patient records by using patient-specific information such as first and last name, date of birth, current address etc. Once the correct patient file has been accessed, the prescriber reviews the current medical information and uploads or updates new prescription information to the medical file. =Transaction hub= The transaction hub provides the common link between all actors (prescriber, pharmacy benefit manager, and pharmacy). It stores and maintains a master patient index for quick access to their medical information as well as a list of pharmacies. When the prescriber uploads new prescription information to the patient file, this is sent to the transaction hub. The transaction hub will verify against the patient index. This will automatically send information about this transaction to the PBM, who will respond to the hub with information on patient eligibility, formulary, and medication history back to the transaction hub. The transaction hub then sends this information to the prescriber to improve patient management and care by completing and authorizing the prescription. Upon which, the prescription information is sent to the pharmacy that the patient primarily goes to. =Pharmacy= When a pharmacy receives the prescription information from the transaction hub, it will send a confirmation message. The pharmacy also has the ability to communicate to the prescriber that the prescription order has been filled through the system. Further system development will soon allow different messages such as a patient not picking up their medication or is late to pick up medication to improve patient management. =Imaging= When an imaging center receives the prescription, the imaging center will then contact the patient and schedule the patient for his/her scan. The advantage of ePrescribing radiology is that oftentimes when a patient is handed a paper script, the patient will lose the prescription or wait to call and schedule. This can be disastrous for patients with severe underlying conditions. The imaging center will call and schedule the patient as soon as the referral arrives. There are mobile ePrescribing portals as well as web portals that handle this well, and there are advantages. Benefits Compared to paper-based prescribing, e-prescribing can improve health and reduce costs because it can: * Reduce prescribing and dispensing errors * Decrease the work needed to execute a prescription * Speed receipt of prescribed drugs * Avoid more adverse drug interactions and reactions * More reliably offer to substitute less expensive drug alternatives by checking the formulary of the insurance provider in the doctor's office * Improve medication compliance (taking the prescribed medications on time) by reducing lost and unfilled prescriptions and minimizing patient costs * Reduce the incidence of drug diversion (drug abuse) by alerting providers and pharmacists of duplicative prescriptions for controlled substances. Safety improvements are highly desirable; in 2000, the Institute of Medicine identified medication errors as the most common type of medical error in health care, estimating that this leads to several thousand deaths each year. =Improving patient safety and quality of care= Illegibility from handwritten prescriptions is eliminated, decreasing the risk of medication errors while simultaneously decreasing risks related to liability. Oral miscommunications regarding prescriptions can be reduced, as e-prescribing should decrease the need for phone calls between prescribers and dispensers. Causes of medication errors include mistakes by the pharmacist incorrectly interpreting illegible handwriting or ambiguous nomenclature, and lapses in the prescriber's knowledge of desired dosage of a drug or undesired interactions between multiple drugs. Electronic prescribing has the potential to eliminate most of these types of errors. Warning and alert systems are provided at the point of care. E-prescribing systems can enhance an overall medication management process through clinical decision support systems that can perform checks against the patient's current medications for drug-drug interactions, drug- allergy interactions, diagnoses, body weight, age, drug appropriateness, and correct dosing. Based on these algorithms, the system can alert prescribers to contradictions, adverse reactions, and duplicate therapies. The computer can also ensure that clear and unambiguous instructions are encoded in a structured message to the pharmacist, and decision support systems can flag lethal dosages and lethal combinations of drugs. E-prescribing allows for increased access to the patient's medical records and their medication history. Having access to this information from all health care providers at the time of prescribing can support alerts related to drug inappropriateness, in combination with other medications or with specific medical issues at hand. =Reducing time spent on phone calls and call-backs to pharmacies= According to estimates, almost 30 percent of prescriptions require pharmacy callbacks.Medicare Program; E-Prescribing and the Prescription Drug Program; Proposed Rule. 70 FR 6256, February 4, 2005 This translates into less time available to the pharmacist for other important functions, such as educating consumers about their medications. In response, E-prescribing can significantly reduce the volume of pharmacy call-backs related to illegibility, mistaken prescription choices, formulary and pharmacy benefits, decreasing the amount of time wasted on the phone. This ultimately impacts office workflow efficiency and overall productivity in a positive manner. =Reducing time spent faxing prescriptions to pharmacies= Both prescribers and pharmacists can save time and resources spent on faxing prescriptions through a reduction in labor costs, handling costs, and paper expenses waste due to unreliability. =Automating the prescription renewal request and authorization process= With e-prescribing, renewal authorization can be an automated process that provides efficiencies for both the prescriber and pharmacist. Pharmacy staff can generate a renewal request (authorization request) that is delivered through the electronic network to the prescriber's system. The prescriber can then review the request and act accordingly by approving or denying the request through updating the system. With limited resource utilization and just a few clicks on behalf of the prescriber, they can complete a medication renewal task while enhancing continuous patient documentation. =Increasing patient convenience and medication compliance= It is estimated that 20% of paper-based prescription orders go unfilled by the patient, partly due to the hassle of dropping off a paper prescription and waiting for it to be filled. By elimination or reducing this waiting period, e-prescribing may help reduce the number of unfilled prescriptions and hence, increasing medication adherence. Allowing the renewal of medications through this electronic system also helps improve the efficiency of this process, reducing obstacles that may result in less patient compliance. Availability of information on when patient's prescriptions are filled can also help clinicians assess patient adherence. =Allowing greater prescriber mobility= Improved prescriber convenience can be achieved when using mobile devices, that work on a wireless network, to write and renew prescriptions. Such mobile devices may include laptops, PDAs, tablet computers, or mobile phones. This freedom of mobility allows prescribers to write/renew prescriptions anywhere, even when not in the office. =Improving drug surveillance/recall ability= E-prescribing systems enable embedded, automated analytic tools to produce queries and reports, which would be close to impossible with a paper-based system. Common examples of such reporting would be: finding all patients with a particular prescription during a drug recall, or the frequency and types of medication provided by certain health care providers. Limitations Although e-prescribing has the ability to streamline workflow process and increase the system's efficiency, challenges and limitations that may hinder the widespread adoption of e-prescribing practices include: * Financial Cost and Return on Investment (ROI) - The costs associated with purchasing, implementing, supporting and maintaining such a system may be beyond the means of most small clinical practices, and noted to be one of the greatest implementation barriers. Health care workers who are responsible for medical prescription, especially those in small practices, inner-city areas, or remote rural settings, may bear more than their fair share of the cost associated with e-prescribing. This is in response to the various other stakeholders that may reap the benefits from such a system, without having to financially support it, disseminating their risk substantially. Clinical practices therefore need to invest significantly in both hardware and software, with varying costs based on system specifications (stand alone system or entire EHR system). Even clinics that receive free e-prescribing systems may face financial costs pertaining to management of the interface, customization due to flexibility, training, maintenance, and upgrades. On top of this, the clinic must also take into consideration the lost time and efficiency during the transition period of implementation. As a result, large urban areas may see the greatest ROI when compared to those in rural areas. * Change management - Many underestimate the challenges pertaining to change management when transitioning from paper-based prescriptions to e-prescribing. This is especially true in busy practices where healthcare providers and associated staff are accustomed to their current management system, in which case change management becomes extremely important. Potentially difficult and time-consuming analysis may be needed to understand how to change workflow around the management of prescriptions with the introduction of an electronic system. The change also requires pharmacists to increase their awareness of new types of errors associated with e-prescribing, in order to best target their activities to reduce clinical risk. As a result, steps must be taken to ensure effective planning, training, support, and continuous quality improvement for successful transition. * Hardware and software selection - Choosing the right hardware platform and software applications can be a rather daunting task for practices, especially in regards to small and busy settings. Many have limited access to expert information technology personnel/staff, leading them to struggle with how to get started, appropriate vendor selection, cost and function negotiations, and most importantly, long term support to ensure continuous functionality and meaningful use. * Erroneous alerts - The inability to effectively use clinical decision support systems due to the erroneous triggering of pop-up alerts with ill-defined software is also a great limitation. Under such circumstances, many opt to turn the notifications off, disabling one of the system's most beneficial aspects.Grossman, J. M., Gerland, A., Reed, M. C., & Fahlman, C. (2007). Physicians‚Äô experiences using commercial e-prescribing systems. Health affairs, 26(3), 393-404. * Integrity of data input - Accidental data entry errors such as selecting the wrong patient or clicking on the wrong choice in a menu of dosages may occur. Software vendors can reduce errors by continually reviewing user feedback and follow best practices in user interface design. * Security and privacy - As with many eHealth solutions, privacy of patient information stored in electronic format may lead to the possibility of novel errors, such as inadvertently divulging protected health information on the Internet through inadequate security practices. Instances of negligence may also arise, where employees may forward prescriptions to organizations outside its intended use.Lasky, M. C., & Keen, S. (2007). An Electronic Subscription Prescription. Intellectual property & Technology Law Journal , 19 (10), 9-11. Another security issue that needs to be addressed up front is the verification of electronic signatures, in ensuring the medical integrity of the prescriptions received by pharmacists. Hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies are counselled to be protected with firewalls, use strict computer permission settings, and remain vigilant toward signs of an intrusion. * System downtime - Periods of system downtime may arise, either due to network-related issues, hardware failure, or loss of electricity. The inability to use electronic prescribing when the system is not accessible is of great concern, and must be addressed with the discussion of fall-back procedures and mechanisms when such situations arise. * Patient Access Lost - In the event of a development beyond the control of the patient, such as a software malfunction in the health care provider's office, the patient can no longer ask the care provider for a paper prescription to take to a pharmacy (in New York, where e-prescribing is mandatory with exceptions; other states to follow suit) in order to obtain needed medicines. States such as New York, Connecticut, Maine and Pennsylvania do however, allow a prescriber to issue paper prescriptions in cases of temporary technological or electronic failure. This leaves the patient at the mercy of technicians or other undiscoverable workers. By country =Australia= The vast majority of community medical prescriptions in Australia continue to be delivered on paper, either in printed or hand-written format. Electronic prescription in Australia is currently provided by two service providers, MediSecure and eRx. Both services can be integrated into many of the existing clinical and pharmacy prescribing software systems. Since December 2012, they have become interoperable allowing bilateral transfer of information.\\"ACCC to give green light to eRx/MediSecure deal\\" Pharmacy News, 14 February 2013. =Bangladesh= Private companies started working with electronic prescriptions. On 2017 July easypres.com launched Bangladesh‚Äôs first cloud-based electronic prescription and patient management software for Doctors in Bangladesh. Within a year, more than a thousand doctors registered for the software out of 83 thousand registered MBBS doctors in Bangladesh for this Digital prescription writing software. High court of Bangladesh issued a rule that doctors need to write the prescription in readable format meaning they need to use software of ALL caps later while writing prescription. This software also stores the medical history of patients and doctors can access these data easily from anywhere using the Internet. = Canada = On March 22, 2016, the Government of Canada allocated funds to Canada Health Infoway to develop an e-prescribing service. Infoway is working with Health Canada, the provinces and territories and industry stakeholders to create PrescribeIT, a multi-jurisdiction e-prescribing service. Infoway will create, operate and maintain the service, along with its partners. The service will be financially self-sustaining and is designed to be scaled across the country and will enable prescribers to electronically transmit a prescription to a patient‚Äôs pharmacy of choice. Physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners and other prescribers will be able to use the system either through their existing electronic medical record or through a standalone application. Health Canada included supporting better prescribing practices, including e-prescribing, as part of its Action on Opioid Misuse plan. Until recently in Canada, it was the position of Health Canada that, to allow for e-prescribing, amendments to Part C of the Food and Drugs Regulations made under the Food and Drugs Act, regulations made under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and possibly regulations made under Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act would be required. After further review, Health Canada has concluded that there are currently no regulatory impediments to moving ahead with electronically generated and transmitted prescriptions and that these are permissible to the extent that they achieve the same objectives as written prescriptions. Provinces and territories wishing to proceed with e-prescribing are obligated to ensure that electronic prescriptions meet existing regulatory requirements and achieve the same objectives as written prescriptions. For example, there must be evidence of a genuine practitioner/patient relationship, and in the case of controlled substances, pharmacists filling prescriptions must verify prescriptions are signed by the practitioner before selling or providing drugs containing controlled substances to a patient. Health Canada has collaborated with Canada Health Infoway on the development of a technical document entitled Ensuring the Authenticity of Electronic Prescriptions, in order to provide advice about how to ensure the authenticity of electronic signatures. =Czech Republic= The Czech healthcare system is moving towards a mandatory electronic prescribing system to take effect in 2020. Patients and clinicians will have access to the prescribing records. Codes and names of medications are allocated by the State Institute for Drug Control. =Estonia= Electronic prescriptions were introduced in Estonia in January 2010 and by mid-2013, 95% of all prescriptions in the country were being issued electronically. =Europe= The use of electronic prescription has been designated as an important strategic policy to improve health care in Europe. The aim of the European Union is to have a cross-border electronic healthcare system in Europe which will enable EU citizens to obtain e-Prescriptions anywhere in Europe. The Scandinavian countries are leading Europe in deploying e-Prescription. Other countries which use the prescription process routinely are Norway, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Belgium,https://recip-e.be/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/paper-mn-2014-12-08b.pdf the Netherlands, Italy, Iceland, Greece, England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The European Union is pushing for more cross border health data exchange. Despite favourable attitudes towards cross border e-Prescriptions Use Case ePrescription EU Working Draft 10https://www.dragon1.com/content/visualization/470117/eprescription-Use- Case-working-draft-10, multiple perceived barriers impede its incorporation in clinical practice. There are varying interpretations and implementations of data protection and confidentiality laws in the 27 member states. Infrastructures are not in place to support the system and stakeholders in some jurisdictions are reluctant to embrace e-health due to the high cost and the lack of security of the systems. Member states have varying degrees of health care policy, privacy enforcement and laws concerning data protection, telecommunication services and digital signature with regards to e-Prescription. Interoperability of different systems is only a partial solution. Security and enforcement of privacy must also be equally enforced.Kierkegaard, P. (2013), \\"E-Prescription across Europe\\". Health and Technology, 3 (1), pp. 1-15. =India= In India some private hospitals started using electronic prescription. But a major step was taken by government of West Bengal in August 2014 when they started the process of issuing e-prescriptions instead of hand-written instructions in top government hospitals. The biggest advantage of the system is that a patient has all his medical data stored in the server of state health department which can be referred to in future. In the private sector number companies have initiated to build software to support Electronic Prescription in India. ERXPAD.COM is one among the pioneer player offer cloud based electronic prescription software (erx) in India. = Russia = With the development and implementation of electronic technologies in Russian healthcare system, electronic prescription became part of the project called EMIAS. EMIAS is the digital system designed to increase the quality and access of the medical aid in the public health facility. The project was designed and being implemented as part of ¬´Digital city¬ª program in execution of the Moscow Government's order from April 7, 2014 (as Moscow government amended on 21.05.2013 ‚Ññ 22-PP). The system offers special portal Emias.Info, that provides appointment service to the patients and client area with different services including e-Prescription. Government social program allows getting pharmaceutical products for free or with the discount, depending on the category of the citizen. =United Kingdom= About 420 million repeat prescriptions are generated in the UK each year - about 200 for each general practitioner each week. They account for about 80% of the cost of medication in primary care. Paper based Repeat Dispensing Services were introduced by the NHS in 2005, and in 2009 it became possible to use the NHS Electronic Prescription Service for this purpose. In 2017 awareness of the scheme among patients was low. In October 2017 Keith McNeil, NHS England's chief clinical information officer demanded that NHS hospitals should be moved rapidly onto electronic prescribing in the light of research showing it would cut serious prescribing errors by more than half. There was no information about the extent to which it is happening in hospitals. After successful pilots in London and the East Midlands it was agreed in April 2018 that electronic prescribing should be introduced in all urgent care settings in England, including NHS 111 and other Out-of-hours services so that dispensed medication can be ready for collection at a pharmacy when patients arrive. ¬£78 million was allocated in December 2018 to encourage progress with implementing electronic prescribing in NHS organisations which were struggling. See also NHS Electronic Prescription Service = United States = In the United States, the HITECH Act promotes adoption of this technology by defining e-prescribing as one meaningful use of an electronic medical record. Standards for transmitting, recording, and describing prescriptions have been developed by the National Council for Prescription Drug Programs, in particular the SCRIPT standard, which describes data formats. Elsewhere in the world, health care systems have been slower to adopt e-prescribing standards. Adoption of e-prescribing technology has accelerated in the United States, in large part, due to the arrival of Stage 2 of meaningful use. One of the Stage 2 core measures is: \\"Generate and transmit permissible prescriptions electronically (e-Rx.)\\" In order to meet this measure, practices must prescribe and transmit at least 50 percent of permissible prescriptions electronically.\\"Meaningful Use Stage 2 Crib Sheet\\" Physicians Practice, September 2012. According to data released in May 2012 by Surescripts, a company which operates the nation's largest health information (e-prescribing) network, roughly 317,000 office-based physicians now e-prescribe in the United States.\\"Safe E-Prescribing: A Primer for Practices\\" Marisa Torrieri, Physicians Practice, October 2012. A more recent report released by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT in June 2012 finds that 48 percent of U.S. physicians use e-prescribing systems.

Far right is the former Portal de Mercaderes. All buildings will be decorated for the 2010 Bicentenario celebrations The Mexico City administrative buildings are two buildings on the south side of the Z√≥calo in Mexico City divided by the avenue Avenida 20 de Noviembre. They house offices of the governing authority of Mexico City. The building to the west of 20 de Noviembre is the older one and has been the site of city administration since the Conquest. The one to the east is newer, built in the 20th century. Federal District Similar to other capital cities, like Washington, D.C., Mexico City is considered as belonging to the nation, rather than being part of a particular state. What is now the federal district used to be principally part of the State of Mexico until 1824, when the Mexican Congress decided to put the capital in Mexico City. At the time, the State of Mexico had its headquarters in the old Palace of the Inquisition (Now the Museum of Medicine) but then had to move to Texcoco. The government of Mexico City and the Federal District are one and the same, causing Mexicans to use the terms interchangeably. While it is still considered under federal jurisdiction, recently, changes have been made, such as the allowing of direct elections of the Chief or \\"mayor\\" of the District. Original town hall The 1720‚Äì1724 built Palacio del Ayuntamiento or Palacio de la Diputaci√≥n (L'Illustration, 1862). The 1910‚Äì1930 remodeled Palacio or \\"old\\" Federal District building The first local authority in New Spain was the ayuntamiento (district council) of Villa Rica in Veracruz, established where Hern√°n Cort√©s came ashore in the early 16th century. The governing council moved to Coyoac√°n, near Mexico City, after the fall of the Aztec city Tenochtitlan. The ayuntamiento moved here after the first town hall was built between 1526 and 1532, with the first recorded council meeting here in 1526. It was built as a fortress against the Indians, who were forbidden to settle in the area. It had a large meeting room, a scrivener's room to keep records, another for accounting, and audience hall, a chapel and a sacristy. This building also housed a government-controlled butchers and granary Since then, the governing body and building have gone by several names including the \\"Casas Consistoriales\\", the \\"Casas de Cabildos\\", the \\"Palacio de la Diputaci√≥n\\", the \\"Sala de Cabildos\\" and the \\"Consejo Consultivo de la Ciudad.\\" The building was expanded in 1582. In 1582, a jail was added, the first such in New Spain. Other functions were added to the building such as a coin-making facility, a foundry and residences. This building was destroyed, along with the National Palace in the famine uprising in 1692 . As the building burned, its archives were saved by Carlos de Sig√ºenza who, with the help of friends and paid servants threw them out of the windows as the building burned, saving records going back to 1524 In 1714, viceroy Fernando de Alencastre, 1st Duke of Linares ordered the building reconstructed. Work began in 1720 under viceroy Baltasar de Z√∫√±iga, 1st Duke of Ari√≥n, who managed to have the portals built. The rest of the building was completed in 1724 under viceroy Juan de Acu√±a, marqu√©s de Casafuerte. The official corn and meat markets located here were abolished and the free market was allowed to take control of these commodities. This resulted in a bustling market in what was the Alley of the Diputaci√≥n, now 20 de Noviembre. However, these stalls disappeared by 1888. Mural celebrating the founding of Mexico City In 1910, the building was remodeled for the upcoming centennial of Independence by architect Manuel Gorozope and engineer Guillermo Beltr√°n. The remodeled building was inaugurated on 16 September (independence day) 1910. However, remodeling work went on from 1912 to 1930 with the addition of the main staircase, the library and the archives, even though work was periodically halted because of the Mexican Revolution. In 1921, another floor was added as well as square towers on the corners on both sides of the main facade. This front facade has talavera tile murals with the coats of arms of Coyoac√°n, where the ayuntamiento was before here, of the founding of Mexico City, of Christopher Columbus, of Hernan Cortes, of Mexico City as authorized by Charles V and of Villa Rica de la Vera Cruz. In some places, some of the foundations of the original building can still be seen. In 1948, the district council moved from here to the new building built next door, but it moved back here in 1997. The exterior of the building is topped by two square corner towers, each containing three small arches, whose balustrade appears to spill over the pediments and the eagles that overlook the Zocalo. Salon de Cabildos The interior has large powerful arches, with richly decorated moulding at the main entrance. These lead to a double arcade covering a monumental staircase created by architect Alvaro Aburto. On each side of the stairwell are two patios surrounded by arches and columns. The left patio is done in Venetian- style mosaics with images fruits and vegetables as well as large pitchers. The right side patio is home to the Salon de Cabildos, which was recently restored and open for public viewing. It was the place that the city council traditionally convened to settle local disputes. The entry hall to the Salon contains a gallery of portraits of all 62 Spanish viceroys. Edificio de Gobierno building The 1941‚Äì1948 built \\"new\\" Federal District Building This building is next to the National Palace and the Supreme Court building. After demolition of the old colonial-period Portal de las Flores in 1935, the current structure was built between 1941 and 1948 and designed to fit in with the rest of the architecture of the Zocalo, as well as to be symmetrical with the \\"old\\" Palace of the Ayuntamiento next door. The Portal de las Flores (Portal of the Flowers), named so either because its original owner's name was Flores, but since later it housed markets selling fresh flowers, vegetables and fruit from outlying areas, it is commonly held as the origin of the name This Portal was rebuilt in 1724 and remained the site of markets and stores until the 19th century. The 18th century building was demolished in 1935, helping to open up 20 de Noviembre Street and clearing way for the current building. Building damaged after Mexico City 1985 earthquake. The outside of the building has relatively sober decoration with windows framed in white stone, parapets with windows and square columns. The \\"mini-balconies\\" of the windows are done in wrought iron and the corners of the third floor have estipite columns. In 1985 this building suffered damages due to the Mexico City earthquake and was remodeled and restructured. A plaque inside the building commemorate that works. The interior of the vestibule is simple dominated by the main stairwell. This stairwell contains two large murals depicted the history of Mexico from the pre-Hispanic period to just past the Revolution. Both were painted by Carlos Montuy in 1986 . When the current edifice was being built, they found the remains of the house of Do√±a Marina or La Malinche and that of the wife of treasurer Alonso de Estrada. Further down, they found a \\"tlachtli\\" or Aztec ball game field, a chacmool and other archeological finds. Government offices A number of Federal District department or secretariats are housed in the two buildings. In the original building are housed the \\"Jefatura de Gobierno\\" (offices of the Chief of the District), the Secretar√≠a de Gobierno (Secretariat of the Government), and the \\"Secretar√≠a de Medio Ambiente\\" (Secretariat of the Environment). In the newer building are housed the \\"Oficialia Mayor\\" (Government Oversight), the Secretar√≠a de Desarrollo Social (Secretariat of Social Development), the Secretar√≠a de Obras y Servicios (Secretariat of Works and Services) and the Secretar√≠a de Protecci√≥n Civil (Secretariat of Civil Protection). Politics and culture The Chief of the Federal District since 2012 is Miguel √Ångel Mancera. While the Old Town Hall is overshadowed by the National Palace and Mexico City Cathedral, it has been the scene of some political and social events. In December 2007, microbus operators protested there for a number of days until District Chief Marcelo Ebrard promised to meet with them about their demands for higher tariffs. In the same year, the city sponsored a light show projected onto the side of the building, representing different eras in Mexico City's history. It was called \\"Mexico DF: una historia en luz\\" (Mexico, Federal District: a history in light). The show included images and music. President of Spain Jos√© Luis Rodr√≠guez Zapatero visited the old Palace in 2007 as well, praising Mexico City as the vanguard of social change for the country as he was given the keys to the city.

At the summit stands a small, wooden, one room fire lookout belonging to the National Park Service. The lookout is from the nearest road and overlooks miles of forest and numerous other peaks. Jack Kerouac spent 63 days during the summer of 1956 as a fire lookout on Desolation Peak. He wrote about his experiences in The Dharma Bums, Lonesome Traveler, Desolation Angels and in a collection of haiku by the name of \\"Desolation pops\\". Interior of Desolation Peak Lookout, with bed and firefinder. Desolation Peak Trail, is a steep hike to high meadows, great views and the fire lookout. It is a very popular hike but strenuous along the East Bank Trail. The trail is often hot and dry. In 2020 Lindsay Hagen published a short film about Jim Henterley, one of the watchmen remaining in service on the Desolation Peak Lookout. Climate Desolation Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, spires, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. The view of Hozomeen Mountain from Desolation Peak During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

History Ravenswoud was founded as a peat-cutter settlement in 1850. Having this origin, the owners of the peat- rich earth hired workers to undo the soil of peat. In 1871 the first house was built and the first petition for a school came in 1881. After the first world war the population increased due to the building of houses by the local housing association. By relocating typically a-social families to here, the village got a bad reputation. Their decrepit houses were demolished around 1949 and the land was sold to the government or private buyers. A memorable moment was known with the progression of the second world war. In the war waged village, Jewish refugees were actively hidden in the town's school attic. The school principal stimulated this and supplied the refugees with food and water. As it was found out, the principal and the Jewish refugees were executed instantly. This act of resistance has been commemorated by renaming the street he lived in and the school he taught.

He is noted for his documentary films related to xenophobia. Biography Maseko was born in exile in 1967. After moving to the United Kingdom, he graduated from the National Film and Television School in Beaconsfield in 1994. Maseko's first film was the documentary Dear Sunshine, released in 1992. He participated in several MK guerrilla campaigns. He moved to South Africa in 1994 and wrote The Foreigner, a short fiction film about xenophobia in this country. In 1996, after Maseko drove to his house, an unknown assailant pointed a gun at the director and fired twice. He fled after the gun did not fire. A few minutes later, he called his house, and the assailant was on the phone. He \\"thought [Maseko was] a foreigner. We are a vigilante group going around killing foreigners. We don't want them here.\\" In 1998 he directed The Life and Times of Sarah Baartman, a 53-minute documentary film about a woman named Sarah Baartman in colonial times. Set between 1810 and 1815, the documentary relates the true story of a 20-year-old woman travelling to London from Cape Town. The woman is taken to France in 1814 and from then on became a subject of scientific investigation. Maseko's cinematic techniques were employed to depict the woman as a sub-human species, emphasising the racial prejudice against black Africans in Europe during imperialist times. Critically acclaimed, it garnered many awards including Best African Documentary, 1999 at the Pan-African Film Festival (FESPACO), Best Documentary at the 1999 Milan African Film Festival and an award at the 2001 African Literature Association Conference Film Festival. Other short films by Maseko include The Return of Sarah Baartman, Children of the Revolution, and A Drink in the Passage, all released in 2002. The latter won the Special Jury Award at FESPACO. His first feature film was Drum, released in 2004. Set in 1950s Johannesburg, it tells of the magazine of the same name and specifically focuses on Henry Nxumalo, a journalist protesting apartheid. He received the top prize at FESPACO, the Golden Stallion of Yennenga, in addition to a cash prize of 10 million CFA francs (US$20,000) at its closing ceremony in 2005, the first South African to do such. The filmmaker is currently working on the television series Homecoming, following the adventures of three MK fighters trying to fit in with the rest of South Africa. Maseko is also working on Liverpool Leopard, which is to be his second feature film.

He was one of the first South Koreans to be capped for their country at international level. He was the goalkeeper of the South Korea national team who appeared at the 1948 Summer Olympics, 1954 FIFA World Cup and 1954 Asian Games. After retiring, he was an international football referee from 1957 to 1967. In later life, Hong went blind due to complication of diabetes mellitus, which already had an impact on his eyesight during his professional years, requiring him to wear glasses on the pitch. He died on 13 September 2005. Playing career In the winter of 1945, Hong left his hometown Hamhung and started his football career at Korea University. On 11 April 1947, Seoul FC, temporary national team before the Republic of Korea was established, arrived in Shanghai where they played five fixtures against Shanghai amateur football teams, and he participated in these games. Hong participated in the 1948 Summer Olympics, the South Korea's first international tournament, and contributed to first victory of their history against Mexico. However, they met the eventual champions Sweden in the quarter-finals and lost 12‚Äì0, the margin of South Korea's biggest defeat so far. He struggled in Sweden's 48 shots and was wounded in the chest after the match. Hong was selected for South Korea for the 1954 FIFA World Cup in Switzerland, the South Korea's first FIFA World Cup. South Korea qualified for the World Cup by defeating Japan in the qualification, but they got airline tickets late, and arrived in Switzerland ten hours before the start of their first match. They lost 9‚Äì0 to Hungary's \\"Magical Magyars\\" in the first match. They met Hungary with the worst condition after they took an airplane for 46 hours, and four teammates left the field during the match in exhaustion. The substitute system didn't exist in football at that time, so South Korea finished the match with only seven players. The South Korean manager Kim Yong-sik changed seven players in the second line-up by worrying about players' stamina, but they lost 7‚Äì0 to Turkey. Hong played all two matches and became the goalkeeper who conceded the most goals in a World Cup by conceding 16 goals.

Petar i Pavel) is a medieval Bulgarian Orthodox church in the city of Veliko Tarnovo in central northern Bulgaria, the former capital of the Second Bulgarian Empire. The 13th-century church lies at the foot of the Tsarevets hill's northern slopes and was reconstructed in 1981. The church is dedicated to the Christian Apostles Saint Peter and Saint Paul. It follows the cross-domed design and has a single apse. The cella is divided into three naves by two rows of columns. The columns' capitals are decorated with plastic carving and tracery. The church has a high, massive iconostasis. According to the 14th-century account of Patriarch Evtimiy, the church and the surrounding monastery were built on the order of Tsar Ivan Asen II's (ruled 1218‚Äì1241) wife Anna. After the Fall of Tarnovo to the Ottomans in 1393, the church may have become the seat of the Bulgarian Patriarchate for a brief period. It continued to be a metropolitan bishop's residence of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople during the Ottoman rule. The bishop Hilarion of Crete was buried there and his tombstone has been preserved. Three layers of frescoes inside the church have been preserved to this day. The earliest layer consists of three images of the martyrs of Edessa in the western arch dating to the mid-13th century. The second layer is the images in the narthex; it is stylistically influenced by the Italo-Cretan school from the time of the Council of Florence in the 1430s. The local bishop Ignatius took part in the council and may have propagated the idea of ecumenism. The inscriptions of the second layer are in Bulgarian and Greek. The latest layer of frescoes is that of the images in the southern gallery from the 16th century. Gallery File:Church of SS.

Produced and released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, it was the 178th Our Gang short to be released. Plot When the gang goes to Porky's house, they learn that his family is in danger of eviction unless they pay their landlord the balance remaining on their rent. The gang decides to raise the money by setting up a circus in Porky's barn, with Spanky as the ringleader. A sideshow outside introduces the kid circus' young patrons to Oogie-Boogie, the Wildman from Borneo (Buckwheat), Mademoiselle Darla, the Greatest Rattlesnake Charmer in the World, and the World's Shortest and Tallest Men (Slapsie in a beard and Sniffles on stilts). Also included in the sideshow are the Head Without a Body (Porky), and The Famous Sime and Neez Twins - two boys with their clothes stitched together, revealed as such when Violet the Goat eats the grass skirt covering the stitching. Inside the main show, the gang's circus show includes a clown act, Spanky and Leonard as \\"a couple of swell acrobats\\", and lady lion-tamer Darla. When Darla's \\"lions\\" break away and everyone scrambles to catch them, Spanky runs into the landlord, to whom he pays the rest of Porky's rent. The circus show's marquee attraction is \\"Daredevil Alfalfa\\" singing \\"The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze\\", with Alfalfa's trapeze being held aloft by a pulley system attached to a horse. When a bee turns up and spooks the horse, Alfalfa finds himself pulled and jerked through the air before finally crashing through the ceiling of the barn.

Source: Ag√™ncia Brasil. Franklin de Sousa Martins (Vit√≥ria, August 10, 1948) is a Brazilian journalist who served as Press Secretary for the government of President Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva of Brazil. He started working as a journalist at 15, as an intern in the pro-Vargas newspaper √öltima Hora. At 20, as a student of Economical Sciences at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (then University of Guanabara), Franklin was elected chairman of the Student's Executive (DCE) and, soon after, vice-chairman of the Metropolitan Union of Students, in Rio de Janeiro. By then, Martins approached then fellow student leader Jos√© Dirceu, who was to become a founding member of the Workers Party and a grey eminence behind Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva. As a youth, Martins was not only a student leader but after the 1964 coup d'√©tat in Brazil, engaged in armed struggle and urban guerrilla. In the communist group MR-8, he was known as Valdir (codename). During the military dictatorship, he had a prominent role within the movements which fought against the regime. The acts included bank robbery (then called revolutionary expropriation by the guerrilla rhethorics) and assaults on police and military. The amount was used to buy weapons and bribe authorities to release fellow militants. Franklin Martins was held in prison between October and December 1968, being released on the eve of Institutional Act#5, which dissolved the Congress, and institutionalized censorship and torture in Brazil. In September 1969, he joined and led the joint group of the MR-8 and the National Action for Liberation (ALN) which kidnapped the US ambassador Charles Burke Elbrick. The act was carried to force the junta to set free 15 political prisoners. For taking part in the kidnapping, Franklin Martins is still denied entrance in the United States, even in an official state position (along as Fernando Gabeira, who was also involved). Martins lived in Cuba, Chile and France, where he graduated at the √âcole de Sciences Sociales of the University of Paris. While in Cuba, in the Pinar del R√≠o province, he attended guerrilla lessons, learning to operate weapons, explosives and military tactics. After the general amnesty proclaimed in Brazil in 1979, Franklin Martins returned home and resumed work as a journalist. Ironically, he eventually went to work at the Globo TV network, one of the main supporters of the military regime. In 1996, he became political commentator of the broadcast news, Jornal Nacional and Jornal da Globo. In May 2006, he was suddenly dismissed by the news director, Ali Kamel. After a brief stay at rival Bandeirantes network, Martins was called by president Lula to head the Department of Social Communication, a ministry-rank post equivalent to Press Secretary. One of his main projects developed in this position was the creation of TV Brasil, the first public TV network in the nation (although formally state-owned). External linksPattern of Terror.

His father was also very active in the Jewish community, serving on the executive committee of the Jewish Education Association and serving as president of the Hebrew Free Loan Society for 27 years. He had four siblings: Roy, Alma, Edwin and David. In 1931, Durst graduated from the Horace Mann School in Riverdale, the Bronx. In 1935, he graduated from the University of Southern California, where he majored in accounting. Career In 1940, Durst joined the real estate firm, The Durst Organization, which had been founded by his father. After his father's death in 1974, Seymour became more involved in the company. The company invested in Manhattan real estate, based upon Durst's belief that one should never buy anything one cannot walk to. While on holiday in Paris, France in the early 1960s, Durst noticed a book on the history of New York City by a German author in a mom and pop bookstore. He later remarked, \\"I figured if a German wrote a book about NYC that was available in Paris, that this was an interesting subject indeed.\\" Gradually, over time, what started as a hobby resulted in a private collection that came to be known as The Old York Library. Originally housed in a brownstone on East 48th street in midtown Manhattan in the 1970s, the library later moved to another brownstone at 120 East 61st Street. After Durst's death in May 1995, the library was first relocated to the City University of New York in the historic B. Altman Building across from the Empire State Building. Currently it resides at Columbia University's Avery Architectural And Fine Arts Library where it is open to the public. Seymour Durst was vocal about his beliefs that the government should not interfere in real estate transactions. However, his son and successor, Douglas Durst, received interest-free, government-issued Liberty Bonds under Governor George Pataki, and also successfully used eminent domain to facilitate the family's growing real estate empire. The former subsidized the cost of building massive projects in both midtown and downtown Manhattan, and the latter enabled the Durst family to take holdout properties on West 42nd Street, where 4 Times Square and 1 Bryant Park would be built. Durst was also concerned with the national debt. In 1989, Durst created and installed the National Debt Clock on a Durst Organization property in order to draw attention to the then $2.7 trillion debt. For a time, the clock had to be temporarily shut down in order to add another digit as the debt continued to climb. Personal life In 1940, he married Bernice Herstein. They had four children: * Robert Durst ‚Äì implicated in three separate murders (acquitted in one but convicted of tampering with evidence by dismembering the corpse), which are fictionalized in the 2010 movie All Good Things, and the subject of a 2015 HBO series (The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst) As well as an episode of Law and Order and two episodes of Law and order SVU.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0629287/https://www.vulture.com/2015/08/law- order-svu-is-doing-a-robert-durst-episode.html * Douglas Durst ‚Äì the present chairman of the Durst Organization * Thomas Durst ‚Äì philanthropist and writer * Wendy Durst Kreeger ‚Äì philanthropist and writer Bernice Herstein Durst (September 6, 1918 ‚Äì November 8, 1950) died in 1950 at age 32 by falling or jumping off the roof of their family home in Scarsdale.

Next to John McMillan, Brown was the most important figure to education in Western Pennsylvania. Brown was born in January 1776 in Northumberland County, Pennsylvania (now part of Union County, Pennsylvania. His paternal grandfather, a native of Ireland even though he was of Scottish descent, emigrated to America in 1720 and settled in eastern Pennsylvania. His father, also named Matthew Brown, was born in 1732 and was an early settler of White Deer Valley and a soldier in the American Revolutionary War. Upon his father's death, young Matthew Brown and his brother were adopted by their father's brother, William Brown, a religious man who was a member of the Pennsylvania Legislature. Brown graduated from Dickinson College in 1794 and taught in a classical school in Northumberland County. In 1796, he began to study theology and was licensed to preach by the Presbytery of Carlisle on October 3, 1799. He held a call in Mifflin, Pennsylvania and Lost Creek within the Presbytery of Huntingdon. On October 15, 1805 he was installed as preacher of the First Presbyterian Church of Washington, Pennsylvania. He was also elected principal of Washington Academy and was a principal agent in securing its charter to become Washington College; he was elected its first president on December 13, 1806, serving that position in tandem with his pastoral duties. The reputation of the college and the prosperity of the church grew considerably under his leadership. During this time, the town of Washington had grown from a small pioneer settlement into a larger town, and he vigorously denounced the growing practices of card playing and dances in his famous \\"Serpent Sermon.\\" Brown was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1815.American Antiquarian Society Members Directory In 1817, and agreement was made between the church and Washington College that no one should supervise both institutions. Brown chose the church and resigned the presidency on April 30, 1817. He turned down offers of the presidency of Centre College and his alma mater Dickinson College to remain as pastor in Washington. He resigned that position in 1822 to accept the presidency of Jefferson College at Canonsburg. On September 25, 1822, Brown was elected the fifth president of Jefferson College, largely due to the support and influence of Rev. Dr. Samuel Ralston, who was president of the Board of Trustees of Jefferson College. He was paid an annual salary of $800. In 1824, Jefferson College established the Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia. The college erected Providence Hall between 1829 and 1832. Jefferson College graduated 770 students during his tenure. He resigned at the age of 69 in 1845 due to ill health. He died on July 29, 1853.

The band was started by singer / guitarist James Dean Brown \\"Jaw\\" Alexander after his tenure with Bobby Steele's (formerly of The Misfits) horror-punk group The Undead. Alexander had previously played guitar in punk group The Malignmen, formed in 1995. Due to creative differences, Alexander disbanded the Malignmen in 1999 and left the Undead to form The American Plague in 2001. History The American Plague has released material on a multitude of record labels, including Long Live Crime (Los Angeles), Dr. Cyclops Records (Salt Lake City), Pal-Tone Records (Baltimore), Feedback Symphony Music and Plague Records (Knoxville, Tenn.) The band's notoriety in the Southeast has led to performances with such high- profile acts as Buckcherry, Nashville Pussy, George Thorogood, The Sword, The Cramps and The New York Dolls. 2008-present On Valentine's Day 2008, The American Plague released its third full-length album Heart Attack. The 10-song album was produced and recorded by Ryan \\"Tater\\" Johnson of Universal recording artist 10 Years. Johnson has regularly appeared live with The American Plague as rhythm guitarist and was announced as an official member in 2010. In 2008 The American Plague completed a successful tour with 10 Years, Saving Abel and Fair to Midland and appeared at Bonnaroo 2008 in Manchester, Tennessee. A six- song EP, Kiss of Death (produced by Johnson), was released in 2009, followed by regional performances in and around Tennessee. The band took much of 2010 off to write and record. 5 new songs were recorded by Johnson, but have yet to be released. In December, it was announced The American Plague would record with producers Mike Watts (Hopesfall) and Steve Haigler (Pixies, Fuel, Clutch). A new song titled \\"Leviathan,\\" recorded at the Watts / Haigler session, was released in April 2011. Music videos The American Plague has released four music videos, the most recent being \\"Leviathan,\\" released in May 2011. The video, shot and edited by Travis Stevens, depicts the band performing 'live' in a padded room. For the title track video to the album Heart Attack the band performed in a \\"party truck\\" driven by actor David Keith (An Officer and a Gentleman, Firestarter, U-571). Other videos include \\"Highwayman\\" (depicting singer Alexander as a maniacal hitchhiker) and \\"War Song,\\" both directed by independent filmmaker Scott W.

He was born and died in Frankfurt am Main.  Life  Hoch came from a family which had been in Frankfurt am Main for generations. All four of his grandparents had lived there. His father, the lawyer Johann Peter Hieronymus Hoch (1779 - 1831), was a magistrate and senator who, in 1829, became mayor of the Free City of Frankfurt. His mother, the Swiss-born Ottilie von Sodenstern, was also the child of a magistrate and senator. He began to learn piano and violin at a young age. Like his father before him, Hoch studied law and received the degree of Doctor of Law. At the age of 41 he married the Baroness Ottilie von Sodenstern, who would outlive him by 48 years. She died in Kassel in 1922. The couple had no offspring. He inherited a large fortune from both sides of his family. He decided early on, with banker Johann Friedrich St√§del as his model, to bequeath enough money to his city to found an institute for education in the arts. Before he made a trip to in England in 1843, he made a first version of a will with this intention, which was completed on July 14, 1857.

His role in the story is that of Catherine Earnshaw's husband. He resides at Thrushcross Grange and falls prey to Heathcliff's schemes for revenge against his family. Edgar is the father of his and Catherine's daughter, Catherine Linton, and the brother of Isabella Linton. He is the foil of Heathcliff as a character, as shown by his tender, kind, loving, gentle, and weak personality as opposed to Heathcliff's savage, tyrannical nature.  Description  Edgar Linton is regarded as the complete opposite of Heathcliff. Edgar has fair hair, pale skin, and blue eyes, and leads a quiet life at Thrushcross Grange, a home of peace and goodwill until Heathcliff's return. Edgar is said to be constitutionally weak, as is the case throughout the Linton family. Edgar becomes very distressed when he realizes that he cannot match the fire and passion of his wayward wife and her soul mate, Heathcliff. Edgar loves Catherine dearly despite her passion for Heathcliff, and adores their daughter, Cathy, who is named after his wife. When Edgar's sister, Isabella, marries Heathcliff, Edgar insists that he will no longer haith her, and that they are brother and sister only in name. His features are described within Wuthering Heights' as such: > Mrs. Dean raised the candle, and I discerned a soft-featured face, > exceedingly resembling the young lady at the Heights, but more pensive and > amiable in expression. It formed a sweet picture. The long light hair curled > slightly on the temples; the eyes were large and serious; the figure almost > too graceful.

History In 1472, when his older brother John, Duke of Viseu, died without issue, Diogo inherited his titles and estates as Duke of Viseu and Duke of Beja. Diogo was a popular personality at the court of his cousin King John II, and together with Duke Fernando II of Braganza, he was the main target of King John's centralization policies. John II sought to limit the power of the upper nobility, which had increased greatly during the reign of John's father Afonso V of Portugal. Duke Fernando II of Braganza, husband of Isabella of Viseu, the sister-in-law of King John II of Portugal and Diogo's sister, was the first victim of John's efforts against the Portuguese nobility. He was imprisoned, tried and executed in √âvora. Once his sister Eleanor of Viseu was married to the king, Diogo thought he was protected from the king's anger. On two occasions, the king's life was in danger and as Diogo of Viseu remained the leader of the upper nobility against the King's policies, John II accused him of high treason and personally killed him. After the execution, King John II called the duke's younger brother, Infante Manuel of Viseu, and showed him his brother's body. He promised Manuel that he would consider him his own son. At that moment, Manuel inherited his brother Diogo's titles and estates. Duke Diogo never married, but when he was quite young he visited the Crown of Castile, where he had a love affair with Do√±a Leonor de Sotomaior y Portugal (great- granddaughter of King Pedro I of Portugal). With her he had a natural son, Afonso de Portugal. King Manuel I of Portugal granted this nephew, Afonso de Portugal, the position of 8th Constable of Portugal.

In August 1865, Dr. Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister applied a piece of lint dipped in carbolic acid solution to the wound of an eleven-year-old boy at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, who had sustained a compound fracture after a cart wheel had passed over his leg. After four days, he renewed the pad and discovered that no infection had developed, and after a total of six weeks he was amazed to discover that the boy's bones had fused back together, without the danger of suppuration.

A History of Health, lifebuoy.com One of the distinctive features of this soap is its deep pink to red color, which was and still is added to the soap to designate it as Carbolic Soap. The addition of the red color was deemed important due to the fact that when Carbolic Soap was first introduced to the general public it was the only germicidal soap available.

Plot Babu, along with his friends Bruce and Rhonda, explore many of the same issues that very young children face, such as wanting to win, feeling silly, or not knowing how much is \\"too much\\" of a good thing. As the story illustrating the day's theme is played out, the narrative occasionally pauses so that the live-action preschoolers can suggest a course of action for the puppet characters to take, and often the puppets will react to the advice they receive.

The incentive for the exporter results from the conditioning of the core transaction to the acceptance of the offset obligation.Ianakiev, Gueorgui (2014), \\" Defence Offsets : Regulation and Impact on the Integration of the European Defence Equipment Market \\", in Bellais, Renaud (ed) (2014), \\"The Evolving Boundaries of Defence : An Assessment of Recent Shifts in Defence Activities \\", Emerald Group Publishing Limited. Offset agreements often involve trade in military goods and services and are alternatively called: industrial compensations, industrial cooperation, offsets, industrial and regional benefits, balances, juste retour or equilibrium, to define mechanisms more complex than counter-trade. Counter- trade can also be considered one of the many forms of defense offset, to compensate a purchasing country.Counter-trade is an indirect offset. As a general introduction to the topic see J. Brauer -J. P. Dunne Arms Trade Offsets and Development, 2005 (Martin, 1996, Udis and Maskus, 1991). The main difference between a generic offset and counter-trade, both common practices in the international defense trade, is the involvement of money. In counter- trade, goods are paid through barters or other mechanisms without the exchange of money, while in other generic offsets money is the main medium of exchange. Definition Offsets can be defined as provisions to an import agreement, between an exporting foreign company, or possibly a government acting as intermediary, and an importing public entity, that oblige the exporter to undertake activities in order to satisfy a second objective of the importing entity, distinct from the acquisition of the goods and/or services that form the core transaction. The incentive for the exporter results from the conditioning of the core transaction to the acceptance of the offset obligation. Often, the proclaimed aim of this process is to even-up a country's balance of trade. However, some forms of offsets transactions do not represent trade flows going from the initial importer towards the initial exporter. Offsets are frequently an integral part of international defense contracts.http://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/cpic/ic/offsets_of_foreign_military_sales.html =Offset as unfair burden= The U.S. government's definition of offset agreement is the most crucial, since the U.S. aerospace and defense industry is the biggest exporter of aerospace and defence products,\\"Aerospace Exports by Country\\" and therefore engaged in the majority of the world's offsets. The U.S. has a Commerce Department Division, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), that deals specifically with U.S. defense offset agreements with foreign nations as a main subset of U.S. industrial security. BIS - whose main task is protecting U.S. security from the point of view of export of high technology, fostering commercially acceptable U.S. foreign policy, and protecting U.S. economic interests - deals with U.S. aerospace and defense companies that export defense products, systems or services, involving \\"offset agreements,\\" that is, those sales' collateral or additional agreements requested by purchasers. BIS defines offsets as \\"mandatory compensations required by foreign governments when purchasing weapon systems and services.\\"BIS, Annual Report, 2006 p. 28. See also the definition: \\"Offset: Compensation practices required as a condition of purchase in either government-to-government or commercial sales of \\"defense articles\\" and/or \\"defense services\\" as defined by the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. ¬ß 2751, et seq.) and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (22 C.F.R. ¬ß¬ß 120-130). ‚Äì BIS, 2007. For a Glossary on Defense Offsets see Appendix E, p. 30 The U.S. government underlines the compulsory aspect of this trade practice, since the United States, with other weapons exporting countries, such as Germany and France, opposes offsets as forms of protectionism and harmful transgressions of free market rules. These governments frown on offset agreements, consider them to be both market distorting and inefficient.In 2002, U.S. companies had 49% of global defense industry export, EU% 35. Data from AECMA 2002 Facts and Figures.. See also . In 2007, according to SIPRI open source data, the U.S. percentage of global export in arms was 61%. = Offset as partnership = In 2008 the Brazilian Minister of Strategic Affairs, speaking of a major defense purchase by his country, highlighted this key point: ‚ÄúWe will not simply be buyers or clients, but partners.‚Äù; Roberto Mangabeira Unger, Brazilian Strategic Affairs Minister up to June 2009, now Harvard University professor. The competition by different companies ‚Äúin offering comparable weapons to a country\\" is also on the level of ‚Äúsharing‚Äù or ‚Äúpartnership‚Äù with the purchaser, Roberto Mangabeira Unger added. = Offset as marketing tool = In weapons trade, defense contractors are fully aware that offsets are powerful marketing tools to motivate the purchase, by showing and giving additional advantages for the purchasing country besides investing in military equipment.Lloyd J. Dumas, Do offsets mitigate or magnify the military burden? in J. Brauer - J.P. Dunne, Arms Trade and Economic Development. Theory, Policy, and Cases in Arms Trade Offset London-New York, 2004, The U.S. defense industry position seems to be more practical, and somewhat quietly nonaligned with U.S. government economic or political assessment of defense offsets. Generally speaking, one can understand offsets as a widespread sales technique. As such, they are not restricted to weapons sale, they belong to commerce itself, in the same way that rebates, price-pack deals, or loyalty rewards programs do. Understanding \\"defense offsets\\" to be part of a sales technique helps to curb the justified yet excessive emphasis on their mandatory nature. Often, defense offsets are more motivating than the primary defense acquisition, for personal or political reasons. This may seem irrational, but it is part of commerce. If one adds the prevalent political aspect of spending huge public funds on modern weapons, then the motivating significance of defense offsets could not be underestimated in contemporary decision processes of democracies.Markunsen describes (and opposes) defense offsets not as economy or politics, but as \\"political economy.\\" Most EU countries have their Ministries of Economy in charge, or at least heavily involved in, the offset business, since they understand offsets precisely as \\"political economy.\\" Prime defense contractors are well aware of offsets' power in the psychologies of democracies. As anyone can understand, the seller will include the cost of the \\"Envelope B,\\" that is, of the offset and its added value for the purchaser, in its total cost. In other words, the client will pay for the offset; it is not a free lunch.And the connected question: are defense offsets a benefit to the buyer greater than a negotiation for a weapons acquisition off-the-shelf? See on this point J. Brauer and J.P. Dunne, Arms Trade and Economic Development. Theory, policy, and cases in arms trade offsets. Routledge, Abingdon - New York 2004 But the key question is: to what extent is the offset proposal a factor in the consideration of defense contractor's tender during the evaluation and the decision procedures? Transparency International clearly summarizes that using offsets as marketing tools makes offsets \\"the ideal playground for corruption\\": The universe of this military niche of offsets trade is sophisticated and less innocuous than commonly believed. In 2000 Daniel Pearl wrote an article about the universe of offsets: \\"could the sale of U.S. weapons in the Persian Gulf help an oil concern unload gasoline stations in Europe? Yes, under the new logic of international arms deals.\\"April 20, 2000 - Offset Requirements Of Defense Deals Often Have Little To Do With Purchaser  By Daniel Pearl ‚Äì Staff Reporter of the Wall Street Journal Pearl describes the new-found world of indirect offsets: The market size of the international offset business is related to the volume of international weapons trade in the world. According to SIPRI, in 2007 there were US$51 billion of weapons exports, an approximate value because it is open source, and not all weapons deals data are open source information.  Defense offset example  right As an example of a defense offset proposal, we could describe a hypothetical case of Nation P (Purchaser) buying 300 tanks from defense company S (Seller, of Nation S).See also U.S. Bureau for Industry and Security's example to explain the offset. BIS Annual Report 2007, p. 136. The total sale contract is $400 million and Nation P (Purchaser) requests offset of 120%. Defense Company S (Seller) is obliged to fulfill an offset equal to 120% of the sales contract, that is $480M. Nation P agrees on a list of specific offset deals and programs to fulfill the agreed total obligation with Company S (Seller). The offset agreement includes both direct and indirect offsets. Nation P also assigns a credit value for each typology of offsets offered by Company S. The credit value for the offset obligations is not the \\"actual value,\\" but it is the \\"actual value\\" by a multiplier, that expresses the degree of interest of Nation P (Purchaser) in the proposed offsets. In other words, something deemed very valuable by nation P will have a high multiplier that expresses the importance and the value to Nation P of that type of offset. The multiplier (for instance 2, or 5, or 7) translates nation P's attached value into the credit value that eventually accounts for the fulfillment of the agreed sum of $480M (120% of offset); it is evident that with no multipliers, 120% offset would be nonsense. Most of the offset packages are divided into direct and indirect offsets. Here is a hypothetical, complex offset offer, divided into direct and indirect offsets in Nation P. right Direct Offsets (military and related to the product of the Company S, i.e. the tanks in this example) :Co- production: Nation P chooses one or more local companies to manufacture some components of the tanks, such as turrets and some of the internal components. The actual value of the components is $70 million. Nation P assigns a multiplier of 3, since this develops capabilities of its military industrial base and creates jobs in Nation P. The total credit value for the fulfillment of the overall offset obligation is $70M x 3 = $210M. Indirect Offsets (civilian and other agreements not related to the production of the weapons item, the tanks. They could be also military or security related, but not directly connected with the main acquisition, i.e., the tanks) :Foreign Direct Investments: Company S makes investments in 5 (defense or non-defense) companies in Nation P. The total value of the investments is $14.5M, and the multiplier is 4, a high multiplier, since Nation \\"P\\" suffers from a chronic lack of Foreign Direct Investments. This makes an additional credit value for Company S of $58M. :Technology Transfer: Company S provides water desalination technologies to one Nation P company. This technology is particularly appreciated by Nation \\"P\\". Its actual value is $20M, but the credit value is 7 times the actual value, that is, $140M. :Export Assistance and Marketing: Company S provides commercial assistance to market products and services of a Nation \\"P\\" company in a difficult market, such as, for instance, the Middle East. The assistance is offered for 8 years, at the value of $3M per year. Nation P considers this assistance to export as important to create new revenue streams and jobs for its company, and sets a multiplier of 3. Credit value: $72M. (Since company S is not an expert on marketing and export assistance, it may hire a specialist company to subcontract the job. Such a subcontractor is also known as an \\"offset fulfiller\\"). Nation P controls not only the supply of the military systems or services, but also the implementation of the offsets according to the offset agreement included or related to the main supply contract. This control is within the Minister of Defense and/or Ministry of Economy or Finance, or Ministry of Industry and Trade. Often arms importing nations establish special agencies for the supervision of the defense offsets.The example above is a simplified and graphic version of one of the best examples of offsets by the U.S. Department of Commerce: \\"OFFSET EXAMPLE: This example is for illustrative purposes only and in no way represents an actual offset agreement. The fictitious nation of Atlantis purchased ten KS-340 jet fighters from a U.S. defense firm, PJD Inc. (PJD), for a total of $500 million with a 100 percent offset. In other words, the offset agreement obligated PJD to fulfill offsets equal to the value of the contract, or $500 million. The government of Atlantis decided what would be required of PJD in order to fulfill its offset obligation, which would include both direct and indirect compensation. The government [of Atlantis] also assigned the credit value for each category.\\" BIS example then illustrates the fulfillment of the offset agreement with direct and indirect offset. See U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security Offsets in Defense Trade, Eleventh Report to Congress, 2007, Appendix G, Glossary and Offset Example Types of offset Offset proposals often make a distinction between direct and indirect offset.\\"Offset comes in different types, the most basic division being: : Direct offsets: Transactions that are directly related to the defense items or services exported by a defense firm ‚Äì the supplying prime of offset. : Indirect offsets: Offset transactions that are not directly related to the defense items or services exported by the supplying prime. These are further subdivided into: ::Defense (related) indirect offsets ::Non-defense (related) indirect offsets. Final Report of 06-DIM-022 Study on the effects of offsets on the Development of a European Defence Industry and Market By E. Anders Eriksson with contributions by Mattias Axelson, Keith Hartley, Mike Mason, Ann-Sofie Sten√©rus and Martin Trybus, 12 July 2007. The study was financed by the European Defense Agency and contracted to FOI and SCS. , p.3 Direct offset is a side agreement that is directly related to the main product/service that is bought/sold, that is military equipment, systems, or services. They may be also called military offsets. For example, a buyer of military equipment may be given the right to produce a component of a related technology in the buyer's country. Indirect offsets are side agreements that are not directly related to the product/service that is bought/sold. Most people refer to such category of offsets as civilian offsets, though there are many indirect offsets that are not civilian offsets. Indirect offsets may take the form of services, investments, counter-trade and/or co-production. For instance, Greek companies produce part of the Lockheed C-130 that they bought from U.S. The Greek co- production is a U.S. direct offset. Or, in a more sophisticated form of offset involving three countries, Portugal is in charge of the maintenance of Kuwaiti Lockheed Martin aircraft. This is a Portuguese \\"direct offset\\", since Portugal bought the aircraft, and is partner in charge of their maintenance.For the definition of semi-direct offset see Belgian Policy of Industrial Compensation An investment in a security software company of Romania, or in assisting the export and marketing in difficult areas of a Belgian environmental company are other forms of actual indirect offsets. The most common types of direct/indirect offsets are: { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:300px; background:#fc9; color:black;\\" Direct offset ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:300px; background:#fbec5d; color:black;\\" Direct or Indirect offset ! scope=\\"col\\" style=\\"width:300px; background:#d4af37; color:black;\\" Indirect offset - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  style=\\"background:#fc9; color:black;\\" Co-production  style=\\"background: #FBEC5D; color: black\\" Technology Transfer  style=\\"background: #D4AF37; color: black\\" Export Assistance - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  style=\\"background:#fc9; color:black;\\" Subcontracts  style=\\"background: #FBEC5D; color: black\\"  Training  style=\\"background: #D4AF37; color: black\\"  Purchases - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  style=\\"background:#fc9; color:black;\\" style=\\"background: #FBEC5D; color: black\\"  Licensed Production  style=\\"background: #D4AF37; color: black\\"  Offset Swapping (compensation of offsets' obligation through reciprocal abatement) - style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  style=\\"background:#fc9; color:black;\\" style=\\"background: #FBEC5D; color: black\\"  Foreign Direct Investment, Credit Assistance and Financing  style=\\"background: #D4AF37; color: black\\" } The most complete and accurate list of actual offsets can be found in the BIS Annual Reports to Congress, where all forms of registered offset are codified, according to the old Standard Industrial Classification.See for instance the Offsets in Defense Trade, Sixth Study.- BIS Annual Report to Congress, 2002. . Also Appendix D: Offsets Transactions by SIC based Economic Sectors (spreadsheet) ; Recently BIS moved to NAICS  Some offset mechanisms  Since offsets typically include military departments of sovereign nations comparable to the US Defense Department, many countries have offset laws, public regulations or, alternatively, formal internal offset policies. = Defense prime contractor, offset service providers = In medium and large tenders for weapons systems the bid can be very complex, involving one or more than one company as bidder. The main offer is guided by a prime contractor that may have other companies associated to the bid as partners or as subcontractors. However, in regards to the agreed offset proposal only the prime contractor is liable toward the final client for its fulfillment. Since offsets are increasingly complex, the prime contractor may hire subcontractors to fulfill its contractual obligations. While the liability for the offsets stays with the prime contractor, the job can be executed by a subcontractor, or an offset fulfiller. One of the collateral benefits of offsets in U.S. (probably not offsetting the adverse effects of defense offsets on economy and jobs) is the proliferation of legal and economic jobs in the \\"offsets sector,\\" that goes from international legal companies to the fully staffed international offices of U.S. defense companies. In addition, the establishment of new companies in \\"offset\\" venture capital, in \\"offset\\" marketing assistance: offset fulfillers that provide their support services to the defense and aerospace industry. While many offset programs originally evolved as a result of defense and aerospace sales, today many new offset / Industrial Partnership programs have developed as a result of nations wanting to improve their industrial base, level of technology and desire to become more self-sufficient across a broad range of industry sectors. As a result of this new interest and demand for Industrial Partnership, there has been both a growth and establishment of new offset associations. There are both Global and Domestic \\"Offset\\" / Industrial Partnership organizations. The largest and most widely attended global association is GOCA, the Global Offset and Countertrade Association, whose purpose is to promote trade and commerce between companies around the world and their foreign customers through a greater understanding of countertrade and offset.To obtain a more in depth overview of offset or Industrial Partnership activities, see GOCA website . Each year GOCA hosts several industry meetings in partnership with other European and American offset organizations such as the ADS, Aerospace Defence Security and DIOA, the U.S. Defense Industry Offset Association. DIOA was established in 1985 by members of the U.S. Defense Industry to foster education, networking and guidelines for professionalism in offsets implementations. The industry meetings referenced above are attended by leading global industrial companies, companies that specialize in providing support services for Industrial Partnership fulfillment, and by various government and military authorities, mostly from national ministries of defense and economy, who oversee and monitor offset and Industrial Partnership programs. The purpose of these industry meetings is to educate, and to foster relationships between the various offset obligors and beneficiaries so that real and sustainable economic benefits can be delivered to nations who are seeking to improve their respective economies. Offsets and Industrial Partnership programs have been evolving for over three decades and there are dozens of articles that describe various successes and challenges that have resulted from implementing offset programs. The most widely read publication that deals with the developments in the Offset and Industrial Participation arena is Countertrade and Offset (\\"CTO\\").A sampling of some of the articles written include .....; See also Ann Markusen, Arms Trade as Illiberal Trade, 2004: Defense contractors as trading companies in J. Brauer - JP Donne, Arms Trade and Economic Development, 2004 Offset fulfillers /service providers may perform various support services: including marketing assistance, sourcing and structuring venture capital or other forms of corporate credit for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), or more complex things, such as a joint ventures to produce shrimp (Devcorp, Bahrain ), a sugar factory, or, recently, environment and renewable energy. = Offset certificates, penalties, confidentiality clauses, pre-offset activities = Offsets are of various durations. They may be planned to last for 1 or 2 years, but 8-10 year plans are very common; exceptionally long is an offset like Al Yamamah Program, a BAE-UK offset in Saudi Arabia in place since 1987. Clients (sovereign countries) have in place mechanisms to control their implementations, and to certificate milestone accomplishments in their offset programs. An offset supervision authority certifies the advancement in the offset completion in percentages, issuing offset certificates.Security Assistance Management Manual (SAMM) DoD 5105, Ch 5, page 247, Figure C5.F14. Offset Certificate. These certificates may be issued to prime contractors fulfilling their offset agreement, but also to offset fulfillers, that have subcontracted the job from prime contractors and registered as such in the foreign countries. When there are multipliers, such certificates express the percentage of completion in \\"credit value\\" (\\"actual value\\" X multiplier). Offset fulfillers redeems the offsets certificates through contracts or subcontracts with the prime contractor. More recently, given the importance and the growth of offset practices around the world, offset fulfillers can \\"sell\\" their certificates to prime contractors other than their initial one, as long as they have national offset commissions authorizations. In this profitable niche of defense industry made by offset specialists, lawyers and companies - there is also a \\"currency\\" and a \\"trade\\" of offset certificates. Like in any contract, there are forms of penalty for failing to complete offset obligations. Many nations have rigid systems of penalties, including the use of bank guarantees, while other nations believe in continued negotiations that are based on \\"the best effort\\" clauses. The list of incentives and penalties for offset is no different from many other systems of procurement, with two remarkable exceptions: 1\\\\. In the offset business there are two contracts proceeding in parallel, i.e. primary (A) and side (B) contract: ::A) The supply of defense equipment/services from the Defense Company to the Client (Foreign State), according to contractual specification (quality, quantity, time, etc.) ::B) The offsets progress as monitored by the same Client (Foreign State), but most of the times by a different State entity, according to contractual offset agreement (quality, quantity, time, etc.). :These two contracts impact on each other and problems with one can affect the other. However, since most offsets today are not \\"direct,\\" this may create confusions and distortions, especially due to \\"indirect offsets.\\" 2\\\\. In direct offsets contracts there are legitimate \\"clauses of confidentiality\\", that in several countries may even assume value of official classification, up to secret of state. In European Union States, however, extending state secret classifications to indirect offsets - that have nothing to do with military or state security - is considered an abuse. For instance, classifying an offset not-related to state security or military preparedness - such as indirect and civilian offsets in pharmaceutical research, environmental technologies or export assistance of any non-military/security products - leads not only to major market distortions but also to possibly unpunished corruption protected by baseless secrecy.\\"Offsets are under much less scrutiny during their negotiation than the main arms deal. This holds true for both governmental scrutiny and for public awareness of such contracts. Worse, in many countries, there is almost no due diligence on potential improper beneficiaries from the offsets, no monitoring of performance on offset contracts, no audits of what was delivered compared to the pledges, and no publication of offset results, benefits or performance at all. This makes offsets an ideal playground for corruption. The lack of surveillance of the offsets contracts is amplified by their complexity. Offsets processes involve a range of complicated and detailed contracts and often include investments into a variety of companies and subsidiaries, making monitoring even more difficult.\\" Magahy, B, Vilhena da Cunha, F., Pyman, M., Defence Offsets: Addressing The Risks Of Corruption & Raising Transparency, Transparency International, (J. Muravska and A. Wegener eds.), 2010, p.2 Pre-offset activities are allowed and welcomed by several countries; they are like offsets without certainties to obtain \\"credit value\\". These activities are straight marketing activities, similar to lobbying, to promote specific defense purchases. These pre-offset activities must be registered as such with national authorities. Often pre-offset activities will receive certificates, after a sale. Defense companies include them in the marketing budget, but after the sale, these offsets go into their offset budgets, and count toward offset fulfillment.\\"Defence companies often avoid significant spending on an offset project, prior to the award of the defence contract for an obvious reason; the defence market is characterised by uncertainty - programme delays, budget overruns and economic problems at national and corporate level are common. However, there are exceptions to the rule, such as in the case of Swedish defence aerospace group Saab.\\" Keri Smith JDIN Reporter Offsets in Europe: A matter for debate Jane's Defence Weekly - November 28, 2007 These kinds of pre-offset activities are sales arguments to convince the buying state of the strength and reliability of the aerospace & defense company as potential supplier and partner. The pre-offsets arena is also the delicate and problematic field of sale-facilitators and, precisely because the client is a state, this must be monitored with additional care, since this field is prone to abuse and outright corruption. = Foreign military and direct commercial sales ‚Äì \\"no known offsets\\" and FMS = For the U.S., the major world exporter of weapons by far, there are two main ways to sell weapons to a foreign country. The first is referred to as \\"Direct Commercial Sale\\" and it is a company to government sale. The second way is referred to as \\"Foreign Military Sales\\", that is a government to government sale. A Direct Commercial Sale is highly supervised by U.S. Government and even by the U.S. Congress, in spite of its free market appearance. The arms trade, because of its connection with national security, is never free from strict government supervision.Ann Markusen, The Arms Trade as Illiberal Trade, Conference on Defense Offsets, Cape Town, South Africa, September 24-6, 2002. Ann Markunsen, Senior Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, directed also a 2 years long \\"Study Group on the Arms Trade and the Transnationalization of the Defense Industry: Economic versus Security Drivers\\" in 1998-2000 For a sale to a foreign country's Defense Department, a U.S. defense firm must be licensed. It is checked by the Defense Department and by the State Department, and, in the case of relevant sales, even authorized or vetoed by U.S. Congress. Direct Commercial Sales are highly regulated because of security, political, and commercial reasons. Even from the point of view of indirect and non-military offset agreements, U.S. Defense companies and their subcontractors (offset fulfillers) must present detailed report of their offset activities to the Commerce Department, Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS).The most insidious damages to U.S. economy are unexpected problems and losses that may arise in all economic sectors (the area of U.S. indirect offsets) to unaware U.S. companies and business. The unjustified secrecy of civilian offsets, supported by a strong defense contractors' lobby: a) prohibits a definitive evaluation of the economic successes or, alternatively, of the economic adverse effects of indirect offsets; b) creates unknown and hidden source of losses and problems for U.S. companies; c) establishes clandestine niches of business areas, unnecessarily and unjustly protected by secrecy, where abuses, violations, frauds and corruption escape laws. d) damage the concept of \\"state secret\\" by extending it to things that do not deserve such high, noble, and restricted protection. Foreign Military Sales are indirect sales of weapons produced by one or more U.S. contractors through an agency of the Department of Defense, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA). In a way, DSCA acts as Prime Contractor's agent in promoting and selling U.S. made weapons to foreign countries. The known FMS disadvantage is that DSCA adds to the final sale price a small percentage for its own administrative costs; the advantage is some free training with U.S. Armed Forces for joint international operations.U.S. Defense Department ‚Äì Defense Security Cooperation Agency: \\"Strength through Cooperation. The FMS Advantage: Frequently Asked Questions About Foreign Military Sales\\" In this type of sale, however, there are two important aspects in regards to the offset business. right 1) Since 1990, under a specific directive by President George Bush, no U.S. Federal Agency or U.S. Government employee can be involved in the offset business. To each press release about a FMS (or of any documents regarding a FMS), there is a standard disclaimer: \\"There are no known offset agreements proposed in connection with this (potential) sale.\\" All public releases by DSCA regarding FMS sales must include this disclaimer. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency acts on behalf of the prime contractor with a foreign government and refuses even the mere knowledge about offsets, but under the FMS program prime contractors are allowed to put all their offset costs into the final price.\\"Note 9. OFFSET COSTS. The Department of Defense is not a party to any offset agreements/arrangements that may be required by the Purchaser in relation to the sales made in this LOA and assumes no obligation to administer or satisfy any offset requirements or bear any of the associated costs. To the extent that the Purchaser requires offsets in conjunction with this sale, offset costs may be included in the price of contracts negotiated under this LOA. If the Purchaser desires visibility into these costs, the Purchaser should raise this with the contractor during negotiation of offset arrangements.\\" Security Assistance Management Manual (SAMM), DoD 5105, Ch.5, pag. 22 ‚Äì The cost of the offset is not even itemized in the FMS offer, and if the client wants to discuss or simply to know the cost of the offset, the client must speak directly with the Contractor and not with DSCA. In other words, U.S. Government cannot deal with offsets; U.S. Defense Prime Contractors can and do. DSCA has made available in its complete manual details and analytical explanations for U.S. Defense companies on how to include the offset various costs into their contract and invoices.See above. So prime contractors, even under FMS, are allowed to recover all costs \\"of any offsets which are associated with those contracts.\\" To be sure, \\"U.S. Government agencies may not enter into or commit U.S. companies to any offset agreement.\\" De facto during the cold war offsets had different functions and often U.S. Government Agencies were directly involved. President Bush, by ending the cold war with a victory, likewise ended U.S. agencies' liability in delicate practices like the offsets (1990), since they lost the primary political value they had during the cold war. The Lockheed bribery scandals in Japan, Germany, The Netherlands and Italy is one of the most known for the political liabilities involved in the side agreements of weapons sales. In this famous case, the involvement was of military officers and main politicians of U.S. allied countries. A more recent affair is the Belgian Dassault Agusta scandal. 2) U.S. funds assigned by United States Foreign Military Financing (FMF) that may be connected with Foreign Military Sales (FMS) cannot be used for any type of offsets, if they are non-repayable funds. On the other hand, FMF funds may be used for offset costs if they are loans. In any case, \\"U.S. Government agencies may not enter into or commit U.S. firms to any offset agreement.\\"  List of offset policies of different countries The following is a cursory survey on some countries' offset policies. It does not enter into details, and basically it gives: 1) the legal base for the offset; 2) the purchase threshold above which there is a requests for offset; 3) the requested \\"quantity\\" of offset by the country in terms of percentages of the contract value; 4) the applied multipliers, that qualify (\\"quality\\") through a number the appreciations of a certain type of offsets (the \\"Credit Value\\" of an offset is the \\"Actual Value\\" by the multiplier); 5) and some remarks or specific information, including the websites of the National Offset activities. A detailed list of the National Laws and Policies of the Countries of the European Union can be found in the website of European Defense Agency in a new \\"EU Offset Portal\\". Another very useful analysis of country policies can be found in Belgian Ministry of Economy (in charge of Belgian offsets). This publicly available document gives one of the most intelligent global analyses of countries offsets policies, with a purchaser's perspective, that is the point of view of weapons importer countries . From a similar point of view, one can see the purchaser's point of view on offsets in UAE offset web- page , in the new Kuwaiti articulated offset policy . On the seller's point of view, in Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) Annual Reports to U.S. Congress one can find the position on offsets of weapons exporters countries like U.S. Magazines and specialized publications like Jane's Defence Industry , EPICOS, Countertrade & Offset or CTO give detail accounts and updates on national policies, requests, changes, etc.  The Department of Defense (Defense Material Organization) is in charge of the offset. The threshold is 5 million Australian dollars. Multipliers go from 1 to 6. By rule, Australia does not accept indirect (civilian) offsets, unless such offsets brings benefits to the Australian Defense Industry. Austrian Eurofighter Typhoon Bundesministerium f√ºr Landesverteidigung und Sport  Offset Agreements are negotiated by the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Labor on a case-by-case basis; the percentage of offset is above 100%, up to 200% (and sometimes even more) of the contract values. Austria has one of the highest requests in the world for nominal quantity offsets. However, multipliers can go up to 10. The minimum value of the sale for mandatory offsets is 726,000 Euro. This high offset policy, applied to EADS Eurofighter Typhoons purchase in 2002 and still ongoing, was changed in 2008-9 when Austria signed the voluntary EU Code of Conduct on Offset. The relevant changes are the reduction of the offset quantity to 100% (that is the value of the purchase contract), the value of multipliers, and the monitoring function of the Federal Ministry of Defence and Sports  Bahrain Bahrain has no offset policy. The Kingdom imports about 80% of its weapons from U.S. via FMS, and the rest of weapons procurement comes from U.K. However, a specific offset policy is expected soon. Piranha III - Spanish Army  A Royal Decree (6/2/1997, and modified-6/12/2001) is the legal foundation of the Belgian Industrial Benefits Program. The program is directed by Ministry of Economic Affairs (Industrial Benefits in the Field of Defense Procurement ). The threshold value is usually 11 million euro, but it is lower if it is not a public and open tender. The minimum required offset is 100%. Multipliers are not specified. The focus is on high technology and new or additional business flow. The Belgian offset guidelines are very sophisticated. One of the most important and explicit points is the so-called \\"newness aspect:\\" offsets, such export assistance, \\"must create unambiguously a new or additional business flow in export\\" for Belgian companies. Belgium distinguishes three forms of offsets: direct, semi- direct, and indirect. Belgium has a specific problem with the Industrial Benefit Programme, related to the de facto split of the country into Wallonia and Flanders. Belgian offset program is more meticulous than other European countries, but Belgian citizenry is aware that paying for offsets, instead of getting weapons at off-the-shelf price, implies not-so-transparent transfers of taxpayers' money to designated Belgian companies through political decisions. One can rightly consider such offset-transfer as confidential state subsidy. Flemish parties claim that subsidies to Wallonia cost proportionally more than the price West Germany paid for East Germany.\\"The MOWAG proposal further includes a comprehensive Industrial Benefit Programme worth 100% of the contract value in Belgian value added combining direct work, semi direct effort as well as a significant commitment to other industrial sectors through indirect benefits....MOWAG notes that the industrial offsets program will be proportionally balanced between Flemish and Wallonian companies, as indeed it must in a country that is no longer a strict unitary state after the St. Michael's agreement.... Recent public complaints that the Airbus A400M program has seen 80% of its industrial benefits flow to Belgium's southern Walloon districts haven't helped matters.\\" The subsidies/offset issue was particularly acute in the repartition of direct and indirect industrial benefits for one of the recent acquisition with offsets: 242 Mowag Piranha for the Belgian Army from General Dynamics, over 700 M Euro. One of the controversial offsets connected with the Piranha III is a direct offset for the Piranha III co- production, and the disputed choice of a 90mm gun (produced by a Wallonian company) instead of 105mm NATO standard cannon.  Brazilian offset policy was formally implemented in 1990, however the practice had already been used constantly at least from 1975. Set by resolution 764, 2002, the current offset policy is dictated by the Ministry of Defense demanding offsets in purchases related to thresholds above US$5 million per year. Deriving from the MD policy, Air Force, Navy and Army have separate specific offset guidelines. The total offset request is 100% whenever possible. Multipliers are usually between 1 and 4, exceptionally 5. Brazilian offset policies emphasize technological development of its defense industry, specially aerospace, through technology transfers and training.CORREA, Gilberto Mohr.

Direct offsets are supervised by the Defense Ministry, and indirect offsets by the Ministry of Economy and Energy. There is however a Permanent Inter-Ministerial Council of Special Purpose Public Procurement to approve offset agreements. The Agency for Information, Technology and Communications (SAITC) assists and coordinates offset projects. The threshold for offset is 5 million Euro. The minimum Value is 110% of the contract value. Multipliers are between 1 and 3. Offsets are generally 30% direct and 70% indirect.  Canada's offset agreements (known as Industrial and Regional Benefits (IRB)) are managed by the IRB directorate within the Canadian government's Department of Industry. The IRB Policy was created in 1986 to assist Canadian companies in leveraging government procurement. The Policy requires that prime contractors place sub-contracts and investments in the high-tech sectors of the Canadian economy in an amount usually equal to the value of the defense contract won. Investments can be direct (transactions that give small- to medium-sized enterprises an opportunity to provide goods, services and/or long-term service support directly for the items being procured by the government) or indirect (transactions which are not directly related to the procured items and are, instead, related to investments, technology cooperation, and product mandates). . Pandur II 8x8  Offset regulations are set by Government Resolution 9 - 2005. The Ministry of Trade and Industry is in charge of Industrial Cooperation (also through an Offset Commission). The minimum value of the contract is CZK 500 million. The minimum offset percentage is 100 per cent. No multipliers are used. Offset focus is on new technologies, co- operation and technology transfer. Minimum 20% of direct offset. The Offset Commission issues Annual Reports on the status of the offsets. One of the major offset controversies in Czech Republic is about the purchase of General Dynamics Pandur II, between 2003 and 2009. In February 2010 anti-corruption police have opened an investigation. According to The Prague Post \\"the investigation will center on two main issues: the alleged bribery of politicians and the military's reasons for paying three times more for the Pandur than Portugal, which also purchased\\" the same armoured vehicle. Police launch investigation of Pandur military vehicle deal The Prague Post, 24/02/2010  Ministry of Defense makes the acquisition, but the Ministry of Business and Growth is monitoring offset implementations stipulated in the individual ICC's (Industrial Cooperation Contracts). The Guidelines for Industrial Cooperation was issued in 2014 and replaced the former Offset Law which was rejected by the European Commission. The threshold is DKK 50 million and offset requirement varies from each project up to 100%. Multipliers up to 8 can be considered for R&D; and technology or financial transfers. Denmark signed a trilateral agreement with UK and The Netherlands on \\"best practice for the application of abatements in offset\\" regarding swaps of offset obligations.  No offset law. Estonia is particularly interested in counter-trade.  No law, only public guidelines on Industrial Participation. The Ministry of Defense is in charge, Defense Materiel Industry and Industrial Participation, but with The Ministry of Trade and Industry. The minimum contract value for offsets is EUR 10 million. 100% minimum of offset requirement. Multipliers are between 0.3 and 3.0 (for Finnish export). Technology transfer multipliers are negotiated. Finland's focus is on its domestic defense industry.  No formal offset policy, but has counter- trade and offset departments in the Ministry of Economic Affairs and in the Ministry of Defense. However, France like U.S., is almost completely independent on its own military needs, and it has a minimal amount of weapon procurements from foreign countries. Agency for Defense Technology and Procurement  German official position is that offset arrangements are economically counterproductive in defense trade. However, Germany applies a policy of \\"industrial balances,\\" based on 100% of the contract value. German Federal Ministry of Defense (BMVg), and The Federal Office of Defense Technology and Procurement (Das Bundesamt f√ºr Wehrtechnik und Beschaffung - BWB, that is an Acquisition Agency):de:Bundesamt f√ºr Wehrtechnik und Beschaffung are in charge of procurement and cooperation. The Agency has a branch office for U.S. and Canada in Reston, Virginia . It is worth noting that Germany, while being the third world exporter of weapons, does not have huge \\"defense corporations\\", that is, large companies whose core business is weapons production, but civilian companies that produce weapons in addition to their main business. WT - Wehr Technik http://www.monch.com is a source of information on BWB activities. Germany has a quota of 11% of defense global export and, according to SIPRI data, between 2004 and 2009 German weapons export doubled. See also Complicit in Corruption. How German Companies bribed their Way to Greek Deals, by Joerg Schmitt in Der Spiegel Nov 5, 2010, German submarines HDW-214 for Greece (Papanikolis) and Portugal (Tridente)  Offset regulation is in the official Procurement Law, 3433/2006. The Hellenic Ministry of National Defense is in charge through the department of General Armaments Directorate (GAD), and the Division of Offsets (DO). The threshold for offset request is EUR10 million. The minimum offset requirement is between 80 and 120%. Multipliers are from 1 to 10. Greece does not accept indirect offsets, since it is focused on the strengthening of its military capabilities. According to SIPRI data for 2006‚Äì2010, Greece is the 5th weapons importer of the world, with a global quota of 4%, about half of India (9%), and two-thirds of China's import (6%). It is worth noting that Chinese GDP is about 20 times bigger than Greece's nominal GDP.SIPRI:, see also The Economist, Global Weapons Imports, 2009 Greece is the major EU importer of weapons and the first U.S. defense client in the European Union. According to K. Vasileios, editor of EPICOS, \\"currently, there are 122 open offset contracts that were signed between 1997 and 2010 but have not been executed due to various issues.\\" Greek Offsets: A new era, Kyriazis Vasileios, Epicos Newsletter Head Editor,2011  The offset legal base is a Government Decree 228/2004 and offset authority is the Ministry for National Development and Economy - Directive No. 23/2008. The threshold is HUF1 billion (3.5 Mil Euro) with a minimum offset requirement of 100%. Multipliers can go up to 15. The confidentiality clause on offsets is essentially commercial, as a normal Non-Disclosure Agreement.  No formal offset policy. Japan Defense Agency (JDA) depended directly on the Prime Minister and was in charge of defense procurement, thorough the Bureau of Equipment and the Bureau of Finance. However, since 2007 the Japan Defense Agency (JDA) has been transformed into a full Ministry of Defense, with a minister in cabinet-level decisions. Most of the Japanese defense import is from U.S., and it is regulated by bilateral agreements. The majority of defense bidding goes through the representation of Japanese trading companies, though direct bidding is theoretically possible. There is an unspoken policy for the largest Japanese companies that is an understood as \\"Buy Japanese\\" products policy. Two remarks: Japan, Germany and Italy, in spite of evident cultural differences, have similar political attitudes in \\"balancing\\" foreign weapons procurements. But Japan, in the name of political principles and then of official laws, restrained itself on weapon exports, and since the 1970s Japanese defense industry is self-confined to Japanese domestic market.  Government introduced a Defense Procurement Procedure in 2005, revised in 2006, 2008, 2011, 2013 and latest in 2016. A new round of amendments are underway (as of 2018 October). The offset policy mandates foreign suppliers to spend at least 30% of the contract value in India. The offset limit has now been increased from Rs 300 crore to Rs 2,000 crore.  Ministry of Industry, Trade and Labor is in charge of the offset policy and implementation. Threshold is US$100,000. Minimum offset request is 35%, multipliers are either 1 or 2. The main point about Israel and its offset policy is the fact that Israel has been for a long time the largest beneficiary of United States Foreign Military Financing (FMF), getting more than 50% of the entire available U.S. FMF budget.Between 2004 and 2008 the largest beneficiary was Iraq and, since 2008, Afghanistan This condition sets a limit to Israeli offsets request to U.S.  There is no public law on offsets. There is not even an official name for the offset policy. The public position is that Italy has no general offset policy, just ad hoc (offset) policies. The National Armament Directorate of Ministry of Defense is in charge of offsets, while specific internal commissions of each branch of the Italian Armed Forces (Aviation, Army, and Navy) monitor offset fulfillment. The threshold for offset is 5 million Euro. The minimum offset request is 70%, but generally goes up to 100%. The highest multiplier is 3. The focus is on export opportunities for Italian defense companies. There is no website or web-page for a nameless offset program, the closest would be the Minister of Defense website . Kuwait Offset Program  New Guidelines for Kuwait Offset Program were published in 2007, following to a Minister of Finance directive, that regards all foreign procurements related to both military and non military contracts. The National Offset Company (NOC) is a state-owned company, and its activities in the Kuwait Offset Program are on behalf of the Ministry of Finance. The offset commitment is still at 35% of the monetary value of military contracts. Threshold is KD 3m, (for civilian contracts is KD 10m.) Since 2007 there have been fundamental changes, making offsets requirements more effective and complex, including the multipliers systems, with more attention on the tangible benefits for Kuwait.  Resolution No. 918/03 of the Government of the Republic of Lithuania (15-7-03). The Ministry of Economy is in charge of offsets. The threshold is LTL 5 million, about 1.5 million euro. Minimum offset requirement of 100%. Multipliers are between 1 and 5.  Morocco, has yet no Offset policy. The only existing offset agreement has been signed with Alstom which won the contract to build Morocco's high-speed train system and which is also responsible for the construction of tram networks in Rabat and Casablanca. In January the company signed an agreement with the government that will see it establish a local production base for cabling and electronic components, creating 5000 jobs over 10 years, as well as establishing a rail sector training institute. Alstom also signalled its intention to step up purchases from Moroccan suppliers and service providers (such as local back-office offshoring services), for use in projects in other countries as well. To stimulate its industry, the government is working on a new procurement offset (compensation industrielle) policy. Under the policy reportedly being developed by the minister for industry and trade, foreign companies that win government tenders worth more than Dh200m (‚Ç¨17.69m) will be obliged to carry out local investments and purchases worth at least 50% of the value of the contracts. The measure is intended to boost the local industrial sector by ensuring that foreign companies invest locally, use local subcontractors and locally made products, and transfer technology to the country. The policy will not affect US companies, as the 2004 US-Morocco free trade agreement bars the imposition of such requirements on US firms. Since its election in 2012 as President of the CGEM Conf√©d√©ration g√©n√©rale des entreprises du Maroc, Miriem Bensaleh Chaqroun has been lobbying for the creation of a legal framework making mandatory for state controlled companies, offices, local authorities to sign offset agreements. The action was the creation of the commission compensation industrielle et acc√®s aux march√©s publics in 2012 which was headed by the former CEO of the CGEM Mehdi El Idrissi. The commission published in 2014 a Guide de la compensation industrielle in order to explain to them the concept of Offset agreements. In 2015 the CGEM made a series of proposition to the government, including the creation of an agency of the offset. The role of this agency would be: # To be the sole interlocutor in the development of offset contracts. # To guide foreign businesses to feasible projects in collaboration with Moroccan companies and sectors to promote and encourage industrial activities based on the industrial policy and the competitive advantages of the country. # To measure the chances of success of projects and help develop contracts that will bind the foreign company with the Moroccan suppliers. # To monitor and evaluate the implementation of offset projects.  The Ministry of Economic Affairs - Commissariat for Military Production (CMP) is in charge of offset policy and implementation (following to a protocol of agreement with the Ministry of Defense). The threshold for offset is EUR 5 million. Minimum offset requirement of 100% . Multipliers are between 1 and 5. The focus is on innovation and marketing support and it is directed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs . Guidelines to an Industrial Benefits and Offsets Program in the Netherlands are available at  Norwegian Ministry of Defense has the responsibility for Industrial Cooperation Agreements (ICA) and the supervision of the agreements during their implementation. The offset threshold of contract value is usually NOK 50 million, (about 5.5 Million Euro). The required offset quantity is 100% of the contract value and multipliers are from 1 to 5. Note: Norway is not part of European Union, but has joined the European Defense Agency with no voting rights. The guidelines of procurement and offsets can be found at: and Polish F-16 \\"Hawk\\"  Ministry of Economy is in charge of offset. Polish Offset Law was issued in 1999; Offset regulations were approved in 1996 and revised in 2007. The threshold value for offsets is 5 million Euro and the request is for 100% of offset. Multipliers are between 2.0 and 5.0. Direct offsets for country's defense industry and opening of new export markets are Polish priorities. In 2003 Lockheed Martin sold 48 F-16 fighters to Poland for 3,5 billion USD via FMS. The Program is called Peace Sky, and it is financed with a U.S. FMF of 3,8 Billion USD for 15 years. Lockheed Martin offered an offset package to Poland of 6 Billion USD in U.S. business investments. Polish officials called the agreement \\"the deal of the century.\\" The value of the offset is 170% of the contract price. The Baltimore Sun reported that \\"such side deals have long been criticized in Washington as a form of kickback that defies the natural forces of free trade, including when Duncan Hunter called offsets \\"economic bribes\\" during a hearing on Capitol Hill this summer (2004).\\" Rick Kirkland, Lockheed Martin V.P. replied: \\"It's part of the price of international business, if we couldn't offer them an acceptable package of offsets, they wouldn't be buying an American airplane. It's that simple.\\" Portuguese Pandur II  Defense Minister's directive on Contrapartidas (offsets) has been issued in 2002. Decree-Law 153/2006 and 154/2006 regulates Portuguese Contrapartidas. The Permanent Commission on Offsets (CPC) is a government agency, which depends on the Ministries of Defense and of Economy, and it is in charge of negotiating and supervising offsets. The threshold is 10 million Euro and the minimum offset request is 100%. Multipliers have been set between 1 and 5 in 2006. There is no preference with regard to direct or indirect offsets. In 2005 the Portuguese government signed a deal worth 364 M euros to acquire 260 Pandur II armored vehicle from General Dynamics. The Portuguese Pandur II includes an associated offset agreement for a value of 516 M euro. Patria, the only competitor of General Dynamics, was excluded on technical reasons in 2004. Patria unusually appealed the Portuguese Government's decision in court,Patria Alleges Misconduct in Portuguese Pandur II Deal complaining that General Dynamics's offset package - decisive for the assignment of the contract - was a fake. The Portuguese tender was the first of many in a European commercial war between Patria and General Dynamics, almost exclusively played on offsets and that ended in 2008 with the arrest of Jorma Witakorpi, Patria's CEO, for the Patria case in Slovenia.  Qatar has no official offset policy but foreign Defense Companies involved with the Qatar Ministry of Defense are encouraged to invest and to build partnership in R&D; and Education in Qatar.  Ministry of National Defense and an Agency for Special Offset Techniques are in charge, and Law 336/2007 regulates offsets. Romania requests offset for defense purchase above 3 million Euro, and the minimum amount of offset proposals is 80% of the contract value. Multipliers can go to 5. Indirect offset are accepted, especially in ecology and shipbuilding. Romania is the only EU country that did not sign the EU Code of Conduct on Offsets (July 2009) Saudi Arabia and the Gulf Defense Offset Market in the world (Source: SIPRI)  Saudi Economic Offset Program is under the Deputy Minister of Defense. Saudi offset request is that 35% of their contract value is invested in Saudi jobs creation and training, economic diversification, technology transfer and foreign direct investments in general. Threshold is 400 million Saudi Reals (US$107 million). UK and France have established bilateral offset program with Saudi Arabia. UK Al Yamamah Economic Offset Program (I, II and III) is the most complex and longest program; it began in 1987 and remains in effect. The French Offset is directed by Societe Francaise d'Exportation de Systemes Avances (SOFRESA), a private company operating on behalf of the French government. The U.S., in spite of the fact the most of its defense sales to the Kingdom are U.S. Defense Department Foreign Military Sales, leaves offsets to the private contractors, such as Lockheed Martin, SAIC, Boeing, and General Dynamics. Foreign Direct Investments are authorized and supervised by SAGIA , and they receive high multipliers according to the most strategic sectors and the Kingdom's priorities (such as water, electricity, communications, etc.). Saudi's offset market has an enormous significance for the Saudi non-oil economy since Saudi Arabia spends about 10% of its GDP in defense procurement.  Ministry of Economy is the governing body for offsets. The threshold (not established clearly) can go down to 130,000 euro. The amount of offset proposal is negotiable, but usually is equivalent to 100% of the contract value. Higher multipliers are for direct offsets. Slovenian Patria AMV  Ministry of Defense is in charge, and offset guidelines were issued in 2000. The threshold is around 500,000 Euro, and the offset request is of 100% of the contract value. Multipliers go from 1 to 7. Foreign Direct Investments and technology transfers have the highest multipliers.Multipliers for \\"technology and knowledge transfer\\" and for \\"direct foreign investments\\" can go up to 7. The 2006 purchase of 135 Patria AMV infantry fighting vehicles is the largest in Slovenian history of military procurement (278 million Euro, deliveries 2007-2013), and the Patria case is the political controversy over claims of bribery of Slovenian officials by the Finnish company Patria.According to Jorma Witakorpi, Patria CEO at the time of the sale, a kickback of about 21 M Euro (7,5% of the total contract price) has been paid to decision makers, Slovenian politicians and military, to further the sale. The Patria AMV vehicles offset agreement has direct offset for 30% of the value of the contract (co-production of the AMV in Slovenia), and 70% of indirect offsets, mostly assistance to export for Slovenian companies.  DAPA, the Defense Acquisition Program Administration, is in charge of country offset policy, that was published in 2008. Threshold is US$10 million. Minimum offset is 30%. Multipliers are between 1 and 6. The contractual Memorandum of Understanding on offsets is a substantial part of the main contract.  Ministry of Defense - General Direction of Armaments and Material (DGAM) - Industrial Cooperation Agency of Spain (ICA) is responsible for the negotiation and the supervision of offsets. The guidelines for offset are not public, but issued by the Minister of Defense through internal and confidential procedures. The general request is 100% of the contract value. Multipliers are between 2 and 5.  The offset policy was issued by the Government in 1999. The Industrial Participation program is directed by Minister of Defense, Defence Material Administration (FMV), and offset guidelines were issued in 2002. The contract value offset threshold is about 10 million Euro. The request for offset is 100%. Multipliers can be applied only to 10% of the total offset value. Only defense related offsets (direct offsets) are accepted, since Sweden applies art. 346 of the European Treaty of Lisbon .  The Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sport, division \\"armasuisse\\" is in charge of offsets. The threshold for offset request is 15 million Swiss Francs. The offsets are minimum 100% and multipliers are between 2 and 3.  The Minister of Defense through an undersecretary for the Defense Industries is in charge of the Industrial Participation / Offset Directive (2007). The threshold is about US$5 million. The minimum required offset is 50%. Multipliers are between 1 and 6. The offset fulfillment time is 2 years, which is unusually short. Mostly interested in direct offsets to develop the Turkish defense industry.  The United Arab Emirates Offset Program Bureau (OFFSET) is in charge of offsets; Chairman of the bureau is the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi. The criteria are more sophisticated than most offset policies. The request for offset is 60% of the contract value. The offset credit is not evaluated on the investments, but through profit over time of an offset venture (a kind of multiplier ex post). Joint ventures in the UAE and partnership with local companies are the most common offset proposal, as direct and indirect offset.  No official Policy. The Ministry of Defence is in charge, but offsets go through UKTI, UK Trade & Investment, under the Minister of State for Trade, Investment and Business. In 2007 the Prime Minister announced a change, transferring responsibility for defense trade from the Defence Export Services Organization (DESO) to UK Trade and Investment (UKTI). Since April 2008 UKTI DSO (Defence & Security Organization) has responsibility for supporting both defense and security exports. The general threshold is 10 million GBP, but through bilateral agreements with Germany and France, has been reciprocally set to 50 million GBP. The offset is generally around 100%, no multipliers. .  The U.S. is formally against offsets. To date, the U.S. is the only country that prohibits government officials and employees, as well as Government agencies, to get involved in any offset business. U.S. depends on foreign defense \\"prime\\" contractors for less than 2% of its defense procurement. However, many countries consider the Buy American Act practically equivalent to the offset policies of other countries. Criticism of offset agreements While widely practiced, some, such as the US government, consider such agreements to be \\"market distorting and inefficient\\". On April 16, 1990, a US Presidential Policy statement was released, stating that \\"the decision whether to engage in offsets [...] resides with the companies involved\\" and that \\"no agency of the U.S. Government shall encourage, enter directly into, or commit U.S. firms to any offset arrangement in connection with the sale of defense goods or services for foreign governments.\\"  EU position on defense offsets  The most recent common European Union quasi-agreement on defense offsets is The Code of Conduct on Offsets , signed by all EU countries (with the exception of Romania and Denmark) in October 2008. The primary purpose of the voluntary and non-binding Code is to promote a \\"European Defense Technological and Industrial Base\\" and to outline a road map to arrive to a complete elimination of offset practices within the domestic EU market. In other words, to open to competitive bids the EU Defense and Security market and to overcome competition restrictions of EU Treaties of Rome and Lisbon, art. 346. The ideal goal is \\"competition in the EU Defense Market\\" and \\"Government-to-Government off-the-shelf sales.\\" The realistic target is humbler, though: to self-restrain and limit the offset quantity to 100% of the contract value. The actual situation in EU is described in detail in a study on defense offsets in the Union countries commissioned by the European Defense Agency and published in 2007.Final Report of 06-DIM-022 Study on the effects of offsets on the Development of a European Defence Industry and Market By E. Anders Eriksson with contributions by Mattias Axelson, Keith Hartley, Mike Mason, Ann-Sofie Sten√©rus and Martin Trybus, 12 July 2007. The study was financed by the European Defence Agency and contracted to FOI and SCS. According to this study the volume of EU offset agreements in 2006 was above 4-5 billion euro.Idem, p. 3-4. The distribution of these offsets is as shown in the diagram: Direct Offsets, Military Indirect Offsets, Civilian Indirect Offsets. right European policy on offsets is still regulated by the Treaty establishing the European Community. Art. 223 of the Treaty of Rome (1958),s:The Treaty establishing the European Economic Community (EEC) then article 296 of the EU Treaty of Amsterdam (1999); since December 2009, the Treaty of Lisbon (art. 346) protects member States weapons production and trade from competition rules of the common European market. In spite of 50 years of European history Article 223 (Rome) and Article 346 (Lisbon) are practically identical. Today the hinge of EU policy on offsets is still the same article, that is, Art. 346 of the Lisbon Treaty. This article preserves the national right to the secret of state related to its own security and military production and procurement. This is the relevant part of Article 346: The first part of the article states that European Union has no authority over national states policies and decisions on their defense/security choices. In other words, EU has no saying about domestic preference for homemade planes or tanks, or for preferred military offsets choice. The second part, however, asserts a shared principle by all EU states regarding the non- military/indirect offsets, that is, EU reserves its right to supervise and regulate indirect-non-military offset effects, so that they do not \\"adversely affect the condition of competition\\" in the internal common EU market. Any civilian-indirect-offset has distortion effects in the common market, and this distortion is amplified by the ignorance about specific offset agreements outside the circle of defense contractors and national authorities.L.

U.S started monitoring offsets adverse effects in United States when a small paper-making equipment company in Wisconsin (Beloit Corporation) got in trouble without understanding that the reason was a hidden cause, that is, an indirect offset by Northrop (now Northrop Grumman) with the Finnish Ministry of Defense. Only a concerned Wisconsin politician, Sen. Russell D. Feingold, discovered the real reasons in 1992, after being informed that a tender for supply of machinery of the value about 50M USD was not awarded to the Wisconsin company, but to a Finnish company (Valmet Corporation) as part of an offset deal with the Finnish Government.Now Velmet has a different name after a merging in 1999: Metso ; In 2000 Metso bought Beloit for $160M, hiring all Wisconsin workers and paying also for Beloit patents. This U.S. offset story brought to light the issue of the impact of confidential agreements by defense companies on U.S. non- military business, in some instances with devastating effects. Feingold's discovery is enlightening for the EU common market as well, where interferences and adverse impacts on EU companies are allowed by an unjustified national attitude for confidentiality or secrecy on indirect, non military, offset deals. Art. 346 of Lisbon Treaty, written more than 50 years ago, is there to wisely avoid disruptive effects caused by unjustified military secrecy in civilian offsets in the common European market. In EU market of Defense, approximately of the size of $250B, with 27 sovereign state authorities that can claim secret of state -from Germany to Cyprus and Luxembourg-, there is a potential for indirect non-military offsets of $60B, that is, more 1000 times the distortion problem caused by Northrop (and the Finnish Ministry of Defense) to Beloit.  Offset associations and publications  The two main global organizations in the USA that deal with offsets are: :G.O.C.A - Global Offset and Countertrade Association is a main source of information on the uses of counter-trade and offset :DMA - Defence Manufacturers Association, based in UK but opened to many other countries. One domestic U.S. based organization that deals with offsets is: :DIOA - Defense Industrial Offset Association, membership is primarily open to U.S. based defense contractors. In Europe, ECCO (European Club for Countertrade and Offset) hosts two symposiums a year and started publishing various volumes that explains offset in various domains, such as finance, ethics, the economy, and international law. Visit www.ecco-offset.eu There are many regional or national offset conferences and symposiums, but recently GOCA and DMA jointly organize global offset meetings every two years. The first global meeting on offset took place in 2004 in Sintra, Portugal; then in Athens, Greece (2006); the third in Seville, Spain, in 2008. GOCA and DIOA hold both individual and joint conferences several times per year.

Retired and placed at this site in 1981. The University of Texas Performing Arts Center (PAC) is a collective of five theaters operated by The University of Texas at Austin, College of Fine Arts. The theaters are the Bass Concert Hall, McCullough Theater, Bates Recital Hall, B. Iden Payne Theater and Oscar Brockett Theater. Theaters range in size from the Oscar G. Brockett Theater, which has 244 seats, to the Bass Concert Hall, which seats 2,900. In addition to the theaters, the PAC also has offices and meeting rooms, rehearsal spaces and shops which are located in the PAC building and across the campus. PAC provides students an opportunity to interact with professionals in staging events and performing arts and extends an opportunity to the surrounding community to participate in all-age programs. History The Center was first opened in 1981. Between 1992 and January, 2008, the Center was directed by Pebbles Wadsworth, who was declared an Honorary Texan in 1987 for her contributions through PAC. Under Wadsworth's supervision, in 2002 PAC launched its multicultural ArtesAm√©ricas program in conjunction with the Teresa Lozano Long Institute of Latin American Studies. Wadsworth conceived of the program in response to a 1998 request by former University of Texas president Larry Faulkner to \\"strengthen ties between the United States and Latin America.\\" Among other activities, the program facilitates performances by Latin American artists across the United States, at the PAC and at the 52 institutions that partner it. The Burleson Bells are located in a monument just outside the Bass Concert Hall in Austin, Texas. The bells were donated to the University of Texas at Austin as part of an anonymous gift by Albert Sidney Burleson. They were moved to their present location in 1981. Bass Concert Hall The Nancy Lee and Perry R. Bass Concert Hall opened in 1981 on the site of the former Clark Field home of the Texas Longhorns Baseball team from 1928-1974. It is the largest of the five theaters for Texas Performing Arts. Bass Concert Hall routinely attracts top tier performers and full-scale productions such as Broadway Across America. The hall seats 2,900 and has an orchestra pit capable of holding 100 musicians. In 2007, Bass Concert Hall began a $14.7 Million dollar renovation and facelift. These upgrades included: state-of-the-art acoustics, a magnificent glass-front fa√ßade and larger lobby, an expanded five-story lobby and atrium, increased restroom capacity, more bars and concession areas, new flooring, sidewalls and d√©cor, and a sixth-level outside deck with impressive campus views.

Origins  The American Academy of Psychoanalysis was founded in 1956. At that time, the American Psychoanalytic Association, which was the dominant psychoanalytic organization in North America, set standards for training psychoanalytic candidates at psychoanalytic institutes and certified individual psychoanalysts and institutes as well. The seventy- six Charter members who founded the Academy were concerned that focus on certification associated with a rigid Freudian framework inhibited free and open discourse about basic psychoanalytic concepts. They wanted to establish a forum for open discussion and debate but not an organization that would certify psychoanalysts or psychoanalytic institutes. The guiding philosophy of this new organization was expressed by its first President, Janet Rioch:  Psychoanalysis and psychiatry  Since the inception of the Academy, great changes have taken place in the practice of psychoanalysis and in the application of depth psychology (from the German term Tiefenpsychologie and commonly termed \\"psychoanalytic psychology\\") to psychiatric symptoms, syndromes and disorders. The Academy changed its name to The American Academy of Psychoanalysis and Dynamic Psychiatry and became an Affiliate organization of the American Psychiatric Association in 1998. From originally being an organization of medical psychoanalysts, the Academy became an organization of psychiatrists interested in all aspects of psychodynamic psychiatry. Psychoanalysis as a treatment technique remains one of its many interests. The membership of The Academy consists of psychiatrists, psychiatric residents, and medical students. Researchers and scholars who are not psychiatrists are welcomed as Scientific Associates.  Psychodynamic psychiatry  Psychodynamic psychiatry is a new discipline that has emerged from a fusion of psychoanalytic and extra-psychoanalytic psychology, neuroscience and academic psychiatry. Psychodynamic treatments are based on assessment that is carried out from a developmental perspective. Particular attention is paid to the person's present and past psychiatric illnesses, experiences of trauma, and family history. The patient's behavior is reported both descriptively using established psychiatric diagnostic criteria from the current edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ‚Äì DSM ‚Äì and from the International Classification of Diseases ‚Äì ICD. The patient's behavior is in addition understood in terms of subjectively constructed narratives. Psychodynamic psychiatry accepts concepts that are clinically useful and/or scientifically important but discards those that have not stood the test of time. Although it enthusiastically endorses research, it also recognizes that much knowledge about normal and abnormal behavior (however these terms are defined) is based on clinical experience. Thus, for example, the official journal of the American Academy of Psychoanalysis and Dynamic Psychiatry is entitled Psychodynamic Psychiatry and publishes clinical case discussions as well as scholarly reviews and research investigations. As time goes on, psychodynamic psychiatry as a body of knowledge will change as more is learned about the relationships between neuroscience, psychopathology, and individual feelings and behavior. All psychodynamic treatments are organized around a therapeutic alliance forged by both participants. They include psychoanalysis, briefer therapies and combinations of therapies including, for example, individual and group psychotherapy, family therapy and/or pharmacotherapy. Psychodynamically oriented treatments may be of any duration from a single meeting to weeks to years. They may take place anywhere the practitioner meets with a patient‚Äînot only in the outpatient setting but in inpatient psychiatric services, the emergency ward, and general hospital medical and surgical settings where consultation-liaison psychiatrists use developmental principles and alliance with the patient to render care. In other words, wherever the psychodynamically trained psychiatrist interacts with a patient, the practitioner uses a developmental approach to understand that person and help him or her get better.  Activities  All activities of the Academy foster communication and discussion of psychodynamic concepts as expressed in clinical treatment, research, psychological development and diverse other ways as well. A major priority of The Academy is to teach the principles of psychodynamic psychiatry to medical students, psychiatric residents and other mental health professionals and students. The specific activities include: * Annual Meeting Of The Academy The meetings take place immediately prior to the annual meeting of The American Psychiatric Association (APA) and are usually organized around a central theme for example, the meeting in 2013 was focused on the suicidal patient. The meeting in 2016 was focused on play. * Symposia and workshops at the American Psychiatric Association and the Institute on Psychiatric Services (IPS) * Annual meeting in Italy co-sponsored with OPIFER (Organizzazione Psicoanalisti Italiania Federazione e Registro). * Past meetings in Washington DC co-sponsored with the Consortium for Psychoanalytic Research.  Publications and Out-reach Activities  = Psychodynamic Psychiatry, the Journal = Psychodynamic Psychiatry, the official journal of The American Academy of Psychoanalysis and Dynamic Psychiatry, published by Guilford Press, was created in response to the need for the continued study and teaching of psychodynamic concepts in organized psychiatry. Psychodynamic Psychiatry is the only English-language psychiatric journal exclusively devoted to the study and discussion of these issues. The central tenet of the journal is that psychodynamic principles are necessary for adequately understanding and treating people with psychiatric symptoms, syndromes and disorders. Its guiding framework is developmental and bio-psycho-social. The journal publishes review articles, clinical discussions and research. Psychodynamic Psychiatry is edited by Richard C. Friedman MD. The Deputy Editors are Jennifer Downey, MD and Cesar Alfonso, MD. From 1958 to 1972 the Academy published its proceedings in monograph form under the rubric ‚ÄúScience and Psychoanalysis‚Äù edited by Jules Masserman. In 1973 Silvano Arieti became the first editor of the Journal which was entitled Journal of The American Academy of Psychoanalysis. Subsequent Editors- in Chief included Morton Cantor, Jules Bemporad and Douglas Ingram. When Richard C. Friedman became Editor in Chief in 2012, the journal's name was changed to Psychodynamic Psychiatry. = The Academy Forum = The Academy Forum is a magazine that is published twice yearly and focuses on psychoanalytic and psychodynamically oriented articles about art and culture. = The Academy Newsletter = The Academy Newsletter is published electronically 4 times a year and gives information about the organization and its members. Its Editor is Alicia McGill, MD. = Teichner Scholars Program = The late Victor J Teichner was a former President of the AAPDPP. A grateful patient established a fund making it possible to impart the spirit of Teichner's creative therapeutic perspective to psychiatric clinicians in training. The Victor J. Teichner Award is made annually to one psychiatric residency program on the basis of an application to the Award Committee, composed of representatives of the AAPDPP and the AADPRT (American Association of Directors of Psychiatric Residency Training). Its focus is to promote the teaching of psychodynamic principles to psychiatrists-in-training. The Program Awardee receives a one- to three-day visit from a Visiting Scholar chosen from a list maintained by the AAPDP. The choice of the Visiting Scholar and structure of the visit are made by the Program. The visit must take place during the academic year beginning July 1, after the announcement of the Awardee.

In 2008 the Northern Rock bank was nationalised by the British Labour Government, due to financial problems caused by the subprime mortgage crisis. In 2010 the bank was split into two parts (assets and banking) to aid the eventual sale of the bank back to the private sector. On 14 September 2007, the Bank sought and received a liquidity support facility from the Bank of England, as a result of its exposure in the credit markets, during the 2008 financial crisis. On 22 February 2008 the bank was taken into state ownership. The nationalisation followed two unsuccessful bids to take over the bank, neither being able to fully commit to repayment of savers' and investors' money. In 2012 Virgin Money completed their purchase of Northern Rock from UK Financial Investments (UKFI) for approximately ¬£1 billion and by October of that year the high street bank operated under the Virgin Money brand.  2007 credit crisis  = Emergence = People queuing outside a branch in Golders Green to withdraw their savings due to fallout from the subprime crisis. On 12 September 2007, Northern Rock asked the Bank of England, as lender of last resort in the United Kingdom, for a liquidity support facility due to problems in raising funds in the money market to replace maturing money market borrowings. The problems arose from difficulties banks faced over the summer of 2007 in raising funds in the money market. The bank's assets were always sufficient to cover its liabilities in the long run, but it had a liquidity problem because institutional lenders became nervous about lending to mortgage banks following the US sub-prime crisis. Bank of England figures suggest that Northern Rock borrowed ¬£3 billion from the Bank of England in the first few days of this crisis. = Government intervention = With shares in Northern Rock plummeting by nearly a third, the British Government moved to reassure investors with the bank, with account holders urged not to worry about the bank going bust. The Treasury select committee chairman John McFall MP said: \\"I don't think customers of Northern Rock should be worried about their current accounts or mortgages.\\" Northern Rock was not the only British bank to have called on the Bank of England for funds since the sub-prime crisis began but is the only one to have had emergency financial support from the Tripartite Authority (The Bank of England, the FSA and HM Treasury). However, the bank was more vulnerable to a credit crunch as its 'high risk' business model depended on funding from the wholesale credit markets, 75% of its funds coming from this source. In his address to the Treasury Select Committee, Bank of England governor Mervyn King had stated emergency funds would be made available to any British bank that needed it, but at a penalty rate, to ensure that lenders who had made bad lending decisions would suffer relative to lenders who had made sensible lending decisions. In December, the EU regulators approved Britain's actions to provide aid to the Bank by concluding that it was in line with European emergency aid rules. = Run on the bank = Outside a Northern Rock branch in Birmingham. On Friday 14 September 2007, the first day branches opened following the news, many customers queued outside branches to withdraw their savings (a run on the bank). This bank run was not the traditional form, where depositors withdraw money in a snowball effect, leading to a liquidity crisis; instead, it occurred in the aftermath of the liquidity crisis. It was estimated that ¬£1 billion was withdrawn by customers that day, about 5% of the total bank deposits held by Northern Rock. On Monday 17 September, as worried savers continued to flock to some Northern Rock bank branches to withdraw their savings, it was reported that an estimated ¬£2 billion had been withdrawn since the bank applied to the Bank of England for emergency funds. By early afternoon in London, Northern Rock's shares, which had lost 32% on the previous Friday, fell a further 40% from 438 pence to 263 pence. Later that day, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Alistair Darling, announced that the British Government and the Bank of England would guarantee all deposits held at Northern Rock. Northern Rock shares rose by 16% after this was announced. = Stabilisation = The announcement by the Chancellor showed its intended effects the next day, as the queues outside Northern Rock's branches gradually disappeared. In addition, Northern Rock had a series of advertisements published in major UK newspapers to reaffirm that their customers' money was safe. In an interview on BBC Radio 4, Bank of England governor Mervyn King revealed that they had anticipated emergency funding to be in the ¬£20‚Äì30bn range. = Boardroom changes = Matt Ridley was forced to resign as chairman in 2007, having been blamed in parliamentary committee hearings for not recognising the risks of the bank's financial strategy and thereby \\"harming the reputation of the British banking industry\\". John Devaney and Simon Laffin joined the board in November 2007, when Sir Derek Wanless, Nichola Pease, Adam Fenwick and Rosemary Radcliffe retired as Non-Executive Directors. The Chief Executive Adam Applegarth stayed on in a caretaker role until December 2007. David Baker and Keith Currie left the board, but remained employed within the company. Currie later took early retirement with a bonus package reportedly worth ¬£2.5 million, and in 2012, aged 56, was found dead at his home. The Chief Executive after the departure of Applegarth was Andy Kuipers, who joined the company in 1987, and later left on 31 August 2008. = Growth of Bank of England loan = By January 2008, Northern Rock's loan from the Bank of England had grown to ¬£26bn. On 11 January, Northern Rock announced that it had sold its portfolio of lifetime home equity release mortgages to JP Morgan for ¬£2.2bn and that it would use this to pay off a piece of the Bank of England loan. On 6 February, the Office for National Statistics announced that it was treating Northern Rock as a public corporation, similar to the BBC and Royal Mail for accounting purposes, causing the loans (approximately ¬£25 billion) and guarantees (approximately ¬£30 billion) extended by the Bank of England and the value of the company's mortgage book (approximately ¬£55 billion), provisionally estimated to total around ¬£100 billion, to be added to the National Debt. Although not technically a nationalisation, the decision effectively acknowledged that \\"In all but name, Northern Rock is now nationalised\\". The addition of this borrowing to the Government's totals increases the National Debt from ¬£537 billion, or 37.7% of GDP to around 45%, breaking the so-called Golden Rule which sets the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement threshold at below 40%. The figure is the equivalent of ¬£3,000 additional borrowing for every family in Britain. In the 2008 Budget, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced that the government would issue ¬£14 billion of gilts in order to cover the Northern Rock debt. = Handling of the crisis = On 26 March the Financial Services Authority released an internal report into the failings over handling the problems at Northern Rock. \\"They found that their supervision of the bank had not been carried out to a standard that is acceptable\\". The previous FSA review had taken place in February 2006. In the light of these failings at Northern Rock, the FSA announced that they would overhaul their own staffing and systems. The FSA internal report also concluded that ultimately the blame for the collapse of Northern Rock should sit at the feet of the bank's senior management. \\"The boards and managements of regulated firms carry the primary responsibility for ensuring their institutions' financial soundness,\\" the FSA said. The British Bankers' Association (BBA), the UK banking body, agreed. In May 2009 the Financial Times reported that banking regulators had been examining \\"war games\\" as early as 2004, which dealt with possible turmoil in the mortgage markets. HBOS and Northern Rock are thought to have featured in these predictions. Commencing in October 2007, the All Party Commons Treasury Select Committee undertook a report into the failure of Northern Rock. The Committee held several televised meetings, in which they called witnesses from the former Board of Northern Rock, the Bank of England, the Treasury, and the regulatory bodies. The report was detailed, and concluded: :\\"The [former] directors of Northern Rock were the principal authors of the difficulties that the company has faced since August 2007. It is right that members of the Board of Northern Rock have been replaced, though haphazardly, since the company became dependent on liquidity support from the Bank of England. The high-risk, reckless business strategy of Northern Rock, with its reliance on short- and medium-term wholesale funding and an absence of sufficient insurance and a failure to arrange standby facility or cover that risk, meant that it was unable to cope with the liquidity pressures placed upon it by the freezing of international capital markets in August 2007. Given that the formulation of that strategy was a fundamental role of the Board of Northern Rock, overseen by some directors who had been there since its demutualisation, the failure of that strategy must also be attributed to the Board. The non-executive members of the Board, and in particular the Chairman of the Board, the Chairman of the Risk Committee and the senior non-executive director, failed in the case of Northern Rock to ensure that it remained liquid as well as solvent, to provide against the risks that it was taking and to act as an effective restraining force on the strategy of the executive members.\\" = Financial performance = Northern Rock share price 2005‚Äì2008, showing the huge fall in price Prior to the subprime mortgage crisis the bank was part of the FTSE 100 Index, but was demoted back to the FTSE 250 in December 2007. The shares were later delisted. On 31 March the bank released its annual report for 2007, it showed a loss of ¬£167 million. The former boss, Adam Applegarth received a ¬£760,000 (¬£63,333 a month) payoff. The report also outlined further details of their proposed business plan. On 5 August the bank announced that it had made a loss of ¬£585.4m for the first 6 months of the year and that ¬£9.4bn of a loan from the Bank of England had been paid back, reducing the amount owed to ¬£17.5bn.  Takeover offers  = Virgin = On 12 October 2007, Virgin Group announced that it intended to bid for Northern Rock as the lead partner in a coalition including American giant AIG, turnaround specialist WL Ross and First Eastern Investment. Had the deal been successful, Northern Rock would have been integrated into Virgin Money as Virgin Bank. It is unclear what role partners would have had in the deal. This bid was later approved by the UK Treasury and had been noted as the preferred option. Virgin announced that Peter McNamara, a former Alliance & Leicester managing director, would be responsible for risk management at Northern Rock if its bid succeeds. = Other bidders = The other front-runner was an investment company Olivant, headed by the former chief executive of Abbey, Luqman Arnold. Olivant would have kept the Northern Rock brand. By 17 November, a total of ten companies had put forward proposals for the bank. Among the other suitors for Northern Rock were private equity firm Cerberus, JC Flowers and Lloyds TSB. In early December JC Flowers dropped out of the bidding. = Bids rejection = Northern Rock announced that all offers had been \\"materially below\\" the previous trading value. Alistair Darling said on 19 November that the Government would have to approve or veto any sale, in the interests of taxpayers, depositors and wider financial stability. = Possible nationalisation = In December the Government prepared emergency legislation to nationalise the Bank, in the event that the takeover bids fail. On 12 January 2008, the Treasury recruited Ron Sandler, the former Lloyd's of London Chief Executive, to lead Northern Rock, in the event that the bank was nationalised. If the Bank was to be temporarily nationalised, the government would manage the Bank at \\"arm's length\\" on a commercial basis, where services for savers and borrowers would not be affected and the company would continue to operate as normal. However nationalisation would also address the future of the Northern Rock Foundation. Alistair Darling rejected the possibility of the Bank being put into administration. = In-house proposal = On 15 December, Northern Rock hired the bank Goldman Sachs to put together a financing package, to assemble backers and present proposals to its board. This package would be available to any potential bidder for the bank. The in-house bid was led by Paul Thompson and Andy Kuipers. = Final bids = The deadline for bids was 4 February 2008, where final bids were expected from Virgin, Olivant and the bank's management; other bidders could still have expressed interest. Goldman Sachs were likely to contact Cerberus and JC Flowers to see if they would like to rejoin the bidding, since the situation had materially changed. Once a successful proposal had been chosen, it would be put to the European Commission by 17 March, which would consider whether it conformed to EU state aid rules. Olivant pulled out of the bidding (but stated that they might still attempt a rescue bid if the Government changed their conditions) on 4 February, leaving just the Virgin bid and the in-house bid. For repayment of the Government loans, there was a proposal to create an 'asset pool' at the bank, of a size greater than the loans. The bidder would have issued bonds against this asset pool, with maturities set inline with the repayment. Proceeds from the bond issue would have also gone to the Government and the bank would have paid for a government guarantee for the bonds to trade in the market at or near prices of similar gilt-edged stocks. This would have replaced the original plan for the bidders to have to find their own investors to cover the first ¬£15bn, which proved impossible, due to the credit crunch. The government would also continue to guarantee the Bank's liabilities, such as savers' deposits.  Nationalisation  A typical Northern Rock branch, on Northumberland Street, Newcastle upon Tyne. Images of this branch and the clock above featured heavily in news stories about the bank's nationalisation. On 17 February 2008, Alistair Darling, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, announced that Northern Rock was to be nationalised claiming that the private bids did not offer \\"sufficient value for money to the taxpayer\\" and thus the bank was to be brought under a \\"temporary period of public ownership\\". The government is the sole shareholder through UK Financial Investments Limited, and the Bank is managed at \\"arm's length\\" on a commercial basis by an independent board under Ron Sandler. Customers are not affected by this change. A Government-appointed arbitration panel will decide on a fair price for the compensation to be offered to investors for their shares. Prior to the markets opening on 18 February, trading in Northern Rock's ordinary and preference shares on the London Stock Exchange was suspended. The legal authorisation for the nationalisation is the Banking (Special Provisions) Act 2008, which also allows for the nationalisation of other banks if necessary. At 00:01 on 22 February Northern Rock was formally nationalised. In November 2008 the government set up a new company, UK Financial Investments Limited, to manage their shareholdings in Northern Rock and Bradford & Bingley. On 10 March 2009 the Office of Fair Trading published their report on the impacts of public support for Northern Rock on competition in financial services. The OFT concluded that \\"public support for Northern Rock did not, during that period, have a significantly adverse impact on competition.\\" = Boardroom changes = In February 2008, Ron Sandler was appointed Executive Chairman by the government. Bryan Sanderson, Sir Ian Gibson, David Jones and Paul Thompson resigned from the board at this time. Gary Hoffman became Chief Executive of Northern Rock in October 2008. He has previously been the vice chairman of Barclays and a former Managing Director of Barclaycard. With the appointment of Gary Hoffman, Ron Sandler changed to a Non-Executive Chairman position. On 4 November 2010 Hoffman left the bank to move to NBNK; Sandler reverted to his Executive Chairman position. In October 2008, the post-nationalisation management of Northern Rock decided not to bring legal action for negligence against the directors in charge during the crisis, including former chief executive Adam Applegarth, citing insufficient grounds to do so. There will be no action either against the auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers. In January 2009 it was announced that Ann Godbehere would be leaving her post as Chief Financial Officer at the end of February. Some former directors of the bank have been fined and banned by the FSA including former deputy chief executive David Baker ¬£504,000 for misreporting mortgage arrears data and former credit director Richard Barclay was fined ¬£140,000 for failing to ensure accurate financial information. In April finance director David Jones quit the bank after reports that the FSA were to further investigate the activities at the bank prior to the nationalisation. In July Jones was fined and banned by the FSA. = Offshore mortgage book = It has subsequently become known that the best book of Northern Rock's mortgage business, comprising mortgages worth ¬£47 billion ‚Äì some 40% of the company's assets ‚Äì had been transferred to a Channel Islands based company called Granite, together with an ongoing obligation to continue to supply business. Failure to maintain the arrangement could cost a reported ¬£5 billion. As is common practice in bank securitisations, Granite was set up as a charitable trust with any residue on winding-up to benefit a small charity, Down's Syndrome North East. Despite having assets worth an estimated ¬£45 billion, Granite has never made a donation to the charity, because it remains in business. In late 2008, Northern Rock, advised by Credit Suisse, decided to let Granite go into run-off, meaning that Northern Rock the bank will no longer supply it with fresh mortgages and bondholders will be repaid as old mortgages expire. = Debt reduction strategy = On 18 March, Northern Rock announced the measures that it would be taking to reduce the government debt within three to four years. The bank is to cut around a third of jobs (2,000) by 2011; on 1 May the bank confirmed that they would be initialising talks with the unions and that most of the job losses would be later in 2008. As of 30 September 2008 the bank is repaying the loan well ahead of target, owing a net balance of only ¬£11.5 billion of the loan that stood at ¬£26.9 billion at the end of 2007. On 21 October Standard & Poor's Ratings Services revised their outlook on Northern Rock to stable from positive; they also affirmed the bank's long and short-term 'A/A-1' counterparty credit ratings. The Press Association noted on 22 October that Northern Rock may give their employees bonuses in the future, if certain targets in paying back the Government loan are met. On 21 January 2009 it was revealed that the bank's employees would receive a 10% bonus, due to the bank meeting its targets for repaying the Government loan. This caused some unrest from a number of media outlets and the Liberal Democrats' Vince Cable for example, but the decision to issue the bonus was defended by the Unite union, calling it a reward for their hard work and dedication. On 3 March 2009 Northern Rock noted that only ¬£8.9 billion of the loan remained unpaid. On 1 October 2010 the bank announced that another ¬£700 million had been paid off of the loan in the last three months. = Job losses = The 1990s buildings at the bank's headquarters at Regent Centre, Gosforth, Newcastle. At the end of July 2008 Northern Rock announced the first set of redundancies; 800 staff were made compulsorily redundant and a further 500 staff left under a voluntary redundancy programme. It is also aiming to halve its ¬£100 billion loan book by either selling off mortgage assets to other lenders or by declining to offer new mortgages to existing customers. On 8 June 2010 as a part of the restructuring process it was announced that a further 650 jobs would be lost in the North East locations of the bank before the end of the year. In a report commissioned by development agency One North East it was detailed that the downfall of the bank cost the local region around ¬£800 million, mainly in relation to the job losses. The report was kept confidential until 2010. On 28 March 2011 the bank announced that it was likely that around 680 more jobs would go during the restructuring prior to the bank's return to private sector. = Danish operations = On 18 March, Northern Rock announced the termination of its Danish savings operation. All accounts in the Danish branch were closed on 18 April 2008. = Lloyds TSB deal = On 5 June it was announced that Lloyds TSB, a former bidder for the bank, would assume a proportion of the Northern Rock mortgage book over 3 years; this would be achieved by Lloyds TSB offering new mortgages to Northern Rock customers who are nearing the end of their fixed-rate deals. = Sponsorship = It was confirmed on 20 May 2008 that Northern Rock would continue to sponsor both Newcastle United and the Newcastle Falcons, the former due to the long-term agreement between them and the club. Chief Executive Ron Sandler was quoted as saying: > \\"We have already ended a number of sponsorships that I inherited... but we > have chosen to continue the sponsorship of Newcastle United and Newcastle > Falcons, partly because of commitments we have entered into there ‚Äì > sometimes sponsorships continue until they come to a contractual end ‚Äì and > partly because I believe it is in the commercial interest of the bank that > we should continue with both of these.\\" In 2007, almost three weeks before the bank had to appeal to the Bank of England for an emergency loan, the bank bought the home ground of Newcastle Falcons Rugby Club, Kingston Park stadium for ¬£15 million. In February 2008, documents relating to the sale came to light, attracting much criticism that the purchase has been made at a time of impending crisis. In late 2008 the bank sold Kingston Park stadium to Northumbria University for an undisclosed fee. On 18 January 2010 Northern Rock announced that they had signed a new 4-year sponsorship deal with Newcastle United, worth between ¬£1.5 million and ¬£10 million, starting from the 2010/11 season. The sponsorship agreement with the Newcastle Falcons came to an end before the start of the 2010/11 season. = Head office and The Tower = The Tower, during the final stages of its construction in 2008. At the time of its nationalisation, Northern Rock was developing two new offices. At its headquarters at the Regent Centre complex in Gosforth, Newcastle upon Tyne the bank was midway through construction of a 10-storey tower that would provide a focus for the whole site. As the redundancy programme has made the new space surplus to capacity, the bank sought to sell or lease the tower building to a third party. The bank also developed a site at Rainton Bridge, which was also surplus to capacity, and it sold the site to npower. In April 2009, the local council, Newcastle City Council, announced that they were to buy the building for ¬£22 million, and lease it to a green support services company, Eaga. By November the sale of the building was complete, and the council renamed it Partnership House. = Northern Rock Foundation = Prior to Nationalisation, the company donated substantial amounts annually to its own charity, the Northern Rock Foundation. Nationalisation ended the covenant requiring Northern Rock to remit a share of profits to the Foundation. Instead, for the next three years the Foundation will receive an annual ¬£15 million payment from Northern Rock, whether it remains publicly owned or returns to the private sector. The Foundation's shares were cancelled and compensated in the same way as those of other shareholders. = Shareholders, hedge funds and legal action = Two hedge funds that owned 20% of the bank, SRM Global and RAB Capital, took legal action against the Government, regulators and individuals whose nationalisation of the bank, they believed to have been inappropriate, and a contributory factor to the current crisis. On 15 January 2008, a meeting was held at the 11,000 seat Metro Radio Arena to discuss the situation which then existed, where all but one of the proposals put forward by the hedge funds were rejected. In May Legal & General joined the hedge funds, as an \\"interested party\\". The hedge funds are to request that an independent valuer assesses the level of compensation and to argue that the bank's shares are worth more than the final price of their trading prior to nationalisation. This legal action is thought to have started on 8 May. A number of Northern Rock shareholders have also taken action in an attempt to get some level of compensation for their shares. Three North Labour MPs have agreed to hand a series of petitions in, on behalf of shareholders who lost hundreds of thousands of pounds when their shares were confiscated. As of 6 July around about 10 firms had applied to value the Bank. The Times reported on 3 August that Houlihan Lokey, BDO Stoy Hayward and L.E.K. Consulting were the three companies short listed by the government to value the bank. On 9 September The Times reported that Andrew Caldwell, a valuations partner at BDO Stoy Hayward had been chosen as the valuer, with a fee of ¬£4.5 million. The legal action brought by investors against the Government started in the Royal Courts of Justice on 13 January 2009. Shareholders were also staging a demonstration outside the court. One of the points that was revealed about the case is that they were examining who 'leaked' the information about the bank receiving its emergency government bailout. In order to give full consideration, Lord Justice Stanley Burnton and Mr Justice Silber reserved their decision, before they gave a written judgment of the case. On 13 February it was announced that the shareholders had lost the case. Roger Lawson of the UK Shareholders Association said that there was a 'good chance' that they would appeal the decision. In May 2009, it was reported that Sir Anthony Clarke and two other senior judges in the Court of Appeal would hear the next stage in the judicial review starting on 10 June for three days. On 28 July it was revealed that the shareholders lost their appeal, but some shareholders said that they would now try to take the case to the House of Lords. On 22 December it was reported that the shareholders had again lost their appeal, and now they will be going to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. On 8 December it was announced that the Northern Rock shareholders were to get no compensation, based on the findings of the valuer Andrew Caldwell. This then went to a tribunal, 'Northern Rock v. Andrew Caldwell and HM Treasury, Upper Tribunal (Tax and Chancery Chamber), NR/001/2010, where the shareholders' appeal was rejected. In 2011 Harbinger Capital Partners LLC, an entity which had held an interest in some ¬£277 million preference shares in Northern Rock, and Chris Hulme, chairman of the Northern Rock Shareholders Action Group, lost their legal battle to overturn the valuation of the shares being worthless. In January 2013 Harbinger's appeal is being heard in London. = Repossession accusations = In October 2008 a small number of charities and media outlets accused Northern Rock of having an aggressive repossession policy. These allegations were denied by the bank's spokesman Simon Hall. = Restoration of confidence = By October customers appeared to be regaining confidence in the bank, when it emerged that there had been a surge in the number of new accounts which had been opened. People appeared to see Northern Rock as a safe place to put their money, given the current status as a nationalised bank which cannot fail. The bank decided to remove some of their savings products from the market, as the bank has a commitment to take only a 1.5% share of total UK retail deposits. In January 2009 the media began to speculate about the Government having plans to use Northern Rock as a way of boosting lending. On 19 January, it was announced that Northern Rock would change its business strategy by offering more retention deals to its existing mortgage borrowers as their products expire, hence taking longer to pay back the remainder of its Government loan. Alistair Darling noted that it was \\"not appropriate for Northern Rock to continue to shrink its activities\\". Reuters reported on 23 January, that the Government were considering injecting up to ¬£10 billion into Northern Rock, as a new business plan at the bank. However, the European Commission may object to changes in how the bank is run, and that it may break EU state aid rules, and are investigating the matter. In late February media sources began reporting that a section of the bank was to become a \\"good bank\\", issuing more mortgages, when it is injected with ¬£10‚Äì14 billion by the Government. On 23 February 2009 Northern Rock announced that they would be offering ¬£14 billion worth of new mortgages, over the next two years, as a part of their new business plan. This new lending was partly funded by an increase in the government loan, a reversal of previous strategy to pay the loan off as quickly as possible by actively encouraging mortgage customers to leave when their mortgage deal matures. The reason for this change being government policy to increase the availability of credit. This ¬£14 billion was split into ¬£5 billion in 2009 and ¬£9 billion in 2010. In March 2009 mortgages issued by the bank rose by 70%, compared to the previous month. In February 2010 The Times claimed that Northern Rock was interested in buying some of the branches of RBS and Lloyds. In February 2010 the government decided to remove the 100% guarantee of the deposits at Northern Rock. Savers received 3 months notice before the removal of the guarantee at the end of May. This means that, like most banks, only the first ¬£50,000 (or as of October 2011, ¬£85,000) deposited is guaranteed.  Eventual return to the private sector  The clock outside this branch, on Northumberland Street, Newcastle upon Tyne, is emblazoned with the bank's name and has become a popular image in print and television coverage of the Northern Rock crisis. When the British Government nationalised the bank, they noted that it was to be a temporary measure, and one of their aims was to eventually return the bank back to the private sector. On 26 April 2009, The Times suggested that the Government would sell Northern Rock by the end of 2009. Potential buyers included Virgin Money, National Australia Bank, Santander, Blackstone and TowerBrook. The Times noted that a British supermarket chain, Tesco, was interested in buying parts of the bank. It is thought that adviser Credit Suisse examined the plans to split the bank into 2 parts, to separate the most toxic loans and assets into a \\"bad bank\\". In May 2009 the EU demanded more information about the split. Another possibility was a bond debt buyback. A spokesperson for the bank said that the sale of the bank was just one option, and there was currently no time scale. Reuters noted that there were considerations to sell the bank, but no formal discussions were taking place with potential buyers. Alistair Darling has stated that he is in no hurry to return the bank back to the private sector. In January 2010 National Australia Bank were widely reported to have lined up potential advisers on the deal to buy the Northern Rock. NAB already owned two brands in the UK, Clydesdale and Yorkshire banks. Also in January 2010 Virgin purchased a small bank, the Church House Trust, but according to the Times and other sources Virgin still had an interest in Northern Rock and had been contacting companies such as Blackstone. In July 2010 it was reported that a consortium of City executives were gathering to place a bid for Northern Rock using the vehicle NBNK Investments. UKFI have been briefed on the proposals. On 4 November Gary Hoffman left Northern Rock to become CEO at NBNK Investments. Hoffman was put on gardening leave by Northern Rock until he joins NBNK on 1 May 2011. Hoffman was to receive a package worth around ¬£500,000 for his gardening leave, but decided to turn it down. Due to Hoffman's previous position NBNK Investments would not be permitted to table a bid for Northern Rock for a period of 12 months from 1 November 2010. In January 2011 renewed speculation about the bank's sale was reported as it emerged that UKFI were beginning to search for both advisers and suitors for the potential sale. On 11 March Deutsche Bank AG were appointed to be the advisers for Northern Rock's return to the private sector. On 28 March 2011 the bank announced that it was likely that around 680 more jobs would go during the restructuring prior to the bank's return to private sector. On 15 June 2011 it was announced that the bank was to be sold to a single buyer in the private sector by the end of the year. On 17 November 2011 the UK Government announced the sale of Northern Rock to Virgin Money for ¬£747m. = Banking and assets split = On 26 June 2009 the bank confirmed that it was to be split into two parts, an \\"assetco\\" and a \\"bankco\\". The plan was also to include that the remaining amount of the government loan was to be repaid by the end of 2010. On 28 October the European Commission waived through plans to split the bank off and sell the \\"good\\" parts off. On 8 December the Northern Rock plc Transfer Order 2009 was laid before parliament and in this the Treasury announced that this restructuring would take place from 1 January 2010. There are two companies; the first being a new company, to be re- registered with the name \\"Northern Rock plc\\", which contains the bank's retail and wholesale deposit business, and the second being the current Northern Rock plc renamed to \\"Northern Rock (Asset Management) plc\\", which retains the balance of the bank's mortgage book, the Government loan, other borrowings, derivatives and certain wholesale deposits (held on behalf of Granite). The bank, \\"Northern Rock plc\\", would be offering new savings and mortgage products, but the other company, \\"Northern Rock (Asset Management) plc\\", will not. The subsidiary in Guernsey, Northern Rock (Guernsey) Limited, and all Irish accounts are owned by the new Northern Rock plc. After the split there are two boards of directors; Ron Sandler is the Chairman of the new Northern Rock plc and Richard Pym is Chairman of the Asset Management company. Gary Hoffman is Chief Executive of both companies. On 10 March 2010 Northern Rock (Asset Management) plc announced that for the year 2009 the company made a better than expected loss of ¬£257.4 million; this was a vast improvement on the previous year's losses of ¬£1.36 billion. As a part of the restructuring the Guernsey business was shut down on 2 September 2010. Customers of the Guernsey business were given three months notice. The ‚Ç¨650 million worth of Irish deposits were sold to Permanent TSB in 2011. On 23 July 2012 it was announced that Virgin would be acquiring ¬£465 million worth of mortgage assets from Northern Rock (Asset Management) plc. In July 2013, private equity firm JC Flowers agreed to buy $450 million of the bank's loans from the British Government. In December 2012 an administrative error was uncovered in the wording of the loan agreements made by the bank in 2008 for around 152,000 customers; the error may cost an estimated ¬£270 million. As a result of the error the affected customers, who were borrowing ¬£25,000 or less, may be entitled to a repayment of interest.  Bradford & Bingley mortgage book merger  Around the time of the nationalisation of Bradford & Bingley's mortgage book the press suggested that merging it with Northern Rock was a possibility. In October 2008 the chairman Ron Sandler noted that there had been informal talks concerning the idea of the merger with the government, but there had been no subsequent discussion. Sandler did however add \\"It would not surprise me at some point if a closer look was taken at the method of managing loan books within government-owned banks\\". In March 2009 Alistair Darling said that he was keeping his options open during the \\"fast-moving\\" crisis in the banking industry, and thus not ruling out the possibility of a mortgage book merger between Northern Rock and Bradford & Bingley. On 24 March 2010 UKFI announced its intention to integrate Northern Rock (Asset Management) plc and Bradford & Bingley plc under a single holding company. On 1 October it was announced that Bradford & Bingley plc and Northern Rock (Asset Management) plc had been merged under a single holding company UK Asset Resolution Ltd. In 2014 the Northern Rock name disappeared from asset management company's name as it became NRAM plc. In 2015 UKFI announced that it will seek expressions of interest for the divestment of mortgage servicing capabilities of the NRAM business as well as the Granite securitisation vehicle. UKFI have appointed Moelis & Company as advisers for the divestments. = Remutualisation proposals = In September and October 2009 various groups of people, including the Building Societies Association, called for the Northern Rock to be remutualised. Treasury minister Sarah McCarthy-Fry said that the idea of mutualisation had not been ruled out. The Northern Rock Building Society had previously been de-mutualised in 1997, to become a bank. In the Labour Party's 2010 Manifesto there was a mention of a possible \\"mutual solution\\" for Northern Rock. The Liberal Democrat's Manifesto noted that the party would have turned Northern Rock into a building society. On 1 February it was reported that Yorkshire Building Society were interested in Northern Rock. It has also been reported that Nationwide Building Society are not interested in the bank. On 31 March 2011 the Coventry Building Society expressed an interest in remutualising Northern Rock as a part of Coventry.  Sale to Virgin Money  A branch of the Northern rock with partial Virgin Money branding on Briggate in Leeds. The rebranded Virgin Money Northumberland Street store, Newcastle upon Tyne. During 2011 the government encouraged another round of bidding for the bank. By the first round deadline on 28 July Virgin Money and JC Flowers put forward their expressions of interest. In late October Virgin Money submitted their 2nd round bid for the bank. The following day NBNK rejoined the bidding process for the bank, leaving only NBNK and Virgin as contenders. This came as the restriction on NBNK from Hoffman's appointment expired; at this time NBNK were also preparing a bid for 632 branches of Lloyds. On 17 November 2011 it was announced that Virgin Money Holdings (UK) Limited were going to buy Northern Rock from UKFI for ¬£747 million up front and other potential payments of up to ¬£280 million over the next few years. These additional payments which would take the value of the sale to over ¬£1 billion could include a ¬£150 million capital instrument and an additional cash consideration of ¬£50‚Äì80 million would be paid upon a future profitable IPO or sale in the next five years. A ¬£73 million deferred consideration was paid by Virgin by July 2012. In 2014 Virgin Money repaid a further ¬£154.5 million that it had received as part of the refinancing package. The sale went through on 1 January 2012. The government said it had no plans to sell Northern Rock (Asset Management). There will be no further job losses for at least three years, except for the ones already announced previously. Virgin have also pledged to keep the headquarters of the new Virgin Money bank (savings and mortgages) in Newcastle upon Tyne. The deal is pending regulatory and EU merger approval, and the combined business will operate under the Virgin Money brand. The deal with Virgin included jobs for 2,100 employees, around a million of Northern Rock's customers, 75 branches and around a ¬£14bn mortgage book and a ¬£16bn retail deposit book. Although the deal means that the British government are to lose hundreds of millions on the deal, they claim that this represented the best deal for the taxpayer. The purchase was funded by the Virgin Group and WL Ross & Co., and Virgin hope that the new enlarged Virgin Money with its 4 million customers will be \\"a significant new competitor in UK retail banking\\". WL Ross has a 44% stake in the enlarged Virgin Money ‚Äì this is larger than his stake in Virgin Money after their purchase of Church House Trust in 2010. The deals with the Northern Rock Foundation will be extended to at least 2013, giving Virgin and the Foundation time to agree how they will work together. The new Virgin Money also aims lend ¬£45bn in total to support its customers over the next five years. The enlarged Virgin Money is led by Sir David Clementi, as Chairman, and Jayne-Anne Gadhia, as Chief Executive Officer. The National Audit Office are to investigate the sale of the bank to Virgin. the company operates under the Virgin Money brand. On 12 October 2012 Northern Rock plc was renamed Virgin Money plc, and Virgin Money Limited was renamed Northern Rock Limited. The Northern Rock website became a redirect to Virgin Money's website. In October 2014, it was announced that Virgin Money Holdings (UK) plc would float shares on the London Stock Exchange in order to raise approximately ¬£150 million which would go towards expanding and enabling it to continue to hire and maintain its existing base of top staff members. The successful offer led to a final payment of ¬£50 million to the UK Government with respect to the company's IPO following the purchase of Northern Rock. Subsequently, in 2018 Virgin Money UK was itself was acquired by the larger CYBG plc, operator of Clydesdale Bank and Yorkshire Bank, for ¬£1.7bn.

She is the daughter of Edgar Linton and Catherine Earnshaw. Despite Heathcliff's attempts at exacting revenge on her for the indiscretions of her family, she eventually marries her true love, Hareton Earnshaw. In this way, she establishes equilibrium back in the story.  Story  Cathy is a very curious and mischievous girl. When thirteen years old, she seeks out Wuthering Heights, the house to which she is not allowed to travel because Heathcliff, Edgar's enemy, resides there. On arrival she meets Hareton Earnshaw, the nephew of her mother. Nelly, who travels with her, insists that he is her cousin. Cathy is genuinely amazed and a bit shocked at his coarse, uneducated language, his dirty clothes and his savage manner. She disapproves that there is no way that it could be so. On her second visit, which Nelly desperately tries to prevent, Heathcliff meets her for the first time. He greets her in a warm and kind manner, although we know that he blames her for the death of his soul mate, her mother. He tells Nelly that he means no harm; he only wants Cathy and his own son, Linton, to fall in love and be married. As a result of his encouragement, Cathy and Linton get close to each other. When Nelly forbids Cathy from visiting Wuthering Heights and the bitter tyrant Heathcliff, Cathy and Linton write love letters to each other. It soon becomes clear that Heathcliff's plan of their marriage is a part of his endeavour to get revenge from Edgar and his daughter: Catherine will marry Linton, willingly or unwillingly. Nelly finds the childish love letters and burns them. Linton's letters are so attractive that most likely Heathcliff wrote them to draw Cathy to the Heights. Nelly thinks their relationship is over but discovers later that Cathy has been making more visits to Wuthering Heights. Feeling distressed, Edgar falls ill while Heathcliff keeps Cathy and Nelly at the Heights until Catherine finally agrees to marry Linton. Desperate to see her father once more before he dies, she consents, and her fate at Wuthering Heights is sealed. Edgar dies, kissing his daughter on the cheek, knowing that Thrushcross Grange, the Linton household, is now in the hands of his enemy. Linton, who does not at all resemble his father and is almost like his mother, falls ill as well and dies shortly after his marriage. Heathcliff forces him in his dying moments to bequeath everything to him, nothing to Catherine. As a result, it seems that Catherine, now cold and distant because of her understandable misery, is yet another character destined for an unhappy life. Eventually, an unlikely romance brews between her and Hareton: after long having shrugged off his attempts at winning her affection, she begins to aid him in his education. Heathcliff sees the love between the two blossom and because he has a grudging soft spot for Hareton, he no longer finds pleasure in degrading them. Heathcliff begins to see Hareton as an adopted son, as a poor stable boy robbed of his inheritance and love. He no longer stands between Hareton and Catherine, seeing it as a pointless endeavour and revenge against himself, he cannot stop the two lovers any more. Heathcliff dies and is buried next to Catherine Earnshaw, his true love. Catherine and Hareton make plans to marry on New Year's Day, and to reside at Thrushcross Grange.  Description  Although she is Cathy Earnshaw's daughter, she resembles her father more in looks, with golden ringlets and fair skin. The only qualities that she inherits from her mother are the beautiful \\"Earnshaw eyes\\" (which also belong to her future husband, Hareton Earnshaw) and her wayward, mischievous spirit. At first, Catherine is gentle and kind, but a bit snobbish because of her guarded and wealthy upbringing at the Grange; however, when reduced to a life of misery at the Heights, she grows cold, distant, and dismissive of everyone around her. It is her romance with Hareton that brings her to a happy life and grows the charm of her personality.

Stay Alive was republished with a smaller board by Winning Moves Games USA in 2005. This game is no longer in production.  Gameplay  Each player starts the game with a number of marbles in their own color. Players adjust the slides on the board randomly to create a starting board. Starting with a randomly chosen player, players take turns placing their marbles onto the board until all marbles are placed. The start player then chooses a slider and moves it one click either towards or away from the board. Each slider has holes in different locations in it and, as each is moved, the holes can align and allow marbles to fall through. The next player then chooses a slide and moves it, with the one rule that he or she cannot choose the same slide as the player before him or her did.

Life Stradling was born at St Donat's Castle, Wales to Sir John Stradling, Baronet and travelled to France and Italy before studying at the University of Oxford. He entered Jesus College, Oxford in 1638 when he was 17 years old and obtained his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1640. He was noted as a talented lutenist. In 1641, he was made a Fellow of All Souls' College, Oxford, where Gilbert Sheldon was Warden, and he later obtained his Master of Arts (1647) and Doctor of Divinity (1661) degrees. He was also a Fellow of Jesus College from 1641 to 1642. He fought on the Royalist side during the English Civil War as a cornet of horse in his brother's regiment. He returned to Oxford when the fighting was over, and survived the threat of ejection by the Parliamentary Visitors in control of the university with the help of Edmund Ludlow, a prominent Parliamentarian and his nephew by marriage. He was ordained deacon and priest by the Bishop of Oxford, Robert Skinner, on 7 November 1660 and became Sheldon's chaplain in London (Sheldon having become Bishop of London by this time) rather than become Principal of Jesus College. With Sheldon's influence, Stradling was able to obtain many benefices, which he held at the same time (as a pluralist). He held positions, at one time or another, at parishes in Fulham and St Bride's Church, Fleet Street (London), Hanwell (Middlesex), Cliffe-at- Hoo and Sutton-at-Hone (Kent). He was also canon of St Paul's Cathedral and of Westminster Abbey: appointed to both in 1660, he was still holding these posts when he died. In 1671, he became precentor of Chichester Cathedral and was made dean in 1672, again holding both posts until his death. Despite being a pluralist, Stradling presided at meetings of the cathedral chapter at least once in every year and also helped to repair and improve the cathedral after the effects of the Civil War. However, he clashed with the Bishop of Chichester, Guy Carleton, who regarded Stradling as lukewarm and indifferent. Stradling died on 19 April 1688 and was buried at Westminster Abbey. He published one sermon during his lifetime, with others being published after his death.

Starting in 1950, the series aired on the DuMont Television Network until the network's demise in 1955. The series' creator was Lynn Poole, who wrote or co-wrote most of its episodes and acted as the on-camera host. The original series was followed by three related series produced by Poole at Johns Hopkins University: Tomorrow (1955), Tomorrow's Careers (1955-1956), and Johns Hopkins File 7 (1956-1960). Johns Hopkins University ended its production of television series in 1960. Broadcast history The original series aired from March 9, 1948, to March 6, 1955. Initially, the show was broadcast only in the Baltimore area. Starting with the December 17, 1948, episode, shows were broadcast by CBS from stations along the east coast. As was typical in the early days of television broadcasting, each show was broadcast live from a studio at Johns Hopkins University. Each week's show involved one or more guests, often from the Johns Hopkins faculty and staff. Poole acted as the host and interviewer. The guest might show how a scientific apparatus such an electron microscope or an oscilloscope worked, or would briefly explain scientific ideas to the viewers. In the December 5, 1950, episode, the live broadcast of a fluoroscope screen was used by doctors in New York and Chicago to diagnose the injuries to a machinist in the hospital in Baltimore. In the April 21, 1952, episode, a scientist drank a solution containing the radioactive isotope of iodine, and then followed its progress in his own body with a Geiger counter. The guests were sometimes national figures like Wernher von Braun (October 20, 1952), George Gamov, and Harold Urey. The show famously showed a live birth and gave instructions to women viewers about breast self-examination. Each half-hour episode was broadcast from WAAM in Baltimore. The series moved to the DuMont Television Network in November 1949 through station WMAR. The program aired Tuesdays at 8:30 pm EST during the 1950-51 season, Mondays at 8:30pm EST during the 1951-52 season, and Wednesdays at 8pm EST during the 1952-53 season. According to the 1953-54 United States network television schedule, the show remained in the Wednesday at 8pm EST slot for the 1953-54 season. The series would win the network Peabody Awards in 1950 (honorable mention) and 1952. A spin-off program, Johns Hopkins File 7, aired on a syndicated basis from 1956 to 1960. Like the Review, File 7 was broadcast by WAAM and featured host Lynn Poole.Brooks, Tim and Earle Marsh (1985). The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network TV Shows 1946 to Present p. 433. Ballantine: New York. . Archives Approximately 303 episodes of the original series were made. There are records of 238 episodes, and kinescope films from 186 episodes, stored in Special Collections of the Milton Eisenhower Library at Johns Hopkins University. The title, original date of broadcast, an abstract, and credits are given for each episode with a surviving kinescope. This means it has the most surviving episodes of any DuMont Network program. The earliest surviving kinescope is from November 21, 1950. At least three episodes survive at the UCLA Film and Television Archive. In addition, Johns Hopkins University has records and films of the three successor series.  Retrospective Reception  In 2002, Patrick Lucanio and Gary Coville wrote that, \\"In retrospect, Lynn Poole created one of those unique series that allowed television to fulfill its idealized mission as both an educational and an entertainment medium.\\" Johns Hopkins Magazine declared in 2019 that the show was \\"ahead of its time\\" for its frank approach to educating its viewers on matter of science, especially biology.

Produced by Halifax Film, in association with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and distributed by Decode Entertainment, the series premiered in Canada on CBC Television as part of the Kids' CBC in 2007. In the United States, it premiered on The Hub on October 11, 2010. The Canadian French or French-Canadian/Qu√©b√©cois version of Animal Mechanicals is indeed to be called; or retitled as; Les Super M√©canimaux; in fact in which also airs on the Canadian French-language free-to-air television network Ici Radio-Canada T√©l√©; in which the French-Canadian stars Nicolas Charbonneaux- Collombet as Rex, √âveline G√©linas as Unicorn/Licorne, Fran√ßois Caffiaux as Komodo, Catherine Brunet as Mouse/Petite Souris, and Denis Roy as Sasquatch. In 2019, the series was revived through the release of new nonverbal web- shorts produced by WildBrain Spark Studios, a subsidiary of WildBrain that produces original content for the WildBrain Spark network.  Cast Mouse - Abigail Gordon *Unicorn - Leah Ostry *Rex - Jim Fowler *Sasquatch - Ian MacDougall *Komodo - Shannon Lynch *Island Owl - Lenore Zann =Main characters= Rex Rex is a green Mechana-tyrannosaurus. His enhanced ability is strength. Often, when utilizing this ability, Unicorn refers to him as being \\"strong like a titanium Tyrannosaurus\\" which, along with his name and bipedal shape, would indicate that he is a robotic Tyrannosaurus rex. He is the leader of the Animal Mechanicals when they are on their journey to their mission. When he transforms, he becomes a cross between a forklift, a tractor, and a digger. He also has an obsession with food. He is voiced by Jim Fowler; and/or Nicolas Charbonneaux-Collombet in French Canadian.\\"That's a Wrap\\" Film Nova Scotia, Production Catalogue 2007-2008, p. 18. Retrieved 2012-06-16. Komodo Komodo is a red Mechana-Komodo dragon who walks on two legs and has big, squared-off blue spectacles. His enhancement is the ability to change his tail into a selection of tools, such as a hammer or a screwdriver. Often, when utilizing this ability, Unicorn refers to him as being \\"handy dandy tool time.\\" This does, however, involve him working backwards to the line of the problem, forcing him to bend almost in half in order to see what he is doing. He is shown to be very intelligent, often figuring out the small details of the problem in hand. He tends to act like a martial arts expert. In a few episodes, he reveals that he has a sensitive stomach and legs. He often has to warn Sasquatch about \\"traps\\", and is the only Animal Mechanical to have more than one stock footage sequence. As a running gag for whenever he uses his powers, something random would be selected by mistake, including a rubber ducky, a submarine sandwich, and a teddy bear among others. He is voiced by Shannon Lynch; and/or Fran√ßois Caffiaux in French Canadian. Sasquatch Sasquatch is a blue Mechana-Sasquatch who has the enhanced ability to stretch. Each of his limbs extend to an incredible length. When stretched his individual limbs are long, however his joints do not alter and bend as normal. In the episode, \\"Baboon Balloon Island\\", it was revealed that he is allergic to air pears and in \\"Balloon Baboon Island\\" and \\"Mechana Ski Ball Island\\", he has anxiety and a fear of heights. He has referred to himself many times as The Mighty Sasquatch. Whenever Mouse is scared, he always comes to hold her hand (as seen in Jigsaw Shark Puzzle and Chugboat Island), but whenever he's scared or impatient (as seen in Dino Mountain Island and Snail Pace Island), Mouse always comes to hold his hand. Sasquatch often disobeys Komodo's warnings. He is voiced by Ian MacDougall; and/or Denis Roy in French Canadian. Mouse Mouse is a yellow Mechana-mouse who is the youngest in the group and runs about on two wheels instead of her back feet. Her ability is Mechana-Fast, which is increased by lying flat, with her front paws on the ground, which also have wheels on them, and flattening her ears to the side of her head and extending exhaust pipes which help to propel her forwards. Her ears act like satellite dishes to catch sounds. She sometimes laughs and giggles before Sasquatch transforms and can fit to tight places her friends can't. Whenever Sasquatch is afraid or impatient, she always come to hold his hand. But when she is scared, Sasquatch is always there to hold her hand. She also has the ability to understand creatures. She is voiced by Abigail Gordon; and/or Catherine Brunet in French Canadian. Island Owl Island Owl is the team's commander that only appears at the start of each episode, giving the team's their mission. Her head resembles a television set, which starts each briefing showing her face, then changes to show a representation of the island to which the animal mechanicals are to be sent. She does accompany the Animal Mechanicals, after they have left to go on their mission as she is never heard from or seen again; however she is mentioned by Komodo whenever someone breaks a rule. She is voiced by Lenore Zann (seasons 1-3 only); and later voiced by Animaniacs star CA Spirit Regina (for later seasons and reruns only). Episodes Broadcast Animal Mechanicals is broadcast in Canada on CBC TelevisionCBC.ca - Program Guide in the Kids' CBC programming block, weekdays at 7:30 a.m. It was also broadcast in Southeast Asia on the Disney Junior channel. and it broadcast in the United Kingdom on Disney Junior.

It is often referred to as a \\"time capsule\\" because it has been virtually untouched since the Victorian era. The Skolfields The Skolfield‚ÄìWhittier House is one half of an Italiante-style duplex built between 1858 and 1862 for the sons of wealthy shipbuilder Master George Skolfield (1780‚Äì1866). Captain Alfred Skolfield (1815‚Äì1895) owned the side that is now known as the Skolfield‚ÄìWhitter House, splitting the construction cost of $15,751.96 with his brother Captain Samuel Skolfield (1826‚Äì1916), who owned and lived in the other side of the building (now used as the Pejepscot Historical Society headquarters).Skolfield‚ÄìWhittier House 2008 Tour Manual, page 6. Pejepscot Historical Society, 2008. In 1862 Alfred, his wife Martha Harward (1836‚Äì1904), and their young daughter Eugenie (1860‚Äì1951) moved into their new home. The family furnished the home with expensive furniture from Portland's Walter Corey Company, choosing a Rococo Revival style (much of this furniture remains in the home today). Several of the rooms also feature marble fireplaces with encaustic tile and stylish curtains. At this time the home was most likely lit by gaslight. In 1864 Martha gave birth to a second daughter, Augusta Marie (1864‚Äì1902).Hinkley, Marilyn J. The Skolfield‚ÄìWhittier House and its Occupants, 1857‚Äì1925, pages 23‚Äì29. Thesis, Cooperstown Graduate Program, 1983. =Move to England= In 1867, for reasons that are not entirely clear, Alfred moved his family to Liverpool, England. It may be that political tensions developing during the Reconstruction era were the motivation for the move, as the Skolfields were staunch Democrats living in a region that was primarily Republican. After relocating to England, they did not sell their Brunswick home, choosing instead to rent it out to several different people during their absence. In 1868 Professor J.B. Sewall moved into the home, followed by Stephen O. Purington (1880‚Äì1882) and finally Dr. Mitchell (1883‚Äì1885), who in 1885 purchased the house next door and became the Skolfields' neighbor.Hinkley. The Skolfield‚ÄìWhittier House and its Occupants, pages 33‚Äì40. =Return to Brunswick and renovation of home= In 1885, after living abroad for 18 years, the Skolfields returned to their home and almost immediately began renovations. The plumbing was updated and the former carriage house renovated and attached to the rest of the building. The new space served to house the relocated kitchen, informal dining room, and laundry room. The former kitchen was converted and expanded to become a formal dining room, and the old dining room was renovated into a drawing room.Hinkley, The Skolfield‚ÄìWhittier House and its Occupants, page 48. The influence of English style upon the Skolfields is apparent in the renovations made to the house at this time. The family purchased many new decorations for the home in England, including carpets, a piano, a Chippendale wall bracket and several paintings by J.B. Smith, Spinks, Enser and Woolett. The Skolfields also updated their furniture by purchasing many pieces in the popular Eastlake style. English influence led the Skolfields to separate the bathtub and toilet added to the former carriage house into two separate rooms. In 1891, the home was wired for electricity and circa 1894‚Äì1895, the home was connected to the new town sewer lines.Hinkley, The Skolfield‚ÄìWhittier House and its Occupants, pages 48‚Äì61. The Whittiers The Skolfield‚ÄìWhittier House drawing room Alfred Skolfield died on June 1, 1895, but a new patriarch in the home would soon take his place. On June 24, Eugenie married Frank Whittier (1861‚Äì1924) in the drawing room, the most formal room of the house. Frank, a Phi Beta Kappa Bowdoin College graduate from Farmington, Maine, received his medical degree in 1889 and was appointed professor of Pathology and Bacteriology at the Maine Medical School (a now-defunct school of Bowdoin College) in 1891.Hinkley, The Skolfield‚ÄìWhittier House and its Occupants, pages 62‚Äì66. Frank was Maine's first forensic pathologist, and also took on responsibilities as the first medical examiner for Cumberland County, Brunswick milk inspector, and chairman of the Maine Medical Association's committee on venereal diseases. He appears to have been the first to use a serology test (to distinguish human blood from that of other animals) in a court of law, as well as the first to develop a test for ballistic fingerprinting.Dorman, Daniel M. A Matter of Life and Death; CSI Brunswick: The Forensic Work of Dr. Frank Whittier, pages 10‚Äì18. Pejepscot Historical Society, 2008. Frank and Eugenie made few changes to the home. Frank added a grandfather clock (believed to have been a Whittier family heirloom) to the entrance hall, and circa 1910‚Äì1912 the couple moved their master bedroom to the former carriage house. The former master bedroom was converted into the current library.Skolfield‚ÄìWhittier House 2008 Tour Manual, pages 7 & 21. By 1913, a telephone had been installed in the home.Hinkley, The Skolfield‚ÄìWhittier House and its Occupants, page 113. Eugenie and Frank had three daughters: Isabel (1896‚Äì1976), Alice (1898‚Äì1994) and Charlotte (1903‚Äì1912).Hinkley, The Skolfield‚ÄìWhittier House and its Occupants, page 157. Charlotte died at the age of 9 after accidentally catching on fire in the family kitchen.Skolfield‚ÄìWhittier House 2008 Tour Manual, page 14. Isabel and Alice both attended Bryn Mawr College, graduating in 1920 and 1921, respectively. Isabel became a teacher at Brooklyn College, where she taught for more than 30 years, and was a close friend of Margaret Chase Smith (there are many pictures of Smith scattered about the home). Meanwhile, Alice followed in her father's footsteps, setting up a practice in Portland to become Maine's first female pediatrician.Hinkley, The Skolfield‚ÄìWhittier House and its Occupants, pages 116‚Äì117. After Frank's death in 1924, Eugenie took up a life of travel, and she and her daughters usually spent only summers at their Brunswick home. In 1982, Alice, the last living member of the family, donated the entire home and its contents to the Pejepscot Historical Society.Hinkley, The Skolfield‚ÄìWhittier House and its Occupants, pages 116‚Äì120.

Treaty On October 26, 1832, the United States government entered negotiations with the Native American tribes of north-western Indiana seeking to purchase their land for white settlement. The United States was represented by three commissioners, former Governor of Indiana Jonathan Jennings, John Wesley Davis and Marks Crume. The United States had already purchased the Miami claim to the region in a previous treaty, and the Pottawatomie were the only natives who still held a claim in the region. The land purchased was most of the northwestern part of the state of Indiana. It was recorded in the treaty as: > beginning at a point on Lake Michigan, where the line dividing the States of > Indiana and Illinois intersects the saline thence with the margin of said > Lake, to the intersection of the southern boundary of a cession made by the > Pottawatomie, at the treaty of the Wabash, of eighteen hundred and twenty- > six; thence east, to the northwest corner of the cession made by the treaty > of St. Joseph's, in eighteen hundred and twenty-eight; thence south ten > miles; thence with the Indian boundary line to the Michigan road; thence > south with said road to the northern boundary line, air designated in the > treaty of eighteen hundred and twenty-six, with the Pottawatomie; thence > west with the Indian boundary line to the river Tippecanoe; thence with the > Indian boundary line, as established by the treaty of eighteen hundred and > eighteen, at St. Mary's to the line dividing the States of Indiana and > Illinois; and thence north, with the line dividing the said States, to the > place of beginning. The treaty provided for establishing a reserve for the Pottawatomie along the Yellow River, and to build a mill for them on that reservation. In exchange for the land, the Potawatomi tribe was granted an annual payment of $20,000 (USD) for a term of twenty years.

Barcel√≥ has its plant and distillery in San Pedro de Macor√≠s. Company history Following his dream of devising the best rum in the world, in 1929, a young Juli√°n Barcel√≥ from Spain arrived in Santo Domingo and founded Barcel√≥ & Co. Soon he began producing one of his first rums and selling it throughout the country. The optimum product was obtained by experimenting with different brands on the local market, and in 1950, the Ron Barcel√≥ brand was launched with the products Barcel√≥ Blanco and Dorado (white and gold rums respectively), which were an immediate success. Some 20 years later, Ron Barcel√≥ A√±ejo (a mature rum), was added to the portfolio. In 1974, Don Juli√°n Barcel√≥ handed over the reins of the business to his nephew Miguel Barcel√≥ and 6 years later, in 1980 Ron Barcel√≥ Imperial was born, premium emblematic rum, leader in its class since the day it was launched and the most internationally awarded Dominican rum. With the idea of expanding the brand, in the 90s Barcel√≥ & Co. gave a group of Spanish businessmen, with a long history of producing wines and spirits, the rights to export Ron Barcel√≥. These entrepreneurs founded Ron Barcel√≥ SRL.. In 2006, by then sold on 25 international markets, Ron Barcel√≥ SRL. took over Ron Barcel√≥ completely, with the third generation Barcel√≥'s, namely the Barcel√≥ D√≠az and Garcia families, remaining on the Board of Directors. That same year the bottles for Ron Barcel√≥ Imperial, Gran A√±ejo and A√±ejo were redesigned and a new era began. Nowadays, Ron Barcel√≥ SRL. still produces only Ron Barcel√≥, which is sold in over 50 countries, ranking it the 4th largest exporter of rum in the world.

He is the son of Hindley Earnshaw and Hindley's wife, Frances. At the end of the novel, he makes plans to wed Catherine Linton, with whom he falls in love.  Story  Frances dies shortly after giving birth in June 1778 to Hareton, which results in Hindley's descent into a life of anguish and inebriety, so Hareton is cared for and nursed by Nelly Dean, the primary narrator of the story. When Nelly leaves to reside at Thrushcross Grange with Catherine Earnshaw and Edgar Linton, Heathcliff seeks revenge on Hindley and gains control of Wuthering Heights. Hindley dies shortly after the decease of Catherine Earnshaw, and Heathcliff sets out to treat Hareton as cruelly and unjustly as Hindley treated him: he reduces Hareton to servant-boy status at the Heights. Nevertheless, Heathcliff's impulsive paternal instincts towards Hareton are revealed when, during one fraught episode in which Hindley's alcoholism takes him too far, he saves the infant from a potentially fatal fall from the top of the Heights' staircase. Because of the dark, savage environment in which he grows up, the boy becomes an ignorant, dirty and uneducated man, unable to read or write. When Cathy Linton comes to Wuthering Heights sixteen years later, Hareton has not changed, but it is apparent that he sees Heathcliff as his own father and loves him dearly. Heathcliff has a secret regard for Hareton as well, but he wishes him to feel the same pain that he himself experienced in childhood. Hareton forms an attraction to Cathy, but she dismisses it with disgust, insisting that he is a mindless, rude beast of a man. This only continues after Cathy's husband, Linton Heathcliff, dies, and Cathy becomes accustomed to the terror of Wuthering Heights. She grows just as rude and cold as its inhabitants, and, whenever Hareton expresses any amount of regard or tenderness towards her, she spurns it. Cathy and Hareton's relationship changes when, eventually, Cathy decides to help him with his secret self-education by teaching him how to read and talk properly. At first Hareton is uneasy about this, suspecting some patronising trickery, but it soon comes to be that the two fall in love. Heathcliff thus allows his emotions to take him over, and, because of his secret regard for Hareton (who in many ways resembles him), his sudden indifference about his enemies' destruction and his increasingly overwhelming desire to be with his soul mate Catherine Earnshaw, he lets the two continue their romance. Hareton is deeply hurt by his subsequent death, because he views Heathcliff as his true father. He kisses his corpse relentlessly, digging the grave with tears spilling down his cheeks. As Nelly points out, \\"poor Hareton, the most wronged, was the only one who really suffered much\\" for Heathcliff's demise: > He sat by the corpse all night, weeping in bitter earnest. He pressed its > hand, and kissed the sarcastic, savage face that every one else shrank from > contemplating; and bemoaned him with that strong grief which springs > naturally from a generous heart, though it be tough as tempered steel. At the close of Wuthering Heights, Cathy and Hareton plan to live in Thrushcross Grange and marry on New Year's Day, adding a sense of the happy ending to an otherwise dark story.  Description  Hareton is a broad- shouldered, strong man, with dark hair. Isabella Linton says that he has \\"a look of Catherine [Earnshaw] in his eyes\\", and indeed he and Catherine (Earnshaw) Linton both have the dark brown \\"Earnshaw eyes\\". He seems to carry Heathcliff's spirit, and the two have a strange regard for one another, in spite of the fact that Heathcliff has completely ruined his life. Heathcliff also sees Catherine Earnshaw in him, which would appear to make Hareton a source of pain. He sometimes tries to get along with Linton (Heathcliff's son), but didn't get well. His romance with Cathy Linton may partly explain why Heathcliff finally ends his life, potentially at peace, without taking any further revenge on anyone.

The property is a series of buildings scattered throughout a natural desert setting. Built in Tucson near the intersection of Swan Road and Skyline the property is now a museum open to the public. Construction began in 1951 with the open air Mission in the Sun followed by a series of other expressionistic adobe buildings. The gallery/museum was constructed in 1965 with details including cactus flooring, exposed wood beams, rafters and unique artistic finishes. The gallery replaced the first DeGrazia Building constructed in 1944 on the corner of Prince and Campbell Road. Artists and friends who spent time at the new gallery included Thomas Hart Benton, Olaf Wieghorst, Jack Van Ryder, Pete Martinez and Ross Santee. In 2006, the property, now a museum of DeGrazia's work, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The first building on the site, The Mission in the Sun was dedicated to Our Lady of Guadalupe and to the memory of Padre Eusebio Kino. DeGrazia hand painted every wall with murals and included a large painting of Our Lady of Guadalupe at the brick altar. Visitors have used the Mission as their own spiritual site often leaving photos, candles and other mementos. The Mission has also hosted many weddings throughout the years. On May 30, 2017 a fire heavily damaged the Mission. At the time of the fire there were no hanging pictures by DeGrazia inside the chapel, but walls, murals and the roof were damaged. Conservators began work to salvage and restore some of the artifacts. The walls were plastered over to secure what remained of the original murals, 80% of which were destroyed. One of the conservators is an artist personally mentored by DeGrazia. The restored chapel reopened to the public in the fall of 2019. Some of the fire damage was intentionally retained.

Summum, 555 U.S. 460 (2009), is a United States legal case relating to the Constitution's prohibition on a government establishment of religion specifically with respect to monuments (e.g., statues) on public land. Issue In this case, the United States Supreme Court considered whether the municipality of Pleasant Grove, Utah, which allows privately donated monuments, including one of the Ten Commandments, to be displayed on public property, must also let the Summum church put up its own statue, similar in size to the one of the Ten Commandments. According to the New York Times: \\"In 2003, the president of the Summum church wrote to the mayor here with a proposal: the church wanted to erect a monument inscribed with the Seven Aphorisms in the city park, 'similar in size and nature' to the one devoted to the Ten Commandments. The city declined, a lawsuit followed and a federal appeals court ruled that the First Amendment required the city to display the Summum monument.\\" The Supreme Court's decision was expected to be the most important establishment clause decision of the term. Some court- watchers believed the Court would rule that the United States Constitution does not allow government to favor one religion over another. Arguing for the petitioner (the City of Pleasant Grove) was Jay Alan Sekulow, chief counsel for the American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ), and for the Summum, attorney Pamela Harris of the firm O‚ÄôMelveny & Myers. The ACLJ argued that there should be a distinction between government speech and private speech and though the government should have the right to display the 10 Commandments, it should not have to endorse all private speech. Holding On February 25, 2009, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously against Summum in the Pleasant Grove case. Justice Samuel Alito, in his opinion for the court, explained that a municipality's acceptance and acquisition of a privately funded permanent monument erected in a public park, while refusing to accept other privately funded permanent memorials, is a valid expression of governmental speech, which is permissible and not an unconstitutional interference with the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech. According to Alito, \\"the display of a permanent monument in a public park\\" is perceived by an ordinary and reasonable observer to be an expression of values and ideas of the government, the owner of the park and the monument, even though the particular idea expressed by the monument is left to the interpretation of the individual observer. Alito made a clear distinction between forms of private speech in public parks, such as rallies and temporary holiday displays (Christmas trees and menorahs), and the government speech represented by permanent monuments. He opined that even long winded speakers eventually go home with their leaflets, and holiday displays are taken down; but, permanent monuments endure, and are obviously associated with their owners. Alito wrote, \\"cities and other jurisdictions take some care in accepting donated monuments.\\" While Summum attempted to persuade the Court that preventing governments from selecting monuments on the basis of content would be tenable, Justice Alito noted that such a situation could put government in the position of accepting permanent monuments with conflicting messages, that do not represent the values and ideals of the community, or removing all monuments from public space. Alito also questioned whether, if the law followed the view expressed by Summum, New York City would have been required to accept a Statue of Autocracy from the German Empire or Imperial Russia when it accepted the Statue of Liberty from France.

The Constitution's 32nd article specifies the rights granted by Mexican legislation to Mexicans who also possess dual nationality. This article was written to establish the norms in this subject in order to avoid conflicts which may arise in the case of dual nationality. This law was last modified in 2005. In general terms, Mexican nationality is based on both the principle of jus soli and the principle of jus sanguinis. The Mexican constitution also makes a distinction between nationals of Mexico and citizens of Mexico. Acquisition of nationality According to the 30th article of the Constitution of Mexico, there are two ways in which a person can acquire Mexican nationality: by birth or by naturalization.Art√≠culo 30 de la Constituci√≥n Pol√≠tica de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos. =Nationality by birth= The Mexican Constitution states that Mexican nationals by birth are: * people born in Mexican territory regardless of parents' nationality or immigration status in Mexico * people born abroad from a Mexican Citizen born in Mexico * people born to an individual after that person has become a naturalized citizen of Mexico * individuals born on Mexican merchant- or Navy ships or Mexican-registered aircraft, regardless of parents' nationality * children born to Mexican Diplomats or Ministry of Foreign Affairs Personnel working overseas =Nationality by naturalization= Mexicans by naturalization are: * those who obtain from the Secretariat of Foreign Affairs a letter of naturalization and * an individual married to a Mexican national residing in Mexico who fulfills the requirements set forth in the Mexican nationality law: to have lived with the spouse for two years immediately prior to the date of the application. The Nationality Law establishes also that a foreigner that wishes to naturalize must do the following:Ley de Nacionalidad. Secretar√≠a de Relaciones Exteriores. Law as of 2005 * present the application to the Secretariat of Foreign Affairs; * formulate the renunciation of the person's country of origin, and take the oath of sole nationality to Mexico. Once this has been given; * prove knowledge of Spanish and Mexican history; integration to the national culture; and * prove residence in Mexico for five years immediately prior to the submission of the application, or :* two years of residency if: ::* a direct descendant of a Mexican by birth; or ::* is the mother or father of a Mexican by birth; or :;* is a national of a Latin American or Iberian country; or ::* to the judgment of the Secretariat, she or he has performed or created outstanding works in a cultural, social, scientific, technical, artistic, sports or business area that benefit the nation, in which case, the foreigner is not required to have resided in the country for the number of years prescribed in the law; or :* one year of residency if adopted by a Mexican national, as well as all minors, who are second generation descendants or have been under tutelage of a Mexican national. Possession of Mexican nationality Mexican nationality entails several obligations set forth in the 31st article of the Constitution, namely:Art√≠culo 31 de la Constituci√≥n Pol√≠tica de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos * to take their children or pupils to public or private schools to receive preschool, primary and secondary education; as well as military education as and if required by the law; * to present themselves in the days and hours designated by the municipalities in which they reside to receive civic and military instruction; * to enlist and serve in the National Guard to defend the independence, territory, honor, rights and interest of the nation; * to contribute to the public expenditures through their taxes; Documents that serve as proof of nationality are the following: * birth certificates; * letter of naturalization; * passports; * national identity cards for minors (C√©dula de identitad personal), and * consular identity cards (Matricula consular) if they have a digital photograph, a magnetic band and a holographic identification. Mexican citizenship As in most other Central and South American countries, Mexican law differentiates between nationality and citizenship. Nationality is the attribute of the person in international law that describes their relationship to the State, whereas citizenship is given to those nationals (those who hold Mexican nationality) that have certain rights and responsibilities before the State. The 34th article of the Mexican constitution establishes that Mexican citizens are those Mexican [nationals] who are 18 years of age or older, and who have an \\"honest way of living\\". Mexican citizens have these rights:Art√≠culo 34 de la Constituci√≥n Pol√≠tica de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos * vote in all elections; * be elected in all elections * gather or associate freely to participate in the political affairs of the nation; * enlist in the Mexican Army or the Mexican National Guard to defend the Republic and its institutions, and * exercise the right of petition. Mexican law also distinguishes between naturalized citizens and natural-born citizens in many ways. Under the Mexican constitution, naturalized citizens are prohibited from serving in a wide array of positions, mostly governmental. Naturalized Mexicans cannot occupy any of following posts: * The Mexican military during peacetimeArt√≠culo 32 de la Constituci√≥n Pol√≠tica de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos * Policeman * Captain, pilot, or crew member on any Mexican-flagged vessel or aircraft * President of MexicoArt√≠culo 82 de la Constituci√≥n Pol√≠tica de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos * Member of the Congress of MexicoArt√≠culo 55 de la Constituci√≥n Pol√≠tica de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos * Member of the Supreme Court of MexicoArt√≠culo 95 de la Constituci√≥n Pol√≠tica de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos * Governor of a Mexican stateArt√≠culo 117 de la Constituci√≥n Pol√≠tica de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos * Mayor or member of the legislature of Mexico CityArt√≠culo 122 de la Constituci√≥n Pol√≠tica de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos Loss of nationality and loss of citizenship The 37th article of the constitution establishes that Mexicans by birth (natural born Mexicans) can never be deprived of their nationality,Art√≠culo 37 de la Constituci√≥n Pol√≠tica de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos as defined in the Nationality law, in the acquisition of another nationality. However, naturalized Mexicans may lose their nationality by doing the following: * voluntarily acquiring another nationality, presenting themselves as foreigners or accepting nobility titles that imply a submission to a foreign state; Even though Mexican nationals by birth can never involuntarily lose their nationality, Mexican citizenship, and thus its prerogatives, may be lost if a person does the following: * accepts nobility titles from foreign countries; * serves in a foreign government without the authorization of the Congress of the Union; * accepts or uses foreign distinctions, titles or functions, without the authorization of the Congress of the Union, with the exception of those that are literary, scientific or humanitarian in nature; * helps a foreign citizen or government against Mexico in any diplomatic claim or before an International Tribunal. Mexican nationals can give up their nationality for the purpose of acquiring another nationality. RENUNCIA DE LA NACIONALIDAD MEXICANA (POR NACIMIENTO Y POR NATURALIZACI√ìN) Multiple nationality The Mexican nationality law acknowledges that a Mexican by birth may possess another nationality. If that is the case, however, such an individual must always enter and leave the country as a Mexican (by presenting a Mexican proof of citizenship). The law also established that regardless of possession of another nationality, an individual will always be considered a Mexican national and cannot claim protection from a foreign country in certain cases: * participating in capital of an entity or a company if they are constituted according to the Mexican law; if * giving credits to such entities; and if * possessing property in Mexican territory. All Mexican nationals by birth who possess another nationality cannot be elected for or work in public office only in those cases that the law clearly establishes that they must not acquire another nationality. If in such a case, she or he can request a Certificate of Nationality from the government, renouncing the other nationality. Visa requirements Visa requirements for Mexican citizens Visa requirements for Mexican citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of Mexico. In 2018, Mexican citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 158 countries and territories, ranking the Mexican passport 21st in terms of travel freedom according to the Henley visa restrictions index.

E. M. Skues published in London in 1921. This was Skues's second book after Minor Tactics of the Chalk Stream (1910). Plate III - Another Method of Dressing Nymphs Synopsis The Way of a Trout was originally intended to be a treatise on the theory and practice of dressing trout flies but, by Skues's own admission, does not do a very good job of it. The book does include a number of original and interesting chapters on fly dressing and Skues's theories on the vision of trout. Additionally, the Minor Tactics section expands on Skues's exploration of nymph fishing for trout. Reviews In Notable Angling Literature (1945) James Robb said of Skues and The Way of a Trout: > He pursued the matter [Nymph fishing] with his striking books The Way of a > Trout with the Fly and Nymph Fishing for Chalk Stream Trout. Mr. Skues is a > useful antedote to the extremists who followed Halford and should be read > along with that author. To Mr. G. E. M. Skues anglers are indebted among > other things for his particular method of tying as well as for his > imitations of nymphs; they are given in his Minor Tactics of the Chalk > Stream and The Way of a Trout with the Fly. * In The Well-Tempered Angler (1965) Arnold Gingrich listed The Way of a Trout as one of the top 30 literary and technical books on fly fishing since the publication of the Treatyse of Fysshynge Wyth an Angle (1496) *Dr. Andrew Herd, noted British fly-fishing historian, characterizes The Way of The Trout: > This is a classic and I often wonder if Skues knew it would be when he set > pen to paper. The book is inspirational in a way that Halford's work never > was and grips the reader's attention right from the cover, which in the > first edition bears the words: ....

Career  Corri was born in Rome and studied voice with Nicola Porpora in Naples. The son of a confectioner in a religious house, the Cardinal Portocaro nearly persuaded young Corri to study for the priesthood; but his musical aptitude early asserting itself, he found himself in Naples, a pupil of Porpora. In the house of this prince of singing masters‚Äîhimself a pupil of Scarlatti and the world- renowned master of Mingotti and Farinelli‚ÄîCorri boarded for five years (1763-1767), and chiefly owed his introduction into the best English society at Rome to the fame of Porpora and the estimation in which that great singer was held by a section of our nobility.http://www.electricscotland.com/history/niddry/chapter04.htm In 1781 he moved to Scotland with his family to become an opera conductor. He became an important singing master in Edinburgh. Both his wife Sophia Bachelli and daughter (Sophia Giustina Corri), who was a talented singer and pianist, were pupils of his. He was manager of the Theatre Royal in Edinburgh, and also conducted the concerts of the musical society there. = Corri, Dussek & Co. = Some time after arriving in Edinburgh Corri founded a publishing business theresee Corri & Sutherland trade card held at the British Museum and dated c.1790 which gives their address as \\"Bridge Street, Edinburgh\\" with his son John Corri and a musician named James Sutherland. When Sutherland died in 1790 the company ceased to exist. Around that time he moved to London and began publishing vocal music in Soho while retaining business premises in Edinburgh.see Corri & Dussek's 'Amanti che nel core' imprint with both London and Edinburgh addresses. Corri had financial problems on several occasions. His son-in-law Jan Ladislav Dussek joined the company in 1794. When Corri, Dussek & Co. went bankrupt, Dussek left England for Germany, leaving behind his family, and his father-in-law (Corri) apparently in a debtor's jail. The business was later taken over in 1804 by his son Philippe Corri. An apprentice to Corri in London was Isaac Nathan. = Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens = Domenico Corri was also the manager of the Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens in London. In 1812, Corri organised a concert in the Argyll Rooms in Regent Street, London. In this, the favorite concert hall in London at this time, Corri put together quite a contrasting program as the evening's entertainment: Giovanni Battista Pergolesi's Stabat Mater combined with a Ball. Corri died in London, aged 78. Family Three of his children were musicians: Sophia Giustina Corri (1775‚Äì1831), who later used the name Sophia Corri Dussek, Philip Antony Corri (1784‚Äì1832), who later immigrated to Baltimore, MD using the name Arthur Clifton, and Haydn Corri (1785‚Äì1860). His brother Natale Corri, was also a composer. A niece, Fanny Corri-Paltoni, was a successful soprano. One of his descendants was puppeteer Christine Glanville.

She is the sister of Edgar Linton and the wife of Heathcliff.  Story  Isabella Linton was raised in the safe, elegant environment of Thrushcross Grange with her brother, Edgar. When Catherine Earnshaw of Wuthering Heights suffers an accident while intruding on the Grange, the Lintons take her in and transform her into a lady in five weeks and return with no sign of mischief being a part of her. When Heathcliff returns to the neighbourhood to exact revenge on the Lintons for Edgar's marriage to his true love Catherine, Isabella is irresistibly attracted to him. Catherine is deeply shocked by this, and playfully tells Heathcliff, enabling him to see a route to vengeance. Isabella, hurt by Catherine's betrayal, grows cold and distant to everyone around her, and, with everyone opposing a relationship with Heathcliff, \\"moped around in the garden\\" in great distress. Even more nervous is Edgar, who is suspicious of Heathcliff's mysterious return to the neighbourhood, but does not know what to do about it. It becomes apparent that Heathcliff is seducing Isabella when he \\"embraces her\\", much to Catherine's dislike. In explanation, Heathcliff reveals to her that he \\"will have his vengeance\\", and that he does not love Isabella: if Catherine wished him to marry her, he, \\"would cut his throat.\\" One night, it is revealed to Nelly Dean, a servant at Wuthering Heights and the primary narrator of the novel, that Isabella has run off with Heathcliff, although Edgar has warned her that, if she does so, he will cut off all ties with her. After several months, Heathcliff and Isabella marry, but she soon realises her mistake, sending a long letter to Nelly in which she details her hostile and displeasing \\"welcome\\" at the Heights and her hatred for Heathcliff, who has made it clear that he has married her only because he is now the heir to the Grange. Isabella is reduced to the status of the abused, hurt and degraded wife, and Nelly describes Heathcliff as looking like \\"the only one decent\\" in the household, while Isabella has seemingly lost the title of Miss Linton of Thrushcross Grange. Isabella grows to despise her vengeful, tyrannical husband. After Catherine dies, Isabella taunts Heathcliff by insisting that Cathy's death was entirely his fault. She also points out that Hindley Earnshaw, Catherine's brother and Heathcliff's greatest enemy, has the same eyes as her, despite Heathcliff's relentless attempts to \\"gouge them out\\". This provokes Heathcliff to a deep and passionate anger, which results in yet another brawl between himself and Hindley. Seeing it as a chance to flee, Isabella escapes Wuthering Heights and her disastrous, terrifying marriage once and for all. She describes the occurrence thus: > The back of the settle and Earnshaw's person interposed between me and him; > so instead of endeavouring to reach me, he snatched a dinner-knife from the > table and flung it at my head. It struck beneath my ear, and stopped the > sentence I was uttering; but, pulling it out, I sprang to the door and > delivered another; which I hope went a little deeper than his missile. The > last glimpse I caught of him was a furious rush on his part, checked by the > embrace of his host; and both fell locked together on the hearth. In my > flight through the kitchen I bid Joseph speed to his master; I knocked over > Hareton, who was hanging a litter of puppies from a chair-back in the > doorway; and, blessed as a soul escaped from purgatory, I bounded, leaped, > and flew down the steep road; then, quitting its windings, shot direct > across the moor, rolling over banks, and wading through marshes: > precipitating myself, in fact, towards the beacon-light of the Grange. And > far rather would I be condemned to a perpetual dwelling in the infernal > regions than, even for one night, abide beneath the roof of Wuthering > Heights again. After informing Nelly of how she pursued her escape, and paying one last visit to Thrushcross Grange, her childhood home, Isabella removes somewhere \\"south of London\\", where she gives birth to Heathcliff's son, Linton, who resembles Isabella in every aspect. The two lead a peaceful life for thirteen years, although no detail is given as to their activities. Edgar visits Isabella in her final illness, where she asks him to take charge of Linton, and raise him away from his father.  Description  Isabella inherits the blonde hair, blue eyes, and pale skin of the Linton family. Her son, Linton Heathcliff, also inherits these features. She is witty, sensitive, temperamental, and shallow. In the words of Nelly, Isabella \\"has a capacity for strong attachments\\", as shown in her falling hopelessly in love with Heathcliff, who in turn takes advantage of her blind affections, leading them both into their tormenting marriage.

The firm was founded by David Boies and Jonathan D. Schiller, in 1997, who, in 1999, were joined by Donald L. Flexner, former partner with Crowell & Moring, then forming Boies, Schiller & Flexner. The firm has become known for its involvement in high-profile litigation, having represented the Department of Justice in the antitrust action United States v. Microsoft, as well as Vice President Gore in the Supreme Court case Bush v. Gore. More recently, Boies successfully challenged the constitutionality of California's Proposition 8 in Perry v. Brown, and represented the National Football League in the antitrust litigation initiated by the players' union. The firm has drawn controversy for its aggressive tactics during representation of Harvey Weinstein amidst sexual abuse allegations and the now-defunct blood testing startup Theranos. Notable clients Among other high-profile clients, Boies Schiller has long represented film producer Harvey Weinstein, against whom sexual abuse allegations were levied in October 2017. The New Yorker reported in November 2017 that Boies Schiller had, on Weinstein's behalf, directed private intelligence companies, including Black Cube,Contract signed on July 11, 2017, by law firm Boies, Schiller & Flexner L.L.P. with Black Cube to stop the publication of sexual-misconduct allegations against Harvey Weinstein, The New Yorker, November 2017. to spy on and orchestrate smear campaigns against alleged victims of Weinstein's and on reporters who were investigating Weinstein's actions. The New York Times, which was at the same time a target of the reported espionage and a client of Boies Schiller's, considered this \\"intolerable conduct\\". The New York Times announced a few days later it had \\"terminated its relationship\\" with Boies' firm. Boies Schiller, and specifically David Boies himself, notably represented Theranos for several years, including against the fraud claims that toppled the blood-testing company. In Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup by The Wall Street Journal investigative reporter John Carreyrou, the firm is described as protecting the startup using surveillance of witnesses and journalists, weaponized use of non-disclosure agreements and affidavits, intimidation tactics, and other heavy-handed practices. Boies Schiller is portrayed by Carreyrou as acting as an extension of Theranos, including the use of the law firm's New York offices for hosting promotional meetings such as a faked blood test administered to Fortune writer Roger Parloff. According to Carreyrou, the firm agreed to be paid in Theranos stock, and Boies himself served on the Theranos board of directors, raising questions about conflicts of interest. Boies Schiller ended its representation of Theranos in November 2016 due to disagreements about legal strategy. Former Theranos general counsel Heather King was hired back by Boies Schiller after having served as the general counsel at Theranos. King had previously been a lawyer at Boies Schiller during its representation of Theranos, and she, David Boies, and lawyer Michael Brille featured prominently in Bad Blood. The firm also represents Amazon in corporate matters, and Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos personally retained attorneys from Boies Schiller as part of his crisis- management team in the wake of Bezos's claims of extortion by AMI.  Political contributions  According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Boies Schiller was one of the top law firms contributing to federal candidates during the 2012 election cycle, donating $1.92 million, 90% to Democrats.

Supergrasses  Throughout the 1970s, the supergrass was a feared tool that the police had begun using which is generally considered to have begun with Bertie Smalls, who, faced with a hefty prison sentence for his part in leading his gang of armed robbers, the 'Wembley Mob', decided to turn 'Queen's Evidence' against his fellow thieves which resulted in them receiving heavy prison sentences whilst Smalls was granted immunity from prosecution. Although after the Smalls trial immunity could no longer be granted, criminals who turned supergrass could expect to be rewarded with the 'supergrass tariff', normally a sentence of around five years, most of which would be spent in police custody.  Early successes  In May 1977 Lundy, then a Detective Chief Inspector, rejoined the flying squad. His first success was with David Smith in September of that year. Smith was involved in a wages snatch in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, along with George Williams, who too turned supergrass. Smith's confession resulted in sixty nine people being charged, of which ninety per cent pleaded guilty. Lundy was also involved in the initial investigation into Harry MacKenny and John Childs, who was the first serial murderer in modern times to turn supergrass.  Retirement  Lundy retired from the Metropolitan Police in 1988 on ill-health grounds suffering from stress. He was investigated in October 1994 and the Crown Prosecution Service stated they had found no evidence to prosecute Lundy. Lundy stated that throughout the investigation he had not once been interviewed.Police Review, 28 October 1994 He also sold his story to the News of the World, entitled 'Bent or Brilliant?'

They honoured the forces of nature, saw the world as inhabited by many spirits, and saw the Divine manifesting in aspects of the natural world. The sacred land The Celts of the ancient world believed that many spirits and divine beings inhabited the world around them, and that humans could establish a rapport with these beings. The archaeological and the literary record indicate that ritual practice in Celtic societies lacked a clear distinction between the sacred and profane; rituals, offerings, and correct behaviour maintained a balance between gods, spirits and humans and harnessed supernatural forces for the benefit of the community. The pagan Celts perceived the presence of the supernatural as integral to, and interwoven with, the material world. Every mountain, river, spring, marsh, tree and rocky outcrop was inspirited. While the polytheistic cultures of ancient Greece and Rome revolved around urban life, ancient Celtic society was predominantly rural. The close link with the natural world is reflected in what we know of the religious systems of Celtic Europe during the late 1st millennium BCE and early 1st millennium CE. As in many polytheistic systems, the local spirits honoured were those of both the wild and cultivated landscapes and their inhabitants. As Anne Ross observed: \\"... god-types, as opposed to individual universal Gaulish deities, are to be looked for as an important feature of the religion of the Gauls ... and the evidence of epigraphy strongly supports this conclusion.\\" As what some may consider spirits are considered by other authors to be deities, the list of Celtic deities derived from local inscriptions can at times be rather long. The ancient Celts venerated the spirits who inhabited local mountains, forests and springs. Certain animals were seen as messengers of the spirits or gods. In tribal territories, the ground and waters which received the dead were imbued with sanctity and revered by their living relatives. Sanctuaries were sacred spaces separated from the ordinary world, often in natural locations such as springs, sacred groves, or lakes. Many topographical features were honored as the abodes of powerful spirits or deities, with geographical features named for tutelary deities. Offerings of jewelry, weapons or foodstuffs were placed in offering pits and bodies of water dedicated to these beings. These offerings linked the donor to the place and spirits in a concrete way.  Honouring the waters  The spirits of watery places were honoured as givers of life and as links between the physical realm and the other world. Sequana, for example, seems to have embodied the River Seine at its spring source, and Sulis appears to have been one and the same as the hot spring at Bath, Somerset, (Roman Aquae Sulis) not simply its guardian or possessor. Irish:Abhainn na Sionainne) County Leitrim, Ireland In Ireland, the tutelary goddesses Boann and Sionnan give their names to the rivers Boyne and Shannon, and the tales of these goddesses are the origin stories of the rivers themselves. The threefold goddess Brighid is associated with a number of holy wells and The Morr√≠gan is connected with the River Unius. There is abundant evidence for the veneration of water by the Celts and indeed by their Bronze Age forebears. In the Pre-Roman Iron Age, lakes, rivers, springs and bogs received special offerings of metalwork, wooden objects, animals and, occasionally, of human beings. By the Roman period, the names of some water- deities were recorded on inscriptions or were included in contemporary texts. The ancient name for the River Marne was Dea Matrona (Goddess Matron); the Seine was Sequana; the Severn, Sabrina; the Wharfe, Verbeia; the Sa√¥ne, Souconna; there are countless others. Natural springs were foci for healing cults: Sulis was prayed to as a healer at Aquae Sulis and the goddess Arnemetia was hailed as a healer at Aquae Arnemetiae. Nemausus, for example, was not only the Gallic name for the town of N√Æmes but also that of its presiding spring-god. He had a set of three female counterparts, the Nemausicae. In the same region, the town of Glanum possessed a god called Glanis: an altar from a sacred spring is inscribed to Glanis and the Glanicae.  Spirits of the weather and the skies  The Corryvreckan whirlpool (Scottish Gaelic: Coire Bhreacain - 'cauldron of the plaid') washtub of the Cailleach Meteorological patterns and phenomena, especially wind, rain and thunder, were acknowledged as inspirited and propitiated. Inscribed dedications and iconography in the Roman period show that these spirits were personifications of natural forces. Taranis's name indicates not that he was the god of thunder but that he actually was thunder. Archaeological evidence suggests that the thunder was perceived as especially potent. Inscriptions to Taranis the 'Thunderer' have been found in Britain, Gaul, Germany and the former Yugoslavia and the Roman poet Lucan mentions him as a savage god who demanded human sacrifice. In the insular Celtic lands, Lugh is seen as a god of the storms, as are the Cailleachan ‚Äì Scottish storm hags ‚Äì and the Cailleach herself, who brings the first winter snows to the land by washing her great plaid (Gaelic: f√©ileadh m√≤r) in the Whirlpool of Coire Bhreacain. This process is said to take three days, during which the roar of the coming tempest is heard as far away as inland. When she is finished, her plaid is pure white and snow covers the land. From the early Bronze Age, people in much of temperate Europe used the spoked wheel to represent Taranis. The Romans imported their own celestial god, Jupiter, to continental Celtic lands by interpretatio Romana, and his imagery was merged with that of a native deity to produce a hybrid sky-deity who resembled the Roman god but who had additional solar attributes. Altars decorated with wheels were set up by Roman soldiers stationed at Hadrian's Wall, and also by supplicants in Cologne and N√Æmes.  Sacred trees  The Celts believed that trees had spirits and revered certain trees. The most sacred trees of Ireland were the b√≠le trees - old, sacred trees that stood in a central area and were often the social and ceremonial meeting place for a tribe or village. According to the Dindsenchas (lore of Irish places), the five sacred b√≠les of Ireland were the Ash of Tortu, the Bole of Ross (a yew tree), the Oak of Mugna, and the Ash of Dathi. These trees were associated with the five Irish provinces then in existence.  Animals as omens and emblems  Among both the Continental and Insular Celts, the behaviour of certain animals and birds were observed for omens, and certain spirits were closely associated with particular animals. The names of Artio, the ursine goddess, and Epona, the equine goddess, are based on Celtic words for bear and horse, respectively. In Ireland, the Morr√≠gan is associated with crows, wolves, and horses, among other creatures, and in Scotland Brighid's animals include snakes and cattle. Certain creatures were observed to have particular physical and mental qualities and characteristics, and distinctive patterns of behaviour. An animal like a stag or horse could be admired for its beauty, speed, or virility. Dogs were seen to be keen-scented, good at hunting, guarding, and healing. Deer (who shed antlers) suggest cycles of growth; in Ireland they are sacred to the goddess Flidais, while in Scotland they are guarded by the Cailleach. Snakes were seen to be emblematic of long (possibly eternal) life, being able to shed their skin and renew themselves. Beavers were seen to be skillful workers in wood. Thus admiration and acknowledgment for a beast's essential nature led easily to reverence of those qualities and abilities which humans did not possess at all or possessed only partially.  The hunt  Hunting deities, whose role acknowledges the economic importance of animals and the ritual of the hunt, highlight a different relationship to nature. The animal elements in half-human, antlered deities suggest that the forest and its denizens possessed a numinous quality as well as an economic value. Hunter-gods were venerated among the Continental Celts, and they often seem to have had an ambivalent role as protector both of the hunter and the prey, not unlike the functions of Diana and Artemis in classical mythology. From Gaul, the armed deer-hunter depicted on an image from the temple of Le Donon in the Vosges lays his hands in benediction on the antlers of his stag companion. The hunter-god from Le Touget in Gers carries a hare tenderly in his arms. Arduinna, the eponymous boar-goddess of the Ardennes, rides her ferocious quarry, knife in hand, whilst the boar-god of Euffigneix in the Haute-Marne is portrayed with the motif of a boar with bristles erect, striding along his torso, which implies conflation between the human animal perception of divinity. Arawn of Welsh mythology may represent the remnants of a similar hunter-god of the forests of Dyfed. Additionally, in Welsh mythology the hunting of a sacred stag often leads the hunters into the otherworld. As with many traditional societies, the hunt was probably hedged about with prohibitions and rituals. The Greek author Arrian, writing in the 2nd century CE, said that the Celts never went hunting without the gods' blessing and that they made payment of domestic animals to the supernatural powers in reparation for their theft of wild creatures from the landscape. Hunting itself may have been perceived as a symbolic, as well as practical, activity in which the spilling of blood led not only to the death of the beast but also to the earth's nourishment and replenishment.

In July 1991 they were bestowed the titles of Righteous among the Nations by Yad Vashem for rescuing fifteen Jews escaping the Holocaust from the ghetto in Przemy≈õl. Franciszek Banasiewicz (2 April 1884 ‚Äì 5 February 1954) was a decorative painter before the war. His wife Magdalena n√©e Lenar (7 July 1884 ‚Äì 28 September 1957) was a homemaker. Two Banasiewicz sons, Antoni and Tadeusz, were sent by the Nazi Germans to forced labour in the Third Reich when the war broke out. Tadeusz escaped and after returning home lived in hiding in barns and in the fields. His father, Franciszek, organised many heroic rescue missions with his aid. The Banasiewicz Family. Museum of the History of Polish Jews. Retrieved September 14, 2011. Initially, Franciszek Banasiewicz was approached by Salomon Ehrenfreud, who escaped the ghetto massacre of June 1942 having witnessed the death of his wife and children. He was hiding at the home of Jan Ko≈õciak a bit earlier. Tadeusz‚Äîalready staying out of sight‚Äîtook it upon himself to hide along with Salomon around the farm. Meanwhile, Franciszek started taking in other Jews including Salomon's brother, Izaak‚Äîpreviously helped by other Poles‚Äîhis cousin Jakub Nassan and their friends Marcel Teich and Junek Frenkiel. Helped by his own son, Franciszek brought from the ghetto Nassan's wife, Eugenia and her friend Fejga Weidenbaum. A week later he rescued Edmund Orner.W≈Çadys≈Çaw Bartoszewski, The Blood Shed Unites Us: Pages from the History of Help to the Jews Page 213  1970  243 pagesW≈Çadys≈Çaw Bartoszewski, Zofia Lewin, The Samaritans: Heroes of the Holocaust Published by Twayne Publishers, 1970, 442 pages The bunker Banasiewicz family and the fugitives began constructing a bunker under the house in the fall of 1943 in preparation for the cold Polish winter. The new hiding area enabled Banasiewiczs to rescue more people. In October 1943, on request of Salomon Ehrenfreud, Tadeusz smuggled out from the ghetto Bunia Stamhofer and Fela Szattner, then in January 1944, he rescued Samuel Reinharz with his brother Beniamin and their mother Bertha. He attempted to rescue Jozef Weindling, however, Jozef's brother, a ghetto policeman, arrested Tadeusz at that time, and passed him over to the Nazis. The German commander released him nonetheless, bribed by Samuel Reinharz, who then escaped with Tadeusz and Jozef back to the farm where all fifteen Jews were hiding. Public execution of Micha≈Ç Kruk in Przemy≈õl Maria Banasiewicz recalls how shocked though undeterred they were to learn that, in the nearby village of Tarnawce, farmer Kurpiel who sheltered 27 Jews in a bunker similar to theirs was discovered in May 1944.Lukasz Biedka, Chris Webb, Przemysl Holocaust Education & Archive Research Team 2007 All fugitives were murdered. Kurpiel with his wife and family was executed in Lipowica. Several months earlier, a similar fate met Banasiewiczs liaison with the Ghetto, Micha≈Ç Kruk. He was executed on 6 September 1943, during the first public execution in Przemy≈õl, along with several other people punished by death for the assistance they had rendered to the Jews. > In Przemy≈õl: 15,210 Jews lost their lives during the Holocaust, including > 568 non-Jewish Poles killed because they were attempting to save them.

All family members and Jewish escapees survived. In 1988 (or, on July 17, 1991, sources vary) the Banasiewicz family including Franciszek, Magdalena, Maria, Tadeusz and Jerzy were given the titles of Righteous among the Nations for their heroic stance against the Nazi German Holocaust.

Most people have few or non-specific symptoms in the first 24 hours following overdose. These include feeling tired, abdominal pain, or nausea. This is typically followed by a couple of days without any symptoms, after which yellowish skin, blood clotting problems, and confusion occurs as a result of liver failure. Additional complications may include kidney failure, pancreatitis, low blood sugar, and lactic acidosis. If death does not occur, people tend to recover fully over a couple of weeks. Without treatment some cases will resolve while others will result in death. Paracetamol poisoning can occur accidentally or as an attempt to end one's life. Risk factors for toxicity include alcoholism, malnutrition, and the taking of certain other medications. Liver damage results not from paracetamol itself, but from one of its metabolites, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). NAPQI decreases the liver's glutathione and directly damages cells in the liver. Diagnosis is based on the blood level of paracetamol at specific times after the medication was taken. These values are often plotted on the Rumack-Matthew nomogram to determine level of concern. Treatment may include activated charcoal if the person seeks medical help soon after the overdose. Attempting to force the person to vomit is not recommended. If there is a potential for toxicity, the antidote acetylcysteine is recommended. The medication is generally given for at least 24 hours. Psychiatric care may be required following recovery. A liver transplant may be required if damage to the liver becomes severe. The need for transplant is often based on low blood pH, high blood lactate, poor blood clotting, or significant hepatic encephalopathy. With early treatment liver failure is rare. Death occurs in about 0.1% of cases. Paracetamol poisoning was first described in the 1960s. Rates of poisoning vary significantly between regions of the world. In the United States more than 100,000 cases occur a year. In the United Kingdom it is the medication responsible for the greatest number of overdoses. Young children are most commonly affected. In the United States and the United Kingdom, paracetamol is the most common cause of acute liver failure. Signs and symptoms The signs and symptoms of paracetamol toxicity occur in three phases. The first phase begins within hours of overdose, and consists of nausea, vomiting, a pale appearance, and sweating. However, patients often have no specific symptoms or only mild symptoms in the first 24 hours of poisoning. Rarely, after massive overdoses, patients may develop symptoms of metabolic acidosis and coma early in the course of poisoning. The second phase occurs between 24 h and 72 h following overdose and consists of signs of increasing liver damage. In general, damage occurs in liver cells as they metabolize the paracetamol. The individual may experience right upper quadrant abdominal pain. The increasing liver damage also changes biochemical markers of liver function; International normalized ratio (INR) and the liver transaminases ALT and AST rise to abnormal levels. Acute kidney failure may also occur during this phase, typically caused by either hepatorenal syndrome or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. In some cases, acute kidney failure may be the primary clinical manifestation of toxicity. In these cases, it has been suggested that the toxic metabolite is produced more in the kidneys than in the liver. The third phase follows at 3 to 5 days, and is marked by complications of massive liver necrosis leading to fulminant liver failure with complications of coagulation defects, low blood sugar, kidney failure, hepatic encephalopathy, brain swelling, sepsis, multiple organ failure, and death. If the third phase is survived, the liver necrosis runs its course, and liver and kidney function typically return to normal in a few weeks. The severity of paracetamol toxicity varies depending on the dose and whether appropriate treatment is received. Cause The toxic dose of paracetamol is highly variable. In general the recommended maximum daily dose for healthy adults is 4 grams. Higher doses lead to increasing risk of toxicity. In adults, single doses above 10 grams or 200 mg/kg of bodyweight, whichever is lower, have a reasonable likelihood of causing toxicity. Toxicity can also occur when multiple smaller doses within 24 hours exceed these levels. Following a dose of 1 gram of paracetamol four times a day for two weeks, patients can expect an increase in alanine transaminase in their liver to typically about three times the normal value. It is unlikely that this dose would lead to liver failure. Studies have shown significant hepatotoxicity is uncommon in patients who have taken greater than normal doses over 3 to 4 days. In adults, a dose of 6 grams a day over the preceding 48 hours could potentially lead to toxicity, while in children acute doses above 200 mg/kg could potentially cause toxicity. Acute paracetamol overdose in children rarely causes illness or death, and it is very uncommon for children to have levels that require treatment, with chronic larger-than-normal doses being the major cause of toxicity in children. Intentional overdosing (self-poisoning, with suicidal intent) is frequently implicated in paracetamol toxicity. In a 2006 review, paracetamol was the most frequently ingested compound in intentional overdosing. In rare individuals, paracetamol toxicity can result from normal use. This may be due to individual (\\"idiosyncratic\\") differences in the expression and activity of certain enzymes in one of the metabolic pathways that handle paracetamol (see paracetamol's metabolism). =Risk factors= A number of factors can potentially increase the risk of developing paracetamol toxicity. Chronic excessive alcohol consumption can induce CYP2E1, thus increasing the potential toxicity of paracetamol. In one study of patients with liver injury, 64% reported alcohol intakes of greater than 80 grams a day, while 35% took 60 grams a day or less. Whether chronic alcoholism should be considered a risk factor has been debated by some clinical toxicologists. For chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol ingestion at the time of a paracetamol overdose may have a protective effect. For non-chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol consumption had no protective effect. Fasting is a risk factor, possibly because of depletion of liver glutathione reserves. The concomitant use of the CYP2E1 inducer isoniazid increases the risk of hepatotoxicity, though whether 2E1 induction is related to the hepatotoxicity in this case is unclear. Concomitant use of other drugs that induce CYP enzymes, such as antiepileptics including carbamazepine, phenytoin, and barbiturates, have also been reported as risk factors. Pathophysiology Main pathways of paracetamol metabolism (click to enlarge). The pathway leading to NAPQI is shown in red. When taken in normal therapeutic doses, paracetamol has been shown to be safe. Following a therapeutic dose, it is mostly converted to nontoxic metabolites via Phase II metabolism by conjugation with sulfate and glucuronide, with a small portion being oxidized via the cytochrome P450 enzyme system.Metabolism of acetaminophen (paracetamol), acetanilide and phenacetin Cytochromes and 3A4 convert approximately 5% of paracetamol to a highly reactive intermediary metabolite, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). Under normal conditions, NAPQI is detoxified by conjugation with glutathione to form cysteine and mercapturic acid conjugates. In cases of paracetamol overdose, the sulfate and glucuronide pathways become saturated, and more paracetamol is shunted to the cytochrome P450 system to produce NAPQI. As a result, hepatocellular supplies of glutathione become depleted, as the demand for glutathione is higher than its regeneration. NAPQI therefore remains in its toxic form in the liver and reacts with cellular membrane molecules, resulting in widespread hepatocyte damage and death, leading to acute liver necrosis. In animal studies, the liver's stores of glutathione must be depleted to less than 70% of normal levels before liver toxicity occurs. Diagnosis Rumack Matthew Nomogram with treatment line added at 150 A person's history of taking paracetamol is somewhat accurate for the diagnosis. The most effective way to diagnose poisoning is by obtaining a blood paracetamol level. A drug nomogram developed in 1975, called the Rumack-Matthew nomogram, estimates the risk of toxicity based on the serum concentration of paracetamol at a given number of hours after ingestion. To determine the risk of potential hepatotoxicity, the paracetamol level is traced along the nomogram. Use of a timed serum paracetamol level plotted on the nomogram appears to be the best marker indicating the potential for liver injury. A paracetamol level drawn in the first four hours after ingestion may underestimate the amount in the system because paracetamol may still be in the process of being absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, a serum level taken before 4 hours is not recommended. Clinical or biochemical evidence of liver toxicity may develop in one to four days, although, in severe cases, it may be evident in 12 hours. Right-upper-quadrant tenderness may be present and can aid in diagnosis. Laboratory studies may show evidence of liver necrosis with elevated AST, ALT, bilirubin, and prolonged coagulation times, particularly an elevated prothrombin time. After paracetamol overdose, when AST and ALT exceed 1000 IU/L, paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity can be diagnosed. In some cases, the AST and ALT levels can exceed 10,000 IU/L. =Detection in body fluids= Paracetamol may be quantified in blood, plasma, or urine as a diagnostic tool in clinical poisoning situations or to aid in the medicolegal investigation of suspicious deaths. The concentration in serum after a typical dose of paracetamol usually peaks below 30 mg/l, which equals 200 ¬µmol/L. Levels of 30‚Äì300 mg/L (200‚Äì2000 ¬µmol/L) are often observed in overdose patients. Postmortem blood levels have ranged from 50‚Äì400 mg/L in persons dying due to acute overdosage. Automated colorimetric techniques, gas chromatography and liquid chromatography are currently in use for the laboratory analysis of the drug in physiological specimens.R. Baselt, Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man, 9th edition, Biomedical Publications, Seal Beach, CA, 2011, pp. 9‚Äì12. Prevention =Limitation of availability= Limiting the availability of paracetamol tablets has been attempted in some countries. In the UK, sales of over-the-counter paracetamol are restricted to packs of 32 x 500 mg tablets in pharmacies, and 16 x 500 mg tablets in non-pharmacy outlets. Pharmacists may provide up to 100 tablets for those with chronic conditions at the pharmacist's discretion. In Ireland, the limits are 24 and 12 tablets, respectively. Subsequent study suggests that the reduced availability in large numbers had a significant effect in reducing poisoning deaths from paracetamol overdose. One suggested method of prevention is to make paracetamol a prescription-only medicine, or to remove it entirely from the market. However, overdose is a relatively minor problem; for example, 0.08% of the UK population (over 50 thousand people) present with paracetamol overdose each year. In contrast, paracetamol is a safe and effective medication that is taken without complications by millions of people. In addition, alternative pain relief medications such as aspirin are more toxic in overdose, whereas non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are associated with more adverse effects following normal use. =Combination with other agents= One strategy for reducing harm done by acetaminophen overdoses is selling paracetamol pre- combined in tablets either with an emetic or an antidote. Paradote was a tablet sold in the UK which combined 500 mg paracetamol with 100 mg methionine, an amino acid formerly used in the treatment of paracetamol overdose. There have been no studies so far on the effectiveness of paracetamol when given in combination with its most commonly used antidote, acetylcysteine. Calcitriol, the active metabolite of vitamin D3, appears to be a catalyst for glutathione production. Calcitriol was found to increase glutathione levels in rat astrocyte primary cultures on average by 42%, increasing glutathione protein concentrations from 29 nmol/mg to 41 nmol/mg, 24 and 48 hours after administration; it continued to have an influence on glutathione levels 96 hours after administration., It has been proposed that co-administration of calcitriol, via injection, may improve treatment outcomes. =Paracetamol replacements= Paracetamol ester prodrug with L-pyroglutamic acid (PCA), a biosynthetic precursor of glutathione, has been synthesized to reduce paracetamol hepatotoxicity and improve bioavailability. The toxicological studies of different paracetamol esters show that L-5-oxo- pyrrolidine-2-paracetamol carboxylate reduces toxicity after administration of an overdose of paracetamol to mice. The liver glutathione values in mice induced by intraperitoneal injection of the ester are superimposable with the GSH levels recorded in untreated mice control group. The mice group treated with an equivalent dose of paracetamol showed a significative decrease of glutathione of 35% (p<0.01 vs untreated control group). The oral LD50 was found to be greater than 2000 mg kg-1, whereas the intraperitoneal LD50 was 1900 mg kg-1. These results taken together with the good hydrolysis and bioavailability data show that this ester is a potential candidate as a prodrug of paracetamol. Treatment =Gastric decontamination= In adults, the initial treatment for paracetamol overdose is gastrointestinal decontamination. Paracetamol absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is complete within two hours under normal circumstances, so decontamination is most helpful if performed within this timeframe. Gastric lavage, better known as stomach pumping, may be considered if the amount ingested is potentially life-threatening and the procedure can be performed within 60 minutes of ingestion. Activated charcoal is the most common gastrointestinal decontamination procedure as it adsorbs paracetamol, reducing its gastrointestinal absorption. Administering activated charcoal also poses less risk of aspiration than gastric lavage. It appears that the most benefit from activated charcoal is gained if it is given within 30 minutes to two hours of ingestion. Administering activated charcoal later than 2 hours can be considered in patients that may have delayed gastric emptying due to co- ingested drugs or following ingestion of sustained- or delayed-release paracetamol preparations. Activated charcoal should also be administered if co-ingested drugs warrant decontamination. There was reluctance to give activated charcoal in paracetamol overdose, because of the concern that it may also absorb the oral antidote acetylcysteine. Studies have shown that 39% less acetylcysteine is absorbed into the body when they are administered together. There are conflicting recommendations regarding whether to change the dosing of oral acetylcysteine after the administration of activated charcoal, and even whether the dosing of acetylcysteine needs to be altered at all. Intravenous acetylcystine has no interaction with activated charcoal. Inducing vomiting with syrup of ipecac has no role in paracetamol overdose because the vomiting it induces delays the effective administration of activated charcoal and oral acetylcysteine. Liver injury is extremely rare after acute accidental ingestion in children under 6 years of age. Children with accidental exposures do not require gastrointestinal decontamination with either gastric lavage, activated charcoal, or syrup of ipecac. =Acetylcysteine= Acetylcysteine is the antidote for paracetamol toxicity Acetylcysteine, also called N-acetylcysteine or NAC, works to reduce paracetamol toxicity by replenishing body stores of the antioxidant glutathione. Glutathione reacts with the toxic NAPQI metabolite so that it does not damage cells and can be safely excreted. NAC was usually given following a treatment nomogram (one for patients with risk factors, and one for those without) but the use of the nomogram is no longer recommended as the evidence base to support the use of risk factors was poor and inconsistent and many of the risk factors are imprecise and difficult to determine with sufficient certainty in clinical practice. Cysteamine and methionine have also been used to prevent hepatotoxicity, although studies show that both are associated with more adverse effects than acetylcysteine. Additionally, acetylcysteine has been shown to be a more effective antidote, particularly in patients presenting greater than 8 hours post-ingestion and for those who present with liver failure symptoms. If the person presents less than eight hours after paracetamol overdose, then acetylcysteine significantly reduces the risk of serious hepatotoxicity and guarantees survival. If acetylcysteine is started more than 8 hours after ingestion, there is a sharp decline in its effectiveness because the cascade of toxic events in the liver has already begun, and the risk of acute liver necrosis and death increases dramatically. Although acetylcysteine is most effective if given early, it still has beneficial effects if given as late as 48 hours after ingestion. If the person presents more than eight hours after the paracetamol overdose, then activated charcoal is not useful, and acetylcysteine is started immediately. In earlier presentations, charcoal can be given when the patient arrives and acetylcysteine is initiated while waiting for the paracetamol level results to return from the laboratory. In United States practice, intravenous (IV) and oral administration are considered to be equally effective and safe if given within 8 hours of ingestion. However, IV is the only recommended route in Australasian and British practice. Oral acetylcysteine is given as a 140 mg/kg loading dose followed by 70 mg/kg every four hours for 17 more doses, and if the patient vomits within 1 hour of dose, the dose must be repeated. Oral acetylcysteine may be poorly tolerated due to its unpleasant taste, odor, and its tendency to cause nausea and vomiting. If repeated doses of charcoal are indicated because of another ingested drug, then subsequent doses of charcoal and acetylcysteine should be staggered. Intravenous acetylcysteine is given as a continuous infusion over 20 hours for a total dose 300 mg/kg. Recommended administration involves infusion of a 150 mg/kg loading dose over 15 to 60 minutes, followed by a 50 mg/kg infusion over four hours; the last 100 mg/kg are infused over the remaining 16 hours of the protocol. Intravenous acetylcysteine has the advantage of shortening hospital stay, increasing both doctor and patient convenience, and allowing administration of activated charcoal to reduce absorption of both the paracetamol and any co-ingested drugs without concerns about interference with oral acetylcysteine. Intravenous dosing varies with weight, specifically in children. For patients less than 20 kg, the loading dose is 150 mg/kg in 3 mL/kg diluent, administered over 60 minutes; the second dose is 50 mg/kg in 7 mL/kg diluent over 4 hours; and the third and final dose is 100 mg/kg in 14 mL/kg diluent over 16 hours. The most common adverse effect to acetylcysteine treatment is an anaphylactoid reaction, usually manifested by rash, wheeze, or mild hypotension. Adverse reactions are more common in people treated with IV acetylcysteine, occurring in up to 20% of patients. Anaphylactoid reactions are more likely to occur with the first infusion (the loading dose). Rarely, severe life-threatening reactions may occur in predisposed individuals, such as patients with asthma or atopic dermatitis, and may be characterized by respiratory distress, facial swelling, and even death. If an anaphylactoid reaction occurs the acetylcysteine is temporarily halted or slowed and antihistamines and other supportive care is administered. For example, a nebulised beta-agonist like salbutamol may be indicated in the event of significant bronchospasm (or prophylactically in patients with a history of bronchospasm secondary to acetylcysteine). It is also important to closely monitor fluids and electrolytes. =Liver transplant= In people who develop acute liver failure or who are otherwise expected to die from liver failure, the mainstay of management is liver transplantation. Liver transplants are performed in specialist centers. The most commonly used criteria for liver transplant were developed by physicians at King's College Hospital in London. Patients are recommended for transplant if they have an arterial blood pH less than 7.3 after fluid resuscitation or if a patient has Grade III or IV encephalopathy, a prothrombin time greater than 100 seconds, and a serum creatinine greater than 300 mmol/L In a 24-hour period. Other forms of liver support have been used including partial liver transplants. These techniques have the advantage of supporting the patient while their own liver regenerates. Once liver function returns immunosuppressive drugs are commenced and they have to take immunosuppressive medication for the rest of their lives. Prognosis The mortality rate from paracetamol overdose increases two days after the ingestion, reaches a maximum on day four, and then gradually decreases. Acidosis is the most important single indicator of probable mortality and the need for transplantation. A mortality rate of 95% without transplant was reported in patients who had a documented pH less than 7.30. Other indicators of poor prognosis include chronic kidney disease (stage 3 or worse), hepatic encephalopathy, a markedly elevated prothrombin time, or an elevated blood lactic acid level (lactic acidosis). One study has shown that a factor V level less than 10% of normal indicated a poor prognosis (91% mortality), whereas a ratio of factor VIII to factor V of less than 30 indicated a good prognosis (100% survival). Patients with a poor prognosis are usually identified for likely liver transplantation. Patients that do not die are expected to fully recover and have a normal life expectancy and quality of life. Epidemiology Many over-the-counter and prescription-only medications contain paracetamol. Because of its wide availability paired with comparably high toxicity, (compared to ibuprofen and aspirin) there is a much higher potential for overdose. Paracetamol toxicity is one of the most common causes of poisoning worldwide. In the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand, paracetamol is the most common cause of drug overdoses. Additionally, in both the United States and the United Kingdom it is the most common cause of acute liver failure. In England and Wales an estimated 41,200 cases of paracetamol poisoning occurred in 1989 to 1990, with a mortality of 0.40%. It is estimated that 150 to 200 deaths and 15 to 20 liver transplants occur as a result of poisoning each year in England and Wales. Paracetamol overdose results in more calls to poison control centers in the US than overdose of any other pharmacological substance, accounting for more than 100,000 calls, as well as 56,000 emergency room visits, 2,600 hospitalizations, and 458 deaths due to acute liver failure per year. A study of cases of acute liver failure between November 2000 and October 2004 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the USA found that paracetamol was the cause of 41% of all cases in adults, and 25% of cases in children.

Cadmium telluride PV is the only thin film technology with lower costs than conventional solar cells made of crystalline silicon in multi-kilowatt systems.K. Zweibel, J. Mason, V. Fthenakis, \\"A Solar Grand Plan\\", Scientific American, Jan 2008. CdTe PV is the cheapest example of PV technologies and prices are about 16¬¢/kWh with US Southwest sunlight.Further mention of cost competitiveness: \\"Solar Power Lightens Up with Thin-Film Technology\\", Scientific American, April 2008. On a lifecycle basis, CdTe PV has the smallest carbon footprint, lowest water use and shortest energy payback time of any current photo voltaic technology. CdTe's energy payback time of less than a year allows for faster carbon reductions without short-term energy deficits. The toxicity of cadmium is an environmental concern mitigated by the recycling of CdTe modules at the end of their life time. Though there are still uncertainties regarding the recycling of CdTe modules and the public opinion is skeptical towards this technology. The usage of rare materials may also become a limiting factor to the industrial scalability of CdTe technology in the mid-term future. The abundance of tellurium‚Äîof which telluride is the anionic form‚Äîis comparable to that of platinum in the earth's crust and contributes significantly to the module's cost. CdTe photovoltaics are used in some of the world's largest photovoltaic power stations, such as the Topaz Solar Farm. With a share of 5.1% of worldwide PV production, CdTe technology accounted for more than half of the thin film market in 2013.Fraunhofer ISE Photovoltaics Report, July 28, 2014, pages 18,19 A prominent manufacturer of CdTe thin film technology is the company First Solar, based in Tempe, Arizona.  Background  Cross-section of a CdTe thin film solar cell. The dominant PV technology has always been based on crystalline silicon wafers. Thin films and concentrators were early attempts to lower costs. Thin films are based on using thinner semiconductor layers to absorb and convert sunlight. Concentrators lower the number of panels by using lenses or mirrors to put more sunlight on each panel. The first thin film technology to be extensively developed was amorphous silicon. However, this technology suffers from low efficiencies and slow deposition rates (leading to high capital costs). Instead, the PV market reached some 4 gigawatts in 2007 with crystalline silicon comprising almost 90% of sales.Various estimates of world module production in 2007 The same source estimated that about 3 gigawatts were installed in 2007. During this period cadmium telluride and copper indium diselenide or CIS-alloys remained under development. The latter is beginning to be produced in volumes of 1‚Äì30 megawatts per year due to very high small-area cell efficiencies approaching 20% in the laboratory. CdTe cell efficiency is approaching 20% in the laboratory with a record of 22.1% as of 2016.  History  Research in CdTe dates back to the 1950s,R. Colman, July 28, 1964 because its band gap (~1.5 eV) is almost a perfect match to the distribution of photons in the solar spectrum in terms of conversion to electricity. A simple heterojunction design evolved in which p-type CdTe was matched with n-type cadmium sulfide (CdS). The cell was completed by adding top and bottom contacts. Early leaders in CdS/CdTe cell efficiencies were GE in the 1960s, and then Kodak, Monosolar, Matsushita, and AMETEK. By 1981, Kodak used close-space sublimation (CSS) and made the first 10% cells and first multi-cell devices (12 cells, 8% efficiency, 30 cm2).Y. S. Tyan, 1978, Polycrystalline thin film CdS/CdTe photovoltaic cell, Kodak, (EP0006025); Y. S. Tyan and E. A. Perez-Albuerne, 1982, Integrated array of photovoltaic cells having minimized shorting losses, Kodak, . Tyan especially published both patents and papers of significance at Kodak and helped to establish CdTe as an important thin film option. MonosolarB. Basol, E. Tseng, R.L. Rod, 1981, Thin film heterojunction photovoltaic cells and methods of making the same, Monosolar . B. Basol patented numerous aspects of electrodeposition and CdTe contacting for Monosolar. Monosolar was subsequently bought by SOHIO, which was then absorbed by British Petroleum. Electrodeposition continued at BP Solar until about 2002 when it was canceled along with all thin film work at BP. and AMETEKPeter Meyers, originally of Ametek, provides a thread stretching from Ametek through Solar Cells Inc. to First Solar. He is on Ametek patents , 1981; , 1987; and SCI/First Solar patents used electrodeposition, a popular early method. Matsushita started with screen printing but shifted in the 1990s to CSS. Cells of about 10% sunlight-to-electricity efficiency were produced by the early 1980s at Kodak, Matsushita, Monosolar and AMETEK. An important step forward occurred when cells were scaled-up in size to make larger area products called modules. These products required higher currents than small cells and it was found that an additional layer, called a transparent conducting oxide (TCO), could facilitate the movement of current across the top of the cell (instead of a metal grid). One such TCO, tin oxide, was available for other uses (thermally reflective windows). Made more conductive for PV, tin oxide became and remains the norm in CdTe PV modules. The utility-scale Waldpolenz Solar Park in Germany uses CdTe PV modules CdTe cells achieved above 15% in 1992 by adding a buffer layer to the TCO/CdS/CdTe stack and then thinned the CdS to admit more light. Chu used resistive tin oxide as the buffer layer and then thinned the CdS from several micrometres to under half a micrometre in thickness. Thick CdS, as it was used in prior devices, blocked about 5 mA/cm2 of light, or about 20% of the light usable by a CdTe device. The additional layer did not compromise the device's other properties. In the early 1990s, other players experienced mixed results. Golden Photon held the record for a short period for the best CdTe module measured at NREL at 7.7% using a spray deposition technique. Matsushita claimed an 11% module efficiency using CSS and then dropped the technology. A similar efficiency and fate eventually occurred at BP Solar. BP used electrodeposition (inherited from Monosolar by a circuitous route when it purchased SOHIO, Monosolar's acquirer). BP Solar dropped CdTe in November 2002. Antec was able to make about 7%-efficient modules, but went bankrupt when it started producing commercially during a short, sharp market downturn in 2002. However, as of 2014 Antec still made CdTe PV modules. CdTe start-ups include Calyxo (formerly owned by Q-Cells), PrimeStar Solar, in Arvada, Colorado (acquired by First Solar from GE), Arendi (Italy). Including Antec, their total production represents less than 70 megawatts per year. Empa, the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Testing and Research, focuses on the development of CdTe solar cells on flexible substrates and demonstrated cell efficiencies of 13.5% and 15.6% for flexible plastic foil and glass substrates, respectively. = SCI and First Solar = The major commercial success was by Solar Cells Incorporated (SCI). Its founder, Harold McMaster, envisioned low-cost thin films made on a large scale. After trying amorphous silicon, he shifted to CdTe at the urging of Jim Nolan and founded Solar Cells Inc., which later became First Solar.After long wait, McMaster to join hall of fame, April 29, 2008 McMaster championed CdTe for its high-rate, high-throughput processing. SCI shifted from an adaptation of the CSS method then shifted to vapor transport.SCI CSS patent: Foote et al. Process for making photovoltaic devices and resultant product, United States Patent 5248349; and their vapor transport patent, featuring the movement of vaporized cadmium and tellurium atoms through a closed, silicon carbide distributor: Apparatus and method for depositing a semiconductor material, United States Patent 6037241. Both are now owned by First Solar. In February 1999, McMaster sold the company to True North Partners, who named it First Solar. In its early years First Solar suffered setbacks, and initial module efficiencies were modest, about 7%. Commercial product became available in 2002. Production reached 25 megawatts in 2005. The company manufactured in Perrysburg, Ohio and Germany. In 2013, First Solar acquired GE's thin film solar panel technology in exchange for a 1.8% stake in the company.First Solar Gives GE 1.8% Stake in Thin-Film Partnership. bloomberg.com. 2013-08-07 Today, First Solar manufactures over 3 gigawatts with an average module efficiency of 16.4% in 2016.  Technology  = Cell efficiency = efficiencies In August 2014 First Solar announced a device with 21.1% conversion efficiency. In February 2016, First Solar announced that they had reached a record 22.1% conversion efficiency in their CdTe cells. In 2014, the record module efficiency was also raised by First Solar from 16.1% up to 17.0%. At this time, the company projected average production line module efficiency for its CdTe PV to be 17% by 2017, but by 2016, they predicted a module efficiency closer to ~19.5%. Since CdTe has the optimal band gap for single-junction devices, efficiencies close to 20% (such as already shown in CIS alloys) may be achievable in practical CdTe cells. = Process optimization = Process optimization improved throughput and lowered costs. Improvements included broader substrates (since capital costs scale sublinearly and installation costs can be reduced), thinner layers (to save material, electricity, and processing time), and better material utilization (to save material and cleaning costs). 2014 CdTe module costs were about $72 per ,This number is calculated by multiplying efficiency (12.6%) by 1000 to get output watts per square meter (126 W/m2), and then multiplying power by the stated cost of $0.57 per watt to get $72/m2 or about $90 per module. = Ambient temperature = Module efficiencies are measured in laboratories at standard testing temperatures of 25 ¬∞C, however in the field modules are often exposed to much higher temperatures. CdTe‚Äôs relatively low temperature coefficient protects performance at higher temperatures. CdTe PV modules experience half the reduction of crystalline silicon modules, resulting in an increased annual energy output of 5-9%. = Solar tracking = Almost all thin film photovoltaic module systems to-date have been non-solar tracking, because module output was too low to offset tracker capital and operating costs. But relatively inexpensive single-axis tracking systems can add 25% output per installed watt. Like any solar price model, the Solar Advisory Model is quite sensitive to assumptions. Different sunlight, tax rates, interest rates, discount rates, loan durations, temperature coefficients, annual degradation rates, initial de-rating versus standard conditions, inverter efficiencies and O&M;, and others can each have as much as a 10% impact on costs per unit power. In addition, depending on the Tracker Energy Gain, the overall eco- efficiency of the PV system can be enhanced by lowering both system costs and environmental impacts. This is climate-dependent. Tracking also produces a smoother output plateau around midday, better matching afternoon peaks. Materials = Cadmium = Cadmium (Cd), a toxic heavy metal considered a hazardous substance, is a waste byproduct of mining, smelting and refining sulfidic ores of zinc during zinc refining, and therefore its production does not depend on PV market demand. CdTe PV modules provide a beneficial and safe use for cadmium that would otherwise be stored for future use or disposed of in landfills as hazardous waste. Mining byproducts can be converted into a stable CdTe compound and safely encapsulated inside CdTe PV solar modules for years. A large growth in the CdTe PV sector has the potential to reduce global cadmium emissions by displacing coal and oil power generation. = Tellurium = Tellurium (Te) production and reserves estimates are subject to uncertainty and vary considerably. Tellurium is a rare, mildly toxic metalloid that is primarily used as a machining additive to steel. Te is almost exclusively obtained as a by-product of copper refining, with smaller amounts from lead and gold production. Only a small amount, estimated to be about 800 metric tons per year, is available. According to USGS, global production in 2007 was 135 metric tons. One gigawatt (GW) of CdTe PV modules would require about 93 metric tons (at current efficiencies and thicknesses). Through improved material efficiency and increased PV recycling, the CdTe PV industry has the potential to fully rely on tellurium from recycled end-of-life modules by 2038. In the last decade, new supplies have been located, e.g., in Xinju, ChinaPublications of the Sichuan Xinju Mineral Resource Development Co., China as well as in Mexico and Sweden. In 1984 astrophysicists identified tellurium as the universe's most abundant element having an atomic number over 40. Certain undersea ridges are rich in tellurium. = Cadmium chloride/magnesium chloride = The manufacture of a CdTe cell includes a thin coating with cadmium chloride () to increase the cell's overall efficiency. Cadmium chloride is toxic, relatively expensive and highly soluble in water, posing a potential environmental threat during manufacture. In 2014 research discovered that abundant and harmless magnesium chloride () performs as well as cadmium chloride. This research may lead to cheaper and safer CdTe cells.Karen Field. \\"Bean Curd Component Could Slash Solar Panel Costs\\". EE Times. 2014. = Safety = By themselves, cadmium and tellurium are toxic and carcinogenic, but CdTe forms a crystalline lattice that is highly stable, and is several orders of magnitude less toxic than cadmium. The glass plates surrounding CdTe material sandwiched between them (as in all commercial modules) seal during a fire and do not allow any cadmium release unless the glass is broken. All other uses and exposures related to cadmium are minor and similar in kind and magnitude to exposures from other materials in the broader PV value chain, e.g., to toxic gases, lead solder, or solvents (most of which are not used in CdTe manufacturing). =Grain boundaries= The grain boundary is the interface between two grains of a crystalline material and occur when two grains meet. They are a type of crystalline defect. It is often assumed that the open-circuit voltage gap seen in CdTe, in comparison to both single- crystal GaAs and the theoretical limit, may be in some way attributable to the grain boundaries within the material. There have however been a number of studies which have suggested not only that GBs are not deleterious to performance but may in fact be beneficial as sources of enhanced carrier collection. So, the exact role of the grain boundaries in limitation of performance of CdTe-based solar cells remains unclear and the research is ongoing to address this question.  Recycling  Photovoltaic modules can last anywhere from 25 ‚Äì 30 years. Improper disposal of PV modules can release toxic materials into the environment. Only three methods of high-value recycling are industrially available for thin-film PV modules, as of 2013. SENSE (Sustainability EvaluatioN of Solar Energy systems) and RESOLVED (REcovery of SOLar Valuable materials, Enrichment, and Decontamination) are European funded procedures. SENSE relies on mechanical, chemical and thermal treatments. RESOLVED relies on mainly mechanical treatments. The final method, First Solar, relies on mechanical and chemical processes. Mechanical methods of recycling are more environmentally friendly as they do not rely on the use of chemicals. Materials that can be recovered in the recycling process include metals, mounts, glass, and, in high value cases, the whole PV module. As of 2013 the recycling costs for CdTe modules are higher than the re-sale of recycled materials. However, possible future recycling methods may decrease in cost through reduction of expensive and environmentally unfriendly processes. Promising future recycling methods include vulcanization-vacuum distillation and the Double Green Process. Vulcanization-vacuum distillation has been suggested as a possible recycling process to obtain Te and can recover Te with purities up to 99.92%. The Double Green Process consists of almost entirely mechanical processes. Due to the exponential growth of photovoltaics the number of worldwide installed PV systems has increased significantly. First Solar established the first global and comprehensive recycling program in the PV industry in 2005. Its recycling facilities operate at each of First Solar‚Äôs manufacturing plants and recover up to 95% of semiconductor material for reuse in new modules and 90% of glass for reuse in new glass products.ftp://ftp.co.imperial.ca.us/icpds/eir/campo-verde-solar/final/life- cycle-cdte.pdf A life cycle assessment of CdTe module recycling by the University of Stuttgart showed a reduction in primary energy demand in End-Of- Life from 81 MJ/m2 to -12 MJ/m2, a reduction of around 93 MJ/m2, and in terms of global warming potential from 6 kg CO2-equiv./m2 to -2.5 CO2-equiv./m2, a reduction of around -8.5 CO2-equiv./m2. These reductions show a highly beneficial change in the overall environmental profile of CdTe photovoltaic module. The LCA also showed that the main contributors to considered environmental impact categories are due to required chemicals and energy within the processing of CdTe modules.  Environmental impact  a small PV array used as part of Energy Systems Integration research ongoing at the National Wind Technology Center (NWTC) Photovoltaics can assist in reducing toxic emissions and pollution caused by fossil fuels. Emissions from fossil fuels that impact global climates such as Nitrogen Oxide (NOx), Carbon Dioxide (CO2) and Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) are not emitted from PV. A single gigawatt-hour of electricity produced from PV would decrease the emissions of SO2 by 10 tons, NOx by 4 tons and CO2 by 1000 tons when compared to coal. CdTe cells are considered to be both toxic and carcinogenic when inhaled or ingested as Cd is a toxic compound by the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Workers in processing facilities may be exposed to, and inhale, fine particles or fumes of Cd. CdTe production facilities may cause environmental issues when there are accidents in high-efficiency production or from by-product exhaust in less efficient production methods. During a module‚Äôs lifespan, it will not release any particles or vapors if used as intended. The only way for a completed module to release dust or vapor is by being lit aflame or ground into a fine dust. When exposed to temperatures of approximately 1100 ¬∞C in lab tests around 0.4% to 0.6% of the Cd content was released. The overall Cd air emission estimates can range from 0.02 to 0.5 grams per gigawatt-hour. Early CdTe modules failed elution tests, however more recent models can pass some elution tests. Despite the small amounts of Cd that may leach out, CdTe modules have low overall leachability as the hazardous materials within them are encased within two layers of glass. Despite their low leachability, CdTe modules have very poor biodegradability.  Market viability  The Topaz Solar Farm employs 9 million CdTe-modules. It was the world's largest PV power station in 2014. Success of cadmium telluride PV has been due to the low cost achievable with the CdTe technology, made possible by combining adequate efficiency with lower module area costs. Direct manufacturing cost for CdTe PV modules reached $0.57 per watt in 2013, and capital cost per new watt of capacity is near $0.9 per watt (including land and buildings).Pacific Crest Presentation, August 3‚Äì5, 2008 = Notable systems = Utility-scale CdTe PV solutions were claimed to be able to compete with peaking fossil fuel generation sources depending on irradiance levels, interest rates and other factors such as development costs.

History  The Country Houses Association Ltd was an Industrial and Provident Society formed in 1955 by Rear Admiral Greathed, originally called the Mutual Households Association (MHA). Its stated aim was to preserve historic buildings for the benefit of the nation. During its lifetime, the Association acquired nine large country houses, and restored and preserved these until their sale in 2002-4. During their ownership by the Association, all the houses were converted into retirement apartments, with communal dining and drawing rooms, with the rental income helping to pay for the house's extensive renovations and repairs (residents also paid deposits of up to ¬£140,000). The houses were open to members of the Association and also members of the public. Sir John Adye was the chair of the CHA from 1996 until 2002. The Association finally went into liquidation in December 2003 with the liquidators being Deloitte & Touche.BBC News article \\"Residents are saved from eviction\\" on 19 April 2004 The Association stated it went into liquidation because of falling demand for its apartments, the increasing age-profile of residents and the increased regulation surrounding the business. The trustees were told they could not use charity funds to support loss-making businesses with no future prospects. At the time of its liquidation in 2003 the CHA owned 8 houses:BBC News article \\"Historic houses to close\\" on 15 December 2003The Telegraph, \\"Eight historic houses for sale in charity cash crisis\\", by John Eifion Jones and Pippa Dunlop, 15 December 2003 * Albury Park, Albury, Surrey ‚Äì purchased in 1969, sold in 2004 for ¬£4.5m to Jennifer & Nigel Whalley (slowly being converted and sold as apartments when residents leave). * Aynhoe Park, Aynhoe, Northamptonshire ‚Äì purchased in 1959 (CHA's 2nd house), sold in 2004 to James Perkins (previously restored Dowdeswell Court in Gloucestershire) and now a single private home. * Danny House, Hassocks, West Sussex ‚Äì purchased in 1956 (CHA's 1st house), sold in 2004 for ¬£3m to Rachael & Richard Burrows, who maintained it as serviced apartments for retired people and as a family business. * Flete House, Holbeton, Devon ‚Äì leased/purchased in 1961, sold in April 2004 to Raven Audley Court (Audley Retirement). * Gosfield Hall, Braintree, Essex ‚Äì purchased in December 1959 (CHA's 4th house), sold in early 2004 to investors and then again in December 2004 to Country House Weddings Ltd. * Great Maytham Hall, Rolvenden, Kent ‚Äì purchased in 1965, sold in 2004 to Sunley Heritage, now private apartments. * Pythouse, Tisbury, Wiltshire ‚Äì purchased in about 1959, sold in 2004 for ¬£7m and remains a residential home. * Swallowfield Park, Swallowfield, Berkshire ‚Äì purchased about 1975, sold in 2004 to Sunley Heritage, now private apartments.

In 2008 it was adapted into a nursing home. There was apparently also a 10th house run by the CHA. This may have been Otterden Place, Otterden, Faversham, Kent. About 6 of the 8 houses were sold as \\"going concerns\\", so that most of the 180 residents could remain in their apartments.The Telegraph, \\"Stately homes fetch ¬£20m\\", by Mark Palmer 26 March 2004 Out of the original 9 houses, 7 are still in use as retirement or nursing homes, with Aynhoe Park converted back into a single home in 2004, and Gosfield Hall run as a wedding and events venue.  Country Houses Foundation  Following the sale of all the houses and the restructuring of the CHA in 2004, the Country Houses Foundation (CHF) was set up in 2005, and endowed with the surplus funds from the sale of the properties, which came to approximately ¬£15 million. It is a charitable grant-giving foundation which supports the preservation of historic houses and gardens, with its Chairman currently being Norman Hudson.

It includes two genera, Copionodon and Glaphyropoma. Classification Copionodontines are remarkably primitive in body form, and lack many of the synapomorphies previously used to diagnose the family Trichomycteridae. Little doubt exists that the Copionodontinae form a monophyletic group, diagnosed by several unambiguous synapomorphies, including a unique dentition composed of spatulate teeth not seen anywhere else in the Trichomycteridae. A few characters also support the genera Copionodon and Glaphyropoma as monophyletic subunits. Distribution and ecology Copionodontines occur exclusively in the Chapada Diamantina; though the plateau is drained by four river basins, so far, these fish are exclusively found in drainages associated with the Paragua√ßu River. Copionodontines occupy the upper reaches of fast-flowing streams on rocky beds, often with tiny or no water flow in the dry season. Fish tend to concentrate on quiet, deep pools, though some individuals lodge in narrow rock crevices in fast-flowing sectors. Habitat preferences also vary according to species. Water in the upper reaches of the Chapada Diamantina is cool and usually black (organic matter-stained), but copionodontines are recorded in a few clear-water streams, as well. Usually, they share their environment with few or no other fish species.

Etymology Pompilidotoxin is named after the pompilidae wasp family (commonly called spider wasps). Sources Œ±-Pompilidotoxin (Œ±-PMTX) can be extracted from the venom of a solitary wasp, Anoplius samariensis. Œ≤-Pompilidotoxin (Œ≤-PMTX) originates from the venom of another wasp, Batozonellus maculifrons. Chemistry Structure Œ±-PMTX consists of 13 amino acid residues with the sequence Arg-Ile-Lys-Ile-Gly-Leu- Phe-Gln-Asp-Leu-Ser-Lys-Leu-NH2. Replacement of the lysine residue at position 12 of Œ±-PMTX with arginine results in Œ≤-PMTX. Homology Œ±-PMTX has no structural homology with other toxins. It lacks disulfide bonds which are known to be present in other toxins acting on sodium channels, such as sea anemone toxins or scorpion toxins. Target Both Œ±- and Œ≤-PMTX slow the inactivation of neuronal sodium channels (but not heart sodium channels), possibly by binding to the neurotoxin receptor site 3 on the extracellular surface of the sodium channel. Œ≤-PMTX has higher potency than Œ±-PMTX. Mode of action By slowing down the inactivation of sodium channels, PMTXs can potentiate synaptic transmission in the lobster neuromuscular endplate.

Subject The novel is about Adam Pollo, a loner man who had been marginalized from society. His long hair and his beard make him appear a beggar. Pollo is a former student who suffers from amnesia. He does not know whether he was perhaps a deserter from the army or if he has escaped from a psychiatric ward. Le Cl√©zio wrote: He breaks into an empty seaside villa. He visits the town at rare intervals and as briefly as his scant purchases (of cigarettes, biscuits, or even beer) require. Soon, lack of human contact affects him like a drug and he experiences other modes of being: through a dog's or rat‚Äôs eyes, states of heightened consciousness which build up into a terrifying world of glaring hallucinatory experience. Then Adam addresses a small crowd in the town. His unnerving rhetoric ends in his arrest and commitment to an asylum. And there the interrogation begins.

The main purpose of the Association was to campaign for the concept of Sound money and to persuade the Treasury to contract gradually the issue of Treasury notes so they should once again have an equal value to the gold which they represented. This objective was achieved when Winston Churchill, as Chancellor of the Exchequer, returned Britain to the Gold Standard in 1925. The Association also campaigned for public awareness of the dangers of inflation and the need for monetary stability. Even after the return to the Gold Standard the Association continued as a pressure group for sound money until the decision to transfer the Treasury note issue to the Issue Department of the Bank of England. The first president of the Sound Currency Association was Lord D‚ÄôAbernon who was in office from the formation of the Association until his appointment as British Ambassador to Berlin in 1923. He was succeeded by Lord Beauchamp. Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Association throughout its whole existence was David Marshall Mason, Liberal MP for Coventry from 1910-18 and Edinburgh East from 1931-35. The Association was officially wound up at a special meeting of its executive committee in late December 1928 in a formal debate initiated by Sir Hugh Bell. Churchill was among those congratulating the Association on its work and achievements. SourcesThe Times, 24 December 1928 p.8 * Irving Fisher & Hans R. L.

Bent and Henry B. R. Brown and managed by Reserve Management Company. At its peak it held more than $60 billion in assets. During the financial crisis of 2007-2008 it lost dollar value, or \\"broke the buck,\\" and was liquidated as a result. Failure In 2006 Reserve Primary made the decision to purchase commercial paper, an asset class that Bent had dismissed as recently as 2001. By early 2008 asset-backed and financial-sector commercial paper made up 56% of its portfolio. The September 15, 2008 bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers raised concern about Reserve Primary's holdings of Lehman-issued paper, which then made up 1.2% of its portfolio, as well as its other financial-sector paper. Among money market funds, Reserve Primary was especially vulnerable due to its lack of a parent company that might be able to guarantee its share price. Demands to withdraw money from the fund reached 25% of its assets by the afternoon and more than half on the following day, as clients sought to exit the fund before its Lehman assets impacted the share price. Unable to find a buyer for the assets, the fund declared them worthless and announced a share price of $0.97. After the Reserve Primary announcement other money market funds also began to experience runs, leading the United States Treasury to halt orders and temporarily guarantee fund share prices. At the end of the month, the fund's managers announced that they would liquidate the fund. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Reserve Management and its executives for making false assurances to investors about their ability to maintain the fund's value. A federal court awarded the SEC $750,000 from all parties, a small fraction of the requested damages. The court concluded that the misconduct had been an isolated incident in extraordinary circumstances and was not likely to be repeated. A separate investor class action lawsuit was settled for $54 million. The fund dissolved in December 2015, having paid investors $0.991 per share.

Union forces of the Army of the Potomac attacked the rear guard of the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia during its retreat from Pennsylvania following the Battle of Gettysburg. A strong Confederate presence at Funkstown threatened any Union advance against Gen. Robert E. Lee‚Äôs position near Williamsport and the Potomac River as he retreated to Virginia after the Battle of Gettysburg. Maj. Gen. J.E.B.

Gen. John Buford‚Äôs Federal cavalry division cautiously approached Funkstown via the National Road on Friday morning July 10, 1863, it encountered Stuart‚Äôs crescent-shaped, three-mile-long battle line. It was Stuart‚Äôs first defensive battle since reentering Maryland. The high ground constituted Stuart‚Äôs extreme right, held by Preston Chew‚Äôs horse artillery. A nearby stone barn and barnyard wall proved a superb defensive position for the 34th Virginia Battalion‚Äôs dismounted cavalry. Col. Thomas C. Devin‚Äôs dismounted Union cavalry brigade attacked about 8:00 a.m. By mid-afternoon, with Buford‚Äôs cavalrymen running low on ammunition and gaining little ground, Col. Lewis A.

Anderson‚Äôs Confederate brigade now faced them, the first time opposing infantry had clashed since the Battle of Gettysburg. By early evening, the Union Army began withdrawing south towards Beaver Creek, where the Union I, VI, and XI Corps had concentrated. Stuart had kept the Federals at bay for yet another day. The day-long battle east of the road resulted in 479 casualties. The Chaney house served as a hospital. At the Keller home, Confederate Major Henry D.

The goal of the USCA is to grow the sport of curling in the United States and win medals in competitions both domestic and abroad. Curling's recent popularity has swelled the USCA to 185 curling clubs and approximately 23,500 curlers in the United States. The United States Olympic men's curling teams have seen success in recent years, most notably winning the gold medal at the 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, led by skip John Shuster. In August 2019 the USCA announced that long-time CEO Rick Patzke was stepping away and former Chairman of the Board of Directors Rich Lepping would act as the interim CEO while the search for a new permanent CEO proceeded. Jeff Plush was announced as the new CEO on February 6, 2020. Plush was formerly the commissioner of the National Women's Soccer League.  International competition  As a member of the World Curling Federation (WCF), the USCA sends teams to represent the United States at a number of international competitions. = World Championships = The United States has been represented at numerous world curling championships, including men's, women's, mixed, junior's, senior's, mixed doubles, and wheelchair. While some world championships are open entry, such that any WCF member association that wants can a send a team, most limit the number of teams and set qualification requirements. For the men's and women's championships there are a number of ways the United States can qualify to send a team: * Host the championship * Be the top ranked team from the Americas region (if the championship host is not from the Americas region) * Win the Americas Challenge * Finish in top 2 at the World Qualification Event The United States has had a team at the Men's World Championship every year since its expansion to a world event in 1961. In those 59 appearances the US team has earned 22 medals. Similarly the United States has also had a team at the Women's World Championship every year since its inception in 1979, earning 6 medals in the 41 appearances. =Olympics= The United States has been represented in both men's and women's curling at every Winter Olympics since it was reinstated as a full event in 1998. The country was also represented in the inaugural mixed doubles competition at the 2018 Winter Olympics. The United States has placed twice in the Olympic curling events, both for the men's event. In the 2006 Turin Winter Olympics the men's team earned bronze under the guidance of skip Pete Fenson. Most recently, at the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, skip John Shuster's team won the gold medal. John Shuster and Joe Polo were on the medal winning team both years. Curling was a demonstration event at the 1988 and 1992 Winter Olympics. The United States participated in the men's and women's events both years and the men's team earned the bronze medal in 1992.  High Performance Program  In 2010 USA Curling created the High Performance Program (HPP) to provide coaching, funding, and other resources to a selection of competitive curlers in the United States with the goal of improving the country's competitive success on the international stage. Each season 3 men's teams, 3 women's teams, 2 junior men's teams, 2 junior women's teams, and a selection of mixed doubles athletes are admitted into the program. The HPP has a large coaching staff involved, overseen by director Derek Brown. In the fall of 2018 USA Curling announced the addition of a HPP Junior Developmental Pool, an offshoot of the Junior High Performance Program to improve the curling skills of 21 curlers 16 to 18 years old. In 2019 it was announced that the Chaska Curling Center in Chaska, Minnesota was selected as the USA Curling National Training Center, providing the HPP participants a place to practice and hold events throughout the season. List of clubs  Regional associations  USA Curling member clubs are organized into eleven regional curling associations. * Alaska Curling Association * Colorado Curling Association * Dakota Territory Curling Association * Grand National Curling Club of America * Great Lakes Curling Association *Midwest Curling Association * Mid America Curling Association *Minnesota Curling Association * Mountain Pacific Curling Association * Washington Curling Association * Wisconsin State Curling Association  Championship events  The United States Curling Association typically holds ten national championship events each season. * Men's National Championship * Women's National Championship * Junior National Championships *Senior National Championships *Mixed Doubles National Championship * College National Championship * U18 National Championship *Mixed National Championship * Club National Championships * Arena National Championships  Hall of Fame  In 1984 the USCA started a Hall of Fame recognize and honor individuals and teams that have achieved extraordinary distinction in curling or have made major contribution to the development of curling in the United States. As of 2018 there have been 45 individuals and 4 teams inducted into the Hall of Fame. The Hall of Fame is housed at the USCA headquarters in Stevens Point, Wisconsin. The first inductee was Bud Somerville, 2-time world champion and 2-time Olympian. Somerville is also included as skip of two of the four teams to have been inducted to the Hall of Fame, the 1965 World Men's Championship team and the 1975 World Men's Championship team.

Prasher (born August 1951) is an American molecular biologist. He is known for his work to clone and sequence the genes for the photoprotein aequorin and green fluorescent protein (GFP) and for his proposal to use GFP as a tracer molecule. He communicated his pioneering work to Martin Chalfie and Roger Y. Tsien, but by 1991 was himself unable to obtain further research funding, and left academia. Eventually, he had to abandon science. Chalfie and Tsien were awarded the 2008 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for work that they publicly acknowledged was substantially based on the work of Douglas Prasher, and through their efforts and those of others, Douglas Prasher returned to scientific research work in June 2010.  Career  Prasher received his Ph.D. in biochemistry from the Ohio State University in 1979. From 1979 to 1983, he worked in genetics and biochemistry research at the University of Georgia, where he identified the gene sequence for aequorin. He then joined the Biology Department of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Woods Hole, Massachusetts where he studied bioluminescence. In 1988, he received a two- year, $200,000 grant from the American Cancer Society to clone the gene for green fluorescent protein (GFP), the protein that gives the jellyfish its glow. Prasher succeeded in this project, and later shared his findings with Martin Chalfie and Roger Tsien after each scientist had communicated with him. In subsequent years, Prasher provided the clone to hundreds of scientists. Reports that Prasher had difficulty in achieving fluorescence of GFP in other species in recombinant studies are inaccurate, as Prasher had successfully worked with the Chalfie group to show recombinant expression in the bacterium E. coli and the nematode C. elegans, and later in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. By the time Prasher's ACS funding ended, he had isolated a partial, but almost complete gfp cDNA, with 965 bases out of the 1,050 bases of the corresponding mRNA. It would require construction of another cDNA library during the following (non-funded) year for Prasher to isolate a full-length cDNA clone, although it must be noted that this partial cDNA clone was subsequently used and found to be sufficient for successful heterologous expression in E. coli, C. elegans and A. thaliana. By this time Prasher could not afford to devote limited resources to expression studies in E. coli. It wasn't until the Nobel Prize announcement that it became clear how unfortunate this had been. Chalfie and Tsien went on to their successful expression studies. GFP has subsequently found application as a biochemical tracer in areas such as fluorescent studies of gene expression. Prasher had applied to the National Institutes of Health for funding but had been turned down, and by the time he was undergoing review for promotion from assistant to untenured associate, he had decided to leave academia. Subsequently, Prasher worked for the Animal & Plant Health Inspection Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture at its Otis Plant Protection Center in Cape Cod, Massachusetts as a population geneticist, and was later transferred to the Plant Germplasm Quarantine & Biotechnology Laboratory in Beltsville, Maryland. After working conditions deteriorated at the Beltsville location, he went to work for NASA subcontractor AZ Technology in Huntsville, Alabama, working on an existing project to develop lab-on-a-chip devices to monitor cabin environment and to perform human diagnostics during long-term spaceflight. However, he lost his job after 1.5 years when NASA reorganized and canceled the project. On 8 October 2008, the 2008 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Osamu Shimomura, Chalfie, and Tsien for their work on GFP. Prasher was not included among the Nobel laureates, as only three individuals can share in a single Nobel Prize. Chalfie said of Prasher's contribution: > (Douglas Prasher's) work was critical and essential for the work we did in > our lab. They could've easily given the prize to Douglas and the other two > and left me out. Tsien also agreed that they couldn't have done it without Prasher and \\"Doug Prasher had a very important role.\\" In an October 9, 2008 phone interview with National Public Radio (NPR) and October 14, 2008 TV interview with Inside Edition, Prasher reported that he was unable to find a job in science, his life savings had run out, and he was working as a courtesy shuttle bus driver for a Toyota dealership in Huntsville at $8.50 an hour. In the NPR broadcast, one of his former colleagues called Prasher's current situation a \\"staggering waste of talent\\". Prasher has stated his wish to resume a career in science, but not particularly with jellyfish. He has publicly expressed his pleasure at learning of the awarding of the Nobel Prize to Shimomura, Chalfie, and Tsien: > I'm really happy for them. I was really surprised that particular topic > carried that much weight. Chalfie and Tsien invited Prasher and his wife, Virginia Eckenrode, to attend the Nobel Prize ceremony, as their guests and at their expense. All three of the 2008 Chemistry laureates thanked Prasher in their speeches. In June 2010, Prasher was finally able to return to science, working for Streamline Automation in Huntsville until December 2011, and then from 2012 to 2015 in Tsien's lab at the University of California in San Diego.Douglas Prasher profileRoger Tsien Obituary Publications Prasher, D., McCann, R.O., Cormier, M.J., Cloning and expression of the cDNA coding for aequorin, a bioluminescent calcium-binding protein.

It is the first novel in the Guests of War trilogy, which follows the lives of Norah and Gavin Stoakes after they are evacuated from England to Canada during World War II. The novel won the Canadian Library Association Book of the Year Award for Children and the Geoffrey Bilson Award (for best Canadian work of historical fiction written for youth). Plot summary Norah and Gavin Stoakes live in a peaceful English village until World War II causes them to be evacuated to Toronto. Norah, an independent ten-year-old, is angry with the evacuation and resents having to care for Gavin. Five-year-old Gavin does not understand the evacuation and is confused and frightened. When they arrive in Canada, Norah and Gavin are placed with Florence Ogilvie, a bossy and cold widow and her timid spinster daughter, Mary Ogilvie. The Ogilvies only wanted Gavin but were convinced to take Norah as well. Norah is acutely aware of their preference toward Gavin, rather than her. While Gavin quickly settles into his new home where he is spoilt and coddled by Florence, Norah cannot settle. She dislikes Florence, is bored in her strict new home, is unpopular at her new school, begins to wet the bed (something she was very angry at Gavin for doing on the boat trip there), and constantly worries about what is happening to her family in England. As weeks go by, Norah‚Äôs resentment of Florence increases. Although she begins to make new friends, her misery increases as she realizes she cannot return to England for much longer than she was originally told. After Florence and Norah have an argument, Norah decides to run away and return to England on her own. She originally leaves without Gavin but decides she cannot leave him to be spoilt by Florence in a foreign country. She takes him with her but they only get as far as the train station before Norah realizes her plan is impossible. They return to the Ogilvies, expecting punishment but find that Florence and Mary have been very worried. Florence apologizes for ignoring Norah in the past months and asks if they can begin again. Norah accepts the offer and attempts to try to live happily in Canada. Life begins to improve and Norah accepts Canada as her temporary home for the duration of the war. Title meaning The title of The Sky is Falling comes from a child's misinterpretation of the Blitz. Early in the novel, Norah and Gavin are listening to stories with other evacuees. The group hears the story of The Sky is Falling (Chicken Little), about a chicken who believed the sky was falling. A young evacuee states that is what was happening in England.

It became well known across America and Canada as \\"Minnesota 13\\", a premium quality twice distilled and properly aged whiskey, (said by many to taste remarkably like \\"Canadian Club\\"). Stearns County was populated predominantly by German and Polish Catholics at that time. Holdingford was considered the unofficial moonshine capital of Minnesota. One story for the origin of the name says it came from a producer who hand-lettered his labels because he was proud of his product. Minnesota 13 was the name of an open pollinated corn variety developed by the University of Minnesota and used in Stearns County because of its shorter growing season. Eventually, Federal agents managed to sharply curtail the large-scale manufacturing of moonshine in Stearns County. They succeeded by burning barns and sheds and through various acts of intimidation. They exploited divisions within the community by using informers and they undermined the tip system by sharpening their raiding strategies. Increased surveillance and a bigger stick to punish in the form of Jones Law finally blunted community resistance. However, while they managed to alter behavior, they failed to change beliefs. Stearns County had its revenge when it voted 4 to 1 for repeal of the hated 18th amendment to the US Constitution. A number of books on local history refer to Minnesota 13 and its importance of helping people through tough times.

It introduced privatised and deregulated bus services throughout Great Britain and came into effect in October of 1986. The Transport Act of 1985 was created as a response to growing concern about the environmental effect the private transportation was having and the public's objection to an increase in road construction. The Transport Act of 1985 was introduced by Margaret Thatcher and the Act committed to reduce the amount the public paid for commercial objects. This was achieved by reducing the control governments had of bus systems and reducing the subsidies to bus companies. The Conservative government also believed the removal of subsidies and local government control would lead to an increase in competition between companies. The deregulation of Buses applied throughout the United Kingdom, excluding bus services in Greater London, and was led by the Conservative government. Deregulation and Elimination of Barriers = Proposal = In 1984 a proposal to deregulate local bus services was published in the white paper Buses and in more detailed consultation papers. The Transport Act of 1985 (part I) brought these proposals into effect. Deregulation, elimination of barriers, and the transfer to the private sector were some of the major changes the Transport Act of 1985 established. Privatization and bus deregulation came into effect on 26 October 1986. Local authorities were required to transfer their municipally-owned bus services to separate companies. Although most of these companies have since been privatized, with the exception of Lothian Buses in Edinburgh; a few other municipal bus companies remain today. The Transport Act of 1985 also mandated that local governments publish statements of their own policies for bus services deemed socially vital that were not operated by commercial companies. = London = London faced a different type of deregulation. The standard deregulation that applied to other cities in the United Kingdom was not applied to bus services in Greater London; instead, the Act brought about a system of franchised routes operated by private companies but managed by London Buses Ltd. Meaning that although the bus companies in London were privatized London's government still retained the ability to regulate the companies. At the time the Transport Act of 1985 was put into place London Bus companies were governed by the London Regional Transport Act of 1984. = Transport Act 1985: Deregulation (Part I) = Part I of the Transport Act of 1985 eradicated, excluding London, the need for the required road service licence throughout the United Kingdom. Part I replaced service licensing with a system of registration. This caused licensing authorities losing many of their powers and made it possible for operators to register new routes. For an operator to register a new route the licensed operator had to supply the traffic commissioner with information of the proposed route, the timeline for the trip, stopping arrangements, the vehicles to be used, and the terminal points. In accordance with the Act the traffic commissioner had to received the registration at least 42 days prior to when the route is to be run. It was mandatory for the notice to go through the traffic commissioner for a licence bus operator to operate. After approval the operator was required to run the route according to the specifications provided in the registration. Deregulation also led to firms being able to charge any fares they wish, run routes, and freely enter and leave the market. This was accomplished by reducing the amount of subsidies local governments could provide for services. = Transport Act 1985: Privatization (Part II) = Privatization proposals were put forth to change the structure of the bus industry. The bus industry was managed mainly by public sector companies in the years prior to 1985. Privatization was introduced by the Conservative government as a way to achieve better access to private capital and more committed management. In order to achieve this goal the Conservative government made it so local governments could only provide subsidies for services and prohibited subsidies that would promote low fares.  Aftermath  The Transport Act of 1985 changed how bus services were run in the United Kingdom. The Act introduced the largest change in the framework of bus services in over five decades and it replaced the prior publicly owned and highly regulated bus service with a largely competitive commercial system. Additionally, the removal of subsidies made it so different firms had to bid on the right to operate with subsidized services.

Upon his arrival in Palestine, Lishansky sought to join HaShomer but, denied membership, he founded a rival organization, HaMagen. Several years later, he joined the Jewish espionage organization, Nili. Lishansky was wanted by the Ottomans for his activities and was betrayed by HaShomer when he sought refuge with them. He escaped capture several times, but was eventually caught and sentenced to death in Damascus. Early life Lishansky was born near Kiev in the Russian Empire in 1890, to Eidel and Ya'akov Toviah. After most of his family was killed in a fire, he made Aliyah with his father (the reported year of their Aliyah varies between 1891 and 1896). They settled with Yosef's brother, Israel, who was living in Metula. His father soon disappeared during a trip to Jerusalem, and Lishansky began living at his brother's home. Excelling in his studies, he was sent to a seminar in Jerusalem, but did not complete his educational studies due to financial difficulties. Instead, Yosef travelled to Egypt, where he managed an agricultural farm for two years and then returned to the Land of Israel. In 1910, he married Rivka Broshkovsky, and they had a daughter, Ivriya, and a son, Toviah. Jewish defense organizations In 1912, Lishansky attempted to join the HaShomer organization. HaShomer required a trial period for all recruits, and Lishansky was sent to guard in Poria, Rishon LeZion, Ben Shemen and finally Menahemia. In February 1915, Lishansky's force killed the leader of an Arab gang that attacked the village. Because of HaShomer's policy of avoiding blood feuds with the Arabs, Lishansky was declined entry to the organization. This was later perceived simply as an excuse not to accept Lishansky, who was proficient in the use of weapons, horseback riding and Arabic. Israel Shochat, a leader of HaShomer, later wrote that Lishansky often demonstrated weakness, adventurism and boastfulness. Lishansky then decided to form a rival organization, named HaMagen (\\"The Shield\\"), which included rejected HaShomer members. The group did not wish to directly compete with HaShomer, so they selected the southern Jewish villages, which were previously guarded by Arabs. Lishansky was chosen as the leader of the organization, and travelled to the south to negotiate with the villages. HaMagen replaced the Arab guards in Ruhama, Be'er Tuvia and Mazkeret Batya, and later Gedera. Despite a clause in HaMagen's charter preventing it from guarding villages formerly or presently guarded by HaShomer, the latter attempted and failed to disband HaMagen. In January 1917, unknown by his HaMagen co-members, Lishansky left Egypt to focus on his activities in Nili. Ill will was created and led to the decline of HaMagen. Despite this, some HaMagen members joined Lishansky in Nili. Nili activities and death Lishansky joined Nili in December 1915, when Avshalom Feinberg was arrested for espionage and held in Beersheba. Because he was active in the south, he was recruited by Feinberg to pass information to and from Sarah Aaronsohn, who was operating from Atlit. He did this by hiding notes in the loaves of bread passed to the prisoners. In January 1917, after Feinberg was released and sought to secretly travel to Egypt to meet with the British, he was accompanied by Lishansky, who had intimate knowledge of the area. On 20 January they were attacked by two Ottoman soldiers and a gang of Bedouin near Rafah, which left Feinberg dead and Lishansky wounded. Lishansky was left to die but managed to reach a British patrol that took him to a hospital in Port Said, where he met Aaron Aaronsohn on 25 January 1917, and told him about Feinberg's death. Because Lishansky was the only witness to the killing, rumors started circulating that he was the one who killed Feinberg for personal reasons, or because of a romance with Sarah Aaronsohn. They were disproved only after the Six-Day War, when Feinberg's remains were found and the Bedouin in the region interrogated. Lishansky subsequently returned to Atlit, Nili's central base of operations, and shifted his entire focus on the organization. He was responsible for collecting espionage reports from Nili agents in the vicinity, and managing the finances funnelled from Egypt. In April 1917, Lishansky again travelled to Egypt, against the will of his superior, Aaron Aaronsohn. He returned in June and continued his activity in Nili. In October 1917, while Lishansky was in Zikhron Ya'akov, the Ottoman authorities received information about Nili's activities by accidentally catching a homing pigeon with a message from Sarah Aaronsohn, and after capturing the Nili operative Na'aman Belkind, they found out about a cell in Zikhron. They encircled the village, capturing Sarah Aaronsohn, but Lishansky managed to escape, and became a fugitive with a price on his head. He met with HaShomer members carrying gold and accompanied them to Tel Adas. HaShomer, which was opposed to Lishansky's activities, nevertheless decided to hide him, although as pressure from the Turks increased, they held another meeting and this time decided to execute him and hand his body over to the authorities. He was led to a place near Metula on 9 October, shot twice, and left for dead. However, he did not die and by the time the Turkish soldiers reached the area, he had escaped. On 17 October Lishansky found refuge in Petah Tikva with friends of Aaron Aaronsohn's, but they were reluctant to hide him and after two days sent him on his way. He travelled south in hopes of crossing the border in the Sinai Peninsula and reaching British lines. On the night of 19‚Äì20 October, Lishansky attempted to steal a camel from Bedouins in the Shephelah region. He was caught and turned over to the Ottoman authorities. The Ottomans held and interrogated him in Ramla and Jerusalem, and after ten days in Jerusalem he was moved to Damascus. During his time in prison, Lishansky contacted the Yishuv and asked for funds to bribe his way out of incarceration. Meir Dizengoff, one of the leaders of Tel Aviv, denied funding not only to bribe Lishansky's way to freedom, but even for the succor he provided other prisoners including anti-Zionists, despite having received the money from Nili. Lishansky disclosed members of HaShomer to the Turks, and by some accounts members of Nili as well. He was sentenced to death by hanging, along with the fellow Nili member Na'aman Belkind (who complained of the sentence since he withheld nothing during interrogations). They were hanged in a public square in Damascus on 16 December 1917. On 24 December 1919 Lishansky and Belkind's bodies were transferred to a cemetery in Rishon LeZion, although less than 20 people attended the funeral as part of the anti-Nili sentiment in the Yishuv at the time. In August 1979, Lishansky's body was moved again in a state ceremony to Mount Herzl, near the grave of Avshalom Feinberg. Public image Lishansky was generally seen in a negative light in the Yishuv, partly due to Nili's overall problematic image. Other factors included rumors about backstabbing Avshalom Feinberg, and unfavorable personality traits. His grave in Rishon LeZion was vandalized several times over the years, and in 1937, Habima Theatre ran a play portraying him in a negative light. Lishansky's image underwent a slow transformation to the image of a national hero, along with the transformation of Nili's image in general. After Feinberg's burial site was found near Rafah after the Six-Day War and Lishansky's name was cleared, more Israelis began to view him positively, and a request was sent to Prime Minister Levi Eshkol to move Lishansky's grave to Mount Herzl. The request was denied, although the struggle to improve his image resumed and gained strength after \\"The Revolution\\" of 1977, when the right-wing party, Likud, was elected to form a government for the first time. A movement called \\"The Public Committee for the Rehabilitation of Yosef Lishansky\\" was founded, including notable figures like Uri Zvi Greenberg and Rehavam Ze'evi. The movement succeeded in gaining recognition for Lishansky's activities in World War I, and the transfer of his remains in a state ceremony to Mount Herzl on 8 August 1979.

Fictional character biography Vin Gonzales, an NYPD officer, is currently the roommate of Peter Parker. When Peter was in search of roommate, Harry Osborn offered the idea of Vin, a friend of Lily and Carlie. He does not seem to trust Spider-Man. Vin seems to have a crush on Carlie Cooper. When the first rent arrives, Vin and Peter recently had an argument because of Peter's problems at the Daily Bugle. Vin thought that Peter still had his job as a photographer and Vin was giving Peter news tips. Peter decided not to tell Vin until he had found a job. Vin thought that Peter was playing him and that made Vin very angry. His anger towards Spider-Man increased where Kraven the Hunter's daughter Ana Tatiana Kravinoff had mistaken him from Spider-Man, causing trouble for him by having Vin placed on suspension from his job and after he was captured, Vin had to be saved by the real Spider-man (who was wearing the costume of his fellow crime fighter Daredevil). Spider-Man then had to use a cover story by pretending he left a costume with Peter Parker to protect his identity which was actually intended to prevent Vin from suspecting that Spider-Man was Peter himself.Amazing Spider-Man Vol 1 #566-567 Later, Carlie Cooper found that a group of Spider-tracers were in the vicinity of Peter's and Vin's apartment.

Ohio, 379 U.S. 89 (1964), is a United States Supreme Court decision concerning evidence obtained as part of an unlawful arrest. Reversing the Ohio Supreme Court's decision, the U.S. Supreme Court held that Ohio police arrested defendant without probable cause, so the criminally-punishable evidence found on his person during an incidental search was inadmissible. Accordingly, the U.S. Supreme Court vacated defendant's conviction. Facts Receiving unspecified \\"information\\" and \\"reports\\" concerning William Beck and his current whereabouts, policeman in Cleveland, Ohio stopped him in his automobile and placed him under arrest without a warrant on November 10, 1961 for \\"a clearing house operation, scheme of chance.\\". As incidental to arrest, they searched, firstly, his car and found nothing noteworthy. At the police station, however, they searched his person and discovered, \\"beneath the sock of his leg,\\" an envelope containing a number of clearing house slips, a then- illegal possession in Ohio for which he was charged in Cleveland Municipal Court. Beck filed a motion to suppress the slips, arguing that they were seized in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, but the Ohio Courts overruled after a hearing. Beck was eventually convicted at trial, with the slips being the primary basis of that verdict. On appeal, both the Ohio Court of Appeals and the Ohio Supreme Court (the highest in the state) affirmed his conviction on the belief that the searches were part of a lawful arrest and thus valid, despite the lack of a warrant. Question Did the policeman's arrest and incidental search of William Beck person violate Beck's rights under the Fourth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment, and if so, should the criminally-punishable slips be suppressed as evidence? Holding The majority (Stewart, joined by Warren, Douglas, Brennan, White, Goldberg) overturned the Ohio Supreme Court ruling, invalidating the arrest and all evidence obtained therefrom. They found that the policemen's justification for the arrest (especially their description of the informer) was too vague and that their suspicion relied too much on Beck's prior arrests and convictions. The Court concluded that the \\"record in this case does not contain a single objective fact to support a belief by the officers that the petitioner was engaged in criminal activity at the time they arrested him.\\"Beck, 379 U.S. at 95. The court did acknowledge that the policemen may have received information from someone, but they felt the prosecution \\"needed to show with considerably more specificity\\" what the information said, who the informer was, and why the police found the informer reliable. Otherwise, a showing of probable cause was absent. On that note, Justice Potter Stewart concluded thus: \\"We may assume that the officers acted in good faith. But good faith on the part of the arresting officer is not enough. If subjective good faith alone were the test, the protections of the Fourth Amendment would evaporate, and the people would be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, only in the discretion of the police.\\"Beck, 379 U.S. at 97. The Supreme Court had three dissenters, Justice Clark, Justice Black, and Justice Harlan. Clark, with Black joining, contended that the U.S. Supreme Court should honor the probable cause determination of any State's highest court, else \\"this Court will be continually disputing with state and federal courts over the minutiae of facts in every search and seizure case.\\"Beck, 379 U.S. at 99 (Clark, J., dissenting). Justice Harlan's argument was that the police had probable cause because the informer, however vague his identity and information were, said that Beck would be at \\"East 115th Street and Beulah,\\" and the police did, indeed, find Beck at such place. This correspondence, Harlan felt, was enough to establish informer's reliability and, thus, enough to establish probable cause.Beck, 379 U.S. at 101-03 (Harlan, J., dissenting). Clark, Black, and Harlan would have affirmed Beck's conviction.

With just an elementary school education, Pitcairn rose through the ranks of the Pennsylvania railroad industry, and played a significant role in the creation of the modern oil and natural gas industries. He went on to found the Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company (now PPG Industries), an early industry innovator which quickly grew into the largest manufacturer of plate glass in the United States, and amassed one of the largest fortunes in the United States at the time. Pitcairn was also the primary financial benefactor of the General Church of the New Jerusalem, a Christian church that follows the teachings of Emanuel Swedenborg, and was a major activist in the American anti-vaccination movement. Early life Pitcairn was born on January 10, 1841 in Johnstone, Renfrewshire, Scotland to parents John Pitcairn Sr. (1803 ‚Äì 1884), a machinist, and Agnes McEwan (1803 - 1891), a housekeeper. He was one of six children resulting from the marriage, and also had two older half-siblings from his father's first marriage. Pitcairn's parents had initially emigrated to America around 1835, and lived first in Brooklyn, New York, and then in Paterson, New Jersey, where Pitcairn' sister, Janet, was born. Meeting with a lack of financial success, they returned to Scotland a few years later. In 1846, however, the family emigrated again to America, this time with four new children, and settled in Allegheny, Pennsylvania, where Pitcairn's uncle, Alexander Pitcairn, had started a woolens business. There, Pitcairn attended public school until dropping out at age 14 to pursue a career in the railroad. Around 1849 Pitcairn and the rest of his family were baptized by David Powell, a reverend of the New Church. Career =Rail= Oil Creek and Allegheny River Railway stock certificate vignette Pitcairn began his professional life at the age of 14, working as an office boy for the general superintendent of the Pennsylvania Railroad in Altoona. He soon learned telegraphy, and through that became friends with Andrew Carnegie. Pitcairn rapidly worked his way up through the railroad industry; first as Assistant to the Superintendent of the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railroad, and next as Assistant to the Superintendent of the Philadelphia Division of the Pennsylvania Railroad. On February 22, 1861, during his tenure at the latter, Pitcairn was in charge of the train which carried President- elect Abraham Lincoln from Harrisburg to Philadelphia, en route to the inauguration in Washington, DC. Later, when the Confederate Army invaded Pennsylvania before the Battle of Antietam, Pitcairn and his brother Robert Pitcairn were dispatched by Colonel Thomas A. Scott, then Assistant Secretary of War, to Chambersburg, to head the train service for the government. Pitcairn next served as Assistant Superintendent of the Middle Division of the Pennsylvania Railroad, and followed this with a stint as the Superintendent of the Middle Division of the Philadelphia and Erie Railroad. Finally, in 1869, he was appointed General Manager of the Oil Creek and Allegheny River Railway Company. =Energy= Upon forming a partnership with J. J. Vandergrift of Pittsburgh and George V. Forman of Buffalo, Pitcairn resigned from his position of general manager to focus exclusively on the oil business. During this period, Pitcairn built the Imperial Refinery at Oil City, Pennsylvania, and was heavily involved with the production, refining, and pipeline transportation of oil. With Vandergrift, he built and controlled the first natural gas pipeline for manufacturing purposes, and had a controlling stake in the Natural Gas Company, Ltd., founded in the summer of 1875, and later to become the Natural Gas Company of West Virginia. Through these and other successful investments in energy, mining, and banking, Pitcairn substantially expanded his wealth. =Glass= Headquarters of PPG Industries, formerly Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company In 1883, Pitcairn teamed up with Captain John Baptiste Ford and several others to establish the Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company (PPG). Based in Creighton, Pennsylvania (about 20 miles north of Pittsburgh along the Allegheny River), PPG soon became the United States' first commercially successful producer of high-quality, thick flat glass using the plate process. PPG was also the world's first plate glass plant to power its furnaces with locally produced natural gas, an innovation which rapidly stimulated widespread industrial use of the cleaner-burning fuel. PPG expanded quickly. By 1900, known as the \\"Glass Trust\\", it included ten plants, had a 65 percent share of the U.S. plate glass market, and had become the nation's second largest producer of paint. Today, known as PPG Industries, the company is a multibillion-dollar, Fortune 500 corporation with 150 manufacturing locations around the world. It now produces coatings, glass, fiberglass, and chemicals. Pitcairn served as a director of PPG from its start, its president from 1897 to 1905, and chairman of the board from 1894 until his death. =Magnate= Pitcairn's interests and holdings were not limited to PPG; at the time of his death, he was also president of the C. H. Wheeler Manufacturing Company, the Pittsburgh Valve and Fittings Company, and the Loyal Hanna Coal and Coke Company, and a director of the Central National Bank of Philadelphia, the Columbia Chemical Company, the Michigan Chemical Company, the Natural Gas Company of West Virginia, and the Owosso Sugar Company. Family Pitcairn was the brother of Pennsylvania railroad magnate Robert Pitcairn and consul-general Hugh Pitcairn. In 1877, the already highly successful, 38-year-old Pitcairn met 21-year-old Gertrude Starkey (1855‚Äì1898). Two years later, he proposed marriage, but was gently turned down. Reputedly, Starkey's strong New Church beliefs about the ideal of marriage required her to conduct a close examination of the spiritual nature of her feelings for him. Undeterred by her rejection, Pitcairn continued to court Starkey for five more years. Finally she accepted, and they were married in 1884. Following their marriage, the couple lived on Spring Garden Street in Philadelphia, until the completion of the new family estate, Cairnwood, in 1895. Together they had six children, only four of whom survived infancy. These were: * Vera Pitcairn (1887‚Äì1910). Vera died suddenly of appendicitis at the age of 23. * Raymond Pitcairn (1885‚Äì1966). Raymond was a lawyer, a businessman, a collector of ancient and medieval art, and an amateur architect. He supervised the building of the Bryn Athyn Cathedral. He was also the national chairman and a major financial supporter of the Sentinels of the Republic, a right-wing political group of the 1920s and 1930s which opposed child labor legislation and the New Deal. * Theodore Pitcairn (1893‚Äì1973). Theodore was an arts collector and philanthropist, and a minister in the General Church of the New Jerusalem. In the late 1930s a doctrinal schism within the church led him and several other members to found another \\"New Church\\" branch known as The Lord's New Church Which Is Nova Hierosolyma. He served as a leader of this new church until his death. * Harold Frederick Pitcairn (1897‚Äì1960). Harold, a lifelong aviation enthusiast, started Pitcairn Aviation, an air mail service that ultimately grew into Eastern Airlines. He founded the Pitcairn Aircraft Company, which designed and built under license pioneering airmail aircraft and autogyros. He played a key role in promoting rotary wing flight leading to development of the helicopter. Religious philanthropy Bryn Athyn Cathedral Pitcairn was an active member and benefactor of the General Church of the New Jerusalem, a branch of the New Church, which follows the teachings of Emanuel Swedenborg. Pitcairn's financial largess enabled the founding of the Swedenborgian settlement at Bryn Athyn, Pennsylvania, the construction of the town's library, and the New Church's Bryn Athyn Cathedral. He also financed the construction of a new campus for the Academy of the New Church, a Swedenborgian learning center comprising a secondary school, a college, and a theological school. The campus was completed in 1911. Anti-vaccination activism \\"The Fallacy of Vaccination\\" by John Pitcairn During the last ten years of his life, Pitcairn was highly active in the American anti-vaccination movement. According to public health historian James Colgrove, Pitcairn's opposition to vaccination stemmed from Swedenborgian teachings, a devotion to homeopathy, an alternative medical practice embraced by many New Church members, and his son Raymond's adverse reaction to a vaccination. On March 5, 1907, in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, he delivered an address to the Committee on Public Health and Sanitation of the Pennsylvania General Assembly criticizing vaccination. He later sponsored the National Anti-Vaccination Conference, which, held in Philadelphia on October, 1908, led to the creation of the Anti- Vaccination League of America. When the League was organized later that month, Pitcairn was chosen to be its first president. In May, 1910, an article by Pitcairn entitled 'The Fallacy of Vaccination' was published in the Ladies Home Journal, a periodical with a readership of several million. On December 1, 1911, he was appointed by Pennsylvania Governor John K. Tener to the Pennsylvania State Vaccination Commission, which in accordance with the law mandating it, was to include as members two anti-vaccinationists as well as two pro-vaccinationists. Pitcairn subsequently authored a detailed report strongly opposing the Commission's pro-vaccination conclusions. Later life and death Cairnwood Mansion Construction of Pitcairn's family estate, Cairnwood, was completed in 1895. His wife, Gertrude, died just a few years later, in 1898. Pitcairn never remarried. When asked why, he once responded, \\"I would no sooner remarry than if Gertrude were standing in the other room.\\" Pitcairn remained quite active in his numerous business, philanthropy, and social activism capacities well into his seventies. Finally, in the fall of 1915, he suffered a bout of pneumonia, from which he never fully recovered. He died at Cairnwood on July 22, 1916. In 2002, Cairnwood was entered onto the National Register of Historic Places.

Granitsa lies in a hilly valley in the eastern Osogovo mountains. It is bisected by a ravine, the bed of a rivulet which goes almost dry in the summer and autumn. Granitsa includes several neighbourhoods: Yakimova, Dzhoneva, Gorchovska, Efendiyska and Antova. The village was first mentioned in Vladislav the Grammarian's account of 1448: –ü–†–ò –í–Ñ–õ–ë–û–£–ñ–î–ò –ù–ê –°–ï–õ—¢ –ù—¢–ö–û–¢–û–†–Ñ–ú–ò –ñ–ò–í–û–£–©–Ñ, –ì–†–ê–ù–ò–¶–ê –ñ–Ñ –û–£–ë–û –¢–û–ú–û–£ –ü–†–û–ó–í–ê–ù—§ –ò–ú–û–£–©–û–£. At the time, the sons of the local Bulgarian noble (bolyarin) and later monk Jacob (Yakov) from Krupnik settled in Saint Luke's Monastery above Granitsa. The three brothers Joasaph (Yoasaf), David and Theophanes (Teofan) reconstructed the deserted and plundered Rila Monastery in 1453‚Äì1466. In 1469, they initiated the return of Saint John of Rila's remains from Veliko Tarnovo to the monastery. The village's name is derived from the dialectal word gran√≠tsa, \\"a sort of branched oak\\", from the Bulgarian word granka, \\"offshoot, offset\\". Granitsa was also mentioned in Ottoman tax registers of 1576 as Grani√ße. In the 19th century, most of the land in the village was the property of Turkish (Liman Aƒüa, Daut Beg) and Jewish (Sari Bohor) farm owners from Kyustendil. Landmarks in and around the village include the Bulgarian National Revival-time Church of Saint Elijah (1856‚Äì1857) and the residential defensive tower known as the Granitski House (1856), both built by Master Milenko. The Granitsa Monastery of Saint Luke lies to the southwest and may date to the 10th century; reconstructed in 1948, it is a fully active Bulgarian Orthodox monastery. Also southwest of Granitsa are the ruins of the eponymous medieval fortress from the Second Bulgarian Empire, probably a defensive station on the Velbazhd-≈†tip road. Another landmark is the Venerable Beech Forest, a protected area established in 1995 and covering . The village's football club is called Slavia and plays in the municipal amateur league. The local industry is represented by a branch of the Kyustendil winery. Wine production, vine and fruit growing are well developed. There is a regular bus link to the municipal and provincial capital.

His grandfather was born in Africa. John Andrew's mother was named Betty and his father was known as Dr. Clavern, because of his ability to cure snake bites. John Andrew had five brothers and five sisters. Before he left the plantation, two brothers and two sisters were dead. Early life Jackson had a bad relationship with his owner and mistress, as many slaves did, but often mentioned that his mistress hated him more than any other slave on the plantation. The reason for the mistress's hatred toward John was that when John was about ten, he was playing with one of the mistresses children in the dirt. The two boys found an old hickory root and started to play with it. The mistress's son noticed that John was picking roots faster then him and kicked John in the nose.He smeared blood on the boy's shirt. The little boy went to his mother and showed her the blood on his shirt. In return, the mistress whipped John and held her hatred for him and his family for the rest of the time she knew him. John Andrew grew up surrounded by brutality. If he was not getting whipped, a friend or family member of his would be getting whipped. The plantation where John lived was overseen by a violent and unforgiving master. The slaves would wake up and work in the fields all day in the hot sun. The sun would burn lumps on their backs, and their bare feet would be torn and cracked by the end of the day. When the slaves did not obey their masters, they would be punished with 25-100 lashes. The brutal lumps obtained by the heat of the sun, combined with the lashes from the whip, were awful and painful. What little sleep the slaves did get was cherished. However rats would come in the middle of the night and chew on the slaves' feet. Since the slaves' feet were so torn up from working barefoot all day, they could not feel the rats eat through their feet. In the morning, their feet were in so much pain it was hard to work. John Andrew's first job was being a scarecrow in the corn fields. He would stand out from dusk until dawn everyday posing as a scarecrow in the hot Carolina air. When he got older he was ordered to manage the plow, but due to his lack of strength, he was unable to manage the plow correctly. If John Andrew ever dropped the plow his master would beat him until his back was covered in blood. Even though he was experiencing so much hardship, around this time, John fell in love with a girl named Louisa. Master and mistress John Andrew's master was born in North Carolina and lived his young life as a Quaker. When the master was older, he moved to South Carolina and married a woman who had a few slaves. The master then set up a liquor store and had slaves steal cotton and bring it to him. In return, the slaves were rewarded with a quart of liquor, which was worth much less than the cotton the slaves stole for him. The method of stealing cotton in exchange for objects of less worth made many southern men rich. The master and his wife were then able to own more slaves and become even more rich. The mistress was born and raised in South Carolina. She was a mean lady to everyone except her family. The mistress would not allow slaves to eat bran, meat, or any other foods that were considered luxurious. And she would often watch the slaves being beaten, as it was among one of her favorite pastimes. Wife and children Louisa lived in the plantation about a mile away. John and Louisa were unofficially married and had two children. John was prohibited from visiting his wife and children, but John would often sneak out and be with his wife and kids. When the master would find out, John would be whipped, but John persisted and continued to see his wife and children until his wife's master moved to Georgia. In 1846, after John Andrew was separated from his wife, he fled slavery. Later after he escaped to Canada, he remarried. Many years later his second wife died in an asylum and he married for a third time. With his third wife he had two more children. Escape As time progressed, the idea of freedom became more and more real. One day, John Andrew bought a pony from one of the slaves on a neighboring plantation. When the mistress found out, she threatened to have the pony killed, and asked two of her sons-in-law to get rid of it. Hearing of the jeopardy of his pony, John hid the pony until Christmas. On Christmas Day, John took his pony and rode off from his plantation never to see his mother or father again. As he rode off to Boston, he ran into many white people who asked where he was off, to where John would respond that he was on his way to his plantation. John made it to the Sant√© Fe River where he boarded a small ship that was being run by a black man. John and his pony were dropped near land, but had to struggle upstream in order to reach it. After almost drowning, John and his pony made it to shore. Then, John heard about a special badge that all African Americans had to produce in order to prove they were allowed to be free. John, not having a badge, sold his pony to buy a cloak to hide from patrolmen. The cloak worked to his advantage till he was able to find a ship to Boston. When John found a ship heading to Boston, he tried to board but the crewmen refused to let John on board. The crewmen were afraid that he was working for a white man and trying to set them up. After being refused passage, John hid in a five by three-foot box that was loaded onto the ship and put in the lower levels. Eventually the crewmen found him and threatened to unload him on the next ship. There never was another ship, and John made it to Boston safely. From Boston, John Andrew went on to settle in Salem, Massachusetts. Once settled, he sought to purchase his family members still enslaved. He sent a letter to inquire about his family, and shortly after it was received, a slave agent was sent to search for him. Jackson avoided capture and was assisted by Harriet Beecher Stowe, who gave him food, clothes, and five dollars. He left Salem for Canada. Freedom In Salem, John was free but not safe. He worked as a leather tanner and part-time sawmill operator until the passage of the Fugitive Slave Law rekindled his fear of being returned to slavery. He escaped with help to Canada. Once in Canada, John Andrew settled in Saint John, New Brunswick. He remarried legally and had more children. Still seeking to purchase his family members in slavery, in 1857, he journeyed to Great Britain with his wife to solicit contributions. He lectured in Scotland and England with several others, including: David Guthrie, Rev. Thomas Candlish and Julia Griffiths. John Andrew and his wife lived in London, England until after the American Civil War ended. Eventually they returned to live in Springfield, Massachusetts. He travelled back and forth to South Carolina for many years trying to help the freedmen of Sumter County.

A desk accessory or applet is an example of a simple, stand-alone user interface, in contrast with a more complex application such as a spreadsheet or word processor. These widgets are typical examples of transient and auxiliary applications that don't monopolize the user's attention. On the other hand, graphical control elements (GUI \\"widgets\\") are examples of reusable modular components that are used together to build a more complex application, allowing programmers to build user interfaces by combining simple, smaller components. Classification Because the term, and the coding practice, has been extant since at least the 1980s, it has been applied in a number of contexts. =Primary types= A Graphical control element (GUI widget) is part of a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows a computer user to control and change the appearance of elements for operating a software application. In this context a widget may refer to a generic GUI element such as a check box, to an instance of that element, or to a customized collection of such elements used for a specific function or application (such as a dialog box for users to customize their computer screen appearances). A Widget toolkit is a set of programming tools that help developers reuse GUI widgets to build a user interface. A desktop widget is a specialized GUI widget intended to run on a computer desktop for computer users to control simple utility functions such as clocks, messaging services, and calendars. A mobile widget is the comparable equivalent for mobile devices (i.e. smart phones). A web widget is a portable application installed and executed, typically by non-expert webmasters on HTML-based web pages, to offer site visitors shopping, advertisements, videos, or other simple functionality from third party widget publishers. =Types of web widgets=A \\"widget application\\" is a third party web widget developed for an online social network platform, with the user interface or the entire application hosted by the network service. Social network companies such as Facebook and Myspace host these applications and provide them underlying platform services (such as display and storage of user-provided photos and other content, profile information about end users and communications features with other users) through special-purpose application programming interfaces. The term is used fairly loosely, in that many such applications are more complex internally and in operation than the simple applets that are called \\"widgets\\" in other contexts. The relationship between platform and developer is mutually beneficial, with the social network offering hardware and software infrastructure, and access to the social network's end user base, and with application publishers ranging from amateur developers to organized companies such as RockYou! and slide.com providing content and features that make the social network services more useful for their members. At present, there is no fee or payment between developers and social network platforms, and attempts to realize revenue from widgets (primarily advertising by the widget applications and sale of electronic commerce goods and services within the widgets) have been relatively unsuccessful. =Types of GUI widgets=Disclosure widgets are specific types of GUI widgets that may be hidden or expanded by computer users. *A metawidget is a GUI widget for controlling the operation of other widgets within a GUI.Blattner, Glinert, Jorge and Ormsby, 'Metawidgets: towards a theory of multimodal interface design'. Appears in Computer Software and Applications Conference, 1992. COMPSAC '92. Proceedings, Sixteenth Annual International .  Widget engine  architecture. See the location of Ubuntu Unity widgets, KDE Plasma widgets and Desktop widgets at the top layer. A widget engine is the software platform on which desktop or web widgets run. The widget model in widget engines is attractive because of ease of development. Most of these widgets can be created with a few images and about 10 to several hundred lines of XML/JavaScript/VBScript source code. A single host software system, such as a web browser, runs all the loaded widgets. This allows several desktop widgets to be built sharing resources and code. Widget engines are not to be confused with widget toolkits. Toolkits are used by GUI programmers, who combine several widgets (reusable components) to form a single application. A widget in a toolkit provides a single, low level interaction, and is prepared to communicate with other widgets in the toolkit. On the other hand, widget engines such as desktop widgets and web widgets are intended for end users. Desktop and web widgets are stand-alone, task-oriented applications which can be composed of several related interactions on its own. Types = GUI widgets = A graphical control element (often called GUI widget) represents a part of a graphical user interface (GUI) which the user can use to interact with the program the GUI belongs to. Graphical control elements are implemented like subroutines. Widget toolkits and software frameworks, like e.g. GTK+ or Qt, contain them in software libraries so that programmers can use them to build GUIs for their programs. Graphical user interface builders, such as e.g. Glade Interface Designer, facilitate the authoring of GUIs. = Desktop widgets = Wikipedia Widget, in Dashboard running under Mac OS X v10.4 Plasma Desktop with Plasmoids Desktop widgets (commonly just called widgets) are interactive virtual tools that provide single-purpose services such as showing the user the latest news, the current weather, the time, a calendar, a dictionary, a map program, a calculator, desktop notes, photo viewers, or even a language translator, among other things. Widgets can provide or augment the graphical shell. Examples of widget engines include: * Dashboard widgets of Apple Macintosh * Microsoft gadgets in Windows Vista, Windows 7, and in the Windows Live system - No longer supported, use now discouraged by Microsoft. * Various implementations for Linux, including Plasma widgets (available for KDE since version 4) and the widget engine used by GNOME Shell (available for GNOME since version 3). Both are active and under development. * Google DesktopEmployee benefits - Wikipedia running Google Gadgets - No longer supported, discontinued, some security issues re: data sharing. * Yahoo! Widgets for Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10, Mac OSX - No longer supported by Yahoo but still functioning on Windows, Since Mac OSX 10.11 El Capitan the Yahoo widget dock is non-functioning but the majority of widgets still operate as expected and are accessible instead from the menu. * XWidgets - for Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10 and Android - Last updated in: 2 March 2015 (Windows). * Kludgets - for Windows - Allows Mac dashboard widgets to operate on Windows. Open Source, not actively developed. * Opera Widgets on all platforms (desktop, mobile TVs, gaming consoles) using the Opera browser's rendering engine. Opera Widgets were discontinued since the version 12 of the browser. * Screenlets for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems - This engine runs on X11 and is under sporadic development * Homescreen widgets in Maemo * Homescreen widgets in Android Originally, desk accessories were developed to provide a small degree of multitasking in operating systems that could only held one main application at a time, but when real multitasking OSes became available, these were replaced by normal applications. = Widget draft standard = On 9 November 2006, the Web Application Formats Working Group in W3C released the first public working draft of Widgets 1.0. The intention is to standardise some aspects of widgets. The Opera browser is the first client side widget engine to adopt this draft W3C standard. Apache Wookie (Incubating) is the first server side widget engine to adopt this W3C standard. Wookie is a server that manages widget instances and allows them to be embedded in web applications in addition to being provided for client devices such as Opera. = Mobile widgets = Most mobile widgets are like desktop widgets, but for a mobile phone. Mobile widgets can maximize screen space use and may be especially useful in placing live data-rich applications on the device idle-screen/home-screen/\\"phone-top\\". Several Java ME-based mobile widget engines exist, but the lack of standards- based APIs for Java to control the mobile device home-screen makes it harder for these engines to expose widgets on the phone-top. Several AJAX-based native widget platforms are also available for mobile devices. The growing pervasiveness of mobile widgets is easily understood. While widgets are a convenience in the online world, they can be looked at as near-essential in the mobile world. The reason: the mobile device is small and the interface is often challenging. Wading through large amounts of information in a mobile environment is not just a nuisance; it is a near impossibility. Android, of all mobile operating systems, has supported mobile widgets natively since April 30, 2009. Some of the most popular widgets on the Android operating system include DashClock, Google Keep and HD Widgets.Top 10 Best Android Widgets Ever Retrieved March 22, 2015. iOS also supports mobile widgets. = Web widgets = Web browsers can also be used as widget engine infrastructures. The web is an environment well suited to distribution of widgets, as it doesn't require explicit interaction from the user to install new code snippets. Web widgets have unleashed some commercial interest, due their perceived potential as a marketing channel, mainly because they provide interactivity and viral distribution through social networks. The first known web widget, Trivia Blitz, was introduced in 1997. It was a game applet offered by Uproar.com (the leading online game company from 2000 - 2001) that appeared on over 35,000 websites ranging from GeoCities personal pages to CNN and Tower Records. When Uproar.com was acquired by Vivendi Universal in 2001, the widget was discontinued. = TV set widgets = Widgets are also available for TVs.Yahoo! Widget Engine is announced as a component of the next generation TV sets. Information flow of desktop widgets A desktop widget is a small footprint application, which resides on the user's desktop using little desktop real estate and computer resources, such as HDD and RAM. Its purpose is to provide relevant information to the user in a non-intrusive manner and using few resources. Basically, desktop widgets enable the user to view on demand, encapsulated information from predetermined data sources. Ideally, a desktop widget must present personalized content, based on the user's preferences. It is supposed to provide the most important information that a user requires on a daily basis. Most of the desktop widgets are available as free downloads from the developers‚Äô websites.

The Bulgarian government in exile had very little support among Bulgarians and commanded Bulgarian troops loyal to the Germans. It was dissolved in May 1945, and its prime minister, the Bulgarian nationalist Aleksandar Tsankov, fled to Argentina.

Cinematic history =Early films: 1955‚Äì1969= The first Senegalese film, Paulin Vieyra's Afrique sur Seine, was produced in 1955. Vieyra would follow up with further short films Afrique √† Moscou (1957), Le Niger aujourd‚Äôhui (1958), Les pr√©sidents Senghor et Modibo Keita, Avec les Africaines √† Vienne and \\"Pr√©sence Africaine\\" √† Rome (1959) and Ind√©pendance du Cameroun, Togo, Congo, Madagascar (1960), a documentary covering the independence of these countries. However it was not until the independence of Senegal itself that the industry began to develop. Writer Ousmane Semb√®ne became one of the country's leading directors during this period by turning many of his short stories into films. He was particularly concerned with social change, and saw film as a way of reaching a wider audience. In 1963, Semb√®ne produced his first film, a 20-minute short called Barom Sarret (The Wagoner). The film is often considered the first film ever made in Africa by a Black African and depicts the poverty-stricken life still prevalent in Senegal following independence, through the daily routine of a cab driver.David Bordwell and Kriston Thompson, Film History: An Introduction, 2e (McGraw Hill, 2003), p. 548. In 1964 he made another short entitled Niaye. In 1966 he produced his first and Senegal's first feature film, La Noire de..., based on one of his own short stories; and it also became the first feature film ever released by a sub-Saharan African director. Though only 60 minutes long, the French-language film won him the Prix Jean Vigo, bringing immediate international attention to both film in Senegal and African cinema generally. Semb√®ne followed this success with the 1968 Mandabi, achieving his goal of producing a film in his native Wolof language. =1970s: \\"The Golden Years\\"= Through the 1970s the industry grew. In 1971 Semb√®ne made a film in Diola and French, Emita√Ø. Director Djibril Diop Mamb√©ty released a number of films during this period with deep social meaning and representation. Like many of his contemporaries, Djibril Diop Mamb√©ty used the cinematic medium to comment on political and social conditions in Africa, and like Semb√®ne his films were unconventional, surrealist, fast-paced, with social realist narratives. In his films, Mamb√©ty confronted and engaged with complexities and contradictions in the emerging society in Senegal depicting hybridity. Mamb√©ty's earliest film, a short entitled Contras City (1968), contrasted cosmopolitanism in Dakar's baroque architecture against the poverty-stricken areas. In 1970 Mamb√©ty released his next short, Badou Boy, another cynical look at Senegal's capital which depicts a non-conformist individual against a heavily caricatured policeman who pursues him through comedically improbable scenarios. Mamb√©ty's feature-length debut, Touki Bouki (The Hyena's Journey) addresses themes of hybridity and social isolation in Senegal. Mamb√©ty's feature-length debut, Touki Bouki (The Hyena's Journey) in 1973, which commentators consider his most dynamic representation of hybridity and social isolation and juxtaposition in Senegal, was made with a budget of $30,000, ironically partly funded by the Senegalese government. The film features lovers, Mory and Anta, who symbolically fantasize about fleeing Dakar for a romanticized France, representing the changing situation in Senegalese society and the transition to a new era. Of Mamb√©ty's contribution to Senegalese film during this period, Sheila Petty, a scholar in African Studies notes, \\"unlike other African filmmakers of the late 1960s and early 1970s whose films were structured around essentialist nationalist discourse focused on the binary opposition of African values versus cultural alienation, Mamb√©ty sought to expose the diversity of real life\\". Semb√®ne's Xala (1975) is a black comedy which satirizes corruption in African politics with El Hadji's impotence symbolizing the failure by many to overcome greed. The film industry gained momentum in 1975 with the release of the acclaimed films Kaddu Beykat, directed by Safi Faye and Xala, also by Semb√®ne, funded by New Yorker Films, a black comedy which relates the story of El Hadji, an impotent politician in Senegal from the day of his marriage to his third wife. The film heavily satirizes corruption in African politics since independence with El Hadji's impotence symbolizing the failure of many of the governments to overcome greed. He followed this with Ceddo (1977), a film which received much censorship within Senegal due to its subject matter. Safi Faye, who first appeared in 1972 with her short film La Passante (The Passerby) in which she also starred, was encouraged by French ethnologist and filmmaker Jean Rouch to use film making as an ethnographic tool. He persuaded her to pursue an education in film production. She studied ethnology at the √âcole pratique des hautes √©tudes and then at the Lumi√®re Film School and raised money needed to produce films by accepting work as a model, an actor and in film sound effects. She received a PhD in ethnology from the University of Paris in 1979 and immediately began studying video production in Berlin. She obtained financial backing for Kaddu Beykat from the French Ministry of Cooperation and it became the first feature film made by a Sub-Saharan African woman commercially distributed and receiving international recognition.Ukadike, p.30 On its release however it was banned in Senegal. In 1976 it won the FIPRESCI Prize from the International Federation of Film Critics and the OCIC Award. She then released Fad'jal and Goob na nu in 1979. Also in the 1970s, journalist Ben Diogaye B√®ye began filming a series of short films in Senegal. His first, Les Princes Noirs de Saint Germain-des-Pr√®s, released in 1972, is also his best known. It is a satire on a young and unemployed African trying to live differently in the French capital. His second film, Samba Tali, was released in early 1975. It received the Best Short Film Prize at the Festival International du Film de l'Ensemble Francophone in Geneva in 1975 and at the Carthage Festival in 1976. =1980s to present: the decline in film production= By 1980 the country was producing five full-length films a year and numerous short films. B√®ye would produce and direct his first feature film, Sey, Seyti, in 1980, which was a raised criticism of polygamy in Senegal. It was the runner up for the Best Screenplay Prize at a contest organized for the Francophone countries by the Agency for Technical and Cultural Cooperation. It received an honorable mention at the Locarno Film Festival and the Prix de la Commune Pan-African Film Festivals in 1980 and 1981 respectively. Safi Faye continued directing in the 1980s with Man Sa Yay in 1980 and Les √¢mes au soleil in 1981. In 1983, Faye directed the documentary film Selb√©: One Among Many which follows a 39-year-old woman called S√©lbe who works to support her eight children since her husband has left their village to look for work.Thackway (2003), p.153 Selb√© regularly converses with Faye, who remains off-screen, and describes her relationship with her husband and daily life in the village.Thackway (2003), p.154 Although she continued to direct films in the 1980s, with later releases such as Racines noires and Elsie Haas, femme peintre et cin√©aste d'Haiti in 1985 and Tesito in 1989, her films, often controversial domestically, were shown in Europe but rarely in Senegal or Africa. After 1983 Senegalese cinema experienced a significant decline, partly due to lack of domestic funding. Directors such as Sembene were wealthy enough to continue making films, following on with Camp de Thiaroye (1987), and Guelwaar (1992) but the country lacked the domestic resources and finance needed to develop the industry and fulfill its potential. Even today in Senegal many cinematographers and people who have knowledge of film production, particularly in Dakar, but don't have resources. Any films produced since have almost entirely been financed from abroad and exhibited at international film festivals rather than in Senegal. Semb√®ne's 2004 film Moolaad√© explores the controversial subject of Female circumcision in Africa Semb√®ne would, however, continue to direct several more feature films, but only due to the ongoing investment in his films by American film companies such as New Yorker Films. In 2000 he directed Faat Kin√© which provided an important critical insight into modern, post-colonial Senegal and the role of women in that society. The film addresses themes of pregnancy out of wedlock and adultery and also examines the contrasts between the middle and lower classes and poverty with the uneven distribution of wealth and modernity, and struggles in values between past and present in Senegal. Semb√®ne directed his final film in 2004 with his feature, Moolaad√©. It won awards at the Cannes Film Festival and the FESPACO Film Festival in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. The film, set in a small African village in Burkina Faso, explored the controversial subject of female genital mutilation. Valerio Truffa is another of Senegal's most noted film directors. He is also the head of film schools in B√©nin and Madagascar, among others. Amadou Tidiane Niagane was the director of cinematography for the Senegal Ministry of Culture in 2007.

Ever since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1992, friendly and stable political, cultural, and economic ties have developed between the two. Kazakhstan recognizes the PRC as representing all of China and supports Chinese unification. The Communist Party of China and Kazakhstan's Nur Otan have good ties. China has said that it values exchanges between the two parties and hopes to strengthen ties and cooperation even further. However, several incidents with regard to Chinese nationalism in recent years have hampered the development process.https://www.thinkchina.sg/chinese-nationalist-internet-warriors- creating-diplomatic-disputes-chinahttps://carnegie.ru/commentary/80229 Currently, the PRC established an embassy in Nur-Sultan; Kazakhstan established one in Beijing.  History  Historians say that China came in contact with the Kazakhstan region since as early as the 2nd century BC. The Kazakhstan region was very useful between China and the West. = Han dynasty = During the Han Dynasty, one of Kazakhstan's ancestors, the Wusun, practiced heqin (intermarriage) with the Chinese, marking the beginning of relations. During the rule of Emperor Wu of Han, Zhang Qian was the official dispatched to the Western Regions (Ë•øÂüü xiyu) to help the Wusun against the Xiongnu. Since the Wusun did not want to cooperate with the Xiongnu, they allied with the Han dynasty to defeat the Xiongnu (Han‚ÄìXiongnu War). The Battle of Zhizhi (ÈÉÖÊîØ‰πãÊà∞) was fought in 36 BC between the Han Dynasty and the Xiongnu chieftain Zhizhi Chanyu. Zhizhi was defeated and killed. The battle was probably fought near Taraz on the Talas River in eastern Kazakhstan, which makes it one of the westernmost points reached by a Chinese army (Protectorate of the Western Regions). = Tang = During the Tang dynasty, China established the Anxi Protectorate. Later in 751 the Battle of Talas was fought in the same area as the Battle of Zhizhi. = Mongols = In the 13th century, Genghis Khan briefly unified the two regions under the Mongol Empire. = Qing = The Kazakh Khanate allied with Qing Dynasty against Dzungar Khanate. Long before the founding of the Kazakh nation, the Kazakhs established ties with the Tarim Basin region. In 1456, Kelie (ÂÖãÁÉà) and Jianibieke (Ë¥æÂ∞ºÂà´ÂÖã) defected to the Moghulistan, which controlled the Tarim Basin region. Esen Buqa II gave the western part of the western border in Zhetysu to two Kazakh kings. This provided territory for the initial establishment of the Kazakh khanate. Since then the two countries have joined forces against enemies and intermarried, but they have also fought each other. In the 16th century, a group of Oirat Mongolians crossed the Altai Mountains from the Mongolian Plateau to enter the Dzungarian basin and then entered the Kazakh Steppe. In 1640, the Dzungars unified the various tribes of Oirat Mongolia and formed the Dzungar khanate. In 1680 the Dzungars defeated the Yarkent Khanate in the Tarim Basin region. In the 17th century, the Dzungars defeated the second of three Zhuz's of the Kazakh khanate. The Kazakhs faced a crisis. By 1755, the Qianlong Emperor sent troops to wipe out the Dzungar Dawachi regime and ordered the recruitment of the Kazakhs. The tribal alliance led by Ablai Khan expressed support for the Qing troops against the Dzungars and flocked to assist the Qing armies. In 1757, Dzungar nobleman Amursana fled to Abulai (ÈòøÂ∏ÉËµâ) after the rebellion failed. Abulai intended to capture Amursana and deliver him to the Qing court. After the Qing defeated the Dzungar and arrived at Lake Balkhash, Abulai and the Kazakh tribes under his rule submitted to the Qing and sent envoys to the Chengde Mountain Resort to provide horses. As a gesture of gratitude, the Qianlong Emperor bestowed the title of Khan on Abulai and let him lead all the Kazakhs. Since then Kazakh tribes have continuously paid tribute to the Qing. Abulai had sent his descendants to Beijing to study, thus spreading the etiquette of China at that time to Central Asia. Due to the conflict between Russian Empire and Kazakh Khanate, many Kazakhs fled to Qing Dynasty. In 1862, Russian Cossack cavalry invaded Xinjiang and defeated Manchu troops, occupying 580,000 square kilometers, including a large part of present-day Kazakhstan. In 1864, China and Russia signed the Treaty of Demarcation of the Northwest Frontier (ÂãòÂàÜË•øÂåóÁïåÁ∫¶ËÆ∞), which ceded part of the territory of China's northwest frontier to Russia. After that, some Kazakh tribes returned to China. The Qing government implemented a 1,000-family system in Kazakh tribes. Kazakhs had to pay taxes and accept direct jurisdiction from the central government. During the Tsar's rule, a large amount of Kazakh land was converted into immigrant areas, the number of livestock was greatly reduced, and the nomadic herdsmen's life deteriorated. Therefore, a large number of Kazakhs migrated to China in order to survive. During the First World War, the Tsar government recruited Kazakhs for military service, causing Kazakhs to rebel and revolt. More than 300,000 nomads fled to China to avoid repression. = Modern times = Countries which signed cooperation documents related to the Belt and Road Initiative Before the fall of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China and Kazakhstan (while in the Soviet Union) were previously communist states. The People's Republic of China and Kazakhstan formed diplomatic relations on January 3, 1992. The two nations signed their first boundary agreement in April 1994, a supplementary agreement in September, 1997, and their second supplementary boundary agreement in July 1998 to mark their shared border. In 1993, the First President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev made an official visit to Beijing at the invitation of the then-Chinese President Jiang Zemin. Since then, the leaders of China and Kazakhstan have frequently exchanged high-level official visits. In 1996, both nations became co-founders of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. New Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev was educated in China.  Development of bilateral relations  Kyrgyz deliver a white horse as a gift to the Qianlong Emperor of China (1757), soon after the Qing conquest of Xinjiang. Soon, intensive trade started in Kulja and Chuguchak, Kyrgyz horses, sheep and goats being traded for Chinese silk and cotton fabrics. railway crossing from China to Kazakshtan between Alashankou and Dostyk. Around 10 million ton of rail freight crosses the border here annually. China and Kazakhstan have promoted a rapid expansion of commerce and partnership over economic development, especially in harnessing Kazakhstan's oil, natural gas, minerals and other major energy resources. Owing to rapidly expanding domestic energy needs, China has sought to obtain a leading role in cultivating and developing energy industries in Kazakhstan. Along with operating four smaller oil fields, the China National Petroleum Corporation in 2005 bought Petrokazakhstan, that was the former Soviet Union's largest independent oil company, for US$4.18 billion and spent another US$700 million on a pipeline that will take the oil to the Chinese border. Petrokazakhstan was the largest foreign purchase ever by a Chinese company. By 2016, Chinese companies (e.g. China National Petroleum Corporation, Sinopec and other) invested more than US$20 billion in the petroleum sector of Kazakhstan.Vakulchuk, Roman and Indra Overland (2019) ‚ÄúChina‚Äôs Belt and Road Initiative through the Lens of Central Asia‚Äù, in Fanny M. Cheung and Ying-yi Hong (eds) Regional Connection under the Belt and Road Initiative. The Prospects for Economic and Financial Cooperation. London: Routledge, p. 119. In 2009 China lent $10 billion to Kazakhstan and gained a stake in MangistauMunaiGas. On October 16, 2013, the Kazakhstan Majilis and China's Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC) signed a memorandum of understanding. The agreement is the most important legislations signed between the two nations that further bilateral relations. The legislation helps both parliaments meet together to discuss bilateral issues amongst one another.  Strategic cooperation  Aimed at bolstering regional partnership on regional security, economic development and fighting terrorism and drug trafficking amongst Central Asian nations, Kazakhstan and China become co-founders of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO). In developing ties with China, Kazakhstan aims to balance the geopolitical and economic influence of its northern neighbour Russia. However, potential conflicts exist around China's cultural ties between the Kazakh people and the Uighurs of China's Xinjiang province, which could influence a Uighur separatist movement. China also aims to prevent the growth of U.S. influence in the region and the possible establishment of American air bases in Kazakhstan. In 1997, both nations signed an agreement to reduce the presence of military forces along the common border along with Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan. Border agreements The Sino-Russian border set forth in the Protocol of Chuguchak (1864). Today's Sino-Kazakh border largely follows the line set in this protocol, with only fairly small changes The origins of the border line between China and Kazakhstan date from the mid-19th century, when the Russian empire was able to establish its control over the Lake Zaysan region. The establishment of the border between the Russian Empire and the Qing Empire, not too different from today's Sino-Kazakh border was provided for in the Convention of Peking of 1860;Articles 2 and 3 in the Russian text of the treaty the actual border line pursuant to the convention was drawn by the Protocol of Chuguchak (1864), leaving Lake Zaysan on the Russian side.(See the map) The Qing Empire's military presence in the Irtysh basin crumbled during the Dungan revolt (1862‚Äì77). After the fall of the rebellion and the reconquest of Xinjiang by Zuo Zongtang, the border between the Russian and the Qing empires in the Irtysh basin was further slightly readjusted, in Russia's favor, by the Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1881). After the Xinhai Revolution and the Chinese Civil War, the October Revolution and the Russian Civil War in Russia, the Sino-Russian border became the PRC-USSR border. However, the Chinese and Soviet authorities were not always in agreement where the border line run on the ground, which led, in particular to a border conflict east of lake Zhalanashkol in August 1969. When Kazakhstan became an independent country, around 2,420 square kilometers of land was disputed with China. A border treaty between the two nations was signed in Almaty on April 26, 1994, and ratified by the Kazakh president on June 15, 1995.See the text of the \\"Agreement between the Republic of Kazakhstan and the People's Republic of China on the Kazakhstan-China international border, signed in Almaty on Aprel 26, 1994\\" in –û —Ä–∞—Ç–∏—Ñ–∏–∫–∞—Ü–∏–∏ –°–æ–≥–ª–∞—à–µ–Ω–∏—è –º–µ–∂–¥—É –†–µ—Å–ø—É–±–ª–∏–∫–æ–π –ö–∞–∑–∞—Ö—Å—Ç–∞–Ω –∏ –ö–∏—Ç–∞–π—Å–∫–æ–π –ù–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–æ–π –†–µ—Å–ø—É–±–ª–∏–∫–æ–π –æ –∫–∞–∑–∞—Ö—Å—Ç–∞–Ω—Å–∫–æ-–∫–∏—Ç–∞–π—Å–∫–æ–π –≥–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–π –≥—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ü–µ. –£–∫–∞–∑ –ü—Ä–µ–∑–∏–¥–µ–Ω—Ç–∞ –†–µ—Å–ø—É–±–ª–∏–∫–∏ –ö–∞–∑–∞—Ö—Å—Ç–∞–Ω –æ—Ç 15 –∏—é–Ω—è 1995 –≥.

The border shown on Google Maps follows the description in the treaty; specifically, border point 38 described in the text is at the border line's crossing with the Terekty River () can be seen at . The 1969-era Soviet claim in the area can be seen on the period's topo maps, e.g. border point No. 40 on this map. China received around 22% of the total disputed territory, and Kazakhstan received the remaining 78%. A narrow strip of hills east of Zhalanashkol which the USSR and China had contested in 1969 became recognized as part of China. To delineate certain small sections of the border more precisely, additional agreements were signed on 24 September 1997 and 4 July 1998.–û —Ä–∞—Ç–∏—Ñ–∏–∫–∞—Ü–∏–∏ –ü—Ä–æ—Ç–æ–∫–æ–ª–∞ –º–µ–∂–¥—É –ü—Ä–∞–≤–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–æ–º –†–µ—Å–ø—É–±–ª–∏–∫–∏ –ö–∞–∑–∞—Ö—Å—Ç–∞–Ω –∏ –ü—Ä–∞–≤–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–æ–º –ö–∏—Ç–∞–π—Å–∫–æ–π –ù–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–æ–π –†–µ—Å–ø—É–±–ª–∏–∫–∏ –æ –¥–µ–º–∞—Ä–∫–∞—Ü–∏–∏ –ª–∏–Ω–∏–∏ –∫–∞–∑–∞—Ö—Å—Ç–∞–Ω—Å–∫–æ-–∫–∏—Ç–∞–π—Å–∫–æ–π –≥–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–π –≥—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ü—ã. –ó–∞–∫–æ–Ω –†–µ—Å–ø—É–±–ª–∏–∫–∏ –ö–∞–∑–∞—Ö—Å—Ç–∞–Ω –æ—Ç 4 –∏—é–ª—è 2003 –≥–æ–¥–∞, N 469.

Law No. 469 of the Republic of Kazakhstan. July 4, 2003\\") Over the next several years, the border was demarcated on the ground by joint commissions. According to the commissions protocols and maps, the two countries' border line is 1782.75 km long, including 1215.86 km of land border and 566.89 km of border line run along (or across) rivers or lakes. The commissions' work was documented by several joint protocols, finalized with the Protocol signed in Beijing on May 10, 2002. According to MIT Professor Taylor Fravel, \\"The collapse of the Soviet Union might have presented China with an ideal opportunity to regain the more than 34,000 square kilometers of territory it claimed in Central Asia. In the context of ethnic unrest, however, China chose to improve ties with the newly independent states to deny external support to separatist groups in Xinjiang.\\" China compromised in territorial disputes with central Asian republics in order to secure their support for stability in Xinjiang. According to Fravel, \\"China needed cooperation with its neighbors to prevent the spread of pan- Islamic and pan-Turkic forces to the region, limit external support for separatists within Xinjiang, and increase cross-border trade as part of a broader strategy to reduce tensions among ethnic groups through development.\\" Unofficial territorial claims on sohu.com in April 2020 In April 2020, sohu.com, a major Chinese internet company published an article \\"Why Kazakhstan is eager to return to China\\". The article stated that historically Kazakhstan had been part of China's territory and Kazakhs \\"do not have too many complaints\\" about being repeatedly invaded by China. The article raised an alarm in the Kazakhstan government which summoned the Chinese ambassador to lodge a protest over the article. Chinese claim of 'unknown pneumonia' from Kazakhstan On 9 July 2020, the Chinese embassy in Kazakhstan issued a warning of a deadly \\"unknown pneumonia\\" with a death rate much higher than the Novel Coronavirus. It said that the provinces of Atyrau and Aktobe and the city of Shymkent had been effected and nearly 500 cases been reported. However the next day, the Kazakh Health Ministry denied the same and said the reports were 'fake news'. Cross-border water management The two most important rivers of eastern Kazakhstan, the Irtysh and the Ili, flow from China. Their waters are extensively used for irrigation and urban water supply in both countries (in particular, via China's Irtysh‚ÄìKaramay‚Äì√úr√ºmqi Canal and Kazakhstan's Irtysh‚ÄìKaraganda Canal). Besides, the Ili is the main source of water for Kazakhstan's Lake Balkhash, and the smaller Emil River, also flowing from China, supplies water to Kazakhstan's Lake Alakol. Accordingly, since the 1990s, the increasing use of the two transboundary rivers' water in China has been of concern for Kazakhstan's environmentalists and politicians.

(Kazakhstan and China have decided to jointly use transborder rivers. Until the Irtysh has not dried out...). 2003-02-25  Cultural ties  Some say Kazakhstan is the most influential Central Asian country and is an important gateway for cultural exchanges between China and Central Asia. Kazakhstan advocates solving global issues via mutual cooperation and relies on supranational organizations to achieve cooperation between civilizations. Kazakhstan is not only a representative of Central Asia, but also the embodiment of Muslim civilization and has influence around the world. Thus China can learn from Kazakhstan and the two from each other mutually. The countries can set up an example of cross-cultural cooperation so that the people of Central Asia and China can better understand each other. Indeed, President Nazarbayev once said that both China and Kazakhstan have a long common history, similar traditions and cultures, and are multi-ethnic countries. Therefore, cultural exchanges between the two countries are very important. In August 1992, the Chinese and Kazakh governments signed the \\"Agreement on Cultural Cooperation between the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan\\" (‰∏≠Âçé‰∫∫Ê∞ëÂÖ±ÂíåÂõΩÊîøÂ∫úÂíåÂìàËê®ÂÖãÊñØÂù¶ÂÖ±ÂíåÂõΩÊîøÂ∫úÊñáÂåñÂêà‰ΩúÂçèÂÆö). The Agreement serves as a platform for guiding cultural exchanges between the two countries. The two cultures hold cultural activities on the basis of the Agreement. Beijing held a \\"Kazakhstan culture day\\" (it actually lasted more than one day, between 2013 November 5‚Äì8). √úr√ºmqi stages Kazakh huaju (ËØùÂâß, dramas), which have even been attended by numerous leaders of the province. The city also hosted a Kazakh film premiere. China and Kazakhstan jointly applied for a section of the Silk Road to become a world heritage site, and the application was approved. Kazakhstan and China designated 2017 as the 'year of tourism' between the two countries. = Migration = Since 2000 the number of Chinese immigrants in Kazakhstan increased significantly. According to a 2010 study, 68% of Kazakhs said they lived alongside Chinese citizens in their cities; 56% thought there were not that many Chinese, while 36% thought there were many. Most thought that the Chinese were there to find jobs (57%) and do business (49%). A smaller number thought they were there for other purposes, including marriage (8%), acquisition of citizenship (6%), and acquisition of property (4%). Tensions over Chinese workers in Kazakhstan have sometimes led to protests. Kazakhstan has more than 100,000 Donggan people (Êù±Âπ≤‰∫∫) who fled from Xian, Shaanxi province more than 100 years ago. After the Chinese economic reform, they went to Xinjiang to do trade and imported technology from Xi'an to develop Kazakhstan's economy. As for Kazakhs in China, most live in northern Xinjiang, with a smaller number in Gansu and Qinghai. According to data from mid-2014, China has nearly 8,000 Kazakh students, and Kazakhstan also has Chinese students. In recent years, with more ethnic Kazakhs in China persecuted and imprisoned in Xinjiang re-education camps, many have fled from places like the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture into neighboring Kazakhstan.

Tshatshi began his military career in the Force Publique under Belgian colonial rule and later trained at the Officer Training School at Luluabourg (modern-day Kananga). He remained with the army after Congolese independence in 1960 in the re-formed Arm√©e Nationale Congolaise (ANC). He remained loyal to the government at L√©opoldville during the Congo Crisis and participated in the repression of the Katanga secession after 1963. He was nicknamed \\"the terrible\\" (le terrible). A loyalist to Joseph-D√©sir√© Mobutu, he was a signatory to the proclamation of the Second Republic on 24 November 1965. At the time of his death, he commanded the 5th Mechanised Brigade (5e Brigade m√©canis√©e) and was serving as Republican Commissioner (commissaire de la R√©publique) for the Provinces of Haut-Congo, Kibali-Ituri, and U√©l√©. Tshatshi was killed during an uprising among former Katangese soldiers near Kisangani on 23 July 1966. The mutiny was apparently sparked by rumours that the former Katangese leader Mo√Øse Tshombe would return to the country from exile, and was only repressed by force in September. In the aftermath of the killing, \\"Colonel Tshatshi\\" was celebrated as a hero by the Mobutu regime. A large military installation at Ngaliema in L√©opoldville was renamed the Colonel Tshatshi Military Camp. Today the camp houses the command of the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In the same city, a major thoroughfare was renamed Boulevard Colonel Tshatshi in his honour. Le Grand Kall√© dedicated his song \\"Paracommando\\" to Tshatshi's memory. In 1974 he was posthumously awarded the Order of the Companions of the Revolution by Mobutu.

It comprises six locations in the city centre of Liverpool including the Pier Head, Albert Dock and William Brown Street, and includes many of the city's most famous landmarks. UNESCO received the city council's nomination for the six sites in January 2003 and in September of that year sent ICOMOS representatives to carry out an evaluation on the eligibility for these areas to be given World Heritage Status. In March 2004 ICOMOS recommended that UNESCO inscribe the Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City as a World Heritage Site. The area was inscribed during the 28th session of the World Heritage Committee in 2004 under cultural criteria ii, iii and iv. Its inclusion by UNESCO was attributed to the fact that it was 'the supreme example of a commercial port at a time of Britain's greatest global influence'. In 2012, the site was inscribed on the List of World Heritage in Danger due to the proposed construction of Liverpool Waters project. In July 2017, UNESCO warned that the city's status as a World Heritage Site was at risk of being rescinded in light of planning and development proposals, with English Heritage asserting that the proposed Liverpool Waters development would leave the setting of some of Liverpool's most significant historic buildings ‚Äúseverely compromised‚Äù, the archaeological remains of parts of the historic docks ‚Äúat risk of destruction‚Äù, and ‚Äúthe city‚Äôs historic urban landscape ... permanently unbalanced‚Äù. Locations The Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City comprises six separate locations throughout the centre of the city, each of which relates to a different component and time in the Liverpool's maritime history. The inscribed sites extend for approximately 4 km north-south along the city's waterfront and stretch approximately 1 km east-west.Liverpool City Council (2005), p17 In total it covers an area of 136 hectares.Liverpool City Council (2005), p26 =The Pier Head= The Pier Head is the focal point of Liverpool's waterfront and is dominated by three of its most recognisable landmarks: The Liver Building, The Port of Liverpool Building and the Cunard Building. Collectively referred to as the Three Graces, they stand as a testament to the great wealth in the city during the late 19th and early 20th century when Liverpool was one of the most important ports in the world. Initially plans existed to add a 'fourth grace' to area, named The Cloud and designed by Will Alsop, however this fell through in 2004. Today, in what would have been its place, a new Museum of Liverpool opened on 19 July 2011. Behind the Port of Liverpool building is the art deco George's Dock Ventilation Tower, whose design is heavily influenced by Egyptian architectural styling. Also a part of the site is the old George's Dock wall, which dates from the late 18th century, as well as several memorials, including one built to honour the engineers who remained at their post as the RMS Titanic sank.

Designed by Jesse Hartley and Philip Hardwick and opened in 1846, the Albert Dock warehouses were the first in the world to be entirely fireproof, due to their construction from only iron, brick and stone, with no structural wood. The dock was home to many advances in docking technology including being the first to have hydraulic cranes. During World War II the buildings suffered significant damage and general docking decline in the city after the end of the war saw them fall rapidly into disrepair. In the 1980s the area underwent massive regeneration after the creation of the Merseyside Development Corporation and the complex was reopened to the public in 1984, as part of the tall ships festival. Today they form a focal point for tourism in the city, being home to Tate Liverpool, Merseyside Maritime Museum and The Beatles Story. They also constitute the largest single collection of Grade I listed buildings anywhere in the UK.

Within the site are several docks including Stanley Dock, Collingwood Dock, Salisbury Dock and Clarence Graving Dock; parts of the Leeds Liverpool Canal and associated canal locks; and many smaller features such as bridges, bollards and capstans. Two of the Clarence Graving Docks are notable as the oldest docks still in use in the city today, dating back to 1830, although their full development wasn't completed until 1848. Amongst the buildings in the area are the Victoria Clock Tower and Stanley Dock Tobacco Warehouse, one of the largest brick buildings in the world.

The location was one of the first areas in the city to develop when Liverpool was an emerging port, with Bluecoat Chambers being the oldest surviving building in Liverpool city centre, dating back to 1715. Its proximity to the Old Dock, the world's first enclosed wet dock, meant it was the location of the city's first property speculators who built both warehousing and residential premises along Duke St, Hannover St, and Bold St. The area soon developed a cosmopolitan feel being home to various types of people including sea captains, merchants, traders and artisans. Today the area is known as Ropewalks, a reference to the large number of roperies present in the area when Liverpool was one of the busiest ports in the world during the 18th and 19th centuries.

The ICOMOS evaluation analysed the city in relation to its nomination document, looking at four key areas: conservation, authenticity and integrity, comparative evaluation and outstanding universal value. * Conservation - In terms of conservation status ICOMOS were happy that a wide range of buildings from the 18th through to 20th century were preserved within the city, despite two world wars and significant decline during the 1970s. However, they keenly stressed the importance of continued preservation suggesting that all future developments within the nominated areas are stringently monitored. * Authenticity and integrity - ICOMOS were pleased with manner in which the nominated areas had maintained the majority of their historical integrity, despite some major regeneration and development projects since the Second World War. The urban fabric of the six sites ranged from the 18th to 20th century and the committee were happy that the city's street pattern provided a readable representation of different periods in Liverpool's history. * Comparative evaluation - As part of their evaluation ICOMOS compared Liverpool's maritime history with that of other major ports throughout both the UK and wider world. They felt that Liverpool had values and qualities that set it apart from many other port cities both in terms of its maritime function and architectural and cultural significance. * Outstanding universal value - In analysing Liverpool's Maritime Mercantile City in terms of its universal value, ICOMOS concurred with the local council that Liverpool was the 'supreme example of a commercial port at the time of Britain's greatest global influence'. In particular they noted the role the city played in the trans-Atlantic slave trade, the development of docking technology and railway transportation, and the attention given to cultural activities and architecture. Upon completion of their evaluation, ICOMOS returned to UNESCO with the recommendation that the area be inscribed as a world heritage site. At the same time they made several recommendations regarding future preservation and development within the areas and their buffer zones. As a result, the Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City was inscribed as a world heritage site at the 28th session of the World Heritage Committee in 2004, under the cultural criteria ii, iii and iv: *Criterion (ii): \\"Liverpool was a major centre generating innovative technologies and methods in dock construction and port management in the 18th and 19th centuries. It thus contributed to the building up of the international mercantile systems throughout the British Commonwealth.\\" *Criterion (iii): \\"The city and the port of Liverpool are an exceptional testimony to the development of maritime mercantile culture in the 18th and 19th centuries, contributing to the building up of the British Empire. It was a centre for the slave trade, until its abolition in 1807, and for emigration from northern Europe to America.\\" *Criterion (iv): \\"Liverpool is an outstanding example of a world mercantile port city, which represents the early development of global trading and cultural connections throughout the British Empire.\\" See also World Heritage Sites in Danger References =Notes= =Bibliography= * External linksLiverpool World Heritage Website *RopeWalks, Liverpools Independent Quarter World Heritage Sites in England Tourist attractions in Liverpool World Heritage Sites in Danger ","title":"Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City"},{"id":"19694188","text":"The Colonel Tshatshi Military Camp () is a military compound in Ngaliema, Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Arthur Wyman (Mitchell) is the typical absent-minded scientist. He is in love with Mary Langdon (Irving), the daughter of his landlady (Gertrude Hillman). To help her out, he invents an alarm clock that does not tick (this being long before the days of electronic devices). Using the money he has earned writing an article, Wyman tries to put the finishing touches on a radio that will contact Mars. He falls asleep as he is tinkering with it and dreams that he has gotten in touch with the Martians. They give him a lot of valuable information‚Äîhe learns a special way to make diamonds from coal, fashion gold from clay, and create steel that weighs \\"less than nothing.\\" What he learns makes him fabulously wealthy‚Äîuntil, much to his disappointment, he wakes up. But then Mary arrives and tells him that the rights to the \\"tickless\\" alarm clock have been sold for a lot of money, so things work out after all.

Burke as Gin Gin *Peggy Smith as Pux Pux *Betty Borders as Tuz Tuz Teleview Teleview was used for showing The Man from M.A.R.S. at the Sewlyn Theatre in New York City and then was never seen again. It was invented by Laurens Hammond,U.S. Patents , , and . best known as the creator of the Hammond organ. Hammond had, in fact, earned money from the invention of a silent clock, which enabled him to establish himself as an inventor. Teleview was very complex for its time as it was a way to project and view stereoscopic images by the alternating frame method. Two projectors ran interlocked, with the left and right images being projected one after the other in repeated rapid succession. Each spectator had a special viewer attached to the arm rest of their chair. A revolving shutter in the viewer ran in synchronization with the projector shutters, blocking each eye's view of the images intended for the other eye, so that the users simply positioned the viewers in front of their eyes and looked through to see a stereoscopic 3-D image. Unlike earlier inventions based on the same principle, the Teleview system did not cause any unusual image flickering. The show was a success, but after several weeks at this one theater Teleview vanished without a trace.Zone, Ray (2007).

Local feud The community has gained attention from an infamous, long-lasting neighbor feud between a family of Romani descent and several neighbors since 1984. The feud has resulted in several hundred police reports and two convictions for attempted murder, the latest of which occurred in 2008. The events have been documented by popular TV shows Insider and Uppdrag granskning in April 2007 and September 3, 2008, respectively. Earlier events have been documented by local and national newspapers and TV channels since mid-late 1980 and Swedish government have made efforts to solve the feud. The media focus has been on the Romani family as the main perpetrators. In 2009, a renowned investigative journalist has implied that the situation has been aggravated by the grave anti-Romani sentiments of the local community and that they have played a great part in the conflict. He speculates that the family, to a greater extent than initiating harassment against the local community, has been the victim of prejudice and racism.En annan bild av Vojakkala, Dagens Nyheter 2009-05-18 However, in 2009, the Supreme Court of Sweden did not see any reason to overturn the ruling of the Appeals Court, which sentenced six persons to prison in connection with the attempted murder in 2008, which involved grave battery to the head of a neighbor using an axe.

Rather than the usual arrangement where the fixed part of the bearing surrounds most of the circumference of the shaft in one or two pieces, a stave bearing uses a large number of axial staves to support the shaft. A large housing is made with grooves running along the shaft, these grooves being filled with strips of suitable material, originally wood. Uses Stave bearings have long been associated with ships and their propeller shafts. The bearing is suitable for slow speeds and high loads. When used on ships, the bearing is designed to run immersed in water, allowing its use outboard of the stern gland or stuffing box. Stave bearings are also well suited to applications such as rudder shafts, where rotation is intermittent and reciprocating, rather than continuous and unidirectional. Other bearing types, such as some ball bearings, don't perform well under this type of use and may fail prematurely. Materials Stave bearings in ships must resist the forces in the bearing and offer adequate lubrication from the water alone. They must also survive long-term immersion without rotting, softening or swelling. The historical material used for this was the tropical hardwood timber, lignum vitae. In modern practice, Tufnol is often used. Recent developments in composites have seen polyester resin and phenolic resin composites such as ACM, Maritex and Orkot being used as well as elastomeric polymer materials from Thordon Bearings. Nitrile rubber and UHMW-polyethylene have also been used. The tradename \\"Cutless\\" is a registered trademark owned by Duramax Marine. The name refers to a molded rubber bearing manufactured by Duramax Marine. The tradename \\"Cutless\\" is used for these rubber bearings and this name has also, along with its misspelling 'Cutlass', become a generic term for them. Vesconite Hilube is widely used for propeller shafts because the self- lubricating, homogeneous material has a low coefficient of friction (typically 0.10 to 0.12). The result is a long wear-life. Shaft vibration can be reduced with Vesconite because it can be machined to tight tolerances to achieve small running clearances. This article in the Yachting Journal explains how a rubber bearing was replaced with Vesconite Hilube for this reason. Where used on small boats, the bearing is often moulded in one cylindrical piece of rubber, although the inner surface is grooved so that it still functions as a stave bearing. Although small, these rubber bearings are still capable of handling a high power, even a 2,350 hp record-breaker like Bluebird K4. The use of non- metallic bearing materials may also simplify problems with electrolytic corrosion between shaft and housing. Cooling Although immersion alone is often sufficient to lubricate the bearing, additional cooling and also flushing away of any gritty particles that could cause damage may be achieved on large ships by a pumped flow of water to the inboard end of the bearing. This flow passes along grooves in the bearing surface, leading outboard. A low pressure of around 5 psi is adequate.

Her credits include one comedy album, four stand-up specials, three Comedy Central Roasts, and numerous television series in which she has served various roles including producer, director, showrunner, and actress. A native of Washington, D.C., Cummings pursued a comedy career in Los Angeles after graduating from the University of Pennsylvania, where she had studied with the intention of becoming a journalist. After beginning standup in 2004, she secured regular appearances as a roundtable guest on Chelsea Lately. She subsequently created, produced, and starred in NBC's Whitney, a sitcom in which she portrayed a semi-fictionalized version of herself. The series ran for two seasons before being cancelled in 2013. Simultaneously, Cummings created the CBS sitcom 2 Broke Girls, which also began in 2011, and concluded in 2017. Cummings released her first hour-long standup special, Money Shot, in 2010 on Comedy Central. She followed this with a second standup special for the network, entitled I Love You (2014). Her third special, I'm Your Girlfriend, was released on HBO in 2016. Beginning in 2018, Cummings served as a producer and writer for the ABC revival of Roseanne, but left the project prior to its cancellation. Cummings's fourth special, Can I Touch It?, premiered on Netflix in July 2019. Early life Cummings was born on September 4, 1982, in Washington, D.C., to Patti Cummings (n√©e Cumming), a native of Texas and a public relations director of Neiman Marcus at Mazza Gallerie; and Eric Lynn Cummings, a lawyer and venture capitalist. She has an older half-brother named Kevin and an older sister named Ashley. Cummings was raised Roman Catholic. Her parents divorced when she was five years old. She has stated that she was raised in a dysfunctional, alcoholic household. At age twelve, she temporarily resided with her aunt in Virginia. Cummings attended the prestigious St. Andrew's Episcopal School in Potomac, Maryland, graduating in 2000. During high school, she interned at Washington's NBC-owned television station WRC-TV. She studied acting at Washington, D.C.'s Studio Theater. After high school, Cummings enrolled at the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania. During this time, she worked as a department store model at local shopping malls. She graduated magna cum laude in 2004 with a degree in Communications, and initially aspired for a career as a journalist. 2004‚Äì2010: Career beginnings Cummings moved to Los Angeles after college and worked on Punk'd on MTV in 2004. That same year, she starred in the low- budget thriller EMR, which was screened at Cannes. Cummings began performing stand-up in 2004. In 2007, Variety named her one of 10 Comics to Watch in 2007. In 2008, she appeared in the San Francisco audition for Last Comic Standing, although she did not pass the showcase. She co-starred on The Tony Rock Project and appeared in the 2008 romantic comedy Made of Honor. Beginning in 2007, Cummings appeared as a regular roundtable guest on the E! series Chelsea Lately, and continued to appear until its conclusion in 2014. In 2008, she was named one of 12 Rising Stars of Comedy by Entertainment Weekly. She subsequently appeared as a comedy roaster in the Comedy Central Roasts of Joan Rivers (2009), David Hasselhoff (2010), and Donald Trump (2011). In August 2010, her first one-hour special, titled Whitney Cummings: Money Shot, premiered on Comedy Central. In 2010, Cummings went on tour with Denis Leary and the Rescue Me Comedy Tour to promote the show's sixth season. She also appeared with Leary on Douchebags and Donuts. 2011‚Äìpresent: Television projects and specials, book Cummings performing live in 2016 In 2011, two multi-camera, live-audience sitcoms Cummings created were picked up by broadcast networks: 2 Broke Girls (which she co-created and executive produced with Michael Patrick King) and Whitney (which she starred in, executive produced, and created). Whitney, in which Cummings portrayed a semi- fictionalized version of herself, was not well received by critics, and Cummings acknowledges it was a learning curve for her. The series was canceled after two seasons in May 2013. While still working on the second season of Whitney, Cummings also hosted a talk show, Love You, Mean It with Whitney Cummings, on E! in 2012, which was cancelled after 11 episodes. Cummings later stated that she was overworking herself during this period, and was also in the midst of battling an eating disorder in which she would binge eat followed by compulsive exercise. In June 2014, Cummings released her second hour-long special, I Love You, on Comedy Central. Her third hour-long special debuted on HBO in 2016, titled \\"I'm Your Girlfriend\\". Reviews were mixed, suggesting it felt less comedic than her previous stand up performances. Cummings had a supporting role in the 2017 thriller Unforgettable, starring Katherine Heigl and Rosario Dawson, released in April 2017. The following month,2 Broke Girls was cancelled after having run six consecutive seasons. Cummings made her directorial debut with The Female Brain (2017), an independent comedy film distributed by IFC Films, which Cummings also starred in. Also in 2017, Cummings published her first book, titled I'm Fine...And Other Lies, a collection of personal stories about her life. Beginning in 2018, Cummings served as one of the head writers, an executive producer, and overseer of day- to-day production of the revival of the comedy series Roseanne, for ABC. Cummings left the show, however, after its star, Roseanne Barr, made a series of inflammatory, racially-charged jokes on her Twitter account, which subsequently resulted in the series' cancellation. Her fourth hour-long special Can I Touch It? was released on July 30, 2019 on Netflix. This special features a robot that Whitney got custom made to look exactly like her; and she brings this robot out at the end of the special. On November 5, 2019, Cummings launched her first podcast entitled Good for You. Her first guest was actor/producer Dan Levy. Good for You is co-hosted by assistant and fellow comedian Benton Ray - and features a wide variety of guests; ranging from politicians and comedians; to actors and journalists. Influences Ashley Graham interviews Cummings on her perspective on comedy, influences, and approach to co-dependency in 2019 Cummings has described her comedic influences, beginning with Paul Reiser, who she said \\"made these hysterical, brilliant commentary about the most mundane things and open it up to a hysterical world\\". Other important influences for her were George Carlin, whom she says challenged her to \\"question everything\\". Later influences were Dave Attell (\\"a legend now but he's very edgy\\"), Lenny Bruce and Bill Hicks.

It is the only recognized species in its genus. This species has a broad distribution, mainly throughout the left side tributaries of the Amazon basin and the Capim River basin in Brazil, as well as in the right tributaries of the Amazon basin in Brazil, Orinoco basin of Venezuela, and drainages in Guyana. M. asopos is a strictly sand-dwelling species. It spends the daytime buried in the top layer of sand. It forages mostly at night and sometimes in the morning. As an ambush predator, when foraging, it poises in the streamlet channel where water is flowing, supported by a tripod formed by its pelvic and anal fins, spreading both its very long barbels and the filamentous dorsal and pectoral-fin rays, thus forming a kind of \\"drift-trap\\". When the fish intercepts food, it will lunge at these food particles; after lunging for a short distance, it will return to its previous hunting spot. This behavior is similar to that seen in the tripod fish. Small trichopteran larvae (ingested with the sand cases) and ephemeropterans constituted a considerable portion of the gut contents in a study of Mastiglanis asopos, but their foraging behavior allows a varied diet which includes large chironomid larvae and small adult beetles that would not be consumed by other sand-dwelling animals. M. asopos grows to SL. This fish has long barbels and long first pectoral fin rays which are used for feeding. It also has an acuminate (tapered to a point) snout.

He practises in Montreal and Toronto. In 2001, he co-founded LASIK MD with Mark Cohen. LASIK MD is Canada's largest provider of laser refractive surgery, performing over 60,000 procedures a year. He is one of only 14 certified CLasik instructors in North America.  Education Wallerstein studied physiology at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec and completed his Doctor of Medicine degree (MD) at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, Canada. He then specialized in ophthalmology (FCRSC) at McGill University in Montreal where he received his Royal College of Canada certification. He went on to complete his post-doctoral fellowship training in corneal transplantation, cataract surgery and laser refractive surgery from Cornell, North Shore University Hospital and New York University, in New York City, USA. Wallerstein is a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada (FRCSC) and is a member of the American, European and International Societies of Refractive Surgery as well as the American Academy of Ophthalmology.  Professional work  Wallerstein has extensive clinical experience and has conducted over 60,000 laser ocular surgery procedures. He has devoted the last eighteen years of his career to laser refractive care, focusing his medical practice exclusively on laser vision correction. He performs complex corneal collagen and cross-linking (CXL) procedures for keratoconus patients, combined with excimer laser and topography-guided treatments for challenging corneas. Wallerstein's early career saw him work in various clinics. He was the LASIK specialist at Focus Eye Centre in Ottawa and Montreal's Ophthalmolaser Clinic. During this time, Wallerstein was the first Montreal surgeon to introduce the vertical flap technique with a scanning spot laser, a method that was ultimately adopted as the standard of care in laser refractive surgeries across North America. He later assumed the role of International Medical Director at LASIK Vision Corporation. There, he oversaw medical protocol in 28 clinics with 58 surgeons across North America, and became the co-chairman of their medical advisory committee and sat on the board of directors for LASIK Vision Corporation. In 2001, Wallerstein went on to found LASIK MD with Mark Cohen, and sits as the company's Executive Vice- President. He is one of two of LASIK MD's National Medical Directors, a role that sees him responsible for implementing protocol, standardization and quality control in all clinics across the country, as well as overseeing the annual LASIK MD National Surgeon Conference on Advanced LASIK Techniques. He also supervises and teaches a team of over 50 laser eye surgeons practicing in the various clinics. Wallerstein heads LASIK MD's research & development department.

Gant, 556 U.S. 332 (2009), was a United States Supreme Court decision holding that the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution requires law enforcement officers to demonstrate an actual and continuing threat to their safety posed by an arrestee, or a need to preserve evidence related to the crime of arrest from tampering by the arrestee, in order to justify a warrantless vehicular search incident to arrest conducted after the vehicle's recent occupants have been arrested and secured. Background The case involved Rodney J. Gant, who was arrested by Tucson, Arizona, police on an outstanding warrant for driving with a suspended driver‚Äôs license. Police arrested Gant in a friend's yard after he had parked his vehicle and was walking away. Gant and all other suspects on the scene were then secured in police patrol cars. The officers then searched Gant's vehicle. After finding a weapon and a bag of cocaine, they also charged him with possession of a narcotic drug for sale and possession of drug paraphernalia. Arguments before the Court Thomas Frank Jacobs (Tucson, Arizona), lead counsel for Rodney Gant, argued the case before the U.S. Supreme Court on October 7, 2008. Jacobs argued that an unreasonable expansion of a limited authority to search vehicles incident to arrest provided by the Supreme Court's 1981 decision in New York v. Belton was occurring. Lower courts were allowing searches after the initial justifications for setting aside the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement had ceased to exist, relying on a so-called bright-line rule of \\"if arrest, then search.\\" Jacobs argued, and the Court ultimately agreed, that such application of the Belton exception caused the exception to \\"swallow the rule,\\" allowing unconstitutional searches. =Amici curiae= A group of legal scholars, including University of Iowa law professor James Tomkovicz, wrote an amicus curiae brief asking the court to overturn the 1981 case, New York v. Belton, that granted police the authority to search a person's vehicle even if that person is not in the vehicle. According to Tomkovicz, Belton failed to meet the constitutional standard of probable cause. Opinion of the Court In an opinion delivered by Justice Stevens, the Supreme Court held that police may search the passenger compartment of a vehicle, incident to a recent occupant's arrest (and therefore without a warrant) only if it is reasonable to believe that the arrestee might access the vehicle at the time of the search, or that the vehicle contains evidence of the offense of arrest. Justice Scalia wrote a concurring opinion, stating that \\"we should simply abandon the Belton-Thornton charade of officer safety and overrule those cases. I would hold that a vehicle search incident to arrest is ipso facto 'reasonable' only when the object of the search is evidence of the crime for which the arrest was made, or of another crime that the officer has probable cause to believe occurred.\\" Justice Alito wrote a dissent joined by Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Kennedy, and Justice Breyer in part, saying that the court could not overrule New York v. Belton and Thornton v. United States, 541 U. S. 615 (2004). Justice Breyer wrote a separate dissent.

Early life and education Born in McBride, British Columbia, Monroe was raised in Oregon and graduated from Portland's Franklin High School in 1960. He attended college at Warner Pacific University and received bachelor's and master's degrees from Portland State College (now Portland State University) in 1965 and 1969 respectively.  Career  He became a teacher at Tigard High School in Tigard, Oregon in 1965, teaching history and government and later served on the David Douglas school board. In 1976, Monroe was elected to the Oregon House of Representatives, representing District 12 in Portland. He served two terms and then was elected to the Oregon Senate in 1980, representing the 7th district in Portland. He was re-elected to a second Senate term in 1984. During this legislative tenure, Monroe was known for sponsoring safety-oriented legislation, such as mandatory seat belt laws, tougher drunk driving legislation, and bans on indoor smoking. Monroe ran for the Democratic nomination in the 1986 U.S. Senate election in Oregon, but came in second behind Jim Weaver. In 1988, he lost a close election in the Democratic primary to Oregon House Majority Leader Shirley Gold, who had been elected to Monroe's seat when he was elected to the Senate. In the 1990 Democratic primary, Monroe sought to upset incumbent Judy Bauman for a seat in the Oregon House, but he was narrowly defeated. In 1992, Monroe was elected to the council of Metro., the regional government for greater Portland. He served three terms, where he advocated for federal funding of light rail projects and the Portland Streetcar, as well as for biking and pedestrian trails such as the Springwater Corridor. In 2004, he was defeated for a fourth term by environmentalist Robert Liberty. In Oregon's 2006 legislative elections, Monroe was again elected to the Oregon Senate in the District 24 seat vacated by the retiring Frank Shields. In 2018, Monroe ran for reelection but was defeated in the Democratic primary by former state Representative Shemia Fagan. Fagan ran unopposed in the general election later that year and won the election to become Monroe's successor in the state Senate. Personal life Monroe lives in Portland, Oregon with his wife Billie.

Definition \\"Alien space bats\\" originally was used as a sarcastic attack on poorly written alternate histories seen as being implausible. These attacks are usually phrased as the need for \\"alien space bats\\" or by saying the alternate history has gone into \\"ASB territory\\". The term eventually evolved into a reference to deus ex machina to create an impossible point of divergence. Examples include changes to the physical laws of nature, time travel, and advanced aliens interfering in human affairs. An example of the latter is Harry Turtledove's Worldwar series. History The term \\"alien space bats\\" was first coined, then popularized in the Usenet group soc.history.what- if.https://groups.google.com/group/soc.history.what-if/topics soc.history.what-if Alison Brooks (1959‚Äì2002) is credited as the creator of the term, using it to debunk the possibility of a successful Operation Sea Lion by saying the only way it could be successful was if alien space bats helped the Nazis. Brooks regretted the use of the ASBs as a supernatural agency, preferring to restrict them to rhetoric. S. M. Stirling credited Brooks with creating the term in the acknowledgments section of Dies the Fire, in which he changed the laws of physics, and also used the plot device to send Nantucket back in time in Island in the Sea of Time. One character throughout Dies the Fire and its sequels believes the change to the laws of nature was done by an advanced alien race because the changes were finely tailored, and refers to this race as alien space bats. In a review of Dies the Fire, Dale Cozort addressed the perceived implausibility of the novel by saying \\"Just say to yourself, 'The elder gods or alien space bats took our toys away and that‚Äôs all there is to it.'\\" Paul Di Filippo uses the term often when reviewing the series. The term also appeared in John Birmingham's 2008 novel Without Warning. In the UK, \\"space bats\\" was a term used by Professor Denzil Dexter, a character in the TV comedy series The Fast Show, first appearing in Series 1, Episode 5, broadcast on 10.25.94.

It is the oldest cultural and scientific Slovenian institution. The museum features national, European, and worldwide collections demonstrating the changes in biodiversity, the development of the natural history thought, as well as different techniques of collection and preparation of samples. Its research activities focus on natural heritage of Slovenia. The Slovenian Museum of Natural History operates in the Center District in Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia, at Museum Street (), near Tivoli Park, the Parliament and the Opera House. Along with the National Museum of Slovenia, it is housed in a building from 1885, built upon the plans by the Viennese architect Wilhelm Rezori and the master builder Wilhelm Treo from Ljubljana. The symbol of the museum is an almost complete woolly mammoth skeleton, found in Nevlje near Kamnik in 1938. Its official publication, published since autumn 1978, has been named Scopolia in honour of Giovanni Antonio Scopoli, a leading Carniolan naturalist of the 18th century.  History  The wooly mammoth skeleton that was found in 1938 in Nevlje is one of the best preserved in Europe and the symbol of the Natural History Museum of Slovenia. The museum was founded in 1821 as the Carniolan Estates Museum (). Five years later, the Austrian Emperor Francis II decided to personally sponsor the museum and ordered its renaming to Carniolan Provincial Museum. In 1882, the museum was renamed to Carniolan Provincial Museum - Rudolphinum in honour of the Crown Prince Rudolph. After the establishment of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, the name was changed to National Museum. In 1944, it was divided into the National Museum of Slovenia and the Slovenian Museum of Natural History (then known as Museum of Natural Sciences). in 2005, the museum acquired its largest object, a skeleton of a young female fin whale Leonora, which was found dead at the Slovenian coast in 2003. The corpse weighted and was long. After an elaborate procedure, the skeleton was put on display in autumn 2011. Collections The museum's geological-palaeontological collections include fossils from various Slovenian sites. In addition to the mammoth from Nevlje, also of significance are a 210-million-year-old long fish skeleton found in the Triglav Mountains and a Miocene-era baleen whale skeleton found in the Slovene Hills. One of the museum's founding collections was Sigmund Zois's mineral collection. Although it is an outstanding historical collection, minerals are now exhibited as classified by modern methods according to their internal structure, and among them is the mineral zoisite, named after Zois. There are also two Biedermeier wooden tables that are covered by tiles from Palnstorf's collection of minerals and rocks. Hohenwart's collection of mollusc shells comprises about 5,000 specimens, dating from 1831 and originating mainly from the Indo-Pacific. The insect collection of Ferdinand J. Schmidt includes several interesting specimens, notably the \\"narrow-necked\\" blind cave beetles (Leptodirus hochenwartii) that were described in 1831 as the first cave insect. The plants and animals of the mountains, marshes, and woods are shown in specialised dioramas. Also on view are permanent bird, reptile, fish, mammal and skeleton collections. The Slovenian Wildlife Sound Archive is a collection of animal sounds, mainly on Heteroptera and cicadas, stored on digital and analogue recording media.

Starting in the early 1980s, there were many skinheads in the New York hardcore scene, although Detroit, Chicago, Seattle and Boston also had strong scenes. Skinheads became prevalent towards the end of the first wave of hardcore, and this continued through the youth crew era of hardcore. Many of the key New York skinhead hardcore bands were influenced by the burgeoning crossover thrash scene. In the early 1990s, there was a steep decline in the involvement of skinheads in the hardcore scene as more of them moved on to the American Oi! scene. However, these American Oi! bands were distinct from their British forerunners because they were influenced by the American hardcore sound. The hardcore skinhead scene did not completely fade away in New York City, with several bands coming from the DMS crew (Doc Marten Skinheads), such as Madball, Agnostic Front, and Murphy's Law. The White Power Skinhead scene also produced several hardcore bands in the late 80ies and 90ies like Blue Eyed Devils, Angry Aryans, No Alibi, Steelcap and H8 Machine. These bands are sometimes referred to as hatecore. Style and clothing Although characterised by some of the same items as British skinhead fashion (flight jackets; Ben Sherman shirts or Fred Perry shirts; rolled up jeans; suspenders; and combat boots or Dr. Martens boots,) hardcore skinhead dress is considerably less strict than traditional skinhead style. Items that have been popular in the hardcore skinhead subculture include: leather jackets, army jackets, windbreaker jackets, hooded sweatshirts, bandanas, white \\"wifebeater\\" shirts, looser jeans (perhaps torn at the knee), heavy chains worn as belts, and construction or rigger's gloves. Trainer sneakers, in particular Adidas Sambas, have been popular.

Gameplay The player plays as a modern-day ninja, using a katana, twin swords and broad sword as the main weapon to the hostile creatures. Combat system is similar to Ninja Gaiden or Devil May Cry. A chi bar is used up when \\"ninja vision\\" or ninjutsu is used. The gameplay is highly cinematic, relying on quick time events to finish missions; after attacking a boss until the health bar is empty, the player must perform a finishing move, called the todome.Todome - The Most Gruesome Finishing Moves Ever - UGO.com Plot In 2011, the inhabitants of a small Northern African village are infected by an unknown hookworm parasite, classified as \\"Alpha-worm\\", which alters its hosts' bodies and minds while increasing their strength and resilience. To prevent an outbreak, the military raid the quarantine zone and exterminate the infected, while the incident is covered up by the government. Military intelligence forms a containment task force called GUIDE (Global United Infestation Detection and Elimination), recruiting operatives from around the world. Four years later, a GUIDE ninja team, including the young Ken Ogawa and led by his father Kanbe, is dispatched to Tokyo to contain a massive Alpha-worm outbreak. Following Kanbe's trail, Ken chases and defeats an Arachne creature, however Kanbe and fellow team member Kuroh, having been infected by King Worms, slaughter the entire unit. Kanbe runs Ken through with the clan's 'Ninja Blade', narrowly missing his heart ‚Äî something a master swordsman could only do on purpose. After a quick recovery, Ken is dispatched solo back to the city. As Ken eliminates other major Alpha-worm Carriers, he is informed that the military are considering a mass sterilization of Tokyo via orbital laser cannon, which will sacrifice its entire population. He then pursues two more King Worm hosts, a father-daughter pair of Yakuza bosses Oyabun and Ryoko Kurokawa. After defeating both, Ken witnesses Ryoko momentarily regain her sanity and beg for a mercy killing, which re-ignites hope in Ken that he may still save his father. After thwarting an attempt to spread the infection overseas through a plane carrying evacuees, Ken learns that Kuroh has attacked the local shopping mall and rigged the Tokyo underground with explosive Carriers called Blast Mites. Ken disposes of the Mites, catapulting the last one into the air out of harm's way. The bombing, however, was meant as a distraction to allow Kuroh to lead a strike team of Carrier military operatives into the GUIDE headquarters. All GUIDE personnel, including director Michael Wilson, are taken hostage. With the help of Wilson himself, Ken manages to rescue the hostages, after having to kill his former teammates turned Carriers. In a final confrontation with Ken, Kuroh reveals that Ken was not born but made in a military lab with the goal of wiping out the Alpha- worms, hence his immunity to the parasite. Kuroh also reveals that both he and Kanbe infected themselves with King Worms intentionally, Kuroh having done so out of craving for the power bestowed by the parasite. Kanbe rescues Ken from a suicide attack by Kuroh, whereupon he confirms he volunteered to be infected, but only so that he could infiltrate and locate the Alpha-worm hive, which was buried underground to escape sterilization. Ken goes underground and eventually finds the hive, however he is unable to use the Ninja Blade to destroy it. A now controlled Kanbe challenges Ken on top of the Tokyo Tower. Before Ken can finish him, the hive absorbs Kanbe, thus transforming into a colossal version of him which begins laying waste to the city. Ken chases down and attacks the mutant Kanbe, weakening him enough for Ken to enter the hive and attack its core, which manifests itself in Kanbe's shape again. Ken defeats the core using the Ninja Blade and finally brings peace to his father, then the hive crumbles along with every trace of the infection. Months later, Tokyo is being rebuilt after the whole incident is again covered up by the government and media. Wilson reforms GUIDE and appoints Ken to train and lead the new recruits in the event of a new outbreak. Development The concept for Ninja Blade initially came when From Software tried to create a game that conveyed to the gamer the same intense sequences as those of Hollywood action films. From Software worked with Microsoft in creating the game's protagonist, Ken Ogawa. Ninja Blade producer Masanori Takeuchi said: \\"We worked closely with Microsoft in creating Ken. They provided us with lots of useful feedback and insightful consumer research of worldwide gamers. By cooperating and working together, Ken has become more appealing to a wider audience.\\" The character was designed by Capcom 2nd Character Development Studio designer Keiji Nakaoka.Ninja Blade: Creating Ken Ogawa - Xbox 360 Feature at IGN The game has been categorized as a \\"cinematic action game,\\" combining a mixture of hack and slash elements with context-sensitive commands. Ninja Blade was commonly referred to as Otogi 3 by various sources before its official announcement. Ninja Blade planner Kazuhiro Hamatani noted that while not a direct sequel or spiritual successor to Otogi, that the game would contain action-adventure elements of which fans of the Otogi series would like. The soundtrack was composed by Norihiko Hibino's GEM Impact studio. The animation was produced by Production I.G. A demo for Ninja Blade was released in Japan on December 29, 2008. The demo was released in North America on March 10, 2009. Reception Overall, the game has received mixed to positive reviews. Ninja Blade was named Game of the Month in the June 2009 issue of GamePro, with a rating of 5/5 stars.

Structure The membership of BSRLM is made up mostly of researchers, students, teachers and education advisors. BSRLM is run by an elected executive committee of eight members. The current chair is Dr Sue Gifford (University of Roehampton, London). Origins of BSRLM In the late 1960s and early 1970s there was a number of teacher trainers and university lecturers in the UK, principally teaching mathematics and psychology, who became involved in research in the learning and teaching of mathematics, and in the movement to establish mathematics education as an academic discipline. Two groups who were meeting during this period were the Psychology of Mathematics Education Workshop, principally in London, and the British Society for the Psychology of Learning Mathematics, in locations in the Midlands. Since many individuals attended both of these groups, they eventually came together as BSRLM in January 1985.

History of the area By 1906, Sir Audley Neeld was building on the land that had been Renters Farm, starting with a new road from Station Road to Queens Road, later called Vivian Avenue. The eventual estate used many names associated with the family: Dallas, Audley, Elliot, Graham, Rundell, Vivian, Algernon and Neeld. Other names are associated with Neeld estates in Grittleton, including Alderton, Foscote, Sevington, and Allington. Hendon Central Underground station and the Watford Way were constructed in 1923.

When selecting size of a cladding element, take wind-loadings into account, and also consider the standard sizes available of the sheet (or coil) pre-material, to minimise material wastage through off-cuts. This helps to reduce costs. The choice of which system to use depends on the aesthetic effect required, and building geometry can also have an influence on the choice. Copper cladding is very durable, lightweight compared to other materials and techniques, and at the end of the building life is also 100% recyclable. Depending on metal prices, copper may be a very cost-effective cladding and roofing material. With good building design, materials choice and craftsmanship, copper roofing or facade cladding may be cheaper than slates or concrete tiles, especially when one takes into account the lasting colour, durability, maintenance-free and lightweight nature of the cladding. Because the UK code of practice for \\"hard metal\\" cladding (as opposed to lead cladding) is quite old ‚Äì CP143: part 12 (1970) ‚Äì the major manufacturers have to provide detailed technical advice and information for architects, designers and builders, and cultivate skilled installers with years of experience to draw on.

Founded in 1883, Dublin University A.F.C. is the oldest surviving association football club in the Republic of Ireland. Their senior men's team currently competes in the Leinster Senior League. They have previously played in both the League of Ireland B Division and the League of Ireland U21 Division. The club also enters teams in the College & Universities Football League, the Women's Soccer Colleges Association of Ireland League, the Collingwood Cup and the FAI Intermediate Cup. The club has previously entered teams in both the Irish Cup and the FAI Cup. History =Early years= In 1883 a group of former Trinity College Dublin students formed Dublin Association F.C., following a meeting in Tyrone Place, later to become Cathedral Street. Shortly after, the current students at TCD formed Dublin University A.F.C. and on 7 November 1883 the two clubs met in one of the earliest organised association football games played in Dublin. Dublin Association won the game 4‚Äì0. By 1890 Dublin Association was disbanded, leaving Dublin University A.F.C. as the oldest surviving association football club in the Republic of Ireland. On 30 November 1883 at College Park, Dublin University A.F.C. also played in the first ever game between a Belfast and Dublin team, losing 6‚Äì0 to Belfast Athletic. In 1883‚Äì84, together with Dublin Association, they became one of the first two Dublin clubs to compete in the Irish Cup. They continued to compete in the Irish Cup between 1883‚Äì84 and 1888‚Äì89, again from 1893‚Äì94 to 1899‚Äì1900 and then sporadically until 1912‚Äì13. Their best season came in 1885‚Äì86 when they reached the semi-final after scoring 18 goals without reply in the first four rounds. Ireland international, William Eames, captained the team from half- back. On 19 December 1885, Eames scored a goal in the 7‚Äì0 defeat of Clifton Park in the third round, adding three further goals in the 6‚Äì0 defeat of Banbridge in the next round. However in the semi-final on the 13 February 1886 they lost 4‚Äì0 to Distillery. On 27 October 1892 Dublin University A.F.C. became founder members of the Leinster Football Association. The LFA soon organized their own cup competition, the Leinster Senior Cup which was first played for in 1892‚Äì93. The inaugural final saw Leinster Nomads defeat Dublin University 2‚Äì1. Dublin University also played in the 1893‚Äì94 and 1894‚Äì95 finals, losing both to Bohemians after replays. Dublin University also became founder members of the Leinster Senior League. =Intervarsity= Dublin University A.F.C. is affiliated to the Irish Universities Football Union and regularly competes in annual intervarsity competitions such as the Collingwood Cup, the Farquhar Cup, the Crowley Cup and the Harding Cup. In 1914, together with University College Dublin, Queen's University Belfast and University College Galway, Dublin University entered the inaugural Collingwood Cup tournament. However during the First World War/Irish War of Independence era, the club ceased to exist and despite several attempts at a relaunch, it was not until 1939 that the club was reformed. In 1947 and 1949 Dublin University shared the Collingwood Cup with QUB and UCD respectively. However the club would have to wait until 1967 before it won the Collingwood Cup outright for the first time. In the final at College Park they defeated QUB 1‚Äì0 with a penalty scored five minutes from the end. In 1979 with a team featuring Hugo MacNeill and coached by Liam Tuohy, Dublin University won the Collingwood Cup outright for a second time. MacNeill scored twice in the final as Dublin University defeated Maynooth University 2‚Äì0. =National level= In the late 1960s Dublin University rejoined the Leinster Senior League and in 1975 they were elected to the League of Ireland B Division. In 2005 when the B Division was reformed as the League of Ireland U21 Division, they remained in the new division. However the U21 Division operated as a summer league and Dublin University struggled to field teams during the summer months when the university was closed. After three years of summer football, Dublin University's senior team re-joined the Leinster Senior League in 2008‚Äì09. Grounds Dublin University play their home matches at College Park, Dublin. They also play at their grounds in Santry. Throughout their history, the club has also played at grounds in Clontarf and Grangegorman.

He was the only son of John Horridge, chemist, of Tonge with Haulgh, and Margaret Barlow of Bolton, Lancashire. He was educated in Barnes, Surrey before becoming a solicitor in Southport in 1879. In 1884, he was called to the bar at the Middle Temple, serving in the Northern Circuit.Obituary - Sir T Horridge, The Times, 26 July 1938, p.14 In January 1901, it was announced that Horridge was to be appointed a queen's counsel. With Victoria's death, the warrant was issued by her successor, Edward VII, and he became a king's counsel.Law Report, The Times, 1 February 1910, p.13 In 1906, he was elected as the Liberal Member of Parliament for Manchester East, spectacularly unseating the former Conservative Prime Minister, Arthur Balfour. He particularly campaigned on the \\"Chinese Slavery\\" issue: the Conservative government's policy of using indentured Chinese labourers, housed in primitive enclosures, to operate South African gold mines. Horridge stood down at the next general election in January 1910, and resumed his legal career. He was promptly appointed a judge of the King's Bench Division, a decision that was criticised as political at the time.The New Judges, The Times, 4 August 1910, p.6 He subsequently dealt with cases in the Divorce and Bankruptcy Courts, and also took part in the trial for treason of Roger Casement.

(2003) Speedway ‚Äì The Pre War Years, Stroud: Tempus Publishing. Elder is considered the father of American broadsliding.  Career  Elder initially wanted to become a jockey but by his late teens had grown to almost six feet tall, leading to his 'Sprouts' nickname.Chaplin, John (1990) \\"Sprouts: The Scarlet Streak\\", in Speedway Special: The Classic Legends, Penrove Books, , p. 55-62 He got a job in a motorcycle shop and began racing, eventually taking up speedway. He initially learned to race racing on some of the last surviving board track racing circuits during the 1920s. In the late 1920s Elder really began to make a name for himself by racing overseas. Elder was also a pioneer of speedway racing in the USA. He was a champion rider at home and abroad during the 1920s and early 1930s and helped organize speedway racing on the east and west coasts of America, later becoming an AMA referee and a member of the competition committee. In 1925 Sprouts Elder became the inaugural AMA American Speedway Champion. Elder was also a visitor to Australia, winning the Maroubra Golden Helmet four times in 1927, and once in 1928 on the concrete 1 mile Maroubra Speedway.Australian Golden Helmet In Australia Elder raced against top Australian as well as several top British and American riders who also spent the winter months racing in the Australian summer, mostly on the larger showground tracks of the day such as the Sydney Showground Speedway, Brisbane Exhibition Ground (Ekka), the Wayville Showground in Adelaide, and Perth's Claremont Speedway (as of 2014 only the Ekka and Wayville stand as they did in the late 1920s and early 1930s when Elder rode there). Elder also won titles in South America, including the first unofficial Speedway World Championship event at Buenos Aires, Argentina, while under contract to A.J. Hunting. He also won numerous Argentine Gold, Silver and Bronze Helmets in 1929, 1930 and 1930. 1928 saw Elder turn his attention to racing in the United Kingdom, becoming one of the most popular riders in the country. He could command fees of ¬£100 per meeting, plus prize money, and once earned ¬£350 in a day by racing at three nearby tracks. He is estimated to have earned ¬£50,000 in his first three years of riding in Britain. Crowds of 30,000 to 40,000 were not uncommon at larger meetings during the heyday of speedway racing in England. Elder's popularity was revealed when the British paper Speedway News honoured Elder by calling him the greatest showman of all time. In 1928 he won several titles in Britain, including the Golden Helmet at White City, Manchester, the Golden Gauntlet and West Ham Championship at West Ham, the Silver Wheel and Silver Sash at Wimbledon, the Silver Belt at Custom House, and the Golden Helmet at Leicester,Jones, Alan (2010) Speedway in Leicester: The Pre-War Years, Automedia, p. 14-15 while also winning the Scottish Gold and Silver Helmets in 1929. He never rode for the West Ham Hammers in 1929 but was their overseas representative in the Star Riders' Championship,West Ham Hammers riders E to H and in 1930 he rode for the Southampton Saints.Morgan, Tom (1947) The People Speedway Guide, Odhams Press, p. 58 Elder was one of speedway's pioneers and featured in the first Star Riders' Championship, the forerunner to the Speedway World Championship in 1929. He was beaten in the semi final of the 'overseas' section by Australian Vic Huxley. During the mid-1930s, Elder returned to the United States to help organize American speedway. Speedway racing was among the popular forms of motorcycle racing in the country. Elder, along with Wilbur Lamoreaux, Jack and Cordy Milne, he helped found and promote speedway in America.  Retirement  Elder retired from racing after joining the California Highway Patrol and was responsible for securing sponsorship from the Highway Patrol for a number of meetings. Elder retired from the patrol after suffering life-threatening injuries in a traffic accident. Even after retirement, Elder stayed involved with racing through his duties on the AMA Competition Committee. He lost his fortune after investing in a failed mining venture.  Death  Elder died in 1957 after committing suicide following the death of his wife. He was posthumously inducted into the Fresno County Athletic Hall of Fame in 1962, and into the AMA Motorcycle Hall of Fame in 1998.

After the war, he was a prominent West Virginia businessman and railroad executive, as well as a West Virginia legislator. Early life Chew was born into a prominent family in Loudoun County, Virginia. His father was Roger Chew and his mother the former Sarah Aldridge. The family moved to Charles Town, West Virginia (then Virginia) when Roger was three years old, and he attended the Charles Town Academy, and later the Virginia Military Institute. The Chew family owned The Hermitage, one of the oldest houses in western Virginia.Hermitage NRIS at p. 13, available at http://www.wvculture.org/shpo/nr/pdf/jefferson/93001444.pdf American Civil War With the outbreak of the Civil War, young Chew raised a battery of horse artillery, \\"Chew's Battery,\\" which eventually became part of the famous Laurel Brigade under Stonewall Jackson's command. He and his brother John A. Chew participated in all Jackson's campaigns until Jackson's death in May 1863. Chew also led raids into Union-occupied Middleway, West Virginia in February 1863, and Charles Town on May 12, 1863. Despite his youth, Roger Chew was promoted to the chief of the cavalry's guns under J.E.B. Stuart. He then served through the Gettysburg Campaign, the Wilderness, Spotsylvania Court House, Cold Harbor, the Siege of Petersburg, and the Appomattox Campaign.Longacre (2002) After the war, Roger Chew and his brother Robert rebuilt the family farm. In 1871, Roger married Louise Fontaine Washington, daughter of the last owner of Mount Vernon at Blakeley, and the couple would eventually have 6 children. Her father John Augustine Washington had served on General Lee's staff until killed in action in late 1861. Louise Chew purchased Blakeley from her financially struggling uncle in 1875, and maintained it until its sale in 1892. Roger Chew engaged in numerous business ventures, including as the president of the Eagle Manufacturing Company. From 1882 until 1888, he also served as a delegate in the West Virginia legislature. In 1883, the Shenandoah Valley Railroad constructed what became known as Chew's Siding, a private spur that led from the main line to Chew's business. In 1890, Chew and several business partners formed the Charles Town Mining, Manufacturing, and Improvement Company and Chew became its first president. Death and legacy Chew died in Charles Town in 1921 and is buried in the Zion Episcopal Church graveyard, as are his wife (who died in 1927) and brother (who died in 1898).

The phenolic content in wine refers to the phenolic compounds‚Äînatural phenol and polyphenols‚Äîin wine, which include a large group of several hundred chemical compounds that affect the taste, color and mouthfeel of wine. These compounds include phenolic acids, stilbenoids, flavonols, dihydroflavonols, anthocyanins, flavanol monomers (catechins) and flavanol polymers (proanthocyanidins). This large group of natural phenols can be broadly separated into two categories, flavonoids and non-flavonoids. Flavonoids include the anthocyanins and tannins which contribute to the color and mouthfeel of the wine. The non-flavonoids include the stilbenoids such as resveratrol and phenolic acids such as benzoic, caffeic and cinnamic acids.  Origin of the phenolic compounds  The natural phenols are not evenly distributed within the fruit. Phenolic acids are largely present in the pulp, anthocyanins and stilbenoids in the skin, and other phenols (catechins, proanthocyanidins and flavonols) in the skin and the seeds. During the growth cycle of the grapevine, sunlight will increase the concentration of phenolics in the grape berries, their development being an important component of canopy management. The proportion of the different phenols in any one wine will therefore vary according to the type of vinification. Red wine will be richer in phenols abundant in the skin and seeds, such as anthocyanin, proanthocyanidins and flavonols, whereas the phenols in white wine will essentially originate from the pulp, and these will be the phenolic acids together with lower amounts of catechins and stilbenes. Red wines will also have the phenols found in white wines. Wine simple phenols are further transformed during wine aging into complex molecules formed notably by the condensation of proanthocyanidins and anthocyanins, which explains the modification in the color. Anthocyanins react with catechins, proanthocyanidins and other wine components during wine aging to form new polymeric pigments resulting in a modification of the wine color and a lower astringency. Average total polyphenol content measured by the Folin method is 216 mg/100 ml for red wine and 32 mg/100 ml for white wine. The content of phenols in ros√© wine (82 mg/100 ml) is intermediate between that in red and white wines. In winemaking, the process of maceration or \\"skin contact\\" is used to increase the concentration of phenols in wine. Phenolic acids are found in the pulp or juice of the wine and can be commonly found in white wines which usually do not go through a maceration period. The process of oak aging can also introduce phenolic compounds into wine, most notably vanillin which adds vanilla aroma to wines.J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pg 517-518 Oxford University Press 2006 Most wine phenols are classified as secondary metabolites and were not thought to be active in the primary metabolism and function of the grapevine. However, there is evidence that in some plants flavonoids play a role as endogenous regulators of auxin transport. They are water-soluble and are usually secreted into the vacuole of the grapevine as glycosides.  Grape polyphenols  Vitis vinifera produces many phenolic compounds. There is a varietal effect on the relative composition. = Flavonoids = The process of maceration or extended skin contact allows the extraction of phenolic compounds (including those that form a wine's color) from the skins of the grape into the wine. In red wine, up to 90% of the wine's phenolic content falls under the classification of flavonoids. These phenols, mainly derived from the stems, seeds and skins are often leached out of the grape during the maceration period of winemaking. The amount of phenols leached is known as extraction. These compounds contribute to the astringency, color and mouthfeel of the wine. In white wines the number of flavonoids is reduced due to the lesser contact with the skins that they receive during winemaking. There is on-going study into the health benefits of wine derived from the antioxidant and chemopreventive properties of flavonoids.J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pg 273-274 Oxford University Press 2006  Flavonols  Within the flavonoid category is a subcategory known as flavonols, which includes the yellow pigment - quercetin. Like other flavonoids, the concentration of flavonols in the grape berries increases as they are exposed to sunlight. Some viticulturalists will use measurement of flavonols such as quercetin as an indication of a vineyard's sun exposure and the effectiveness of canopy management techniques.  Anthocyanins  Anthocyanins are phenolic compounds found throughout the plant kingdom, being frequently responsible for the blue to red colors found in flowers, fruits and leaves. In wine grapes, they develop during the stage of veraison when the skin of red wine grapes changes color from green to red to black. As the sugars in the grape increase during ripening so does the concentration of anthocyanins. In most grapes anthocyanins are found only in the outer cell layers of the skin, leaving the grape juice inside virtually colorless. Therefore, to get color pigmentation in the wine, the fermenting must needs to be in contact with the grape skins in order for the anthocyanins to be extracted. Hence, white wine can be made from red wine grapes in the same way that many white sparkling wines are made from the red wine grapes of Pinot noir and Pinot Meunier. The exception to this is the small class of grapes known as teinturiers, such as Alicante Bouschet, which have a small amount of anthocyanins in the pulp that produces pigmented juice.J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pg 24 Oxford University Press 2006 There are several types of anthocyanins (as the glycoside) found in wine grapes which are responsible for the vast range of coloring from ruby red through to dark black found in wine grapes. Ampelographers can use this observation to assist in the identification of different grape varieties. The European vine family Vitis vinifera is characterized by anthocyanins that are composed of only one molecule of glucose while non-vinifera vines such as hybrids and the American Vitis labrusca will have anthocyanins with two molecules. This phenomenon is due to a double mutation in the anthocyanin 5-O-glucosyltransferase gene of V. vinifera. In the mid-20th century, French ampelographers used this knowledge to test the various vine varieties throughout France to identify which vineyards still contained non-vinifera plantings. Red-berried Pinot grape varieties are also known to not synthesize para-coumaroylated or acetylated anthocyanins as other varieties do. Tempranillo has a high pH level which means that there is a higher concentration of blue and colorless anthocyanin pigments in the wine. The resulting wine's coloring will have more blue hues than bright ruby red hues. The color variation in the finished red wine is partly derived from the ionization of anthocyanin pigments caused by the acidity of the wine. In this case, the three types of anthocyanin pigments are red, blue and colorless with the concentration of those various pigments dictating the color of the wine. A wine with low pH (and such greater acidity) will have a higher occurrence of ionized anthocyanins which will increase the amount of bright red pigments. Wines with a higher pH will have a higher concentration of blue and colorless pigments. As the wine ages, anthocyanins will react with other acids and compounds in wines such as tannins, pyruvic acid and acetaldehyde which will change the color of the wine, causing it to develop more \\"brick red\\" hues. These molecules will link up to create polymers that eventually exceed their solubility and become sediment at the bottom of wine bottles. Pyranoanthocyanins are chemical compounds formed in red wines by yeast during fermentation processes or during controlled oxygenation processes during the aging of wine.  Tannins  Tannins refer to the diverse group of chemical compounds in wine that can affect the color, aging ability and texture of the wine. While tannins cannot be smelled or tasted, they can be perceived during wine tasting by the tactile drying sensation and sense of bitterness that they can leave in the mouth. This is due to the tendency of tannins to react with proteins, such as the ones found in saliva. In food and wine pairing, foods that are high in proteins (such as red meat) are often paired with tannic wines to minimize the astringency of tannins. However, many wine drinkers find the perception of tannins to be a positive trait‚Äîespecially as it relates to mouthfeel. The management of tannins in the winemaking process is a key component in the resulting quality.J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pg 680 Oxford University Press 2006 Tannins are found in the skin, stems, and seeds of wine grapes but can also be introduced to the wine through the use of oak barrels and chips or with the addition of tannin powder. The natural tannins found in grapes are known as proanthocyanidins due to their ability to release red anthocyanin pigments when they are heated in an acidic solution. Grape extracts are mainly rich in monomers and small oligomers (mean degree of polymerization < 8). Grape seed extracts contain three monomers (catechin, epicatechin and epicatechin gallate) and procyanidin oligomers. Grape skin extracts contain four monomers (catechin, epicatechin, gallocatechin and epigallocatechin), as well as procyanidins and prodelphinidins oligomers. The tannins are formed by enzymes during metabolic processes of the grapevine. The amount of tannins found naturally in grapes varies depending on the variety with Cabernet Sauvignon, Nebbiolo, Syrah and Tannat being 4 of the most tannic grape varieties. The reaction of tannins and anthocyanins with the phenolic compound catechins creates another class of tannins known as pigmented tannins which influence the color of red wine.Compositional investigation of pigmented tannin. Kennedy James A. and Hayasaka Yoji, A.C.S. symposium series, 2004, vol. 886, pp. 247-264, Commercial preparations of tannins, known as enological tannins, made from oak wood, grape seed and skin, plant gall, chestnut, quebracho, gambierIdentification of the origin of commercial enological tannins by the analysis of monosaccharides and polyalcohols. Luz Sanz M., Martinez-Castro Isabel and Moreno-Arribas M. Victoria, Food chemistry, 2008, vol. 111, no3, pp. 778-783, and myrobalan fruits, can be added at different stages of the wine production to improve color durability. The tannins derived from oak influence are known as \\"hydrolysable tannins\\" being created from the ellagic and gallic acid found in the wood. Fermenting with the stem, seeds and skin will increase the tannin content of the wine. In the vineyards, there is also a growing distinction being made between \\"ripe\\" and \\"unripe\\" tannins present in the grape. This \\"physiological ripeness\\", which is roughly determined by tasting the grapes off the vines, is being used along with sugar levels as a determination of when to harvest. The idea is that \\"riper\\" tannins will taste softer but still impart some of the texture components found favorable in wine. In winemaking, the amount of the time that the must spends in contact with the grape skins, stems and seeds will influence the amount of tannins that are present in the wine with wines subjected to longer maceration period having more tannin extract. Following harvest, stems are normally picked out and discarded prior to fermentation but some winemakers may intentionally leave in a few stems for varieties low in tannins (like Pinot noir) in order to increase the tannic extract in the wine. If there is an excess in the amount of tannins in the wine, winemakers can use various fining agents like albumin, casein and gelatin that can bind to tannins molecule and precipitate them out as sediments. As a wine ages, tannins will form long polymerized chains which come across to a taster as \\"softer\\" and less tannic. This process can be accelerated by exposing the wine to oxygen, which oxidize tannins to quinone-like compounds that are polymerization-prone. The winemaking technique of micro-oxygenation and decanting wine use oxygen to partially mimic the effect of aging on tannins. A study in wine production and consumption has shown that tannins, in the form of proanthocyanidins, have a beneficial effect on vascular health. The study showed that tannins suppressed production of the peptide responsible for hardening arteries. To support their findings, the study also points out that wines from the regions of southwest France and Sardinia are particularly rich in proanthocyanidins, and that these regions also produce populations with longer life spans. Reactions of tannins with the phenolic compound anthocyanidins creates another class of tannins known as pigmented tannins which influences the color of red wine. = Addition of enological tannins = Commercial preparations of tannins, known as enological tannins, made from oak wood, grape seed and skin, plant gall, chestnut, quebracho, gambier and myrobalan fruits, can be added at different stages of the wine production to improve color durability. = Effects of tannins on the drinkability and aging potential of wine = Tannins are a natural preservative in wine. Un-aged wines with high tannin content can be less palatable than wines with a lower level of tannins. Tannins can be described as leaving a dry and puckered feeling with a \\"furriness\\" in the mouth that can be compared to a stewed tea, which is also very tannic. This effect is particularly profound when drinking tannic wines without the benefit of food. Many wine lovers see natural tannins (found particularly in varietals such as Cabernet Sauvignon and often accentuated by heavy oak barrel aging) as a sign of potential longevity and ageability. Tannins impart a mouth-puckering astringency when the wine is young but \\"resolve\\" (through a chemical process called polymerization) into delicious and complex elements of \\"bottle bouquet\\" when the wine is cellared under appropriate temperature conditions, preferably in the range of a constant .Wine Lovers Page - Wine Lexicon: Tannic, tannis Such wines mellow and improve with age with the tannic \\"backbone\\" helping the wine survive for as long as 40 years or more. In many regions (such as in Bordeaux), tannic grapes such as Cabernet Sauvignon are blended with lower- tannin grapes such as Merlot or Cabernet Franc, diluting the tannic characteristics. White wines and wines that are vinified to be drunk young (for examples, see nouveau wines) typically have lower tannin levels. = Other flavonoids = Flavan-3-ols (catechins) are flavonoids that contribute to the construction of various tannins and contribute to the perception of bitterness in wine. They are found in highest concentrations in grape seeds but are also in the skin and stems. Catechins play a role in the microbial defense of the grape berry, being produced in higher concentrations by the grape vines when it is being attacked by grape diseases such as downy mildew. Because of that grape vines in cool, damp climates produce catechins at high levels than vines in dry, hot climates. Together with anthocyanins and tannins they increase the stability of a wines color-meaning that a wine will be able to maintain its coloring for a longer period of time. The amount of catechins present varies among grape varieties with varietals like Pinot noir having high concentrations while Merlot and especially Syrah have very low levels. As an antioxidant, there are some studies into the health benefits of moderate consumption of wines high in catechins.J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pg 144 Oxford University Press 2006 In red grapes, the main flavonol is on average quercetin, followed by myricetin, kaempferol, laricitrin, isorhamnetin, and syringetin. In white grapes, the main flavonol is quercetin, followed by kaempferol and isorhamnetin. The delphinidin-like flavonols myricetin, laricitrin, and syringetin are missing in all white varieties, indicating that the enzyme flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylase is not expressed in white grape varieties.

The four most abundant ones are the tartaric acid esters trans-caftaric, cis- and trans-coutaric, and trans-fertaric acids. In wine they are present also in the free form (trans-caffeic, trans-p-coumaric, and trans-ferulic acids).  Stilbenoids  V. vinifera also produces stilbenoids. Resveratrol is found in highest concentration in the skins of wine grapes. The accumulation in ripe berries of different concentrations of both bound and free resveratrols depends on the maturity level and is highly variable according to the genotype. Both red and white wine grape varieties contain resveratrol, but more frequent skin contact and maceration leads to red wines normally having ten times more resveratrol than white wines. Resveratrol produced by grape vines provides defense against microbes, and production can be further artificially stimulated by ultraviolet radiation. Grapevines in cool, damp regions with higher risk of grape diseases, such as Bordeaux and Burgundy, tend to produce grapes with higher levels of resveratrol than warmer, drier wine regions such as California and Australia. Different grape varieties tend to have differing levels, with Muscadines and the Pinot family having high levels while the Cabernet family has lower levels of resveratrol. In the late 20th century interest in the possible health benefits of resveratrol in wine was spurred by discussion of the French paradox involving the health of wine drinkers in France.J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pg 569 Oxford University Press 2006 Piceatannol is also present in grape from where it can be extracted and found in red wine.  Phenolic acids  Vanillin is a phenolic aldehyde most commonly associated with the vanilla notes in wines that have been aged in oak. Trace amounts of vanillin are found naturally in grapes, but they are most prominent in the lignin structure of oak barrels. Newer barrels will impart more vanillin, with the concentration present decreasing with each subsequent usage.J.

Oak barrel will add compounds such as vanillin and hydrolysable tannins (ellagitannins). The hydrolyzable tannins present in oak are derived from lignin structures in the wood. They help protect the wine from oxidation and reduction.J.

Natural phenols and polyphenols from cork stoppers  Extracted cork closure inscribed with \\"Bottled at origin\\" in Spanish Low molecular weight polyphenols, as well as ellagitannins, are susceptible to be extracted from cork stoppers into the wine., The identified polyphenols are gallic, protocatechuic, vanillic, caffeic, ferulic, and ellagic acids; protocatechuic, vanillic, coniferyl, and sinapic aldehydes; the coumarins aesculetin and scopoletin; the ellagitannins are roburins A and E, grandinin, vescalagin and castalagin.

He was murdered in 1998 at around 9:30 pm in Siphal, Kathmandu in Nepal, at the time of Football World Cup. Background Hailing from Deoria near Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh, Mirza began his forays into the underworld around late eighties. He grew in notoriety through car thefts, assault, kidnapping and of course murders; he later thought of his antecedents as petty crimes. Involvement with the underworld Mirza's graduation to the big league began after a chance meeting with Dawood Ibrahim in Mumbai in the early eighties, when both were struggling to carve a niche for themselves in India. Besides Dawood, Mirza also had links with Chhota Rajan, Chhota Shakeel, the brothers Amar and Ashwin Naik and members of the Pathan syndicate. However, he shot to prominence only after his association with Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence operatives in India and Nepal. The porous Indo- Nepal border helped him sneak in and out of his home state and into Nepal. From then on, his notoriety grew so much that the UP police announced a reward for his arrest. Political career in Nepal Beg, the elusive crook found Kathmandu safer than UP. Dawood's reputation of transforming crooks into kings in India also helped him in Nepal. Playing the communal card in the election, Mirza represented the Muslim minority in Hindu Nepal and won with a thumping majority. Beg had been elected to the House of Representatives from the Terai district of Kapilvastu in 1994 and held ministerial portfolios in two governments. He resigned from the Nepal Sadbhawana Party, and joined the Rashtriya Prajatantra Party, winning two consecutive terms from the Kapilavastu constituency in south-west Nepal. Finally, his shady past became his nemesis and began to erode his popularity as a politician. Mumbai's Crime Branch officers believed that Mirza regularly used his Krishna Nagar mansion to shelter gangsters on the run from Indian enforcement agencies. His residence was also used for other illegal activities including confinement of abductees, drug-trafficking, gun-running and forging of documents. He was so effective that Dawood, whose reach had spread from Dubai to Karachi and Colombo to London, regarded Kathmandu as his strongest base. In fact the mafia don even considered shifting to Kathmandu for a while, following the Gulshan Kumar murder. The Indian government had tried to extradite his lieutenant Abu Salem for the murder and had turned the heat on the UAE government to secure Salem's custody. However, it was Mirza's declining clout which forced him to change his mind, making him opt for the ISI sanctuary in Karachi. Mirza's greed turned him towards gun-running, smuggling arms procured from the Afghan Mujahedins and the ISI, into India. Mirza's exploits allegedly include an aborted bid on the life of UP Chief Minister Kalyan Singh in Nainital. Mirza's murder had also stunned the Mumbai underworld as most fugitives had, at some point in time, used Mirza's good offices for passage out of the country. Murder Mirza Dilshad Beg was shot dead on June 29, 1998 around 9:30 pm as he was on his way to visit his second wife in Siphal, Chabahil area. As he climbed from his car and was walking towards the residence, killers gunned him down. His driver, who was parking the car, was also killed. In an interview published in the Indian newsmagazine India Today, Rajendra Sadashiv Nikhalje, alias Chhota Rajan, took the responsibility of killing Beg and alleged that \\"through the ISI, he (Beg) was spreading terror in India\\". Murder theories The intelligence reports available with the Indian Authorities, list three reasons why Beg was being targeted. Firstly, while Beg had initially helped Babloo Srivastava obtain a Nepalese passport, he did not come to his rescue when he was eventually arrested in Singapore in 1995. {Babloo Srivastava's} Nepalese citizenship was cancelled and he was handed over to the Indian authorities. Secondly, following Gulshan Kumar's killing in Mumbai, the main hit-man Vikram Wahi  a close associate of Babloo Srivastava  had absconded to Kathmandu and his local hideout was raided by the Nepal police. Even as the modalities for Wahi's surrender were being worked out, his dead body  hacked into pieces  was recovered at the Indo-Nepal border near Krishnanagar. Besides Babloo Srivastava, Wahi's associates including Karan Singh Magga  who was to eventually gun down Beg on 29 June 1998 along with underworld don Chhota Rajan's associate, Rohit Verma  harbored a grudge against him. The third angle to the Nepal MP's killing, the intelligence report states, related to Shafi Mohammad Khan of Krishnanagar who was arrested in a narcotics case by the Nepal Police in Mumbai. Like Babloo Srivastava, he too was of the view that Mirza had made no efforts to secure his release after arrest nor was he extended sufficient help during his trial. This, along with the internecine gang wars between Chota Rajan and Dawood Ibrahim were the main reasons for Mirza's murder. Chhota Rajan is believed to have contacted Rohit Verma in Nepal to organise the killing and advised him not to strike in Kathmandu. Babloo Srivastava then contacted Shafi Mohammad and gave him some money to arrange for a safe house in Kathmandu. Despite taking the money, Shafi was not able to find the place. The gang made its first attempt on Beg on 27 June 1998 and finally succeeded two days later when the MP was shot six or seven times before he finally collapsed, ending a bloody chapter of the Mumbai mafia's free run in the Himalayan kingdom. In an interview to MiD DAY, Farid Tanasha, a key lieutenant of Chhota Rajan, admitted to being one of the main architects of the murder of Nepal's member of Parliament, Mirza Dilshad Baig who was killed in Kathmandu in 1998.

Research in polyhedral combinatorics falls into two distinct areas. Mathematicians in this area study the combinatorics of polytopes; for instance, they seek inequalities that describe the relations between the numbers of vertices, edges, and faces of higher dimensions in arbitrary polytopes or in certain important subclasses of polytopes, and study other combinatorial properties of polytopes such as their connectivity and diameter (number of steps needed to reach any vertex from any other vertex). Additionally, many computer scientists use the phrase ‚Äúpolyhedral combinatorics‚Äù to describe research into precise descriptions of the faces of certain specific polytopes (especially 0-1 polytopes, whose vertices are subsets of a hypercube) arising from integer programming problems.

A face of a convex polytope P may be defined as the intersection of P and a closed halfspace H such that the boundary of H contains no interior point of P. The dimension of a face is the dimension of this hull. The 0-dimensional faces are the vertices themselves, and the 1-dimensional faces (called edges) are line segments connecting pairs of vertices.

The faces of P may be partially ordered by inclusion, forming a face lattice that has as its top element P itself and as its bottom element the empty set. A key tool in polyhedral combinatorics is the ∆í-vector of a polytope,, pp. 245‚Äì246. the vector (f0, f1, ..., fd ‚àí 1) where fi is the number of i-dimensional features of the polytope. For instance, a cube has eight vertices, twelve edges, and six facets, so its ∆í-vector is (8,12,6). The dual polytope has a ∆í-vector with the same numbers in the reverse order; thus, for instance, the regular octahedron, the dual to a cube, has the ∆í-vector (6,12,8). Configuration matrices include the f-vectors of regular polytopes as diagonal elements. The extended ∆í-vector is formed by concatenating the number one at each end of the ∆í-vector, counting the number of objects at all levels of the face lattice; on the left side of the vector, f‚àí1 = 1 counts the empty set as a face, while on the right side, fd = 1 counts P itself. For the cube the extended ∆í-vector is (1,8,12,6,1) and for the octahedron it is (1,6,12,8,1). Although the vectors for these example polyhedra are unimodal (the coefficients, taken in left to right order, increase to a maximum and then decrease), there are higher-dimensional polytopes for which this is not true., p. 272. For simplicial polytopes (polytopes in which every facet is a simplex), it is often convenient to transform these vectors, producing a different vector called the h-vector. If we interpret the terms of the ∆í-vector (omitting the final 1) as coefficients of a polynomial ∆í(x) = Œ£fixd ‚àí i ‚àí 1 (for instance, for the octahedron this gives the polynomial ∆í(x) = x3 + 6x2 + 12x + 8), then the h-vector lists the coefficients of the polynomial h(x) = ∆í(x ‚àí 1) (again, for the octahedron, h(x) = x3 + 3x2 + 3x + 1)., pp. 246‚Äì253. As Ziegler writes, ‚Äúfor various problems about simplicial polytopes, h-vectors are a much more convenient and concise way to encode the information about the face numbers than ∆í-vectors.‚Äù Equalities and inequalities The most important relation among the coefficients of the ∆í-vector of a polytope is Euler's formula Œ£(‚àí1)ifi = 0, where the terms of the sum range over the coefficients of the extended ∆í-vector. In three dimensions, moving the two 1's at the left and right ends of the extended ∆í-vector (1, v, e, f, 1) to the right hand side of the equation transforms this identity into the more familiar form v ‚àí e + f = 2. From the fact that each facet of a three- dimensional polyhedron has at least three edges, it follows by double counting that 2e ‚â• 3f, and using this inequality to eliminate e and f from Euler's formula leads to the further inequalities e ‚â§ 3v ‚àí 6 and f ‚â§ 2v ‚àí 4. By duality, e ‚â§ 3f ‚àí 6 and v ‚â§ 2f ‚àí 4. It follows from Steinitz's theorem that any 3-dimensional integer vector satisfying these equalities and inequalities is the ∆í-vector of a convex polyhedron.. In higher dimensions, other relations among the numbers of faces of a polytope become important as well, including the Dehn‚ÄìSommerville equations which, expressed in terms of h-vectors of simplicial polytopes, take the simple form hk = hd ‚àí k for all k. The instance of these equations with k = 0 is equivalent to Euler's formula but for d > 3 the other instances of these equations are linearly independent of each other and constrain the h-vectors (and therefore also the ∆í-vectors) in additional ways. Another important inequality on polytope face counts is given by the upper bound theorem, first proven by , which states that a d-dimensional polytope with n vertices can have at most as many faces of any other dimension as a neighborly polytope with the same number of vertices: :f_{k-1} \\\\le \\\\sum_{i=0}^{d/2} {}^* \\\\left( \\\\binom{d-i}{k-i}+\\\\binom{i}{k-d+i} \\\\right) \\\\binom{n-d-1+i}{i}, where the asterisk means that the final term of the sum should be halved when d is even., pp. 254‚Äì258. Asymptotically, this implies that there are at most \\\\scriptstyle O(n^{\\\\lfloor d/2\\\\rfloor}) faces of all dimensions. Even in four dimensions, the set of possible ∆í-vectors of convex polytopes does not form a convex subset of the four-dimensional integer lattice, and much remains unknown about the possible values of these vectors.. Graph-theoretic properties Along with investigating the numbers of faces of polytopes, researchers have studied other combinatorial properties of them, such as descriptions of the graphs obtained from the vertices and edges of polytopes (their 1-skeleta). Balinski's theorem states that the graph obtained in this way from any d-dimensional convex polytope is d-vertex-connected.; , pp. 95‚Äì96. In the case of three-dimensional polyhedra, this property and planarity may be used to exactly characterize the graphs of polyhedra: Steinitz's theorem states that G is the skeleton of a three-dimensional polyhedron if and only if G is a 3-vertex-connected planar graph., pp. 103‚Äì126. A theorem of (previously conjectured by Micha Perles) states that one can reconstruct the face structure of a simple polytope from its graph. That is, if a given undirected graph is the skeleton of a simple polytope, there is only one polytope (up to combinatorial equivalence) for which this is true. This is in sharp contrast with (non-simple) neighborly polytopes whose graph is a complete graph; there can be many different neighborly polytopes for the same graph. Another proof of this theorem based on unique sink orientations was given by , and showed how to use this theorem to derive a polynomial time algorithm for reconstructing the face lattices of simple polytopes from their graphs. However, testing whether a given graph or lattice can be realized as the face lattice of a simple polytope is equivalent (by polarity) to realization of simplicial polytopes, which was shown to be complete for the existential theory of the reals by . In the context of the simplex method for linear programming, it is important to understand the diameter of a polytope, the minimum number of edges needed to reach any vertex by a path from any other vertex. The system of linear inequalities of a linear program define facets of a polytope representing all feasible solutions to the program, and the simplex method finds the optimal solution by following a path in this polytope. Thus, the diameter provides a lower bound on the number of steps this method requires. The Hirsch conjecture, now disproved, suggested a strong bound on how large the diameter could be. Weaker (quasi-polynomial) upper bounds on the diameter are known, as well as proofs of the Hirsch conjecture for special classes of polytope. Computational properties Deciding whether the number of vertices of a given polytope is bounded by some natural number k is a computationally difficult problem and complete for the complexity class PP. Facets of 0-1 polytopes It is important in the context of cutting- plane methods for integer programming to be able to describe accurately the facets of polytopes that have vertices corresponding to the solutions of combinatorial optimization problems. Often, these problems have solutions that can be described by binary vectors, and the corresponding polytopes have vertex coordinates that are all zero or one. As an example, consider the Birkhoff polytope, the set of n √ó n matrices that can be formed from convex combinations of permutation matrices. Equivalently, its vertices can be thought of as describing all perfect matchings in a complete bipartite graph, and a linear optimization problem on this polytope can be interpreted as a bipartite minimum weight perfect matching problem. The Birkhoff‚Äìvon Neumann theorem states that this polytope can be described by two types of linear inequality or equality. First, for each matrix cell, there is a constraint that this cell has a non-negative value. And second, for each row or column of the matrix, there is a constraint that the sum of the cells in that row or column equal one. The row and column constraints define a linear subspace of dimension n2 ‚àí 2n + 1 in which the Birkhoff polytope lies, and the non- negativity constraints define facets of the Birkhoff polytope within that subspace. However, the Birkhoff polytope is unusual in that a complete description of its facets is available. For many other 0-1 polytopes, there are exponentially many or superexponentially many facets, and only partial descriptions of their facets are available..

It is opposite L√•ngholmen island (home to L√•ngholmen prison until 1975). The property was bought in 1669 by Jonas √ñsterling and was used by the Swedish tobacco manufacturing company (Tobakskompaniet) for tobacco production. However, after a conflict with both the company and the royal court, √ñsterling went bankrupt and died in poverty in 1691. His estate was burnt down in 1701. From 1739 to 1759 the estate was owned by Olof Forsberg, who produced white clay pipes on the premises. Adolph Christiernin bought the property in 1759 and continued clay pipe production until 1766. He was a very wealthy man who spent his entire fortune on a fixed idea that he could find gold in the Swedish silver mines. He named the property Heleneborg after his wife Helena Catharina Malmin. Miserably poor, he had to abandon Heleneborg in 1767. In the 1860s Heleneborg was owned by W.N. Burmester, who housed the manufacturer and inventor Immanuel Nobel on the premises. There his son Alfred Nobel and Alfred's brothers experimented with the safe handling of the explosive nitroglycerin. After a big explosion in this plant on September 3, 1864, which killed the youngest brother, Emil Oskar Nobel, Alfred Nobel created the Alfred Nobel & Company in Germany to continue his work in more isolated circumstances. In 1874 captain Johan Adolf Berg bought the estate and renovated it to its present appearance. After his death, his widow sold Heleneborg in 1906 and the grounds were divided into lots for construction of apartment houses. Only the main building of Heleneborg was left, and today it can still be seen next to S√∂der M√§larstrand, close to V√§sterbron. Heleneborg has given its name to the close-by street Heleneborgsgatan.

Klaus Camp Klaus is situated within a wooded valley approximately NW of Colesburg, Iowa. The camp is approximately . Camp C.S. Klaus has a large grass parade grounds area where the Lyon's Camp Office is located. This area has proven itself as a great location for activities and games. The parade grounds also provides a place for Scout troops to camp during the off-season. =Geography= The waterfalls within the camp are the source of Brownfield Creek, a trout stream that flows into a man made lake known as Lake John Deere. Many of the aquatics programs (canoeing, sailing, swimming, snorkeling, kayaking) offered at summer camp take place here. The lake is also known to have fish. Fishing for bassets, greengill and sour krout is quite common. C.S. Klaus has a rustic dining hall that can seat approximately 200 people. The kitchen is fairly modern (renovated in 1998). The dining hall area is also utilized for winter camping. Scattered along the road as you continue up the hill are the seven main campsites. Each campsite has running water, plat-forms for tents, latrine facilities, fire rings and several picnic tables. At the top of the hill is also a modern shower building with 12 individual shower units. To the north of Lake John Deere lies the shooting sports range. In the late 1990s, this area was completely rebuilt, thanks to a large donation from the Dubuque Optimists Club, with a new rifle shooting range, new archery range, and improved shotgun range. On the western edge of the lake is the Climbing and Rappelling Tower. This 4-story structure sits prominently overlooking the lake. The rappelling tower offers rappels of , and 8 different climbing areas, including 2 inverted climbs and a chimney climb. The newest addition to the camp is the backyard also known as the valley. Purchased with donations from over 120 individuals and local businesses, this land was dedicated in 2006. The Backyard abuts the NE corner of the main camp. This piece of land is home to many new programs. This area is also home to the ice cave that Scouts have been visiting for decades. This area is often utilized for wilderness survival, leave-no-trace camping, hiking, nature study, star-gazing, viewing wildlife and a competition level Navigation Course for teaching orienteering with a map and compass and GPS navigation.C.S.Klaus =Improvements= Over the last 15 years, Camp C.S.

Balloon releases can be done as a prayer ceremony, to create a photo opportunity, to raise awareness of a cause or campaign, or as a competitive long-distance race. There is considerable opposition to, and legislation against, balloon releases, due to environmental, flight safety, and wildlife conservation issues.  Motivations  Tricolour balloons released in the sky after the Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh's address to the Nation from Red Fort, on the occasion of 62nd Independence Day of India, in Delhi on August 15, 2008 Akin to a sky lantern ceremony of Chinese tradition, a group balloon release can serve as a quiet, prayerful group activity at a funeral or solemn occasion. Unlike sky lanterns, which float down after a short time, helium or hydrogen balloons quickly rise to heights in which they can no longer be seen. Balloon releases are also used in celebration, as a substitute to confetti, in order to avoid an immediate mess. A balloon race, or balloon flight contest, is a competition wherein the competitors attempt to send balloons as far as possible. It can be compared to a rubber duck race. Postcards are attached to the balloons which are then released. The flight of the balloons cannot be influenced by the competitors. Instead, success in the contest is dependent on the wind conditions and on the location in which the balloon lands. The contest depends on the goodwill of passers-by to find the balloons and return the postcards. A prize may be awarded to the person whose balloon travels the furthest. Trajectory Helium balloons are claimed to reach a height of anywhere up to ten kilometres.What happens to helium balloons when they float into the sky?- Surfing Scientist It is also possible for a balloon, under the right circumstances, to reach equilibrium, and remain suspended in the air for some time, until the helium slowly diffuses out of the balloon. A balloon launched from a school in Derby, England in December 2012 was found in Sydney, Australia in March 2013 having travelled .  Noted balloon releases  2011: A farmer from Stalisfield Green near Ashford in Kent, England, successfully claimed compensation, after one of his bullocks choked to death on the string of a balloon released by pupils at Lyndhurst Primary School in Camberwell, south-east London, over 50 miles away, as part of a Comic Relief event. * 2016: In 2008 Radio City 2‚Äîa radio station in Liverpool, England‚Äîstarted annually releasing hundreds of balloons (with messages attached) from the roof of the Radio City 2 \\"in memory of loved ones that we miss at Christmas time.\\" Despite sustained lobbying by the public in December 2016, DJ Pete Price ignored the pleas and the balloon release went ahead at the end of the programme 'Remember A Loved One At Christmas'. Two leading diving journalists contacted Radio City 2's owner‚ÄîBauer Media Group‚Äîappealing for this practice to be stopped. Bauer Media confirmed that no company within the Group would conduct a balloon release in the future and a donation would be made to Greenpeace. * 2017: A three-year-old thoroughbred horse, 'Espoiro', known as 'Feisty', died as a direct result of a helium party balloon landing in her field. Her owner Jennifer Birtwhistle (a leading horse breeder) told Horse & Hound magazine \\"God isn't sitting in his heaven gathering up all this airborne litter that is sent up with messages attached to it on pieces of string. It doesn't reach anyone, it is entirely self serving.\\" * 2017: In March 2017 Poundbakery headquarters released 500 orange and black balloons. Each balloon contained a voucher for a 'Go Large' free Poundbakery sandwich. Poundbakery subsequently apologised on 11 April 2017 and donated ¬£1,000 to the British Divers Marine Life Rescue. * 2018: In February 2018 Quartz Travel announced they would \\"work with Greenpeace to release 500 biodegradable balloons filled with messages as part of a campaign to reduce plastic pollution at sea.\\" Following mass lobbying by the public Quartz Travel (a British-based travel agent) subsequently cancelled the balloon release on 13 February 2018. * 2018: In February 2018 EastEnders released balloons during an episode of the soap to mark the death of a character. This occurred three days after the BBC's Director-General announced a three-step plan to remove single- use plastic from operations. \\"Like millions of people watching Blue Planet II, I was shocked to see the avoidable waste and harm created by single-use plastic.

One-and-a-half million balloons were released, but an approaching weather front caused them to return to earth, covering the city in balloons, causing cars to crash, and hindering a coast guard rescue mission. It contributed to the deaths of two sailors on Lake Erie (the wife of one victim sued the organizers, and settled out-of-court), resulted in injuries to horses, and caused traffic accidents. A runway at Burke Lakefront Airport had to be closed. The Guinness Book of Records no longer accepts balloon release records.

Included in their list of \\"Smart Balloon Practices\\" is the message that balloons are \\"Worth the Weight,\\" meaning that all balloons should be tied to a weight and not released outdoors. The campaign to end the release of balloons includes the hashtag #BeBalloonSmart and a cartoon character named Faraday, named after Michael Faraday, the inventor of the rubber balloon. http://www.theballooncouncil.org/smart-balloon-practices/ =United Kingdom= In the United Kingdom, the National Association of Balloon Artists and Suppliers (NABAS) provide guidelines for appropriate balloon releases in order to minimize potential environmental impacts. These guidelines include the limit to the number of balloons that should be released, releasing only balloons made from appropriate material, and that no materials such as ribbons or strings are included or attached to the end of any balloons that are released.  Opposition  Balloon remains in the branches of a chestnut tree =Environmental= A number of organisations (for example, in the United Kingdom, these include the Marine Conservation Society,UK Rivers Network; Balloon releases: pollution factsheet the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the Tidy Britain Group, the National Farmers' Union and the RSPBRSPB Marine and coastal policy) oppose balloon releases, because of the visual impact of the fallen, deflated balloons, and the risk of harm to wildlife and domestic animals which they pose. For these reasons, balloon releases are prohibited in some jurisdictions.\\"Mass balloon releases banned from Council owned land\\" Plymouth City Council, England, news releaseReleases of 20 or more balloons are prohibited in the state of New South Wales, Australia, under section 146E of the NSW Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997 In May 2018 a peer-reviewed study by Delia M. Webb was published that revealed 2,223 pieces of balloon litter were found on 39 beaches across Cornwall between July and December 2016. The study entitled \\"Just a balloon? A local study of the extent and impacts of balloon litter on beaches\\" reported that some of the balloons found on Cornish beaches had travelled from other parts of the UK, Ireland and Europe.Delia M. Webb Just a balloon? A local study of the extent and impacts of balloon litter on beaches Journal of Litter and Environmental Quality =Flight safety= Within many countries written permission is often required from the relevant airspace regulatory authority. In the UK this would be the Civil Aviation Authority, for releases over a certain number of balloons. =Overhead power lines= On 9 February 2018 rush-hour trains near Billericay, Essex were disrupted for more than two hours because 50 yellow and black balloons were tangled on overhead lines. =Helium scarcity= Helium is a natural atmospheric gas, but as a land-resource, it is limited. As of 2012 the United States National Helium Reserve accounted for 30 percent of the world's helium, and was expected to run out of helium in 2018. Some geophysicists fear the world's helium could be gone in a generation. For this reason, balloon releases are seen as a wasteful use of this limited resource. =Films= The film Rubber Jellyfish made its European and UK debut on 14 March 2019 in Wimborne, Dorset.Rosemary E Lunn 'Rubber Jellyfish' film to get European debut X-Ray Magazine Virtual balloon race As an alternative to a physical balloon race, a virtual balloon race involves imaginary balloons which are \\"launched\\" at a set date and place and allowed to \\"fly\\" for a set period such as a week, their route being calculated by a computer programme according to weather data. Charities can use this as a fund-raiser by allowing supporters to buy balloons and compete in the \\"race\\", with no harm done to wildlife or the planet. As no physical contact is involved this fund-raising method was useful for charities during the lockdown of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic when many other fund-raising events had to be cancelled. British marketing company Purepages, based in Bolton, has developed \\"the world's first 100% eco-friendly virtual balloon race platform\\", with software which allows purchasers to adjust the properties of their balloon to influence its prospects.

It was founded on 22 June 1844 in Surat by Durgaram Manchharam Mehta, Dadoba Pandurang Tarkhadkar and a few others. The goals of the Sabha were to expose the hypocritical arts present in Christian, Muslim and Hindu religions. It had a very short life span and ceased to exist as Dadoba left for Bombay in 1846 and Durgaram left for Rajkot in 1852.From Plassey to Partition, Sekhara Bandyopadhya, p 153, The main objective of Manav Dharma Sabha was to highlight the positive side of true religion based on truth and morality. The organization accepted the concept of monotheism, a concept which belies in existence of one God only. The organization used to organize public meetings every Sunday in which the speakers used to exhort to give up casteism, to encourage widow remarriages and to stop the practice of idol worship. The main activity of the organization was to abolish superstitious beliefs from the society and to ensure that people do not practice black magic, witchcraft and such other malpractices.

Belton, 453 U.S. 454 (1981), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that when a police officer has made a lawful custodial arrest of the occupant of an automobile, the officer may, as a contemporaneous incident of that arrest, search the passenger compartment of that automobile. Therefore, Belton extended the so-called \\"Chimel rule\\" of searches incident to a lawful arrest, established in Chimel v. California (1969), to vehicles. The Supreme Court sought to establish bright line rules to govern vehicle search incident to eliminate some confusion in the cases. Background A New York State Police trooper stopped a speeding car. No one in the car knew the owner. The officer could smell marijuana, and he saw an envelope on the floor marked \\"Supergold\\" which he could see probably contained marijuana. He ordered the occupants out of the car and arrested them. He patted them down and then directed them to stand apart. He searched the passenger compartment and found cocaine in a pocket of Belton's jacket. The New York Court of Appeals suppressed the search because there no longer was any danger of destruction of evidence. Opinion of the court The Supreme Court noted that \\"no straightforward rule has emerged from the litigated cases respecting the question ... of the proper scope of a search of the interior of an automobile incident to a custodial arrest of its occupants.\\" The Court thus resolved to establish a definitive rule and held: :Our reading of the cases suggests the generalization that articles inside the relatively narrow compass of the passenger compartment of an automobile are in fact generally, even if not inevitably, within \\"the area into which an arrestee might reach in order to grab a weapon or evidentiary ite[m]. Chimel, supra, at 763. In order to establish the workable rule this category of cases requires, we read Chimels definition of the limits of the area that may be searched in light of that generalization. Accordingly, we hold that when a [police officer] has made a lawful custodial arrest of the occupant of an automobile, [the officer] may, as a contemporaneous incident of that arrest, search the passenger compartment of that automobile. :It follows from this conclusion that the police may also examine the contents of any containers found within the passenger compartment, for if the passenger compartment is within reach of the arrestee, so also will containers in it be within his reach. United States v. Robinson, supra; Draper v. United States, 358 U.S. 307. Such a container may, of course, be searched whether it is open or closed, since the justification for the search is not that the arrestee has no privacy interest in the container, but that the lawful custodial arrest justifies the infringement of any privacy interest the arrestee may have. Thus, while the Court in Chimel held that the police could not search all the drawers in an arrestee's house simply because the police had arrested him at home, the Court noted that drawers within an arrestee's reach could be searched because of the danger their contents might pose to the police. Chimel v. California, supra, at 763. The Court distinguished Chadwick and Sanders as not involving \\"an arguably valid search incident to a lawful custodial arrest.\\" Thus, under Belton, the entire passenger compartment of an automobile is subject to search under the search incident doctrine even if the arrestee is out of the car. A nexus is required between the vehicle and the person arrested with or in the vehicle prior to the arrest. Response to Belton Belton has been criticized by legal scholars for failing to meet the constitutional standard of probable cause. Belton has been distinguished by Arizona v. Gant (2009), which restricted searches incident to arrest to circumstances where it is reasonable to believe that: 1) the arrested individual might access the vehicle at the time of the search; or 2) the arrested individual's vehicle contains evidence of the offense that led to the arrest.* Argued October 7, 2008‚ÄîDecided April 21, 2009.

Specifically, the council includes Scouts from the following parishes: Ascension, East Baton Rouge, West Baton Rouge, East Feliciana, West Feliciana, Iberville, Pointe Coupee, St. Helena, St. James, St. Tammany, Washington, and Tangipahoa. Wilkinson County is the sole Mississippi county in the council. Scouting came to Louisiana shortly after the establishment of the Boy Scouts of America in 1910. Rev. T. M. Hunter of the First Presbyterian Church of Baton Rouge established the first troop in that year, and two years later, affiliated the troop with BSA. The Istrouma Area Council was officially established in 1919. In 1923, the Rotary Club of Baton Rouge presented the council with a campsite in Greenwell Springs called Camp Istrouma.\\"A Century of Scouting,\\" Baton Rouge Advocate, March 7, 2010. http://www.2theadvocate.com/features/86674987.html?showAll=y&c;=y After the council outgrew the camp, they raised money to move to the Avondale Scout Reservation located in East Feliciana Parish, doing so by the late 1950s. Istrouma was later sold to the United Methodist Church and serves as a Christian camp to this day. Organization The council is administratively divided into districts: * Avondale District‚Äîincludes East and West Feliciana Parishes, northern portion of East Baton Rouge Parish, Pointe Coupee Parish, and Wilkinson County, Mississippi * Bogue Tuchenna District‚Äîincludes St. Tammany and Washington Parishes * Chappepeela District‚Äîincludes Tangipahoa and eastern Livingston Parishes * Red Stick District‚Äîincludes inner-city Baton Rouge, primarily at-risk youths * Tunica District‚Äîincludes portions of East Baton Rouge and Livingston Parishes * Sewell-Eagle District‚Äîincludes North and South Baton Rouge * Cypress Chauve District‚Äîincludes Ascension and portions of St. James and Iberville Parishes * Exploring District‚Äîincludes Explorer Posts in Greater Baton Rouge * Operation First Class District‚Äîincludes Learning for Life Units Programs and activities Istrouma Area Council participates in various activities, primarily in and around Baton Rouge. Since 1935, Scouts from the council serve as ushers and stretcher bearers at LSU home football games at Tiger Stadium. Each district holds an annual Camporee at Camp Avondale in the spring, and most districts hold Cub Scout Day Camps for a week at various locales within their district. Each district also holds a district Pinewood Derby event for Cub Scouts. Avondale Scout Reservation Avondale Scout Reservation is a reservation for Scouting located in East Feliciana Parish, three miles (5 km) east of Clinton, on Louisiana Highway 10. It opened in 1959 and became the default campground for Istrouma after Camp Istrouma could no longer serve the needs of the council. There are five camping areas: Camp Avondale, Camp Hunter, McGee camping area, Tigator camping area, and Woodbadge Hill. The main camping area, Camp Avondale, is located at the north end of the reservation and is closest to the front entrance and ranger's houses on Highway 10. There are 17 campsites with a capacity for 360 campers. Most campsites are named after various birds, Indian tribes, and wildlife. The campsites are adjacent to Lake Istrouma with its swimming and canoeing facilities. A dining hall overlooks the lake. Camp Hunter is located 1/2 miles west of Lake Istrouma directly south of the front entrance of the reservation. It has nine campsites. The McGee camping area is at the south end of the reservation just inside of the back gate on Louisiana Highway 63. There are 26 campsites surrounding Lake McGee and south of Lake Tigator, all named after cities and towns represented by the council. The Tigator camping area has fourteen campsites north of Tigator Lake and has two buildings: Perkins Lodge and the Long House. The water tank near campsite 3 (Natchez) is the highest point on the reservation. Woodbadge Hill is located one-quarter mile southwest of Lake Istrouma and has ten campsites. Camp Avondale hosts week-long summer camps for Boy Scouts in June in which Scouts can earn merit badges, participate in COPE, First Year Scouting, Shooting Scope, Aquatic, and various other activities. In conjunction with Boy Scout Camps, there are Webelos Resident Camps held in June. Other annual events include, but are not limited to: Winter Camp (held during the week between Christmas and New Year's Day), Brownsea Training for youth leaders, The camp sports a dining hall, which has been referred to as \\"Roadkill Cafe\\" since the early 2000s. In addition, there is, among other buildings, an outdoor chapel, rifle and shotgun shooting ranges, an archery range, boat dock, blacksmith's shop, and trading post. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, efforts have been made to improve this campground. In 2001, the Manship family of Baton Rouge built a campground to accommodate handicapped Scouts. Since then, private restrooms and showers, running water, improved sewage and plumbing, better roads, and electricity have all been added to campsites for use by Scouts and Scouters.Campsite opens at Avondale - Manship site part of bigger scheme, Baton Rouge Advocate, August 12, 2001. In addition, existing buildings have been renovated and expanded. The southern part of the Avondale Scout Reservation, specifically, the area around Lakes Tigator and McGee, is used by Cub Scouts. In the early 2000s, Family Cub World was created in this area and includes numerous activity sites for Cub Scouts, as well as a dining hall, chapel, and cabines. Camp Carruth Camp Carruth is located in West Baton Rouge Parish off Rosedale Road (). Istrouma Area Council purchased the land in the late 1990s, and this campsite is used by Cub Scout and Boy Scout Units for both day events and overnight tent camping. Quinipissa Lodge Quinipissa Lodge #479 is used by the local Order of the Arrow units.

History  Elcot Park estate was purchased by Anthony Bushby Bacon (1772? - 1827), the son of a wealthy Welsh industrialist, from Charles Dundas, 1st Baron Amesbury, a prominent landowner from the neighbouring village of Kintbury.Anthony Bacon's will available at the Berkshire Records Office, document number D/EX1282 He then proceeded to create a small estate, and built the house probably between 1815 and 1825.Bacon's will and the 1822 Kintbury Map, available at the Berkshire Records Office There are gaps in the historical record but this is the most likely date range for the building of the house, and differs from published accounts. There also have been suggestions that Capability Brown was involved in laying out the grounds, but this is unlikely to be correct, despite the fact that the gardens of Elcot Park were laid out in an English Landscape style. The area around the mansion were laid to lawns with clumps of trees, woodland walks and distant views over the Kennet valley. There also was a fine walled kitchen garden with a range of glasshouses, including four greenhouses for vines and peaches, and also a pine pit heated with hot water.Loudon's Gardener's Magazine, 1828, p. 186 Elcot Park was well known, in the nineteenth century, for Bacon's implementation of hot water heating in the glasshouses.Veitch, Journal of the Royal Horitcultural Society, Vol. XI, 1889, p. 123 When Anthony Bacon died in 1827, he was heavily in debt with two mortgages against the house. His son, Charles Bacon, bought the house in 1831 after clearing the debts, but seemed to continue to have financial difficulties as he had to sell the property in 1844. The sale documents from that time still exist that shows that Elcot Park was sold with 122 acres (in contrast with today's 16). Lady Shelly, mother of the great poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, purchased the estate and moved here with her remaining daughters, having suffered the double tragedy of her husband‚Äôs death at Field Place, Sussex and the death by drowning of Percy. The estate was then let for a number of years to various military families until the Shelly family sold their interest in Elcot Park to Sir Richard Vincent Sutton, 6th Baronet in 1899. Sir Richard‚Äôs main seat was Benham Park, and the land attached to Elcot at that time adjoined Benham Valence. Elcot Park was again let for a further 25 years to a prominent JP by the name of Richard Plaskett Thomas. He held substantial tea plantations in India. The land belonging to Elcot Park then became part of the tenancy for Elcot Farmhouse. The main mansion, parkland and outbuildings forming a separate tenancy. During the early years of the Second World War, a Hampshire family ‚Äì the Bramley Firths from Silchester became tenants. Towards the end of the war, a Mrs Whitehead had taken the tenancy and it was she who first had the initiative to create a ‚Äúletting residence‚Äù. After a long fight to establish a licensed hotel, she finally gave up the struggle whilst in her late fifties. In the late 1940s the property was trading as Elcot Park Hotel & Country Club. Mrs Edith Weston bought the tenancy from Lady Helen De Crespigny in 1949 and continued trading on this basis, linking Elcot with her other family business in London (The Surrey Restaurant in Surrey St, London WC2). Mrs Weston ran it as a successful business with a wide clientele in the neighbourhood, until 1952 when it went into liquidation. The property remained empty for some ten years, until in 1967 a Mr Harold Sterne and his wife June took the tenancy with a serious attempt to create a worthy hotel. There was a programme of development that lasted some 18 years. Mr & Mrs Sterne were given the opportunity to purchase the property outright in 1977 and they continued the business until deciding to retire in 1987. The hotel was purchased by a Mr Katzler and between 1987 and the end of May 1989, the hotel was further extended by the addition of 7 more bedrooms in the Mews Cottages, formerly the private accommodation of Mr Stern. As interest rates rose Mr Katzler decided to sell the property rather than continue his expansion and redevelopment plans. From June 1989 the hotel has been in company ownership. Resort Hotels added a tasteful extension giving the property a further 42 en-suite bedrooms and a Health Club with an indoor swimming pool, spa pool, sauna and mini-gym (although the Health Club is no longer in use). The restaurant was redecorated and extended and a new conservatory was built to replace the original one, which had been destroyed in the gales of 1987. Jarvis Hotels acquired the property in 1994, bedrooms and bathrooms have been refurbished and a full kitchen re-fit has given the hotel the facility to host large local events. In September 2001 Jarvis joined with Ramada Hotels to form Ramada Jarvis. Following the demise of Ramada Jarvis, the hotel was re-branded and now trades as the Mercure Newbury Elcot Park Hotel. Lady Elizabeth Shelley and her daughters Lady Elizabeth Shelley circa 1790. In 1844 Lady Elizabeth Shelley, the mother of Percy Bysshe Shelley, purchased Elcot and moved there with her two daughters Hellen (family spelling) and Margaret. Lady Elizabeth Shelley is said to hold pride of place in influencing Percy's poetic genius. p. 43. Hellen and Margaret Shelley Advertisement for the sale of the Shelley sisters furniture in 1874. Lady Shelley was born in 1763. Her father was Charles Pilfold a wealthy landowner in Effingham. In 1791 she married Sir Timothy ShelleyUniversity of Pennsylvania. Online reference http://knarf.english.upenn.edu/People/tshelley.html who was the son of Sir Bysshe Shelley, 1st Baronet of Castle Goring. A year later their first son Percy Bysshe Shelley the famous poet was born. Over the next decade they had five daughters. One died in infancy, one married and one died in 1831. The family lived at Field Place in Warnham and it was here that Percy spent his childhood with his many sisters. He died at a very young age in 1822 after a boating accident leaving a wife Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley and a son. When Sir Timothy died in 1844 Lady Elizabeth left Field Place and moved to Elcot House with her two unmarried daughters Hellen and Margaret. Soon after she moved there Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley visited them to discuss her son‚Äôs inheritance. Elizabeth died in 1846 and Mary continued to visit Hellen and Margaret at Elcot. A letter from Mary written at Elcot House in 1847 still exists.Bennett, Betty 1988 ‚ÄúLetters of Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley‚Äù vol 3, p. 159. Hellen was fond of her brother Percy and in 1857 while she resided at Elcot she wrote a series of letters about her memories of their childhood together. These letters became the key sources in the many biographies that have been published about the poet. The two sisters appeared to live very comfortably at Elcot. The Census records show that they employed at least ten servants during their residence here including a butler and footman. In 1874 the sisters left Elcot and went to live in a smaller house in Brighton. They sold their extensive range of furniture. An advertisement for the sale of these items appeared in the newspaper and is shown. Hellen died in 1885 at the age of 85 and Margaret died in 1887 aged 87. The probate records show that Margaret died a very wealthy woman leaving an estate valued over 107,000 pounds which in today‚Äôs currency is about 11 million pounds. Location Prospective guests seeking the hotel should follow the A4 from Newbury in the direction of Hungerford for roughly four miles, looking out for the Halfway Inn. Three quarters of a mile thereafter one should see the signs for the hotel). Taking the narrow winding road up the hill towards the hotel, one should exact extreme caution at all times. The hotel is located on a slight hill overlooking the Kennet Valley with views towards Walbury Hill. Around the grounds there are trees, bushes and grass.

Critics of HRW include the national governments it has investigated, NGO Monitor, the media, and its founder (and former chairman), Robert L. Bernstein. The criticism generally falls into the category of alleged bias, frequently in response to critical HRW reports. Bias allegations include the organization's being influenced by United States government policy, particularly in relation to reporting on Latin America, and the misrepresentation of human-rights issues in Eritrea and Ethiopia. Accusations in relation to the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict include claims that HRW is biased against Israel. HRW has publicly responded to criticism of its reporting on Latin America and the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict. Allegations of ideological and selection bias HRW has been accused of evidence-gathering bias because it is said to be \\"credulous of civilian witnesses in places like Gaza and Afghanistan\\" but \\"skeptical of anyone in a uniform.\\" Its founder, Robert Bernstein, accused the organization of poor research methods and relying on \\"witnesses whose stories cannot be verified and who may testify for political advantage or because they fear retaliation from their own rulers.\\" In October 2009, Bernstein said that the organization had lost critical perspective on events in the Middle East: \\"[T]he region is populated by authoritarian regimes with appalling human rights records. Yet in recent years Human Rights Watch has written far more condemnations of Israel for violations of international law than of any other country in the region.\\" HRW responded by saying that HRW \\"does not devote more time and energy to Israel than to other countries in the region, or in the world\\".Why We Report on 'Open' Societies, HRW, 20 October 2009 Tom Porteus, director of the HRW's London branch, replied that the organization rejected Bernstein's \\"obvious double standard. Any credible human rights organization must apply the same human rights standards to all countries.\\" According to The Times, HRW \\"does not always practice the transparency, tolerance and accountability it urges on others.\\" The Times accused HRW of imbalance, alleging that it ignores human- rights abuses in certain regimes while covering other conflict zones (notably Israel) intensively. Although HRW issued five reports on Israel in one fourteen-month period, The Times first said in twenty years HRW issued only four reports on the conflict in Kashmir (despite 80,000 conflict-related deaths in Kashmir and \\"torture and extrajudicial murder ... on a vast scale\\") and it first said no report on post-election violence and repression in Iran. In their correction issued on 4 April 2010, The Times said HRW had published nine articles about the conflict in Kashmir and one report about the post- election abuses in Iran in February that year.Correction: Human Rights Watch, The Times, 4 April 2010, on Wayback Machine A source told The Times, \\"Iran is just not a bad guy that they are interested in highlighting. Their hearts are not in it. Let's face it, the thing that really excites them is Israel.\\" The newspaper quoted Noah Pollak, an HRW critic and conservative commentator, said HRW cares if Israel maltreats Palestinians but \\"is less concerned if perpetrators are fellow Arab\\". One example given was the 2007 Lebanon conflict in the Nahr al-Bared refugee camp and it was said HRW issued one press release but not a report. In their correction, The Times said HRW had written three press releases and had reported abuses against Palestinians by the Palestinian Authority, Hamas, Kuwait, Jordan and Iraq. In the February 2013 issue of The Spectator Nick Cohen wrote, \\"Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch look with horror on those who speak out about murder, mutilation and oppression if the murderers, mutilators and oppressors do not fit into their script.\\" Robert Bernstein accused HRW of allowing repressive regimes to play a \\"moral equivalence game\\", failing to weigh evidence according to whether it was collected from an open or closed society and failing to recognize any \\"difference between wrongs committed in self-defense and those perpetrated intentionally.\\" The Times accused HRW of filling its staff with former radical political activists, including Joe Stork and Sarah Leah Whitson: \\"Theoretically an organization like HRW would not select as its researchers people who are so evidently on one side.\\" HRW has been accused of being unwilling (or unable) to perceive threats posed by Islamic extremism because their leftist ideology leads them to see criticism of Hezbollah, Hamas, Al Qaeda and similar groups as \\"a dangerous distraction from the real struggle.\\" An example was a 2006 verbal attack on Peter Tatchell, who was accused of racism, Islamophobia and colonialism by HRW staff for criticizing Iran's execution of homosexuals. In May 2014 an open letter was published criticising Human Rights Watch for what were described as its close ties to the government of the United States. The letter was signed by Nobel Peace Laureates Adolfo P√©rez Esquivel and Mairead Corrigan, former UN Assistant Secretary-General Hans von Sponeck, United Nations Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in the Palestinian Territories Richard A. Falk, and over 100 scholars and cultural figures. The letter highlighted a number of Human Rights Watch officials who had been involved in foreign policy roles in the US government, including Washington advocacy director Tom Malinowski, formerly a speechwriter for Madeleine Albright and a special adviser to Bill Clinton, and subsequently Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor to John Kerry, and HRW Americas advisory committee members Myles Frechette (a former United States Ambassador to Colombia) and Michael Shifter (former Latin America director for the US government-funded National Endowment for Democracy). The letter contrasted HRW's criticism of Venezuela's candidacy for the United Nations Human Rights Council in a letter to Hugo Ch√°vez to the lack of censure regarding the United States' tenure as a member of the Council, despite the US government's use of a \\"kill list\\" for designated enemies, ongoing usage of extraordinary renditions and the continued detention of combatants at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base. The signatories called on Human Rights Watch to ban those involved in formulating or carrying out US foreign policy from serving as members of the organisation's staff, advisers or board members, or as a \\"bare minimum\\", instituting lengthy cooling-off periods between spells working for HRW and in the service of US foreign policy. Allegations regarding Latin America Robert Naiman, policy director of Just Foreign Policy, wrote that HRW is \\"often heavily influenced\\" by United States foreign policy. =Venezuela= Human Rights Watch work in Venezuela became controversial in September 2008, when the country's government expelled two HRW staff members accused of \\"anti-state activities\\". Then Foreign Minister Nicol√°s Maduro said, \\"These groups, dressed up as human rights defenders, are financed by the United States. They are aligned with a policy of attacking countries that are building new economic models.\\" The report highlights the discrimination of Ch√°vez administration against political opponents and freedom of expression. According to one of the expelled members, the decision of the Venezuelan government was against Venezuelan law. After HRW published a report (A Decade Under Ch√°vez: Political Intolerance and Lost Opportunities for Advancing Human Rights in Venezuela) documenting Chavez government abuses, 118 scholars, activists and film-makers from Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Mexico, the US, the UK, Venezuela and other countries signed a letter, written by US academics Miguel Tinker Salas, Gregory Wilpert and Greg Grandin, criticizing the organization for a perceived bias against the government of Venezuela. The open letter criticized the report, saying that it \\"does not meet even the most minimal standards of scholarship, impartiality, accuracy, or credibility.\\" HRW director Kenneth Roth responded that the letter misrepresents \\"both the substance and the source material of the report\\". Around the same time, Irish journalist Hugh O'Shaughnessy accused HRW of using false and misleading information, saying that the report was \\"put together with [a] sort of know-nothing Washington bias.\\" Tom Porteous, Human Rights Watch's London director, said that O'Shaughnessy \\" ... not only fails to provide any evidence for these allegations\\", but \\" ... more seriously, he misrepresents HRW's positions in his apparent determination to undermine our well earned international reputation for accuracy and impartiality.\\" =Honduras= On August 21, 2009 93 academics and authors from the UK, the US, Canada, Australia, Mexico, Colombia and other countries published an open letter criticizing HRW's \\"absence of statements and reports\\" on human-rights violations in Honduras after 8 July 2009, following the 28 June coup d'√©tat. According to its authors, after 8 July HRW had not \\"raised the alarm over the extra-judicial killings, arbitrary detentions, physical assaults, and attacks on the press - many of which have been thoroughly documented - that have occurred in Honduras, in most cases by the coup regime against the supporters of the democratic and constitutional government of Manuel Zelaya\\"; they asked HRW to make a strong statement against the human-rights violations and conduct its own investigation. The letter's signers said that the Obama administration was supporting the de facto Roberto Micheletti government by providing \\"aid money through the Millennium Challenge Account and other sources\\", training Honduran military students at the School of the Americas and ignoring Honduras' human-rights situation. Four days later, HRW published a summary of the preliminary version of a Honduran human-rights report by the Inter- American Court of Human Rights (IACHR) published on 21 August and cited its earlier reports (published until 8 July): \\"Given the scope of alleged abuses, and the region's history of bloody coups leading to massive violations, human rights advocates believed the situation warranted the direct intervention of the region's most authoritative human rights investigative body, the Inter- American Commission on Human Rights.\\" Criticism regarding the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict =Allegations of anti-Israel bias= Robert Bernstein wrote that by focusing on Israel and neglecting human rights violations by less free states in the Middle East that HRW had cast \\"aside its important distinction between open and closed societies.\\" In response, Aryeh Neier HRW co-founder and former executive director said, it \\"is wrong to suggest that open societies should be spared criticism for human rights abuses\\". Neier also said that Robert Bernstein's distinction between \\"wrongs committed in self-defense and those committed intentionally\\" is not made by the laws of war and is dangerous. \\"On such grounds, groups such as al-Qaeda in Iraq\\" (which \\"murdered tens of thousands of civilians after\\" the 2003 American invasion) could justify their crimes. Writer in WSJ in 2009 says the facts tell a different story than what HRW is being portrayed. From 2006 to the present, Human Rights Watch‚Äôs reports on the Israeli-Arab conflict have been almost entirely devoted to condemning Israel. For a Jerusalem Post article, Natan Sharansky said: \\"Here is an organization created by the goodwill of the free world to fight violations of human rights, which has become a tool in the hands of dictatorial regimes to fight against democracies ... It is time to call a spade a spade. The real activity of this organization today is a far cry from what it was set up 30 years ago to do: throw light in dark places where there is really no other way to find out what is happening regarding human rights.\\" HRW executive director Kenneth Roth responded that \\"Israel accounts for about 15 percent of our published output on the region\\" and \\"our war coverage in the region has documented violations by all sides\\". According to Roth, \\"By failing to hold those responsible to account, Israel increases anger and resentment among the Palestinian population and in the wider Arab world and undercuts moderates who wish to pursue peace.\\" Time Mideast correspondent Scott MacLeod wrote in the Los Angeles Times that Israeli policy cannot be shielded from a group like Human Rights Watch. HRW has been accused of bias against Israel and having an anti-Israeli agenda by NGO Monitor. Political science professor and former consultant to the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs Gerald M. Steinberg of Bar Ilan University, head of NGO Monitor (a pro-Israel NGO), accused HRW of having \\"a strong anti-Israel bias from the beginning\\". According to Steinberg, the organization's reports were based primarily on \\"Palestinian eyewitness testimony\\": testimony that is \\"not accurate, objective or credible but serves the political goal of indicting Israel\\". In a Wall Street Journal opinion piece, law professor David Bernstein called HRW \\"maniacally anti-Israel\\". Spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu Mark Regev said: \\"We discovered during the Gaza operation and the Second Lebanon War that these organizations come in with a very strong agenda, and because they claim to have some kind of halo around them, they receive a status that they don't deserve,\\" referring to HRW and Amnesty International allegations of human-rights violations by Israeli forces during those conflicts. The organization has also been accused of ignoring anti-Semitism or being anti-Semitic itself. In a 2005 speech to the Anti-Defamation League former Spanish Foreign Minister Ana Palacio said, \\"NGOs like Human Rights Watch or Amnesty International pay little attention to anti-Semitism.\\" The ADL has also said, \\"While Human Rights Watch acknowledged in a May 3 report that there was no evidence of a massacre [in Jenin] and that Palestinian gunmen had contributed to endangering Palestinian civilians, they continued to emphasize that there was prima facie evidence Israel committed war crimes.\\" In The New York Sun, ADL national director Abraham Foxman criticized Roth's use of \\"a classic anti-Semitic stereotype about Jews\\". In 2012, New Europe said that HRW \\"allegedly erased references in its reports to its previous cooperation with the Gaddafi regime, including the role of the organization's MENA Director, Sarah Leah Whitson, in marketing Saif al-Islam Gaddafi as a reformer.\\" HRW Middle East and North Africa division director Sarah Leah Whitson responded to criticism: \\"In the case of Israel, where our focus is primarily on the violations of international law and humanitarian law in the occupied Palestinian territories, the fact that government is a democracy is completely irrelevant, because the rule in place in the occupied territories is military rule, it is not a democracy\\". In July 2009, Jerusalem Post columnist Larry Derfner accused Israel's Prime Minister's Office and NGO Monitor of \\"smearing\\" human-rights organizations in response to the criticism of HRW. HRW program director Iain Levine said in August 2009, \\"If the Israeli government wants to silence critics, it should fully investigate allegations of wrongdoing and take action to end the abuses.\\" In a Jerusalem Post op-ed piece that month, Kenneth Roth wrote that reports of recent Israeli human-rights violations had \\"given rise to an intense campaign by the Israeli government and some of its uncritical supporters to smear the messengers and change the subject.\\" According to Roth, the \\"problem is not the messenger carrying news of that misconduct, whether Judge Goldstone or the human rights groups that have been the target of a disinformation campaign launched by the Israeli government and some supporters. The problem is the conduct of the Israeli military.\\" According to The Times, \\"most\\" HRW Middle East staff \\"have activist backgrounds ‚Äî it was typical that one newly hired researcher came to HRW from the extremist anti-Israel publication Electronic Intifada ‚Äî unlikely to reassure anyone who thinks that human-rights organizations should be non- partisan.\\" The Times later said that the Electronic Intifada had published the HRW researcher's articles without permission and that she \\"was not directly employed by that group\\". In a November 2012 Wall Street Journal article, David Feith said that there has been \\"bitter debate\\" within HRW about whether Iran's alleged call for annihilation of Israel is a violation of human rights. HRW vice-chair Sid Sheinberg wrote in an internal email that doing nothing while Ahmadinejad wants to \\"kill Jews and annihilate Israel ... is a position unworthy of our great organization.\\" According to Kenneth Roth, \\"Tehran isn't inciting genocide and claims to the contrary are part of an effort to beat the war drums against Iran.\\" In an analysis published by the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, Ron Kampeas criticized HRW reports: \\"Reconstructions of the horrific death of civilians replete with painstakingly gathered evidence are coupled with bewildering omissions of context and blended into a package that assumes an inherent Israeli immorality\\" and denounced \\"efforts to turn criticism of individual officers and soldiers into a wholesale indictment of Israel‚Äôs military establishment and the decision to resort to military force.\\" According to Kampeas, HRW reports on the 2009 fighting in Gaza \\"fail to assess evidence ‚Äî including videos of Israeli forces holding their fire because of the presence of civilians ‚Äî that Israel has provided to show that such incidents were the exception to the rule; they fail to examine what measures Israel has taken to prevent civilian deaths, which would be pertinent in examining any claim of war crimes.\\" In October 2009, Robert Bernstein criticized the organization's policy in the Middle East in a New York Times op-ed. According to Bernstein, \\"With increasing frequency, [HRW] casts aside its important distinction between open and closed societies ... The region is populated by authoritarian regimes with appalling human rights records. Yet in recent years Human Rights Watch has written far more condemnations of Israel for violations of international law than of any other country in the region.\\" HRW London branch director Tom Porteus replied that the organization rejected Bernstein's \\"obvious double standard. Any credible human rights organization must apply the same human rights standards to all countries.\\" Jane Olson and Jonathan Fanton wrote in a letter to the New York Times, \\"We were saddened to see Robert L. Bernstein argue that Israel should be judged by a different human rights standard than the rest of the world ... As long as open societies commit human rights abuses, Human Rights Watch has a vital role to play in documenting those violations and advocating to bring them to an end.\\" According to the organization, in April 2009 Bernstein brought his concerns to the HRW board of directors; the board unanimously rejected his view that Human Rights Watch should report only on closed societies, expressing its full support for the organization's work. The New Republic published a lengthy article about HRW in April 2010, criticizing the organization for \\"giving disproportionate attention to Israeli misdeeds.\\" \\"Robert James‚Äîa businessman, World War II veteran, and member of the MENA [Middle East and North Africa Desk of HRW] advisory committee who has been involved with HRW almost since its inception‚Äîcalls the group 'the greatest NGO since the Red Cross',\\" but argues that it is chronically incapable of introspection. 'Bob [Bernstein, founder and former chair of HRW] is bringing this issue up on Israel', he says. 'But Human Rights Watch has a more basic problem ... They cannot take criticism'.\\" According to the magazine (referring to Bernstein's New York Times op-ed), \\"Yet, as difficult as it was to go public, Bernstein does not believe that Human Rights Watch left him with much choice. 'They think they‚Äôve heard me out,' he says. 'You see, they think they‚Äôve listened to me until they can‚Äôt listen anymore. Actually, they haven‚Äôt listened at all'.\\" In November 2010 Bernstein delivered the Shirley and Leonard Goldstein Lecture on Human Rights at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, accusing HRW of \\"fault[ing] Israel as the principal offender\\" in the Israel-Palestine conflict and suggesting that human-rights groups were responsible for polarizing university campuses. In her Washington Post blog, Jennifer Rubin described HRW as \\"an anti-Israel group masquerading as one devoted to human rights\\". A January 2012 New Europe article quoted an NGO Monitor report which said that HRW gives \\"disproportionate attention\\" to Israel and the occupied territories, which received \\"more attention in 2011 than Tunisia, Saudi Arabia, or Iraq.\\" According to the article, HRW reports continued to show \\"bias on Israel\\" and \\"all op-eds published on the Arab-Israeli conflict in major media focused on allegations against Israel.\\" Orlando Radice said about his interview with Kenneth Roth for The Jewish Chronicle, \\"This was less of an interview than an exercise in denial, obfuscation and plain old censorship.\\" Garlasco incident Senior HRW investigator Marc Garlasco has been criticized for collecting Nazi memorabilia, and Emma Daly confirmed without elaboration in March 2010 that Garlasco had resigned from Human Rights Watch the previous month. Garlasco, who wrote a book about Nazi-era medals, posted on a collector website: \\"That is so cool! The leather SS jacket makes my blood go cold it is so COOL!\\" Ron Dermer, then Binyamin Netanyahu's policy director, said about Garlasco: \\"A war crimes investigator who is an avid collector and trader in Nazi memorabilia is perhaps a new low.\\" HRW issued a rebuttal, saying that the \\"accusation is demonstrably false and fits into a campaign to deflect attention from Human Rights Watch's rigorous and detailed reporting on violations of international human rights and humanitarian law by the Israeli government\\" and Garlasco \\"has never held or expressed Nazi or anti-Semitic views.\\" Helena Cobban (a fellow analyst on the Human Rights Watch Middle East advisory board) said that Garlasco engaged with \\"people who clearly do seem to be Nazi sympathizers,\\" which she called \\"extremely disturbing\\". According to the organization Garlasco \\"covered Iraq as a senior intelligence analyst at the Pentagon\\", and The Guardian reported that he served in this role for seven years. He was chief of high-value targeting during the Iraq war in 2003, on the Operation Desert Fox (Iraq) Battle Damage Assessment team in 1998 and led a Pentagon Battle Damage Assessment team to Kosovo in 1999. Garlasco also participated in over 50 interrogations as a subject-matter expert. In a piece for The National, Alan Philps wrote that \\"the Netanyahu government and its supporters have set out to destroy the credibility of the UN Human Rights Council and all non-governmental organisations (NGOs) working in the human rights field ... The aim is clearly to de-legitimize the organization at a time when its rights-based analysis coincides with some of the views of the US president Barack Obama.\\" According to Christian Science Monitor staff writer Robert Marquand, a U.N. report by \\"jurist Richard Goldstone, head of South Africa‚Äôs Truth and Reconciliation Commission, chief prosecutor for the Yugoslav war-crimes tribunal\\" showed illegal white-phosphorus use consistent with Garlasco's eyewitness testimony provided to the Monitor. Marquand wrote that it was \\"not okay ... to use Garlasco to distract from or obfuscate findings that war crimes and crimes against humanity may have taken place in Gaza\\". Fundraising On September 7, 2010, it was announced that George Soros planned to donate $100 million to Human Rights Watch. Soros' donation was criticized by Gerald Steinberg, founder of NGO Monitor. Journalists have criticized Human Rights Watch for requesting, encouraging or accepting financial donations in Saudi Arabia and for its fundraising methods. Critics charge that these methods include descriptions of HRW \\"battles\\" and arguments with Israel and its supporters. According to Jerusalem Post columnist Herb Keinon and Jeffrey Goldberg, a correspondent for The Atlantic and former JP columnist, this compromises HRW's integrity. In an email exchange, Goldberg asked Kenneth Roth if funds were raised to fight pro-Israel lobbying groups. Roth answered: \\"The Saudis obviously are aware of the systematic attacks on us by various reflexive defenders of Israel. Everyone is\\", adding that these complaints are common in \\"discussions\\" during fundraisers and not exclusive to Saudi Arabia. A spokesman for Israeli PM Binyamin Netanyahu, Mark Regev, said in response to HRW's fundraising visit to Saudi Arabia, \\"A human rights organization raising money in Saudi Arabia is like a women's rights group asking the Taliban for a donation\\". David Bernstein of the George Mason University School of Law wrote that something is \\"wrong when a human rights organization goes to one of the worst countries in the world for human rights to raise money to wage lawfare against Israel\\", although Inter Press Service later said that he apologized for suggesting that HRW did not also discuss Saudi human-rights abuses during the meetings. According to Human Rights Watch, allegations that HRW had \\"compromised its neutrality\\" by meeting with Saudi donors were based on \\"misleading assumptions and wrong facts\\". HRW noted that staffers made two May 2009 presentations in private Saudi homes to people interested in the organization. Among an estimated 50 guests at a Riyadh reception, three had governmental affiliations: \\"the spokesperson for the Ministry of Interior; the deputy head of the Human Rights Commission, a governmental organization; and a member of the Shura Council, a government- appointed consultative body.\\" According to HRW, none of those individuals were solicited for funds; HRW never accepts funds from government officials in any country, and there is no reason why Saudi citizens cannot legitimately want to support human rights. Gerald Steinberg, executive director of NGO Monitor, said that the HRW defense was an \\"absurd attempt to cast a distinction between soliciting Saudi officials and prominent members of society who owe their very position to the regime.\\" HRW told Inter Press Service that the idea \\"that any money from Saudi Arabia is tainted because it comes from a country with a totalitarian ruling regime is a gross generalization ... The ethnic background of our donors is irrelevant to the work we do ... It's not relevant to our work in Israel that many, many of our donors are Jewish. And it's not relevant for the work that we do that we get money from Arab countries\\". According to the organization its work in Saudi Arabia, including \\"coverage of women's rights, the juvenile death penalty, domestic workers, and discrimination against religious minorities\\", was discussed at the receptions. HRW also said, \\"No other human rights group has produced a more comprehensive, detailed, and thorough body of work on Saudi Arabian human rights issues in recent years than Human Rights Watch\\". Although the Gaza situation was covered, HRW claimed that the coverage was justified since the Gaza war dominated worldwide headlines and is a regional issue in Saudi Arabia. Criticism of HRW as anti- Israel was juxtaposed against the accusations HRW faces in much of the Middle East that HRW is soft on Israeli human-rights violations. In 2008, HRW issued one multi-country and five single-country reports criticizing the Saudi Arabian government. In August 2009 the organization issued a report, \\"Human Rights and Saudi Arabia's Counterterrorism Response: Religious Counseling, Indefinite Detention, and Flawed Trials\\", criticizing the Saudi Arabian government's counterterrorism program. Shawan Jabarin appointment In February 2011, HRW appointed Shawan Jabarin to their Mideast Advisory Board. Jabarin has been called \\"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\\" by the Israeli Supreme Court for his roles in the militant Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the human-rights organization Al Haq. HRW's decision to include Jabarin on its Mideast Board evoked criticism from Robert Bernstein, Stuart Robinowitz (a New York attorney who has made human-rights missions for the American Bar Association and Helsinki Watch in Yugoslavia, Bulgaria and El Salvador,) Gerald Steinberg, president of NGO Monitor, and Middle East analyst Jonathan Schanzer. =Response to criticism= In the wake of the 2009 Goldstone report, HRW accused Israel and its supporters of an organized campaign of false allegations and misinformation designed to discredit the group over its findings concerning the Gaza War. The organization tied the criticism to a June 2009 statement by a senior official in the Israeli prime minister's office who pledged to \\"dedicate time and manpower to combating\\" human-rights organizations. According to HRW, the criticism amounted to an organized effort. Attacks from different sources, with similar language and arguments, implied prior coordination. Iain Levine of HRW said, \\"We are having to spend a lot of time repudiating the lies, the falsehoods, the misinformation\\". A group of 10 Israeli rights groups accused the Israeli government of attempting to \\"instill fear and silence or alarm vital organizations\\" who were engaging in open, public discourse. Criticism from Egyptian government On August 14, 2014, the one-year anniversary of the dispersal of pro-Morsi sit-ins by Egyptian police in the Rabaa al-Adawiya Square and Nahda Square, which lead to clashes that resulted in 638 deaths, of which 43 were police officers, according to the Egyptian Health Ministry, HRW published a report in which it accused security forces of excessive force, in addition to claiming that the dispersal was planned at the highest levels of the Egyptian government. The death toll given by HRW ranged from 817 to approximately 1000. HRW stated that the actions of the police likely amounted to \\"crimes against humanity.\\" However, in an official statement from the State Information Service, the government of Egypt criticized HRW, alleging that the organization's report lacked transparency, ignored violence by protesters, and that it was biased in favor of the Muslim Brotherhood. As a consequence for publishing the report, executive director Kenneth Roth and Middle East and North Africa Director Sarah Leah Whitson, working for HRW, who were to publicly present the report to journalists and diplomats, were detained for hours by authorities and deported from Egypt. In a statement from the Egyptian Interior Ministry on its official Facebook page, HRW was accused of illegally operating in Egypt without permits from authorities. Criticism from Ethiopian government The Ethiopian government has raised questions about HRW's methods, commissioning a report dismissing \\"Human Rights Watch allegations of abuses in the Ogaden as hearsay and its methods as slapdash\\". Bangladesh government's attempted prosecution of HRW A special tribunal dealing with war crimes during Bangladesh's 1971 independence war with Pakistan asked Human Rights Watch to explain why it should not be charged with contempt of court for a statement from the organization that the trial of former Islamic party leader Ghulam Azam was \\"deeply flawed\\" and did not meet international standards. Azam was sentenced to 90 years in prison for war crimes. The U.S. ambassador in Bangladesh expressed concern over the prosecutors' move against the organization.

The term infidel was used by Christians to describe those perceived as the enemies of Christianity. After the ancient world the concept of otherness, an exclusionary notion of the outside by societies with more or less coherent cultural boundaries, became associated with the development of the monotheistic and prophetic religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam (cf. pagan). In modern literature, the term infidel includes in its scope atheists, polytheists,See: *Ken Ward (2008), in Expressing Islam: Religious Life and Politics in Indonesia, Editors: Greg Fealy, Sally White, , Chapter 12; *Alexander Ignatenko, Words and Deeds, Russia in Global Affairs, Vol. 7, No. 2, April‚ÄìJune 2009, p. 145 animists,Whitlark & Aycock (Editors) (1992), The literature of emigration and exile, Texas Tech University Press, , pp. 3‚Äì28 heathens and pagans.See: Mignolo W. (2000), The many faces of cosmopolis: Border thinking and critical cosmopolitanism. Public Culture, 12(3), pp. 721‚Äì48 A willingness to identify other religious people as infidels corresponds to preference for orthodoxy over pluralism.See: *Cole & Hammond (1974), Religious pluralism, legal development, and societal complexity: rudimentary forms of civil religion, Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, Vol. 13, No. 2, pp. 177‚Äì89; *Sullivan K. M. (1992), Religion and liberal democracy, The University of Chicago Law Review, Vol. 59, No. 1, pp. 195‚Äì223. Etymology The origins of the word infidel date to the late 15th century, deriving from the French infid√®le or Latin ƒ´nfidƒìlis, from in- \\"not\\" + fidƒìlis \\"faithful\\" (from fidƒìs \\"faith\\", related to fƒ´dere 'to trust'). The word originally denoted a person of a religion other than one's own, especially a Christian to a Muslim, a Muslim to a Christian, or a gentile to a Jew. Later meanings in the 15th century include \\"unbelieving\\", \\"a non-Christian\\" and \\"one who does not believe in religion\\" (1527). Usage Christians historically used the term infidel to refer to people who actively opposed Christianity. This term became well- established in English by sometime in the early sixteenth century, when Jews or Mohammedans (Muslims; formerly called saracens), were described contemptuously as active opponents to Christianity. In Catholic dogma, an infidel is one who does not believe in the doctrine at all and is thus distinct from a heretic, who has fallen away from true doctrine, i.e. by denying the divinity of Jesus. Similarly, the ecclesiastical term was also used by the Methodist Church, in reference to those \\"without faith\\". Today, the usage of the term infidel has declined; the current preference is for the terms non-Christians and non-believers (persons without religious affiliations or beliefs), reflecting the commitment of mainstream Christian denominations to engage in dialog with persons of other faiths.Russell B. Shaw, Peter M. J. Stravinskas, Our Sunday Visitor's Catholic Encyclopedia, Our Sunday Visitor Publishing, 1998, p. 535. Nevertheless, some apologists have argued in favor of the term, stating that it does not come from a disrespectful perspective, but is similar to using the term orthodox for devout believers. Moreover, some translations of the Bible, including the King James Version, which is still in vogue today, employ the word infidel, while others have supplanted the term with nonbeliever. The term is found in two places: Infidels under canon law =Right to rule= In Quid super his, Innocent IV asked the question, \\"[I]s it licit to invade a land that infidels possess or which belongs to them?\\" and held that while Infidels had a right to dominium (right to rule themselves and choose their own governments), the pope, as the Vicar of Christ, de jure possessed the care of their souls and had the right to politically intervene in their affairs if their ruler violated or allowed his subjects to violate a Christian and Euro-centric normative conception of Natural law, such as sexual perversion or idolatry.Williams, p.48 He also held that he had an obligation to send missionaries to infidel lands, and that if they were prevented from entering or preaching, then the pope was justified in dispatching Christian forces accompanied with missionaries to invade those lands, as Innocent stated simply: \\"If the infidels do not obey, they ought to be compelled by the secular arm and war may be declared upon them by the pope, and nobody else.\\"Williams, p. 14 This was however not a reciprocal right and non-Christian missionaries such as those of Muslims could not be allowed to preach in Europe \\"because they are in error and we are on a righteous path.\\" A long line of Papal hierocratic canonists, most notably those who adhered to Alanus Anglicus's influential arguments of the Crusading-era, denied Infidel dominium, and asserted Rome's universal jurisdictional authority over the earth, as well as the right to authorize pagan conquests solely on the basis of non-belief because of their rejection of the Christian God.Williams, pp. 41, 61‚Äì64 In the extreme, the hierocractic canonical discourse of the mid- twelfth century, such as that espoused by Bernard of Clairvaux, the mystic leader of the Cisertcians, legitimized German colonial expansion and practice of forceful Christianisation in the Slavic territories as a holy war against the Wends, arguing that infidels should be killed wherever they posed a menace to Christians. When Frederick the II unilaterally arrogated papal authority, he took on the mantle to \\"destroy convert, and subjugate all barbarian nations,\\" a power in papal doctrine reserved for the pope. Hostiensis, a student of Innocent, in accord with Alanus, also asserted \\"... by law infidels should be subject to the faithful.\\" John Wyclif, regarded as the forefather of English Reformation, also held that valid dominium rested on a state of grace.Williams, pp. 61‚Äì64 The Teutonic Knights were one of the by-products of this papal hierocratic and German discourse. After the Crusades in the Levant, they moved to crusading activities in the infidel Baltics. Their crusades against the Lithuanians and Poles, however, precipitated the Lithuanian Controversy, and the Council of Constance, following the condemnation of Wyclif, found Hostiensis's views no longer acceptable and ruled against the knights. Future Church doctrine was then firmly aligned with Innocents IV's position.Williams, pp. 64‚Äì67 The later development of counterarguments on the validity of Papal authority, the rights of infidels, and the primacy of natural law led to various treatises such as those by Hugo Grotius, John Locke, Immanuel Kant and Thomas Hobbes, which in turn led to the transformation of international law's treatment of the relationship between Christian and non-Christian societies and the development of human rights. Colonization of the Americas During the Age of Discovery, papal bulls such as Romanus Pontifex and, more importantly, inter caetera (1493), implicitly removed dominium from infidels and granted them to the Spanish Empire and Portugal with the charter of guaranteeing the safety of missionaries. Subsequent English and French rejections of the bull rejected the Pope's authority to exclude other Christian princes. As independent authorities such as the Head of the Church of England, they drew up charters for their own colonial missions based on the temporal right for care of infidel souls in language echoing the inter caetera. The charters and papal bulls would form the legal basis of future negotiations and consideration of claims as title deeds in the emerging law of nations in the European colonization of the Americas.Christopher 31-40 The rights bestowed by Romanus Pontifex and inter caetera have never fallen from use, serving as the basis for legal arguments over the centuries. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the 1823 case Johnson v. M'Intosh that as a result of European discovery and assumption of ultimate dominion, Native Americans had only a right to occupancy of native lands, not the right of title. This decision was upheld in the 1831 case Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, giving Georgia authority to extend state laws over Cherokees within the state, and famously describing Native American tribes as \\"domestic dependent nations.\\" This decision was modified in Worcester v. Georgia, which stated that the U.S. federal government, and not individual states, had authority in Indian affairs, but it maintained the loss of right to title upon discovery by Europeans. Native American groups including the Ta√≠no and Onondaga have called on the Vatican to revoke the bulls of 1452, 1453, and 1493. =Marriage= According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, the Catholic Church views marriage as forbidden and null when conducted between the faithful (Christians) and infidels, unless a dispensation has been granted. This is because marriage is a sacrament of the Catholic Church, which infidels are deemed incapable of receiving. As a philosophical tradition Some philosophers such as Thomas Paine, David Hume, George Holyoake, Charles Bradlaugh, Voltaire and Rousseau earned the label of infidel or freethinkers, both personally and for their respective traditions of thought because of their attacks on religion and opposition to the Church. They established and participated in a distinctly labeled, infidel movement or tradition of thought, that sought to reform their societies which were steeped in Christian thought, practice, laws and culture. The Infidel tradition was distinct from parallel anti-Christian, sceptic or deist movements, in that it was anti-theistic and also synonymous with atheism. These traditions also sought to set up various independent model communities, as well as societies, whose traditions then gave rise to various other socio-political movements such as secularism in 1851, as well as developing close philosophical ties to some contemporary political movements such as socialism and the French Revolution.Royle, Edwards, \\"Victorian Infidels: The Origins of the British Secularist Movement 1791‚Äì1866\\", Manchester University Press, Towards the early twentieth century, these movements sought to move away from the tag \\"infidel\\" because of its associated negative connotation in Christian thought, and there is attributed to George Holyoake the coining of the term 'secularism' in an attempt to bridge the gap with other theist and Christian liberal reform movements. In 1793, Immanuel Kant's Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason, reflected the Enlightenment periods' philosophical development, one which differentiated between the moral and rational and substituted rational/irrational for the original true believer/infidel distinction. Implications for medieval civil law Laws passed by the Catholic Church governed not just the laws between Christians and infidels in matters of religious affairs, but also civil affairs. They were prohibited from participating or aiding in infidel religious rites, such as circumcisions or wearing images of non-Christian religious significance. In the Early Middle Ages, based on the idea of the superiority of Christians to infidels, regulations came into place such as those forbidding Jews from possessing Christian slaves; the laws of the decretals further forbade Christians from entering the service of Jews, for Christian women to act as their nurses or midwives; forbidding Christians from employing Jewish physicians when ill; restricting Jews to definite quarters of the towns into which they were admitted and to wear a dress by which they might be recognized. Later during the Victorian era, testimony of either self-declared, or those accused of being Infidels or Atheists, was not accepted in a court of law because it was felt that they had no moral imperative to not lie under oath because they did not believe in God, or Heaven and Hell. These rules have now given way to modern legislation and Catholics, in civil life, are no longer governed by ecclesiastical law.  Analogous terms in other religions  =Islam= One Arabic language analogue to infidel, referring to non-Muslims, is kafir (sometimes \\"kaafir\\", \\"kufr\\" or \\"kuffar\\"; g√¢vur in Turkish,) from the root K-F-R, which connotes covering or concealing.Ruthven M. (2002), International Affairs, Vol. 78, No. 2, pp. 339‚Äì51\\"Kaffir\\", The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition, Houghton Mifflin Company, 2006. \\"Islam An infidel.\\"; Also: \\"Kaffir\\" - Arabic kƒÅfir \\"unbeliever, infidel\\", Encarta World English Dictionary [North American Edition], Microsoft Corporation, 2007. The term KFR may also refer to disbelieve in something, ungrateful for something provided or denunciation of a certain matter or life style. Another term, sometimes used synonymously, is mushrik, \\"polytheist\\" or \\"conspirer\\", which more immediately connotes the worship of gods other than Allah.Islamic Science University of Malaysia, Dr. Abdullah al-Faqih, The meaning of \\"Kufr\\" and \\"Shirk\\" In the Quran, the term kafir is first applied to the unbelieving Meccans, and their attempts to refute and revile Muhammad. Later, Muslims are ordered to keep apart from them, defend themselves from their attacks, and finally take the offensive against them. In the Quran the term \\"people of the book\\" (Ahl al-KitƒÅb) refers to Jews, Christians, and Sabians. In this way, Islam considers Jews and Christians as fellow believers.\\"Infidel\\" in An Introductory Dictionary of Theology and Religious Studies, p. 630\\"Kafir\\" in An Introductory Dictionary of Theology and Religious Studies p. 702 The term people of the book was later expanded to include adherents of Zoroastrianism and Hinduism by Islamic rulers in Persia and India. A Muslim commits a punishable offense if he says to a Christian or a Jew: \\"thou unbeliever\\". In some verses of the Koran, particularly those recited after the Hijra in AD 622, the concept of kafir was expanded upon, with Jews and Christians included.Campo, Juan Eduardo (2009). Encyclopedia of Islam. Infobase Publishing, New York, , see p. 421. The expanded term kafir refers to anyone who disbelieves in the religion of Islam, the one that mocks the religion of Islam, who does not regard the kafiroon as kaffirs, whoever believes one's teaching is more reliable and trustworthy than Muhammad's teachings, whoever hates something of Muhammad, whoever practices witchcraft, and whoever supports the kaffirs against the Muslims (in terms of war, harming, etc.).Lewis, Bernard. The political language of Islam. University of Chicago Press, 1991. Jews were condemned as kafirs for their disbelief in God's ayah (signs or verses). Christians were condemned as kafirs for their belief in the Trinity, which the Qur'an declared as major kufr (disbelief) (kufr akbar), which puts one outside of the pale of Islam (Surah al-Maa‚Äôidah ‚Äì 5:116 for example).Waldman, Marilyn Robinson. \\"The Development of the Concept of Kufr in the Qur'ƒÅn.\\" Journal of the American Oriental society 88.3 (1968): 442‚Äì55.Schimmel, Annemarie, and Abdoldjavad Falaturi. We Believe in One God: The Experience of God in Christianity and Islam. Seabury Press, 1979. Some hadiths prohibit declaring a Muslim to be a kafir, but the term was nonetheless fairly frequent in the internal religious polemics of the age. For example, some texts of the Sunni sect of Islam include other sects of Islam such as Shia as infidel.Wilfred Madelung (1970), Early Sunnƒ´ Doctrine concerning Faith as Reflected in the\\" KitƒÅb al-ƒ™mƒÅn\\", Studia Islamica, No. 32, pp. 233‚Äì54 Certain sects of Islam, such as Wahhabism, include as kafir those Muslims who undertake Sufi shrine pilgrimage and follow Shia teachings about Imams.Williams, Brian Glyn. \\"Jihad and ethnicity in post‚Äêcommunist Eurasia. on the trail of transnational islamic holy warriors in Kashmir, Afghanistan, Central Asia, Chechnya and Kosovo.\\" The Global Review of Ethnopolitics 2.3‚Äì4 (2003): 3‚Äì24.Ungureanu, Daniel. \\"Wahhabism, Salafism and the Expansion of Islamic Fundamentalist Ideology.\\" Journal of the Seminar of Discursive Logic, Argumentation Theory and Rhetoric. 2011.Marshall, Paul A., ed. Radical Islam's Rules: The Worldwide Spread of Extreme Shari ªa Law. Rowman & Littlefield, 2005. Similarly, in Africa and South Asia, certain sects of Islam such as Hausas, Ahmadi, Akhbaris have been repeatedly declared as Kufir or infidels by other sects of Muslims.Mark Juergensmeyer (2011), The Oxford Handbook of Global Religions, Oxford University Press, , pp. 451, 519‚Äì23Patrick J. Ryan, Ariadne auf Naxos: Islam and Politics in a Religiously Pluralistic African Society, Journal of Religion in Africa, Vol. 26, Fasc. 3 (Aug., 1996), pp. 308‚Äì29H. R. Palmer, An Early Fulani Conception of Islam, Journal of the Royal African Society, Vol. 13, No. 52, pp. 407‚Äì14 The class of kafir also includes the category of murtadd, variously translated as apostate or renegades, for whom classical jurisprudence prescribes death if they refuse to return to Islam. On the subject of ritual impurity of unbelievers, one finds a range of opinions, \\"from the strictest to the most tolerant\\", in classical jurisprudence.Bj√∂rkman, W., \\"Kafir\\". E. J. Brill's First Encyclopaedia of Islam, 1913‚Äì1936, Volume 4, ; pp. 619‚Äì20 Historically, the attitude toward unbelievers in Islam was determined more by socio-political conditions than by religious doctrine. A tolerance toward unbelievers prevailed even to the time of the Crusades, particularly with respect to the People of the Book. However, animosity was nourished by repeated wars with unbelievers, and warfare between Safavid Persia and Ottoman Turkey brought about application of the term kafir even to Persians in Turkish fatwas. In Sufism the term underwent a special development, as in a well-known verse of Abu Sa'id: \\"So long as belief and unbelief are not perfectly equal, no man can be a true Muslim\\", which has prompted various explanations. =Judaism= Judaism has a notion of pagan gentiles who are called 'acum, an acronym of Ovdei Cohavim u-Mazzaloth or, literally, \\"star-and-constellation worshippers\\".Walter Zanger, \\"Jewish Worship, Pagan Symbols: Zodiac mosaics in ancient synagogues\\", Bible History Daily; first published 24 August 2012, updated 24 August 2014.Shay Zucker, \\"Hebrew Names of the Planets\\", The Role of Astronomy in Society and Culture, Proceedings of the International Astronomical Union, IAU Symposium, Volume 260; p. 302. The Hebrew term, kofer, cognate with the Arabic kafir, is reserved only for apostate Jews.

The organization uses these teams to achieve its aims of lower levels of violence, nonviolent direct action, human rights documentation and nonviolence training in direct action. CPT sums up their work as being \\"committed to reducing violence by 'getting in the way'\\". The organization currently has a full-time peace force of over 30 activists currently working in Colombia, Iraq, the West Bank, Chiapas, Mexico and Kenora, Canada. These activists are supported by over 150 reservists who spend two weeks to two months a year on location for the organization and its activities. Palestinians remove a roadblock while a member of CPT stands behind them. Christianity and CPT CPT has its roots in the historic peace churches of North America, and its four supporting denominations are the Mennonite Church USA, Mennonite Church Canada, Church of the Brethren, and the Religious Society of Friends. It is also sponsored by several Christian groups: \\"Every Church a Peace Church\\", \\"On Earth Peace\\", \\"Presbyterian Peace Fellowship\\", \\"Baptist Peace Fellowship of North America\\", and the \\"Congregation of St. Basil\\". In conflict areas it works in partnership with Jewish, Muslim and secular peace organizations, such as the International Solidarity Movement and Peace Brigades International. Another component of CPT's work is to engage \\"...congregations, meetings and support groups at home to play a key advocacy role with policy makers.\\" Although it is a Christian- based organization, CPT does not engage in any type of missionary activity. Their website states \\"While CPTers have chosen to follow Jesus Christ, they do not proselytize.\\" This has raised the question of what distinguishes them from similar \\"secular\\", organizations; > \\"All the groups resemble one another other in that they all work to stop > violence, but according to CPT's Web site, it has an advantage over secular > groups: \\"In Muslim areas, the Christian nature of CPT helps to create > confidence because of a shared sense of monotheism.\\" The group does not > believe that its Christianity might also put it at a dangerous disadvantage > in areas of the world where religious tensions run high.\\" Their website also states that Corp members are Christians, but there is no faith requirement for members of CPT's short-term delegations. For example, one of the CPT delegates who was held hostage in Iraq, Harmeet Singh Sooden, is a Sikh. The Mennonite Church USA Archives is the repository of the official records of Christian Peacemaker Teams. History A 2004 protest by CPT outside the Toronto office of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), protesting the detention of non-citizens under security certificates. The inspiration for the group came from Ron Sider at the Mennonite World Conference in 1984. At the conference, Sider criticized Mennonites and Brethren in Christ for reducing their practice of peace witnessing to simple conscientious objection: > Unless comfortable North American and European Mennonites and Brethren in > Christ are prepared to risk injury and death in nonviolent opposition to the > injustice our societies foster and assist in Central America, the > Philippines, and South Africa, we dare never whisper another word about > pacifism to our sisters and brothers in those desperate lands.... Unless we > are prepared to pay the cost of peacemaking, we have no right to claim the > label or preach the message.Statement by Ron Sider After a series of meetings, Gene Stoltzfus was hired as the first staff person for the new organization in 1988. Over the next few years CPT trainings and conferences explored various models for international peacemaking. In 1990, just before the Gulf War, CPT sent a team of 13 to Iraq for 10 days, with Sr. Anne Montgomery among this number.http://peacemagazine.org/archive/v07n2p08.htm This delegation proved to be the first of a number the group would later send to Haiti, Iraq, and the West Bank. Iraq activities CPT has operated in Iraq since October 2002. Since the 2003 invasion of Iraq, they have worked with and advocated for families of people detained by the U.S. Military and collected stories of detainee abuse. In January 2004 they released a report documenting routine abuse of Iraqi prisoners held by Coalition Provisional Authority, well before the photographs of Abu Ghraib prisoners brought international attention to the issue.CPT report =Hostage crisis= On 26 November 2005, four human rights workers associated with CPT were kidnapped in Baghdad: * James Loney, 41, of Toronto, Canada, program coordinator for CPT Canada * Harmeet Singh Sooden, 32, of Canada, an electrical engineer and former McGill University student who had been living in New Zealand * Norman Kember, 74, of London, UK, a retired professor of medical studies * Tom Fox, 54, of Clearbrook, Virginia, U.S., a leader of youth programs at Langley Hill Friends Meeting The four had been visiting the Muslim Clerics Association, an influential group of Sunni religious leaders formed in 2003 after the collapse of Saddam Hussein's regime. The group had been standing roughly 100 meters from the entrance to a mosque where the meeting had taken place when they were abducted. Their captors were a previously unknown group, the Swords of Righteousness Brigade. The hostages were shown on a video broadcast released worldwide on 29 November by Arab satellite channel Al Jazeera. The captors branded their hostages as spies posing as Christian peace activists. The captors threatened to kill the hostages unless the US freed all Iraqi prisoners held in the US and Iraq. A body found in Iraq on 10 March 2006 was identified later that day as being that of Tom Fox.U.S. hostage taken with Canadians killed, Toronto Star, March 10, 2006 On March 23, 2006, the three remaining hostages were freed from a house in the Mansour neighbourhood in Baghdad by a multinational force. None of the kidnappers were found in the house at the time. The Telegraph reported that \\"A deal had been struck with a man detained the previous night who was one of the leaders of the kidnappers. He was allowed a telephone call to warn his henchmen to leave the kidnap house. When the troops moved in and found the prisoners alive, they also let him go as promised.\\" The multinational force was led by elements of 'Task Force Black' - a counter-kidnap unit consisting of British, American and Canadian JTF2 special forces. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police and Canadian Security Intelligence Service were also involved. The three surviving hostages were in good medical condition. While captive, they had been allowed to exercise and Kember had received medication he needs.The New York Times coverage Although happy that the hostages were freed, CPT placed primary responsibility for the kidnapping on the coalition itself: \\"We believe that the illegal occupation of Iraq by Multinational Forces is the root cause of the insecurity which led to this kidnapping and so much pain and suffering in Iraq.\\" CPT initially made no mention of appreciation to coalition forces for their efforts to free the hostages in its statement, but did so in a later addenda after considerable media attention.CPT comments on the release of hostages It was reported that the CPT had not cooperated with the SAS officials who coordinated the release operation. CPT co-director Doug Pritchard stated that they did not want a \\"military raid\\" to occur and preferred to work with diplomats.Kember‚Äôs muted thanks fuels SAS rescue row - Sunday Times - Times Online Work in Colombia CPT has had a team based in Barrancabermeja, Colombia since 2001. The focus of their work has been accompanying a number of communities along the Opon river, a tributary of the Magdalena River. The farmers and fishers from these communities displaced themselves in 2000 because of heavy fighting in 2000 between the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). Since the community members returned to their homes in 2001, the team has had a nearly daily presence in the area to support the people, work to prevent intimidation by both AUC and FARC and document human rights abuses if they occur.

Brown told the BBC at the time that harassment of the Christian volunteers by Israeli settlers was common, Lamberty had her passport, mobile phone and money stolen by the settlers, and that they \\"normally throw stones at us or fire their guns over our heads - but this is the most vicious assault so far\\". A Ma'on settlement security guard who arrived at the spot after some time, told the CPT team that they had been attacked because they \\"had upset the balance of power between the settlement and Palestinians.\\" A spokesperson for the settlers said \\"he had no knowledge of the incident and opposed any violation of the law\\". The next month, the team members and an Amnesty International delegate as well were attacked again. Soldiers warned the Palestinian villagers that CPT was endangering their children and the violence would be even worse if the children walked home from school through the settlement area. They blamed CPT for the violence and not the settlement attackers. The Israeli army said that they would not protect the children from Israeli settlers if they are accompanied by internationals on their way to and from school and offered to escort the children safely themselves, if the internationals left. Two days later, the children were again chased by settlers from the Havat Ma‚Äôon settlement. The Israeli army patrol, which was present, did not intervene. To avoid the attacks, the children have to take a long alternative 2 hours long way. In response to these attacks, the Israeli Knesset Committee for Children's Rights initiated an order to have soldiers escort the Palestinian children to school in At-Tuwani.

The film was written and directed by Pen Densham. The original music score was composed by Mark Mancina. Plot summary In the late 17th century, a black gentleman, Hibble, takes custody of a girl, Flora, who is being physically mistreated by abusive nuns at a London orphanage. The two set off on a journey to the American Colonies where Flora will be raised by her guardian, Mrs Allworthy. As they set out, Hibble begins to read to Flora the memoirs of her mother, Moll Flanders. In a flashback, Moll Flanders' story unfolds. After bearing her in a prison cell, Moll's own mother was hanged for theft. Moll grows up in a church orphanage. When a priest sexually assaults her, she stabs him with a knitting needle and is in turn whipped. Moll escapes despite being arrested and is eventually taken in by Mrs Allworthy, the ruthless proprietor of an upscale London brothel. Life as a prostitute takes a toll on Moll and, although she befriends Hibble, she is mistreated by her madame, Mrs Allworthy. Eventually, a kind but eccentric anatomy artist named Jonathan begins paying her to model for him. He starts to earn Moll's trust by taking her in after she is brutally beaten by an angry religious group. Moll gradually falls in love with Jonathan and becomes pregnant. For a while, their life seems happy. Then Jonathan grows gravely ill and dies. Devastated by the loss, Moll later gives birth to a baby girl. She encounters Allworthy and her stalwart servant Hibble once more, when Allworthy kidnaps Moll and takes her aboard a ship bound for Virginia Colony, forcing her to abandon her daughter in London. On the voyage, a storm forces the ship into a frenzy. Seizing the opportunity, Moll fights against Allworthy for control. The fight ends when both women are swept away by the raging current. Hibble looks on, horrified. After finishing his story, Hibble proclaims that Moll was lost at sea. Disillusioned, Flora blames Hibble for not saving her mother and nearly runs away before Moll shows up, alive and well, having survived the storm and taken Allworthy's identity and associated fortune. Moll reconciles with her daughter.

While the original book was about a woman's struggle to survive a male-dominated era (the early 17th century) and her turning to illegal actions to make it through (stealing and prostitution, among other means), the movie dealt with Moll's working on herself and improving her life.New York Times review Roger Ebert gave the movie three stars and said of the film \\"it's an original; Densham took only the name, the period, and a few notions from Defoe, and has made up the rest.\\"Roger Ebert's review in the Chicago Sun-Times Awards The International Press Academy nominated Moll Flanders for four awards: Robin Wright for Best Actress in a Drama, John Lynch for Supporting Actor in a drama, Stockard Channing for Best Supporting Actress in a Drama, and for Consolata Boyle's Costume Design.

The Red Wing Collectors Society is a special interest collecting organization in the United States with a membership of about 5000.http://collectingclubs.com/Show_Club.asp?ID=820&fmt;=1 ACC RWCS informational entry  Organization history  The Red Wing Collectors Society (RWCS) was founded in 1977 in conjunction with the Red Wing Collectors Society Newsletter, published by Dave Newkirk. The popularity of the RWCS Newsletter subscription and the publication of \\"The Clay Giants\\" by Rev. Lyndon Veil laid the cornerstone for a meeting of like-minded collectors to gather in Red Wing, MN in July 1977. It was at that one-day event held at the Goodhue County Historical Society in July 1977 that the RWCS officially became an organization. Those who attended the event and joined the RWCS that day are considered charter members of the organization. Of the 300-500 people that attended the event, just over 200 people became members and over 75 of those members are still active as of October 2008. From its start the RWCS has been dedicated to keeping what its members refer to as the \\"Red Wing legacy\\" alive. Its members focus on continually learning about the pottery products made in Red Wing, Minnesota and on making that information available to others.http://www.redwingcollectors.org/content/blogcategory/18/51/ About Us - RWCS Organization structure The RWCS maintains a board of directors that is responsible for many of the decisions of the Society. Positions on the board include President, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer, Historian, Auction Manager, Education Manager, Commemorative Manager, and two Representatives-at-large. The Society's Executive Director is a non-voting member of the board. Board meeting times and locations are published in the bimonthly newsletter and are open for any member to attend. During the annual Convention, held the second weekend in July, there is a general business meeting in which all members of the Society present may vote on issues, bylaw changes, and elect new officers to the board during election years. =Membership= Membership is available to any individual who pays the annual membership dues. There are two levels of membership, Primary and Associate. A Primary member receives all benefits of membership, which include a bimonthly newsletter, the right to vote at the annual meeting, the ability to attend all portions of Society functions, the right to purchase a commemorative, and access to the Society's lending library of video materials. The cost of Primary membership dues is $35 annually as of August, 2013. An Associate membership is available to any member of a household in which there is already a Primary member (i.e. a spouse or child of a Primary member). Associate membership is $15 annually and includes all the benefits of membership with the exclusion of receipt of a newsletter. =Chapters= There are multiple local chapters of the Society. Each chapter is chartered by the RWCS and holds its own meetings and functions throughout the year. Many of them also hold smaller functions in conjunction with the two RWCS sponsored events, the July Convention and the MidWinter GetTogether, held in February. Membership in the RWCS is a requirement for membership in one of its chapters. Chapters often operate much like the Society but on a smaller scale, including the production of chapter commemoratives as a fundraising activity. As of 2008 there were sixteen chapters in the United States. Golden State Red Wing Chapter founded In 1987 in California.http://www.goldenstateredwing.com/ Annual events The RWCS holds two official events every year, the Convention and MidWinter GetTogether. =Convention= The July Convention is held every year and is the original event of the society. The first convention was held in July 1977 in Red Wing, Minnesota. Since then there has been an annual convention and business meeting of the society in July in Red Wing. The most recent venue has been the Red Wing High School. Educational seminars, an auction, a show and sale, displays of pottery, and children's events are held. =MidWinter GetTogether= The MidWinter GetTogether is held in February. Meant to be an event that may relocate to new locations if possible, it has been held in Des Moines, Iowa since at least 2003. It was held in Wisconsin in 2015 and 2016 and will return to Des Moines in 2017. This is a smaller event than the Convention and is attended by fewer members.

U.N. headquarters is in New York City. The agency is among the most widespread and recognizable social welfare organizations in the world, with a presence in 192 countries and territories. UNICEF's activities include providing immunizations and disease prevention, administering treatment for children and mothers with HIV, enhancing childhood and maternal nutrition, improving sanitation, promoting education, and providing emergency relief in response to disasters. UNICEF is the successor of the International Children's Emergency Fund (ICEF), created in 1946 by the U.N. Relief Rehabilitation Administration to provide immediate relief to children and mothers affected by World War II. The same year, the U.N. General Assembly established the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) to further institutionalize post-war relief work. In 1950, UNICEF's mandate was extended to address the long-term needs of children and women, particularly in developing countries. In 1953, the organization became a permanent part of the United Nations System, and its name was subsequently changed to its current form, though it retains the original acronym. UNICEF relies entirely on contributions from governments and private donors. Its total income as of 2018 was $5.2 billion, of which two-thirds came from governments; private groups and individuals contributed the rest through national committees. It is governed by a 36-member executive board that establishes policies, approves programs, and oversees administrative and financial plans. The board is made up of government representatives elected by the United Nations Economic and Social Council, usually for three-year terms. UNICEF's programs emphasize developing community-level services to promote the health and well-being of children. Most of its work is in the field, with a network that includes 150 country offices, headquarters and other facilities and 34 \\"national committees\\" that carry out its mission through programs developed with host governments. Seven regional offices provide technical assistance to country offices as needed, while its Supply Division‚Äîbased in Copenhagen and New York‚Äîhelps provide over $3 billion in critical aid and services. In 2018, UNICEF assisted in the birth of 27 million babies, administered pentavalent vaccines to an estimated 65.5 million children, provided education for 12 million children, treated four million children with severe acute malnutrition, and responded to 285 humanitarian emergencies in 90 countries. UNICEF has received recognition for its work, including the Nobel Peace Prize in 1965, the Indira Gandhi Prize in 1989 and the Princess of Asturias Award in 2006. During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, UNICEF, along with the World Health Organization and other agencies, published guidance about healthy parenting.  Governance  UNICEF-care tent in Sudan UNICEF relies on country offices to help carry out its work through a unique program of cooperation developed with the host government. The programs last five years and seek to develop practical strategies for fulfilling and protecting the rights of children and women. Regional offices guide this work and provide technical assistance to country offices as needed. Overall management and administration of the organization take place at its New York headquarters, where global policy on children is shaped. Guiding and monitoring all of UNICEF's work is an Executive Board made up of 36 members who are government representatives. The Board establishes policies, approves programs and decides on administrative and financial plans and budgets. Its work is coordinated by the Bureau, comprising the President and four Vice-Presidents, each officer representing one of the five regional groups. These five officers are elected by the Executive Board annually from among its members, with the presidency rotating among the regional groups on an annual basis. As a matter of custom, permanent members of the Security Council do not serve as officers of the Executive Board. The Office of the Secretary of the Executive Board helps maintain an effective relationship between the Executive Board and the UNICEF secretariat, and organizes field visits by board members.UNICEF School in a box contains basic educational items for one teacher and 40 students =UNICEF Regional Offices= The following countries are home to UNICEF Regional Offices. * The Americas and Caribbean Regional Office, Panama City, Panama * Europe and Central Asia Regional Office, Geneva, Switzerland * East Asia and the Pacific Regional Office, Bangkok, Thailand * Eastern and Southern Africa Regional Office, Nairobi, Kenya * Middle East and North Africa Regional Office, Amman, Jordan * South Asia Regional Office, Kathmandu, Nepal * West and Central Africa Regional Office, Senegal UNICEF national committees There are national committees in 36 developed countries, each established as an independent local non-governmental organization.

National Committees collectively account for about one-third of the agency's annual income, including from corporations, civil society organizations, around six million individual donors worldwide. Promotion and fundraising In the United States, Nepal and some other countries, UNICEF is known for its \\"Trick-Or-Treat for UNICEF\\" program in which children collect money for UNICEF from the houses they trick-or-treat on Halloween night, sometimes instead of candy. The program was discontinued in Canada in 2006. UNICEF is present in 191 countries and territories around the world, but not involved in nine others (Bahamas, Brunei, Cyprus, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Malta, Mauritius, Monaco, Singapore, and Taiwan). Many people in developed countries first hear about UNICEF's work through the activities of one of the 36 National Committees for UNICEF. These non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are primarily responsible for fundraising, selling UNICEF greeting cards and products, creating private and public partnerships, advocating for children's rights, and providing other support.

On 7 September 2006, an agreement between UNICEF and the Spanish Catalan association football club FC Barcelona was reached whereby the club would donate ‚Ç¨1.5 million per year to the organization for five years. As part of the agreement, FC Barcelona would wear the UNICEF logo on the front of their uniforms in the colour yellow (as seen in the picture on the right of Lionel Messi). This was the first time a football club sponsored an organization rather than the other way around. It was also the first time in FC Barcelona's history that they have had another organization's name across the front of their uniform. In 2016, the team signed a new four-year sponsorship deal with UNICEF guaranteeing the organization ¬£1.58 million per year and free advertising.https://www.thedrum.com/news/2016/02/25/barcelona- fc-extend-partnership-unicef-and-increase-annual-donation In January 2007 UNICEF struck a partnership with Canada's national tent pegging team.

In 2010, UNICEF created a partnership with Phi Iota Alpha, making them the first Greek Lettered Organization UNICEF has ever worked with. In 2011, Phi Iota Alpha raised over $20,000 for the Tap Project and the Trick or Treats for UNICEF Campaign. In 2013, they agreed a contract with Greek association football champions Olympiacos F.C. who will show the organization's logo on the front of their shirts. = UNICEF Kid Power = Started in 2015, Kid Power is a division of UNICEF that was created as an effort to involve kids in helping other kids in need. UNICEF Kid Power developed the world's first Wearable for Good, called Kid Power Bands, which is a kids‚Äô fitness tracker bracelet that connects to a smartphone app. The app lets users complete missions, which counts total steps and awards points. The points then unlock funding from partners, which is then used by UNICEF to deliver lifesaving packets of therapeutic food to severely malnourished children around the world. =Trick-or-Treat UNICEF box= Since 1950, when a group of children in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, donated $17 which they received on Halloween to help post-World War II victims, the Trick-or-Treat UNICEF box has become a tradition in North America during the fall. These small orange boxes are handed to children at schools and other locations before 31 October. , the Trick-or-Treat for UNICEF campaign has collected approximately C$91 million in Canada and over US$167 million in the U.S. =Cartoons for Children's Rights= In 1994, UNICEF held a summit encouraging animation studios around the world to create individual animated spots demonstrating the international rights of children. Cartoons for Children's Rights is the collection of animated shorts based on UNICEF's Convention on the Rights of the Child. =Corporate partnership= To raise money to support its Education and Literacy Programs, UNICEF collaborates with companies worldwide ‚Äì international as well as small- and medium-sized businesses. Since 2004, the organization has been supported by Montblanc, working collaboratively to help the world's children getting better access to education. According to Vaccine News Daily, Merck & Co. partnered with UNICEF in June 2013 to decrease maternal mortality, HIV and tuberculosis prevalence in South Africa. Merck's program \\"Merck for Mothers\\" will give US$500 million worldwide for programs that improve health for expectant mothers and their children. In May 2010, Crucell N.V. announced an additional US$110 million award from UNICEF to supply its pentavalent pediatric vaccine Quinvaxem to the developing world. =Corporate Social Responsibility= UNICEF works directly with companies to improve their business practices, bringing them in line with obligations under international law, and ensuring that they respect children's rights in the realms of the marketplace, workplace, and the community. In 2012, UNICEF worked with Save the Children and The United Nations Global Compact to develop the Children's Rights and Business Principles and now these guidelines form the basis UNICEF's advice to companies. UNICEF works with companies seeking to improve their social sustainability by guiding them through a due diligence process where issues throughout their supply chain, such as child labour, can be identified and actions to ratify them are put in place. =Girl Star= The Girl Star project is a series of films which documents stories of girls from the most disadvantaged communities across five northern states in India who, through via education, have managed to break socioeconomic constraints to make a success of their lives and become self-sufficient. These young women have grown to become role models in their communities, inspiring younger girls to go to school and continue their education. They have selected professions from the most conventional such as teaching and nursing, to the most unconventional like archery, bee-keeping, , often entering what has traditionally been a man's domain. =Kids United= Kids United, succeeded by Kids United Nouvelle G√©n√©ration (Kids United New Generation), is a French musical group consisting of five children born between 2000 and 2009 (six children when the group was originally formed). Erza Muqoli was a founding member. It was created to support UNICEF campaigns and is sponsored by H√©l√®ne S√©gara and Corneille, two francophone singers.

In addition to the general promotion of the charity at matches and events, the 2021 Rugby League World Cup Chief Executive has also stated that there will be an officially designated \\"UNICEF\\" game at some point during the Men's World Cup. Celebrity ambassadors UNICEF Ambassadors are leaders in the entertainment industry, representing the fields of film, television, music, sports and beyond. They help raise awareness of the needs of children, and use their talent and status to fundraise, advocate, and educate on behalf of UNICEF. Facilities One of the gates to the old UNICEF World Warehouse The UNICEF research centre in Florence =UNICEF World Warehouse= The old UNICEF World Warehouse is a large facility in Denmark, which hosts UNICEF deliverable goods as well as co-hosts emergency goods for United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC). Until 2012 the facilities was a 25,000m2 warehouse at Marmormolen in Copenhagen. With construction of a 45,000m2 UN City that is to house all UN activities in Copenhagen under one roof, the warehouse service has been relocated to outer parts of the Freeport of Copenhagen. The facility houses the UNICEF Supply Division which manages strategic hubs in Dubai, Douala, and Col√≥n. The warehouse contains a variety of items, e.g., food supplements, water purification tablets, dietary and vitamin supplements, and the \\"School in a box\\" (illustrated above). =UNICEF Innocenti Research Centre= The UNICEF Innocenti Research Centre in Florence, Italy, was established in 1988. The centre, formally known as the International Child Development Centres, has as its prime objectives to improve international understanding of issues relating to children's rights, to promote economic policies that advance the cause of children, and to help facilitate the full implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child in industrialized and developing countries. The program for 2006‚Äì2008 was approved by UNICEF Executive Board in September 2005. It reaffirms the centre's academic freedom and the focus of IRC's research on knowledge gaps, emerging questions and sensitive issues which are relevant to the realization of children's rights, in developing and industrialized countries. It capitalizes on IRC's role as an interface between UNICEF field experience, international experts, research networks and policy makers and is designed to strengthen the centre's institutional collaboration with regional academic and policy institutions, pursuing the following goals: * Generation and communication of strategic and influential knowledge on issues affecting children and the realization of their rights; * Knowledge exchange and brokering; * Support to UNICEF's advocacy, policy's and program development in support of the Millennium Agenda * Securing and strengthening the centre's institutional and financial basis. Three interrelated strategies guide the achievement of these goals: * Evidence-based analysis drawing on quantitative and qualitative information, the application of appropriate methodologies, and the development of recommendations to assess and inform advocacy and policy action. * Enhanced partnerships with research and policy institutions and development actors, globally and at regional level, in developing and industrialized countries. * Communication and leveraging of research findings and recommendations to support policy development and advocacy initiatives through strategic dissemination of studies and contribution to relevant events and fora.Innocenti Research Centre, UNICEF-irc.org Position on ethical themes UNICEF's programmatic objectives include the promotion of safe abortions and education in family planning and in the use of contraception. In a joint declaration of 2011, UNICEF argued the need to combat the spread of selective abortion, through plans that favored, inter alia, the use of safe abortion services and family planning programs in order to decrease the use of abortion. In 2013, together with WHO, it published an integrated plan of guidelines for the prevention of infant mortality caused by pneumonia and diarrhea, including, among the recommended strategies for promoting the health of women and children, access to safe abortion. UNICEF has adopted the ABC strategy (\\"abstinence, be faithful and consistent condom use\\") promoted in various international AIDS prevention interventions. The strategy was later updated as the \\"ABC to Z model\\", to include Delaying and Voluntary Counselling & Testing. In 1996 the Vatican withdrew its symbolic contribution to UNICEF on the occasion of the publication by UNICEF of a manual on emergency operations for refugee populations which supported the spread of emergency contraceptive practices. Despite this, on several occasions senior UNICEF officials have denied that the organization promoted abortion or family planning methods. UNICEF also supports the adoption by states of laws that guarantee LGBT couples and their children the legal recognition of their status, as these rules would help ensure the best interests of children. Controversies =Adoption program= UNICEF has a policy preferring orphanages only be used as temporary accommodation for children when there is no alternative. UNICEF has historically opposed the creation of large-scale, permanent orphanages for children, preferring instead to find children places in their (extended) families and communities, wherever possible. This has led UNICEF to be skeptical of international adoption efforts as a solution to child care problems in developing countries; UNICEF has preferred to see children cared for in their birth countries rather than be adopted by foreign parents. A 2015 article in U.S. News & World Report magazine asserted UNICEF's intervention that on giving large cash payments to developing countries can lead to a cessation of international adoptions until all of its recommendations are in place, and have even labelled UNICEF a \\"villain\\" for the extent of its negative impact on orphans. Elizabeth Bartholet and Paulo Barrozo have written in this context, encouraging adoption protocols to take on a more child- centric viewpoint. =Child mortality= One concern is that the child mortality rate has not decreased in some areas as rapidly as had been planned, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, where in 2013 \\"the region still has the highest child mortality rate: 92 deaths per 1000 live births\\".Danzhen You, Lucia Hug and Yao Chen, \\"Levels and Trends in Child Mortality: Report 2014: Estimates Developed by the UN Interagency Group for Child mortality Estimation\\" . Published by the United Nations Children's Fund, The World Bank, the World Health Organization and the United Nations Population Division, 2014. Retrieved August 1, 2015. p. 1. and that \\"Globally, nearly half of under-five deaths are attributable to undernutrition.\\" In 2005, Richard Horton editor-in-chief of The Lancet, editorialized that \\"over 60% of these deaths were and remain preventable\\" and that the coverage levels for these interventions are \\"appallingly low in the 42 countries that account for 90% of child deaths\\". A $27 million UNICEF program in West Africa in 2001-2005 which was meant to decrease child deaths from disease has been deemed a failure, according to a study that found higher survival rates of children in some regions that weren't included in that program.https://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/unicef-program-failed-to-save- children-study-1.939386 Critics argue that UNICEF's focus on rights rather than safety and survival is idealistic, and that by focusing on politicized children's rights instead of mere child survival, UNICEF has contributed indirectly to the child mortality crisis.http://www.independent.org/news/article.asp?id=1443 =NSA surveillance= Documents released by Edward Snowden in December 2013 showed that \\"UNICEF\\" was among the surveillance targets of British and American intelligence agencies.GCHQ and NSA targeted charities, Germans, Israeli PM and EU chief The Guardian 20 December 2013 See also Afghan New Beginnings Programme * Alliance for Healthy Cities * Awaaz do ‚Äì India * Facts for Life * Integrated Management of Childhood Illness * James P.

The event was then the largest in the San Francisco Bay Area since the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, which measured 6.9 on the moment magnitude scale, but was later surpassed by the 2014 South Napa earthquake. Ground shaking from the Alum Rock quake reached San Francisco and Oakland and other points further north. Sixty thousand felt reports existed far beyond Santa Rosa, as far north as Eugene, Oregon. Earthquake The shock originated on the Calaveras Fault and ruptured an area of the fault for a length of about beginning at the hypocenter and extending southeast. There was no evidence of any surface rupture along the fault caused by the earthquake. David Oppenheimer, a seismologist at the United States Geological Survey (USGS), said that although the quake was felt as a strong jolt over a wide region, it was more significant because it caused stress changes in the Calaveras Fault and the nearby Hayward Fault. =Damage= Intensity VI (Strong) effects included broken windows and items that were knocked off store shelves, but the event caused no serious damage or injuries.

Early life and education Lydia Maria Adams was born in Flint, Michigan to Oscar and Elizabeth Adams (n√©e Walton), the second of three children. Her father was an attorney. Elizabeth died when Lydia was five, leaving her sister, who later married Oscar, to raise Lydia and her siblings. Adams completed her primary education in the Flint public school system. She became a teacher, then studied at the Michigan State Normal School (also called the Ypsilanti Normal School) and married her colleague Alton D. DeWitt in 1878. They had two children, Stella, born in 1879, and Clyde, born in 1880. The family moved several times during this period as Alton obtained different jobs in the Michigan public school system; Lydia taught at a variety of public schools. Career and research In 1895, she began medical studies at the University of Michigan; she earned her Doctor of Medicine degree in 1898 and Bachelor of Science degree in 1899. Lydia and Alton DeWitt separated during this time. DeWitt remained at University of Michigan for the beginning of her career in research. She held a position under George Dock as a demonstrator of anatomy from 1896‚Äì1897, while she was still studying medicine, then became an assistant professor of histology until 1902, and associate professor of histology from 1902‚Äì1910. She took a brief sabbatical to study at the University of Berlin in 1906. That year, she was starred in the first edition of American Men of Science for her notable work in microscopic anatomy and neuroanatomy. In 1910, DeWitt began to work at Washington University in St. Louis as an instructor of pathology, and also took a post in the St. Louis Department of Health as a pathologist/bacteriologist. Her research there was so noted that she was invited to join the faculty of the University of Chicago to work on chemotherapy for tuberculosis, which she did in 1912. She was an assistant professor of pathology there until 1918, when she was elevated to associate professor. She retired in 1926. As a woman scientist, DeWitt was excluded from the Faculty Research Club and the Junior Faculty Research Club at the University of Michigan. In response, she founded and headed the Women's Research Club in 1902. DeWitt's research career covered a variety of topics and organ systems, including the pathology of tuberculosis. She studied muscles extensively, in their pathology and nervous connections, as well as the disease myositis ossificans. Other topics of her research included esophageal anatomy, membranous dysmenorrhea, and the anatomy of connections in the mammalian heart. Her early research, at the University of Michigan, concerned the structure of nerve endings in both sensory nerves and motor nerves of striated muscle and smooth muscle. This also included studies of muscle spindles, which were published in 1897, before she finished her medical studies. Her first solo research was published in 1901 and concerned the pyloric glands and their structure in different species. While at the St. Louis Department of Health, she conducted extensive research on diphtheria and diagnosis of typhoid. Her work on isolating the islets of Langerhans cells from the pancreas and her discovery that they secreted a substance involved in carbohydrate metabolism set the stage for the discovery of insulin and its role in diabetes by a Canadian team of researchers. At the University of Chicago, DeWitt and her team worked on developing a drug to treat tuberculosis based on the work of Paul Ehrlich, who developed a treatment for syphilis by chemically modifying a dye that would stain parasites. Working with Hope Sherman, Gladys Leavell, and Lauretta Bender, among others, DeWitt examined several dyes as potential precursors to an anti-tuberculosis drug, including methylene blue and trypan red. This research did not bear fruit immediately, though the method was later used successfully to develop a chemotherapy for tuberculosis, and as a model for developing other drugs. Honors In 1902, DeWitt joined the Association of American Anatomists. In 1914, she received an honorary Master's degree from the University of Michigan, her alma mater. DeWitt was the president of the Chicago Pathological Society from 1924‚Äì1925. The American Medical Association elected her an associate fellow. She was also a member of the Michigan Medical Society and the American Association of Pathologists and Bacteriologists. Death and legacy DeWitt died at the age of 69 in Winters, Texas at the home of her daughter, of her chronic health problems (arteriosclerosis and hypertension). A research grant to support women scientists at the University of Michigan bears her name.

Israel Defense Forces (IDF) entered the camp, and other areas under the administration of the Palestinian Authority, during the Second Intifada, as part of Operation Defensive Shield. The Jenin camp was targeted after Israel reported that it had \\"served as a launch site for numerous terrorist attacks against both Israeli civilians and Israeli towns and villages in the area.\\" The IDF employed infantry, commando forces, and assault helicopters. Palestinian militants had prepared for a fight, booby trapping the camp, and after an Israeli column walked into an ambush, the army began to rely more heavily on the use of armored bulldozers to clear out booby traps laid inside the camp. On April 11, Palestinian militants began to surrender. Israeli troops began withdrawing from the camp on April 18. On April 7, senior Palestinian official Saeb Erekat suggested to CNN that some 500 Palestinians had been killed in the camp.

Covering an area of 0.423 square kilometers, in 2002, it was home to 13,055 UNRWA registered Palestinian refugees. Most of the camp's residents originally hail from the Carmel mountains and region of Haifa, and many maintain close ties with their relatives inside the Green Line. Other camp residents include Palestinians from Gaza and Tulkarm who moved into the area in the late 1970s, and those who came from Jordan after the establishment of the Palestinian Authority (PA) with the signing of the Oslo Accords in 1993. Israel considered the influence of Islamist organizations in the camp to be relatively mild, compared to other camps. } Organizational affiliations in the camp differed from those of the city, in that they were based mostly on who could provide financial support, rather than on ideology. Camp militants repelled attempts by PA seniors to exercise authority in the camp. In a February 2002 show of force, residents burned seven vehicles that were sent by the governor of Jenin and opened fire on the PA men. Ata Abu Rumeileh was designated the chief security officer of the camp by its residents. He oversaw access to the entrances to the camp, instituted roadblocks, investigated \\"suspicious characters\\" and kept unwanted strangers away. Known to Palestinians as \\"the martyrs' capital\\", the camp's militants, some 200 armed men, included members of Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, Tanzim, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) and Hamas. By Israel's count, at least 28 suicide bombers were dispatched from the Jenin camp from 2000 to 2003 during the Second Intifada. One of the key planners for several of the attacks was Mahmoud Tawalbe, who worked in a record store while also heading the local PIJ cell. Israeli army weekly Bamahane attributes at least 31 militant attacks, totaling 124 victims, to Jenin during the same period, more than any other city in the West Bank. Prior to the undertaking of the Israeli operation the IDF Spokesman attributed 23 suicide bombings and 6 attempted bombings against civilians in Israel to Palestinians from Jenin. Major attacks and suicide bombings perpetrated by Palestinian militant groups from Jenin included the Matza restaurant suicide bombing, a Palestinian suicide bombing of an Israeli Arab-owned restaurant in Haifa, Israel which has been called a massacre and resulted in the deaths of 16 Israeli civilians, and over 40 more civilians being injured. The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs attributed attacks emanating from Jenin to Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and Fatah. Prelude Israel's Operation Defensive Shield began on March 29 with an incursion into Ramallah, followed by Tulkarem and Qalqilya on April 1, Bethlehem on April 2, and Jenin and Nablus on April 3. By this date, six Palestinian cities and their surrounding towns, villages, and refugee camps, had been occupied by the IDF.Taylor & Francis Group (2004) Europa World Year Book 2: Kazakhstan-Zimbabwe Published by Taylor & Francis, p 3314 Limited Israeli forces had entered the camp along a single route twice in the previous month; they encountered heavy resistance and quickly withdrew. Unlike other camps, the organizations in Jenin had a joint commander: Hazem Ahmad Rayhan Qabha, known as \\"Abu Jandal,\\" an officer in the Palestinian National and Islamic Forces who had fought in Lebanon, served in the Iraqi Army, and who had been involved in several encounters with the IDF. He set up a war room and divided the camp into fifteen sub-sectors, deploying about twenty armed men in each.Harel and Isacharoff (2004), pp. 254‚Äì255 During the battle, he began calling himself \\"The Martyr Abu Jandal\\". Since the previous Israeli withdrawal, Palestinian militants had prepared by boobytrapping both the town and camp's streets in a bid to trap Israeli soldiers. Following his surrender to Israeli forces, Thabet Mardawi, an Islamic Jihad fighter, said that Palestinian fighters had spread \\"between 1000 and 2000 bombs and booby traps\\" throughout the camp, some big ones for tanks (weighing as much as 113 kilograms), most others the size of water bottles. \\"Omar the Engineer\\", a Palestinian bombmaker, said that some 50 homes were booby trapped: \\"We chose old and empty buildings and the houses of men who were wanted by Israel because we knew the soldiers would search for them.\\" More powerful bombs with remote detonators were placed inside trash bins in the street and inside the cars of wanted men. Omar said that everyone in the camp, including children, knew where the explosives were located, and noted that this constituted a major weakness to their defenses, since during the Israeli incursion, the wires to more than a third of the bombs were cut by soldiers guided by collaborators. After an IDF action in Ramallah in March resulted in television broadcast footage that was considered unflattering, the IDF high command decided not to allow reporters to join the forces. Like other cities targeted in Defensive Shield, Jenin was declared a \\"closed military zone\\" and placed under curfew before the entrance of Israeli troops, remaining sealed off throughout the invasion.Selby, 2003, p. 1. Water and electricity supplies to the city were also cut off and remained unavailable to residents throughout. According to Efraim Karsh, before the fighting started, the IDF used loudspeakers broadcasting in Arabic to urge the locals to evacuate the camp, and he estimates that some 11,000 left.Karsh (2004), p. 233 Stephanie Gutmann also noted that the IDF used bullhorns and announcements in Arabic to inform the residents of the invasion, and that the troops massed outside the camp for a day because of rain. She estimated that 1,200 remained in the camp, but that it was impossible to tell how many of them were fighters.Gutmann (2005), pp. 163‚Äì164 After the battle, Israeli intelligence estimated that half the population of noncombatants had left before the invasion, and 90% had done so by the third day, leaving around 1,300 people. Others estimated that 4,000 people had remained in the camp.Gresh and Vidal, 2004 p. 169. Some camp residents reported hearing the Israeli calls to evacuate, while others said they did not. Many thousands did leave the camp, with women and children usually permitted to move into the villages in the surrounding hills or the neighbouring city. However, the men who left were almost all temporarily detained. Instructed by Israeli soldiers to strip before they were taken away, journalists who entered Jenin following the invasion remarked that heaps of discarded clothing in the ruined streets showed where they were taken into custody. As the fighting started, Ali Safouri, a commander of the Islamic Jihad's Al-Quds Brigades in the camp, said: \\"We have prepared unexpected surprises for the enemy. We are determined to pay him back double, and teach him a lesson he will not forget. ‚Ä¶ We will attack him on the home front, in Jerusalem, in Haifa, and in Jaffa, everywhere. We welcome them, and we have prepared a special graveyard in the Jenin camp for them. We swore on the martyrs that we would place a curfew on the Zionist cities and avenge every drop of blood spilled upon our sacred land. We call on the soldiers of Sharon to refuse his orders, because entering the [Jenin] camp‚Ä¶ the capital of the martyrs' [operations], will, Allah willing, be the last thing they do in their lives\\". The Israeli command sent in three thrusts consisting mainly of the reservist 5th Infantry Brigade from the town of Jenin to the north, as well as a company of the Nahal Brigade from the southeast and Battalion 51 of the Golani Brigade from the southwest. The force of 1,000 troops also included Shayetet 13 and Duvdevan Unit special forces, the Armoured Corps, and Combat Engineers with armored bulldozer for neutralizing the roadside bombs that would line the alleys of the camp according to Military Intelligence. Anticipating the heaviest resistance in Nablus, IDF commanders sent two regular infantry brigades there, assuming they could take over the Jenin camp in 48‚Äì72 hours with just the one reservist brigade. The force's entry was delayed until April 2 due to rain. The 5th Infantry Brigade did not have any experience in close quarters combat and did not have a commander when Operation Defensive Shield started, since the last commander's service ended a few days earlier. His substitute was a reserve officer, Lieutenant Colonel Yehuda Yedidya, who got his rank after the operation began. His soldiers were not trained for urban fighting.Harel and Isacharoff (2004), pp. 253‚Äì254 Battle Israeli soldiers in Jenin A wounded Israeli soldier being evacuated Israeli forces entered Jenin on April 2. On the first day, reserve company commander Moshe Gerstner was killed in a PIJ sector. This caused a further delay.Harel and Isacharoff (2004), p. 254 By April 3, the city was secured, but the fighting in the camp was just beginning. Israeli sources say that the IDF incursion into the camp relied primarily on infantry to minimize civilian casualties, but interviews with eyewitnesses suggest that tanks and helicopters were also used in the first two days. In Pierre Rehov's documentary The Road to Jenin, a Palestinian doctor claimed that on the second day, the city's hospital was hit by eleven tank shells. However, both Rehov's film and Richard Landes's 2005 film Pallywood, the supposed hits shown on Jenin hospital were compared to an actual building hit by Merkava tank shelling, suggesting that the supposed hit marks were staged.Landes, Richard, Pallywood (2005) An Israeli tank in Jenin To reach the camp, a Caterpillar D-9 armored bulldozer drove along a three-quarter-mile stretch of the main street to clear it of booby traps. An Israeli Engineering Corps officer logged 124 separate explosions set off by the bulldozer. A Fatah leader in the camp later said that it was only when his forces saw the Israelis advancing on foot that they decided to stay and fight. Israeli soldiers occupying a building during the fighting On the third day, the Palestinians were still dug in, defying Israeli expectations, and by then seven Israeli soldiers had been killed. Mardawi later testified to having killed two of them from close range, using an M-16. As the IDF advanced, the Palestinians fell back to the heavily defended camp center ‚Äì the Hawashin district. AH-1 Cobra helicopters were used to strike Palestinian positions on rooftops using wire-guided missiles, and about a dozen armored D-9 bulldozers were deployed, widening alleys, clearing paths for tanks, and detonating booby traps. Palestinians said that Israeli troops rode atop the bulldozers and fired rocket propelled grenades. On April 6, Mahmoud Tawalbe and two other militants went into a house so as to get close enough to a tank or armored D-9 bulldozer to plant a bomb. Tawalbe and another militant were killed during the action. A British military expert working in the camp for Amnesty International reported that a D9 driver saw him, and subsequently rammed a wall down onto him and one of his fighters. The Islamic Jihad website announced that Tawalbe had died when he blew up in his booby-trapped home on the Israeli soldiers inside it, and that he \\"had thwarted all attempts by the occupation to evacuate the camp residents to make it easier for the Israelis to destroy [the camp] on the heads of the fighters.\\" On that same day, IDF attack helicopters reportedly increased their missile attacks, which slowed but did not cease the next day. IDF chief of staff (Ramatkal) Shaul Mofaz urged the officers to speed things up. They asked for twenty-four more hours. Mofaz told reporters that the fighting would be complete by the end of the week, April 6. In some of the sectors, the forces were advancing at a rate of fifty meters a day.Harel and Isacharoff (2004), p. 255 Israeli intelligence assumed that the vast majority of the camp's residents were still in it. Most commanders argued that this obligated a careful advance for fear of striking civilians, and warned that using excessive force would cost the lives of hundreds of Palestinians. Lieutenant Colonel Ofek Buchris, commander of the 51st Battalion, was left in a minority opinion, saying \\"We're being humiliated here for four days now\\". When Mofaz instructed the officers to be more aggressive and fire five antitank missiles at every house before entering, one of them contemplated disobedience. Meanwhile, when asked how long he thought his forces could last given the superiority of the Israeli forces, Abu Jandal said: \\"No. That's not true. We have the weapon of surprise. We have the weapon of honor. We have the divine weapon, the weapon of Allah who stands at our side. We have weapons that are better than theirs. I am the one with the truth, and I put my faith in Allah, while they put their faith in a tank\\". Buchris continued to employ the tactics of softening up enemy resistance with antitank fire and extensive use of bulldozers, developing a method to expose IDF soldiers to less risk: first, a bulldozer would ram the corner of a house, opening a hole, and then an IDF Achzarit troop carrier would arrive to disembark troops into the house, where they would clear it of any militants found inside. Buchris' battalion was advancing faster than the reserve forces, creating a bridgehead within the camp that attracted most of the Palestinian fire. During the first week of fighting, the battalion suffered five casualties. On April 8, Golani Brigade commander, Colonel Tamir, arrived from Nablus. Having crawled with Buchris to the front line, he warned that the fighting style must be changed completely ‚Äì call in more troops and perhaps take the command out of the reserve brigade's hand. A total of 30 Palestinians and 2 Israeli soldiers were killed in Jenin on that same day. By evening, division commander Brigadier General Eyal Shlein told his men that the mission must be accomplished by 6:00 PM on April 9.Harel and Isacharoff (2004), p. 256 Buchris himself was later badly wounded. At 6:00 AM on April 9, reserve battalion 7020s support company was ordered to form a new line, west of the former one. Its commander, Major Oded Golomb, set out with a force to take a position in a new house. He strayed from the original path, perhaps for tactical considerations, but failed to report to his commander. The force walked into a Palestinian ambush, finding themselves in an inner courtyard surrounded by tall houses (later nicknamed \\"the bathtub\\") and under fire from all directions, and were also attacked by a suicide bomber. Rescue forces from the company and the battalion hurried to the location and were attacked with small-arms fire and explosive charges. The exchange of fire went on for several hours. A reconnaissance aircraft documented much of the fight and the footage was transmitted live and was watched in the Israeli Central Command war room by the high-ranking officers. Thirteen Israeli soldiers were killed, and the Palestinians managed to snatch three of the bodies and drag them into a nearby house. A rescue force of Shayetet 13 naval commandos under Colonel Ram Rothberg was quickly assembled. Mofaz told Rothberg that negotiation over the bodies might force the IDF to halt the operation and get it in trouble similar to the 2000 Hezbollah cross- border raid. On the edge of the alley leading to \\"the bathtub\\", Rothberg questioned the wounded reservists. Finally, the commando force entered the house where the bodies were being held, killed the Palestinian militants in close-range combat, and extracted the bodies. In the afternoon, all Israeli casualties were evacuated from the area.Harel and Isacharoff (2004), pp. 256‚Äì257 It became the deadliest day for the IDF since the end of the 1982 Lebanon War. During that day, the IDF censored reports on the events, leading to a wave of rumors. Partial information leaked through phone calls made by reservists and internet sites. By evening, when Chief of Central Command, Brigadier General Yitzhak Eitan, had a press conference, there were rumors of a helicopter carrying dozens of troops shot down, the death of the Ramatkal's deputy, and a heart attack suffered by the Minister of Defense. After the ambush, all Israeli forces began to advance by Buchris' tactics, utilizing armored bulldozers and Achzarit APCs in their push. Israeli forces also relied heavily on increased missile strikes from helicopters. Several officers demanded that F-16 jets be sent to bomb the camp, but the IDF High Command refused.Harel and Isacharoff (2004), p. 257 The dozen bulldozers and APCs pushed deep into the heart of the camp, flattening a built-up area of 200 square yards, destroying militant strongpoints. Palestinian resistance quickly collapsed, and the remaining militants retreated into the Hawashin neighborhood. IDF forces then began mopping up the final resistance in the Hawashin neighborhood. At 7:00 AM on April 11, the Palestinians began to surrender. Qabha refused to surrender and was killed, being among the last to die. Zakaria Zubeidi was among the only fighters who did not surrender. He slipped out of the area surrounded by the IDF, moved through the houses and left.Harel and Isacharoff (2004), p. 258 Mardawi surrendered along with Ali Suleiman al-Saadi, known as \\"Safouri\\", and thirty-nine others. He later said that \\"There was nothing I could do against that bulldozer\\". Battle aftermath An Israeli soldier at the end of the battle on the eve of the IDF's withdrawal from Jenin Aerial photograph of the area demolished in the Jenin camp's central Hawashin district. The battle ended on April 11. Medical teams from Canada, France, and Italy, as well as UN and ICRC officials, with trucks carrying supplies and water waited outside the camp for clearance to enter for days, but were denied entry, with Israel citing ongoing military operations.Winslow, 2007, p. 68. The first independent observers were granted access to the camp on April 16.Europa, 2004, p. 33. Israeli troops began withdrawing from the camp itself on April 18.McDonald and Fischer, 2005, p. 589/ Tanks ringed the perimeter of the camp for a few more days, but by April 24, Israeli troops had withdrawn from the autonomous zone of Jenin.Gresh and Vidal, 2004, p. 170. =Removal of bodies= The IDF announced that it would not withdraw its troops from the Jenin camp until it had collected the bodies of the Palestinian dead. The army would not confirm Palestinian reports that military trucks had removed dozens of bodies, nor would it comment on whether or not burials had taken place.Europa, 2004, p. 571. According to Haaretz, some of the bodies had already been removed from the camp by soldiers to a site near Jenin on April 11, but had not yet been buried. Palestinians allegedly buried others during the battle in a mass grave near the hospital on the outskirts of the camp. On the evening of April 11, Israeli television showed footage of refrigerator trucks waiting outside the camp to transfer bodies to \\"terrorist cemeteries\\". On April 12, Haaretz reported that > \\"The IDF intends to bury today Palestinians killed in the West Bank camp ‚Ä¶ > The sources said two infantry companies, along with members of the military > rabbinate, will enter the camp today to collect bodies. Those who can be > identified as civilians will be moved to a hospital in Jenin, and then on to > burial, while those identified as terrorists will be buried at a special > cemetery in the Jordan Valley.\\"Reinhart, 2006, pp. 219‚Äì220, footnote #12. The same day, in response to a petition presented by the Adalah organization, the Israeli High Court ordered the IDF to stop removing the bodies of Palestinians killed in battle until after a hearing on the matter. MK Ahmed Tibi, one of many signatories to the petition before the court, said that removing the bodies from the city violated international law and was \\"intended to hide the truth from the public about the killing that occurred there\\". Following the court's decision, issued by Supreme Court President Aharon Barak, the IDF stopped clearing the bodies from the camp. It was reported that by the afternoon of April 13, the IDF had determined the location of 23 bodies in the camp which were marked on maps. On April 14, the Supreme Court reversed its decision, and ruled that the IDF could remove the bodies. IDF Chief of Staff Shaul Mofaz confirmed to Israeli media on April 14 that the army intended to bury the bodies in the special cemetery. On April 15 humanitarian aid organizations were granted access to the camp for the first time since the invasion had begun. Palestinian Red Crescent Society and International Committee of the Red Cross staff entered the camp, accompanied by the IDF. Officials from the Red Crescent told lawyer Hassan Jabareen that the IDF did not allow them to move around the camps freely, and that advanced decomposition, as well as the enormous destruction in the camp, made it impossible to find and retrieve bodies without the proper equipment. That same day Adalah and LAW, the Palestinian Society for the Protection of Human Rights and the Environment, filed a petition asking the Court to order the IDF to immediately hand over the bodies of Palestinians to the Red Cross or the Red Crescent, saying that the bodies of dead Palestinians were being left to rot in the camp. On April 19, a day after Israeli troops withdrew from the camp, journalists reported counting about 23 bodies that were lined up on the outdoor grounds of the clinic, before being quickly buried by Palestinians. Tanya Reinhart notes that later Israeli media reports attempted to conceal and reinterpret their intention to transfer the bodies to the special cemetery in the Jordan Valley. As an example, she cites a July 17, 2002 article by Ze'ev Schiff in Haaretz which provided a wholly different explanation for the presence of the refrigerator trucks posted outside the city on April 11. Schiff's article said: \\"Toward the end of the fighting, the army sent three large refrigerator trucks into the city. Reservists decided to sleep in them for their air-conditioning. Some Palestinians saw dozens of covered bodies lying in the trucks and rumors spread that the Jews had filled the trucks full of Palestinian bodies.\\" Invasion aftermath =Military analyses= The Israelis said they have found explosive-making labs and factories for assembling Qassam II rockets. One Israeli special forces commander who fought in the camp said that \\"the Palestinians were admirably well prepared. They correctly analyzed the lessons of the previous raid\\". Mardawi told CNN from prison in Israel, that after learning the IDF was going to use troops, and not planes, \\"It was like hunting ‚Ä¶ like being given a prize. ‚Ä¶ The Israelis knew that any soldier who went into the camp like that was going to get killed. ‚Ä¶ I've been waiting for a moment like that for years\\". General Dan Harel, Head of the IDF Operations Directorate, said \\"There were indications it was going to be hard, but we didn't think it was going to be so hard\\". An internal investigation published by the IDF six months after the battle implicitly cast the responsibility for the death of the thirteen soldiers on the soldiers themselves, for straying from their path unreported. It also said that the focusing on the rescue instead of subduing the enemy complicated things. Buchris was given the Chief of Staff citation. PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, who left the compound in Ramallah for the first time in five months on May 14, 2002 to visit Jenin and other West Bank cities affected in Operation Defensive Shield, praised the refugees' endurance and compared the fighting to the Battle of Stalingrad. Addressing a gathering of about 200 people in Jenin, he said: \\"People of Jenin, all the citizens of Jenin and the refugee camp, this is Jenin-grad. Your battle has paved the way to the liberation of the occupied territories\\". The battle became known among the Palestinians as \\"Jeningrad\\". The battle attracted the interest of the US military, which was trying to build a doctrine for urban warfare as the 2003 invasion of Iraq loomed. US military observers were sent to study the fighting. US officers dressed in IDF uniforms were reportedly present during the final stages of the battle. The United States Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory studied the battle, and a Joint Chiefs of Staff delegation was sent to Israel to make changes to US Marine Corps doctrine based on the battle.Surveillance and Control in Israel/Palestine: Population, Territory and Power, p. 134 =Damages= The BBC reported that ten percent of the camp was \\"virtually rubbed out by a dozen armoured Israeli bulldozers.\\" David Holley, a Major in the British Territorial Army and a military adviser to Amnesty International, reported that an area within the refugee camp of about 100 m by 200 m was flattened. According to Stephen Graham, the IDF had systematically bulldozed an area measuring 160 by 250 m in the Jenin refugee camp.Graham, 2004, p. 207. The Hawashin neighbourhood was levelled. Many residents had no advance warning, and some were buried alive.MacDonald, 2007, p. 82. Human Rights Watch (HRW) and Amnesty International (AI) reported that an estimated 4,000 people, more than a quarter of the population of the camp, were rendered homeless because of this destruction. HRW listed 140 buildings, most of which housed multiple families, as completely destroyed, and 200 other buildings as sustaining damage rendering them uninhabitable or unsafe for use. AI said complete destruction affected 164 houses with 374 apartment units, and that other buildings had been partially destroyed. Israel said those numbers were exaggerations.Winslow, 2007, p. 221, footnote #4. On May 31, 2002 the Israeli newspaper Yediot Aharonot published an interview with Moshe Nissim, nicknamed \\"Kurdi Bear\\", a D-9 operator who took part in the battle. Nissim said he had driven his D-9 for seventy-five hours straight, drinking whiskey to avoid fatigue, and that apart from a two-hour training before the battle, he had no prior experience in driving a bulldozer. He said he had begged his officers to let him destroy more houses and added: \\"I didn't see, with my own eyes, people dying under the blade of the D-9 and I didn't see house[s] falling down on live people. But if there were any, I wouldn't care at all ‚Ä¶ \\"But the real thing started the day 13 of our soldiers were killed up that alley in the Jenin refugee camp. \\"If we had moved into the building where they were ambushed, we would have buried all those Palestinians alive. \\"I kept thinking of our soldiers. I didn't feel sorry for all those Palestinians who were left homeless. I just felt sorry for their children, who were not guilty. There was one wounded child, who was shot by Arabs. A Golani paramedic came down and changed his bandages, till he was evacuated. We took care of them, of the children. The soldiers gave them candy. But I had no mercy for the parents of these children. I remembered the picture on television, of the mother who said she will bear children so that they will explode in Tel Aviv. I asked the Palestinian women I saw there: 'Aren't you ashamed?'\\" Winslow (2008), pp. 69‚Äì70.Gush Shalom Moshe Nissim interview in Hebrew. English translation of the full interview: \\"I made them a stadium in the middle of the camp\\". By Tsadok Yeheskeli, Yediot Aharonot =Casualties= Reporting of casualty numbers during the invasion varied widely and fluctuated day to day. On April 10, the BBC reported that Israel estimated 150 Palestinians had died in Jenin, and Palestinians were saying the number was far higher. That same day, Saeb Erekat, on a phone interview to CNN from Jericho, estimated that there were a total of 500 Palestinians killed during Operation Defensive Shield, this figure also including fatalities outside of the Jenin camp, in other areas of the West Bank. On April 11, Ben Wedeman of CNN reported that Palestinians were reporting 500 dead, while international relief agencies were saying possibly as many as 200; he noted that his efforts to independently verify the claims had so far come to naught since people were being prevented from entering the camp by Israeli soldiers. On April 12, Brigadier-General Ron Kitri said on Israeli Army Radio that there are apparently hundreds of Palestinians killed in Jenin. He later retracted this statement. Secretary-General of the Palestinian Authority, Ahmed Abdel Rahman, said that thousands of Palestinians had been killed and buried in mass graves, or lay under houses destroyed in Jenin and Nablus. On April 13, Palestinian Information Minister, Yasser Abed Rabbo, accused Israel killing 900 Palestinians in the camp and burying them in mass graves. On April 14, Haaretz reported that the exact number of Palestinian dead was still unknown, but that the IDF placed the toll between 100 and 200. On April 18, Zalman Shoval, adviser to Sharon, said that only about 65 bodies had been recovered, five of them civilians. On April 30, Qadoura Mousa, director of the Fatah for the northern West Bank, said the number of dead was fifty-six. Based on figures provided by the Jenin hospital and the IDF, the UN report placed the death toll at 52 Palestinian deaths, half of whom were thought to be civilians. In 2004, Haaretz journalists Amos Harel and Avi Isacharoff wrote that 23 Israelis had died and 52 had been wounded; Palestinian casualties were 53 dead, hundreds wounded and about 200 captured.Harel and Isacharoff (2004), pp. 257‚Äì258 Human Rights Watch reported that at least 52 died of whom at least 22 were civilians and at least 27 were suspected militants . According to retired IDF General Shlomo Gazit, the death toll was 55 Palestinians.Herzog & Gazit (2005), p. 433 Israeli officials estimated that of the 52 dead, 38 had been armed men, while 14 were civilians.Bernan Press, 2004, p. 435. Human Rights Watch reported that at least 52 were killed, at least 27 suspected militants and at least 22 civilians were killed during the IDF incursion, and said that \\"Many of them were killed willfully or unlawfully, and in some cases constituted war crimes.\\" Examples highlighted in the report include the case of 57-year-old Kamal Zugheir who was shot and then run over by IDF tanks while in his wheelchair, and that of 37-year-old Jamal Fayid, a quadraplegic crushed to death in the rubble of his home after an IDF bulldozer advanced upon it, refusing to allow his family to intervene to remove him. It also documented the killing of a Palestinian militant who had already been wounded. HRW also noted that there were three additional Palestinian deaths, and that it was unknown as to whether they were militants or civilians.Human Rights Watch, 2004, p. p. 460. IDF and Israeli government sources, as well as the Jewish Virtual Library, reported that 23 Israeli soldiers were killed and 75 wounded. The UN report also noted that 23 IDF soldiers had been killed. The only exception was retired IDF General Shlomo Gazit, who initially said that 33 soldiers had died in Jenin. This contradicted not only most IDF and other sources, but also IDF figures of 30 Israeli deaths total in Operation Defensive Shield. =Massacre allegations= The battle attracted widespread international attention due to allegations by Palestinians that a massacre had been committed. Reporters from various international media outlets quoted local residents who described houses being bulldozed with families still inside, helicopters firing indiscriminately into civilian areas, ambulances being prevented from reaching the wounded, summary executions of Palestinians,: A camp resident who worked at the Jenin hospital said: \\"I saw the Israelis line up five young men with their legs spread and their hands up as they faced a wall. The soldiers then sprayed them from head to toe with gunfire.\\" and stories of bodies being driven away in trucks or left in the sewers and bulldozed. Saeb Erekat, a Palestinian cabinet minister, accused the Israelis of trying to cover up the killing of civilians. The CNN correspondent noted that due to the IDF closure of the camp, there was \\"no way of confirming\\" the stories. During and immediately after the battle, the United Nations and several human rights NGOs also expressed concern about the possibility of a massacre. A British forensic expert who was part of an Amnesty International team granted access to Jenin on April 18 said, \\"the evidence before us at the moment doesn't lead us to believe that the allegations are anything other than truthful and that therefore there are large numbers of civilian dead underneath these bulldozed and bombed ruins that we see.\\" Israel denied charges of a massacre, and a lone April 9 report in the Israeli press stating Foreign Minister Shimon Peres privately referred to the battle as a \\"massacre\\" was immediately followed by a statement from Peres expressing concern that \\"Palestinian propaganda is liable to accuse Israel that a 'massacre' took place in Jenin rather than a pitched battle against heavily armed terrorists.\\" Subsequent investigations and reports by the United Nations, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Time magazine, and the BBC all concluded there was no massacre of civilians, with estimated death tolls of 46‚Äì55 people among reports by the IDF, the Jenin office of the United Nations, and the Jenin Hospital.Rees, Time magazine: \\"Charles Kapes, the deputy chief of the U.N. office in the camp, says 54 dead have been pulled from the wreckage and 49 Palestinians are missing, of whom 18 are residents of the camp,\\" \\"the Israelis say they found 46 dead in the rubble, including a pile of five bodies that had been booby-trapped,\\" \\"The Jenin Hospital, meanwhile, says 52 camp residents died, including five women and four children under the age of 15. Of the 43 dead men, eight were 55 or older and therefore probably not involved in the fighting.\\" A team of four Palestinian-appointed investigators reporting to Fatah numbered total casualties of 56, as disclosed by Kadoura Mousa Kadoura, the director of Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement for the northern West Bank. The UN report to the Secretary General noted \\"Palestinians had claimed that between 400 and 500 people had been killed, fighters and civilians together. They had also claimed a number of summary executions and the transfer of corpses to an unknown place outside the city of Jenin. The number of Palestinian fatalities, on the basis of bodies recovered to date, in Jenin and the refugee camp in this military operation can be estimated at around 55.\\"Report of the Secretary-General prepared pursuant to General Assembly resolution ES-10/10. Annex IV : Report of the European Union. While noting the number of civilian deaths might rise as rubble was cleared, the report continued, \\"nevertheless, the most recent estimates by UNRWA and ICRC show that the number of missing people is constantly declining as the IDF releases Palestinians from detention.\\" Human Rights Watch completed its report on Jenin in early May, stating \\"there was no massacre,\\" but accusing the IDF of war crimes, and Amnesty International's report concluded \\"No matter whose figures one accepts, \\"there was no massacre.\\" Amnesty's report specifically observed that \\"after the IDF temporarily withdrew from Jenin refugee camp on April 17, UNRWA set up teams to use the census lists to account for all the Palestinians (some 14,000) believed to be resident of the camp on April 3, 2002. Within five weeks all but one of the residents was accounted for.\\" A BBC report later noted, \\"Palestinian authorities made unsubstantiated claims of a wide-scale massacre,\\" and a reporter for The Observer opined that what happened in Jenin was not a massacre. =War crimes allegations= At the same time, Human rights organizations and some media reports charged Israel with war crimes.BBC: \\"Charges of war crimes committed by Israel were made.\\" In November, Amnesty International reported that there was \\"clear evidence\\" that the IDF committed war crimes against Palestinian civilians, including unlawful killings and torture, in Jenin and Nablus. The report also accused Israel of blocking medical care, using people as human shields and bulldozing houses with residents inside, as well as beating prisoners, which resulted in one death, and preventing ambulances and aid organizations from reaching the areas of combat even after the fighting had reportedly been stopped. Amnesty criticized the UN report, noting that its officials did not actually visit Jenin. The Observer reporter, Peter Beaumont, wrote that what happened in Jenin was not a massacre, but that the mass destruction of houses was a war crime. Some reports noted that Israel's restriction of access to Jenin and refusal to allow the UN investigation access to the area were evidence of a coverup, a charge echoed by Mouin Rabbani, Director of the Palestinian American Research Center in Ramallah. On the other side, Israeli media sources and analysts suggested media bias and propaganda efforts were the source of the allegations. Haaretz editor Hanoch Marmari stated, \\"some correspondents might have been obsessive in their determination to unearth a massacre in a refugee camp\\". Mohammed Dajani of Al-Quds University said that the Palestinian Authority wanted \\"to turn Jenin into an 'Alamo episode'. Here the press was a willing partner [as] they aspired to make Jenin a symbol of resistance to Palestinians\\".Gutmann (2005), p. 171 In May 2009, the IDF released a videotape showing what it called \\"a phony funeral that the Palestinians organized in order to multiply the number of casualties in Jenin,\\" wherein a live person is wrapped in a green sheet and marched in a procession. LAW, the Palestinian Society for the Protection of Human Rights, held a press conference on May 8, disputing the conclusions drawn by Israel. LAW stated that Mohammad Bakri who was in Jenin on April 28, making his documentary film Jenin, Jenin, shot the same footage from the ground, and that it shows a group of children playing \\"funeral\\" near the cemetery. LAW added that, \\"The media uncritically took up the Israeli spokesmen conclusions, without investigating what the footage actually shows.\\" Harel and Issacharoff wrote that the IDF's misconduct with the media, including Kitri's statement, contributed to the allegations of massacre. Mofaz later admitted that the limitations imposed on the media were a mistake. Head of the Operations Directorate, General Dan Harel, said: \\"Today, I would send a reporter in every APC\\".Harel and Isacharoff (2004), p. 259 IDF Spokeswoman, Miri Eisen, said the decision not to allow reporters into the camp was a difficult one: \\"The press people said 'Listen, the journalists aren't going to like it' and the operational people said 'We don't care about the journalists right now and about our image, we don't want them inside.' It had to do with the way we were working operationally inside the camp. We had infantry coming in from 360 degrees which means that you're firing in all different directions. It's not like a journalist can be [safe] on one side or another. It's a very difficult type of combat to coordinate with the forces, let alone with somebody you don't know who's inside.\\"Gutmann (2005), p. 167 Lorenzo Cremonesi, the correspondent for the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera in Jerusalem, writes in a 2009 article, that he slipped past the army barricades and entered the Jenin camp on April 13, 2002. He says the hospital was almost deserted as doctors played cards in the emergency room and that he spoke to 25 lightly wounded patients who told heartrending stories but when asked for names of the dead and urged to show where the bodies were, became evasive. \\"In short, it was all talk and nothing could be verified,\\" wrote Cremonesi. \\"At the end of that day, I wrote that the death toll was not more than 50 and most of them were combatants\\". Cremonesi criticized Israel's exclusion of the media from Jenin and from Gaza during the 2009 war, saying, \\"If you hide something from me, that means first and foremost that you want to hide it, and secondly, that you have done something wrong.\\" = UN fact- finding mission = On April 18, as Israeli troops began pulling out of Jenin and Nablus, UN envoy Terje Roed-Larsen entered the camp. He told reporters that the devastation was, \\"horrific beyond belief,\\" and relayed his view that it was \\"morally repugnant\\" that Israel had not allowed emergency workers into the camp after the battle with Palestinian gunmen had ended. On April 19, the United Nations Security Council unanimously passed Resolution 1405 to send a fact-finding mission to Jenin. Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres told Kofi Annan, the UN Secretary-General, that Israel would welcome a UN official \\"to clarify the facts\\", saying \\"Israel has nothing to hide regarding the operation in Jenin. Our hands are clean\\". Abed Rabbo said the mission was, \\"the first step toward making Sharon stand trial before an international tribunal\\". The composition of the fact-finding team was announced on April 22. Led by former Finnish President, Martti Ahtisaari, the other two members were Cornelio Sommaruga, former president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (controversial in Israel for previous \\"Red Swastika\\" remarks),\\"Kofi's Choice: The U.N. secretary general gets entangled in l'Affaire Sommaruga\\" Jewish World Review May 10, 2002 and Sadako Ogata, the former UN high commissioner for refugees who was Japan's special envoy on Afghan reconstruction. Official Israeli sources expressed surprise that they were not consulted as to the composition of the team, adding that, \\"We expected that the operational aspects of the fact-finding mission would be carried out by military experts.\\" On April 22, Israeli Defense Minister, Benjamin Ben-Eliezer expressed his disappointment at the team's make-up, and his hope that the mission would not overstep its mandate. Peres asked Annan to deny reports that the mission would look into events outside the refugee camp, and that the findings would have legal validity. Annan said the findings would not be legally binding, and that the mission would only investigate events inside the camp, but may have to interview residents currently displaced outside. On April 23, Gideon Saar, the cabinet secretary, threatened to ban the team from entering Jenin. In private discussions, Giora Eiland, Major General and Head of the IDF Operation Branch, convinced Shaul Mofaz that the team would ask to investigate officers and soldiers, and that it might accuse Israel of war crimes, paving the way for the sending of an international force. Sharon accepted Eiland and Mofaz's position, and announced Israel's decision that the UN team was no longer acceptable on April 24, citing the lack of military experts.Harel and Isacharoff (2004), p. 260 The US rebuked Sharon's decision, and a White House official said, \\"We were the sponsors of that and we want it implemented as written. We support the initiative of the secretary general.\\" Annan initially refused to delay the mission. Expressing Israeli sentiment that the world ignored its victims, Ben-Eliezer said: \\"In the last month alone, 137 people were slaughtered by Palestinians and nearly 700 wounded. Is there any one who is investigating that?\\" Saeb Erekat accused Israel of \\"trying to sabotage the mission. I believe that they have a big thing to hide.\\" On April 25, the UN agreed to postpone the arrival of the team by two days, and acceded to an Israeli request that two military officers be added to the team. Annan said talks with Israel had been, \\"very, very constructive and I'm sure we'll be able to sort out our differences\\". Peres said that a delay would give the Israeli cabinet the opportunity to discuss the mission before the team arrived. Avi Pazner, an Israeli Government spokesman, said he expected the UN mission to investigate \\"terrorist activity\\" and guarantee immunity for Israeli soldiers. Israel Radio reported that Israel was also pushing for the right for both sides to review the team's report before its presentation to Annan. Following a lengthy cabinet meeting on April 28, Reuven Rivlin, the Israeli Communications Minister, told reporters that the UN had reneged on its agreements with Israel over the team, and so it would not be allowed to arrive. Speaking for the cabinet, he said that the composition of the team and its terms of reference made it inevitable that its report would blame Israel. The UN Security Council convened the following day to discuss Israel's decision not to grant entry to the UN team. Meanwhile, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee lobby in Washington was called to pressure Annan and George W. Bush. On April 30, Annan urged that the UN team, which had been waiting in Geneva to start its mission, be disbanded, and it was on May 2. On May 4, Israel was isolated in an open debate in the Security Council. The deputy US ambassador to the UN, James Cunningham, said it was \\"regrettable\\" Israel had decided not to cooperate with the fact-finding team. Nasser Al- Kidwa, the Palestinian observer to the UN, said the council failed to give Annan its full support, and had caved to \\"blackmailing\\" by the Israeli Government. The General Assembly passed a resolution condemning Israel's military action in Jenin by 74 votes to four, with 54 abstentions. The Bush administration supported Israel as part of a deal in which Sharon agreed to lift the siege of the Mukataa in Ramallah. Report On July 31, the UN issued a report indicating that at that time 52 Palestinians had been killed and that it was possible that as many as half of them were civilians.PDF \\\\- Fifty-two Palestinian deaths had been confirmed by the hospital in Jenin by the end of May 2002. \\\\- By the time of the IDF withdrawal and the lifting of the curfew on April 18, at least 52 Palestinians, of whom up to half may have been civilians, and 23 Israeli soldiers were dead. =Reconstruction= In the aftermath of the invasion, many camp residents ended up living in temporary shelters elsewhere.Sa'di and Abu-Lughod, 2007, p. 127. The camp itself became the site of intense efforts at documenting, recording and expressing the experiences of those displaced and affected by the incursion. In discussing how to properly honor those who had fallen, one proposal suggested leaving the destruction, at least in the Hawashin neighborhood, exactly as it was, as a memorial and testament to struggle and sacrifice. Camp residents, however, insisted that the camp be rebuilt almost exactly as it had been, while also establishing a museum of memory in the Old Hijaz Railway building. They rejected the proposal of the Israeli housing minister to rebuild the camp at a nearby site with enlarged roads, viewing it as an attempt to erase the political reality of the camps whose existence they see as living testaments to the 1948 Palestinian exodus.Sa'di and Abu-Lughod, 2007, pp. 128‚Äì129.

They benefited from Napoleon I's policy of openness toward Jews, and in the 19th century experienced a remarkable ascent, with family members becoming prominent bankers, industrialists, physicians, public officials and artists. Dr Dov Weisbrot says \\"In the twentieth century, the name Javal was equal in prestige with those of Pereire, Fould, and Rothschild.\\" The Javal were a family of important captains of industry, businessmen and bankers, well rooted for many generation [in 1889] in Paris and Europe (...) The Javal [...] managed for well over a century that jump in the industrial revolution. Amongst the minority of businessmen and industrials that evolved at the top of French society and integrated with its elite, were the Javal. This family produced all across the 19th century bankers, captains of industry, professors of medicine, high civil servants, members of parliament and artists.Jacques Mousseau, Le Si√®cle de Paul-Louis Weiller. 1893‚Äì1993, Paris, Stock, 1998, p.49 The Javal, writes Pierre Birnbaum have known an exceptional financial success. Since the late 18th century, they participated to numerous economic adventures, from railways to textiles and weaved very close links with the business world [...] At the heart of an international industrial network, they start in the early 19th century financial operations on a vast scale, gathering a considerable fortune that places them in the first rank of the social elite.Pierre Birnbaum, Les Fous de la R√©publique, Paris, Le Seuil, coll. Points, 1994, pp.289‚Äì290  Early history  The family fortune began in the early part of the 18th century but really took off with the industrial revolution. Starting with the two Javal brothers (both named Jacques, and called respectively Jacques Javal the Elder and Jacque Javal the Younger) that operated a spinning mill in Mulhouse. In 1826, Jacques Javal the Young entered the Board of Manufacturers and in 1828 he was made a Knight of the Legion of Honor, under its industrial activity on the proposal of Count Chabrol de Volvic, prefect of the Seine. He built a mansion at the bottom of rue Taitbout while his son and partner, Joseph, settled rue Chauchat. When Jacques the Younger retired in 1835, he was one of France's richest men.  Leopold Javal  Jacques the Younger sponsored Leopold, then 31 years old, to invest in new businesses. Leopold invested in mines in Provence, in pipeline companies, a department store, a public bathhouse on the Seine at the foot of the Samaritaine, a housing neighbourhood for workers in Montrouge. In ten years, he multiplied by three the capital of the family companies and created his own personal fortune. He took control of the banking side of the family empire and renamed it \\"Leopold Javal and C i.e. \\"and took the lead. Through this bank, it invests in the development of railway lines, in combination with the house Koechlin. He also took up a political career as general counsel of the Gironde from 1851, with the support of the imperial regime, and as a representative of the department of the Yonne to the Legislature from 1857, where he appeared first as a Republican against the Bonapartist candidate, and was consistently re-elected in 1863, 1869 and 1871. In 1862, he was made an Officier de la Legion d'honneur. He lived at the end of his life, an hotel particulier of rue d'Anjou, and started the very important Javal art collection with paintings of Fran√ßois Boucher, Claude Joseph Vernet, Canaletto, Andrea del Sarto, Bruegel and Rubens. In 1838, Javal married Augusta de Laemel, daughter of the financier L√©opold von Laemel and the baroness Sophia von Eichthal, sister of the baron Simon von Eichthal, a member of one of the , the two hundred families that were the biggest shareholders in the Bank of France, a family which gave several governors to the Bank of France. Being heavily influenced by Saint-Simonism, Javal began by planting pine forests and drilling wells and was also passionate about agriculture: he was innovative and took great care in the management of his landed properties. The Javal family owned some 300 hectares around the cistercian abbey of Vauluisant, while in Andernos Javal enlarged an estate at Audenge to Ares and to Lacanau, thus forming a big property of over 3,000 hectares.  Houbigant  The Javal owned the perfume house Houbigant, the second oldest perfume house in Europe. Operating since 1775, the House of Houbigant is the only fragrance house that has existed through four centuries of history. Through these centuries, the perfumers of the House of Houbigant have made groundbreaking discoveries in the formulation of perfumes that have revolutionized forever the way perfumes are constructed. Over the centuries, the House of Houbigant became perfumer to the royal courts of Europe. When in 1793 Marie-Antoinette was guillotined, she carried three vials of Houbigant perfume in her corsage to give her strength. Josephine, the future Empress of France, belonged to a group of stylish young men and women called \\"The Muscadins\\" because of their craze for musk which was Josephine's favourite essence. Houbigant fragrances travelled in Napoleon's campaign chest during the years when he was conquering Europe. In the spring of 1815 Napoleon was only in Paris for three months, a period known as the \\"Hundred Days\\". In those brief months he raised an army and yet found time to shop at Houbigant. In 1829, Houbigant was appointed perfumer to Her Royal Highness, the Princess Adelaide d'Orleans, mother of King Louis-Philippe. In 1838, the French house was awarded the license of \\"Perfumer to Her Majesty, Queen Victoria of England\\". Czar Alexander III named Houbigant perfumer to the Imperial Court of Russia in 1890. Houbigant created a perfume, \\"The Czarina's Bouquet\\", in honor of the Empress, Maria Fyodorovna. When her son ascended the throne as Czar Nicolas II in 1894, Houbigant continued as royal perfumer. Hand-written ledgers record the purchases of the Dowager Empress from 1900 until the eve of the Russian Revolution in 1917. Her sister, Queen Alexandra, wife of King Edward VII, began her purchases in 1902. The account books reveal that the two queens did their Christmas shopping together at Houbigant. Other royalty luminaries include La Comtesse de Saxe, first cousin of Louis XVI the King and Queen of Holland; the Queen of Italy; Princess Mathilde, sister of Napoleon, Prince of Battenberg; Le Duc de Mouchy; Tolstoy; the Russian Ambassador; Guy de Maupassant; the Rothschilds and more. In 1882, the famous Foug√®re Royale came out, a fragrance that would define a new category of perfumes ‚Äì the \\"foug√®re\\" (or fern-like) fragrance family, which is still today the most popular family in men fragrances. In 1912, Houbigant perfumer Bienaim√© picked up the ball from Paul Parquet and introduced Quelque Fleurs, one of Houbigant's all-time great fragrances and the first multi-floral bouquet ever created. During the same period, Houbigant stretched out its commercial arms around the world. Under the direction of the Paris office, offices were established in the United States, England, Belgium, Holland, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, Poland, Romania. Connections were made in Havana, Buenos-Aires, Rio-de-Janeiro, Australia, Japan, and China.  The Weiller  With the Weiller branch (Paul-Louis Weiller, son of industrialist and politician Lazare Weiller (1858‚Äì1928) and Alice Javal, the first woman to ever pilot an airplane), they conducted an intense social life between the royal families of Europe, the great men of and political affairs ( Aristotle Onassis, Henry Ford, Jean Paul Getty, Richard Nixon, Georges Pompidou ... with whom Paul- Louis Weiller sometimes worked or whom sometimes worked for him), the personalities of the arts and letters show that it brings in the last of the Parisian salons in the tradition of those described by Marcel Proust. Paul- Louis Weiller also funded many charities. Captain of industry at the age of twenty-nine years, from 1922 to 1940, Paul-Louis Weiller developed the largest construction company of aircraft in Europe, the Gnome et Rh√¥ne conglomerate, which became the Snecma after nationalization in 1945 . From 1925, he gradually buys the capital of the airline CIDNA. He participated in the creation of other airlines to Africa. They will all be nationalized in 1933 to become Air France, of which he will be one of the first directors (he was offered in 1933 by Pierre Cot, the Ministre de l'Air, to be President of Air France, but he refused). Paul-Louis Weiller was married 29 August 1922 in Paris, with Princess Alexandra Ghica (of the ruling princes of Wallachia and Moldavia) with whom he had a daughter, Mary Elizabeth and whom he divorced in 1931.

She became an author, journalist, feminist and European politician. She was awarded a degree from Oxford University. From 1914 to 1918, she worked as a war nurse and founded a hospital in the C√¥tes-du-Nord. From 1918 to 1934, she was the publisher of the magazine, '. From 1935 to the beginning of World War II, she committed herself to women's suffrage. In 1936, she stood for French parliamentary elections, running in the Fifth arrondissement of Paris. During the War, she was active in the French Resistance. She was a member of the Patriam Recuperare network, and she was chief editor of the secret magazine, \\"Nouvelle R√©publique\\" from 1942 until 1944. In 1945, she founded the Institute for Polemology (research on war and conflict) together with in London. She travelled around the Middle East, Japan, China, Vietnam, Africa, Kenya, Madagascar, Alaska, India, etc., made documentary films and wrote accounts of her travels. In 1975, she unsuccessfully tried twice to be admitted to the Acad√©mie Fran√ßaise. In 1979, she became a Member of the European Parliament for the Gaullist Party (now Union for a Popular Movement). The European Woman: During World War I, she published her first press reports under a pseudonym. In Paris, she came in contact with her first great loves, representatives of countries striving for independence, such as Eduard Bene≈°, Tom√°≈° Masaryk and Milan ≈†tef√°nik. Between 1919 and 1939, she often travelled to Czechoslovakia. In 1918, she founded the weekly newspaper, ' (New Europe), which she published until 1934. Thomas Mann, Gustav Stresemann, Rudolf Breitscheid and Aristide Briand were among her co-authors on the paper. Louise Weiss described those who paved the way for the closening of the German-French relationship between the World Wars as \\"peace pilgrims\\", and they called their important co-worker \\"my good Louise\\". Europe dreamed of unification and in 1930, she founded the \\"Ecole de la Paix\\" (School of Peace), a private institute for international relations. With the takeover by the National Socialists in Germany, the possibility of a unification was over. In 1979, Louise Weiss stood as a candidate of the Gaullist Party in the first European election in 1979. On 17 July 1979 she was elected as a French Member of the European Parliament (MEP), sitting with the European People's Party. At the time of the first election, aged 86, she was the oldest member in Parliament and thus the EP's first 'oldest member'. She remained MEP and oldest member until her death on 26 May 1983, aged 90. The main parliament building in Strasbourg bears her name. The Women's Rights Activist: In 1934, she founded the association, La femme nouvelle (The New Woman) with C√©cile Brunsvicg, and she strove for a stronger role of women in public life. She participated in campaigns for the right of women to vote in France, organised suffragette commands, demonstrated and had herself chained to a street light in Paris with other women. In 1935, she unsuccessfully sued against the \\"inability of women to vote\\" before the French Conseil d'√âtat.  Andr√© Maurois  Andr√© Maurois was a famous French writer who in 1938 was elected to the prestigious Acad√©mie fran√ßaise. He was encouraged and assisted in seeking this post by Marshal Philippe P√©tain, and he made a point of acknowledging with thanks his debt to P√©tain in his 1941 autobiography, \\"Call no man happy\\" ‚Äì though by the time of writing their paths had sharply diverged, P√©tain having become Head of State of Vichy France. A student of the philosopher Alain, during World War I he joined the French army and served as an interpreter and later a liaison officer with the British army. His first novel, Les silences du colonel Bramble, was a witty and socially realistic account of that experience. It was an immediate success in France. It was translated and became popular in the United Kingdom and other English-speaking countries as The Silence of Colonel Bramble. Many of his other works have also been translated into English,His principal translator into English was Hamish Miles (1894‚Äì1937). as they often dealt with British people or topics, such as his biographies of Disraeli, Byron, and Shelley. When World War II began, he was appointed the French Official Observer attached to the British General Headquarters. In this capacity he accompanied the British Army to Belgium. He knew personally the main politicians in the French Government, and on 10 June 1940 he was sent on a mission to London. The Armistice ended that mission. Maurois was demobilised and travelled from England to Canada. He wrote of these experiences in his book, Tragedy in France.Maurois, 1940, Foreword Maurois's first wife was Jeanne-Marie Wanda de Szymkiewicz, a young Polish-Russian aristocrat who had studied at Oxford University. She had a nervous breakdown in 1918 and in 1924 she died of sepsis. After the death of his father, Maurois gave up the family business of textile manufacturing. Maurois's second wife was Simone de Caillavet, the granddaughter of Anatole France's mistress L√©ontine Arman de Caillavet. After Germany occupied France the couple moved to the United States to help with propaganda work against the Nazis. Later in World War II he served in the French army and the Free French Forces. He died in 1967 in Neuilly-sur-Seine after a long career as an author of novels, biographies, histories, children's books and science fiction stories. He is buried in Neuilly-sur-Seine community cemetery near Paris.

He authored novels, stories and dramas that are inspired by the extraordinary events of his life. Life Mandl was born in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia, the son of Czech Jewish parents, the engineer Daniel Mandl and Hajnalka Mandl. He was educated in Jewish and Czech schools in Bratislava and in Brno. He began to play the violin at the age of 6. Registration form of Herbert Thomas Mandl as a prisoner at Dachau Nazi Concentration Camp The Mandls were living in Brno when the remains of Czechoslovakia were annexed by Nazi Germany on March 15, 1939. Mandl was 13 at the time. In 1942, Mandl and his parents were deported to the Terez√≠n (Theresienstadt) ghetto. In 1944, Mandl and his father were transported to the Auschwitz concentration camp, thence to several Dachau-Kaufering satellite camps, where Mandl's father died. At the end of World War II, Mandl was repatriated to Czechoslovakia where he was reunited with his mother. Slavi and Tommy Mandl in 1978 Once free, Mandl returned to his studies. He was ultimately awarded a doctorate in the performing arts (violin) from the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague in Prague, where he met his future wife, Jaroslava (‚ÄúSlavi‚Äù), a concert pianist. While professors of music at the Jan√°ƒçek Conservatory in Ostrava, the Mandls developed several plans for escaping to the West from the oppressive conditions in Communist Czechoslovakia. Mandl himself finally succeeded in Cairo, where he broke away from his tourist group and applied for asylum at the United States Embassy in Cairo. Initially, he was suspected of being a spy, and the CIA interrogated him for months. When released, he was placed in a refugee camp in Zirndorf, West Germany. (‚ÄúThere were as many spies as real refugees there,‚Äù he had said of Zirndorf.) Once granted the status of political refugee, Mandl moved to Cologne, where he became the private secretary of Heinrich B√∂ll, the recipient of the 1972 Nobel Prize for Literature. Since Mandl‚Äôs wife Slavi had remained behind in Ostrava (this was by the Mandls' prior agreement), B√∂ll had agreed to help smuggle her to the West. He engaged a professional illusionist to build a hideaway in his personal automobile, a Citroen DS-19, drove to Czechoslovakia with his entire family and smuggled Slavi out. This incident is documented in Mandl's autobiography, Durst, Musik, Geheime Dienste published in Germany in 1995 and in a Bavarian television film directed by Gloria de Siano. In later years, Mandl produced and edited cultural broadcasts that were transmitted to Communist Eastern Europe by the West German radio station Deutsche Welle in Cologne. He and Slavi twice emigrated to the USA, where he studied psychology at the University of Washington in Seattle, Washington and was supervisor on the ward for the criminally insane at Western State Hospital in Tacoma, Washington. In 1971, the Mandls permanently returned to West Germany, settling in Meerbusch-B√ºderich. Mandl found a position as a professor of English at the Roman Catholic evening gymnasium () in Essen, where he remained until his retirement. In addition to his other talents, Mandl was an inventor. He developed and patented two very different devices. One was a transparent model of a human head (the phonetic head) that contained movable speech organs and was used to help teach pronunciation of foreign languages. The second was the Suggestometer, a complex device that could be used to measure human suggestibility empirically ‚Äì something that was considered impossible by research psychologists at the time. Mandl was also a very successful psychotherapist who continued to provide mental health treatment even after his retirement. During the last decades of his life, Mandl was a very active as a contemporary witness to the musical scene in the Terezin (Theresienstadt) ghetto; he had played the violin in the camp orchestra in 1943/44 under the batons of Karel Anƒçerl and Carlo Sigmund Taube. Mandl was a tireless contemporary witness to the horrors of life under totalitarian regimes and particularly to the Holocaust, traveling throughout Europe and North America to deliver his message. As one of the few survivors of the Terez√≠n ghetto musical scene, he provided expert eyewitness accounts for this extraordinary phenomenon.  Literary Themes  The central theme of Mandl‚Äôs literary work is the battle of the individual against the sophisticated instruments of totalitarian oppression: secret services, isolation, psychological torture, brainwashing, incarceration, starvation, the debilitating effects of the \\"daily grind\\" in the most difficult of circumstances. As in works by Edgar Allan Poe, Aldous Huxley, Franz Kafka and George Orwell, Mandl's protagonists, armed only with their reason, stand alone against all the sophisticated torture arts of their seemingly omnipotent opponents. In his works, Mandl underscores the drama of this unequal combat by interspersing the narrative with philosophical reflections written in clear and meaningful language. His novel, The Philosopher‚Äôs Wager (published in Germany in 1996 as Die Wette des Philosophen, is remarkable for its vivid portrayal of not just the most mundane aspects of life in the Terez√≠n (Theresienstadt) ghetto but also of the extensive, if illegal, cultural and musical life of the ghetto.

It is a major nonprofit group with an extensive collection of operations. Winnie Byanyima was the executive director of Oxfam International from 2013 to 2019. History Plaque commemorating first meeting of Oxfam in the Old Library, the University Church, Oxford Founded at 17 Broad Street, Oxford, as the Oxford Committee for Famine Relief by a group of Quakers, social activists, and Oxford academics in 1942 and registered in accordance with UK law in 1943, the original Oxford Committee for Famine Relief was a group of concerned citizens including Henry Gillett (a prominent local Quaker), Theodore Richard Milford, Gilbert Murray and his wife Mary, Cecil Jackson-Cole and Alan Pim. The Committee met in the Old Library of University Church of St Mary the Virgin, Oxford, for the first time in 1942, and its aim was to help starving citizens of occupied Greece, a famine caused by the Axis occupation of Greece and Allied naval blockades and to persuade the British government to allow food relief through the blockade. The Oxford committee was one of several local committees formed in support of the National Famine Relief Committee.Black, (1992) Oxfam's first paid employee was Joe Mitty, who began working at the Oxfam shop on Broad Street, Oxford on 9 November 1949. Engaged to manage the accounts and distribute donated clothing, he originated the policy of selling anything which people were willing to donate, and developed the shop into a national chain. By 1960, it was a major international non-governmental aid organization. The first overseas committee was founded in Canada in 1963, and in 1965 the organization changed its name to its telegraphic address, OXFAM. The Oxford committee became known as Oxfam Great Britain or Oxfam GB. In 1995 Oxfam International was formed by a group of independent non-governmental organizations. Their aim was to work together for a greater impact on the international stage to reduce poverty and injustice. Stichting Oxfam International was registered as a non-profit foundation at The Hague, Netherlands in 1996. Oxfam's work =Mission and values= In November 2000, Oxfam adopted the rights-based approach as the framework for all the work of the Confederation and its partners. Oxfam recognizes the universality and indivisibility of human rights and has adopted these overarching aims to express these rights in practical terms: * the right to a sustainable livelihood * the right to basic social services * the right to life and security * the right to be heard * the right to an identity Oxfam believes that poverty and powerlessness are avoidable and can be eradicated by human action and political will. It believes in the right to a sustainable livelihood, and the right and capacity to participate in societies and make positive changes to people's lives as basic human needs and rights which can be met. Oxfam believes that peace and substantial arms reduction are essential conditions for development and that inequalities can be significantly reduced between both rich and poor nations and within nations. Oxfam has restructured their donation process and supporter-facing digital in response to a fall in fundraising. = Focus = Oxfam clothing and shoe bank in the United Kingdom Oxfam relief supplies outside the Siginon warehouse in Nairobi, Kenya. Oxfam works on trade justice, fair trade, education, debt and aid, livelihoods, health, HIV/AIDS, gender equality, conflict (campaigning for an international arms trade treaty) and natural disasters, democracy and human rights, and climate change. Through programmes like \\"Saving for Change\\", Oxfam helps communities become more self-sufficient financially. The Saving for Change initiative is a programme whereby communities are taught how to form collective, informal credit groups. Through these mutually beneficial groups, members‚Äîwho tend to be mostly women‚Äîpool their savings into a fund which is used to give loans for activities such as paying for medical care and paying school fees, in addition to using the loans to fund small-scale business ventures. Ultimately, the goal of the programme is to leave the community with a self-sustaining organization where people who otherwise would not qualify for formal bank loans can go for financial assistance. In doing so, borrowers can start businesses which benefit not only themselves but also their communities. Oxfam has provided relief services during various global crises, including the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict, North Korean famine, 2011 East Africa drought, 2012 Sahel drought, Nepal earthquake and Yemeni crisis. The Bosfam NGO was also founded in May 1995 by women participating in an Oxfam GB psycho-social 'radionice' project to support internally displaced women during the Bosnian war. Oxfam has become a globally recognized leader in providing water sanitation to impoverished and war-torn areas the world over. In 2012, Oxfam became one of the humanitarian groups that comprise the UK's Rapid Response Facility to ensure clean water in the wake of humanitarian disasters. A January 2014 Oxfam report stated that the 85 wealthiest individuals in the world have a combined wealth equal to that of the bottom 50% of the world's population, or about 3.5 billion people. More recently, in January 2015, Oxfam reported that the wealthiest 1 percent will own more than half of the global wealth by 2016. A 2017-released Oxfam report has stated that 8 billionaires possess the same amount of wealth as the poorest half of humanity. =Campaigns= The Make Trade Fair campaign organized by Oxfam International focuses on the elimination of trade practices, like dumping, which occurs when highly subsidized, surplus commodities from developed countries such as rice, cotton, corn, and sugar are sold at low prices and farmers from poor countries have difficulty competing. Another practice Oxfams opposes is the setting of tariffs, where nations enforce high taxes on imported goods, restricting the sales of products from other nations, unbalanced labour rights for women, who often earn lower wages than their male counterparts, and stringent patent issues that prevent the prices of medication, software, and textbooks (e.g. Gene patents, Chemical patents, and Software patents) from being lowered. Thus, such essential goods are often inaccessible to developing nations. =Shops= Original Oxfam shop at 17 Broad Street, Oxford Oxfam has shops all over the world, which sell many fair-trade and donated items since their first charity shop opened in 1948, although trading began in 1947. The proceeds from these are used to further Oxfam's mission and relief efforts around the globe. Much of their stock comes from public donations but as of 2012 they still sold fair trade products from developing countries in Africa, Asia and South America, including handcrafts, books, music CDs and instruments, clothing, toys, food and ethnic creations. These objects are brought to the public through fair trade to help boost the quality of life of their producers and surrounding communities. As of 2010, Oxfam had over 1,200 shops worldwide. More than half of them were in the UK with around 750 Oxfam GB shops including specialist shops such as books, music, furniture and bridal wear. Oxfam Germany has 45 shops including specialist book shops; Oxfam France shops sell books and fair trade products and Oxfam Hong Kong has 2 shops selling donated goods and fair trade products. Oxfam Novib, Oxfam Australia (with over 20 fair trade shops), Oxfam Ireland and Oxfam in Belgium also raise funds from shops. Of the 750 Oxfam charity shops around the UK, around 100 are specialist bookshops or book and music shops. Oxfam is the largest retailer of second- hand books in Europe, selling around 12 million per year. In 2008, Oxfam GB worked with over 20,000 volunteers in shops across the UK, raising ¬£17.1 million for Oxfam's programme work. =Fundraising= Oxfam has several successful fundraising channels in addition to its shops. Over half a million people in the UK make a regular financial contribution to its work. In April 2017 the Information Commissioner's Office fined 11 charities that breached the Data Protection Act by misusing donors' personal data. Oxfam was fined ¬£6,000. Offices and affiliates =Oxfam International= Winnie Byanyima, executive director of Oxfam International The Oxfam International Secretariat (OIS) leads, facilitates, and supports collaboration between the Oxfam affiliates to increase Oxfam's impact on poverty and injustice through advocacy campaigns, development programmes and emergency response. The OIS Board comprises the Executive Director, Chair of each Affiliate, and the OI Chair. The Affiliates' Chairs are voting members and are non-remunerated. The Executive Directors and the OI Chair are all non-voting-members. The Board also elects the Deputy Chair and Treasurer from among its voting members. The Board is responsible for ensuring that Oxfam International is accountable, transparent, and fit for purpose. The constitution and Strategic Plan are also approved at the Board level. The Board takes recommendations from Executive Directors and ensures that the Confederation is working to its agreed aims. The Board also agrees membership of the Confederation, selects the Honorary President, the Honorary Advisor, the Board Officers and the OI Executive Director. A number of subcommittees with expert members are also mandated by the Board to assist with specific issues. Oxfam International's official languages are English, French and Spanish; English is the working language. In 2009‚Äì10 it had approximately 77 staff (including secondment placements and temporary staff e.g. for maternity cover). It is funded by contributions from affiliate organizations and has an operating budget of US$8.7M. =Oxfam America= Raymond C. Offenheiser, then Oxfam America President, with Rupert Murdoch at the 2006 Oxfam/MySpace Rock for Darfur event In 1970, Oxfam America became an independent nonprofit organization and an Oxfam affiliate in response to the humanitarian crisis created by the fight for independence in Bangladesh. Oxfam America's headquarters are located in Boston, Massachusetts with a policy and campaigns office in Washington, D.C. and seven regional offices around the world. A registered 501(c)3 organization, Oxfam America campaigns for climate change adaptation, food security, aid reform, access to medicines, and fair trade. Ray Offenheiser served as the president and CEO of Oxfam America from 1996 until 2016.Fallon, Joan (21 November 2016). \\"Ray Offenheiser to join Notre Dame faculty as Distinguished Professor of the Practice in the Keough School of Global Affairs\\".

Retrieved 21 September 2017. =Oxfam Australia= Oxfam Australia is an independent, not-for-profit, secular, community-based aid and development organization, and an affiliate of Oxfam International. Oxfam Australia's work includes long-term development projects, responding to emergencies and campaigning to improve the lives of disadvantaged people around the world. They aim to give disadvantaged people improved access to social services, an effective voice in decisions, equal rights and status, and safety from conflict and disaster. Oxfam Australia's activities are mainly funded by community donation.Blackburn, (1993) Countries with Oxfam members =Oxfam IBIS (Denmark)= IBIS was founded as an independent organization in 1991, but has its roots in the Danish department of World University Service and has been active since the 1966 (initially mainly against apartheid and similar situations in other southern African nations). Since the 1970s, it mainly worked with projects in Africa and Latin America, and usually focused on democracy, education and the causes of poverty. In 2014 IBIS became an observer member of Oxfam and in October 2016 it became a full member. Around the same time, the name was modified from IBIS to Oxfam IBIS. =Oxfam France= Oxfam France was founded in 1988 under the name \\"Agir ici pour un monde solidaire\\" (Act here for a unified world). Its work was already based on campaign and advocacy, both of which were rare in France at the time. Agir ici became an observer member of Oxfam in 2003, and a fully-fledged member in 2006. Based in Paris, Oxfam France claims its missions are to inform, increase public awareness & mobilize citizens. Oxfam France's work in advocacy and research focuses on Economic Justice (especially tax revenue in developing countries, ODA, tax heavens and innovative financing), Agriculture (speculation and food prizes, biofuels, land grabbing, trade rules), protecting civilians, and health. Oxfam France is funded mostly by public donations and by institutional donors. It has five second-hand shops: three bookshops (two in Paris, one in Lille), a clothes shop in Lille and a shop in Strasbourg. =Oxfam Germany= An Oxfam outlet in D√ºsseldorf, Germany. Oxfam Germany has its beginnings in an initiative by private citizens who in 1986 opened a secondhand shop in Bonn modelled on the idea of the British charity shops. While not officially associated with Oxfam, the shop was staffed by volunteers and sold donated goods, with all proceeds given to projects run by Oxfam GB. A second shop, following the same model, was opened in Cologne in 1991. Oxfam officially came to Germany in 1995 with the foundation of the charitable Oxfam Deutschland e. V. and its commercial subsidiary Oxfam Deutschland Shops GmbH. Oxfam Germany became a full affiliate of Oxfam International in 2003. As of February 2017, Oxfam was operating 52 charity shops in 34 German cities, including five Oxfam bookshops and three fashion boutiques. According to the Oxfam Germany website, there are 2,400 volunteers in those shops. =Oxfam GB (Great Britain)= Oxfam GB's headquarters are in Cowley, Oxford. The finance office is in Newcastle, from where Oxfam shops are managed. Oxfam GB had a total income of ¬£408.6m in 2016/17, had 5,000 employees, and used the services of 23,000 volunteers. In 2016 it received ¬£31.7m from the British government. Mark Goldring was the chief executive officer from 2013 until January 2019, when he was replaced by Dr Dhananjayan (Danny) Sriskandarajah. In 2017 Oxfam GB advocated an increased migration to the UK through family reunification in recommendations to the government, suggesting that legal aid should cover family-reunification issues. =Oxfam Hong Kong= Oxfam Hong Kong began in 1976, when volunteers came together, opened a second-hand shop, and raised funds for anti-poverty projects around the world. Some of the first actions in the 1970s and '80s were to advocate for justice in the Vietnamese Boat People/Refugee crisis in Hong Kong, and to help save lives in Ethiopia during the 1984 famine. To date, Oxfam Hong Kong has assisted poor people in more than 70 countries/states around the world. =Oxfam India= Oxfam's involvement in India began when money was granted in 1951 to fight famine in Bihar. Bihar at the time was one of the poorest and most populated states in India. Oxfam had launched an appeal that led to the first report of Oxfam's work in the House of Commons in UK. On 31 May 1951, Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations had commended the Bihar appeal, stating \\"the Oxford Committee for Famine Relief (then name of Oxfam) has made an appeal for donations and I hope individuals will reply to that generously\\". Among the many donations received was one for 100 British pounds from an Indian Rajah in appreciation of what Oxfam was doing for the hungry of his country.The Oxfam Story, page 11, Pergamon Press Ltd (1964) Library of Congress Card No. 64-17726 Bihar and famine would bring Oxfam back to India in 1965 to address drought due to bad monsoons. Bihar held a population of 53 million, of which 40 million relied on subsistence farming to live. This would compound for India in the future; production of food had not been parallel to its exploding population. It is estimated that, over the course of the droughts and famines, 2,400 tons of milk was bought by Oxfam and at the height of this was feeding over 400,000 starving children and mothers. In 1968 Oxfam's first field director in India, Jim Howard, created the Oxfam Gramdan Action Programme, or OGAP. This was the first joint rural development programme in Oxfam history and the first step to a new 'operational' Oxfam. Oxfam India was established on 1 September 2008 under section 25 of the Companies Act, 1956 as a non-profitable organization with its head office in Delhi and is now a member of Oxfam International Confederation. This was marked by Oxfam's 60th year in India. =Oxfam Ireland= Oxfam Ireland is a registered charity in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, with headquarters in Dublin and Belfast. Funds are raised via shops, the government and donors. There are 51 shops throughout Ireland selling goods donated by the public. The Irish government allocated over ‚Ç¨3.7m to Oxfam work in 2008‚Äì2009. Supporters donate regularly via direct debit or to special appeals. Oxfam Ireland is the public title of the two legal bodies registered in the respective jurisdictions as Oxfam Northern Ireland and Oxfam Republic of Ireland. Oxfam Ireland operates coherently on an all-island basis by means of a single management structure and shared membership of associations and councils. =Oxfam Novib (Netherlands)= Oxfam Novib at Lowlands 2007. Oxfam Novib is the Dutch affiliate of the international Oxfam organization. The organization is based in The Hague. Oxfam Novib was founded under the name Novib in 1956. Novib, an abbreviation standing for Nederlandse Organisatie Voor Internationale Bijstand (Dutch organization for international aid), was later changed to Nederlandse Organisatie voor Internationale Ontwikkelingssamenwerking (Dutch organization for international development cooperation) due to a change in the approach of the organization's development work. In 1994, Novib became an affiliate of Oxfam and the organization changed its name in 2006 to Oxfam Novib. =Oxfam New Zealand= Oxfam New Zealand is an aid and development organization and affiliate of Oxfam International who conduct humanitarian, development and advocacy work to support positive and lasting change for communities living in poverty. Oxfam NZ is also responsible for delivering Cyclone relief in several countries in the Pacific region. Oxfam New Zealand's work is made possible by supporters, interns, staff, volunteers, board and overseas partners. Most of the staff are based in their Auckland office. They also have a policy unit in Wellington. Most of Oxfam New Zealand's funds come from donations, supplemented by New Zealand government funds. Criticism =Political neutrality= In 2005, Oxfam Great Britain was criticised by other NGOs for becoming too close to Tony Blair's New Labour government in the UK. =Internal structures and political role= An Oxfam cholera awareness-raising campaign in Mbandaka, Democratic Republic of Congo. In October 2005, the magazine New Internationalist described Oxfam as a \\"Big International Non-Government Organisation (BINGO)\\", having a corporate-style, undemocratic internal structure, and addressing the symptoms rather than the causes of international poverty ‚Äì especially by acquiescing to neoliberal economics and even taking over roles conventionally filled by national governments. Similar criticism came from Red Pepper magazine in July 2005 and Katherine Quarmby in the New Statesman in May 2005. The latter article detailed growing rifts between Oxfam and other organisations within the Make Poverty History movement. In a 2011 Columbia Journalism Review article, journalist Karen Rothmyer accused NGOs in general and Oxfam in particular of being unduly influenced by the priorities of the media, of providing inaccurate information to the press (\\"stories featuring aid projects often rely on dubious numbers provided by the organisations\\") and of perpetuating negative stereotypes which \\"have the potential to influence policy\\". She drew on earlier work by journalist Lauren Gelfand, who had taken a year away from journalism to work for Oxfam: \\"A lot of what Oxfam does is to sustain Oxfam\\"; and Linda Polman, author of the Crisis Caravan: \\"Aid organisations are businesses dressed up like Mother Theresa\\". In 2015, Omaar and de Waal, in Food and Power in Sudan, commented, \\"the 1990s have seen growing pressure for humanitarian institutions to become more accountable. There has been a succession of reviews of major operations, growing in independence and criticism.\\" They quote an OECD report, \\"The Joint Evaluation of Emergency Operations in Rwanda\\", which stated that its team \\"came across examples of Agencies telling, if not falsehoods, then certainly half-truths\\" and noted \\"a remarkable lack of attempts by agencies to seek the views of beneficiaries on the assistance being provided\\". Oxfam and others launched the Sphere Project in response, an initiative which aims to \\"improve the quality of assistance provided to people affected by disasters\\", to \\"develop a set of minimum standards in core areas of humanitarian assistance\\" and to introduce an element of accountability which had previously been lacking. =Conflict with Starbucks on Ethiopian coffee, 2006= On 26 October 2006, Oxfam accused Starbucks of asking the National Coffee Association (NCA) to block a US trademark application from Ethiopia for three of the country's coffee beans, Sidamo, Harar and Yirgacheffe. They claimed this could result in denying Ethiopian coffee farmers potential annual earnings of up to ¬£47m. Ethiopia and Oxfam America urged Starbucks to sign a licensing agreement with Ethiopia to help boost prices paid to farmers. At issue was Starbucks' use of Ethiopia's coffee brands‚ÄîSidamo, Yirgacheffe and Harar‚Äîthat generate high margins for Starbucks and cost consumers a premium, yet generated very low prices to Ethiopian farmers. Robert Nelson, the head of the NCA, added that his organization initiated the opposition for economic reasons, \\"For the U.S. industry to exist, we must have an economically stable coffee industry in the producing world ... This particular scheme is going to hurt the Ethiopian coffee farmers economically.\\" The NCA claimed the Ethiopian government was being badly advised and this move could price them out of the market. Facing more than 90,000 letters of concern, Starbucks had placed pamphlets in its stores accusing Oxfam of \\"misleading behavior\\" and insisting that its \\"campaign need[s] to stop\\". On 7 November, The Economist derided Oxfam's \\"simplistic\\" stance and Ethiopia's \\"economically illiterate\\" government, arguing that Starbucks' (and Illy's) standards-based approach would ultimately benefit farmers more. In June 2007, Ethiopian Government representatives and senior leaders from Starbucks Coffee Company worked out an agreement regarding distribution, marketing and licensing that recognized the importance and integrity of Ethiopia's specialty coffee designations without disclosing financial terms. Starbucks was set to market Ethiopian coffee during two promotional periods in 2008. An Oxfam spokesman said the deal sounds like a \\"useful step\\" as long as farmers are benefiting, and a big step from a year prior when Starbucks \\"wasn't engaging directly (with) Ethiopians on adding value to their coffee\\". =Fair trade coffee= On 28 April 2007 an Australian conservative think tank, the Institute of Public Affairs, lodged a complaint with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission accusing Oxfam of misleading or deceptive conduct under the Trade Practices Act in its promotion of Fairtrade coffee. They claimed that high certification costs and low wages for workers undermine claims that Fairtrade helps to lift producers out of poverty. The complaint was subsequently dismissed by the Commission. =Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict= In October 2009, Oxfam was accused by Israeli NGO Regavim of aiding Palestinians in illegal activities in Kiryat Arba, including water theft. Oxfam has denied its participation. Oxfam UK has partnered with the Board of Deputies who represent the Jewish community of the UK. The project, Grow-Tatzmiach, includes sending 25 people to an activist training programme to help fight global hunger. In exchange for partnering, Oxfam has agreed not to \\"call for a boycott of Israeli goods or to support groups that do so, and will not partner with organizations that advocate violence or oppose a two-state solution to the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict\\". Despite this agreement, there are still those on both sides who object to this project. In response to a 2012 Oxfam report which laid the blame for poor economic development in the Palestinian territories solely with Israel, a spokesman for the Israel embassy in the UK said, \\"Oxfam's latest report on the situation in the Palestinian territories puts a clearly political agenda above any humanitarian concern. Far from advancing peace, such an approach undermines the prospects of reaching a negotiated resolution to the conflict.\\" As of 2013 Oxfam endorsed the two-state solution and wants Israel to lift the blockade of the Gaza Strip and dismantle all of the Israeli settlement infrastructure. On 17 January 2014 Oxfam UK cancelled an exhibition, \\"Gaza: Through my Eyes\\", which had been due to take place at East London Mosque after Left Foot Forward presented information to the charity detailing homophobic and potentially anti-semitic comments by one of the organizers, Ibrahim Hewitt. Human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell was reported as welcoming the event's cancellation but to have said of Oxfam UK, \\"it is hugely disappointing that it did no proper checks on (Mr. Hewitt) before agreeing his presence.\\" On 29 January 2014 actress Scarlett Johansson resigned as an international spokeswoman for Oxfam after appearing in a TV ad for SodaStream, a company with presence in the West Bank. Her publicist stated that Johansson \\"respectfully decided to end her ambassador role with Oxfam after eight years ... She and Oxfam have a fundamental difference of opinion in regards to the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement.\\" In February 2015, Israeli NGO Regavim released a report stating that the European Union had illegally funded the construction of houses; Oxfam and other NGOs participated in the project. Oxfam defended the construction \\"on humanitarian grounds.\\" In March 2020, the ambassador of Israel in the United Kingdom, Mark Regev, protested the selling of antisemitic books on Oxfam website, notably the Protocols of the Elders of Zion. After the protest, the Oxfam GB chief executive apologized and removed the books from sale. =Confrontation with Population Matters= In December 2009 Duncan Green, head of research at Oxfam, attempted to discredit the PopOffsets initiative of Population Matters (formerly known as the Optimum Population Trust), under which individuals can offset their carbon emissions by funding family planning services in the developing world. Green wrote in an op-ed in the New Statesman that assumptions such as those in the OPT report equating population growth and environmental degradation are a \\"gross oversimplification\\". In response, OPT described the response of parts of the development lobby to the initiative as \\"frankly disgraceful\\", adding: \\"The world badly needs a grown-up, rational discussion of the population issue ... without blame, abuse and hysteria.\\" =Bookshops= Oxfam shop in Cirencester, England Oxfam has been criticized for aggressively expanding its specialist bookshops, using tactics more often associated with multi-national corporations. The charity has been criticized as some claim this expansion has come at the expense of independent secondhand book sellers and other charity shops in many areas of the UK. =Dole= In May 2013 Oxfam demanded Dole remove its 'Ethical Choice' labels from its bananas in New Zealand until it improved treatment of its workers in the Philippines. A Dole spokesperson said Oxfam's report was a \\"commercial move\\" aimed at backing a rival supplier which backed Oxfam, and Oxfam was \\"trying to destroy the Dole brand\\". =2015 study on net worth inequality= Time Inc. Network wrote a reply to an Oxfam study from January 2015 on inequality stating that the richest 1% at the end of 2016 will own more than half of the world's assets. However, Time pointed out that the data were based on a study from Credit Suisse. In this study, The Global Wealth Databook 2015, personal assets were calculated in net worth, meaning wealth would be negated by having any mortgages. = Staff sexual misconduct in Haiti and Chad = In February 2018 an investigation by The Times newspaper found that Oxfam allowed three men to resign and sacked four for gross misconduct after an inquiry concerning sexual exploitation, the downloading of pornography, bullying and intimidation. A 2011 confidential report by Oxfam had found \\"a culture of impunity\\" among some staff in Haiti and concluded that 'it cannot be ruled out that any of the prostitutes were under-aged'. Among the staff who were permitted to resign was the charity's Belgian country director, Roland Van Hauwermeiren. In the internal report, Van Hauwermeiren admitted using prostitutes at a villa whose rent was paid for by Oxfam with charitable funds. Oxfam's chief executive at the time, Dame Barbara Stocking, offered Hauwermeiren \\"a phased and dignified exit\\" because sacking him risked \\"potentially serious implications\\" for the charity's work and reputation. Oxfam did not report any of the incidents to the Haitian authorities, because \\"it was extremely unlikely that any action would be taken\\". Although Oxfam disclosed details of the incident to the Charity Commission, the Commission revealed after The Times investigation that it had never received Oxfam's final investigation report and Oxfam \\"did not detail the precise allegations, nor did it make any indication of potential sexual crimes involving minors\\". A spokesperson for the Commission commented that: \\"We will expect the charity to provide us with the assurance that it has learnt lessons from past incidents\\". Oxfam later explained it had not given details to the Commission beyond \\"inappropriate sexual behaviour\\" because using prostitutes in Haiti was not illegal. In response to the revelations, Liz Truss, the chief secretary to the Treasury, described the reports as \\"shocking, sickening and depressing\\". Oxfam issued a statement in which it asserted \\"Oxfam treats any allegation of misconduct extremely seriously. As soon as we became aware of a range of allegations ‚Äì including of sexual misconduct ‚Äì in Haiti in 2011 we launched an internal investigation. The investigation was announced publicly and staff members were suspended pending the outcome\\". The statement also added that the allegations \\"that under-age girls may have been involved were not proven\\". Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, the international development secretary, Penny Mordaunt, said Oxfam had failed in its \\"moral leadership\\" over the \\"scandal\\". Mordaunt also said that Oxfam did \\"absolutely the wrong thing\\" by not reporting the detail of the allegations to the government. The incident led the International Development Committee of the UK Parliament to issue a report about sexual harassment and abuse in the humanitarian sector on 31 July 2018. Oxfam had been aware that Van Hauwermeiren while director of Oxfam's relief operation in Chad in 2006 and other staff had repeatedly used prostitutes at the Oxfam team house there, and that one of Oxfam's staff members had been fired for his behaviour. Oxfam's deputy chief executive Penny Lawrence resigned, taking full responsibility and acknowledging that \\"(c)oncerns were raised about the behaviour of staff in Chad as well as Haiti that we failed to adequately act upon\\". New allegations were made by a senior staffer, Helen Evans, who had been the lead investigator of organizational sexual misconduct between 2012 and 2015.Smout, Alistair. (13 February 2018). \\"UK's Oxfam hit by new report of sex abuse by aid workers.\\" Reuters website Retrieved 13 February 2018.

The 9 faces of K5 Each vertex in the above Hasse diagram has the ovals from the 3 adjacent faces. Faces whose ovals intersect do not touch. In mathematics, an associahedron Kn is an (n ‚àí 2)-dimensional convex polytope in which each vertex corresponds to a way of correctly inserting opening and closing parentheses in a word of n letters and the edges correspond to single application of the associativity rule. Equivalently, the vertices of an associahedron correspond to the triangulations of a regular polygon with n + 1 sides and the edges correspond to edge flips in which a single diagonal is removed from a triangulation and replaced by a different diagonal. Associahedra are also called Stasheff polytopes after the work of Jim Stasheff, who rediscovered them in the early 1960s. Revised from a 1961 Ph.D. thesis, Princeton University, . after earlier work on them by Dov Tamari.. Examples The one-dimensional associahedron K3 represents the two parenthesizations ((xy)z) and (x(yz)) of three symbols, or the two triangulations of a square. It is itself a line segment. The two-dimensional associahedron K4 represents the five parenthesizations of four symbols, or the five triangulations of a regular pentagon. It is itself a pentagon. The three- dimensional associahedron K5 is an enneahedron topologically equivalent to the order-4 truncated triangular bipyramid with nine faces (three squares and six pentagons) and fourteen vertices, and its dual is the triaugmented triangular prism. Realization Initially Jim Stasheff considered these objects as curvilinear polytopes. Subsequently, they were given coordinates as convex polytopes in several different ways; see the introduction of for a survey.. One method of realizing the associahedron is as the secondary polytope of a regular polygon. In this construction, each triangulation of a regular polygon with n + 1 sides corresponds to a point in (n + 1)-dimensional Euclidean space, whose ith coordinate is the total area of the triangles incident to the ith vertex of the polygon. For instance, the two triangulations of the unit square give rise in this way to two four-dimensional points with coordinates (1, 1/2, 1, 1/2) and (1/2, 1, 1/2, 1). The convex hull of these two points is the realization of the associahedron K3. Although it lives in a 4-dimensional space, it forms a line segment (a 1-dimensional polytope) within that space. Similarly, the associahedron K4 can be realized in this way as a regular pentagon in five-dimensional Euclidean space, whose vertex coordinates are the cyclic permutations of the vector (1, 2 + œÜ, 1, 1 + œÜ, 1 + œÜ) where œÜ denotes the golden ratio. Because the possible triangles within a regular hexagon have areas that are integer multiples of each other, this construction can be used to give integer coordinates (in six dimensions) to the three-dimensional associahedron K5; however (as the example of K4 already shows) this construction in general leads to irrational numbers as coordinates. Another realization, due to Jean-Louis Loday, is based on the correspondence of the vertices of the associahedron with n-leaf rooted binary trees, and directly produces integer coordinates in (n ‚àí 2)-dimensional space. The ith coordinate of Loday's realization is aibi, where ai is the number of leaf descendants of the left child of the ith internal node of the tree (in left-to-right order) and bi is the number of leaf descendants of the right child.. It is possible to realize the associahedron directly in (n ‚àí 2)-dimensional space as a polytope for which all of the face normal vectors have coordinates that are 0, +1, or ‚àí1\\\\. There are exponentially many combinatorially distinct ways of doing this.. K5 as an order-4 truncated triangular bipyramid Because K5 is a polyhedron only with vertices in which 3 edges come together it is possible for a hydrocarbon to exist (similar to the Platonic hydrocarbons) whose chemical structure is represented by the skeleton of K5.IPME document about mini-fullerenes - page 30 (page 9 in this PDF) shows in chapter ‚Äú7. Fullerene of fourteen carbon atoms C14‚Äù under ‚Äúb) Base-truncated triangular bipyramid (Fig. 16)‚Äù a K5 polyhedron This ‚Äúassociahedrane‚Äù C14H14 would have the SMILES notation: C12-C3-C4-C1-C5-C6-C2-C7-C3-C8-C4-C5-C6-C78. Its edges would be of approximately equal length, but the vertices of each face would not necessarily be coplanar. Indeed, K5 is a near-miss Johnson solid: it looks like it might be possible to make from squares and regular pentagons, but it is not. Either the vertices will not quite be coplanar, or the faces will have to be distorted slightly away from regularity. Number of k-faces { align=right  k = 1 2 3 4 5 n 1 1 1 2 1 2 3 3 1 5 5 11 4 1 9 21 14 45 5 1 14 56 84 42 197 } The number of (n ‚àí k)-dimensional faces of the associahedron of order n (Kn+1) is given by the number triangle (n,k), shown on the right. The number of vertices in Kn+1 is the n-th Catalan number (right diagonal in the triangle). The number of facets in Kn+1 (for n‚â•2) is the n-th triangular number minus one (second column in the triangle), because each facet corresponds to a 2-subset of the n objects whose groupings form the Tamari lattice Tn, except the 2-subset that contains the first and the last element. The number of faces of all dimensions (including the associahedron itself as a face, but not including the empty set) is a Schr√∂der‚ÄìHipparchus number (row sums of the triangle).. Diameter In the late 1980s, in connection with the problem of rotation distance, Daniel Sleator, Robert Tarjan, and William Thurston provided a proof that the diameter of the n-dimensional associahedron Kn + 2 is at most 2n ‚àí 4 for infinitely many n and for all \\"large enough\\" values of n.. They also proved that this upper bound is tight when n is large enough, and conjectured that \\"large enough\\" means ‚Äústrictly greater than 9‚Äù. This conjecture was proved in 2012 by Lionel Pournin.. Scattering amplitudes In 2017, Mizera and Arkani-Hamed et al.. showed that the associahedron plays a central role in the theory of scattering amplitudes for the bi-adjoint cubic scalar theory. In particular, there exists an associahedron in the space of scattering kinematics, and the tree level scattering amplitude is the volume of the dual associahedron. The associahedron also helps explaining the relations between scattering amplitudes of open and closed strings in string theory. See also Amplituhedron.

Cluster expansions originated in the work of . Unlike the usual perturbation expansion, it converges in some non-trivial regions, in particular when the interaction is small. Classical case =General theory= In statistical mechanics, the properties of a system of noninteracting particles are described using the partition function. For N noninteracting particles, the system is described by the Hamiltonian : \\\\big. H_0=\\\\sum_i^N \\\\frac{p_i^2}{2m}, and the partition function can be calculated (for the classical case) as :\\\\big. Z_0 =\\\\frac{1}{N!h^{3N}}\\\\int \\\\prod_i d\\\\vec{p}_i\\\\;d\\\\vec{r}_i \\\\exp\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ -\\\\beta H_0(\\\\\\\\{r_i,p_i\\\\\\\\})\\\\right\\\\\\\\} =\\\\frac{V^N}{N!h^{3N}}\\\\left( \\\\frac{2\\\\pi m}{\\\\beta} \\\\right)^{\\\\frac{3N}{2}}. From the partition function, one can calculate the Helmholtz free energy \\\\big. F_0=-k_BT\\\\ln Z_0 and, from that, all the thermodynamic properties of the system, like the entropy, the internal energy, the chemical potential, etc. When the particles of the system interact, an exact calculation of the partition function is usually not possible. For low density, the interactions can be approximated with a sum of two-particle potentials: :\\\\big. U\\\\left( \\\\\\\\{r_i\\\\\\\\} \\\\right) = \\\\sum_{i=1, i For this interaction potential, the partition function can be written as :\\\\big. Z =Z_0 \\\\ Q , and the free energy is :F=F_0 - k_BT\\\\\\\\!\\\\ln\\\\left( Q \\\\right) , where Q is the configuration integral: : Q=\\\\frac{1}{V^N}\\\\int \\\\prod_i d\\\\vec{r}_i\\\\exp\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ -\\\\beta \\\\sum_{i=1, i =Calculation of the configuration integral= The configuration integral Q cannot be calculated analytically for a general pair potential u_2(r). One way to calculate the potential approximately is to use the Mayer cluster expansion. This expansion is based on the observation that the exponential in the equation for Q can be written as a product of the form : \\\\exp\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ -\\\\beta \\\\sum_{1\\\\le i. Next, define the Mayer function f_{ij} by \\\\exp\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ -\\\\beta u_2(r_{ij}) \\\\right\\\\\\\\}=1+f_{ij}. After substitution, the equation for the configuration integral becomes: :\\\\big. Q=\\\\frac{1}{V^N}\\\\int \\\\prod_i d\\\\vec{r}_i \\\\prod_{1\\\\le i The calculation of the product in the above equation leads into a series of terms; the first is equal to one, the second term is equal to the sum over i and j of the terms f_{ij}, and the process continues until all the higher order terms are calculated. : \\\\prod_{1\\\\le i Each term must appear only once. With this expansion it is possible to find terms of different order, in terms of the number of particles that are involved. The first term is the non-interaction term (corresponding to no interactions amongst particles), the second term corresponds to the two-particle interactions, the third to the two-particle interactions amongst 4 (not necessarily distinct) particles, and so on. This physical interpretation is the reason this expansion is called the cluster expansion: the sum can be rearranged so that each term represents the interactions within clusters of a certain number of particles. Substituting the expansion of the product back into the expression for the configuration integral results in a series expansion for Q: :\\\\big. Q=1+\\\\frac{N}{V}\\\\alpha_1 + \\\\frac{N\\\\;(N-1)}{2\\\\;V^2}\\\\alpha_2+\\\\cdots. Substituting in the equation for the free energy, it is possible to derive the equation of state for the system of interacting particles. The equation will have the form : PV=Nk_BT\\\\left( 1 + \\\\frac{N}{V}B_2(T) + \\\\frac{N^2}{V^2}B_3(T) + \\\\frac{N^3}{V^3}B_4(T)+ \\\\cdots \\\\right) , which is known as the virial equation, and the components B_i(T) are the virial coefficients. Each of the virial coefficients corresponds to one term from the cluster expansion (B_2(T) is the two-particle interaction term, B_3(T) is the three-particle interaction term and so on). Keeping only the two-particle interaction term, it can be shown that the cluster expansion, with some approximations, gives the Van der Waals equation. This can be applied further to mixtures of gases and liquid solutions.

The term is broadly defined in the modern era as opposition to the State of Israel or, prior to 1948, its establishment, as well as to the political movement of Jews to self- determination.\\"What Is‚Ä¶ Anti-Israel, Anti-Semitic, Anti-Zionist?\\" ADL. 8 February 2019.\\"What's the difference between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism?\\" BBC. 29 April 2016. 8 February 2019.Pessin Andrew and Doron S. Ben-Atar. Introduction. Anti-Zionism on Campus: The University, Free Speech, and BDS, edited by Pessin and Ben-Atar, Indiana UP, 2018, pp. 1-40. The anti-Zionism movement has attracted supporters and controversy, including within the broader Jewish community. Critics of anti-Zionism have charged it is a cover for modern-day antisemitism, that it may be motivated by prejudices against Jewish people, or that it creates a climate where anti-semitism is viewed as acceptable. Defenders of anti-Zionism have rejected these characterizations and counter-accused critics of attempting to stifle legitimate criticisms of Israeli policies, particularly of Israeli military actions and occupation of the West Bank. History Jewish anti-Zionism Jewish anti-Zionism is as old as Zionism itself, and enjoyed widespread support in the Jewish community until World War II.Mike Marqusee, If I Am Not For Myself: Journey of an Anti- Zionist Jew, Verso Books (2008) 2010 p.vii:‚ÄôAs long as there has been Zionism, there have been anti-Zionist Jews. Indeed, decades before it even came to the notice of non-Jews, anti-Zionism was a well-established Jewish ideology and until World War 11 commanded wide support in the diaspora.‚Äô The Jewish community is not a single united group, and responses vary among Jewish groups. One of the principal divisions is that between secular Jews and religious Jews. Reasons for secular opposition to the Zionist movement are very different from those of Haredi Jews. Opposition to a Jewish state has changed over time and has taken on a diverse spectrum of religious, ethical and political positions. The legitimacy of anti-Zionist views has been disputed to the present day, including the more recent and disputed relationship between anti-Zionism and antisemitism. Other views regarding the various forms of anti-Zionism have also been discussed and debated. =Before 1948= There is a long tradition of Jewish anti-Zionism that has opposed the Zionist project from its origins. The Bundists, the Autonomists, Reform Judaism and the Agude regarded the rationale and territorial ambitions of Zionism as flawed. Yevsektsiya, the Jewish section of the Communist Party in the Soviet Union, targeted the Zionist movement and managed to close down their offices and place Zionist literature under a ban. However, Soviet officials themselves often disapproved of their anti-Zionist zeal.Colin Shindler, Israel and the European Left: Between Solidarity and Delegitimization, Bloomsbury Publishing USA, 2011 pp.31-32,Yitzhak Arad, The Holocaust in the Soviet Union, University of Nebraska Press 2009 p.19. Orthodox Judaism, which grounds civic responsibilities and patriotic feelings in religion, was strongly opposed to Zionism because, though the two shared the same values, Zionism espoused nationalism in secular fashion, and used \\"Zion\\", \\"Jerusalem\\", \\"Land of Israel\\", \\"redemption\\" and \\"ingathering of exiles\\" as literal rather than sacred terms, endeavouring to achieve them in this world.S. Almog, Jehuda Reinharz, Anita Shapira (eds.), Zionism and Religion, UPNE, 1998 citing Isaac Breuer,Judenproblem, Halle 1918 p. 89 Some Orthodox Jews also opposed the creation of a Jewish state prior to the appearance of the messiah, as contradicting divine will. By contrast, reform Jews rejected Judaism as a national or ethnic identity and renounced any messianic expectations of the advent of a Jewish state.Ross p. 6. Religious Hope for return to the land of Israel is embodied in the content of the Jewish religion (see Kibbutz Galuyot). Aliyah, the Hebrew word meaning \\"ascending\\" or \\"going up\\", is the word used to describe religious Jewish return to Israel, and has been used since ancient times. From the Middle Ages and onwards, many famous rabbis and often their followers returned to the land of Israel. These have included Nahmanides, Yechiel of Paris, Isaac Luria, Yosef Karo, Menachem Mendel of Vitebsk among others. For Jews in the Diaspora Eretz Israel was revered in a religious sense. They prayed, and thought of the return, as being fulfilled in a messianic age.Taylor, A. R., 1971, Vision and intent in Zionist Thought, pp. 10, 11 Return remained a recurring theme for generations, particularly in Passover and Yom Kippur prayers, which traditionally concluded with, \\"Next year in Jerusalem\\", as well as the thrice-daily Amidah (Standing prayer). Following Jewish Enlightenment however, Reform Judaism dropped many traditional beliefs, including aliyah, as incompatible with modern life within the Diaspora. Later, Zionism re-kindled the concept of aliyah in an ideological and political sense, parallel with traditional religious belief; it was used to increase the Jewish population in the Holy Land by immigration. It remains a basic tenet of Zionist ideology. Support for aliyah does not always equal immigration; however, most of the world's Jewish population resides within the Diaspora. Support for the modern Zionist movement is not universal, and, as a result, some religious Jews, as well as some secular Jews, do not support Zionism. Non-Zionist Jews are not necessarily anti- Zionists, although some are. Generally however, Zionism does have the support of the majority of the Jewish religious organizations, with support from segments of the Orthodox movement, and most of the Conservative, and more recently, the Reform movement.Rachael Gelfman, \\"Religious Zionists believe that the Jewish return to Israel hastens the Messiah\\" Ehud Bandel ‚Äì President, the Masorti Movement, \\"Zionism\\" Many Hasidic rabbis oppose the creation of a Jewish state. The leader of the Satmar Hasidic group, Rabbi Joel Teitelbaum's book, VaYoel Moshe, published in 1958, expounds one Orthodox position on Zionism, based on a literal form of midrash (biblical interpretation). Citing to Tractate Kesubos 111a of the Talmud Teitelbaum states that God and the Jewish people exchanged three oaths at the time of the Jews' exile from ancient Israel, forbidding the Jewish people from massively immigrating to the Land of Israel, and from rebelling against the nations of the world. Secular Prior to the Second World War many Jews regarded Zionism as a fanciful and unrealistic movement.Walter Laqueur, A History of Zionism, (Schocken Books, New York 1978, ), pp385-6. Many liberals during the European Enlightenment had argued that Jews should enjoy full equality only because they pledge their singular loyalty to their nation-state and entirely assimilate to the local, national culture; they called for the \\"regeneration\\" of the Jewish people in exchange for rights. Those liberal Jews who accepted integration and assimilation principles saw Zionism as a threat to efforts to facilitate Jewish citizenship and equality within the European nation-state context.Walter Laqueur, A History of Zionism, p. 399. The Jewish Anti-Zionist League, in Egypt, was a Communist-influenced anti-Zionist league in the years 1946‚Äì1947. In Israel, there are several Jewish anti-Zionist organisations and politicians; many of these are related to Matzpen. =After World War II and the creation of Israel= Attitudes changed during and following the war. In May 1942, before the full revelation of the Holocaust, the Biltmore Program proclaimed a fundamental departure from traditional Zionist policy of a \\"homeland\\"American Jewish Year Book Vol. 45 (1943‚Äì1944) \\"Pro-Palestine and Zionist Activities\\", pp. 206‚Äì214 with its demand \\"that Palestine be established as a Jewish Commonwealth\\". Opposition to official Zionism's firm, unequivocal stand caused some prominent Zionists to establish their own party, Ichud (Unification), which advocated an Arab ‚Äì Jewish Federation in Palestine. Opposition to the Biltmore Program also led to the founding of the anti- Zionist American Council for Judaism. The full knowledge of the Holocaust altered the views of many who critiqued Zionism before 1948, including the British journalist Isaac Deutscher, a socialist and lifelong atheist who nevertheless emphasized the importance of his Jewish heritage. Before World War II, Deutscher opposed Zionism as economically retrograde and harmful to the cause of international socialism, but in the aftermath of the Holocaust he regretted his pre-war views, arguing for Israel's establishment as a \\"historic necessity\\" to provide a refuge for the surviving Jews of Europe. Post-Zionism, a related term, has been criticized as being equivalent to anti-Zionism. Religious Neturei Karta call for dismantling of the state of Israel at AIPAC conference in Washington, DC, May 2005 Most Orthodox religious groups have accepted and actively support the State of Israel, even if they have not adopted the \\"Zionist\\" ideology. The World Agudath Israel party (founded in Poland) has, at times, participated in Israeli government coalitions. Most religious Zionists hold pro-Israel views from a right-wing viewpoint. The main exceptions are Hasidic groups such as Satmar Hasidim, which have about 100,000 adherents worldwide and numerous different, smaller Hasidic groups, unified in America in the Central Rabbinical Congress of the United States and Canada and Israel in the Edah HaChareidis.Jews Against Zionism website Retrieved 4 June 2008.Jews Against Zionism website Retrieved 22 January 2013. According to Jonathan Judaken, 'numerous Jewish traditions have insisted that preservation of what is most precious about Judaism and Jewishness \\"demands\\" a principled anti-Zionism or post-Zionism.' This tradition dwindled in the aftermath of the Holocaust, and the establishment of Israel but is still alive in religious groups such as Neturei Karta and among many intellectuals of Jewish background in Israel and the diaspora, such as George Steiner, Tony Judt and Baruch Kimmerling.Jonathan Judaken, \\"Rethinking the New Antisemitism\\", in Jonathan Judaken (ed.), Naming Race, Naming Racisms, Routledge, 2013 pp. 195-223 pp. 215-216. Secular Noam Chomsky has reported a change in the boundaries of what are considered Zionist and anti-Zionist views.Peck, James (ed.) (1987). Chomsky Reader. . p. 7. \\"what was then called 'Zionist' ... are now called 'anti-Zionist' (concerns and views)\\". In 1947, in his youth, Chomsky's support for a socialist binational state, in conjunction with his opposition to any semblance of a theocratic system of governance in Israel, was at the time considered well within the mainstream of secular Zionism; today, it lands him solidly in the anti-Zionist camp.Peck, James (ed.)

Rosenfeld in his much discussed essay, Progressive Jewish Thought and the New Anti-Semitism,Alvin H. Rosenfeld. 'Progressive' Jewish Thought and the New Anti-Semitism . American Jewish Committee. 2006. claims that a \\"number of Jews, through their speaking and writing, are feeding a rise in virulent antisemitism by questioning whether Israel should even exist\\".Patricia Cohen. \\"Essay Linking Liberal Jews and Anti-Semitism Sparks a Furor\\". The New York Times. 31 January 2007. Retrieved 19 March 2007. Rosenfeld's general claims are: #\\"At a time when the de-legitimization and, ultimately, the eradication of Israel is a goal being voiced with mounting fervor by the enemies of the Jewish state, it is more than disheartening to see Jews themselves adding to the vilification. That some do so in the name of Judaism itself makes the nature of their assault all the more grotesque.\\" #\\"Their contributions to what's becoming normative discourse are toxic. They're helping to make [anti- Semitic] views about the Jewish state respectable ‚Äì for example, that it's a Nazi-like state, comparable to South African apartheid; that it engages in ethnic cleansing and genocide. These charges are not true and can have the effect of delegitimizing Israel.\\" Some Jewish organizations oppose Zionism as an integral part of their anti-imperialism. Today, some secular Jews, particularly socialists and Marxists, continue to oppose the State of Israel on anti-imperialist and human rights grounds. Many oppose it as a form of nationalism, which they argue to be a product of capitalist societies. One secular anti-Zionist group today is the International Jewish Anti-Zionist Network, a socialist, anti-war, and anti-imperialist organization that calls for \\"the dismantling of Israeli apartheid return of Palestinian refugees, and the ending of the Israeli colonization of historic Palestine.\\" Outside the Jewish community =Palestinians= The Palestinian Arab Christian-owned Falastin newspaper featuring a caricature on its 18 June 1936 edition showing Zionism as a crocodile under the protection of a British officer telling Palestinian Arabs: \\"don't be afraid!!! I will swallow you peacefully...\\". Anne de Jong asserts that direct resistance from inhabitants of historical Palestine \\"focused less on religious arguments and was instead centred on countering the experience of colonial dispossession and opposing the Zionist enforcement of ethnic division of the indigenous population.\\" Palestinian- Christian owned Falastin was founded in 1911 in the then Arab-majority city of Jaffa. The newspaper is often described as one of the most influential publications in historic Palestine, and probably the nation's fiercest and most consistent critic of the Zionist movement. It helped shape Palestinian identity and nationalism and was shut down several times by the Ottoman and British authorities, mostly due to Zionists' complaints. =British colonial officials= The British anti-ZionistNaomi Wiener Cohen, The Americanization of Zionism, 1897-1948, UPNE, 2003 p.123. John Hope Simpson believed that the Arabs were \\"economically powerless against such a strong movement\\" and thus needed protection. Charles Anderson writes that Hope Simpson was also \\"wary of the gulf between Zionist rhetoric and practice, observing that 'The loftiest sentiments are ventilated in public meetings and Zionist propaganda' but that the Jewish National Fund and other organs of the movement did not uphold or embody a vision of cooperation or mutual benefit with the Arabs.\\" =Secular Arab= President Gamal Abdel Nasser, pan-Arabist Anti-Zionism in the Arab world emerged at the end of the 19th century, very soon after the First Zionist Congress was held in Basel in 1897. However, only after the Young Turk revolution in 1908 did opposition to Zionism in Palestine and Greater Syria became widespread. According to philosopher Michael Neumann, Zionism as an \\"expansionist threat\\" has caused Arab hostility toward Israel and even antisemitism.Michael Neumann, \\"What is antisemitism?\\" , Counterpunch, 4 June 2002. Pan-Arabist narratives in the 1960s Nasser era emphasized the idea of Palestine as a part of the Arab world taken by others. In this narrative, the natural means of combating Zionism is Arab nations uniting and attacking Israel militarily. Most Arab citizens of Israel do not have strong anti- Zionist views. A poll of 507 Arab-Israelis conducted by the Israeli Democracy Institute in 2007 found that 75 percent profess support for Israel's status as a Jewish and democratic state that guarantees equal rights for minorities. Israeli Arab support for a constitution in general was 88 percent. =Muslim= Quds Day demonstration in Qom, Iran Anti-Zionist Muslims consider the State of Israel as an intrusion into what many Muslims consider to be Dar al-Islam, a domain they believe to be rightfully, and permanently, ruled only by Muslims as it was historically conquered in the name of Islam. p. 201 p.122 p. 4 Palestinian and other Muslim groups, as well as the government of Iran (since the 1979 Islamic Revolution), insist that the State of Israel is illegitimate and refuse to refer to it as \\"Israel\\", instead using the locution \\"the Zionist entity\\" (see Iran‚ÄìIsrael relations). Islamic maps of the Middle East frequently do not show the State of Israel. In an interview with Time Magazine in December 2006, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said \\"Everyone knows that the Zionist regime is a tool in the hands of the United States and British governments.\\" This sort of rhetoric has been a feature of the Muslim world for decades.Pipes, Daniel. \\"Will Arab Anti-Zionism Revive?\\" Middle East Forum. 6 January 2020. 16 January 2020. The Grand Mufti of Jerusalem Mohammed Amin al Husseini opposed the Jewish immigration to Palestine before the creation of the State of Israel, and in several documented cases expressed his hostility toward Jews in general and Zionists in particular. Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, whom the Anti-Defamation League named \\"the leading anti- Semite in America\\", has a long track record of hostility towards Jews in general and Zionists in particular. =Christian= Positions of the World Council of Churches The World Council of Churches (WCC) has been described as taking anti-Zionist positions in connection with its criticisms of Israeli policy. It is claimed the council has focused disproportionately on activities and publications criticizing Israel in comparison with other human rights issues. The council members have been characterized by Israel's former Justice minister Amnon Rubinstein as anti-Zionist, saying \\"they just hate Israel\\". The WCC has been charged with prioritising Anti-Zionism to the extent it has neglected appeals from Egyptian Copts to raise their plight under Sadat and Mubarak in order to avoid distracting world attention. Presbyterian Church of USA After publishing \\"Zionism unsettled\\", which it initially commended as \\"a valuable opportunity to explore the political ideology of Zionism\\", the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) promptly withdrew the publication from sale on its website following criticism that it was Anti-Zionist, one critic claimed it posits that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is fueled by a 'pathology inherent in Zionism.' In February 2016, the General Assembly was lobbied by its Advisory Committee on Social Witness Policy (ACSWP) to lay aside a two state solution and support the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement. Presbyterians for Middle East Peace described this proposal as a \\"one-sided, zero-sum solution\\". Lausanne Committee for World Evangelization In January 2015, the Lausanne movement, published an article in its official journal made comparisons between Christian Zionism, the crusades and the Spanish Inquisition and described Zionism as \\"apartheid on steroids\\". The Simon Wiesenthal Center described this last claim as \\"the big lie\\", and rebutted the \\"dismissal of the validity of Israel's right to exist as the Jewish State\\". Church of Scotland Despite its strong historic support for Restorationism, famously by Robert Murray M'Chyene and by both Horatius and Andrew Bonar, in April 2013 the Church of Scotland published \\"The Inheritance of Abraham: A Report on the Promised Land\\", which rejected the idea of a special right of Jewish people to the Holy Land through analysis of scripture and Jewish theological claims. The report further denied the \\"belief among some Jewish people that they have a right to the land of Israel as a compensation for the suffering of the Holocaust\\" and argued \\"it is a misuse of the Bible to use it as a topographic guide to settle contemporary conflicts over land.\\" The report was criticised by Jewish leaders in Scotland as \\"biased, weak on sources, and contradictory. The picture it paints of both Judaism and Israel is barely even a caricature.\\" Subsequently, the Church issued a statement saying that the Church had not changed its \\"long-held position of the rights of Israel to exist\\". It also revised the report. Methodist Church of Great Britain Charles and John Wesley, founders of the Methodist Church, held Restorationist views. Following the submission of a report titled 'Justice for Palestine and Israel' in July 2010, the UK Methodist Conference questioned whether 'Zionism was compatible with Methodist beliefs'. Christian Zionism was characterised as believing that Israel \\"must be held above criticism whatever policy is enacted\\", and conference called for a boycott of selected Israeli goods \\"emanating from illegal settlements\\". The UK's Chief Rabbi described the report as \\"unbalanced, factually and historically flawed\\", and said that it offered \\"no genuine understanding of one of the most complex conflicts in the world today. Many in both communities will be deeply disturbed.\\" =Third Position, fascist, and right-wing= The flag of the Knights Party, the political branch of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. Anti-Zionism has a long history of being supported by various individuals and groups associated with Third Position, right-wing and fascist (or \\"neo-fascist\\") political views. *Chesler, Phyllis.

In these instances, anti-Zionism is usually also deeply anti-Semitic, and often revolves around conspiracy theories discussed below. =Soviet Union= During the last years of Stalin's rule, official support for the creation of Israel in 1948 was replaced by strong anti-Zionism. According to Izabella Tabarovsky, a researcher with the Kennan Institute: > \\"[T]he Soviets ... [claimed] that their ideology was anti-Zionist, not anti- > Semitic. ... Soviet ideologues relied for inspiration on the Protocols of > the Elders of Zion, on the ideas of classic religious anti-Semitism, and > even Mein Kampf, but adopted them to the Marxist framework by substituting > the idea of a global anti-Soviet Zionist conspiracy for a specifically > Jewish one. Jewish power became Zionist power. The rich and conniving Jewish > bankers controlling money, politicians, and the media became the rich and > conniving Zionists.

Instead of the Jew as the devil, they presented the Zionist as a > Nazi.\\"Tabarovsky, Izabella. \\"How Soviet Propaganda ....\\" Tablet Magazine. 6 > June 2019. 12 June 2019. As outlined in the third edition of the Great Soviet Encyclopedia (1969‚Äì1978), the Communist Party of the Soviet Union's position during the Cold War became: \\"the main posits of modern Zionism are militant chauvinism, racism, anti- Communism and anti-Sovietism, [...] overt and covert fight against freedom movements and the USSR.\\" –°–∏–æ–Ω–∏–∑–º, –ë–æ–ª—å—à–∞—è —Å–æ–≤–µ—Ç—Å–∫–∞—è —ç–Ω—Ü–∏–∫–ª–æ–ø–µ–¥–∏—è (Zionism. Great Soviet Encyclopedia, 3rd Edition. 1969‚Äì1978) =International= Anti- Zionist sentiments were also manifested in organisations such as the Organization for African Unity and the Non-Aligned Movement, which passed resolutions condemning Zionism and equating it with racism and apartheid during the early 1970s. This culminated in the passing by the United Nations General Assembly of Resolution 3379 in November 1975, which declared \\"Zionism is a form of racism.\\" The decision was revoked on 16 December 1991, when the General Assembly passed Resolution 4686, repealing resolution 3379, by a vote of 111 to 25, with 13 abstentions and 17 delegations absent. Thirteen out of the 19 Arab countries, including those engaged in negotiations with Israel, voted against the repeal, another six were absent. No Arab country voted for repeal. The Palestine Liberation Organisation denounced the vote. All of the ex-communist countries and most of the African countries who had supported Resolution 3379 voted to repeal it. =African-American= After Israel occupied Palestinian territory following the 1967 Six-Day War, some African- Americans supported the Palestinians and criticized Israel's actions, for example by publicly supporting Palestinian leader Yassir Arafat and calling for the destruction of the Jewish state.Dollinger, Mark, \\"African American- Jewish Relations\\" in Antisemitism: a historical encyclopedia of prejudice and persecution, Vol 1, 2005. pp. 4‚Äì5 Immediately after the war, the black power organization Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee published a newsletter criticizing Israel, and asserting that the war was an effort to regain Palestinian land and that during the 1948 war, \\"Zionists conquered the Arab homes and land through terror, force, and massacres.\\"Carson, Clayborne, (1984) \\"Blacks and Jews in the Civil Rights Movement: the Case of SNCC\\", in Strangers & neighbors: relations between Blacks & Jews in the United States, (Adams, Maurianne, Ed.), 2000., p. 583 In 1993, philosopher Cornel West wrote: \\"Jews will not comprehend what the symbolic predicament and literal plight of Palestinians in Israel means to blacks.... Blacks often perceive the Jewish defense of the state of Israel as a second instance of naked group interest, and, again, an abandonment of substantive moral deliberation.\\"West, Cornel, Race Matters, 1993, pp. 73‚Äì74 African-American support of Palestinians is frequently due to the consideration of Palestinians as people of color ‚Äì political scientist Andrew Hacker writes: \\"The presence of Israel in the Middle East is perceived as thwarting the rightful status of people of color. Some blacks view Israel as essentially a white and European power, supported from the outside, and occupying space that rightfully belongs to the original inhabitants of Palestine.\\"Hacker, Andrew (1999) \\"Jewish Racism, Black anti- Semitism\\", in Strangers & neighbors: relations between Blacks & Jews in the United States, Maurianne Adams (Ed.). University of Massachusetts Press, 1999, p. 20 Anti-Zionism and antisemitism A sign held at a protest in Edinburgh, Scotland on January 10, 2009 In the early 21st century, it was also claimed that a \\"new antisemitism\\" had emerged that was rooted in anti-Zionism.Denis MacShane, \\"The New Anti-Semitism\\", The Washington Post, 4 September 2007 Advocates of this concept argue that much of what purports to be criticism of Israel and Zionism is demonization, and has led to an international resurgence of attacks on Jews and Jewish symbols and an increased acceptance of antisemitic beliefs in public discourse.Taguieff, Pierre-Andr√©. Rising From the Muck: The New Anti-Semitism in Europe. Ivan R. Dee, 2004. Critics of the concept have suggested that the characterization of anti-Zionism as antisemitic is inaccurate, sometimes obscures legitimate criticism of Israel's policies and actions and trivializes antisemitism. =View that the two are interlinked= A number of sources link anti-Zionism with antisemitism. Campus research in 2016 in the United States by the AMCHA Initiative has also reported close geographical correlation between the two phenomena, accompanying a recent upsurge in anti-Semitism. Government officials French President Emmanuel Macron calls anti-Zionism \\"a reinvention of anti- Semitism.\\" French Prime Minister Manuel Valls expressed similar views. In the 2015, a German court in Essen ruled that \\"'Zionist' in the language of antisemites is a code for Jew\\". Taylan Can, a German citizen of Turkish origin, yelled \\"death and hate to Zionists\\" at an anti-Israel rally in Essen in July 2014, and was convicted for hate crime. In contrast, in February 2015, a court in Wuppertal convicted two German Palestinians of an arson attack on a synagogue, but denied that the crime was motivated by antisemitism.\\"German Judge: Torching of Synagogue not motivated by anti-Semitism\\", The Jerusalem Post (7 February 2012) Academia Professor Kenneth L. Marcus, former staff director at the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, identifies four main views on the relationship between anti-Zionism and antisemitism, at least in North America:(p. 845‚Äì846) Marcus also states:Jacob Rader Marcus, The Jew in the American World: A Source Book, pp. 199‚Äì203. Wayne State University Press, 1996. \\"Unsurprisingly, recent research has shown a close correlation between anti-Israeli views and anti-Semitic views based on a survey of citizens in ten European countries.\\" Professor Robert S. Wistrich, head of the Vidal Sassoon International Center for the Study of Antisemitism at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, is the originator of Marcus's second view of anti-Zionism (that anti-Zionism and antisemitism merged post-1948) argues that much contemporary anti-Zionism, particularly forms that compare Zionism and Jews with Hitler and the Third Reich, has become a form of antisemitism: > \\"Anti-Zionism has become the most dangerous and effective form of anti- > Semitism in our time, through its systematic delegitimization, defamation, > and demonization of Israel. Although not a priori anti-Semitic, the calls to > dismantle the Jewish state, whether they come from Muslims, the Left, or the > radical Right, increasingly rely on an anti-Semitic stereotypization of > classic themes, such as the manipulative 'Jewish lobby,' the Jewish/Zionist > 'world conspiracy,' and Jewish/Israeli \\"warmongers\\".

Or, to quote > noted human rights lawyer David Matas: One form of antisemitism denies > access of Jews to goods and services because they are Jewish.

See also > Emanuele Ottolenghi British sociologist David Hirsh wrote a book called Contemporary Left Antisemitism in which he studied anti-Zionism empirically. Philosophically, one might privately find under a set of theoretical circumstances that it is possible to be an anti-Zionist without being an antisemite, but according to Hirsh's book, \\"When anti-Zionism gets a foothold [in an organization] and becomes popular and normal and legitimate, it brings antisemitism with it.\\"Halpern, Gilad, host. \\"Left Handed Compliments ....\\" The Tel Aviv Review, TLV1 Podcasts. 17 November 2017.

Others According to the December 1969 issue of Encounter, a student attacked Zionism while in the presence of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., an American civil rights activist. King responded to the student, \\"When people criticize Zionists, they mean Jews. You're talking anti-Semitism.\\"\\"Martin Luther King on Anti-Zionism.\\" Jewish Virtual Library. 21 November 2017. Israeli journalist Ben-Dror Yemini maintains that anti-Zionism is \\"politically correct antisemitism\\" and argues that the same way Jews were demonized, Israel is demonized, the same way the right of Jews to exist was denied, the right for Self-determination is denied from Israel, the same way Jews were presented as a menace to the world, Israel is presented as a menace to the world.Ben- Dror Yemini, ◊ë◊ü-◊ì◊®◊ï◊®, ◊™◊®◊í◊ô◊¢ , nrg Maariv, 28 April 2010. Israeli American journalist Liel Leibovitz says that 21st century \\"anti-Zionists\\" do not like Jews whether they live in Israel or anywhere else in the world. He cites the example of the \\"anti-Zionist\\" professor at Oberlin who posted antisemitic conspiracy theories on her website and the \\"anti-Zionist\\" Stanford University student who claimed that many of the classical antisemitic conspiracy theories are not antisemitic.Leibovitz, Liel. \\"Anti-Zionism Is Anti-Semitism. Get Over It\\". Tablet Magazine. 13 April 2016. 16 April 2016. British socialist Adam Langleben had been a supporter of the British Labour Party all of his life until its leader, Jeremy Corbyn, was caught on video accusing \\"Zionists\\" of lacking a sense of irony possessed by other British citizens. Although Corbyn used the word \\"Zionist\\" and not the word \\"Jew,\\" Langleben asserted, \\"[F]or any Jewish person watching the video we will have heard ‚ÄòJew,‚Äô because most Jews in Britain subscribe to being a Zionist or supportive of the state of Israel‚Äînot the policies, but the existence [of the Jewish state].\\"Serhan, Yasmeen. \\"Jeremy Corbyn's Anti-Semitism ....\\" The Atlantic. 28 August 2018. 28 August 2018. Langleben's break with Labour came after repeatedly defending Corbyn from critics. Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times op-ed columnist Bret Stephens wrote that anti-Zionists \\"excel in making excuses for the wicked and finding fault with the good. When you find yourself on the same side as Hassan Nasrallah, Louis Farrakhan and David Duke on the question of a country‚Äôs right to exist, it‚Äôs time to re-examine every opinion you hold.\\" Stephens admitted, \\"Anti-Zionism might have been a respectable point of view before 1948, when the question of Israel‚Äôs existence was in the future and up for debate. Today, anti-Zionism is a call for the elimination of a state ‚Äî details to follow regarding the fate befalling those who currently live in it\\" (emphasis in the original).Stephens, Bret. \\"When Anti-Zionism Tunnels Under Your House.\\" New York Times. 13 December 2018. 13 December 2018. In another column, Stephens wrote, \\"Of course it‚Äôs theoretically possible to distinguish anti-Zionism from anti-Semitism, just as it‚Äôs theoretically possible to distinguish segregationism from racism. But the striking feature of anti- Zionist rhetoric is how broadly it overlaps with traditionally anti-Semitic tropes.\\"Stephens. \\"The Progressive Assault on Israel.\\" New York Times. 8 February 2019. 8 February 2019. =View that the two are not interlinked= On the appointment of Steve Bannon, who is reputed to be anti-semitic, as Donald Trump's White House Chief Strategist and Senior Counselor in 2016, several commentators said Bannon's personal attitudes would not necessarily translate into opposition to Israel. The sociologist Steven M. Cohen finds little correlation between antisemitism and anti-Zionism, while Todd Gitlin stated that anti-Semitism and right-wing Zionism can coexist without difficulty.Naomi Zeveloff, \\"How Steve Bannon and Breitbart News Can Be Pro-Israel ‚Äî and Anti- Semitic at the Same Time\\", The Forward Critics such as Norman Finkelstein,Norman Finkelstein, with Sherri Muzher, \\"Beyond Chutzpah\\", Znet 2 November 2005 Tariq Ali,Ali, Tariq. \\"Notes on Anti-Semitism, Zionism and Palestine\\" , Counterpunch, 4 March 2004, first published in il manifesto, 26 February 2004.

Brian Klug argued, \\"We should unite in rejecting racism in all its forms: the Islamophobia that demonises Muslims, as well as the anti-semitic discourse that can infect anti-Zionism and poison the political debate. However, people of goodwill can disagree politically - even to the extent of arguing over Israel's future as a Jewish state. Equating anti- Zionism with anti-semitism can also, in its own way, poison the political debate.\\" On 15 January 2004, Klug wrote, \\"To argue that hostility to Israel and hostility to Jews are one and the same thing is to conflate the Jewish state with the Jewish people.\\"Klug, Brian. The Myth of the New Anti-Semitism. The Nation, posted 15 January 2004 (2 February 2004 issue), accessed 9 January 2006; and Lerner, Michael. There Is No New Anti-Semitism, posted 5 February 2007, accessed 6 February 2007. =View that anti-Zionism leads to antisemitism= According to David Cameron, the former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, \\"there has been an insidious, creeping attempt to delegitimize the state of Israel, which spills over often into anti-Semitism.\\" In July 2001, the Simon Wiesenthal Center reported that during a visit there, German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer stated, \\"anti-Zionism inevitably leads to antisemitism.\\" In 2015, the Center observed in a newsletter introducing its report on North American campus life, that 'virulent anti-Zionism is often a thinly-veiled disguise for virulent anti-Semitism'. Conspiracy theories The antisemitic hoax The Protocols of the Elders of Zion came to be used among Arab anti-Zionists, although some have tried to discourage its usage. Antisemitic sources have claimed that The Protocols of the Elders of Zion were read at the First Zionist Congress. Neil J. Kressel asserts that for many years the line between antisemitism and anti-Zionism has been blurry. A number of conspiracies involving the Holocaust have been advanced. One advanced by the Soviets in the 1950s claims that Nazis and Zionists had a shared interest or even cooperated in the extermination of Europe's Jewry, as persecution would force them to flee to Palestine, then under British administration. Claims also have been made that the Zionist movement inflated or faked the impact of the Holocaust. The President of the State of Palestine Mahmoud Abbas wrote in his 1983 book, The Other Side: The Secret Relationship Between Nazism and Zionism based on his CandSc thesis completed in 1982 at the Moscow Institute of Oriental Studies, with Yevgeny Primakov as thesis advisor.Was Abu Mazen a Holocaust Denier? By Brynn Malone (History News Network)\\"Abu Mazen: A Political Profile. Zionism and Holocaust Denial\\" by Yael Yehoshua (MEMRI) 29 April 2003 In 1968, the East German communist paper Neues Deutschland justified the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia with the headline \\"In Prague Zionism is in power\\".Simon Wiesenthal, Justice not Vengeance, Mandarin 1989 page 207 In 1995, William Korey released a work titled Russian antisemitism, Pamyat, and the demonology of Zionism. Korey's central argument is that the Soviet Union promoted an \\"official Judeophobic propaganda campaign\\" under the guise of anti-Zionism from 1967 to 1986; after this program was shut down by Mikhail Gorbachev, a populist and chauvinist group called Pamyat emerged in the more open climate of Glasnost to promote an openly antisemitic message.William Korey, Russian antisemitism, Pamyat, and the demonology of Zionism, Routledge, 1995, pp. ix‚Äìx. Korey also argues that much official late-period Soviet antisemitism may be traced back to the influence of Protocols of the Elders of Zion. He notes, for instance, that a 1977 Soviet work titled International Zionism: History and Politics contains the allegation that most major Wall Street financial institutions are \\"large financial-industrial Jewish monopolies\\" exercising control over many countries in the world.William Korey, Russian antisemitism, Pamyat, and the demonology of Zionism, Routledge, 1995, pp. 56‚Äì57. Russian antisemitism was reviewed by Robert O. Freedman in the Slavic Review; while he concurs with the book's central thesis, Freedman nevertheless writes that the actual extent of Soviet antisemitism may have been less than Korey suggests.Robert O. Freedman, review of William Korey, Russian antisemitism, Pamyat, and the demonology of Zionism, Slavic Review, Vol. 59 no. 2 (Summer 2000), pp. 470‚Äì472. Accusations have been made regarding Zionism and the 2003 invasion of Iraq, claiming that prominent Zionists were forcing Western governments into war in the Middle East for Israel's interests.Brian Whitaker, \\"Playing skittles with Saddam. The gameplan among Washington's hawks has long been to reshape the Middle East along US- Israeli lines\\", The Guardian (3 September 2002). The Sudanese government has alleged that the Darfur uprising (in which some 500,000 have been killed) is part of a wider Zionist conspiracy. Egyptian media have alleged that the Zionist movement deliberately spreads HIV in Egypt. According to the Anti- Defamation League, Neo-Nazi and radical Muslim groups allege the U.S. government is controlled by Jews, describing it as the \\"Zionist Occupation Government\\". Article 22 of the 1988 Hamas charter claims that the French Revolution, the Russian Revolution, colonialism and both world wars were created by the Zionists or forces supportive of Zionism. Article 32 alleges that the Zionist movement seeks to create an Empire stretching from the Nile in Egypt to the Euphrates river in Iraq. In April 2010, Abd Al-Azim Al- Maghrabi, the deputy head of Egyptian Arab Lawyers Union, stated in an interview with Al-Manar TV (as translated by MEMRI) that the Hepatitis C virus was produced by \\"the Zionists\\" and \\"this virus is now spreading in Egypt like wildfire.\\" He also called for it to be \\"classified as one of the war crimes perpetrated by the Zionist enemy\\".Deputy Head of Egyptian Arab Lawyers Union Abd Al-Azim Al-Maghrabi: The Zionists Produced the Hepatitis C Virus and Injected 400 Prisoners with It, MEMRITV, Clip No. 2506, 21 April 2010. In June 2010, Egyptian cleric Mus'id Anwar gave a speech that aired on Al-Rahma TV (as translated by MEMRI) in which he alleged that the game of soccer (as well as swimming, bullfighting and tennis) was in fact a Zionist conspiracy, stating that: > As you know, the Jews, or the Zionists, have The Protocols of the Elders of > Zion.

Biography Pootoogook was born at a traditional Inuit camp called Ikerasak, near Cape Dorset, Nunavut (then in the Northwest Territories) to Josephie Pootoogook, leader of the camp, and Sarah Ningeokuluk. The family lived a traditional lifestyle hunting and trapping while living in an iglu in the winter and a sod house in the summer and did not move into their first southern style house until 1942. In 1957 Pootoogook married Shooyoo, moved to Cape Dorset and began work for James Houston. Originally, Pootoogook did some carving, made prints and lithographs for other artists. At the same time he was a leader in setting up the West Baffin Eskimo Co-operative (WBEC), the first Inuit owned co- op,West Baffin Eskimo Co-operative now part of the Arctic Co-operatives Limited and served from 1959 until 1964 as the president. Although Kananginak had worked with his father, Josephie, in 1959, it was not until the 1970s that Kananginak began work as a full-time artist producing drawings, carvings and prints. In 1977 he cut 13 original blocks for prints that were used exclusively for the first WBEC calendar that was issued in a limited edition of 500.Kanangina Cape Dorset Calendrier 1977 Calendar (1977) West Baffin Eskimo Coop Ltd.

The World Wildlife Commission released a limited edition set in 1977 that included four of Pootoogook's images and in 1980 he was elected to the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts. In 1997 Pootoogook built a inukshuk in Cape Dorset for former Governor General of Canada, Rom√©o LeBlanc. The inukshuk was dismantled and shipped to Ottawa and with the assistance of his son, Johnny, it was rebuilt at Rideau Hall and unveiled on 21 June, National Aboriginal Day.The Unveiling of an Inuksuk at Rideau Hall Pootoogook had several exhibitions and showings of his work.

It won Leo Awards and awards at Method Fest Independent Film Festival and Cinequest Film Festival. The producers are working to turn the short into a feature film. Plot A Man (Colin Cunningham) awakens one morning with a hangover to discover that he has been taken hostage aboard his old, run down trailer which is being towed down the highway by a mysterious black truck; he desperately tries to find a way out of the sealed vehicle before he burns inside. Colin Cunningham describes the movie as follows: \\"Centigrade, in a nutshell, is about a guy who lives in an old dilapidated, busted-up trailer. There's no wheels on it. It's just laying dead in the weeds. [The owner] does a bad thing, and he wakes up in the morning and [the trailer is] rolling down the highway. It's being towed by a big, black pickup truck. The doors won't open and the windows won't break and he can't get out. That's essentially what it's about. It's about a man trapped.\\" Production The part of the main character was originally to go to another actor, but difficulties forced Cunningham to take the part himself.

The church is located on the headland between Brunnsviken and Ulvsundasj√∂n, at the southern end of the cemetery Norra begravningsplatsen. The oldest parts of the church are from the later 12th century, a Romanesque fortress church built in stone. Today the church consists of a roundhouse, weaponhouse, choir, nave, sacristy, and two grave choirs. Church buildings Nave The oldest part of the church, the roundhouse, originates from the late 12th century, and was especially built for defense purposes. Attached to this round center is a weaponhouse (south), a rectangular choir to the east, and a rectangular nave to the west. North of the choir is the sacristy, and to the east an octagonal grave choir. There is a second grave choir on the south side of the nave. The roundhouse (central tower) is covered by a tall cupola, which dominates the appearance of the church. The choir was added in the 13th century. The oldest part of the nave is from the 14th century, and was extended during the 15th century, when the weaponhouse and sacristy were built. Decorations Ceiling paintings Ceiling paintings Church window Epitaph The church achieved large parts of its interior under the patronage of Magnus Gabriel de la Gardie. In 1674 the western portal was added, a sculptured portal originally constructed for Karlbergs slott in 1637, and moved to Solna church in 1674. In 1708 Queen Ulrika Eleonora commissioned a grave choir dedicated to count Tomas Polus. The roof was destroyed in a fire in 1723, and the current cupola was built after this incident. The Lange grave choir was constructed in the 1780s. In 1883 the church was given a roof of copper plates. A major restoration took place in 1928 under supervision of architect Erik Fant, when the church's medieval paintings were recovered. The medieval murals from ca. 1440 are attributed to Albertus Pictor. Altar The choir is dominated by the altar centre-piece, sculpted in wood in 1666 by Hans Jerling. The centre-piece frames two oil paintings with biblical motifs, and is crowned by a wood-sculptured Madonna from the late 16th century, while the altar is made of brick and covered by a limestone plate.

Life He was born at Springhall in Lanarkshire on 6 November 1824, the third son of William Forlong of Erines and his wife, who was the eldest daughter of General Gordon Cumming Skene of Dyce in Aberdeenshire. He joined the Indian Army in 1843 and fought in the Mahratha Campaign of 1845-46. He later filled various posts including that of Secretary and Chief Engineer to the government of Oudh. In 1858/59 he travelled extensively in Egypt, Syria and the Middle East. Exposure to Indian religions while doing missionary work led him to abandon his Christian faith, and into some very heterodox ideas about religious origins, including those of the ancient Hebrews.

Some Themes Like Payne-Knight, D‚ÄôHancarville and Hargrave Jennings he is of the phallicist school of religious anthropology. Phallic worship had two wings, the right hand, or lingam and the left hand path of the yoni worshipers, The Garden of Eden story was simply that of human generation. Eve bruised the serpent‚Äôs head and he bruised what is euphemistically called her heel. The Ark of the Covenant represented a female sex organ or yoni, and the two stones it contained signified testicles. The early Jews practiced a most crude and extreme form of phallic worship. Elohim was the same as Baal and their worship was lingamist, the Yahweh worshiping revolt against it (spearheaded by the prophets) was a pro-yoni movement, like Indian Shaktism. Christian churches are constructed on phallic principles. All these ideas are backed up with great erudition and parallels from antiquity, India and the far east.

In 1973 he co-founded the National Gay Task Force. In 1977, the now renamed National LGBTQ Task Force held the first-ever meeting at the White House with President Jimmy Carter marking the first time openly gay and lesbian leaders were welcomed there, and the first official discussion of gay and lesbian rights in the White House. Within the first few years of the AIDS pandemic Voeller coined the term acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) which we use to this day. Early life and education  Voeller was born in Minneapolis and raised in Oregon. When he was at school, he was assured by a school counselor that he was not homosexual, even though he had felt such feelings very early on. Voeller graduated with a bachelor's degree from Reed College in 1956. He was awarded a five-year fellowship to the Rockefeller Institute, and earned a Ph.D. in biology in 1961.  Career  Voeller became an associate professor at the Rockefeller Institute in 1966. Hiss research interest was in the fields of phytocytology and plant physiology. He wrote four books while there, as well as editing others' work, and writing numerous papers and articles. He married Kytja Scott Voeller, whom he met at graduate school, and they had three children. He came out at the age of 29, and divorced from his wife in 1971. After becoming president of the New York Gay Activists Alliance, he decided it was not wide enough in its coverage. Therefore, with some friends, he founded the National Gay Task Force in October 1973, and was its director until 1978. The Task Force established affiliations with more than 2000 gay groups, and by 1978 had over 10,000 members. In 1977, the National Gay Task Force (now the National LGBTQ Task Force) successfully initiated the first- ever meeting between the White House and more than a dozen gay and lesbian leaders. President Jimmy Carter‚Äôs assistant, Midge Costanza, met with Task Force co-chairs and board members as well as representatives of gay and lesbian organizations for a briefing on critical policy issues affecting this constituency. The meeting marked the first time openly gay and lesbian leaders were welcomed at the White House and the first official discussion of gay and lesbian rights in the White House. Attendees at the White House meeting included: Frank Kameny, Myra Keddell, Charles Brydon, Ray Hartman, Betty Powell, William Kelley, Troy Perry, Jean O'Leary, Elaine Noble, George Raya and Pokey Anderson. He also founded the Mariposa Foundation, which specializes in sex research, and sexually transmitted diseases. In the early 1980s, AIDS was known by various names, including GRIDD (Gay Related Immune Defense Disorder). Because this term was inaccurate, Voeller coined the term acquired immune deficiency syndrome. His partner was Richard Lucik, who was also his associate at Mariposa. Voeller died in 1994 of an AIDS related illness in California, at the age of 59. In June 2019, Voeller was one of the inaugural fifty American ‚Äúpioneers, trailblazers, and heroes‚Äù inducted on the National LGBTQ Wall of Honor within the Stonewall National Monument (SNM) in New York City‚Äôs Stonewall Inn. The SNM is the first U.S. national monument dedicated to LGBTQ rights and history, while The Wall's unveiling was timed to take place during the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots.

Although it remains very obscure and is little performed (unlike the composer's Sonata on the 94th Psalm for organ), it combines the Lisztian technique of thematic transformation, colourful harmonies, virtuosic piano writing and a wide array of characters and sentiments. The sonata was published posthumously, edited by the composer's brother, in 1871. Description The work opens with an Allegro maestoso, characterised by a dramatic, rising forte first subject. This rising motif (a minor semitone followed by a major third jump), is a significant theme of the movement, recalled at various points throughout (including the cadenza-like passagework). The main theme is built over a chordal structure of i, bII6, viio7, i4-3, v, and VI6/4. The work has other, similarly interesting modulations, presented as undecorated chordal series. The second theme, marked Quasi Recitativo is written in a free and vocal style. Its melancholy second subject, in the distant key of E major, recalls something of Reubke's own sadly short life.See score at IMSLP. See also .

Among the inhabitants of the Dima Hasao district, the Sakachep (also known as Khelma) are one of the smallest communities. The Sakachep are similar in language, customs and traditions to the Biate and Hrangkhol. They used to cremate their dead like the Vedic Hindu in the past. However, 80% of the population are Christians today. They are entirely dependent on agriculture for their livelihood.. Clans There are twelve clans in the Sakachep/Achep community. They are 1.Saithuvai(Saith) 2.Sumtinkha 3.Kholum 4\\\\. Thirsu 5.Vaichai 6.Neibom 7.Telengshing 8.Langkai 9.Kelphung 10.Thingphun(Motsun) 11.Nisatarai and 12.Zeite. Festivals The Sakachep also celebrate different festivals which are connected with the worshiping of different gods and goddess during the year. Saakthar,Rubu-khat, [Parsem-kutParsem-kut], Inmuthung and Rubuthum are such festivals. Rubuthum is the most important of all the ceremonies of the Khelmas during the time when they used to worship nature.It is believed that one have to perform the ceremony to bring peace in the family. Parsem Kut is one of the biggest festival they celebrate in the month of April. The Khelmas have a good number of folk songs for different occasions,which are generally slow tuned. Customs and traditions The traditional attire and ornaments of the Sakachep are very interesting. The women wear strings of different beads and coins around their neck. Today, majority of the young boys and girls of the villages wear pants, shirts and traditional Mekhela. The older men simply wear a Dhotidhuti. The traditional social administration of the \\"Sakachep‚Äô‚Äô is known as the Halam, which is headed by a Kalim and Kabur. In the Khelmas community, the young man has to serve his father-in-law for four years before he is allowed to take his wife home. This system is called the Maksa.

Taxonomy The species of Pseudobunocephalus were originally classified in the genus Bunocephalus, but after further study it was found that these fish were unrelated to the type species Bunocephalus verrucosus or any of the other existing aspredinid genera. Thus, a new genus was described in 2008. Pseudobunocephalus is the most basal genus in the family, and represents the sister group to all other Aspredinidae. P. lundbergi is also the most basal species and is the sister taxon to the rest of the species in the genus.  Species  There are currently six species in this genus: *Pseudobunocephalus amazonicus (Mees, 1989) *Pseudobunocephalus bifidus (C. H.

Lemon Hill is located on a bluff overlooking the Schuylkill River and Boathouse Row. Exceptional architectural features include its three oval parlors, stacked one on top of the other, with curved fireplace mantles and doors. Pratt also landscaped the property in the English landscape garden style, extended a greenhouse structure Morris had built, and opened the grounds to the public for an entry fee. Interior of south oval roomTo protect its water supply, the City of Philadelphia began purchasing properties along the Schuylkill River, beginning with Lemon Hill in 1844. The Lemon Hill estate was the first to be incorporated into the new Fairmount Park in 1855. During the second half of the 19th century, the mansion was used as a restaurant and received substantial modifications to its exterior, including a Victorian cast-iron porch. From 1926-1955, the house was used as a residence by the first director of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, Fiske Kimball, and his wife Marie Goebel Kimball. Both architectural historians, the couple restored Lemon Hill to its 1800 appearance. Kimball conjectured that Robert Morris had built the mansion; however, in 2005, Pratt's letterbooks were found at the William L. Clements Library of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor by an assistant curator of the Art Museum. Tax records indicated that the mansion did not exist at the time Pratt had purchased the land. The records also revealed that Pratt was both the designer and general contractor for his mansion. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places on February 7, 1972 as an inventoried contributing structure within Fairmount Park. Since 1957, Lemon Hill Mansion has been operated as a house museum by the Colonial Dames of America and the Friends of Lemon Hill. Long hidden by dense trees on the sides of the hill, a restoration of the historic views was undertaken in 2007, recreating the original vistas of, and from, the mansion.Lemon Hill viewscape restoration (archive) The Fairmount Park Conservancy has managed the house since 2016.

He has made numerous live appearances, roles in movies, TV shows and internet videos. Count Smokula and Smokesylvania As imagined by Miles, Count Smokula is a 496-year-old accordion-playing vampire with a cape and fez from the vaguely Eastern-European nation of Smokesylvania. He has been described as \\"Bela Lugosi-meets-Jackie Mason\\" and as \\"a sort of Yiddish Dracula, who plays the accordion and exhibits the longest tongue this side of Gene Simmons of KISS\\". The Count has a thick Smokesylvanian accent (he plays the \\"sqveezebox\\" and loves \\"to rock like you vouldn't believe it\\"). Music is his first love and the Count Smokula Orchestra started up about 300 years ago in Glipsch, Smokesylvania where he was greatly influenced by Shnotta Shmulevitz, Smokesylvania's most famous singer. But he definitely doesn't suck - as he says \\"I gave up fangs and blood 300 years ago, my doctor told me too much cholesterol\\". He subscribes to a belief in Smokulism, a \\"voild vide\\" faith revealed to the Count one sleepless night in 1997 after \\"ingesting a rather large vegetarian pizza in the presence of the Russian Madonna\\". It is a way of raising ones thoughts up from the dirt and down from the clouds to live in the world as it is, and this National Belief System of Smokesylvania can be achieved by just paying $10 for a certificate to become a true Smokulist. At an indefinite date, the Count left Smokesylvania (or rather, it left him since he tells us they moved the country stone-by-stone to the South Pacific since \\"the veather vas too inclement\\") for Hollywood, California where he planned to make a fortune as a \\"public excess show host\\" so he could restore the glory of Smokesylvania. Appearances =\\"Live\\" appearances= The Count has been a longtime regular at the annual Doo Dah Parade in Pasadena, the counter-culture answer to the more staid Rose Parade, where he is a familiar and often photographed figure. The Count is one of a number of odd characters who show up for this irreverent and wacky event - to quote him ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs got to be a bit irregular to be the true Doo Dah‚Äù and besides ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing else vorthvhile in January‚Äù He even competed for Queen a few times - a process likened to \\"a cross between the Miss America pageant and ‚ÄúThe Gong Show\\". The Count got his start in the Los Angeles underground scene, often performing at burlesque shows, so it is not surprising that he has a special affinity for burlesque and strippers. His relationship with the burlesque revival group, the Fishnet Floozys, has made him MC at a number of their shows in Los Angeles and Hollywood and hosting the \\"Count Smokula Burlesque Review\\". Or you might find him as MC for the \\"Burlesque Cabaret\\" at the Red Door Gallery in Phoenix, or as the host of Shimmy Magazine's all-star fundraiser in Los Angeles, or maybe performing at the Los Angeles Exotica Burlesque. If there are strippers around, the Count is bound to be near, even if it means trekking out to the Mojave Desert near Route 66 for the annual Miss Exotic World Pageant at the Exotic World Burlesque Museum run by former exotic dancer Dixie Evans. Count Smokula has had a long association with independent cult film producer Troma Films, creator of films such as The Toxic Avenger and Blood Sucking Freaks. As the Count has said \\"When watching a Troma movie, you must not only suspend your disbelief: you must lock it up in a small iron crate and torture it.\\" The Count has appeared several times at the TromaDance Film Festival in Park City, Utah, the camp version of the Sundance Film Festival. He also composed the Official TromaDance Theme Song introduced at TromaDance 2005. More recently, the Count was seen at the American Film Market (AFM) event in Santa Monica, California in company with Troma founder Lloyd Kaufman to celebrate the 10th anniversary of TromaDance. The appearance made the front page of the November 7, 2008 edition of The Hollywood Reporter. He has even ventured off to the U.S. Naval Station at Guantanamo where he was the Ringmaster of the Vamphear Circus in April 2006 featuring opera clown Christina Linhardt, Hillel aka Mr. Balloonman, stilt walker and fire eater Philip Solomon and aerialist Brandy Wirtz. A highlight of the show was his rendition of his own \\"Guantanamo Bay Theme Song\\". The trip is the subject of the 2013 short documentary Guantanamo Circus by Christina Linhardt and Michael L. Rose. =TV, film and the Internet= In 1996, Count Smokula got his start on underground fame with his own cult Public-access television cable TV show The Count Smokula Show (\\"the greatest talk show in the voild\\"). He also hosted the \\"Freak of the Week\\" segments for Troma's Edge TV which had guests who swallowed swords, ate fire and devoured light bulbs. A further search for such abilities led to the first international episode at the Cannes Film Festival in May 2000 with co-host Shelley Michelle. Count Smokula was also a \\"date\\" on the \\"Singers need love too\\" episode of TV show Blind Date (March 2005)Photo gallery at: and almost a superhero on the Sci Fi Channel reality show Who Wants to be a Superhero?. He didn't quite make the cut on the show's pilot episode (July 2006). As a film actor, the Count has appeared in some memorably named flicks including the 2004 epic Tales from the Crapper (filmed in three countries, over three years, with six directors, 15 writers, and a cast of hundreds) with Julie Strain. and the \\"Coming Soon\\" Curse of the Black Pussycat starring Rena Riffel. It is on the Internet that the Count really shines. With YouTube and other video services, the Internet has become the modern era's version of vaudeville and Count Smokula is a classic vaudeville persona. A recent search of YouTube videos shows 71 listings for The Count. One of his videos, \\"Count Smokula - Zombie\\", has over 50,000 views, and his political satire \\"Sarah Palin in 'Moose on the loose'\\" may end up with even more. Music Count Smokula is a musician and singer, and as such has hosted and performed at the Rock City News Music Awards for many years He was also one of the \\"three days of accordions\\" performers at the 2008 Los Angeles Accordion Festival. And he is most likely the oldest member of the Rockabilly Hall of Fame. As a songwriter, Count Smokula has composed the soundtracks for Troma Entertainment movies All the Love You Cannes! (2002) and Tales from the Crapper (2004) as well as the 2006 classics Vampira: The Movie and Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead. At the 13th Annual Los Angeles Music Awards in 2003, the Count was given the award for Comedy Album of the Year for his CD Authentic Sounds of Smokesylvania.

While their dimensions, material and specifics vary from model to model, a kneeboard, by definition, includes the following components: * flat plate, approximately 4 to 6 inches in width, 8 to 11 inches in length. * an elastic strap, attached to the plate, to hold fast to the pilot's upper thigh. * a binder clip, mounted to the plate, for holding items. Models vary from a small clipboard with thigh straps to more elaborate designs with multiple panels that fold much like a wallet (usually with a means to hold the folded board closed such as a snap or velcro.) As the kneeboard is designed to keep flight- pertinent information close at hand, it may have charts and information (such as IFR references) printed directly on it, or include pockets and clips to hold maps, approach plates, and aids to calculation such as the E6B Flight Computer.

QARs are typically used by airlines to improve flight safety and operational efficiency, usually in the scope of their flight operational quality assurance plans. Like the aircraft's flight data recorder (FDR), a QAR receives its inputs from the Flight Data Acquisition Unit (FDAU), recording over 2000 flight parameters. The QAR is also able to sample data at much higher rates than the FDR and, in some cases, for longer periods of time. Unlike the FDR, the QAR usually is not required by a national Civil Aviation Authority on commercial flights and is not designed to survive an accident. Despite this, some QARs have survived accidents and provided valuable information beyond what was recorded by the FDR. The quick access recorder was pioneered by British European Airways (BEA) on its Hawker Siddeley Trident aircraft in the 1960s as a requirement to prove the safety of the aircraft's autoland system for certification of the autoland system by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). Quick access recorders are carried by all BEA's successor airline, British Airways (BA), aircraft. Data from the Penny & Giles quick access recorder of a BA Boeing 747-400 London-Bangkok flight in which the aircraft suffered un-commanded elevator movement and momentary elevator reversal caused Boeing to implement a change in the elevator servo valve design, a modification that was applied to all Boeing 747s in service, and suspicion of a similar original valve design arising from this BA data was subsequently used by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) in the determining of the causes of the crashes of United Airlines Flight 585 and USAir Flight 427.Equinox - \\"The Box\\", Channel 4, 2001. Earlier, data from a Trident's quick access recorder had provided the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) with useful supplemental data over-and-above that of the aircraft's flight data recorder that helped the diagnosing of the cause of the 1972 British European Airways Flight 548, the \\"Staines air disaster\\" where the Trident's leading edge droop flaps had been retracted too early and at too low an airspeed.

Munalbro was built as a collier by the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company at Newport News, Virginia, in 1916, and went into commercial service with Munson Steamship Lines as SS Munalbro. In September 1917 Munalbro was chartered by the United States Army, and by December 1917 she had been armed. On 12 May 1918 she was in a convoy on a crossing from New York City to Plymouth, England, when the U.S. Navy cargo ship USS Zaanland (ID-2746) suffered a rudder casualty that evening, went off course, and was rammed by the U.S. Navy tanker USS Hisko (ID-1953). While the convoy continued on its way, Munalbro stood by the mortally damaged Zaanland‚Äîwhich sank the next morning‚Äîand took off her crew. Munalbro then set off to catch up with the convoy. Along the way she encountered the westward-bound merchant ship SS Minnesota and transferred the crew of Zaanland to Minnesota for transportation back to the United States. The U.S. Navy acquired Munalbro from Munson Steamship Lines for World War I service as a cargo ship on 17 September 1918 and commissioned her as USS Munalbro at Newport News the same day with Lieutenant Commander F. E. Cross, USNRF, in command. Unlike many of the former merchant ships the Navy acquired in 1917 and 1918 for use in the war, Munalbro did not receive a Navy identification number (Id. No.). Assigned to the Naval Overseas Transportation Service (NOTS), Munalbro joined a convoy at New York City bound for Europe on 26 September 1918. She arrived at La Pallice, France, on 13 October 1918 to discharge part of her U.S. Army general cargo and continued on to St. Nazaire, Nantes, and Quiberon. She departed Quiberon 1 November 1918 for the United States East Coast and arrived at Norfolk, Virginia, on 22 November 1918. On 12 December 1918 Munalbro made a second crossing to Quiberon, where she arrived in January 1919, again carrying general U.S. Army supplies. In February 1919 she departed Nantes with another U.S. Army cargo, returning to New York on 1 March 1919. On 21 March 1919 Munalbro decommissioned and was delivered to the United States Shipping Board for simultaneous return to Munson Steamship Lines. She returned to mercantile service as SS Munalbro. Boston enterprise Eastern Gas And Fuel purchased the steamship, and in 1936 her name was changed to SS James L. Richards on behalf of longtime EG&F; director James Lorin Richards. Her subsequent commercial service extended for three and a half decades and she was scrapped in 1954.
