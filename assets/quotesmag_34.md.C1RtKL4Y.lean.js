The adult fly is primarily black with a yellow face and thin white stripes on the abdomen. It is commonly found along the east coast of the United States and is often found near flowering plants. P. tibialis flies parasitize many different species of bees by laying their eggs inside the abdomen of their host. The larva hatches inside of the host and grows and develops until it takes up the majority of the host's abdomen. The host then dies and the larva envelopes itself in a puparium and pupates inside of the corpse. After an extended period of pupation, the adult emerges from the corpse of the host bee. When a bee becomes parasitized by a P. tibialis larva, certain behaviors such as induced grave digging and changes in flower preference often occur. Geographic distribution P. tibialis is found in North America, primarily along the east coast of the United States. They can be seen as far north as Massachusetts and as south as Florida. They have also been seen as far west as Wisconsin and Texas. Habitat P. tibialis can often be found near flowering plants, likely due to the presence of host species pollinating nearby plants. They have not been seen to prefer specific species of plants, and attack host species at a variety of different flowering plants. Physical description =Larva/pupa= The larva is white and swollen when it hatches from the egg and molts three times until it reaches its fully grown size of around 30‚Äì60 mm in length. The pupa is sclerotized and brown in color. It is long and ovular in shape, and around 30‚Äì50 mm in length. alt= = Adult = The adult P. tibialis is characterized by an almost entirely black abdomen and pale tarsal segments on the legs. Thin stripes of white are visible on the abdominal segments. The wings of P. tibialis are brown in color with the brown emanating from a completely dark colored discal cell to outside the limits of the great cross vein. The lateral areas of the head are light yellow, and the segment connecting each half of the face is black. The cheeks of P. tibialis are black with no speckling. Flies from the family Conopidae have thick ptilina, sacks on the head that can be inflated to break through the puparium wall. The ptilinum of P. tibialis contains numerous sclerotised scales, which help with eclosion from the host and digging behavior. Life cycle The growth and development of P. tibialis is fairly unique in that a single egg is laid inside of a Hymenopteran host. After hatching, the larva parasitizes the nutrients of the host in order to grow and develop through three instar stages. The host eventually dies and the larva then pupates inside of the corpse until its emergence as an adult fly. =Larval stage= P. tibialis flies, along with a few other Conopidae species, lay their eggs inside bees and wasps (order: Hymenoptera). The larva has a white and bulging appearance right after it emerges from the egg around one to two days after it is laid. It uses its pointed, extendable mouth to rupture the egg. The larva then goes through 3 instar stages, molting between each stage. During the first two instar stages, the larva feeds on the hemolymph of the host. In the third instar stage, the larva primarily feeds on the intestinal tissue of the host. The first and second instar phases last between two and three days each, and the third instar phase lasts around four to five days. This entire development period of about 10‚Äì12 days takes place within the abdomen of the host. The larva is around 30‚Äì60 mm long when fully grown. =Pupal stage= Once the larva has reached near full development, the host dies, and the larva then encapsulates itself in a puparium within the host corpse. The pupa is around 30‚Äì50 mm in length, brown in color, and has a prolonged ovular shape. This life stage is often referred to as overwintering because the pupal period takes place for an extended period of time (154‚Äì190 days), generally throughout the colder months of the year. Food resources =Larvae= P. tibialis remains enclosed in its Hymenopteran host for the entire larval stage of development. During the first and second instar stages, the larva primarily consumes the hemolymph of the host for nutrients. During the third instar stage, the larva begins to consume the intestinal tissue of the host. Parental Care =Oviposition= Physocephala tibialis female P. tibialis females can often be found near the base of flowering plants anticipating the arrival of host species. The females attack hosts during foraging periods and insert an egg into their abdomen. The female penetrates an intersegmental membrane on the host in order to gain access to the abdominal cavity. Parasitic behaviors =Induced grave digging in host= When a Hymenopteran is infected with P. tibialis, the bee/wasp will often bury itself in the soil before dying. This offers no benefit for the host as it is close to nearly inevitable death. P. tibialis adaptively manipulates this behavior in the Hymenopteran in order to benefit itself, allowing the P. tibialis larva to be isolated from predators as well as protect themselves from environmental factors. However, the mechanism of this manipulation is currently unknown. Flies who emerged from underground were on average larger, heavier, and less likely to have non-functional or malformed wings than flies who emerged at ground level. P. tibialis larvae have different likelihoods of inducing self- burial behavior depending on the species of the Hymenopteran host. =Host response to parasite= alt= Different species of bee respond differently to being infected by P.tibialis. Almost 70% of common eastern bumblebees respond to the infection by digging their own grave, while only 18% of brown-belted bumblebees respond in the same manner. Host insects possess defenses that prevent P. tibialis from implanting them with eggs. If this defense fails, their immune system can sometimes destroy the developing larvae. These species-dependent defense mechanisms forces the parasite P. tibialis to become specific in its target host. =Flower choice alterations in host= Bumblebee hosts often choose to pollinate different selections of flower species after being parasitized by P. tibialis. In one study, it was found that parasitized hosts often pollinated flowers other than those from dominant species in the area. Parasitized bees were also seen to be more sporadic in their flower choices. The mechanism and rationale behind this change in flower choice is currently undetermined. =Eclosion= After the pupal stage of the fly is complete, the adult first uses its mouthparts and ptilinum to rupture the puparium. Then the fly fully inflates its ptilinum until it is around the same size as its head and ecloses from the corpse of its Hymenopteran host. The large size of the ptilinum as well as the sclerotized scales help to rupture the exoskeleton of the corpse. The fly then rhythmically inflates and deflates the ptilinum to continue maneuvering its way out, using its mouthparts and legs as leverage to pry itself from the corpse. Because of the induced grave digging behavior in the Hymenopteran hosts, the newly emerged fly also uses its ptilinum, mouthparts, and legs to dig up to ground level.

The game was revealed in February 1999 at an arcade trade show in Japan alongside several other games to promote Sega's new arcade board. Gun Beat was not playable, but a gameplay video was on display. The demo reel was well received by critics who felt the game carried the same quirky characteristics and quality artwork of previous Treasure offerings. Development on the game was ceased indefinitely in May 2000 with little explanation. Treasure hatched the initial idea for Gun Beat when the NAOMI arcade board was revealed. The team looked to Wacky Races for inspiration to develop a disjointed and slapstick action- racing game. The game features players racing against each other while also having the ability to fire shots capable of slowing down rival players and destroying traps and enemies littered across the race course. It supports up to four players competing across locally connected cabinets.  Gameplay  Cunyanya racing through a stage Gun Beat was billed as an \\"action-racing\\" game for arcades. The goal of the game is to complete a race while destroying enemies and obstacles on the course. There are three modes: a single-player race, a score attack mode, and a versus mode. In the versus mode, up to four players can compete across four arcade cabinets linked locally to each other. Each player can choose one of four characters: Carmine, Mirabelle, Squad-Man, and Cunyanya. Carmine drives a hover bike, Mirabelle rides a witch's broom, Squad-Man is a biped robot that can fly and run, and Cunyanya is a young boy riding atop a giant Siberian flying squirrel. Each character can only be picked by one player, and each has its own unique characteristics such as handling, shot power, size, etc.. Only three stage concepts were ever shown: a city, a snowy mountain, and ancient ruins. Player can use various shot types to destroy enemies and traps obstructing the course, and slow down rival players. There are also power-ups on the courses. Other than the standard shot there is also a Magical Shot and the Beat Gun. The Magical Shot fires many projectiles at a wide range, and the Beat Gun is short range but powerful and can destroy enemies and obstacles unaffected by standard bullets. There is also a Magical Turbo gauge that when filled up, can boost the player through the course for five seconds, destroying any enemies or obstacles in their path. The gauge increases if the player hits an enemy, but decreases if they are hit themselves. Attacks become more powerful as a race goes on, so it is very possible for players to overtake each other towards the end of the race. Some of the enemies are larger and treated more like bosses. All enemy models are segmented into different appendages, with one segment being the \\"core\\". If an enemy's core is destroyed, the whole enemy is defeated, and the player gets a bonus based on how many other segments were remaining. Shots can be chained into combos for bonus points as well. In addition, players earn bonuses based on their rank and remaining time at the end of race, and also how many obstacles they destroyed. Each course has checkpoints that extend the player's remaining time if passed. If time runs out, it is game over.  History  = Development = Gun Beat was to be Treasure's second arcade game after Radiant Silvergun (1998) and their first for the Sega NAOMI arcade board. The idea for the game came when the NAOMI board was unveiled. Their idea could not be realized with current hardware, so the NAOMI board arrived at an opportune time. Sega's new arcade board allowed them to develop the race tracks as they envisioned them, with four player models along with enemies moving smoothly across a fully polygonal race track. The initial concept was to make a disjointed and slapstick racing game in the likeness of Wacky Races. They also held a concept from the beginning to make it unlike previous Treasure games. Once they established the racing elements, they added action, which at first was only punching and kicking. A programmer then thought of using shooting mechanics instead. Music was being composed by Norio Hanzawa, who had written music for some of Treasure's previous games. The characters and artwork were designed by staff artist Kiyotaka Ohashi. The team decided on four characters because any more would cause frame rate slowdown, and any less was deemed too lonely. The characters were designed to appear from different works, wearing different clothes and using different vehicles. The character Carmine was designed as an ideal Treasure hero, a stark contrast from the other more fantastical characters. Mirabelle was given a long skirt because they felt a short skirt would appear too shameless. Squad-Man's design was based on \\"Treasure Man\\", a character that appeared in Mega Drive Magazine comics. = Promotion = This video of Gun Beat was captured at the AOU trade show by Japanese arcade gaming site Amusement Graffiti. It is the only known footage of the game.Gun Beat was revealed on 17 February 1999 at the AOU (Arcade Operators Union) Amusement Expo at the Makuhari Messe convention center in Tokyo. It was not playable at the trade show, but a gameplay video could be seen at one of Sega's booths. Sega was demonstrating it alongside several other games to promote their NAOMI arcade board including Crazy Taxi (1999), Zombie Revenge (1999), and F355 Challenge (1999) among others. The game was only 10% complete at the time, and no release date was revealed. Treasure did not confirm whether a Dreamcast port was in development or not, but with the track record of NAOMI games commonly being ported to the Dreamcast, critics expected Gun Beat to follow in kind. Critics shared their thoughts based on the gameplay video shown at the 1999 AOU trade event. IGN wrote that it looked \\"brilliant\\", and described it as \\"bizarre\\" and \\"very silly\\". They compared the gameplay to Bomberman Fantasy Race (1998), but believed Gun Beat would surpass it with better graphics, larger characters, faster speed, and quirky qualities characteristic of Treasure. They compared the flashy explosion effects to the Virtual On series. French publication ' felt the game held testament to Treasure's ability in developing intense and original action titles. Chris Johnston of GameSpot advised readers to not write off the game as \\"cartoony\\" like Pen Pen TriIcelon (1998), but a more mature game with high quality Treasure artwork. Gamers' Republic believed the game showed promise. = Cancellation = In May 2000, Treasure announced they had ceased development of Gun Beat indefinitely until \\"conditions are satisfactory\\". The announcement was posted on their website along with a notice asking fans to look forward to another project they were still developing and had yet announced. The cancellation did not come as a surprise to IGN. According to GameSpot, the lead producer of the game had left Treasure a few months previously. They suspected his absence had placed a damper on the project.

He graduated from the Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet under Alexander Ivanovich Pushkin and went on to become a choreographer, working with some of the Soviet Unions most important ballet companies, including the Kirov Ballet and the Bolshoi Ballet. In the early 1970s he was artistic director and chief choreographer at the Maly Theatre Ballet, and became artistic director of the Kirov Ballet in 1977. During this period, relations between the Soviet Union and the United States grew warmer, and the Kirov Ballet embarked on several US tours for the first time in decades. Vinogradov became the first Soviet ballet master to invite Maurice B√©jart and Roland Petit to stage works for the Kirov, and also helped to bring authorized productions of George Balanchines ballets to Russia for the first time. He was named a People's Artist of the USSR in 1983. Early career Oleg Vinogradov was born in Leningrad on 1 August 1937. At the age of 20 he graduated from the Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet, then called the Leningrad Choreographic School, where he studied under Aleksandr Pushkin. Between 1958 and 1965, Vinogradov was a character dancer with a company in Novosibirsk. He later began choreographing short ballet scenes for operas. He staged several ballets as an assistant ballet master to Pyotr Gusev, including Prokofievs Cinderella and Romeo and Juliet in 1964 and 1965 respectively. His first two stagings of classic Prokofiev ballets were well-received in Russia and he was invited to stage two productions for Russia's largest ballet companies: the Bolshoi Ballet and the Kirov Ballet. In 1967, he staged a relatively unknown ballet called Asel, with music by Vladimir Vlasov, for the Bolshoi, and in 1968 he staged Goryanka for the Kirov. He received a position with the Kirov as a choreographer and in 1973 he became the artistic director and chief choreographer of the Maly Theatre Ballet. Artistic director of Kirov Ballet When Vinogradov became artistic director of the Kirov Ballet in 1977, he fired over half the dancers at the company, and hired younger dancers. Also in 1977, Vinogradov restaged Adams Giselle. He said he tried to \\"return to Petipas original conception, and to remove the numerous superfluous elements and distortions that have crept in\\". He worked on this ballet with Soviet historian Yuri Slonimsky who, according to Vinogradov, had access to Petipas original scores which he says made it possible to \\"rectify many mistakes\\". In 1986 the company performed in the United States for the first time in 22 years, during a period of thawing relations between the US and Soviet Union. Natalia Makarova, who had defected from the Kirov in 1970, was allowed to dance with the Russian company again, and Russian dancers were able to make appearances with leading companies in the United States. Under Mikhail Gorbachovs relaxed policies, Vinogradov could make independent decisions about the company's repertoire (in the past the repertoire had to be approved by a committee). The company toured with only 39 dancers in 1987, performing excerpts rather than full-length ballets. The choreographers represented on this tour included Boris Eifmann, Dmitry Bryantsev and an excerpt from B√©jarts Notre Faust. During their 1989 tour of the United States, the Kirov performed a wide range of classical and contemporary works including Le Corsaire, Tchaikovsky's The Sleeping Beauty, and Paquita (with music by Ludwig Minkus). They also performed an original ballet by Vinogradov called Battleship Potemkin and two ballets choreographed by George Balanchine: Scotch Symphony and Theme and Variations. The Kirov Ballet had never performed any Balanchine ballets prior to 1989. The Balanchine Trust only allows Balanchines works to be performed when the staging is supervised by a ballet master who has been trained in the \\"Balanchine style\\". Vinogradov helped bring authorized productions of Balanchines ballets to Russia for the first time. Vinogradov also became the first Soviet ballet master to invite Maurice B√©jart and Roland Petit to stage works for the Kirov. In 1991, the Washington Post wrote that the company had begun to \\"free itself of its Communist shackles\\" and \\"open its doors to Western artists and influences\\". Regarding the challenges that Antony Tudors choreography had presented for the Russian ballet dancers, Vinogradov said that \\"Tudor is more difficult for our dancers than even Balanchine. ... Tudor's plastic, impulsive, off-balance approach to the upper torso, head and arms is more problematic for us.\\" He remarked that he had been particularly impressed by Lupe Serranos dancing in Tudor's Lilac Garden\\". By 1991 the company roster had declined from 21 principal dancers to only 10, and several well-known dancers were no longer dancing with the company, including Farukh Ruzimatov, Galina Mezentseva and Yelena Pankova. When the Kirov toured the US that year Andris Liepa, Veronika Ivanova and Igor Zelensky were among the new additions to the company's ranks. The Kirov Ballet School The Kirov Ballet School, also called the Universal Ballet Academy, opened in Washington DC in 1990. The Gorbachov era policy of glasnost made it possible for Vinogradov to retain his position as artistic director of the Kirov Ballet in Russia, and also spend four months per year in the United States to serve as director of UBA. Though not a teacher at the school himself, Vinogradov appointed four Russian teachers to teach a curriculum based on the Russian Vaganova syllabus: Ludmila Sakharova, Nikolai Morozov, Ludmilla Morkovina and Azari Plissetski. Post-Kirov Vinogradov's style of directorship proved controversial and in 1997 Valery Gergiev took over directorship of the ballet theatre. In 1998 Vinogradov became director of the Universal Ballet in Seoul, as well as the Kirov Ballet School in Washington DC, and he has staged some productions such as La Fille mal gard√©e for the Stanislavsky Ballet. He left Seoul Ballet in 2008 to join the Mikhailovsky Ballet as an associate choreographer. Recent Years Vinogradov continues to teach and choreograph. He has been a guest teacher and choreographer at the International Youth Ballet Festival, in conjunction with Classical Dance Alliance, run by ballet pedagogue, Janet L Springer.

M. bomboides is a noteworthy instance of Batesian mimicry given its close resemblance to its prey, the bumblebee. These bees are typically found in the Eastern and Southern regions of the United States like South Carolina and Florida.  Physical description  M. bomboides typically have three basal abdominal tergites densely covered with yellow hairs. The fourth and fifth tergites have black hairs, and the final two segments have pale hairs. The ventrum of the abdomen is adorned with yellow hairs. The average body length of M. bomboides is about 25 mm.  Distribution  = Geographical distribution = M. bomboides occurs in the southeastern United States in states including North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, and Mississippi. = Phenology = Flight time in Florida is from April through December, though they are most commonly seen in late summer. = Habitat = Adults typically live in open habitats often in the vicinity of apiaries, perching on stalks of weeds or tips of shrubs from which they launch their attacks.  Life Cycle  = Larva = Specific feeding habits of larvae of M. bomboides are unknown, but other Mallophora larvae are ectoparasites on scarabaeid beetle larvae in the soil. = Adult = Adults live in open habitats near apiaries. They perch vertically angled on plants from which they launch their attacks on their bumblebee prey.  Mimicry  = History = The similar appearances of some flies and bees have been noted since the time of Aristotle. In fact, in these ancient times, the confusion between the two insects led to the disproven notion that bees undergo spontaneous generation from decaying carcasses. British entomologists William Kirby and William Spence first theorized in 1817 that flies gained an advantage by resembling bees, reasoning that the physical similarity of hoverflies from genus Volucella to bumblebees enabled the invasion of bee nests. Having entered the bee nests without arousing suspicion, the flies then lay eggs and depart without being attacked. The same idea was later put forth by British naturalist Alfred Russell Wallace in 1871.  Initial classification  Classifying categories of mimicry in 1890, Edward Bagnell Poulton placed this into the category of aggressive mimicry, a deceptive mechanism in which one species resembles another in order to approach it without arousing suspicion to carry out a detrimental end. However, Gregory Bateson criticized this view in 1892 by pointing out that the Volucella example fits much better as an instance of protective mimicry, now commonly known as Batesian mimicry. By appearing as bees, palatable flies gain protection from predators that recognize bees as noxious and therefore unappetizing. Bateson argued with the counterexamples that Volucella females entered bumblebee nests belonging to species that they did not mimic and that a European species with similar habits actually benefited the host because the fly larvae, once hatched, acted as scavengers inside the nest. = Reclassification = In the same paper in which he discussed aggressive mimicry in order to account for Volucella appearances, Poulton also discussed family Asilidae flies that prey upon aculeate Hymenoptera as adults. M. bomboides bear a highly specific resemblance to their prey, which Poulton classified as protective mimicry. However, Lincoln Brower et al. demonstrated in 1960 that this phenomenon was, in fact, Batesian mimicry. = Aggressive mimicry = Adult M. bomboides prey on bumblebees, their mimetic models, to a great extent. Though their attacks are swift, it is possible that the resemblance of the fly to the prey and mode enhances the likelihood of its success. The same argument for aggressive mimicry in Volucella flies could apply in M. bomboides. Consistent with other members of the family Asilidae, larvae are thought to be predaceous, feeding on soft-bodied insects in the soil. In terms of aggressive mimicry, the female flies of M. bomboides may enter into bumblebee nests to lay eggs. Due to their mimetic resemblance, M. bomboides females could then escape recognition and attack. Once hatched, the fly larvae could consume bumblebee larvae as a food source. However, all this is merely speculative and further experimentation will help elucidate the validity of this model. = Batesian mimicry = Batesian vs. M√ºllerian Mimicry Experiments conducted by Brower et al. demonstrate that M. bomboides is a Batesian mimic of its bumblebee model and prey, B. americanorum (now more commonly known as Bombus pensylvanicus), which is noxious to predators such as the toad Bufo terretris due to its sting. In a 1921 experiment by Geoffrey Douglas Hale Carpenter, one monkey ate a wasp-like asilid presented to it with caution and another rejected the asilid as food altogether. However, the second monkey was willing to eat a non-mimetic asilid, suggesting that the first asilid is a true Batesian mimic. In other words, mimicry of an unpalatable species will lend species such as M. bomboides a form of protection from predators who have learned their lesson from an unpleasant previous attempt. In another experiment by Lloyd Morgan in 1896, it was discovered that a moorhen chick that had eaten and presumably been stung by a bumblebee rejected future offers of bumblebees, even with removed stings, as well as mimetic drone flies. An inexperienced chick was willing to accept these as food. In addition to supporting the hypothesis for Batesian mimicry, this experiment suggests that the noxious quality of the bumblebees is their sting. This was further supported by a series of feeding experiments conducted using toads and bees by Hugh B. Cott in 1936.  Requirements  In order that Batesian mimicry should evolve and remain an evolutionarily stable strategy, several prerequisites are deemed necessary. # Prospective models and mimics must occur together. # Models must outnumber mimics. # Models must possess a noxious and advertise this by means of conspicuous coloration. For mimetic asilids like M. bomboides, these organisms attack their aculeate Hymenoptera models and will seek habitats abundant in their prey, thereby ensuring sympatry. All these conditions hold for the M. bomboides with their models, B. americanorum in a 1960 conducted by Brower et al. in south central Florida. The toad B. terrestris was used as caged predators to demonstrate that, despite their night foraging and lack of color vision, they can learn to reject bumblebees on sight alone and confuse mimetic flies with their apian hosts as well.  Diet  Example of Asilidae As a member of the family Asilidae, M. bomboides preys on various aculeate Hymenoptera species. M. bomboides in particular prey on bumblebees such as Bombus pensylvanicus, to which M. bomboides bears remarkable resemblances.  Reproduction  M. bomboides lay their eggs in soil.  Economic importance  There are few instances of financials losses to beekeepers due to depredations of bee killers such as M. bomboides, but Florida is one of a few states where such losses have been reported as noteworthy. Little Lake City experienced an attack of over hundreds of these insects against bee hives in July 2008.

Created by executive producers Greg Berlanti, Ali Adler, and Andrew Kreisberg, the character was introduced in the pilot episode as the elder adoptive sister of protagonist Kara Danvers / Supergirl. Alex is a bioengineer, physician, scientist and a field agent of the DEO, a secret government agency that works to protect the Earth from extraterrestrial threats. She later becomes the director of the organization at the end of season three, after having been J'onn's second-in-command for years, and remains so through season five. Alex is also featured in the show's digital tie-in comic book series, Adventures of Supergirl, as well as the 2017 four-part Arrowverse crossover event \\"Crisis on Earth-X\\", with Leigh reprising her role across Arrow, The Flash, and Legends of Tomorrow. Both the character and Leigh's performance have been well received by critics and fans alike. The relationship between the Danvers sisters and Alex's coming out storyline have garnered particular praise.  Background  Alex Danvers is the only biological child of scientists Eliza and Jeremiah Danvers. When Alex was a teenager, her parents adopted an orphaned Kara Zor-El and they grew up together in the town of Midvale. Although Alex was an exceptional student, particularly in science, she couldn't help but envy her Kryptonian sister's alien abilities. Alex was relieved when Kara decided not to use her powers, but still felt embarrassed by her alien behavior. Nonetheless, as the older sister figure, Alex felt protective of Kara and sympathy for her losses and displacement. At some point, Kara took a reluctant Alex flying through the night and they were spotted by the Department of Extranormal Operations (DEO), a secret government agency tasked with monitoring alien presence on Earth. Unbeknownst to the young girls, Jeremiah agreed to work for the organization under Hank Henshaw instead of letting them take Kara away. Suffering the loss of her father, among other factors, caused Alex to excessively drink and party as a young adult. Nonetheless, she managed to earn her dual doctoral degree (Ph.D.) and (M.D.) before being recruited into the DEO herself by Henshaw (later revealed to be J'onn J'onzz, who promised Jeremiah that he'd look after his daughters). In season three, it is revealed that at some point in the past she was a practicing doctor, and worked at a hospital in Seattle.  Storylines  = Season 1 = At the start of the series, Kara is initially unaware of her sister's true occupation. Alex reveals herself to Kara as well as the existence of the DEO after Kara saves Alex from a near plane crash and decides to become a superhero like her cousin Clark Kent / Superman. She is also Hank Henshaw's trusted right-hand operative. Alex is tasked with training Kara in combat and provides her with a Fortress of Solitude -esque room with a projection of Kara's mother, Alura. Alex, J'onn, and the rest of the DEO work alongside Kara, dubbed \\"Supergirl\\" by the press, to put away dangerous alien criminals who have escaped from the Fort Rozz prison spaceship, including Alura's identical twin and Kara's aunt, Astra.Alex puts on a suit with kryptonite lacing and fatally stabs Astra with a kryptonite sword. Jonn took the blame for Astra's death, because he didn't want Alex to lose her sister. However, Alex felt guilty and although she knew she could lose her sister with her confession, she told Kara, against Jonn's will, that she had killed Astra in self-defense, and not Jonn. She explained that she had no choice since Astra wanted to kill Jonn and apologized, crying bitterly to her. At first it looked like Kara was running away and couldn't forgive Alex, but she finally hugged and comforted her, showing that she had accepted her sister's apology.\\" = Season 2 = While continuing her work at the DEO, Alex crosses paths with National City Science Police officer Detective Maggie Sawyer. The two initially come into conflict over work, but quickly form a flirtatious friendship and Alex begins to develop feelings for her. That forces Alex to again confront her homosexuality, and her true feelings that she suppressed since her youth. Again Alex denies that she is a lesbian, but after a long conversation with Maggie, she finally admits it to herself for the first time. Maggie therefore encourages her to stand by her sexual orientation and to tell her family. After a few days Alex finally gathers up all her courage and manages to comes out to Kara. Her sister is at first a bit shocked about it, but has absolutely no problem with this and has been supporting her ever since, just like her mother and friends who were told about it after Kara. So Alex comes out as gay at the age of 28 and enters into a relationship with Maggie. They become engaged in the season finale. Alex also learns of her father Jeremiah's mysterious survival and ambiguous partnership with the anti- alien organization Project Cadmus. = Season 3 = As Alex and Maggie prepare to get married, Alex discovers that Maggie does not ever want kids. Alex, realizing that she does want kids someday, breaks up with Maggie and they reluctantly go their separate ways. In the aftermath of the breakup, Kara invites Alex to her friend Barry Allen's wedding on Earth-1, where she ends up having a one night stand with Legends of Tomorrow's Sara Lance (Caity Lotz) ,both are soon forced to fight off an invasion of Nazis from a parallel Earth together. After the defeat of Reign, J'onn steps down and promotes Alex to Director of the DEO. = Season 4 = Following her promotion to director of the DEO, Alex struggles with her new role, and her organization deals with a new wave of anti-extraterrestrial bigotry within the country. United States Marine Corps colonel Lauren Haley is brought in by the president to supervise Alex, and is determined to discover Supergirl's civilian identity. To protect Kara from Haley, Alex has J'onn wipe her memory of her knowing that her sister is Supergirl. Alex continues to maintain a cordial relationship with Kara, but becomes hostile towards Supergirl, not knowing they are the same person. Alex remembers that Kara is Supergirl, and manages to revive her when she is nearly killed by Red Daughter. Following the defeat of Lex Luthor, who had been orchestrating all the anti-extraterrestrial bigotry, Alex develops a romantic relationship with Kelly Olsen. = Season 5 = In season 5, Alex assists in the investigation of Leviathan. Following the Crisis which led to the creation of Earth-Prime, Alex is now the director of the DEO, which is now owned by LuthorCorp. She was surprised at that when J'onn restored her memories. Alex later resigns from the DEO, unable to face her superior Luthor, resulting in Querl Dox succeeding her as director. After receiving news that her father died, Alex is reluctant to attend his funeral and uses the Obsidian lens to do a Supergirl fantasy that starts to affect her alongside the others that indulge in it. With help from Obsidian CEO Andrea Rojas, Kelly is able to get Alex out using a VR version of her younger self. Afterwards, Alex goes to Midvale to attend her father's funeral.  Other versions  In season 4, John Deegan, a mad psychiatrist who works at Earth-1's Arkham Asylum, uses the Book of Destiny to rewrite reality on his Earth; in this new reality, Alex's Earth-1 counterpart is working for him. This Alex is intrigued to learn of her Earth-38 counterpart's life after Kara reveals herself as the adoptive sister of her Earth's Alex. She helps Kara escape from Deegan and this reality is undone by the combined efforts of Kara, Oliver Queen, Barry Allen, and Clark Kent.  Concept and creation  In February 2015, actress Chyler Leigh was cast as Alexandra \\"Alex\\" Danvers, initially described as Kara's \\"confident foster sister whose fascination with her sibling's powers inspired her to become a doctor.\\" The character is an original creation for Supergirl, not based on any existing character appearing in DC Comics. Jordan Mazarati portrayed the 2003 version of the character, and Olivia Nikkanen portrayed the 2007 version.  Skills and abilities  Alex Danvers has no inherent superhuman powers; rather, she is highly intelligent, trained in various forms of martial arts, and has been shown to capably wield any weapon. She is also an excellent physician and bio-engineer, and has furthermore extensive expertise in marksmanship, hand-to-hand combat, and extraterrestrial physiology, besides being a far-reaching skilled scientist and military tactician. During season 3, Alex is given a new protective suit by Winn Schott. This one is more armor-like than her usual DEO suit and offers more protection for the body than the other one before. In addition to that, she has magnetic gloves now which allow her to retrieve any dropped weapon, and her Maaldorian laser pistol that she has taken away from a deceased alien during a rescue mission on Maaldoria was also upgraded and can shoot Kryptonite bullets now.  Reception  Both the character and Leigh's performance have been well received by critics and fans alike. The relationship between the Danvers sisters and Alex's coming out storyline in the second season have garnered particular praise. Kara and Alex were named as one of \\"The 10 Greatest Ride or Die TV Siblings\\" by TV Guide's Keisha Hatchett, who stated: \\"These two might not come from the same species, but their unconditional love for each other proves that you don't need to share the same blood in order to be sisters. Both have helped each other through a difficult journey to self-acceptance [...] in a fierce display of sisterhood that keeps us coming back each week.\\" Estelle Tang of Elle described Alex's coming-out journey as \\"nuanced, remarkably moving, and believable reckoning of an adult woman coming to terms with something she had never consciously known about herself.\\" Supergirl received a nomination for Outstanding Drama Series at the 2017 GLAAD Awards, which recognizes LGBT representation in the media.

Collection of Sichuan Provincial Museum. Wang Kui Betrays Guiying (ÁéãÈ≠ÅË≤†Ê°ÇËã±) is a Chinese story dating from 11th-century Song dynasty. The story was apparently quite popular by the 13th century (late Song dynasty and early Yuan dynasty), and is still a favorite among Chinese opera enthusiasts. The male protagonist Wang Kui (ÁéãÈ≠Å) was either based on or created to slander Wang Junmin (1035‚Äì1063), who finished first in the 1061 imperial examination but almost immediately developed a mental illness and died 2 years later while in office. (Kui means champion in Chinese.) The story that began to circulate after his somewhat baffling death goes something like this: A young courtesan named Jiao Guiying (Êï´Ê°ÇËã± or ÁÑ¶Ê°ÇËã±) falls in love with an impoverished student named Wang Kui, and supports him with her savings as he prepares for the imperial examination. Wang Kui promises her that once he succeeds in the examination held in the capital Kaifeng, he would immediately fetch her. After finishing first in the examination and becoming the talk of the capital, he cruelly writes Guiying a letter telling her that he now plans to marry a high-ranking minister's daughter. When Guiying receives his letter, she commits suicide. Her ghost then wanders from the Underworld to Wang Kui's residence, where she haunts him and later captures and drags him to Hell.

It is found in North America. The MONA or Hodges number for Macronoctua onusta is 9452. Description Macronoctua onusta is a large brown and smoky dark gray moth (FW length 18‚Äì21 mm). It has a forewing that is broad with a scalloped outer margin and a black streak along the reniform spot. It is dull brown with broad smoky dark gray suffusion on the costa and in the cell as well as in the terminal area and fringe. The antemedial and postmedial lines are thin, dark gray. The antemedial line is drawn far lateral above the posterior margin. The median line is dark brown, strongly arched toward across the brown median area below the cell. The postmedial line is jaggedly zigzagged on the anterior wing and straight from Anterior cubitus vein to the posterior margin. The subterminal line is only evident as the transition from the brown subterminal area to the black terminal area. The terminal area is a black line. The three spots are outlined in thin black. The orbicular spot is a small oval. The reniform spot has a darker posterior outline which forms a straight black line below the cubital vein. It is large and asymmetrically kidney-shaped with the lower end curved toward the outer margin touching the postmedial line. A spike-like process extends toward the base from the posteromedial end. The claviform spot is small and elongate with a rounded end. The hindwing is dirty brown-gray with slightly darker discal spot and veins, and scalloped terminal line. The hindwing fringe is light gray with a brown base. The head and thorax are even smoky dark gray. The male antenna is broad and bead-like. This species is easily identified by its large size, dark gray anterior and lateral margins, and the distinctively shaped reniform spot and postmedial line. Similar dark brown moths lack the dark posterior outline and spike from the medial reniform spot and the postmedial line with serrate anterior and straight posterior segments. Life History * Larvae - This species is a foodplant specialist that bores into the rhizomes of irises (Iris spp.) in the Iridaceae. * Adults - Adults fly in the fall, usually in September and October.

Some say the name Warren derives from a local Aboriginal word, meaning \\"strong\\" or \\"substantial\\". Explorer John Oxley camped on the present of Warren during his investigation of the Macquarie River in 1818. He noted an abundance of kangaroos and emus. Charles Sturt carried out further exploration in 1828‚Äì29. Cattle were grazing in the area by the late 1830s.

Life He was born the second son of the imperial and royal officer Augustin Pavlicek and Gabriele Alscher and baptized with the name Otto. His mother died when he was two years old. Then, his father and sons moved to Vienna, in 1915 to Olomouc. There, in 1920, Pavlicek passed the admittance exam to a higher education institution and then worked for the furniture factory Thonet. He left the church in 1921, was from 1922 to 1924 in the military and worked after that in Prague for the company Brown, Boveri & Cie. Since there the work was not to his satisfaction, he studied from 1927 to 1930 in the academy of fine arts in Wroclaw, lived after that as artist in Paris and London, where he, on December 10, 1932, got wed in a civil ceremony to the artist Kathleen Nell Brockhouse. The marriage lasted only a few months. Pavlicek moved to Cambridge, lived during 1933 in Brno and then in Prague. After recovering from a severe illness, he joined again the Catholic Church on December 15, 1935, and he wanted to become a priest. In 1936, he visited Therese Neumann that strengthened him in his plan. He was neither in Innsbruck nor in Vienna accepted by the Franciscans because he was already 35 years old. Later, he joined in Prague und received the religious name Petrus. On August 29, 1938, he made his simple religious vows, three years later the solemn. On December 14, 1941, he was ordained a priest. On May 13, 1942, he was arrested by the Gestapo for supposed military-forces draft evasion and was brought to a court martial. The process ended with an acquittal. On October 7, he had to march into the west front as a paramedic and became a prisoner of war in American captivity on August 15, 1944. He was taken to Cherbourg- Octeville, where he acted as a Prisoner of War Camp priest and learnt, for the first time, through a brochure, about the Marian apparitions in F√°tima: Our Lady of F√°tima. On July 16, 1945, he was released from captivity, could not return to the monastery in Prague and went to Vienna. There he was appointed as missionary. On February 2, 1946, he went on pilgrimage to Mariazell in gratitude for the fortunate return home from the Second World War. Here, he heard an interior voice, which said:‚Äù Do, as I say, and there will be peace.‚Äù These words reminded him of the message of Fatima and he founded, in February 1947, the Crusade of Reparation of the Holy Rosary for Peace in the World (RSK). Since September 1948, every month in the Franciscan Church, Vienna, took place ceremonies for peace. From 1949, he published a periodical, which is named ‚ÄúBetendes Gottesvolk‚Äù today. From 1950 to 1955, he organized, in September, the yearly procession of the Name of Mary in the Vienna Ring Road. He considered the signing of the Austrian State Treaty, in May 1955, as an achievement of his prayer movement. Father Petrus led the ‚ÄúCrusade of Reparation of the Holy Rosary‚Äù until his death. He was buried in the Franciscan Church. His canonization process was started on October 13, 2000. Works * Das S√ºhne-Opfer Jesu und Mari√§ f√ºr die S√ºnder der Welt.

Located southwest of the city centre, Taman Free School, which was named after the nearby Penang Free School, forms part of the Batu Lanchang suburb.  History  Penang Free School, Southeast Asia's oldest English school, is situated to the west of Taman Free School. Taman Free School mainly consists of low- and medium-cost flats and apartments, which were built in the 1970s. Each of the walk-up apartments is five-storeys high and were not equipped with lifts at the time of construction. In recent years, proposals have been made to rejuvenate the area, which entail the improvement of public facilities and the construction of newer apartments to lower maintenance costs.  Transportation  Taman Free School is bounded by Jalan P. Ramlee to the north, Free School Road to the south and Jalan Trengganu to the west. The neighbourhood is served by Rapid Penang's bus route 206, which includes stops along the aforementioned roads, and links the neighbourhood with George Town, Green Lane and Gelugor.http://www.rapidpg.com.my/journey-planner/route-maps/details/206.gif  Education  Heng Ee High School is situated across Free School Road.

It is found in the deserts of the southwestern United States. The larvae are parasites of bee larvae, eating them and consuming their provisions. Distribution and habitat Meloe franciscanus is endemic to the southwestern United States where it is found among dunes in deserts. This habitat is variable and includes patches of vegetation surrounded by barren areas of sand. One of the plants here is Astragalus lentiginosus which provides food for the adult beetles, which are flightless, and nectar for their host bees. The eggs of the beetle are typically laid at the base of the plants in these \\"islands\\" of vegetation. Ecology Life cycle of M. franciscanus The larvae of this beetle successfully make use of sexual deception by mimicking the mating signals of another insect species. Adult female beetles lay eggs in a compact mass underground, with the egg aggregations on average containing 761 eggs. The beetle larvae emerge from the ground in a group, ascend vegetation one after the other and form themselves into a compact ball in an elevated location. They then release a volatile substance similar to the pheromones emitted by a female bee, which attracts a male digger bee. This bee mistakes the ball of larvae for a female digger bee, and attempts to mate with it. The beetle larvae cling to the bee, transferring to a female bee when the male finds and mates with one. The larvae then get carried to the female digger bee's nest where they detach from the bee and make themselves at home, feeding on the pollen and nectar, placed there by the female bee for her own offspring, and consuming her eggs and young. The digger bee species parasitized in this way in Oregon and the Mojave Desert have been identified as Habropoda pallida and Habropoda miserabilis. Researchers have found that the triungulins (newly hatched blister beetle larvae) climb to different heights in the vegetation before aggregation depending on the habits of the bees in that locality, and the height above the ground at which the males search for mates.

The company received severe criticism from tenants and regulators before agreeing to exit the property management business in Washington DC. History Patrick B. Strauss and Aubrey Carter Nowell founded Sanford Capital in 2005. At its peak, Sanford owned more than 65 rental properties, all in the DC area. At least 330 of the company's residents received public housing vouchers, meaning Sanford received at least $3.7 million per year in taxpayer money. Resident complaints Residents of Sanford's buildings complained about multiple problems related to shoddy maintenance. Some of the highest-profile complaints related to raw sewage spreading through buildings. According to one media account, \\"Feces coagulated like cooled lava along the bathroom walls, and debris-laden brown liquid filled the bathtub and spilled out the bathroom door.\\" Other residents complained about rodent infestations, broken heating systems, non-functioning locks, squatters, blocked drains, broken lighting fixtures, damaged floors, leaky faucets, and broken smoke detectors. In response to resident feedback, Mayor Muriel Bowser ordered a government review of all properties owned by Sanford Capital in 2017. Legal action The Bowser review resulted in 1,083 violations being discovered by city inspectors, who issued $539,500 in fines to Sanford. The nonprofit Equal Rights Center sued Sanford Capital in mid-2017, alleging that Sanford discriminated against veterans and other groups. DC Attorney General Karl Racine filed multiple lawsuits against Sanford Capital. In April 2018, Sanford entered into a consent decree with the District in which the company agreed to stop acting as a landlord in Washington DC within six months. In November 2019, Sanford Capital and its owner settled with the Attorney General, agreeing to pay $1.1 million in rent recovery to 155 residents in three of its apartment complexes.

Biography  Born in Peyrehorade, Girod studied piano at the Conservatoire de musique de Bordeaux, then at the Conservatoire de Paris where she entered Jules Gentil's class. She then worked with Paul Badura-Skoda and Gy√∂rgy Seb≈ëk. She is regularly invited to \\"Mai\\" festivals in Bordeaux, La Roque-d'Anth√©ron, the \\"Festival Estival de Paris\\", the \\"Chopin Festival\\" of Ch√¢teau de Bagatelle, the , the Husum Festival in Germany, the \\" et ses amis\\" Festival, the \\"Moulin d‚ÄôAnd√©\\" Festival (Normandy). She performs in recital in Europe and the United States (Richmond Festival in Virginia), in chamber formation and as soloist with various orchestras, including the orchestra of Brittany with which she recorded Paul Le Flem's Fantaisie pour piano et orchestre. She frequently participates in concerts organized by Radio France, and in radio broadcasts. An artist with a passionate temperament, an open and curious mind, she is as well at ease in the great classical and romantic repertoire (Carl Maria von Weber, Fr√©d√©ric Chopin, Felix Mendelssohn,) than with Maurice Ravel, Claude Debussy and Henri Dutilleux that she likes to interpret. She can also be found in a much rarer repertoire, largely contributing to the rediscovery of composers who are rarely played. Among others, hier recordings of works by Gabriel Dupont, Maurice Emmanuel, Andr√© Jolivet, Arthur Louri√© and Gustave Samazeuilh are unanimously acclaimed by critics, and have won her numerous awards. Through her personal choices, her total commitment to bringing music to life, Girod brings to light, through records and concerts, unjustly neglected composers. In addition to her technical mastery, her playing shows great expressiveness, alternately brilliant and intimate, clear, colourful and delicate, using a vast palette of nuances that always seduces the audience. In 2009 she completed a recording cycle of the complete piano work by Felix Mendelssohn. A pedagogue, she directed the Conservatory of Sucy-en-Brie (94) from 1986 to 2012, she created in 1992 the Concours national de piano of Sucy that she organized until 2005, and has been teaching since October 2011 at the √âcole Normale de Musique de Paris.GIROD Marie-Catherine Marie-Catherine Girod  Prizes  * Grand prix de l‚ÄôAcad√©mie nationale du disque fran√ßais (piano sonatas: Auric, Dutilleux, Jolivet's 1st piano sonata) * Grand prix de l‚ÄôAcad√©mie nationale du disque fran√ßais (Sonatines by Maurice Emmanuel) * Laur√©ate du Grand prix International Charles Cros (1991) (Arthur Louri√©'s works for piano)  Distinctions  *1991: Chevalier of the Arts et Lettres *2011: Officier of the National Order of Merit  Selected recordings  Among many recordings, worth mentioning are: * Felix Mendelssohn: Complete work for piano (8 CDs), √âditions Saphir * Sergue√Ø Rachmaninov: 2nd sonata Op.36, 6 moments musicaux Op.16, √âditions Solstice * Carl Maria von Weber: the four sonatas for piano, √âditions Solstice * York Bowen: 24 Preludes, Nocturnes, Op.78, R√™veries Op.86, √âditions 3DClassics * Louis Aubert / Abel Decaux and others: Sillages / Clairs de lune / Tombeau de Claude Debussy, √âditions 3DClassics * Gabriel Dupont / Gustave Samazeuilh: / Le chant de la mer, √âditions 3DClassics * Pierre-Octave Ferroud: Complete piano music (world premiere recordingJean-Pierre Thiollet, 88 notes pour piano solo, Neva Editions, 2015, p.174. ) √âditions 3DClassics * Paul Le Flem: # Fantaisie pour piano et orchestre (+ ', Symphonie n¬∞1), , dir.

Insurance fraud  Martha L√∂wenstein inherited a villa in the Vienna Woods and financial means in August 1923 from her 50-year-old patron as sole heir, months later she married the student Emil Marek. Within two years, the money was used up by the couple. In 1925 Martha and her husband Emil first entered the mass media coverage: Emil had lost his leg while chopping wood on June 25, 1925, a day after Martha had put an insurance policy on him.Nettersheim, Christoph, Schrecklich nette Frauen. As the circumstances were very strange to the insurance company, they refused to pay the sum and a lawsuit began. In the course of which, forensics experts were able to clearly prove by multiple traces on the leg that it was self-mutilation. Emil Marek, who was almost fully obedient to his wife, had purposely injured himself to get the sum insured. The public, however, was largely on the beautiful Marek's side and suspected that the insurance company wanted to suppress the payment through legal mishaps. Marek and her husband were acquitted of fraud in 1927 and sentenced to only a small prison sentence, as Martha had tried to bribe or slander the coroners. The insurance company agreed to settle the matters out of court and paid a large sum of money.  Prison  Martha Marek spent the short prison time in a cell with the poisoner Leopoldine Lichtenstein, who in 1925 had poisoned her husband with the thallium-containing rat paste \\"Zelio\\". This allegedly inspired Martha to do her other deeds. After the media popularity had subsided, the sum had been used up and Emil's entrepreneurial plans as an inventor had failed, the Mareks experienced economic hardship.  Murders  After Emil Marek, who had always been sickly after the leg amputation, died unexpectedly on July 31, 1932, public attention returned to the widow. When her two children developed similar symptoms and their daughter died shortly after, Martha was able to play off the role of a long-suffering widow and mother, and she was given a broad wave of compassion, including financial donations. An aunt of hers, Susanne L√∂wenstein, even went so far as to appoint her as her sole heir, and promptly died thereafter in 1934. After Marek had used up the inheritance, she found in tailor Felicitas Kittenberger another victim. Kittenberger was taken in by Marek as a subtenant and was persuaded to take a life insurance in Martha's favour. Kittenberger died shortly after, which, however, aroused the suspicion of her son, who filed charges. The subsequent investigation and exhumation of the bodies revealed that Marek had murdered all four victims with the toxic Zelio paste, which was then freely available.  Conviction  Back in court, Martha Marek faked seizures and blindness, and had to be carried to the courtroom in a specially- constructed chair. She was sentenced to death on May 19, 1938 by the jury, with the court assuming that Marek, as a woman, following the Austrian tradition, would be pardoned by the Federal President for life imprisonment. In the meantime, however, Austria had been attached to the German Reich and Adolf Hitler rejected the petition for clemency. Marek was executed on December 6, 1938, as the first delinquent on the recently brought from Berlin to Vienna guillotine, in the Vienna Regional Court by the executioner Johann Reichhart.

History  Before European settlement the area is said to have been occupied by the Ngiyambaa Aborigines. Some say the name Warren derives from a local Aboriginal word, meaning \\"strong\\" or \\"substantial\\". Explorer John Oxley camped on the present site of Warren during his investigation of the Macquarie River in 1818. He noted an abundance of kangaroos and emus. Charles Sturt carried out further exploration in 1828‚Äì29. Cattle were grazing in the area by the late 1830s. Warren station was established in 1845 by Thomas Readford and William Lawson, the son of explorer William Lawson who was a member of the first European party to breach the Blue Mountains in 1813. The railway arrived in 1898 and Burrendong Dam was opened in 1967, allowing the development of cotton and produce.
