He served at numerous fronts and battles during the Italian and Swiss campaigns (1799) as part of the French Revolutionary Wars, and took part in the Napoleonic Wars, including two major battles at Austerlitz and Borodino. During his military career, Glebov suffered numerous wounds and other trauma, but lived on for more than 80 years. Career Andrey Glebov was born into a Russian noble family hailing from the Chernigov Governorate. He started serving in the army when he was 20 years old, in Livonia. After having taken service in the 3rd battalion of the Lifland Jager Corps in January 1791, he served in Poland between 1792-1794. On 30 July 1797, he was transferred to the 7th (later 6th) Jager Regiment. In the Italian and Swiss campaigns of 1799 which were led by Generalissimo Alexander Suvorov, Glebov distinguished himself in the battles at Brescia (10 April 1799), and at Lecco, which took place on 26‚Äì28 April 1799 and during which he became wounded in the left leg. For his deeds in the battle of Lecco, he was awarded the Order of St. Anna, 4th Class. He subsequently continued at Marengo, and on the Tidone and the Trebbia. During the battle of Trebbia, he became wounded in the right leg, and was later promoted to portupei-junker, which is something like an \\"elite cadet rank\\" reserved only for military men from the nobility. He continued military action at Novi, where he became wounded in the head. He was promoted to sub-lieutenant on 25 August 1799, and continued fighting at St.Gothard (wounded in the left hand) and Schwanden; in the latter he became wounded in the head and was captured by the French army. He remained in French captivity for two years. After he was released, he returned to Russia, where he joined the 6th Jager regiment, and became lieutenant on 8 August 1802. Two years later, on 29 October 1804 he became staff captain, and on 31 January 1805, he was promoted to captain. In 1805, he served under Prince Pyotr Bagration and participated at Lambach, Amstetten, Krems, Sch√∂ngrabern, Wischau as well as the climactic Battle of Austerlitz, in which he was wounded on his right side, and later received the Order of St. George (4th Class) on 24 April 1806. Between 1806-1811, he served with his previous 6th Jager Regiment in the Danubian Principalities. He participated in the battles at Bucharest, Chediroghlu (received the Gold Sword for Bravery), Obilesti (promoted to the rank of major on 23 February 1808) as well as Kladovo, where he was wounded in the right leg and left hand. After having healed from his wounds, he subsequently served at Bartokert, for which he was promoted to lieutenant- colonel on 11 October 1809, Rassevat, Dudu (wounded in the left leg), Vidrovitz (promoted to full colonel on 24 July 1810), Praiova (received the Order of St.Vladimir (4th class) and of St. Anna (2nd class) and lastly at the battle of Bregov. In 1812, during the War of the Sixth Coalition, Glebov served in the Second Western Army, participating in Pyotr Bagrations retreat from Volkovisk. As the Russians subsequently made their counterattack, they managed to push the French outposts back, reaching the bridge at Saltanovka (present-day Mogilev) at 08:00 AM. Glebov subsequently played an important role at the heavy fighting at Saltanovka, where the Jager corps he led managed to overrun the defenders who were stationed on the bridge, thus enabling the Russian advance. Following the battle at Moghilev, the 2nd Western Army, which Glebov was part of, completed the construction of a bridge at Novy Bukhov, which they used to cross the river, and then continued marching towards Smolensk. Glebov subsequently participated at Smolensk, Shevardino, and the infamous Battle of Borodino, in which he was wounded in the head. After having recovered from his wounds, he took part at Maloyaroslavets and Krasnyi; for the latter he was awarded the Order of St.Vladimir, 3rd class. In 1813 he once again fought at numerous fronts and battles, which comprised L√ºtzen, Bautzen, Modlin, Dresden, Leipzig (awarded Order of St. George (3rd class) and lastly at the siege of Hamburg. In his last years of active service, he once again distinguished himself at Soissons, Craonne, and Laon. Prof. Alexander Mikaberidze adds that regarding the 6th Jager Regiment, of which he was a part of for a long time, he became chef on 12 May 1814, and served up to 1815 as an assistant to the military commander of the 6th division. His last military act was that of taking command of the 1st brigade of the 12th division on 20 March 1816, shortly he retired from military service on 23 September 1816, at the age of 46, after being discharged and being ordered to move to another regiment. Andrey Glebov died on 24 September 1854 in his farm in the Chernigov Governorate, near the provincial town of Borzna.

Palacio de Alca√±ices (c. 1880s) by Juan Jos√© Zapater Rodr√≠guez. The Duke of Sesto and the Marquis of Sotomayor in front of the stables of Palacio de los Alca√±ices of Madrid, 19th century. The Palacio del Marqu√©s de Alca√±ices, also known as Palacio de Alca√±ices (or Palacio de los Alca√±ices) was a building, now disappeared, which was located in the Calle de Alcal√° of Madrid on the land that was other building that occupied Luis M√©ndez de Haro 6th Marquis del Carpio, a favorite of Philip IV. It belonged to the parish of San Sebasti√°n, and occupied the number 74 of the modern numbering of the street; its other fa√ßade bordering the Paseo del Prado. Was named after its owners, the last one Jos√© Osorio y Silva, mentor of Alfonso XIII, known as Pepe Osorio and the Grand Duke of Sesto, who also held the title of Marquess of Alca√±ices, among others. It was sold in 1882 on the occasion of the works of extension of the calles Zorrilla and de los Madrazo, and today in part of the land that occupied the palace rises the building the Bank of Spain.  History  The first data of the building, indicate that it was built in the 17th century by Luis M√©ndez de Haro 6th Marquis del Carpio, nephew of Gaspar de Guzm√°n y Pimentel Ribera y Velasco de Tovar, better known as Count-Duke of Olivares. Luis M√©ndez de Haro, became a favorite of Philip IV with the disgrace of his uncle. Subsequently, the building was inhabited by the year 1790, by the Dukes of B√©jar, Pedro de Alc√°ntara T√©llez-Gir√≥n y Beaufort Spontin and Maria Josefa Pimentel,Madrid Sin Prisas although this was of very transient form, knowing that this couple took preferably other palaces added to its main entails, such as those of Leganitos, las Vistillas or Cuesta de la Vega. It will be the end of the 18th century when the property was acquired by Manuel Miguel Osorio y Spinola, 15th Marquess of Alca√±ices. It began to be used with its gardens by the nobility as a rest area, a process that was accentuated by the construction of the Buen Retiro Palace, which was almost opposite. With this in mind, the favorite of the king who built the Buen Retiro it built his own residence as close as possible to that of his lord. Due to the poor condition of the building, the Marquis of Alca√±ices, makes a first work of improvement in the early 19th century. At the time of Alca√±ices, which will give the final name to the palace, between the visitors are Isidro Gonz√°lez Vel√°zquez, Guesdon, Parcerisa, Clifford, Laurent, etc. Starting mid-century reflects little variations only important in the gardens as long as changing according to the tastes of the moment, and the last time, for example in the plan of √çbero of 1875, appears entirely English, no trace of the early parterres. In 1823 dies Manuel Miguel Osorio y Spinola and the property is inherited by his son Nicol√°s Osorio y Zayas, who carried out a major reform in 1847 to invest the amount of 2 reales. Nicol√°s Osorio y Zayas was a big fan of horses, one of the founders of the Society for the Promotion of Horse breeding in Spain. In 1854 it built new stables at the Palace. He died in January 1866 passing the property to his son Jos√© Osorio y Silva, Duke of Sesto. Jos√© Osorio y Silva, in 1872, makes a new reform of the Palace ordering the work to Francisco de Cubas y Gonz√°lez-Montes, better known today as Marquis of Cubas, after the Duke marriage to Princess Sofia Sergeyevna Trubetskaya, and also due to the political role played by the marriage in the Bourbon Restoration; inhabited by the Dukes of Sesto, the palace became the center of the Alfonsine meetings. It is striking that just as the origin of the palace itself is paralleled with the Palacio de Lerma-Medinaceli, this too, like that, acquired its most elegant and refined appearance just a few years before its destruction. During this period the palace lived certainly more its period most intense, particularly court of the Duke and his wife, the princess Sofia Sergeyevna Trubetskaya. The cost of supporting the monarchy, from the Duke of Sesto, calculated between 15 and 20 million, and the works of extension of the old streets of del Sordo and de la Greda, today calls Zorrilla and de los Madrazo, forced the Duke of Sesto to sell the Palace in 1882 to the board of the Bank of Spain. It demolished this building and now the site is occupied by the huge headquarters building of the Bank of Spain which the construction of the latter building started in 1884, that originally occupying not only the plot of the palace, but neighboring buildings; It took the opportunity to expand the street calle de la Greda, on whose property the Bank of Spain paid the price for some three million pesetas.

Although economic freedom was highly celebrated since the establishment of Hong Kong as a free trade port under British rule, several attempts at liberal reform received little success in the racially segregated and politically closed colony. However, many western-educated Chinese who were influenced by liberal thinkers became the most vocal reformists and revolutionaries in the late Qing dynasty period, including Ho Kai, Yeung Ku- wan and Sun Yat-sen. Reformist political groups also mushroomed in the early post-war period in response to Governor Mark Aitchison Young's proposed constitutional reform. Liberal movements resurfaced again in the 1980s in the midst of the Sino-British negotiations over Hong Kong's sovereignty, where the liberals demanded for an autonomous democratic Hong Kong under Chinese rule. The liberals engaged in electoral politics when the colonial government carried out massive democratic reforms towards the end of colonial rule. The liberals won landslide victories in the last Legislative Council elections in 1991 and 1995. The influence of liberalism was curbed under the Chinese rule after 1997 due to the indirectly elected elements in the legislature. However, due to the unpopular Tung Chee-hwa administration in the first years of the SAR administration, the liberal movement regained its momentum after the historic 1 July demonstration against a restrictive law on national security, which was denounced by the liberals as an act of censorship. As the Beijing government tightened its grip on Hong Kong's society, the civil movements grew larger and more confrontational in the early 2010s. The 79-day occupy protests which were often referred to as the \\"Umbrella Revolution\\" broke out after the Beijing government's restrictive framework on the constitutional reform proposal gained international coverage. 19th to early 20th century =Laissez-faire liberalism= The cession of Hong Kong under the Treaty of Nanking in 1842 was overseen by then-British Foreign Secretary Lord Palmerston. Lord Palmerston was a prime figure of the Whig Party, which was the predecessor of the Liberal Party. The aims of the Opium War was to open up the Chinese market in the name of free trade. As the British free port of Hong Kong, taking advantage as the gateway to the vast Chinese market, Hong Kong merchants, the so-called compradors, had taken a leading role in investment and trading opportunities by serving as middlemen between the European and indigenous population in China and Hong Kong, in the principles of laissez- faire classical liberalism, which has since dominated the economic discourse of Hong Kong. Sir John Bowring, the Governor of Hong Kong from 1854 to 1859 and a disciple of liberal philosopher Jeremy Bentham for instance was a chief campaigner of free trade at the time. He believed that \\"Jesus Christ is free trade and free trade is Jesus Christ.\\" In 1858, Bowring proudly claimed that \\"Hong Kong presents another example of elasticity and potency of unrestricted commerce.\\" For that reason, Hong Kong has been rated the world's freest economy for the past 18 years, a title bestowed on it by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative Washington think tank, and was greatly admired by libertarian economist Milton Friedman. =Political liberalism= Sir Ho Kai, a Chinese reformist politician who was inspired by socially liberal ideas. Compared to economic liberalism, political liberalism remained marginal in Hong Kong and did not gain much political influence. However, as the debate over Chinese modernisation got fiercer by the end of the 20th century, Hong Kong became the home of Chinese reformists and revolutionaries, namely Sir Ho Kai, who was inspired by classical liberal thinkers such as John Locke, Montesquieu, Adam Smith, Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill. He was an advocate of constitutional monarchy in China and a sympathiser of the revolutionary cause, along with his proteg√©, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, who had studied in Hong Kong and had stated that he got the inspiration for his revolutionary and modernist ideas from Hong Kong. One of the earliest revolutionary organisations, the Furen Literary Society, was set up in Hong Kong by Yeung Ku-wan in 1892. The society met in Pak Tsz Lane, in Central, Hong Kong, and released books and papers discussing the future of China and advocating the overthrow of the Qing dynasty and the establishment of a democratic republic in China. The society was later merged into the Revive China Society. There were very few liberal reforms carried out by the colonial government towards the end of the 19th century. For instance, Sir John Bowring proposed that the elections to the Legislative Council should be based on property and not racial qualification. He believed that voting rights for the Chinese would \\"earn their support for the British government\\", which was strongly opposed by the local European community and the Colonial Office. Sir John Pope Hennessy, the Governor of Hong Kong from 1877 to 1893, was a liberal-minded governor who attempted to tackle the problem of racial segregation in the colony, but had received stiff resistance within the colonial establishment for his radical agenda. Hennessy also proposed to abolish flogging as a form of punishment, which received widespread opposition from the European community, who even held a public protest meeting against his proposal. There were sporadic voices for political liberalisation in Hong Kong during the late 19th and early 20th century. One of the examples was the Constitutional Reform Association of Hong Kong, which was formed by the expatriate British business community in 1917. Headed by Henry Pollock and P. H. Holyoak, it submitted a proposal of introducing unofficial majority within the Legislative Council to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, represented by member of parliament Colonel John Ward, but the proposal was ultimately rejected by the Colonial Office. Failing to obtain any meaningful success for their proposals, the Constitutional Reform Association ceased to exist by October 1923. Post war years =Young Plan= The liberal movement experienced a resurgence following the return of British rule in 1945, after a 3 year long Japanese occupation of Hong Kong. Governor Mark Aitchison Young announced the plan for constitutional changes on the day of the return of the civil government in 1946, as \\"an appropriate and acceptable means of affording to all communities in Hong Kong an opportunity of more active political participation, through their responsible representatives, in the administration of the Territory.\\" It proposed to set up a municipal council which would give Hong Kong a limited degree of representative government. The Young Plan generated debates in the local community. Several political groups were set up to participate in the debate over political liberalisation, such as the Reform Club of Hong Kong, consisting mainly of the expatriate community, and the Hong Kong Chinese Reform Association, consisting of mostly Chinese citizens in 1949. After the Young Plan was eventually shelved in 1952, the Chinese community strongly protested and demanded immediate constitutional reforms. The Reform Club, along with the Hong Kong Civic Association set up in 1954, were the closest to opposition parties in Hong Kong during the post-war colonial period which participated in the Urban Council elections. =Self-government movement= The call for liberalisation and sovereignty continued in the 1950s and 1960s. The United Nations Association of Hong Kong (UNAHK), formed by Ma Man-fai in 1953, demanded sovereignty in Hong Kong. In a proposal drafted in 1961, the association laid out a plan for an ultimately fully direct election for the Legislative Council, which in that period was appointed by the governor. The Reform Club and the Civic Association also formed a coalition in 1960 and sent a delegate to London to demand fully direct elections to the Legislative Council and universal suffrage, but failed to negotiate any meaningful reforms. The self-proclaimed \\"anti-communist\\" and \\"anti-colonial\\" Democratic Self-Government Party of Hong Kong was set up in 1963, calling for a fully independent government in which the Chief Minister would be elected by all Hong Kong residents, while the British government would only preserve its power over diplomacy and military. There were also the Hong Kong Socialist Democratic Party and the Labour Party of Hong Kong, which took a more left- leaning and democratic socialist approach to Hong Kong's independence and decolonization. In 1966, Urban Councillor Elsie Elliott, who was also member of the UNAHK, visited London and met with British government officials and Members of Parliament, asking for constitutional reform towards sovereignty, a reform of the judiciary towards impartiality and equal representation, and comprehensive anti-corruption investigations of the colonial nomenklatura and legal authorities. After once again failing to obtain any successful concessions, all the parties advocating for the sovereignty of Hong Kong ceased to exist by the mid-1970s. =Positive non-interventionism= Economic liberalism and free-market capitalism remained the dominant economic philosophy in Hong Kong throughout its history. In 1971, Financial Secretary John Cowperthwaite coined the term \\"positive non-interventionism\\", which stated that the economy was doing well in the absence of government intervention and excessive regulation, but it was important to create the regulatory and physical infrastructure to facilitate market-based decision making. This policy was continued by subsequent Financial Secretaries, including Sir Philip Haddon-Cave, who said that \\"positive non-interventionism involves taking the view that it is usually futile and damaging to the growth rate of an economy, particularly an open economy, for the Government to attempt to plan the allocation of resources available to the private sector and to frustrate the operation of market forces\\", although he stated that the description of Hong Kong as a laissez-faire society was \\"frequent but inadequate\\". The economic philosophy was highly praised by economist Milton Friedman, who wrote in 1990 that the Hong Kong economy was perhaps the best example of a free market economy. Right before he died in 2006, Friedman wrote the article \\"Hong Kong Wrong ‚Äì What would Cowperthwaite say?\\" in the Wall Street Journal, criticizing Donald Tsang, the Chief Executive of Hong Kong who had the slogan of \\"big market, small government,\\" where small government is defined as less than 20% of GDP, for abandoning the doctrine of \\"positive non- interventionism.\\" =1970s student movements= The 1970s in Hong Kong were the prime years of socially liberal student movements. Although the student unions were all dominated by the Chinese nationalists which were largely inspired by the Cultural Revolution and personality cult of Mao Zedong in Mainland China at the time, a liberal cabinet led by Mak Hoi-wah and assisted by Albert Ho won the 1974 election of the Hong Kong University Students' Union (HKUSU). The liberals held slightly Chinese nationalist sentiments but strongly opposed the blind-eyed pro-Communist nationalist discourse and stressed caring for the Hong Kong society and its citizens. Many of them also opposed colonial rule. They participated in social movements, such as the Chinese Language Movement, the anti-corruption movement, the Baodiao movement and so on, in which many of the student leaders became the main leaders of the contemporary pro-democracy movement. The rise of the pro-democracy camp In the early years of the 1980s, Hong Kong politics were dominated by the issue of the sovereignty of Hong Kong after 1997. Deng Xiaoping, the paramount leader of the Chinese Communist government, insisted China shall rule Hong Kong, while the British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher insisted that the legality of the Treaty of Nanking must be upheld. Some Hong Kong liberal intellectuals saw it as an opportunity to change the colonial status quo to a democratic and fairer society. This view was held by Tsang Shu-ki, a prominent thinker in the social activist circle at the time. In January 1983, the liberals forming the Meeting Point favoured Chinese rule with the slogan of the new Three Principles of People, \\"Nation, Democracy and People's Livelihood.\\" It became one of the earliest groups in Hong Kong that favoured Chinese sovereignty over Hong Kong, but they also wanted a free, democratic and autonomous Hong Kong. The Sino-British Joint Declaration of 1984 guaranteed Hong Kong would retain a high degree of autonomy under Chinese rule with the preservation of the maintained Western lifestyle in Hong Kong. Deng Xiaoping also emphasised the principle of \\"Hong Kong's people ruling Hong Kong.\\" Starting from 1984, the colonial government began to gradually introduce representative democracy into Hong Kong. The reform proposals were first carried out in the Green Paper: the Further Development of Representative Government in July 1984 which allowed 24 seats in the Legislative Council to be indirectly elected by electoral college. Direct elections were also introduced at the district and municipal levels. During the period, many liberal political groups were formed to contest the elections in different levels. By the late 1980s, the Meeting Point led by Yeung Sum, the Hong Kong Affairs Society led by Albert Ho formed in 1985, and the Hong Kong Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood (HKADPL) led by Frederick Fung became the three major liberal political forces active in electoral politics. The liberals also formed the Joint Committee on the Promotion of Democratic Government (JCPDG) to demand a faster pace of democratisation and to introduce direct elections in the 1988 Legislative Council. It was led by the two most prominent liberal icons, Martin Lee and Szeto Wah, who were also appointed by Beijing into the Hong Kong Basic Law Drafting Committee (BLDC), to draft the provisional constitution of the Hong Kong government after 1997. The liberal demands faced strong opposition from the conservative coalition of the business elites and the pro-Communist Beijing-loyalists. In the BLDC, the liberal faction, the Group of 190 also faced the conservative Group of 89, who favoured a less democratic system after 1997. Tiananmen protests and the tide of democracy Martin Lee, prominent figure of the Hong Kong democracy movement. The liberals supported the democratic cause of the Tiananmen protests of 1989 and formed the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China (HKASPDMC). They were shocked by the bloody crackdown on 4 June 1989. Martin Lee and Szeto Wah resigned from the BLDC as an act of protest against the Beijing government after the massacre and the relationship between Beijing and pro-democrats severely deteriorated. The democrats have held the Annual Tiananmen vigil since then and called for the end of one-party rule in China. The pro-democrats became sharply anti-Beijing while the Beijing government accused the liberals of \\"treason\\". The widespread fear among the Hong Kong public also helped the rise of the pro-democracy camp. The liberals formed the United Democrats of Hong Kong (UDHK) in 1990 as the first major political party in Hong Kong's history. The UDHK and Meeting Point alliance and other pro-democratic independents including Emily Lau swept the votes in the first direct elections of the Legislative Council in 1991, by winning 16 of the 18 direct elected seats. To counter the liberal rise in the legislature, the conservative business elites formed the Liberal Party in 1993 which positioned itself as economically liberal and politically conservative. The arrival of the last governor Chris Patten, the former chairman of the British Conservative Party also brought huge political changes in Hong Kong. Despite Beijing's strong opposition, he put forward the much more liberal constitutional reform proposals to enfranchise 2.7 million new voters and lower the voting age from 21 to 18. Safeguarded by the liberal majority, the Patten proposals were passed in the Legislative Council after unprecedented political wrangling. In the substantially more democratic elections in 1995, the Democratic Party, formed out of the merger of the United Democrats and the Meeting Point movement received another landslide victory, winning half of the Legislative Council seats. Many liberal pieces of legislation were able to pass in the last years of colonial rule, such as the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance. At the time, there were also new liberal parties being set up, such as the radical The Frontier, led by Emily Lau, and the Citizens Party, led by Christine Loh. In response to the Patten proposals, the Beijing government set up the Provisional Legislative Council (PLC) which was seen as unconstitutional by the pro-democrats. The pro-democrats, except for the HKADPL, boycotted the PLC and stepped down as legislators during the last days of colonial rule. The pro-democrats ran again in the first legislative elections of the SAR period. Although the pro-democrats continuously received about 60% of the popular vote in every election held since 1997, their influence was contained and hampered by the indirectly elected trade-based functional constituencies. 1 July 2003 protest and further struggle for universal suffrage Since the handover of Hong Kong, constitutional reform remained the dominant political agenda and goal of the liberals. The Hong Kong Basic Law Article 45 promised that \\"the ultimate aim is the election of the Chief Executive (CE) by universal suffrage\\" while Article 68 stipulated that \\"the ultimate aim is the election of all members of the Legislative Council (LegCo) by universal suffrage\\". Pro-democratic politicians and activists demanded an early implementation of universal suffrage for the CE and LegCo elections from the beginning. The pro-democrats launched a protest on 1 July, the establishment day of the Special Administrative Region (SAR) to call for the implementation of universal suffrage and the abolishing of the functional constituencies. The Democratic Party, the flagship liberal party of Hong Kong, suffered intra-party conflicts in the late 1990s, as the left-leaning pro- grassroots \\"Young Turks\\" challenged the leadership and subsequently left the party. It formed the Social Democratic Forum, who held a more social democratic and working-class stance on economics and social matters, and later joined The Frontier. The historic 2003 July 1 demonstration against the Basic Law Article 23 drew more than 500,000 protesters. In 2002, the Tung Chee-hwa administration proposed legislation enforcing Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23, an anti-subversion law. The liberals feared the proposed legislation would undermine the civil liberties of Hong Kongers, and several legal professionals formed the Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23 Concern Group and raised their concerns over the legislation. Protests against the national security bill resulted in a massive demonstration held on July 1, 2003. An estimated 350,000 to 700,000 people (out of the total population of 6,730,800 Hong Kongers) demonstrated against the bill, as well as the failing economy, the government's handling of the SARS epidemic, and the unpopular administration of Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa and Secretary for Security Regina Ip, who was responsible for the creation of the bill. The only protests held in Hong Kong larger than this one were the gatherings contemporarily supporting and commemorating the 1989 Tiananmen square protests, and the 2019‚Äì20 Hong Kong protests against the Hong Kong extradition bill. On 26 April 2004, the National People's Congress Standing Committee (NPCSC) issued a verdict stating that the elections of the 2007 CE and 2008 LegCo will not be decided by universal suffrage, thereby defeating the democrats' appeal for universal suffrage by 2007‚Äì2008. The popularity of the liberal forces rebounded after the massive demonstration held on July 1, 2003. In the 2004 Legislative Council election, the Article 23 Concern Group, having renamed itself to the Article 45 Concern Group, had all four of its candidates elected onto the LegCo. In 2005, Tung Chee-hwa resigned due to ill health and was replaced by Chief Secretary for Administration Donald Tsang. The Tsang administration put forward the Fifth Report constitutional reform proposals, but were turned down by the pro-democrats, who thought it was an insufficient half-measure which did not actually implement democracy within Hong Kong. In March 2006, the Article 45 Concern Group transformed itself into the Civic Party, which became the second largest liberal party behind the Democratic Party. In October of that same year, the former leaders of the social democratic faction of the Democratic Party, Andrew To and former Trotskyist Leung Kwok-hung, also known as \\"Longhair\\", founded the League of Social Democrats (LSD) with Albert Chan and former popular radio host Wong Yuk-man, which positioned itself as a radically pro-democratic and left-wing party. In the 2007 Hong Kong Chief Executive election, Alan Leong of the Civic Party successfully entered the race against the incumbent Chief Executive Donald Tsang. As the Chief Executive was elected by the 800-member Election Committee which was tightly controlled by Beijing officials, Alan Leong ultimately lost to Donald Tsang, receiving only 15% of the electoral votes. In December 2007, the NPCSC once again ruled out universal suffrage for the Chief Executive and LegCo elections, but stated that the 2017 Chief Executive election may be held with universal suffrage.Decision Of The Standing Committee Of The National People's Congress On Issues Relating To The Methods For Selecting The Chief Executive Of The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region And For Forming The Legislative Council Of The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region In The Year 2012 And On Issues Relating To Universal Suffrage (Adopted By The Standing Committee Of The Tenth National People's Congress At Its Thirty-First Session On 29 December 2007), Hong Kong Legal Information Institute Five Constituencies Referendum and the 2010 great split In 2009, when the government carried out the constitutional reform proposals for the 2012 Chief Executive and LegCo elections, the League of Social Democrats suggested the \\"Five Constituencies resignation\\" proposal to pressure the government to implement universal suffrage by having pro-democratic legislators resign in each constituency and run for the successive by-elections in order to initiate a de facto referendum on democracy, the functional constituencies, and universal suffrage. The proposal was rejected by the Democratic Party and the moderate Alliance for Universal Suffrage, who instead sought to engage in peaceful negotiations with Beijing, and officially split with the Civic Party and the League of Social Democrats, fostering discontent from the supporters of the resignation plan. In June 2010, the moderate democrats held a secret meeting with the central government representative in the central government's liaison office, which was the first meeting between Beijing representatives and pro-democratic politicians since the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. The central government subsequently accepted the Democratic Party's modified proposals to allow ten new seats to be directly elected by Hong Kongers. The Democrats' move was seen as an \\"act of betrayal\\" by the radical pro-democrats. In the 2011 District Council election, the radical People Power movement split from the League of Social Democrats and ran against the established Democratic candidates in order to \\"punish\\" the Democratic Party for their overtures towards Beijing. The intensifying split between the moderates and radicals saw the emergence of localism in Hong Kong during the early 2010s. Umbrella Revolution and aftermath A yellow banner which read \\"I want real universal suffrage\\" was hung on Lion Rock. In 2013, legal scholar Benny Tai proposed an act of civil disobedience carried out in Central, Hong Kong to put pressure on the government if its universal suffrage proposals proved to be \\"fake\\" democracy. The Occupy Central with Love and Peace (OCLP) demanded that the government proposal should satisfy the \\"international standards\\" in relation to universal suffrage with no unreasonable restrictions on the right to stand for election. It also said that any civil disobedience should be non-violent, although it cannot guarantee Occupy Central will be absolutely peaceful. On 31 August 2014, the NPCSC of the set limits for the 2017 Chief Executive election. While notionally allowing for universal suffrage, the candidate would need to be nominated by a nominating committee, mirroring the present Beijing-controlled 1200-member Election Committee and must receive the support of more than half of the members of the nominating committee. In response to the NPCSC decision, the OCLP announced that it would organise civil disobedience protests. The Hong Kong Federation of Students and Scholarism mobilised students and staged a coordinated class boycott. At the same time, Scholarism organised a demonstration outside of the Central Government Offices barricade on 13 September where they declared a class-boycott on 26 September. On 26 September night, up to 100 protesters led by Joshua Wong, convenor of Scholarism, clambered over the fence of the square in the Central Government Offices. The police clearance of the protesters in the square drew more protesters to the scene and eventually escalated to the 79-day massive sit-in. The protests precipitated a rift in Hong Kong society, and galvanised youth, a previously apolitical section of society, into political activism or heightened awareness of their civil rights and responsibilities. The protests ended without any political concessions from the government. After the 2014 Hong Kong protests, there were a group of young generation new faces participated in the 2015 District Council elections which were loosely labelled as \\"umbrella soldiers\\" with mixed localist factions. They had a better-than-expected results with eight of them managed to win a seat by beating some incumbents. In April 2016 ahead of the 2016 Legislative Council election, the former student leaders Joshua Wong and Nathan Law in the 2014 Occupy protests announced the formation of a new party called Demosist≈ç advocating a referendum to determine Hong Kong's sovereignty after 2047, when the One Country, Two Systems principle as promised in the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Hong Kong Basic Law is supposed to expire. Barred from running in the election due to the age limit, Demosist≈ç only filled one ticket in Hong Kong Island where chairman Nathan Law was elected. Together with other activists Lau Siu-lai and Eddie Chu under the banner of \\"democratic self-determination\\", they took away about seven percent of the total votes and gained three seats, while older generation of democrats including Emily Lau, Alan Leong and Albert Ho chose to step down. As a result of the Legislative Council oath-taking controversy and the National People's Congress Standing Committee's interpretation of the Basic Law, four pro- democrat legislators, Leung Kwok-hung, Nathan Law, Lau Siu-lai and Yiu Chung- yim were disqualified from the office in July 2017, following the two localist Youngspiration legislators Baggio Leung and Yau Wai-ching were disqualified earlier, over their behaviours during the oath-taking ceremony in which the court deemed as invalid. Shortly afterwards on 17 August, three main leaders in the Occupy protests Joshua Wong, Alex Chow and Nathan Law were given prison sentences for storming the forecourt of the Central Government Complex on 26 and 27 September 2017. 13 other activists who stormed the Legislative Council Complex were also handed prison sentences during the protest against the planned North East New Territories new towns few days before.

Discovered in 1950 and quickly developed, the field's oil production peaked in the 1950s, but remains productive in 2016. In 1975 Southern California Gas Company (SoCalGas), the gas utility serving Southern California, began using one of its depleted oil producing zones, the Wayside 13 zone, as a gas storage reservoir, and it became the second-largest in their inventory after the Aliso Canyon gas storage facility. The field shares part of its extent with the Peter J. Pitchess Detention Center, which includes a maximum-security prison. The only operators on the field as of 2016 were SoCalGas and Vintage Production California, LLC, a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum. The field produced approximately 50,000 barrels of oil in 2014, and the capacity of the gas storage reservoir is about 26 billion cubic feet of natural gas. Forty gas injection wells tap into the reservoir. Geographic setting Honor Rancho is in the hills north of the junction if Interstate 5 and westbound California State Route 126, north-northeast of the confluence of Castaic Creek and the Santa Clara River, adjacent to the Santa Clarita Valley. The town of Castaic is to the northwest, and the cities of Valencia and Newhall are south. Elevation on the oil field ranges from around 1050 to 1450 feet above sea level. Runoff is either to Castaic Creek on the west, or towards the Santa Clara River to the south. Climate in the area is Mediterranean, with warm, dry summers and mild and rainy winters. Access to the natural gas storage facility from the southeast is from Rye Canyon Road, and access to Vintage Petroleum's operations on the north and west is from Hasley Canyon Road, which also provides access to the prison. Geology The oil field is located in the northeastern extreme of the Ventura Basin Province, a petroleum-rich sedimentary basin with a long history of oil and gas production. Overall, the structure of the oil field is a plunging anticline oriented northwest to southeast, dipping to the southeast; most of the hydrocarbon accumulation is along the southwest flank of this structure,(1959) which resembles a southwest-dipping homocline. One stratigraphic unit, the Miocene-age Modelo Formation, contains oil and gas accumulations. To the northeast, the San Gabriel Fault closes the structure, trapping hydrocarbons with an approximate 500-foot offset, placing impermeable rock units adjacent to the petroleum-bearing Modelo formation. The other sides of the field are sealed stratrigraphically, specifically by permeability changes in the rock preventing hydrocarbon movement. The Main Area of the oil field ‚Äì the first discovered ‚Äì contains six separate pools of oil, grouped into the \\"Gabriel,\\" \\"Wayside\\", and \\"Rancho\\" zones, from top to bottom; they have average depths below ground surface of 3,800, 5,300, and 6,500 feet, respectively. The Southeast Area of the field, the portion used since 1975 as a gas storage reservoir, contains one large pool ‚Äì the Wayside 13 ‚Äì at a depth of 9,000 to 11,000 feet below ground surface. History and production Detail of the Honor Rancho field. Active oil wells are black dots; active gas injection wells are orange dots. The field takes its name from the Wayside Honor Rancho, a former minimum-security prison founded in 1938, where inmates were rehabilitated in an outdoor, ranch and farming environment. Honor Rancho was a small oil field found after most of the large oil fields in the vicinity had already been developed. Southeast of Honor Rancho, across Interstate 5, is the Newhall Oil Field, site of the first commercially successful oil well in the western United States, Pico No. 4. But fields such as Honor Rancho were harder to find because the oil traps had no surface expression, like the prominent anticline of the Santa Susana Mountains in which the county's earliest oil wells were drilled. Texaco spudded the Honor Rancho discovery well in August 1950, finding oil at 6,000 feet below ground surface.DOGGR, 170 Production grew for the next several years, with oil output peaking in 1957, and gas in 1965. Several enhanced recovery methods were used during the field's history. In 1954, operators began gas injection into the Wayside pool, discontinuing it in 1961. After the 1957 peak, operators began a waterflood operation in the Wayside pool, and in 1959 in the Rancho pool. In this method, water is pumped back into the reservoir to replace fluid previously removed, increasing reservoir pressure and driving remaining oil to recovery wells.DOGGR, 170-171 In the Southeast Area of the field, gas injection was used from 1960 to 1966, and waterflood from 1972 to 1975, the year the Wayside 13 reservoir was converted to gas storage.DOGGR, 172 In 1975, SoCalGas acquired the Wayside 13 reservoir for use as a gas storage facility. It was the fourth such facility for the utility, after La Goleta near Santa Barbara, Playa del Rey in Los Angeles, and Aliso Canyon north of the San Fernando Valley, and the third which had been an oil field. The Honor Rancho field was the first storage facility acquired by SoCalGas where they also owned the rights to the oil produced. Techniques used to produce gas and maintain the reservoir contributed to oil recovery, which SoCalGas was able to do itself. Sale of the oil produced helped offset other costs. A 2010 upgrade of the field approximately doubled the gas injection and withdrawal capacity. SoCalGas prepared the application to the State Public Utilities Commission in 2009, and received the go-ahead in April 2010. Among the project aims was the removal of highly saline water from the bottom of the storage reservoir, which would allow an increase in total storage capacity by five billion cubic feet. In the current gas field, wells are connected to processing, storage, and transmission facilities by about 12 miles of pipelines, both above and below ground. The design allows withdrawal of up to one billion cubic feet of gas per day.Baker, PEB-4 In January 2016, Santa Clarita City Manager Ken Striplin met with representatives of SoCalGas to determine whether the field had any of the same problems that led to the methane gas leak at the similar, but four times larger gas storage facility ten miles south. He determined the risk level was low. Similarly, Steve Knight, the congressional representative for California's 25th District, toured the facility, and told his constituents that the field \\"is checked constantly.\\" References Category:Economy of Los Angeles Category:Energy in California Category:Environment of Los Angeles Category:Geography of Los Angeles County, California Category:Geology of Los Angeles County, California Category:Natural gas fields in the United States Category:Oil fields in California Category:Petroleum in California ","title":"Honor Rancho Oil Field"},{"id":"49402667","text":"Anisul Islam Mahmud (born 20 December 1947) is the former Minister of Environment and Forest in the Cabinet of Bangladesh.

It holds two caves with interesting but fragile calcareous formations, and has been listed as a protected area since 1978. Description The Gruta do Lago Azul has a main hall with a floor that slopes to a subterranean lake over long. The entrance is circular, about in diameter, illuminating the lake with sunshine. Between the months of September and February the waters take on an intense blue color, for which the lake is named. Fossil bones have been found of large mammals that inhabited the region for more than 12,000 years in the Pleistocene. These include giant sloths, armadillos and sabre-toothed tigers. The Gruta de Nossa Senhora Aparecida does not contain water and has little natural light. It has a single, large hall with a sloping floor at its widest. The hall contains speleothems, some of which are called \\"angels\\" since they resemble humans with wings. The Gruta de Nossa Senhora Aparecida is closed to visitors for safety reasons. History The Gruta do Lago Azul and the Grutas de Nossa Senhora Aparecida, both in Bonito, Mato Grosso do Sul, were listed as natural monuments in 1978 by the National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage (IPHAN). The objective is to preserve the very fragile calcareous structures in the cave, the lake and its aquatic ecosystem, and the landscape around the caves. Visitors are allowed, accompanied by guides from the municipality of Bonito. Regulations are designed to prevent any damage to the cave.

It was inaugurated in 1961 and shut down in 1988, operating at a peak of 100 kilowatts thermal (kWt), and was officially decommissioned in 2007. The reactor was housed in a reinforced concrete building designed in the Brutalist architectural style by UW faculty members. They designed the reactor room with large windows that allowed observation from the outside, in an attempt to demonstrate the safety of nuclear energy. The Nuclear Reactor Building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2009, after a campaign led by an architecture student in response to the proposed demolition of the building. A later demolition plan prompted a lawsuit from preservation groups, which ended with a court ruling exempting the building from the city's landmarks-preservation ordinance. While this decision was eventually overturned, the university demolished the building in July 2016 and replaced it with a new computer science building that opened in February 2019. Design and functions The building housed an Argonaut class reactor with an initial output of 10 kilowatts thermal (kWt), later increased to 100 kWt in 1967. It used uranium-235 as fuel and was cooled by water. The reactor's chamber, placed on the lower floor of the facility, was high, long, and wide. During its 27-year lifespan, the reactor operated for the equivalent of 140 days, running for some days at half power and for as little as 10 minutes. The More Hall Annex was a two-story, reinforced concrete structure designed in the Brutalist style, similar to other buildings on the university campus built during the post-war era. It occupied a footprint of from north to south and from east to west, with a total of of interior space. The building was designed by a consortium of UW faculty members, known as The Architect Artist Group (TAAG), with input from nuclear engineering department chair Albert L. Babb. Babb requested a building that would \\"show the world what nuclear power looked like\\", desiring a prominent structure on the campus that would serve as a crown jewel for the department. The large glass walls enabled public viewing of the reactor room's interior, showcasing the activity inside. The first floor, partly covered by the outdoor plaza, housed the reactor, laboratory, crystal spectrometer, counting room with a nuclear densometer, classrooms, restrooms, and offices. The second floor contained the control room, an observatory, and a lecture room overlooking the reactor; it was open to the outdoor plaza on three sides, with large glass windows allowing for public observation of experiments. The reactor was placed on the lower side of the building, downhill of the plaza, to allow the ground to absorb accidental radiation leaks. The structure's roof rested on a series of perpendicular beams that also supported a three-ton ( kg) crane used to lift the reactor shield between experiments. History alt=A subterranean room containing a circular structure divided into two halves. The structure is visibly weathered and has been hollowed out. During the late 1950s and 1960s, the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) provided universities and colleges with grants to acquire small nuclear reactors for research programs. The University of Washington began nuclear engineering classes as part of the College of Engineering in 1953 and formed a Department of Nuclear Engineering in 1956, accepting engineers from Boeing and the nearby Hanford Site as its first students. The Nuclear Engineering department used training reactors at Bagley Hall and later proposed that the university acquire a nuclear reactor to be installed on campus. In 1957, the AEC approved $100,000 in funding (equivalent to $ in dollars) for the University of Washington to install a permanent nuclear reactor on the campus, the first of its kind in the United States. The proposed 10 kW reactor was approved by the university's Board of Regents in April 1959, to be housed in a two-story reinforced concrete building with offices, workshops, a control room, and class and seminar spaces. The building was designed by TAAG architects Wendell Lovett, Gene Zema and Daniel Streissguth, all members of the UW faculty. In December, the regents awarded the construction contract to Jentoft & Forbes, paying $308,082 (equivalent to $ in dollars) for the project. A site at the eastern edge of the campus was chosen for its proximity to various academic engineering buildings and its visibility to the public. The AEC granted an operating license for the reactor to the university in April 1961, and the reactor began operating with a self- sustained nuclear reaction on April 10. It was officially dedicated on June 1, in a ceremony attended by Argonne National Laboratory director Norman Hilberry, a physicist who worked on Chicago Pile-1, the world's first nuclear reactor to achieve criticality. During the 1962 World's Fair, hosted by the city at the Seattle Center, the reactor became the subject of group tours from professional organizations. Throughout the 1960s, the reactor was used for medical research by the university's School of Medicine and local hospitals, with a staff of six full-time employees and four part-time staff (most of whom were students who worked for the U.S. Navy's nuclear programs). In 1966, the university and local law enforcement agencies proposed converting the reactor into a part-time laboratory for forensic science. By 1975, the reactor had only used of its of uranium-235 fuel. =1972 plutonium spill= On June 13, 1972, during an experiment that used a plutonium sample, three lab workers were exposed to radiation after a capsule holding the sample spilled, requiring a full investigation of the nuclear reactor. One of the workers, graduate student W. Robert Sloan, was exposed to of plutonium dust and drove to a laboratory in Richland to be tested for radiation, but was found to have not been significantly contaminated. The spill was later linked to vibrations in the capsule holding the sample, and workers credited good design and careful handling in avoiding a larger incident. A visiting class of schoolchildren from Montana, observing the reactor from the outside, were unaffected by the accident. After an inspection by teams from the Hanford Site, the lab was cleaned and wiped down while periodic radiation checks were performed. Contaminated materials were sanitized with a liquid freon solution and disposed of; the clean-up cost a total of $30,000 in emergency funds (equivalent to $ in dollars). The university was cited by the AEC for violations of its reactor-operating license in connection with the incident, but none in direct connection to the immediate cause. The incident resulted in an investigation by the Nuclear Reactor Advisory Committee into its review processes for reactor experiments, after the AEC determined there was inadequate review of the UW experiment. The staff members were praised by the AEC for protecting the public by sealing the materials and evacuating the building for six hours. =Shutdown and decommissioning= In the late 1970s, development of nuclear power in the United States slowed to a halt, as new plants were cancelled or put on hold. The 1983 financial collapse of the Washington Public Power Supply System, a government agency planning to build five large nuclear power plants throughout the state, and the Three Mile Island accident of 1979 both contributed to a decline in interest in the university's nuclear program. Student use of the reactor was replaced by commercial use to produce nuclear isotopes for medical use. By 1988, the enrollment in UW's nuclear engineering program had shrunk to 23 students, and the program was cancelled entirely in 1992. The reactor was shut down on June 30, 1988, following a Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) mandate to convert research reactors to lower-grade fuel, or shut them down entirely, after fears of possible terrorist access. The remaining of enriched uranium fuel rods were transported to Idaho for processing and disposal. The building provided offices and storage space for various UW departments, including the College of Engineering's robotics laboratory. The University of Washington applied to the NRC to dismantle the reactor on August 2, 1994. In the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks, the Nuclear Reactor Building was renamed to the More Hall Annex to deter burglary, after a request from the NRC. Formal decommissioning of the site, including a $4 million cleanup (equivalent to $ in dollars), began in April 2006, amid student protests over the contractor hired for the work. The NRC formally terminated the university's license to operate the reactor in May 2007. =Preservation attempts= Prior to the removal of the reactor in October 2008, the university proposed demolishing the structure and redeveloping the site for other uses. The plan was stopped after the reactor building was placed on the Washington Heritage Register, the state's list of historic buildings, a designation that was contested by the University of Washington. Preservationists suggested re-using the building as a museum dedicated to the state's nuclear history and continuing research. The structure was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2009, based on an application submitted by Abby Inpanbutr (n√©e Martin), a UW architecture student, in spring 2008. The university again proposed demolition of the structure in 2015, to clear the space for a new computer science building adjacent to the existing Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering. In May 2015, the More Hall Annex was named one of Washington's \\"most endangered historic properties\\" by the Washington Trust for Historic Preservation, which cited its place as an early Brutalist work to justify its preservation. The university released a draft supplemental environmental impact statement (SEIS) for the project in October 2015, recommending the demolition of the More Hall Annex in their preferred alternative. In response to the SEIS, building conservation group Docomomo WEWA nominated the More Hall Annex for city landmark status on December 2. The University of Washington filed a lawsuit against the City of Seattle and Docomomo on December 18 over the landmark nomination and whether the city could enforce its landmark preservation laws on state-owned property. The King County Superior Court ruled in April that the university was exempt from the city's landmarks- preservation ordinance and could go ahead with demolition of the More Hall Annex. While the city and preservationists appealed the decision, they allowed the demolition of the More Hall Annex to proceed by not seeking a stay that would leave them responsible for damages compensation. The decision was appealed to the Washington Supreme Court, which ruled in the city's favor and rejected the university's claimed exemption from the city landmarks preservation ordinance. =Demolition= alt=Excavating equipment in a concrete parking lot, behind a fenced off courtyard On February 11, 2016, the UW Board of Regents approved a site plan that would demolish the More Hall Annex to allow for the construction of the new computer science center, to open in 2019. An attempt to incorporate elements of the nuclear reactor into the new computer science building was rejected because of the impact of potential seismic retrofits that would be required to meet modern standards. The computer science department instead plans to make a virtual tour of the building available online in a digital archive. After the decision by the King County Superior Court to exempt the building from city preservation ordinances, the university applied for a demolition permit in May 2016. Demolition of the More Hall Annex began on July 19, and preservationists held a mock funeral for the building with Daniel Streissguth, one of the project's original architects. =Replacement= The More Hall Annex was replaced by the Bill & Melinda Gates Center for Computer Science & Engineering, which houses part of the university's computer science program. The building includes a 250-person lecture hall, classrooms, and lab spaces for robotics and other technologies. In January 2017, the Board of Regents approved its construction, which began later in the year. The building was topped out in December 2017, roughly marking the halfway point in construction. The Bill & Melinda Gates Center was opened to students on February 28, 2019.

It is the sequel to 2014's Watch Dogs and the second installment in the Watch Dogs series. It was released for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Microsoft Windows in November 2016. Set within a fictionalized version of the San Francisco Bay Area, the game is played from a third-person perspective and its open world is navigated on-foot or by vehicle. Players control Marcus Holloway, a hacker who works with the hacking group DedSec to take down the city's advanced surveillance system known as ctOS. There are multiple ways to complete missions, and each successful assignment increases the follower count of DedSec. Cooperative multiplayer allows for competitive one-on-one combat and connecting with other players to neutralize a player who is causing havoc. Ubisoft Montreal studied player feedback from the first game to assess what could be improved in Watch Dogs 2 and the setting was researched by making frequent trips to California. Ubisoft Reflections was responsible for overhauling the driving mechanic. Real hackers were consulted to validate scripts and game mechanics for authenticity and references to real-life hacktivism were fictionalized, like the Project Chanology protest. The original soundtrack was composed by Hudson Mohawke. The game was released to overall positive reception from critics which praised the game for improving upon the original Watch Dogs in areas like the hacking, setting, characters and driving. However, character inconsistencies, firearms, and frequent technical issues ‚Äì later patched ‚Äì were cited as imperfections. Watch Dogs 2 had sold more than 10 million copies by March 2020. A sequel, Watch Dogs: Legion, is scheduled for release in October 2020.  Gameplay  Similar to its predecessor, Watch Dogs 2 is an action-adventure game with stealth elements and played from a third-person perspective as Marcus Holloway, a young hacker. The game features an open world set in a fictionalized version of the San Francisco Bay Area, an area more than twice as large as the Chicago setting from Watch Dogs. It consists of four different areas: San Francisco, Oakland, Marin, and Silicon Valley. Players can navigate the game's world on-foot or by the various vehicles featured in the game, such as cars, trucks, buses, cable cars, motorcycles, quad bikes, and boats. The driving mechanic was overhauled and designed to be more accessible. The player can shoot their weapons while driving. Marcus also has improved acrobatic skills, and the ability to parkour around the city. The player can use different methods to approach the game's missions, choosing between the aggressive approach, in which they defeat enemies with guns which are made with a 3D printer; explosives, like mines; or Marcus' own melee weapon, a billiard ball attached to a bungee cord. Alternatively, the player can use the stealth approach, in which they can evade enemies or paralyze them temporarily with Marcus' taser. Watch Dogs 2, like its predecessor, places a particular emphasis on using environmental apparatus and the terrain to Marcus' advantage. For example, a player may hack an A/C unit to produce an electric shock when an enemy nears it. Marcus may also employ his own modular taser devices and explosives to use tactically against enemies. When law enforcement witnesses the player committing a crime, or is alerted by a non-player character (NPC), police officers will attempt to arrest the player. The game upgrades system is a returning feature, with items being divided into three categories: Ghost, Aggressor, and Trickster. Upgrades can be customized according to playstyles. Players can hack the environment around them to advance in the missions. Marcus can hack into various electronic devices connected to the ctOS system with his in-game smartphone. For example, Marcus can modify the personal information of NPCs to have them arrested or attacked by one of various gangs, hack and manipulate every mobile phone featured in the game, disrupt traffic by hacking cars and traffic lights, hack into monitoring cameras, and carry out \\"mass hacking\\", which hacks the electrical equipment of a large group of people. The player can also gain multiple options while hacking the same object. For instance, if the player attempts to hack a car, they can gain direct control over them, or have the car lose control and crash in a random direction. Unlike Aiden, the protagonist of the first game, Marcus has an arsenal of advanced equipment, including a quadcopter and remote-controlled car, both of which can be used for remote hacking and scouting. Marcus' apparel can be customized with over 700 articles of clothing, available for purchase in stores that maintain fashion styles unique to what is worn by the denizens in each area. The game features several main story missions, and side-missions known as \\"operations\\". Once completed, Marcus' follower count will increase. = Multiplayer = Multiplayer returns in Watch Dogs 2. The game introduces a cooperative multiplayer mode, in which players can meet and interact with other random players. They can explore the open world and complete missions together, which will also help players to gain followers. The game features an emote system, which allows players' characters to communicate with each other through basic gestures. The game can be played completely online or offline. It also features six competitive multiplayer modes: * Hacking Invasion: A one-versus-one competitive multiplayer mode, originally featured in the first game, in which a player covertly joins another player's single-player session and steals virtual data from them. The invading player must stay hidden while stealing the data, while the defending player must identify and kill the invading player. * Bounty Hunter: A mode introduced in the game. If an online player creates too much chaos in the world, the mode will be initiated. Alternatively, a player can manually initialize this game mode. Police, alongside one to three other players, will join the player's game with the hope of killing the hunted and claiming the bounty, which gives them experience points. The hunted could either strike back at the hunters by killing them, which gives them greater rewards, or escape from them until the bounty expires. The hunted, meanwhile, also can be assisted by another player if that player chooses to join the hunted. Players can manually place a bounty on themselves using the in-game smartphone. * Showd0wn: A mode added in an update. In this mode, 2 teams of 2 players battle each other in short missions. Missions vary from the first team to steal the hard drives to the offensive team having to hack the servers the defensive team is protecting in a limited amount of time. * Racing: A mode added in an update. Up to four players compete in head-to-head races to reach the finish line with drones, ekarts, boats, and bikes. * Man vs Machine: A mode added in an update. Up to four players work together to take down a machine in a narrow time frame. * Loot Trucks: A mode added in an update. Up to four players compete in a head-to-head battle to steal a valuable box from a truck, and escape the police and other players. This event has a chance to randomly occur while a player is free-roaming, but can also be manually triggered.  Plot  In 2016, three years after the events of Chicago, San Francisco becomes the first city to install the next generation of ctOS (central Operating System) - a computing network connecting every device together into a single system, developed by technology company Blume. Hacker Marcus Holloway, punished for a crime he did not commit through ctOS 2.0, decides to join hacking group DedSec (composed of hackers Sitara, Wrench, Horatio, and Josh), and conducts an initiation test by hacking a Blume server farm to wipe his profile from the system. DedSec determines that the new ctOS can covertly harm innocent citizens across the city, and thus decide to bring about awareness of their goals through conducting a social media campaign to recruit, by exposing corruption and crimes being conducted through the system, before bringing down Blume. After a number of successful exposures, Josh discovers a number of irregularities in their follower numbers. When Marcus investigates this, he learns that DedSec has been used by Blume's CTO Du≈°an Nemec, in order to sell ctOS 2.0 to those frightened at being hacked. Forced to leave the city for a while, DedSec partake in a hacking event in the desert, and encounter legendary hacker Raymond \\"T-Bone\\" Kenney. Interested in assisting them, Raymond joins with DedSec as they work to continue their fight against Blume. After hacking the server farm of a major internet company, the group use the data they acquire to pursue and expose corruption amongst law enforcement officers, politicians, and numerous Silicon Valley corporations, while Marcus also focuses on bringing down several crime gangs, after one group murders Horatio for refusing to co-operate in their crimes. At the same time, Du≈°an attempts to disrupt DedSec's operations by combating them with a rival hacking group and the FBI, only for Marcus to counter his efforts. Eventually, DedSec comes across information about the data manipulation program called \\"Bellwether\\", designed by Raymond, and learn that with both this and a new satellite network, designed to bypass undersea data cables, Du≈°an plans to manipulate world finances and politics, thus creating a monopoly on the entire world's electronic data. To expose this and his corruption, DedSec co-ordinate a massive operation to allow Marcus to infiltrate Blume's San Francisco headquarters, hack their servers, and feed the information of Du≈°an's crimes to the police. Du≈°an is arrested for fraud and Blume is put under investigation, though DedSec resolve to continue their fight against Blume. In an extended ending scene added in a post-release patch, two unidentified individuals note that more DedSec cells and hacktivist groups have been emerging worldwide in response to the San Francisco Blume scandal, and that it is time to put their own plans into motion. The filename of the recording seen in the ending is a set of coordinates located in Brixton, London.  Development  At E3 2014, Ubisoft executive Tony Key claimed they were satisfied with the sales of the first game, and that the brand would be turned into a long-running franchise. According to creative director Jonathan Morin, the first game's main goal was to establish the Watch Dogs brand. It was intended that they take risks with the sequel, instead of creating a more polished version of the previous game. To improve the game, Morin and his team read the reviews of the first game, and visited NeoGAF and various forums to study player feedback. Their priorities included creating a \\"believable\\" environment, giving players more freedom, and introducing a new leading character, whose personality would be completely different from that of the protagonist of the first game, Aiden Pearce. The primary developer Ubisoft Montreal worked with other subsidiaries Ubisoft Toronto, Ubisoft Paris, Ubisoft Bucharest, Ubisoft Kiev, and Ubisoft Reflections to aid in the production. The driving mechanic was completely overhauled to make it more accessible to players, and was developed by Ubisoft Reflections, the developer of Ubisoft's own Driver series. In light of complaints about a graphical downgrade in Watch Dogs from what was seen at E3 2012, Ubisoft assured that Watch Dogs 2 would not suffer the same outcome because, unlike the first installment, it was developed for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One from the start. Another improvement from the first game was a more prominent thematic connection to the narrative. Main operations are structured like story arcs that last up to ninety minutes each, advancing the plot with each completion. The developer worked with consultant hackers who would validate their scripts, including the use of jargon, and gameplay mechanics in order to ensure the authenticity of the subject matter. The propaganda used by the game's hacker group DedSec was influenced by animated GIF culture, glitch art and comic books from the late 1940s. David Maynor served as a hacking advisor. Content director Thomas Geffroyd, who had twenty years of experience with the hacking community, was tasked to accumulate information from hacktivists ‚Äì such as author Violet Blue ‚Äì and then relay it to the team. The game also features references to real life; Project Chanology was fictionalized in the mission \\"The False Prophets\\". Ubisoft Montreal made frequent scouting trips to California to research the setting, and attempted to put most of the local landmarks in that region in the game. For regions that they could not put in the game, the team redesigned these locations and put them back into the game. According to producer Dominic Guay, having realistic and accurate locations featured in the game was essential for the game as they encourage players to explore the open world. Unlike many of Ubisoft's previous open world games, players do not need to climb towers in order to discover locations and missions. Instead, the game is opened up from the start, allowing players to explore the city freely. The game's new progression system, which tasks players to gain followers instead of completing main missions, was another way Ubisoft Montreal hoped to encourage exploration and make the city feel more \\"free\\". Watch Dogs 2 had around sixty programmers devoted to its development. The soundtrack was composed by Hudson Mohawke. Ingrained with a combination of electronic music and hip hop, it was approached from the palette of cult science fiction music. Ubisoft teamed up with Dutch music producer Oliver Heldens to influence the video for his track \\"Good Life\\" in the vein of DedSec. For acquiring licensed songs, an agreement was made with Amoeba Music. Mohawke's soundtrack was released separately as DedSec ‚Äì Watch Dogs 2 (Original Game Soundtrack) via Warp Records. A sequel to Watch Dogs was rumored since its release but first officialized by publisher Ubisoft through financial reports in February and May 2016, before it was confirmed as a part of the 2016 E3 lineup. A 20-minute online reveal was hosted a couple of days later. On October 27, 2016, Watch Dogs 2 was announced to have been released to manufacturing.  Release  On June 8, 2016, Ubisoft revealed the game would be released on November 15 of that year for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in six separate editions. In September 2016, it was announced that Watch Dogs 2 would have enhancements on PlayStation 4 Pro. In October 2016, Ubisoft announced that the Windows version was delayed to November 29, 2016 to ensure that the game was well-optimized. It was featured on the front cover of Edge in August. Two weeks from release, Ubisoft and Samsung partnered to bundle a free digital download of Watch Dogs 2 with the purchase of their solid-state disks or curved gaming monitors. Amazon Prime copies were subject to an early release, which revealed issues with the seamless multiplayer. Ubisoft vowed to repair the feature on schedule but on the day of release, the company said it was broken ‚Äì citing persistent lagging and crashing. Cooperative multiplayer was enabled a week after the game's release. A free trial lasting three hours was released for PlayStation 4 on January 17, 2017; the Xbox One version was downloadable on January 24. Pre- ordering \\"The Gold Edition Collector's Edition\\" included additional content such as weapon skins, vehicles and drones; the \\"Deluxe Collector's Edition\\" contains the same, but excluded the season pass. Each of these, as well as the generic \\"Collector's Edition\\", contained a physical robot called \\"Wrench Junior\\", controlled by a mobile app on a smartphone or tablet computer. The \\"Gold Edition\\" came with the same items and season pass, and while the \\"Deluxe Edition\\" omitted the inclusion of the season pass, it contained all other additions. The mission \\"Zodiac Killer\\" was also exclusive to pre-order purchases.

Reception  Watch Dogs 2 received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews from critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic. Technical issues on consoles were fixed with the Update 1.04 patch. In his review, Destructoids Zack Furniss praised the sequel's tonal shift to a lack of seriousness and stated that its protagonist Marcus Holloway boasted a similar charm and wit. He thought well of the hacking component as it was suggestible to multiple fields of use, and enjoyed its nature of compatibility with a non-lethal approach; in fact, Furniss felt that for this reason firearms could have been excluded entirely. The driving was lauded as an improvement from the first game, yet technical issues like glitches and low frame rates were cited as shortcomings. To Matt Buchholtz, writing for EGM, the game signified \\"less a hacktivist tale and more a beautiful immersion into the San Francisco Bay\\". The setting, characters and story were cited as considerable refinements from its predecessor. Buchholtz discerned that the tasks demanded to gain followers were successful in encouraging world exploration. He noted however that ‚Äì in context of the main character ‚Äì murder made little sense, which led to increased usage of stealth. Elise Favis at Game Informer both disparaged and praised elements in comparison to those of Watch Dogs. She enjoyed that hacking was prioritized in the gameplay and the new \\"smoother\\" driving mechanic, but saw inconsistencies in the protagonist's actions versus his personality and thought supporting characters \\"too obnoxious and petty to be meaningful companions\\". Favis also experienced low frame rate capabilities on PlayStation 4. Aron Garst of Game Revolution stated that Watch Dogs 2 had redressed \\"nearly every negative aspect of the original\\", and as such, marked a favorable change in the franchise. IGNs Dan Stapleton liked Marcus Holloway more than Aiden Pearce of the first game, and similarly appreciated the supporting characters of DedSec. Marcus' penchant for moral integrity was a noticeable contradiction for Stapleton, though, in light of the prospect to have him kill innocent people if one so chooses. Therefore, the character's personality was observed as the only preclusion to violence and an axiomatic push toward the stealth approach, which Stapleton insisted was the most accommodating of available tools. Writing for Polygon, Philip Kollar saw that Watch Dogs 2 could appeal to those able to connect with \\"being young, angry at the system and certain that you know what's best for the world\\". Its tongue- in-cheek demeanor was said to naturally coincide with the hacker culture and open world genre. San Francisco ‚Äì the spaces of which were described as \\"cleverly designed\\" ‚Äì never felt overwhelming in size to Kollar but inspired joy as he took advantage of the immediate ability to explore it entirely. His complaints concerned firearms; their use was considered \\"a complete failure of imagination\\" and unbelievable from the members of DedSec ‚Äî \\"an Anonymous-esque group of peaceful hacktivists\\". Alice Bell of VideoGamer.com wrote in her verdict, \\"Watch Dogs 2 is missing a bit of refinement, and has had issues with multiplayer, but joining DedSec is still a riot and a half. It's high energy fun with engaging characters, and you can make an entire city your playground\\". = Sales = In November 2016, Ubisoft revealed that the game's pre-orders were disappointing for the company. Due to this, Ubisoft took a more conservative approach and reduced the sales projection for the second half of its fiscal year 2017. However, CEO Yves Guillemot was confident that the game would not be a commercial failure, and compared the game to Far Cry 3, a commercially successful game with low pre-order sales. He believed that reviews would have a great impact to the game sales due to consumers' \\"wait- and-see\\" approach. Watch Dogs 2 was the second-best-selling retail video game in the United Kingdom in its week of release, according to Chart-Track, an eighty percent decrease from the sales of the original. In the United States, the game ranked number eight in sales in January 2017. The PlayStation 4 version sold 68,796 copies in Japan. In May 2020, Ubisoft announced in their earnings report that Watch Dogs 2 has sold more than 10 million copies by the end of the 2019‚Äì20 fiscal year, which ends in March 2020.  Sequel  A sequel, Watch Dogs: Legion, was teased by Ubisoft via Twitter a week before the official announcement at E3 2019, where the release date was revealed to originally be March 6, 2020, but has since been pushed back to an October 29 release.

The Kaivarta were able to capture Varendra by this rebellion. Later on, in 1082 CE, King Rampala was succeed to recapture his fatherland Varendra by defeating Vim with the assistance of neighbouring vassals. Thus, the first revolt of rebellious Kaibarta came to an end. Background The map of Pala dynasty during the reign of Dharmapal(violet) It is hard to determine the causes and nature of the revolt. King Mahipala II arrested his two brothers Shurapala II and Rampala II in the time of ascending the throne. Soon the vassal chiefs rebelled, which was believed to be because of the weakened state of the central authority rather than the immediate actions of Mahipala II. When the king tried to counter with a small army, he was defeated and killed by a Kaivarta chieftain by the name Divya (or Divokka). Divya established a new dynasty in north Bengal for a brief period. The Pala dynasty is known as golden age of Bengal. But after the golden age of Dharmapala and Devpala, the Pala emperors started to lose their glory. Their rule became weak and disorganisation broke out. The principal aim of the rebellion was to bring back the maintenance. Duration According to Ramacharitam, the rebellion took place from 1075 - 1082 CE in the reign of Mahipala II and Rampala II. Uprising Pala employee Divya called for revolution. The Kaivartas responded on his call and the rebels were easily able to capture the Varendra. As the Kaivartas were very expert in boating, they capitalised on naval war. Mahipala II was killed by the rebels and the Pala armies were forced to fall back. As a result, Varendra was declared a separate state by Divya. After the death of Divya, first Divya's brother Ruddoka and then Ruddoka's son Vima were declared king of Varendra. Vima established himself as a successful and expert ruler. Vima made the war-torn Varendra prosper. The Kaivarta pillar is still standing in Dinajpur of Bangladesh as a sign of the dynasty. 'The Kaivarta pillar in Dibar Dighi(Divya's Lake) in Dinajpur,Bangladesh Recapture of Varendra Seeing the prosperity of Varendra and popularity of Vima, Rampala became worried after ascending the throne. He was afraid of losing more of Pala territory. Because of this, he managed the neighbouring vassals with a lot of money and property for assistance in the war. It was difficult for Vima and the newly formed state Varendra to defend against the large combined army of Rampala. He was imprisoned at the north shore of the Ganges river while fighting. The Pala armies looted the countless treasures of Varendra. When Vima was imprisoned, his faithful worker Hari reorganised the army and attacked Rampala again. When Hari was on the verge of victory, Rampala enchanted him with wealth. Thus, the dream of the liberty of Varendra was spoiled and Varendra was again part of the Pala empire. Trial of Vima Kaivarta leaders were punished so that the Kaivartas could not dare again to revolt. Vima's family was killed in front of Vima and later on, Vima was assassinated.

Location Though Joyuda is easy to access from Mayag√ºez, the neighborhood belongs to the barrio Miradero in the municipality of Cabo Rojo. A chain of fishing hamlets, mini-docks and wooden homes raised above water on stilts, occupies the mile-long portion of the road P.R. 102 that borders the sea, just along the Joyuda Cove (). At its north, runs the Guanajibo River, also known as Pirate River for \\"stealing the waters of rivers that ran south.\\" Closer yet lies the bioluminescent saltwater Joyuda Lagoon, a natural preserve and a bird sanctuary with an extensive mangrove forest and more than 40 sorts of fish. Slightly to the west, off the coast and toward the Mona Passage is another natural preserve. Within a stone's throw, emerges Mice Cay (), a Brown pelican nesting grounds, an islet covered with Australian pines and bordered by sandy beaches. History Joyuda should be one of the few coastal settlements in western Puerto Rico to forgo claims of Christopher Columbus landing. Though the nearby path, \\"Camino el Indio\\" (en: Indian Way), may elicit visions of a rich indigenous past, little surfaces, in fact, from colonial sources about Joyuda, but until the 19th century. With the sharp population growth that followed the Spanish American wars of independence and the resulting migration of loyalist creoles to the island, Joyuda made a definitive appearance on the map. Even foreign publications refer to 19th century Joyuda as a fishing center, flanked by sugarcane fields, watered by the Guanajibo watershed. One Spanish source describes the Mouse Cay as larger and nearer to the coast than what is today. Pineapple and sugarcane grew on it, which explains its earlier name of Cay of Pineapples (). Among the flurry of English-language publications about Puerto Rico that rolled out of New York presses in the wake of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Joyuda turns up commonly as a point of geo-reference. Scientists suddenly were paying attention to the Joyuda Lagoon, particularly those from the College of Agriculture, today's Mayag√ºez campus of the University of Puerto Rico. Even a coconut-cultivation business grew around it, cutting the extent of the mangrove forest drastically. The fishing community, however, continued to make little noise. Only its food, especially homemade meals prepared with shellfish, crab and fish, was any making waves. It began in the 1940s with a trickle. From nearby U.S. companies in Mayag√ºez, came a steady dribble of yuppie customers who could afford to take the 15 minutes drive over the new road and across the river and lagoon to eat \\"genuine\\" Puerto Rican food.

The text, along with the Sarvasara Upanishad, is one of two dedicated glossaries embedded inside the collection of ancient and medieval era 108 Upanishads, on 29 basic concepts of Hindu philosophy. Niralamba Upanishad defines and explains 29 Upanishadic concepts. It is notable for stating that men, women, all living beings, Hindu gods such as Vishnu and Rudra (Shiva), are in their essence just the same ultimate reality that is Brahman. It is also notable for describing \\"bondage\\" as doing sacrifice rituals and selfishness of any form, and for defining \\"demoniacal\\" as the life of performing fasts or muttering prayers while harboring \\"cruel desire, hatred and hypocrisy\\". The text presents answers resonant with the Advaita Vedanta school of Hinduism. History The Niralamba Upanishad's authorship and date of writing is not known, but it is likely a late medieval text similar to the Muktika Upanishad. Manuscripts of this text are also found titled as Niralambopanisad.Vedic Literature, Volume 1, , Government of Tamil Nadu, Madras, India, pages 436‚Äì437 In the Telugu language anthology of 108 Upanishads of the Muktika canon, narrated by Rama to Hanuman, it is listed at number 34. Contents The Niralamba Upanishad is a glossary of Vedanta terms, after an invocation prayer, opens with asking a series of questions, followed by sequential answers. The questions are asked in the format ‚Äì what is Brahman? who is Ishvara? who is Jƒ´va? what is Prak·πõti and so on. The glossary list of the text includes ParamƒÅ·π≠mƒÅ, BrahmƒÅ, Vish·πáu, Ru·∏çra, Indra, Yama, S≈´rya, Chandra, ·∏åevas, RƒÅkshasas, Pi≈õƒÅchas, Men, Women, Living beings, Fixed objects, Brahmins and others, JƒÅti, Karma, Akarma, J√±ƒÅna, Aj√±ƒÅna, Sukha, Du·∏•kha, Svarga, Naraka, Bandha, Mok·π£a, Upasya, ≈öi·π£ya, VidvƒÅn, Mudha, Asura, ·π¨apas, Paramapada, Grahya, Agrahya and Sa·πÉnyƒÅsƒ´. The text is notable for giving the same answer to sixteen questions. It states all of the following is just one and the same identity called Brahman (ultimate reality), divisions are false ‚Äì Paramatma, Brahma, Vishnu, Rudra, Indra, Yama, Surya, Chandra, Devas, Asuras, Pisachas, men, women, all life creatures, fixed matter, Brahmins and others. The Ishvara and the Jiva are both explained by the Upanishad to be manifestation of Brahman, while Prakriti is explained as Shakti (potency, energy, power) of the Brahman. Jnana in verse 24, says B. R. Rajam Lyer, means knowledge of the truth that the unchanging existence in the Universe is Brahman, who is Chaitanya or consciousness. It is that, asserts the text, which is seer and the seen, all pervading, the realization of the Self that is same in everyone, realized by subduing the senses, by serving the Guru (teacher), and by learning and meditating on Vedantic doctrines. Ajnana is contrasted by the text in verse 25, as the illusion that the Atman (soul, self) within oneself is different from the soul in angels, other living beings, men, women, or because of castes or orders of life, or because something moves and something is fixed, and it is the ignorance that the Atman is different from the all-pervasive Brahman that is the nature of everything. Sukha (happiness) is defined by the text as the state of realizing one's innate bliss, experiencing satcitananda. Dukha (pain) is being driven by the mundane, the state of non-Self, the lack of self-knowledge. Swarga (heaven) is association with spiritual Truth, while Naraka is craving after mundane existence. The verse 30 of this Upanishad, defines Bandha, literally bondage. Any thought process or mental fixation on Ajnana is bondage, states the text. The thought that something is \\"mine\\" eternally is bondage, as is thinking that one can develop eight Siddhis (psychic) powers, the thought of propitiating gods, angels or men is bondage, asserts the Upanishad. Accepting and performing the duties of one's order of life (Ashrama) or caste is bondage, states the text. Seeking knowledge of the rules of sacrificial rituals or rites, making vows or undertaking austerity is bondage. Accepting fear or doubt to be the nature of one's soul is bondage, according to Niralamba Upanishad. The desire for anything, including moksha is bondage. Moksha is defined by the text in verse 31, as abandoning bondage, knowing what is eternal and what is transient, and being in the eternal. The Vidwan, or the learned, states the text, is one who has cognized the unchanging reality of his consciousness that is latent in everyone. The Mudha, literally the ignorant, is one who egoistically conceives that the body or caste or Ashrama or actor or enjoyer or such is what matters. Tapas, states the text is the act of burning in the knowledge that the unchanging truth is Brahman and the universe is Maya. Demoniacal is that, asserts the Upanishad, where one practices austerity and Japa (muttering mantras) while simultaneously living a life that harbors \\"cruel desire, hatred, pain and hypocrisy\\" of any kind. Sannyasi, defines the text, is that person who has given up \\"I and mine\\", who is convinced that \\"I am Brahman\\" and everyone, everything is Brahman, there are no multitudes, there is just oneness.

Overview  The production model uses a single E ink display from E Ink Holdings. The design featured on the design studio's website received attention on the web when it was featured on Wired in July 2015, as well as other technology websites. The Sonder keyboard allows for greater user interaction, by dynamically displaying the current function of the keys. For example, when the user presses the shift key, the pictures would change to upper-case versions. It would also make switching between different keyboard layouts (such as English and Cyrillic) rapid, and could make the switch to alternative layouts such as Dvorak easier for people who only have a QWERTY keyboard with no possibility of rearranging the keys.

Based on the Dodge Viper (VX I), the Force 1 was designed by automobile designer Henrik Fisker. VLF Automotive also partnered with American racing driver and Viper enthusiast Ben Keating during the development of the Force 1, leveraging his experience with the engine. The Force 1 V10 was first unveiled at the 2016 Detroit Auto Show, with the production of the first run of 50 vehicles planned to begin in April 2016. History VLF Automotive is a joint venture between designer Henrik Fisker, former GM Vice Chairman Bob Lutz and businessman Gilbert Villarreal. Lutz and Villarreal began VLF automotive in 2012, and in 2013 unveiled the VLF Destino, a luxury automobile based onFisker's Karma electric car. VLF did away with the Karma's fully electric powertrain and replaced it with the 6.2 L LS6 V8 engine used in the Chevrolet Corvette ZR1. Eventually Fisker joined the team, and VL automotive became VLF automotive. VLF then began work on a new automobile built around the 8.4 L Viper V10 engine, which would become the Force 1 V10. In 2015, Fisker met racing driver and Viper enthusiast Ben Keating. Fisker and VLF partnered with Keating during the development of the Force 1. Keating drew on his Viper racing experience to design the Force 1's active suspension, which makes nearly 10,000 adjustments per second. This results in better traction and a significantly improved ride when compared with the Viper. Design and Specifications =Engine= Force 1 V10's Engine The Force 1 V10 utilizes a 8.4 liter V10 engine used in the fifth generation of the Dodge Viper. The standard output for this engine is and of torque. VLF significantly increased the engine's output for the Force 1, and the engine was now rated at and of torque (an increase of 14% and 5%, respectively). This results in a top speed of and a 0- acceleration time of 3.0 seconds. The engine of the Force 1 V10 is placed between the cabin and the front axle, with the engine's center of mass located behind the front axle. This is meant to improve the vehicle's handling by modifying weight distribution. The Force 1 comes standard with a 6-speed manual transmission, but an optional 6-speed paddle-shift automatic would be available on request. =Body= The Force 1's exterior was designed by Henrik Fisker, known for his work on the design of the BMW Z8 and Aston Martin DB9, among other automobiles. The Force 1 shares many basic design features with other American sports cars, and in particular the Dodge Viper (with which it shares the basic chassis). It features an elongated hood, a long tapered rear section, and protruding wheels, and has a body made entirely of carbon fiber. The Force 1 has a sharp, angled front side which also sports 6 functional intake and outlet vents. The rear of the car is more curved and contains a large outlet vent. Force 1 also features ultra-thin lights at both the front and the rear. The front and roof spoilers, as well as the rear diffuser, are made of exposed, polished carbon fiber. The roof spoiler also contains the on-board wi-fi hotspot antenna and a third brake light. =Interior= The interior is designed for two people and is trimmed in leather, suede and Alcantara. Other features include a milled aluminum and leather gear shifter, leather and suede sunglasses holder, and a hidden milled aluminum pen holder. The Force 1 also features a substantial technology suite, including in-dash navigation, smart phone connectivity and charging, and a wi-fi hotspot housed in the rear spoiler. It is also fitted with a champagne holder, with a two bottle capacity, located between the two seat backs. =Wheels= The Force 1 V10 is fitted with aluminum four-spoke wheels, with a width of in the front and in back. The Pirelli P Zero high performance tires are sized at 305/25/ZR21 in the front with 355/25/ZR21 in the rear. The Force 1 V10 is outfitted with Brembo high performance brakes. Production After debuting at the 2016 Detroit Auto Show, it was announced that an initial run of 50 cars was planned in 2016. The first two units, including the vehicle displayed at the 2016 Detroit Auto Show, took only 10 weeks to build, and Bob Lutz claimed the initial development only required $10 million in investment. Production took place at VLF's Auburn Hills, Michigan manufacturing facility beginning in April 2016. Deliveries were planned for Q3 of 2016. As part of the partnership with Ben Keating, all 50 units would be exclusively be available through Keating's Viper Exchange dealership. Pricing for the Force 1 V10 will start at $286,500. VLF had future plans to distribute both the Force 1 V10 and the VL Destino through a small group of domestic dealerships, though no plans to create exclusive dealerships were made. Only 5 cars were actually produced.

Watching from the sidelines as Mellie performs her bold political act, Liv goes to get an abortion herself. Returning to the White House she and Fitz get into an argument and they break up. Returning home in time for Christmas she has her old, wine-stained, couch thrown out and a new one delivered.

Lenika Cruz writing for The Atlantic praised the understated way in which abortion was worked into the episode, saying that the \\"most remarkable thing about the episode's big moment was how unremarkable it was.\\" The health services organization Planned Parenthood, which was featured heavily in the episode, praised Shonda Rhimes for the episode, releasing a statement that said in part, \\"We applaud Shonda Rhimes tonight‚Äîand every Thursday night‚Äîfor proving that when women are telling our stories, the world will pause and watch.\\" Norman Lear, who created the sitcom Maude, in which the lead character chose to have an abortion after much consideration in an episode that aired in 1972, spoke out in support of the episode, saying that he \\"love[d] the way it was handled\\", while admitting surprise that \\"it was so matter of fact\\". The episode received backlash from right-wing conservative groups such as the Media Research Center who called it ‚Äúsick,‚Äù saying the episode was \\"Hollywood's moral depravity on full display.‚ÄùMany believe that the playing of the song \\"Silent Night\\" during the abortion was almost like the show spitting in the face of Christian beliefs.

Historyhttp://odisha.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/2009/Jan/engpdf/47-49.pdf  Before 1774, Parikud was under the king of Bankad (now Banpur). As Bankara was always attacked by east India Company, Raja of Bankad Sri Harisevak Mansingh first came to Parikud and established his capital known as Nrusinghgarh at Gurubai. Finally Raja Bhagirathi Mansingh shifted his capital to Krishnaprasad and erected the royal palace in the year 1798. British rulers could not attack Parikud due to its location for many years as the region was covered with Chilika lake. There is a folktale suggesting that a milkman who informed the king about the crane killing an eagle, the king was fascinated to shift his capital to Krishnaprasad. The king also donated a village for Brahmins (sasan) which is known as Bhagirathipur Sasan. When the British invaded Odisha from the south in 1803, the traitor Fateh Muhammed, a ferry owner from Kandakhai (Malud) met them on the shores of Chilika. He showed them the eastern route, by which they managed to reach Puri undetected. In, return, Fateh Muhammed was given freehold of the areas of Malud and Parikud, most of which is today called Garh Krishnaprasad block.

Felix Mendelssohn renewed the attention for Bach's music by his performances in the 19th century. In the 20th century Bach's music was performed and recorded by artists specializing in the music of the composer, such as Albert Schweitzer, Helmut Walcha and Karl Richter. With the advent of the historically informed performance practice Bach's music was prominently featured by artists such as Nikolaus Harnoncourt, Gustav Leonhardt and Sigiswald Kuijken. In Bach's time In Bach's time his music was experienced as exceptionally demanding for singers and instrumentalists, while he expected the same virtuosity of them as he could accomplish on organ and other keyboard instruments. That level of virtuosity was deemed \\"impossible\\", especially as he detailed how and with which ornamentation the music was to be executed.Johann Adolf Scheibe. pp. 46‚Äì47 in Critischer Musicus VI, 14 May 1737. =Keyboard= W. F. Bach's Klavierb√ºchlein For his keyboard-playing Bach is largely considered an autodidact. In 1716 Fran√ßois Couperin's L'art de toucher le clavecin had appeared. Bach knew Couperin's harpsichord music: one of his pieces ended up in the Notebook for Anna Magdalena Bach.Bach Digital Work at The Applicatio in C major BWV 994, the first piece in the Klavierb√ºchlein f√ºr Wilhelm Friedemann Bach, is one of a very few instances where Bach indicates fingering.Bach Digital Work at Apart from such minute indications there are no direct descriptions by the composer of how he taught his students to play the keyboard. Generally, however, it is assumed that the indications in L'art de toucher le clavecin are not too far from how Bach played the harpsichord. =Organ= The earliest printed report about Johann Sebastian Bach qualifies him as a \\"famous organist\\".Johann Mattheson. Das Besch√ºtzte Orchestre, oder desselben Zweyte Er√∂ffnung, footnote p. 222 Hamburg: Schiller, 1717. In 1737 Johann Adolf Scheibe gives a description of his organ-playing: \\"[Bach] is as astonishly accomplished. It is hard to understand how wonderful and agile he can manage his fingers and feet to come together and move apart again, making the widest jumps, without a single false note, and without, with such a violent movement, moving his body around.\\" =Continuo= A document written in 1738 documents Bach's ideas about performance of the figured bass., Appendix XII p. 315 =Choir and orchestra= From documents written by Bach in his Leipzig period it can be seen that the expected at least three (but preferably four) singers per voice group in a SATB choir. There were no separate vocal soloists: vocal solo parts were performed by choristers. An orchestra for performing his church music would consist of two to three first violins, and as many second violins, two times two viola players, two cellists, a violone, two to three oboists, one or two bassoons, three trumpets and timpani.Bach, Johann Sebastian. Kurtzer; iedoch h√∂chstn√∂thiger Entwurff einer wohlbestallten Kirchen Music; nebst einigem unvorgreiflichen Bedencken von dem Verfall derselben. Leipzig: Johann Sebastian Bach, 23 August 1730. Retrieved on 17 May 2011 from http://www.bach.de/leben/kirchenmusik.html. The composition of his orchestra varied widely depending on piece, for instance for the Passions there were no trumpets or timpani (while these festive instruments were deemed unsuitable for the time of Lent). Many of his pieces require flutes (traverso and/or recorder), and sometimes more exceptional instruments such as the lute. Four- part chorales and motets were mostly performed with a colla parte instrumentation and/or continuo. Galant period The first decades after the composer's death his music lived on mostly in keyboard music used for teaching by his students. By the time his son Carl Philipp Emanuel wrote his keyboard method the piano was replacing the harpsichord as standard keyboard instrument. Johann Christoph Altnickol, Johann Kirnberger, Johann Friedrich Agricola and Johann Peter Kellner performed Bach's music and taught it to the next generations. Carl Philipp Emanuel and his older brother Wilhelm Friedemann performed their fathers church music in liturgical settings. Also performances in Leipzig under Kantor Doles appear to have been limited to such setting. Public concerts with Bach's music outside a liturgical setting were near to non-existent. Four-part chorales published in this period were stripped of their instrumentation and continuo parts, retaining only the four vocal lines. Classical period By the time the composers of the classical period, such as Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven, encountered Bach's music performance practice had largely changed: keyboard music was performed on the piano, and what little of his vocal music that was still performed was limited to a cappella music. The figured bass was being replaced by written-out scores for all instruments. Bach's larger organ compositions were for the most part untraceable,Johann Nikolaus Forkel. Ueber Johann Sebastian Bachs Leben, Kunst und Kunstwerke: F√ºr patriotische Verehrer echter musikalischer Kunst. Leipzig: Hoffmeister und K√ºhnel. 1802, pp. 59‚Äì60 and likewise his orchestral music and larger vocal compositions remained unperformed. Performances of Bach's music were mostly limited to private salons such as those of Sarah Itzig Levy and Gottfried van Swieten, where for instance Beethoven played excerpts of the Well-Tempered Clavier. Mozart had arranged some of Bach's music for string trio and quartet. The Sing-Akademie zu Berlin, founded in 1791, included some of Bach's music in their public concerts. Romantic period The transformations of the way Bach's music was performed that had taken place in the galant and classical periods were continued in the romantic period: piano instead of harpsichord, motets as a cappella music, etc. With the renewed interest in his larger vocal works and in his orchestral and organ music, also these pieces were adapted to 19th-century performance practices, and contemporary instrumentation. Felix Mendelssohn performed Bach's music on the organ and conducted the first 19th-century performance of the St Matthew Passion: this 1829 performance set off the Bach Revival. Romantic composers featuring Bach's music in their public performances included Franz Liszt and Carl Tausig. =Arrangements= When the Bach Revival resulted in a higher demand for pieces by Bach to be performed in concerts, these were often presented in an arranged version. Organ music, for instance, could be performed in an orchestral arrangement, or as a bravura piano piece.\\"Statistik der Concerte im Saale des Gewandhauses zu Leipzig\\", p. 3, in D√∂rffel, Alfred (1884). Geschichte der Gewandhausconcerte zu Leipzig vom 25. November 1781 bis 25. November 1881: Im Auftrage der Concert-Direction verfasst. Leipzig. Score publications took into account that the music could be performed on the piano,Marx, Adolph Bernhard, editor. Johann Sebastian Bach's noch wenig bekannte Orgelcompositionen: auch am Pianoforte von einem oder zwei Spielern ausf√ºhrbar. Leipzig: Breitkopf & H√§rtel, 1833. and various piano arrangements were published, for instance in the Bach-Busoni Editions. Bach himself rearranged many of his pieces to suit the performing situation. For example, the Prelude to his Partita for solo violin in E Major was transposed down to D Major with the solo violin part given to the organ, with oboes, trumpets, tympani, and strings added to provide the Sinfonia for his Cantata No.29. His Concerto for clavier and strings in F Minor was adapted with the treble line of the clavier arranged for solo violin. And, of course, Bach arranged many concertos by other composers (notably Vivaldi) for organ or harpsichord. As the keyboard works are not specified for harpsichord, being written for the \\"clavier\\" (literally, \\"keyboard\\") any suitable keyboard instrument can be used to perform it and be historically legitimate. =Organ= The build of organs had considerably changed in the 19th century. In the late 19th century Andr√© Pirro published his book on Bach's organ music.Pirro, Andr√© (1895). L'orgue de Jean-S√©bastien Bach. Paris: Fischbacher =Continuo= In the Bach- Gesellschaft Ausgabe, published in the second half of the 19th century, the basso continuo was again rendered as a figured bass. Performance editions, such as those by Robert Franz, expanded the continuo in separate written out parts for multiple instruments. Philipp Spitta, siding with the Bach Ausgabe, disagreed with such overdone expansions of the continuo. =Vocal and instrumental forces= Mendelssohn's performance version of the St Matthew Passion For his 1829 performance of the St Matthew Passion Felix Mendelssohn had produced a performance version of Bach's composition. By this time choirs had more than three or four singers per part, and solo parts were performed by vocal soloists separate from the choir. Also orchestras were larger than the 18 instrumentists Bach mentioned. Some instruments, such as the oboe d'amore, had largely fallen in disuse, or had a modified build compared to the instruments Bach used. Modern approaches In the 20th century performances building on the late romantic performance practices for Bach's music remained standard for a long time, including performance of arrangements, but many more ways of performing and presenting Bach's music were added. =In other genres= Bach's music was often adopted in other genres, for instance in Jazz music, by musicians such as Jacques Loussier, Ian Anderson and Uri Caine and the Swingle Singers. =Organ= Harvey Grace described ways of performing Bach's organ music adapted to the possibilities of 20th-century instruments.Grace, Harvey (1922). The Organ Works of Bach. London: Novello & Co Such instruments were for instance used by G. D. Cunningham, E. Power Biggs and Albert Schweitzer for their performances of Bach's organ music. =Symphonic arrangements= Edward Elgar, Leopold Stokowski and Eugene Ormandy adapted Bach's organ music to full modern symphonic orchestras. =Orchestra, soloists and voices= Orchestral and vocal forces used for performance of Bach's work remained indebted to the romantic tradition for the larger part of the 20th century. =Using modern and alternative instruments= New instruments were deployed for performing Bach's music, for instance performances on the Moog synthesiser by Wendy Carlos. Virtually all of Bach's keyboard music, and much else besides, has been transcribed for one or two guitars. These are often performed on recordings using overdubbing techniques. Historically informed performance practice When Nikolaus Harnoncourt started adopting the historically informed performance practice he prominently featured Bach's music, such as the Brandenburg Concertos and the cantatas. Performers following in that tradition, such as Gustav Leonhardt, Ton Koopman, Philippe Herreweghe and musicians of the Kuijken family invariably had a large part of their repertoire devoted to Bach. =Voices= Peter Kooy and Dorothee Mields became known for their soloist performances of Bach's vocal music such as his Passions.Ellen Segeren. \\"Voor Herreweghe gaat de tijd dringen: 'Ik wil alleen nog topmuziek'\\", pp. 61‚Äì64 in , summer 2010 =Instruments= Wanda Landowska was the first to start performing Bach's keyboard music on harpsichord again. The instrument used by Landowska was however still far from the instruments used in Bach's day. Landowska had the piano manufacturer Pleyel create harpsichords for her to use in performing Bach. These instruments did not follow historical models, and have been derisively called \\"plucking pianos\\". These instruments are more commonly referred to as \\"revival\\" harpsichords, and still have their place in performance today, particularly with modern works expressly written for them. After performing Bach's music on various organs, Marie-Claire Alain had an instrument built closer to the baroque instruments Bach played. =Ensembles= The size of the ensembles performing Bach's music became smaller again: for instance I Musici started performing baroque music, including Bach's with a smaller ensemble again. =Tempo= Performance tempo generally became more vivid than in the period dominated by the romantic approach to the performance of Bach's music. Today the tempos are much more relaxed, in keeping with Baroque performance practice.

About the concepts that appear and are used in these theories to describe the physical world, we are the only known - mathematical relationships that they are satisfy (for example, an electromagnetic radiation, wave-particle duality, spacetime, or an electron). Due to the limitations of our senses capability (for example, from the whole spectrum of electromagnetic radiation the human eye perceives only a small part) and the ability to mislead us (for example, optical illusion), human is forced to use the mathematics as a tool that allows us to not only to compensate the imperfection of our senses, but also to obtain new knowledge, which are not available to our sensory perception. The author brings us to the idea that the physical world, is not what available to us in our sensation, but rather what human-made mathematical theories say.

The Spanish held city of Grave was besieged by a Dutch and English army led by Maurice of Orange and Francis Vere respectively.Markham pp. 338-9 After a siege of nearly two months the city surrendered when a Spanish relief army under Francisco de Mendoza was defeated just outside the city by the besiegers.Wernham pp. 411-12Dalton pp 93-97 The defeat was severe enough to cause a major mutiny in the Spanish army.Duerloo p 130 Background Prince Maurice of Orange had been actively campaigning against the Spanish armies in the Southern Netherlands and had successfully made sure that Ostend then under siege by the Albert of Austria would be a key distraction while he took the rest of the Spanish garrisons that were still in the Republic.Borman pp 230-32 Maurice in his first objective successfully besieged and took Rheinberg an important stronghold on the Rhine from the Spanish in July 1601.Motley pp 60 ‚Äì 61 Meanwhile, Francis Vere had successfully defeated a massive Spanish assault in Ostend in January the same year.Belleroche pp. 58‚Äì60 The veteran Englishman with his troops stuck in Ostend proved an issue - the states general demanded that Vere would be better served in the field with Maurice. After this had been agreed the garrison of Ostend was replaced by fresh troops along with a new governor - Frederick van Dorp.van Nimwegen p 179 Vere left in March and was back in the field with a large portion of English troops (many newly recruited) numbering 8,000 men and many of them veterans from the siege at Ostend. At p 233 On arriving at the Hague, Vere at once joined the army of Maurice and as soon as both forces had assembled which then numbered nearly 20,000 men, they crossed the Waal at Nijmegen, and the Maas at Mook, advanced thence into the heart of Brabant. Maurice found his progress towards Tienen opposed by Francisco L√≥pez de Mendoza, who was strongly entrenched - he refused to be tempted out while Maurice refused to engage or pass while leaving a large force in his rear. Maurice then turned back to the north with the intention of besieging Grave or Venlo; the former was chosen. Grave was an important town on the Maas and had been captured in 1586 by Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma and from then was under Spanish control. Grave's defences were steadily improved and was completely surrounded with field fortifications making any frontal assault out of the question. Siege By mid July the Dutch and English forces had marched towards the city of Grave; the right wing composed of the English foot commanded by Sir Francis Vere, the centre corps by the Count William Louis and the left by Count Ernest of Nassau. The Commentaries of Vere showed that the army moved in three columns on as many contiguous lines of march. The defenders of the city numbered over 1,500 Spanish and Italian soldiers under the command of Don Antonio Gonzalez and were hoping to hold out for more than two months before a relief column could arrive.Nederlands instituut voor militaire historie: 18 July - 20 September 1602: Siege of Grave (Dutch)Wap p 167 At the same time a detached number of Spanish forces led by Mendoza and Ambrosio Spinola pursued Maurice but undeterred the besiegers pressed on towards Grave. Francisco de Mendoza On 18 July the Anglo-Dutch force had arrived, surrounded Grave and soon dug in around the city - laying and constructing a trench system. The now besieged tried to bring in as many reinforcements as possible but this was in vain when it was cut off. The Dutch and English siege positions were large in scale with every redoubt having its own wet ditch and drawbridge, and of which took nearly five hours to complete a circuit.Duffy p 93 The Spanish garrison in the city were in the hope that there would be relief relied on from nearby Venlo under Francisco Mendoza who had arrived with a force in late July.Black p. 113 Mendoza went out with the aim of relieving Grave but soon discovered the significant size of the Dutch and English besieging force when the leading part of the Spanish column ran into strong positions and were repelled with loss.(Dutch) The city garrison on hearing the news of Mendoza close by at the same time made several unsuccessful sallies on the besieging army wasting men and supplies. This abruptly stopped when they heard news that the Mendoza's troops were forced to turn back to Venlo in late August; mutinies also played their part in the Spanish retreat. During the relief attempt Vere was inspecting the English trenches when heavy fighting broke out as a sally was launched on the position. The Spanish were repelled but Vere was severely injured when a bullet went through his head beneath his eye and became embedded in his skull. For Vere it would be the end of the war but the bullet was removed as he took up rest in Ryswick and was not able to take to the field again by the end of the year. As a consequence of Vere's wound the young Frederick Henry who was only eighteen years old took over Vere's command, while Horace Vere (brother to Francis) took over the English troops in the field. The Earl of Leicester arrived at the siege in late August in case Francis' wound was mortal and needed to fill in his command but this was denied by Queen Elizabeth I. At the beginning of September the besiegers were running into trouble as the water levels from the Mass caused by heavy rains began to rise rapidly.Motley pp. 103-05 Before long it had risen so quickly that Maurice even considered raising the whole siege altogether and pondered to make a hasty retreat - he and made calls for the garrison to surrender.van Nimwegen p 182 Luckily for Maurice the Grave garrison was on it knees and on 20 September Gonzalez accepted Maurice's terms and surrendered. Breakout of diseases, rising waters, a severe lack of food and news that the relief force had been turned back which as a result initiated a large mutiny meant that the Spanish had no choice. Siege of Grave in 1602 - from a print by Simon Fokke Aftermath Maurice of Orange After a total of sixty days and with the siege over, the Spanish army were allowed to leave with arms and colours and the Dutch and English entered Grave triumphantly the following day. On 28 September Maurice was inaugurated as count of the country in Grave in a building of its suburbs that in 1559 was given to his father, William of Orange. With the failure of the break up of the siege, a mutiny broke out amongst the Spanish troops because of arrears of pay and about 1,200 soldiers deserted in Venlo. As a force they captured Hamont and then fled to Hoogstraten with the rest of the Spanish troops on their heels before making a deal with Maurice. In the terms given to the mutineers by Maurice Grave was to be garrisoned by them and kept in their hands before being returned to Dutch control by the end of 1603. While Grave surrendered Maurice heard the news that Albert's troops were making no progress in the siege at Ostend. The following year was one of indecision by both Maurice and the states general. In addition the death of Elizabeth and the crowning of King James I of England put operations on hold whilst Grand pensionary Johan van Oldenbarnevelt made talks with the English court and parliament. The talks however got nowhere and the campaign resumed in 1603 with Ostend still under siege. Maurice managed to retake Wachtendonk in March 1603 and Sluis in the Southern Netherlands in August 1604, but the Spanish forces despite suffering heavy losses did not raise the siege of Ostend and it capitulated in September 1604. Grave would stay in Dutch hands for the rest of the war ad was garrisoned largely by English troops until 1648.Dunthorne1 p 52 References ;Citations Bibliography       * (Dutch)   External Links  Tercios.org (Spanish) Category:Sieges involving Spain Category:Sieges involving England Category:Sieges involving the Dutch Republic Category:1602 in Europe Category:Conflicts in 1602 Category:1602 in the Dutch Republic ","title":"Siege of Grave (1602)"},{"id":"49403925","text":"Dananshan Qianhai and Dananshan (right) as viewed from Xiaonanshan The Nanshan Mountains or Nanshan are a set of mountains in Shenzhen.

The battle occurred in what is now the city of Nagaoka, in Niigata Prefecture.  Background  At the final years of the Tokugawa shogunate, the army of Nagaoka Domain underwent reformation. Under the leadership of senior retainer Kawai Tsugunosuke, the Nagaoka army was organized based on the British Army at the time. When fighting broke out in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi on January 27, 1868, over 60 Nagaoka soldiers were stationed to protect Tamatsu bridge near Osaka Castle. However, at the defeat of the shogunate's forces in the battle, these soldiers were among those who returned to their respective domains. After the battle, Kawai went to Edo. Planning to amass enough strength to counter the pro-imperial forces, he purchased large numbers of firearms for Nagaoka troops. Moreover, being influenced by the Monroe Doctrine from the United States, Kawai began to advocate a stance of armed neutrality for the domain from both the shogunate and imperial forces. When the imperial government-general of Hokuriku ordered Nagaoka to send troops and funds for their forces, Kawai ignored the command. This was seen as a problem, and when Edo Castle fell on May 4 of the same year, imperial troops immediately advanced towards northern Echigo province, part of which was controlled by the domain. Soon after, Takakura Nagasachi, a court noble, was appointed to lead the imperial forces that were to pacify the Hokuriku region and subjugate Aizu Domain in nearby Mutsu province. With him, Kuroda Kiyotaka and Yamagata Aritomo were appointed staff officers. Upon gathering in Takada in Echigo, the army was divided into a land force and a naval force, both of which then advanced towards Nagaoka on May 13. The domain appointed Kawai as overseer of military affairs in response, and invited troops from Aizu and Kuwana domains, and the Sh≈çh≈çtai to form what would become an allied army. On June 29, Enoki Pass, which led to the west of Nagaoka, was taken by forces of the combined army, marking the first action in the campaign. A day after, a battle for the control of Mt. Asahi to the south ended in an allied victory. Tokiyama Naohachi, a samurai from Ch≈çsh≈´ Domain, was killed in action in the fighting. However, Nagaoka Castle fell to imperial forces on July 8; it was later retaken by the allied army.  Battle  On August 10, a little less than 300 Nagaoka soldiers of the conducted a surprise attack on imperial forces stationed at Hatch≈çoki. Although the ambush was seen as a victory, 11 soldiers were killed in action. Sensing a counterattack, Kawai devised another strategy and on September 10, a month later, 17 platoons numbering about 680 soldiers were ferried across Hatch≈çoki in six hours and, upon arriving at the other side, staged a surprise attack at Nagaoka Castle. The soldiers immediately attacked, reaching so far as the land around the fortifications, repelling imperial forces led by Yamagata Aritomo, and recaptured the castle. However, imperial troops fought back, resulting in 62 Nagaoka soldiers dead. Kawai was wounded in the fighting; he was shot, rendering him unable to walk. The attack itself was not enough for the imperial forces to retake the castle, but the tables were turned against Nagaoka when nearby Shibata Domain switched allegiance to the new government, allowing the imperial army to lay siege to Nagaoka Castle once again. On September 15, the castle once again surrendered to imperial forces. Nagaoka soldiers fought valiantly, but ended up losing 58 more people in the battle. The remaining defenders accompanied the wounded Kawai, who was carried on a stretcher, as they fled to Aizu. Crossing Hachij≈´rigoe pass, they reached Aizu lands on September 20. At Aizu, Kawai received treatment from Dr. Matsumoto Ry≈çjun for his wounds, but he later succumbed to his wounds on October 1.  References  * Shin jinbutsu ≈çraisha , ed. (2000).

The exhibition displayed some 1850 individual works by architects, artists, craftsmen and businesses and attracted 650.000 visitors. The project was a large undertaking for the city with long-lasting effects on cultural institutions and short-term economic problems. The exhibition fairgrounds was named The white City (Danish: Den HVide By) based on the architectural expression chosen by the leading architect Anton Rosen. The exhibition was generally received well in the press and was widely considered a success. Although it ran over budget, resulted in significant economic losses and it did not accrue the expected economic benefits to local businesses the exhibition had both more visitors and revenue than projected. Historians have since discussed if it had any benefits to the city but it can be said to have cemented Aarhus as the leading provincial city in Denmark at least in the minds of its people.  Prelude  The large industry and crafts exhibitions started in France where yearly art salons had been held since the 1600s. The terror of the French Revolution in 1789 dampened the French economy and it became necessary to strengthen trade and industry so in 1797 a large exhibition was held in the Louvre. The following year the exhibition moved to a separate area with buildings constructed for the purpose which was the beginning of the large national exhibitions. Industry exhibitions soon popped up across Europe with some 150 national and regional exhibitions being held up to the mid-1800s. In 1851 England held The Great Exhibition, the first World Exposition, which became an annual tradition. The large exhibitions across Europe left an impression in Denmark and from the early 1800s a number of large and small exhibitions were held primarily in Copenhagen. The first was held in 1810 but the first major success was in 1852 when an exhibition was held on the grounds of Christiansborg Palace. The Danish state contributed economically and the exhibition achieved 100.000 visitors in 3 months. Several large exhibitions in Copenhagen followed including the Nordic Exhibition of 1888. In the rest of the country other cities and towns followed the trend. In 1833 and 1834 the council chambers in Aarhus hosted small arts and crafts exhibitions and 1852 the Craftmen's Association held a larger exhibition on Fredens Torv in a building constructed for the purpose. In 1876 a larger exhibition was held in Vennelystparken where a dedicated building complex had been erected. The exhibition was opened by King Christian IX and it was the first major exhibition outside Copenhagen. Around the turn of the century discussions opened to host another large event during the tri-decennial anniversary of the 1876 exhibition. Preparation were underway but in 1904 it was decided to hold an exhibition for Jutland in Horsens in 1906. It was agreed that another regional exhibition in Aarhus so soon after was impractical so plans were changed to instead host a larger national exhibition in 1909. The effort won wide support in the city and wider region but in Copenhagen the media was more split on the issue. Particularly the newspaper Politiken was a vocal opponent and preferred a national exhibition be held in the capital over the smaller cities in Jutland. In the end the plans for an event in Copenhagen didn't work out and Aarhus won support from the state. Aarhus Municipality supported the exhibition with DKK 300.000, the state gave DKK 150.000 and a number of companies and individuals provided an additional guarantee of DKK 300.000 to cover any losses.  Construction  Anton Rosen on a balcony overlooking the Garden Hall during the construction phase. The architect Anton Rosen was commissioned to organize the exhibition since he had experience from events in Odense in 1900 and Haslev in 1906. Rosen was given free rein to decide where the fairgrounds should be placed. He selected an area of 70 acres by the coast south of the city and north of the Marselisborg Forests where present day Strandparken and Tangkrogen is situated. The location had the Bay of Aarhus, forest and city within view which provided a scenic canvas for architects to display their works. The location was ideal from an artistic standpoint but it was also more expensive; roads had to be redirected and the expansion of the nearby Port of Aarhus was put on standby. The planning for the project took 4 years and required thousands of workers that came from across Jutland to work on it. The large area was developed from a basic field to a planned town with a number of large halls, gardens, amusement park and other projects. To accommodate the many guests the newly built Skansepal√¶et was turned into a hotel with 210 rooms, 430 beds and a caf√© on the ground floor with a view over the fairgrounds. In the Marselisborg Forests the restaurant Varna Pal√¶et was constructed and on Dalgas Avenue and Marselisvej 9 villas were built to demonstrate the best architecture and crafts of the time. In the final days before the opening a number of accidents threatened the project. On 16 May the designer and decorator Valdemar Andersen fell from a scaffold and suffered injuries preventing him from finishing his works. On 17 May a powerful storm flooded the fairgrounds and left foul smelling seaweed behind. The windows in the large exhibition halls were broken and most items had to have been covered in tarps for protection. During the night of 18 May 3000 workers were called in to make repairs and lay out wooden walkways across the flooded areas. However, the exhibition was opened as planned.

The two largest halls, the Vault Hall (Buehallen) and the Column Hall (S√∏jlehallen), were situated by the main entrance and showcased crafts, industry and furniture design. Accessible from the two large halls was the centerpiece of the exhibition, the iconic Electricity Tower (Danish: Elektricitetst√•rnet), depicted on many posters and other promotional art. Other halls included Machine Hall showing industrial machines, the Transport Hall focused on cars and trucks, a hall containing the art exhibit and a building housing the Post and Telegraph Agency and various municipal institutions. The Ceremonial Hall was used for the opening ceremony, the lotteries and other official events. Along with the large show halls there was a number of pavilions such as the white Press Pavilion and Politiken's pavilion showing a printing press in action. Outdoor exhibitions included the fishery with an adjacent restaurant, an area for gardening and agriculture and an area with crafts and culture items from Greenland. Tuborg had erected a large Triumphal arch at one end of a basin facing a pagoda pavilion at the other end. For a fee there was admittance to a separate amusement park with carousels, swings, a dance hall, a cinema and an artificial Abyssinian village. Outside the fairgrounds across Dalgas Avenue was an area with changing exhibits featuring cattle and riding shows, gymnastics, dog and rabbit shows and balloon displays. Architectural displays was a central element of exhibitions at the time and a separate Station Town had been erected to showcase best practices in construction and architecture. It was modeled to be an ideal small railway town and was complete with dairy, railway station, pharmacy, community centre and other structures. Additional villas had been constructed on nearby roads some of which were awarded as prizes in lotteries. = Participating architects = * Anton Rosen (manager) ‚Äì (Politiken's pavilion, elektricity tower, portal). * Einar Ambt * Gustav Bartholin Hagen * Peder Vilhelm Jensen-Klint ‚Äì (Town smithy) * Thorvald J√∏rgensen * Hack Kampmann ‚Äì (Planning for the Station Town) * Jens Christian Kofoed * Sophus Frederik K√ºhnel * Sven Risom ‚Äì (Clog-makers house) * Heinrich Wenck Jylland  Historical Exhibit  The exhibition was mainly focused on the machines and products of industrialization and the modern architectural styles but some historical elements had been included. The half-timbered Secherske g√•rd (English: Secher's House) from 1597 was disassembled piece by piece and erected on the fairgrounds where it showcased the lives of the upper classes in the past centuries with young women dressed in traditional folk costumes serving coffee and waiting on visitors. The steam frigate had been decommissioned in 1888 and was scheduled to be broken up in 1908 but was instead saved, restored and placed in the Bay of Aarhus in front of the fairgrounds as a scenic display.  Abyssinian Camp  The exhibition of 1909 featured a curiosity in the form of an imitation African village complete with a group of 80 Abyssinian people from present day Ethiopia. The village was one of the major attractions of the exhibition. It consisted of straw huts, workshops and imitation palm trees. The village was situated by the coast in the amusement park, neighboring the exhibits about the Danish overseas colonies in Greenland and the West Indies. The village was part of a cultural phenomenon in the 19th century with displays of \\"exotic peoples\\". In the late 1800s more than 50 such displays took place in Denmark, most in Copenhagen in Tivoli, the Zoo and the Circus Building, but a small number did come to the smaller Danish cities. Vennelystparken hosted a Nubian caravan in 1880, Sami in 1888, Indians in 1901, Japanese in 1902 and finally the Abyssinians in 1909.  Danish-American Day  Prince Christian and Niels Neergaard during Danish-American Day On 4 July 1909 a Danish-American Day was celebrated. In 1905 the Danish-American editor Ivar Kierkegard had suggested that American Independence Day should be celebrated every year with a festival in Denmark for Danish immigrants and their ancestors in the United States. Max Henius, the leader of the Danish-American Society established in 1906, realized the plans and the first meeting was held in 1909 in Aarhus during the exhibition. In spite of the long journey by sea some 1200 Danish-Americans arrived on the ocean steamer C.F. Tietgen. The city was decorated with Danish and American flags and the facade of the Art Hall was decorated with the same Stars and Stripes that had been used at the main entrance of the St. Louis World's Fair in 1904. The meeting became the precursor to the annual Rebild Festival every year on 4 July in north Jutland.  Legacy  The Old Town Museum The exhibition had a number of long-lasting effects. The immediate aftermath was economic depression in Aarhus as many local leading businesses and businessmen had incurred significant losses and couldn't invest in the city for some years. The period after the exhibition was a time of growth in the other major provincial cities of Aalborg, Odense and Esbjerg but Aarhus struggled for almost 6 years. However, long-term the exhibition had a significant cultural impact and resulted in a number of prominent landmarks. The Old Town Museum was established with Secher's House, also known as the Mayors House, as the first building with Peter Holm as its first director. The museum has since grown to a major visitor attraction and a neighborhood in its own right. Initially the Mayors House was left standing on the former fairgrounds for almost 5 years but in 1914 Peter Holm managed to collect the funds to have it moved and to establish the museum. During the 2009 centennial of the exhibition Politiken's pavilion, colloquially known as \\"The Inkwell\\" (Danish: Bl√¶khuset), was rebuilt in The Old Town. It had previously been moved to N√¶rum on Zealand where it was used as a communal building for allotments. The pavilion today houses the exhibition hall of the Danish Poster Museum and is a part of the museum's 1950s neighborhood which was built in the 2010s. Varnapal√¶et in Marselisborg Forests The exhibition cemented Aarhus as the largest provincial city and psychologically gave it a characteristic self- confidence. When Copenhagen built its first stadium in 1916 Aarhus followed shortly by building the Atletion stadium in 1920 and Aarhus University was established in 1928 almost 40 years before universities were opened in other provincial cities. The logo of Aarhus university features two dolphins referencing the dolphin depicted on the 1909 exhibition seal. In the city Varna Pal√¶et by Eggert Achen and Skansepal√¶et by Hjalmar Kj√¶r remains the most visible artifacts. Varna Pal√¶et is home to a restaurant in the Marselisborg Forests and Skansepal√¶et marks the boundary of the dense city center and the larger and more expansive planned developments of later years. The former site of the exhibition is today the public park Tangkrogen on the waterfront and is still used for larger public events. The exhibition had implications outside Aarhus as well. The Rebild Festival was started by the many Danish-American visitors and remains an annual recurring event on the 4th of July celebrating the American Independence Day and the homecoming of Danish emigrants. The Frigate Jutland was moved to Ebeltoft in 1960 where it was restored and is today on permanent display in a dry dock as a visitor attraction. The buildings given as prizes at the exhibition lotteries are still in use today. The villas remain on Marselisvej while the farm house designed by Hack Kampmann was won by a farmer who moved it to Aars where it remains largely intact today.  Significance  Historians are divided on the long-term significance of the exhibition. Johan Bender ses it as an important moment in the development of Aarhus into the primary city in Jutland over Viborg or Aalborg. The exhibition underlined the leading position of the city in Jutland and it was part of the reason why the first university outside Copenhagen was established there and not in Viborg. Historian Erik Korr Johansen has pointed out that the economy of Aarhus suffered in the decades after 1910, that the relative advantage in population growth was diminished and that the central position of the city had already been cemented with the central location on the railroad. The motives are also opaque and have been interpreted differently. According to Erik Korr Johansen industrial businesses had already lost interest in the large exhibitions with the growing importance of advertising and that the exhibition in 1909 was primarily supported by local craftsmen. Johan Bender stresses the agreements and work done across political divides and the identity and historical consciousness in Aarhus resulting from the event. Jens Engberg also consider the organisational and political cooperation of the crafts and employers around 1900 to be important. The banks, industry and crafts worked together against trade unions, the Social Democratic Party and the burgeoning cooperatives. The white city was a prestige project which employers could find common ground in to create a temporary united front against the new political ideas of the 20th century.

This is a war against all forms of corruption in Nigeria. During the president's election campaign in 2015, he vowed to fight against corruption and insecurity if elected. Since his election in April 2015, anti-graft war remain one of his topmost priority. The anti-graft war was endorsed by the President of the United States. The United States Secretary of State, John Kerry at the World Economic Forum held at Davos in Switzerland extolled Buhari's anti-graft war. In October 2015, the United Kingdom pledge her support for Buhari's anti- corruption war. According to Grant Shapps, the minister for international development, \\"UK is fully committed to helping Nigeria increase its security, stability and prosperity. \\"We would continue to provide capacity building, technical and investigative support to Nigeria to tackle corruption. Corruption in Nigeria also affects the UK directly. Where we have evidence, we will continue to take action to protect the integrity of the UK's financial system and prevent. Some Nigerian described the war as \\"perfect\\" while others described it as \\"selective\\". William Kumuyi, the founder and general overseer of Deeper Christian Life Ministry described Buhari's anti-corruption war as a step in right direction. However, the president has been criticized and accused of leading a selective war against corruption. Several people claimed that his war against corruption focus on members of the opposition party, the People's Democratic Party. In May 2018, the Nigerian Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) announced that 603 Nigerian figures had been convicted on corruption charges since Buhari took office in 2015.https://allafrica.com/stories/201805290530.html The EFCC also announced that for the first time in Nigeria's history, judges and top military officers including retired service chiefs are being prosecuted for corruption. The successful prosecutions were also credited to EFCC head Ibrahim Magu Under Buhari, Chief Justice of the Nigerian Court Walter Onnoghen was convicted by the Code of Conduct Tribunal on April 18, 2019 for false assets declaration. and accused Federal High Court Judge Adeniyi Ademola resigned involuntarily in December 2017https://allafrica.com/stories/201712080071.html In December 2019, the country's controversial ex-Attorney General Mohammed Adoke, who was accused of being bribed to grant oil licenses to Shell, was extradited to back Nigeria from Dubai and was immediately arrested.http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-12/20/c_138646834.htmFormer Nigerian attorney general arrested, to face corruption charges In May 2020, it was revealed that Chinese construction entrepreneurs Meng Wei Kun and Xu Koi were arrested in Sokoto State on corruption charges involving bribes to former government officials in Zamfara State.https://www.africanews.com/2020/05/13/nigeria-arrests-chinese- over-250k-cash-bribe-for-corruption-cover-up// Criticisms On 24 January 2016, Chief Olu Falae, a prominent Nigerian politician and former secretary to the Federal Government of Nigeria said \\"Buhari's anti-corruption war is selective and getting out of hand\\". Olu falae was named as one of the beneficiaries of the controversial $2 billion arms deal, an allegation he refuted in an exclusive interview with The Punch. On 24 August 2015, Abdulkadir Balarabe Musa, a former governor of Kaduna State challenged President Muhammadu to probe his military regime between 1983 and 1985 if he is really serious about anti-corruption war. He accused the president of violation of federal character law. On 8 February 2016, Ezenwo Nyesom Wike, the governor of Rivers State and former minister of state for education in the Cabinet of President Goodluck Jonathan accused the president of bias in his anti-corruption war. He said he would rather fight corruption in his own way than to support Muhammadu Buhari's anti-corruption war. On 27 September 2015, Dr. Frederick Fasehun, the founder of Oodua Peoples Congress advised the president to shun selective justice and focus on good governance. On 21 January 2016, Fasheun urged the president to slow down in his fight against corruption saying that the government may run into problems in the way the anti-graft war is been handled by the president. He strongly condemned the handcuffing of Chief Olisa Metuh, the National Publicity Secretary of the People's Democratic Party. He described it as unhealthy for Nigeria. In a report titled \\"Heavy Knocks For Buhari‚Äôs Anti-Corruption\\" published by Sahara Reporters on 31 October 2015, Debo Adeniran, the Executive Chairman of the Coalition Against Corrupt Leaders claimed he had on several occasions, petitioned the president and the anti-graft agencies, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission and Independent Corrupt Practices Commission levying corruption and misappropriation of fund against Babatunde Fashola, a former governor of Lagos State and the incumbent Minister for Power, Works and Housing in the Cabinet of President Muhammadu Buhari. He also mentioned that several allegation of corruption and misappropriation of fund were slammed on Kayode Fayemi, the former governor of Ekiti State, Kemi Adeosun, the incumbent minister of finance, Rotimi Amaechi, a former governor of Rivers State and current minister of transport. He expressed concern on why these people had not been invited by the anti-graft agencies for questioning. He said \\"We are dissatisfied with the way the anti-corruption war is being fought and we are afraid that we may not achieve anything better than what we had before Buhari assumed office.\\" In January 2016, Bishop Hyacinth Oroko Egbebo of Apostolic Vicariate of Bomadi , during the consecration of a Catholic priest under his vicariate, expressed concern over what he described as \\"high level of impunity and abuse of human rights in the anti-corruption war of President Muhammadu Buhari\\". He accused Buhari of selective anti-graft war. He raised a concern over how Buhari disobeys court order in his fight against corruption. He said \\"In as much as we would want to commend President Buhari on his zero tolerance on corruption, it is very disheartening and a risk to our democracy that the President would have the impunity to set aside court orders under the guise of his anti-corruption war\\". In January 2016, Carol Ajie, a constitutional lawyer petitioned President Barack Obama and National Judicial Council over the disobedience of court order by President Muhammadu Buhari in his fight against corruption. She called for Buhari's resignation or face impeachment proceedings. The petition was signed by over 200 lawyers in the country. As of January 2020, Nigeria ranks low in Transparency International's corruption perception index, achieving a rank of 146 out of 180 countries surveyed.https://www.channelstv.com/2020/01/23/transparency-international- scores-nigeria-low-on-corruption-perception- index/https://www.thecable.ng/breaking-nigeria-ranks-lower-on-transparency- internationals-corruption-index Cases reported Sambo Dasuki, the National Security Adviser who allegedly masterminded the $2 billions arms deal On 3 June 2015, Senator Ali Modu Sheriff, the former governor of Borno State was arrested by the anti-graft agency, EFCC on alleged misappropriation of 300 billion naira received from the federation account during his tenure as governor of Borno State, between 2003 and 2011. Although the investigation began in 2012 but was intensified in April 2015. Premium Times reported that Sheriff surrendered himself to the EFCC for questioning and was released on bail on 4 June 2015 according to Wilson Uwujaren, the anti-graft agency's spokesperson. Sheriff denied reports in the media that he was declared wanted, arrested and detained by the EFCC. According to Daily Post, a Nigerian newspaper, Sheriff said \\"I was never invited, the EFCC never said they were declaring me wanted. It was the reports in the media that attracted my attention and I paid EFCC a visit. There was nothing about N300 billion.\\" Sanusi Lamido Sanusi, the Emir of Kano and former governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria exposed part of the illegal oil deals during the administration of President Goodluck Jonathan. He raised concern over the failure of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation to deposit the sum of $20 billion of oil revenues into the federation account. Diezani Alison-Madueke, the former minister of Petroleum resources named all the persons involved in the deal and others in the controversial concession of oil wells, Jide Omokore and Kola Aluko were named. Jide Omokore had volunteered to return the sum of $500 million to the federation account. In June 2015, six top officials of the Central Bank of Nigeria and 16 other employees of commercial banks were arrested by the anti-graft agency, the EFCC over 8 billion naira currency scam. They were sacked and arraigned before a Federal High Court sitting in Ibadan, Oyo State, from Tuesday, June 2, 2015, to Thursday, June 4, 2015. They were sacked and imprisoned. In June 2015, President Buhari ordered the EFCC to reopen the $182m Halliburton bribery case following a request by the Federal government of the United States. The U.S government said about $140 million recovered by the government would be repatriated to Nigeria if those involved in the scandal were arrested and prosecuted. The $2 billion arms deal was exposed following the interim report of Buhari's investigations committee on arms procurement under the Goodluck Jonathan administration. The committee report showed extra-budgetary spending to the tune of N643.8 billion and additional spending of about $2.2 billion in the foreign currency component under the Goodluck Jonathan's watch. Preliminary investigation suggested that about $2 billion may have been disbursed for the procurement of arms to fight against Boko Haram insurgency in Nigeria. The investigative report indicated that a total sum of $2.2 billion was inexplicably disbursed into the office of the National Security Adviser in procurement of arms to fight against insurgency, but was not spent for the purpose for which the money was disbursed. Investigations on this illegal deal led to the arrest of Sambo Dasuki, the former National Security Adviser who later mentioned prominent Nigerians involved in the deal. Those who were mentioned and arrested includes Raymond Dokpesi, the Chair Emeritus of DAAR Communications Plc, Attahiru Bafarawa, the former Governor of Sokoto State, and Bashir Yuguda, the former Minister of State for Finance, Azubuike Ihejirika, the Chief of Army Staff, Adesola Nunayon Amosu, the former Chief of the Air Staff, Alex Badeh and several other politicians were mentioned.

Over the next three years two things caught his interest, Positivism and the Socialist Community of Modern Times an anarchist intentional community based on Long Island, New York State. On 9 April 1854 he decided to commit his life to the propagation of the \\"positivist faith\\" consecrating his life to \\"laying the foundation stone\\" to the Comtean edifice in the New World. Although originally attracted to the Fourierist community in Red Bank, New Jersey, he stayed there for only a few months. He eventually moved to Modern Times in 1854 for the purposes of spreading positivism. He built an oratory with a steeple attached to his log cabin, and conducted the Comtean religious rites. He further organised a glee club and an orchestra. However aside from his friends John Metcalf and Charles Codman, his efforts to spread positivism had little impact outside his family. He also started a long series of correspondence with Comte which continued until the latter's death in 1857. Although his attempts to spread positivism amongst the inhabitants of Modern Times met with little success, and indeed encountered the hostility of its founder Josiah Warren, it nevertheless provided a base from which Edger could promote Positivism further afield. With his convert, John Metcalf, he provided a range of Positivist reading material available by mail including Modern Times, the Labor question, and the Family which he written himself. In 1880 Edger left Modern Times and moved to Paris, where he died in 1888.

It asserts that if K is a nonempty convex closed bounded set in uniformly convex Banach space and f is a mapping of K into itself such that \\\\f(x)-f(y)\\\\\\\\leq\\\\x-y\\\\ (i.e. f is non-expansive), then f has a fixed point. History Following the publication in 1965 of two independent versions of the theorem by Felix Browder and by William Kirk, a new proof of Michael Edelstein showed that, in a uniformly convex Banach space, every iterative sequence f^nx_0 of a non-expansive map f has a unique asymptotic center, which is a fixed point of f. (An asymptotic center of a sequence (x_k)_{k\\\\in\\\\mathbb N}, if it exists, is a limit of the Chebyshev centers c_n for truncated sequences (x_k)_{k\\\\ge n}.) A stronger property than asymptotic center is Delta-limit of Teck-Cheong Lim, which in the uniformly convex space coincides with the weak limit if the space has the Opial property.

Cyanogen is a simple molecule of one carbon atom and one nitrogen atom, with absorption bands around wavelengths 388.9 and . This group of stars was first noticed in certain G and K-type giants by J. J. Nassau and W. W. Morgan in 1949, then a further 4,150 were identified by Nancy G. Roman in 1952. They can be distinguished from barium stars by the lack of s-process elements, and from other types of luminous stars by the general weakness of features other than the CN lines. The excess strength of the CN bands is classified by a positive index with increments of 0.5. A value of zero indicates a normal star and is not listed in the stellar class, while the peak value of 4 is essentially similar to a carbon star.

The great fire was the greatest catastrophe in the town's history apart from the invasion by Swedish troops that took place in the context of the Thirty Years' War two centuries earlier. Events The fire was discovered between 9 and 10 in the morning in the storage barn of a toy maker called Joseph Scherbaum.Johann Brunner, Max Glei√üner: Geschichte der Stadt Tirschenreuth. Tirschenreuth 1982, p. 268. The cause of the fire is unclear, although the toy maker's wife was spotted heating her oven in the morning and it is possible that sparks from this action somehow ignited the surrounding building which went up in flames very quickly. Rising smoke was spotted from the church tower by the town's two watchmen. They immediately sounded the fire bell and hung a banner from the church tower pointing towards the direction from which the smoke was coming. Within a short time fire spread from the blacksmith's house to the nearby properties. With just a few fire buckets and a small pump there was no realistic prospect of stopping the fire, and people concentrated on rescuing their families, livestock and living necessities, and moving these to the safety of the meadow by the Fish Hall, no longer on an island, but set on parkland which until a drainage project undertaken in 1808 had been a huge pond. After the fire had raged for four hours the town was almost entirely destroyed. An exception was the priest's house and three small neighbouring houses. Half of the Church of the Ascension of the Virgin Mary also survived, but the timber interior of the tower was burned out. Outside the town the Fish Hall also survived.Max Glei√üner: Chronik von T√ºrschenreut. Missionsbuchhandlung St. Peter, Tirschenreuth 1983, pp. 48 & 50. A total of 907 buildings were destroyed by the fire, made up of 307 houses and 600 sheds or other outbuildings. Rapid spreading of the fire had been exacerbated by the narrowness of the streets the through closeness of the buildings to one another, squeezed between the town wall on one side and the remains of two large recently drained bodies of water on two other sides. Aftermath The years following the fire were years of hunger. Tirschenreuth was rebuilt, but the outcome differed significantly from what had been there before. The gable frontages that had been a feature of the houses round the market place were omitted, and the town hall was also rebuilt without its old gables and roof window towers. The town's old castle was not rebuilt at all. On 28 January 1819 the town was able to celebrate its rebuilding. The total amount collected across Bavaria to support the project had been around 42,000 guilders, including 1,000 guilders from the king, who also donated approximately 12,000 tree trunks from the Royal forests to be used for the reconstruction.

The writers Guillermo and Alberto Blest Gana were born out of Guillermo Blest's first marriage. The upper class Blest Gana family did not had major contact with the Blest Ugarte family, and this last family lived in a rather austere manner.Echeverr√≠a, pp. 34‚Äì41 Blest coursed primary school at a public school. Later he joined Seminario Pontificio de Santiago thanks to relatives who ceded to him a scholarship aimed for the main branch of the Blest family. He was interned nine years in the seminary.

From divinity school dropout to union leader (1921‚Äì1938) In 1921 when Blest returned to Santiago his mother was school director, his sister Leopoldina studied in Escuela Normalista, and his brother Fernando continued a military career. Given his family's economic problems, Blest decided to work instead of studying at university.Echeverr√≠a, p. 61. It was in this period that Blest learned about Luis Emilio Recabarren whose talks and conferences he followed. Blest was influenced by the ideas of Recabarren whom he referred to as ‚Äúthe greatest and most genuine representative of the Chilean working class and of the people of Chile‚Äù.Echeverr√≠a, pp. 62‚Äì63. Blest begun to be engaged in social causes in the 1920s. During this time he joined the study circle called El Surco which was directed by the priest Guillermo Viviani Contreras.

Blest did also join the political party Partido Popular that was created by Bartolom√© Palacios Silva. It was in El Sindicalista, the newspaper of Partido Popular, that Blest wrote his first articles. Another organization in which Blest participated was La casa del pueblo directed by Viviani which sought to advocate syndicalism and some social Christian teachings. After years of work in \\"La casa del pueblo\\" Blest entered in conflict with the directive of the organization and left for good La casa del pueblo. The conflict had been about Blest's naming of the organization's chapel \\"Jes√∫s obrero\\" (lit. \\"labourer Jesus\\") and the directive rejecting the name.Echeverr√≠a, pp. 72‚Äì74. Blest worked as salesman of castor oil, lawyer assistant and in a drug store before entering to work in Servicio de Tesorer√≠as (Government Treasury).

The law did however not permit for the formation of trade unions so Blest decided to found a sports association in 1938 which was named Asociaci√≥n Deportiva de Instituciones P√∫blicas (ADIP). It was from this group that the Agrupaci√≥n Nacional de Empleados Fiscales (ANEF), was created in 1943.

She is one of the most popular demi-goddesses amongst the Jains. Worship of such persons is considered as mithyƒÅtva or wrong belief and many Jains unknowingly get involved in such worship. The sanskrit word Deva has multiple meanings in Jainism. In many places the word has been used to refer to the Tirthankaras (spiritual teachers of Dharma). But in common usage it is used to refer to the heavenly beings. These beings are born instantaneously in special beds without any parents just like hell beings (naraki). According to Jain texts, clairvoyance (avadhi jnana) based on birth is possessed by the celestial beings.  Classes of heavenly beings  According to Jain texts, the celestial beings are of four orders (classes):- * BhavanavƒÅsƒ´ (residential) * Vyantara (intermediaries or peripatetic) * Jyoti·π£ka (luminaries or stellar) * VaimƒÅnika (Astral or heavenly beings) There are of ten, eight, five and twelve classes up to the Heavenly beings (kalpavasis). There are ten grades in each of these classes of celestial beings, the Lord (Indra), his Equal, the Minister, the courtiers, the bodyguards, the police, the army, the citizens, the servants, and the menials. Abode The abode of Devas is Svarga (heaven). According to Jain texts, persons with right faith (except those whose bondage of life-karma has been accomplished prior to their attainment of right belief) are reborn among the fourth order of devas and not among the three lower orders, namely the Residential, the Peripatetic and the Stellar devas. Those practising restraint with attachment and restraint-cum-non- restraint are also characterized by right belief. Hence they are reborn in the higher heavens of Saudharma Kalpa and so on and not among the three lower orders of celestial beings. Merit which leads to the highest celestial state such as SarvƒÅrthasiddhi is said to be acquired in the Bharata, AirƒÅvata, and Videha Kshetra  Lifetime  1\\\\. Minimum lifetime of the Residential devas is ten thousand years. 2\\\\. Peripatetic devas is a little over one palyopama. 3. Stellar devas same as Peripatetic devas.

In 1443 he took part in the first general Parliament of the Kingdom of Naples called by King Alfonso V at Benevento, after its conquest of southern Italy the previous year. In 1438 the king appointed Francesco as counsellor of the Regio Consiglio (\\"Royal Council\\") and sent him as ambassador at the court of emperor Frederick III. In 1458, the new King Ferdinand I sent him to Pope Callixtus III with the task to receive the investiture of the Kingdom of Naples; Francesco was also sent to pay homage to new pope Pius II after Calixtus' death. In 1459 Francesco was the Neapolitan representative at the diet of Mantua where a crusade against the Ottoman Turks was to be discussed. Taking advantage of the duke's absence, a distant relative, Giovanni Antonio Orsini Del Balzo, prince of Taranto, tried to capture Andria, which was defended by Francesco's son Pirro. Francesco returned immediately to participate in the defense, but in 1462 both he and his son were taken prisoners. After the defeat of Giovanni Antonio and other southern Italian rebels who had sided for John II of Anjou against king Ferdinand, Francesco obtained back all his lands. In exchange for loyalty, he was appointed Grand Constable of the Kingdom of Naples. He died in 1482.

Ireland has coached minor and junior amateur teams and professional teams in North America and Europe. He is currently head coach of HC Bozen‚ÄìBolzano, which is a member of the Austrian Hockey League, and of Italy men's national ice hockey team.  Career  Born in Orangeville, Ontario, Ireland is a graduate of York University. Ireland began his career as ice hockey coach in 1991 as head coach of the Milton Merchants. In 1992 he was hired by the Oakville Blades to be their head coach. After two years with the team and after receiving Ontario Hockey Association's Jr. A Division West Coach of the Year honors in 1994, he took over the Caledon Canadians and guided the team to three Metro Junior A Hockey League runner-up finishes in four years. Under his guidance, the Canadians amassed a 42-3-5 record in 1994‚Äì95, making them the number one team in Canadian junior hockey at the time. Ireland then spent five years (1998‚Äì2003) at the helm of the Dayton Bombers, serving as head coach and general manager of hockey operations. He coached the team to an EHCL record of 175-134-47 and led the Bombers to an appearance in the 2002 Kelly Cup finals. In the second half of the 2002‚Äì03 season, he had a short stint as assistant coach of the Hamilton Bulldogs of the AHL. Ireland joined the coaching staff of AHL's Grand Rapids Griffins, affiliate to the Detroit Red Wings, in 2003, serving two years as assistant, before being promoted to head coach in February 2005. The Griffins made the Calder Cup playoff semifinals in Ireland's first full season as head coach (2005‚Äì06). Ireland stayed on the job until 2007 and then was appointed as head coach of the San Antonio Rampage in August 2007. In November 2009, he was sacked by the AHL affiliate of the Phoenix Coyotes after a run of ten games without a win. Ireland was hired by Swiss side HC Lugano in February 2011 only a couple of days before the start of the relegation round. His task was to keep the club in the top flight National League A which he did. He signed with the Owen Sound Attack of the Ontario Hockey League in August 2011 and stepped down from his head coaching position in July 2015 to accept an offer from Germany: He signed with Adler Mannheim, defending champion of the German elite league Deutsche Eishockey Liga, for the 2015‚Äì16 campaign, but was sacked in February 2016 after a five- game losing streak. The Adler Mannheim CEO said in a statement, the team had displayed a lack of consistency throughout the season. On January 16, 2017, Ireland was named head coach of HC Lugano of the National League A (NLA). He led HCL to the NLA semifinals and was handed a two-year contract extension in April 2017. In March 2019, he parted ways with the club after losing 0-4 in the playoff quarterfinals against Zug. On January 2, 2020, he was signed as new head coach of HC Bozen‚ÄìBolzano and on March 22, 2020 also accepted the job as head coach of the Italian men's national team.

Zubarev et al., Early life relict feature in peptide mass distribution, Cent. Eur. J. Biol. 5, 190 (2010)R.A. Zubarev, Role of stable isotopes in life ‚Äì Testing isotopic resonance hypothesis, Genomics Proteomics Bioinformatics 9, 15 (2011) postulates that certain isotopic compositions of chemical elements affect kinetics of chemical reactions involving molecules built of these elements. The isotopic compositions for which this effect is predicted are called resonance isotopic compositions. Fundamentally, the IsoRes hypothesis relies on a postulate that less complex systems exhibit faster kinetics than equivalent but more complex systems. Furthermore, system‚Äôs complexity is affected by its symmetry (more symmetric systems are simpler), and symmetry (in general meaning) of reactants may be affected by their isotopic composition. The term ‚Äúresonance‚Äù relates to the use of this term in nuclear physics, where peaks in the dependence of a reaction cross section upon energy are called ‚Äúresonances‚Äù. Similarly, a sharp increase (or decrease) in the reaction kinetics as a function of the average isotopic mass of a certain element is called here a resonance.  History of formulation  The concept of isotopes developed from radioactivity. The pioneering work on radioactivity by Henri Becquerel, Marie Curie and Pierre Curie was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903. Later Frederick Soddy would take radioactivity from physics to chemistry and shed light on the nature of isotopes, something with rendered him the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1921 (awarded in 1922). The question of stable, non-radioactive isotopes was more difficult and required the development by Francis Aston of a high-resolution mass spectrograph, which allowed the separation of different stable isotopes of one and the same element. Francis Aston was awarded the 1922 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this achievement. With his enunciation of the whole-number rule, Aston solved a problem that had riddled chemistry for a hundred years. The understanding was that different isotopes of a given element would be chemically identical. It was discovered in the 1930s by Harold Urey in 1932 (awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1934). It was early on found that the deuterium content had a profound effect on chemistry and biochemistry. In the linear approximation, the effect of isotopic substitution is proportional to the mass ratio of the heavy and light isotope. Thus chemical and biological effects of heavier isotopes of the ‚Äúbiological‚Äù atoms C, N and O are expected to be much smaller since the mass ratios for the normal to heavier isotopes are much closer to unity than the factor two for hydrogen to deuterium. However, it has been reported in 1930s,T. C. Barnes. The effect of heavy water of low concentration on Euglena. Science 79, 370 (1934) and then again in 1970sV. I. Lobyshev et al. Activation of Na,K-ATPasa by low concentration of D2O and inhibition by high concentrations, Biofizika 23, 397 (1978)V. I. Lobyshev. Activating influence of heavy water of small concentration on the regeneration of hydroid polip Obelia Geniculata. Biofizika 28, 666 (1983) and 1990s,G. Somlyai et al. Naturally occurring deuterium is essential for the normal growth of cells. FEBS 317, 1 (1993) as well as recently,A. Kov√°cs et al. Deuterium Depletion May Delay the Progression of Prostate Cancer, J Cancer Ther, 2, 548 (2011 that relatively small changes in the content of the heavy isotope of hydrogen, deuterium, has profound effects on biological systems. These strong nonlinear effects could not be fully rationalized based on the known concepts of the isotopic effects. These and other observations make it possible that isotopes have a much more profound importance than could ever have been imagined by the pioneers. In 2011 Roman Zubarev formulated the isotope resonance hypothesis. It originated in the following, unexpected observation. Define ŒîMm = Mmono  Mnom, where Mmono is the monoisotopic mass (e.g. O = 15.994915 Da) and Mnom is the nominal (integer) mass, i.e., the number of nucleons (e.g. 16O = 16). ŒîMm is a constant in the whole Universe. Define ŒîMis = Mav  Mmono, where Mav is the average isotopic mass (e.g. O = 15.999 Da on Earth). Obviously ŒîMis depends on the precise isotopic composition for a given molecule. Finally define NMD = 1000ŒîMm/Mnom and NIS = 1000ŒîMis/Mnom, where NMD [in units of ‚Ä∞] and NIS [in units of ‚Ä∞] are the normalized isotopic defect and shift, respectively. If NIS is plotted as a function of NMD for a large number of terrestrial peptides, one would anticipate a homogenous distribution of data points (as in Fig. 1B). This is not what was found by Zubarev‚Äôs team, instead they found band gap in the distribution with a narrow line in the middle (Fig. 1A). This serendipitous discovery led Zubarev to formulate the isotope resonance hypothesis.  Analogues in science  As an example of isotopic symmetry (in compositional, and not in geometrical sense) affecting the kinetics of physic-chemical processes, see mass independent isotope fractionation in ozone O3.  Implication for the origin of life  According to the IsoRes hypothesis, there are certain resonance isotopic compositions at which terrestrial organisms thrive best. Curiously, average terrestrial isotopic compositions are very close to a resonance affecting a large class of amino acids and polypeptides, the molecules of outmost importance for life. Thus, the IsoRes hypothesis suggests that early life on Earth was aided, perhaps critically, by the proximity to an IsoRes. In contrast, there is no strong resonance for then atmosphere of Mars, which led to a prediction that life could not have originated on Mars and that the planet is probably sterile.X. Xie and R.A. Zubarev, Effects of low-level deuterium enrichment on bacterial growth, PLoS One 9, e102071 (2014)  Other nontrivial predictions  One would expect that enrichment of heavy isotopes leads to progressively slower reactions, but the IsoRes hypothesis suggests that there exist certain resonance compositions for which kinetics increases even for higher abundances of heavy stable isotopes. For example, at 9.5% 13C, 10.9% 15N and 6.6% 18O (when all three elements are 10-35 times enriched compared to their natural abundances) and normal deuterium composition (150 ppm or 0.015%), a very strong resonance (Fig. 1C) is predicted (‚Äúsuper-resonance‚Äù). Yet another nontrivial prediction of the IsoRes hypothesis is that at ‚âà250-350 ppm deuterium content, the terrestrial resonance becomes ‚Äúperfect‚Äù, and the rates of biochemical reactions and growth of terrestrial organisms further increase. This prediction seems to be matched by at least some experimental observations.X. Xie and R.A. Zubarev, Isotopic resonance hypothesis: Experimental verification by Escherichia coli growth measurements, Sci. Rep. 5, 9215 (2015)  Experimental verification  The IsoRes hypothesis has been tested experimentally by means of growth of E. coli and found to be supported by extremely strong statistics (p << 10‚àí15). Particular strong evidence of faster growth was found for the ‚Äúsuper-resonance‚Äù. Fig1 Fig. 1. 2D plot of molecular masses of 3000 E. coli tryptic peptides. A ‚Äì terrestrial isotopic compositions (red arrow shows the line representing the resonance); B ‚Äì 18O abundance is increased by 20%, which destroyed the terrestrial resonance; C ‚Äì isotopic compositions of the ‚Äúsuper-resonance‚Äù, where all dots (molecules) are perfectly aligned.

He was a preacher who went from diocese to diocese and served in a position of power in the Capuchin order in the Umbrian region in which he pushed for strong adherence to the Rule of Saint Francis of Assisi. He has been called the \\"Apostle of Umbria\\". His beatification cause started earlier than was the norm due to miracles being done at his tomb and Pope Leo XIII beatified him on 12 March 1893 after the verification of two miracles. Life Giovanni Croci was born on 30 October 1732 to poor farmers and he lived a pious life which he picked up from his devout parents; he also worked as a shepherd as a child. From his parish priest he did most of his studies and also learned catechism. It was a shining moment for Croci's parents when he announced his intention to become a Capuchin friar. He entered a Franciscan convent in his hometown to become a friar in 1752 and assumed the religious name of \\"Leopoldo da Gaiche\\" upon admittance, taking the habit for the first time in the convent of Saint Bartholomew in Cibottola. Croci was ordained to the priesthood in 1757 after his novitiate where he was regarded as an excellent student; he received his ordination from the Bishop of Terni Cosimo Pierbenedetto Maculari. He was appointed as an \\"apostolic missionary\\" in 1768 and for the duration of a decade travelled across multiple dioceses for the purpose of preaching. As his guide, the friar took the method of Leonard of Port Maurice for his own preaching. He was appointed as a \\"chief missionary\\" four years after being named as the \\"apostolic missionary\\" in 1772. Croci kept with him a journal in which it was later learned that he did 330 missions that each lasted an average of two weeks and he also led a total of 40 Lenten retreats. He also restored the devotion of the Via Crucis in many areas where it fell into obscurity or was suppressed. He was appointed as the Minister Provincial for the Capuchin friars in the Umbrian region in 1781. His tenure was noted for his strong insistence on the careful study and application of the Rule of Saint Francis of Assisi. In 1788 he chose Monteluco near Spoleto as the site of a monastery, or cloister, he would build, the Monastery of Saint Francis, and he would remain there as part of an ongoing spiritual retreat of strict observance. In 1809 he climbed a mountain in a protest against the invasion of the Italian nation, led by Napoleon Bonaparte, and planted a tree representing justice and liberty, but the invasion forced him to leave the convent, which was subsequently closed down, and abandon his ministry; he was also briefly imprisoned for his refusal in joining the Napoleonic Republic. He began to preach once more following the European Restoration not long after. He travelled to Rome in 1814 where he met with Pope Pius VII and in the private audience requested that the pope restore the Monteluco convent. Once that was done he returned and spent the remainder of his life there. During a sermon for Christmas in 1814 he was taken ill and would later die on 2 April 1815 of that illness and was buried in the Church of Saint Francis in Spoleto; his tomb became the site of reported miracles. Beatification Tomb. The process of beatification opened in Spoleto in 1844 under Pope Gregory XVI and was the site of two diocesan processes that would collect evidence for the potential sanctification of Leopoldo da Gaiche. Upon the recognition of his model life of heroic virtue he was proclaimed to be Venerable on 13 February 1855 after Pope Pius IX granted his approval to the Congregation of Rites' findings. The acceptance of two miracles attributed to his intercession allowed for Pope Leo XIII to celebrate his beatification on 12 March 1893. The current postulator of the cause is Father Giovangiuseppe Califano, O.F.M.

Michael Duwe joined them after returning from the recording of the album Seven Up with Ash Ra Tempel and Timothy Leary. Guitarist Helmut Binzer, who came from the south of Germany, and singer Ute Kannenberg, at that time better known as Tanja Berg in German hit parades (\\"Na Na Hey Hey Goodbye\\" - German version), completed the band soon after.http://surfingtheodyssey.blogspot.de/2015/01/metropolis-1974-metropolis.html Surfingtheodyssey.blogspot.de History For almost a year the band worked hard in their rehearsal room at the \\"Wrangel Kaserne\\", former Prussian barracks that were transformed into numerous rehearsal rooms in West-Berlin‚Äôs Kreuzberg district, composing and arranging the tracks for their first and, as it turned out, only album. They signed a contract with the German record company Ariola (BMG), and in winter 1973/74 they started recording in Munich‚Äôs ‚ÄúStudio 70‚Äú, which had been pointed out to them by their friends and colleagues Agitation Free. They were supported by a small but brilliant classical ensemble, directed by Hartmut Westphal, well known German arranger and brother of the band‚Äôs bass player Michael. Clearly influenced by the music of bands like early Genesis, Soft Machine or Van Der Graaf Generator, they experimented with 5/4, 7/4 or 11/4 rhythms and created a music that had symphonic- as well as psychedelic parts, jazzy influences combined with total free experimental sounds, driving-aggressive rock voices or folksong style harmony vocals, a pretty unusual mixture at that time. Their lyrics, written in English, were in general a criticism of the state of civilization and ecology, with occasional romantic influences. (The front cover of their album shows a seemingly intact landscape that gets threatened by a monster that develops out of polluted air). Shortly after album and single were released in early summer 1974 Ute Kannenberg and Helmut Binzer left the band. But Metropolis went on, playing concerts in Berlin and West-Germany (Germany was still divided..) and working on a new programme. Based on the story ‚ÄúKaleidoscope‚Äú of Ray Bradbury‚Äôs ‚ÄúIllustrated Man‚Äú they created a multi media show that had its premiere on Christmas Eve 1975 at Berlin‚Äôs Kant Kino. The light show was created by Metropolis' roady and technician Alf Heuer with slides, liquid gel projections, film, stroboscope, spot lights and fog machines. A so-called \\"scent show\\" with the help of electric cooking plates was added. Along with new compositions they also played their version of Mr. Spaceman, the song already being recorded and meant to be their new single. But after a last open air concert in the summer of 1976 the band finally split. All members started different new projects.http://rockinberlin.de/index.php?title=Metropolis (German website) Trivia The album was recorded in the heavy winter 1973/ 74 while the first oil crisis took place. With their equipment loaded into their Mercedes 319 band bus the band went from Berlin to Munich on a nearly empty highway, because for weekends special permission was needed to be allowed to drive the German Autobahn. Also to print the records vinyl was needed, made of oil, and at some point it was questioned if the record company would get sufficient supplies to actually go on with this project. Fortunately for the band they did.http://rockinberlin.de/index.php?title=Metropolis (German website) ‚ÄúWhy this German band remains overlooked is beyond my imagination.‚Äú Quote: Drago Museveni on ‚ÄúCun Cun Na Ma‚Äú The 1980s Canadian New Wave band Strange Advance originally named themselves Metropolis in 1980 but changed their name due to the existence of this band.

It formed along the Lipez geological lineament about 6.6 million years ago. Volcanic ash samples found in the Coastal Cordillera of Chile may come from this volcano. The Rachaite () stratovolcano is located close to the caldera. The formation of this caldera has been influenced by a number of local fault systems, the Coyaguayama and Rachaite lineaments. Marine sediments of Ordovician age with some later volcanic intrusions form the basement together with Cretaceous-Eocene sediments. Three cycles of volcanic activity preceding the Coranzuli ignimbrite have been identified. The Coranzuli system is part of a Late Miocene volcanic episode that also includes Aguas Calientes, Cerro Panizos and the Toconquis ignimbrite of Galan. The Morro Grande Formation may have originated by volcanic activity in the area of Cerro Coranzuli. 6.8 to 6.4 million years ago, this caldera erupted the Coranzuli ignimbrites. They have a total volume of . They are named in order from oldest to youngest Abra Grande ignimbrite, Potreros ignimbrite, Las Termas ignimbrites 1 and 2, and a smaller one Corral de Sangre. They are most likely the products of the same eruption. The Coranzuli Ignimbrite was erupted in three distinct flows, the last one is the largest one and has the highest matrix component. This ignimbrite is of rhyodacitic composition. The Las Termas Ignimbrite contains pumice and is highly welded and crystalline. A wide caldera was left by the eruption that formed this ignimbrite and postcaldera volcanism generated three thick dacitic lava flows within it.

During the period of \\"low intensity warfare\\" in South Africa which largely pitted the African National Congress (ANC) and Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), Siphiwe Mvuyane was on the side of the IFP. During the period of the \\"low intensity warfare\\", the IFP was the sole ruling party of the Bantustan KwaZulu government, and worked in collaboration with the apartheid government, whereas the ANC was operating underground; as a result the IFP had an upper hand over the ANC when it came to the warfare. But post apartheid, the African National Congress (ANC) became the governing party in South Africa whereas the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) became one of the opposition parties in the South African parliament, as a result the ANC gained the upper hand over the IFP in the remaining years of the warfare as the ANC was in control of the state apparatus by virtue of being the governing party. The IFP leadership denied its involvement in sanctioning and orchestrating political violence in the furtherance of its political objectives during the period of the \\"low intensity warfare\\" in South Africa.  Prologue  Siphiwe Mvuyane was a fearsome resident of Umlazi township at the time of his death, and he attended Menzi High School which is situated at the same township but his hometown was Pietermaritzburg. After completing high school he joined the now defunct South African Police (SAP) around 1986, after which he transferred to the now defunct KwaZulu Police (KZP) around 1987-88. He was married. He carried out most of his killings under the auspices of KZP. He was stationed at Umlazi Police Station which was popularly known as \\"GG Police Station\\", and was assigned to a Murder and Robbery Unit. He also worked temporarily in Ulundi after he was allegedly advised to flee Durban, but did not stay long in Ulundi as Ulundi was a rural area and Mvuyane was the man of city life. It was not long after he had returned to Durban that he met his death. While at Ulundi he allegedly killed a snake with a single shot and bemoaned the fact that he was killing snakes instead of people. The ANC intelligence (now defunct) allegedly succeeded in recruiting Mvuyane's colleagues as informers at the GG Police Station who would spy on Mvuyane as it was believed that he was abusing his position as a police officer to kill ANC activists. The ANC intelligence would know beforehand the cases that would be allocated to Mvuyane. They would quickly investigate the cases allocated to him and forewarn the suspected criminals about the coming of Mvuyane. Inevitably this scheme produced unintended consequences in that pure criminals ended up being tipped-off as most of the cases Mvuyane officially investigated were not political. Mvuyane's political killings took place clandestinely after hours but he also did commit killings during the course of his official duties. There is no official date for the commencement of the \\"low intensity warfare\\" in South Africa but it is generally accepted that the warfare commenced following the fallout between the IFP and ANC at the famous 1979 London meeting. The early 1980s saw political unrest and \\"black on black\\" violence begin in earnest in the country, and sometimes this warfare was referred to as \\"people's war\\". The nature of this warfare took the form of carefully planned assassinations which involved an element of surprise, setting up and utilising intelligence structures. The assassination would happen at a time and place that the victim least expected it.  Controversy  Siphiwe Mvuyane was primarily in combat (during a period of low intensity warfare in South Africa) with the armed military wing of the ANC, Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK). He allegedly killed many undercover operatives of MK trained from Russia and other African countries. Mvuyane was allegedly a policeman by day (investigating normal criminal cases) and a paid assassin by night (killing ANC activists). In the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) reports, one of the applicants indicated that Mvuyane was a commander of killing squads on the East Coast of South Africa, the KwaZulu-Natal Province. It must be noted that Mvuyane's position as a commander of killings squads was a covert underhanded position. The precision with which he carried out his assassinations (the precision that one would envisage in the engineering space) earned him promotion to the position of a commander of killing squads. When political violence reached epic proportions in the early 1990s, international investors and negotiators such as John Aitchison of the University of Natal in Pietermaritzburg and Kim Hodgson of the Inkatha Institute in Durban became worried at the pace at which black political leaders were dying that South Africa would be 'leaderless' by the time apartheid came to an end. Mvuyane was, to a certain extent, directly involved in that conflict, and was accused of shooting people without reasonable justification. These political killings created space for uneducated people to emerge as new leaders of the masses, as knowledgeable leaders were getting decimated. The situation also made it difficult for international investors to negotiate with future leaders who would inherit the new democratic state as these leaders were getting killed on a daily basis. For example, Mr Ngwenya an ANC leader in the Pietermaritzburg area was gunned down on 8 February 1992 after leaving a Pietermaritzburg restaurant where he had dined with a delegation of 15 Americans. A day before Mr Ngwenya was killed, Mr Winnington Sabelo, an IFP leader at Umlazi Township in Durban had been assassinated. KwaZulu-Natal was the epicentre of political violence that engulfed the whole of South Africa at the time. However, Mvuyane would occasionally be spotted in other provinces. Mvuyane could be described as a celebrity killer. He reveled in his reputation of being a dreaded killer. Mvuyane claimed in a local newspaper to have killed more than 20 but not more than 50 people. There was a belief that he was immune from prosecution as it was believed that he was carrying out instructions of those in the high echelons of government at the time. The local magistrates and prosecutors were afraid to prosecute him. He claimed that he killed suspected criminals in self-defense or for preventing them from escaping. On 14 May 1992, he was arrested in connection with an arms cache made by a US gun manufacturer Mossberg and Sons of Connecticut, but the case remained pending up to the point of his demise. There was strong suspicion that these arms would be used in fueling political violence in South Africa. It is believed that the ANC once threatened to withdraw from the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA) negotiations if the killers involved in political violence were not arrested. It is for this reason that during CODESA the apartheid government started arresting in droves all those who were involved in political violence. Mvuyane was going to be one of those to be arrested, but he died. The character of Siphiwe Mvuyane is significant because what he and his gang were doing had the effect of shaping the future of South Africa. If Siphiwe Mvuyane and his gang had achieved their objectives South Africa would have been different from what it is today. Siphiwe Mvuyane was at the coalface of the dynamics that sought to shape the future of South Africa. He can be regarded as the most feared person South Africa has ever had. He survived many attempts on his life so much so that a myth developed that he could not be hit by a bullet (i.e. he was protected by black magic from gunshots). He, for example, survived a hand grenade attack by an undercover MK operative, Sifiso Kunene. Mvuyane can also be understood as a unique individual who had extraordinary capabilities of self-defense. Mvuyane was shot at the parking lot at the then University of Durban-Westville where he was attending a music concert. His murder case remains unresolved to this day. Some people are of the view that he died from homicide whereas others suspected suicide (details are still sketchy). The rationale for suicide is that people close to him were telling him that his arrest was imminent and that the ANC (his adversary) would be in power the following year (i.e. 1994). He felt betrayed and for fear of being in the hands of his enemies he allegedly committed suicide.  Prominent incidents  A Durban multi-millionaire businesswoman, Shauwn Mpisane, lost her father during the period of the low intensity warfare in South Africa. Her father was Sipho Mkhize who was renowned as a warlord in the Umbumbulu area and was also a trained MK operative. Sipho Mkhize was shot dead in cold blood (first degree murder) by Siphiwe Mvuyane on 12 June 1991. Mvuyane had not been prosecuted for this murder at the time of his death. Sipho Mkhize's son S'bu \\"Billy the Kid\\" Mkhize went berserk after the murder of his father. He went on a rampage and killed police officers in revenge for the death of his father Sipho Mkhize using military weapons such as RPG 7 rocket launchers to take out police vehicles in ambushes. S'bu Mkhize also hunted Mvuyane high and low but to no avail. It was common cause at the time that S'bu Mkhize was wanted by white policemen from CR Swart Square (now called Durban Central Police Station). Almost a year later after the death of his father, S'bu Mkhize was killed by the South African apartheid police after a high-speed chase which ended in Isipingo area in July 1992. On 7 August 1990, Austin Zwane, a school pupil, was shot dead at Lamontville Township in front of his parents by Mvuyane accompanied by a group of four police officers. This is one of the murders which Mvuyane was to be prosecuted for, before he died. Mvuyane probably died in the early hours of Sunday, 9 May 1993. The court case for this murder and other crimes was set for the next day (Monday, 10 May 1993). Coincidentally, Austin Zwane attended Menzi High School, the same school Mvuyane had attended. Bob Mabena, a popular radio personality in South Africa, was slapped in the face by Mvuyane at a music concert. Apparently Mabena was, at the concert, receiving attention from women at the expense of Mvuyane. This incident infuriated Mvuyane and got his blood to boil. He charged at Mabena and smacked him in the face. On 26 April 1992, Mvuyane shot and paralyzed Mfanafuthi Khumalo. It would appear that the killings gradually affected Mvuyane psychologically as he increasingly resorted to torture and irrational behaviour in resolving criminal cases he was investigating. As regards one of the cases Mvuyane was investigating, the victim (Khumalo) had this to say: In another incident, Mvuyane opened fire on mourners at the funeral of Sifiso Zame on 2 October 1991. This was a random shooting and many people were injured as a result thereof and it remains unknown if any persons died from the shooting. Zame had been killed by the apartheid security police the previous week. Mvuyane himself survived a bomb attack when he visited one of his many girlfriends at Mable Palmer residence at the then University of Natal in Durban. The undercover MK operatives had placed a limpet mine underneath his car. Somehow, Mvuyane survived the explosion. He had multiple lives like a cat. The undercover MK operatives began to use explosives against Mvuyane because they had failed dismally to kill him using conventional firearms (e.g. handguns and rifles). The communities were also of the view that Mvuyane must have received advanced military training from apartheid security forces, and was unfairly using the skills gained from that training in a civilian environment.  Political context  Following the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Western Powers, particularly the US, lost appetite in sustaining the South African apartheid government. The apartheid government was given an ultimatum to hand over political power to the indigenous people of the land, failing which further sanctions would be imposed. At the time, the apartheid government could not afford any further sanctions as the economy had already begun to cripple. The apartheid growth strategy had been rendered obsolete by the global dynamics at the time. This development meant that the apartheid government had to begin negotiations with its enemies in order to pave way for the democratic elections in the country, and this represented a paradigm shift in the apartheid government's political strategy - the new strategic objective was to achieve a favourable negotiated settlement. Despite the fact that the South African apartheid state was a formidable force in Africa in the same way as the State of Israel is in the present day in the Middle East, the South African apartheid government had to succumb to the Western pressure as the US did not want South Africa to be another source of conflict for the continuation of the Cold War. Now the apartheid government had to extend an olive branch to the ANC so that a negotiated settlement could be reached. The ANC was the dominant party at the time from the side of liberation movements and enjoyed the majority of support from the country's populace. At the same time this change of strategy by the apartheid government represented the betrayal of other people who were fighting the ANC that the apartheid government had supported. Such people included Siphiwe Mvuyane who was fighting the ANC at grassroot level. It was not a complete betrayal as such because the apartheid government did pardon some of the offenders in terms of the First Indemnity Act of 1992 before the dawn of democracy, and one of the persons to be pardoned by this Act was Samuel Jamile (IFP leader and warlord). The apartheid government demonstrated its commitment to reform by releasing Nelson Mandela from prison, unbanning liberation movements and allowing exiles to return home. On the other hand, the apartheid government arrested people who were involved in political violence. At the time of his death Siphiwe Muvuyane had been suspended as a police officer and had been served a court indictment with more than 50 charges. This is the context in which the fall from grace and demise of Siphiwe Mvuyane should be understood.  Death  Apparently it was late at night at the then University of Durban-Westville, where Siphiwe Mvuyane was attending a music concert, when he complained to his gang (which de facto served as his bodyguards) about drowsiness and fatigue. He was stressed and probably worried about the court case that was set for the following week. He wanted to go to his car at the parking lot to take a nap. His gang warned him about the possible presence of the undercover MK operatives, and his gang offered to accompany him to his car as a way of protection. Mvuyane refused the offer and pleaded with his gang not to accompany him. Stressed as he was, he eventually proceeded alone to his car. Few minutes later a gunshot was heard. His gang rushed to the parking lot, they found him in the driver's front seat sprawling. They rushed him to the nearest hospital and died on his way.  Funeral and legacy At his funeral held in Pietermaritzburg, journalists were precluded from taking photographs and being part of the funeral. John Woodroof, a journalist for Daily News was attacked at Mvuyane's funeral by mourners who were angry at the media. John Woodroof had written several newspaper articles that were critical of Siphiwe Mvuyane casting Mvuyane in a negative light. It appears as if Mvuyane's mourners also held the media responsible for Mvuyane's downfall as Mvuyane had constantly received negative media coverage. Although there is no official date for the end of the \\"low intensity warfare\\" in South Africa between the IFP and ANC (and a third force in-between), it can be argued that the end of this warfare was marked by the assassination of the IFP leader Thomas Shabalala, who was gunned down on 20 January 2005. The death toll of this warfare was estimated to be around 20 000 casualties. In April 2010, the National Commissioner for the South African Police Service (SAPS) Bheki Cele re-introduced military ranks within the police. He was also quoted in the media as encouraging police officers to adopt the shoot-to-kill philosophy in an effort to combating crime, but Bheki Cele believed the media exaggerated his views. Amongst many people who were critical of Bheki Cele's changes was David Bruce, senior researcher at the Centre for the Study of Violence and Reconciliation, who referred to a 2007 report:  External links  * South African Police Service (SAPS) * Political Violence in South Africa: Nelson Mandela Organisation * What does increasing political violence mean for the future of South Africa's democracy?: Institute for Security Studies References Category:South African police officers Category:South African murder victims Category:Unsolved murders in South Africa Category:1993 deaths Category:Year of birth missing ","title":"Siphiwe Mvuyane"},{"id":"49404861","text":"St. George's Church in Bauska St. George's Church is a Latvian Orthodox church in Bauska, Latvia.

Born in Cork, 1949, he studied literature and theology at Maynooth College (BA 1969; DD 1976). He also studied at the Gregorian University, Rome (1972-3) and in Paris (1977‚Äì79). Ordained for the Diocese of Cork and Ross in 1973, he was a chaplain at University College Cork (1980‚Äì81). He taught theology at the University of Notre Dame (1981‚Äì82) and Duquesne University (1982‚Äì83) before moving to Japan in August, 1983. He worked as a researcher at the Nanzan Institute for Religion and Culture, Nanzan University, Nagoya (1985‚Äì86), where he later held the Roche Chair for Interreligious Research (2015‚Äì16). He taught in the Faculty of Letters at Sophia University, Tokyo, from 1988 to 2015. Other assignments include teaching philosophy and theology in the Philippines in 1986‚Äì87, the Lady Donnellan Lecturership at Trinity College Dublin, in the spring of 1991, the Chaire √âtienne Gilson at the Institut Catholique de Paris, March, 2011, and visiting fellowships at Katholieke Universiteit Leuven in 1997 and the Humboldt Universit√§t, Berlin (with the Romano Guardini Stiftung) in 2012. Joseph O‚ÄôLeary is editorial assistant to The Japan Mission Journal, which often publishes articles of interreligious interest, and is a regular participant in the Tokyo Buddhist Discussion Group. He frequently attends academic conferences, including the quadrennial Origenianum and Gregory of Nyssa conferences, the Oxford Patristic Conference, the biennial Enrico Castelli conference in philosophy of religion (University of Rome La Sapienza), the International James Joyce Symposium, the International Association for the Study of Irish Literatures, the International Association for Buddhist Studies, and many conferences held at Cerisy-la-Salle in Normandy. With Richard Kearney and William Desmond, O'Leary was named one of \\"three Irish Philosophers plying their trade abroad\\" in Irish Times (2003). Study of Literature Studying English and French literature under Professors Peter Connolly and Brendan Devlin at Maynooth, O‚ÄôLeary was particularly influenced by the Geneva School critics such as Georges Poulet and Jean Starobinski. Returning to academic involvement with literature in 1988 he focused in his teaching on Henry James, T. S. Eliot, Yeats. Joyce, and Beckett. Derrida, Lacan, and Blanchot became key theoretical references. In addition to English Literature he taught courses on European culture and on the Bible as literature. He remains concerned with the theological significance of modernist literature and is currently working on a book on Joyce from this perspective. Study of Theology In his graduate studies in theology at Maynooth, O‚ÄôLeary specialized in patristics, working on Augustine's De Trinitate (with much reference to Augustine's dialogue with Plotinus) for his doctoral thesis. In Paris he attended courses on patristics by Pierre Nautin and Charles Kannengiesser. Discussing Heidegger and theology with Jean Beaufret, Fran√ßois F√©dier, Fran√ßois Vezin, Emmanuel Martineau, Jean- Fran√ßois Courtine, Jean-Luc Marion, Stanislas Breton, Jean Greisch, and Maria Villela-Petit, he developed a critical approach to patristic tradition drawing on the Heideggerian project of overcoming metaphysics. With Richard Kearney he organized a seminar at the Irish College, Paris, on 24 June 1979, in which Beaufret, Ricoeur, and Emmanuel Levinas participated, and which led to the publication of Heidegger te la question de Dieu (Grasset, 1980; 2nd ed., PUF 2009). The Heideggerian approach was spelled out programmatically in his first book, Questioning Back: The Overcoming of Metaphysics in Christian Tradition (Minneapolis: Winston-Seabury 1985), which also showed the influence of Derrida and of his first encounters with Buddhist philosophy. This book sketches a strategy for rereading Christian texts in a counter-metaphysical key. Though convinced of the truth and validity of classical Christian metaphysical theology, O‚ÄôLeary is also convinced of the need to ‚Äòstep back‚Äô behind it to the ‚Äòmatter itself,‚Äô that is, to the phenomenality of the biblical events in the horizons of contemporary understanding. Drawing on Heidegger to renew the old questions of Luther and Harnack about the patristic synthesis of the Bible and Greek thought, he advocates a deconstructive method of reading patristic texts that brings out the tensions and flaws in the Athens-Jerusalem syntheses as they show up in the texture of the writing of Origen, Gregory of Nyssa, and Augustine. He has since published a number of essays on these patristic authors, in particular a book-length study, Christianisme et philosophie chez Orig√®ne (Paris: √âditions du Cerf, ‚ÄòPhilosophie & Th√©ologie,‚Äô 2011). The theme of religious pluralism comes to the fore in his second book, La v√©rit√© chr√©tienne √† l'√¢ge du pluralisme religieux (√âditions du Cerf, ‚ÄòCogitatio Fidei,‚Äô 1994) and its rewritten English version, Religious Pluralism and Christian Truth (Edinburgh University Press, 1996). He attempts to tackle this theme with philosophical finesse in a critical dialogue with Derrida. Conceiving theology as a play of reflective judgment in a mobile and pluralistic context, O‚ÄôLeary explored the possibilities of a Buddhist-inspired theological conventionalism in L‚Äôart du jugement en th√©ologie (√âditions du Cerf, ‚ÄòCogitatio Fidei,‚Äô 2011) and again in Conventional and Ultimate Truth: A Key for Fundamental Theology (University of Notre Dame Press, ‚ÄòThresholds in Philosophy and Theology,‚Äô ed. Jeffrey Bloechl and Kevin Hart, 2015). The latter book expounds a basic method under the rubrics of reflective judgment and conventional truth. Then it visits seven loci that challenge theological thinking today: modernist literature, metaphysics and its overcoming, Scripture, religious experience, negative theology, religious pluralism, and dogma. In each case classical paradigms are unsettled and a more modest and flexible path of reflection and articulation is limned. These volumes on fundamental theology advance a view of doctrinal language that is increasingly influenced by the Buddhist dyad of conventional and ultimate truth. The basic thesis is that religious traditions can function as vehicles of ultimacy, but that to do so authentically and effectively they need to fully recognize their conventional status as linguistic constructions embedded in history. Warding off nominalism and relativism, O‚ÄôLeary argues against Derrida and Western interpreters of Nagarjuna on the notion of truth, in order to uphold the objective reference of doctrinal statements despite their conventional fabric. Further fruits of O‚ÄôLeary's engagement with Buddhist philosophy are his √âtienne Gilson lectures at the Institut Catholique de Paris, 2011 (published as Philosophie occidentale et concepts bouddhistes, PUF, 2011) and his forthcoming commentary on the Vimalakirti Sutra for the collection ‚ÄòChristian Commentaries on Non-Christian Sacred Texts‚Äô (ed. Catherine Cornille). Bibliography =Books (author)= *Questioning Back: The Overcoming of Metaphysics in Christian Tradition. Minneapolis: Winston- Seabury, 1985.

On 1 January 2011 the bank purchased fellow savings bank Banca Caripe from Banco Popolare. The enlarged banking group was also referred as Tercas Caripe. However, Tercas was acquired by Banca Popolare di Bari (BP Bari) in 2014, which in turn Tercas and Caripe became part of the BP Bari Group as divisions. A spin off organization of the bank, Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio della Provincia di Teramo or Fondazione Tercas, still operates as a charity organization and independent from Banca Popolare di Bari. History Cassa di Risparmio della Provincia di Teramo was found on 12 October 1939 (date of royal decree) by the merger of Casse di Risparmio di Atri and Casse di Risparmio di Nereto. On 24 June 1992, the bank was split into Tercas S.p.A. and a banking foundation. The banking foundation owned 80% shares of the societ√† per azioni (company limited by shares) , while one of the leading savings bank Cassa di Risparmio delle Provincie Lombarde (Cariplo) owned the rest of shares or 20%. Cariplo also owned 20% shares of fellow Abruzzo-based savings banks Carichieti and Caripe. In October 2006 Banca Tercas S.p.A. was founded. The banking foundation sold 15% shares they owned to the public.http://www.fondazionetercas.it/fondazione/presentazione/ Banca Intesa, the successor of Cariplo, retained their 20% shares.

On 1 January 2011 Banca Tercas acquired the controlling interests of Banca Caripe (95%) for ‚Ç¨228 million from Banco Popolare. Fondazione Pescara Abruzzo, the banking foundation which originated from Caripe, owned 3.5% shares of Banca Tercas as well as 5% of Banca Caripe. =Special administration= From 2012 to 30 September 2014, Banca Tercas was under special administration.

During the special administration, Fondo Interbancario di Tutela dei Depositi (FITD) contributed ‚Ç¨265 million to the bank as capital. =acquired by Banca Popolare di Bari= In November 2013 Banca Tercas was acquired by Banca Popolare di Bari (BP Bari). BP Bari subscribed the entire capital increase of Banca Tercas for ‚Ç¨230 million. After the capital increase, Banca Tercas had a CET1 capital ratio of 8.052%, in separate balance sheet at 30 September 2014 (Basel III basis). However, the ratio was fell back to just 7.025% as at 31 December 2014. (which the Bank of Italy required a minimum 4.5% that must maintained all the time, plus 2.5% buffer that should be restore as soon as possible) In December 2015 European Commission ruled that the bail-out of Banca Tercas by FITD was a state aid, requesting the bank to return the aid to the deposit guarantee fund.SA.39451 Aid to Banca Tercas FITD then set up a voluntary intervention mechanism to allow the member banks of FITD voluntary to inject capital again to Tercas for ‚Ç¨271,868,990.25 and other banks.Aiuti di Stato, risoluzioni bancarie e FITD (in Italian) At the same time, Banca Tercas S.p.A. was absorbed into BP Bari.

History  The Gadget Flow was founded in an apartment in Athens, Greece by college students Evan Varsamis, Cassie Ousta and Mike Chliounakis as a design inspiration blog. Its first revenues came from banner advertising around published content on new products from Greek designers and artists on Amazon.com and Etsy. The team added a ‚Äúbuy now‚Äù button after each product review that took the visitor to the artisan's website. In early 2013 the site's founders added digital advertising and social media services, but after seeing The Gadget Flow website traffic triple after a relaunch, they refocused on the core business. The company drew attention from its exhibitions at tech events and conferences, including Web Summit Dublin held in November 2014 and The Next Web Conference NYC held in November 2015. In 2014 the site launched iOS and Android applications for product search; product features include live video product reviews with interactive question-and-answer sessions. The company launched The Gadget Flow Shop in August 2016. In October 2016 The Next Web named The Gadget Flow one of the most promising tech startups of 2016.

Early life and education Whitmore was born at home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on November 17, 1915, to Marin Gertrude (Mason) and Frank Clifford Whitmore, then a graduate student at Harvard University and later a prominent chemist. In 1934, Whitmore enrolled as an English major at Amherst College, Massachusetts. To complete his science requirement Whitmore took historical geology taught by F. B. Loomis. Whitmore was the only student who signed up so Loomis geared the class heavily on vertebrate evolution, his research interest. By the end of that year, Whitmore decided he wanted to be a vertebrate paleontologist.\\"Cain, J. 1989. Oral history interview of Franck C. Whitmore, Jr., 8 August 1989. Smithsonian Institution Archives. Whitmore completed his B.S. cum laude with honorable mention in geology from Amherst centered on vertebrate paleontology and his M.S. from Penn State studying paleontology under Frank M. Swartz and stratigraphy under Paul Kimitrie Kyrine. Whitmore continued his education at Harvard University, studying under vertebrate paleontologist, Alfred Sherwood Romer. Whitmore was Romer's first student from the geology department; all previous students had been from biology. Whitmore's first real field experience in vertebrate paleontology came during the summer of 1940 when he traveled with the Harvard field crew to the Uinta Basin of Utah to collect fossil mammals. While working on his doctorate Whitmore served as a teaching fellow and university fellow in paleontology. Whitmore's doctoral study, suggested by Romer, was the cranial morphology of three Oligocene artiodactyls. Whitmore wrote, \\"It is the purpose of this study to examine in detail the cranial anatomy of some of these extinct genera, because endocranial characteristics are probably nonadaptive, that is, unlikely to be influenced by the environment, and therefore useful in determining the taxonomic position of groups of animals.\\"Whitmore, Frank C. 1953. Cranial morphology of some Oligocene Artiodactyla. United States Geological Survey Professional Paper 243-H: 117-159. For this study, a serial sectioning apparatus was designed and built by F. Russell Olsen of Harvard's Museum of Comparative Zoology. This sectioning technique, perfected for paleobotany with cellulose acetate peels, was adapted for vertebrates and described in a paper by Olsen and Whitmore.Olsen, F.R. and Whitmore, F.C., Jr. 1944. Machine for serial sectioning of fossils. Journal of Paleontology 18:210-215. It was a pioneering achievement in its approach and formed the basis of later work by others, in which details of cranial anatomy such as blood circulation, ear morphology, and brain configuration have been used in polygenetic studies of fossil mammals. Career as teacher, geologist and World War II Whitmore's first postgraduate job was a teaching position at Rhode Island State College (now the University of Rhode Island) from 1942 to 1944. When the Army Specialized Training Program came to the college, he also taught economic and political geography. Preparation for these courses aided him most in the next phase of his career. In March of 1944, Whitemore was hired by the U.S. Geological Survey to edit classified reports in the one-year old Military Geology Unit. By September of 1945, he had become chief editor, supervising four geologists and 15 typists and draftsmen. Whitmore moved to the Engineer Intelligence Division, Southwest Pacific Area. His position as scientific consultant on terrain intelligence took him first to Manila, where he organized the Natural Resources Section of the General Headquarters of the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, in preparation for the occupation of Japan. After two months, he relocated to Tokyo, where he served as chief of the Engineering Geology Unit, Natural Resources Section. He supervised the field checking of terrain intelligence reports and consulted with the U.S. Army on foundation conditions, location of construction materials, and selection of airfield and port sites. Whitmore became a commodity specialist in precious metals, compiling data on gold and silver production in Japan. As Whitmore tells it, \\"Since I was the paleontologist and didn't know much, they looked around for the least harmful thing for me to do. That's how I was put in charge of the precious metals. My job was mainly to hold audience with Japanese gold and silver mine operations and tell them 'no,' they could not mine gold. It was the perfect bureaucrat's job, sitting there all day saying 'no.' I was also in charge of the vaults of Japan, where I saw more money than I will ever see again, with piles of sheet gold one meter on a side.\\"Paleo News. There were also stacks of platinum crucibles and \\"buckets of diamonds.\\" One example the unit's work was the identification of where Japanese Fire Bomb Balloons were being launched. From late 1944 until early 1945, the Japanese launched over 9,300 of fire balloons, of which 300 were found or observed in the U.S. Despite the high hopes of their designers, the balloons were ineffective as weapons; causing only six deaths (from one single incident) and a small amount of damage. Some of the ballast sandbags dropped by the balloons were taken to the Military Geology Unit for investigation. The geologists began microscopic and chemical examination of the sand to determine types and distribution of diatoms and other microscopic sea creatures, and its mineral composition. They determined that the sand could not be coming from American beaches, nor from the mid-Pacific. It had to be coming from Japan. The geologists ultimately determined the precise beaches in Japan where the sand had been taken.Whitmore, Frank C., Jr. 1954. ‚ÄúMilitary Geology.‚Äù The Military Engineer, Volume XLVI, number 311, pages 212-215C; M. Nelson and E. P. F. Rose. 2012. \\"The U. S. Geological Survey's Military Geology Unit in World War II: the Army's pet prophets.\\" Quarterly Journal of Engineering Geology and Hydrogeology (August 2012), 45(3):349-367. In 1946 the U.S. Army recognized his work with the highest civilian award the United States bestows, the Medal of Freedom. While Whitmore was working in Japan a controversy broke out. The story of Peking Man fossils involved bones of Sinathropus pekingenis and other relics, which the Japanese had earlier stolen from China. Whitmore, as part of his duties, was to take custody of these specimens, pending their return to the National Geological Survey of China. But there had always been disagreement over the actual location of the specimens and the sequence of events prior to Whitmore's arrival on the scene. According to one story, in 1941 the specimens were packed in three cases marked \\"secret\\" and turned over to the U.S. Marines who were evacuating Chinwangtao, China, aboard the Dollar Line President Harrison. The liner ran aground in the Yangtze River near Shanghai on December 8, and the marines were captured. There is documentary evidence that scientists from the Tokyo Imperial University visited Peking in August, 1942, at the request of the Japanese North China Army and took the collection to Tokyo. After the surrender of Japan to the Allied powers, a letter from the Central Liaison Office of Japan alerted the Allies to the collection's existence. The natural Resources Section was directed to take action to return the specimens, and the section chief dispatched Whitmore to examine the collation. In his memo, Whitmore stated he could \\"find no traces of Sinanthropus.\\"Lamp, J., and Weiwen, H. 1990. The story of Peking Man: From archaeology to mystery. Foreign Language Press, Beijing, China and Oxford University Press, Hong Kong. Many believe the fossils rest at the bottom of the Yangtze River. To this day, the original fossils have never been recovered, but good casts exist and excavations at the Peking Man site have turned up additional specimens. In the spring of 1946 Whitmore was assigned to the 24th Corps. U.S. Army in Korea to survey and map railroads, major highways, landing beaches and ports, including Inchon, which played an important part in the later U.S. invasion. While in Korea, Whitmore was promoted to chief of the Military Geology Unit. After the war it was assumed that the Military Geology Unit would be shut down, but the war had demonstrated to the U.S. military how little it knew about foreign geology, and so the unit was transformed into the regular branch of the U.S. Geological Survey. Whitmore stayed on as chief until 1959. The branch directed worldwide activities employing about 120 scientists and support personnel, with headquarters in Washington, D.C. and field offices in Tokyo, Heidelberg, and Salzburg. Whitmore organized interdisciplinary field-mapping programs involving the study of geology, soils, vegetation, hydrology, and topography. Whitmore chaired numerous groups including the U.S. Geological Survey's Geologic Division Staffing Committee and the committee to compile permafrost terms for the first and second editions of the American Geological Institute's Glossary of Geology. He also served as security officer for the Geologic Division between 1948 and 1956. In recognition of the International Geophysical Year in 1958, the Lake Peters Research Station (renamed the G. William Holmes Research Station in 1970) was established in the northeastern part of the Brooks Range of Alaska. Whitmore was on the team that conducted the initial reconnaissance at this offshoot of the Arctic Research Laboratory at Point Barrow and formulated plans for continuing research in the area. Career as vertebrate paleontologist After 15 years of administration, Whitmore joined the Paleontology and Stratigraphy Branch of the U.S. Geological Survey as a senior specialist in vertebrate paleontology. He was assigned an office at the National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution. Whitmore became the informal chief of the survey's vertebrate paleontology staff, which included Charles Repenning at the Menlo Park, California, office and Ed Lewis at the Denver, Colorado, office. Whitmore launched a series of diverse investigations. In 1959 and 1960, he collected and studied Miocene and Pleistocene vertebrates from Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, as part of the work done by the Engineering Geology Branch. His biostratigraphy of that complexly deformed area helped determine the history of Pleistocene deformation on the island. From 1959 through 1965, Whitmore conducted biostratigraphic studies of Paleozoic and Mesozoic fish and Tertiary mammals from Wyoming and Montana to aid ongoing geologic mapping there. He was principal investigator for field and laboratory studies of Miocene mammals from Panama between 1962 and 1965. This work resulted many accomplishments including a biostratigraphic correlation with faunas in Texas and Florida, established that the Miocene mammalian fauna of Panama was entirely of North American affinity, helped to define a circum-Caribbean Miocene zoogeographic province and delineated the southern extent of the North American land mass. These results were published in Science.Whitmore, Frank C. Jr. and R.H. Stewart. 1965. Miocene mammals and Central American seaways. Science 148 (3667): 180-185. At about the same time, Whitmore began collaborating with C. Bertrand Schulz and Lloyd Tanner of the University of Nebraska on work at Big Bone Lick, Kentucky. This important Pleistocene site is the type locality of Mammut americanum, the American mastodon, and Bootherium bombifrons, an extinct musk ox. It was also the site where, on Thomas Jefferson's orders, explorers Lewis and Clark collected bones for shipment back to the amateur scientist and president of the Unites States. The team's field work and research of the late Pleistocene mammals and stratigraphy of Kentucky from 1963 through 1970 contributed to the first geomorphological and paleoclimatological understanding of the Ohio valley.Whitmore, Frank C. Jr., C.B. Schultz, L.G. Tanner, L.L. Ray, and E.C. Crawford. 1963. Paleontologic investigations at Big Bone Lick State Park, Kentucky: A preliminary report. Science 142 (3596): 1167-1169; Whitmore, Frank C. Jr., C.B. Schultz and L.G. Tanner. 1966. Pleistocene mammal and stratigraphy of Big Bone Lick State Park, Kentucky. Geological Society of American Special Paper 87:262-163. After five summers of field work, their results helped convince the state of Kentucky to create Big Bone Lick State Park, ensuring preservation of the site. For his efforts, Whitemore was anointed an Honorable Kentucky Colonel by the state. It was during this time that Whitmore and colleagues also undertook the study of Pleistocene vertebrate fossils found on the Atlantic continental shelf. These studies, based largely on fossil elephant teeth dredged up by hard clam vessels, helped to establish sea level changes and its effect on paleozoogeography.Whitmore, Frank C. Jr., K.O. Emery, H.B.S. Cooke and D.J.P. Swift. 1967. Elephant teeth from the Atlantic continental shelf. Science 156 (3781): 1477-1489. Meanwhile, Whitmore was also being exposed to fossil marine mammals, thanks to his close association with Remington Kellogg, who worked in the Paleobiology Department of the National Museum of Natural History. Whitmore increasingly helped the elder paleontologist and, after his death in 1969, took over some of his work. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, Whitmore was principal investigator for the Calvert Cliffs Paleontology Project on Chesapeake Bay.Whitmore, Frank C. Jr. 1971. Calvert Cliffs project. Science 173 (1993): 192-193. This project entailed detailed interdisciplinary paleoecological and stratigraphic studies during excavation for the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant. Funding for this work came from the Ford Foundation and National Geographic Society. From this association with National Geographic Society Whitmore was asked to join the Committee for Research and Exploration, serving as Kellogg's replacement. The committee provides funding for research projects throughout the world. Whitmore later served as vice-chair of the National Geographic Society's Committee for Research and Exploration. In 1972, Whitmore returned to Alaska, this time to Amchitka Island, where he collected fossils of the historically extinct Steller's sea cow (Hydrodamalis gigas).Whitmore, Frank C. Jr., L.M. Gard, Jr. and G. E. Lewis. 1972. Steller's sea cow in Pleistocene interglacial beach deposits on Amchitka, Aleutian Islands. Geological Society of America Bulletin 83: 867-870. He and others worked on the rate and mode of Pleistocene uplift of the island, as indicated by beach deposits, which were critical to the prediction of effects by nuclear testing. Work on Oligocene whales from South Carolina resulted in two publications, one in 1974 and one in 1976.Whitmore, Frank C. Jr. and A. E. Sanders. 1974. The Cetacea 30 million years ago. American Zoologist 15: 812; Whitmore and Sanders. 1976. Review of the Oligocene Cetacea. Systematic Zoology 25:304-320. During the 1970s Whitmore was principal investigator on the study of Paleocene vertebrates from Saudi Arabia. Paleoecological studies of this estuarine fauna established the geographical position of part of the ancient Tethys Sea, and contributed to the delineation of lime deposits needed for cement manufacture.Whitmore, Frank C. Jr., C.T. Madden, I.M. Nagvi, D.L. Schmidt, W. Langston, Jr., and R. C. Wood. 1979. Paleocene vertebrates from coastal deposits on the Harrat Hadan area, At Taif region, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. United States Geological Survey, Aaudi Arabian Mission, Project Report 269, Open-file Report OF-80-227. Part of Whitmore's duties at the U.S. Geological Survey, involved handling \\"examination and report\\" (E & R) requests. Some were submitted by colleagues in other disciplines whose investigations turned up bone specimens. Others came in via USGS public-relations people from citizens who wanted to know about something they found in their backyard or while on vacation. One E & R stood out above all the others, \\"The Case of the Papal Proboscidean.\\" Sylvio Bedini, then deputy director of the National Museum of History and Technology (now the National Museum of American History) asked Whitmore to identify, from photographs, some bones dug up during the air-conditioning of the papal apartments in the Vatican. Everyone was puzzled when Whitmore identified at least one bone as that of an elephant. Further research revealed that in 1541, when Pope Leon X had control of the spice trade to the Far East, King Emmanuel the Great of Portugal wanted a share of the action. To get on the good side of the pope, Emmanuel presented him with a young elephant. No elephant had been seen in Rome since the time of Hannibal, and it proved to be a great curiosity especially as it had been trained to genuflect whenever the pope appeared. It also held water in its trunk and squirted designated victims on the command of its trainer. One day, the elephant's keepers decided they would gild the elephant from head to toe as a surprise for the pope. The surprise was that the gilding killed the elephant. The devastated pope directed the papal painter, who happened to be Raphael, to paint a life-size mural of the elephant; Raphael felt this was beneath him and ordered an apprentice to complete the mural on the palace wall. The elephant was subsequently buried beneath the painting. The mural is now gone but the bones remain.Whitmore, Frank C. Jr. 1978. The papal proboscidean. The Cross Section 9 (3):12. Whitmore retired from the U.S. Geological Survey in 1984, but he continued his work as a research associate and curator emeritus of the Smithsonian Institution in his old office there until the late 1990s. His later studies included taxonomy and description of fossil Pliocene whales and terrestrial mammals from the Lee Creek phosphate mine at Aurora, North Carolina, and description of Miocene marine mammals from the Pisco Formation of Peru. Administrator, manager, service and awards Whitmore was appointed chair of the joint U.S. Geological Survey/Smithsonian Institution committees for the design of new labs and for decisions regarding the paleontology collections. In 1971, he was general chair of the Geological Society of America meetings in Washington, with 4300 people attending. For the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the Mexican Science Council, he chaired a symposium on land connections between North and South America. The list of institutions and committees that Whitmore served on include the Department of Defense, American Geological Institute, National Research Council and the scientific guidance to the Schoelkopf Geological Museum in Niagara Falls, New York, the Calvert Marine Museum in Solomons, Maryland and to exhibit specialists at the National Museum of Natural History. In 1979 Whitmore served as general chair of the International Centennial Symposium of the U.S. Geological Survey on \\"Resources for the 21st Century\\" which brought together were some 500 scientists, corporate executives, and government officials from 48 countries. Whitmore was a founding member of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology in 1940; he later served on its executive board and was an honorary life member. Whitmore was the last surviving charter member of the society. Whitmore joined the Paleontological Society of American in 1942. In 1944 he joined the Paleontological Society of Washington, later serving as vice president and president. That same year, he joined the Geological Society of Washington, becoming a councilor, secretary, first vice-president, and then president. In 1945, he helped found the Geological Society of the Philippines. Whitmore became a fellow of the Geological Society of America in 1947, and served on its Penrose Medal Committee and as its Penrose citationist. Three years later, he became a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, eventually serving as section secretary and chairman, councilor, and chair of the Newcomb Cleveland Prize Committee. Legacy In recognition of Whitmore's contribution to the National Geographic Society and to the marine mammal paleontological community, a publication on marine mammalian paleontology was dedicated to him entitled Contributions in Marine Mammal Paleontology Honoring Frank C. Whitmore, Jr.Ralph E. Eshelman and Lauck W. Ward. 1994. Tribute to Frank Clifford Whitmore, Jr. In: A. Berta and Tom A. Dem√©r√© (eds), Contributions in Marine Mammal Paleontology Honoring Frank C. Whitmore, Jr. Proc. San Diego Soc. Nat. Hist. 29:3-1. In 2002 the Virginia Museum of Natural History awarded Whitmore the Thomas Jefferson Medal for Outstanding Contributions to Natural Science. This award is annually presented to an individual who has consistently made outstanding contributions to natural history. Two fossil cetaceans are named after Whitmore in his honor: the large squalodontid Squalodon whitmorei, and the early toothless mysticete Eomysticetus whitmorei. Whitmore died at age 96 at his home on March 18, 2012.

The most common refractory ores are pyrite and arsenopyrite, which are sulfide ores that trap the gold within them. Refractory ores require pre-treatment before the gold can be adequately extracted. The pressure oxidation process is used to prepare such ores for conventional gold extraction processes such as cyanidation. It is performed in an autoclave at high pressure and temperature, where high-purity oxygen mixes with a slurry of ore. When the original sulfide minerals are oxidized at high temperature and pressure, it completely releases the trapped gold. Pressure oxidation has a very high gold recovery rate, normally at least 10% higher than roasting. The oxidation of the iron sulfide minerals produces sulfuric acid, soluble compounds such as ferric sulfate, and solids such as iron sulfate or jarosite. The iron-based solids produced pose an environmental challenge, as they can release acid and heavy metals to the environment. They can also make later precious metal recovery more difficult. Arsenic in the ore is converted to solid scorodite inside the autoclave, allowing it to be easily disposed of. This is an advantage over processes such as roasting where these toxic products are released as gases. A disadvantage of pressure oxidation is that any silver in the feed material will often react to form silver jarosite inside the autoclave, making it difficult and expensive to recover the silver. An example of a mine utilizing this technology is the Pueblo Viejo mine in the Dominican Republic. At Pueblo Viejo, the process is performed by injecting high-purity oxygen into autoclaves operating at 230 degrees C and 40 bar of pressure. The resulting chemical reactions oxides the sulfide minerals the gold is trapped within. The oxidation of pyrite is highly exothermic, allowing the autoclave to operate at this temperature without an external heat source.

Biography  He is seen in the media and recognized by international critics as one of the most important and influential artists of his generation. However, since the beginning of his career, the artist has refused to allow his biography to be published. Most of the biographies available are therefore knowingly incorrect or incomplete. His work is organized into projects rather than exhibitions. His first, Silence goes more quickly when played backwards, took place in 2005 at the Plateau/Frac √Æle-de-France (Paris). This was the project that rocketed him onto the international art scene. In 2008, he became the first artist to be granted full use of the Palais de Tokyo in Paris for his project Cellar Door. He developed and continued this project at the ICA in London, the Kunsthalle Sankt Gallen (Switzerland), the museum La Conservera de Murcia (Spain) and finally at the Vienna Kunsthalle (Austria), ending at Art Basel alongside the publication of a catalogue by JRP Ringier that charted the entire project. Although international collectors and museums have made some important acquisitions of his work, Greaud chooses to appear only occasionally in galleries and markets. He has had only one double exhibition in the galleries that represent him. The Unplayed Notes was presented at the Pace Gallery in New York City and then at the Yvon Lambert Gallery in Paris in 2012. In 2013, he was the first artist to be invited to exhibit jointly by the Louvre and the Pompidou Center in Paris. The double exhibition, Loris Gr√©aud [I] was free to the public and took place in the museums‚Äô courtyards, purposefully avoiding the usual exhibition spaces of the two institutions. In 2014, he was appointed as a Knight in the Order of Arts and Letters (Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres). In 2015, for his project The Unplayed Notes Museum, he became the first artist to take over the entire space of the Dallas Contemporary (USA). In 2016, he produces the Sculpt project specifically for the LACMA in Los Angeles, his first exhibition on the West Coast of the United States. In 2017, he attracted the attention of the 57th Venice Biennale with his project The Unplayed Notes Factory in Murano (Italy) In 2019, the Tel Aviv Museum of Art hosts the monographic project: Sculpt: Grumpy Bear, the Great Spinoff, as a continuation of its first exhibition at LACMA in 2016. Recently, the exhibition The Original, The Translation shed light on the artist's entire publishing activity at the Biblioth√®que Kandinsky I Centre Georges Pompidou after all the works produced by the artist were added to its holdings and documentary collections. After acquiring the work MACHINE in 2018, the Mus√©e d'Art Moderne de Paris invited Loris Gr√©aud to design a specific exhibition, as part of the permanent collections, entitled Glorius Read. In 2020, after several years of development with the Casa Wabi Foundation, Loris Gr√©aud will inaugurate a perennial project entitled The Underground Sculpture Park. The artist has chosen some twenty works emblematic of his production, which will be buried for eternity in the gardens of Alberto Kalach, which are an extension of the architecture designed by Tadao Ando. Since 2010, the artist has rarely participated in group shows, preferring to concentrate his resources on developing personal projects. The artist sees \\"the trajectory of the work through time as a sculpture in its own right.\\"  Artistic approach  His method is characterized by prioritizing the project‚Äôs idea over the exhibition. Loris Gr√©aud believes that only the idea and the project itself should be the governing principles, defining in particular the conditions of appearance, display, distribution, and even the length of time and cost. Productivity and efficiency based in the reality of his projects are the focal point of his practice. He also pays special attention to systematically erasing the limits between the spaces of fiction and reality. One of the common characteristics among the various projects of Loris Greaud is their scale. By producing work of this magnitude with a global vision, he aims to overwhelm the space and time of the \\"exhibition\\".  Discussions, collaborations  Loris Gr√©aud has on several occasions engaged in \\"specific discussions \\" , an essential element in his practice, with professionals from all fields, in an attempt to provide productive answers to his aesthetic questions : Since 2004, with David Lynch, on the occasion of the conception of his work Eye of The Duck, then in 2012 for his project The Snorks: a concert for creatures. In 2009, with Lee Ranaldo, for the conception of the work Think Loud, then for his film The Unplayed Notes in 2012. In 2011-12, with M.I.T. of Boston, and the ANTARES station, as well as with Pr Michel Andr√©'s LAB for his project The Snorks: a concert for creatures. On the same occasion, with the hip-hop abstract group Anti-Pop Consortium. In 2012, with the CNRS for the production of his film The Unplayed Notes. With NASA and more specifically the Stennis Space Center , for his film Sculpt and the subsequent spinoff Grumpy Bear, in 2016. Between 2014 and 2016, with Claude Parent, who also appears, notably in his film Sculpt. In 2016 with the CENIR of the ICM, again for his film Sculpt.

From 1867 to 1869 he was assistant to William Thomson, Lord Kelvin, being the joint-builder of the technical equipment which Kelvin used to measure electrostatic energy. In 1869 he also assisted Kelvin in the laying of the first Transatlantic communication cables. The French company overseeing the work were impressed by Dickson and kept him in their employ as Electrician-in-Charge, based in Brest until 1870.Who Was Who, 2014:J D H Dickson He then returned to Cambridge to collaborate with W H King and Theophillus Varley in creating more of Lord Kelvin‚Äôs machines, including the siphon recorder.

He was deputy for Haute-Garonne from 1897 to 1914, and was Minister of Agriculture from 24 February 1905 to 2 November 1910. He was known for promoting agricultural cooperatives Life =Early career= Joseph Ruau was born in Paris on 5 June 1865. He was grandson of the mathematician Joseph Liouville and son of a director-general of the Mint. He obtained a doctorate in Law and joined the Toulouse bar as an attorney. He was elected municipal councilor and mayor of Aspet, Haute-Garonne, then general councilor for Aspet in the departmental assembly. Ruau was elected to the legislature as deputy for Haute-Garonne in a byelection on 30 May 1897, and sat with the Radical Democrats. He was reelected in 1898, 1902, 1906 and for the last time in 1910. He was secretary of the Chamber twice, in 1898 and 1899, and rapporteur for the agriculture budget several times. As vice-president of the radical left he supported the governments of Pierre Waldeck-Rousseau and √âmile Combes. =Minister of Agriculture= 1910 caricature by Aristide Delannoy Ruau was appointed Minister of Agriculture on 24 February 1905 in the cabinet of Maurice Rouvier and retained this office in the cabinets of Ferdinand Sarrien, Georges Clemenceau and Aristide Briand until 2 November 1910. In 1906 he presented a law that organized long-term financing of agricultural cooperatives by the Cr√©dit agricole banks. The cooperatives were defined as societies of people rather than of capital based on the principle of \\"one man, one vote\\" in which profits were shared. The state offered guarantees to the banks. Ruau issued a decree to regulate the organization and operation of horse racing. He proposed measures to assist farm laborers who had suffered work accidents and southern wine growers ruined by the fall in the price of wine that followed the losses due to phylloxera. On 5 July 1908 Ruau spoke at the second national conference on mutual credit and agricultural cooperation at Blois. He pointed out that the state was promoting a rural, property-owning democracy. This was true, but he gave an exaggerated view of the benefits of recent legislation in promoting agricultural syndicates and mutual aid societies. He overstated the influence of his government in promoting rural cooperation, which had been developing for over a century but still had far to go. He supported the creation in 1910 of a radical federation of capitalist farmers of the Parisian Basin in competition to the very conservative Union Centrale des Syndicats des Agriculteurs de France. =Last years= Ruau suffered a physical and mental collapse due to the strain of office, and was placed in a nursing home in Ivry-sur-Seine in late 1910. He died there on 29 September 1923 at the age of 58.

Interpretation This parable is the final one in the chapter of Matthew 13. It tells of a Jew or a Hebrew Scribe who is converted to Christianity. This parable, like the rest of the parables in Matthew 13, describes the Kingdom of Heaven as the Church or the body of Christ. Here an Old Testament scribe who is converted to Christianity is compared to a house owner who brings out old and new things from his household. As we can understand from the passage, the scribe is the house owner. The difficulty is around the phrase \\"new and old\\". This can be interpreted as the new and old testaments in the bible. As a scribe who rewrites the Torah knows it better than anyone, so when he became a disciple of the New Testament or the teachings of Jesus, he will be able teach from both the old and new testaments. This parable also gives a hint that studying the old testament only would not make a person to go to heaven. If one longs to be a true Christian he needs to study the new testament also.

It has been described as a \\"hot commodity for any government offensive\\", but their relatively small numbers make it difficult to deploy them to multiple fronts at once.  History  According to Gregory Waters, the Tiger Forces are operated by the Air Force Intelligence Directorate.p. 2https://www.bellingcat.com/news/mena/2016/11/30/assad-regime-militias-and- shiite-jihadis-in-the-syrian-civil-war/ After successful operations in Latakia and Hama,p. 2 Colonel Suheil al-Hassan was tasked a special project by the Syrian Armed Forces Central Command in the fall of 2013‚Äîto train and lead a Special Forces unit that would work primarily as an offensive unit. Colonel Hassan handpicked many of the soldiers that would later form the Tiger Forces. Initially, the unit was formed by recruiting personnel from the 53rd Regiment (part of Special Forces Command) and the 14th Special Forces Division, on the other hand, heavy equipment was supplied by the 4th and 11th Divisions.https://www.mei.edu/publications/lion-and-eagle-syrian-arab-armys- destruction-and-rebirth On 25 December 2015, Suheil al-Hassan was promoted to major general after refusing to be brigadier general the year before. He played a key role in commanding Syrian troops during the 2016 Aleppo campaign. The Tiger Forces were tasked with cutting the key rebel supply lines to Aleppo city. In early spring 2015, following Syrian government's loss of the city of Idlib, the unit was reorganised.p. 3 The Tiger Forces were one of few in the Syrian Army to first deploy Russian T-90 tanks, others being the 4th Armoured Division and Desert Hawks Brigade. A Russian-supplied Rys LMV was seen after defeating ISIL in the village of Ayn Al-Hanish in the Dayr Hafir Plains. The most famous and effective tactic of the Tiger Forces is probing the enemy from multiple axes to find a weak spot, then sending a large mechanized force to that area to capture many villages at once. According to Gregory Waters, they ultimately report to Major General Jamil Hassan, the director of the country's Air Force Intelligence Directorate. In September/October 2018, reports indicated that between 6500 and 8000 Tiger Forces members will be demobilized.http://www.syriahr.com/en/?p=104307 = Renaming and reorganization = On 29 August 2019, the Syrian Government reorganized the unit, renaming it from Tiger Forces to 25th Special Mission Forces Division and placing it under the Syrian Army's central command, while keeping Maj. Gen. Suheil al-Hassan as its commanding officer.  Organisation  According to Gregory Waters for the Middle East Institute in October 2018, the Tiger Forces deploy approximately 24 groups (halfway between a company and a battalion), which organise about 4,000 infantry, as well as an attached artillery regiment and an armoured unit.p. 6 Alongside permanent troops, the Tiger Forces make use of affiliated militia, who remain largely garrisoned in their hometowns until called on to join offensives as the need arises. = List of subordinate units in 2018 = Later reports seem to suggest an altered internal structure, stating that the unit consists of the following subunits:http://www.janes.com/images/assets/474/75474/Syrian_army_prepares_for_post- conflict_challenges.pdf * Termah (or Tarmeh) Group/Regiment: according opposition sources has a strength of about 2,000 troops, recruited from northern Hama.p. 6 * Taha Group, officially \\"Taha Regiment- Assault\\".

Built in 1818, it is one of a modest number of these once-common structures left in the state. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. Description and history The Pownal Cattle Pound is located about northeast of the center of Pownal, on the northwest side of Maine State Route 9. It is located in Bradbury Mountain State Park, which the road passes through, with the eponymous mountain rising north of the structure. The pound is a rectangular stone structure, built of dry-laid fieldstone, with an opening near the northeast corner. The walls currently vary between and in height, but were probably originally in height; the difference is due in part to collapse, and in part to use of some of the stone in local road projects in the 1950s. As built, the walls were thick at the base and thick at the top, and would have been topped by a timber beams. The opening was originally topped by a long granite lintel, which now lies on the ground inside the enclosure, and would have been closed off by an iron gate. Since early colonial days, most New England communities used animal pounds as a means to pen in stray livestock until it could be recovered by its owner. The town of Pownal, incorporated in 1808, hired John Tyler to construct this pound for $50 in 1817; he completed it the following year. The land on which it was located belonged to the Cotton family, who owned Bradbury Mountain and the surrounding area, and whose house stood nearby until it burned down in 1929. Thomas Cotton was hired as the town's first poundkeeper. The pound was used until 1891, by which time changes in technology (mainly the advent of barbed wire) and a reduction in farming had rendered it obsolete. At the time of its National Register listing in 2004, it was one of about twenty such structures left in the state.

Fishguard is to the northwest. The area was occupied in neolithic and Norman times, and in the past two centuries has been sparsely populated with no significant settlements developing. The parish church is dedicated to St John the Baptist. Geography Morvil is in the community of Puncheston. The area of the parish is and includes the settlement at Greenway crossroads. In the north of the parish is Mynydd Morvil at , to the south is Mynydd Castlebythe at and in the east is Banc Du at , making the parish, with an average elevation of some , nearly surrounded by mountains. Afon Anghof, a feeder river for the Western Cleddau, rises in the northeast and flows westwards through the parish. The B4313 road runs through the parish and the B4329 cuts across the southeast corner; all other roads are unclassified. Most of the parish lies within the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park.Ordnance Survey Landranger series, Map 145 History Morfil seen from Vaynor Isaf with the disused GWR line in between In the northeast of the parish is Banc Du on which is a neolithic enclosure (the first confirmed in Wales and mid-west Britain) which would have been occupied in the fourth and third millennia BC and is contemporary with megalithic tombs such as the long barrow at Pentre Ifan. A degraded earthwork on Mynydd Morvil is marked on a 19th century map as Castell and as Earthwork on modern maps. Richard Fenton recounted a local tradition that a battle or skirmish was fought there between the Normans under Martin de Turribus (founder of Newport Castle) and the Welsh, a few days after his landing at Fishguard. The Welsh were repulsed. Samuel Lewis, in his Topographical Dictionary of 1833 states: It is possible that the name Morvil is Norman- French, similar to another village near Newport: Bayvil. In the Taxacio of 1291 the parish is named as Morvin, possibly erroneously. In the 13th century the manor of Redwalls (now Fagwyr Goch) was established to the west of Banc Du, and in 1293 Robert de Vale (Lord of Trefgarn) was granted a weekly market and three-day annual fair. The manor was still held by the Barony of Cemaes in 1594 but subsequently declined. In 1594 Morvil was assessed as two carucates of ploughland. Morvil appears on a 1578 parish map of Pembrokeshire. Church records for the parish go back at least to 1653. In the Hearth Tax assessments of 1670, in Morvill (sic) there were six people liable: William Edward, Jenkin Llewhelin, Owen Gwyther, David Young, Thomas John and Richard Morice; three were listed as paupers: Gwenllian John, Rees Edward and Walter Daniell. Morvil is mentioned by Fenton in 1811 as being the home of Thomas Lloyd, Esq., and the Lloyds were a significant presence in the 17th century: among the items listed in an inventory of David Lloyd of Morvil in 1603 were a number of silver utensils. The houses of the wealthy were also a target for thieves; in the same year labourer David ap Ieuan was indicted for stealing silver items worth more than ¬£13 from the mansion of Thomas Lloyd of Kilkiffeth. Much of Morvil was unenclosed moorland until late 18th century enclosures resulted in large, regular fields, a process completed by the 1839 tithe survey. In 1833 the parish had 201 inhabitants, the highest since the first census in 1801. By 1872, the parish‚Äôs population was 125, with 26 houses. The population had fallen to 84 by 1961. A branch line of the Great Western Railway (GWR) once ran through the parish, but there was no halt in Morfil. GWR was authorised to build and maintain this 13 mile line to Llanwnda in the late 1880s. Parish church Ruined porch and neglected churchyard at Morvil church in 2008 The parish church of St John the Baptist is in the south of the parish. The Religious Census of 1851 stated the church to be ‚Äúnot yet in proper repair‚Äù, but the present structure dates from 1885-1893 and was photographed in poor condition in 2008. There are inscribed stones in the graveyard, in which the last burial was 1968. There are no chapels in the parish.

The bank was formed on 22 November 2015 to replace the old Cassa di Risparmio della Provincia di Chieti S.p.A. which was under special administration from 2014 to 2015. The bank was bought by UBI Banca on 18 January 2017 for a nominal fee. Cassa di Risparmio della Provincia di Chieti S.p.A. was the successor of the bank that known as \\"Cassa di Risparmio della Provincia di Chieti\\", which was under legal reconstruction in 1990s. The former legal entity of \\"Cassa di Risparmio della Provincia di Chieti\\" became Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio della Provincia di Chieti, which was the majority shareholder of the S.p.A. before its failure in 2015. History Cassa di Risparmio della Provincia di Chieti was found in 1938 by the merger of Cassa di Risparmio Marrucina (found 1862) and Cassa di Risparmio di Guardiagrele. In 1992, Due to , the statutory corporation was split into a \\"company limited by shares\\" Cassa di Risparmio della Provincia di Chieti S.p.A. (in short Carichieti S.p.A.), and a banking foundation Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio della Provincia di Chieti (\\"Fondazione Chieti\\" in short). The foundation was the owner of Carichieti S.p.A. for 80%, with Cariplo owned 20%. Cariplo also owned 20% shares of Abruzzo savings banks Caripe and Tercas. Intesa Sanpaolo, as the successor of Cariplo, still owned a minority interests in the bank until 2014 bankruptcy. =Insolvency = The company was under special administration (A.S.) from 2014. The last annual report of the bank, shown the bank had a shareholders' equity of ‚Ç¨200 million and a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.80% as at 31 December 2013. The administrator from the Bank of Italy had made asset quality review, forcing the bank to make more provision to their non-performing loans. In 2015 one of the two Italian deposit guarantee fund Fondo Interbancario di Tutela dei Depositi (which most of the banks except BCC banking group belongs to) had planned to bail-out CariChieti and 3 other banks that were also under A.S., but they were bail-out by instead, for a recapitalisation of ‚Ç¨2 billion (‚Ç¨141 million for CariChieti). European Commission ruled that the bail out of Banca Tercas by FITD in 2014 was a state aid, while new Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive of EU required to bail-in some investors of the bank before any state intervention. The Italian National Resolution Fund had also injected a combined ‚Ç¨1.7 billion to Banca Marche, Banca Etruria, Carife, and CariChieti to cover the losses. After forming the good bank and the bank bank, the old bank would be liquidated, which the shareholders and subordinated bond holders of the old bank would receive nothing due to bail-in. After the bail-in, the banking foundation had a net assets of just ‚Ç¨11 million (decreased from ‚Ç¨89 million) at 31 December 2015, due to the total write-off of the value of the shares of the old bank. On 3 May 2016, Decree-Law N¬∞59/2016 was announced, which the retail investors of the bond of the 4 banks would be refunded (up to ‚Ç¨100,000, same as deposit insurance) if they purchased the bond on or before 12 June 2014, the date of Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive was passed. The decree-law was a response to criticism of the bail-in of all junior investor of the bank, which Italian bank often sold risky bond of themselves to their depositors. The refund scheme: Fondo di solidariet√†, would be managed by FITD. =Nuova Carichieti / Banca Teatina= On 22 November 2015 the bank split into a \\"good\\" and \\"bad bank\\", the foundation lost the control on the company, which had no assets but share capital and subordinated debt. The new bank had a share capital of ‚Ç¨141 million and a Tier 1 capital ratio of estimated 9%. While the bad loans were transferred to a single \\"bad bank\\" REV - Gestione Crediti, which was shared with Carife, Banca Etruria and Banca Marche. The transfer was completed in January 2016. The rescue of the four banks was in line with EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive, which the Bank of Italy was the national resolution authority of the Single Resolution Mechanism. At 31 December 2015, CariChieti had a net equity of ‚Ç¨117 million and a CET1 ratio of 9.53%. On 12 January 2017, UBI Banca made a biding bid of a nominal ‚Ç¨1 for Nuova CariChieti, Nuova Banca Etruria and Nuova Banca Marche. The banking group also requested conditions that the balance sheets of the three banks would be cleaned up before the completion of the deal (which was done by selling NPLs to Atlante II and Credito Fondiario) as well as recapitalized the banks for an estimated ‚Ç¨450 million (eventually ‚Ç¨713 million). On 18 January the bid was accepted. On 10 May, the transaction was completed, which Nuova CariChieti was renamed to Banca Teatina (effective in September). On the same day, a plan to merge the 3 banks into UBI Banca was also announced. Banking foundation The former largest shareholder of the bank, which the bank (as a s.p.a.) was spin off from, now known as Fondazione Chieti ‚Äì Abruzzo e Molise.

He founded the localist group Hong Kong Indigenous with other activists who were dissatisfied with the efficacy of Hong Kong's mainstream democratic movement during the 2014 Hong Kong protests. He took an active part in the Mong Kok civil unrest on Lunar New Year's Day (8 February) 2016 and was arrested later that month. Early life and career He was born in Hong Kong in 1993 and studied at the Tang Shiu Kin Victoria Government Secondary School and the Caritas Bianchi College of Careers and worked as a freelance interior designer.  Founding of Hong Kong Indigenous  Wong participated in the 2014 Hong Kong protests which is often dubbed the \\"Umbrella Revolution\\". Wong witnessed use of excessive violence by the police on unarmed citizens during the protests. Wong believes use of force is justified to prevent violence from police. After the protests, he formed Hong Kong Indigenous, a localist group, with other young protesters he met in Mong Kok who shared disappointment at the failure of the protests and disaffection with its leaders. Hong Kong Indigenous continued to organise and participate in other social movements, notably the anti-parallel trading protests in 2015, including the \\"Liberate Sheung Shui\\" on 24 January, \\"Liberate Tuen Mun\\" on 8 February and \\"Liberate Yuen Long\\" on 1 March. He was arrested five times in relation to those protests. Wong states that he is anti-Mainland immigrant and that the influx of mainland immigrants is undermining Hong Kong culture and abusing the Hong Kong welfare system. He has also stated, however, that he would regard an immigrant as a Hongkonger if he is willing to defend Hong Kong, its culture and values. Wong also advocates for Hong Kong's right to self-determination, and is viewed as a separatist by the pro-Beijing camp.  Mong Kok conflict  In the Mong Kok civil unrest on Chinese New Year's Day 2016, Wong took an active role as Hong Kong Indigenous called for actions online to protect street hawkers from law enforcement officials. The protests turned into violent clashes. After the clashes, he posted a recording online saying that he was unsure what will happen to him, and it might be his ‚Äúfinal message‚Äù. He called Hong Kong people to continue protesting and make a difference, and concluded by quoting a Chinese saying: \\"Rather be a shattered vessel of jade than an unbroken piece of pottery.\\" On 11 February, police raided Wong's home in Tseung Kwan O but did not find him there. Subsequently, Wong disappeared from all media contact. He was arrested at a friend's residence in Tin Shui Wai on 22 February and charged the next day with riot and, on 28 June, with incitement to unlawful assembly and incitement to riot. He was charged for instigating riot, joint incitement and inciting others to take part in an unlawful assembly.  Protection in Europe  In November 2017, Wong failed to report to the police and return his travel documents to the court on 22 November after a judge-approved trip to Europe on condition of a HK$100,000 cash bail. The High Court issued an arrest warrant. Wong was granted refugee protection in Germany in May 2018 together with Alan Li Tung-sing at a time when Hong Kong's protection for free speech and assembly and fair trials have diminished. Germany offers refugee protection to those being persecuted because of nationality, religion, political opinion or for belonging to a certain social group. He is the first British national granted asylum in the European Union.

The crew onboard the flight were captains Lloyd D. Reinhard, with Robert Hinman, John B. Coyne, Herbert J. Thing, Jr., and flight instructor Harold Engh, and trainee Howard Loren Sturdy.https://www.alliedpilots.org/GoneWest Accident Flight 1502 departed Idlewild Airport into clear skies at 11:00 a.m. EDT (UTC‚àí4), with Captain Reinhard at the yoke. 57 minutes later, the aircraft made its last radio contact.https://aviation- safety.net/database/record.php?id=19610128-1 At 12:20 p.m. EDT (UTC‚àí4), Airman First Class James F. Ross was in a car on the old Montauk Highway and witnessed Flight 1502 passing overhead at an estimated 100 feet, in a 60-70¬∞ dive. Ross pulled his car to the side of the highway, only for the 707 to disappear behind sand dunes. Also present on the highway was Captain Frank Ward, a local fisherman from Montauk, who said the aircraft did multiple rolls, straightening out before impact, and that an engine was reportedly on fire.https://www.liboatingworld.com/single-post/2017/01/12/In-Our-Waters In a steep, left wing low attitude, Flight 1502 crashed into the shallow waters off of Napeague Beach, killing the six occupants. Emergency crews rushed to the scene to find the aircraft extensively fragmented, with some seats reportedly split in half by the force of the crash.http://www.gendisasters.com/new- york/3590/amagansett%2C-ny-training-jet-liner-crashes%2C-jan-1961 The crash was the fourth involving a modern jetliner in the New York metropolitan area in the past two years, amounting to a total 149 lives lost. This included what as at the time the world's deadliest aviation disaster, the 1960 New York mid- air collision, that only occurred the previous month. Cause When the accident occurred, the crew could have been partaking in an engine shutdown and restart, a canyon approach, or was en-route to engine climb manouveres. Canyon approach procedures require a flap setting of 30 degrees, and the wreckage seemed to corroborate this setting. However, the evidence was inconclusive to find a cause for the loss of control. As such, the FAA officially gave a probable cause as \\"A loss of control for an undetermined reason\\". Additionally, there was consideration that two engines were inoperative at impact, but this could not be concisely proven.https://www.baaa-acro.com/crash/crash-boeing-707-123-montauk- point-6-killed As a result of this speculation, and the crash of another American Airlines 707 on a training flight over Long Island in 1959, the FAA removed the requirement for all 707 flight crews to practice landings with two failed engines on the same wing.

In 1887 the Rangers won the Hardgrave Challenge Cup for the premiership of the Colony of Queensland, defeating the Wanderers club of Brisbane in the deciding match by 5 points to 2. The Ipswich Rangers also played the first touring British rugby team in 1888. But by 1891 the club was not able to regularly field a team and began to forfeit matches. Other rugby sides were then formed in Ipswich, including the Athenian Club, Bells Football Club, Raceview, and the City Football Club. The present Ipswich Rangers Rugby Club was formed in 1968. Ipswich won their first senior trophy in 1974, defeating Surfers Paradise by 38-4 to win the Sunday Truth Shield for the Queensland Sub- districts A-grade competition. In 1979 the club was promoted to the Brisbane Premiership and the A-grade team defeated the reigning premiers University of Queensland by 21-19 at Woodend Park, but that was the team's only win of the season. The Ipswich first team played through the 1987 season undefeated to win the Sub-districts A-grade competition and in the following two seasons went on to claim three titles in a row. In the restyled Queensland Suburban Rugby Union competition, Ipswich Rangers won the Barber Cup in 2005, 2006 and 2010.

He was deputy for Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne from 1898 to 1918. He was Minister of Public Works in 1913 and Minister of Finance in 1917. As Minister of Finance he introduced reforms that made the newly introduced income tax more progressive. Life =Early years= Joseph Marie Philippe Thierry was born on 20 March 1857 in Haguenau, Bas-Rhin. He was the son of the last French mayor of Haguenau before the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. His family was expelled by the Germans and took refuge in Marseille, where Joseph Thierry began to study Law. He went on to the faculties of Law in Aix-en- Provence and Paris. He became an attorney in Marseille specializing in commercial and financial cases. =Deputy= Thierry was elected deputy for Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne representing the 3rd district of Marseille on 22 March 1898 in the first round. He was reelected in the first round in 1902, 1906, 1910 and 1914. In the Chamber he was particularly involved in economic issues. He was vice president of the Customs committee from 1902, and president of this committee from 1910 to 1913. He supported free trade. He was opposed to the bill separating the Church and State. In 1903 Thierry was among a group of right-wing members of the Progressistes who formed the new F√©d√©ration r√©publicaine (FR), a party of the center-right. Other founders included liberal opponents of the second empire and dedicated republicans such as Alexandre Ribot, Jules M√©line, Henri Barboux and √âdouard Aynard. The organization was militantly republican, but socially conservative. From 1906 to 1911 Thierry was president of the FR as successor to the founding president Eug√®ne Motte. Thierry initiated annual party conferences, and managed to increase support for the FR in the provinces. In November 1910 he asked his party to accept the lay laws that Aristide Briand proposed under his \\"appeasement\\" policy. In December 1911 Thierry left the FR. Later he joined the Alliance d√©mocratique (ARD). In 1914 Thierry joined the centrist Gauche d√©mocratique parliamentary group. The M√©line tariff of 11 January 1892, named after its author Jules M√©line, was a protectionist tariff that aimed to ensure that French colonies sold to France and bought from France rather than trading with other countries. It drew mounting criticism from colonial businessmen who thought it retarded economic growth. As rapporteur for the standing parliamentary commission on customs, in 1910 Thierry represented the views of the reformist F√©d√©ration Intercolonial to an inter-ministry committee that had been set up \\"to fix the basis for the establishment of a colonial customs regime more favorable to the economic development of our colonies.\\" The committee submitted its report on 23 February 1910. The reformists had been ignored and the protectionist M√©line tariff was reconfirmed. =Cabinet positions= Thierry was Minister of Public Works from 22 March 1913 to 2 December 1913 in the cabinet of Louis Barthou. As a Progressist he was attacked by the Radicals, who considered that he was a reactionary. In 1913 Thierry introduced a bill, which was passed, to allow airships to fly over private property. The landowner could no longer claim rights to the airspace, but could claim for any damages caused to the airship. Thierry said the purpose was \\"while protecting the public, not to injure in any way a new national industry.\\" During World War I (1914‚Äì18) Aristide Briand appointed him Under-secretary of State for War responsible for military supplies from 1 July 1915 to 12 December 1916. On 7 May 1916 Thierry assisted Marcel Sembat, Minister of Public Works, in inaugurating the Rove Tunnel and the first two cranes of Port-de-Bouc. The tunnel was the most challenging section of the Canal de Marseille au Rh√¥ne, which would connect Marseille to the Rh√¥ne river. After many delays, the canal was finally opened to traffic in April 1927. Thierry was Minister of Finance from 20 March 1917 to 7 September 1917 under Alexandre Ribot. Thierry was described as \\"the rare Third Republic politician who was qualified to deal with financial and commercial questions.\\" He was Minister of Finance at a time when the offensive of General Robert Nivelle had failed and the war seemed to be in a stalemate. He continued the policies of his predecessor Alexandre Ribot, who had been promoted to president of the council. Thierry strengthened controls of foods, particularly wheat and sugar, made insurance against marine war risks compulsory, increased the salaries of civil servants due to the high cost of living, and prepared for the introduction of exchange controls. Thierry accompanied √âtienne Cl√©mentel, Minister of Commerce, to the London Conference, where France negotiated an easing of prohibitions on foreign trade in the agreement of 6 July 1917. Thierry was named in the law of 31 July 1917, which continued the fiscal reform that was caused by the introduction of income tax. He prepared a budget for \\"ordinary\\" non-war government spending. The top marginal income tax rate was to increase from 10% to 12.5% and then to 20%. In addition, he introduced taxes on income from business (4.5%), agriculture (3.75%), employment (3.75%), professional fees (3.75%) and revenue from capital (4%). He also proposed a basic sales tax of 0.1% on all transactions, both wholesale and retail. In addition, there would be retail taxes of 5% on non-essential goods and 10% on luxury goods. By decree of 6 September 1917 Thierry created a supervisory committee for colonial banks. =Later career= Rue Joseph Thierry in his birthplace, Haguenau After leaving the government Thierry was appointed temporary Ambassador to Spain in place of L√©on Geoffray, where he convinced the Spanish government to take a position of benevolent neutrality. Joseph Thierry died of a heart attack on 22 September 1918 in San Sebasti√°n, Spain. His son, Adrien-Joseph Thierry (born 4 January 1884), was a lawyer who married Nadine de Rothschild, daughter of baron Henri de Rothschild. Adrien-Joseph Thierry became first secretary of the French embassy in London.

It is known from one of England's earliest cookery books, The Forme of Cury (1390), and other manuscripts. Dish Mortis is probably named for the mortar and pestle used in its preparation. A Tudor mortis recipe for chicken is given in The Good Huswifes Jewell, an English cookery book of 1585 by Thomas Dawson. He instructs: The dish consists of meat, such as chicken or fish, boiled and pounded with blanched almonds and milk into a smooth paste. This is then cooked gently with sugar. (Modern version of Dawson's recipe) An earlier recipe for \\"mortrose of fyshe\\" (fish mortis) is given in the 1390 cookery book, The Forme of Cury, written for King Richard's cooks. It called for houndfish, haddock, or cod, using the liver as well as the flesh, mixed with milk, white breadcrumbs and sugar. A similar recipe appeared in Gentyll Manly Cokere in the Pepys Manuscript 1047, dating from around 1490. The Beinecke manuscript describes a saffron-yellow \\"mortruys\\" of mixed chicken and pork, thickened with egg: The name of the dish most likely derives from the mortar and pestle used to prepare it. Terry Breverton, in The Tudor Kitchen: What the Tudors Ate & Drank (2015), suggests putting the mortis into individual ramekins and chilling them before serving.

Orfi () was an award-winning illusionist and director from Bulgaria. Biography Vasil Nikolaev was born in Silistra, in northeastern Bulgaria, on 1 June 1943. In 1947 he moved to the other side of the country when his father Stefan Nikolaev took a job as a director of musical theatre in the capital Sofia. A frequent visitor to the family home there was illusionist Mister Senko and young Vasil became fascinated by illusions. In 1959, at the age of 16, Vasil passed an audition to be allowed to become a professional performer. He began doing magic under the stage name Orfi, derived from the Bulgarian name for Orpheus, from Greek mythology. In early 1962 Orfi decided he needed an assistant and recruited an acquaintance named Luybka, who had stage experience because her parents had encouraged her to perform in drama productions and poetry readings from an early age. She was due to go to a job as a secretary in September that year but agreed to join Orfi for a tour of Bulgaria in the interim. The two became lovers and, so that they could stay together, when the time came for Lybuka to go they told her parents they were engaged. Their plans were interrupted when Lyubka became seriously ill with hepatitis. While she was in hospital they became engaged properly. The two went into the army together and performed as a duo in the army's entertainment corps. They were married in 1963 and continued as partners on and off stage for 36 years until Orfi's death. Orfi and Lyubka established themselves as a well known act within Bulgaria but despite this they could not afford to buy expensive props from abroad as some of their fellow magicians had done. This forced Orfi to rely on his ingenuity to devise ways of achieving similar effects using his own methods and props that he could build himself. In 1976 the duo won the \\"grand prix\\" at the first national festival of magicians in Bulgaria. As their success and reputation grew they were able to tour to countries including the USA, the USSR, Italy, Spain, Morocco, Switzerland and Algeria. In 1982 they won a silver medal in the stage illusion category of the International Federation of Magic Societies (FISM) championships, held that year in Lausanne, Switzerland. Orfi became a prominent figure in Bulgaria's professional magic community and a director of various shows and events. Together with his close friend and fellow magician Astor he was founder of a Bulgarian magic society and organiser of national magic festivals. In 1986 Orfi was appointed general director of the Bulgarian national circus. Orfi died suddenly of a stroke in Sofia on 20 November 1999 at the age of 56. He had suffered from diabetes but his widow said there were no prior signs that he was seriously ill. Family Orfi was the younger brother of actor Nikolay Nikolaev.

Lynch and Keith Lynch, starring Dave Bautista (who previously worked with Mann in Heist), Ray Stevenson and Pierce Brosnan. Plot Brothers Dimitri and Arkady Belav have led the revolution in the Russian state of Sakovya for independence. The revolution ultimately leads to Dimitri being killed in an airstrike and Arkady being captured, ending the revolution. After several years, Arkady and his men believe that Dimitri has faked his death, so they torture a man for information on where Dimitri is hiding in London. Meanwhile, in London, former US military soldier Michael Knox visits his late best friend's house to attend a football (soccer) game with his niece, Danni. He had previously served in Afghanistan in an attack team alongside his best friend (who he explains \\"was like a brother\\") and was the only survivor of their last mission. Danni is grounded by her mother for delinquent behavior, but Knox manages to fix the situation, and her mother gives her consent for Michael to take Danni to the football match. Arriving at the West Ham stadium, Danni expresses her frustration about her dad's death. Michael goes to get them both hot dogs, at which point Danni gets a text from a boy she fancies and decides to join him at his seat. Meanwhile, Arkady and his mercenaries covertly infiltrate the stadium, take over the control room and initiate a lockdown of the entire stadium. Taking Superintendent Steve Thompson hostage, Arkady threatens Thompson into cooperating with his team by threatening his family. Arkady then has his men blow up all transmission towers across the city to ensure that no communication will be made outside the stadium. Discovering Danni is missing from her seat, Knox seeks help with the cheeky stadium guard Faisal Khan, an Iraqi immigrant. Faisal reluctantly assists Knox to the control room. On their way, they both run into one of Arkady's men posing as a guard near the elevator, who ultimately attacks them, resulting in Michael killing him. Knox finds C-4 explosives in Andrei's jacket. He then uses the only working walkie-talkie to call the police about the situation, but Chief Commander Daniel Steed does not believe him and hangs up. After he kills two other men, Vlad and Anton, Knox brings the latter's body to a balcony and throws him down, smashing into concession stands and thereby summoning the police. Seeing this, Arkady and the other mercenaries infiltrate the news studio and kill the crew. Arkady has a reporter read a statement at gunpoint, demanding Dimitri's location, or they will blow up the stadium. As he finishes the statement, Arkady kills the reporter and two others on live television, which Danni's mom sees and prompts her to leave for the stadium. Steed is approached by Agent Cho, who explains that Dimitri fled Russia undercover, underwent plastic surgery, and was given amnesty in London. Cho says that cannot meet the demands as handing Dimitri to Arkady will plunge the entire Russian region into chaos, endangering millions. Arkady's team learns the background of Knox and Danni, and they decide to take Danni hostage. Hearing them summoning Danni over the speaker, Knox rescues her with help from Faisel. Because Thompson's team failed to capture Danni, Arkady executes him. Knox, Faisal, and Danni ultimately discover the C4 explosives planted below the control room, and Knox alerts Steed about it. Hoping to stop the situation, Knox decides to take Dimitri by himself. On his way, Knox encounters and fights Tatiana, ultimately escaping and finding Dimitri and agreeing with agents now circling in a helicopter to bring Dimitri to be safely taken away, but he stipulates Danni must go with them. But Tatiana takes Danni hostage and knocks Faisal unconscious. Knox eliminates the other men before they get to the extraction point, but upon learning Danni is taken, Cho ‚Äì who is under orders to ensure Dimitri stays dead ‚Äì has his men shoot at Knox; however, the mercenaries fend off the helicopter. After they threaten Danni, Knox agrees to hand over Dimitri in exchange for her. Steed berates Cho for risking the lives of innocent people and takes control of the situation. A helicopter comes back and kills most of the other mercenaries, but Dimitri and Danni are captured. After Knox struggles with Tatiana, they both fall from a higher point in the stadium and she is fatally impaled by a pipe. Knox had managed to get and keep hold of the kill switch, but realizes it is fake; before dying, Tatiana explains that the bomb will blow up 90 minutes into the match no matter what. When Dimitri reunites with Arkady, Arkady vows to start the revolution again if Dimitri proves his loyalty by shooting Danni. But unwilling to let Arkady's madness destroy the region with another revolution, Dimitri shoots himself. With just a few minutes left, Faisal is able to being evacuating the audience from the stadium in the area near the control room. Arkady takes control of the live broadcast holding onto Danni as Knox runs towards the control room from across the field, but he's too late and the bomb goes off, destroying the control room. But as he starts to mourn, Knox looks more closely at the frozen big screen which was not destroyed and notices a time difference in two clocks, realizing that the live broadcast was pre- recorded 85 minutes into the match, and that both of them are probably alive. As the crowd stampedes towards exits, Knox hears Danni crying out and confronts Arkady. With a gun to her head, Knox tells Danni to \\"use her head\\" - she gets the hint and head butts Arkady, sending him briefly reeling and Knox kills him. Danni reunites with her worried mother who runs to her arms, and Steed thanks Knox for his bravery. Knox, Danni, her mother, and Faisel (who was near the blast but managed to survive as he rescued an older woman who he had argued with earlier) leave the stadium.

The poem addresses the ordinary British soldier of Kipling's time in a sympathetic manner. It is written from the point of view of such a soldier, and contrasts the treatment they receive from the general public during peace and during war. Background The Tommy of the poem is Tommy Atkins, a generic slang name for a common British soldier. A term of uncertain origin, the name \\"Thomas Atkins\\" was used in nineteenth century War Office manuals as a placeholder name to demonstrate how forms should be filled out. In popular use, \\"Thomas\\" became the more familiar \\"Tommy\\".(In t T the second volume of her biography of The 1st Duke of Wellington (Wellington the Years of the Sword and its sequel) Elizabeth Longford suggests that the Duke was sent a draft paybook to approve and the Duke crossed out the original placeholder name and substituted the name of Thomas Atkins, a private in the 33rd Foot and gives some details of the man's sevIce. She asserts that the original paybook was still in existence when she wrote the books in the 1970's) The poem The poem is written in a colloquial style of English, and comprises five verses of eight lines each. The second half of each verse begins with a variation of the refrain \\"it's Tommy this, an' Tommy that\\". The narrator is a British soldier named Tommy Atkins. In the poem, the soldier talks about the respectful way he is treated by others when he is needed to fight a war and presents it as a bitter contrast against the poor treatment he receives when he is not. For example, he laments being refused service by a pub owner for being a \\"redcoat\\". Tommy rejects both sides of this duality, saying that he and his fellow soldiers are neither \\"thin red 'eroes\\" nor \\"blackguards\\", but just ordinary men. The poem ends with a suggestion of change. The soldier calls for those who talk of improving things for soldiers to take action, and reminds the reader that \\"Tommy\\" is well aware of the way he is treated. T. S. Eliot included the poem in his 1941 collection A Choice of Kipling's Verse.

At the January 1910 general election, he stood for the SDF in Carlisle. Although he visited on several occasions, his campaign was hampered as he was unable to take much time off work to visit the seat, so William Gallacher deputised for him.William Gallacher, The Last Memoirs, p.51 He took 11.3% of the vote and was not elected.Martin Crick, The History of the Social Democratic Federation, p.330 The SDF became the British Socialist Party (BSP), and it locally affiliated to the Labour Party.Sam Davies, County Borough Elections in England and Wales, 1919-1938, p.76 Under this label, in 1913, Bannington was elected to Coventry City Council, defeating a long- standing Liberal Party councillor.F.

This adopted Bannington as its candidate for Coventry at the 1918 general election, and his campaign focused on attacking the official Labour Party candidate, R. C. Wallhead. Wallhead was a member of the Independent Labour Party who had opposed the war, but he was able to remind crowds of anti-militarist statements made by Bannington before the war. Ultimately, both candidates were defeated by Edward Manville, a Coalition Conservative politician; Bannington took 3,806 votes and fourth place in poll, behind Wallhead.

Two people ‚Äì a Con Ed worker and a 3rd floor resident ‚Äì died instantly, and 24 were injured; a third person, another Con Ed worker, died the following day. Two hundred people were displaced for months while cleanup crews worked to remove asbestos containing mud from building facades. All apartments were remediated by certified asbestos workers and tested for asbestos in air. Workers from Con Ed, the major utility company at the time, were repairing a high pressure steam pipe in front of the building when a connecting sleeve burst, releasing hot steam and debris upwards. Laboratory testing afterwards determined that the insulating material contained asbestos, which subsequently led to a large-scale evacuation and cleanup. The release from the explosion, in front of 32 Gramercy Park at the corner of 20th Street and Third Avenue, continued for several hours with debris reaching 18 stories. The pipe was covered with asbestos magnesia block insulation which was pulverized and dispersed with the rising steam cloud. Con Ed originally failed to report the debris contained asbestos but after 4 days, announced the 200 pounds of insulation did contain the cancer causing material, asbestos. Five years later, during a trial on the same issue, the company pleaded guilty to a conspiracy and environmental law violations in Federal District Court in Manhattan for withholding that information. The final remediation and cleanup cost totaled approximately $90 million, making this one of the most expensive asbestos cleanup projects in history.

It initially sailed from Galway, Ireland to St John's, Newfoundland, and thereafter sailed on to Boston, Massachusetts. But the ship foundered in October 1860 in a storm off approximately from Boston. Although all of the lifeboats were smashed in the storm, all of the passengers and crew aboard were saved by the heroic actions of a fruit transport ship, the Minni Schiffer, and her Captain, John Wilson. The wreck was rediscovered in 2014 by The Endurance Exploration Group, Inc. Endurance Exploration was appointed custodian of the wreck by the courts, a precursor to a potential salvage claim. The wreck is believed to contain approximately 10,000 gold sovereigns amongst other cargo. The potential value of the cargo is said to be in the millions of dollars. History The Connaught was originally built by the Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company in Newcastle upon Tyne as a passenger ship for the Atlantic Royal Mail Steam Navigation Company, Ltd. It had an iron hull, a single steam engine which drove two side- paddle wheels. It has been described as the Titanic of its day, a reference both to its early sinking, but also to its relative size and opulence compared against other passenger ships at the time it was launched. The Connaught's first trip was from Galway, Ireland to Boston, Massachusetts via St. John's, Newfoundland. The ship departed on 25 September 1860 with 50 first-class passengers, 417 steerage passengers, and a crew of 125. The ship successfully crossed the Atlantic Ocean to St. John's, and then departed to travel onward to Boston. Sinking In the early days of October 1860, approximately from Boston a storm hit. Side paddle wheels are not an optimum structure for vessels in stormy seas, and the ship sprung a leak. The leak was brought under control, but due to the extra stress on the coal-fired steam a fire had by then started below deck. On October 7, 1860, the smoke and flames forced passengers and crew up on to the top deck in the storm. The lifeboats were lowered, but the waves smashed them against the ship's iron hull. According to eyewitness accounts, the hulls of the Connaught became so hot that they boiled the waves as they crashed over her. A small fruit merchant ship, the Minni Schiffer, sailed to intercept. The women and children were evacuated first, followed by the male passengers and crew. Reports indicate that so many people boarded the tiny transport that they stood on every available patch of deck, and that some even clinging to the tall masts and rigging. Lastly, the captain of the Connaught joined them. After all hands had abandoned ship, the Connaught swiftly broke up and sank. 591 passengers and crew were transferred from one of the largest passenger ships of the day to a tiny merchant vessel, during a storm, without a single loss of life. The Minni Schiffer then arrived at Boston's India Wharf on the following day. Rediscovery In 2012 the Endurance Exploration Group Inc, a company specialising in shipwreck research, survey and recovery, identified the SS Connaught as one of about 20 shipwrecks that it prioritised to locate. In 2013, after an exhaustive side sonar scan search it identified what it believed to be the wreck of the Connaught in the waters off Boston, noting the highly distinctive side paddles. Subsequent dives with a remote operated vehicle in 2014 were able to retrieve artifacts from the wreck site which positively identified the vessel as an Atlantic Royal Mail Steam Navigation Company ship. Based upon the evidence available, the company were able to obtain an order from U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, Tampa Division for the arrest of the shipwreck Connaught, and for the court to take jurisdiction over the wreck. The U.S. Marshal's arrested the hull fragments collected by Endurance Exploration, and Endurance Exploration was appointed by the Court as substitute custodian of the recovered hull fragment artifacts and any future artifacts recovered from the Connaught. The court ordered was made in anticipation of a future salvage claim in the event that valuable cargo is recovered. The precise coordinates of the wreck site have not been made publicly available, but it has been stated in various sources that the wreckage is believed to lie in international waters.

The summit is easily climbed on path no. 153. The first documented ascent was undertaken in 1829 by Innsbruck botanist, Andr√§ Sauter, a brother of Anton Sauter.Ludwig Purtscheller in Eduard Richter: Die Erschlie√üung der Ostalpen, II. Band, Berlin, 1894, p. 475 As a result of its easy accessibility on well marked paths from Telfs in the Inn Valley and from the Sellrain Valley, it is a popular destination. Its name is derived from the village of Rietz at its northern foot in the district of Imst in the upper Inn valley.  Location and surrounding area  The Rietzer Grie√ükogel lies just under eight kilometres as the crow flies south of Telfs, 27 kilometres west of Innsbruck and five kilometres northwest of St. Sigmund im Sellrain. Its neighbouring summits are the Bachwandkopf (2,758 m) to the west, the Hocheder (2,798 m) to the northeast and the Schartenkogel (2,603 m) to the southeast. To the southwest the Rietzer Grie√ükogel drops into the Alpine pasture of Oberer Zirmbachalm (2,100 m) with gradients of 30 to 50¬∞.  Geology  Geologically viewed, the Northern Sellrain Mountains belong to the √ñtztal Gneiss, which forms the rocks here. Particularly strong elements of this rock are biotite-granite gneiss,Raimund von Klebelsberg: Geologie von Tirol, Berlin 1935, p. 150 a mixed crystal from the Annite-Phlogopite series. Because this rock is easily weathered and eroded, for example by frost weathering, the mountains in this region are less rugged and easier from climb from an alpinistic perspective.  Bases and routes  The Rietzer Grie√ükogel may be reached from the north from the Peter Anich Hut (1,909 m), which lies above Telfs to the south. Path no. 153 runs in a southerly direction initially over the Bachwandkopf peak, then along the west ar√™te to the summit in, according to the literature, 3¬Ω hours. From the south it takes about 4¬Ω hours on the path from K√ºhtai or Haggen in the Sellrain valley along the Zirmbach stream and up the southwestern flank of the mountain. This ascent is also one of the most popular ski tours of the region. Another path runs from Flaurling via the Flaurlinger Alm from the east to the top.Walter Klier: Alpenvereinsf√ºhrer Stubaier Alpen, Munich, 2006, p. 167, Rz 1221 ff.

The researchers concluded that the crack is the first recorded example of such a popup without an obvious trigger. A description and analysis of the event is published in Seismological Research Letters.Richardson, J. P., Pennington, W. D., Waite, G. P., Galambus, M., Lanza, F., & Bowman, L. (2016).

It is 68 kilometers north of Beirut. Aqoura has an average elevation of 1,600 meters above sea level and a total land area of around 140 square kilometers . Aqoura's inhabitants are Maronite Catholics. By area, Aaqoura is the largest village belonging to its citizens (not emirate lands) in Lebanon. By voting, it is the third largest town in the Byblos District, along with the district capital Byblos and Qartaba. Maronites emerged from Aaqoura in the fourth century when Saint Maroun's disciple Ibrahim El Korchy started preaching and converting pagans to the Christian faith in the Aaqoura area. The carved stone Saint Peter and Paul church in Aaqoura is by far the oldest existing church in Lebanon and one of the oldest in the world. It was converted in the 4th century from a tomb place to the priests of the temple of Ashtarout in Afqa to a church. The village of Aaqoura is known by the famous mountain chains surrounding and protecting it. These mountains have offered refuge for the citizens of Aaqoura during the different wars in Lebanon and the region. Also known for their courage, hospitality, and their intelligence the people of Aaqoura are studying and working worldwide. The local citizens work, value and guard their lands. They cherish and proclaim their Christianity and play a major role in Lebanon through their political influence and their international relations.

Beginning in the Cascade Range, the creek flows generally west through the Willamette National Forest to enter the Middle Fork upstream of Jasper, southeast of Springfield and Eugene. The map includes mile markers along the creek to the point. The remainder is an estimate based on map scale and ruler. Along its upper and middle reaches, the creek flows by many campgrounds, picnic sites, a state park, and the Fall Creek National National Recreation Trail. Fall Creek Reservoir is a man-made reservoir where the stream is impounded by Fall Creek Dam. Below the dam, the small communities of Unity and Fall Creek lie along the lower reaches. Two covered bridges carry rural roads over the creek, one at Unity and the other further downstream. Tributaries Named tributaries of Fall Creek from source to mouth are Buzzard, Briem, Saturn, Delp, and Ninemile creeks. Then come Gold, Pacific, Tiller, Marine, Hehe, Small, and Gibraltar creeks. Further downstream are Alder, Puma, Jones, Portland, and Andy creeks. Then come Bedrock, Slick, Timber, Boundary, and Little Gold Creek. North Fork Fall Creek is next, after which Winberry Creek enters at Fall Creek Lake. Little Fall Creek enters the main stem in the lower reaches below the lake. Covered bridges Unity Bridge at Unity carries Unity‚ÄìLowell Road over Fall Creek. The bridge is about below Fall Creek Reservoir and about by water from the mouth of the creek. Unity Bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Further downstream, Pengra Bridge carries Place Road over the creek along its lower reaches. The Howe truss structure, built in 1938, was also added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Recreation =Hiking and camping= Fall Creek National Recreation Trail runs along the creek between the Dolly Varden Campground and a trailhead near Tiller Creek. Access to the generally level hiking trail is via five trailheads at different points along the route. Log footbridges span the side streams of the trail, which connects to other trails, among them Clark Butte, Cowhorn Mountain, Gold Point, and Jones. Campgrounds are found at intervals along the Fall Creek National Recreation Trail and Forest Road 18. These include Dolly Varden, Big Pool, Broken Bowl, Bedrock, and Puma. Clark Creek Organization Camp, built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s, has sites for group camping. =State park= Fall Creek State Recreation Site, a state park at Fall Creek Reservoir, has a variety of campgrounds and day-use areas, each with amenities that vary from site to site. These include boat launches, swimming areas, picnic areas, toilets, and parking. The park is open from May through September. =Fishing= Fishing in Oregon describes the creek as \\"beautiful\\" as well as popular with anglers in pursuit of fin-clipped Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), stocked rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), and wild cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii). Fin-clipped Chinook salmon are hatchery fish which were stocked through 2001. Currently, their descendants and wild salmon are trapped and hauled up over the dam. Outgoing salmon were historically challenged by predation by piscivorous non-native fish such as largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) and crappie (Pomoxis spp.) and difficulty navigating out over the dam. A novel study published in 2019 found that by simple, low-cost draining the reservoir to streambed for a short period each year for a number of years, salmon could more easily outmigrate and non-native warmwater fish were flushed out into coldwster, riverine conditions where they could not survive. This strategy has resulted in improved outmigration of salmon and led to the gradual disappearance of two species of predatory invasive fish (largemouth bass and crappie) in the artificial reservoir. Above Fall Creek Lake, the creek is heavily stocked with rainbow trout as far upstream as Gold Creek. Salmon, steelhead (sea-going rainbow trout), and salmon also frequent the creek downstream of the dam impounding the lake. The lake previously supported populations of non-native largemouth bass, crappie, bluegills, and a few trout.

By 1898 it had moved to the corner of 44th Street and Fifth Avenue, before moving to the Hotel New Netherland on the corner of 59th Street in 1919. History Around 1880, with $1,300 saved from his time at the Hotel Elberon, Sherry launched his first restaurant in New York City at 38th Street and Sixth Avenue. The new establishment struggled a bit at first, but Sherry's knack for \\"dainty decorations\\" and the \\"novelties of service\\" won a following from \\"The Four Hundred\\" (late 19th century term for New York City's social elite, coined by Ward McAllister). In a short time, Sherry upgraded to a larger (and more prestigious) location at 37th Street and Fifth Avenue in 1890. But even that location proved too small, and again the business upgraded to a building owned by Isaac Vail Brokaw at 44th Street and Fifth Avenue in 1898.\\"Louis Sherry Dies; Famous Caterer...\\", The New York Times, June 10, 1926, Page 25 The restaurant was the site for a dinner on horseback held by wealthy industrialist Cornelius Kingsley Garrison Billings, who had recently opened a private trotting stable at what is Fort Tryon Park today. Billings intended to have the dinner at the stables, but changed his mind and rented the main ballroom at Louis Sherry's instead. On March 28, 1903, the horses were brought to the fourth floor of the Sherry building by freight elevator into a room fitted with a canvas backdrop to simulate an English country scene. Billings invited 36 guests to dine with him on horseback. Trays for the food were attached to the riding saddles and champagne was able to be sipped from a bottle in one's saddlebag via rubber tubing. The horses were not Billings' own, but had been rented from local riding academies for the dinner; they were fed with troughs. In 1919 it moved to Hotel New Netherland, on the corner of 59th Street.

Early life  Pedro de Jes√∫s Maldonado was born in a neighborhood of Chihuahua City known as San Nicol√°s and was one of seven children of Apolinar Maldonado and Micaela Lucero. When he was 17 years old, he entered the diocesan seminary, where he was known for his piety; once, after completing the Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola, he told the rector of the seminary \\"I have thought of always having my heart in heaven and in the Tabernacle.\\"Martinez, Felix. Astoria Del Seminarian DE Chihuahua, Ed. Casino, Chihuahua, 1986, p. 50. In 1913 and 1914, many seminarians fled to El Paso, Texas, because of religious persecution in Mexico, but Maldonado remained in Chihuahua and studied music. Later, he continued his religious studies and was ordained as a priest on January 25, 1918. His ordination took place in the Cathedral of St. Patrick, in the Diocese of El Paso, because the Bishop of Chihuahua was sick in Mexico City.  Priesthood  203x203px Although Maldonado celebrated his first Masses in El Paso, his first Solemn Mass was in the Church of the Holy Family in Chihuahua on February 11, 1918 (the feast day of Santa Isabel). Maldonado worked with the Tarahumara Natives and sought to reduce the amount of alcohol they consumed. He helped the poor with money and clothing, and raised and educated a poor orphan. Maldonado took a special interest in the religious education of both children and adults, explaining Catholic doctrine by using photographs. At harvest time, farmers would ask him to bless fields invaded by locusts, and there are accounts that claim his prayers expelled the locusts more than once. During the Cristero War (1926‚Äì29), Maldonado and other priests in Chihuahua were the targets of anti- Catholic violence. Revolutionaries changed Santa Isabel's name to General Trias as part of an effort to erase references to Catholicism from the geography of the state. Maldonado was beaten several times ‚Äì even inside his church ‚Äì by Freemasons, but he continued to carry out his ministry in Santa Isabel until his death.  Death  Corpse of Father Maldonado On February 10, 1937 (Ash Wednesday), Maldonado was arrested. Government officials brought him barefoot to the town hall, where they beat him, fracturing his skull and causing his left eye to pop out. He had brought with him a pyx containing the Eucharist, and his attackers took the hosts, put them in his mouth and ordered him to eat them, not realizing they were fulfilling the priest's last wish. When the men saw the seriousness of Maldonado's condition, they allowed him to be taken to Chihuahua City, where he died on February 11, 1937 (the 19th anniversary of his first Solemn Mass), from severe brain trauma and injuries throughout his body caused by the beating. According to his death certificate, Maldonado died at 5:15 pm, at the age of 44. In official documents, his death was deemed a murder. To many parishioners in Chihuahua, as well as to his fellow priests and his diocesan bishop, , he was a martyr because he had been killed because of his faithfulness in carrying out his ministry and because of hatred toward his faith. His tombstone reads, \\"You are a priest.\\" After his death, Maldonado's tomb became a place of prayer, surrounded by candles, flowers, and votive offerings. Tomb of Father Maldonado in the Cemetery of Dolores in Chihuahua Maldonado's death had effects both in and beyond Chihuahua. It occurred during the last part of President L√°zaro C√°rdenas's term, and provoked skepticism of C√°rdenas's efforts to bring peace to Mexico.  Canonization  Some years later, Gu√≠zar, convinced that Maldonado would eventually be canonized, asked Monsignor Mart√≠n L. Qui√±ones to gather all the material he could about Maldonado's life and martyrdom. In 1975, Adalberto Almeida y Merino, the Archbishop of Chihuahua, officially named Msgr. Qui√±ones the promoter of the cause of canonization for Maldonado. For several years, Qui√±ones worked with the Episcopal Commission for the Introduction of the Beatification Processes of the Mexican Martyrs, since Maldonado's cause had been joined to those of the other priests and laypeople martyred during the same period of persecution. Since these causes had been delayed because some of the processes were slower than others, on October 12, 1984, the Congregation for the Causes of the Saints exhorted the Archdiocese of Chihuahua to speed up Fr. (Father) Maldonado's process, formally initiating the cause of canonization. On November 22, 1992, Fr. Maldonado was beatified by Pope John Paul II. On May 25, 2000, John Paul canonized him.  Relics  The relics of Pedro de Jes√∫s Maldonado are found in a wooden urn in the Chapel of the Lord of Mapim√≠ in the Cathedral of Chihuahua. There is a traveling urn that contains some of his bodily remains, and this reliquary visits the parishes throughout the diocese. In the parish of Santa Isabel is kept the confessional used by the saint. The Fraternity of St. Pius X venerates in the Chapel of San Jos√© in Chihuahua the cloth with blood that covered Maldonado's body in the hospital. During the beatification ceremony, John Paul II kissed the relic of the Chihuahuan martyr. In 2018 on the 100th anniversary of his ordination a relic was presented to the El Paso Diocese from the Diocese of Chihuahua. The wooden urn holding the relic was placed at Saint Patrick Cathedral in El Paso, Texas. image:Reliquias de San Pedro de Jes√∫s Maldonado.jpgRelics of Peter of Jesus Maldonado in the Cathedral of Chihuahua. image:Sangre de San Pedro de Jes√∫s Maldonado.jpgCloth with Maldonado's blood kept by the Fraternity of St. Pius X in Chihuahua.

The NYNJERC was established in 1978. The New York-New Jersey Education and Research Center (NYNJERC) is the hub of education and research in Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) in Federal Region 2, comprising the States of New York and New Jersey, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the U. S. Virgin Islands. The mission of the NYNJERC is to assure safe and healthful working conditions for working men and women by preparing the next generation of professional leaders in OSH through training programs that equip graduates with the knowledge, skills, and attitudes that they will need to understand, evaluate, prevent, manage, and treat occupational disease and injury in the workers of its region and across the United States. History The NYNJERC was founded by Irving J. Selikoff, MD, a renowned pulmonary physician and pioneer in Occupational and Environmental Medicine (OEM) who made seminal discoveries pertaining to the human carcinogenicity of asbestos and was centrally involved in creation of both the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). The program has received support from NIOSH since 1978. Under a series of leaders in academic occupational medicine, the program has built research and educational programs and has trained two generations of OSH professionals, many of whom now occupy senior leadership positions and populate the OSH workforce in Federal Region 2 and across the US. Institutions The NYNJERC is a consortium of five educational institutions in two states, and its nine programs in OSH training cover three of the four essential core academic areas of OSH. The programs are: * Industrial Hygiene (IH) at CUNY School of Public Health, [New York City (NYC), NY]; * Occupational Medicine (OM) at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (NYC, NY); * Occupational Medicine at Rutgers School of Public Health (Piscataway, NJ); ‚Ä¢ Occupational and Environmental Health Nursing (OEHN) at New York University (NYC, NY); * Occupational Safety & Health Engineering at New Jersey Institute of Technology (Newark, NJ); * Occupational Ergonomics and Biomechanics at New York University (NYC, NY); * Continuing Education (CE), Outreach and Interdisciplinary Training at Rutgers School of Public Health (Piscataway, NJ); and the * Pilot Project Research Training Program at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (NYC, NY).  Interdisciplinary Activities  The NY/NJ ERC conducts an annual Historical Perspectives on Occupational Safety and Health Tour. The tour provides trainees the opportunity to see how work impacts health, by visiting work locations around the country that have high injury rates. The tour provides the opportunity for students to understand the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration to address occupational safety and health issues. Rock of Ages Granite Quarry Barre VT Some of the sites visited include: * LAB Chrysotile Thetford Mines, Quebec * Waterfront Fishing Safety Portland, Maine * Rock of Ages Granite Quarry, Barre, VT * Materion Beryllium, Elmore, OH Lackawanna Coal Mine Scranton PA * Ford River Rouge Assembly Plant, Dearborn, MI * GM Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly Lobster boats Portland ME * Love Canal * Sappi Paper * Lackawanna Coal Mine, Scranton, Pennsylvania * Rivers of Steel Homestead Steel, Pittsburgh, PA * Boott Cotton Mills Museum, Lowell, Massachusetts * Noblehurst Farms, Linwood, New York * Indian Ladder Farm, Altamont, New York * Wightman Specialty Woods, Portlandville, NY * NIOSH Personal Protective Technology Laboratory, Pittsburgh, PA The NY/NJERC also provides interdisciplinary educational opportunities through the OSH research methods course, student research day, and the site visits course. The site visits course brings trainees to industries in New York City and New Jersey, including hospitals, set design studios, concrete/glass counter top manufacturers, power generating stations, wastewater treatment facility, and landfill operations. Trainees learn key concepts of industrial hygiene and safety, including hazard recognition and control methods. Each year faculty and trainees post information about the Historical Perspectives Tour on its blog, http://nynjerc.blogspot.com.  Annual Scientific Meetings  The NYNJERC has presented an Annual Scientific Meeting since 1979. The first Annual Scientific Meeting was September 27‚Äì28, 1979 in Hasbrouck Heights, NJ. The Scientific Meeting discussed cancer of the bladder, asbestos hazards in schools, and the hazards of lead, mercury, and chemical waste disposal (Love Canal). Over the years, the NYNJERC has presented important occupational safety and health information on topics ranging from nanotechnology to globalization. The 37th Annual Scientific Meeting discusses safety and health hazards of healthcare workers. The 37th Annual Scientific Meeting was held on April 1, 2016 at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. The topic was Occupational Safety and Health for Healthcare Workers. The keynote addresses were provided by John Howard, Director of NIOSH and David Michaels, Assistant Secretary of Labor for the OSHA. The presentations are available on the NYNJERC website. Two presentations from our 30th Annual Scientific Meeting (April 2009) are available on YouTube. Dr. Stephen Levin presented the Historical Aspect of Asbestos, including asbestos related research at Mount Sinai, a review of Dr. Irving Selloff coming to Mount Sinai, and the work he and others accomplished. Dr. Jack Caravanos presented the Historical Aspects of Lead, providing the health impacts of lead on workers and other populations.

It is 70 kilometers north of Beirut. Hjoula has an elevation of between 920 and 1,100 meters above sea level. Hjoula has a total land area of 528 hectares. The village of Hjoula is known for its fertile soil and its woods, as well as Early Cretaceous fossils. Etymology The word is an Aramaic one, however the meaning is uncertain. Most historians and linguists suggest it means \\"Oval\\" due to its oval shape, while some others speculate it comes from the Syriac root \\"G-l-a\\" and subsequently to the word \\"Guola\\" which supposedly means \\"The place of the wandering salesman\\". History Many old relics and monuments were found in Hjoula. There was found a Phoenician inscription in \\"Jarabta\\". A Roman statue that represented a shepherd and his sheep was also found beside the lake, and was dated to the era of emperor Tiberius c. 20 CE; along small sets of coins that were written in Kufic with the inscription of Tripoli, resembling the ones used in the Emirate of Tripoli (1079-1109). After few centuries of the Islamic conquests, the population of mount Lebanon, especially Keserwan, and to a lesser extent, Byblos, was overwhelmingly Shiite in population and a strong dominion of Shiites was present in Keserwan and the fringes of Byblos for five centuries since the start of the 9th century and the rise of the Hamdanids, but it was bound to vanish during 1305 and the Shias were forced leave or adopt the practice of taqiyyah. Hjoula was essentially a Maronite village, inhabited by Abi Khalil family. Of the famous inhabitants was Jibra'el Hjoula, the 104th Maronite patriarch who was killed by the Mamlouks c. 1367 CE in Tripoli. According to tradition and family legends, the earliest Shiites first inhabited the close town of Annaya before later moving to the interior to Hjoula in the start of the 16th century. Historically, Shiite presence was attested in Hjoula in the 1519 consensus. Hjoula paid a sizable portion of its income tax towards Aqbay ibn 'Abdallah family vakif; its share rose from 200 g. upon the conquest, to 300 g. during Selim II's reign (1566-1574), to 1,600 g. by the mid-seventeenth century. Population The village has a population of around 1900 inhabitants. The village has a population of around 1900 inhabitants.

Called by Pope Gregory IX, the Barons' Crusade broadly spanned from 1234-1241 and embodied the highest point of papal endeavor \\"to make crusading a universal Christian undertaking.\\" Gregory called for a crusade in France, England, and Hungary with different degrees of success. Although the crusaders did not achieve any glorious military victories, they used diplomacy to successfully play the two warring factions of the Muslim Ayyubid dynasty (As-Salih Ismail in Damascus and As-Salih Ayyub in Egypt) against one another for even more concessions than Frederick II gained during the more well-known Sixth Crusade. For a few years, the Barons' Crusade returned the Kingdom of Jerusalem to its largest size since 1187. This crusade to the Holy Land is sometimes discussed as two separate crusades: that of King Theobald I of Navarre, which began in 1239; and, the separate host of crusaders under the leadership of Richard of Cornwall, which arrived after Theobald departed in 1240. Additionally, the Barons' Crusade is often described in tandem with Baldwin of Courtenay's concurrent trip to Constantinople and capture of Tzurulum with a separate, smaller force of crusaders. This is because Gregory IX briefly attempted to redirect the target his new crusade from liberating the Holy Land from Muslims to protecting the Latin Empire of Constantinople from Orthodox (i.e., schismatic) Christians. Despite relatively plentiful primary sources, scholarship until recently has been limited, due at least in part to the lack of major military engagements. Although Gregory IX went further than any other pope to create an ideal of Christian unity in the process of organizing the crusade, in practice the crusade's divided leadership did not reveal a unified Christian action or identity in response to taking the cross. Background At the end of the Sixth Crusade in February 1229, Frederick II and Al-Kamil signed a 10-year truce. Using diplomacy alone and without major military confrontation, Frederick was given control of Jerusalem, Nazareth, Sidon, Jaffa, and Bethlehem. However, the treaty was set to expire in 1239, which endangered Christian control of the territories. Additionally, the Sixth Crusade was wildly unpopular among the native Christian leaders because the excommunicated Frederick left them defenseless, allied with their Muslim enemies, and attempted to gain control over the Holy Land for the House of Hohenstaufen rather than restore the territories to the local barons of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Therefore, in 1234, Pope Gregory IX proclaimed that a new crusade should arrive in the Holy Land by 1239 to ensure Christian control. In his effort to unite the Christians to defend the crusaders' territorial control in the Holy Land, Gregory issued the papal bull Rachel suum videns, which was actively used by mendicant friars to promote the crusade in every corner of Christendom. Rachel suum videns reinforced the usage of a vow of redemption policy initiated by previous Pope Innocent III in his bull Quia maior during his campaign for the Fifth Crusade. However, Innocent did not ask all Christians to redeem their vows after they took the cross. To make this crusade universal, Gregory obliged all Christians to attend crusade sermons, aiming to pray for the successful outcome and donate for the enterprise a large sum of money, one penny weekly for a decade. The preaching campaign had different success. While Italy, Germany, and Spain were mildly enthusiastic about Gregory's crusade, in Hungary, a few nobles and ecclesiastical officials became more actively engaged into the campaign. English and French knights and nobles initially also supported the pope's enterprise. About a year later, in December 1235, Gregory began numerous attempts to fully, then partially, redirect this planned crusade away from the Holy Land to instead combat the spread of Christian heresy in Latin Greece. His attempt to divert the crusade to assist the Latin Empire of Constantinople was largely unsuccessful. The Latin emperor, John of Brienne, the most vigorous papal supporter out of the other rulers, permitted in Constantinople the presence of a Latin patriarch, which promised a possibility of unifying both Greek and Latin churches. The Hungarian military elite headed by its king Bela I declined to go to Constantinople to fight the invading schismatics John III Doukas Vatatzes of Nicaes and Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria. In the summer of 1239, Hungarian king Bela allowed the heir to the Latin empire, Baldwin of Courtenay to cross the Hungarian border but declined to join Baldwin on his way to Constantinople. Simultaneously, Pope Gregory wrote a letter to the Dominicans' prior in Hungary asking him to preach the cross within the empire and exchange the vows for Jerusalem given by crusaders on those to Constantinople in return for indulgence. The pope promised indulgence to every soldier as well as to anyone who contributed money to the crusade. In February 1241, Gregory ordered to redirect the revenues collected in Hungary for a new military campaign against Frederic II, the German emperor. Baldwin of Courtenay, arrived in Constantinople first while other European knights and nobility; not unified, moved toward Jerusalem. In 1235, Gregory called upon French crusaders to fight in Constantinople instead of the Holy Land. On December 16, the pope ordered the Franciscan William of Cordelle to preach for crusade in Latin Greece. Theobald of Champagne responded to the call due to his need for papal support, but he ended up refusing to commute his vow for Jerusalem. In December 1238, Theobald received funding from Gregory for his crusade to Jerusalem. The disjointed groups of French barons traveled separately to the Holy Land, where they eventually faced military defeat followed by diplomatic success. The English barons, including brothers-in-law Richard of Cornwall and Simon of Montfort, were also divided and arrived there one year later. Crusade =Theobald I of Navarre's host= Theobald I, the king of Navarre, gathered an impressive list of European nobles at Lyon, including: Hugh IV, Duke of Burgundy; Amaury VI of Montfort; Robert de Courtenay the Grand Butler of France (not to be confused with Robert I, Latin Emperor, also from Courtenay); and Peter I, Duke of Brittany. They were accompanied by a number of counts of secondary rank, including: Guigues IV of Forez, Henry II, Count of Bar, Louis of Sancerre, Jehan de Braine the Count of M√¢con, William of Joigny, and Henry of Grandpr√©. Theobald's main force numbered some 1,500 knights, including a few hundred from Navarre. They departed France in August 1239, with most sailing from Marseilles and a smaller number departing from Frederick II's ports in southern Italy. Theobald reached Acre on 1 September; he was soon joined by those crusaders who were scattered by a Mediterranean storm in transit. There they met by a council of local Christian potentates, most prominently: Walter of Brienne, Odo of Montb√©liard, Balian of Beirut, John of Arsuf, and Balian of Sidon. Theobald was also joined by some crusaders from Cyprus. Theobald spent much time dallying at pleasant Acre, where he wrote a poem to his wife. Finally on 2 November, the group of about 4000 knights (more than half from the local barons and the military orders) marched to Ascalon, where they would begin the construction of a castle which had been demolished by Saladin decades prior. Two days into the march, Peter of Brittany and his lieutenant Raoul de Soissons split off to conduct a raid. They divided their forces and each waited in ambush along a possible route for the Muslim caravan which was moving up the Jordan to Damascus. Peter's half clashed with the Muslims outside a castle, and after some fighting, he sounded his horn to summon Raoul. The Muslims were routed and fled inside the castle, where Peter's men followed them, killed many, took some captives, and seized the booty and edible animals of the caravan.  Defeat at Gaza and loss of Jerusalem  The 1239 Beit Hanoun battle, by Matthew Paris Peter's minor victory would soon be overshadowed. When the complete army reached Jaffa on 12 November 1239, a subset of the army wanted to conduct a raid of their own. The leaders of this defiant group were Henry of Bar, Amaury of Montfort, and Hugh of Burgundy, alongside four of the major local lords, including Walter of Brienne, Balian of Sidon, John of Arsuf, and Odo of Montb√©liard. This group, which included somewhere between 400 and 600 knights, split off from the main army, against the clear protests of Theobald, Peter of Brittany, and the leaders of all three of the military orders (the Knights Templar, the Knights Hospitaller, and the Teutonic Order). The group rode all night and a portion of them soon battled an Egyptian force commanded by Rukn al-Din al-Hijawi at Gaza on the following day, 13 November. The contingent was soundly defeated before Theobald's forces could arrive to rescue them; Henry was killed, and Amaury was among several hundred crusaders taken prisoner. The army then marched all the way back to Acre. About a month after the battle at Gaza, An- Nasir Dawud of Transjordan, whose caravan had been seized by Peter, marched on Jerusalem, which was largely undefended. After a month of being holed up in the Tower of David, the garrison of the citadel surrendered to Dawud on 7 December, accepting his offer for safe passage to Acre. Jerusalem was in Muslim hands for the first time since 1229 (the Sixth Crusade). Ayyubid territorial concessions After the crusaders' setback at Gaza and the loss of Jerusalem, a civil war within the Muslim Ayyubid dynasty began to create a fortunate environment for the Christians. First, there was a promising but ultimately disappointing trip to Tripoli. The emir Al-Muzaffar II Mahmud of Hama wanted to distract his enemy, Al-Mujahid of Homs, so he lured Theobald's crusaders to Pilgrim Mountain outside of Tripoli with empty promises. Nothing happened; after a time as guests of Bohemond V of Antioch, the crusaders had returned to Acre by early May 1240. The Christians' next encounter with the Ayyubids proved dramatically more fruitful. Theobald negotiated with the warring emirs of Damascus and Egypt. He finalized a treaty with the As-Salih Ismail, Emir of Damascus in the north, against Ayyub of Egypt and Dawud of Transjordan, in the south, whereby the Kingdom of Jerusalem regained Jerusalem itself, plus Bethlehem, Nazareth, and most of the region of Galilee with many Templar castles, such as Beaufort and Saphet. Ismail's treaty with the crusaders included much territory that was not his to give: rather, it was a recognition of their right to take Dawud's lands. This treaty was very unpopular among Ismail's own subjects: the influential preacher and jurist Izz al-Din ibn 'Abd al-Salam publicly denounced it. Ismail had Ibn 'Abd al-Salam arrested in response. In an act of even more dramatic protest, the Muslim garrison of Beaufort refused to turn over the castle to Balian of Sidon, as Ismail's accord stipulated. Ismail himself had to besiege the stronghold with the army of Damascus for months, to seize it for the Christians. Meanwhile, the crusaders set about pursuing their claims to Dawud's lands. They began to rebuild Ascalon, raided throughout the Jordan valley, retook Jerusalem, and attacked Nablus (but did not capture it). This forced Dawud to negotiate his own treaty with Theobald in the late summer of 1240, fulfilling in fact many of the concessions which had been granted only in theory by Ismail. Some contemporary sources even imply that the whole of the land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean was put back in crusader hands. Theobald and Peter of Brittany did not remain to see their agreements with Ismail of Damascus and Dawud of Transjordan fully carried out. They departed from Palestine for Europe in mid-September 1240, before Richard of Cornwall arrived, because they did not wish to be present during any more internal quarreling over the leadership and direction of the enterprise. Souvenirs that Theobald brought back to Europe included the rose called \\"Provins\\" (Latin name rosa gallica 'officinalis', the Apothecary's Rose) from Damascus, transporting it \\"in his helmet\\"; a piece of the true cross. Hugh of Burgundy and Guigues of Forez stayed behind to assist with the castle at Ascalon. =Richard of Cornwall's host= On 10 June 1240 Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall left England with a smaller host of crusaders. This group consisted of roughly a dozen English barons and several hundred knights, including William II Longesp√©e. They made their way to Marseilles in mid-September, and landed at Acre during the autumn passage on 8 October. Simon de Montfort, younger brother of the captured Amaury, was also part of this group but seems to have traveled separately. He and his wife Eleanor went to Brindisi through Apulia and Lombardy all the way to Acre. Eleanor accompanied her husband only to Brindisi. Following that, William of Forz organized the third successful expedition to Jerusalem. In the end, the response of English barons to Gregory's call revealed a lack of indication of a common Christian identity. Richard and this second crusading host saw no combat, but they did complete the negotiations for a truce with Ayyubids leaders made by Theobald just a few months prior during the first wave of the crusade. They continued the rebuilding of Ascalon castle. Notably, Richard handed over custody of it to Walter Pennenpi√©, the imperial agent of Frederick II in Jerusalem (instead of turning it over to the local liege men of the Kingdom of Jerusalem who strongly opposed Frederick's rule). On 23 April 1241 they exchanged Muslim prisoners with Christian captives (most notably Simon's older brother Amaury) who had been seized during Henry of Bar's disastrous raid at Gaza one year and a half earlier. They also moved the remains of those killed in that battle and buried them at the cemetery in Ascalon. His work done, Richard departed at Acre for England on 3 May 1241. Aftermath Although the Barons' Crusade returned the Kingdom of Jerusalem to its largest size since 1187, the gains would be dramatically reversed merely a few years later. On July 15, 1244 Jerusalem was not simply captured but was reduced to ruins during the Siege of Jerusalem of 1244 and its Christians massacred by Khwarazmians from northern Syria (new allies of the Sultan of Egypt As-Salih Ayyub). A few months later, in October, Ayyub and the Khwarazmians achieved a major military victory at the Battle of La Forbie, which permanently crippled Christian military power in the Holy Land. Baldwin of Courtenay's concurrent crusade to Tzurulum A small, entirely separate crusading group heeded Pope Gregory's call to redirect the Barons' Crusade to defend the Latin Empire from John III Doukas Vatatzes of Nicaes and Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria. At the beginning of July in 1239, Baldwin of Courtenay the nineteen-year-old heir to the Latin Empire and Marquis of Namur, travelled to Constantinople with a small army (three times smaller than Barons' Crusade expedition) including the five secular magnates Humbert of Beaujeu, Thomas of Marle, Josseran of Brancion, William of Cayeaux, and Watins of La Haverie. On his way, with the help of Louis IX, Baldwin was able to cross the territory of Frederic II. He continued his way through Germany and Hungary, and at the Bulgarian border, he received a friendly invitation from Ivan Asen II and permission to march through his lands. In the winter of 1239, Baldwin finally returned to Constantinople, where he was crowned emperor sometime around Easter of 1240, after which he launched his crusade. Baldwin then besieged and captured Tzurulum, a Nicaean stronghold seventy-five miles west of Constantinople. Tzurulum was the place where two major eastbound routes on the way to Constantinople converged, one led from Thessalonica, and the other from Adrianople. The possession of this strategically important site should have provided more security for Constantinople. However, this victory could not compensate for the loss of two other Asia Minor fortresses, Darivya and Niketiaton (now in the village Eskihisar (tr)) which were captured by Vatatzes. Despite Baldwin's possession of Tzurulum, the Latin Empire continued to depend on western aid until its collapse two decades later in 1261.

Saint Rieul joined the abbey in 662, before succeeding Saint Nivard as Archbishop of Reims in 669. In 841 a priest from Reims stole the relic of the body of Saint Helena from Rome and the reliquary was transferred to the abbey. The relics attracted pilgrims and the revenues allowed the abbey to purchase lands and vineyards in the vicinity (40 hectares).Franck Ferrand, Au c≈ìur de l'histoire, Europe 1, 28 avril 2011 The remaining relics of St. Helena stayed in the monastery until the French Revolution broke out. The monastery was destroyed but the cellarer was able to hide the relics until they could be safely transported to Paris for public veneration again. They were then entrusted to the Knights of the Holy Sepulchre and installed in their church, Saint-Leu-Saint-Gilles in 1819.

As a two-year-old in 1992 he made an immediate impact, winning on his debut and then recording a six-length victory over a strong field in the Group One Racing Post Trophy. He was rated the best British juvenile of his generation. On his first appearance of 1993 he won the Chester Vase but lost his remaining four races but he did finish second in the Prix Lupin and the St Leger. At the end of his racing career he was retired to become a breeding stallion in Japan but had limited success as a sire of winners. Background Armiger was a chestnut horse with a broad white blaze and three long white socks bred in England by his owner Khalid Abdullah's Juddmonte Farms. He was sired by Rainbow Quest who won the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe before becoming a very successful breeding stallion. Rainbow Quest's other progeny included Quest for Fame, Saumarez, Raintrap, Nedawi Spectrum and Millenary. Armiger won one minor race at Windsor Racecourse from six starts as a three-year-old in 1988. She was a granddaughter of Treasure Chest, a Florida-bred broodmare whose other descendants have included Glint of Gold, Diamond Shoal and Ensconse (Irish 1,000 Guineas). The colt was sent into training with Henry Cecil at his Warren Place stable in Newmarket, Suffolk. Armiger was ridden in all but one of his races by Pat Eddery. Racing career =1992: two-year- old season= Armiger made his racecourse debut in a seventeen-runner maiden race over one mile at Newmarket Racecourse on 30 September. Starting the 7/2 second favourite tracked the leaders before taking the lead three furlongs from the finish and drew away in the closing stages to win by three and a half lengths from the Peter Chapple-Hyam-trained favourite Zind. On 24 October the colt was moved up sharply in class for the Group One Racing Post Trophy at Doncaster Racecourse and was made the 5/4 favourite ahead of the fillies Ivanka and Marillette (May Hill Stakes) and the Royal Lodge Stakes winner Desert Secret. Armiger tracked the leaders and turned into the straight in fourth place behind the outsiders Noyan, Newton's Law and Wahem. He took the lead two and a half furlongs from the finish and accelerated clear of his nine opponents to win by six lengths from Ivanka, with Zind another four lengths back in third. Brough Scott writing in The Independent called Armiger's performance as a \\"mighty\\" one and compared the colt's racing style to that of Mill Reef. The Racing Post's John Randall rated his performance the fifth best in the history of the race, behind those of Celtic Swing, Reference Point, Apalachee and Vaguely Noble. In the International Classification of European two-year-olds for 1992 Armiger was the top-rated British-trained colt, one pound behind the French-trained Zafonic. =1993: three-year-old season= Armiger began his second season in the Chester Vase (a trial race for The Derby) over one and a half miles on 4 May. Starting the 4/6 favourite against five opponents he maintained his unbeaten record, taking the lead in the final furlong and winning by two and a half lengths from the Irish-trained Shrewd Idea. As his connections were also responsible for the Derby favourite Tenby, it seemed probable that Armiger would contest the Prix du Jockey Club. After the race Cecil said that he was satisfied with the performance commenting \\"Like a lot of good horses he is lazy at home and he'll come on for the race... He has got very good speed and a lot of guts\\". Twelve days after his win at Chester, Armiger was sent to France for the Prix Lupin over 2100 metres at Longchamp Racecourse and started 1/2 favourite in a five-runner field which included Hernando and Dernier Empereur. After leading from the start he was challenged by Hernando in the straight, overtaken 200 metres from the finish and beaten a neck into second place. Cecil felt that the colt had failed to cope with the firmer ground but there were also fears that a previous back injury had hampered his progress. After a break of three months Armiger returned in the Group Two Great Voltigeur Stakes at York Racecourse on 17 August. He was made the odds-on favourite but never looked likely to win and was eased down by Eddery in the closing stages to finish seventh of the nine runners behind Bob's Return. On 11 September Armiger started 4/1 second favourite behind Bob's Return in a nine-runner field for the St Leger Stakes over fourteen and a half furlongs at Doncaster. After leading from the start he was overtaken by Bob's Return three furlongs from the finish but stayed on to hold second place, three and a half lengths behind the winner and a length and a half in front of his stable companion Edbaysaan. Armiger ended his racing career on 3 October in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. Ridden by Willie Carson, as Eddery opted to ride Khalid Abdullah's Irish Oaks winner Wemyss Bight, he finished fifteenth of the twenty-three runners, thirteen and a half lengths behind the winner Urban Sea. Stud record At the end of his racing career, Armiger was exported to Japan to stand as breeding stallion. He remained at stud until 2002 but appears to have had increasing fertility problems and sired only four foals in his last three seasons. He sired a total of 130 winners, with the best of his offspring probably being the mare Stephanie Chan who was placed twice in Graded stakes races.

Tonry, an American criminologist, is the McKnight Presidential Professor of Criminal Law and Policy at the University of Minnesota Law School. He is also the director of the University of Minnesota's Institute on Crime and Public Policy. He has been a visiting professor of law and criminology at the University of Lausanne since 2001 and a senior fellow at the Netherlands Institute for the Study of Crime and Law Enforcement at Free University Amsterdam since 2003. Education Tonry received his B.A. in history from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1966 and his L.L.B. from Yale Law School in 1970. In 1994, Tonry was a Visiting Fellow at All Souls College, Oxford. He was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from Free University Amsterdam in 2010. Career Tonry worked at the University of Chicago's Center for Studies in Criminal Justice from 1971 to 1973. From 1973 until joining the faculty of the University of Minnesota in 1990, he was on the faculty of the University of Birmingham and the University of Maryland, and also spent some of this time in private practice at different law firms, including Dechert. In 1990, he joined the University of Minnesota as the McKnight Presidential Professor of Criminal Law and Policy and the director of their Institute on Crime and Public Policy, positions he has held ever since, except for from 1999 to 2005, when he was a professor of law and public policy and director of the Institute of Criminology at Cambridge University. Work Tonry has researched various subjects in the field of criminal law, including the increasing incarceration rate in the United States during the late 20th century. He has been described as \\"a leading authority on crime policy\\" by the New York Times Adam Liptak. In a 2005 paper, he and David P. Farrington argued that if this increase was responsible for the declining crime rate in the United States after 1990, then one must find another explanation for the decline in the crime rate in Canada during the same time, since their incarceration rate remained flat during the same period. They also noted that during this time, Finland's incarceration rate declined, but their crime rate did not subsequently go up. In his 1995 book Malign Neglect: Race, Crime and Punishment in America, he acknowledged that racial disparities in the criminal justice system are mainly due to differences in criminal activity among races, but also found that the proportion of people arrested for murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault who were black had remained constant at about 45% since the mid-1970s. However, in a 2008 article in Crime and Justice with Matthew Melewski, Tonry found that a disproportionate number of racial minorities are incarcerated in part because sentencing policies have a disparate impact on those groups. In a 2009 article for Crime and Justice, he reviewed 200 years of evidence on mandatory minimums and concluded that they were unsupported by evidence. Views Tonry wrote in The Handbook of Crime and Punishment, published in 2008, that the United States' prison sentences are far harsher than those of other countries \\"to which the United States would ordinarily be compared,\\" and that English-speaking countries in general tend to be exceptionally punitive. He supports non-prison punishments for nonviolent offenders, but has acknowledged that the United States' prison population increasing to almost 2 million people (as of 1998) had reduced crime. That year, he told Eric Schlosser that \\"You could choose another two million Americans at random and lock them up, and that would reduce the number of crimes too.\\" Professional and editorial activities Tonry has been president of both the American and European Societies of Criminology. Since 1977, he has been the editor of Crime and Justice.

Like other villages of Byblos District, Mghayreh knew the Persian, the Macedonian, the Seleucid, the Christian Byzantine, the Mamluk, and the Ottoman rules. The mountainous territory of Byblos District, including Mghayreh has long been a shelter for minority and persecuted groups, including Maronite Christians and Shi‚Äôa The St elie church. Mghayreh stands on the slopes of Joubbat El Mnaitra, South of Akoura, West of Afqa, and East of Qartaba, high up in the mountains of the Adonis River, now known as Nahr Ibrahim. Mghayreh extends up to the plateau of Serghol . It is remarkable for the verdure of its landscapes, the abundance of its sources of water and the mildness of its climate. The source of water called 'Nabbeh Abou-salhab' is one of the most known spots in the village where inhabitants and visitors gather to fill water and meet. The source is used for irrigation along with drilling-wells in the village. Mghayreh is known for its blue convent. The Yannouh Shrine dates back to the Phoenician period and is located halfway between Byblos (Byblos) and Heliopolis (Baalbek), which is similar to the Afqa temple, dedicated to the worship of Adonis and Esterot during the Roman era. (2nd century AD) The temple was dedicated to the goddess Diana, Jupiter's daughter. It has been wrongly cited as a temple that belongs to Yanouh village situated on the east side of Mghayreh and also known as lower Mghayreh.

Billboard reviews for this disc were neutral to unfavorable. She went on to release several more solo singles for Starday including a third answer to the song to Mexican Joe which received much- improved reviews. Mary Jo Chelette and the Chelette Sisters were managed by Neva Starns, wife of Starday co-founder Jack Starns. The Starns created a radio program called \\"Houston Hometown Jamboree\\" to showcase Starday talent, and Mary Jo and the Chelette Sisters (who did not record for Starday) were featured on the program. By the end of 1953 she was making fifteen personal appearances a month.

Secker & Warburg) Vintage Stuff is a novel of British comic writer Tom Sharpe which was written and originally published in 1982. Set in Groxbourne, a parody of Bloxham School where Sharpe received his education, the novel follows the (mis)adventures of Peregrine Clyde-Brown. Plot summary Peregrine Roderick Clyde-Brown is a guileless and dim-witted teenager, who takes every phrase or word spoken to him literally. This is where the author displays his skill in playing with the English language, His attorney father (wishing to get rid of him) and his mother (having high hopes on him as a 'late bloomer') finally manage to get him admitted to a boarding private school called Groxbourne. In a school, asynchronous to its surrounding, Peregrine's tendency for unflinchingly taking orders and having negligible individual thought (and his becoming a crack shot on the school's rifle range) seem perfect for a promising career in the British Army. It is here at Groxbourne that Peregrine meets Gerald Glodstone, a teacher like others in the school, whose teaching methods involve using the cane, but who is also addicted to early- and pre-twentieth century adventure fiction. After Glodstone drags the loyal and obedient boy off to France on a seemingly romantic quest to rescue a French countess (a \\"quest\\" set into motion by another Groxbourne teacher who hates Glodstone), Peregrine ends up storming a French castle where he commits havoc and even murder, the effects of which would span countries and affect everyone around him.  Critical reception  \\"When Tom Sharpe turns his attention to a very minor public school- the result is predictably savage. Hoaxes, chases, car crashes, shootings, and general mayhem. Wicked riotous humour\\" (Daily Telegraph) \\"Wildly hilarious pot-shots at the public school system and the sacred cows of adventure fiction\\" (Observer) \\"You'll enjoy this wild and, in places, wildly funny story- It is all an hilarious send-up of the Dornford Yates style of thriller with some modernistic Sharpe barbs added\\" (Daily Express) \\"One of our best contemporary comic writers- very, very funny\\" (Birmingham Evening Mail) \\"Excellently funny\\" (Auberon Waugh, Daily Mail)  References  1\\\\. http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2013/06/tom-sharpe-nearly-killed-me/ Spectator news.

The sole season, consisting of 22 episodes, began airing on History on February 18, 2016. The show features Ferguson and a panel of special guests including comedians, actors and academics discussing unorthodox and provocative historical topics. The title of the show refers to the well-known 1754 political cartoon of the same name, which was created by Benjamin Franklin and became a symbol of colonial freedom during the American Revolutionary War. Ferguson also got the cartoon tattooed on his arm when he became an American citizen. Production Individual episodes cover topics such as bad medical ideas, worst political blunder, most influential drug, most influential band, greatest Founding Father, and history's biggest frenemies. Ferguson and a three-guest panel (usually consisting of scholars, comedians and people that Ferguson \\"talked to, liked, and respected\\" during his time as host of The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson) conduct a humorous discussion about six candidates for the title in question. Viewers are invited to vote for their top choice on Twitter, and once the panel has narrowed the field from six candidates to two, the studio audience decides the winner by majority vote. Each episode starts with a humorous monologue by Ferguson; the first 13 episodes also end with a more contemplative one in which he relaxes on the set with his suit jacket, vest, and tie removed. During the February 24, 2016 episode of the online show Larry King Now, Ferguson told host Larry King that 22 episodes of Join or Die had already been produced. He added that the History Channel had placed an order for additional episodes. However, on March 31, 2017, during an episode of Ferguson's new Sirius XM radio show on which King was a guest, he stated that the show had been cancelled. The final episode of the season, \\"History's Biggest Douchebag\\", was scheduled for June 16, 2016, but it was removed from the day's schedule. \\"History's Biggest Douchebag\\" aired July 28, 2016 on History Canada.

Founded by Earle Grey and his wife, Mary Godwin, the company specialized in Shakespearean productions, and were responsible for founding the first Shakespeare Festival in Canada in 1949. In addition to holding its annual festival, the Players also toured the country, performing Shakespeare in schools, often providing students with their first exposure to seeing Shakespeare performed live.  Founding and early history  In England, Earle Grey met and married Mary Godwin, and the two had a son, Anthony. The Greys came to Canada in 1939 as part of a theater troop touring the country. When the troop returned to England, the Greys decided to remain in Toronto. They became part of the small theater community there, and noticed that it lacked any Shakespeare tradition. By the mid-1940s, the Greys noticed Canada's burgeoning appreciation for Shakespeare, and the two formed the Earle Grey Players in 1946, designed to promote Shakespeare all season long for the Canadian public. The following year the company put on a production of Twelfth Night on the north terrace of Trinity College. With the success of that performance, the group began presenting Shakespearean productions at different high schools around the country. The group continued to perform at Trinity College over the next several years, holding performances either outside on the quadrangle, or inside of Strachan Hall.  Earle Grey Shakespeare Festival  The group began the First Canadian Shakespeare Festival, which opened on June 27, 1949, with a performance of As You Like It, at the University of Toronto's Trinity College quadrangle. Two years later, the Grey's planted a mulberry tree, alleged to have been taken from the root of the tree supposedly planted by Shakespeare at his last residence, the New Place. With the formation of the Earle Grey Shakespeare Festival, it supplanted the Shakespeare Society of Toronto as the primary source of Shakespeare in Canada. Its primacy was short-lived, however, with the creation of the Stratford Festival in 1953, which quickly grew to the largest Shakespeare festival in the country. As the Stratford waxed, the Earle Grey Festival waned, and the last festival was held in 1959. A fundamental principle of the Grey festival was to produce historical accurate plays according to the author's intentions, a concept which was a significant addition to the post-war discussion on theater. > As far as possible twentieth-century notions would not be permitted. Stunts, > fashionable slants, Freudian implications, and silly-clever ideas which are > the bane of the contemporary Shakespeare theatre would be ruled out. > Arrogant directors would not provide crutches to help the aged and halting > playwright in his shamble to oblivion. The accumulation of varnish and the > over-painting of centuries would be stripped off and the picture shown as > Shakespeare's brush had left it. Our watchword would be 'Back to > Shakespeare'... our resolution would be to try and give our audience what > Shakespeare had in mind when he wrote, and not some distortion or > misconception based on modern ideas.  Aftermath  In 1960 the Greys left Canada, returning to England, where they continued acting right up to their deaths: Mary Godwin in 1971 and Earl Grey in 1978. In 1986, the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television (ACTRA), as part of the Gemini Awards, inaugurated its lifetime achievement award, and named it after Earle Grey, who had served as the first president of ACTRA's Toronto local.

It belongs to Kosi Division. It is 167 km from State capital Patna. It is contiguous with Kumhrauli to its north, Fequrahi to the south, Telwa to the east, Kosi River to the west. It comes under Shahpur-Majhaul Panchayath and Mahisi constituency. The Majhaul village has population of 3698 of which 1919 are males while 1779 are females as per Population Census 2011.  Demographics  The village is spread over 700-800 acres. It divided into 6 wards (Ward number 9 to 14). Average Sex Ratio of Majhaul village is 927 which is higher than Bihar state average of 918. Child Sex Ratio for the Majhaul as per Census of India 2011 is 977, higher than Bihar average of 935. The population has decreased by -11.4% in last 10 years.  Land, farming and agriculture  Majhaul and its surrounding areas are part of the Kosi River. This makes the land very fertile. The Kosi embankment is only 300 to 500 meter west. The farmers in the village mostly cultivate Dhaan (paddy crop), Makai (Maize/Corn), Gahum (Wheat crop) and Moong (a type of lentils) in their farms. Since the climate of this region is most suitable for Dhaan (the paddy crop), Makai (Maize/Corn) a good crop brings happiness to many farmers in the village. Though, people do try to grow wheat crops, only few farmers get good yields. Most of the farmers have moderate harvest and hence it is not as popular as harvesting of Dhaan (the paddy crop), Makai (Maize/Corn. Instead, maize is the first best crop for the farmers of this village and Dhaan (the paddy crop) is the second. Therefore, they are tempted to grow garma dhaan and makai (maize) crops together apart from harvesting regular crops. The timing of Dhaan harvesting is especially notable as the villagers are happy in general for several reasons. The fresh crop of Dhaan and Makai (Maize/Corn) reaches every home, Whether you are owner of the land, or the farmer or just the harvester. The Dhaan is bound to come to every household. It can be cooked straight or flattened to make Chura which makes an amazing food when combined with fresh Sakkar (Jaggery) and \\"Dahi\\" (Curd). In the rainy season (Savan aur Bhado) the whole agriculture land of this village is covered by rain water, so in this season the main food of the villagers fish and some aqua fruits.

It released its report in 1994, but some felt that more could be investigated. This resulted in the establishment of the Commission of Inquiry on Overcoming the Consequences of the SED Dictatorship in the Process of German Unity lasting from 1995 to 1998, which had the same objective, but investigated more thoroughly. Both commissions had to look at the dictatorship itself and the human rights violation under the rule of the East German Socialist Unity Party (SED). The second commission, however, was more focused on the effects on everyday life than on the human rights violations. The idea of a commission was brought up by the non-governmental organization Human Rights Watch. There were many issues over racism and human rights violation after the unification in 1989, and Human Rights Watch therefore recommended the creation of a commission that would look at human rights violations in the former East Germany. In the same year the first commission was created for \\"the purpose of truly unifying Germany\\"United States Institute of Peace. \\"Truth Commission : Germany 92\\", p.216. Accessed March 3, 2016. http://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/file/resources/collections/commissions/Germany92-Charter.pdf  Germany after World War II  After World War II, Germany was divided in two parts, East Germany which was called the German Democratic Republic (GDR) and was led by the Socialist Unity Party (SED), and West Germany which was called the Federal Republic of Germany and was governed by the Western Allied powers (United States, United Kingdom, France). = East Germany = East Germany was a communist state under Soviet influence. The GDR claimed full employment. As Sue Lawson writes, \\"even the lowest earners could manage a reasonable, if modest, standard of living. Poverty, homelessness and dependence on benefits hardly existed.\\" Lawson, Sue. \\"Social Provision.\\" In Modern Germany, edited by Peter James, p.88. New York : Routledge, 1998. Accessed February 4, 2016. East Germans did not worry about finding a job: \\"In the old GDR you were never unemployed.\\" Lawson, Sue. \\"Social Provision.\\" In Modern Germany, edited by Peter James, p.91. New York : Routledge, 1998. Accessed February 4, 2016. There was demographic issue because of the low birth rate which caused employment issues, and for that reason the GDR decided to create laws that would help parents to have children and to work at the same time. There were advantages for people who married before age thirty. They had access to interest-free loans, and the repayment of the loan would diminish every time they had a child.Lawson, Sue. \\"Social Provision.\\" In Modern Germany, edited by Peter James, p.89. New York : Routledge, 1998. Accessed February 4, 2016. This led to an increase in childbirth and overall population. The status of women was valued in East Germany. Almost all women able to work could have a job at the same time as having children, though this did mean more work for many women in both employment and child care.Lawson, Sue. \\"Social Provision.\\" In Modern Germany, edited by Peter James, p.90. New York : Routledge, 1998. Accessed February 4, 2016. In time, demands in the GDR for freedom of expression, travel and assembly rose.Peter James. Modern Germany. New York : Routledge, 1998, p. 6. Accessed February 4, 2016. As East Germans started to see other Eastern European communist countries throwing off Soviet control, citizens started to protest and in 1989, the peaceful revolution started. In August 1989, many East Germans tried to leave the GDR for West Germany. In September 1989, many went to Hungary because it had opened its doors to Austria, and from Austria, they could reach West Germany. Weekly demonstrations began to take place: every Monday, people would protest in the street and ask for freedom under the slogan Wir sind das Volk, \\"we are the people.\\" In October, Erich Honecker, the leader of East Germany, had no choice but to resign. On 9 November, cabinet member G√ºnter Schabowski announced the \\"immediate freedom of travel for East German citizens\\".James, Peter. \\"Road to unity.\\" In Modern Germany, edited by Peter James, p.7. New York : Routledge, 1998. Accessed February 4, 2016. All these protests and demonstrations led to the unification of both Germanies on 3 October 1990. = West Germany = West Germany had a similar demographic problem to the one in the East, but implemented a different solution. Rather than attempting to increase birth rates, West Germany imported foreign \\"guest workers.\\" There was no attempt to further integrate women into the economic system. If a woman was a mother, she would work part-time or not at all. West Germany's priority was economic growth, rather than maternity and childcare, and for that reason people that were unemployed had to resort to welfare benefits.  After Unification  = Economy = After the Unification, Germany realized that absorbing the GDR would be costly. East Germany was poorer than West Germany, putting strain on the finances of the new, unified government.Forsythe, David P., editor. Encyclopedia of Human Rights, Volume 5, p. 305. Oxford University Press, 2009. By 1991, the government was forced to increase taxes to stem the budget deficit. Unemployment in the East Germany became a major problem and differences were more visible because the West had a lower percent of unemployment than the East. The unification also affected Europe's economy, contributing to \\"a European currency crisis in 1992.\\" = Women = Women seemed to be more affected by unification and the transition than men. In the old East Germany, some women had access to \\"unpaid child care leave until the child started school, and then return to a similar job.\\" Once both Germanies were unified, women lost these advantages.Ibid., p. 90. Their economic situation was not as secure as before due to a shortage of jobs. Consequently, many women faced early retirement as they lost their former job security.Ibid., p.91.  Human Rights Watch  In 1992, the organization Human Rights Watch sent a mission to Germany to analyze racism and human rights violations in the country following unification. The group suggested that Germany created a truth and reconciliation commission to investigate these current problems as well as East Germany's past. As a result the Commission of Inquiry for the Assessment of History and Consequences of the SED Dictatorship in Germany was established in 1992 by the German government.Human Rights Watch/Helsinky. \\"Germany for Germans\\" Xenophobia and Racism Violence in Germany. United States of America: Human Rights Watch, 1995, p. 1-7.  The 1992 commission (Commission of Inquiry for the Assessment of History and Consequences of the SED Dictatorship in Germany)  The commission was created on May 14, 1992 and released its report in June 1994. It was set up by members of the German Parliament in March 1992. In the early 1990s, all archives of the GDR as well as the SED were made available to scholars. When the commission began, the commissioners had access to all the records that could be found. The commission had 27 members, led by the East German parliamentarian and human rights activist Rainer Eppelmann. Other members included Markus Meckel, Gerd Poppe, Dr. Dorothea Wils, Dirk Hansen, and Dr. Dietman Keller. = Why a commission? = Germany established a truth commission as a result of ongoing social tensions and problems affecting the country, in hopes that it would be a solution. Additionally, many Germans wanted answers about the SED dictatorship and the effects it had on \\"the possibilities of political and moral rehabilitation of the victims.\\" United States Institute of Peace. \\"Truth Commission: Germany 92\\", p.216. Accessed March 3, 2016. http://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/file/resources/collections/commissions/Germany92-Charter.pdf The German government and parliament also felt strongly about the commission, believing that it was essential to unify Germany. Instead of retributive justice, the German Parliament opted for a focus on restorative justice because of ongoing social problems, aiming at non-violent reconciliation of those problems.R√∂ssner, Dieter. \\"Mediation as a Basic Element of Crime Control: Theoretical and Empirical Comments\\", Buffalo Criminal Law Review, Vol. 3, No. 1 (April 1999): p. 214. = Mandate = The mandate had two main objectives. The first was to help the victims of the GDR and the SED. The second was about reconciliation. Germany needed to be reconciled with its past so it needed to develop a common political culture. To do so, the commission had to look at human rights violations. It had to examine every aspect of the dictatorship, how it functioned, what was its ideology and theology, what responsibilities it had for human rights violations, and what role it played in the destruction of the environment. The commission also had to investigate which groups were oppressed and to think about ways they could give restitution to these oppressed groups.United States Institute of Peace. \\"Truth Commission: Germany 92\\", p.217. Accessed March 3, 2016. http://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/file/resources/collections/commissions/Germany92-Charter.pdf The commission needed to look at the opposition in East Germany and its actions, as well as the role of the Lutheran Church. The influences of \\"international framework conditions\\" (more precisely, Soviet politics), needed to be investigated, as did the relation between both Germanies.Ibid., p.217. The commission's mandate included research covering the years from 1945 until 1989. The commission also needed to include scholarly expertise, public hearings and forums, as well as discussion with citizens. = Recommendations = The commission's recommendations included: * the creation of national holidays, including the unification date (3 October) * documentary centers and a map of the governing buildings used by the SED so people would be aware of their past and could achieve reconciliation. The commission hoped that would also help to build a common political culture and shared historical knowledge to have a truly unified Germany * the exchange of information with Eastern European countries * a permanent foundation to implement the recommendations and try to help victims from the SED period. = Conclusions = The most notable impact the first commission had was the establishment of a subsequent commission to further investigate matters that the first one had not addressed. Parliament opted to wait for the report of the second commission before taking any decisions on the recommendations of the first commission. = Criticism = \\"However, a great deal of criticism was voiced by victims of the GDR dictatorship that the support rendered by the state came late, was too limited, and did not cover all groups of victims.\\" Forsythe, David P., editor. Encyclopedia of Human Rights, Volume 5, Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 309. There were also some victims that talked about victors' justice. For example, \\"At the universities, a comprehensive screening took place. Many professors and lecturers were dismissed on the basis of Stasi documents and other evidence showing that they had worked as informers for the Stasi or were SED members. There were number of protests by the accused and their supporters who felt that these dismissals were unjust and constituted revenge.\\" Forsythe, David P., editor. Encyclopedia of Human Rights, Volume 5, Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 308. Media also criticized without knowing the facts. The commission was accused of being useless because it did not change anything. It was also criticized for the length of the report, which totalled 18 volumes.  The 1995 commission (Commission of Inquiry on Overcoming the Consequences of the SED Dictatorship in the Process of German Unity)  The second commission ran from July 1995 to June 1998, and focused primarily on aspects of the mandate that had not been examined by the earlier commission. Rainer Eppelmann stayed on as chairman of the commission, but the number of commissioners increased to 36, who were later divided into 9 groups. All commissioners were chosen by the German parliament. = Mandate = The second commission followed the same mandate as the first, but focused more on aspects of everyday life under the SED dictatorship, such as discrimination against women, education and economic effects. The mandate also analyzed social effects, science and culture in East Germany as well as unified Germany, focusing on both past and present. = Recommendations/Reparations and Aftermath = The recommendations from the second commission were essentially the same as the first , but also added the need to educate the people about their past. Discarding the call for this to be done through a dedicated foundation, commissioners suggested that people could learn about their past in schools instead. They called again for a permanent and independent foundation that would follow up the recommendations, investigate the past, preserve the commission's archives, and provide assistance to the victims of the SED. Hohensch√∂nhausen As opposed to the first commission, this one convinced parliament and the government to create the independent foundation that would, in a sense, continue the work of both commissions. This foundation was called the \\"Stiftung zur Aufarbeitung der SED-Diktatur\\" (Foundation for the Reappraisal of the SED Dictatorship). It was created on 5 June 1998. There was also a memorial built in Berlin. Another foundation was created and named \\"Hohensch√∂nhausen\\". The mandate of this foundation was to investigate history and to educate the public about it. In 2007, there a law passed to give reparations to persons that were prisoners during the SED dictatorship. The Stiftung zur Aufarbeitung der SED-Diktatur helped creating the law to give reparation to the victims of the SED. They expanded the reparations to victims other than just political prisoners.

They were the 14th national games, and the second time the games had been held in Bombay.  Background  In late 1949, the Bengal Provincial Olympic Association, whose turn it was to hold the next national games, could not do so, and, at the Indian Olympic Association meeting on 24 October 1949, members from other associations were asked to stage these games but no province took the responsibility. The IOA President Maharaja of Patiala then asked Bombay to host the games; it agreed and had just three months to organise the event.  Organising Challenges  The Bombay Provincial Olympic Association tackled many challenges as it organised for the games. First, it approached the Bombay Government for assistance, and then Bombay Home and Revenue Minister Morarji Desai presided over the first Organizing Committee meeting for the games. Second, it sought housing for about 700 sportspersons; Major General Brar and Brigadier Madhavsinhji assisted in this effort of putting up the Olympic Village in the Barracks close to the Stadium. Third, the CCI authorities and Homi Contractor readily acceded to the request to hold the games at Brabourne Stadium. Fourth, the question of feeding the athletes arose, and Controller of Rationing Quereshi assisted with this effort. Fifth, orders for the latest international sporting equipment had to be placed, and Secretary of the Bombay Provincial Olympic Association Sohrab Bhoot handled this task.  Organisation  And so the National Games were held on 4‚Äì13 February 1950 in Bombay. Key administrators for these Games were Organising Council Chair Morarji Desai; Organising Committee Chair A. S. deMello (then President of the Bombay Provincial Olympic Association); and Organising Committee Secretary Sohrab Bhoot (then Secretary of the Bombay Provincial Olympic Association). The organising committee included 3 representatives of the Indian Olympic Association Council, as well as the Executive Committee of the Bombay Provincial Olympic Association. Also assisting with organisation were members of the Reception committee, Meher and Golwalla; Stadium committee, Bebbington and Taraporewala; Village committee, Davies, Saugar, and Wadia; Grounds committee, Rane and Pardiwala; Publicity committee, Mody and Saugar; Finance committee, Mehta and Kapadia; Transport committee, Shenoy and Kate; Program committee, Joseph and Gole; and Games committee, Mhaskar and Gole. The brochure for the Games thus noted: \\"True to Bombay tradition we had the help and cooperation from one and all whom we approached in the cause of Sports.\\" And A.S.

Early life Carter was born in Charleston, West Virginia. She was born the same the year a state constitution was passed to prohibit black and white children from attending the same schools. She earned a teaching degree from Storer College in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, in 1891. In the late 1890s, Carter traveled with the Hampton Institute Singers from Hampton, Virginia. She traveled with them throughout Europe, although she was not a singer. She also attended the Hampton Institute for a time. Career After receiving her undergraduate degree, Carter initially taught in West Virginia, at Kanawha County public schools. Cobb was a founding member of the Charleston Woman's Improvement League in 1898. She organized the teacher-trainer department at West Virginia Colored Institute in 1908, and stayed for 12 years. The school is now known as West Virginia State University. In the 1920s, Carter was known as the first black woman to work in newspapers in West Virginia, and also was seen as a \\"leader in the fight against illiteracy.\\" In 1925, Carter was named superintendent of the State Industrial Home for Colored Girls in Huntington, West Virginia. She received the position after the death of her husband, Emory Carter. She refused to take the position until the bars that lined the home's windows were removed by the state. She held that position for 10 years. In 1935, Carter returned to Charleston and was named director of adult education for Kanawha County schools. She retired from this position two years later. She soon became the Dean at the National Trade and Professional School for Women and Girls in Washington, DC in 1945, and went on to serve as the school's acting president at age 89. She served there for a total of 17 years. In 1962, she returned to her home of Charleston, where she resided until her death. Additionally, she stayed active in the African- American community until shortly after her 100th birthday in 1973. Over her career, she was an outspoken proponent of school integration. She believed that integration should not come at the expense of African-American achievements not being recognized, and ethnic histories being wiped from the curriculum. Throughout her life, she received postgraduate education at Ohio State University, Oberlin College, the University of Chicago, and Columbia University. Honors On June 11, 1977 the mayor of Charleston, John G. Hutchinson, named the day Fannie Cobb Carter Day. She is also honored with a bronze marker from the Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History, through their National Historic Marker Project.

The Hong Kong localist movement encompasses a variety of groups with different goals, but all of them oppose the perceived growing encroachment of the Chinese central government on the city's management of its own political, economic, and social affairs. Issues of concern to localist groups include land use and development, cultural and heritage conservation on the left, parallel trading and the increasing number of mainland immigrants and tourists on the right. On the autonomy of Hong Kong, many of them advocate the Hong Kong people's right to self- determination, while milder elements advocate for greater autonomy while remaining part of China, and the most radical call for return to British rule or full independence as a sovereign state. Certain right-wing localist groups also advocate for a more aggressive and militant approach in defending popular interests. Though localist groups with different agendas and ideologies have existed since the territory's transfer of sovereignty, today's movement as a whole emerged in the early 2010s and gained significant traction following widespread protests in 2014 against the Chinese government's decision to pre- screen Chief Executive candidates before allowing them to be chosen by the general public in a 2017 election. Following these protests, a number of localist political parties were formed, organising protests and participating in Legislative Council elections. In the 2016 Legislative Council election, localist candidates won 6 of the 35 seats allocated for geographical constituencies, earning a 19 per cent share of total votes. After the election, the government took legal actions against the localist and the radical democrat legislators over the oath-taking controversy, which resulted in the disqualifications of six legislators, and furthermore, the disqualification of the candidacies of the accused \\"pro-independence\\" localist candidates. Terminology Localism in the western context constitutes libertarian ideas of a decentralised local government as opposed to the central government, and stresses on self-sufficiency, agriculture and communalism. Although it also stresses Hong Kong's economic self-sufficiency and local democracy, in the Hong Kong context, localism emphasises the mainland Chinese cultural and political threat to the city and attempts to reinforce a Hong Kong identity as opposed to the Chinese national identity. It often includes an anti-immigration stance especially in the right-wing rhetoric, and it has been said that \\"nativism\\" is synonymous with localism. Some localists call themselves \\"autonomists\\", while the Beijing government brands them \\"separatists\\". History of local consciousness in Hong Kong Hong Kong was established in 1841 as a free port. The colonial government encouraged the free movement of capital and labour and there was not a strict sense of \\"Hong Kong residents\\" or \\"Hong Kong people\\". Residents were not registered by the government until 1949, a response to the influx of refugees fleeing from the Communists' takeover in Mainland China. Sociologist Lui Tai- lok in his book Four Generations of Hong Kong People, divided Hong Kong people into four generations. The first generation, he states, was the ones who were born before 1945 and had experienced the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong, while the baby boomers, the second generation who were born after the war, were the first wave of local consciousness. =First wave= The baby boomers were children of the refugees but were born and raised in Hong Kong and have a strong sense of belonging. They sought to break through the Cold War rivalry between the Communists and the Nationalists which dominated the political scene at the time. There were few advocates for decolonisation of Hong Kong from the British rule during the post-war period, notably Ma Man-fai and the Democratic Self-Government Party of Hong Kong in the 1960s. The 1970s saw unprecedented waves of student movements, such as the Chinese Language Movement and the anti-corruption movement, the defend the Diaoyu Islands movement, and so on, which were independent of the left-right spectrum and became the first wave of local consciousness. The Chinese Language Movement succeeded in having Chinese join English as an official language of Hong Kong. The student movements at the time consisted of some liberal, Chinese nationalist, and anti-colonialist elements. In the 1960s and 70s, the colonial government also attempted to create an apolitical local consciousness in order to boost the legitimacy of the colonial rule. Under Governor Murray MacLehose's administration, Hong Kong underwent a massive decolonisation reform. The aim of creating a local identity was to raise the bid for the British side in the upcoming negotiation over Hong Kong sovereignty after 1997. The British government also carefully avoided to provoke Hong Kong people's British belongingness as it had already decided to prevent massive migration from Hong Kong to Britain. =Second wave= The second wave of local consciousness emerged in the 1990s as colonial rule was coming to an end. The 1989 Tiananmen massacre sparked massive local protest and fear about looming Communist rule. The local cultural scene responded by consolidating enthusiasm about distinctive features as well as diversity of Hong Kong culture and identity. It cited post-colonial theory, rejecting Sinocentric chauvinism and promoting the cosmopolitanism of Hong Kong as an international city, together with liberal ideals of inclusiveness, diversity and trans- nationality. It also emphasised the importance of universal values, a diverse civil society, civic education, press and academic freedoms after 1997. In the late 1980s, established politicians, most notably Anson Chan, Chung Sze-yuen and the UMELCO, sought to voice the concerns on the behalf of the Hong Kong people in discussions between the Chinese and British governments. This, however, was unfruitful and saw Hong Kong's sovereignty transferred to the PRC in 1997. =Third wave= Edinburgh Place Ferry Pier in 2006. Guangzhou-Hong Kong XRL outside of the Legislative Council building in 2010. The 1 July 2003 march recorded an estimated 500,000 to 700,000 people demonstrating against the government's proposed anti-sedition legislation, the largest protest since the 1989 Tiananmen Square protest. Many post-80s (the generation who were born in the 1980s, Millennials in western terminology) were inspired by the democracy movement and came out onto the streets. 7.1 People Pile was one of the groups which emerged after the protest. They were upset by rapid urban development which was sweeping away old neighbourhoods and communities. They were strongly opposed to the political and economic monopoly of vested interests, collusion between business and government, and questioned the nature of the capitalist system in Hong Kong. They were also dissatisfied with the established opposition pro-democracy camp, which they considered ineffective in challenging the system. Several conservation movements led by young activists emerged, protesting against demolition of the Edinburgh Place Ferry Pier, Queen's Pier, and the buildings on Lee Tung Street (known as \\"Wedding Card Street\\") in 2006 and 2007. Protests against the construction of the Hong Kong section of the high-speed rail link to Guangzhou (XRL) escalated in 2009 and 2010 and established a new high point of the localist movement. Rise of contemporary localism =Chin Wan's city-state theory= The failure of the peaceful anti-XRL protests damaged the reputation of the left- leaning moderate activists. Some turned to a more radical approach. Scholar Chin Wan published the book, On the Hong Kong City-State in 2011 which triggered fierce public debate and was popular among the young generation. In the book, Chin suggests abandoning the hope for a democratic China and positions the democracy movement in a \\"localist\\" perspective, in order to counter Beijing's \\"neo-imperialist\\" policies toward Hong Kong. It analysed the potential threat of the influx of mainland tourists and immigrants to the established institutions and social customs of Hong Kong, which he considered likely part of a colonisation scheme by Beijing, including the increasing use of Mandarin Chinese and Simplified Chinese in daily use and in schools. He advocates \\"Hong Kong First\\" and \\"Hong Kong-China separation\\" positions in order to protect Hong Kong from \\"cultural genocide\\". He suggested building Hong Kong into an autonomous city-state, merging the British culture with a restored Chinese culture. Chin's view was largely accepted by Hong Kong independence advocates and those who advocate for the restoration of British rule in Hong Kong. Since then, it has created a paradigm shift on Hong Kong local consciousness from the left-wing discourse of reinterpreting colonial history, cherishing the inclusive and diverse nature of the Hong Kong culture to the right-wing discourse of anti-Chinese sentiment and nostalgia for British rule. Chin also tells his followers to use violent action as the means for defending Hong Kong's autonomy. He once joined the group Hong Kong Autonomy Movement. After leaving the HKAM group, he set up his own autonomist group called the Hong Kong Resurgence Order. Another group inspired by Chin's idea called the Hong Kong Nativism Power was set up in 2011. They protested against the inclusion of non-Hong Kong permanent residents in the HK$6,000 cash handouts program as demanded by new immigrants support groups and called for a revision of the current immigration policy. =Hong Kong‚ÄìMainland conflict= Protest in front of the Dolce & Gabbana store over the alleged discriminatory controversy. Many conflicts between Mainlanders and Hongkongers also occurred due to the influx of the tourists and immigrants, such as the Dolce & Gabbana controversy, the Kong Qingdong incident, birth tourism, and parallel trading among mainland tourists, among others. These incidents and issues intensified the anti-Chinese sentiment among the Hong Kong public. Some of them published an advertisement on local newspapers, calling Mainlanders \\"locusts\\" who steal resources from Hongkongers. At the same time, the localists are hostile toward the pan-democracy camp, as they believed the pan-democrats' cosmopolitanism as unrealistic and their wish for a democratic China will sacrifice at Hong Kong interest. They are also dissatisfied with the believed ineffectiveness of the pan-democrats as the opposition party for the past 20 years. On the other hand, the right-wing populist tendency of the localist movements was condemned as \\"xenophobic\\" and \\"nativist\\" by mainstream activists and the government. The conflict between the left and the right wings of the movement resulted in great disunity of the whole democratic cause. In the 2012 Legislative Council election, some pan- democrat candidates, including Claudia Mo of the Civic Party and Gary Fan of the Neo Democrats, both claiming to be moderates, expressed some localist ideas and raised concerns on tourist and immigration policies. For that, they set up a parliamentary group called HK First. Legislator Wong Yuk-man, a strong critic of the Communist Party and former member of People Power and his prot√©g√© Wong Yeung-tat, leader of the activist group Civic Passion, also switched to the localist cause soon after the election. Criticising the annual vigil to commemorate the Tiananmen Square crackdown held by the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China for having a Chinese nationalistic theme, Civic Passion organised its alternative 4 June rally in Tsim Sha Tsui. The alternative event attracted 200 people in 2013 and 7,000 in 2014, compared with 180,000 and 150,000 respectively for the main event.Ip, Kelly; Phneah, Jeraldine; NectarGan (5 June 2013) \\"Undampened\\" . The Standard.Tiananmen massacre remembered at massive Hong Kong vigil, chinaworker.info, 6 June 2014 In mid 2012, the government's decision to implement Moral and National Education was criticised for applauding the communist and nationalist positions of the Chinese government and attacking Western-style democracy.CBCNews. [www.cbc.ca/news/world/hong-kong-fears-pro- china-brainwashing-in-education-1.1296013 Hong Kong fears pro-China brainwashing in education]. The Associated Press. 7 September 2012 A student- led group, Scholarism, headed by Joshua Wong, occupied the Hong Kong government headquarters, drawing a massive protester turnout and succeeding in securing a government back down. =\\"Hong Kong Nationalism\\"= The Undergrad, the official publication of the Hong Kong University Students' Union (HKUSU), from February 2014, published a few articles on the subject of a Hong Kong nation. Articles entitled ‚ÄúThe Hong Kong nation deciding its own fate‚Äù and ‚ÄúDemocracy and Independence for Hong Kong‚Äù raise the localist discourse to the level of political autonomy for Hong Kong, which in effect would be tantamount to Hong Kong independence. Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying used his 2015 New Year's policy address to direct harsh criticism at the magazine for promoting Hong Kong independence, fanning both the debate and sales of the book Hong Kong Nationalism which featured the articles. = Umbrella Revolution = In 2013, legal scholar Benny Tai, considered a moderate democrat, advocated a civil disobedience plan to pressure Beijing to implement genuine universal suffrage in Hong Kong. The plan matured into Occupy Central. The right-wing localists were largely against it, mainly because they believed it was a plot by pan-democrats to hijack popular support. Student activists from Scholarism and Hong Kong Federation of Students (HKFS) emerged as the leaders in the Occupy protests. They posted the slogan \\"self-determination of our fate\\" outside the government headquarters. Right-wing localists, many of whom criticised the occupation plan before, participated in the protests and advocated a more \\"militant\\" approach as opposed to the strict principles of non-violence advocated by the three promoters of Occupy Central and the student activists. They gathered at the Mong Kok site, as opposed to the main site in Admiralty which was led by the HKFS. They blamed the HKFS leadership for failure of the protest. = 2019‚Äì20 protests = Post-occupy localist movements After the Occupy movement, several organisations named \\"Umbrella organisations\\" by the media were set up, in which many of them carried certain degree of localist discourses, notably Youngspiration and Hong Kong Indigenous. Youngspiration took part in the 2015 District Council election with many other newcoming \\"Umbrella soldiers\\" and eventually won one seat out of nine candidates. Hong Kong Indigenous is notable for its protest style, in which it calls for a \\"militant\\" approach with \\"some kind of clash\\", as opposed to pan-democrats' \\"gentle approach\\" of non-violent civil disobedience. The Hong Kong Independence Party was formed in April 2015 advocating an independent Hong Kong within the British Commonwealth. =HKFS disaffiliation campaign= The localists' disaffection toward the HKFS resulted in a great split in the student federation. The localists launched a campaign quitting the HKFS. By the end of 2015, four of the eight student unions consisting the federation, the Hong Kong University Students' Union (HKUSU), the Hong Kong Polytechnic University Students' Union (HKPUSU), the Hong Kong Baptist University Students' Union (HKBUSU) and the City University of Hong Kong Students' Union (CityUSU), broke up with the HKFS. =Anti-parallel trading protests= \\"Liberate Sha Tin\\" with the British Hong Kong flag raised in New Town Plaza during February 2015 The localists including Hong Kong Indigenous and Civic Passion also mobilised on the Internet and launched several \\"Liberate campaigns\\" in districts such as Tuen Mun on 8 February, Sha Tin on 15 February and Yuen Long on 1 March where parallel traders were active. Protesters were not only against the parallel traders, but also the overcrowded environment in Hong Kong caused by the multi-entry permits issued to mainland tourists. They scolded the mainland tourists, aggressively picketed the alleged shoppersand and clashed with the police, in which many of them turned violent. After the third demonstration, the central government said it would restrict Shenzhen residents to one visit a week. =Siu Yau-wai case= In July 2015, localists including Hong Kong Indigenous and Youngspiration marched to the Immigration Department to demand deportation of an undocumented 12-year-old Mainland boy Siu Yau-wai, who lived in Hong Kong for nine years without identification. Siu, whose parents are alive and well in mainland China, stayed with his grandparents after having overstayed his two-way permit nine years ago. Pro-Beijing Federation of Trade Unions lawmaker Chan Yuen-han advised and assisted the boy and his grandmother to obtain a temporary ID and pleaded for compassion from the local community. Some called on the authorities to consider the case on a humanitarian basis and grant Siu permanent citizenship while many others, afraid that the case would open the floodgates to appeals from other illegal immigrants, asked for the boy to be repatriated. The boy later returned to his parents in mainland China. =Mong Kok unrest= Police on Sai Yeung Choi Street South in the morning of 9 February 2016. In February 2016 during the Chinese New Year, Hong Kong Indigenous called for action online to shield the street hawkers, who sold Hong Kong street food in which they saw as part of the Hong Kong culture, from government health department's crackdown. The protest escalated to violent clashes between the police and the protesters. The protesters threw glass bottles, bricks, flower pots and trash bins toward the police and set fires in the streets which the government condemned as riots. The Chinese Foreign Ministry for the first time labelled the involved localists as \\"separatists\\", claiming that \\"the riot [was] plotted mainly by local radical separatist organisation.\\" Hong Kong Indigenous nominated Edward Leung, who would later rise to prominence by his involvement in the Mong Kok clashes and arrest by police, in the 2016 New Territories East by-election. Localist groups and figures who campaigned for Leung included Youngspiration, Civic Passion, Chin Wan and Wong Yuk-man. Leung finished in third place, with 15 per cent of the vote, behind the moderate pan-democrat Civic Party Alvin Yeung with 37 per cent and pro-Beijing DAB's Holden Chow with 34 per cent. Leung claimed localism had gained a foothold as the third most important power in local politics, standing side by side with the pan-democracy and pro-Beijing camps. The better-than-expected result was considered to further boost the localists' morale and their ambition of running in the September general election. =Hong Kong independence= The University of Hong Kong student magazine Undergrad published an article in March 2016 headed ‚ÄúHong Kong Youth‚Äôs Declaration‚Äù arguing for Hong Kong independence on expiry of the Sino-British Joint Declaration in 2047. It demands a democratic government be set up after 2047 and for the public to draw up the Hong Kong constitution. It also denounces the Hong Kong government for becoming a ‚Äúpuppet‚Äù of the Communist Party, ‚Äúweakening‚Äù the city's autonomy. Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying dismissed the claim, stating that ‚ÄúHong Kong has been a part of China since ancient times, and this is a fact that will not change after 2047.‚Äù University of Hong Kong council chairman Arthur Li described the idea of independence as nonsense, saying that ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think any wise person would listen.‚Äù Hong Kong National Party, the first party openly advocates for Hong Kong independence and a Republic of Hong Kong established on 28 March 2016, drew attacks from the Beijing and SAR governments. The State Council's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office issued a statement through the official Xinhua News Agency on 30 March 2016 condemning the party: \\"The action to establish a pro- independence organisation by an extremely small group of people in Hong Kong has harmed the country‚Äôs sovereignty, security, endangered the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong, and the core interests of Hong Kong... It is firmly opposed by all Chinese people, including some seven million Hong Kong people. It is also a serious violation of the country‚Äôs constitution, Hong Kong‚Äôs Basic Law and the relevant existing laws.\\" The Hong Kong government issued a statement after the formation of the party, stating that \\"any suggestion that Hong Kong should be independent or any movement to advocate such 'independence' is against the Basic Law, and will undermine the stability and prosperity of Hong Kong and impair the interest of the general public... The SAR Government will take action according to the law.\\" The Alliance of Resuming British Sovereignty over Hong Kong and Independence is the second political group to advocate a breakaway from China. Established on 26 June 2016, it aims to gain independence as the ultimate goal, but seeks to return to British rule as a transitional phase. It is reported that about a dozen Hong Kong universities displayed large banners calling for the city's independence on China's National Day (October 1) of 2016. Electoral ventures and disqualifications =New Territories East by-election= Election result of Edward Leung by District Council constituency. In the 2015 District Council elections, a couple of localist candidates were elected including Kwong Po-yin of Youngspiration, Wong Chi-ken of Kowloon East Community and nonpartisan Clarisse Yeung. The Legislative Council by-election in New Territories East on 28 February 2016 was a milestone of the localist movements, as it was the first attempt for them to contest for the Legislative Council under localist banner. Youngspiration was initially considering fielding a candidate and called for a primary with the pan-democratic Civic Party. It later dropped out due to the lack of time for holding a primary. Edward Leung of Hong Kong Indigenous received a better-than expected result in the New Territories East by-election in February 2016 by taking more than 66,000 votes and gaining about 15 percent of the total votes. After the election, Leung claimed localism had gained a foothold as the third most important power in local politics, standing side by side with the pan-democracy and pro-Beijing camps. =2016 Legislative Council election= A day after the 2016 New Territories East by-election, three localist groups, Wong Yuk-man's Proletariat Political Institute, Wong Yeung-tat's Civic Passion and Chin Wan's Hong Kong Resurgence Order, announced to run in the September Legislative Council election under the alliance \\"CP‚ÄìPPI‚ÄìHKRO\\". On 10 April 2016. six localist groups Youngspiration, Kowloon East Community, Tin Shui Wai New Force, Cheung Sha Wan Community Establishment Power, Tsz Wan Shan Constructive Power and Tuen Mun Community, formed an electoral alliance under the name \\"ALLinHK\\" planned to field candidates in four of the five geographical constituencies with the agenda to put forward a referendum on Hong Kong's self-determination, while Hong Kong Indigenous and another new pro-independence Hong Kong National Party also stated that they will run in the upcoming election. Demosisto, a left- leaning political party formed by Umbrella Revolution leaders Joshua Wong, Oscar Lai and Nathan Law was also formed on the same day. The political party aimed to field candidates in the upcoming election with the platform of \\"self- determination\\" of Hong Kong future. It allied with activists such as Eddie Chu and Lau Siu-lai. On 14 July 2016, the Electoral Affairs Commission (EAC) announced its plan to require all candidates to sign an additional \\"confirmation form\\" in the nomination to declare their understanding of Hong Kong being an inalienable part of China as stipulated in the Basic Law, in response to many potential localist candidates advocating or promoting Hong Kong independence. Although Civic Passion's Alvin Cheng agreed to sign the confirmation form, other candidates including Hong Kong Indigenous' Edward Leung and Hong Kong National Party's Chan Ho-tin refused to sign. Leung subsequently signed the form the court refused to immediately hear the judicial review. After the end of the nomination period, six localist candidates received emails from the EAC which said their nominations were \\"invalidated\\", which included Chan Ho-tin, Democratic Progressive Party's Yeung Ke-cheong, Nationalist Hong Kong's Nakade Hitsujiko, Conservative Party's Alice Lai Yee-man, Hong Kong Indigenous' Edward Leung and independent Chan Kwok-keung. New Territories East constituency returning officer Cora Ho Lai-sheung rejected Leung's nomination on the basis that she did not trust Leung \\"genuinely changed his previous stance for independence.\\" Despite their localist stance, all five tickets of the CP‚ÄìPPI‚ÄìHKRO alliance and four tickets of the ALLinHK were validated under the Electoral Affairs Commission's (EAC) new election measure. Youngspiration's convenor Baggio Leung who initially intended to run in Hong Kong Island and stood in New Territories West finally submitted his nomination to stand in New Territories East in the wake of the EAC's measure, which he claimed to be a \\"substitute candidate\\" in case Edward Leung was disqualified in the constituency. The localists scored a resounding victory in the election, winning six seats and securing nearly 20 per cent of the vote. Occupy student leader Nathan Law of the Demosisto became the youngest ever candidate to be elected, Polytechnic University lecturer Lau Siu-lai and Eddie Chu, were returned in the geographical constituencies Eddie Chu, a social activist and environmentalist, bagged more than 84,000 votes, the highest votes received in the geographical constituencies, without any party backing in New Territories West. After the election victory, Chu explained his slogan of \\"democratic self-determination\\" was different from the \\"militant\\" localists' slogan of \\"national self-determination\\" as he disagreed with the notion of nationalism. For the \\"militant\\" faction, Baggio Leung, leader of Youngspiration won in New Territories East after his ally, Hong Kong Indigenous' Edward Leung was barred from poll while Yau Wai-ching won last seat in Kowloon West by about 400 votes at the expense of veteran Wong Yuk-man of the Proletariat Political Institute. Wong's ally, Civic Passion leader Wong Yeung-tat also lost in his second bid in Kowloon East. Only Cheng Chung-tai from the electoral alliance won a seat in the New Territories West. =Legco oath-taking controversy= In October 2016, the two Youngspiration legislators Baggio Leung and Yau Wai-ching were sued by the government for their oath- taking. The two claimed that \\"As a member of the Legislative Council, I shall pay earnest efforts in keeping guard over the interests of the Hong Kong nation,\\" displayed a \\"Hong Kong is not China\\" banner, inserted their own words into the oaths and mispronounced \\"People‚Äôs Republic of China\\" as \\"people‚Äôs re- fucking of Chee-na\\" when they took the oath. In November, the spokesman of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office stated that \\"[Beijing] will absolutely neither permit anyone advocating secession in Hong Kong nor allow any pro- independence activists to enter a government institution,\\" after the National People's Congress Standing Committee (NPCSC) interpret the Article 104 of the Basic Law of Hong Kong which aimed to disqualify the two legislators. On 14 July 2017, the court unseated four more pro-democracy legislators, including Demosisto's Nathan Law and Lau Siu-lai who ran their campaign with \\"self- determination\\" slogan.

It has smooth bark, lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of between seven and eleven, creamy white flowers and more or less ribbed, hemispherical fruit.flower buds of subsp. gonianthafruit of subspecies gonianthabark Description Eucalyptus goniantha is a mallee, rarely a tree, that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth, grey to pale brown bark. Young plants and coppice regrowth have leaves that are oblong to egg-shaped or almost round. Adult leaves are lance-shaped, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of seven, nine or eleven on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are oval, creamy yellow, long and wide with a rounded to bluntly beaked operculum. Flowering mainly occurs from November to January and the flowers are creamy white. The fruit is a woody hemispherical to shortened spherical capsule long and wide, strongly or weakly ribbed, with the valves protruding but fragile. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus goniantha was first formally described in 1847 by Nikolai Turczaninow in Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© Imp√©riale des Naturalistes de Moscou. In 1976, Ian Brooker described subspecies goniantha and semiglobosa, but only subsp. goniantha has been accepted by the Australian Plant Census. In 2012, Dean Nicolle described subspecies kynoura and the name has been accepted by the Australian Plant Census. It differs mainly in having strongly ribbed fruit. The specific epithet goniantha is from the Greek gonio-, angled and anthos, flower, referring to the ribbed flower buds and fruit. The epithet kynoura is from the Greek kynouron meaning \\"sea-cliff\\", referring to the habitat of the subspecies. Distribution and habitat Both subspecies of E. goniantha grow in exposed coastal and near-coastal places in thin sandy soil, usually over limestone. Subspecies goniantha is found between Mutton Bird Island and the Flinders Peninsula near Albany, and as far inland as Manypeaks where it intergrades with E. ecostata. Subspecies kynoura is only found at Point Hillier near Denmark. Conservation status Subspecies goniantha is classified as \\"not threatened\\" but subspecies kynoura is classified as \\"Priority Two\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife meaning that it is poorly known and from only one or a few locations.

The oldest portion of the building is a four- room structure designed by Charles L. Thompson and built in 1908. It was enlarged several times, notably by Thompson in 1910 (adding four rooms), and Thomas Harding, Jr. in 1915 (again adding four rooms), and 1952. Harding's addition gave the building its prominent Classical Revival entrance portico. The school property includes two outbuildings that also houses classrooms. The school was originally a segregated facility, serving only white students, but the end of segregation (achieved in Little Rock in the early 1970s) transformed the school into one that served its predominantly black neighborhood. It was closed in 2005. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009.

It was dedicated to Pere d'Art√©s, who was a kind of Chancellor of the Exchequer of the Crown of Aragon, and who was a close friend of him. It has two hundred and one chapters, and it is divided into five treatises. General information This book is a real treatise about angelology, but with several political thoughts. It was maybe the most successful Eiximenis' book, since it was translated into Latin (it is the only Eiximenis' book that was translated into that language), into Spanish, into French, and even into Flemish (maybe it was the only Medieval Catalan book that was translated into that language). Furthermore, one of the French incunable editions was the first printed book in the Swiss city of Geneva.De sant Miquel arc√†ngel. Barcelona. Curial Edicions Catalanes. 1983, p. 7. Introduction, edition and apendixes by Curt Wittlin We could say that this matter should have been treated in Eiximenis' Huit√® (eighth volume) of his encyclopedic project Lo Cresti√†. This book should have dealt with the order of things and creatures according to medieval mentality. This order appears in what he calls \\"strata\\", and he considers that angels are one of these strata, according to the theological Medieval mentality. It appears in the famous Peter Lombard's Four Books of Sentences Quattuor libri sententiarum. The second book deals with angels. Eiximenis confirms that in the 43rd chapter of his Segon del Cresti√† (Second volume of Lo Cresti√†).Segon del Cresti√†. Madrid. BNE. Ms. 1791, ff. 36r-36v. Influence on the city and Kingdom of Valencia Without exaggerating, it can be said that this book had a decisive influence in the spread of the cult and devotion of angels in the city of Valencia and the Kingdom of Valencia. The same year that the Llibre dels √†ngels was written (1392), the Consell General de Val√®ncia (General Council of Valencia. It was the city government authority) agreed on 9 August to decorate the Sala del Consell (Council Hall) with several figures, and one of these was the guardian angel. This cult and devotion was progressing and spreading years later. So in 1411 a service for the guardian angel of Valencia was composed, and it appears in some breviaries of those years. In 1446 in the Cathedral of Valencia the yearly festivity of the guardian angel began to be celebrated, according to a certain ritual.Ivars, Andreu, OFM. \\"El Llibre dels √†ngels de Fr.

It is a shrub with grey foliage, clustered leaves and red, sometimes yellow flowers. The leaf base is twisted so that the leaf surface is usually close to vertical. It only occurs near the border between South Australia and Queensland. Description Eremophila macgillivrayi is an erect shrub growing to a height of which has grey foliage due to most of the above-ground parts being covered with a layer of fine, tangled, greyish hairs. The leaf bases on the branches extend down the branch and the bases are twisted through 90¬∞ so that the leaf surface is more or less vertical. The leaves are crowded near the ends of the branches, narrow lance-shaped to sickle-shaped, have a distinct mid-vein on the lower surface and are mostly long and wide. The leaves are covered with a layer of branched grey hairs. The flowers are borne singly in leaf axils on a hairy stalk usually long. There are 5 hairy, lance-shaped sepals which are mostly long but which enlarge after flowering. The petals are mostly long and are joined at their lower end to form a tube. The petal tube is red, or occasionally yellow, and is hairy on both its inner and outer surfaces. The 4 stamens extend beyond the end of the petal tube. Flowering mainly occurs in July and August and is followed by fruits which are woody, oval-shaped to cone-shaped with a papery covering and are usually long. Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described by botanist John McConnell Black in 1926 and the description was published in Transactions and Proceedings of the Royal Society of South Australia. The specific epithet (macgillivrayi) honours Doctor William David Kerr Macgillivray of Broken Hill who collected the type specimen.  Distribution and habitat Dog bush is only known from the extreme north east of South Australia and the far south west of Queensland where it usually grows on stony flats or near rocky creek beds. There is one record from north western New South Wales. Use in horticulture The silvery-grey foliage of this eremophila make it a useful contrast with green-leaved species in the garden, with its dusky red flowers adding to the display. It can be propagated from cuttings, sometimes with difficulty and grafting onto Myoporum rootstock is often used, especially in southern Australia or when the plant is to be grown in heavier soils. It is a hardy shrub which requires well-drained soil when grown on its own roots and is both drought and frost tolerant.

She is known for helping to establish the Afro-Caribbean women's movement and maintaining that lesbianism is neither an identity, orientation nor sexual preference, but rather a political position. She is one of the most prominent feminist scholars in Latin America and the Caribbean. Early years and education Rosa In√©s Curiel Pichardo was born on 15 March 1963, in Santiago, Dominican Republic, and attended primary school at the Women's Polytechnic Our Lady of Mercy. After graduating, she enrolled at the Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica Madre y Maestra and obtained a bachelor's degree in Social Work. Feminism and racism In the late 1980s, she began working at the Dominican Center for Education Studies in Santo Domingo and co-founded Ce-mujer, a women's NGO and advisory group. At the time, there was a nascent feminist movement in the Dominican Republic, which was more closely tied to Latin American identification than to Afro-Caribbean, despite the fact that the country was predominantly Afro-Dominican. It also was more class-focused, in that the movement looked more at the problems of the middle class. Each NGO operated as an autonomous organization, rather than collectively. Efforts were small grassroots activist organizations addressing the needs of individual communities or groups, but two voices, Curiel and Sergia Galvan began pressing for broader discussions on women's issues which included racism and sexism. It was a challenging discussion in the Dominican Republic where the social lens typically classifies Haitians as black and Dominicans as mestizo or mulatto. Beginning in the early 1990s, it became apparent that collectivism and nesting were effective in combating intersections of discrimination and that by banding together, NGOs might jointly combat racism and misogyny. Curiel joined the board of an organization called Casa por la Identidad de las Mujeres Afro (House of Women with African Identity), which aimed to combat the dual- discrimination faced by Afro-Dominican women. The identity politics that Curiel embraced was counter to the governmental aim of creating a homogeneous society, but one that she felt was pivotal. Without embracing their blackness, racism could always be denied. But by claiming their solidarity in attaining socioeconomic, political and cultural parity the women of Identidad were able to create a collective voice. Soon afterwards, Curiel joined regional organizations such as Afro-latino-American Women and the Afro-Caribbean Network and began planning the Primer Encuentro de Mujeres Negras de Am√©rica Latina y El Caribe (First Meeting of Black Women of Latin America and the Caribbean). The conference, held in Santo Domingo between 19 and 25 July 1992, brought together over 300 participants from 32 countries to discuss how systemic bias has obscured the accomplishments of black women and develop strategies to improve their lives. Lesbianism Curiel soon began to recognize that her lesbianism was another part of the equation. Though there had been lesbians in the Dominican feminist movement, she recognized that their aspirations could not be transformed into political goals without openness. By 1996, her ideas had congealed into what she called \\"feminist lesbianism\\". Curiel's theory sets forth the idea that lesbianism is neither an identity, orientation nor sexual preference, but rather a political position, which strives to counterbalance the heteronormativity of laws, media, religion, and other aspects of society. She argues that heterosexuality has erased women's autonomy and that it is only through reclaiming their non- subservient status and daring to assert that men are not needed for their survival, that women will reclaim their freedom. Curiel continued teaching and organizing conferences in the Dominican Republic until 2001. Move to Mexico Soon thereafter, Curiel moved to Mexico, where she began lecturing at the Universidad Aut√≥noma del Estado de Hidalgo. She was one of the participants in the first lesbian march held in Mexico in 2003. The following year, she went to Europe and was a featured musician at the Teddy Awards in Berlin. While she was there, she met with Jules Falquet from France and Sabine Masson from Switzerland, and they discussed how western feminist theorists and works were shaping feminist discourse. Curiel felt that part of the discussion was missing because Latin American women's voices were not heard in Europe while some European works were not available to Latinas because of language variances. They worked together on a series of articles to bridge this gap in feminist theory. Move to Colombia In 2006, Curiel moved to Colombia, where she began teaching two courses at the National University of Colombia (UNC), one on Racism and Patriarchy, the other on Lesbian Feminism. Continuing her own studies, Curiel earned a master's degree in social anthropology in Bogot√° from UNC in 2010 and began serving as Coordinator of the graduate curriculum for Gender Studies. She has shown interest in decolonial theory, which evaluates not just the ending of colonization, but how entrenched cultural ideas concerning classism, heterosexism and racism can be deconstructed. Among the scholars who have influenced her work are several indigenous women: the Bolivian Julieta Paredes, founder of Mujeres Creando; Yuderkys Espinosa from the Dominican Republic, who evaluates the intersection of feminism and decolonization; Breny Mendoza, who critiques transnational feminism for its failure to provide non-colonizing alternatives; the Guatemalan feminist Aura Cumes, who evaluates patriarchy, colonization, indigenous intersections of feminism; and even male theorists, such as Anibal Quijano. As she became more immersed in indigenous and African theory and culture, Curiel recognized that pre-colonial societies, such and the Inca and Aztec along with those in Kenya, South Africa and others, had differing social constructs centering on community strength, rather than top-down power arrangements. She began moving away from transnational feminism in an attempt to understand the underlying causes of oppression. For Curiel, recognizing that poor black women exist and have faced bias, is not sufficient nor is recognition that they have some commonalities with other women. Those who have privilege have the freedom to question their identity in ways that others do not. Curiel posits that until one examines privilege and what is important to specific groups, one cannot fully understand exploitation. Curiel has lectured throughout Latin America, North America and Europe discussing her various theories. She has been a featured lecturer at many conferences and universities and is considered one of the most prominent Latin American-Caribbean feminist scholars. She has published a wide body of work on N√©gritude and feminist theories.

Archaeological analysis at the site consists of a clay cossoiro, tile fragments, and pottery. The style and technique used during the period correspond to processes employed during the Middle Ages. Architecture The castle is situated in an isolated, rural hilltop covered in oak trees, with difficult access to an area the terminates over the valley of the Mousse River, approximately below. The remains of the rock cliff castle is defended by a line of walls constructed in schist, and held together by clay, with granite corner stones (including cliff stone) that crown the top of the hill. In addition to the first wall of fortification discovered, there are several redoubt along the cliff that may have been associated with a secondary ring of defenses. The structure consisted of a shale/schist rock fortification and likely included a central turret. The central spaces included where a mound of mortared schist stone is located in two sections. Externally, there are a number of rock cavities that sheltered perishable materials (likely wood) and represented the second defensive line. The fortifications are accessible from an alignment of stones acting as steps, which are dug into the rock face.

Drosha consists of two ribonuclease III domains (blue and orange); a double-stranded RNA binding domain (yellow); and a connector/platform domain (gray) containing two bound zinc ion (spheres). From . The Microprocessor complex is a protein complex involved in the early stages of processing microRNA (miRNA) in animal cells. The complex is minimally composed of the ribonuclease enzyme Drosha and the RNA- binding protein DGCR8 (also known as Pasha) and cleaves primary miRNA substrates to pre-miRNA in the cell nucleus. Composition The Microprocessor complex consists minimally of two proteins: Drosha, a ribonuclease III enzyme; and DGCR8, a double-stranded RNA binding protein. (DGCR8 is the name used in mammalian genetics, abbreviated from \\"DiGeorge syndrome critical region 8\\"; the homologous protein in model organisms such as flies and worms is called Pasha, for Partner of Drosha.) The stoichiometry of the minimal complex has been experimentally difficult to determine, but has been determined by biochemical analysis, single-molecule experiments, and X-ray crystallography to be a heterotrimer of two DGCR8 proteins to one Drosha. In addition to the minimal catalytically active Microprocessor components, additional cofactors such as DEAD box RNA helicases and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins may be present in the complex to mediate the activity of Drosha. Some miRNAs are processed by Microprocessor only in the presence of specific cofactors. Function The human exportin-5 protein (red) in complex with Ran-GTP (yellow) and a pre-microRNA (green), showing two-nucleotide overhang recognition element (orange). From . Located in the cell nucleus, the complex cleaves primary miRNA (pri-miRNA), typically at least 1000 nucleotides long, into precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA) molecules of around 70 nucleotides containing a stem-loop or hairpin structure. Pri-miRNA substrates can be derived either from non-coding RNA genes or from introns. In the latter case, there is evidence that the Microprocessor complex interacts with the spliceosome and that the pri-miRNA processing occurs prior to splicing. DGCR8 recognizes the junctions between hairpin structures and single-stranded RNA and serves to orient Drosha to cleave around 11 nucleotides away from the junctions. Microprocessor cleavage of pri-miRNAs typically occurs co-transcriptionally and leaves a characteristic RNase III single-stranded overhang of 2-3 nucleotides, which serves as a recognition element for the transport protein exportin-5. Pre-miRNAs are exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in a RanGTP-dependent manner and are further processed, typically by the endoribonuclease enzyme Dicer. Although the large majority of miRNAs undergo processing by Microprocessor, a small number of exceptions called mirtrons have been described; these are very small introns which, after splicing, have the appropriate size and stem-loop structure to serve as a pre-miRNA. The processing pathways for microRNA and for exogenously derived small interfering RNA converge at the point of Dicer processing and are largely identical downstream. Broadly defined, both pathways constitute RNA interference. Regulation Gene regulation by miRNA is widespread across many genomes ‚Äì by some estimates more than 60% of human protein-coding genes are likely to be regulated by miRNA, though the quality of experimental evidence for miRNA-target interactions is often weak. Because processing by Microprocessor is a major determinant of miRNA abundance, Microprocessor itself is then an important target of regulation. Both Drosha and DGCR8 are subject to regulation by post-translational modifications modulating stability, intracellular localization, and activity levels. Activity against particular substrates may be regulated by additional protein cofactors interacting with the Microprocessor complex. The loop region of the pri-miRNA stem-loop is also a recognition element for regulatory proteins, which may up- or down-regulate Microprocessor processing of the specific miRNAs they target. Microprocessor itself is autoregulated by negative feedback through association with a pri-miRNA-like hairpin structure found in the DGCR8 mRNA, which when cleaved reduces DGCR8 expression. The structure in this case is located in an exon and is unlikely to itself function as miRNA in its own right. Evolution Drosha shares striking structural similarity with the downstream ribonuclease Dicer, suggesting an evolutionary relationship, through Drosha and related enzymes are found only in animals while Dicer relatives are widely distributed, including among protozoans. Both components of Microprocessor are conserved among the vast majority of metazoans with known genomes. Mnemiopsis leidyi, a ctenophore, lacks both Drosha and DGCR8 homologs, as well as recognizable miRNAs, and is the only known metazoan with no detectable genomic evidence of Drosha. In plants, the miRNA biogenesis pathway is somewhat different; neither Drosha nor DGCR8 has a homolog in plant cells, where the first step in miRNA processing is usually executed by a different nuclear ribonuclease, DCL1, a homolog of Dicer. It has been suggested based on phylogenetic analysis that the key components of RNA interference based on exogenous substrates were present in the ancestral eukaryote, likely as an immune mechanism against viruses and transposable elements. Elaboration of this pathway for miRNA-mediated gene regulation is thought to have evolved later.

The enormous support for this association sprung from phenomena which had caused much anxiety among British film makers at the time. Harold Wilson had announced the formation of the Prime Minister's Working Party in the January that year to examine how a British Film Authority might be established with government funds to promote British film production. The American Hollywood presence in the UK appeared to dominate the thinking and the workings of the British Film Producers Association which also did not attract independent film makers as members. As a result, independent talent felt isolated and ostracised, lacking information, contacts and infrastructure. As a result, AIP quickly found over 450 paid members and set up a council of 40, most of whom had never met each other. They included: David Puttnam, Simon Perry, Mike Hodges, Anthony Simmons, Mark Shivas, Ben Lewin, Tom Clarke, Derek Malcolm, Jack Hazan, Rex Pyke, Michael Radford, Jack Gold, John Fletcher, Nick Hart-Williams and Aida Young. The council of 40 chaired by Richard Craven, administered by Melanie Friesen, examined the workings of the National Film Finance Corporation chaired by Sir John Terry and proposed that it set up a National Film Development Fund to support the writing of indigenous screen plays for cinema. In October 1977, AIP began publishing its own monthly magazine called AIP & Co (Editor Nick Pole) which was also circulated to the industry and every member of the House of Commons. In the same year AIP looked at the workings and infrastructure of the existing British film industry in the \\"Report of the All-Industry Committee of The Film Industry 1977\\" chaired by Robert Bolt, which covered all sectors including exhibitors and distributors. The report was the result of 12 sessions which took place between September 1976 and July 1977 which made recommendations to the Prime Ministers Working Party for the proposed British Film Authority.

Very little remains of the original alc√°zar, but the large complex was a residence of lords, dukes and kings for over a millennium.\\"Castillo-Alc√°zar de Segorbe\\" Military Historical Museum of Valencia  History  Arabs from the Baran√≠ family of the Sinhala Confederacy built the first fortress. After the Muslim king of Valencia, Zayd Abu Zayd, converted to Christianity and declared himself an ally and vassal of King James I of Aragon, he ceded the fortress to James in 1229 and became governor general of Valencia on his behalf. The castle became a sanctuary for Zayd Abu Zayd himself when he was killed by Dynamil Zayyan until James captured the castle in 1245, and placed Abu Zayd in command of an army to assist in the retaking of Valencia. The castle had a peak in the 14th and 15th centuries, culminating in the holding of General Courts by King Martin of Aragon, who had made the city his residence. Among the most notable rulers of Segorbe are Do√±a Maria de Luna, Queen of Aragon, wife to King Martin (through whom the Segorban Alc√°zar became a royal residence), and the first Duke of Segorbe, Enrique de Arag√≥n y Pimentel, who was responsible for several improvements to the castle. These included building new quarters, decorating the Our Lady of La Leche chapel with rich ornaments (which are currently in the cathedral museum), adding a hot tub and pool, and adding marble columns. Mart√≠n de Viciana noted that it was \\"very beautiful with many pieces and beautiful and good-styled rooms.\\" In 1784, urban expansion of Segorbe beyond the original medieval fortifications required further construction, and new walls were built. After the works were completed, the new walls had eight gates known as Teruel, Arg√©n, Sope√±a, C√°rrica, Castellnovo, Valencia, la Maza, and Altura.
