The letter (Epistulae X.96) details an account of how Pliny conducted trials of suspected Christians who appeared before him as a result of anonymous accusations and asks for the Emperor's guidance on how they should be treated. Neither Pliny nor Trajan mentions the crime that Christians had committed, except for being a Christian; and other historical sources do not provide a simple answer to what that crime could be, but most likely due to the stubborn refusal of Christians to worship Roman gods; making them appear as objecting to Roman rule. Pliny states that he gives Christians multiple chances to affirm they are innocent and if they refuse three times, they are executed. Pliny states that his investigations have revealed nothing on the Christians' part but harmless practices and \\"depraved, excessive superstition.\\" However, Pliny seems concerned about the rapid spread of this \\"superstition\\"; and views Christian gatherings as a potential starting point for sedition. The letter is the first pagan account to refer to Christianity, providing key information on early Christian beliefs and practices and how these were viewed and dealt with by the Romans.Jesus: Apocalyptic Prophet of the New Millennium by Bart D. Ehrman (Sep 23, 1999) Oxford UP pages 57-59 The letter and Trajan's reply indicate that at the time of its writing there was no systematic and official persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire. There was persecution of Christians before this but only on a local basis. Trajan's reply also offers valuable insight into the relationship between Roman provincial governors and Emperors and indicates that at the time Christians were not sought out or tracked down by imperial orders, and that persecutions could be local and sporadic.  Context and overview  =Background= Location of Bithynia and Pontus within the Roman Empire Pliny the Younger was the governor of Bithynia and Pontus on the Black Sea coast of Anatolia, having arrived there around September 111 as the representative of Emperor Trajan.The Early Christian Church Volume 1 by Philip Carrington (Aug 11, 2011) Cambridge Univ Press page 429 Pliny likely wrote the letters from Amisus before his term ended in January 113. The origin of Christianity in that region is not known, but it has not been associated with Paul the Apostle's travels. Given the reference to Bithynia in the opening of the First Epistle of Peter (which dates to the 60s), Christianity in the region may have had some Petrine associations through Silas.The New American Commentary: 1, 2 Peter, Jude by Thomas R. Schreiner (Sep 1, 2003) page 37 In 111 Bithynia et Pontus was known for being in disorder, and Pliny was selected by Trajan because of his legal training and his past experience. Pagan Rome and the Early Christians by Stephen Benko (1 Jul 1986) pages 5-7 Pliny was familiar with the region, having defended two of their proconsuls for extortion in the Senate, one case being around AD 103.Paul Krestez \\"Pliny, Trojan and the Christians\\" in Hitler und Niedergang der r√∂mischen Welt (Sep 1979) edited by Hildegard Temporini, page 274 However, Pliny had never performed a legal investigation of Christians, and thus consulted Trajan in order to be on solid ground regarding his actions, and saved his letters and Trajan's replies. The way he expressed his lack of familiarity with the procedure may indicate that such prosecutions against Christians had taken place before (namely in Rome), but Pliny had not been involved in them. As governor, Pliny held large influence over all of the residents of his province. This was especially true in the legal treatment of Christians. The Roman legal construct of cognitio extra ordinem afforded governors a large amount of discretion in deciding legal cases. =Persecution of Christians= Prior to the 249 Decius edict which would require all inhabitants of the Roman Empire to sacrifice to the Roman gods, the persecution of Christians was based on local determinations.J. B. Rives, \\"The Decree of Decius and the Religion of Empire\\", The Journal of Roman Studies, Vol. 89, (1999), pp. 135‚Äì154 Timothy Barnes characterizes the situation by stating: \\"Actual persecution‚Ä¶was local, sporadic, almost random\\". During this period, individual governors treated Christians very differently depending on the public and social issues, e.g. Tertullian wrote that no Christian blood was shed in Africa prior to 180. Although it is clear that Pliny executed Christians, neither Pliny nor Trajan mention the crime that Christians had committed, except for being a Christian; and other historical sources do not provide a simple answer to this question.The Power of Sacrifice: Roman and Christian Discourses in Conflict by George Heyman (Nov 2007) pp xii‚Äìix Trajan's response to Pliny makes it clear that being known as a \\"Christian\\" was sufficient for judicial action. Everett Ferguson states that the charges against Christians by Pliny may have been partly based on the \\"secret crimes\\" associated with Christianity, later characterized by Athenagoras as atheism, cannibalistic feasts and incest. The cannibalistic feasts and incest charges were based on misunderstanding of the Eucharistic act and Christians being \\"brothers and sisters\\", even after marriage. However, the charge of atheism related to the failure to worship the state gods, and made Christianity a superstition and not a religion.Backgrounds of Early Christianity by Everett Ferguson (Aug 19, 2003) pages 504-596 George Heyman states that the refusal of Christians to participate in sacrificial rituals that honored the emperor and instead follow their own sacrificial rhetoric and practices conflicted with the Roman forms of social control, making them an undesirable minority. Ferguson states that Pliny viewed the obstinacy (contumacia) of Christians, as as much of a threat to Roman rule and order as the divergence of their beliefs from the Romans; and considered Christian gatherings as a potential starting point for sedition. Letter and response = Pliny's letter to Trajan =  Opening questions  Letters of Pliny the Younger, Paris, 1826 (Click to read) Pliny opens the letter (sections 1‚Äì4) with questions to Trajan concerning trials of Christians brought before him, since he says he has never been present at any trials of Christians. This may indicate that previous trials had taken place and that Pliny was unaware of any existing edicts under Trajan for prosecuting Christians.A. N. Sherwin-White, The Letters of Pliny: A Historical and Social Commentary (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1966), 694. He has three main questions: :* Should any distinction be made by the age of the Christian? Should the very young be treated differently from mature people? :* Does denying being a Christian mean the accused is pardoned? :* Is the ‚Äúname‚Äù of Christianity itself enough to condemn the accused or is it the crimes associated with being a Christian? (Nomen ipsum si flagitiis careat an flagitia cohaerentia nomini puniantur.) A.N. Sherwin-White states that ‚ÄúWhen the practice of a sect was banned ... indictment of the nomen (‚Äúname‚Äù), i.e. of membership of a cult group, sufficed to secure conviction. This looked uncommonly like religious persecution to the victims themselves, but the underlying ground remained the flagitia (\\"shameful acts\\") supposed to be inseparable from the practice of the cult.‚ÄùA. N. Sherwin-White, The Letters of Pliny: A Historical and Social Commentary (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1966), 696.  Trial format  Pliny gives an account of how the trials are conducted and the various verdicts (sections 4‚Äì6). He says he first asks if the accused is a Christian: if they confess that they are, he interrogates them twice more, for a total of three times, threatening them with death if they continue to confirm their beliefs. If they do not recant, then he orders them to be executed, or, if they are Roman citizens, orders them to be taken to Rome. Despite his uncertainty about the offences connected with being Christian, Pliny says that he has no doubt that, whatever the nature of their creed, at least their inflexible obstinacy (obstinatio) and stubbornness, (pertinacia) deserve punishment. This shows that, to the Roman authorities, Christians were being hostile to the government and were openly defying a magistrate who was asking them to abandon an unwanted cult.A. N. Sherwin- White, The Letters of Pliny: A Historical and Social Commentary (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1966), 699. Most notably, the Christians present at these trials Pliny is inquiring about were accused by a privately published anonymous document and not by Pliny nor the empire. There were three categories of accused Pliny mentions with corresponding verdicts. If the accused denied that they had ever been a Christian, then once they had prayed to the Roman gods (in words dictated by Pliny himself), offered incense and wine to images of Trajan and the gods, and cursed Christ ‚Äì which Pliny says true Christians are unable to do ‚Äì they were then discharged. Accused who were at one point Christians but had quit the religion also followed the aforementioned procedure and were let go. Sherwin-White says the procedure was approved by Trajan but it was not a way to \\"compel conformity to the state religion or imperial cult\\", which was a voluntary practice.A. N. Sherwin- White, The Letters of Pliny: A Historical and Social Commentary (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1966), 701. Those who confessed to being Christians three times were executed.  Practices of Christians  Depiction of Christian Eucharistic bread, Catacomb of Callixtus, 3rd century Pliny then details the practices of Christians (sections 7‚Äì10): he says that they meet on a certain day before light where they gather and sing hymns to Christ as to a god. They all bind themselves by oath, \\"not to some crimes\\", says Pliny, as though that is what he would have expected; rather, they pledge not to commit any crimes such as fraud, theft, or adultery, and subsequently share a meal of \\"ordinary and innocent food\\". Pliny says, however, that all of these practices were abandoned by the Christians after Pliny forbade any political associations (hetaeriai or \\"fraternities\\"). These clubs were banned because Trajan saw them as a \\"natural breeding ground for grumbling\\" about both civic life and political affairs. One such instance of a banned club was a firemen's association; likewise, Christianity was seen as a political association that could be potentially harmful to the empire.Robert L. Wilken, The Christians as the Romans Saw Them (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1984), 13. However the Christians seem to have willingly complied with the edict and halted their practices. Pliny adds that he felt it necessary to investigate further by having two female slaves called deaconesses tortured, which was standard procedure in Roman interrogation of slaves, and discovered nothing but \\"depraved, excessive superstition\\" (superstitio). By using this word instead of religio, religion, Pliny is \\"denigrating the Christians' position\\" because it was outside the religious practices of Rome. The apparent abandonment of the pagan temples by Christians was a threat to the pax deorum, the harmony or accord between the divine and humans, and political subversion by new religious groups was feared, which was treated as a potential crime. Pliny ends the letter by saying that Christianity is endangering people of every age and rank and has spread not only through the cities, but also through the rural villages as well (neque tantum ... sed etiam), but that it will be possible to check it. He argues for his procedure to Trajan by saying that the temples and religious festivals, which before had been deserted, are now flourishing again and that there is a rising demand for sacrificial animals once more ‚Äì a dip and rise which A. N. Sherwin-White believes is an exaggeration of the toll Christianity had taken on the traditional cult.A. N. Sherwin-White, The Letters of Pliny: A Historical and Social Commentary (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1966), 710. = Trajan‚Äôs response = Trajan statue, Glyptothek, Munich Trajan‚Äôs short reply to Pliny affirms Pliny‚Äôs overall procedure and gives four orders: # Do not seek out the Christians for trial. # If the accused are found guilty of being Christian, then they must be punished. # If the accused deny they are Christians and show proof that they are not by worshipping the gods, then they must be pardoned. # Anonymous accusations should not be considered. Leonard L. Thompson calls the policy \\"double-edged\\", since, \\"on the one hand, Christians were not hunted down. They were tried only if accusations from local provincials were brought against them. But if accused and convicted, then Christians ... were killed simply for being Christians.\\"Leonard L. Thompson, \\"Ordinary Lives\\", in Reading the Book of Revelation, ed. David L. Barr (Leiden: Brill Academic, 2004), 37. Therefore, Pliny's view of the treatment of Christians was not necessarily persecution but rather that Christians were executed only when they were brought before him at trial and confessed; however, pardons were also given to those who denied such charges. Ste. Croix says the recommended course of action \\"was 'accusatory' and not 'inquisitorial'\\", so that it was never the governors themselves but instead private, local accusers (delatores) who brought forth accusations.G. E. M. Ste. Croix, Christian Persecution, Martyrdom, and Orthodoxy (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006), 120.  Significance  Pliny's letter is the earliest pagan account to refer to early Christians and provides a key description of Roman administrative process and problems. The correspondence between Pliny and Emperor Trajan shows that the Roman Empire, as a government entity, did not at this time \\"seek out\\" Christians for prosecution or persecution. Although Emperor Trajan gave Pliny specific advice about disregarding anonymous accusations, for example, he was deliberate in not establishing any new rules in regard to the Christians. In doing so, Trajan allowed Pliny to try cases according to his discretion. The letter supports the existence of the early Christian Church and its rapid growth and speaks to its belief system. It also provides valuable evidence as to the attitudes of the Roman authorities with regard to early Christianity. Other Roman sources Pliny is one of three key Roman authors who refer to early Christians, the other two being Tacitus and Suetonius.Robert E. Van Voorst Jesus Outside the New Testament: An Introduction to the Ancient Evidence Eerdmans Publishing, 2000. page 69-70 These authors refer to events which take place during the reign of various Roman emperors, Suetonius writing about an expulsion from Rome of Jews because of disturbances instigated by a certain \\"Chrestus\\" during the reign of Claudius (41 to 54), and also punishments by Nero (who reigned from 54 to 68), Tacitus referring to Nero's actions after the Great Fire of Rome in 64 AD, while Pliny writes to Trajan.P.E. Easterling, E. J. Kenney (general editors), The Cambridge History of Latin Literature, page 892 (Cambridge University Press, 1982, reprinted 1996). But the chronological order for the documentation begins with Pliny writing around 111 AD, then Tacitus writing in the Annals around 115/116 AD and then Suetonius writing in the Lives of the Twelve Caesars around 122 AD.Stephen Benko \\"Pagan Criticism of Christianity\\" in Aufstieg und Niedergang der r√∂mischen Welt edited by Hildegard Temporin et al pageChristianity and the Roman Empire: background texts by Ralph Martin Novak 2001 pages 13 and 20 Notes External links * Full translated text of Pliny's letter and Trajan's reply 1st-century Christianity Latin-language writers Latin letter writers Silver Age Latin writers 1st-century Romans 2nd-century Romans Ancient Roman writers and early Christianity ","title":"Pliny the Younger on Christians"},{"id":"29019801","text":"Prisoner of Rio is a 1988 drama film directed by Lech Majewski and starring Steven Berkoff, Paul Freeman and Peter Firth.BFI.org It shows the flight of the Great Train Robber Ronnie Biggs to Brazil and the attempts of Scotland Yard detectives to re-capture him.

Resolution =Observations= The Security Council praised the efforts of the East Timorese government and people in developing institutions for an independent state including infrastructure, public administration, law enforcement and defence capabilities. The work of UNMISET and the progress it had made was also praised in this regard. Furthermore, East Timor had requested a one-year extension of UNMISET, which was also echoed by the Secretary-General Kofi Annan in order for remaining tasks to be performed. The preamble of the resolution also noted that emerging institutions were still in the process of consolidation and that further assistance was required to strengthen the justice and public administration sectors, including the National Police. It also welcomed the good nature of the diplomatic relations between East Timor and Indonesia. =Acts= The mandate of UNMISET was extended for six months, with a view to extending it for a further and final six months until 20 May 2005. Its size was also reduced to include a to 58 civilian advisers, 157 police advisers, 42 military liaison officers, 310 troops and a 125-person International Response Unit. At the same time, its tasks were revised to support public administration, law enforcement and the justice system, and the security and stability of the country. The tasks would consist of an integral human rights part in training and capacity-building carried out by the operation. Meanwhile, the Secretary-General was asked to report on progress on the ground, including the size, tasks and composition of UNMISET, and the tasks and configuration of police and military components of UNMISET.

B. (Roger) Sprague (September 12, 1937 ‚Äì July 28, 2010) was an American Contemporary Realist artist. Biography Sprague was born in Buffalo, New York, and raised in south Arkansas, graduating from El Dorado High School. He attended the University of Oklahoma and graduated with a BA in Fine Arts, with majors in botany, architecture, and finally, in painting. Sprague resided in New York City and worked as booking agent and shipboard companion for United States Lines. He lived for a year on Swan's Island, Maine, where his father's family started life in the U.S. His conviction to make art his life and his living came to fruition in 1975 when he moved to New Mexico, working briefly in Bosque Farms in a plant nursery, then moving to a one-room arrangement in Santa Fe in 1979 where he dedicated his life to his art. In 2010, Patricia Rovzar Gallery said: > R.B. Sprague is driven by his never-ending exploration of scale and light. > Painting in oil on linen the majority of Sprague's work focuses on interior > spaces and the relationships of the objects he places within those spaces. > He defines his compositions with common objects like tables and chairs but > always leaves ample room for the viewer to create their own interpretation. In 1987, R.B. Sprague said in Southwest Art: > I paint what I see, and what attracts me is light and the geometry it > illuminates. When I see light on a surface at a particular moment. I think > it will follow me for the rest of my life. Exhibitions *1995 J. Cacciola Galleries NYC *1994 \\"Realists\\", Jay Fletcher Gallery Santa Fe, NM *1994 J.

Early life Born in Borrodale on the Isle of Skye on 18 September 1844, he was the third son of Angus MacDonald and Mary MacDonald (n√©e Watson). His elder brother was Hugh MacDonald, Bishop of Aberdeen. Angus MacDonald was educated at St Cuthbert's College, Ushaw. Afterwards, he graduated from the University of London with a Bachelor of Arts. Priestly career After his ordination to the priesthood on 7 July 1872, he was first stationed at St Patrick's Church, Anderston, Glasgow, then sent to Arisaig, Inverness-shire to help the aged Father William Mackintosh, at whose death he took charge of that parish. There he laboured among the people he had known from childhood, his knowledge of Gaelic enabling him to instruct and help those and there were a great many of them who neither understood nor spoke English. Episcopal career Just after the Scottish Hierarchy was restored on 15 March 1878, he was appointed the first bishop of the Diocese of Argyll and the Isles by the Holy See on 22 March 1878. He was consecrated to the episcopate by Archbishop Charles Petre Eyre of Glasgow on 23 May 1878, with Bishop James Chadwick of Hexham & Newcastle and Bishop John MacDonald of Aberdeen serving as co- consecrators. He took up his residence in Oban. There he devoted himself to forming his new and scattered diocese, all of which he visited in all seasons and in all kinds of weather. He became a familiar sight on the Highland steamboats, often clad in oilskin and sou'wester. He built churches and schools, and, with his priests, worked incessantly for the glory of God and the increase of the religion to which he and his ancestors had always adhered. After 14 years as Bishop of Argyll and the Isles, he was translated to the Metropolitan see of St Andrews and Edinburgh on 15 July 1892. As archbishop, he continued with the same zeal, humility, gentleness, tact, and firm attention to everything in his new duties as he had had under his old charge.

Munn (September 19, 1894 ‚Äì January 2, 1975) was an eminent figure in the field of American and international library and information science. Recognized by the journal American Libraries as one of \\"100 of the most important leaders we had in the 20th century\\", and described as an \\"administrator, educator, and author ... known for his fairness, clarity, and grace\\", he was also widely known within the profession as \\"the father of the modern library movement in Australia and New Zealand\\".  Early life  Munn was born in Aurora, Illinois to Dr. Walter (a dentist) and Jennie W. Munn. He was raised in Colorado. He began his higher education at Ohio State University where he was a member of Sigma Pi fraternity before transferring to the University of Denver where he received both his bachelor and law degrees in 1916 and 1917, respectively. After a two-year stint with the U.S. Army in France, he received his B.L.S. degree from New York State Library School at Albany in 1921. Thereafter, worked as a librarian at the Seattle Public Library in Washington state and later at the Flint Public Library in Michigan, before finally accepting the position of Director of the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, from 1928‚Äì1964, during which time he also served as Director, then Dean, of the Carnegie Library School of Carnegie Institute of Technology.  Professional career  The highlights of Munn's contributions to his field during his tenure as Director of the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh can be summarized chiefly as the perpetration of the idea of the public library as \\"educational, informational, and cultural\\", the expansion and unification of library services, and his influence in establishing an American-modeled library system and professional librarianship in Australia and New Zealand. = Controversial policy = Munn's view of the library as \\"educational, informational, and cultural\\" sparked controversy. His preference for a high- quality collection over popularly requested materials led to a \\"revised book selection policy that sharply defined and limited the purchase of 'light, recreational fiction' and effectively eliminated the acquisition of books that he categorized as 'shopping bag fiction'.\\" This choice significantly benefited the reputation of the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, but brought into question problematic and complex issues that still affect the field today, e.g., neutrality in acquisitions, the role of the librarian in acquiring popular vs. \\"educational\\" or \\"literary\\" materials, etc. = Expansion and unification of library services = Munn \\"expressed grave concern over the great masses without ready access to public library services\\", reaching out in particular to young people and rural areas through bookmobile services and free borrowing privileges. He was also lauded for his role in the 1956 merger of the Carnegie Free Library of Allegheny and the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh. However, Munn's role in expanding and unifying library services was also not without criticism. One critic of Munn's 1936 pamphlet Conditions and Trends in Education for Librarianship contended that Munn, at that time considered a progressive in the field, essentially was too conservative in his views on limiting advanced technical training for graduate school librarians, making the point that \\"as long as he [Munn] limits library training ... to contemporary library practices and existing library forms, he definitely omits consideration of the non-serviced areas and groups.\\" In future writings, however, Munn seemed to look beyond the historical limitations of the library system into a present and future rapidly changing due to technological innovations. In a 1954 essay, he acknowledged that \\"the large library must have some staff members whose expertness in personnel management, public relations, audio-visual materials and equipment, adult education, and the public school curriculum is far more important than absorption in purely cultural interests.\\" In addition to his revised views on the training and role of librarians, the essay brought into question the role of books and libraries themselves in the lives of the changing public. Indeed, if the following passage were altered to reflect 21st century technology terminology, Munn would seem to be speaking directly to today's librarians: > With entertainment and information available in every man's living room by > the mere turning of a knob, or at the nearest newsstand at modest cost, > there is little incentive for the casual reader to go to a somewhat distant > library for a book. The librarian can no longer win success for his library > by simply providing a stack of readable books. = Work in Australia and New Zealand = In 1934, Munn was commissioned by the Carnegie Corporation of New York to conduct a survey of public libraries in Australia and New Zealand, which he did in conjunction with Ernest Pitt, then Chief Librarian of the Public Library of Victoria. The resulting Munn- Pitt Report had a major impact in Australia. In an article published in the Australian Library Journal evaluating the survey's impact, the author states that \\"the key recommendations of the Munn-Pitt report were easily identified by its lay readers: 1. to establish tax-supported municipal 'free libraries'; and 2. to strengthen and extend librarianship by professionalizing the training and registration of librarians.\\" Munn certainly did his part to assist in the latter recommendation, drafting a number of young Australian professionals to work in American libraries and assisting them however possible. One such librarian recalled Munn in a positive light, saying, \\"Not only did he make places on his staff available, he also took a personal interest in each Australian 'incumbent', ensuring that, at all times, they were treated in the same way as their American colleagues, in such matters as salary and staff activities.\\" The assistance of these predominantly female librarians also brings into focus an uncannily prescient viewpoint that Munn established in an aptly titled Library Journal essay, \\"It Is a Mistake to Recruit Men\\". Just after World War II, there was a great increase in men looking for jobs, and Munn was of the opinion that in the case of jobs in the library field, these men were \\"simply looking for a secure and not too difficult job.\\" Recruiting men into the field, continued Munn, would > operate against the profession, both by filling it with men of mediocre > caliber and by discouraging the entrance of superior women ... Throughout > the predictable future, it is sure to be mainly a woman's occupation. It > should, therefore, be kept attractive to the ablest of women.  Legacy  Munn's tenure at the Carnegie Public Library ended upon his October 1, 1964 retirement. He died in Pittsburgh on January 2, 1975. In recognition of his authorship and outreach and development of services directed at young people, the annual \\"Ralph Munn Creative Writing Contest\\" has been established in his name at the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh.  Honors and accomplishments  In his career, Munn earned a number of honors, including: *Pennsylvania Library Association President, 1930‚Äì31 *American Library Association President, 1939‚Äì40 *Honorary Degree of Doctor of Laws, 1940, University of Pittsburgh *Distinguished Service Award, 1959, Pennsylvania Library Association *Honorary Degree of Doctor of Laws, 1960, Waynesburg College in Pennsylvania *Director Emeritus, 1964, Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh References 1894 births 1975 deaths American librarians Presidents of the American Library Association University of Denver alumni Carnegie Mellon University faculty United States Army personnel American military personnel of World War I People from Pittsburgh People from Aurora, Illinois ","title":"Ralph Munn"},{"id":"29020057","title":"List of Costa Rican submissions for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film"},{"id":"29020069","text":"Facundo Conte (born 25 August 1989) is an Argentinian volleyball player, a member of Argentina men's national volleyball team and Chinese club Shanghai Golden Age.

(born 12 July 1939 in Koblach, Austria) is a Roman Catholic bishop who headed the Territorial Prelature of Xingu from 1981 until 2015. Biography Erwin Kr√§utler was born in Koblach, Austria, on 12 July 1939. As a teenager he was drawn to the Catholic Youth Worker movement and the model offered by French worker priests, as well as the vocation of his uncle, a missionary in Brazil. He was ordained a priest on 3 July 1965 and became a missionary in Brazil later that year and has spent his entire career there. He became a Brazilian citizen in 1978, retaining his Austrian citizenship. On 7 November 1980, Pope John Paul II appointed him coadjutor prelate of Xingu. Upon the resignation of Eurico Kr√§utler, his uncle, he became Prelate of Xingu on 2 September 1981. The prelature encompasses an area the size of Germany; it has 600 Catholic communities served by eighteen priests. Between 1983 and 1991 and again beginning in 2006 he served as President of the Indigenous Missionary Council of the Brazilian Catholic Church. In 1992, when Archbishop Georg Eder of Salzburg cancelled his scheduled speech at the university there, he spoke to an overflow crowd instead at Vienna City Hall at the invitation of the Mayor, Helmut Zilk. In 2004, the German think tank GLOBALART gave him their annual award. In 2010 he received the Right Livelihood Award for his defense of and advocacy for the rights of indigenous peoples. In the 1980s, he helped secure the inclusion of indigenous peoples' rights in the Brazilian constitution. He also plays an important role in opposing the Belo Monte Dam. Opponents of his activism have responded with violence on several occasions. For supporting striking workers in 1983 he was arrested and beaten by military police. An attempted assassination staged as a car accident left him badly injured in 1987. He was given police protections when targeted with death threats for opposing the Belo Monte dam. On 14 April 2014, he met with Pope Francis and provided him with information on Amazonia to his work on the ecology-themed encyclical Laudato si' (2015). He published his memoirs in 2014, Mein Leben f√ºr Amazonien (My Life for Amazonia). He retired at the age of 76 upon the appointment of his successor in Xingu on 23 December 2015. On 8 March 2018, Pope Francis appointed him to the 15-person council responsible for planning the Synod of Bishops for the Pan-Amazon region. On 9 October 2019, the third day of that Synod, Kr√§utler said that thousands of communities in the region \\"do not celebrate the Eucharist except perhaps one, two or three times a year\\", that he and his colleagues did not oppose celibacy but \\"just want these brothers and sisters of ours not to have just a celebration of the word but also the celebration of the Eucharist\\". He expressed his own support for the ordination of women but doubted it had widespread support. He also told reporters he thought than two-thirds of synod participants \\"are in favor of the ordination of married men\\" and that \\"many of the bishops are in favor of the ordination of female deacons\\".

Although his formative years were between 1910 and 1930,Bognar (1996), p17 he remained active in design throughout his life and at the time of his death was responsible for over three hundred completed projects.Bognar (1996), p27 Although his work lacked a distinctive singular styleBognar (1972), p27, he was recognised as a master of the modern interpretation of the sukiya style.Itoh (1996), p68 His work included large public buildings as well as hotels and department stores and he has been recognised as one of Japan's modern masters. Life Dining Room of the Argentina Maru, 1939 After serving two years in a volunteer military corps Murano entered the Department of Electrical Engineering at Waseda University in 1913. In 1915 he transferred to the Architecture Department before graduating in 1918.Bognar (1996), p44 Unlike his contemporaries, he moved from T≈çky≈ç to ≈åsaka and started work at the Kansai office of Setsu Watanabe. Murano spent eleven years at Watanabe's office learning all aspects of design and working on many large projects such as offices, commercial buildings and cultural facilities. In 1920 he was sent to America and Europe to further his knowledge and architectural vocabulary. In 1929 he left Watanabe to start his own office.Bognar (1996), p35, 36 During the Taish≈ç Period when culture in Japan became liberated for the first time from authority, culture became politicised and nationalistic overtones brought modernist architects into conflict with the state. The liberal Murano channelled this conflict into an interest into sukiya architecture which allowed him to balance tradition and modernisation in his work.Bognar (1996), p18 Unlike his contemporary, Antonin Raymond, Murano courted simplicity, concentrating on the high arts like tea ceremony and conceptual elegance.Stewart (2002), p142 & 143 As well producing many sukiya-style buildings, such as the Kasuien Annex to the Miyako Hotel in Kyoto, Murano used the sukiya style to incorporate Japanese tradition with borrowed elements of Western style.Bognar (1996), p36 The emphasis of the sukiya style on surfaces, the juxtaposition of materials and elaborate details can be found in his work, for example, the mother-of-pearl encrusted ceiling of the Nihon Seimei Hibiya Building and Nissei Theatre in T≈çky≈ç.Bognar (1996), p31, 32 In 1949 Murano reorganised his office and entered into partnership with Tiuchi Mori.Bognar (1996), p37 During Murano's trip to Europe in the 1920s he became interested in Nordic architecture. Aspects of Saarinen's and √ñstberg's work such as Stockholm City Hall can be seen in his post-war projects such as the Memorial Cathedral for World Peace (1954), Yonago Public Hall (1958) and the Round Library at Kansai University (1959).Bognar (1996), p38 Some of his later projects introduced angular motifs, circular plans and sensuous curves (like the Tanimura Art Museum in Itoigawa). In others, like the Industrial Bank of Japan, he blurred the boundaries between wall and ground.Bognar (1996), p40 The scope of Murano's work throughout his career covered many styles of architecture. He was influenced by Japanese and Western architecture but did not commit himself to one particular ideology.Bognar (1996), p27 Although the sheer volume of his work led him to be criticised as simply a commercial architect,Bognar (1996), p20 he always gave top priority to the requirements of his clients.Bognar (1996), p29 He was the author of a few publications in his lifetime. These included Staying above style! in 1919 and The Economic Environment of Architecture in 1926. In his 1931 Looking While Moving he riled against Le Corbusier and the Modern Movement and declared that the skyscrapers of Manhattan were the way forward.Bognar (1996), p30, 31 In addition to his works of architecture, Murano designed the first- class lounge and dining rooms for the luxury cruise ships, Argentina Maru and Brazil Maru, both launched in 1939. The ships were sunk during World War II.http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1596685.1596817 retrieved 29 September 2010 In 1973 Murano was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from Waseda University. Docomomo listed five of Murano's buildings in its selection of the 100 most important Japanese modernist buildings. Japanese design magazine Casa Brutus named Murano one of Japan's modern masters in their April 2009 special issue.April 2009, The Seven Modernist Masters, Casa Brutus No109 Morigo Company Tokyo branch This was Murano's debut work after he left Setsu Watanabe's office. Completed in 1931 the Morigo building was a seven storey office building situated in Nihonbashi, Tokyo. The baked salt tiles on the fa√ßade give it a warmer presence to the street than would normally be expected for a building of its size. The regularly spaced windows sit flush to external face of the wall and this along with the curved corner and expressed eaves- line reduce visual clutter and give the building clean lines. In 1960 an eighth floor was added but this has not been detrimental to the overall appearance.Japan Architect (2005), p42 Ube City Public Hall Ube City Public Hall, 1937, main entrance and six free-standing concrete columns To celebrate 40 years in industry, Ube Industries donated this building to the city of Ube in 1937 to commemorate its founder Y≈´saku Watanabe. The complex was designed around a fan shape with the backstage areas at the pinch point of the fan radiating in turn out to the stage, auditorium and entrance plaza. Six free-standing concrete finned columns (three to each side) frame the main entrance and represent each of the six affiliated companies who donated money for the building. Originally the tiles on the three concentric circles of the main fa√ßade had a salt-glazed finish in burnt carmine, but during restoration work in 1994 they were replaced with reductive fired tiles in burnt umber. The exposed concrete columns were also painted at that time.Japan Architect (2005), p55 The interior of the building reveals more decorative details than the volumetric exterior. Massive circular columns support curving spaces that are lit by indirect natural daylight. The reverse-slab construction of the roof was a pioneer of its day and both the acoustics and visibility are recognised as being excellent.Bognar (1996), p54 Memorial Cathedral for World Peace Memorial Cathedral for World Peace, Hiroshima, 1954, by Togo Murano and Masashi Kondo The original Catholic cathedral in this location was destroyed in the atomic bomb explosion in 1945. A design competition was launched in 1947 to find an architect for its replacement. A total of 177 designs were submitted from Japanese architects such as Kenzo Tange and Kunio Maekawa, but no overall winner was declared.Reynolds (2001), p156 Murano ended up doing the design although he was actually one of the jurors. The cathedral is situated between Tange's Peace Memorial Park and JR Hiroshima Station. The volumetric treatment of the design was influenced by Auguste Perret, whereas the inclusion of a circular dome over the sanctuary and small cylindrical chapels on either side of the main volume are echoes of Byzantine architecture.Bognar (1996), p64 The post-and-beam concrete frame with internal panels is reminiscent of traditional Japanese architecture as are the shapes of the windows penetrating the tower. The brick infills in this case were made from earth containing ashes from the atomic bomb and are laid so that their rough surfaces cast shadows across the fa√ßade. Architect Kenji Imai designed the sculptures above the main door. Murano undertook a number of religious projects after this one and converted to Catholicism later in life.Japan Architect (2005), p74 Kasuien, Miyako Hotel Kasuien, Miyako Hotel, Kyoto, 1959 Murano designed this annex to the Miyako Hotel in Kyoto in a sukiya style. The site plan of Kasuien is laid out to enclose a garden and was inspired by Kyoto's Daigo-ji. The annex is set out as a series of pavilions set within the sloped landscape and connected by enclosed walkways. Although the overtone of the design is one of the Sukiya tradition, ordered by the principles of the tea ceremony, Murano grafted onto this his own modern interpretation by the use of materials like steel and concrete as the primary structure.

Biography  Benjam√≠n Arellano F√©lix, who worked closely with his brothers, was one of Mexico's most powerful drug lords and the supplier of one-third of the U.S.'s cocaine. Benjam√≠n had six brothers: * Francisco Rafael Arellano F√©lix (born 24 October 1949) ‚Äì Shot dead by gunmen disguised as clowns at child's party, on 18 October 2013. * Carlos Arellano F√©lix (believed to have been born 20 August 1955) is not currently wanted. * Eduardo Arellano F√©lix (born 11 October 1956) ‚Äì Captured in 2008. * Ram√≥n Arellano F√©lix (born 31 August 1964) ‚Äì Shot dead by police in 2002. * Luis Fernando Arellano F√©lix (believed to have been born 26 January 1966) is not currently wanted. * Francisco Javier Arellano F√©lix (born 11 December 1969) ‚Äì Captured in 2006. He also has four sisters. Two of them, Alicia and Enedina, are most active in the cartel's affairs. Benjam√≠n was first arrested on 18 June 1982, in Downey, California, for receiving 100 kilos of cocaine smuggled through the San Ysidro border. However, he escaped custody. The Arellano F√©lix brothers obtained their first big break in 1989, when they inherited the organization from Miguel √Ångel F√©lix Gallardo, after they showed early promise smuggling consumer electronics over the U.S.‚ÄìMexico border. By 1998, the Arellano brothers had been indicted in the U.S. for drug trafficking, and Ram√≥n had been put on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list. Despite the brothers' audacity, they remained untouchable for 13 years. This was accomplished, in part, with large amounts of cash bribes to Mexican politicians and police commanders, at the cost of an estimated US$1 million per week. Benjam√≠n Arellano tried to clear his name after the 1993 murder of Cardinal Juan Jes√∫s Posadas Ocampo, in which he had been implicated. That high-profile assassination brought international attention to his trafficking organization and, although this forced Benjam√≠n to lie low and adopt false names, he continued to live in casual confidence, apparently unafraid of capture. He had a secret meeting with the Apostolic Nunciature to Mexico, Girolamo Prigione on December 1, 1993. Another of Benjamin's brothers, Francisco, was arrested soon afterward on drug charges, and Benjam√≠n, Ram√≥n, and Javier officially became fugitives. Kingpin Act sanction On 1 June 2000, the United States Department of the Treasury sanctioned Benjam√≠n under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (sometimes referred to simply as the \\"Kingpin Act\\"), for his involvement in drug trafficking, along with eleven other international criminals. The act prohibited U.S. citizens and companies from doing any kind of business activity with him, and virtually froze all his assets in the U.S.  Arrest  The U.S. DEA learned that Benjam√≠n's oldest daughter had a very recognizable and rare facial deformity, and that she was the \\"soft spot\\" in her father's violent life. By tracing her, they found her father. Benjamin was arrested on 9 March 2002 by the Mexican Army in the state of Puebla, Mexico. He had a US $2 million bounty for his arrest. Authorities are not sure where Benjamin's money went, beyond some real estate investments in Tijuana. Mexican officials say it has been invested in U.S. real estate, while their U.S. counterparts say much of it is hidden in cash in Mexico. Benjamin was extradited to the United States in 29 April 2011 to face charges of trafficking cocaine into California. On January 4, 2012 he pleaded guilty to racketeering and conspiracy to launder money, and was sentenced to 25 years in prison on 2 April 2012. Some objects that were confiscated from him during his arrests are on display at the Museo del Enervante in Mexico City. He is currently incarcerated at USP Lee. In popular culture In the 2017 Netflix and Univision series, El Chapo, Carlos Hern√°n Romo plays Benjam√≠n Avenda√±o (a fictionalized portrayal of Benjam√≠n Arellano F√©lix). He is portrayed by Alfonso Dosal in the Netflix series Narcos: Mexico. A 2003 Mexican film, \\"El fin de los Arellano\\" (\\"The End of the Arellanos\\"), featured characters supposedly based on the Arellano brothers; however, its plot bore practically no resemblance to the actual events. The Arellano brothers were allegedly an inspiration for the two secondary characters of \\"the Obreg√≥n brothers\\", featured in the 2000 US film \\"Traffic\\".

McDonough was born September 29, 1892, in Park City, Utah. He was the son of Irish immigrants Bartley and Minnie Power McDonough. Upon graduation from Park City High School, he was hired to teach history and geography in the Park City Schools, and eventually was made principal of the Jefferson School.Park Record, August 30, 1913 A veteran of World War I, McDonough joined the army October 3, 1917, and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the field artillery in September 1918.\\"Commissioned Second Lieutenant McDonough,\\" Park Record, September 6, 1918 He attended Notre Dame University and the University of Utah Law School.

He was married to Mildred Ann Devine by Catholic Archbishop John Joseph Mitty in San Francisco in May, 1932.\\"Utah Judge Weds on Coast\\" Salt Lake Telegram, May 14, 1932  Utah courts  McDonough was a judge in Utah's Third District Court from 1928 to 1938. For six of those years, his fellow justices selected him to serve as presiding judge of the district court. One of the interesting cases before Judge McDonough's court was the 1935 conviction of Secretary of State Milton Welling on the charge of submitting a false salary request. Before sentencing, the Utah Supreme Court intervened; ultimately, Judge McDonough ordered a new trial, and the Secretary of State was acquitted.Park Record, July 5, 1935 In 1938, he called a grand jury to investigate vice protection payoffs in Salt Lake County. McDonough was elected to the Utah Supreme Court in 1938. Like previous justices of the Utah Supreme Court, McDonough was called upon to rule in polygamy prosecutions. In 1950, he was on a three-member panel that dismissed a polygamy prosecution on the grounds that the statute was too vague.Kidnapped from That Land: The Government Raids on the Short Creek Polygamists, Martha Sonntag Bradley, University of Utah Press, 1993 Immigration Over his tenure on Utah‚Äôs bench, Justice McDonough granted thousands of men and women petitions for US citizenship. In 1935, McDonough assured the citizenship of 160 foreign-born class graduates after the requirement of court examination was replaced with earned diplomas. The program encompassed American schools and adult-learning programs within Salt Lake City, as well as the Neighborhood house, Chapman Branch Library and Mexican Mission. In 1950, he was one of 21 distinguished Americans to serve on an awards jury appointed by the Freedom Foundation. The jury selected schools whose programs for teaching citizenship had been outstanding that year. During the onset of WW2, he presided over a mass naturalization and allegiance ceremony which granted nearly 250 men and women US Citizenship. According to the Salt Lake Tribune, Justice McDonough described the heritage of American citizenship as not consisting of material things, which can be enjoyed without citizenship, but as being the privileges of a social organization. He was quoted as stating: > ‚ÄúAmerican government is not a machine without soul or purpose, as are the > philosophies of Hitler and Stalin. May you ever be faithful to your oath, to > the end that your children, too, may enjoy that heritage.‚Äù Gerrymandering and voting rights In Parkinson v. Watson, 291 P.2d 400 (Utah 1955), Utah‚Äôs 1955 Legislative Reapportionment Act was upheld to be constitutional by a 4-1 vote of the State Supreme Court. The establishment reversed a decision by Judge AH Elliot holding the act to be in violation of constitutional provisions requiring representation on a basis of population. Chief Justice McDonough filed the court‚Äôs sole dissent, primarily based on the Utah Legislature‚Äôs use of a double ratio in appropriating the Senate. In McDonough's three-page dissenting opinion he wrote: > \\"The opinion of the court states that a single ratio for each house could be > used in such manner, if the legislature set about to do so, as to result in > grossly disproportionate representation. Of course it could, if the > legislature paid no attention to the concededly basic principle leavening > the whole of Article IX, and this court stood mute. But it requires no > mathematical acumen to demonstrate that the potential of distortion is > infinitely greater if a multiple ratio be used.‚Äù Environment McDonough was a member of the Sierra Club of Salt Lake City, and served as its president in 1944.  National appointments  On December 31, 1945, President Harry S. Truman appointed Judge McDonough, with University of Wisconsin Law Professor Nathan Feinsinger and Missouri Supreme Court Chief Justice James Marsh Douglas, to a presidential fact-finding board, to investigate an ongoing labor dispute in the steel industry in which 700,000 steelworkers threatened to strike. The strike was not averted, but the board's report contributed to the eventual settlement.Bernstein, \\"The Truman Administration and the Steel Strike of 1946,\\" Journal of American History, March 1966; Whitney, \\"President Names Steel Fact Board, Asks Price Study,\\" New York Times, January 1, 1946. \\"National Affairs: Catalytic Agent,\\" Time, Jan. 14, 1946Harry S.

Using the olfactory system as a model that spans multiple levels of space, time and disciplines, his studies have ranged from molecular to behavioral, recognized by an annual lecture at Yale University on \\"integrative neuroscience\\". He is currently professor of neuroscience emeritus at the Yale School of Medicine. Early work His graduate studies in 1963 of the electrophysiology of the olfactory bulb produced one of the first diagrams of a brain microcircuit. Building on this work he collaborated with Wilfrid Rall, just then founding the new field of computational neuroscience, at NIH to construct the first computational models of brain neurons: the mitral and granule cell. This predicted previously unknown dendrodendritic interactions between the mitral and granule cells, subsequently confirmed by electronmicroscopy. These interactions were hypothesized to mediate lateral inhibition in the processing of the sensory input as well as generate oscillatory activity involved in odor processing. The model suggested active properties in the dendrites, which was subsequently confirmed, through which the model accounts for non-topographic interactions throughout the olfactory bulb. This paper was included in the \\"Essays on APS Classic Papers\\" series Segev, I; \\"What do dendrites and their synapses tell the neuron?\\" J. Neurophysiol. 95: 1295‚Äì97\\": \\"But probably the tour de force of Rall‚Äôs works (and perhaps of computational neuroscience in general) is the 1968 paper of Rall and Shepherd in the Journal of Neurophysiology. Unlike most other Rall studies that provided a conceptual framework, this one is different because it really dived into the guts of a specific system, the olfactory bulb.\\" The next problem addressed was how odors are represented in the brain. A collaboration in 1975, using new methods of brain imaging, revealed for the first time that odors are encoded by different spatial activity patterns in the olfactory glomeruli of the olfactory bulb. This showed that the neural basis of smell in vertebrates involves odor representation by glomerular activity patterns (\\"odor images\\") which are then processed by the widely distributed olfactory bulb microcircuits. Among the odor-induced patterns was a focus on a \\"modified glomerular complex\\", the first of a subsystem of \\"necklace glomeruli\\" in the main olfactory bulb that receives specific input from olfactory receptors that respond to odor stimuli through a cyclic GMP second messenger system. Shepherd's lab has used the olfactory bulb as a general model for the integrative actions of neuronal dendrites. This showed that dendrites can contain multiple computational units; backpropagating action potentials in dendrites carry out specific functional operations; and dendritic spines can function as semi-independent input-output units. The lab also provided a basic circuit for olfactory cortex. These and other new principles of neuronal organization were summarized in \\"The Synaptic Organization of the Brain\\" in 1974, which went through 5 editions, with 2743 citations in Google Scholar. New concepts to replace the classical \\"neuron doctrine\\" were hypothesized, and the term \\"microcircuit\\" was introduced for characterizing specific patterns of synaptic interactions in the nervous system. Recent and current studies Shepherd's odor imaging studies were extended by use of high-field functional MRI (7 and 9 Tesla), work started with his longtime colleague Charles Greer and members of the Yale Imaging Center. The lab has introduced viral tracing methods to reveal widely dispersed clusters of granule cells which are hypothesized to be necessary for processing the distributed glomeruli activated by odor stimuli. These experimental data were used to build novel 3D computational models of the distributed mitral and granule cell circuits, to obtain insight into the nature of the processing that underlies smell perception.Migliore M, Shepherd GM; Dendritic action potentials connect distributed dendrodendritic circuits J Comp Neurosci 24(2):207-21. 2007 Nawroth JC, Greer CA What are the sensory \\"primitives\\" that are processed as the basis of smell perception? This fundamenteal problem was attacked by modeling the molecular interactions between odor molecules and the new discovered olfactory receptors. \\"Determinants\\" were identified on the odor molecules that activate specific sites on the receptors to encode the identity of the odor moleculeSinger MS; \\"Analysis of the molecular basis for octanal interactions in the expressed rat I7 olfactory receptor\\" Chemical Senses 25: 155‚Äì65. A new appreciation of the human sense of smell suggested a new focus on retronasal smell, which activates an extensive \\"flavor system\\" in the human brain; this led in 2015 to a new field of \\"neurogastronomy\\", based on his book of that name which has among its goals enhancing understanding of the factors contributing to obesity and other eating disorders. A new society and annual meeting have been formed around this concept called the International Society for Neurogastronomy. The same principles have been applied to wine tasting in Neuroenology These principles are illustrated by animation for Neurogastronomy and Neuroenology . The olfactory bulb projects to the olfactory cortex which projects to the neocortex where smell perception occurs. Early studies with Lewis Haberly of olfactory cortex led to a basic circuit of pyramidal cells with feedback and lateral excitation and inhibition as the basis for higher olfactory processing. Current studies with paleontologist Timothy Rowe suggest that during evolution this basic three layer microcircuit combined with reptilian dorsal cortex to form the neocortex. His lab was among the original group that founded the field of neuroinformatics, with the first funding of the Human Brain Project in 1993. The home site is \\"SenseLab\\", which contains a suite of 9 databases supporting research on olfactory receptors, odor maps, neuronal and dendritic properties, and neuronal and microcircuit models. SenseLab was founded by Shepherd, Perry Miller, founder of the Yale Center for Medical Informatics, and Michael Hines, founder of the widely used modeling program NEURON.

Green (December 8, 1940 ‚Äì March 15, 1994) was an American basketball player. He was a college basketball standout for Colorado State University (CSU) between 1960‚Äì61 and 1962‚Äì63. A , 230 lb center, Green was CSU's first-ever NCAA All-American when he was named to the consensus second team in 1963. He led the Rams in both scoring and rebounding for all three seasons and remains etched in the school's record book for both categories. He scored 1,682 points and grabbed 726 rebounds which remain second- and fifth- all time, respectively, through the 2009‚Äì10 season. Six of the top 13 single game scoring records belong to Green including the top two: 48 points versus Denver and 44 against Regis. Every season that Green suited up for CSU they qualified for a postseason tournament. In his sophomore and junior years, the Rams earned berths into the National Invitation Tournament. They reached the quarterfinals and first round, respectively. During his senior year, the Rams lost in the first round of the 1963 NCAA Tournament to Oklahoma City, 70‚Äì67. For his three-year career, Green averaged 22.1 points and 9.6 rebounds per game. Fear of flying After Green's collegiate career ended and he graduated from CSU in the spring of 1963, the Boston Celtics selected him in the first round (8th overall) of the 1963 NBA Draft. It was a foregone conclusion that he would play a professional sport, as Green was also drafted by the Boston Red Sox of Major League Baseball (MLB) and the Dallas Cowboys of the National Football League (NFL) that year. Green ultimately never played any sport professionally due to an ever-increasing fear of flying. The fear had emerged gradually throughout his college career, and after a rough flight back to CSU from Utah during his senior year he realized how terrified he really was of flying. The Celtics had tried to convince Green to work through his fear during the 1963‚Äì64 preseason. Professional help did not work, and Hall of Fame coach Red Auerbach allowed him to take a train out to St. Louis, Missouri for a preseason game on the condition that Green flew back. When it came time to go home, he could not step on the plane. Green later said, \\"The fear just built to the point where I couldn't take it anymore. I made up my mind: I wouldn't do it. Auerbach told me to go work on it [the fear] and come back later.\\" Green quit the Celtics right before the regular season began and never returned to attempt professional basketball (or any other professional sport), knowing that in order to play he would have to get over his fear of flying, which was something he could not do. Later life Realizing that any future as a professional athlete was out of the question, Green earned a master's degree from Brooklyn College. He taught in several New York City public schools afterward, and then in 1971 became the principal of Jordan L. Mott School in the South Bronx. The school, an extremely dangerous and under- performing one, greatly turned around with Green's direction. He enacted stringent rules that made students earn certain grades and reach specified numbers of \\"class points\\" to be able to even attend the school's basketball games, let alone play in them. Green also created an atmosphere of intellectual competition whereby different classes within each grade would compete against one another‚Äîliterally sitting desk-to-desk‚Äîand earn points for their class based on the outcomes. He would then post the school's weekly updated class and grade rankings in the hallways, which the students would intently follow. His methods, although unconventional, worked, and even though Jordan L. Mott School was pulling its students from two of the poorest performing elementary schools in New York City, most students were in the top 11% of all city public schools in terms of their reading level by the time they left Mott (after 8th grade). He had earned myriad awards honoring his school's success. Bill Green died on March 15, 1994, at age 53.

The reasons for his banishment are uncertain.Green, 2005, xxiv. Ovid's exile is related by the poet himself, and also in brief references to the event by Pliny the Elder and Statius. At the time, Tomis was a remote town on the edge of the civilised world; it was loosely under the authority of the Kingdom of Thrace (a satellite state of Rome), and was superficially Hellenized. According to Ovid, none of its citizens spoke Latin, which as an educated Roman he found trying. Ovid wrote that the cause of his exile was carmen et error: \\"a poem and an error\\", probably the Ars Amatoria and a personal indiscretion or mistake.OCD (2007), Publius Ovidius Naso (Ovid). John Richards (ed.), Oxford University Press, Oxford. The council of the city of Rome revoked his exile in December 2017, so he would be able to freely return. Ovid was one of the most prolific poets of his time, and before being banished had already composed his most famous poems ‚Äì Heroides, Amores, Ars Amatoria, Remedia Amoris, Medicamina Faciei Femineae, his lost tragedy Medea, the ambitious Metamorphoses and the Fasti. The latter two works were left, respectively, without a final revision and only half finished. In exile, the poet continued producing works that survive today: Ibis, Tristia, Epistulae ex Ponto, and possibly several other, minor poems. These works consist of letters to friends and enemies, and also depict the poet's treatment by the Scythians ‚Äì particularly the Getae, a nomadic people related to the Dacians or Thracians. Ovid's poems in exile have been seen as of fundamental importance for the study of Roman aristocracy under Augustus and Tiberius, furnishing \\"precious pieces of information about events and persons\\".Syme, 1978, p.37.Gaertner, 2007, p.10. his work continued to serve as a literary influence on Latin writers who also experienced exile, from Seneca to Boethius. It was also a central point of reference for mediaeval imaginings of exile, as it was for Romantic portrayals of misunderstood genius. In modern times, classicists have questioned whether the exile was merely a farce, a misrepresentation by Ovid, or a rhetorical and literary device.Gaertner, 2007, p. 155.Green, 2005, xiv. Background At the age of 50, Ovid, the most famous poet of his timeMirmont, 1905, pp. 1‚Äì28 was banished from Rome to the remote town of Tomis on the Black Sea. This happened to Ovid in the year 8 AD by the exclusive intervention of the Emperor Augustus, without the participation of the Senate or of any Roman judge,See Trist. II, 131‚Äì132. and was the ruin of his ambitious hopes. J. M. W. Turner, Ovid Banished from Rome, 1838 Ovid wrote later that the reason for his exile was carmen et error ‚Äì \\"a poem and a mistake\\",Ovid, Tristia 2.207 claiming that what he did was nothing illegal, but nevertheless worse than murder,Ovid, Epistulae ex Ponto 2.9.72 more harmful than poetry.Ovid, Epistulae ex Ponto 3.3.72Norwood, Frances, \\"The Riddle of Ovid's Relegatio\\", Classical Philology (1963) p. 158 The poems of his Tristia, however, are full of declarations that it was not a crime, just a mistake caused by stupidity,Ovid, Tristia 3.6.35 that it was done without premeditation,Ovid, Tristia 4.4.43‚Äì4 and that the mistake's nature was that Ovid has seen something.Ovid, Tristia 2.1.103 He repeatedly says that the emperor must realize that, because he has only exiled the poet without putting him to death, confiscating his possessions or depriving him of Roman citizenship.Ovid, Tristia 4.4.45‚Äì6, 5.2.55‚Äì6, 5.11.15‚Äì18 Causes of the exile The carmen to which Ovid referred has been identified as Ars Amatoria (The Art of Love), written some seven years before his exile,Ovid, Tristia 2.1.245‚Äì50 although Ovid expresses surprise that only he has been exiled for such a reason, though many others also wrote obscene verse,Ovid, Tristia 2.1.495 ff. seemingly with the emperor's approval.Ovid, Tristia 2.1.509‚Äì14 Scholars have argued that Ovid's real crime was \\"l√®se-majest√©\\".Fr√§nkel, 1945, pp. 111‚Äì12. Augustus was presenting himself as the restorer of Roman public morality and could not fail to punish an author of such standing who represented himself in the Ars amatoria as a promoter of adultery in defiance of the Emperor.V√°zquez, 1992, p. 10. Tomis/Constan»õa Speculations about the nature of Ovid's \\"mistake\\" have differed over the centuries. They have included: * sexual: ** Ovid had discovered that Augustus had committed incest with his own daughter, Julia the Elder, or with his granddaughter Julia the Younger; ** Ovid had engaged in adultery with these ladies himself or had been witness to their adultery with someone else. * political: ** Ovid had frequented circles that politically opposed the emperor, such as that of Lucius Aemilius Paullus, who conspired with others to restore the right of imperial succession to Agrippa Postumus, grandson of Augustus. In such a case, objection to Ars Amatoria was a mere pretext, concealing the real cause of Ovid's condemnation, considering the time that had elapsed between the publication of this work and the sentence of Augustus.Montero, 2002, p. 10. To support this view, some authors note that the \\"Art of Love\\" was no more indecent than many publications by Propertius, Tibullus and Horace circulating freely at that time. Proponents also believe that, foreseeing the consequences of the themes of his first poems, Ovid had already changed his artistic focus and written works with less sexual themes, such as Metamorphoses, with the deification of Julius Caesar and the glorification of Augustus, and the Fasti, which are dedicated to Roman festivals of his time.Green, 2005, p. xxii. Another political suggestion has been that Ovid was an intellectual objector against authoritarianism.Vulikh, 1968, pp. 370‚Äì82. =Falsehood thesis= Poetic fiction A more recent thesis has been that Ovid's exile was not real.Sim√≥n, Rodr√≠guez, 2004, and Verdi√®re, 1992, p. 163. lists an extensive bibliography. Early in the 20th century, J. J. Hartman argued that Ovid never left Rome for exile, and that all of his works referring to it are an imaginative and humorous fiction. This theory was debated during the 1930s, especially by certain Dutch authors.Holleman, 1985, p. 48.Hofmann, 1987, p. 23. In 1951, a similar theory was proposed by O. Janssen.O. Janssen, 1951, pp. 77‚Äì105. In a 1985 article, A.D. Fitton Brown also argued that Ovid's exile was fictional. The reasons advanced by Brown are basically: #That, except for doubtful passages in Pliny the Elder and Statius, no other historian mentioned it until the beginning of the 5th century.Brown, 1985, pp. 20‚Äì21. #That Ovid's descriptions of Tomis were already available to him in Roman authors. #That the poet was already adept at projecting a persona separate from his personal life.Brown, 1985, pp. 19‚Äì22. Brown's hypothesis opened a debate over accuracy of the ancient poets when dealing with historical facts. Roman poets themselves wrote about this gap between biography and invention.Allen, 1950, pp. 145-60. Modern authors suggest that Ovid's treatment of Augustus in Tristia, chiefly as a character and only secondarily as the addressee, are a reminder that these letters are literature first and foremost, and that one cannot assume that they were intended to obtain an actual recall.Smith, 1997, p. 192. Ovid seems rather to be inventing a poetic fiction. Fasti and Ibis Orthodox scholars, however, are opposed to such hypotheses.Claassen, 1987, pp. 31‚Äì47. One of their main arguments is that Ovid would not have let his Fasti remain unfinished, since the poem was meant to seal his consecration as imperial poet. Nevertheless, although this work gives the clearest testimony of support of Augustan ideals, it has also been commented that the passage 3.371‚Äì80 of the Fasti is evidence of resistance to the Augustan succession.Fantham, 1998, p. 42. Traditionally, it is argued that in the circumstances of being far from Rome, Ovid had no access to libraries and thus might have been forced to abandon his poem about the Roman calendar, of which only the first six books (January through June) exist. In addition both the Metamorphoses and Fasti seem to lack evidence of a final revision,Mora, 2002, pp. 99‚Äì117. as Ovid himself claims in the Tristia.Tristia 1, 7, 14. Moreover, parts of these two poems may have been rewritten by him in Tomis, while Heroides 16‚Äì21 may have been entirely composed during his exile.B√∂mer, 1969‚Äì86, vol. 1, pp. 488‚Äì9 (with further literature). However, this hypothesis of a lack of scholarly documentation in Tomis does not seem able to stand when one considers the development of a poem so far-fetched as Ibis, with its encyclopedic cargo of Alexandrian mythological knowledge.See, for example, the detailed discussion of the elegies Tr. 1.1 and 3.1, raised by Mora, 2002, p. 107. Other authors believe that the enemy in Ibis is not a real person.Housman, 1972, 1040. There is, in any case, another explanation for the abandonment of writing the Fasti. B. R. Nagle suggests the possibility that Ovid conceived the idea of writing this work as early as 8 BC when Augustus, the new Pontifex Maximus, corrected the defects resulting from the introduction of the Julian calendar. Nagle also argues that political motivations may have caused the poet to link the work with the year 4 AD, when Tiberius was adopted by Augustus and therefore implicitly named his successor. Ovid may then have lost his enthusiasm for the Julian dynasty and transferred his support to the lineage of Claudius, leaving unfinished the poem he was meditating.Nagle, 1980, pp. 19‚Äì20 =Works= Ovid made banishment the subject of his last three major works of poetry: the Ibis, a \\"venomous attack on an unnamed enemy\\", and the two collections of literary epistles, Tristia and Epistulae ex Ponto. The Ibis, an elegiac curse poem attacking an adversary at home, was written during the journey to his place of exile, although it has been argued that this work was \\"literary rather than personal\\".Kenney, 1982, p. 454. In fact, Callimachus had already written a poem with the same title attacking Apollonius of Rhodes.Taplin, 2000, p. 437. Caelius Rhodiginus (Antiq. Lect. xiii. 1) says, on the authority of Caecilius Minutianus Apuleius, that the enemy was Marcus Valerius Messalla Corvinus.Cited by Smith, 1849, p. 73. The five books of the elegiac Tristia are dated to 9‚Äì12 AD, during the first four years of Ovid's banishment.Smith, 1849, p. 72. They are a series of poems expressing the poet's despair in exile and advocating his return to Rome. Its advocacy of his literary worth perhaps goes too far when compared to that of Augustus's favourite, Virgil, particularly with his magnum opus the Aeneid.Tris., 2, 532‚Äì536. The tenth elegy of the fourth book is valuable because it contains many particulars of Ovid's life. The Epistulae ex Ponto, a series of letters in verse explicitly addressed to various people in Rome, asking them to help effect Ovid's return, are thought to be his last compositions. The first three books were published in 13 AD, and the fourth book later, between 14 and 16 AD. Some of these compositions were addressed to Ovid's friends, to his wife, and to the Emperor himself: \\"Where‚Äôs the joy in stabbing your steel into my dead flesh?/ There‚Äôs no place left where I can be dealt fresh wounds.\\"XVI.51‚Äì2 According to Pliny the Elder, Ovid wrote another poem about fishing while in exile. A fragmentary poem still exists, traditionally attributed to Ovid, called Halieutica, about the \\"rules for fishing in rocky, sandy or open waters, distinguishing the kinds of fish which haunt each\\",Ellis, 2008, p. 87. possibly written with information from local fishermen. However, the real authorship of this work is much debated and Ovid's is denied or doubted by some scholars.Denied by Wilkinson, 1955, p. 363.Toohey, 1996, p. 195.Luce, Falkner, 1989, p. 210.Horster, Reitz, 2005, p. 20. =Literary assessment= In his works from exile, principally the Tristia and the Epistulae, Ovid tried to do three things that he hoped would help convince the emperor to end his exile: *Create pity for himself, through his descriptions of the hazards and harsh conditions in Tomis. Ovid portrayed himself as old, sick and away from his family and the pleasures of Rome; *Defend his cause, by referring repeatedly to the attitude that led to his exile as stupid, but without any malicious intent, and by referring to his offense as an 'error'; *Compliment the emperor, either directly (by praising the emperor's good qualities), or indirectly, by praising the emperor's family, or the successes of the emperor's campaigns.Montero, 2002, p. 14. Much has been written suggesting that what Ovid wrote during this period is entirely different from his earlier works. According to Ovid himself, his exile ruined his former poetic genius.See Tris. 1.1.45‚Äì8, 3.14.33, 5.12.21‚Äì2, Pont. 1.5.3‚Äì8, 3.4.1 1, 4.2.15, 4.8.65‚Äì6.

At least in autumn the side paid European efforts, winning only once in Sundays following cup games. As 1987 begins, UEFA draw coupled Tirol Innsbruck to the side for quarter-finals. First leg ended up in a 0‚Äì0 after a match poor of goal opportunities. Torino came to retour challenge in a crisis trend, missing league win from 5 games and goals from 554'. A cold ground, in Austria, hosted the match. Torino stood up at opponent's attacks, finishing the first half without scoring or conceding. As second round started, Tirol went on 1‚Äì0 after a quarter: a corner kick originated the goal. With 10 minutes left, Austrian side came to double. Referee was about to blow the end when Francini scored for Torino. The same defender came close to equalizer, but a foul on him was not punished with a penalty (probably because he hit the ball before falling down).

He also ran for mayor of Rio de Janeiro in 1996. Pinheiro was born in Rio de Janeiro, then capital of Brazil, and started his political life as a student leader at the Pedro II College, the most important college in the country. He was president of the student board and was arrested for his political activism. In 1964, when the military instored their dictatorship, Pinheiro was admitted to Law School at the State University of Guanabara (currently UERJ). There, he joined the MR-8, then the most important urban guerrilla in Brazil, and connected to the Communist Party of Brazil. Again he was elected as chair of the student board (Centro Acad√™mico Luiz Carpenter). After the urban guerrilla was defeated, in the early 1970s, Pinheiro changed allegiance to the Brazilian Community Party, which always condemned the armed struggle. In 1976, hired by the Banco do Brasil, he brought his Communist advocacy into the labor union of bank employees. In 1978, he was elected chairman of the union of bank workers of Rio de Janeiro, and became a union boss at the same time that Lula was heading the metalworkers in S√£o Paulo. He was elected to the Central Committee of the Party in 1982. In 1986, he ran for Congress for PCB, but wasn't elected. The next year, he led the party into joining the CUT union federation, which was allied with Lula and his newly founded Worker's Party. In 1989, then secretary-general of the party, Roberto Freire, ran for president of Brazil and Pinheiro supported him. Eventually, they both supported Lula in the run- off. In the early 1990s, after the fall of the Iron Curtain, the PCB held a congress in which Freire and a group of Central Committee veterans had approved the self dissolution of the party. In January 1992, the remnants of PCB formed the People's Socialist Party (PPS), which increasingly moved rightwards in the political spectrum. Pinheiro then led a group of non- revisionist Communist who re-founded the PCB as a new, yet minor party, in late 1992. In 2000 and 2004, Ivan Pinheiro ran for city counselor, but was not elected. During the presidential elections of 2002, Pinheiro and the PCB supported Lula, who was elected president of Brazil. At the 13th Congress of the PCB, in 2005, in Belo Horizonte, Ivan Pinheiro was elected secretary- general, and the party broke up with Lula. They also abandoned the goal of reunification with the PCdoB. In 2006, the PCB supported Helo√≠sa Helena for president and Pinheiro ran for congress once more, but again wasn't elected.

The territory is close to key shipping lanes and rich fishing grounds, and there may be oil reserves in the area.\\"Q&A;: China-Japan islands row\\" BBC News 11 September 2012 Japan argues that it surveyed the islands in the late 19th century and found them to be terra nullius (Latin: land belonging to no one); subsequently, China acquiesced to Japanese sovereignty until the 1970s. The PRC and the ROC argue that documentary evidence prior to the First Sino- Japanese War indicates Chinese possession and that the territory is accordingly a Japanese seizure that should be returned as the rest of Imperial Japan's conquests were returned in 1945. The islands are included within the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan, meaning that a defense of the islands by Japan would require the United States to come to Japan's aid. In September 2012, the Japanese government purchased three of the disputed islands from their private owner, prompting large-scale protests in China. As of early February 2013, the situation has been regarded as \\"the most serious for Sino-Japanese relations in the post-war period in terms of the risk of militarised conflict.\\" On 23 November 2013, the PRC set up the \\"East China Sea Air Defense Identification Zone\\" which includes the Senkaku Islands, and announced that it would require all aircraft entering the zone to file a flight plan and submit radio frequency or transponder information. Islands The Senkaku Islands are located in the East China Sea between Japan, the People's Republic of China, and the Republic of China (Taiwan). The archipelago contains five uninhabited islands and three barren rocks, ranging in size from 800 m2 to 4.32 km2. Fishing rights The issue of sovereignty has been carefully circumvented in bilateral fishing agreements. In the 1997 fishing agreement, the Senkaku Islands were officially excluded from China's exclusive economic zone, but in a letter of intent Japan explained that Japan would not prevent Chinese boats from fishing there. Some Chinese sources have subsequently argued that this letter constitutes a waiver of Japan's claim to exclusive fishing rights.„Äê‰ΩêËó§ÂÑ™„ÅÆÁúºÂÖâÁ¥ôËÉå„Äë1997Âπ¥11Êúà11Êó•‰ªò„ÅÆÂ∞èÊ∏ïÊõ∏Á∞°„Åå„ÅÇ„Çã„Åü„ÇÅÊó•Êú¨ÊîøÂ∫ú„ÅØÂ∞ñÈñ£Ë´∏Â≥∂Âë®Ëæ∫„ÅÆ‰∏≠ÂõΩÊºÅËàπ„ÇíÂèñ„ÇäÁ∑†„Åæ„Çã„Åì„Å®„Åå„Åß„Åç„Å™„ÅÑÔºàÁúºÂÖâÁ¥ôËÉåÔºâ ‚Äì BLOGOSÔºà„Éñ„É≠„Ç¥„ÇπÔºâ .

Territorial dispute =Beginnings= Workers at a bonito fisheries factory on Uotsurishima in the Senkaku Islands around 1910. Following the Meiji Restoration, the Japanese government formally annexed what was known as the Ryukyu Kingdom as Okinawa Prefecture in 1879. The Senkaku Islands, which lay between the Ryukyu Kingdom and the Qing empire, became the Sino-Japanese boundary for the first time. In 1885, the Japanese Governor of Okinawa Prefecture, Nishimura Sutezo, petitioned the Meiji government, asking that it take formal control of the islands. However, Inoue Kaoru, the Japanese Minister of Foreign Affairs, commented that the islands lay near to the border area with the Qing empire and that they had been given Chinese names. He also cited an article in a Chinese newspaper that had previously claimed that Japan was occupying islands off China's coast. Inoue was concerned that if Japan proceeded to erect a landmark stating its claim to the islands, it would make the Qing empire suspicious. Following Inoue's advice, Yamagata Aritomo, the Minister of the Interior, turned down the request to incorporate the islands, insisting that this matter should not be \\"revealed to the news media\\". On 14 January 1895, during the First Sino-Japanese War, Japan incorporated the islands under the administration of Okinawa, stating that it had conducted surveys since 1884 and that the islands were terra nullius, with there being no evidence to suggest that they had been under the Qing empire's control. After China lost the war, both countries signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in April 1895 that stipulated, among other things, that China would cede to Japan \\"the island of Formosa together with all islands appertaining or belonging to said island of Formosa (Taiwan)\\",[Article II{b}], Treaty of Shimonoseki but yet the treaty does not clearly define the geographical limits of the island of Formosa and the islands appertaining or belonging to Formosa ceded to Japan. The treaty was superseded in 1945 by the Treaty of San Francisco, which was signed between Japan and part of the Allied Powers in 1951 after Japan lost the Second World War. In the treaty of San Francisco, Japan explicitly relinquished the control of Taiwan/Formosa together with all islands appertaining or belonging to it. There is a disagreement between the Japanese, PRC and ROC governments as to whether the islands are implied to be part of the \\"islands appertaining or belonging to said island of Formosa\\" in the Treaty of Shimonoseki. Mainland China and Taiwan both dispute the Japanese claim by citing Yamagata Aritomo's reasons and decisions to turn down the request to incorporate the islands in 1885. Both PRC and ROC asserted sovereignty over the islands.Durdin, Tillman. \\"Peking Claims Disputed Oil-Rich Isles,\\" The New York Times. 6 December 1970. Japan points out that the islands were placed under the administration of the United States of America as part of the Ryukyu Islands, in accordance with Article III of the said treaty and China expressed no objection to the status of the Islands being under the administration of the United States under Article III of the San Francisco Peace Treaty. The Japanese government points out that \\"the Treaty of Shimonoseki does not clearly define the geographical limits of the island of Formosa and the islands appertaining or belonging to Formosa ceded to Japan by the Qing Dynasty of China, nothing in the negotiation history (or otherwise) supports the interpretation that the Senkaku Islands are included in the island of Formosa and the islands appertaining or belonging to it in Article 2b of the Treaty,\\" and had \\"incorporated the Senkaku Islands into Okinawa Prefecture before the treaty was signed.\\" In 1972, the United States ended its occupation of Okinawa and the Ryukyu Island chain, which included the Senkaku Islands.Durdins, Tillman. \\"Okinawa Islands Returned by U.S. to Japanese Rule; Agnew, in Tokyo, Declares 'Last Major Issue' of the Pacific War Is Resolved U.S. Returns Okinawa to Japanese Rule,\\" The New York Times. 15 May 1972. See also, Reversion to Japan of the Ryukyu and Daito Islands, official text Korean academic Lee Seokwoo notes that \\"The significance of subsequent acts and behaviour of the interested parties is dependent upon the determination of the applicable critical date, which is defined as 'the date by reference to which a territorial dispute must be deemed to have crystallized,' since the outcome of this dispute will be fundamentally different depending on whether the critical date is January 1895, as claimed by Chinese side, when Japan incorporated Senkaku Islands into Japanese territory, or February 1971 in the case of Taiwan, or December 1971 in the case of China, when Japan made known its official standpoint with the signing of the Okinawa Reversion Treaty, as claimed by Japan.\\" He concluded \\"... Accordingly, and having regard to the various factual and legal issues explored above, one is inclined to conclude that Japan has a stronger claim to the disputed islands. In other words, the critical date in this case should be February 1971 (in the case of Taiwan) and December 1971 (in the case of China), as claimed by Japan. This is the more so that historical evidence relating to territorial disputes does not have its own value as history alone, but should be evaluated within the framework of international law on territorial acquisition and loss.\\" =People's Republic of China and Republic of China positions=  Pre-1970s position  Prior to the 1970s, neither the PRC nor ROC government make any official statements disputing or claiming the sovereignty of the Senkaku Islands. Several maps, newspaper articles, and government documents from both countries after 1945 refer to the islands by their Japanese name, while some even explicitly recognize their status as Japanese territory. It was only the early 1970s that Chinese documents began to name them collectively as the Diaoyu Islands, and as Chinese territory. The People's Daily, the organ of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), referred to the Senkaku Islands by the Japanese name \\"Senkaku Shot≈ç\\" and described the islands were a part of (then) U.S.-occupied Ryukyu Islands.

The passages leave no doubt that Beijing regarded the Senkaku Islands as part of the Ryukyu Islands as of 1950. There are many official maps published by both Chinas after 1945 that support they did not recognize their sovereignty over the islands and they recognized the islands as Japanese territory. PRC has been cracking down on erroneous maps in both print and digital forms and government agencies have handled 1,800 cases involving map irregularities and confiscated 750,000 maps since 2005. The National Administration of Surveying, Mapping and Geoinformation said \\"as China is involved in several disputes with neighboring countries, it is vital to raise public awareness of the country's due territory.\\" The Washington Times states that this is a classified PRC government map from 1969 and that it lists the Senkaku islands as Japanese name \\"Senkaku Gunt≈ç\\". :*An atlas made by the Chinese State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping (‰∏≠ÂõΩÂõΩÂÆ∂ÊµãÁªòÊÄªÂ±Ä) in 1969 apparently referred to the overall group of islands as the Japanese name \\"Senkaku Gunt≈ç\\" (Â∞ñÈñ£Áæ§Â≥∂).

In 1972, immediately after the Executive Yuan of the ROC announced that the islands belonged to Yilan County of Taiwan Province in December 1971, the description was revised and the points were extended to the Senkaku Islands: \\"the easternmost point of Taiwan is Taish≈ç-jima and the northernmost point is Kuba- jima.\\" :*The Grand Atlas of the World Vol. 1 (‰∏ñÁïåÂú∞ÂúñÈõÜÁ¨¨‰∏ÄÂÜä Êù±‰∫ûË´∏Âúã) published in October 1965 by the National Defense Research Academy (ÂúãÈò≤Á†îÁ©∂Èô¢) and the China Geological Research Institute of Taiwan records the Diaoyu Islands with Japanese names: Uotsuri-shima (Diaoyu Islands), Taishojima (Chiwei Island), and Senkaku Gunto in the \\"Map of the Ryukyu Islands\\". Taiwan and the Senkaku Gunto were clearly divided by a national border. The revised version in 1971, \\"Senkaku Gunto\\" was changed to the \\"Tiaoyutai Islets\\".

Both the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the Republic of China (ROC) respectively separately claim sovereignty based on arguments that include the following points: # Discovery and early recording in maps and travelogues.On the sovereignty of Diaoyu Islands (ËÆ∫ÈíìÈ±ºÂ≤õ‰∏ªÊùÉÁöÑÂΩíÂ±û), Fujian Education Department # The islands being China's frontier off-shore defence against wokou (Japanese pirates) during the Ming and Qing dynasties (1368‚Äì1911). # A Chinese map of Asia, as well as the Sangoku Ts≈´ran Zusetsu map compiled by Japanese cartographer Hayashi Shihei\\" \\" in the 18th century, showing the islands as a part of China. # Japan taking control of the islands in 1895 at the same time as the First Sino-Japanese War was happening.

Retrieved 24 February 2007. One of the islands, Chihweiyu, marked the boundary of the Ryukyu Islands. This is viewed by the PRC and ROC as meaning that these islands did not belong to the Ryukyu Islands. Qing dynasty in 1820, with provinces in yellow, military governorates and protectorates in light yellow, tributary states in orange. The First Sino-Japanese War broke out in 1894 and after the Qing dynasty of China lost the war, both countries signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki on 17 April 1895. In Article 2(b) the Treaty stated that \\"the island of Formosa, together with all islands appertaining or belonging to the said island of Formosa\\" should be ceded to Japan. Although the Treaty did not specifically name every ceded island, the PRC and ROC argue that Japan did not include the islands as part of Okinawa Prefecture prior to 1894, and that the eventual inclusion occurred only as a consequence of China's cession of Taiwan and the Pescadores to Japan after the Sino-Japanese War. The Japanese government argues that the islands were not ceded by this treaty. In 1884, issues relating to the islands had been officially discussed by the Japanese Minister of Foreign Affairs Inoue Kaoru and the Minister of the Interior Yamagata Aritomo before incorporating them in 1895. shortly before Japan's victory in the Sino-Japanese War. It is also claimed that Japanese references to these islands did not appear in governmental documents before 1884. The PRC and ROC governments claim that during negotiations with China over the Ryukyu Islands after the First Sino-Japanese War, the islands were not mentioned at all in a partition plan suggested by US ex-President Ulysses S. Grant. The lease of the islands in 1896 and subsequent purchase in 1930 by the Koga family were merely domestic arrangements made by the Japanese government which had no bearing on the legal status of the islands. According to PRC, Kuomintang leader Chiang Kai-shek failed to protest American decisions with regard to the disposition of the islands because he depended on the US for support. In April 2012, Taiwan declined an invitation from the PRC to work together to resolve the territorial dispute with Japan. Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Minister Lai Shin-yuan said, \\"The ROC and Mainland China will not deal with the [Tiaoyutai Islands] disputes together. Mainland China said the two sides should solve these issues together, but that is not the approach we are taking because [Taiwan and Mainland China] already have sovereignty disputes. We insist on our sovereignty.\\"Radio Taiwan International, \\"Taipei Declines Beijing's Invitation To Solve Disputed Territory Issues Together\\", 26 April 2012, [wire service report]. Regarding Japan's argument about the 1953 People's Daily, Jin Canrong, a professor at Renmin University of China thinks that the article, which is anonymous, implies that Ryukyu Islands should be a sovereign state, also independent from Japan. Other Chinese commentators, including a government research institution run by a retired People's Armed Police general, extend the Chinese claim to the entire Ryukyu chain, including Okinawa. In June 2013, The New York Times described the Chinese campaign \\"to question Japanese rule of [Okinawa and the Ryukyu] islands\\" as \\"semiofficial\\", noting that \\"almost all the voices in China pressing the Okinawa issue are affiliated in some way with the government.\\"Jane Perlez, Sentiment Builds in China to Press Claim for Okinawa The New York Times 13 June 2013 =Japanese position= The stance given by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is that the Senkaku Islands are clearly an inherent territory of Japan, in light of historical facts and based upon international law, and the Senkaku Islands are under the valid control of Japan. They also state \\"there exists no issue of territorial sovereignty to be resolved concerning the Senkaku Islands.\\" The following points are given: # The islands had been uninhabited and showed no trace of having been under the control of China prior to 1895. # The islands were neither part of Taiwan nor part of the Pescadores Islands, which were ceded to Japan by the Qing Dynasty of China in Article II of the May 1895 Treaty of Shimonoseki, thus were not later renounced by Japan under Article II of the San Francisco Peace Treaty.Satoru Sato, Press Secretary, Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Letter to the Editor: Clarifying the Senkaku Islands Dispute The Wall Street Journal, 21 September 2010 # A resident of Okinawa Prefecture who had been engaging in activities such as fishery around the Senkaku Islands since around 1884 made an application for the lease of the islands, and approval was granted by the Meiji Government in 1896. After this approval, he sent a total of 248 workers to those islands and ran the following businesses: constructing piers, collecting bird feathers, manufacturing dried bonito, collecting coral, raising cattle, manufacturing canned goods and collecting mineral phosphate guano (bird manure for fuel use). The fact that the Meiji Government gave approval concerning the use of the Senkaku Islands to an individual, who in turn was able to openly run these businesses mentioned above based on the approval, demonstrates Japan's valid control over the Islands. # Though the islands were controlled by the United States as an occupying power between 1945 and 1972, Japan has since 1972 exercised administration over the islands. # Japanese allege that Taiwan and China only started claiming ownership of the islands in 1971, following a May 1969 United Nations report that a large oil and gas reserve may exist under the seabed near the islands. :* The examples of Japanese valid control after the reversion to Japan of the administrative rights over Okinawa including the Senkaku Islands are as follows: ::# Patrol and law enforcement. (e.g. law enforcement on illegal fishing by foreign fishing boats) ::# Levying taxes on the owners of the Islands under private ownership. (in Kuba Island.) ::# Management as state-owned land (in Taisho Island, Uotsuri Island, etc.) ::# As for Kuba Island and Taisho Island, the Government of Japan has offered them to the United States since 1972 as facilities/districts in Japan under the Japan-U.S. Status of Forces Agreement. ::# Researches by the Central Government and the Government of Okinawa Prefecture (e.g. Utilization and development research by Okinawa Development Agency (construction of temporary heliport, etc.) (1979), Fishery research by the Okinawa Prefecture (1981), Research on albatrosses commissioned by the Environment Agency (1994).). After the Meiji Restoration, the Japanese government surveyed the islands in 1885, which found that the islands were terra nullius and that there was no evidence to suggest that they had ever been under Chinese control. At the time of this survey, however, Yamagata Aritomo, the minister of interior of the Meiji government, took a cautious approach and put off the request to incorporate the islands. The Government of Japan made a Cabinet Decision on 14 January 1895, to erect markers on the islands to formally incorporate the Senkaku Islands into the territory of Japan through the surveys conducted by the Government of Japan, it was confirmed that the Senkaku Islands had been not only uninhabited but also showed no trace of having been under the control of the Qing Dynasty of China. Japan claims that neither China nor Ryukyu had recognized sovereignty over the uninhabited islands. Therefore, they claim that Chinese documents only prove that Kumejima, the first inhabited island reached by the Chinese, belonged to Okinawa. Kentaro Serita (ËäπÁî∞ ÂÅ•Â§™ÈÉé) of Kobe University points out that the official history book of the Ming Dynasty compiled during the Qing Dynasty, called the History of Ming (ÊòéÂè≤), describes Taiwan in its \\"Biographies of Foreign Countries\\" (Â§ñÂõΩÂàó‰º†) section. Thus, China did not control the Senkaku Islands or Taiwan during the Ming Dynasty. A record in August 1617 of Ming Shilu, the annals of Ming dynasty emperors, shows that China did not control the Senkaku Islands. According to the record, the head of the Chinese coast guardÊµ∑ÈÅìÂâØ‰Ωø [Haidao fu shi] mentioned the names of islands, including one on the eastern edge of the Dongyin, Lienchiang, about 40 kilometers off the Chinese mainland, that was controlled by the MingÁöÜÊòØÊàëÈñ¢Èñ©ÈñÄ and said the ocean beyond the islands was free for China and any other nation to navigate.Ê≠§Â§ñÊ∫üÊ∏§ËèØÂ§∑ÊâÄÂÖ± The Senkaku Islands are about 330 kilometers from the Chinese coast. This contradicts Beijing's claim that China have controlled Senkaku Islands since the Ming dynasty about 600 years ago and underlines Japan's position that they are an inherent part of this country's territory. An expert in international law, says \\"We know the Ming had effective control only of the coastal area from other historical sources. What is remarkable about this finding is that a Chinese official made a clear statement along these lines to a Japanese envoy. This proves the Senkaku Islands were not controlled by the Ming.\\" After a number of Chinese were rescued from a shipwreck in 1920, an official letter authored by the Chinese Consul Feng Mien (ÂÜØÂÜï/È¶ÆÂÜï) in Nagasaki on behalf of the Republic of China (‰∏≠ËèØÊ∞ëÂúã) on 20 May 1921, made reference to \\"Senkaku Islands, Yaeyama District, Okinawa Prefecture, the Empire of Japan\\". The letter is on exhibition at Yaeyama museum. During a private visit 9 years after stepping down from office, former President of Republic of China, Lee Teng-hui, once said that the islands are part of Okinawa. During the 2012 China anti-Japanese demonstrations, on 13 September 2012, Lee remarked, \\"The Senkaku Islands, no matter whether in the past, for now or in the future, certainly belong to Japan.\\" In 2002, he also stated, \\"The Senkaku Islands are the territory of Japan.\\" =United States's position= On 25 December 1953, U.S. Civil Administration of the Ryukyus Proclamation 27 (USCAR 27) set geographical boundaries of the Ryukyu Islands that included the Senkaku Islands. Moreover, during U.S. administration of the islands, the U.S. Navy built firing ranges on them and paid annual rent of $11,000 to Jinji Koga, son of the first Japanese settler of the islands. During the San Francisco Peace Treaty discussions, John Foster Dulles, chief U.S. delegate to the peace conference, set forth the concept that Japan had \\"residual sovereignty\\" over the Ryukyu Islands. According to an official analysis prepared by the U.S. Army, \\"residual Sovereignty\\" meant that \\"the United States will not transfer its sovereign powers over the Ryukyu Islands to any nation other than Japan.\\" In June 1957, President Eisenhower confirmed this at the U.S.-Japan summit meeting, telling Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi that \\"residual sovereignty\\" over the Ryukyus meant that \\"the United States would exercise its rights for a period and that the sovereignty would then return to Japan.\\" In March 1962, President John F. Kennedy stated in an Executive Order for the Ryukyus, \\"I recognize the Ryukyus to be a part of the Japanese homeland and look forward to the day when the security interests of the Free World will permit their restoration to full Japanese sovereignty.\\" Since there was no U.S. action to separate the Senkaku Islands from the Ryukyu, these applications of \\"residual sovereignty\\" appeared to include the Senkaku Islands. In the first quarter of 1971 U.S. officials became aware of and successfully opposed a Japanese proposal to set up a weather station on the islands.U.S. killed ‚Äô71 plan for Senkaku Islands weather station Kyodo News 5 September 2013 In May 1971, a report compiled by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency said \\"The Japanese claim to sovereignty over the Senkakus is strong, and the burden of proof of ownership would seem to fall on the Chinese\\". The CIA also said in related documents that any dispute between Japan, China and Taiwan over the islands would not have arisen, had it not been for the discovery around 1968 of potential oil reserves on the nearby continental shelf. On June 7, 1971, President Richard M. Nixon confirmed Japan's \\"residual sovereignty\\" over the Senkaku Islands just before a deal to return Okinawa Prefecture to Japan in a conversation with his national security adviser Henry Kissinger. Kissinger also told Nixon that \\"these (Senkaku) islands stayed with Okinawa\\" when Japan returned Taiwan to China after the end of World War II in 1945. The Nixon Administration removed the Senkakus from its inclusion in the concept of Japanese \\"residual sovereignty\\" in presenting the Okinawa Reversion Treaty to the U.S. Senate for ratification. On 20 October 1971, U.S. Secretary of State William Rogers sent a letter to U.S Congress. In his letter, Acting Assistant Legal Adviser Robert Starr stated \\"The United States believes that a return of administrative rights over those islands to Japan, from which the rights were received, can in no way prejudice any underlying claims. The United States cannot add to the legal rights Japan possessed before it transferred administration of the islands to us, nor can the United States, by giving back what it received, diminish the rights of other claimants... The United States has made no claim to the Senkaku Islands and considers that any conflicting claims to the islands are a matter for resolution by the parties concerned.\\" Several experts have attributed this Nixon Administration policy shift as having been influenced by White House overtures to China during 1971‚Äì1972, culminating in the Nixon visit to China. Top US government officials have declared in 2004, 2010, and September 2012 that as Japan maintains effective administrative control on the islands, the islands fall under the 1960 Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan which requires the US to assist Japan in defending the islands if anyone, including China, attacks or attempts to occupy or control them. On November 29, 2012, the U.S. Senate unanimously approved an amendment to National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 stating the Japanese-administered Senkaku Islands fall under the scope of a Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan and that the U.S. would defend Japan in the event of armed attacks. In May 2013, the U.S. Department of Defense criticized the Chinese territorial claim in a report titled \\"Military and Security Developments Involving the People's Republic of China 2013.\\" On July 30, 2013, the Senate unanimously approved a resolution condemning China's action over the Senkaku Islands. The Resolution titled \\"Senate Resolution 167‚ÄîReaffirming the Strong Support of the United States for the Peaceful Resolution of Territorial, Sovereignty, and Jurisdictional Disputes in the Asia-Pacific Maritime Domains\\", referring to the recent Chinese provocations near the Senkaku Islands, condemns \\"the use of coercion, threats, or force by naval, maritime security, or fishing vessels and military or civilian aircraft in the South China Sea and the East China Sea to assert disputed maritime or territorial claims or alter the status quo.\\" In 2014, United States Pacific Commander Samuel J. Locklear said that he did not have sufficient resources to carry out a successful amphibious warfare campaign should the dispute lead to a war. In April 2014, the United States will begin Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk patrols of the seas around the islands. On 23‚Äì25 April 2014, U.S. President Barack Obama made a state visit to Japan and held a summit meeting with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. President Obama repeated that the commitments of Article 5 of Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan covered all territories under Japan's administration, including the Senkaku Islands, in a joint press conference and reiterated in a U.S.-Japan Joint Statement. Barack Obama is the first president of the United States mentioned on Senkaku Islands covered under Article 5 of Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan. =Alternative approaches= When PRC-Japan diplomatic relations were established in 1972, found reasons to set aside this territorial dispute.Miles, Edward L. (1982). According to negotiator Deng Xiaoping, \\"It does not matter if this question is shelved for some time, say, 10 years. Our generation is not wise enough to find common language on this question. Our next generation will certainly be wiser. They will certainly find a solution acceptable to all.\\"MIT faculty web page, M.

Such efforts to develop a cooperative strategy were unsuccessful.Pan, Junwu.

Since 2004, however, several events, including naval encounters, scrambled fighter jets, diplomatic efforts, and massive public protests, have heightened the dispute. =Incidents at or near the islands= ROC Coast Guard vessel and Japan Coast Guard vessel. In 1996 the Hong Kong based activist David Chan Yuk-cheung drowned while attempting to swim to one of the islands. Since 2006, vessels from China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong have entered waters that Japan claims as part of its exclusive economic zone connected with the islands on a number of occasions. In some cases, the incursions have been carried out by Chinese and Taiwanese protesters, such as in 2006 when a group of activists from the Action Committee for Defending the Diaoyu Islands approached the islands; the group was stopped by the Japanese Coast Guard prior to landing.Associated Press, 26 October 2006 \\"Activist ship from Hong Kong briefly enters Japan's waters in protest over islands\\" . International Herald Tribune. In June 2008 activists from Taiwan, accompanied by Chinese Coast Guard vessels, approached within of the main island, from which position they circumnavigated the island in an assertion of sovereignty of the islands. In 2011, a fishing boat carrying some activists navigated to within 23 nautical miles of the islands. Japan sent coast guard vessels to block the ship and a helicopter to monitor its actions, subsequent to which the Coast Guard Agency Keelung office of Taiwan sent five patrol vessels. After a short standoff between the two groups of vessels, the Taiwanese fleet returned to their own territory. In July 2012, Coastguard vessels from Taiwan and Japan collided while the Taiwanese vessel was escorting activists to the area. In August 2012, activists from Hong Kong were able to swim ashore after their boat was stopped by the Japan Coast Guard. The activists were detained and then deported two days later. In January 2013, a boat carrying activists from Taiwan was intercepted by Japanese patrols and diverted from an attempted landing on the islands through the use of water cannons. In addition, a number of incidents have occurred due to the presence of Chinese or Taiwanese fishing vessels in sea zones claimed by Japan. In some cases, these incidents have resulted in a collision between boats. The first major event occurred in 2008, when a Taiwanese fishing boat and a Japanese patrol vessel collided. The passengers were released, but the captain was detained for three days.

On 7 September 2010, a Chinese fishing trawler collided with two Japanese Coast Guard patrol boats in disputed waters near the islands. The collisions occurred after the Japanese Coast Guard ordered the trawler to leave the area. After the collisions, Japanese sailors boarded the Chinese vessel and arrested the captain Zhan Qixiong. Japan held the captain until 24 September. Each country blamed the other for the collision. While Japanese government vessels regularly patrol the ocean surrounding the islands, Japanese civilians have also entered the area. In July 2010, nine Japanese boats fished in the area. A spokesman from Ganbare Nippon, which owned one of the vessels, stated it was done specifically to assert Japanese sovereignty over the islands. In August 2012, Ganbare Nippon organized a group of four vessels carrying Japanese activists travelling to the islands, carrying about 150 Japanese activists. The Japanese government denied the groups the right to land, after which a number swam to shore and raised a Japanese flag. Bouthier, Antoine, \\"Nationalists exult in Senkaku isle landing\\", Japan Times, 20 August 2012, p. 2 On some occasions, ships and planes from various Chinese and Taiwanese government and military agencies have entered the disputed area. In addition to the cases where they escorted fishing and activist vessels as described above, there have been other incursions. In an eight-month period in 2012, over forty maritime incursions and 160 aerial incursions occurred. For example, in July 2012, three Chinese patrol vessels entered the disputed waters around the islands. On 13 December 2012, a Chinese government aircraft entered Japanese-controlled airspace for the first time since records began in 1958, following months of incursions by Chinese surface vessels. The Japan Air Self-Defense Force scrambled eight F-15 fighters and an airborne early warning aircraft in response to the Chinese flight. The Japanese government made a formal diplomatic protest to China. The most direct confrontation to date between the countries' official vessels occurred in September 2012. Seventy five Taiwanese fishing vessels were escorted by ten Taiwanese Coast Guard vessels to the area, and the Taiwanese Coast Guard ships clashed with Japanese Coast Guard ships. Both sides fired water cannons at each other and used LED lights and loudspeakers to announce their respective claims to the islands. Military escalation continued in 2013. The two sides sent fighter airplanes to monitor ships and other planes in the area. In February, Japanese Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera revealed that a Chinese frigate had locked weapons- targeting radar onto a Japanese destroyer and helicopter on two occasions in January. The Chinese Jiangwei II class frigate and the Japanese destroyer were three kilometers apart, and the crew of the latter went to battle stations. The Chinese state media responded that their frigates had been engaged in routine training at the time. In late February 2013, U.S. intelligence detected China moving road-mobile ballistic missiles closer to the coast near the disputed islands, this included DF-16s. In May 2013, a warship flotilla from North Sea Fleet deployed from Qingdao for training exercises western North Pacific Ocean. In October 2013 the Chinese Ministry of Defense responded to reports that if Chinese drones entered what Japan considered its territory Japan might shoot them down by declaring that China would consider such an action an \\"act of war.\\" State- controlled media in China warned that \\"a war looms following Japan's radical provocation\\" while expressing confidence that \\"China's comprehensive military power... is stronger than Japan's.\\"Tokyo‚Äôs incitement incurs dangerous cycle People's Daily 28 October 2013 USN Captain James Fanell has claimed that Mission Action 2013 was a dress rehearsal for a PLA seizure of the islands.

(2006‚Äì2015) =Diplomatic results= The various governments have lodged protests and criticisms of each other in response to the unfolding situation in and around the islands. For example, the Taiwanese government recalled its highest representative to Japan in the wake of the 2008 collision. Similarly, the Chinese government protested the 2012 Ganbare Nippon incident. The 2010 collision incident resulted in a significant increase in tensions between the two countries, both during the event as they argued over the release of the fishing boat crew, and after, as both said they would seek compensation from the other for damages. In 2012, President of Taiwan Ma Ying-Jeou proposed the East China Sea Peace Initiative, which called for the sharing of the region's resources, including the Senkaku Islands, mediated by peaceful negotiations, international law, and international consensus. The proposal received responses from Japanese Minister of Foreign Affairs K≈çichir≈ç Genba, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, and Japanese scholars. =Protests= Demonstration in Shenzhen, China on 17 September 2012 There have been a number of public protests in all three countries, often triggered by the specific incidents noted above. The first major set of protests revolved around the 2010 boat collision, with protests being held in Japan, China, and Taiwan. In 2012, major protests began in August 2012 after reports that the Japanese government was considering purchasing the islands. The protests continued after the formal purchase into the middle of September. At the height of the protests, there were demonstrations in as many as 85 Chinese cities, along with Hong Kong and the United States.CNA, 18 September 2012, ROC, PRC flags fly together at anti-Japan protest in NY , China Post In many cases, these protests included anti-Japanese violence, vandalism, and arson. =Militarization= 250px China decided to implement an \\"Air Defense Identification Zone\\" around the islands and the broader region in order to \\"guard against potential air threats,\\" according to the defence ministry. Japan reacted to the news by calling the move \\"very dangerous.\\" On 23 November 2013, China then sent air force jets, including fighter planes, to carry out a patrol mission. According to CNN, most of the zone was north of the islands. On 26 November 2013, declaring the area international waters and airspace, the United States flew two B-52 bomber aircraft through the zone without incident. A spokesman for the United States military stated that \\"The U.S. military will continue conducting flight operations in the region, including with our allies and partners.... We will not register a flight plan, we will not identify our transponder, our radio frequency and logo.\\" Since the imposition, U.S. B-52 aircraft and South Korean and Japanese military aircraft have violated it. The U.S. also warned its commercial airlines to be cautious about the area. China then sent fighter jets on patrol duty in the area as a \\"defensive measure.\\" According to a 2012 poll jointly conducted by mainland-based Global Times and Taiwan-based China Times, residents of Taiwan differ from their mainland counterparts in terms of willingness to ultimately resort to military means, with 91% of mainland residents saying warfare should not be ruled out versus only 41% on the island.Joe Hung (23 July 2012), Will there be war over the Tiaoyutais? China Post To assist in the intruders detection in Senkaku Islands region, since 28 March 2016, Japan has operated a radar station at Yonaguni island, resulting in a furious Chinese response. = Education = In 2014, the PRC complained about Japanese plans to teach students about ownership of the islands. =Other incidents= *In April 2014, Lieutenant General John Wissler, commander of the US III Marine Expeditionary Force stated that his forces were ready and able to defend the Senkaku Islands if they were attacked by the PRC. China responded in English on the People's Liberation Army (PLA) website, saying that the PLA was able to take and hold the islands at any time and requesting that Wissler, \\"Please learn lessons from your old superiors. Don't be so ready to make threats with forces. Please pay some respect to Chinese armed forces, which defeated your armed forces in the Korean War.\\"Wang Hongguang, (edited by Zhang Tao), \\"PLA Lt.

Japan has promptly summoned a Chinese ambassador in Tokyo with the demand for the warship to leave. This was the first time a Chinese Navy was involved in the dispute. Previous incidents have seen the involvement of the China Coast Guard (see China Coast Guard Senkaku-related incidents)or civilian vessels only. The incident is probably related to the joint China-Russian military sea drill. * 12 August 2016, a Chinese fishing vessel was sunk from Uotsuri island after colliding with Greek freighter \\"Anangel Courage\\" in the wake of the massive Chinese fishing fleet numbering 200‚Äì300 vessels that entered the proximity of the Senkaku Islands on 5 August 2016.

It occurs throughout the east from Ontario to Georgia, and west to Kansas. Recently the insect has also been found in Florida. This insect's most distinguishing feature is the segmented cerci on the male abdomen. The function of these is not known, but they may be used during courtship. Much is unknown about the adults, which are nocturnal and secretive, sometimes found under logs or in malaise traps near streams, or attracted to lights at nighttime. No M. tuber or Meropeid larvae have been identified. The insect is characterized by long wings with many veins and no ocelli. There is a region of interlocking sclerites that holds the jugum and scutellum on the middle thoracic segment together. This may be used to keep the wings together when pushing up through dirt. A similar apparatus is found in cicadas and ground-dwelling beetles, so it may be that the winged adults dig in soil. The flat appearance of the insect suggests that the insect dwells close to the ground in fissures and other small ground openings, as does the lack of ocelli.

In essence, the sisters practice \\"simplicity, hospitality, and prayer that is centered on the Cross of Jesus Christ, the sacred Word of Scripture, and the Holy Eucharist.\\" History This Catholic community of women was founded in 1868 by Father Edward Daems (1826 - 1879)http://www.gbfranciscansisters.org/about/community-founders who came to northeastern Wisconsin to minister to the local Belgian immigrants. Seeing the need for teachers, Father Daems asked two local women ‚Äì Pauline LaPlante ( - 1926) and Christine Rousseau ( - 1900)http://www.gbfranciscansisters.org/about/community-founders ‚Äì to come home from their formation with the Dominican Order in Racine, Wisconsin, (about 150 miles south), to teach and provide medical care to the Belgian residents. Sisters LaPlante and Rousseau accepted Father Daems' request. With the help of Sister Pius Doyle and Mary Van Lanen, a neighboring farm girl, the four women became the religious community's founding members. In 1881, the women were officially recognized as a diocesan community by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Green Bay, Wisconsin, which marked 1868 as an important year in its history, the year when also the Diocese of Green Bay was created from the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milwaukee. With the motherhouse located in rural Green Bay, the Sisters spent their early years primarily teaching the area schoolchildren and farming much of their land in Brown County. As membership grew, the Sisters accepted more teaching requests from parish priests and expanded their religious instruction to the Chapel in Robinsonville, Wisconsin, in 1902. The Chapel, now known as the Shrine of Our Lady of Good Help, is well known to the local population as where the Virgin Mary is reported to have appeared to Sister Adele Brice and instructed Adele to teach the children their Catholic faith.

Frank D'Souza was neither an ICS officer nor a university graduate at the time, but was considered brilliant. During or after WW1 (1910s to 1930s), the British Indian Railways had reduced the number of Europeans from Europe and instead replaced them with resident (domiciled) Europeans, who were sons of railroad men, and Eurasians or Anglo-Indians.

Life Born in Wester Boggs, Enzie, Banffshire in July 1706, he was ordained a priest at the Scots College in Rome on 4 April 1733. During the Jacobite Uprising of 1745, Fr. Grant was operating as the underground missionary priest of Barra, in the Outer Hebrides. According to Bishop John Geddes, \\"Early in the spring of 1746, some ships of war came to the coast of the isle of Barra and landed some men, who threatened they would lay desolate the whole island if the priest was not delivered up to them. Father James Grant, who was missionary then, and afterwards Bishop, being informed of the threats in a safe retreat in which he was in a little island, surrendered himself, and was carried prisoner to Mingarry Castle on the Western coast (i.e. Ardnamurchan) where he was detained for some weeks. He was then conveyed to Inverness, and thrown into the common prison, where there were about forty prisoners in the same room with him. Here he was for several weeks chained by the leg to Mr. MacMahon, an Irish officer in the service of Spain, who had come over to be of use to the Prince. In this situation they could not in the night time turn from one side to the other without the one passing the other. The people of the town, out of humanity, furnished them with some little conveniences, and among other things gave to each a bottle, which they hung out of the window in the morning and got filled with water. But one morning the sentinels accused the prisoners to the visiting officer of having entered into a conspiracy to knock them on the head with bottles, which they had procured for that purpose. Father Grant and the others pleaded the improbability of this ridiculous accusation, but they were not heard, and the bottles were taken away.\\" Charles MacDonald (2011), Moidart: Among the Clanranalds, Birlinn Press. Page 176. Accord to Father Charles MacDonald, \\"Five other priests were shut up in the same prison at about the same time. Three of them belonged to the West coast, viz., Father Alexander Cameron, who was connected with the Lochiel family; Father Alexander Forrester, priest of South Uist; and Father Alan MacDonald. From Inverness they were taken away on board a man-of-war to London; but during the passage, Father Cameron, whose health had been completely shattered during his captivity, died, and was thrown overboard. After a long confinement in London, the survivors were brought before the Duke of Newcastle, who informed them that the Government was disposed to deal leniently in their case, and therefore would sentence them to perpetual banishment from the country, provided they could give bail of ¬£1,000 that they would never return. As this was an absurd proposal, these poor priests having neither friends not money, the Duke compromised the matter by asking them to go bail for each other. They got over to Holland, but most of them came back again.\\" Charles MacDonald (2011), Moidart: Among the Clanranalds, Birlinn Press. Pages 176-177.

It is being studied in disinfection, healing, and cancer. Most of the research is in vitro and in animal models. It uses ionized gas (physical plasma) for medical uses or dental applications . Plasma, often called the fourth state of matter, is an ionized gas containing positive ions and negative ions or electrons, but is approximately charge neutral on the whole. The plasma sources used for plasma medicine are generally low temperature plasmas, and they generate ions, chemically reactive atoms and molecules, and UV-photons. These plasma-generated active species are useful for several bio-medical applications such as sterilization of implants and surgical instruments as well as modifying biomaterial surface properties. Sensitive applications of plasma, like subjecting human body or internal organs to plasma treatment for medical purposes, are also possible. This possibility is being heavily investigated by research groups worldwide under the highly-interdisciplinary research field called 'plasma medicine'.  Plasma sources  Plasma sources used in plasma medicine are typically \\"low temperature\\" plasma sources operated at atmospheric pressure. In this context, low temperature refers to temperatures similar to room temperature, usually slightly above. There is a strict upper limit of 50 ¬∞C when treating tissue to avoid burns. The plasmas are only partially ionized, with less than 1 ppm of the gas being charged species, and the rest composed of neutral gas. = Dielectric-barrier discharges = Dielectric-barrier discharges are a type of plasma source that limits the current using a dielectric that covers one or both electrodes. A conventional DBD device comprises two planar electrodes with at least one of them covered with a dielectric material and the electrodes are separated by a small gap which is called the discharge gap. DBDs are usually driven by high AC voltages with frequencies in the kHz range. In order to use DC and 50/60 Hz power sources investigators developed the Resistive Barrier Discharge (RBD).Laroussi, M., Alexeff, I., Richardson, J. P., and Dyer, F.

The treatment usually takes place in the room air. They are generally powered by several kilovolt biases using either AC or pulsed power supplies. = Atmospheric pressure plasma jets = Atmospheric pressure plasma jets (APPJs) are a collection of plasma sources that use a gas flow to deliver the reactive species generated in the plasma to the tissue or sample. The gas used is usually helium or argon, sometimes with a small amount (< 5%) of O2, H2O or N2 mixed in to increase the production of chemically reactive atoms and molecules. The use of a noble gas keeps temperatures low, and makes it simpler to produce a stable discharge. The gas flow also serves to generate a region where room air is in contact with and diffusing in to the noble gas, which is where much of the reactive species are produced. There is a large variety in jet designs used in experiments. Many APPJs use a dielectric to limit current, just like in a DBD, but not all do. Those that use a dielectric to limit current usually consists of a tube made of quartz or alumina, with a high voltage electrode wrapped around the outside. There can also be a grounded electrode wrapped around the outside of the dielectric tube. Designs that do not use a dielectric to limit the current use a high voltage pin electrode at the center of the quartz tube. These devices all generate ionization waves that begin inside the jet and propagate out to mix with the ambient air. Even though the plasma may look continuous, it is actually a series of ionization waves or \\"plasma bullets\\". This ionization wave may or may not treat the tissue being treated. Direct contact of the plasma with the tissue or sample can result in dramatically larger amounts of reactive species, charged species, and photons being delivered to the sample. One type of design that does not use a dielectric to limit the current is two planar electrodes with a gas flow running between them. In this case, the plasma does not exit the jet, and only the neutral atoms and molecules and photons reach the sample. Most devices of this type produce thin (mm diameter) plasma jets, larger surfaces can be treated simultaneously by joining many such jets or by multielectrode systems. Significantly larger surfaces can be treated than with an individual jet. Further, the distance between the device and the skin is to a certain degree variable, as the skin is not needed as a plasma electrode, significantly simplifying use on the patient. Low temperature plasma jets have been used in various biomedical applications ranging from the inactivation of bacteria to the killing of cancer cells.Laroussi, M. ‚ÄúLow Temperature Plasma Jet for Biomedical Applications: A Review‚Äù, IEEE Trans. Plasma Sci. 43, pp. 703-711, (2015) Applications Plasma medicine can be subdivided into three main fields: # Non-thermal atmospheric-pressure direct plasma for medical therapy # Plasma-assisted modification of bio-relevant surfaces # Plasma-based bio-decontamination and sterilization =Non-thermal atmospheric-pressure plasma= One of challenges is the application of non-thermal plasmas directly on the surface of human body or on internal organs. Whereas for surface modification and biological decontamination both low-pressure and atmospheric pressure plasmas can be used, for direct therapeutic applications only atmospheric pressure plasma sources are applicable. The high reactivity of plasma is a result of different plasma components: electromagnetic radiation (UV/VUV, visible light, IR, high- frequency electromagnetic fields, etc.) on the one hand and ions, electrons and reactive chemical species, primarily radicals, on the other. Besides surgical plasma application like argon plasma coagulation (APC),Zenker M, Argon plasma coagulation, GMS Krankenhaushyg Interdiszip 2008; 3(1):Doc15 (20080311) which is based on high-intensity lethal plasma effects, first and sporadic non-thermal therapeutic plasma applications are documented in literature.Fridman G, Friedman G, Gutsol A, Shekter AB, Vasilets VN, Fridman A, Applied Plasma Medicine, Plasma Process Polym 5:503-533 (2008) However, the basic understanding of mechanisms of plasma effects on different components of living systems is in the early beginning. Especially for the field of direct therapeutic plasma application, a fundamental knowledge of the mechanisms of plasma interaction with living cells and tissue is essential as a scientific basis.  Mechanisms  Though many positive results have been seen in the experiments, it is not clear what the dominant mechanism of action is for any applications in plasma medicine. The plasma treatment generates reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, which include free radicals. These species include O, O3, OH, H2O2, HO2, NO, ONOOH and many others. This increase the oxidative stress on cells, which may explain the selective killing of cancer cells, which are already oxidatively stressed. Additionally, prokaryotic cells may be more sensitive to the oxidative stress than eukaryotic cells, allowing for selective killing of bacteria. It is known that electric fields can influence cell membranes from studies on electroporation. Electric fields on the cells being treated by a plasma jet can be high enough to produce electroporation, which may directly influence the cell behavior, or may simply allow more reactive species to enter the cell. Both physical and chemical properties of plasma are known to induce uptake of nanomaterials in cells. For example, the uptake of 20 nm gold nanoparticles can be stimulated in cancer cells using non-lethal doses of cold plasma. Uptake mechanisms involve both energy dependent endocytosis and energy independent transport across cell membranes . The primary route for accelerated endocytosis of nanoparticles after exposure to cold plasma is a clathrin-dependent membrane repair pathway caused by lipid peroxidation and cell membrane damage . The role of the immune system in plasma medicine has recently become very convincing. It is possible that the reactive species introduced by a plasma recruit a systemic immune response.  * References Plasma physics ","title":"Plasma medicine"},{"id":"29021071","title":"South African Class 33-200"},{"id":"29021106","text":"Arms of Temple of Stowe: Or, an eagle displayed sable Sir Peter Temple, 2nd Baronet (1592‚Äì1653) was an English politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1640 to 1653.

Family Temple was the son of Sir Thomas Temple, 1st Baronet, of Stowe and his wife Hester Sandys, daughter of Miles Sandys.Mark Noble, The lives of the English regicides: Volume 2 He inherited the baronetcy on his father's death in 1637. Temple married firstly Ann Throckmorton, daughter of Sir Arthur Throckmorton of Paulerspury, Northamptonshire. He had two daughters by his first wife; the elder, Anne, survived into old age while the younger, Martha, died as a toddler. He married secondly Christian Leveson daughter of Sir John Leveson and they had several children. the eldest, Frances, married the Earl of Londonderry. Sir Peter's eldest son Richard Temple succeeded to the baronetcy. Sir Peter had a longstanding quarrel with his daughter Anne, who married Thomas Roper, 2nd Roper Viscount Baltinglass, without her father's permission. Anne and her husband sued Sir Peter and his heir, Sir Richard, for her inheritance through her mother, Anne Throckmorton Temple. Public offices In 1634, he served as High Sheriff of Buckinghamshire and was consequently responsible for collecting the controversial ship money in Buckinghamshire. In April 1640, Temple was elected Member of Parliament for Buckingham in the Short Parliament. He was also elected for Buckingham in November 1640 to the Long Parliament. He took the side of the Parliamentarians and fought for them in the Civil War. although his wife, Christian, was a Royalist sympathiser. He was nominated to serve as a judge on the court that tried Charles I, but never attended any sessions. Relationship with father Sir Peter was accused by his father of \\"wasting money in gambling, drinking, and other extravagances\\".Oxford Dictionary of National Biography He believed that his father favoured his younger brother, John, over him. In the 1620s, when his father was planning to sell some land in order to reduce his debts, Sir Peter, who was himself heavily in debt, went to the Court of Chancery to prevent the sale. Eventually, the legal case between father and son was settled in the 1630s by an arbitrator. Sir Thomas was allowed to sell the land, but he had to make a payment to Sir Peter. Peter's father and mother, Sir Thomas Temple and Lady Hester Temple, had already made an agreement with Peter in 1625, whereby they vacated the mansion at Stowe by Buckingham, Buckinghamshire, and left Sir Peter to housekeep there. Peter made considerable changes to the building. From 1637 to 1643 Temple lived at No. 2-3 Tavistock Row, Covent Garden.

The location is home to about 15,000 people of Chinese origin, historically the largest Chinese community in Mexico. However, as of 2012, this number was surpassed by Tijuana's La Mesa District which is home to approximately 15,000 Chinese immigrants and people of Chinese descent. While this number does not compare to other cities worldwide with a prominent Chinese diaspora, early in the 20th century Mexicali was numerically and culturally more Chinese than other immigrant groups. The Chinese arrived to the area as laborers for the Colorado River Land Company, an American enterprise which designed and built an extensive irrigation system in the Valley of Mexicali. Some immigrants came from the United States, often fleeing anti-Chinese policies there, while others sailed directly from China. History Asociaci√≥n China Many of the Chinese laborers who came to the irrigation system stayed on after its completion, congregating in an area of Mexicali today known as Chinesca. During Prohibition in the U.S., many Chinese laborers and farmers came to the town to open bars, restaurants and hotels to cater their American clients, Chinesca eventually housed just about all of the city's casinos and bars, and a tunnel system to connect bordellos and opium dens to Calexico on the U.S. side. Bootleggers also used this route to supply the U.S. with alcohol purchased in Mexico. By 1920, Mexicali's Chinese population outnumbered the Mexican 10,000 to 700.Stacy, Lee. 2003. Mexico and the United States p. 183 A group of 5,000 single Chinese males started the Asociaci√≥n China, a Mexicali's social organization at least partly devoted to finding Chinese wives from overseas, which remains active today. In 1927, a series of Tong wars here and other parts of Northern Mexico erupted over control of gambling and prostitution rings. Mexican alarm over the Chinese organized crime led to the government-encouraged Movimiento Anti-Chino. In the late 1920s, a wave of anti-immigrant sentiment that swept the country and led to the torture and murder of hundreds of Chinese in northern Mexico. However, the Chinese in this city were numerous enough and politically strong enough to protect themselves. thumb|200px|left|Asociaci√≥n Chung Shan de Baja California, which serves as an educational center, art center, and Buddhist temple.

However, in the later half of the 20th century, steady influx of Mexican migrants here diluted the Chinese population, until once again they became a minority. After anti-Chinese sentiment faded, more Chinese arrived here, and it became the Mexican headquarters for the Kuomintang, or the Nationalist Chinese Party and the Anti-Communist League. After events during World War II and the communist revolution in China, a large number of Chinese refugees came to Mexico in the mid-century. Ho Feng-Shan, the Chinese diplomat known as \\"China's Schindler\\" is known to have visited Mexicali. The town was the site of the Taiwan based Republic of China consulate in the 1960s until Mexico withdrew its recognition of the island nation, ending immigration of ethnic Chinese to this area. For a while after 1960, Chinese Mexican community organizations continued to stay strong: at the beginning of the 1960s new Chinese Mexican seminaries continued to open, and in the 1970s a school opened to teach art, Chinese culture, and sports to Chinese Mexicans living in downtown Mexicali.Auy√≥n Gerardo, Eduardo. 2003.

The neighborhood boasts more Chinese restaurants per capita than any other place in Mexico, more than 100 for the whole city, most with Cantonese-style cuisine. Local Chinese associations struggle to preserve the arts and culture of the homeland through the sponsorship of Chinese festivals, calligraphy clubs, and language classes. However, much of Chinese cultural life here has blended with local Mexican and American traditions to create a unique, hybrid culture. Like many Chinese restaurants outside of Asia, cooks here have adapted their native cuisine to local tastes. For example, restaurants here serve their dishes with a small bowl of a sauce that is similar to a steak sauce, common in Northern Mexico. In many of these restaurants, it is not uncommon to see Chinese men wearing stiff straw cowboy hats, meeting over hamburgers and green tea and speaking a mixture of Cantonese and Spanish. Along with burgers and chow mein, many restaurants here also offer shark-fin tacos.

It is one of the few religious sites in Sri Lanka that is venerated by the Buddhists, Hindus, Muslims and the Vedda people. For most of the past millennia, it was a jungle shrine very difficult to access; today it is accessible by an all-weather road. The shrines and the nearby Kiri Vehera are managed by Buddhists, the shrines dedicated to TeyvƒÅ·πâai and Shiva are managed by Hindus and the mosque by Muslims. The shrine has for centuries attracted Tamil Hindus from Sri Lanka and South India who undertook an arduous pilgrimage on foot. Since the latter half of the 20th century, the site has risen dramatically among Sinhalese Buddhists who today constitute majority of the visitors. The cult of Kataragama deviyo has become the most popular amongst the Sinhalese people. A number of legends and myths are associated with the deity and the location, differing by religion, ethnic affiliation and time. These legends are changing with the deity's burgeoning popularity with Buddhists, as the Buddhist ritual specialists and clergy try to accommodate the deity within Buddhist ideals of nontheism. With the change in devotees, the mode of worship and festivals has changed from that of Hindu orientation to one that accommodates Buddhist rituals and theology. It is difficult to reconstruct the factual history of the place and the reason for its popularity amongst Sri Lankans and Indians based on legends and available archeological and literary evidence alone, although the place seems to have a venerable history. The lack of clear historic records and resultant legends and myths fuel the conflict between Buddhists and Hindus as to the ownership and the mode of worship at Kataragama. The priests of the temple are known as Kapuralas and are believed to be descended from Vedda people. Veddas, too, have a claim on the temple, a nearby mountain peak and locality through a number of legends. There is a mosque and a few tombs of Muslim pious men buried nearby. The temple complex is also connected to other similar temples in Eastern Province dedicated to Murugan which are along the path of pilgrimage from Jaffna in the north to Kataragama in the south of the island; Arunagirinathar traversed this pilgrimage route in the 15th century.See map. The vicinity of the temple complex is used for secretive practices of sorcery and cursing peculiar to Sri Lanka. The entire temple complex was declared a holy place by the government of Sri Lanka in the 1950s; since then political leaders have contributed for its maintenance and upkeep. History =Origin theories= There are number of theories as to the origin of the shrine. According to Heinz Bechert and Paul Younger, the mode of veneration and rituals connected with Kataragama deviyo is a survival of indigenous Vedda mode of veneration that preceded the arrival of Buddhist and Indo-Aryan cultural influences from North India in Sri Lanka in the last centuries BCE, although Hindus, Buddhists and even Muslims have tried to co-opt the deity, rituals and the shrine. But according to S. Pathmanathan, the original Kataragama shrine was established as an adjunct guardian deity shrine to Skanda-Kumara within a Buddhist temple complex. This particular shrine then became idealized as the very spot where Valli met Murukan amongst local Tamils and Sinhalese, and Kataragama deviyo subsumed the identity of Skanda-Kumara and became a deity on his own right with rituals and pilgrimage. According to Pathmanathan, it happened after the 13th century CE when Murukan became popular amongst Tamils and before the 15th century CE when the poet Arunagirinathar identified the very location as a sacred spot. The deity among the Veddas is referred as O' Vedda or Oya Vedda, meaning \\"river hunter\\". =Literary evidence= The first literary mention of Kataragama in a context of a sacred place to kandha-Murugan is in its Tamil form Kathirkamam in the 15th-century devotional poems of Arunagirinathar. Tradition claims that he visited the forest shrine when he composed the poems. According to his poems, the deity dwelt on top of a mountain. The first mention of Kataragama deviyo in the form Khattugama, as a guardian deity of Sri Lanka and its Buddhist relics, was in the Pali chronicle of Jinakalamali written during the 16th century in what is today Thailand. () Kataragama village is first mentioned in the historical annals known as Mahavamsa written down in the 5th century CE. It mentions a town named Kajjaragama from which important dignitaries came to receive the sacred Bo sapling sent from Ashoka‚Äôs Mauryan Empire on 288 BCE. (According to Ponnambalam Arunachalam Kajjaragama is derived from K√¢rttikeya Gr√¢ma (\\"City of Kartikeya\\"), shortened to Kajara-gamaSir Ponnambalam Arunachalam The Worship of Muruka or Skanda (The Kataragama God) First published in the Journal of the Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, Vol. XXIX, No. 77, 1924.) =Archeological evidence= The vicinity of the temple has number of ancient ruins and inscriptions. Based on dated inscriptions found, the nearby Kiri Vehera is believed to have been built or renovated around the 1st century BCE. There is an inscription, a votive offering to the Mangala Mahacetiya, apparently the former name of Kiri Vehera on the orders of one Mahadathika Mahanaga, a son of king Tiritara who ruled in 447 CE. There is also an inscription of Dapula I dated to the 7th century CE who built a sanctuary for Buddhist monks, but the inscription does not mention Kataragama by name. Nearby Tissamaharama was a trading town of antiquity by the 2nd century BCE, as indicated by Prakrit and Tamil Brahmi legends in coins and potsherds unearthed on the site. The region was part of the ancient kingdom of Ruhuna which played an important role in the political history of the island. =Role of Kalyangiri Swamy= The medieval phase of the history of the shrine began with the arrival of Kalyanagiri Swamy from North India sometimes during the 16th or 17th century. He identified the very spot of the shrines and their mythic associations with characters and events as expounded in Kanda Puranam. Following his re-establishment of the forest shrine, it again became a place of pilgrimage for Indian and Sri Lankan Hindus. The shrine also attracted local Sinhala Buddhist devotees. The caretakers of the shrines were people of the forest who were of indigenous Vedda or mixed Vedda and Sinhalese lineages. The shrines popularity increased with the veneration of the place by the kings of the Kingdom of Kandy, the last indigenous kingdom before colonial occupation of the island. When Indian indentured workers were brought in after the British occupation in 1815, they too began to participate in the pilgrimage in droves, thus the popularity of the shrine increased amongst all sections of the people. > Legends =Hindu legends= According to Hindus and some Buddhist texts, > the main shrine is dedicated to Kartikeya, known as Murugan in Tamil > sources.

Numerous > legends have sprung about Kataragama deviyo, some of which try to find an > independent origin for Katargamadevio from the Hindu roots of Skanda-Kumara. > =Buddhist legends= One of the Sinhala legends tells that when Skanda- > Kumara moved to Sri Lanka, he asked for refuge from Tamils. The Tamils > refused, and he came to live with the Sinhalese in Kataragama. As a penance > for their refusal, the deity forced Tamils to indulge in body piercing and > fire walking in his annual festival. This legend tries to explain the > location of the shrine as well as the traditional patterns of worship by > Tamils. Another Sinhala legends attests that Kataragama deviyo was the deity > worshiped by Dutugamunu in the 1st century BCE, before his war with Ellalan, > and that Dutugamunu had the shrine erected to Skanda-Kumara at Kataragama > after his victory. This legend has no corroboration in the Mahavamsa, the > historic annals about Dutugamunu. Another Sinhala legend makes Kataragama > deviyo a deification of a Tamil spy sent by Elara to live amongst the > Sinhalese or a Tamil juggler who made the locals deify him after his death. > Yet another legend says that Kataragama deviyo is a deification of the > legendary king Mahasena, who is born as a bodhisattva or Buddha in waiting. > Anthropologists Richard Gombrich and Gananath Obeyesekere were able to > identify new strands of these legends and the originators of these legends > since the 1970s, with the burgeoning popularity of the shrine and its deity > amongst the Sinhala Buddhists. According to the practice of cursing and > sorcery peculiar to Sinhala Buddhists, Kataragama deviyo has his dark side > represented by Getabaru and Kadavara. The current Getabaru shrine is located > in an isolated place near Morawaka. The shrine for Kadavara is in the town > of Kataragama. His power to curse is carried out in secret outside the Main > Kataragama deviyo shrine at a place at the Menik Ganga, where he receives > animal sacrifices. Katagama devio is also directly invoked in sorcery > practices. =Muslim legends= People of Coast Vedda descent taking a > pilgrimage on foot (Pada Yatra) from the town of Muttur in the east of Sri > Lanka to the temple Muslim or Islamic legends about Kataragama are > relatively newer. According to Muslims Kataragama is referred to as al-Khidr > or land of Khidr. A number of Muslim pious and holy men seems to have > migrated from India and settled down in the vicinity.

Historic figures such as Jabbar Ali Sha (died 1872) > and Meer Syed Mohhamed Alisha Bawa (died 1945) also have mausoleums built > over their tombs. =Vedda legends= The Veddas who have kept out of the > mainstream culture of Sri Lanka do not subscribe to Kataragama deviyo as > their deity.

They > propitiate the deity by building a shrine made out of thatched leaves with a > lance or arrow planted in the middle of the structure. They dance around the > shrine with the shaman becoming possessed with the spirits of the dead > ancestors who guide the hunting party in techniques and places to go hunt. > Anthropologist Charles Gabriel Seligman felt that the Kataragama deviyo cult > has taken on some aspects of the Kande Yakka rituals and traditions. A clan > of Veddas who lived near to the shrine was known as Kovil Vanam (Temple > precincts). As a clan they are extinct but were to be found in the eastern > province during the 19th century.

This reflects the similar position held by Murukan amongst > Tamils. =Murukan cult= Murukan is known from Sangam Tamil literature. > The earliest reference to Murukan was as a god who was propitiated to help > in good hunting. He was the primary god of hunter-gatherer people from the > mountainous region of southern Tamil Nadu very much like the Veddas of Sri > Lanka. With the advancement of settled agriculture, Murukan became > identified with the tribal chieftains as a god of war, becoming popular > among all segments of the society.

With advent of North Indian traditions arriving with the Pallava > and Kadamba dynasties, Murukan was infused with the aspects of Kartikeya or > Skanda, a god of war from North India.

It included his marriage of Valli from To·πá·π≠ainƒÅ·π≠u. > =Katargamadevio cult= Legends in Sri Lanka claimed that Valli was a > daughter of a Vedda chief from Kataragama in the south of the island. The > town of Kalutara, known in some sources as Velapura, became associated with > Murukan worship as well. The cult of Murukan was grafted onto the worship of > Skanda-Kumara that was prevalent in Sri Lanka. Amongst the Sinhalese he > became known as the god of Kataragama village, thus Kataragamdevio. Shrines > of Katargamadevio are found in almost all Sinhala Buddhist villages and > towns. He is recognized as one of the guardian deities. Worshipers take an > arduous pilgrimage on foot through jungles to fulfill their vows to the > deity. The pilgrimage included both Tamils from India and Sri Lanka as well > as Sinhalese.

Although since the medieval > period Hindus, Buddhists and even Muslims have tried to co-opt the temple, > deity and its worship as their own, the rituals maintained by the native > priests are still intact. The main festival known in Sinhalese as Esela > Perehera. It is celebrated during the months of July and August.

Lyndon is a 5-time winner of Australia's Strongest Man, and a 4-time entrant to the World's Strongest Man competition. Early years Bill Lyndon was born in Melbourne, Australia. He was one of seven children having five sisters and a brother. He was educated at high school in Melbourne and went on to business college, afterwards becoming a structural engineer. A keen sportsman, he played a variety of sports including Australian Rules Football, American Football, Rugby league, cycling and from the age of 23, powerlifting. His rugby league led him to spend two seasons in Perth and as a powerlifter he won four national powerlifting titles. Interview with Bill Lyndon on Samson- Power.com, 27 January 2000 Strongman career In terms of strongman competition his international career began after he was invited to Scotland for the 1993 World Muscle Power Classic. Some of Bill's competitors in this contest included: Gary Taylor, Manfred Hoeberl, Wayne Price, Magnus Ver Magnusson (referred to as \\"Maggie\\" by Lyndon) and Forbes Cowan. Although Lyndon did not feature among the contenders he found the experience of being around such renowned strongmen a rewarding one. The 1993 World's Strongest Man competition was held in Orange, France and Lyndon was considered for the last spot but Harold \\"Iron Bear\\" Collins was chosen that year. The following year, another triumph in Australia's Strongest Man secured Lyndon a spot at the 1994 World's Strongest Man contest, but failed to make the finals. Nathan Jones won the Australian title in 1995 and got the place at 1995 World's Strongest Man contest, where his arm was broken in an armwrestling match in the heats with 1998 World's Strongest Man champion Magnus Samuelsson. Lyndon went on to compete at the 1996 World's Strongest Man, 1997 World's Strongest Man and 1998 World's Strongest Man qualifying heats, but he was never able to qualify for the finals. In 1999, when the IFSA was still running WSM, Manfred Hoeberl set up a rival AFSA organization. Lyndon joined this and as such was banned by IFSA. Lyndon's decision was swayed by the fact that he was not getting enough competitions via IFSA. In 1998 he had only competed in Hungary and Morocco, whereas the AFSA offered five competitions in the first year. Retirement In the late 1990s Bill looked towards his own Australian based sports promotion company. He formed 'Spartan Warriors Australia' and began advertising extensively in magazines and at public events, He later started a website called Aussie Power designed to cover and feature many diverse athletes from strongman, powerlifters, olympic lifters, throwers covering Australia and the Asia Pacific region.

History The park was formerly the estate of the Osborne family, the owners of metalworking and textile product factories in the Naugatuck Valley area. Frances Osborne Kellogg and her husband, Waldo Kellogg, assembled the property through the acquisition of several farms. The Kelloggs operated two successful farming operations on the land under the name of Osbornedale Farms. One farm specialized in breeding Osbornedale Holstein cows and the other produced milk from a herd of Jersey cows. Prior uses of the park land included silver mining in the years after the American Revolutionary War and bottling of spring water. The estate was given to the state of Connecticut by Frances Osborne Kellogg upon her death in 1956.

This family produced different branches in France, Austria, Belgium, and became extinct in 1948 in the male line with Louis-Charles de Ficquelmont de Vyle and in the female line in 1991 with countess Ghislaine de Ficquelmont de Vyle. Origins The origins of the Ficquelmont Family is the lordship of Ficquelmont (currently Thumer√©ville) in Lorraine, near Briey The Ficquelmont family is known since 1138, with G√©rard de Ficquelmont who gave a donation in 1138 but its filiation is established without doubts only since Henry de Ficquelmont, knight, dead before 1386. According to the genealogist Charles Poplimont, who wrote a genealogy of the de Ficquelmont family in La Belgique H√©raldique (1866),Charles Poplimont,La Belgique h√©raldique, volume IV, 1866, pages 225-232. Henri de Ficquelmont, was married with Marie le Loup and he was son of Erard de Ficquelmont anf grandson of Manass√©s de Ficquelmont, who was living in 1346 and Marie Dannoy. Lorraine and the Holy Roman Empire In Lorraine where they sat as hereditary members of the upper house of the Parlement de Nancy, the ruling institution of French Lorraine that also served as the courts of appeal of the Royal province. During that period, the Ficquelmonts' primary seats were the ch√¢teaux of Dieuze (birthplace of Count Charles-Louis de Ficquelmont (1777-1857), Parroy and their H√¥tel in Nancy. The Ficquelmonts were also instrumental in founding and funding several Lorrainer religious institutions such as the Holy Cross College of Nancy, the Cathedral of Metz and the abbeys of Remiremont and Flavigny. The members of the Ficquelmont family had been Great Officers of the Ducal Court of Lorraine: lords chamberlain, lords master of ceremonies or lords commander of the Dukes. In the 17th and 18th century were: * Leonard de Ficquelmont, colonel of Charles IV, Duke of Lorraine, commanding the Blainville regiment; * Robert de Ficquelmont, Great-chamberlain of Charles III, Duke of Lorraine; * his grandson, Jean-Fran√ßois de Ficquelmont,Woelmont, Op. cit., p. 343-344. Great-chamberlain and colonel of the guard of Leopold I, Duke of Lorraine, commanding the dukal cavalry; * his son, Reichsgraf Charles de Ficquelmont Great-chamberlain of Francis I of Lorraine, Holy Roman Emperor, colonel of HIM's cuirassiers commanding the imperial guard's cavalry; * his son, Reichsgraf Jacques-Charles de Ficquelmont, colonel of the guard and Great-chamberlain of Francis I of Lorraine, Holy Roman Emperor, commanding the cavalry regiment of Kalchreuth then of Thun. The Ficquelmonts took part of the chivalry Orders of Saint John of Jerusalem of Rhodes and of Malta, of the Golden Fleece.https://www.napoleon- series.org/research/biographies/Austria/AustrianGenerals/c_AustrianGeneralsF.html Biographical Dictionary of all Austrian Generals during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars 1792-1815 They also often fought as warlords at the service of France, Spain and the Papacy. The perfect illustration being Count Leonard de Ficquelmont, colonel of Charles IV, Duke of Lorraine, colonel of King Philip V of Spain who died in 1709 during the War of the Spanish Succession in Cataluna. France and Austria After Empress Maria Theresa of Austria had married Emperor Francis of Lorraine, the family was under the rule of the Habsburgs, but, by the Treaty of Vienna, the Duchy of Lorraine became part of the Kingdom of France and the Ficquelmonts were allowed to choose to serve and live either in France or in the Empire. =France= Some others members of the family had chosen France. The count Charles Henri de Ficquelmont was introduced at the Honnors of the French Court (Honneurs de la Cour) in 1777 and 1789. In 1789, during the French Revolution, the Ficquelmonts, as aristocrats, were targeted by the Revolution, and several members of the family were beheaded leaving the remaining ones no other choice than fleeing the country, joining fellow aristocrats as √©migr√©s. After the French Revolution, the Ficquelmont family remained divided into different lines and spread in Austria, France and Belgium. =Austrian Empire= Count Charles Louis de Ficquelmont Elisabeth-Alexandrine de Ficquelmont, princess Clary-und-Aldringen and her daughter Some Ficquelmonts who had followed Emperor Francis of Lorraine to the Imperial Court and therefore already established themselves in Austria, chose to settle in Austrian territory. Of that tight branch are Reichsgraf Charles de Ficquelmont, Great-chamberlain of Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor, colonel of HIM's cuirassiers commanding the imperial guard's cavalry and his son, Reichsgraf Jacques-Charles de Ficquelmont, colonel of the guard and Great-chamberlain of Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor, commanding the cavalry regiment of Kalchreuth then of Thun. By the end of the 18th century, they had settled in large estates in the then Austrian Netherlands. Part of the French Ficquelmonts chose to emigrate to Austria where the family had kept close ties (for instance, Charles de Ficquelmont (1724‚Äì1792), had followed Francis I of Lorraine, Holy Roman Emperor at the Imperial Court of Vienna when he was 12 and had stayed there ever since serving as colonel of the Imperial guard and (from 1764) Great- chamberlain of Emperors Francis I and Joseph II\\"Charles, comte de Ficquelmont, Lorrain de naissance, n'avait que douze ans lorsque le duc Fran√ßois de Lorraine, plus tard empereur Fran√ßois Ier, l'emmena en Autriche.

This branch took part of the counter revolutionary's Army of the Princes and Imperial Austrian Army. It is best represented by: * Count Charles Louis de Ficquelmont (Reichsgraf von Ficquelmont), born in the castle of Dieuze on March 23, 1777; he became one of the most powerful Austrian diplomat and statesman of his time and even succeeded Prince Klemens von Metternich as acting Minister-President of the Austrian Empire. He married countess Dorothea von Tiesenhausen, granddaughter of Prince Mikhail Kutuzov, Masrshall of the Russian army and hero of the Napoleonic wars. Dorothea and Charles-Louis only had one child: * Elizabeth- Alexandrine, countess de Ficquelmont by birth and princess Clary-und-Aldringen by marriage, last countess of the Austrian branch. Netherlands and Belgium Countess Ficquelmont de Vyle The last descendants of the Austrian branch had settled in what was Austrian Netherlands (nowadays Belgium) prior to the French Revolution. They had fled the country as it was occupied by the French during the French Revolutionary Wars then integrated into the Napoleon's Empire. But, following the fall of the First French Empire, the Austrian Netherlands became part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands that had just been created by the Treaty of Vienna, and the Dutch Ficquelmonts returned to establish themselves in the newly founded kingdom. This branch had two lines: *The first one, founded by count Antoine-Charles de Ficquelmont (1753-1833), who remained faithful to King William I of the Netherlands following the Belgian Revolution of 1830. That line is extinct since the early 20th century. * The other line, founded by count Florimond Alo√Øs de Ficquelmont (1763-1818). His grandson took up Belgium nationality in 1884 and therefore entered the Belgian nobility.

P. chaba is called ‡¶ö‡ßÅ‡¶á ‡¶ù‡¶æ‡¶≤ (Chui Jhal) or ‡¶ö‡¶á ‡¶ù‡¶æ‡¶≤ (Choi Jhal) in the Khulna Division of Bangladesh, and the states of Tripura and West Bengal in India. P. chaba is found throughout India, and other warmer regions of Asia including Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore and Sri Lanka. It is a creeper plant that spreads on the ground. It may also grow around large trees. The leaves are oval-shaped and about 2 to 3 inches long. The flowers are monoecious and blossom during the monsoon. The fruit looks similar to other varieties of long pepper, with an elongated shape that can grow up to 3 inches long. The fruit is red when ripe, which turns dark brown or black when dry. Culinary use chui jhal People in Bangladesh's south-western districts like Khulna Division cut down the stem, roots, peel the skin and chop it into small pieces - and cook them with meat and fish, especially with mutton. The spicy pungent flavor of Choi Jhal is a year-round additive spice. In Indian states of West Bengal and Tripura people use this spice similarly with exception to some people in South Bengal who prepare a complete dish with the Chapa as the base ingredient, it is very spicy. In Thailand, P. chaba is known commonly as \\"Dee Plee\\" and also referred to as \\"Thai long pepper\\" and it is consumed both in fresh and dried forms. Ground by mortar and pestle, P. chaba is an ingredient in a variety of Thai sauces and pastes, and it is added to soups to mute excessively strong fish flavors. In Bangladesh, the stems of the plant are used as a spice in meat and fish dishes. In most countries of South and South-East Asia, the fruit of the Piperaceae vines is well known as a spice and is called the \\"long pepper\\". However, in Bangladesh the use of Choi Jhal is unique, because the twigs, stems or roots of P. chaba ‚Äì not the fruit ‚Äì are used as a spice. It is a relatively expensive spice in Bangladesh, and the roots are usually more expensive than the stems because of their stronger aroma. The taste is similar to horseradish.

Biography Born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada on 7 April 1802, the son of a Scottish father and English mother, he came to Fochabers with his parents in 1816. The following year, he entered the Seminary of Aquhorties as an ecclesiastical student and a year later on 3 December 1818, on the instructions of Bishop Alexander Cameron, he and four companions set off from Aquhorties for Paris. Once there, he entered the Seminary of St Nicholas on 16 December 1818. He left St Nicholas in October 1823 and entered the Sulpician's Seminary of Issy, returning to Scotland in April 1826 after his health had given way. He was ordained a priest by Bishop Paterson at Aquhorties on 9 June 1827. In 1831, John Menzies of Pitfodels, having 3 years' previously bestowed on the Catholic Church in Scotland his extensive estate of Blairs, near Aberdeen, came to reside permanently in Edinburgh and he persuaded Bishop Paterson to live with him at his home, 24 York Place. The Bishop took James Gillis with him, as his secretary. James Gillis was appointed the Coadjutor Vicar Apostolic of the Eastern District and Titular Bishop of Limyra by the Holy See on 28 July 1837 and consecrated to the Episcopate on 22 July 1838.

He died in office on 24 February 1864, aged 61. =St. Margaret's Convent= Agnes Xavier Trail In the 1830s, the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland was not yet re-established. James Gillis was a young priest, without influence, experience or worldly means but he wanted to establish a convent and so was sent by Bishop Paterson to the Continent to raise funds. On his journey via London, he was introduced to Miss Ann Agnes Trail, the daughter of a minister of the Church of Scotland. Subsequently on his return to England, Miss Trail wrote to him offering herself as a member of his projected Community. The other Scottish lady, Miss Margaret Clapperton, who was to be one of the founding members of the Community, came from Fochabers and had known James Gillis for much of her life. It was agreed that Miss Trail and Miss Clapperton should go together to Chavagnes, the Mother House of the Ursulines of Jesus and they arrived there on 31 August 1833. Meanwhile, James Gillis managed in June 1834 to purchase a suitable house, known as Whitehouse, for his proposed Convent with 2 acres of ground for ¬£3,000.Registers of Scotland, Particular Register 1411, Page 253, Registered 11 June 1834 The initial group of eleven Sisters comprising Miss Trail (now Sister Agnes Xavier), Miss Clapperton (now Sister Margaret Teresa), The Reverend Mother St Hilaire, Mother St Paula, Sister St Damian, Sister Alexis, Sister John Chrysostom, Sister Mary Emily, Sister Angelina and two lay Sisters, Sister Stephen and Sister Eustelle then travelled to Scotland but had to live elsewhere for four months while the Convent was being made ready. On 26 December 1834, the Community took possession of St Margaret's Convent, which was the first post-Reformation convent in Scotland. At St Margaret's, arrangements had been made for the reception of young lady boarders, whose education was to be the principal work of the Sisters. In 1835, the Feast of St Margaret was kept on 16 June and the new St Margaret's Chapel, which had been built alongside the Whitehouse Mansion House, was finished. In 1863, this chapel went on to house a relic, given to them by Bishop Gillis, of St. Margaret of Scotland. For over 150 years, until it was closed in 1986, it was well known in Edinburgh as St Margaret's Convent and School under the ministry of the Ursulines of Jesus.

Through his writings and teachings, he has sought to unify Indian people of all nations.Lorentz, Melissa. \\"First Nations of Minnesota: Famous Lakota.\\" EMuseum @ Minnesota State University, Mankato. 2008 (retrieved 01 Oct 10) As a practitioner of traditional herbal medicine and a leader of Sun Dance ceremonies, Crow Dog is also dedicated to keeping Lakota traditions alive. Background Leonard Crow Dog was born in 1942 into a Sicanju Lakota family on the Rosebud Indian Reservation in South Dakota. He is a descendant of a prestigious, traditional family of medicine men and leaders. The name Crow Dog is a poor translation of Kangi Shunka Manitou (Crow Coyote). American Indian Movement In 1970 Native American activist Dennis Banks met with Crow Dog, seeking a spiritual leader for the American Indian Movement (AIM), which had started among urban Indians in Minneapolis. Crow Dog had already been trying to unite people on the Rosebud Indian Reservation to organize and work together on issues affecting Indians. AIM organized the large march of the 1972 Trail of Broken Treaties to Washington, D.C. to demand presidential attention to Indian issues. They campaigned on behalf of Indian veterans who were not getting the services they needed. Crow Dog also led protests in Rapid City and the town of Custer, South Dakota to demand justice for hate crimes against the Lakota. The atmosphere on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, which borders Rosebud, became increasingly tense. Tribal chairman Dick Wilson, believed by opponents to have been fraudulently elected, had accrued much power. He created a personal police unit, known as the Guardians of the Oglala Nation (GOONs), which was used to suppress political opposition. Residents of Pine Ridge who were tired of corruption in tribal government and mistreatment by whites gathered to protest. In 1973 the Oglala Lakota of Pine Ridge took over the village of Wounded Knee to demand justice from the federal government and an end to Wilson's tenure. The takeover of Wounded Knee had special meaning for Crow Dog because his great-grandfather, Jerome Crow Dog, had been a Ghost Dancer. After receiving a vision, Jerome had warned several dancers to stay away from a large gathering of tribes in 1890; he saved them from being victims of the Wounded Knee Massacre. When Leonard Crow Dog went to Wounded Knee in 1973, he was very moved. He later said: > Standing on the hill where so many people were buried in a common grave, > standing there in that cold darkness under the stars, I felt tears running > down my face. I can't describe what I felt. I heard the voices of the long- > dead ghost dancers crying out to us. Incarceration Shortly after the Wounded Knee incident ended, the federal government began prosecuting AIM leaders for various charges. One early September morning of 1975, 185 FBI officers, federal marshals, and SWAT teams showed up at Crow Dog's Paradise looking for Leonard Peltier, who was a suspect in the murders of two FBI agents at Pine Ridge Reservation. They arrested Crow Dog as a suspect, and he was first held at the maximum security unit at Leavenworth, where he was placed in solitary confinement for two weeks. He was moved from one prison to another many times after he was convicted and sentenced to a long term in prison. The National Council of Churches took up Crow Dog's case and raised $150,000 for his appeal. Vine Deloria, Jr. was one of the attorneys involved on his behalf. However, his appeal was denied. When Crow Dog's defense team went before a judge to apply for a sentence reduction, they saw a long table stacked with letters and petitions from all over the world in support of Crow Dog. The federal judge ordered that Crow Dog be immediately released. He had already served nearly two years of his sentence. Personal life Crow Dog married his first wife, Francine, in the Native American Church. He took the name \\"Defends His Medicine\\", in reference to the sacred peyote plant. Shortly after Wounded Knee, Crow Dog began his second marriage. He was married to Mary Ellen Moore, later known as Brave Bird, with a pipe ceremony. They lived at Crow Dog's Paradise with Crow Dog's parents, three children from his previous marriage, and Mary's son, Pedro. His son, Leonard Alden Crow Dog, is an artist, spiritual Leader and Sundance Chief; Jancita Eagle Deer was his step-daughter. Books He wrote Crow Dog: Four Generations of Sioux Medicine Men. The memoir recounts family history through four generations of the Crow Dog family. The book details ghost dancers, a group who brought a \\"new way of praying, of relating to the spirits\\"; Jerome Crow Dog, Leonard Crow Dog's great-grandfather, who was the first Native American to win a case in the Supreme Court in ex parte Crow Dog; and Leonard's father, Henry, who introduced peyote for sacred use to the Lakota Sioux. Crow Dog also details Lakota tribal ceremonies and their meanings, and his perspective on the 1972 march on Washington and the 1973 siege of Wounded Knee. Prophecy In 1978, Leonard Crow Dog was part of The Longest Walk from Washington DC to the Black Hills. Other attendees on the Walk included Watermelon Slim, who joined on the last 20 miles. Crow Dog prophesied to a group that, \\"the human beings have a few more years to stop tearing Mother Earth, or she will take herself back from us.\\" Published works * Crow Dog, Leonard, and Richard Erdoes.

The Emancipation Oak, a National Historical Landmark, was itself a catalyst for the 140th anniversary celebration of the Emancipation Proclamation. Subsequently, in 2004, the oak was named America's national tree. The nearby city of Newport News, Virginia held a First Reading anniversary celebration consisting of a presentational reading of the Emancipation Proclamation with living historians portraying slaves to emphasize the meaning of President Lincoln's historic act of universal manumission. The event was held in the Newport News City Council chambers, and included a resolution issued by the city's mayor, Joe Frank, as to the significance of the celebratory year.

The experiments were led by physician John Charles Cutler who also participated in the late stages of the Tuskegee syphilis experiment. Doctors infected soldiers, prostitutes, prisoners and mental patients with syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases, without the informed consent of the subjects. The experiment resulted in at least 83 deaths. Serology studies continued through 1953 involving the same vulnerable populations in addition to children from state- run schools, an orphanage, and rural towns, though the intentional infection of patients ended with the original study. On October 1, 2010, the U.S. President, Secretary of State and Secretary of Health and Human ServicesMaggie Fox, \\"U.S. apologizes for syphilis experiment in Guatemala\\", https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-guatemala-experiment/u-s-apologizes- for-syphilis-experiment-in-guatemala-idUSTRE6903RZ20101001 formally apologized to Guatemala for the ethical violations that took place. Guatemala condemned the experiment as a crime against humanity, and a lawsuit has since been filed.  Experiment  Tuskegee-syphilis-study doctor drawing blood from test subject = Historical context = Beginning in 1947, syphilis prevention research was being conducted on rabbits through injection of penicillin. Around this same time, there was a large push by medical professionals, including the U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Thomas Parran, to further the knowledge of sexually transmitted diseases and discover more viable treatment options in humans. With the onset of World War II, this emphasis for new knowledge became stronger and won more supporters. This was largely due to an effort to protect the U.S. military population from the increasing infections of STDs such as gonorrhea as well as the particularly painful regimen of prophylaxis that involved in the injection of a silver proteinate into subjects' penises.Ethically Impossible: STD Research in Guatemala from 1946 to 1948, Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues, published 2011-09-13, accessed 2015-10-23 At the time, it was estimated that venereal diseases would affect 350,000 soldiers, which would equate to eradicating 2 armed divisions for an entire year. The cost of these losses, which would sum up to about $34 million at the time, put an urgent strain on research for STD treatments. The first experiment following the push for new developments in STD treatment and preventative measures were the Terre Haute prison experiments from 1943‚Äì1944, which were conducted and supported by many of the same individuals who would go on to participate in the Guatemalan syphilis experiments only a few years later. The goal of this experiment was to find a more suitable STD prophylaxis, by infecting human subjects recruited from prison populations with gonorrhea. Though at first, the idea of using human subjects was controversial, the support of Dr. Thomas Parran, and Executive Officer of the U.S. Army Medical Corps, Colonel John A. Rodgers allowed Dr. John F. Mahoney and Dr. Cassius J. Van Slyke to begin implementing the experiments. Dr. John Cutler, a young associate of Dr. Mahoney, helped conduct the experiments, and went on to lead the Guatemala Syphilis Experiment. The experiments in Terre Haute were the precursor for the Guatemalan experiments. It was the first to demonstrate how earnestly military leaders pushed for new developments to combat STDs and their willingness to infect human subjects, and also explained why the study clinicians would choose Guatemala- to avoid the ethical constraints related to individual consent, other adverse legal consequences, and bad publicity. = Study clinicians =  John Charles Cutler  The experiments were led by United States Public Health Service physician John Charles Cutler, who had earlier participated in the similar Terre Haute prison experiments, in which volunteer prisoners were infected with gonorrhea. Cutler also later took part in the late stages of the Tuskegee syphilis experiment. While the Tuskegee experiment followed the natural progression of syphilis in those already infected, in Guatemala, doctors deliberately infected healthy people with the diseases; some of which can be fatal if untreated. The goal of the study seems to have been to determine the effect of penicillin in the prevention and treatment of venereal diseases. The researchers paid prostitutes infected with syphilis to have sex with prisoners, while other subjects were infected by directly inoculating them with the bacterium. Through intentional exposure to gonorrhea, syphilis, and chancroid, a total of 1,308 people were involved in the experiments. Of that group, with an age range of 10-72, 678 individuals (52%) can be said to have received a form of treatment. Hidden from the public, John Charles Cutler utilized healthy individuals in order to improve what he called \\"pure science.\\"  Dr. John F. Mahoney  Dr. John F. Mahoney led the Terre Haute Prison experiments and supervised Dr. Cutler in the Guatemala Syphilis Experiment. Mahoney graduated from medical school in 1914 and by 1918 was titled Assistant Surgeon at the United States Public Health Service. By 1929, Dr. Mahoney worked as the director of the Venereal Disease Research Lab in Staten Island, where the Terre Haute experiments began in 1943, this is also where Cutler first assisted him. After stopping the Terre Haute experiments for lack of accurate infection of subjects with gonorrhea, Dr. Mahoney moved on to study the effects of penicillin on syphilis. His research found huge success for penicillin treatments and the US army embraced it in STD prescription. Although this seemed promising, Mahoney and his collaborators questioned the long term effectiveness of eliminating the disease altogether in individuals. Mahoney, Cutler, and other researchers, felt that a smaller, more controlled group of individuals to study would be more helpful in finding this cure. This led to the use of citizens in Guatemala as subjects.  Genevieve Stout  Genevieve Stout was an employee of the Pan American Sanitary Bureau who promoted and established serological research in Guatemalan laboratories. She initiated the VDRL and Training Center within Central America starting in 1948 and she stayed in Guatemala until 1951. Here she conducted several independent serological experiments for STD research following Dr. Cutler.  Dr. Funes and Dr. Salvado  Dr. Funes and Dr. Salvado were also employees of the Pan American Sanitary Bureau who remained in Guatemala after the work of Dr. Cutler. In order to advance in their careers, they opted to stay and continue observations on subjects of the Syphilis experiments, including data collections from orphans, inmates, psychiatric patients, and school kids. These periodic data collections consisted of blood specimens and lumbar punctures from participants. Data was shipped backed to the United States where many of these blood samples tested positive for syphilis. Dr. Funes collected samples from participants until 1953. = Study details = The experiments were funded by a grant from the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) to the Pan American Sanitary Bureau and involved multiple Guatemalan government ministries. A total of about 1,500 study subjects were involved, although the findings were never published. In archived documents, Dr. Thomas Parran, Jr., the U.S. Surgeon General at the time of the experiments, acknowledged that the Guatemalan work could not be done domestically, and details were hidden from Guatemalan officials. The study is officially stated to have ended in 1948. Eighty-three individuals died during the course of the experiment, though it is unclear as to whether or not the inoculations were the source of these deaths. = Subjects = In total, 1,308 people were involved in this experiment, and of this group, 678 individuals were documented as getting some form of treatment. This population consisted of commercial sex workers, prisoners, soldiers, and mental hospital patients. Their ages ranged from 10 to 72, though the average subject was in their 20s. A documented subject profile provides a detailed description of what the subjects faced within this experiment: Psoriasis and syphilis; lesions on face and body, 1866 Wellcome V0010104 > Berta was a female patient in the Psychiatric Hospital... in February 1948, > Berta was injected in her left arm with syphilis.

Several days later, Berta's eyes were filled with pus from > the gonorrhea, and she was bleeding from her urethra. Three days later, on > August 27, Berta died. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention acknowledges that \\"the design and conduct of the studies was unethical in many respects, including deliberate exposure of subjects to known serious health threats, lack of knowledge of and consent for experimental procedures by study subjects, and the use of highly vulnerable populations.\\"\\"Findings from a CDC Report on the 1946-1948 U.S. Public Health Service Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) Inoculation Study\\", U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, 30 September 2010 A total of 83 subjects died, though the exact relationship to the experiment remains undocumented. Aftermath = Apology and response = Professor Susan Mokotoff Reverby of Wellesley College uncovered information about these experiments. Reverby found the documents in 2005 while researching the Tuskegee syphilis study, in Cutler's archived papers, and shared her findings with United States government officials. Francis Collins, the NIH director at the time of the revelations, called the experiments \\"a dark chapter in history of medicine\\" and commented that modern rules prohibit conducting human subject research without informed consent. In October 2010, the U.S. government formally apologized and announced that the violation of human rights in that medical research was still to be condemned, regardless of how much time had passed. Following the apology, Barack Obama requested an investigation to be conducted by the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues on November 24, 2010. The commission concluded nine months later that the experiments \\"involved gross violations of ethics as judged against both the standards of today and the researchers' own understanding\\". In a joint statement, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius said: Hillary Clinton with Alvaro Colom 2010 > Although these events occurred more than 64 years ago, we are outraged that > such reprehensible research could have occurred under the guise of public > health. We deeply regret that it happened, and we apologize to all the > individuals who were affected by such abhorrent research practices. The > conduct exhibited during the study does not represent the values of the US, > or our commitment to human dignity and great respect for the people of > Guatemala. President Barack Obama apologized to President √Ålvaro Colom, who had called the experiments \\"a crime against humanity\\". \\"It is clear from the language of the report that the U.S. researchers understood the profoundly unethical nature of the study. In fact the Guatemalan syphilis study was being carried out just as the ‚ÄúDoctors' Trial‚Äù was unfolding at Nuremberg (December 1946 ‚Äì August 1947), when 23 German physicians stood trial for participating in Nazi programs to euthanize or medically experiment on concentration camp prisoners.\\" The U.S. government asked the Institute of Medicine to conduct a review of these experiments beginning January 2011.  Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues Investigation  While the Institute of Medicine conducted their review, the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues was asked to convene a panel of international experts to review the current state of medical research on humans around the world and ensure that these sorts of incidents do not occur again. The Commission report, Ethically Impossible: STD Research in Guatemala from 1946 to 1948, published in September 2011, aimed to answer four questions: # What occurred in Guatemala between 1946 and 1948 involving a series of STD exposure studies funded by the U.S. PHS? # To what extent were U.S. government officials and others in the medical research establishment at that time aware of the research protocols and to what extent did they actively facilitate or assist in them? # What was the historical context in which these studies were done? # How did the studies comport with or diverge from the relevant medical and ethical standards and conventions of the time? The investigation concluded that \\"the Guatemala experiments involved unconscionable basic violations of ethics, even as judged against the researchers' own recognition of the requirements of the medical ethics of the day.\\" Human rights activists have called for subjects' families to be compensated. As of 2017, the families still have not been compensated even though there have been several lawsuits. =Lawsuits= Manuel Gudiel Garcia v. Kathleen Sebelius In March 2011, seven plaintiffs filed a federal class-action lawsuit against the U.S. government claiming damages for the Guatemala experiments. This case argued that the United States was at fault due to not asking for consent. This lawsuit asked for money to compensate for medical damages and livelihood because most of the families were living in poverty. The case failed when a judge determined that the U.S. government could not be held liable for actions committed outside of the U.S. Estate of Arturo Giron Alvarez et al. v. The Johns Hopkins University et al. In April 2015, 774 plaintiffs launched a lawsuit against Johns Hopkins University, the pharmaceutical company Bristol- Myers Squibb, and the Rockefeller Foundation seeking $1 billion for damages. The hope was that compensation could be attained by targeting private institutions rather than the federal government. In January 2019, U.S. District Judge Theodore Chuang rejected the defendants' argument that a recent Supreme Court decision shielding foreign corporations from lawsuits in U.S. courts over human rights abuses abroad also applied to domestic corporations absent Congressional authorization and decided to admit the trial. Johns Hopkins, Bristol-Myers must face $1 billion syphilis infections suit. (Reuters, Jan 2019, 5:23 PM) The case is Estate of Arturo Giron Alvarez et al v.

He was the co-founder (with John Kearney Rodgers) of the New York Eye Infirmary and the first president of the American Ophthalmological Society. From 1858 until his death he was the president of the College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York City. His son, Francis Delafield, also became a prominent physician. Edward Delafield is buried at the Delafield Family Mausoleum Delafield Family Mausoleum Inscriptions Delafield Family Mausoleum(close) Early life Delafield was born in New York City, one of the 14 children to John Delafield and Anne (n√©e Hallett) Delafield. His father emigrated to New York from England in 1788 and made a fortune as a merchant. Among his siblings were brothers Joseph Delafield, Maj. Gen. Richard Delafield and Rufus King Delafield. =Education and War of 1812= Delafield was educated at Union Hall Academy before entering Yale University, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1812. He then studied medicine at the New York College of Physicians and Surgeons while simultaneously training under a prominent New York surgeon, Samuel Borrowe. His medical studies were interrupted by the War of 1812. He and his brothers Henry, William, and Joseph joined the \\"Iron Grays\\", a private infantry company formed in 1814 and charged with protecting New York City from the perceived (but unrealized) threat of a British invasion. Delafield served as the company's surgeon and as a surgeon in the New York company of the Sea Fencibles Battalion.Samuels (1939) p. 79 Delafield graduated from the College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1816. His inaugural dissertation on tuberculosis was written under the guidance of Samuel Borrowe.Delafield (1816) Later that year, he and his fellow student at the college, John Kearney Rodgers, went to London for further training. They studied under Astley Paston Cooper and John Abernethy at St Thomas's Hospital and St. Bartholomew's Hospital but focused primarily on ophthalmology, which they studied at Moorfields Eye Hospital (then called the London Dispensary for Curing Diseases of the Eye and Ear). Delafield also spent some months studying in Paris hospitals. His meticulous handwritten and indexed notes of the lectures he attended, primarily those of Abernethy and Paston, consist of over 3000 pages and are preserved in the New York Academy of Medicine.Samuels (1939) p. 80 Career After his return to New York in 1818, Delafield went into private practice. In 1820, he and Rodgers founded the New York Eye Infirmary which provided free eye care to the poor of New York City. For the first two years, the two young doctors financed the infirmary themselves. Delafield remained the infirmary's attending surgeon until 1850, and consulting surgeon until 1870.Kara (1973)Hubbell (1907) pp. 17-18 In the early 1820s, he went into partnership with his former mentor Samuel Borrowe in what was to become a large and lucrative private practice. In 1825 the first American edition of Benjamin Travers's A Synopsis of Diseases of the Eye and their Treatment was published with additions and extensive notes by Delafield.Travers (1825) The following year he was appointed Professor of obstetrics and diseases of women and children at the College of Physicians and Surgeons. In 1834, he was also appointed attending physician to the New York Hospital. However, in 1838 he gave up these two positions due to the increasing pressure of work at his private practice.Samuels (1939) pp. 81-82 In subsequent years Delafield went on to hold many prominent positions in the medical establishment of New York. In 1842 he became the founding president the Society for the Relief of Widows and Orphans of Medical Men and in 1847 was a founding fellow of the New York Academy of Medicine. He was the first President of the Medical Board of the Nursery and Child's Hospital founded by his niece, Mary Ann Delafield DuBois, in 1854 and served as its consulting physician for the rest of his life.Miller (2008) p. 109 In 1858 he was appointed senior consulting physician at St. Luke's Hospital (now Mount Sinai Morningside) and president of the College of Physicians and Surgeons, a position he held until his death. He was one of the founders of the American Ophthalmological Society, the oldest specialty medical society in the United States, and became its first president in 1864. He also served as senior consulting physician of the Woman's Hospital and president of the Roosevelt Hospital (now Mount Sinai West).Samuels (1939) pp. 82-83 Personal life Julia Floyd Delafield Delafield was married twice. In 1821 he married Eleanor Elizabeth Langdon Elwyn (1799‚Äì1834), the granddaughter of New Hampshire's second Governor, John Langdon. Eleanor died from tuberculosis in 1834. All of the six children from that marriage eventually died from the same disease. His second wife was Julia Floyd (1808‚Äì1879), the granddaughter of William Floyd. They married in 1839 and had five children, including:Samuels (1939) p. 86 * Francis Delafield (1841‚Äì1915), the physician and pathologist * Augustus Floyd Delafield * Emma Delafield In 1859, Dr. Edward Delafield and his second wife Julia Floyd bought their initial 50 acres of land in Darien, Connecticut for $6,000. Construction on their summer house \\"Felsenhof\\" was completed in 1861. They continued to buy neighboring plots around the main house and eventually amassed 165 acres on Scott's cove. Edward Delafield died at his home in New York City in 1875 at the age of 80. He was buried in Green-Wood Cemetery with the last two of his surviving brothers, Joseph and Henry, following a joint funeral at Trinity Church in New York City.

He was the co-founder (with Edward Delafield) of the New York Eye Infirmary and a Fellow and Trustee of the New York College of Physicians and Surgeons. Life and career Rodgers was born in New York City in 1794, the elder son of John Richardson Bayard Rodgers and Susannah Ravaud Kearny. His father was a physician who served as a surgeon in the Revolutionary Army and was later a professor at the New York College of Physicians and Surgeons. His paternal grandfather, John Rodgers, was the pastor of the First Presbyterian Church in Manhattan for many years. Rodgers's younger brother, Ravaud Kearney Rodgers (1796‚Äì1879), also became a Presbyterian minister.University of Georgia, Hargrett Rare Book and Manuscript Library. Rodgers-Bloomfield family collection. Retrieved 19 May 2013. Rodgers studied as an undergraduate at Princeton College, followed by medical studies at the New York College of Physicians and Surgeons and training with Wright Post, a prominent New York surgeon. After graduating from the College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1816, he and his fellow student there, Edward Delafield, went to London for further training. Both of them focused on ophthalmology, which they studied at Moorfields Eye Hospital (then called the London Dispensary for Curing Diseases of the Eye and Ear). In 1818, shortly after his return to New York, Rodgers was appointed as a demonstrator in the anatomy department of the College of Physicians and Surgeons and also went into private practice. In 1820, he and Delafield founded the New York Eye Infirmary which provided free eye care to the poor of New York City. For the first two years, the two young doctors financed the infirmary themselves.Kara (1973) Rodgers continued to serve as the infirmary's surgeon for many years. In 1822, he was also appointed as surgeon to the New York Hospital, a position he held until his death in 1851.Hubbell (1907) p. 65 In a biographical sketch read before the New York Academy of Medicine on October 6, 1852, Edward Delafield noted that in the course of his career, Rodgers had also been a consulting surgeon to the New York Lying-In Asylum, the Institution for the Blind, and the Emigrants' Hospital. He was also an honorary member of the New York Pathological Society and a former president of the New York County Medical Society and vice- president of the Academy of Medicine. Rodgers had married Mary Ridgely Nicholson in 1823. The couple had two sons and four daughters before her death from tuberculosis. He married Emily Hosack, the youngest daughter of David Hosack, in November 1846 and had two more daughters.Delafield (1852) Five years after their marriage, Rodgers died from liver inflammation followed by peritonitis. He was attended by several physicians during his month-long illness, with serious disagreements between them as to the appropriateness of his treatment and the ultimate cause of his death. Shortly afterwards, one of the physicians, Alexander Eddy Hosack (who was also Rodgers's brother-in-law), wrote a treatise on his death, \\"History of the Case of the Late John Kearney Rodgers, M.D: Addressed to the Profession\\", in which he criticised the treatments used by the other physicians.The New Hampshire Journal of Medicine (March 1852) p. 188Hosack (1851).

Family and early life Shaw came from a famous and moneyed Boston family. With a net worth of $1,000,000 dollars in 1846, Shaw's father (Robert Gould Shaw, 17761853) was one of the wealthiest men in Boston. His mother was Elizabeth Willard Parkman (31 March 178514 April 1853), whose father Samuel Parkman (August 22, 1751June 11, 1824) was the original source of capital upon which her husband built one of the wealthiest and largest business enterprises in Boston at that time. George Parkman (February 19, 1790November 23, 1849), a wealthy Boston physician who was murdered in 1849 in a gruesome and highly publicized case, was Elizabeth's brother. Shaw was good friends with his cousin, American historian Francis Parkman Junior (September 16, 1823November 8, 1893), and the pair travelled together to the American West after graduating from Harvard University in 1845. Parkman's 1849 book, The Oregon Trail: Sketches of Prairie and Rocky-Mountain Life is dedicated to Shaw. Shaw's older brother Francis George Shaw (October 23, 1809November 7, 1882) was an outspoken advocate of the abolition of slavery.An old abolitionist dead: Francis George Shaw and his services in the cause of freedom. New York Times, November 9, 1882. Shaw's nephew, son of Francis George, was Robert Gould Shaw (October 10, 1837July 18, 1863). The latter was a colonel in the Volunteer Army of the United States during the American Civil War, and commander of the all-black 54th Regiment. Colonel Robert Gould Shaw was killed in action during the Second Battle of Fort Wagner in 1863. Later life On November 30, 1860, Shaw married Pauline Agassiz (February 6, 1841 ‚Äì February 10, 1917), daughter of Louis Agassiz and the step daughter of Elizabeth Cabot Cary. They had five children: Pauline, Marian, Louis Agassiz Shaw, Sr. (September 18, 1861 ‚Äì July 2, 1891), Quincy Adams (July 30, 1869 ‚Äì May 8, 1960), and Robert Gould II (1873‚Äì1930). Shaw's grandson, Louis Agassiz Shaw, Jr., is credited along with Philip Drinker for inventing the Drinker respirator, the first widely used iron lung. Career Shaw and his brother- in-law Henry Lee Higginson (18341919) became major investors in the Calumet and Hecla Mining Company, and Shaw was the first president of the company. Shaw retained that position for only a few months before Alexander Emanuel Agassiz (another brother-in-law) took over.

Launched in 2002, La Cucaracha has become one of the most controversial in the history of American comic strips. Alcaraz was born in 1964 in San Diego, California, and grew up on the U.S.‚ÄìMexico border, giving him a dual outlook on life (not \\"Mexican\\" enough for his relatives, not \\"American\\" enough for some in the U.S.). He attended San Diego State University, where he received his bachelor's degree \\"With Distinction\\" in Art and Environmental Design in 1987. In 1991, Alcaraz earned his master's degree in architecture from the University of California, Berkeley. A leading figure in the Chicano movement, Alcaraz formerly contributed political cartoons for LA Weekly from 1992 to 2010. He co-hosts a radio show on KPFK called the \\"Pocho Hour of Power\\". Alcaraz is also the \\"Jefe-in-Chief\\" of POCHO.COM, a website specializing in \\"√ëews y Satire.\\" Career In addition to the daily strip, Alcaraz has published four books. Alcaraz is also an active speaker on the college circuit. He is represented by The Agency Group in Los Angeles. Alcaraz taught as a faculty member at Otis College of Art & Design. He serves on the editorial advisory board of the Latin American and Latinx literature, philosophy, and arts journal Chiric√∫ Journal: Latina/o Literatures, Arts, and Cultures. Alcaraz was Consulting Producer and Writer on the Seth MacFarlane‚Äìexecutive produced animated show (created by Family Guy show runner Mark Hentemann) Bordertown, which ran one 13-episode season on Fox. It featured the first animated Mexican-American or even Latino family on primetime American television. Lalo Alcaraz also served as producer along with Gustavo Arellano on comedian Al Madrigal's TV special for Fusion, Half Like Me. In 2015, Pixar hired Alcaraz to consult on Coco (2017). (See Dia De Los Muertos controversy below.) He is also a TV animation producer and consultant on The Casagrandes on Nickelodeon. Alcaraz is also a performer, voicing an angry mariachi in Pixar's \\"Coco\\" (2017) and has portrayed a Mexican bounty hunter named \\"Royce Vargas\\" in the Bill Plympton/Jim Lujan animated feature film, Revengeance (2017). Activism In response to the Walt Disney corporation's attempt to trademark Dia de Los Muertos for the Pixar film set in Mexico, Coco, Alcaraz helped lead a social activist campaign which eventually led to Disney's abandoning the idea. In particular, Alcaraz's \\"Muerto Mouse\\" (itself an offshoot of his early \\"Migra Mouse\\") criticized the Disney campaign with the byline \\"It's coming to trademark your cultura.\\" He is the creator of \\"Daniel D. Portado\\", a satirical Hispanic character who in 1994 called on Mexican immigrants to return south‚Äî\\"reverse immigration\\"‚Äîas a response to the controversial Proposition 187. In 2012, Daniel D. Portado returned to the headlines as a result of Mitt Romneys call, during his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, on undocumented immigrants to exercise \\"self-deportation.\\" He contributed a work of art to the 2008 Obama campaign called \\"Viva Obama\\". He worked with The Lincoln Project during the campaign for the 2020 United States presidential election.

He was traditionally educated in Mississippi and finished his schooling at the Chamberlain-Hunt Academy. From there, Moffett went on to pursue a collegiate academic path in history, earning an A.B. degree from Davidson CollegeBaumann, 2003 p. 157 as well as going on to pursue higher education at Duke University where he earned a M.A. degree and Ph.D. degree in English history.Wilford 1995, p. B8 Between 1956 and 1974 Moffett was an educator at various institutions, including Alma College and Charlotte Country Day School.Baumann 2003, p. 157 While working as an assistant professor at the University of Massachusetts Boston William became involved in several roles at the campus‚Äô library that influenced him to go and earn a Master of Library Science from Simmons College in Boston. Moffett eventually moved on from a lack of teaching opportunities to a newly burgeoning field in libraries, a field which would define the remainder of his career. He first worked as an academic librarian at the Crumb Library of the State University of New York (SUNY) College at Potsdam. Here he combined his past experiences in education with librarianship, incorporating library instruction at the university. Oberlin College and Library Security Eventually, Moffett moved to a new post at Oberlin College where from 1979-1990 he occupied the position of Azariah Smith Root Director of Libraries. During this time, he embraced the emergence of technology, being the first library to install the online catalog of the Online Computer Library Center.Baumann 2003, p. 158 He was also very invested in taking steps to make the library the heart of the Oberlin campus. Much to his colleagues‚Äô dismay Moffett was well known to be persnickety about furniture placement in order to create an inviting environment for library patrons. William Andrew Moffett's name rose to fame in April 1981 when he helped capture a renowned book thief who was discovered to have stolen $50,000 worth of material from various libraries.Baumann 2003, p. 159 Library security was an ongoing passion for Moffett as he came to be known as a specialist in the field.Evan 1994, p. 36 He worked to establish the Rare Books and Manuscripts (RBMS) division of the ACRL which was a pioneering organization in library security, helping to connect institutions and warn of potential and reoccurring thefts.Evan 1994, p. 37 The RBMS, as well as Moffett's expertise in the field of library security, helped the Federal Bureau of Investigation to capture and convict Stephen Blumberg in one of the largest cases of library theft in modern history.Quinn & Rogers 1991a, p. 19 Moffett shared the credit for the book thief's capture, publishing an editorial and giving detailed recognition to his peers who had helped in the capture in his article ‚ÄúCredit due and overdue‚Äù. Huntington Library and the Dead Sea Scrolls After working for over a decade at Oberlin College, Moffett moved on to become the Director of the Huntington Library in San Marino, California in 1990. On September 22, 1991, Moffett's name was splashed across newspaper headlines yet again when he announced the Huntington Library's decision to open access to over 3000 photographic negatives of the Dead Sea Scrolls for scholarly use. Israel Antiquities Authority had reserved tight control over who was allowed access to the Scrolls since the discovery of the historic artifacts.Gaughan 1991, p. 926 Moffett believed that allowing access to the study of such a historic importance was vital and what libraries were all about.Quinn & Rogers 1991b, p. 15 Moffett's modest response to being at the head of such a controversial decision was: ‚ÄúI maintain that what we‚Äôre doing is no more than other librarians are doing day ‚Äì collecting, preserving, and providing access‚Äù.Quinn & Rogers 1991a, p. 15 Death and legacy Moffett died on February 20, 1995 from cancer of the bladder. His legacy was not just limited to sensational stories found in headlines. His intelligence and charm created a lasting impact on his peers and colleagues.Colleagues 1995, p. 383 The Association of College and Research Libraries passed a memorial resolution honoring William Moffett upon his deathDavis 1995, p. 232 and the auditorium at the Oberlin College Library was named in his honor.

In addition, Corsica passed from the Republic of Genoa to France in 1768, and the county of Nice and Savoy from the Kingdom of Sardinia to France in 1860. According to Robin Cohen, \\"about 5 million French nationals are of Italian origin if their parentage is retraced over three generations\\". According to official data of the Eurostat for 2012, the number of Italian citizens residing in France was 174,000. History of Italians in France =Middle Ages and Renaissance= There has always been migration, since ancient times, between what is today Italy and France. This is especially true of the regions of northwestern Italy and southeastern France. As Italian wealth and influence grew during the Middle Ages, many Florentine, Genoese, Neapolitan, Piedmontese and Venetian traders, bankers and artisans settled, usually through family branches, throughout France. Regions of significant Italian diaspora sprang up as far north as Paris and Flanders. However it was not much as a percentage of the French global population. This Italian migration developed more through the Renaissance, as previous generations became assimilated. Italian artists, writers and architects were called upon by the French monarchy and aristocrats, leading to a significant interchange of culture, but it was not a massive immigration of popular classes. Since the 16th century, Florence and its citizens have long enjoyed a very close relationship with France.Project MUSE ‚Äì Renaissance Quarterly ‚Äì Savonarola in Francia: Circolazione di un'eredit√† politico-religiosa nell'Europa del Cinquecento (review). Muse.jhu.edu. Retrieved on 2011-07-04. In 1533, at the age of fourteen, Catherine de' Medici married Henry, the second son of King Francis I and Queen Claude of France. Under the gallicised version of her name, Catherine de M√©dici, she became Queen consort of France when Henry ascended to the throne in 1547. Later on, after Henry died, she became regent on behalf of her ten-year-old son King Charles IX and was granted sweeping powers. After Charles died in 1574, Catherine played a key role in the reign of her third son, Henry III. Other notable examples of Italians that played a major role in the history of France include Cardinal Mazarin, born in the Kingdom of Naples was a cardinal, diplomat and politician, who served as the chief minister of France from 1642 until his death in 1661. Mazarin succeeded his mentor, Cardinal Richelieu, and extended France's political ambitions not only within Italy but towards England as well. Enrico Tonti, born near Gaeta, Italy (1649/50 - 1704) was an Italian- born soldier, explorer, and fur trader in the service of France. He was the son of Lorenzo de Tonti, a financier and former governor of Gaeta. Enrico was second in command of the La Salle expedition on his descent of the Mississippi River. Tonti's letters and journals are valuable source materials on these explorations. Enrico's brother, Pierre Alphonse de Tonti, or Alphonse de Tonty, Baron de Paludy (ca. 1659 ‚Äì 10 November 1727)[1] was an officer who served under the French explorer Cadillac and helped establish the first European settlement at Detroit, Michigan, Fort Pontchartrain du Detroit on the Detroit River in 1701. Several months later, both Cadillac and Tonty brought their wives to the fort, making them the first European women to travel into the interior of North America. He was the son of Lorenzo de Tonti who was a financier and former governor of Gaeta. Lorenzo de Tonti was the inventor of the form of life insurance known as the tontine. Henri de Tonti, involved in LaSalle's exploration of the Mississippi River and the establishment of the first settlement in Arkansas, was his older brother. =Modern period= Napoleon Bonaparte, French emperor and general, was ethnically Italian of Corsican origin, whose family was of Genoese and Tuscan ancestry. Italian popular immigration to France only began in the late 18th century, really developed from the end of the 19th century until the World War I and became quite massive after this war. France needed workforce to compensate for the war losses and its very low birthrate. Initially, Italian immigration to modern France (late 18th to the early 20th century) came predominantly from northern Italy (Piedmont, Veneto), then from central Italy (Marche, Umbria), mostly to the bordering southeastern region of Provence. It wasn't until after World War II that large numbers of immigrants from southern Italy immigrated to France, usually settling in industrialised areas of France, such as Lorraine, Paris and Lyon. Autochthonous populations In both the County of Nice, parts of Savoy, \\"Italian\\" can refer to autochthonous speakers of Italian dialects (Ligurian and Piedmontese languages), natives in the region since before annexation to France, and also to descendants of Italians that migrated to the areas when they were part of Italian states. The number of inhabitants with Italian ancestry is generally indeterminable, and the use of French language is now ubiquitous. In addition, Corsica was a part of the Republic of Genoa until 1768 and many Corsicans speak along with French the Corsican language, closely related to the Tuscan dialect of Italian.

He was the second son of Xiao'ao, and brother of former ruler Fenmao whom he is rumored to have murdered in 740 BC in order to usurp the throne. He was also the first ruler among Zhou's vassal states to style himself \\"king\\"; Chu was one of a few states whereby its rulers declared themselves kings during the Spring and Autumn period. Other states include Wu and Yue. Life King Wu married a daughter of the ruler of Deng called Deng Man () and installed Dou Bobi (), son of Ruo'ao as Prime Minister and his son Qu Xia () as Mo'ao. With the power of Chu growing by the day, King Wu became dissatisfied with the title of Viscount () and sought to better himself. In the summer of the thirty-seventh year of his reign, 704 BCE, at the time of King Huan of Zhou, he invited the leaders of the other vassal states to a meeting at Shenlu (). The states of Ba, Pu (), Deng, Jiao (), Luo (), Zhen (), Shen, Er (), Yun () and Jiang () all sent representatives with only the States of Huang and Sui () not in attendance. King Wu‚Äôs minister Wei Zhang () was dispatched to Huang to criticize their non-attendance whilst the King and Qu Xia led an army to attack the State of Sui.¬∑ Eighth Year of Duke Huan of Lu (È≤ÅÊ°ìÂÖ¨ÂÖ´Âπ¥) Sui was overthrown at the Battle of Suqi (). The state's leader fled whilst Chu Minister Dou Dan () captured the Marquess of Sui‚Äôs chariot along with the chariot division military commander. Thereafter, Sui did not act rashly again. Xiong Che declared himself ‚ÄúKing‚Äù, marking Chu‚Äôs formal independence from the Zhou Dynasty. Subsequent rulers of Chu would all style themselves ‚ÄúKing‚Äù, heralding the start of the vassal kingdoms‚Äô usurpation of Zhou supremacy and the decline of the House of Zhou. In 700 BCE, the forty-first year of his reign, the Chu army defeated the State of Jiao which subsequently became a vassal of Chu. The following year, King Wu sent his son Qu Xia to attack the State of Luo. Qu Xiao underestimated the enemy and became trapped between Lu Nomads () and the Luo army on the borders of the state. Qu Xia suffered a major defeat and fled with his remaining troops to Huangyu () where he hanged himself. King Wu took responsibility for the defeat and pardoned all remaining soldiers who had taken part in the battle, although he already ordered the amputation of their right feet. In 690 BCE, King Wu led his troops on a punitive expedition into the State of Sui. After crossing the Han River and arriving on the eastern bank, he was suddenly taken ill. He sat down under a tree and died not long afterwards. The Chu Prime Minister Dou Qi (), son of Dou Dan did not hold a funeral, but instead led the Chu army on the advance westward as originally planned. When the Chu army arrived at the capital of the State of Sui, its rulers capitulated and swore allegiance to Chu. The Chu army withdrew across the Han River where they held a funeral for the late king. Thereafter, his son Xiong Zi ascended the throne as King Wen of Chu.

Included applications are limited to popular or common applications. * Snap-Shot: Take \\"snapshots\\" of an example system's state before and after the target application is installed. * Manual configuration: Manually configure the registry, sandbox, and other portions of the target application. This approach typically requires an experienced programmer. Users can then define other application behavior, such as setting an application to expire on a certain date, or to make the application run on a portable storage device (USB drive). Limitations * Windows only applications: ZENworks Application Virtualization is limited to the Windows operating system for both building and running virtualized applications. * Does not always fix compatibility: ZENworks Application Virtualization can address application compatibility problems in some cases, but should not be used as a primary means to solving operating system compatibility.

The novel was published on 18 September 2010 by Delacorte Press. It follows The Maze Runner, and is followed by The Death Cure. A film adaptation was released on 18 September 2015 by 20th Century Fox.  Plot  The book starts with Thomas sleeping in the dormitory with the other teenagers, known as the Gladers, who escaped from the Maze in the previous book and had been brought by a group of rescuers. Thomas is woken by a telepathic communication with Teresa, the only girl from the Glade, who is afraid. As Thomas wakes up, he finds that the facility is being attacked by Cranks, aggressive zombie-like people that have been affected by a plague known as the Flare. The disease attacks the brain and causes victims to lose their humanity and to become crazy. Cranks were normal citizens before the Flare, when they became crazed zombie-like killers. Thomas and the others escape into the facility's common area and discover that their rescuers are dead. They also find thst Teresa is missing from her room, and in her place is a boy, Aris Jones. Aris explains he escaped from a similar Maze experiment, Group B, in which he was the only male. The boys then discover tattoos on their necks that assign them specific roles and fates. The Gladers re-enter the common area and find that the bodies of their rescuers have disappeared. Since nothing has changed, the Gladers almost die of starvation. Thomas takes a rest and after waking up, he finds Minho with an apple. They also find a scientist from WICKED, Janson. He is described by the boys as Rat Man because of his rat-like appearance, and he explains WICKED has been studying them to try to find a cure for the Flare. He tells them they have been infected with the Flare and in two weeks must get through the Scorch, the most burned-out section of the Earth after the sun flares to find a safe haven and get the cure. To get into the Scorch, the Gladers go through a Flat Trans, which is a type of portal that closes five minutes after the set hour. The Gladers travel to the Scorch through the Flat Trans and find themselves in a tunnel filled with metal slicing mechanisms that kills at least two Gladers and nearly died the same to Winston. They escape into the desert and find a building in which a girl is screaming. Thomas discovers that the screaming is artificial and enters the building to find Teresa, who kisses him and tells him that he needs to stay away from her. As the Gladers search for supplies, Thomas begins to recover memories of the relationship that he had with Teresa before his memories were removed. They find a city but are caught in a storm that kills Winston, Jack, and several other boys. They take refuge in a building and find a group of Cranks led by a man named Jorge. Minho attacks Jorge and sentences him to death before Thomas talks him out of it. Thomas also convinces Jorge and his second-in-command, the teenage girl Brenda, to help the Gladers escape in exchange for some of the cure. Thomas and Brenda get separated from the rest of the group, and Thomas discovers a message written all over the city that says that he is the real leader. After a quick meal, the group is attacked and separated. Thomas and Brenda are then suddenly captured by another group of Cranks, which drugs them. Brenda tries to kiss Thomas before they pass out, but he refuses her advances because of his feelings for Teresa and tells Brenda that she could never be Teresa. Minho rescues them with the help of the other Gladers, but Thomas is shot in the shoulder with a rusty bullet that leads to an infection. Thomas's wounds get worse, and WICKED takes him aboard a flying vehicle, called a Berg, to heal his infection. A healed Thomas is returned to the Gladers, where Thomas explains that WICKED never wanted him to get shot and considers him very important to its plans. Thomas later receives a telepathic message from Teresa that warns him something terrible is about to happen, and she cannot help him. The Gladers come across Group B, now led by Teresa. Group B takes Thomas prisoner, and Teresa says that she plans to kill him. Some of the other Group B girls tell Thomas that Teresa had never liked him and that their earlier kiss had been against her will. The girls, Harriett and Sonya, tell Thomas that they are not going to kill him and that Teresa is unhappy about the situation. Later, Teresa comes to Thomas with Aris. Teresa and Aris kiss, and she explains that she has been manipulating Thomas all along. They lock Thomas in a room, where he passes out. While unconscious, he remembers some of his past relationship with Teresa and Aris before he entered the Maze. Eventually, Thomas is rescued by Aris and Teresa, who explain that they were forced by WICKED to make Thomas feel totally betrayed and that if they had not complied, WICKED would have killed him. Thomas is conflicted and no longer trusts them. The Gladers and Group B reach the place that the safe haven is supposed to be, but they are attacked by monsters created by WICKED until another Berg arrives from WICKED. They fight their way on board. WICKED, however, will allow either Jorge or Brenda to board, and the one not chosen to stay will be killed. Thomas chooses Brenda in the hope that WICKED will take whoever he does not choose. When it fails to do so, he overpowers the guard and forces him at gunpoint to allow both of them to remain on the Berg. The guard agrees and telld them that it was yet another test. Later, as they rest, Teresa communicates telepathically with Thomas, who awakens separated from his friends in a plain white room and after he was left in isolation for a long time. Teresa tells him telepathically that the others are being told he has succumbed to the Flare. Still not trusting her, Thomas tells Teresa to leave him alone. She tells him \\"WICKED is good\\" before she cuts off communication. The epilogue is in the form of an email from Chancellor Ava Paige, who writes that WICKED will soon tell the Gladers whether or not they are immune to the Flare. Characters * Thomas: The main protagonist of the series. A teenage boy who is a Runner in the Glade. He discovered he had a part in helping WICKED and building the Maze when he was stung by a Griever. He has the ability to speak telepathically with Aris and Teresa. The tattoo on the back of his neck given to him by WICKED researchers says, \\"To be killed by Group B\\". Thomas struggles with many conflicts throughout the book, such as becoming the real leader, being betrayed by Teresa, and most importantly, surviving the Scorch. This causes him to become confused and hurt. * Teresa Agnes: Loves Thomas and was Thomas's best friend before the Glade. She can speak telepathically with Thomas and Aris. She spends much of the novel with Group B, of which she becomes the leader. She gets under the control of WICKED at times, which makes it difficult for Thomas to trust her. She was to be known as \\"The Betrayer\\". * Newt: A boy with long, blonde hair. He has a slight limp, and is Thomas and Minho's friend. The tattoo on the back of his neck designates him as \\"The Glue\\". * Minho: A teenage boy who was the Keeper of the Runners in the Glade. He is aggressive and stubborn, which gets him in trouble frequently. He is friends with Newt, Thomas, and the other Gladers. The tattoo on the back on his neck shows WICKED intended for him to be \\"The Leader\\". *Frypan: A boy who escaped the maze. He was the Glade's cook and is always careful with food. He is described as dark skinned and hairy with a beard though he is still a teenager. * Aris Jones: Another boy who was involved with WICKED before the Maze. His role in his group was similar to that of Teresa's. He can speak telepathically with Thomas and Teresa and his best friend, Rachel, who was killed when Group B escaped their Maze. The tattoo on his neck designates him as \\"The Partner\\". * Jorge: A man who presents himself as the leader of the Cranks. He appears to be dangerous and psychotic, yet also humorous. He is a father-figure towards Brenda. He helps the Gladers to get past the Scorch and expects a cure for himself and Brenda. * Brenda: A girl from Canada who was turning into a Crank. Both Jorge and Brenda help lead the Gladers through the Scorch. Brenda leads Thomas after they become separated from the rest of the group. * Janson (Rat Man): The first WICKED researcher to identify himself to the Gladers. He informs them that they are infected with the Flare and how to get its cure. * Ava Paige: The chancellor of WICKED who is responsible for arranging for teenagers to be sent to the Maze for study into research for a cure for the Flare. Film adaptation On October 11, 2013, it was reported that Fox had acquired the rights to The Scorch Trials. A screenplay was to be written by T.S. Nowlin, with director Wes Ball supervising the scriptwriting. The film was titled Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials. On 25 July 2014 Ball announced at San Diego Comic-Con International that they wanted to start shooting in Fall 2014 should its predecessor become a success when it hit the theaters in September 2015; also unveiling a concept image at the conference - which implied that he will be directing the sequel as well. However, two weeks prior to the film's release 20th Century Fox decided to move ahead with the sequel and pre-production as well as prepping the sets began in early September 2014 in New Mexico. Director Wes Ball was set to return, as were actors Dylan O'Brien, Ki Hong Lee, Thomas Brodie- Sangster, Kaya Scodelario. On 26 September 2014, The Hollywood Reporter reported that Aidan Gillen was signed in to play the antagonist, Rat Man in the sequel. On 1 October 2014, it was announced that Rosa Salazar and Jacob Lofland had signed to play Brenda and Aris Jones, respectively. On 3 October 2014, it was announced that Giancarlo Esposito was to play Jorge in the film.

Upon his death in 1968, she received a large trove of materials relating to Franz Kafka, Brod's friend. Some of these were sold but most were controversially passed, unreleased to the public, to her two daughters after her own death. She was born in Troppau (Opava). Biography Hoffe and her husband Otto met Max Brod in Israel soon after he had escaped Prague ahead of the Nazi invasion of the rest Czechoslovakia in March 1939. After the death of Brod's wife in 1942, he grew very close to Hoffe. The three took vacations together and Esther became Brod's secretary, with an office in his apartment. The relationship has been described by many who knew them as \\"m√©nage √† trois\\", although romantic connections were never publicly acknowledged and to this day Esther's daughter Eva maintains that no such relationship existed. Esther was Brod's caretaker as his health declined, and upon his death in 1968 stewardship of his trove of Kafka materials and his own papers passed to her. Because of differing interpretations of Brod's final wishes, it is not clear if she was a beneficiary who gained ownership of the papers, or an executor responsible for eventually fulfilling Brod's intent to hand the papers over to the National Library of Israel. The unclear nature of Esther's rights did not preclude her from selling some of Kafka's papers. In 1974, approximately 22 letters and 10 postcards from Kafka to Brod were sold in private sales, it is presumed by Hoffe, to buyers in Germany. The next year, she was arrested at the Tel Aviv airport on suspicion that she was attempting to remove original manuscripts without first filing photocopies with the National Archives, as required by law. Upon search, photocopies of Kafka's letters and purportedly an original diary by Brod were found in her luggage. In 1988, she auctioned at least one more item from the Kafka papers: an original manuscript of The Trial, which brought approximately $2 million. The rare sales notwithstanding, in the 40 years between Brod's death and her own, Hoffe maintained a close hold on the papers. They were inventoried by an official archivist in the aftermath of her arrest, but this inventory is believed to be very incomplete, especially as many of the papers were out of the country in Swiss bank deposit boxes. A philologist named Bernhard Echte worked with Hoffe in the 1980s and may have produced the most complete inventory, but copies of this are difficult to obtain.

THE HERBERT REVEALS ALL Coventry Telegraph 30 October 2008 Herbert Art Gallery and Museum, Coventry. Medieval German face jug A face jug is a jug pottery that depicts a face. There are examples in the pottery of ancient Greece, and that of Pre-Columbian America. Early European examples date from the 13th century, and the German stoneware Bartmann jug was a popular later medieval and Renaissance form. Later, the British Toby Jug was a popular form, that became mass-produced. Especially in America, a number of modern craft potters make pieces, mostly continuing the 19th-century African-American slave folk art tradition. The Jug in the Form of a Head, Self-Portrait (1899) by Paul Gauguin is a rare fine art example. Early forms =England= During the 13th century, craftsmen outside of London became more decorative in their style, creating more anthropomorphic vessels that would characterize medieval face jugs.Spencer, Brian. \\"Medieval Face-Jug (The London Museum).\\" The Burlington Magazine 111, no. 794 (1 May 1969): 303‚Äì302. In the 1600s full-body vessels supposedly modeled after Edward Vernon, also known as Admiral Vernon. These pieces came to be known as British Toby Jugs.N., J. G. \\"Old English Pottery.\\" The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs 58, no. 335 (1 February 1931): 98. =Africa= African Nkisi dolls, native to the Congo, were considered both object and human. These dolls were made with many different materials including clay. They came to America transported through slave trade, and are found more commonly in Latin American regions. The vessels are full figured pieces characterized by the same exaggerated human features often seen on African-American face jugs. Many rituals associated with Nkisi dolls are used either to aid or to harm a person or other living creature that the dolls play a stand-in role for, or as an extension of a spiritual leader, or as a being that stores spiritual energy.Young, Jason R. Rituals of Resistance: African Atlantic Religion in Kongo and the Lowcountry South in the Era of Slavery. LSU Press, 2011. =America= Some of the best-known vessels come from North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia, made by African-American slaves in the mid-1800s. Though the jugs' exact purposes are unknown, many scholars believe they have either practical or spiritual value. Other names associated with African-American face jugs are grotesque jars, monkey jars, or face jars.\\"Encyclopedia Smithsonian: American Face Vessels.\\" Accessed 13 September 2014. http://www.si.edu/Encyclopedia_SI/nmah/facevess.htm. Modern interpretations started appearing in the same regions during the 1940s. Face jugs were fully functional pieces that served the practical purpose of holding and pouring liquid. Various slave owner accounts hold that African-American slaves would use their face jugs to carry water into the fields with them.Watch Now: History Detectives Face Jug. Accessed 10 September 2014. http://video.pbs.org//video/1918318256 Other scholars believe that face jugs were used as a form of self-identification, or a self-portrait and perhaps were a way for slaves to deal with their physical displacement and loss of visual worth.Hall, James. The Self-Portrait: A Cultural History. Thames & Hudson, 2014. Some folklore accounts held that these jugs were used for spiritual, rather than practical, purposes. It is believed that the jugs were buried outside of front and back doors to scare spirits away. It is also claimed that these jugs were used as grave markers and placed atop burial sites surrounded with the possessions of the deceased. As folk art, face jugs have become a significant feature in the history of African-American art. Because formal ceramic skills to create face jugs were taught after America gained its independence, they are regarded as some of the first truly American pieces.Patton, Sharon F. African-American Art. Oxford University Press, Incorporated, 1998. Because of their interesting physical characteristics and historical context behind them, face jugs are important examples of African- American art and as the start of a theme of self-identification that would carry into the future.Dover, Cedric. American Negro Art. New York Graphic Society, 1967. Some use these vessels may have been as political symbols. Most famously, it is believed that Dave the Potter, a slave who worked in the Miles mill where face jugs were made, was himself protesting against his status through ceramic pieces.

Given a metal hull,Archibald (1971), p. 43. its frame was composed of iron or steel.Osbon (1963), pp. 195, 196. Its hull had copper sheathing over timber beneath the waterline, but that timber simply served to separate the iron hull from the copper sheathing so as to prevent electrolytic corrosion.Lyon (1980), pp. 35‚Äì36. The timber extended to the upper deck; it was in two layers from the keel to 3 ft (.9 m) above the water line, and one layer above.Osbon (1963), p. 196. It was fitted with 3-cylinder compound engines with one high-pressure cylinder of diameter being flanked by two low-pressure cylinders of diameter. The bow above the waterline was nearly straight, in contrast to that of wooden sailing ships. It had stern galleries, similar to older frigates, but the ports were false, and there were no quarter galleries.Osbon (1963), p. 195. Boats were carried both amidships and at the stern.Archibald (1971), p. 49 (drawing).

Naval Institute Press, Annapolis. . Between its two complete decks was the open quarterdeck, on which the battery was located. Under the lower deck were spaces for water, provisions, coal, and magazines for shell and powder. Amidships were the engine and boiler rooms. These were covered by an armoured deck, 1.5 inches (38 mm) thick and approximately 100 ft (30 m) long. This armour was about 3 ft (90 cm) below the lower deck, and the space between could be used for additional coal bunkerage. The machinery spaces were flanked by coal bunkers, affording the machinery and magazines some protection from the sides. The lower deck was used for berthing of the ship's company; officers aft, warrant and petty officers forward, and ratings amidships, as was traditional. The tops of the coal bunkers, which projected above deck level, were used for seating at the mess tables. The living spaces were well- ventilated and an improvement over prior vessels.Osbon (1963), pp. 195‚Äì98.

Forum members bring a broad base of experience in Software Defined Radio, Cognitive Radio and Dynamic Spectrum Access technologies in diverse markets and at all levels of the wireless value chain to address emerging wireless communications requirements. The forum acts as a venue for its members to collaborate to achieve these objectives. History The Wireless Innovation Forum was founded in 1996 originally as \\"The Modular Multifunction Information Transfer System Forum\\". The organization was created at the request of the US military services (led by the Air Force) as an industry association focused on advancing the development of software radio. In 1996, the forum formed the Mobile Working Group to develop software specifications and standards supporting ground mobile radios. The forum published its first technical report in 1997, outlining the current state of the art in software defined radio. This document included a reference application framework for software defined radios, referred to as the Software Radio Architecture, that was developed based on the existing SPEAKeasy Architecture. The late 1990s, also saw the initial meeting between the forum and what later became the Joint Tactical Radio System. In 1998, the Modular Multifunction Information Transfer System Forum changed its legal name to The Software Defined Radio Forum and began doing business with a broader focus on commercial and international participation. The forum created three new internal groups ‚Äî Markets and Regulatory Committees and the Base Station Work Group. Also, the forum published a revised technical report. In 2001, the forum contracted with Communications Research Centre Canada to provide an SCA Reference Implementation (SCARI-Open). The forum also made filings with the United States Federal Communications Commission that helped form their public rule making on software defined radio. In 2002, the forum hosted its first Technical Conference and Product Exposition, which has become an annual event with the presentation of technical papers along with tutorials, workshops and demonstrations.; In 2004 and 2005, the forum reorganized to support its members in exploring technologies that extend beyond it. A key part of this reorganization was the formation of the Cognitive Radio Work Group, which worked to support IEEE P1900.1 in defining standard definitions for Software Defined and Cognitive Radio and to establish a reference architecture for a cognitive radio system.; Between 2004 and 2010, the forum signed memorandums of understanding with multiple international groups to allow collaboration in areas of mutual interest. These groups included the European End to End Efficiency Program, IEICE in Japan, IEEK in Korea, IEEE Standards Association, JTRS and the European Science Foundation.; In 2007, the forum initiated the Smart Radio Challenge, a worldwide competition in which student engineering teams design, develop and test technologies that address relevant problems in the advanced wireless market. In late 2009, the Software Defined Radio Forum was renamed the Wireless Innovation Forum, reflecting the fact that many of the projects undertaken by its members had expanded to include Cognitive Radio, Systems of Systems, Ad Hoc Networks, and Dynamic Spectrum Access Technologies. The forum secured representation in China in 2008 and opened an office in Brussels in 2010 to provide better support for its European members.; Mission and strategy The Forum's current mission is to \\"advance technologies supporting the innovative utilization of spectrum and the development of wireless communications systems, including essential or critical communications systems\\".; The forum's members serve these objectives through four pillars of strategy: * Advocacy * Opportunity Development * Commercialization * Education Organizational structure The forum is organized around three primary committees, whose responsibilities are summarized as follows * The Spectrum Sharing Committee (SSC): This committee serves as a common industry and government standards body to support the development and advancement of spectrum sharing technologies based on the three-tier architecture proposed for the 3.5 GHz (CBRS Band) rulemaking activities. While the CBRS band is the main focus on the initial activities, the Wireless Innovation Forum aims to advance this technology for all applicable spectrum bands that can benefit from it. More information at http://cbrs.wirelessinnovation.org. * The Software Defined Systems (SDS) Committee: This committee focuses on projects in standards creation for software architectures, application programming interfaces, test and certification including defining an industry driven SCA evolution roadmap for the international community. * The Advanced Technologies Committee (ATC): The role of the ATC is to advocate for the innovative utilization of spectrum, and advancing radio technologies that support essential or critical communications; it defines and publishes the forum's \\"Top 10 Most Wanted Wireless Innovations\\" list, manages the Forum's Advocacy Agenda, and is responsible for investigating and launching new Forum projects. These committees are managed by the forum's elected officers, which include the chair, vice chair, technical director, the chairs of the User Requirements and Regulatory Committees, the secretary, and the treasurer according to the forum's bylaws. Organizational structure is available at http://www.wirelessinnovation.org/projects-committees. Membership The membership of the Wireless Innovation Forum consists of commercial, defense, and civil government organizations at all levels of the wireless value chain, including wireless service providers, network operators, component and equipment manufacturers, hardware and software developers, regulatory agencies, and academia.; Currently numbering more than 80, the Wireless Innovation Forum's membership spans Asia-Pacific (approximately 15%), Europe (approximately 25%), and North America (approximately 60%). Achievement awards Each year, the forum presents three achievement awards. * Wireless Innovation Forum Leadership Award (Replaces the International Achievement Award): This award is presented to an individual, group of individuals, or organization that made especially significant contributions in furthering the global mission of the Wireless Innovation Forum. * Wireless Innovation Forum President‚Äôs Award (Replaces the Contributors Award): This Award is presented to individuals in recognition of their sustained outstanding contributions in support of the Wireless Innovation Forum and its activities. * Wireless Innovation Forum Technology of the Year: This award is presented to an individual or organization for a breakthrough product or technology related to the WInnForum's top 10 most wanted innovation list (http://www.wirelessinnovation.org/top-ten-wireless-innovations).

The O'Byrne family () is an Irish clann that descend from Bran mac M√°elm√≥rda, King of Leinster, of the U√≠ Faelain of the U√≠ D√∫nlainge. Before the Norman invasion of Ireland they began to colonise south Wicklow. There are many famous people with this Irish last name. This includes Anna O‚ÄôByrne, an Australian singer and actress, and Anna Marie O‚ÄôByrne, an American model. History The seat of the most famous branch of the √ì Broin (U√≠ Broin or Branaigh) was at Ballinacor and controlled the surrounding lands, part of Crioch Branach. During the Desmond Rebellions, the warlord Hugh O'Byrne gave support to the Earl of Desmond, and died during the second rebellion. His son Fiach McHugh O'Byrne took over the chieftainship and together with the Pale lord James Eustace, 3rd Viscount Baltinglass, continued hostilities to the English administration. A large English force under the Lord Deputy of Ireland Earl Grey de Wilton was sent to subdue them, only to be ambushed and defeated at the battle of Glenmalure on 25 August 1580, losing over 800 dead. Feagh also helped in the escape of Hugh Roe O'Donnell from Dublin Castle in 1591 and Hugh Roe stayed with O'Byrne at Ballinacor, Glenmalure. In 1595, Ballinacor was occupied by an Tudor garrison, with Feagh later expelling the garrison, and destroying the fort. Feagh was betrayed and killed by the forces of the Lord Deputy of Ireland at Fananerin on 8 May 1597. He was drawn and quartered and his head was sent to Dublin Castle and placed on a spike. The head was later pickled and sent to England. Felim McFiach O'Byrne, Feagh's son, was confirmed in his fathers lands by patent of Queen Elizabeth after submitting to her authority, however these were lost under patent of King James I. He held the office of Member of Parliament (M.P.) for County Wicklow in 1613 and died in 1630. The O'Byrnes have long been close to their kinsmen the O'Toole family.

Early life Lush was born in New York City.. He attended King's College, earning a bachelor of arts in 1770 and a master's degree in 1773.. He was admitted to the bar in 1774, at the age of twenty-one, and moved to Albany to practice law and live with his brother, Richard.. Career After the start of the American Revolutionary War, he was elected to the Albany Committee of Correspondence in 1776. He served as a captain in the New York Volunteers in 1776, and then joined the Fifth New Jersey Regiment under Colonel Oliver Spencer, serving as acting judge advocate general in 1777. He attained the rank of major, and served as the aide-de-camp of General George Clinton. Clinton commanded Fort Montgomery, on the Hudson River; when the fort was taken by the British on October 6, 1777, Lush was captured. He was held prisoner for nearly a year, when he was used as bait in a proposed exchange of three prisoners; Clinton agreed without hesitation, unaware that one of the other American prisoners was actually a valuable British spy.. The spy was Abraham P. Mabie. After his release in 1778, Lush was appointed Clerk of the New York Court of Chancery. =Post-Revolutionary War= After the war, he moved to Albany and started a successful legal practice. He was elected to the New York Assembly in 1792 and 1793, and then to the New York Senate in 1800, representing the eastern senate district until 1803. He was elected again to the Assembly four more times, 1803 to 1806. Lush owned slaves as late as 1819; at one time, he had five in his house. Personal life In 1781, he married Lydia Stringer (died 1841), the daughter of prominent physician Samuel Stringer..

Wilson was head of the North American Division when elected on January 3, 1979, to take the place of the ailing former General Conference president Robert Pierson, who had resigned for reasons of health. He was succeeded as General Conference President on July 6, 1990, by Robert Folkenberg, who was then the president of the Carolina Conference of Seventh-day Adventists. Wilson died December 14, 2010. He was 90 years old.  Biography  Neal C. Wilson was president of the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists from 1979 to 1990. He received his elementary and secondary education, plus two years of college, in Zambia, Malawi, South Africa, and India. These were countries where his father served the Seventh-day Adventist Church in pastoral and administrative posts. Wilson is an alumnus of Pacific Union College in Angwin, California. Neal C. Wilson's son, Ted N. C. Wilson, would follow his father's footsteps and is the current president of the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists.  Presidency  As president, Wilson furthered the church's mission in the former Soviet Union two years before the fall of communism there, helping obtain permission to establish an Adventist seminary and administrative headquarters near Moscow in 1987. He also oversaw the 1980 adoption of the church's Fundamental Beliefs, the creation of Adventist World Radio, and oversaw the relocation of the denomination's world headquarters from Takoma Park, Maryland to its current location in Silver Spring. During his tenure, Wilson visited 170 countries where the church operated institutions of healthcare, education, evangelism and publishing. He was known to remember thousands of people, even after brief meetings. \\"I regard him as one of the outstanding leaders in the history of this church,\\" said Bill Johnsson, former editor of the Adventist Review. \\"I asked him once how he remembered people's names so well and he said he just made a point of it.\\" After retirement in 1990, Wilson served as an adviser to the denomination's Euro-Asia Division. The U.S. Department of State would periodically call him regarding situations in the Middle East based on his understanding of the region from a 15-year post in Egypt, Johnsson said. \\"He could have been a statesman or a diplomat but he chose to give his talents to the church and we were all blessed by that,\\" Johnsson said. Wilson served the church in Egypt from 1944 to 1958, first as a pastor and evangelist and later as the regional administrative president. He then worked as an administrator in California and Maryland before his appointment as president of the church's North American Division in 1966. He served in the post until his appointment as president of the denomination. Crisis Neal C. Wilson also appointed the Sanctuary Review Committee which was a group of biblical scholars and administrators which met to decide the church's response to theologian Desmond Ford, who had challenged details of the church's \\"investigative judgment\\" teaching. The meeting was held from 11‚Äì15 August 1980, at the Glacier View Ranch, a church- owned spiritual retreat and conference centre in Colorado, United States. Although the group produced and voted a Consensus Statement which Ford agreed to, Wilson ignored it and drew up a separate document emphasizing points of disagreement, which was circulated to administrators present only. As a result, Desmond Ford's credentials were revoked and was the cause of much controversy in the church, and the church experienced the largest exit of teachers and ministers in its history.

Results Aftermath William Hartnoll was elected in the by- election, receiving nearly 58 per cent of the vote. When opposition leader George Reid received a telegram from the Freetrade Association of Launceston informing him of Hartnoll's impending victory, he proclaimed \\"Thanks! Hartnoll's triumph overshadows the inevitable fate of the Barton Ministry.\\" Hartnoll's election was not without controversy. Under Tasmanian law, nominations from candidates were required to be signed by the candidate himself. Hartnoll's nomination paper was received and accepted by the Commonwealth electoral officer via telegram, and was not signed. J.C.

The petition was referred by the Prime Minister Edmund Barton to the Elections and Qualifications Committee of the House of Representatives. After hearing the evidence, committee chair Sir Edward Braddon announced that the committee had found that Hartnoll had \\"committed an irregularity\\" by nominating via telegram, but that it was not considered a sufficient reason for disturbing the election.

Research in his Materials Theory Group is fundamentally based on computer simulations of electronic motion governed by quantum physics and resulting electron-mediated inter-atomic interactions which are responsible for multi-scale behaviour of materials. Deriving material-specific information on chemical bonding and microscopic couplings that are essential to the specific properties of a material, they develop fundamental understanding of a material in terms of its atomic structure and electronic structure. The goal of their theoretical analysis is to derive material-specific properties on the macroscopic and intermediate length and time scales starting from a first principles description of chemistry and atomic structure. They complement experimental work by accessing the microscopic information that may be hard to access in a laboratory. Their work leads to design of new materials or modification of existing materials to yield desired properties, or narrowing down the choices of new materials for design by experiment. Recently, they have shown how techniques of machine learning can be constrained by dimensional analysis and physical laws to develop simple and predictive models that benefit from both the data and existing knowledge.

The Triad Center is a complex of office buildings in downtown Salt Lake City, Utah, United States. Originally planned as a large development, containing several office and residential buildings (including the tallest buildings in Utah), the project was canceled after only two phases were completed. It currently houses BYU‚ÄìPathway Worldwide, LDS Business College, the BYU Salt Lake Center, offices of the Deseret News and the studios of KSL-TV and KSL Radio. The landlord and prominent tenants are affiliated in one way or another with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. History Ground was broken for construction of the center on 1 June 1982, by Essam Khashoggi, chairman of Triad America. On the same day, plans for the 10-year-long development were publicly released. They called for the construction of a complex with a set of twin 40-story office towers, three 25-story residential towers, a hotel, farmers' market, ice rink, amphitheatre and a park. The complex was to be located on three city blocks in downtown Salt Lake City, and was planned to contain over of office space and of residential space. The first phase of construction was to last 18 months and to include construction of a broadcast house to hold the studios of KSL radio and television. The second phase was the construction of a 10-story office building, on the northern boundary of the project, known as the North Plaza Office. These buildings were to be constructed surrounding the historic Devereaux House, whose restoration was to be included in the project. On 12 July 1984, the broadcast house was officially opened, and the North Plaza Office building would soon be completed. During the years following the initial announcement of the development, plans for the remaining phases were scaled back. On 7 June 1985, ground was broken for the first 35-story office building (originally planned to be 40-stories), to be known as 1 Triad Center. 1 Triad Center was the last phase to go into construction, as financial problems put the remaining phases on hold. Excavation for its basement was begun, and steel for the skyscraper was delivered on site, but construction was soon halted.Skyscraper Forum - 1 Triad Center Within a year, the entire development was canceled, leaving only the Broadcast House, North Plaza Office and a parking structure completed. Had 1 Triad Center been completed it would have been the tallest building in Utah. Present day The Triad Center is owned by Utah Property Management Associates, a subsidiary of Deseret Management Corporation, the for-profit wing of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It was purchased by Zions Securities in 2004 from M&S; Triad Center, for an undisclosed amount. \\\\- The center is located across the street from The Gateway and Vivint Smart Home Arena and is near the City Creek Center development and Temple Square. The following are current tenants of the complex: * KSL-TV * KSL Radio * LDS Business College * BYU Salt Lake Center * BYU‚ÄìPathway Worldwide * Equitable Life & Casualty Insurance Company * A small number of suites are used by private stockbrokers and lawyers. In August 2010, Deseret News announced it would be moving its offices to the broadcast house in the center, so they could integrate with KSL's newsroom. On 2 August 2017, BYU‚ÄìPathway Worldwide announced that the Triad Center would become its new headquarters. 1999 shooting incidents On 14 January 1999, 24-year-old De Kieu Duy entered the center's broadcast house and began shooting. She fired numerous rounds in the building's lobby, injuring the building manager. She then rode the elevator to the upper floors where she fatally shot 30-year-old Anne Sleater, an AT&T; employee. Sleater's co-worker, Ben Porter, then wrestled Duy to the ground, ending the shooting spree. Duy was later found mentally incompetent to stand trial and is currently housed in the Utah State Hospital. Three months later, a second shooting, one block away, at the LDS Church Family History Library, led to the Triad Center being evacuated. During that shooting, a truck with a suspicious note was found parked near the Triad Center, and fears arose that the shooter or a possible accomplice had planted a bomb in the truck. Later that afternoon, Salt Lake City Police Department detonated an explosive charge attached to the truck, gaining access to its cargo. Inside, two drums, one empty and one containing gasoline, were found. It was later learned the truck driver and his cargo were not related to the shooting, and was it just a case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.

Intended for cinema and television advertisements, No Pressure is composed of scenes in which a variety of men, women and children in every-day situations are graphically blown to pieces for failing to be sufficiently enthusiastic about the 10:10 campaign to reduce CO2 emissions. The film's makers said that they viewed No Pressure as \\"a funny and satirical tongue-in-cheek little film in the over-the-top style of Monty Python or South Park\\". Before its release, The Guardian described it as \\"attention-grabbing\\" and \\"pretty edgy.\\" The film was withdrawn from public circulation by 10:10, on the same day it was released, due to negative publicity. Charities that had backed the film stated they were \\"absolutely appalled\\" upon seeing it, and several of 10:10's corporate and strategic partners withdrew from partnership. Background and production The film was made in an attempt to challenge the \\"no pressure\\" attitude often displayed both by governments and individuals towards taking real action on climate change. 10:10 highlighted the urgency of action with claims that carbon dioxide emissions must be stabilised by 2014 (within four years) in order to avoid disaster, and that \\"300,000 real people\\" are already killed by climate change annually. Lizzie Gillet, 10:10 global campaign director, explained: \\"With climate change becoming increasingly threatening, and decreasingly talked about in the media, we wanted to find a way to bring this critical issue back into the headlines while making people laugh. We were therefore delighted when Richard Curtis agreed to write a short film for the 10:10 campaign\\". The film was shot on a location at Camden School for Girls, in the London Borough of Camden in North London. According to 10:10, over 50 film professionals and more than 40 actors and extras provided their services at no cost. Synopsis The four-minute film consists of a series of short scenes in which groups of people are asked if they are interested in participating in the 10:10 project to reduce carbon emissions. Those failing to show enthusiasm for the cause are gruesomely blown to pieces. In the first scene, a bright and chirpy schoolteacher, played by Lyndsey Marshal, tells her class about the 10:10 campaign, and asks what they are doing to reduce their carbon footprint. She asks which students are planning to participate; most raise their hands, but two children shrug apathetically. The teacher reassures them that this is \\"fine, it's absolutely fine, it's your choice\\" and there is \\"no pressure\\", but then shifts the papers on her desk to reveal a red-buttoned detonator, which she presses. The two children who did not want to participate explode, covering their screaming classmates with blood and body parts. The blood-spattered teacher then goes on casually to explain the night's homework to her horrified charges. The second scene shows a group of white-collar workers in an office meeting. The office manager, played by Paul Ritter, similarly explains the purpose of the 10:10 campaign, and asks who will be participating. While most raise their hands, four raise their hands unconvinced. The manager reassures them that there is \\"no pressure\\" to participate, but he is then handed a detonator by an assistant, which he uses to blow up the four workers, splattering appalled co-workers with gore. The third scene is set on a football pitch during team training. The coach, played by David Ginola, asks the players to explain the 10:10 campaign that the team is participating in. They describe a range of energy- saving measures which have been implemented by the team and its fans. However, the coach remains unmoved, remarking the campaign would distract him from football. A player tells him that there's \\"no pressure\\", produces a detonator and blows him up. Unlike the witnesses depicted in previous scenes, the team is not at all surprised, and casually jogs away to resume training. A brief interlude with captions explains the campaign, accompanied by music from Radiohead. In the final scene, the actress Gillian Anderson is finishing the voice-over for the interlude just seen. The sound engineer asks her what she is planning to do to cut her carbon footprint. Anderson irritably remarks that she thought providing the recording was a sufficient contribution. The sound engineer repeats the film's catchphrase, \\"no pressure\\", and detonates Anderson before picking up to leave. The film ends with a shot of Anderson's gory remains sliding down the sound-booth window with the text \\"Cut your carbon by 10%. No pressure.\\" Reception Upon its release, No Pressure provoked an immediate negative reaction in the media, and the resulting controversy became widely referred to as \\"splattergate\\" by bloggers. In The Daily Telegraph, James Delingpole wrote that the film was an \\"ugly, counterproductive eco- propaganda movie\\" and that \\"with No Pressure, the environmental movement has revealed the snarling, wicked, homicidal misanthropy beneath its cloak of gentle, bunny-hugging righteousness\\". The ConservativeHome website described it as \\"crass, tasteless and unfunny as it gets\\", while Melanie Phillips in The Spectator commented on the intended humorous aspect of the film by writing that \\"The joke was only about blowing dissenters to bits and raining their flesh down on terrified people. Because exterminating human beings is acceptable to greens as a joke. From which we can only assume at best indifference towards and at worst a profound loathing of the human condition\\". American environmentalist and writer Bill McKibben lamented the film on the Climate Progress website, where he wrote \\"The climate skeptics can crow. It's the kind of stupidity that hurts our side, reinforcing in people's minds a series of preconceived notions, not the least of which is that we're out-of- control and out of touch‚Äînot to mention off the wall, and also with completely misplaced sense of humor\\". McKibben added \\"There's no question that crap like this will cast a shadow, for a time, over our efforts and everyone else who's working on global warming. McKibben subsequently withdrew as an organisational partner of 10:10. In The Independent, Dominic Lawson wrote \\"As often as 10:10 tried to pull the film off YouTube, their critics re-posted it. This, at least, proves what a cataclysmic misjudgement Curtis had made. When you try to satirise the critics of your campaign, and it turns out that those very critics embrace your film as demonstrating exactly what they find unbearable about the climate-obsessed eco-lobby, then you know that you have kicked the ball into your own net\\". The film generated a huge reaction in the blogosphere. One comment to The Guardian read: \\"To suggest that people who disagree with you deserve to die is incredibly stupid. Imagine if some Christian group in the US did that to gays, Muslims or anyone else they disagree with. The outrage would be palpable. And deserved.\\" The Guardian, which was a key collaborator with the 10:10 campaign since its launch and got exclusive rights to show the film premi√®re, responded to the criticism by stating that \\"the film may have been somewhat tasteless, but it was an imaginative attempt to challenge public apathy over climate change\\". This statement originally ended \\"and, highly unusually for attempts to communicate about this subject, funny too\\", but this was later redacted. A later report in the newspaper by Adam Vaughan said that the film, \\"intended as a tongue-in- cheek spoof of hectoring greens\\", had created a huge amount of global coverage for 10:10, in print and on the web. The report said that while many people had found the film hilarious, there was a \\"predictable slating from climate sceptics‚Äù as well as furious reactions from some environmentalists. The report also went on to describe other, more reflective responses, which had focused on effective communication, psychology, satire, and ways of engaging with various audiences over climate change. Withdrawal Although originally planned to be shown in cinema and television advertisements, 10:10 removed the film from their website and YouTube later on 1 October 2010. On Friday 2 October, 10:10 placed a notice on their website saying, \\"Many people found the resulting film extremely funny, but unfortunately some didn't and we sincerely apologise to anybody we have offended. [...] At 10:10 we're all about trying new and creative ways of getting people to take action on climate change. Unfortunately in this instance we missed the mark. Oh well, we live and learn.\\" This was criticised as a non-apology apology by Michelle Malkin in the Litchfield County Register and Andrew Revkin in an opinion piece in the New York Times. A spokesman for 10:10 also denied that the withdrawal had been planned from the beginning in order to generate publicity. After removing the video from YouTube, 10:10 issued a statement: \\"We won't be making any attempt to censor or remove other versions currently in circulation on the internet\\". Then, on Monday 5 October 10:10 director Eugenie Harvey issued a second, more comprehensive apology, stating: \\"We are... sorry to our corporate sponsors, delivery partners and board members, who have been implicated in this situation despite having no involvement in the film's production or release.\\" ActionAid, a charity which co-ordinates a schools programme with 10:10, approved the decision to withdraw the film, and stated \\"Our job is to encourage proactive decisions at class level to reduce carbon emissions. We did it because evidence shows children are deeply concerned about climate change and because we see the impacts of it in the developing world where a lot of our work is. So we think the 10:10 campaign is very important, but the moment this film was seen it was clear it was inappropriate.\\" In the wake of the film's withdrawal, Richard Curtis admitted that the attempt to draw attention to the cause of lowering emissions may have backfired. Curtis said \\"When you try to be funny on a serious subject, it's obviously risky. I hope people who don't like the little film will still think about the big issue and try to do something about it.\\" =Withdrawal of sponsors= Several sponsors withdrew their support of 10:10 as a result of the No Pressure film. Nick Sharples, Sony Europe's Director of Communications, issued a statement saying, \\"we strongly condemn the No Pressure video which was conceived, produced and released by 10:10 entirely without the knowledge or involvement of Sony\\", and cutting ties with 10:10: \\"As a result we have taken the decision to disassociate ourselves from 10:10 at this time\\". Kyocera and Eaga were removed from the list of 10:10 sponsors, and National Magazine Company was removed from the list of 10:10 media partners. At the same time, a spokesman for O2, a partner of 10:10, refused to disassociate itself from the group: \\"10:10 is an independent organisation and we don't ask for editorial control over the content of its campaigns.\\" 350.org, with whom 10:10 had been collaborating on the 10 October 2010 day of action, broke all current and future relations with 10:10. In a press release, they said: \\"We respect 10:10's previous work to encourage companies, schools, and churches to voluntarily cut their carbon emissions 10%. Upon seeing the video, however, we have informed 10:10 that we can no longer remain partners on 10 October 2010 or any other initiative. 350.org maintains an absolute commitment to nonviolence in word and deed\\".

It is regulated under the authority of the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) of the federal government. Membership is open to those \\"live, work, worship, or attend school\\" in Washington state, or counties in northern Idaho. The credit union was founded in October 1934. STCU has 185,000 members and $2.8 billion in assets. Among the 120 Washington-based credit unions, it is third-largest, based on asset size. STCU was voted Best Bank/Credit Union each year from 2006-2010 and Best Credit Union from 2011-2018 in the \\"Best of the Inland Northwest\\" reader surveys conducted by The Inlander, a free weekly newspaper. Leadership/Governance In October 2017, STCU announced that CEO and President Tom Johnson would retire at the end of the year. Thomas A. Johnson was promoted to CEO and president, effective January 1, 2011. Johnson served 12 years on the STCU Board of Directors before becoming the credit union's vice president-administration in 2006. Johnson has said that STCU's long-term planning is guided by three core values: growth in market share, customer service, and efficiency. On January 1, 2018 Ezra Eckhardt began as only the fifth CEO and President in STCU history. Eckhardt is a fifth generation Spokane resident. After Eckardt attended U.S. Military Academy at West Point, he went on to serve six years in the U.S. Army. Ezra holds a master's degree from Gonzaga University, where he is also an adjunct professor at the Jepson School of Business. History STCU was started in 1934 by Ernie McElvain, a teacher at Spokane's Lewis & Clark High School. The credit union operated out of a room on the school's second floor, with a shoebox for cash deposits and a bell with a rope that members would pull to be let inside. It ended the first year with 120 members and $4,000 in assets. In 1964, STCU left the high school and opened its first office (now its Main Branch) at 106 W. Nora in Spokane. At the time, it had 2,078 members and $1.5 million in assets. Services STCU has 23 branches throughout Spokane, Tri-Cities, and North Idaho. STCU reports that it began offering online banking in 1997, when many members were skeptical of the service. In 2010, the company updated its online banking system with features such as account alerts, secure messaging, and external transfers. STCU is a member of the CO-OP Financial Services. Members pay no fees to use nearly 30,000 ATMs worldwide, including over 5,000 7-Eleven shared branching locations in North America. In 2015, the credit union switched from Visa to Mastercard when the time came to implement EMV technology.

Hiller's numerically superior force won a victory over the Allied troops, forcing Bessi√®res to retreat to the west. Neumarkt-Sankt Veit is located ten kilometers north of M√ºhldorf and 33 kilometers southeast of Landshut in Bavaria. On 10 April 1809, Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen's surprise invasion of the Kingdom of Bavaria put the Grande Arm√©e of Emperor Napoleon I of France at a disadvantage. On 19 April, Charles failed to take advantage of his opportunities and Napoleon struck back with savage force against the Austrian left wing under Hiller. After battles on 20 and 21 April, Hiller's troops were driven into a headlong retreat to the southeast. Having temporarily disposed of Hiller, Napoleon turned north with his main army against Archduke Charles. On 22 and 23 April, the Franco-Germans defeated Charles' army and forced it to withdraw to the north bank of the Danube. Meanwhile, Napoleon sent Bessi√®res to pursue the Austrian left wing with minor forces. Not knowing that Charles had been defeated, Hiller turned back upon his pursuer, defeating Bessi√®res near Neumarkt-Sankt Veit. Once he found that he was alone on the south bank facing Napoleon's main army, Hiller retreated rapidly to the east in the direction of Vienna. Background On 10 April 1809, Archduke Charles invaded the Kingdom of Bavaria with 209,000 Austrian soldiers and 500 artillery pieces.Epstein, p 54 A set of orders from Emperor Napoleon in Paris was transmitted poorly and misunderstood by Marshal Louis Alexandre Berthier. By the time Napoleon arrived at the front on the 17th, his Franco-German army invited defeat in detail.Epstein, p 58 On the morning of the 19th, Charles gained a position in which he might have severely punished Marshal Louis Davout's isolated III Corps. Instead, Davout escaped defeat in the hard-fought Battle of Teugen-Hausen.Arnold, pp. 92‚Äì93 On 20 April, the Austrian left wing was strung-out on a 13 kilometer front behind the Abens River from Mainburg in the south to Biburg in the north. The left wing consisted of the V Armeekorps under Feldmarschall-Leutnant Archduke Louis of Austria, the VI Armeekorps led by Feldmarschall-Leutnant Hiller, the small II Reserve Armeekorps commanded by Feldmarschall-Leutnant Michael von Kienmayer, and a detachment from the III Armeekorps.Arnold, pp. 106‚Äì107 In total, there were about 42,000 Austrians. Napoleon launched 55,000 troops at his enemies in the Battle of Abensberg, inflicting 6,710 casualties, and forcing them to retreat.Petre, p 139 In command of the left wing since his arrival that morning,Petre, p 137 Hiller elected to continue withdrawing southeast toward Landshut, thus separating Hiller's three corps from Archduke Charles' main body near Regensburg.Epstein, p 63 Napoleon beat Hiller again in the Battle of Landshut on 21 April, seizing a crossing over the Isar River and driving the Austrians farther to the southeast. Until 2:30 am on 22 April, Napoleon mistakenly believed that Hiller's three corps represented the main Austrian army. When he realized his error, he sent most of his troops marching north to crush Archduke Charles.Chandler, pp. 689‚Äì690 On 22 April, the Franco-Germans defeated Charles at the Battle of Eckm√ºhl and forced him to withdraw through Regensburg to the north bank of the Danube the following day.Epstein, p 69 Napoleon instructed Bessi√®res to pursue Hiller and placed him in charge of one reinforced cavalry division and two infantry divisions.Esposito & Elting, map 99 The bulk of Hiller's force, numbering 27,000 to 28,000 troops, lay near M√ºhldorf and Neu√∂tting on the Inn River at noon on 23 April. A 10,000-strong division under Feldmarschall-Leutnant Franz Jellacic held Munich. Feldmarschall-Leutnant Dedovich's brigade from the IV Armeekorps, which had been blockading Passau, was assigned to Hiller's command and moved to Braunau am Inn. Hiller noticed that the French pursuit had slackened on the 22nd and 23rd and decided to counterattack. A letter from Emperor Francis I urging him to help defend Archduke Charles' south flank strengthened the left wing commander's resolve. Neither the emperor nor Hiller realized that Charles had withdrawn to the north bank of the Danube.Petre, p 217 Battle Battle of Neumarkt-Sankt Veit, 24 April 1809 On the night of 22 April, Napoleon instructed Bessi√®res to advance with Lieutenant General Karl Philipp von Wrede's Bavarian division from the VII Corps, General of Division Gabriel Jean Joseph Molitor's French infantry division from the IV Corps, and General of Brigade Jacob Fran√ßois Marulaz's IV Corps cavalry division. The emperor planned for the pursuit to cross the Inn and capture Braunau am Inn.Petre, p 187 On the 24th, Napoleon ordered Marshal Fran√ßois Joseph Lefebvre, the commander of VII Corps, to take the division of Lieutenant General the Crown Prince of Bavaria to recapture Munich from Jellacic. If necessary, he could call on Lieutenant General Deroy's Bavarian division also. Bessi√®res, with Wrede's division, reached Neumarkt-Sankt Veit on 22 April. From there he sent Marulaz to probe toward the Inn River.Petre, p 218 Late on 23 April, Hiller recrossed the Inn at M√ºhldorf and ordered Jellacic to advance from Munich toward Landshut. That day, Marulaz's advance guard marched southeast toward the Inn. A short distance north of M√ºhldorf at the village of Erharting, the 3rd Chasseurs √† Cheval Regiment collided with Hiller's advance elements. The French horsemen were quickly driven back on two supporting units, the 19th Chasseurs √† Cheval and an infantry battalion. Marulaz pulled back in the direction of Neumarkt-Sankt Veit. On the morning of 24 April, Hiller advanced in three columns. His right column of 12 infantry battalions and nine cavalry squadrons attacked Wrede at 8:00 am. The Bavarian general held high ground to the southeast of Neumarkt with 10 battalions and eight squadrons. On the far right, an advance guard under Joseph Radetzky von Radetz felt its way to the north toward Landau an der Isar. Hiller's center column struck Marulaz's position and drove the cavalry back. In addition to his own division, Marulaz had General of Brigade Charles Claude Jacquinot's light cavalry brigade from the III Corps attached. In the face of Austrian assaults, Wrede held his ground until noon. Seeing that the opposing flanking columns threatened to envelop his Bavarians, Bessi√®res ordered a retreat about 1:00 pm. By this time, Molitor had arrived from Vilsbiburg and sent two regiments to cover Wrede's retreat while holding his other two regiments in reserve. Nevertheless, the Austrians continued to press the Bavarians hard and captured Neumarkt at about 3:00 pm. Wrede's soldiers suffered significant losses as they struggled across the Rott River. Once his enemies got across the Rott, which runs eastward into the Inn near Sch√§rding, Hiller called off the battle. Bessi√®res conducted an orderly retreat to Vilsbiburg. Result Francis Loraine Petre gives Austrian casualties as 776 killed and wounded, plus 122 captured. He writes that Wrede lost 586 killed and wounded. Digby Smith lists 1,692 Bavarians killed and wounded, plus another 910 missing or captured. Smith notes that the Austrians lost 800 casualties. To Smith's total must be added Bessi√®res' reported losses of 200 among the cavalry. On the night of 24 April, Hiller got word of the defeat of Archduke Charles and immediately pulled back to Neu√∂tting. Jellacic was unable to carry out his orders to threaten Landshut. He found out about Archduke Charles' defeat and evacuated Munich on the evening of the 23rd. When Jellacic got Hiller's orders of the 23rd, he tried to reoccupy Munich. Before he reached the Bavarian capital, he received new orders from Hiller instructing him to retreat to Salzburg.Petre, p 220 Eventually, General of Division Paul Grenier's corps from the Army of Italy crushed Jellacic's wandering division on 25 May at the Battle of Sankt Michael in Styria.Petre, p 303 When Napoleon received news of the Battle of Neumarkt, he sent Marshal Jean Lannes with a corps of 25,000 to support Bessi√®res. By this time Hiller was in full retreat to the east. The French emperor directed Andr√© Mass√©na and the IV Corps to take the road to Passau, while Bessi√®res and Lannes (who now led the II Corps) took a route farther south.Epstein, p 100 The next major action was the Battle of Ebelsberg on 3 May.Smith, p 298 Order of battle =Austrian forces= Johann von Hiller Returns from 20 March 1809, less detachments Left Wing: Feldmarschall-Leutnant Johann von Hiller * VI Armeekorps: Feldmarschall-Leutnant Johann von HillerBowden & Tarbox, pp. 70‚Äì71.

Thirty-six people died as a result of the accident, and 50 people were reported injured. Accident At 3:00am local time on 2 October 2010, an Argo Bromo Anggrek executive train travelling from Jakarta to Surabaya ran into the rear of a Senja Utama Semarang business train at Petarukan, Pemalang a city on the north coast of central Java. The Argo Bromo executive train had 336 passengers on board, while the Senja Utama Semarang business train was bound for Semarang and carrying 663 passengers. The location of the crash was at track 4 of Petarukan station. The Argo Bromo Anggrek train was supposed to pass the slower Senja Utama Semarang train (which was waiting to be passed at track 4), on track 3, but it passed a danger signal and eventually rear-ended the waiting train. Three carriages derailed and overturned, 36 people were reported to have been killed and 50 injured, with the death toll expected to rise. The accident was the deadliest in Indonesia since the Bintaro train crash on 19 October 1987, which killed 156 people. Because of this crash, rear-end buffer cars (a baggage car, power car, or an empty passenger coach) were made mandatory for every locomotive- drawn passenger train in Indonesia. At around the same time, a second crash in Surakarta (Solo) killed a single person when an economy train was grazed in the rear by an express train. Cause A spokesman stated that the cause of the accident (beside human error) was a signalling error. Reaction A spokesman for Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono said that \\"The President has instructed a sanction against whoever was responsible for the accident.\\" Director General of Railway Affairs at the Ministry of Transportation Tunjung Inderawan offered apologies for the two incidents, saying that \\"I apologize to the families of all the victims of the train accidents.\\" References External links *Photographs of the accident 2010 in Indonesia Accidents and incidents involving Kereta Api Indonesia Railway accidents in 2010 Train collisions in Indonesia Central Java October 2010 events in Asia ","title":"Petarukan train collision"},{"id":"29024878","text":"LIG Nex1 Co., Ltd.

The statues of the Memnons. Watercolour by Charles Vacher. Life He was the third son of the well-known stationer and bookseller, Thomas Vacher, of 29 Parliament Street, Westminster, where he was born on 22 June 1818. He studied art at the Royal Academy. Between 1839 and 1843 he pursued his studies in Rome. Many tours followed, in which he visited Italy, Sicily, France, Germany, Algeria, and Egypt, making large numbers of sketches in all these countries. These sketches furnished him with materials for his numerous drawings, which were highly finished and had an excellence of composition and an abundance of interesting details that gave his works a considerable popularity. His speciality was Italian views, but Egyptian and some Algerian subjects were also sketched and painted. The marine painter Edward William Cooke visited his Italian studio in 1846. He was a rapid worker, and, besides over two thousand sketches which he left at his death, he often executed twelve to sixteen finished works in one year, and between 1838 and 1881 he exhibited no fewer than 350 at the London exhibitions. His first exhibit at the Royal Academy was, in 1838, ‚ÄòWell at Bacharach on the Rhine,‚Äô but the majority of his pictures ‚Äî 324 works in all ‚Äî were shown at the gallery of the New Society of Painters in Water Colours, now the Royal Institute of Painters in Watercolours, which he joined in 1846, on the introduction of his friend Louis Hague. His name first appears at the Royal Manchester Institution exhibition in 1842 as a contributor of six drawings, all of buildings in Italy. One of these, ‚ÄòNaples with Vesuvius,‚Äô is probably that now in the South Kensington Museum. The British Museum possesses two fairly good examples of his work‚Äî‚ÄòView of City of Tombs, Cairo,‚Äô 1863, and ‚ÄòView in the Forum, Rome‚Äô‚Äîand many others are in the possession of his widow. Vacher married Jane Allan, daughter of James Mathewson Allan, on 16 July 1857. He died on 21 July 1883 at his residence, 4 The Boltons, West Brompton, of progressive cerebro-spinal paralysis. The couple had no children, his widow Jane and his nephews became executors of the ¬£45,000 left in his will, a remarkable sum for a painter. His unsold works were auctioned by Christies on 21 February 1884. He was buried at Kensal Green cemetery. A portrait in watercolour, painted by himself, belonged to his widow, who also possessed a portrait painted in oil by Thomas Harwood (a watercolour painter) in Rome. Vacher's elder brother, George, owned a portrait of him in oil which was executed in 1850 by William Denholm Kennedy. He is buried at Kensal Green Cemetery. The Victoria and Albert, Portsmouth City, and British Museum contain works by the artist, as do the Glasgow and Grundy Art Gallery.

The building is located on Infirmary Street in Edinburgh, Scotland, and was formerly one of the foremost churches in the burgh. It is now used as the joinery workshop for the Estates Division of the University of Edinburgh. History Founded with funds provided by Margaret Ker, Lady Yester the widow of James Hay, 7th Lord Hay of Yester, the original building was founded in 1644 and completed in 1647. However, this structure was damaged by Oliver Cromwell's troops during their invasion of Scotland, and the building was eventually replaced by the current structure (built 1803-5), designed by William Sibbald, which is a Category B listed building. The current building lies slightly to the west of the original, which was built on the site of the former Blackfriar's Monastery (now the High School Yards). A replacement church was built to the west (over the former burial ground) from 1803 to 1805 by William Sibbald. The original church was then demolished 1805/6. Some of the more interesting memorials were relocated: notably the tombstone of Lady Yester herself which is now in Greyfriars Kirkyard. In 1822 the original site was built over by a Secessionist Chapel designed by Thomas Brown. This was converted to a Free Church following the Disruption of 1843 and was then known as the Tolbooth Free Church. Due to the depopulation of Edinburgh's Old Town in the early part of the 20th century, in 1938 the congregation merged with Greyfriars Kirk, in common with several other nearby churches. There is now the Lady Yester Chapel within Greyfriars Kirk, incorporating various artifacts from the former church building.

This company was a sister company of Saulog Transit up until the company's management was transferred to JAC Liner Inc., and Genesis Transport (as North Genesis) following Dagupan Bus' soldout in 2015. History Dagupan Bus Co., Inc. started its operation in 1974 when they acquired the franchise of Villarey Transit, also a provincial bus company with only six Mitsubishi Fuso buses, through Saulog Transit Inc. to be able to expand its operation to Northern Luzon. They used an old livery of dirty white with maroon, red, and green stripes. Later, it has adopted the use of dirty white livery and red stripes during its re-fleeting of units in 2007. =Issues and Controversies= The Quezon City Regional Trial Court issued the writ of preliminary injunction against the Saulog group of companies who attempted to sell their stocks to other bus companies. Another controversy regarding Saulog Transit Inc. and Dagupan Bus Co., Inc. was a conflict which sparked between the Saulog stakeholders after the assassinations of their ancestors. Eliseo Saulog, the founder of Saulog Transit Inc. and father of the Saulog children, Ignacio Saulog, Luciano Saulog, Teodoro Saulog, Virginia Saulog, Dr. Melquiades Saulog, Maura Saulog- Aguinaldo, Lilia Saulog-Venturina, and Dr. Marietta Saulog-Vergara, was shot and killed in 1960 by an unidentified gunman, while the family patriarch, Ruben Saulog, father of the current chief executive and one of the eight children of the founder, was also assassinated in 1990. Until then, the case of such killings were still uncertain and unresolved. The attempts to sell the two companies were assured by the lawyer Bernard Saulog, who got 75% of the total ‚Ç±1.4 B assets, while the remaining 25% were given to the rest of the clan members. Unfortunately, Teodoro Saulog and his clan members refused to give up Saulog Transit Inc. and Dagupan Bus Co., Inc.Saulog for Sale In 2014, Dagupan Bus Co., Inc together with Mt. Province Cable Tours sold their franchises to G.V. Florida Transport for their routes in Baguio City to areas within Benguet and Mountain Province. It underwent a \\"private transaction\\" between the said companies, and the franchise rights were failed to be transferred from Dagupan Bus and Mt. Province Cable Tours to G.V. Florida. The said \\"private transaction\\" was not honored by the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), and was never known of, until February 2013, where one of their units fell into a ravine, killing 15 of its passengers. It resulted to them being suspended for 30 days and paying for damages. A Dagupan Bus painted with JAC Liner's livery, a result to Dagupan Bus Co, Inc. 1533 soldout in 2015. =Soldout to JAC Liner and Genesis Transport= It was in 2010 when Saulog Transit Inc. and Genesis Transport Service Inc. signed a memorandum of agreement for the long time cooperation and allocation of the franchise of the former. Genesis Transport answered all of the assets of Saulog Transit when it was found out that the Saulog clan was unable to shoulder all of the annual employees' contributions to Social Security System, Home Development Mutual Fund (Pag-Ibig) and PhilHealth. Hence, Saulog Transit and Dagupan Bus Co., Inc. acquired new bus units. In 2011, Dagupan Bus Co. has given up the routes going to Cagayan Valley, which they transferred to GV Florida Transport, using ordinary buses manufactured by Del Monte Motor Works, Inc. as part of the signed agreement by Saulog Transit Inc. and Genesis Transport Services Inc. In 2015, JAC Liner Inc. and Genesis Transport took over the management of Dagupan Bus.

History When it was first designated in 1925, SR 219 was routed between its current western terminus at the Indiana State Line and its junction with SR 66. In 1937, SR 219 was extended east to a new endpoint at what was US 25. Following completion of Interstate 75 through northern Shelby County and southern Auglaize County in 1962, U.S. Route 25 was re-routed onto the new freeway, and SR 219 was extended. From its former eastern terminus, it was routed south along the former US 25 into Botkins, then east along County Road 22 to a new terminus at a diamond interchange with the new freeway. By 1973, SR 219 experienced a re-routing through eastern Mercer County. The designation was removed from what is now County Road 219A, and applied to what was a former eastern extension of SR 703 along the south side of Grand Lake Saint Marys between the Burge Road intersection and the Mercer-Auglaize County Line.

It is located in Domalguda, a residential locality which lies along the Hussain Sagar lake. The park contains an award-winning rock garden designed by a commissioner of customs and excise duty.  Facilities  In 2001, the civic authorities of Hyderabad planned to construct a rock garden inside the park. Besides the garden, which was to be constructed over an area of , other recreational facilities were planned to be set up. A man-made desert and purification of the lake within the park so as to enable a boating facility were also to be taken up. These new plans were to assist the park in its promotion as a tourist destination. Subrata Basu, the then local commissioner of customs and excise duty, had earlier succeeded with a similar rock sanctuary in Shilparamam, an arts and handicrafts village near Hyderabad. In 2002, the rock garden was readied as per the ideas of Basu's designs. While explaining his zeal in design the garden, Basu said that the natural rock formations were in danger from real estate developers. He only wished to preserve them.

Rallies or sit-ins have been organized towards achieving goals by dalit rights groups, auto rickshaws unions, students and teachers, political leaders, and others. On an average, three such rallies are given permission by the local authorities. Due to these rallies, normal life has been affected. Mainly school children, college students and medical emergencies get affected because of the traffic that is caused by people congregating for these rallies. Though the local police designs a plan for the participants, their inability to control their movement results in traffic jams.

It was initiated by Dr. Leonard Cutler Sanford and financially supported by Frederick F. Brewster, both of New Haven, Connecticut. The expedition took place from 1912 to 1917, with its core members the experienced bird collector Rollo Beck and his wife Ida, though additional assistance was used at many places. Although most of the nearly 8,000 specimens collected were seabirds, land birds were opportunistically acquired as well. Various watercraft were used in the course of the expedition, where much of the collection work was carried out at sea. Expedition The Becks left San Francisco on 4 December 1912. The first collecting was carried out in Peru, working along the coast as well as making some inland trips. Based at shore stations, and using hired fishing boats, Rollo Beck would often row out to sea alone, and sometimes with a man to assist him, as far as 20 km offshore, collecting birds from dawn to dusk. 1913 was taken up by work along the coasts of Peru and Chile, with trips also made to the Juan Fern√°ndez Islands. 1914 saw the Becks working their way southwards along the Chilean coast to the Chilo√© Archipelago and then, in July, to Magallanes Province. Ramifications of the outbreak of war in Europe caused some difficulties for the Becks, but in August 1914 they visited the Falkland Islands and then moved to Mar del Plata, Argentina, where they were based until November. Then, after revisiting the Falklands, and using a hired sloop, the ‚ÄúLeguri,‚Äù the Becks spent December and January sailing and collecting in the waterways and islands around Cape Horn and the Beagle Channel. From February 1915 the Becks collected from Magallanes and around Tierra del Fuego using the schooner ‚ÄúAntarctica.‚Äù They visited the Falklands in September and again in October, where they stayed through January 1916 before moving northwards to Uruguay and the coast of Brazil which they worked for several months before sailing to the Caribbean and collecting through the island of Hispaniola from September 1916 to July 1917. From mid July to the end of August 1917 the Becks collected in Cuba and returned to the United States at the beginning of September. Beck's report and narrative of the expedition was summarised by Robert Cushman Murphy in his ‚ÄúOceanic Birds of South America,‚Äù in which he comments: > ‚ÄùThe specimens of birds obtained during the course of the Brewster-Sanford > Expedition number 7,853.

After completing his BSc (Honours) in 1978, he continued in the same department in the Thesis Group for Masters. The topic of his thesis was Rice Field Spiders in Chittagong. He was the only entomologist who worked on spiders for the first time in Bangladesh (1978‚Äì80).Rice field Spiders from Chittagong, Proceedings of the Third National Zoological Conference, 1981, pp. 53‚Äì72, Published by The Zoological Society of Bangladesh, Dhaka University, Dhaka, Bangladesh. He finished his academic education in 1980. For some time he worked as a Research Fellow of the University Grants Commission under the supervision of Professor (Dr.) Shafique Haider Chowdhury. Again his focus of research was spiders.  Career  At the beginning of 1981, Nagari joined the Zoology Department of Chittagong University as a lecturer. However, inspired by his father, he appeared in the Bangladesh Civil Service (BCS) examination which he passed successfully and was appointed as Assistant collector of Customs & Excise. He left the University job and joined the government service in the early December 1983. As a government officer he worked in various offices in different ranks and positions throughout the country under National Board of Revenue (NBR) of Ministry of Finance. He has retired from Government Service since March 2016.  Literary career  From the very childhood Shahabuddin Nagari has been involved in writing. When he was a student of his village school, he attempted to write some rhymes. His uncle late Abdul Mannan, then a student of Rajshahi University, would come to the village every week (1966‚Äì67) and arrange literary gathering. There, the youngest member Shahabuddin Nagari would read out his rhymes. After moving to Dhaka in 1968, he became a regular subscriber of 'Mukuler Mahfil' (The Daily Azad) and 'Kachi Kachar Ashor' (The Daily Ittefaq). About that time he started to send his compositions for publishing. On 30 July 1969, his first rhyme 'Ami Kobi' (I am a Poet) was published in the 'Mukuler Mahfil'. After fighting the liberation war in 1971, he went back to Chittagong and resumed literary activity. When a son of the famous politician late Jahur Ahmed Chowdhury published a weekly called 'Rajanigandha', he started to contribute there. Then he started writing in the children's section of 'The Daily Michhil'. Besides the newspapers of Chittagong, he started to write for children in almost all the national newspapers and magazines of Dhaka. His first book of rhymes Nil Paharer Chhara (1978) was published by the-then famous publishing house of Dhaka 'Muktodhara' (The Swadhin Bangla Sahittya Parishad). He published this book by directly contacting late Chittaranjan Saha, the founder of Muktodhara Publications. His second book Mahakaler Batighar contained articles on literature and was published by Caucus Publishers, Chittagong in 1986. The same year his collection of rhymes Mouly Tomar Chhara was published by Dolna Prakashani of Chittagong. = Poetry = Nagari is essentially a romantic poet whose focal point of writing is a reflection of his sensitivity. Love constitutes a key component in his poetic thought. Also, a yearning for the past, for social issues and the occasional sadness that encircles human life are also highlighted in his work. The portrayal of Nagari's feelings comes through the exceptionally descriptive. Not only does it paint a vivid picture of his memories, it also allows one to virtually live the experiences Nagari acquired as an adolescent. He writes mostly in free verse.  Midnight Locomotive and Other Poems  Midnight Locomotive and Other Poems is an anthology of 86 poems by Shahabuddin Nagari, translated into English from original in Bengali by different hands. The culture of Bangladesh and a love for his country is a critical factor in Nagari's writing. This fact is unmistakably etched in the poem, \\"Our Dreams\\": I touch the river, water fills up and it flows to the brim brim full of water abounds in silvery hilsa If I look at a barren garden it is full with flowers, rose, marigold, hasnahena If I dream, Bangladesh also dreams a better future super powers bow down to our dreams.  The Black Cat and Other Poems  The Black Cat and Other Poems is a new book of poetry of Shahabuddin Nagari. It has been published by Authorhouse, USA in Sep. 2011. Nagari's passion for woman and nature combined together is amply demonstrated in a number of poems. His passionate love for his beloved is well depicted in the following lines : In the mid-night doorbell rang in your door Soundless movement like soft steps of the cats Smell of pheromone can be felt from inside the shoe You didn't understand, put on the shoe, light flickered from it Sound can be heard of feline steps on marble floor I've made that pair of shoes with my skin Under your feet lies my skin.  Other dimensions  Shahabuddin Nagari is a figure in the cultural sphere of Bangladesh. At once he is a vocalist, songwriter, composer, playwright and a script-writer. Considering his enthusiasm for music, his father got him admitted into the- then Pakistan Cultural Academy situated in Green Road, Dhaka. At that time he was a student of grade nine in the school. There Nagari learned both modern and classical music. He was taught modern song by M.A Hamid (now living in the USA), late Mahmudunnabi and Mohammad Abdul Jabbar. After the liberation in 1971, he learned music from Ustad Syed Anwar Mufti of Bangladesh Betar, Chittagong. In 1977 he appeared for audition and became a listed singer in Bangladesh Television. A long hiatus from the world of music became inevitable due to studies and job. However, in 1994 he returned to music by singing for the BTV drama Keu Fere Keu Fere Na. In 1995, he developed acquaintance with two famous composers of the country, namely, Subal Das and Pranab Ghosh. In 1996, under the supervision of Subal Das his first audio album 'Bishonno Mon' was published and this gave birth to a new Shahabuddin Nagari. By 2004 he has had ten solo albums published. He has sung more than 200 songs. HMV (now RPG) of Kolkata has published his audio CD under the title Premer Gaan in 1999. In 2003 the song 'Bhalobasha Bhag Kora Jay Na' became widely popular throughout Bangladesh. In 2004 he wrote the story, dialogue, script and gave music direction for the feature film Ak Khando Jomi produced by Impress Telefilm Limited. The film was based on his poem 'Ak Khando Jomi' included in his book Aguner Ful Fote Thonte.  Publications  After his debut publication in 1978, a book of rhymes titled Nil Paharer Chhara, Nagari had never looked back. He wrote and published every year. Till date, he has published sixteen volumes of poetry including two in English translation. The count is seventeen for book of rhymes, six for juvenile novels and short stories and four for essays and articles. He has also written one novel and one travelogue. In addition he has compiled and edited with others three volumes of poems and rhymes. His introductory write-up on Bengali rhymes (1947‚Äì87) (adopted as the Introduction of Bangladesher Chhara, 1987) is the first research work on Bangladeshi rhymes and recognised as the first reference in our literature.

He is remembered as the author of Mayne's Hindu Law regarded as the most authoritative book on the Indian Penal Code. His married life was marred by a scandal, which prevented him from gaining a knighthood. Family Born on 31 December 1828, to John Mayne (1793‚Äì1828), a Dublin lawyer who died before John Dawson was born. His mother, Anna (Graves) Johnson (1798‚Äì1864), had first married Edward Johnson (died 1818) J.P., of Ballymacash House, Co. Antrim. Mayne's middle name was for his great- grandfather's cousin and benefactor, Thomas Dawson, 1st Viscount Cremorne. He came from a well-known family and was a grandson of Judge Edward Mayne and Dean Richard Graves. He was a nephew of Sir Richard Mayne and a first cousin of Admiral Richard Charles Mayne, Chief Justice Sir William Collis Meredith, Edmund Allen Meredith, Sir Richard Graves MacDonnell, Major-General Arthur Robert MacDonnell and Francis Brinkley. His sister married a son of Abraham Colles, and through her he was the uncle of Ladies Ashbourne and Bewley. Career Mayne had his initial education in Dublin and graduated in law from Trinity College, Dublin. He was called to the English bar in 1854, but practised in the United Kingdom from 1854 to 1856 before moving to Madras, India. Mayne served as the Professor of law, logic and moral philosophy at the Presidency College, Madras from 1857 throughout the 1860s. He also served as Assistant Legal Secretary to the Madras government from 1860 to 1872 and as a Clerk of the Crown during the 1860s. He served as Advocate-General of Madras from 1862 to 1872. He left India in a cloud of scandal, running away from his wife with the wife of another man, Annie Craigie-Halkett. In England, despite the scandal, Mayne was appointed and a member of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom in 1873, retiring in 1903. He also served as a Professor of Common Law at the Inns of Court from 1879 to 1883. In 1880, he unsuccessfully contested for the Parliamentary seat at Falmouth. He was an enthusiastic family historian, producing an impressively long 'pedigree' of the Maynes from 1900 back through some thirty generations to Normandy, but beyond the 17th century, like so many family histories of the time, it was riddled with errors of assumption. At Madras, 1859, he had married his first wife, Helen Sarah Hamilton (born 1841), daughter of Colonel Robert Hamilton of the Madras Staff Corps. She divorced Mayne in 1872 after he ran off with his soon to be second wife, Annie Craigie-Halkett (1833‚Äì1917). Annie's first husband's name is unknown, but she was the daughter of Charles Craigie-Halkett-Inglis of Hallhill, Fife and Cramond House, near Edinburgh, by his wife Susan, the youngest daughter of Sir John Marjoribanks of Lees (1763‚Äì1833), 1st Bt., M.P., Lord Provost of Edinburgh. Annie and 'JD' (as he was known) divorced their respective spouses so they could marry in May 1873. Annie was reputed to be very beautiful despite her face being marred by a 'Port wine mark' (birth mark), which led her to favouring veils in later life. In 1917, he and Annie died within six weeks of one another, at their home 'Goodrest', also known as Shinfield Park, Berkshire. The gardens were so extensive at Goodrest that they required twenty gardeners to maintain its upkeep. Mayne left no children by either marriage, but took great joy in being both a financial and legal help to many of his relatives.  References   Sir T. R. A. Thumboo Chetty, Raja Dharma Pravina, C.I.E.

It was established in 1958 and is in Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh, India. It is affiliated to Dr. NTR University of Health Sciences. History Dr. Datla Satyanarayana Raju and Dr. M. V. Krishna Rao had been dreaming of starting a private medical college to cater to the students of coastal Andhra Pradesh, particularly Godavari districts. They founded and registered the Medical Education Society on 16 April 1958. The objectives were of promoting medical education, research and relief through voluntary effort. They started collecting donations assisted by Dr. I. Joga Rao, P.V.N. Raju, K. Chandra Rao, A. Perisastry, B. Venkata Raju and Dr. P.R. Hari. Mullapudi Harishchandra Prasad of Sri Mullapudi Venkata Rayudu Memorial Educational Trust of Tanuku offered a donation of Rs. 500,000. The college was named after his late brother-in-law Sri. Pendyala Ranga Rao, zamindar of Dommeru. He became the vice president of the society. Sri Kotamarthi Venkanna gifted 6-1/2 acres of land, now called Kotamarthi Park on which stands the present men's hostels. Sri Draksharama Choultry Trust gave a donation of Rs. 50,000 towards construction of a lecture hall. Rao Venkata Kumara Mahipati Surya Rau, the Maharaja of Pithapuram, leased the palatial orphanage buildings (now the Main Campus) to house the Medical College. Two lecture halls and a dissection hall were constructed. The Rangaraya Medical College was inaugurated on 17 November 1958 by Sri. Neelam Sanjeeva Reddy, then Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh. One hundred students were admitted in the first year. Their teaching work for first MBBS was initiated on 15 August 1958 by Dr. V. S. Krishna, vice chancellor of Andhra University. The idea was conceived on 24 February by Col. D.S. Raju n his associates. The society was formed on 16 April; the first lecture was delivered by Dr. Moturu Bhanu Sankar Prasad on 17 September. Prominent among them in the medical field during 1958 were Col. Dr. D.S. Raju and Dr. M.V. Krishna Rao. While Col. Raju was engaged in the task of collecting donations to the proposed Medical College, Dr. M.V. Krishna Rao did the spade work for the starting of the institution. The then municipal chairman Sri Dantu Bhaskara Rao heartily cooperated with the endeavour, with the result the starting of a medical college, which was till then an ambition, became a reality. Sri Draksharama Choultry Trust represented by the Pydah family gave a donation of 50,000 rupees with which a lecture hall was constructed. Many other people contributed smaller donations amounting to about rupees 2.5 lakhs. The Government General Hospital would serve as the teaching hospital. Within 21/2 months two lecture halls and a dissection hall were constructed and ready for occupation. The formal inauguration of the Rangaraya Medical College was done on 17 November 1958 by Sri. N. Sanjeeva Reddy, the then chief minister of Andhra Pradesh. The paraclinical departments, the central library, and two more lecture galleries were constructed opposite to the hospital. The hospital began to see expansion in the late 1960s and 1970s. In the year 1977 Government of Andhra Pradesh took over the privately managed RMC. In 1981 Rangaraya Medical College became a full-fledged Government Medical College. More recently the college and hospital have seen numerous changes. Two exam halls capable of accommodating almost 400 people were constructed in 2002. A new lecture gallery for the Department of physiology was constructed behind the exam halls. The volleyball and basketball court were renovated with flood lights. New tennis courts were constructed and are being used to provide tennis coaching by the East Godavari District Tennis Association. The badminton court flooring was renovated. Students playing in the renovated basketball court. students playing in the renovated volleyball court During golden jubilee celebrations of the college the auditorium was renovated with air-conditioning and new sound system facilities ‚Äî making it one-of-a-kind among the auditoriums of its sister colleges in the state. A medical exhibition was organised by students and staff after almost 25 years which attracted huge crowds from the beginning to the end of the event. During the golden jubilee celebrations the RMCANA (Rangaraya Medical College Alumni Association of North America) helped construct a new digital library with internet facilities and free access to world-renowned medical journals. Sports and cultural festivals were conducted involving colleges around the state, the most recent one being \\"NEXUS\\" conducted in 2010. The statue of Hippocrates at the entrance of the college is symbolic of the dedication towards the art and science of medicine shown by everyone who passes through it. A statue of Hippocrates (the father of medicine) was erected near the entrance of college which gives a new identity to the college on the map of Kakinada. More recently a clock tower was constructed in front of the auditorium. Hippocrates statue at night The Government General Hospital that serves as the teaching hospital has seen considerable change. A new casualty block was constructed to manage the increasing flow of patients. Several superspecialty departments are being created and their offices are being constructed in the renovated 2nd floor of the main OP building. A new hostel for internees was constructed as superspecialty departments were being housed in the old internees hostel at the OP Building. New blocks for Antenatal wards and Pre-op gynecology wards were constructed adjacent to the existing Obstetrics, Gynecology and Pediatrics departments. New buildings were constructed to house the ENT, Ophthalmology and Psychiatry departments and their respective Operation Theaters. An ART (Anti Retroviral Therapy) center which caters to the special needs of patients affected with the HIV virus was moved to a new building. It is one of the largest of its kind in India based on the patient volume served giving it a vital role in affecting the epidemiology of HIV in India.

It is bounded by the Pan Island Expressway (PIE) in the east; the Pelton Canal in the south; the Kallang River in the west; and Serangoon Road in the north.https://keylocation.sg/singapore/planning-areas/kallang Previously, \\"Kolam Ayer\\" encompassed an area that included present-day Geylang Bahru subzone and the adjacent Kallang Way subzone, the latter of which is officially organised under Geylang Planning Area. Several places within Geylang Bahru still retain this name: Kolam Ayer Community Club and Kolam Ayer Neighbourhood Police Post, as well as the road Jalan Kolam Ayer. Made up of both residential and industrial developments, other notable places in Geylang Bahru include the Kallang Basin Swimming Complex, Kallang Distripark, the main office of Jalan Besar Town Council, the office of the Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board (SEAB) and Ministry of Manpower (MOM) Services Centre. Geylang Bahru MRT station along the Downtown Line serves this subzone. \\"Geylang Bahru\\" is also the name of a two-way road in the area. This road connects Bendemeer Road in the north with Upper Boon Keng Road in the south, with major junction located at Kallang Bahru. This road is unique as it is one of the few roads in Singapore to have a name without any generic element. The name of the subzone was derived from this road.  Etymology  The name ‚ÄúKolam Ayer‚Äù, was derived from the Malay phrase \\"kolam air\\", which translates to \\"pond water\\". The subzone's current name, \\"Geylang Bahru\\", came from a road in the area; \\"Geylang\\" is a place in Singapore, now considered a separate planning area from Kallang, while \\"Bahru\\" is the old Malay spelling for \\"baru\\", meaning \\"new\\". The name \\"Geylang Bahru\\" first appeared as a proposed road in a street directory in 1969.https://hm.onemap.sg It is worth noting that the road marked as \\"Geylang Bahru\\" in the 1969 map (and numerous revised editions released in the following years) roughly corresponds to the modern- day Upper Boon Keng Road. By 1975, the road as we call \\"Geylang Bahru\\" today was completed.  History  The term \\"Kolam Ayer\\" roughly applies to the modern-day subzones of Geylang Bahru and Kallang Way, part of the Kallang and Geylang planning areas respectively. Before the development of Kallang, Kolam Ayer (as it was known at the time) had numerous Malay kampongs. The precinct was mainly served by a main road called Jalan Kolam Ayer before the 1960s. This road was eventually merged to form part of the present-day Pan Island Expressway (PIE). During the dredging of the Kallang River in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Singapore government filled and leveled up the surrounding riverside with red mud that was carried by trucks from a nearby hill called Ang Chiang San (modern-day Toa Payoh). These areas formed what are today Bendemeer, Kallang Bahru and the old Geylang Bahru estate. Since then, the precinct was connected with the Kolam Ayer Community Club and the People's Action Party Kolam Ayer Branch. After the 1980s, the Jalan Besar Town Council relocated its office in Kallang Bahru. It was later renamed Moulmein-Kallang between 2011-2015 after the redrawing of GRC boundaries.

However, it is not often used by those going to either as this is generally not viewed as consistent with safe, reasonably paced elevation acclimatization. Rather, typical users of this airstrip are tourists who plan on visiting a nearby hotel and going no higher or those who plan only on going to Namche Bazaar. History The airport was constructed in 1971 by a team lead by Takashi Miyahara and was opened with a test flight by Royal Nepal Airlines on June 1, 1973. It was built to serve Hotel Everest View (jp), the then highest placed hotel in the world. In the early 2000s, there was a controversy surrounding the expansion of the airport for tourists to skip the trek from Lukla to Namche Bazaar with Lukla entrepreneurs fearing loss of business. However, the plans for expansion never materialized. Facilities The airport is at an elevation of above mean sea level. It has one runway which is in length. The airstrip is not licensed for commercial operations and has few facilities. There are no scheduled services and most aircraft landing and departing at Syangboche are helicopters and STOL aircraft making chartered flights from Kathmandu or Lukla. The flight from Lukla to Syangboche takes between 7 and 11 minutes by helicopter. Lukla is the farthest point served by scheduled flights on the way to Mount Everest. Helicopters do fly further, and higher, up to Everest Base Camp, but only for picking up exhausted or injured mountaineers or dropping critical supplies. Without altitude acclimatization, Syangboche is the highest point it is advisable to reach by aircraft. It is not uncommon for people visiting Syangboche to be out of breath, due to the high altitude. Airlines and destinations Currently, there are no scheduled services to and from Mahendranagar Airport. Previously Nepal Airlines and Tara Air operated routes to Kathmandu.

Ford Memorial Museum, Homer, Louisiana Wade was born in Minden, the seat of Webster Parish, which had been created in 1871 from Claiborne Parish. He was reared in the Holly Springs community located off U.S. Highway 79 between Minden and Homer. He procured the Bachelor of Science in engineering from Louisiana Tech University in Ruston. He entered the United States Army and served thereafter in World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. In February 1935, Wade launched what became a 32-year military career when he enlisted as a cadet in the United States Army Air Corps, the forerunner of the Air Force. On August 1, 1963, Wade was promoted to lieutenant general and assumed command of SAC's Second Air Force with headquarters then at Barksdale Air Force Base in Bossier City, some fifty miles west of his hometown of Homer, Louisiana. After Wade's military retirement, Governor John J. McKeithen named him in 1967 as the director of the Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections, with authority over both state police and prisons.

Glazer became Executive Secretary of the West Virginia Library Commission, based in Charleston, in 1972. He served for 24 years until his controversial firing in 1996.Chepesiuk, R. (1996). West Virginia state librarian Fred Glazer fired without explanation. American Libraries, 27(6), 19. He died of kidney failure at age 60 on December 8, 1997. Accomplishments Glazer is credited for being largely instrumental in the expansion of library services in West Virginia during his time at the Library Commission. During his tenure, the number of public libraries in the state increased from 89 to over 175, and bookmobiles were deployed to serve West Virginia‚Äôs geographically isolated communities. Library expansion in the state was partially enabled by Glazer's Instant Libraries program, a system of prefabricated library buildings designed by architect J. D. King to be built quickly and efficiently in communities previously lacking library service.Glazer, F. (1972). Instant Libraries. Library Journal, 97(21), 3874-3875. As head of the West Virginia Library Commission, Glazer helped develop and implement a statewide library automation network, which greatly improved inter-library communications and gave patrons greater access to library materials throughout the state. The system, designed by Vinod Chachra of the library automation software developer Virginia Tech Library Systems (now VTLS), went active at its Charleston-based hub in November 1982.Glazer, F. J. (1985). That Bibliographic Highway in the Sky. Library Journal, 110(2), 64. Other library networks have since been modeled after West Virginia's example. Glazer was a strong advocate for increased library funding. He argued that libraries should promote themselves as businesses do in order to gain public support and, in turn, monetary support. In a speech to members of the Arkansas Library Association, he said, \\"Today's fund-seeking librarian would do well to be a cross between P. T. Barnum and Muhammad Ali... We can imitate the campaigns of General Motors, General Mills, Exxon, the neighborhood grocer, bank or any other institution.\\" Glazer, F. J. (1979). Promote or Perish. Arkansas Libraries, 36(December 1979), 12-16. As head of the West Virginia Library Commission, Glazer spearheaded several public relations campaigns to promote libraries. One particularly successful effort was the nationwide \\"Be with a Book for a Day\\" campaign, which urged people to carry a favorite book with them for the day while wearing the campaign's logo. It garnered several celebrity participants, including then-Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton, Walter Cronkite, and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.'Be With A Book For A Day!'. (1979). Library Journal, 104(17).Be with a book for a day a success, reports Glazer. (1980). American Libraries, 11(April 1980), 186-187. Glazer also lobbied directly for higher library funding. While library funding was below 10 cents per capita, he handed out rolls of Life Savers candy to legislators and told them, \\"That's how much you're supporting libraries.\\" By the end of his tenure, per capita library funding increased to about $3.75. Glazer traveled extensively to work with other library professionals, including visits to China and Sweden. In 1994, he served 4 months as an American Library Association Library Fellow at Moscow's Library of Foreign Literature in Russia. Controversy over dismissal On March 29, 1996, Fred Glazer was told by commissioners that he must resign his post as director of the West Virginia Library Commission or be fired at the commissioners' next meeting, and on March 29 the ultimatum was reiterated in writing. Glazer ignored both requests, and on April 22, 1996, the West Virginia Library Commission voted 4-3 to fire Fred Glazer as its director. The commission provided no reason for the firing, and Glazer claimed the motivations for his dismissal were ‚Äúpersonal and political.‚Äù The firing aroused protest and suspicions of foul play in the library community and the community of West Virginia. A former Commission chair coordinated a fundraising group, the Friends of Fred Glazer, to assist Glazer in litigation, and then-Library Journal Editor-In-Chief John N. Berry III called for donations from the library community.Berry, J. N. (1996). Justice for Fred Glazer. Library Journal, 121(November 1996), 6. On July 24 of the same year, Glazer filed suit against the commission, claiming his firing was unlawful and citing age discrimination and defamation of character.St Lifer, E., & Rogers, M. (1996).

It led to the election of Pietro Vito Ottoboni as Pope Alexander VIII. The conclave saw previous factions join together because they lacked numerical strength, and saw the rise of the zelanti as a political force in the election of the next pope. Ottoboni was eventually unanimously elected with the consent of the secular monarchs, becoming the first Venetian in over 200 years to be elected pope. Background The central political issue concerning the papacy during the pontificate of Innocent XI was the diplomatic tension between the papacy and the French monarchy over the droit de r√©gale, the claimed right of French monarchs to receive the income of dioceses during the interregnum between the death of one bishop and the installation of a new one. In response to a bull from Innocent condemning the practice, the French held a national synod in 1682, which upheld this right of the king. Innocent, in return, refused to confirm French bishops, causing there to be thirty-five vacancies by 1688. Louis XIV responded in kind, by seizing the papal territory Avignon. In ecclesiastical affairs, Innocent was slow in creating cardinals, waiting until 1681, five years after his election, for his first creations. At that time, he created sixteen cardinals, all of whom were Italian. This caused anger among Catholic monarchs, because there were few remaining non-Italians in the college at that time. At his next creation of cardinals in 1686 he created twenty-seven cardinals, including one French cardinal and eleven other non-Italians. In total during Innocent's pontificate, he created a total of forty-three cardinals, while fifty-two had died. Conclave Innocent XI died on 12 August 1689. At the time of his death, there were eight vacancies in the College of Cardinals. The conclave to elect his successor opened on 23 August 1689, but due to the late arrival of the French cardinals, no significant voting occurred until a month later. The French cardinals arrived to Rome on 23 September 1689, and entered the conclave on 27 September. Gregory XV's 1621 bull Aeterni Patris Filius set the threshold for election by scrutiny at two- thirds of participating electors. Fifty-three cardinals participated in the 1689 conclave, and seven of those were non-Italian. Of the Italian cardinals, seventeen were from the Papal States. Innocent XI's creations were generally not aligned with any of the secular rulers at the time, and this was reflected in the election with the French faction having only five members, while the cardinals aligned with the Habsburgs, who ruled Spain and the Holy Roman Empire, only numbered seven. The Squadrone Volante, which had been a presence at recent conclaves, was not a factor in the 1689 conclave, due to the recent deaths of Christina, Queen of Sweden and Decio Azzolino. Instead, the college saw the rise of an influential zelanti faction with nine members who sought \\"[...] to elect the best pope, regardless of political ties.\\" Francesco Maria de' Medici took charge of the Spanish contingent while Rinaldo d'Este led the French factions. Flavio Chigi and Paluzzo Paluzzi Altieri degli Albertoni, who had previously led factions combined their forces due to their decreased number, and joined with Benedetto Pamphili and Medici. Charles d'Albert d'Ailly, who was the Duke of Chaulnes served with d'Este and the Marquis de Tore as Louis XIV's advisors regarding the conclave. Medici was joined by Luis Francisco de la Cerda as the Spanish ambassador to the Holy See. The Holy Roman Emperor, Leopold I, dispatched Anton Florian, Prince of Liechtenstein to the conclave as his representative, not being content to be represented by Medici. Liechtenstein was received in audience at the doors of the conclave on 27 September and d'Ailly on 2 October. Raimondo Capizucchi and Gregorio Barbarigo were both considered early in the conclave, but neither was elected. There were rumours on 20 September that Barbarigo had been elected, but it was later reported that he had asked the cardinals not to vote for him. Election of Alexander VIII Pietro Vito Ottoboni had been seen as the most qualified candidate since the opening of the conclave, but those supporting him moved circumspectly because it was anticipated that he would have enemies as a Venetian. He was supported by the zelanti, as well as by Chigi. Chigi eventually convinced Medici and Altieri to also support Ottoboni. He was not Leopold I's favoured candidate, and Louis XIV was initially opposed to his election, but both eventually consented. His supporters also promised that he would confirm the French bishops that Innocent XI had refused to confirm, and this was the final step in securing his election. Ottoboni was 79 when the conclave opened, and this was also seen as a positive factor in his election. On 6 October 1689, Ottoboni was elected Pope Alexander VIII unanimously by forty-nine cardinal electors. He was the first Venetian pope in over two centuries. Ottoboni decided to take the name of Alexander in honour of Flavio Chigi's uncle, Alexander VII, as Chigi had aided in his election, and he also respected Pope Alexander III, who was popular among Venetians. He had originally considered taking the name Urban, in honour of Urban VIII, who had helped start his career, before he settled on Alexander.

This name likely refers to a Pictish king whose name is recorded variously as Onnust, Hungus. According to historian Alex Woolf, the early Gaelic form of the name, Oengus, was borrowed from the British Pictish Onuist, which appears in British as Ungust. Woolf noted that these names are all derived from the Celtic *Oinogustos. Linguist John Kneen derived this name from two Celtic elements the following way: *Oino-gustos, meaning \\"one- choice\\". which is a transcription of Woolf also stated that between about AD 350 and AD 660, the Insular Celtic dialects underwent changes which included the loss of the final syllables and unstressed vowels, which affected *Oinogustos thus: *Oin ~~o~~ gust ~~os~~.

It is one of the lower sulfur oxides. It is a colourless gas and condenses to give a pale coloured solid that is unstable at room temperature. It is a bent molecule with an S‚àíS‚àíO angle of 117.88¬∞, S‚àíS bond length of 188.4 pm, and S‚àíO bond length of 146.5 pm. Disulfur monoxide was discovered by Peter W. Schenk in 1933. However, only when Myers and Meschi studied it, did the actual composition and shape of the molecule become known. Preparation It can be formed by many methods, including combustion of sulfur vapour in a deficiency of oxygen. It arises by oxidizing sulfur with copper(II) oxide: :3 S8 \\\\+ 12 CuO ‚Üí 12 CuS + 4 S2O + 4 SO2 Other routes include the reaction of thionyl chloride with silver(I) sulfide: :SOCl2 \\\\+ Ag2S ‚Üí 2 AgCl + S2O It also arises via thermal decomposition of sulfur dioxide in a glow discharge. Disulfur monoxide forms a yellow solution in carbon tetrachloride. The solid can be obtained at liquid nitrogen temperatures, often appearing dark-colored owing to impurities. On decomposition at room temperature it forms SO2 via the formation of polysulfur oxides. =Discovery= Disulfur monoxide was first produced by P. W. Schenk in 1933 with a glow discharge though sulfur vapour and sulfur dioxide. He discovered that the gas could survive for hours at single digit pressures of mercury in clean glass, but decomposed near . Schenk assigned the formula as SO and called it sulfur monoxide. In 1940, K. Kondratyeva and V. Kondratyev proposed the formula as S2O2, disulfur dioxide. In 1956, D. J. Meschi and R. J. Myers established the formula as S2O. Natural occurrence The bacterium Desulfovibrio desulfuricans is claimed to produce S2O. S2O can be found coming from volcanoes on Io. It can form between 1% and 6% when hot 100-bar S2 and SO2 gas erupts from volcanoes. It is believed that Pele on Io is surrounded by solid S2O. Properties Condensed solid S2O displays absorption bands at 420 and 530 nm. These are likely to be due to S3 and S4. The microwave spectrum of S2O has the following rotational parameters: A = 41915.44 MHz, B = 5059.07 MHz, and C = 4507.19 MHz. In the ultraviolet S2O has absorption band systems in the ranges 250‚Äì340 nm and 190‚Äì240 nm. There are bands at 323.5 and 327.8 nm. The band in the 315‚Äì340 nm range is due to the transition. The bond angle S‚àíS‚àíO is 109¬∞. The harmonic frequency for S‚àíS stretching is 415.2 cm‚àí1. Reactions A self-decomposition (disproportionation) of S2O can form trisulfur and sulfur dioxide: :2 S2O ‚Üí S3 \\\\+ SO2 Also 5,6-di-tert-butyl-2,3,7-trithiabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene 2-endo-7-endo-dioxide when heated can form S2O. It reacts with diazoalkanes to form dithiirane 1-oxides. Disulfur monoxide is a ligand bound to transition metals. These are formed by oxidation peroxide oxidation of a disulfur ligand. Excessive oxygen can yield a dioxygendisulfur ligand, which can be reduced in turn with triphenylphosphine. Examples are: [Ir(dppe)2S2O]+, OsCl(NO)(PPh3)2S2O, NbCl(Œ∑-C5H5)2S2O, Mn(CO)2(Œ∑-C5Me5)S2O, Re(CO)2(Œ∑-C5Me5)S2O, Re(CO)2(Œ∑-C5H5)S2O. The molybdenum compound Mo(CO)2(S2CNEt2)2 reacts with elemental sulfur and air to form a compound Mo2(S2O)2(S2CNEt2)4. Another way to form these complexes is to combine sulfonyliminooxo-Œª4-sulfurane (OSNSO2¬∑R) complexes with hydrogen sulfide. Complexes formed in this way are: IrCl(CO)(PPh3)2S2O; Mn(CO)2(Œ∑-C5H5)S2O. With hydrosulfide and a base followed by oxygen, OsCl(NO)(PPh3)2S2O can be made. Cyclic disulfur monoxide has been made from S2O by irradiating the solid in an inert gas matrix with 308 nm ultraviolet light.

Derived from the Old Irish given name O√≠ngus, it is composed of Celtic elements meaning \\"one\\", and \\"choice\\". A variant spelling of the Scottish Gaelic name (which is also found in Ireland as an alternative spelling of the Irish form of the name) is Aonghus. The Irish form of the Scottish Gaelic names is Aengus. A pet form of the Scottish Gaelic name is Angaidh, which is represented in English as Angie. The earliest form of the given name Angus, and its cognates, occurs in Adomn√°n's Vita Columbae (English: \\"Life of Columba\\") as Oinogusius, Oinogussius. This name likely refers to a Pictish king whose name is recorded variously as Onnust, Hungus. According to historian Alex Woolf, the early Gaelic form of the name, Oengus, was borrowed from the Pictish Onuist, which appears in British as Ungust. Woolf noted that these names are all derived from the Celtic *Oinogustos. Linguist John Kneen derived this name from two Celtic elements the following way: *Oino-gustos, meaning \\"one-choice\\". which is a transcription of Woolf also stated that between about AD 350 and AD 660, the Insular Celtic dialects underwent changes which included the loss of the final syllables and unstressed vowels, which affected *Oinogustos thus: *Oin ~~o~~ gust ~~os~~.

Born into a wealthy Pennsylvania family, he attended the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, and after serving as a surgeon in the American Civil War, continued to teach at the University. A member of the National Academy of Sciences, he was known for his 1874 text Treatise on Therapeutics, which became a widely used medical textbook, and also for his botanical and zoological work: writing on freshwater algae, fossil plants, arachnids, and myriapods. Family Horatio C. Wood was part of the illustrious Wood family of Pennsylvania. Many of his relatives share similar names, and there is some confusion over Wood's own middle name. Although reported in different sources as \\"Horatio Charles Wood\\" and \\"Horatio Curtis Wood\\", his son, Horatio Charles Wood Jr., has stated that his father's middle name was simply the letter C, without a period. This was a compromise between Wood's parents, his mother preferring the middle name Charles and his father, Horatio Curtis Wood, preferring Curtis. The family were Philadelphia Quakers descended from Richard Wood who sailed from Bristol with William Penn. Later in life, Wood also signed himself \\"Horatio C Wood, Sr.\\", to distinguish him from his son. Career Portrait of Dr. Horatio C. Wood Jr. (1886) by Thomas Eakins, Detroit Institute of Arts. Wood started studying medicine at the Medical Department of the University of Pennsylvania in 1859, and graduated in 1862, having presented a thesis on \\"enteric fever\\". While still a student, Wood wrote his first scientific paper, reporting on the Carboniferous flora of the United States. He served several internships in hospitals, and acted as a surgeon for the Northern army during the American Civil War, including a spell at the front-line Fairfax Seminary General Hospital. After the Civil War, Wood supplemented his income by teaching privately at the medical school. He was awarded the chair of botany at the university, and was elected \\"Clinical Lecturer in Nervous Diseases\\" at the medical school in 1873, later rising to Clinical Professor. He was made Professor of Materia Medica and Pharmacy in 1876, and added General Therapeutics to his title later that year. Upon his retirement in 1907, Wood was granted the title of Emeritus Professor of Therapeutics. Wood was a member of various scientific societies, including the American Physiological Society and the National Academy of Sciences, having joined the latter in 1879, the same year as Cleveland Abbe, William G. Farlow and Willard Gibbs. He was awarded honorary degrees by Lafayette College, Yale University and the University of Pennsylvania. A species of snake, Cubophis vudii, is named in his honor.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (\\"Vud\\", p. 277). Works Wood's fame was established by his 1874 work Treatise on Therapeutics, which became the principal textbook in materia medica and therapeutics for 30 years. Wood published fourteen botanical papers between 1860 and 1877, including a 270-page monograph on freshwater algae. In his earlier years, Wood also studied myriapods (centipedes and millipedes) and arachnids: his 1865 The Myriapoda of North America included the first complete list of North American millipedes. Species named by Wood include Scolopendra polymorpha, the giant desert centipede, and Harpaphe haydeniana, the yellow- spotted millipede. Wood's arachnological papers concerned whip scorpions and harvestmen. Three of Wood's papers were awarded prizes. His 1869 paper Research upon American Hemp won him a special prize from the American Philosophical Society; the Warren Prize of the Massachusetts General Hospital was awarded for his Experimental Researches in the Physiological Action of Amyl Nitrite; in 1872, he won the Boylston Prize for his Thermic Fever or Sunstroke. Wood was the editor of several scientific journals, including New Remedies (1870‚Äì1873), Philadelphia Medical Times (1873‚Äì1880), The Therapeutic Gazette (1884‚Äì1890) and the U. S.

Donations were collected mainly by Pitchai Ghani Rawuthar and Ave Mohamed Yusuf (both now deceased). This mosque was then re-built in 1990 by Ave Mohamed Yusuf's son, Ave Abdul Hameed with his own funds without any donations from the public. However, Ave Abdul Hameed's son Ave Abdul Bachir had said that he had donated US$100,000 (approximately evquivilant to about 4 Million Indian Rupees then) in a single payment from Switzerland towards the reconstruction of this mosque.

Each episode depicts a high-ranking executive or business owner acting as an entry-level employee to discover the problems in their company. On 15 November 2010, Network Ten renewed the show for a second series. The second series began airing on 12 September 2011.  Format  Each episode features a high- positioned executive or the owner of a corporation going undercover as an entry-level employee in their own company. The executive changes their appearance and assumes an alias and fictional back-story. The fictitious explanation for the accompanying camera crew is that the executive is being filmed as part of a documentary about entry-level workers in a particular industry. They spend approximately one week undercover, working in various areas of the company's operations, with a different job and in most cases a different location each day. The boss is exposed to a series of predicaments with amusing results. They invariably spend time getting to know the people who work in the company, learning about their professional and personal challenges. At the end of their week undercover, the boss returns to their true identity and requests the employees they worked with individually to corporate headquarters. The boss reveals their identity and rewards hard- working employees through campaign, promotion or financial rewards. Other employees are given training or better working conditions.

There are not many written documents about Kalyal Dynasty and Chandannath preserved. The events and lore had been passed orally for generations. = Chandannath Baba of Kashmir = People believe that there was a person named Chandannath who hailed from Kashmir, had brought the statue of the Dattatreya (also known as Trimurti).

That is, once there was a Cow, which didn't give milk to her owner in the cowshed. But one day, when it stood above the place where now the temple exists, milk began to drop from its teats. Her owner saw that and told all the villagers. People believed that the place was sacred as Cow was offering its milk. Then, they established this temple at the very holy place.http://www.himkalaadventure.com/chandannath-temple-tour.html  Practices  In this temple, local people change lingo every year. The lingo is a timber whose length is approximately more than 52 feet which are colored with brick red color and a huge cloth is stitched around it, which makes it looks like a triangular flag. People strongly believe that something wrong is going to happen if that lingo is broken during the change. This lingo replacement ceremony is held during Ghatasthapana, which is the first day of Dashain. During this day, the temple is crowded with devotees. A large number of people are also seen in the temple on the occasion of Krishna Janmashtami, Maha Shivaratri and other major Hindu Festival.

He was related to Chello Toros (1871‚Äì1893), one of the fighters of the Armenian irregular units against the Ottoman Empire. During the years of the Armenian Genocide, Dzarugian separated from his mother as a result of the death marches in the Syrian desert and spent his childhood in the Armenian Orphanage of Aleppo. In 1921, he met his mother in Aleppo and moved to the local Haygazian Armenian School to receive his elementary education. In the same year, his father was arrested and killed in the Marash prison for his participation in the patriotic movement against the Ottoman Empire.Nshanag.net (in Armenian) After completing his elementary schooling in Aleppo, Dzarugian moved to Beirut to complete his education at the newly opened Armenian College. Among his teachers in the college were prominent Armenian educators such as Nikol Aghbalian and Levon Shant. He became a dropout, and later started his career as a teacher in the Armenian schools of Aleppo and Beirut. Books and publications He first published the Nayiri literary monthly in Aleppo (1945-1952), and afterwards he moved it to Beirut, where he published it as a literary, cultural and political weekly (1952-1983). His first book Yegherapakhd Kertoghner (in Armenian ‘µ’≤’•÷Ä’°’¢’°’≠’ø ÷Ñ’•÷Ä’©’∏’≤’∂’•÷Ä) was about Armenian poets and literary figures martyred during the Armenian genocide in Ottoman Turkey.

Eug√®ne, who was the Viceroy of the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy inflicted a defeat on Hiller's troops, driving them from Caldiero. The action took place during the War of the Sixth Coalition, part of the Napoleonic Wars. Caldiero is located east of Verona on the Autostrada A4. When Austria entered the war against Napoleon in August 1813, Eug√®ne attempted to defend the Illyrian Provinces east of Italy. Ultimately, the Austrians compelled the Franco-Italian army to retreat to the Adige River. As Hiller's forces closed in on Verona from the north and east, Eug√®ne tried to fend them off. The viceroy pushed back the northern force, then rushed back to attack Paul von Radivojevich's Austrians at Caldiero. On the 15th, his divisions under Fran√ßois Jean Baptiste Quesnel and Marie Fran√ßois Rouyer drove the Austrians back to Soave. Then Eug√®ne pulled most of his troops back to the west bank of the Adige, leaving only Pierre-Louis Binet de Marcognet's division on the east bank. Hiller attacked Marcognet between San Michele and San Martino Buon Albergo on the 19th, but was repulsed after a hard fight. By this time, a new Austrian threat appeared to the south at Ferrara. Battle Historian Alain Pigeard stated that the Austrians lost 1,500 killed and wounded, plus 1,000 captured out of a total of 18,000 troops engaged. He noted that 16,000 French soldiers were present during their victory, but gave no losses.Pigeard (2004), 172-173 Digby Smith asserted that the French lost 500 killed and wounded out of 16,000 troops in their triumph, while the Austrians suffered 500 killed and wounded plus 900 men and two guns captured.Smith (1998), 479 Frederick C.

The bean-shaped island stretches from North to South on a length of around , it is rather flat and generally forested. Natural jungle has been replaced by coconut trees and forest crops for commercial purposes. Settlements are mainly in the North, while the southern third is almost non-populated. The tiny Ghost Island/Koh Khmauch (·ûÄ·üÑ·üá·ûÅ·üí·ûò·üÑ·ûÖ) - east to west and north to south - lies just about west off its southern end.  Community  As in most of Cambodia, the government is largely nonfunctional even to the extent that the de facto currency is the Thai baht. A large portion of the economy is of a subsistence nature with a large reliance on fishing. Roughly 70% of the working population are fishermen with most of the rest being farmers or small-time businessmen. Most of the fish that is caught is sold to Thailand.  Legend  According to legend, there once was a king who commanded an army on the island. Because there was no fresh water, the king searched everywhere to find some. At last he found a rock near the sea. Thinking the rock might contain water; the king drew his sword and split open the rock, releasing an endless flow of water that local people still use today.

Early life and education Benedict Nordentoft was born in the rectory at Brabrand, a town just west of Aarhus, Denmark, on 17 January 1873. He was the seventh of the thirteen gifted children raised by Pastor Peter Nordentoft and Vincentia Christiane Michelsen.\\"Fra Solvang i Californien til √Üblehaven i Tommerup\\" , Kirkebladet for Tommerup og Broholm Sogne, Efer√•r 2010. Retrieved 1 October 2010. In the footsteps of the famous theologian and philosopher N. F. S. Grundtvig, from the age of 11 he attended the Aarhus Cathedral School before studying theology at Copenhagen University. Later he would comment: \\"Although I was often moved by the sermons of Grundtvigian priests and although many of my student friends were Grundtvigians, I have never been able to accept Grundtvig's excessively dogmatic views.\\" After graduating with honours in 1898, he became a substitute teacher at Herlufsholm School before bec√≥ming a tutor for Count Brockenhuus-Schack's eldest son in Ringsted in 1899. Though pleased with his position, he could not resist the urge to go to America where he had been offered a post as a lecturer at Grand View College, a Danish seminary and folk high school in Des Moines, Iowa, believing that America would open up new horizons for him. Years in the United States One of his first tasks as a lecturer at Grand View was to coordinate relations between Danish Lutheran churches in Michigan, Ohio, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Maine. In the summer of 1901, he returned to Denmark specifically to be ordained in Aarhus Cathedral. Back in America, he continued his work as a lecturer at Grand View. In 1903, when he was only 30 years old, he became the college president, a post which he held until 1910.Rolf Buschardt Christensen, \\"Benedict Nordentoft\\". Retrieved 1 October 2010. That year, as a result of differences with his colleagues at the college who were far more Grundtvigian than he, Nordentoft was pressured to leave. From 1906, Nordentoft together with Jens M. Gregersen, a pastor from Kimballton, Iowa, and Peder P. Hornsyld, a lecturer at Grand View, had discussed the possibility of creating a new Danish colony with a dedicated Lutheran church and school on the west coast.Mortensen, Enok, 1977, \\"Schools for Life: The Grundtvigian Folk Schools in America\\". Danish American Heritage Society. Askov (Minnesota): American Publishing, p. 97. In 1910, together with other Danish-Americans, they created the Danish-American Colony Company in San Francisco. Later that year, their land agent, Mads J. Frese, found suitable land in the Santa Ynez Valley northwest of Santa Barbara. On 23 January 1911, the contract was signed and Solvang was founded. The Danes had bought almost 9,000 acres of the Rancho San Carlos de Jonata land grant, paying an average of $40 per acre.Pat Murphy, \\"Remember When?\\", Santa Ynez Valley Guest Magazine , Spring 2004. Retrieved 13 July 2010. Soon after the establishment of Solvang, a school was opened with 21 students on 15 November 1911 with Nordentoft as president. At the end of 1912 when it became almost impossible to sell any more plots of land, the company's income was vastly reduced. The shareholders persuaded Gregersen to give up his position as Solvang's pastor and travel to Iowa and Nebraska to convince Danish immigrants to buy land in the new colony. He enjoyed considerable success, relieving the colony of any further threats. After Gregersen's departure, Nordentoft became the pastor. Before long, Solvang also had a store, a bank, a lumber yard, a barbershop and a post office with Hornsyld as postmaster. Where there had just been fields, there was now a small town. =Solvang's folk high school= Nordentoft was not content with the little school established in Solvang. When he was unable to convince his Danish colleagues that a larger educational institution was needed, he bought them out and started to raise funds for a bigger and better school. The following year, in August 1914, a rejsegilde, or topping-out ceremony, was held for the impressive new building which Nordentoft called Atterdag College in memory of Valdemar Atterdag who did much to consolidate the kingdom of Denmark in the 14th century. What surprised many of those who came to the celebration was the great similarity the building had with Grand View College. Standing on a hilltop with a commanding view of the village, the new college or folk high school was designed to teach Danish-speaking students in their late teens how to lead more meaningful lives with an emphasis on lectures, singing, gymnastics, folk dancing and fellowship. A difficult period followed as World War I put a stop to Danish emigration to America leading to a reduction in the number of young people requiring a school education. It also became difficult to maintain a Danish-speaking school at a time when American nationalism was steadily growing. On 26 April 1918 when he was 45, Nordentoft married 20-year-old Mary Hansine Christiansen, the daughter of a Danish farmer from Newell, Iowa, and one of his earlier students. By 1921, the family had two children and a third was on the way. Nordentoft, who felt he had achieved his ambitions in America and wished to have his children educated in Denmark, sold the college to the congregation of Solvang's Bethania Church in 1921 for $5,000. He then returned to Denmark with his wife and family.\\"History of Solvang\\", Elverh√∏j Museum. Retrieved 14 September 2010. Later life Back in Denmark in 1921, he was first a priest in Tranebjerg on Sams√∏, then in Mariager and in March 1926 he became pastor of St Nicolai Church in Kolding. The family who raised no less than 11 children were always very welcoming to anyone who wished to visit them at the rectory in Hyrdestr√¶de. All the children were given the middle name Atterdag in memory of the college. Nordentoft not only taught at the high school in Kolding but became a popular public speaker in the area, thanks to his entertaining and humorous delivery. He often spoke affectionately about his years in America and was active on the committee for the Danish-American Mission. In 1941, he was awarded the Order of the Dannebrog for his services to Danish-American relations. Benedict Nordentoft died in Kolding on 12 December 1942. A few years later, the authorities in Solvang decided to name two streets in his memory: Nordentoft Way and Kolding Avenue.

There was also a Co-op, which later became an antique shop before being converted into apartments. In the 1970s proposals were made to build houses on the land, but a petition was raised and many signatures obtained, so subsequently, and thankfully, saving the green fields from this fate. In 1977, the Queen's Silver Jubilee was celebrated on the public playing field off Andrew Street, with a gala and fair, with donkey cart rides provided by Reg Cook from Cinderland Hall Farm, who still resides there in 2013, with his wife, Margaret. In around the year 2000, the M60 Manchester ring road motorway was completed, cutting through littlemoss, to which a fair amount of grazing land and some properties were lost, including the 'Army Camp' which had been converted into stables and horse grazing.

Kira Yoshitsugu, a son of Kira Mochihiro, served under Oda Nobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu adopted the family name of Nishio. Under the Tokugawa shogunate, the Nishio, as hereditary vassals of the Tokugawa clan, were classified as one of the fudai daimy≈ç clans.Appert, Georges. (1888). Ancien Japon, p. 75 Nishio Yoshitsugu was given the 12,000 koku Haraichi Domain in Musashi Province in 1602. His son, Nishio Tadanaga was transferred to the 20,000 koku Shirai Domain in K≈çzuke Province in 1616, and subsequently to Tsuchiura Domain (Hitachi Province) from 1617-1649. The clan then ruled Tanaka Domain (Suruga Province) from 1649-1679, Komoro Domain (Shinano Province) from 1679-1682, and finally settled at Yokosuka Domain (T≈çt≈çmi Province) from 1682-1868. After the Meiji Restoration, the Nishio clan was transferred to the short-lived Hanabusa Domain in Awa Province, and was subsequently granted the kazoku title of viscount (shishaku).

Aghaviller gives its name to the wider townland, civil parish, and electoral district. Located south-east of Kilkenny, about six miles south of Thomastown near Knocktopher. Etymology The Annals of the Four Masters call it Achadh-biorair (Ahabirrer), meaning the field of watercresses. Tighe refers to Agha-oillir, meaning field of the pilgrim. Church and tower Interior of Aghaviller ruined church A few yards distant from the site of the old church, is the remains of the lower part of an ancient round tower composed of breccia. The Statistical Survey of 1802, makes reference to the tower, as does the 1855 Kilkenny Archaeological Society. It is one of five round towers located around the county, the others are at Kilkenny, Tullaherin, Kilree and Grangefertagh. The tower is different from many round towers as it has two doors. Nearby is a holy well and Castlemorres Demesne.

The crossroads it sat near would eventually bear the same name, Cashtown. In 1815, Marck acquired a tavern license and originally had four rooms available. During the Gettysburg Campaign, the inn became the headquarters for many Confederate officers and staff, including Generals A. P. Hill, John D. Imboden, and Henry Heth. The basement also served as a field hospital during the battle, and it is said that so many amputations were performed, that the limbs piled up outside blocked any sunlight from coming in the cellar window.

Postage is now under the control of Postverk F√∏roya, the Postage Stamp Department of which has taken over all the work relating to Faroese postage stamps. Skj√∫ts Conscripted post boat (skj√∫tsb√°tur). Skj√∫ts relied on a Skj√∫tsskaffari (i.e., agent) being appointed in every village with the duty of organising a crew to transport people, letters or parcels from one village to another. The Skj√∫ts system was actually introduced in around the mid-1860s, with the first Skj√∫ts Act coming into force in 1865. Skj√∫ts charges were laid down by the L√∏gting, the Faroese Representative Council, for 5 years at a time. There were three types of Skj√∫ts: official, clerical and private. The charges for Skj√∫ts varied, with official being the cheapest and private the most expensive. There was no charge for Skj√∫ts prior to 1865. All healthy males of between 15 and 50 years of age were liable for Skj√∫ts duty: i.e., they could not refuse without incurring a fine. It was never an easy task to transport mail from one island to another across perilous waters where there were often powerful currents. The Skj√∫ts system existed until around World War I, but was not used as much by then, as the Post Office's rates were relatively low and so represented a reasonable alternative. First post offices Post Office, T√≥rshavn The first Faroese post office was opened in T√≥rshavn on 1 March 1870. Others opened at Tv√∏royri and Klaksv√≠k on 1 March 1884 and 1 May 1888 respectively. The management of the post at all three was conducted by the local s√Ωsluma√∞ur. These were the only Faroes post offices opened in the 19th century, but seven were opened in 1903 and, during the next twenty-five years, post offices were opened in essentially all of the settlements on the Faroes. 15 new offices were opened in 1918 alone. Wartime stamp shortages Danish stamps were in use from 1870, usually without any overprint or surcharge, until the first Faroese stamps were issued in 1975. The 2 √∏re \\"chair leg stamp\\" of 1919. After the First World War, the Faroese Post Office was forced to use so-called provisional stamps. On 8 December 1918, the Post Office in T√≥rshavn received a message from Copenhagen about the following increase of postal rates: * inland letters on the Faroes up to 250 grain (15 g) from 5 √∏re to 7 √∏re * postcards to Denmark up to 250 grain (15 g) from 4 √∏re to 7 √∏re The increase in postal rates came into force on 1 January 1919. Due to unreliable shipping connections, the supply of new 7-√∏re postage stamps failed to reach the Post Office in T√≥rshavn before 1 January 1919. When it became apparent that the increase in the postal rates would bring about a heavy demand for stamps amounting to 7 √∏re, and that the Faroese Post Offices¬¥ stock of supplementary stamps, 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-√∏re, would not be sufficient to meet demand, special provisions had to be made. Thus the Post Office in T√≥rshavn received authorization to bisect the ordinary 4-√∏re stamps and use the individual halves as 2-√∏re stamps. When the stock of 4-√∏re stamps began to run low, the Post Office was given authorization to overprint the required number of 5-√∏re stamps and use them as 2-√∏re stamps. For this purpose a hand stamp was made out of a wooden block bearing the letters \\"2 √òRE\\". Part of a chair leg was used as handle, and therefore the stamp was called the \\"chair leg stamp\\". A similar situation arose in 1940‚Äì41. Following the German occupation of Denmark, the Faroes were under British administration from 12 April 1940 until the end of the Second World War in 1945. A shortage of Danish stamps was again resolved by the Post Office in T√≥rshavn overprinting the required number of stamps with a 20-√∏re surcharge.Gibbons, Europe and Colonies 1970, pp.195‚Äì196. The first Faroese stamps In 1974‚Äì75, the Danish postal system began issuing Faroese postage stamps with the caption F√òROYAR.Jonathan Wylie, \\"Leif Groth, Danish High Commissioner for the Faroes\\" in Jonathan Wylie and David Margolin, The Ring of Dancers: Images of Faroese Culture, Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1981, , pp. 137-39, p. 138. The postal system used these stamps in the Faroes for franking mail and sold them to philatelists. The first Faroese postage stamps came on the market on 30 January 1975. From the first day they were available, the interest in Faroese postage stamps has been very extensive abroad. A number of times, postage stamps have been the second-largest source of export revenues for the Faroes. Until 1 April 1976, the Faroese postal system was under the direction of Post Danmark (Post and Telegraph System). At that time the Faroese postal system was organised so that it had a post office (T√≥rshavn Post Office) managed by a postmaster. Then came the postal clerks with the so-called postal agents as managers. The postal clerks were located in the following settlements: Klaksv√≠k, Tv√∏royri, V√°gur, Vestmanna and Saltangar√°. All the other post offices were divided into two groups. The larger ones were called \\"letter collection sites\\", and the smaller were called \\"postal exchange sites\\". Together with T√≥rshavn, these five post offices are still the main post offices. Postverk F√∏roya Merlin. It won the award \\"2nd most beautiful stamp in Europe\\" in 2004. Artist: Edward Fugl√∏. After the election for the L√∏gting in November 1974, the government decided that the postal service in the Faroes should be taken over by the Faroese Home Rule. In 1975, the Danish government and the Faroese government began negotiations on the takeover issue. The results of these negotiations led to the Faroese government taking over the postal service in the Faroes as of 1 April 1976. This new institution received the name Postverk F√∏roya (Post of the Faroes). A ram's horn was chosen as the institution's logo. As a natural consequence of the takeover, two new departments were established within the Faroese postal system: the Postage Stamp Department and the Post Office Giro. Since the founding of Postverk F√∏roya in 1976, the Postage Stamp Department has taken over all the work relating to the postage stamps. The department organises all production, issuance and sales of postage stamps. Work was being done on restructuring the Faroese postal system, with the intent being for Postverk F√∏roya, which was a public institution, to be reorganised into a type of joint-stock enterprise. The postal system however continued to be a public company. The Faroe Islands postal service was restructured as a limited liability company on 1 January 2005. The name was changed to the \\"P/F Postverk F√∏roya‚Äù (i.e. Faroe Islands Postal Service Limited). The Faroe Islands Government is the sole shareholder of the company. The name was changed again in September 2009, this time to \\"Posta Faroe Islands\\" or just ‚ÄúPosta‚Äù. At the same time a new logo was introduced. The new Posta logo is composed by two staggered arrows that are pointing in opposite directions, a symbol of \\"Receive\\" and \\"Send\\". The first arrow is sea blue color while the second arrow is green, a symbol of the ocean and the islands. http://en.stamps.fo/ References Bibliography * Stanley Gibbons Ltd, various catalogues * Stanley Gibbons Ltd, Europe and Colonies 1970, Stanley Gibbons Ltd, 1969 *Rossiter, Stuart & John Flower.

It was written circa 1973 and first appeared in their album released in 1974, Live From Scotland Volume 1. The title of the song refers to the symbol of Charles Edward Stuart, which was a white rose. The words represent Jacobitism and modern Scottish Nationalism. In the first verse, Browne mentions two battles between Scotland and England as well as the Jacobite uprising of 1745-6; Bannockburn, Flodden, and Culloden. The second verse mentions Scottish mass emigration and the industry of Scottish immigrants (\\"carved out the New World with sweat, blood, and hand\\"). The 'New World' refers to countries such as America and Canada, where the Scottish population emigrated to in the 1800s (or were shipped to penal colonies there in earlier periods). The third verse of the song references Scottish industrialisation of the 20th century and seems to mentions the hopes for a devolved or independent Scotland (Black Gold and fisheries etc). This is plausible, as Browne often mentioned Scottish independence in his songs. Roses o' Prince Charlie's timing is 2/4, although when played to crowds it was played faster due to the audience clapping to a faster timing than it was played in a studio. It was meant for two guitars, with both players singing the chorus and one singing each verse (as it was commonly sung by The Corries, which Browne was notably a part of). The song appeared on Live From Scotland Volume 1, The Lads among heather (Volume 1 and 2), and The Corries 21st anniversary concert. After Roy Williamson's death, Ronnie Browne sang this song in his solo album released in 1996, Battle Songs and Ballads.  Lyrics  (Chorus) Come now, gather round, here where the flowers grow, White is the blossom as the snow on the ben. Hear now freedom's call, we'll make a solemn vow Now by the roses o' Prince Charlie.

The prefix 'post' shows that it is different from the demographic data that tries to organize groups, markets and voters in society. Where of interests are not the traditional demographics of race, ethnicity, age, income, educational level or derivations thereof such as class, but rather tastes and other information supplied to make and maintain an online profile. From a post-demographics perspective, the profile lies at the core of research into social networking sites, as it provides information that moves beyond the demographic, organized according to ‚Äòinterested‚Äô and ‚Äòfavorites‚Äô, with more specific sub-categories as brands, music, movies, animals, etc.Rogers, R. (2009) ‚ÄúPost-Demographic Machines‚Äù. In Annet Dekker and Annette Wolfsberger (eds.), Walled Garden. Amsterdam: Virtual Platform, 29-39.  Method  The object of study are social networking sites, which are defined as sites where users can create a profile and connect that profile to other profiles for the purposes of making an explicit personal network. Instead of user-participation, observation, surveying as well as other approaches imported from the social sciences, the post-demographic methods depart from a non-user perspective. A non-user perspective is someone who does not use the social networking site to manage friendships or to flirt, but still visit the site and read the profiles. They are particularly interested in the data sets that they can retrieve from profiles. The post-demographic method strives to think through what the profilers would do, and builds upon it. Thus, first it is important to identify the constraints per social networking platform in harvesting data. Once data may be harvested, the further step is to identify the set of relationships that could be studied, e.g., do friends have the same interests? The method tries to understand for which purposes are interests a more significant mode of organizing and recommending action than demographics.

He then came out against the Adventist understanding of the investigative judgment and believed that the atonement occurred at Christ's crucifixion and that He had entered the Most Holy Place at His ascension contrary to SDA Doctrine, which teaches that the atonement work continued in the heavenly sanctuary when Christ ascended to the Holy Place, and then in 1844, at the end of the prophetic period of 2300 days, Christ entered the Most Holy Place.

At the 1901 General Conference Session, Ellen White criticized the Holy Flesh teachings as \\"error\\" on April 17 stating: \\"The Holy Spirit never reveals Itself in such methods, in such a bedlam of noise. This is an invention of Satan to cover up his ingenious methods for making of none effect the pure, sincere, elevating, ennobling, sanctifying truth for this time.

Rather, specific kinds of abortion are prohibited, for various social and political reasons. In the earliest texts, it can be difficult to discern to what extent a particular religious injunction held force as secular law. In later texts, the rationale for abortion laws may be sought in a wide variety of fields including philosophy, religion, and jurisprudence. These rationales were not always included in the wording of the actual laws. Ancient sources Tribal people in more modern times have been had access to many herbal abortifacients,Native American ethnobotany By Daniel E.

Some of these are mentioned in the earliest literature of the ancient world, however citations for abortion related matters are scarce in the earliest written texts. =Social considerations= In the ancient world, discussions of offspring limitation, whether through contraception, abortion, or infanticide were often entailed in discussions population control,The Return of Quetzalcoatl ‚Äì Chapter 17 property rights of the patriarch, The kindness of strangers: the abandonment of children in Western Europe footnote 21, By John Boswell and of the regulation of women engaged in illicit sex.Spivack, Carla, To Bring Down the Flowers: The Cultural Context of Abortion Law in Early Modern England. Available at SSRN: http://ssrn.com/abstract=1132482 Cicero explains: > \\"I remember a case which occurred when I was in Asia: how a certain woman of > Miletus, who had accepted a bribe from the alternative heirs and procured > her own abortion by drugs, was condemned to death: and rightly, for she had > cheated the father of his hopes, his name of continuity, his family of its > support, his house of an heir, and the Republic of a citizen-to-be.\\"\\"In > Defence of Cluentius\\", Cicero as cited in Greek and Roman Attitudes To > Abortion at Google Docs Families wealthy or poor may have had different reasons for practicing offspring limitation. The wealthy may have been concerned about breaking a large inheritance into numerous smaller portions for many heirs. A poor family may have been unable to feed a large number of children.Boswell, \\"The kindness of strangers: the abandonment of children in Western Europe\\", pg.14, footnotes 20, 21 At times, extreme poverty may have driven some to cannibalism. Aristotle held concerns that would today fall under the rubric eugenics. In his view, abortion and infanticide were permissible when they accorded with the welfare of the state. He advocated mandatory exposure of children born with deformities, and deemed abortion advisable when a couple had exceeded their quota of children, or when a couple had conceived passed their optimal childbearing age,Evangelos Protopapadakis, \\"Should the baby live? Abortion and infanticide: when ontology overlaps ethics and Peter Singer echoes the Stoics\\" in Ancient Culture, European and Serbian Heritage, Series: \\"Antiquity and modern world\\", Scientific Publications of the Serbian Society for Ancient Studies, Novi Sad 2010, v. IV, pp. 396‚Äì407, . Aristotle, \\"Politics\\", Book 7, 16, 20, as cited in Greek and Roman Attitudes To Abortion at Google Docs. as he believed that the eudaimonia of the individual was entwined with the welfare of the state. Plato held views similar to Aristotle's. In Hindu scriptures, the matter is interpreted as reflecting a concern for the preservation of the male seed of the three \\"pure\\" castes, with the meaning of one word associated with abortion, bhr≈´·πáahan, being \\"the killer of a learned Brahmin\\". Offspring limitation facilitated the financial stability of the influential families, preserving social order, and the males of these castes were required to perform important religious rituals.ABORTION FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF EASTERN RELIGIONS: HINDUISM AND BUDDHISM Constantin-Iulian Damian, Romanian Journal of Bioethics, pg. 128, Vol. 8, No. 1, January ‚Äì March 2010 While caste mixing was severely condemned, abortion was not recommended, and the texts elaborated a complex set of rules for the social integration of people born of such unions. Of some concern in all these discussions is the ability of the woman to conceal her pregnancy in the early stages, and to terminate an unwanted pregnancy through the use of herbs or, more rarely, crude surgery. Since menses may be interrupted by medical conditions other than pregnancy, a woman taking an emmenagogue could not necessarily be accused of attempting abortion, even if she did lose a fetus with the bringing on of stopped menses. Therefore, social control of childbirth, essential to the preservation of the social order, could only effectively be exercised after quickening.While the issue of child sacrifice may be included in such discussions, as part of a larger discussion of social attitudes toward children, it is a matter separate from abortion. In general, anything sacrificed to the gods is sacrificed precisely because it is valued by society and is therefore deemed an appropriate gift to the gods. In the case of contraception, abortion and exposure of newborns, the prospective child is not valued and is therefore disposable. =Religious and philosophic considerations= It was not until the Axial Age that religious text began to include explorations of more philosophic concepts, which often involved considerations of the nature of man, which in turn involved considerations of the nature of the soul. There were three main views that had various impacts on the question of abortion: a belief that this material world is accompanied by an incorporeal one, a belief that matter is an illusion and everything is incorporeal, and a belief that everything, including the soul is material in nature. The ancient Egyptians developed a complicated five part version of the nature of man, including both a soul (similar to a modern ghost) and a spirit (similar to the Buddhist stream of consciousness).See Ghosts in ancient Egyptian culture The later Vedic literature, the Atharvaveda and Upanishads, held a doctrine of a World soul and an eternally reincarnating soul that enters the new physical body at conception.http://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=338 At times, these two kinds of soul were believed to be of the same substance. Many Greeks believed in panpsychism (that all things have an individual soul), while others believed that individuals emanate from a World soul, made of a different substance; and it is possible that Plato believed in elements of both.Panpsychism in the West Believers in transmigration of souls had varying opinions. Buddhism rejected the Hindu notion of an eternal soul atman, positing an ephemeral \\"stream of consciousness\\" that enters the physical body at conception. Judaism and Islam also taught various forms of pre-existence of a soul created by God, but believed in only one earthly incarnation, and that the soul enters the body at conception. Plato believed that the pre-existent soul enters the body at first breath. The Stoics considered the fetus to be a part of the woman's body and held that the soul (the pneuma) enters the body when the newborn takes its first breath. Even then, the Stoics believed the child is neither rational being nor moral agent until 14 years of age. Aristotle proposed a theory of progressive ensoulment, stating that the fetus acquired first a vegetative soul, then an animal soul, then a rational soul, with the male providing the \\"rational soul\\" that animated the fetus at 40 days after conception.On the Generation of Animals Opinion in the Islamic world differed as to whether the soul was \\"blown into\\" the fetus at 40 days or 120., Abortion, Tariq Mahmood Hashmi Anglo-Saxon medical texts held that a fetus was \\"a man without a soul\\" until after the third month. Generally, the question of the morality of abortion involved the question of the nature of the \\"animating principle\\", usually called the \\"rational soul\\", when the animating principle entered the body, whether it was an integral part of the bodily form and substance, whether it was pre-existent and subject to reincarnation or pre- existence, and whether a reincarnating soul might suffer as a result of the abortion. On these bases, some societies allowed infanticide of the newborn prior to its first breath (Stoic) or first nourishment (Germanic tribes), while some had differing laws for abortion depending on whether quickening had occurred. =Hippocratic Oath= The Hippocratic Oath is a code of professional conduct that can be compared with a set of similar edicts set down by Confucius.Principles and Practice of Confucianism in Medicine Today, By Dr. Khong Kok Sun It is often cited as evidence of abortion attitudes in ancient Greece. In Roe v. Wade, the US Supreme Court questioned the validity of this source, noting that \\"the Oath originated in a group representing only a small segment of Greek opinion and that it certainly was not accepted by all ancient physicians.\\"Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1972). Findlaw.com. Retrieved 2007-01-26 The clause referencing abortion has been questioned on a number of grounds. Authorship of this and other sections has been questioned as the language reflects Pythagorean influence; it has been suggested that he is specify that he would not give a pessary to a woman because that would abrogate the husband's prerogative in the matter,A Commentary and Translation, Prepared by Howard Herrell at and is at odds with Hippocrates' own conduct when asked by a friend to provide an abortion for her slave girl whom the kinswoman had been using as a prostitute. He describes the kind of abortion he prescribed, and records no indication of his opinion of the slave's profession.Hippocrates, \\"On the Nature of the Child\\", as cited in Intercourse, conception and pregnancy. Cos, fourth century BC (Hippocrates, On the Generating Seed and the Nature of the Child 4‚Äì7, 13, 30.4=VII.474-80, 488‚Äì92, 536‚Äì8 Littr√©. Tr. I.M. Lonie. G, available at Elsewhere, he gives instruction on how to cause an abortion through blood-letting. Legal opinions The earliest texts almost uniformly preach respect for human life; but a reading of these passages must be balanced with passages meting out harsh and often horrific punishment for social transgressions of lower caste individuals against the upper castes. In Rome, the Twelve Tablets were published only in response to \\"demands of the people\\".Edward Gibbon: The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Volume IV. Chapter XLIV : Idea Of The Roman Jurisprudence, as cited at The value of a human being varied according to rank and social circumstances. (Thus, even an upper class male might be considered a mere boy until well into his later years; with the term \\"boy\\" having a meaning similar to slave.) The kindness of strangers: the abandonment of children in Western Europe, pg. 27‚Äì28, By John Boswell A slave woman might be punished by her master if he disapproved of her abortion, regardless of who the father was, because she destroyed his property. The monetary value of human beings is reflected in the value of fines paid for personal crimes, which varied in accordance both with the rank of the offender and of the victim. In Lev. 27:6, an infant of one month or less has no monetary value. =Religious law= There are no prohibitions of abortion in the Confucian texts, nor mention of it in the earliest Vedas. While there is no direct mention of abortion in the Bible, Exodus 21:22‚Äì24 states that a man who causes a woman to miscarry may be fined. The same passage states in contrast, that murder is punishable by death. Most Jewish writers allowed abortion to save the mother's life, and hesitated to impose civil laws against abortion, feeling that most women would ignore them.Abortion and Personhood: Historical and Comparative Notes, Dr. David L. Perry The Talmud deems the fetus to be part of its mother and has no \\"juridical personality\\".Notes on David M. Feldman, \\"This Matter of Abortion,\\" ch. 9, Health and Medicine in the Jewish Tradition. L'Hayyim ‚Äì to Life\\" (New York: Crossroad, 1986) as cited at Jewish Attitudes Towards Abortion There is also no direct mention of abortion in the Qu'ran, although based on Qur'an 23:12‚Äì14, most jurists agree that abortion is acceptable up to 120 days after conception. While the earliest Vedas have no mention of abortion, later scripture condemns it as one of the vilest of crimes, resulting in loss of caste and thus loss of liberation from samsara. Despite such harsh condemnation, the penalty for abortion is the withholding of water libations from the woman; while the abortionist may lose caste and, with it, opportunity for liberation from samsara. In Buddhism, the oldest Theraveda texts condemn abortion but do not prohibit or prescribe penance. In later texts, a Buddhist monk who provides abortion is \\"defeated\\" ‚Äì excluded from the religious community ‚Äì if the fetus dies. If the mother dies but not the fetus, this is only a grave sin, because he had not intended to kill her. Generally, most texts allow abortion to save the woman's life. Ecclesiastical courts in Europe Following the decline of the Roman Empire, Ecclesiastical courts held wide jurisdiction throughout Europe. Their purpose was to instruct and correct, rather than to punish, and therefore imposed sentences of penance, rather than corporal punishment.Spivack, Carla, To Bring Down the Flowers: The Cultural Context of Abortion Law in Early Modern England, pg. 16‚Äì17. Available at SSRN: The Church treated the killing of an unformed or \\"unanimated\\" fetus as a matter of \\"anticipated homicide\\", with a corresponding lesser penance required, The Roman Catholic Church and Abortion: An Historical Perspective ‚Äì Part II, Donald DeMarco, PhD while late abortion was homicide. One of the earliest Churchmen, Tertullian, believed that the soul of the fetus is generated by the parents along with the generation of the new body. This viewpoint, later known as traducianism, was deemed unsatisfactory by St. Augustine, as it did not account for original sin. Basing himself on the Septuagint version of Exodus 21:22, he deemed abortion, while deplorable, to be less than murder. He also affirmed the Aristotelian view of delayed hominization. St. Fulgentius opposed abortion even for the purpose of saving the woman's life, saying: \\"But let the child be brought to term and baptized and saved from perdition.\\"ented a baptismal syringe, wherewith to baptize a fetus in utero in the event of a spontaneous abortion, a miscarriage. [ftn. 10: St. Fulgentius, De Fide 27, cited by E. Westermarck, The Origin and Development of the Moral Ideas (1908), vol. I, pp. 416‚Äì17 as cited by Jewish Attitudes Towards Abortion The Venerable Bede, in the Penitential ascribed to him by Albers c. 725, upheld the 40-day distinction, prescribing a one-year penance for abortion before the 40th day, and added that it makes a difference whether the woman was simply in financial desperation, or had conceived out of \\"harlotry\\". After 40 days the penance was 7 years, the same as for homicide. Abortion and Personhood: Historical and Comparative Notes, by Dr. David L. Perry In the twelfth century, in the Decretum Gratiani, > Gratian, and the medieval canon law generally, merely followed the > prevailing scientific view of the period that quickening represented the > time at which the fetus was \\"vivified,\\" defined as the time at which it was > \\"ensouled.\\"ABORTION, BISHOPS, EUCHARIST, AND POLITICIANS: A QUESTION OF > COMMUNION, GREGORY C. SISK, CHARLES J. REID, JR., The Catholic Lawyer, > Vol.43:255, 11/1/2004 A century later, St. Thomas Aquinas upheld delayed hominization: \\"seed and what is not seed is determined by sensation and movement.\\"as cited in WEBSTER v. REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES, 492 U.S. 490 (1989) In 1588, Pope Sixtus V adopted a papal bull adopting the position of St. Thomas Aquinas that contraception and abortion were crimes against nature and sins against marriage. This verdict was relaxed three years later by Pope Gregory XIV, who pronounced that abortion before \\"hominization\\" should not be subject to ecclesiastical penalties that were any stricter than civil penalties (Codicis iuris fontes, ed. P. Gasparri, vol. 1 (Rome, 1927), pp. 330‚Äì331). =Secular law= Historian Jeffrey H. Reiman writes: \\"The earliest laws of relevance to abortion were not concerns with the voluntary termination of pregnancy by the pregnant woman. They were rules providing compensation for the death of a fetus resulting from an assault on a pregnant woman. Their goal appears to have been, not to protect the rights of fetus, but to protect the rights of fathers.\\"Jeffrey H. Reiman, Abortion and the Ways We Value Human Life (Rowman & Littlefield, 1999), pp. 15-16. For example, the Code of Hammurabi and the Book of Exodus in the Hebrew Bible provide for penalties for an assault causing miscarriage.Reiman, Abortion and the Ways We Value Human Life, p. 16. The first law prohibiting voluntary abortion appear to be the Middle Assyrian laws, about 500 years after the Code of Hammurabi. These laws provided for impalement and no burial for a woman who \\"has a miscarriage by her own act.\\" Middle Assyria permitted the infanticide of children by fathers, so this harsh law \\"was not meant to protect fetuses\\" but rather \\"appears rather to have been aimed at keeping the decision about which offspring live or die in the hands of their fathers.\\"Reiman, Abortion and the Ways We Value Human Life, p. 16. The Zend Avesta imposes a sentence of Pesh√¥tanu (200 lashes) on a woman who, out of fear of discovery, \\"brings on menses\\" when conception occurs out of wedlock, with no mention of a penalty for the male.Zend Avesta, Fargard 15 This is the same sentence imposed \\"when a man gives too hard bones or too hot food to a shepherd's dog or to a house dog\\". The Code of the Assura, c. 1075 BC has penalties for several different types of abortion crimes: if a woman aborts against her husband's wishes, if a man causes an abortion in any woman at the first stage of pregnancy; if a man causes an abortion in a harlot. In the first case, the woman is to be crucified; in the second, the man is fined two talents; and in the third, the man is to make restitution for a life. Ancient History Sourcebook: The Code of the Assura, c. 1075 BCE While there were no laws against abortion in Ancient Rome, the Twelve Tables did allow for infanticide through exposure in cases of unwanted female newborns, and mandated that children born deformed also be exposed. In 211 AD, at the intersection of the reigns of Septimius Severus and Caracalla, abortions which violated the father's rights or the mother's duties were punished by temporary exile. The Visigothic Code had a system of punishments similar to that of the Zend Avesta, with 200 lashes for a woman causing her own abortion, or for a male slave performing an abortion on a freeborn woman, but with various fines in all other circumstances.The Visigothic Code: (Forum judicum) ed. S. P. Scott In 9th century England, King Alfred's laws laid down the wergeld to be paid in compensation for various murders: If a man slay a woman with child, he shall pay full wergeld for the woman, and half wergeld for the dead fetus, in compensation for the husband's material loss.Spivack, Carla, To Bring Down the Flowers: The Cultural Context of Abortion Law in Early Modern England. Available at SSRN: In the Middle Ages, German women were allowed to expose their newborns.Westrup, C.W. (1944). Introduction to Roman Law. Oxford University Press, p. 249 English common law Starting with Leges Henrici Primi, around 1115, abortion was treated as a misdemeanour prior to \\"quickening\\", accruing a penalty of 3 years' penance, or as a \\"quasi homicide\\" after quickening. It is believed that abortion cases were usually heard in ecclesiastical courts, which dealt with matters of morality,Abortion ‚Äì Abortion In English Law rather than in secular courts, which dealt with breaches of the King's peace. The punishment for the capital crime of homicide was therefore not applied. Drawing on William Staunford, Edward Coke first formulated the born alive rule in Institutes of the Lawes of England, drawing on the established definition of Murder in English law that the victim be \\"a reasonable creature in rerum natura. This formulation appeared in William Blackstone's commentaries and in Bouvier's Law Dictionary. Henry Bracton considered abortion to be homicide. Modern codification Some have claimed that scientific knowledge of human fertilization was used to justify the stricter abortion laws that were codified during the nineteenth century. This ignores other, perhaps more salient, aspects of the history of abortion law. The historical debate about vivification, animation, and delayed hominization were debates about when the fetus could be considered a \\"reasonable creature\\" ‚Äì a human being ‚Äì not simply when it had physical life; and this is what quickening was said to signify. The process of criminalizing abortion, however, can be placed in a broader context whereby professional associations began to employ licensing procedures as a means of driving \\"irregulars\\" out of practice in fields as diverse as medicine and architecture.Sociology of Professions: The Evolution of Landscape Architecture in the United States, C. Timothy Baird and Bonj Szczygiel, footnote 5, available at https://www.larch.psu.edu/files/active/0/sociology%20of%20professions.PDF Toward the end of the eighteenth century, medical associations began to co- operate \\"in vigorous measures for the suppression of empiricism, and the encouragement of regular practitioners\\"The History of New York State Book 12, Chapter 13, Part 3, Editor, Dr. James Sullivan available at ‚Äì that is, for the suppression of medicine based on practice, such as herbalism and midwifery, and the promotion of medical science based on theory ‚Äì and also began to assist in the regulation, restriction, and commercialization of reproduction products such as pessaries, condoms and abortifacients.\\"Contraception and Abortion in 19th Century America\\", book review Journal of Social History, Fall, 1995 by Steven Mintz at Science-based medicine at the time was based on humorism, a theory that had not changed since Galen's day, and relied to some extent on dangerous practices such as bloodletting, purging, and the extensive use of mercury, a toxin. Public backlash forced a temporary retreat, with licensing regulations being repealed during the next few decades. In 1857, a more successful campaign was launched. The newly formed American Medical Association > \\"were motivated to organize for the criminalization of abortion in part by > their desire to win professional power, control medical practice, and > restrict their irregular competitors, including homeopaths, midwives, and > others. Hostility towards feminists, immigrants, and Catholics fueled the > medical campaign against abortion and the passage of abortion laws by state > legislatures.\\"Women and health in America: historical readings\\" By Judith > Walzer Leavitt available at Google Books. Despite a flurry of well-publicized inquests beginning with the turn of the nineteenth century, prosecutions for abortions usually proceeded only in response to a woman's death. In addition to the abortionist, unmarried men whose lovers had died were increasingly prosecuted as well, the reasoning being that only his refusal to marry could have driven a woman to abortion.

This voltage itself is not capable of ionizing the gas in the flash tube, and the tube will not fire.Elliot Sound Products If the capacitors were charged to a voltage high enough to ionize the tube, the result would be no longer a flash, but a continuous arc as the voltage is sufficient to maintain ionization in the flash tube. Once the main storage capacitor has finished charging, a smaller capacitor is discharged into the trigger transformers primary coil. A large magnetic pulse is generated inside the transformer, which is coupled to the secondary coil through the core. The secondary coil consists of hundreds, or even thousands of windings of very fine copper wire so a high voltage pulse is generated, in the order of 2‚ÄìkV (2000‚Äì6000 V), depending on the length of the flash tube, and the gas contained within the tube. This high voltage pulse overcomes the resistance of the gas, and allows ionization. Once this ionization exists, the tube offers a much lower path of resistance, for which the main storage capacitor can now release its energy into the tube extremely quickly. By this point, the main storage capacitor is recharging and the trigger transformer ready to create another high voltage spike, and the cycle repeats. Although strobe lights are the most common use of trigger transformers, other devices such as arc lamps, gas laser tubes and even the common fluorescent light employ trigger transformers, however usually in a different form, such as using an electrical ballast to provide both the high voltage spike, as well as current limiting to prevent the tube from drawing excess current. Inductors are also commonly used in place of a trigger transformer, however are not considered transformers themselves, although similar in operation.

Background  Ocean Park Multitech Ltd. took the plot on a 33-year lease from the Government of Andhra Pradesh at the rate of per year. The lease amount was to go up by 5% every year. Constructed at a cost of , the facility was designed by Nitish Roy, a well-known Indian art director, production designer and architect. The facility, which was built in collaboration with the local tourism department, is India's first and the biggest in the world and was only the third such snow park after the ones in Malaysia and Singapore. On 28 January 2004, the then Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh Chandrababu Naidu inaugurated the facility. Though it was not intended to be open for visitors on that day, some of them ventured into the facility. They experienced giddiness from inhaling excess nitrogen in the air, which is used to produce snow. Some of them also got swollen hands, feet and faces due to the snow and air  Facilities  Visitors at the Snow World A gigantic Two-hundred tonnes of artificial snow was laid on the layered flooring which was specially prepared to avoid seepage or melting. Every day, the top layer of snow is cleaned and an additional two to three tonnes of snow, which is generated within the facility, is used to top the snow spread. The artificial snow is made using a patented technology from Australia. The snow is made from water that is filtered four times so it won't harm children if they consume it, as they are prone to in other such locations. The park can accommodate a total of 2,400 visitors in a day. Every visitor gets acclimatised to lower temperatures in a step-wise manner, , then 0 ¬∞C, and then a sub zero temperature. This method is approved internationally. In addition, visitors are given protective clothing like extra-warm sweaters and jackets and snow caps and a steaming cup of soupy broth for consumption to help them acclimatise to the rapidly but gradual temperature change. The internal area, also called as the Cryo Zone, maintains a constant temperature of ‚Äì 5 ¬∞C. For 1 hour, a maximum of 300 visitors at a time can explore the different facilities such as kids snow play area, snow wars, snow tube slide, sleigh slide, ice-bumping cars, merry-go-round and an ice skating rink. A few months after its inauguration, a snowfall feature was added. Said to be the first of its kind at any show theme park or snow dome in India, the visitors are exposed to snowfall for five minutes just before a session ends.

His mother is credited with having high expectations for him, and for correctly presuming that he would attend the prestigious Boston Latin secondary school.Ring, 60 Later, he studied political science at Harvard University, graduating in 1959 before earning his Master of Library Science degree at Simmons College in 1962.Gale Career Curley's first position in a library was at the Connolly branch of the Boston Public Library system in a so-called \\"pre-professional position\\". By the time he had completed his library degree, he had already been appointed as director of the Avon Public library. He worked from 1961 to 1964. Though this was a directorship in title, he was the only employee, and responsible for virtually every component of the library.Ring, 60 In 1964, Curley was appointed as the director of the Palatine Public Library in Illinois, where he served until 1969.minutes of the Palatine Public Library Board, June 10, 1964 Throughout his career he remained primarily in the Atlantic North East and Mid-West regions, typically taking positions as deputy director or director. Notably he \\"served as deputy director of the New York Public Library Research Libraries in 1980-1985 and deputy director of public services at Detroit Public Library from 1997 to 1980\\".ALA, 1998 His most notable career accomplishments include his election as President of the American Library Association in 1994 and his service as the director of the Boston Public Library from 1985 until 1996.Long Views Curley was known to be politically astute, and was tremendously concerned with how the function of the library as an institution was viewed by the public. Although he understood the important role of providing information, he was emphatic that libraries needed to be seen first and foremost as \\"humanistic institutions\\".Curley, 67 He saw libraries as embodying the best of America's hopes and as the physical \\"repository of their values and aspirations\\"Curley, 65 for each and every community. As such, he believed that a strong commitment to collection building based on community needs was essential at every library and he was fiercely critical of \\"libraries [that] lowered their collection building sights in the name of resource-sharing or 'access over ownership'\\". His belief in the power of libraries as valuable community institutions was enormous. During a speech he remarked, > I have always felt that I could go into any town, community, hamlet anywhere > in this country, and if you blindfolded me so I didn‚Äôt know what community I > was in, took me into the public library and suddenly took the blindfold off > and let me look around for about ten minutes I think I could tell you more > about the values of that community than I could derive from countless hours > spent poring over census tracts and other sources of statistical information > about it. Why? Because a library is a representative of intangible values > and those intangible values more than ever are important to us as a society > at this time..Curley, 65 Despite his love of the cultural aspects a library can provide, Curley was in no way technophobic. He encouraged librarians to see their work and especially their role as a key part of the information revolution. Imploring his peers in 1994 at a symposium at Rutgers School of Communication, Information, and Library Studies he said, \\"We need to be people for whom this is one more technological development, like the telephone or the electric typewriter, which we view with optimism because it will help us to do our jobs\\".Curley, 68 However, he was particularly concerned with how this new technology and new forms of media could further divide populations based on class and other social factors depending on the relative levels of access. It was his belief that technological improvements should \\"arise from public commitment rather than fortuitous private philanthropy\\".Ring, 61 Legacy In addition to being widely regarded as one of the most eloquent library advocates, Curley's energy and achievement for committee work within library organizations were enormous. When he became president of ALA in 1994 he ran on the theme \\"Libraries: An American Value\\" platform. Presently, he may be best known for the lecture series bearing his name, the Arthur Curley Memorial Lecture,Arthur Curley Memorial Lecture, American Library Association, (retrieved May 2011) which is devoted to the same theme and takes place each mid-winter meeting.ALA, 1999 He was a founding member of ALA‚Äôs Social Responsibility Round Table which exists to make the ALA more democratic and to equip librarians to help address social inequality and other human rights issues.'Arthur Curley', in Librarian Leaders in Intellectual Freedom, (retrieved May 2011) He was also chair of the Intellectual Freedom Committee from 1991 to 1994.Ring, 60 During his presidency he founded Library Advocacy Now, which has facilitated important training for library advocates. Rather than merely promoting best practices \\"for Curley, LAN represented the first step of a grassroots effort of the ALA's 'awaking to activism'\\".Ring, 62 The rhetorical force of his visions for the role libraries can have in society continues to be important for many librarians and library advocates.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building, and is now a redundant church in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. St Marys was built on the site of an earlier church at which Bishop Robert de Bingham was consecrated in 1229 before the completion of his cathedral church at Salisbury. His statue is still visible on the west gable. By the 9th century the Benedictine convent of Wilton Abbey was attached to the church. During the 14th and 15th centuries other medieval churches in Wilton closed and combined with St Mary's which was rebuilt and expanded to become, by the 16th century, the sole parish church. In 1441 parish records include the purchase of a great bell and around 1628 a carved pulpit was installed. In the early 19th century a parish rate was levied for the restoration of the church and a chandelier and pulpit sconces were bought to enable evening services. In 1845 a new Church of England parish church of St Mary and St Nicholas was built at the instigation of the Countess of Pembroke and her younger son Baron Herbert of Lea, designed by the architect Thomas Henry Wyatt and D. Brandon in the Italianate Romanesque style, with considerable Byzantine influences. The bells and many memorials from the old church were transferred to the new. As a result, the old church was partially demolished, apart from the chancel and one bay of the nave. The ruins consist of the three arches of the south arcade, fragments of the north arcade and the altered eastern arch of the west tower or west window within the churchyard. Restoration was undertaken between 1933 and 1939, by Robert Worth Bingham, who was the United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom from 1933 to 1937, who claimed descent from Robert de Bingham.

There is little certain information about his life. There is a Genoese document (dated June 9, 1291) referring to a certain Giovanni, son of Mauro, from Carignano (Johannes de Mauro de Calignano). Other fragments suggest he had two brothers, Giacomo a notary, and Anselmo a doctor. Further documents suggest he was still alive in September 1329, but dead by May, 1330.Revelli, p.450-52 From 1293 to 1329, Giovanni da Carignano was the rector of the church of San Marco al Molo (Saint Mark in the Pier), a parish in Genoa, just a few meters away from the bustling port of Genoa, arguably the most important seaport in the Mediterranean Sea at the time. Carignano is important to the history of cartography as the author of an early 14th-century nautical portolan chart, depicting, with much skill, most of the world as then known to his Italian contemporaries (Europe, North Africa, Mediterranean, Black Sea and much of the Middle East). Although the northern reaches of Europe are unclear, it contains possibly the first depiction of Scandinavia as a peninsula. Carignano's portolan has been variously dated between 1305 and 1327.Beazley (1906: p.516) pushes for an earlier date, 1300-1305, Desimoni (1875: p.44) for 1306, Nordenski√∂ld (1896: p. 689) says 1310; Campbell (1986) proposes 1327.). If the earlier dates are accepted, then it might be the first known portolan signed by its author (i.e. before Pietro Vesconte's portolan of 1311). The signature read: Presbiter Johannes Rector sancti Marci de portu Ianue me fecit.Desimoni (Giornale Liguistico, 1875: p.44) The Carignano chart was long held by the Archivio di Stato in Florence, Italy. Alas, already fragile, the chart was destroyed in 1943 during a bombing of Naples, where it was temporarily on exposition. All that remains of it are a set of photographs and notes by earlier scholars. A second mysterious Carignano map, dated 1306, is mentioned routinely in 19th-century lists, but without indication of its location or description of its content, and thus either never existed beyond rumor, or has long been lost.e.g. Carignano's 1306 map is listed without a location in the catalog of Pietro Amat di S. Filippo (1875), Studi bibliografici e biografici sulla storia della geografia in Italia. Rome: Elzeviriana. p.329) In this map he joins the teological tradition (Jerusalem in the centre of a T-in-O scheme) and the more accurate and up-to-date information In the port of Genoa (1306) he interviewed the ambassadors of abissinan negus Wedem Arad; some scholars, as Silverberg, presume he was the first European to collocate the legendary Prester John's Kingdom in Africa (Ethiopia) rather than in northern Asia.

It is spelt Rikaze Dzong (official spelling: Xigaz√™ Dzong; other spellings: Shigatse Dzong, Shikatse Dzong, Zhigatsey Dzong, , ). Shigatse Dzong was originally built by Karma Phuntsok Namgyal (1611‚Äì1621), the second in the line of the Nyak family who ruled Tibet from 1565‚Äì1642, after which the capital was moved to Lhasa.Dorje (2009), p. 319. Shigtse Dzong‚Äôs historic importance was accentuated by the fact that the Mongol ruler Gusri Khan installed the Fifth Dalai Lama as the supreme ruler of Tibet, which then covered territory from Tachienlu in the east up to the Ladakh border in the west in the 17th century. In later years, the fort became the residence of the governor of Tsang. The modern city of Shigatse has developed around the base of the Dzong. The Dzong was destroyed in 1961, after the 1959 Tibetan uprising, but was rebuilt in 2007 at the same location, though on a smaller scale. The large Tashilhunpo Monastery, founded in 1447 by Gendun Drup, the First Dalai Lama, is close to the base of the fort in Shigatse.Ch√∂ Yang: The Voice of Tibetan Religion and Culture. (1991) Year of Tibet Edition, p.79. Gangchen Kyishong, Dharmasala, H.P., India. Geography The Shigatse Dzong and the city called Shigatse are located at an altitude of about , slightly higher than Lhasa. The oxygen content of the air is only 67 percent of that at sea level, while the average annual temperatures are in mid-summer and in mid- winter.Dorje 92009), p. 317. The Shigatse Dzong is situated at the confluence of the Yarlung Tsangpo (aka Brahmaputra River and Niang chu (Nyang Chu) rivers in West Tibet. Shigatse was the ancient capital of √ú-Tsang province. The location of the Dzong on the hilltop dominates the scenic views of the town and the Tashilhunpo Monastery. Shigatse is also the name of the surrounding county,Richardson (1984), p. 7. whose population is approximately 94,000. The city of Shigatse is the second-largest city in Tibet, with a population of about 12,000. It is the hub of the road network between Lhasa, Nepal, and western Tibet. The road follows both the north and south banks of the Tsongpo via the northern route of Yangpachen. It is expected that the Qinghai-Tibet railway will be extended to Shigatse by 2010.China National Highway 318 also passes through Shigatse. History The imposing Shigatse Dzong was built in the 17th century as a smaller prototype of the Potala in Lhasa, and had turret-like fortifications at the ends and a central Red Palace.Tibet: a travel survival kit, p. 168. (1986). Michael Buckley and Robert Strauss. Lonely Planet Publications, South Yarra, Vic., Australia. .Tibet: A Fascinating Look at the Roof of the World, Its People and Culture, p. 115. (1982). Elisabeth B. Booz. Passport Books. In the 17th century, the Mongols (by Gusri Khan in 1642) supported the Fifth Dalai Lama and defeated Prince Tsang at Shigatse. After this event, the Tashilhunpo Monastery came under the control of the Yellow Hat sect. The rivalry between the Sakya and the Gelukpa orders is traced to this event; the Geukpa sect of the Dala Lama controlled from Central Tibet and the Panchen Lama controlled from Shigatse.Dowman, p.265, 272 Shigatse was previously the seat of the kings of √ú-Tsang and the capital of the province of √ú-Tsang or Tsang.Mayhew, Bradley and Kohn, Michael. (2005). Tibet, p. 172. 6th Edition. Lonely Planet Publications. . It was sacked when the Gurkhas invaded Tibet and captured Shigatse in 1791 before a combined Tibetan and Chinese army drove the Gurkhas back as far as the outskirts of Kathmandu.Chapman, Spencer F. (1940). Lhasa: The Holy City, p. 128. Readers Union Ltd., London. The Gurkhas were forced to agree to keep the peace in future, pay tribute every five years, and return what they had looted from Tashilhunpo.Richardson (1984), p. 69. Shigatse was also the traditional seat of the Panchen Lamas. Until the Chinese arrived in the 1950s, the \\"Tashi\\" or Panchen Lama wielded temporal power over three small districts, though not over the town of Shigatse itself, which was administered by a dzongp√∂n (general) appointed from Lhasa.Chapman, Spencer F. (1940). Lhasa: The Holy City, p. 141. Readers Union Ltd., London. Destruction and rebuilding of the Dzong During the Chinese Cultural Revolution in Tibet in 1961, the Dzong was demolished \\"stone by stone\\". This destruction was instigated by the Chinese and resulted in the complete razing of the Dzong, which held an imposing view above the Shigatse town; only a few ramparts were left. Between 2005 and 2007, the building was reconstructed, financed by donations from Shanghai. The basis of the reconstruction were old photos, yet reconstruction was executed in cement/concrete. Since then, the outside has been wainscotted with natural stones. The Dzong has become a museum on Tibetan culture. Nearby attractions Within the precincts of the Dzong and the city of Shigatse are many monuments of religious importance, such as the Tashilhunpo Monastery and the Shalu Monastery. Another important structure is the Narthang Monastery, a 12th-century monastery of the Kadampa order which housed the first printing establishment in Central Tibet. =Tashilhunpo Monastery= Tashilhunpo Monastery Tashilhunpo Monastery (), founded in 1447 by Gendun Drup, the First Dalai Lama, is a historic and culturally important monastery next to Shigatse, the second-largest city in Tibet. The monastery is the traditional seat of successive Panchen Lamas, the second-highest-ranking tulku lineage in the Gelukpa tradition. The monastery is one of the six great Gelukpa-order monasteries founded in 1447 by Gendup Drup. On the eastern side of the monastery stands the old living quarters of the Panchen Lama -- the Panchen Lama's Palace, known as Gudong. Within, a narrow courtyard gives access to the temple containing the Fourth Panchen Lama's tomb.Mayhew, p.198Chapman (1940), p. 141. In the 1960s many senior lamas and monastics left Tibet and established new monasteries in India, Nepal and Bhutan. However, the Panchen Lama stayed in Tibet, and many of the senior lamas from the Tashilhunpo Monastery therefore stayed as well. In 1972 a new campus of Tashilhunpo Monastery was built by Tibetan exiles at a settlement in Bylakuppe, KarnƒÅtakƒÅ, in southern India. Since the early 1980s, parts of the Tashilhunpo Monastery have been open to the public and it is an important tourist attraction in Tibet. =Shalu Monastery= A 14th- century depiction of the 11th Abbot of Shalu, Buton Rinchen Drub (left), and his successor, on a wall painting inside the Shalu Monastery. The Shalu monastery, established in the 11th century, became famous in the 14th century as a centre of learning under But√∂n Rinpoche, its abbot. He was an authoritative translator of his times in Tibet and interpreter of Sanskrit Buddhist texts. The title of 'But√∂n' was prefixed to his name, Rinchen Drup. The monastery was famous for psychic learning of trans-walking and thumo (generating internal heat to survive in cold weather). Located 40 km south of Shigatse, it was also famous for Pala art paintings of the Newari-Tibetan-Mongol school. This art, which developed in the 13th century, is traced to Arniko of the court of Kublai Khan in Beijing. This style influenced art in Northern and Eastern Asia for several centuries. Some of the paintings are still well preserved. Repair and reconstruction of the monastery began in May 2009 to preserve the heritage monument and its famed paintings.Mayhew, p.198 =Kora= The Thanka Wall along the Kora route where Koku is displayed. Kora, a pilgrimage and a type of meditation in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, is performed in Shigatse along a set route covering the Tashilhunpo Monastery, the Mani walls, sacred rocks, a small temple, the Shigatse Dzong, and back to the monastery through the town. It is a walking circumambulation starting with the Tashilhunpo's entrance and moving round along a set route in a clockwise direction. The Kora first covers the boundary wall of the Tashilhunpo Monastery (90 m), then proceeds north to the prayer wheels, climbs up the hills to another row of prayer wheels, passes a large chorten, visits the small Gyelwa Jampa Temple (maroon-coloured) on the right, passes through a series of rocks which are worshipped by pilgrims by rubbing against the rocks and offering incense, tsampa or chang to a sacred fireplace, and then climbs up and passes through a stone edifice in the form of a cinema screen where a large Koku (Thangka religious painting) is displayed on particular occasions (in late July corresponding to the fifth Tibetan month during an annual festival held at Tashilhunpho Monastery). Further up, the route forks towards the Dzong to continue the Kora and is completed past a Mani temple, returning to the entrance of the Tashilhunpho Monastery after passing through the town.McCue, p. 152 Notes References  Chapman, Spencer F.

The ALK immunostain allows individuals with ALK rearrangements to be identified. ALK inhibitors are anti-cancer drugs that act on tumours with variations of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) such as an EML4-ALK translocation. They fall under the category of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which work by inhibiting proteins involved in the abnormal growth of tumour cells. All the current approved ALK inhibitors function by binding to the ATP pocket of the abnormal ALK protein, blocking its access to energy and deactivating it. A majority of ALK-rearranged NSCLC harbour the EML4-ALK fusion, although as of 2020, over 92 fusion partners have been discovered in ALK+ NSCLC. For each fusion partner, there can be several fusion variants depending on the position the two genes were fused at, and this may have implications on the response of the tumour and prognosis of the patient. Approved inhibitors =First generation= Crizotinib (also a ROS1 and c-MET inhibitor) was approved in Aug 2011 by the US FDA for ALK-positive NSCLC. At the time of the discovery of ALK translocations as a molecular driver in NSCLC, crizotinib was being investigated by Pfizer as a potential c-MET inhibitor. Its activity against ALK being known, Pfizer shifted its investigations to focus on this indication, and obtained a full approval 4 years later. Crizotinib's efficacy was proven in phase III trial, PROFILE 1007, when it was compared to then- standard second-line pemetrexed or docetaxel chemotherapy. It induced tumour stabilisation or shrinkage in 90% of patients. Its lack of penetrance in the brain and non-optimal specificity for ALK meant resistance mostly arose within a year, with the brain being a common site of progression. =Second generation= Despite the excitement of crizotinib's therapeutic success, there was a need to conceive new drugs with better brain penetrance, higher specificity and targeting a broader set of resistance mutations. As such, Novartis' ceritinib was approved by the FDA in April 2014 for treatment of NSCLC. It provided good brain penetrance and a significant progression-free survival benefit against chemotherapy in the first line as demonstrated in the ASCEND-4 trial. Roche's alectinib was FDA approved Dec 2015 (accelerated) for patients who had progressed on crizotinib, with full approval in 2017 as a first-line treatment for ALK-positive NSCLC. Like ceritinib, it provided excellent brain penetrance and high response rates. It demonstrated a clear benefit against both first-line chemotherapy and first-line crizotinib. FDA approves Alecensa for ALK-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer Nov 2017 This was based on the phase 3 ALEX trial comparing it with crizotinib. Ariad's and Takeda's brigatinib (also an inhibitor of mutated EGFR) was the latest second-generation inhibitor and was approved in April 2017 by the US FDA for ALK-positive NSCLC.https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/DrugInnovation/ucm537040.htm It is very similar to alectinib in efficacy, while being active against some resistant mutations such as the common G1202R mutation that provides resistance to alectinib. =Third generation= Pfizer's lorlatinib was the first third-generation inhibitor and was approved in 2018 by the US FDA for ALK-positive NSCLC after progression on a first or second-generation inhibitor. Its macrocyclic structure was designed specifically to address some of the most recalcitrant resistance mutations. Still, most tumours eventually develop resistance through various mechanisms, namely compound-mutations (two or three mutations simultaneously) or activation of alternative pathways, such as the c-MET pathway. Clinical trials Additional ALK inhibitors currently (or soon to be) undergoing clinical trials include: * Ensartinib (Xcovery's X-396, undergoing the eXalt3 Phase III multicenter clinical trial against crizotinib in ALK-TKI na√Øve patients who received up to one prior chemotherapy) * Entrectinib (Nerviano's NMS-E628, licensed by Ignyta and renamed RXDX-101, in the U.S. orphan drug designation and rare pediatric disease designation for the treatment of neuroblastoma and orphan drug designation for treatment of TrkA-, TrkB-, TrkC-, ROS1- and ALK-positive NSCLC) * Repotrectinib (TPX-0005, Turning Point Therapeutics) * Belizatinib (TSR-011, Tesaro) * Alkotinib (ZG-0418, a dual ALK/ROS1 inhibitor, Suzhou Zelgen Biopharmaceuticals) * Foritinib (SAF-189, a dual ALK/ROS1 inhibitor undergoing a phase I/II trial as of 2020, Fochon Pharmaceuticals) * CEP-37440 (Teva) * TQ-B3139 (dual ALK/c-MET inhibitor by Chia Tai Tianqing Pharmaceuticals, undergoing a phase III clinical trial against crizotinib in TKI-na√Øve patients) * PLB1003 (Beijing Pearl Biotechnology) * TPX-0131 (Turning Point Therapeutic's next generation ALK inhibitor, shown to work even against compound mutations resistant to lorlatinib) Discontinued * ASP-3026 (Astellas) Investigational combinations While the response to ALK inhibitors is often very encouraging in patients with ALK+ NSCLC and lasts for a relatively long time, most of them eventually develop resistance, either through mutations in the ATP binding pocket or activation of alternative oncogenic pathways. Much research is being carried out on understanding the ways the cancer adapts and on how to reverse or delay resistance. =MEK pathway= The MEK pathway (short for MAPK/ERK-Kinase) has been extensively shown to be critical for the survival of tumour cells subjected to ALK inhibition. Inhibition of this pathway was shown to enhance response and delay the onset of resistance in preclinical models. As of 2020, three clinical trials are running to test the following combinations of ALK inhibitors with MEK inhibitors: brigatinib+binimetinib, ceritinib+trametinib, and alectinib+cobimetinib. Results for the last two are expected around 2020-2021. =EGFR/HER2 pathway= The EGFR and HER2 pathways are commonly abnormally activated in a large proportion of cancers. This was shown to be the case in preclinical models of ALK+ NSCLC subjected to ALK inhibition, both in vitro and in vivo. Surprisingly, cells were only sensitive to EGFR/HER2 inhibition when in the process of adapting to ALK inhibitors: both na√Øve cells and fully-adapted cells showed no measurable response to EGFR/HER2 inhibition alone. Currently, solid preclinical studies have been carried out with second- generation inhibitors combined with afatinib, erlotinib and lapatinib. In all cases, the responses were enhanced by the combination with respect to monotherapy, but seemed more pronounced in afatinib and lapatinib (dual EGFR/HER2 inhibitors) than in erlotinib (which only inhibits EGFR). =Anti- VEGF therapies= Several trials are investigating the combination of anti- VEGF antibody bevacizumab with ALK inhibitors such as alectinib and brigatinib. Bevacizumab is an antiangiogenic antibody, which normalizes the complex blood vessel structures around cancer and prevents new blood vessels from forming, thus starving the tumour and preventing its proliferation. = Local consolidation therapy = The use of either radiotherapy or surgery in addition to an ALK inhibitor is known as local consolidation therapy, and as of 2020, it is being investigated by three clinical trials. Their goal is to determine whether it delays resistance to the drugs compared with monotherapy. Some make use of SBRT (stereotactic body radiation therapy), a very precise radiation technique able to provide high doses with minimal side effects. Most trials of LCT in NSCLC focus on oligometastatic disease (under 3-5 lesions, depending on the definitions), but preliminary results of the BRIGHTSTAR trial indicate this method may be safe and well tolerated irrespective of the number of lesions. NPM-ALK NPM-ALK is a different variation/fusion of ALK that drives anaplastic large-cell lymphomas (ALCLs) and is the target of other ALK inhibitors.

Finding the island too unimportant to risk war with Italy, Greece evacuated it and it was in turn occupied by Italy on 30 October 1914. Italy posted a military commander on the island. This was later ratified on 26 April 1915 by the secret Treaty of London. After World War I, Albania formally ceded the island to Italy on 2 September 1920 as part of the Albano-Italian protocol. The island remained part of Italy from 1920 until 1947, when it was returned to Albania.Scott Catalogue, 2017 ‚Äì Volume 6, p. 45. Italian postage During most of this period, postage stamps of Italy were in use. However, in 1923, eight contemporary stamps of Italy were overprinted \\"SASENO\\" by the Sazan Island post office for local use. These are all definitive types which show a portrait of King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy and are denominated in the Italian currency of 100 centesimi (c.) to one lira with values of 10c., 15c., 20c., 25c., 30c., 50c., 60c. and 1 lira. The values have individual colouring, mainly using shades of orange, brown and blue.Stanley Gibbons, Europe and Colonies 1970, p. 587. The eight stamps are not particularly rare, although uses of the stamps on covers are uncommon. References and sources ;References ;Sources *Rossiter, Stuart & John Flower. The Stamp Atlas.

The team participates in UCI Europe Tour races and UCI World Tour events when given a wildcard invitation. The team's administrative offices and management are based in Pamplona, Navarra, Spain, but its service course (workshop and warehouse facility) is in Alsasua, Navarra. It was announced in February 2013 that the team had acquired a co-sponsor in a subsidiary of Caja Rural and would become known as Caja Rural‚ÄìSeguros RGA from 21 February 2013. History Caja Rural re-entered professional cycling in the 2010 season. In late 2009, Caja Rural decided to move back to the professional peloton, forming a UCI Continental Team (competing in the Europe UCI Continental Circuits) that among other things would give continuity to their under 23 and elite amateur teams. In 2010, its first year returning as a professional team, the team's total budget was ‚Ç¨837,932. The original squad was made up of 16 riders, of whom 5 had come up from the amateur team. During the season, 4 members of the amateur team turned professional, 3 of them joining Caja Rural and one moving to Movistar. On October 19, 2010, Juanikorena I√±aki signed a contract with Preventia Sports Club (Club Deportivo Preventia), who manage the Caja Rural professional team, to continue as the team's Directeur Sportif in 2011. However, on 14 December 2010, he announced his departure due to major professional differences over approaches to training (\\"importantes diferencias en los criterios t√©cnicos-deportivos\\"). I√±aki was replaced by Mikel Azparren. At the end of January 2011, I√±aki brought a lawsuit against the team in the Civil Court (Juzgado de los Social) of Pamplona, Navarra, Spain. I√±aki proved breach of contract in his suit. The team's appeal to the Superior Court (Tribunal Superior de Justicia de Navarra) was dismissed on July 25, 2012, and the UCI made full payment of his salary for 2011, drawing from the team's bank guaranty held by the UCI. In 2011, Caja Rural advanced to the UCI Professional Continental category with a view to competing in top level racing, especially the 2011 Vuelta a Espa√±a, the first Vuelta in 33 years to visit the Basque Country. On its d√©but as a UCI Professional Continental team, Caja Rural adopted the motto: \\"un equipo para creer, un equipo para crecer\\" (\\"a team to believe in, a team for growth\\"). The team emphasizes that \\"growth\\" in the latter part of this motto is meant to connote not only the growth of the squad, but also the growth of athletes as individuals, in particular amateur athletes making the leap to the professional ranks. In August 2011, Caja Rural rider Fabricio Ferrari won the overall Mountains Classification in the Volta a Portugal and the Young Rider Classification went to Garikoitz \\"Gari\\" Bravo. The team did not compete in the 2011 Vuelta a Espa√±a, but was named the Best Navarro Sports Team in 2011 by the Government of Navarra. Caja Rural was invited to participate in the 2012 Vuelta a Espa√±a, which departed from Pamplona where the team is based. The 2012 Vuelta saw Caja Rural rider Antonio Piedra, take Stage 15, a high mountain affair finishing atop the Lakes of Covadonga climb. Piedra dropped his breakaway companions on the first \\"Hors Category\\" climb of the Vuelta, and finished with 2 minutes and 2 seconds advantage over his nearest competitor. The team's enthusiasm for competition in their Vuelta d√©but was highlighted by a heartbreaking episode in the 4th stage. Marcos Garc√≠a valiantly fought to the head of the peloton, sprinted to the finish line and threw kisses to the crowd as he crossed it triumphantly. However, owing to miscommunication with the team car, he was unaware that three escapees had crossed the line before him. David Arroyo of the Movistar Team who placed second in the 2010 Giro d'Italia and Amets Txurruka who rode for and took first in the Young Riders Classification at the 2007 Tour de France joined Caja Rural in the 2013 season. These two experienced riders have participated in 25 Grand Tours. After a change of management in the 2012 season and in an effort to retain its UCI World Tour license, began including more riders from outside the Basque Country who hold high UCI World Tour rankings. Caja Rural has been a beneficiary of this policy picking up Txurruka and Iv√°n Velasco from , but the team also lost the promising young cyclist Garikoitz Bravo to at the same time. On 21 February 2013, the team's name changed to \\"Caja Rural-Seguros RGA\\". Two days later Antonio Piedra took the first podium for the newly renamed team by winning the Mountains Classification in the Vuelta a Murcia, part of the UCI Europe Tour. The first General Classification victory for the newly badged team was won by Francesco Lasca on 31 March 2013 in the Vuelta a La Rioja. Caja Rural‚ÄìSeguros RGA rider Javier Aramendia won the Overall Combativity Award at the 2013 Vuelta a Espa√±a after he and his teammates Antonio Piedra, David Arroyo and Fabricio Ferrari took 7 of the 20 stage Combativity Awards given during the race. Sponsorship The professional team's principal sponsor is Grupo Caja Rural, a savings bank and agricultural credit cooperative in Spain with 3,600 branches. On 21 February 2013, Caja Rural added a new co-sponsor Seguros RGA. Seguros RGA (meaning \\"Insurance RGA\\") was founded on 17 March 1986 as the insurance subsidiary of Grupo Caja Rural. The \\"Seguros RGA\\" name and logo were added to new team jerseys and all other media. Seguros RGA had supported the team in its bid to compete in the 2012 Vuelta a Espa√±a and was featured on Vuelta team jerseys. Seguros RGA was so impressed with the profile and performance of the team that they decided to step forward as a team co- sponsor. Team Car at the 2010 Volta a Portugal ≈†koda Auto provides sponsorship and team cars. Euskorot, a Basque Country graphics company, supplies the team car livery. Team bikes for the 2015 and 2016 seasons are supplied by Fuji Bikes models Transonic, Altamira and Norcom Straight. From the 2012 to the 2014 season, the team had ridden Bulgarian brand bicycles ViVELO. From the 2015 season, team kit is supplied by Italian clothing brand AL√â, replacing Inverse‚ÄìCIRO SPORT from the previous several seasons. Spiuk supplies the team's helmets and glasses. From the 2016 season, the powermeters and computers are supplied by Pioneer replacing Rotor Bed4u Hotels added its sponsorship in January 2013 offering the team lodging. Bed4u replaced Playitas, a Canary Islands sports resort where the team trained in the winter of 2012, on team jerseys. Centro M√©dico Vitasport (Vitasport Medical Centre), an advanced technology athletic training centre for professional and amateur athletes is a sponsor and also the registered office of Club Deportivo Preventia, the organization that runs the team.

It premiered on ABC Family on November 28, 2010 during the Countdown to 25 Days of Christmas programming block and was written by Michael Ciminera and Richard Gnolfo. Plot The Bannister family and their dog Zeus go to a ski lodge in Colorado for their Christmas vacation. When they get to their condo, they find Belinda Bannister's brother and his son staying in the same condo. Along with the boys is a poodle named Bella, and Zeus immediately has a crush on her. Despite the surprised guests there, George tries to have the best Christmas ever. Meanwhile, Ted and Stewey are after London James's necklace. They steal it, but they accidentally leave it at the gift shop, where George (thinking it's a $5 dog collar) lets Zeus buy it for Bella. Ted and Stewey kidnap Bella, so Zeus goes after her, following the two crooks to their hotel room. Ted and Stewey go to get Chinese food as Zeus enters to save Bella.

The film received worldwide acclaim, and represented Aladag's debut as a producer, writer and director. When We Leave tells the story of a young German/Turkish mother's struggle for self-determination between two systems of values. It is a multi-layered story about honor, intolerance and the unshakeable belief in a harmonious coexistence. The film stars Sibel Kekilli, Florian Lukas, Alwara H√∂fels, Nursel K√∂se and Turkish actors Settar Tanrƒ±√∂ƒüen and Derya Alabora. It was produced by Independent Artists, a company founded by Aladag in 2005. When We Leave had its world premiere on 13 February 2010 at the 60th Berlin International Film Festival. It screened in the special Panorama section and was awarded the Europa Cinemas Label Prize. It began its German release on 11 March 2010. Reviewers called When We Leave ‚Äúthe strongest debut film in years‚Äù and gave special notice to the sensitive direction of the actors as well as the courage the film showed in addressing such heated subject matter. The film was awarded numerous national and international prizes, including seven nominations for the 2010 German Film Awards, in the categories Best Film, Best Debut Film, Best Screenplay, Best Actress, Best Cinematography, Best Editing and Best Score. The film won two German Film Awards for Best Film in Bronze and Best Actress. It also won the LUX Film Prize for the Best European Film 2010, the New Faces Award (Best First Feature), the DEFA Board's Emerging Artists Prize (Best First Feature 2010), the Grand Prize for Best Film at the 2010 Tribeca Film Festival as well as many others from film festivals including Ghent, S√£o Paulo, and Calgary. When We Leave played at more than 100 film festivals worldwide, in 73 countries and on 6 continents. On 17 September 2010 the German selection committee chose When We Leave as its official entry in the competition for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Plot Umay (Sibel Kekilli) lives with her husband Kemal (Ufuk Bayraktar) and son Cem (Nizam Schiller) in the suburbs of Istanbul. Kemal has regular violent outbursts against both his wife and son. Umay's longing for her home and parents in Berlin finally overwhelms her. She packs up her things and flees her life and marriage in Istanbul. She returns to her family home in Berlin, where she hopes to start a new, independent life with her son. She hopes her family will be supportive of her new beginning, but when Umay's father Kader (Setter Tanr√∂igen) learns what Umay has done, he orders her to return immediately. According to tradition she belongs forever to her husband Kemal. Umay refuses to go and burns her passport. ‚ÄúStop dreaming!‚Äù her mother tells her, as her siblings suffer rejection in their community based on their sister's actions. Mehmet, Umay's older brother (Tamer Yigit), and Kader devise a plan to kidnap young Cem and take him back to his father in Istanbul. Umay overhears them and flees to start a new life with her son, without her family. She moves to a women's shelter, where she builds a new life for herself. Through her work at a kitchen she meets Stipe (Florian Lukas), a colleague she feels drawn to. Soon she even has her own apartment and a satisfying new life. Only one thing is missing; her family. Again and again she tries to contact her mother and younger brother Acar. Every time she fails. During all of this, her father and brothers come to a difficult decision. Acar (Serhad Can) has earned a terrible fate; he's been elected to kill his beloved sister to restore his family's lost honor.

Nizam Schiller (Cem), Almila Bagriacik (Rana) and Serhad Can (Acar) all made their screen debut in the film. Her own acting experience helped Aladag to individualize her approach to each actor in the film. All non-actors participated in an acting workshop which lasted several months, during which Aladag helped them learn from her experience in front of the camera. Background When We Leave was produced by Independent Artists in co-production with WDR, RBB and ARTE. It was supported by the Medienboard Berlin-Brandenburg, the BKM, the NRW Film Board and the Kuratorium junger deutscher Film. The film had its debut at the Berlin Film Festival. Afterwards it was released on 11 March 2010 throughout Germany by its German Distributor Majestic. The director supported the theatrical release with a Germany-wide Q&A; tour. On 27 August 2010 Majestic Home Entertainment released the film on Blu-ray and DVD. Development While directing PSAs for Amnesty International's ‚ÄúViolence Against Women‚Äù campaign, Aladag began researching themes related to domestic violence. Her research led her to a series of honor killings in Germany, mainly perpetrated against women who tried to free themselves from familial and social pressures. She quickly became engrossed in her quest to understand the complex family dynamics that contribute to honor killings. Out of this passion came the desire to create a cinematic story that dealt with the fate of a young German woman of Turkish origins. Aladag researched for over two years and consulted with various experts on the issues involved. She researched police case files from the previous fifteen years and discovered similar patterns in them that helped her begin writing the screenplay. Aladag wanted to distill the conflicts she found in those documents in her screenplay. She wanted to create an emotional, authentic but also universal story, without moral judgments and with the goal of showing not only the conflict, but also to empathetically portray the tragedy of the situation. Production and post-production Production began on 15 July 2008 for what was to be a 39-day shoot. When We Leave was shot on 35mm in Cinemascope. Aladag worked closely with editor Andrea Mertens for four months at Cineimpuls, a post-production house in Berlin. Filming locations  When We Leave was shot in Berlin and Turkey. For Aladag it was especially important to tell the story as authentically as possible, and she did extensive location scouting. Among the Berlin locations were the well-known clubs \\"SO36,\\" and the \\"Monarch\\" bar in Kreuzberg. Interiors of the Aslan family home were shot on Wilhelmstrasse in Berlin-Mitte, and the wedding scene was shot in the Neuk√∂lln district of Berlin. One particularly unique location was the former residence of the Ethiopian Ambassador in Pankow, which was used for the scenes in the women's shelter. Teufelsberg in West Berlin was the setting for Umay and Stipe's date. To maintain maximum authenticity, many important scenes were shot in Turkey, in the Kayseri Province as well as in Istanbul. Interiors for Kemal, the Turkish husband's family, were shot in the Istanbul suburb Dudullu, and the exteriors of Kader's journey to visit his father were shot in his home village of Kayseri. Critical reception Joseph Smiegelski wrote in the Huffington Post that he \\"consider[ed] When We Leave one of the best movies I have ever seen.

They are primarily most concentrated in the northern communes of Martinique, where the main plantations are located. The Indo-Martiniquais speak Antillean a French-based creole. Migration history In 1851 the Martinique authorities, seeking to replace former slave labourers who had abandoned plantation work on being given their liberty, recruited several thousand labourers from the Indian French colonial settlements of Madras, Pondich√©ry, Chandernagor and Karaikal. Workers were offered free passage and pay in exchange for serving a five-year period of labour.: World Directory of Minorities and Indigenous Peoples - Martinique : Overview Despite initial experiences of racial discrimination and labour exploitation, many of the immigrants were subsequently well-integrated into the population, and by the late 20th century the labourers' descendants were broadly assimilated into Martiniquais culture. The past two decades have seen Indo-Martiniquais people increasingly asserting the distinctively Indian aspects of their heritage (a phenomenon known as \\"indianit√©\\"). People of Indian descent have paid renewed attention to the history and culture of India, and local groups have established contact with peoples of Indian descent from throughout the Caribbean and further afield. One token of this has been the recent revival of a traditional Hindu annual mela on the island, sustained by the Hindu temples and shrines that were introduced by the migrant labourers and remain operational today.: Countries and their Cultures: MARTINIQUE Culture The majority of Indo-Martiniquais follow Christianity with the minority following Islam and Hinduism. The Hinduism in Martinique constitutes of a variation of popular Tamil Hinduism, which was characterized by the practice of animal sacrifice, the veneration of village deities and the use of the Tamil language as the ceremonial language, although the language has lost its usage in the plantation and post-plantation society. One of Martinique's most famous dishes, the Colombo, derives from Indian cuisine. The word Colombo derives from the Tamil word ‡Æï‡ØÅ‡Æ¥‡ÆÆ‡Øç‡Æ™‡ØÅ- kulambu meaning curry sauce. The dish is a unique curry of chicken, meat or fish with vegetables, spiced with a distinctive masala of Tamil origin, acidulated with tamarind and often containing wine, coconut milk, and rum.

A Wolf‚ÄìRayet star and a supergiant companion of spectral type O orbit in a period of 19.56 days. The system is surrounded by a ring-shaped nebula known as a bubble nebula. Discovery AB7 was first listed by Azzopardi and Vigneau as a probable member of the Small Magellanic Cloud and noted to be a Wolf Rayet star. It was numbered 336a, the \\"a\\" meaning it is an addition between 336 and 337 of the existing catalogue. The catalogue stars are referred to with the acronym Az or AzV, so AB7 is also called AzV 336a. A close companion is noted although at the distance of the SMC it is not really that close and not physically related. The definitive catalogue of Wolf Rayet stars in the SMC was published shortly after by Azzopardi and Breysacher, with AB7 the seventh out of a grand total of eight stars. These are referred to as SMC WR stars, or SMC AB, or more commonly just AB. Nebula alt= Small Magellanic Cloud false colour image AB7 lies at the centre of a bubble nebula shaped and ionised by powerful stellar winds from the stars within it. The nebula was first catalogued as the N76 and N76A HŒ± emission line nebulae. N76A is the brighter portion of the larger round N76 nebula towards bottom left in the images and N76B is the detached knot at bottom right. N76 lies between two other prominent HII regions: the larger brighter N66, which contains the unusual HD 5980 LBV/WR/O triple system; and the fainter N78. The nebula was catalogued at radio wavelengths as SMC DEM 123 and 124, corresponding to N76A and N76 respectively. DEM 124 is described as a shell surrounding DEM 123. N76 is an HII region about 5 arc-minutes wide, 40‚Äì50 parsecs. It has the appearance of a ring but is actually an approximately spherical shell, interstellar material sculpted and ionised by the winds of the central stars, similar to a planetary nebula but much larger. It also contains both singly and doubly ionised helium. Such HeII regions are rare and indicate an extremely hot ionising star. They are found only around a few of the hottest types of Wolf Rayet star. N76 is described as containing the open cluster NGC 371, although the reverse may be more accurate. The stars of NGC 371 are scattered over twice the diameter of N76, around 100 parsecs, and might better be described as a stellar association than an open cluster. They can be seen as the higher density of stars in the lower half of the images. Hodge catalogued stellar associations in the SMC and Hodge 53 was defined to include NGC 371. AB7 is sometimes described as being within N76A, but this is incorrect. N76A is the small dense HII region SE of AB7, part of the \\"ring\\", while AB7 lies at the centre of the less dense nebulosity within the ring. It may already be the home of a new generation of stars; N76A hosts at least five hot young stars, including a probable O9 main sequence star at its centre. A nearby unusual oxygen-rich supernova remnant has been intensively studied. It is visible as the knot of filaments growing green from ionised oxygen emission. The stars =Spectrum= The bubble around AB7 in the infrared (Spitzer Space Telescope) AB7 is clearly a Wolf Rayet star, showing characteristic broad emission lines. Narrow nebular emission lines are also seen, often overlaid on the emission from the star. There are no strong absorption lines, but the continuum background of the spectrum is much stronger than a single WR star and several of the emission lines are anomalously weak, so an OB companion was always assumed. The electromagnetic radiation of the primary is concentrated in the far ultraviolet, so the visual and ultraviolet spectra are dominated by the secondary star. Classification of both stars is complicated by line blending. When first discovered, it was classified as \\"WR:\\", while the SMC WR catalogue considered it a peculiar WN3+OB. An early detailed analysis gave spectral types of WN1 (a type used by some authors for a few years, equivalent to the modern WN2) and O6IIIf for the two stars. High resolution spectra allowing separation of the lines from each component during their orbit gave WN2 + O6I(f) with considerable uncertainty. Faint NIII lines are seen which would not normally be found in such an early WN star, but these were assigned to the companion. Another analysis of similar spectra gives WN4 for the Wolf Rayet component based on the relative strength of HeII and HeI emission and the presence of HŒµ emission. The luminosity- sensitive lines of the O star are largely obscured by emission from the primary, but it is assumed to be an evolved star because of the nitrogen emission, and a supergiant on the basis of the absolute magnitude. AB7 is a strong X-ray source clearly detected by ROSAT and Chandra. This is expected for a close WR/O binary, due to colliding winds being shocked to extreme temperatures. The x-ray luminosity varies during the orbit. Although the stellar winds of WR stars at low SMC metallicities are expected to be, and are observed to be, weaker than in galactic and LMC WR stars, the X-ray luminosity is comparable to similar galactic binaries. Auger ionization causes the CIV ground state to be depopulated, further complicating the spectrum. =Orbit= The spectrum of AB7 shows radial velocity variation of the WR emission lines and narrower absorption lines with a well-defined period of 19.56 days. The shifts in the two sets of lines are not quite synchronised: the emission line velocities peak about one day later than the absorption lines. Theories include that this might be related to the colliding winds or possibly due to an asymmetric disc around the stars. The relative size of the spectral line Doppler shifts indicates the mass ratio of the two stars, which shows that the secondary has around twice the mass of the primary. The shape of the radial velocity curves can be used to derive the eccentricity of the orbits which are nearly circular. Eclipses of the stars are not seen, but a very small light variation could be due to wind eclipses which would constrain the inclination to near 60¬∞. Calibrating the secondary mass to match its spectral type gives an orbital inclination of 68¬∞. The derived size of the orbit depends on the inclination; for an inclination of 68¬∞ the semi-major axis is . =Properties= N76 in HŒ± (red), HeI (green), and HeII (blue) The total visual brightness of AB7 can be determined fairly accurately at absolute magnitude (MV) ‚àí6.1, 23,500 times brighter than the sun. The components cannot be observed separately and the contribution from each component can only be estimated. The O star dominates the visual spectrum and produces around 70% of the brightness, leading to MV ‚àí5.7, and ‚àí4.4 for the primary. The temperature of a star can be determined in several different ways: from the spectral type; directly from atmospheric models; and from the ionising effects of its radiation. Accurate calibrations are available for the temperatures of class-O stars, although these are slightly different for SMC metallicity and for stars of different luminosity classes. The temperatures for WR spectral classes are less precisely defined, especially for the SMC and especially for the hottest classes. AB7 completely ionises the surrounding interstellar material to a distance of 20 parsecs and this can be used to derive the temperature and luminosity of the ionising star. This level of ionisation cannot be achieved by an O6 star, so will be almost entirely due to the WR component. Unfortunately, the ionisation is beyond what would be caused by the hottest model, a 120,000K star. An earlier attempt at the same calculation gave a blackbody temperature of 80,000K. The temperatures can be calculated directly by modelling the atmospheres of both stars to reproduce the observed spectrum in detail. This method results in a temperature of 106,000 K for the WR component and 36,000 K for the O companion. The effective temperature is useful for modelling the atmosphere and comparison between stars, but a typical \\"observed\\" temperature at optical depth 2/3 can be significantly different for stars with a dense stellar wind. In the case of the WR primary star, the optical depth temperature is 96,000 K. The simplest way to measure the luminosity of a star is to observe its radiated output at all wavelengths (the spectral energy distribution or SED) and sum them together. Unfortunately this is impractical for AB7 because the majority of the radiation occurs in the far ultraviolet. A more common method is to measure the visual luminosity and apply a bolometric correction to give the total luminosity at all wavelengths, although the size of the bolometric correction is extremely sensitive to the effective temperature. Following this method gives a luminosity of for the primary. The luminosity can also be derived from the observed levels of ionisation. Assuming the older temperature of 80,000K gives . Modelling the atmospheres gives luminosities for the WR and O component of and respectively. The radius of a star with strong stellar wind is poorly- defined since any strong density discontinuity that might be defined as a surface is entirely hidden from view. Commonly used definitions of the radius in such cases include: a temperature radius; an optical depth radius; and a transformed radius. The differences are only significant in the case of the WR component. The temperature radius is the radius of a uniform disc that would produce the known luminosity at the calculated effective temperature, and is . The radius at optical depth 2/3 is . The transformed radius is a value used in the modelling of the atmosphere and is . The O-component radius is . The masses of each component in the AB7 system can be determined from the binary orbit. The minimum masses are found to be and respectively for the primary and secondary. With the assumption of an inclination of 60¬∞, the actual masses are and . The secondary is more massive and visually brighter, but not more luminous. Both components of AB7 have powerful stellar winds and are losing mass rapidly. Wind speeds of 1,700 km/s for the primary and 1,500 km/s for the secondary are calculated, with mass loss from the primary a billion times higher than the sun, and 100 million times for the secondary star. The WR wind is sufficiently dense that it obscures the photosphere of the star, leading to the unusual spectrum consisting almost entirely of emission lines broadened by the rapid expansion and turbulence of the wind. The high wind speeds and closeness of the stars mean that where the winds collide the material is shocked to temperatures over 20 million K, causing it to emit hard X-rays. =Evolution= Supernova type by initial mass and metallicity A model has been developed to show the evolution of a binary system leading to the currently observed state of AB7. The initial state has an primary and secondary in an orbit about twice its current size. The more massive primary leaves the main sequence after approximately 3.3 million years and overflows its roche lobe. In around 30,000 years it loses , only a small proportion of which is accreted by the secondary star. Relatively soon afterwards, the system settles to its current state. The original chemical abundances of the two stellar components are assumed to be typical of the SMC, with metallicity 1/5th to 1/10th of solar levels. In its current evolved state, the WR component shows dramatically different abundances, with hydrogen less than 20% at the surface, nitrogen almost undetectable, significant carbon enrichment, and most of the rest helium. This is unlike galactic and LMC WN stars which are almost entirely lacking hydrogen. It is a core helium burning star while the O type companion is still a core hydrogen burning star. In both the primary and secondary star, their cores will eventually collapse, resulting in a supernova explosion. The initially-more massive primary will collapse first, probably as a type Ic supernova, within a few hundred thousand years. The secondary will live on as a single star, or possibly in a binary with a supernova remnant, for a few million years before it also explodes as a supernova, probably a type Ib. Massive stars at SMC metallicity may produce a low luminosity supernova, or even collapse directly to a black hole without a visible explosion.

It is not philosophy of education, nor the philosophical study of education in general.  Philosophy education around the world  Education in the subject is usually divided into 4 main stages: pre-school (i.e. pre-primary; e.g. kindergarten) and primary education levels (e.g. elementary school), lower (e.g. middle school) and upper secondary education level (e.g. high school), tertiary (higher) education level (e.g. college, university), and post-tertiary education level. Sometimes the stage referred to as \\"post-secondary non-tertiary\\" is also included (in a fashion similar to the ISCED levels). Not all countries provide study of philosophy at all levels and in many the subject is virtually absent from the entire curriculum. = English-speaking countries = In the United States of America, philosophy is not generally taught at the pre-college level. However, through the movements of critical thinking and Philosophy for Children aspects of philosophy teaching have entered the curriculum. In recent years, some in the media have promoted the idea of introducing philosophy to American schools as an antidote to perceived political and societal dysfunction. In Canada, philosophy is not generally taught in public schools prior to university. However, in some provinces, such as British Columbia, philosophy is taught as a social studies course at a twelfth grade level. In the United Kingdom it is possible to do A-levels in philosophy. = Continental Europe = In many other European countries philosophy is part of the high school curriculum, such as for example in Austria, Croatia, Bulgaria, France, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Poland, and mainly Spain. In Germany the subject ethics has been introduced in more and more parts since the 1970s. In Croatia the subject ethics can be taken instead of religious education which mainly focuses on Catholic tradition. Spain is the most clear example of a philosophy education. In Secondary school all the students must take a little introduction to ethics, but it is during the sixth form, known there as 'bachillerato', where it is compulsory to take philosophy and citizenship in the first course, as well as history of philosophy in the second course in order to apply for university or just to get the title. University-level philosophy courses are widespread and are usually thought to have the longest tradition in the subject due to the historical ascription for the invention of philosophy as a separate discipline to the philosophers of Ancient Greece. = Africa and the Middle East = Philosophy education has a long tradition in some of the Arab states. According to a UNESCO-led poll, philosophy is taught at secondary level in Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Kuwait, Lebanon, Morocco, Mauritania, Qatar, the Syrian Arab Republic, Tunisia and Yemen. In most Arab countries the subject is taught at university (higher education) level. However, there are exceptions, like Oman and Saudi Arabia, where philosophy is entirely absent at most educational levels. = Asia = Philosophy education is traditionally available in most of Asia since the continent gave birth to the schools of Eastern philosophy. The 20th and early 21st century saw the increased interest in the field (especially in Western philosophy) in the Asian continent, with India, China and especially South Korea and Japan as major contemporary academic and research hubs. However, broad regional and interstate differences apply. = Latin America = In Brazil, philosophy is part of the high school curriculum since 2008.  Theoretical approaches to philosophy education  Theoretical questions concerning the teaching of philosophy in school have been debated at least since Immanuel Kant and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. The modern debate in Germany in the 1970s gave rise to two competing approaches: the more traditional, text-oriented approach by Wulff D. Rehfus and the more modern, dialogue-oriented approach by Ekkehard Martens. Newer approaches have been developed by Karel van der Leeuw and Pieter Mostert as well as Roland W. Henke. A similar divide between traditionalists and modernists is to be found in France, with the proponents Jacques Muglioni and Jacqueline Russ on the one side and France Rollin and Michel Tozzi on the other. In Italy, philosophy education is traditionally historically oriented in the sense of history of ideas. Theoretical problems of philosophy education at college and university level are discussed in articles in the journal Teaching Philosophy.  Didactic methods  Among the didactic methods in philosophy are the Socratic method and Hermeneutics. The pedagogic side of philosophy teaching is also of note to researchers in the field and philosophers of education.

Annis asked George W. Clark to join him in starting his company. Their primary work in the beginning was as a developer for NASA. Annis brought on as Chairman of the Board of Directors, Bruno Rossi, PhD, of Bruno Rossi of MIT to help guide their efforts. Rossi had earlier confirmed the existence of cosmic rays, and postulated that black holes would emit tremendous bursts of cosmic radiation as they swallowed celestial objects. At the urging of Rossi, Annis brought on board Riccardo Giacconi, from Italy, to work on the effort to develop a detector. As a consultant to American Science and Engineering, Inc., Rossi initiated the rocket experiments that discovered the first extra-solar source of X-rays, Scorpius X-1.[120].[121]. Despite Rossi's pivotal discoveries and work in this area, in 2002 Richardo Giacconi alone won the Nobel prize for its discovery and invention Nobel Prize in Physics. The AS&E; team made possible the Einstein Observatory (equipped with the first full imaging X-ray telescope on board a satellite, launched in 1978). Throughout his tenure as president of AS&E; (from its inception in 1958 until he left in 1993), Annis was a leading inventor/scientist for the company, including inventing the backscatter technology, which enabled the detection of plastic explosives, he also invented the body scanner, originally developed as a machine to detect contraband in/on people for prisons, but later adopted for use in airports. Body scanners are now standard as part of pre-boarding security screenings in airports around the world. . AS&E; also produced the first 4th generation CT scanner for commercial use in 1976. The development of focusing optics for soft X-rays led also to rocket-borne solar observations, the later Skylab space station, and several successive solar observatory satellites (e.g., Yohkoh and Hinode). These observations enabled major steps forward in our understanding of the physics of the solar corona and of plasma astrophysics in general. AS&E; provides both transmission X-ray and backscatter X-ray, equipment for airports, seaports, critical infrastructures, border crossings and other locations where security scanning is required. AS&E; has also developed a mobile backscatter X-ray van (ZBV).Forbes, 24 August 2010, Full-Body Scan Technology Deployed In Street-Roving VansDave Lindorff, CounterPunch, 1 October 2010, Now the Government is X-Raying You While You Drive In June 2016, OSI Systems offered to purchase the company for $269 million, After approval by regulators and shareholders, the deal competed before the end of 2016.

Osvobozhdenie, , ) is a film series released in 1970 and 1971, directed by Yuri Ozerov and shot in wide-format NIKFI process (70 mm). The script was written by Yuri Bondarev and Oscar Kurganov. The series was a Soviet-Polish-East German-Italian-Yugoslav co-production. The films are a dramatized account of the liberation of the Soviet Union's territory and the subsequent defeat of Nazi Germany in the Great Patriotic War, focusing on five major Eastern Front campaigns: the Battle of Kursk, the Lower Dnieper Offensive, Operation Bagration, the Vistula‚ÄìOder Offensive, and the Battle of Berlin. Plot =Film I: The Fire Bulge= After the Soviets are alerted to the imminent German offensive in Kursk, they launch a preemptive artillery strike, delaying the enemy. The battalion of Lieutenant Colonel Lukin ‚Äì led by officers Tzvetaev, Orlov, and Maximov ‚Äì participates in the battle, as well as the tank of Lieutenant Vasiliev. In KZ Sachsenhausen, Yakov Dzhugashvili refuses Andrei Vlasov's offer to exchange him for Friedrich Paulus. Meanwhile, in Kursk, the Germans advance. Maximov flees, but finally turns back and chooses to be shot when captured. When hearing about the German proposal regarding Yakov, Stalin rejects it, saying he will not trade a Field Marshal for a soldier. The Yugoslav partisans break out of an encirclement. The Soviet counter-offensive is launched in Kursk. Erich von Manstein commits all his forces to a final assault, bringing the Soviets close to defeat. Vatutin urges to send in the strategic reserve, which repels the Germans. =Film II: Breakthrough= After the Allied landing in Sicily, Mussolini is arrested on the King's orders. In Warsaw, the Polish Resistance bombs a German cinema. Mussolini is rescued. The Red Army reaches the Dnieper. Lukin's regiment crosses it, presumably as the division's vanguard; unbeknownst to them, they are merely a ploy to mislead the enemy. The regiment is cut off without reinforcements and wiped out. Lukin is killed. Tzvetaev leads the survivors back to their lines. On Stalin's orders, the Soviet High Command plans its offensive on Kiev, stealthily redeploying their forces. The city is liberated. The Allied leaders meet in Tehran. =Film III: Direction of the Main Blow= Part 1 Stalin informs his allies that a Soviet offensive will take place soon after the Normandy landings. The Stavka decides to strike in Belarus. Orlov leads his soldiers in a charge to rescue nurse Zoia, who insisted on evacuating the wounded from a battlefield. After concluding that the Belarus marshes are passable, Rokossovsky demands that the main effort be directed towards Bobruisk and insists until Stalin approves. Panteleimon Ponomarenko orders the Belorussian partisans to attack all railways. Operation Bagration is launched. Part 2 The Soviets march on Bobruisk. Afterwards, they liberate Minsk. A group of German officers tries to assassinate Hitler and take power, but fails. Churchill is pleased to hear of this, fearing a peace would leave Europe to Stalin. In Poland, Zawadzki and Berling watch the Bug River as the Polish 1st Army crosses it, saying they are happy to return home. =Film IV: The Battle of Berlin= Stalin orders to hasten the Vistula-Oder offensive in order to relieve the Allies. Karl Wolff is sent to negotiate with the Americans. Zhukov rejects Stavka's order to take Berlin, fearing an attack on his flank. In Yalta, Stalin notifies Churchill and Roosevelt that he knows of their secret dealings with the enemy. Saying that trust is the most important thing, he tears apart the picture showing Allen Dulles and Wolff. Zhukov's forces cross the Oder and approach Berlin. The Soviets capture a teenage sniper; they send him to his mother. Vasilev's tank crushes into a house. The crew has a pleasant meal with the owner's family. The Soviets and the Poles storm the Tiergarten. =Film V: The Last Assault= In Berlin, Lieutenant Yartsev's infantry and Tzvetaev's battery fight their way in the U-Bahn. When Hitler orders the tunnels flooded, Tzvetaev drowns while rescuing civilians. Captain Neustroev's company is selected to hoist the Victory Banner atop the Reichstag. Dorozhkin is assigned to them as a radio operator. In the F√ºhrerbunker, after marrying Eva Braun, Hitler murders her and commits suicide. At the Reichstag, Dorozhkin is killed in the fighting. The Victory Banner is unfurled on the dome. The Berlin garrison surrenders unconditionally. Outside the Reichstag, Vasiliev, Orlov, Yartsev, and an immense crowd of Red Army soldiers celebrate victory.

Ozerov later told his wife that during the Battle of K√∂nigsberg, he swore that one day \\"he would tell the story of the great army that fought in the war\\". After demobilization, he became a director in the Mosfilm studios. In the 1960s, both the Soviet government and military command were dismayed and disgruntled by several Western films about World War II which made no reference to the Red Army's participation in it, most prominently The Longest Day, though in 1967 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was planning an American-Russian international co- production of Cornelius Ryan's The Last Battle about the fall of Berlin. In late 1965, a year after Leonid Brezhnev's rise to power, a meeting of senior officials from the Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Culture and Ministry of Finance was convened. They decided to commission \\"a monumental epic\\" which would demonstrate the importance of the Soviet role in the war. Ozerov, who shared the establishment's sentiments and for whom \\"it was unbearable, as a veteran, to watch those Western films\\", was chosen to direct it. In the Brezhnev era, the commemoration of the Second World War was awarded unprecedented importance. Historian Nina Tumarkina described it as \\"the cult of the Great Patriotic War\\": its memory, molded according to official historiography, was to serve as a unifying narrative; reverence towards the sacrifices made became the core of a new Soviet patriotism. Denise J. Youngblood described Liberation as the \\"Brezhnev era's canonical war film\\", writing that it was \\"clearly designed to buttress the war cult.\\" =Development= The work on the series commenced in 1966. German film scholar Ralf Schenk noted that \\"virtually all means were made available... for Ozerov\\"; Lars Karl estimated the project's budget was equivalent to US$40 million. The director was also closely supervised ‚Äì the series had to meet the approval of General Alexei Yepishev, the Chief of the Armed Forces' Political Directorate, as well as that of Mikhail Suslov. Chapter 17. Lazar Lazarev, a member of the Soviet Filmmakers' Association, wrote \\"Liberation ...was forced down from above, from the Ideological Departments\\". From the very beginning, it was made clear that the films should not deal with the darker chapters of World War II, such as the defense of Moscow and Stalingrad, but only with the Red Army's unbroken string of victories from the Battle of Kursk onwards. At first, two prominent authors, Konstantin Simonov and Viktor Nekrasov, were offered to write the script. Both saw Liberation as an effort to rehabilitate Stalin, and declined. After Nekrasov's and Simonov's refusal, Yuri Bondarev and Oscar Kurganov were tasked with writing the script. Originally, the series was supposed to be a purely historical, documentary-like trilogy called The Liberation of Europe 1943‚Äì45. Fearing this style would discourage viewers, it was decided to combine fictional characters into the plot. Bondarev wrote the live action scenes; Kurganov was responsible for the historical parts, featuring the leaders and generals. The latter sections were intentionally filmed in black-and-white, to resemble old footage.Chapter 75: Liberation (available on the book's official website). The script introduced many little- known details about the Soviet-German War's history, that were rarely discussed publicly: notably, General Andrey Vlasov was presented for the first time in Soviet cinema. pp. 19‚Äì22. Vlasov's was an uncredited role, referred to only as \\"the General\\" on set. Foreign film studios were invited to take part in the production, beside Mosfilm: The East German company DEFA, The Yugoslav Avala Film and the Italian Dino de Laurentiis Cinematografica. Zesp√≥≈Ç Filmowy Start, the first Polish studio to participate in the co-production of Liberation, was closed at April 1968. It was replaced by Przedsiƒôbiorstwo Realizacji Film√≥w-Zespo≈Çy Filmowe (PRF-ZF). Ozerov asked Marshal Georgy Zhukov to be the films' chief military consultant. However, Zhukov had little political influence at the time, and the establishment did not approve of him. Eventually, General Sergei Shtemenko took the role. In spite of this, Ozerov consulted with Zhukov unofficially, and the Marshal provided him with the draft of his memoirs. There were other consultants, as well: Generals Alexander Rodimtsev, Grigory Oriol and Sergei Siniakov, Vice-Admiral Vladimir Alexeyev, Polish Army Colonel Zbigniew Za≈Çuski and National People's Army Colonel Job von Witzleben.All the specified details appear in the films' credits. The script of the first two parts was completed by the end of 1966, and the producers began preparing to commence filming shortly after. =Casting= A major obstacle facing the producers was that most of the Soviet leadership took part in the war; Many high-ranking officers and politicians were portrayed in the films with their wartime ranks, and the actors depicting them had to receive the models' blessing. Ozerov lengthily dwelt on the question who would be cast as Zhukov, until the Marshal himself aided him, telling he thought about the star of The Chairman. Thus, Mikhail Ulyanov received the role. Ivan Konev was irritated by Yuri Leghkov, who depicted him in the first two parts. He demanded Ozerov would replace him with someone else, complaining the actor was constantly bothering him with questions. Vasily Shukshin was called to substitute Leghkov. For the character of Tzvetaev, Ozerov chose the young Nikolay Olyalin, an actor of the Krasnoyarsk Children Theater. Olyalin had received several offers to appear in other films, but the theater managers dispersed of them, fearing he would leave them. One of the theater employees told Olyalin of Ozerov's offer. He claimed he was sick and then boarded a plane to Moscow. The Kazakh SSR's People's Artist Yuri Pomerantsev was cast as Vlasov after an assistant- director saw him in theater. He had difficulties finding any material on the character. Bukhuti Zaqariadze was selected to appear in the sensitive role of Joseph Stalin. Vasily Shukshin recounted that upon seeing Zaqariadze in the Stalin costume ‚Äì that was made by the dead premier's own personal tailor, who was contacted by the studio for this purpose ‚Äì General Shtemenko instinctively stood to attention and saluted. East German actor Fritz Diez was reluctant to portray Hitler. He had already appeared as such in three other films and feared becoming \\"a slave to one role\\". Diez's wife, Martha, played the old woman who served coffee to Tzvetaev in Berlin. The Italian Ivo Garrani played Benito Mussolini. =Principal photography= 150 tanks 2,000 artillery pieces and 5,000 extras, mostly Soviet soldiers, were involved in the making of all the five parts of the series. The producers searched in vain for real Tiger I and Panther tanks: eventually, replicas of 10 Tigers and 8 Panthers (converted from T-44 and IS-2 tanks respectively) were manufactured in a Soviet tank factory in Lvov. Beside those, many T-55s, T-62s and IS-3s ‚Äì models that were developed after the war ‚Äì can be clearly seen in the film, painted as German or Soviet tanks. It was considered to film the Fire Bulge in Kursk, but the old battlefield was littered with unexploded ordnance. Therefore, a special set was constructed in the vicinity of Pereiaslav-Khmelnytskyi where art director Alexander Myaghkov was free to use live explosives. The combat scenes in the first two parts were shot there, in the summer of 1967. 3,000 troops, 100 tanks, 18 military aircraft and hundreds of artillery pieces were used to recreate the Battle of Kursk; 30 kilometers of trenches were dug to resemble the wartime fortifications. Ozerov supervised the set from a specially-built tower, using a handkerchief to signal the engineers when to detonate the charges. On one occasion, the director absentmindedly blew his nose, and \\"one and half tons of TNT went off\\". The outdoor photography for Main Blow took place in Lithuania, near Pabradƒó, since the marshes in Belarus ‚Äì the location of the 1944 battles depicted in the film ‚Äì were being drained. The Italian parts were shot in Rome, while the Yalta Conference was filmed in the Livadia Palace. Filming also took place in Poland. The scenes in Warsaw were shot in the city's Castle Square and at the S≈Çu≈ºewiec neighbourhood. The 20 July 1944 assassination attempt was filmed in the original Wolfsschanze. The scenes in Berlin were mostly shot in the city itself. East German Foreign Minister Otto Winzer had authorized the producers to use the ruins of the Gendarmenmarkt. p. 231. Ozerov, accompanied by a crew of some 2000 people, cordoned off a part of the area and used an old, abandoned cathedral to substitute for the Reichstag. The hoisting of the Victory Banner was shot atop the Haus der Technik in the Wilhelmstra√üe. Indoor fighting was filmed in Mosfilm's studios, and the U-Bahn scene took place in Moscow's metro ‚Äì where Myaghkov rebuilt the Kaiserhof station. =Approval= The Fire Bulge was completed in late 1968. A special screening was made to Shtemenko, who had only two comments to make: first, a scene showing a soldier entertaining local girls in his tank had to be removed; Second, when seeing the actor portraying him with major general ranks, he claimed he was already a lieutenant general at the time. Ozerov answered that according to their material, he was not. The aforementioned scene does not appear in the film. A more important pre-release viewing had to be held for Defense Minister Andrei Grechko and Yepishev. After the screening ended, the generals headed for the exit without saying a word. Ozerov asked for their opinion; Grechko answered, \\"I will not say a word to you!\\" and left the room. The film had to be edited four times before it was authorized for public screening on 1969, together with the already finished second part, Breakthrough. The two had their world premiere in July 1969, during the VI Moscow Film Festival. Reception =Distribution= The Fire Bulge and Breakthrough were released together in 2,202 prints on 7 May 1970 (including more than 200 prints in 70 mm), two days before the 25th anniversary of Victory Day. Richard Stites reported that the Communist Party instructed all its members to purchase tickets. 56.1 million people watched the first, of which 56 million returned after the intermission for the second. Those figures were lower than expected, as popular pictures about the war which did not enjoy such promotion had much larger audiences. Yet still, The Fire Bulge/Breakthrough reached the first place at the Soviet box office for 1970. Together, they are also the 31st and the 32nd highest-grossing Soviet films ever.Kudryavtsev, Sergei (1998). Svoe Kino. Dubl-D. OCLC 42657018. p. 375. Direction of the Main Blow, distributed in 1,476 prints, had 35.8 million viewers,Kudryavtsev, Sergei. Soviet Box Office . kinanet.ru. making it to the third place on the 1971 box office.Razzakov, Fedor (2008). Gibel π sovetskogo kino. Exmo. . p. 183. Finally, the two concluding films, The Battle of Berlin and The Last Assault were released together in 1,341 prints. They had an audience of 28 million, reaching the 11th place for 1972. Denise J. Youngblood wrote that, considering the \\"unprecedented\\" public relations campaign the film received and the forced attendance of viewers, the last part's success of drawing only 28 million moviegoers was \\"almost pitiable\\". She attributed this, partially, to the \\"grandiose scale\\" of the films, which made it hard to maintain the interest of the audience. Youngblood concluded that the series was a \\"relative failure\\". The series was distributed in 115 countries around the world. In the People's Republic of Bulgaria, it sold a total of 7 million tickets.Bulgaria Today. Sofia Press Agency (November 1975). Volume XXIV, no. 11. ISSN 0204-8868. p. 21. In the German Democratic Republic, 4 million people watched The Fire Bulge/Breakthrough between its release in November 1970 until the opening of Main Blow in June 1971.Ilse Heller, Hans-Thomas Krause. Kulturelle Zusammenarbeit, DDR-UdSSR in den 70er Jahren. Staatsverlag der DDR (1979). OCLC 123205791. p. 58. The series was endorsed also by the East German government. The East Berlin premiere was attended by Socialist Unity Party of Germany's leadership, and the state film distributor Progress Film declared in its policy guidelines that \\"each young citizen of our country should watch this picture already during his time at school\\"; it became part of the curriculum, and pupils have watched it in mandatory showings. The Free German Youth often held screenings at culture evenings. According to official Soviet statistics, Liberation sold more than 400 million tickets worldwide. In the English-speaking world, a shorter, 118-minutes long version was disseminated under the title The Great Battle. =Awards= The Fire Bulge/Breakthrough was screened outside the competition in the 1970 Karlovy Vary International Film Festival, and Yuri Ozerov received a special prize of the Czechoslovak-Soviet Friendship Society. The readers of the journal Sovietsky Ekran, the State Committee for Cinematography's official publication, chose The Direction of the Main Blow as the best film of 1971. Ozerov, Bondarev, Cinematographer Igor Slabnevich and Art Director Alexander Myaghkov were all awarded the Lenin Prize in 1972 for their work on Liberation. The films won the Best Film Award at the 1972 Tiflis All-Union Film Festival, and Ozerov received the Polish- Soviet Friendship Society's Silver Medal in 1977. The series was submitted by the Soviet Union as a candidate for the Best Foreign Language Film in the 46th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences =Critical response= In accordance with government endorsement, the Soviet press excessively promoted the film, and war veterans published columns that praised its authenticity. The state-approved Soviet Encyclopedia of Cinema cited Liberation as correcting the \\"falsification of history\\" presented in The Longest Day. The films were noted for the scales of the production: Mira and Antonin Liehm cited it alongside Waterloo and War and Peace as foremost among Soviet \\"monumental films, which, with the expenditure of immense amounts of money, brought... history to the screen.\\" It is still acclaimed for this reason; Lars Karl wrote \\"it was a gigantic work... The cinematic monumentality was to prove the Soviet Union's might.\\" Denise J. Youngblood called Liberation the \\"most grandiose Soviet WWII picture\\". Soviet critic Rostislav Yurenev \\"praised the meticulously recreated battle scenes\\". Der Spiegel lauded Ozerov for portraying the German side \\"with due consideration\\" for details. Karl-Heinz Jan√üen from Die Zeit wrote that Liberation was a \\"colossal film series... A cenotaph of celluloid.\\" However, the series was not seen as an artistic achievement. Ozerov wrote an article in the February 1971 issue of the Soviet magazine Art of Cinema, in which he declared that his film should be considered as one of the best dealing with the theme of the Great Patriotic War, along the likes of the 1964 The Living and the Dead. Two months later, the important author Semion Freilikh completely ignored Liberation when discussing the genre of war films in the same magazine. Denise Youngblood wrote that this was no coincidence. Eventually, the series was never selected to appear on the official lists of the greatest World War II films, which were compiled on every fifth Victory anniversary. Lazar Lazarev wrote in his memoirs that Liberation was a return to the style of the propagandistic films before the Thaw, \\"a modern version of the Fall of Berlin\\". A year after the Last Assault was released, David Robinson called Liberation a \\"hollow, spectacular, monumental display.\\" pp. 388. Mira and Antonin Liehm judged it as \\"entirely sterile\\". Author Ivan Butler simply described it as a \\"stranded whale of a film.\\" =Analysis= The Second World War was always a crucial topic for Soviet filmmakers. Immediately after the war, propaganda epics like The Fall of Berlin presented it as an heroic, collective effort of the people that was brilliantly led by Stalin. After his death, the Khrushchev Thaw enabled filmmakers to depict the war as a personal, inglorious experience of the individual participants ‚Äì with films as Ivan's Childhood or Ballad of a Soldier. The Brezhnev administration supported a return to a more conservative style, presenting the war as a noble, ideological struggle once more. In an essay on the series, Dr. Lars Karl wrote: \\"In this context, Liberation held special importance\\": he regarded it as ushering the Brezhnev Stagnation into Soviet cinema, during which \\"a new conservatism and sharpened censure molded the cinematic image of the war into conventional patterns.\\" Mira and Antonin Liehm also noted that with its focus on the politicians and generals rather than ordinary people, it was \\"almost reminiscent of the 'Artistic Documentary' period\\" ‚Äì the era of the Stalinist epics. Even the splitting of the plot to three lines ‚Äì leaders' meetings, \\"huge battle scenes\\" and parts featuring common people ‚Äì was a return to that style. Lisa A. Kirshenbaum assessed that in comparison to more sincere Great Patriotic War films, like The Ascent or The Cranes Are Flying, the \\"heroic, if not kitschy\\" Liberation conformed to the \\"Cult of the Great Patriotic War\\". Stalin's return was another important trait: during the Thaw, in the aftermath of the XX Party Congress and De- Stalinization, Eastern Bloc films rarely depicted Stalin, if at all. Scenes featuring him were edited out from many older pictures.Liehm, p. 204. Liberation presented Stalin as the Supreme Commander, his first major appearance on screen since the Secret Speech ‚Äì a token to the Brezhnev Era softer view of him, Still, his character did not occupy a central role as it had done in the films produced during his reign. Ozerov later claimed that he never included the controversial figure in the script, and had to shoot the Stalin scenes secretly, at night. He told interviewer Victor Matizen that the \\"State Secretary for Cinematography almost had a seizure when he found out.\\" Ralf Schenk noted that one detail, which explained its popularity with the East German audience, was the portrayal of the German enemy, which was seen as capable and, to a certain degree, honorable; in earlier Soviet films this was largely not the case. And chiefly, the 20 July Plot conspirators were presented as heroes, providing positive Germans to identify with beside the communist resistance; in East Germany they were always depicted as aristocratic opportunists who turned on Hitler only when their own status was in peril. Denise J. Youngblood stated that the films ‚Äì depicting the protagonists as human and imperfect ‚Äì were still influenced by the Khrushchev Thaw's artistic freedom, writing that: \\"It is, however, important to stress that Ozerov was far from a 'tool' of war cult propaganda... Liberation is a much better film than critics allowed\\". German author Christoph Dieckmann wrote that \\"Despite of all the propaganda, Liberation is an anti-war film, a memento mori to the uncountable lives sacrificed for victory.\\" =Historical accuracy= The sociologist Lev Gudkov saw the series as a succinct representation of the Soviet official view on the war's history: \\"The dominant understanding of the war is shown in the film epic Liberation... All other versions only elaborated on this theme.\\" He characterized this view as one that allowed \\"a number of unpleasant facts\\" to be \\"repressed from mass consciousness\\". Lars Karl claimed that the Red Army liberated Europe, \\"and therefore, the USSR had a right to have a say in its matters.\\" He noted that Roosevelt and Churchill are depicted as \\"paper tigers\\" who are keen to reach a settlement with Hitler; in the Battle of Berlin, Stalin informs both that he knows of the covert Dulles-Wolff dealings when they assemble in the Yalta Conference, a month before the actual negotiations took place; in reality, the Soviets were notified about them beforehand. Karl added that no mention of the Stalin-Hitler Pact is made. Polish author ≈Åukasz Jasina commented that the Bug River is spoken of as the Polish border already during 1944 ‚Äì although the USSR annexed the eastern territories of Poland only after the war. p. 7. Russian historian Boris Sokolov wrote that the film's depiction of Battle of Kursk was \\"completely false\\" and the German casualties were exaggerated. Liberation presents the civilian population in Berlin welcoming the Red Army; German author J√∂rg von Mettke wrote the scene in which the German women flirt with the soldiers \\"might have happened, but it was mostly otherwise.\\" Grigory Filaev called the films an \\"encyclopedia of myths\\", and claimed that they spread the falsehood according to which Stalin ordered Kiev to be captured before the eve of the 26th Anniversary of the October Revolution. Yakov Dzhugashvili's daughter, Galina, claimed that the phrase \\"I will not trade a Field Marshal for a soldier\\", that is strongly associated with Yakov's story, was never uttered by her grandfather and is \\"just a quote from Liberation\\". Yakov Dzhugashvili's appearance in The Fire Bulge was anachronistic: he is depicted meeting General Vlasov on 5 July 1943. He died on 14 April 1943.

Born in Bennettsbridge, County Kilkenny, Treacy first arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of twenty- three when he made his senior debut in the 1959 championship. Treacy went on to play a semi-regular part for Kilkenny over the next few years, and won one All-Ireland medal and two Leinster medals. At club level Treacy played with Bennesttsbridge, winning six championship medals. His younger brother, Jim Treacy, also hurled with Kilkenny and captained the team to the All-Ireland title in 1967. In retirement from playing Treacy became involved in administrative affairs and served with the Bennettsbridge club and the Kilkenny County Board. Playing career =Club= Treacy played with Bennettsbridge during a golden age for the club. He won his first championship medal in 1959 following a 4-6 to 1-4 defeat of Erin's Own. Treacy won a second consecutive medal in 1960 as Bennettsbridge accounted for Glenmore by 4-5 to 3-4. Three-in-a-row proved beyond Bennettsbridge, however, the club reached the decider again in 1962. A 5-7 to 2-8 defeat of Lisdowny gave Treacy a third championship medal. Bennettsbridge surrendered their championship crown again the following year, however, a 4-9 to 1-4 trouncing of Glenmore in 1964 gave Treacy a fourth championship medal. Mooncoin wrested the title from \\"the Bridge\\" in 1965, however, Treacy won his fifth and sixth championship medals following victories over Mooncoin and Thomastown over the following two years. =Inter-county= Treacy made his senior championship debut on 12 July 1959 in a 2-9 to 1-11 provincial final defeat of Dublin. It was his first Leinster medal. Treacy was later dropped from the starting fifteen for Kilkenny's All- Ireland final meeting with Waterford on 6 September 1959. That came ended in a 1-17 to 5-5 draw. Treacy was also an unused substitute for the subsequent replay, which Waterford won by 3-12 to 1-10 win. After surrendering their provincial crown for the next two years, Treacy won a second Leinster medal in 1963 following a 2-10 to 0-9 defeat of Dublin. This victory allowed Kilkenny to advance directly into an All-Ireland showdown with Waterford on 1 September 1963. \\"The Cats\\" entered the game as underdogs, however, star forward Eddie Keher proved to be the difference with a magnificent display in which he scored fourteen points.

He came to New England from the town of Yeovil in Somerset, England and first settled in Salem in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, but difficulties with the authorities prompted him to join Roger Williams in settling near the Narragansett Bay in 1638 at Providence Plantations. He remained there for a few years, but he was recorded as an inhabitant of Warwick in 1648, probably having settled there several years earlier. He was most active in colonial affairs from 1650 to 1660 when he was a commissioner, surveyor of highways, and the keeper of a house of entertainment. His highest offices were as an Assistant in 1653 and much later as a deputy to the General Court in 1671 when he was almost 80 years old. He made his will on January 12, 1677 but died the same day with it unsigned, leaving his affairs in limbo for the following two decades. Early life St John's Church in Yeovil, Somerset, England where Stukely Westcott and Juliann Marchante were married in 1619 The place of origin of the Westcott family appears to center around the town of Affton in county Devon, England. Here the unusual combination appears of the surnames Stukely and Westcott, as does the very unusual female given name of Damaris, found in the Stukely family. Stukely Westcott first appears on a public record when he was married to Juliann Marchante in St. John's Church in Yeovil, Somerset on October 5, 1619; his marriage record indicated that he was from Ilminster, a town in Somerset about 12 miles west of Yeovil. The baptisms of two of Stukely Westcott's children were also recorded in Yeovil, daughter Damaris in 1620/21 and son Samuel in 1622/23. There is no record of where Westcott lived following the baptisms of these two children, but there is evidence that he and his family accompanied the family of William Arnold to New England, departing from the port town of Dartmouth in county Devon in 1635, based on a memorandum made in April 1656 by Benedict Arnold, the oldest son of William Arnold. Westcott's daughter Damaris married Benedict Arnold several years later. Settling in New England Original town layout of Providence Plantations, showing Westcott's lot near the middle, to the left of the letter \\"C\\" in the word \\"Providence\\" Westcott first settled in the town of Salem in the Massachusetts Bay Colony where he was received as an inhabitant and made a freeman in 1636. In late 1637, he was granted a house lot in Salem, his family then consisting of eight members. Tensions quickly arose with the local authorities, however, and he was given license to depart Salem in March 1638, along with several others, with the provision that he would be summoned if not gone by a court date in May. Within weeks, he and his family joined Roger Williams and other settlers in establishing a new settlement on land that Williams had bought from the local Indians on the Narragansett Bay. The settlement was named Providence Plantations, and the initials S.W. for Stukely Westcott appear first on the deed signed by Williams, followed by the initials W.A. of his future in-law William Arnold. In 1640, Westcott signed an agreement with 38 others to form a civil government in Providence. He lived there for a few years, but he was recorded as one of the inhabitants of Warwick in 1648. However, he had likely gone to Warwick shortly after its establishment by Samuel Gorton in 1642, and he may have been there as early as 1643. He lived in Warwick for most of the remainder of his life until the events of King Philip's War compelled him to move across the Narragansett Bay. Westcott appears most often on the public records for Rhode Island between 1650 and 1660. He was a commissioner from Warwick during five different years, and he was a surveyor of highways during most of those years. In 1653, he had the position of assistant in the colony and was on a committee to confer with the Indians about fencing and other matters. Warwick settlers had been accused of treating the Indians unfairly, and Westcott and a Mr. Smith were ordered in 1655 to gather up compensation that was due the Indians. In 1660, he was the foreman of a grand inquest to look into the beating death of a local Indian. In 1655, Westcott was appointed to keep a house of entertainment, and he again received authorization in 1664 for keeping \\"an ordinary for entertainment\\" while the King's Commissioners held court in Warwick. King Philip's War One of the highest offices held by Westcott was Deputy to the General Court which he held during 1671 when he was nearly 80 years old. Within a few years, he was surrounded by the tumultuous events of King Philip's War which was the outcome of severe friction between several of the New England tribes and the colonists. The settlement of Warwick was totally destroyed, and the aged and infirm Westcott was taken to the settlement at Portsmouth on Rhode Island to the house of his grandson Caleb Arnold, the son of Governor Benedict Arnold. On January 12, 1677, he knew that the end of his life was near, and he drafted a will under the direction of his grandson. He did not sign it, however, expecting his sons to arrive from Prudence Island the next day. He died before they could get to his side, however, and the will was never signed. It was not until 20 years after his death that the will was approved and recorded into the town records. Shortly after his death, his remains were carried back to Warwick where he was buried by his wife on their old homestead. Children and descendants Stukely and Juliann Westcott had six children, but a baptismal record has only been found for the first two. The oldest child was Damaris, baptized at Yeovil on January 27, 1620/21. She married Benedict Arnold on December 17, 1640, the son of William and Christian (Peak) Arnold, and the couple had nine children. She died after 1678. Samuel was baptized at Yeovil on March 31, 1622, but he probably died before adulthood in New England. Robert married Catharine Rathburn and they had six children. He was a lieutenant who was killed in 1676 during King Philip's War. Amos (1631‚Äì1685) married Sarah Stafford on July 13, 1667, the daughter of Thomas and Elizabeth Stafford. He married Deborah Stafford on June 9, 1670, the sister of Sarah. He had one child with his first wife and five with his second. Mercy married Samuel Stafford, son of Thomas and Elizabeth Stafford, and they had nine children. She died on March 25, 1700. Jeremiah married Eleanor England on July 27, 1665, daughter of William and Elizabeth England, and they had eight children. He died in 1686. Notable descendants of Westcott through his daughter Damaris (wife of Governor Benedict Arnold) include great-great- grandson Benedict Arnold, the general during the American Revolutionary War who initially was a great leader, but who is now remembered for his treason and betrayal of his homeland and fellow American soldiers. Another descendant was Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry, American hero of the Great Lakes during the War of 1812. His younger brother Commodore Matthew C. Perry was sent by President Millard Fillmore to compel the opening of Japan to the West with the Convention of Kanagawa in 1854. Stephen Arnold Douglas debated Abraham Lincoln in 1858 before a senate race and later lost to him in the 1860 presidential election. Rhode Island colonial Deputy Governor George Hazard is another descendant.

The ABAP is composed of 14 akharas, or organisations of Hindu sants and sadhus. Nirmohi Akhara (involved in the Ram Janmabhoomi dispute in Ayodhya) and Shri Dattatreya Akhara are two of the prominent akharas which are part of it. Organisation The Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad is based on the system of akharas in Hindu society. An akhara literally means a wrestling ring in Hindi, but also stands for a place of debate. There are 14 such organisations based on the form of Hinduism and Hindu philosophy they adhere to. Most Akharas are Vaishnavas (devotees of Lord Vishnu) and Shaivas (devotees of Lord Shiva). History The system of akharas may date as far back as early 8th century, when Adi Shankaracharya is believed to have established seven akharas (possibly 10 as they are also known as Dasnaami): Mahanirvani, Niranjani, Juna, Atal, Avahan, Agni and Anand Akhara. The earliest recorded founding of an akhara was that of the Abhana in 547 CE. During periods of Muslim rule in India and later British rule, the akharas congregated and organised together, especially during the Kumbha Mela to work for the preservation of Hindu religion and culture. In 1565, Madhusudana Sarasvati started preparing akharas as an armed military force to resist invasions and protect Hindus. Politics While the ABAP does not participate in electoral politics, it has a position of great importance in Hindu society as a leading Hindu leadership organisation. At times, it has cooperated with the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP), a Hindu religious organisation more openly involved in politics and part of the Sangh Parivar of Hindu nationalist organisations. However, the ABAP has also openly criticised the VHP for raising unnecessary controversies and refused to follow an agenda set by the VHP. The Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad has encouraged and supported the movement for the construction of a Ram Janmabhumi Temple on the site where the now-demolished Babri Mosque stood in Ayodhya. The place is believed to be the site of birth of Rama, the eighth and one of the most popular Avatars of Vishnu. In 1989, the Nirmohi Akhara filed litigation regarding the site, and in 2010 their claim was upheld by the Allahabad High Court, which gave the akhara control of one-third of the site. The ABAP welcomed the verdict, asserting that it would prevent further exploitation of the issue by political parties. They are known to sanction anyone who misused Hinduism.https://www.firstpost.com/india/akhil-bharatiya- akhara-parishad-releases-list-of-fake-babas-demands-legislation-against-these- cult-leaders-4029057.html 13 akharas As of January 2019 there were 13 recognised akharas, with Juna Akhara being the largest.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-46780219 Seven of these akharas were founded by Adi Shankaracharya. There are 3 types of akharas; Nirvani Ani Akhada, Digambar Ani Akhada and Nirmal Ani Akhada. =Nirvani Ani Akhada= It has the largest number of akhadas for the Sadhu Sants and the Naga Sadhus as well. There are seven Nirvani Ani Akhadas: * Shri Panchdashnaam Juna Akhada (Varanasi): It is the largest of the 13 Akhadas. The Juna Akhada follows the Dashnaami Sampraday of Shaivism founded by Adi Shankaracharya. They worship Lord Dattatreya. The Kinnar Akhara (Transgender Akhara) is also under the Juna Akhada. * Shri Panchayati Nirvani Akhada (Prayagraj): It is the second largest akhada. It was founded in 904 AD in Gujarat. Niranjani Akhada worships Kartikeya. The Niranjani Akhada consists of a lot of educated persons having doctorate and post graduation. * Shri Panch Atal Akhada (Varanasi): It is one of three oldest Akhadas. They worships Lord Ganesha and the holy symbols of Bhairva Prakash Bhala and Surya Prakash Bhala. * Shri Panchdashnaam Aavahan Akhada (Varanasi): It is the oldest monastic order. They worship Dattatreya. * Taponidhi Shri Anand Panchayati Akhada (Nasik): It is the second oldest Akhara. The deity of this Akhada is Dev Bhuwan Bhaskar Suryanarayan. * Shri Panchayati Mahaniranjani Akhada (Prayagraj):The deity of the Akhara is Sage Kapilmuni and they have holy symbols like Bhairva Prakash Bhala and Surya Prakash Bhala. * Shri Panchdashnaam Panchagni Akhada/Shri Shambhu Panchagni Akhara (Junagarh): They are Brahmchari saints. They differ from other Shaivite akharas as they do not practice dhuni (the fire sacrifice) and do not consume any intoxicant and wear janau or the sacred thread. =Digambar Ani Akhada= It is also known as Bairagi Akhadas. They are Vaishnavas (followers of Lord Vishnu).The ISKCON (Hare Krishnas) is under this akhara.

It is a brick building constructed in 1935 and designed by Eric Kebbon in the Colonial Revival style, and is considered one of the finest post offices in that style in New York State. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989, along with many other post offices in the state. Building The post office is located on the north side of the street, midway between the two avenues. The neighboring buildings are large apartment houses, modern on either side of the post office and older across the street. There are two sections to the building. Both are three stories in height, with the first story faced in rusticated limestone on a granite foundation and the upper stories in brick laid in Flemish bond with limestone trim. The five-bay main section has a three-bay central projecting front-gabled pavilion with a stone pediment. To the east is a three-bay wing with a segmental-arched garage. On the main block, the south-facing first floor windows are all tripartite round-arched windows with 8-over-12 double-hung wooden sash windows in the center, five- pane sidelights and compound fanlights. They are complemented by a projecting keystone and radiating voussoirs. The second floor windows are 12-over-12 double-hung sash with limestone balustrades in front on the main block. On the pavilion they are additionally topped with stone pediments; segmental arched with supporting brackets in the center and triangular in the middle. On the main block and the wing they have projecting stone lintels. Above them, the third floor windows are four-over-eight sash with simple stone surrounds. The central window in the pavilion has a shouldered surround with volutes at the base. Below it a flagpole projects from a limestone panel between it and the second-story window below. The pavilion's gable is trimmed in limestone. At its bottom is a plain frieze with \\"United States Post Office\\" carved into it. The entablature is set off by a cornice and has a central carved roundel depicting an eagle and shield. The shallow pitched roof is sheathed in metal. alt=A room with a high yellow ceiling with fluorescent lights and ceiling fans. It has a crisscross black pattern on a tan floor, with ropes and stanchions creating space for a line. Along the walls are teller windows with bronze grilles. The logo of the United States Postal Service is on many displays in the image Balustraded granite steps on either side of the projecting pavilion lead to the main entrances. They have bronze doors topped by blind fanlights with eagles carved in bas-relief. Original lamps are still in place. They open into a vestibule with rusticated limestone walls. The lobby has a terrazzo floor in gray, gold and black marble, green marble baseboard, applied Doric order in honey-colored marble around the entire room, square plaster cornice and shallow squared coffered plaster ceiling. Doors have limestone surrounds with marble transoms. Small Doric pilasters divide the teller windows, which retain their original bronze grilles. Three of the original customer tables remain. They are bronze with glass tops and Greek- inspired decorated bases. History Lenox Hill was one of 12 post offices built in mid-1930s Manhattan as part of federal relief efforts in the face of the ongoing Great Depression. An amendment to the Public Buildings Act in 1930 gave the Treasury Department's Supervising Architect the authority to hire outside consulting architects to design buildings, to provide work for unemployed architects. In New York, many of those architects built post offices in the New York metropolitan area. Eric Kebbon, still employed in private practice at the time, was retained to design five Manhattan post offices. Prior to working for the Treasury Department he had designed the AT&T; building at Broadway and Fulton Street. Later he would, as the architect for the city's school system, design over a hundred school buildings. Kebbon, unlike some other consulting architects, appears to have been given complete freedom in designing the Lenox Hill post office, which serves some of Manhattan's wealthiest neighborhoods. His design, which has been called the finest Colonial Revival post office in the state, is similar to his later Planetarium post office across town on the Upper West Side, but less restrained in its decoration. Many elements are common to other New York City post offices, such as the multi-story main block, full lot coverage and raised basement. Unlike many Colonial Revival post offices in the state, both inside and outside the city, it has two entrances on the side of the projecting pavilion instead of one entrance in the middle.

He initially was part of the agrarian rebellions of Wang Xianzhi and Huang Chao, but later became a Tang officer. His rebellion in 887 against Gao Pian the military governor (Jiedushi) of Huainan Circuit (Ê∑ÆÂçó, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) would be the start of sustained warfare that left the once-wealthy circuit in devastation. Life =Early life= It is not known when Bi Shiduo was born, but it is known that he was from Yuanqu (within modern Heze, Shandong),Old Book of Tang, vol. 182. where Huang Chao was from as well.New Book of Tang, vol. 225, part 2. =Rebellion against the Tang= When Wang Xianzhi started a rebellion against the reign of Emperor Xizong in 874,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 252. Bi joined the rebellion. He was known for his abilities in horsemanship and archery, and his followers referred to him as \\"the Kestrel.\\" After Wang Xianzhi's death in 878, it appeared that Bi followed Huang. In 879, when Gao Pian, who was then the military governor of Zhenhai Circuit (ÈéÆÊµ∑, headquartered in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu), sent the officers Zhang Lin () and Liang Zan () to attack Huang and repeatedly defeated Huang, Bi, along with several other key Huang followers, including Qin Yan, Li Hanzhi, and Xu Qing (), surrendered to Gao, and thereafter became a follower to Gao.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 253. = Service under Gao Pian = It was said that in subsequent confrontations where Gao Pian had victories over Huang Chao, Bi Shiduo was a major contributor to the victories, along with Liang Zan. Gao thus treated him well. After Gao was transferred to Huainan Circuit in 879, it appeared that Bi followed him there, as Bi was referred to as a Huainan officer in summer 880. By that point, the tide of war had turned against Gao, as Huang had killed Zhang Lin in battle and was advancing north, approaching Huainan's capital Yang Prefecture (). Bi, warning him that Huang's intentions were to further advance north to ravage the center of the Tang state, suggested that Gao launch another attack to intercept Huang. However, Gao, distressed by Zhang's defeat and death, did not make any attempt to stop Huang, who subsequently continued his advance toward the eastern capital Luoyang and the imperial capital Chang'an. = Rebellion against Gao Pian = By 887, Gao Pian, who had trusted the sorcerer L√º Yongzhi, had effectively entrusted the affairs of the circuit to L√º, such that even his long-time officers Yu Gongchu () and Yao Guili () were killed due to false accusations that L√º laid against them, and this led to the officers of the circuit becoming fearful of death. Bi Shiduo was particularly anxious, because of his own status as a former follower of Huang Chao's. Further, Bi had a dispute with L√º over an incident involving one of Bi's concubines, who was known for being beautiful; because of her reputation of beauty, L√º had wanted to see her appearance, and Bi refused, but on one occasion when Bi was not at home, L√º went to see her anyway, and Bi, in anger, threw her out of the household. In summer 887, the warlord Qin Zongquan, who had rebelled against Emperor Xizong's rule at Cai Prefecture (Ëî°Â∑û, in modern Zhumadian, Henan), was sending generals out to attack the nearby circuits. Gao, hearing news that Qin was sending an army his way, commissioned Bi to take the special Baiqi Corps () to Gaoyou to prepare to resist the Qin advance. As Bi was about to leave, L√º treated him especially well, which led Bi to fear that L√º was intending to get his guards down to act against him. Even Bi's mother was fearful, and she sent a messenger to him to state, \\"If something like that happens, you should strive for yourself. Do not worry about your mother or children.\\" When Bi consulted the defender of Gaoyou, Zhang Shenjian (), whose daughter had married Bi's son, Zhang believed that L√º would not act against Bi. However, at that time, one of Gao's sons wanted Bi to act against L√º so that he could use this chance to show L√º's evil nature, intentionally sent Bi a message stating, \\"L√º Yongzhi had frequently met with the Chancellor [(i.e., Gao, who carried an honorary chancellor title)] and wants to act against you. An order has already been sent to Minister Zhang [(i.e., Zhang, who carried an honorary minister title)]. Be careful!\\" Bi confronted Zhang, who knew nothing about it, but subsequently agreed, along with Bi and Bi's friend Zheng Hanzhang (), to rise against L√º. On May 1, 887, Bi and Zheng, after issuing public declarations denouncing L√º, departed Gaoyou and advanced toward Yang Prefecture. L√º oversaw the defense and was initially able to repel Bi's attacks. Bi, who believed that his army was not strong enough to capture Yang Prefecture, sent a letter to Qin Yan, who was then the governor (ËßÄÂØü‰Ωø, Guanchashi) of Xuanshe Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠ô, headquartered in modern Xuancheng, Anhui), offering the military governorship of Huainan to him and asking for aid. Qin sent his officer Qin Chou () to reinforce Bi. Meanwhile, Gao and L√º had a falling out inside the city, and Gao put up a defense at his headquarters, commanded by his nephew Gao Jie (), to guard against L√º. Gao Pian subsequently sent the officer Shi E () to meet with Bi, along with Bi's youngest son. Bi ordered his young son to return to Gao Pian, stating, \\"If the Chancellor executes L√º Yongzhi and Zhang Shouyi [(ÂºµÂÆà‰∏Ä, a close association of L√º's and also a sorcerer that Gao trusted)] to show me his intent, I will surely not turn back on his grace, and I am willing to have my wife and children serve as hostages.\\" Gao Pian, worried that L√º might preemptively slaughter Bi's family, put Bi's family under protective custody. On May 17, Bi made a fierce attack on Yang Prefecture, but L√º's counterattack defeated him. However, at this juncture, Gao Jie launched an attack from Gao Pian's headquarters, intending to capture L√º to deliver to Bi. L√º, hearing the news, abandoned Yang Prefecture and fled. The next day, Bi made a show of force by having his troops plunder the city. Gao was forced to meet him and make him deputy military governor, and subsequently transferred all authority over the circuit to him. Bi subsequently sent a letter to Qin Yan, requesting that he come to Yang Prefecture quickly to take his post. (This was despite contrary advice given to Bi that he should instead honor Gao Pian as the titular military governor and refuse to let Qin take the post ‚Äî pointing out that he would lose power if Qin arrived, and that the other prefects throughout Huainan would surely not willingly serve under Qin, thus leading to more warfare and bloodshed.) He also put Gao and Gao's entire household under house arrest. Upon Qin's arrival, he made Bi the commander of the Huainan forces, but moved his office outside the headquarters. = Defeat = Just as the advice rejected by Bi Shiduo predicted, Yang Xingmi the prefect of Lu Prefecture (Âª¨Â∑û, in modern Hefei, Anhui) was not willing to accept Qin Yan, and he, with aid from Sun Duan () the prefect of He Prefecture (ÂíåÂ∑û, in modern Chaohu, Anhui), headed toward Yang Prefecture. L√º joined forces with him, as did Zhang Shenjian (who had been angered by Bi's refusal to share the material plunders with him). Yang Xingmi put Yang Prefecture under siege, starting June 20. Qin tried to have Bi and Zheng Hanzhang lead a counterattack against Yang Xingmi, but Yang Xingmi decisively defeated them, leading Qin not to dare to launch another counterattack against the siege afterwards. Concerned that Gao Pian might be using witchcraft to curse him and his army, he also put Gao and his entire family to death. The siege continued for months, such that the city fell into a massive famine, and Qin's soldiers from Xuanshe Circuit were eating human flesh as food. Nevertheless, Yang Xingmi was unable to capture the city and considered withdrawal. However, on November 18, L√º's associate Zhang Shenwei () opened the city gates and welcomed Yang Xingmi's forces in. Hearing the news, Qin and Bi consulted the Buddhist nun Wang Fengxian (), whom they believed to have prophetic abilities; Wang urged them to flee, and they did so, allowing Yang Xingmi to take over the city. Qin and Bi initially tried to flee to Dongtang (Êù±Â°ò, near Yang Prefecture), but the general Zhang Xiong, who then occupied Dongtang, refused to receive them. They considered heading south back to Xuanshe's headquarters Xuan Prefecture (). However, by that point, Qin Zongquan's army, commanded by his brother Qin Zongheng (), had arrived in the vicinity, and Qin Zongheng sent messengers to Qin Yan and Bi, inviting them to join forces against Yang Xingmi. They then joined Qin Zongheng. Soon thereafter, Qin Zongheng was assassinated by his deputy Sun Ru, who took over the army. Sun, along with Qin Yan and Bi, then attacked Gaoyou, capturing it, forcing Zhang Shenjian to flee to Yang Prefecture, where Yang Xingmi killed him. However, Sun did not trust Qin Yan and Bi, and gradually stripped them of their soldiers. Their officer Tang Hong (), believing that Sun would eventually kill them, decided to save himself by falsely accusing Qin Yan and Bi of working in concert with Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan). In early 888, Sun put Qin Yan, Bi, and Zheng to death.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. It stands by the side of the road from Kineton to Southam. Its general appearance is \\"long, low and massive\\". History The earliest fabric in the church is in the eastern part of the nave which dates from the middle of the 12th century. The nave was lengthened towards the west in the 14th century. Early the following century a clerestory was added to the nave, the south wall was refaced, and buttresses were added. In the 17th century the west tower was built and in about 1730 the chancel and north transept were added. The roof was repaired in 1866, and a restoration was carried out in 1906. The church vested in the Churches Conservation Trust on 1 May 1988. Architecture =Exterior= The church is constructed in ironstone, with tiled roofs. Its plan consists of a three-bay nave with a clerestory, a single-bay chancel, a north transept, and a west tower. The approximate dimensions are: the nave by , the chancel by , and the transept by . The roof of the chancel is higher than that of the nave. In the nave there are doors in the north and south walls of Norman origin. The north door has a round-headed arch, but the south door was altered in the 14th century, giving it a pointed arch. To the right of the south doorway is a buttress and a window of paired lancets, and to its left is a 14th-century two-light window. The clerestory has three straight-headed windows on each side; these are also paired lancets. On the east and west sides of the transept is a round-headed window, and in the north wall is a two-light window. In the east wall of the chancel is a Venetian window, and the south wall contains a round-headed window. The tower is in two stages with diagonal buttresses. On the west side of the lower stage is a door, above which is a two-light window. The upper stage contains a two-light louvred bell opening on each face. At the top of the tower is a moulded cornice and a crenellated parapet. =Interior= The roof of the nave is open. The tie beams are decorated with carvings, as are two of the stone corbels. The roof of the transept has a barrel roof, while the chancel has a coved and plastered ceiling. The chancel is paved with black marble and white stone. Around the wall of the chancel is a panelled, painted dado. The altar and chancel rails date from about 1730; they are in wrought iron, and the altar is partly gilt. In the south wall of the nave, below the easternmost window, is a 13th-century piscina in a niche with a trefoil head under a gable. All the stalls and pews date from the middle of the 19th century, and this is also the probable date of the family pew in the transept. Around the walls are memorials. The font is Norman in style and consists of a circular bowl on a moulded base. The bowl is carved with intersecting arcading, and its rim has dog-tooth motifs. The transept windows contain Flemish painted glass from the 18th century, set in glass dated 1855. There is a ring of six bells, all cast by Richard Keene of Woodstock in the 17th century, four in 1669, and the other two in 1693. External features In the churchyard is the base of a churchyard cross, dating from the medieval period. It is constructed in ironstone and consists of an octagonal base and two steps and a square socket stone. It is listed at Grade II. Also in the churchyard are ten tombs, headstones, and groups of headstones, all of which are listed at Grade II.

History  The first evidence of the construction of the residence in Mosbach can be traced back to when the town's fortification was erected by Count Palatine Otto I early in the fourteenth century. The context of the castle's first reigning occupant helps amplify its importance today and at the time it was first built. Through the partition of King Rupert's lands among the four surviving sons at the time of his death, Mosbach came to be the center of power for that portion of the Palatinate inherited by Otto, with Mosbach Castle as the sovereign's residence. Count Palatine Otto I, who was born in Mosbach in 1390 and then chose to have his residence there as the heir to the Palatinate Electorate in 1410, and his son Otto II, had the Castle expanded considerably after 1430, although the work done on the building was not intended to exude grandness. The most influential period for the Castle came in 1427 when, alongside the duties involved in administering the Palatinate-Mosbach, Otto I assumed the guardianship of his nephew Louis IV (Ludwig IV) and held the regency by default while his brother Louis III was too weakened and ill to rule upon his return from a crusade to Jerusalem in 1427. Otto I's nephew was still a minor and did not reach the age of majority until 1442. Starting in 1448 the sphere of influence of the Palatinate of Mosbach and its residence once again expanded when Otto I inherited half of the territory of the extinct Palatinate-Neumarkt and purchased the other half from his brother Stefan (Stephen), establishing a further residence in Neumarkt. The castle's present-day appearance largely stems from renovation carried out in 1898, including bay windows, half-timbered walls and transverse gables.

Early life and background Critchley grew up in Northfield, Birmingham. As a teenager he became involved in left-wing politics and the punk movement. In 1977 Critchley was excluded from school for leading 'pupil power' demonstrations. He finished his secondary education in a borstal after being convicted of theft and criminal damage. On his release Critchley developed a serious drug problem, drifting further into crime. In 1980 he moved to London. Arrest and murder conviction In June 1980 Critchley was found lying unconscious outside a London squat. He had suffered head injuries, a broken back, ankle and wrist. Critchley was wearing a boot on one foot and an undone trainer, two sizes too small, on the other. Police searched the squat and found the body of Edward McNeill who had been brutally beaten to death. A bloody imprint at the murder scene matched the trainer on Critchley's foot and he was arrested. Critchley was charged with murder and subsequently convicted. He was ordered to be detained at Her Majesty's Pleasure, the juvenile equivalent of a life sentence. The judge recommended that he should receive a maximum tariff of nine years. Campaign Critchley's family persistently campaigned for his release arguing that his original conviction was unsafe. They maintain that the only forensic evidence to link him to the heavily blood splattered murder scene was on the ill-fitting trainer and that witness statements naming somebody else as the killer were never put before the court. Critchley's campaigners received the support of Richard Burden MP who tabled questions in Parliament regarding this matter. Release, reimprisonment and later events Critchley was twice released from prison on licence but was returned there on both occasions after breaching its conditions. He was once again released in March 2012 and currently remains free.

Different GTA types have originated independently from viruses in several bacterial and archaeal lineages. These cells produce GTA particles containing short segments of the DNA present in the cell. After the particles are released from the producer cell, they can attach to related cells and inject their DNA into the cytoplasm. The DNA can then become part of the recipient cells' genome.  Discovery of gene transfer agents  330x330px The first GTA system was discovered in 1974, when mixed cultures of Rhodobacter capsulatus strains produced a high frequency of cells with new combinations of genes. The factor responsible was distinct from known gene-transfer mechanisms in being independent of cell contact, insensitive to deoxynuclease, and not associated with phage production. Because of its presumed function it was named gene transfer agent (GTA, now RcGTA) More recently other gene transfer agent systems have been discovered by incubating filtered (cell-free) culture medium with a genetically distinct strain.  GTA genes and evolution  left left The evolutionary forces that act on bacterial gene transfer agent and the cells that produce it. The genes specifying GTAs are derived from bacteriophage (phage) DNA that has integrated into a host chromosome. Such prophages often acquire mutations that make them defective and unable to produce phage particles. Many bacterial genomes contain one or more defective prophages that have undergone more-or less-extensive mutation and deletion. Gene transfer agents, like defective prophages, arise by mutation of prophages, but they retain functional genes for the head and tail components of the phage particle (structural genes) and the genes for DNA packaging. The phage genes specifying its regulation and DNA replication have typically been deleted, and expression of the cluster of structural genes is under the control of cellular regulatory systems. Additional genes that contribute to GTA production or uptake are usually present at other chromosome locations. Some of these have regulatory functions, and others contribute directly to GTA production (e.g. the phage-derived lysis genes) or uptake and recombination (e.g. production of cell-surface capsule and DNA transport proteins) These GTA-associated genes are often under coordinated regulation with the main GTA gene cluster. Phage-derived cell-lysis proteins (holin and endolysin) then weaken the cell wall and membrane, allowing the cell to burst and release the GTA particles. The number of GTA particles produced by each cell is not known. Some GTA systems appear to be recent additions to their host genomes, but others have been maintained for many millions of years. Where studies of sequence divergence have been done (dN/dS analysis), they indicate that the genes are being maintained by natural selection for protein function (i.e. defective versions are being eliminated). However the nature of this selection is not clear. Although the discoverers of GTA assumed that gene transfer was the function of the particles, the presumed benefits of gene transfer come at a substantial cost to the population. Most of this cost arises because GTA- producing cells must lyse (burst open) to release their GTA particles, but there are also genetic costs associated with making new combinations of genes, because most new combinations will usually be less fit than the original combination. One alternative explanation is that GTA genes persist because GTAs are genetic parasites that spread infectiously to new cells. However this is ruled out because GTA particles typically are too small to contain the genes that encode them. For example, the main RcGTA cluster (see below) is 14 kb long, but RcGTA particles can contain only 4‚Äì5 kb of DNA. Most bacteria have not been screened for the presence of GTAs, and many more GTA systems may await discovery. Although DNA-based surveys for GTA-related genes have found homologs in many genomes, but interpretation is hindered by the difficulty of distinguishing genes that encode GTAs from ordinary prophage genes.  GTA production  left In laboratory cultures, production of GTAs is typically maximized by particular growth conditions that induce transcription of the GTA genes; most GTAs are not induced by the DNA-damaging treatments that induce many prophages. Even under maximally inducing conditions only a small fraction of the culture produces GTAs, typically less than 1%. The steps in GTA production are derived from those of phage infection. The structural genes are first transcribed and translated, and the proteins assembled into empty heads and unattached tails. The DNA packaging machinery then packs DNA into each head, cutting the DNA when the head is full, attaching a tail to the head, and then moving the newly-created DNA end on to a new empty head. Unlike prophage genes, the genes encoding GTAs are not excised from the genome and replicated for packaging in GTA particles. The two best studied GTAs (RcGTA and BaGTA) randomly package all of the DNA in the cell, with no overrepresentation of GTA-encoding genes. The number of GTA particles produced by each cell is not known.  GTA-mediated transduction  Genetic transduction by bacterial gene transfer agents. (1) GTA particles encounter a suitable recipient cell. (2) Particles attach to cell and inject their DNA, and cellular proteins translocate the DNA across the inner membrane. (3) DNA is degraded if it cannot recombine with the recipient genome. (4) DNA with similar sequences to the recipient genome undergoes recombination. Whether release of GTA particles leads to transfer of DNA to new genomes depends on several factors. First, the particles must survive in the environment ‚Äì little is known about this, although particles are reported to be quite unstable under laboratory conditions. Second, particles must encounter and attach to suitable recipient cells, usually members of the same or a closely related species. Like phages, GTAs attach to specific protein or carbohydrate structures on the recipient cell surface before injecting their DNA. Unlike phage, the well-studied GTAs appear to inject their DNA only across the first of the two membranes surrounding the recipient cytoplasm, and they use a different system, competence-derived rather than phage-derived, to transport one strand of the double-stranded DNA across the inner membrane into the cytoplasm. If the cell's recombinational repair machinery finds a chromosomal sequence very similar to the incoming DNA, it replaces the former with the latter by homologous recombination, mediated by the cell's RecA protein. If the sequences are not identical this will produce a cell with a new genetic combination. However, if the incoming DNA is not closely related to DNA sequences in the cell it will be degraded, and the cell will reuse its nucleotides for DNA replication.  Specific GTA systems  = RcGTA (Rhodobacter capsulatus) = 330x330px The GTA produced by the alphaproteobacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus, named R. capsulatus GTA (RcGTA), is currently the best studied GTA. When laboratory cultures of R. capsulatus enter stationary phase, a subset of the bacterial population induces production of RcGTA, and the particles are subsequently released from the cells through cell lysis. Most of the RcGTA structural genes are encoded in a ~ 15 kb genetic cluster on the bacterial chromosome. However, other genes required for RcGTA function, such as the genes required for cell lysis, are located separately. RcGTA particles contain 4.5 kb DNA fragments, with even representation of the whole chromosome except for a 2-fold dip at the site of the RcGTA gene cluster. Regulation of GTA production and transduction has been best studied in R. capsulatus, where a quorum-sensing system and a CtrA- phosphorelay control expression of not only the main RcGTA gene cluster, but also a holin/endolysin cell lysis system, particle head spikes, an attachment protein (possibly tail fibers), and the capsule and DNA processing genes needed for RcGTA recipient function. An uncharacterized stochastic process further limits expression of the gene cluster is to only 0.1-3% of the cells. RcGTA-like clusters are found in a large subclade of the alphaproteobacteria, although the genes also appear to be frequently lost by deletion. Recently, several members of the order Rhodobacterales have been demonstrated to produce functional RcGTA-like particles. Groups of genes with homology to the RcGTA are present in the chromosomes of various types of alphaproteobacteria. = DsGTA (Dinoroseobacter shibae) = D. shibae, like R. capsulatus, is a member of the Order Rhodobacterales, and its GTA shares a common ancestor and many features with RcGTA, including gene organization, packaging of short DNA fragments (4.2 kb) and regulation by quorum sensing and a CtrA phosphorelay. However, its DNA packaging machinery has much more specificity, with sharp peaks and valleys of coverage suggestion that it may preferentially initiate packaging at specific sites in the genome. The DNA of the major DsGTA gene cluster is packaged very poorly. = BaGTA (Bartonella species) = Bartonella species are members of the Alphaproteobacteria like R. capsulatus and D. shibae, but BaGTA is not related to RcGTA and DsGTA. BaGTA particles are larger than RcGTA and contain 14 kb DNA fragments. Although this capacity could in principle allow BaGTA to package and transmit its 14 kb GTA cluster, measurements of DNA coverage show reduced coverage of the cluster. An adjacent region of high coverage is thought to be due to local DNA replication. = VSH-1 (Brachyspira hyodysenteriae) = Brachyspira is a genus of spirochete; several species have been shown to carry homologous GTA gene clusters. Particles contain 7.5 kb DNA fragments. Production of VSH-1 is stimulated by the DNA-damaging agent mitomycin C and by some antibiotics. It is also associated with detectable cell lysis, indicating that a substantial fraction of the culture may be producing VSH-1. = Dd1 (Desulfovibriondesulfuricans) = D. desulfuricans is a soil bacterium in the deltaproteobacteria; Dd1 packages 13.6 kb DNA fragments = VTA (Methanococcus voltae) = M. voltae is an archaean; its GTA is known to transfer 4.4 kb DNA fragments but has not been otherwise characterized.

According to hadith, narrated by Malik ibn Anas and found in Sahih Muslim, it is said that on Muhammad's Night Journey, he encountered Idris in the fourth heaven., The traditions that have developed around the figure of Idris have given him the scope of a prophet as well as a philosopher and mystic,Wheeler, Historical Dictionary of the Prophets in Islam and Judaism, Idris, pg. 148 and many later Muslim mystics, or Sufis, including Ruzbihan Baqli and Ibn Arabi, also mentioned having encountered Idris in their spiritual visions.Encyclopedia of Islam, Juan Eduardo Campo, Infobase Publishing, 2009, pg. 345\\" Name The name \\"Idris\\", , has been described as perhaps having the origin of meaning \\"interpreter.\\"Encyclopedia of Islam, Infobase Publishing, 2009, pg. 344: \\"It probably originated as a term in ancient Hebrew for \\"interpreter\\"...\\" Traditionally, Islam holds the prophet as having functioned an interpretive and mystical role and therefore this meaning garnered a general acceptance. Later Muslim sources, those of the eighth century, began to hold that Idris had two names, \\"Idris\\" and \\"Enoch,\\" and other sources even stated that \\"Idris' true name is Enoch and that he is called Idris in Arabic because of his devotion to the study of the sacred books of his ancestors Adam and Seth.\\"Encyclopedia of Islam, Juan Eduardo Campo, Infobase Publishing, 2009, pg. 344 Therefore, these later sources also highlighted Idris as either meaning \\"interpreter\\" or having some meaning close to that of an interpretive role. Several of the classical commentators on the Quran, such as Al-Baizawi, said he was \\"called Idris from the Arabic dars, meaning \\"to study,\\" from his knowledge of divine mysteries.\\"A Dictionary of Islam, T.P. Hughes, Ashraf Printing Press, repr. 1989, pg. 192 Quran Idris is mentioned twice in the Quran, where he is described as a wise man. In chapter 19 of the Quran, God says: Later, in chapter 21, Idris is again praised: Life and prophethood Idris was born in Babylon, a city in present-day Iraq. Before he received the Revelation, he followed the rules revealed to Prophet Seth, the son of Adam. When Idris grew older, God bestowed Prophethood on him. During his lifetime all the people were not yet Muslims. Afterwards, Idris left his hometown of Babylon because a great number of the people committed many sins even after he told them not to do so. Some of his people left with Idris. It was hard for them to leave their home. They asked Prophet Idris: \\"If we leave Babylon, where will we find a place like it?\\" Prophet Idris said: \\"If we immigrate for the sake of Allah, He will provide for us.\\" So the people went with Prophet Idris and they reached the land of Egypt. They saw the Nile River. Idris stood at its bank and mentioned Allah, the Exalted, by saying: \\"Subhanallah.\\"http://www.alsunna.org/Islamic-History-of-the-Prophets-of-God- aalanbyaaa.html#gsc.tab=0 Muslim literature Islamic literature narrates that Idris was made prophet at around 40, which parallels the age when Muhammad began to prophesy, and lived during a time when people had begun to worship fire.Lives of the Prophets, Leila Azzam Exegesis embellishes upon the lifetime of Idris, and states that the prophet divided his time into two. For three days of the week, Idris would preach to his people and four days he would devote solely to the worship of God. Many early commentators, such as Tabari,History of the Prophets and Kings, Tabari, Volume I: Prophets and Patriarchs credited Idris with possessing great wisdom and knowledge. Exegesis narrates that Idris was among \\"the first men to use the pen as well as being one of the first men to observe the movement of the stars and set out scientific weights and measures.\\" These attributes remain consistent with the identification of Enoch with Idris, as these attributes make it clear that Idris would have most probably lived during the Generations of Adam, the same era during which Enoch lived. Ibn Arabi described Idris as the \\"prophet of the philosophers\\" and a number of works were attributed to him.Encyclopedia of Islam, G. Vajda, Idris Some scholars wrote commentaries on these supposed works,Ibn Sabi'n is said to have written on one of Idris's works cf. Hajiji Khalifa, iii, 599, no. 7010 all while Idris was also credited with several inventions, including the art of making garments. The commentator Ibn Ishaq narrated that he was the first man to write with a pen and that he was born when Adam still had 308 years of his life to live. In his commentary on the Quranic verses 19:56-57, the commentator Ibn Kathir narrated \\"During the Night Journey, the Prophet passed by him in fourth heaven. In a hadith, Ibn Abbas asked Ka‚Äôb what was meant by the part of the verse which says, ‚ÄùAnd We raised him to a high station.‚Äù Ka‚Äôb explained: Allah revealed to Idris: ‚ÄòI would raise for you every day the same amount of the deeds of all Adam‚Äôs children‚Äô ‚Äì perhaps meaning of his time only. So Idris wanted to increase his deeds and devotion. A friend of his from the angels visited and Idris said to him: ‚ÄòAllah has revealed to me such and such, so could you please speak to the angel of death, so I could increase my deeds.‚Äô The angel carried him on his wings and went up into the heavens. When they reached the fourth heaven, they met the angel of death who was descending down towards earth. The angel spoke to him about what Idris had spoken to him before. The angel of death said: ‚ÄòBut where is Idris?‚Äô He replied, ‚ÄòHe is upon my back.‚Äô The angel of death said: ‚ÄòHow astonishing! I was sent and told to seize his soul in the fourth heaven. I kept thinking how I could seize it in the fourth heaven when he was on the earth?‚Äô Then he took his soul out of his body, and that is what is meant by the verse: ‚ÄòAnd We raised him to a high station.‚ÄôTafsir Ibn Kathir; commentary 19:56-57 Early accounts of Idris' life attributed \\"thirty portions of revealed scripture\\" to him. Therefore, Idris was understood by many early commentators to be both a prophet as well as a messenger. Several modern commentators have linked this sentiment with Biblical apocrypha such as the Book of Enoch and the Second Book of Enoch. Identification =Enoch= Elijah and Enoch - seventeenth-century icon, Historic Museum in Sanok, Poland Idris is generally accepted to be the same as Enoch. Many of the early Qur'anic commentators, such as Tabari and Al-Baizawi identified Idris with Enoch. Al-Baizawi said: \\"Idris was of the posterity of Seth and a forefather of Noah, and his name was Enoch (ar. Akhnukh)\\" Classical commentators used to popularly identify Idris with Enoch, the patriarch who lived in the Generations of Adam. An example is ƒ∞smail Hakkƒ± Bursev√Æ's commentary on Fusus al-hikam by Muhyiddin ibn  ªArabi.Zaid H. Assfy Islam and Christianity: connections and contrasts, together with the stories of the prophets and imams Sessions, 1977 p122 Modern scholars, however, do not concur with this identification because they argue that it lacks definitive proof. As Quranic translator Abdullah Yusuf Ali says in note 2508 of his translation: With this identification, Idris's father becomes Yarid (Arabic Ÿäÿ±ŸäÿØ), his mother Barkanah, and his wife Aadanah. Idris's son Methuselah would eventually be the grandfather of Prophet Nuh (Noah). Hence Idris is identified as the great-grandfather of Noah. =Hermes Trismegistus= A late Arabic writer wrote of the Sabaeans that their religion had a sect of star worshipers who held their doctrine to come from Hermes Trismegistus through the prophet Adimun. Antoine Faivre, in The Eternal Hermes (1995), has pointed out that Hermes Trismegistus has a place in the Islamic tradition, although the name Hermes does not appear in the Quran. Hagiographers and chroniclers of the first centuries of the Islamic Hegira quickly identified Hermes Trismegistus with Idris,Kevin Van Bladel, The Arabic Hermes. From pagan sage to prophet of science, Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 168 \\"Abu Mas'har‚Äôs biography of Hermes, written approximately between 840 and 860, would establish it as common knowledge.\\" the nabi of surahs 19.56-57 and 21.85, whom the Arabs also identified with Enoch (cf. Genesis 5.18‚Äì24). Idris/Hermes was termed \\"Thrice- Wise\\" Hermes Trismegistus because he had a threefold origin. The first Hermes, comparable to Thoth, was a \\"civilizing hero\\", an initiator into the mysteries of the divine science and wisdom that animate the world; he carved the principles of this sacred science in hieroglyphs. The second Hermes, in Babylon, was the initiator of Pythagoras. The third Hermes was the first teacher of alchemy. \\"A faceless prophet,\\" writes the Islamicist Pierre Lory, \\"Hermes possesses no concrete or salient characteristics, differing in this regard from most of the major figures of the Bible and the Quran.\\"(Faivre 1995 pp. 19‚Äì20) A common interpretation of the representation of \\"Trismegistus\\" as \\"thrice great\\" recalls the three characterizations of Idris: as a messenger of god, or a prophet; as a source of wisdom, or hikmet (wisdom from hokmah); and as a king of the world order, or a \\"sultanate\\". These are referred to as m√ºselles bin ni'me. =Other identifications= Due to the linguistic dissimilarities of the name \\"Idris\\" with the aforementioned figures, several historians have proposed that this Quranic figure is derived from \\"Andreas\\", the immortality-achieving cook from the Syriac Alexander romance.√áakmak, √áenap. Islam: A World Encyclopedia, Vol. 1: A-E. 2017. p 674-675.Brown, John Porter. The Darvishes: Or Oriental Spiritualism. Edited by H. A. Rose. 1968. p 174, footnote 3.Brinner, William M.

Between 1972 and 1990 she was known as Gillian Wise Ciobotaru. Early life and education Wise was born at Ilford in London to Arthur, a timber merchant, and Elsie, n√©e Holden, a milliner. She studied art at the Wimbledon College of Art from 1954 to 1957 and then at the Central School of Arts and Crafts during 1959. Career Before she graduated, Wise was already showing works with a group of Constructionist artists, exhibiting at the 1957 Young Contemporaries exhibition at the Royal British Artists gallery and in the New Vision Centre's abstract show in 1958. In 1961 she became the youngest member of the Constructionist group, centred on Victor Pasmore and including Adrian Heath, John Ernest, Anthony Hill, Kenneth Martin, and Mary Martin. In the 1960s her work became much more widely shown with exhibitions in London (at the Drian and Axiom galleries, the Institute of Contemporary Arts and the Victoria and Albert Museum), in Chicago, and at the 1965 Tokyo Biennale and the 1969 Nuremberg Biennale. In 1968, she gained a UNESCO Fellowship award to study in Prague, followed in 1969 by a British Council scholarship to study Russian constructivism in Leningrad. In Leningrad she met and married an architect, Adrian Ciobotaru. In the same year she exhibited with a group of British artists in an exhibition of systems-based abstraction in Finland, followed in 1970 by her joining many of the same artists in the newly formed Systems Group and quitting the Constructionist group. Her fellow artists in that group included Jeffrey Steele, Peter Lowe, Malcolm Hughes, Jean Spencer, Michael Kidner, John Ernest, and David Saunders. She exhibited with the group in Matrix at the Arnolfini Gallery in Bristol in 1970, and then in 1972, at the Whitechapel Gallery in the Arts Council's Systems exhibition. The Arts Council also commissioned her to curate the Constructivist section of the 1978 Hayward Annual, followed in the same year by her inclusion in the Arts Council's Constructive Context show. Wise taught at the Chelsea College of Art and Design and Central Saint Martins School of Art between 1971 and 1974, and later spent several years teaching and studying in the US after being elected in 1981 as a Fellow of the Centre for Advanced Visual Studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She also had appointments as Visiting Artist and Visiting Scholar at Harvard University and the University of California. While in the USA she was twice nominated in the UK as an Royal Academy member, her nominees including the architects Ern≈ë Goldfinger, Richard Rogers, and Hugh Casson, together, among others, with the artists Sandra Blow, William Scott, and Peter Blake. Her absence in the US and later Paris prevented her election but the range and status of her nominees is evidence of the high regard for the quality and integrity of her work held by many leading artists and architects. Early in the 1980s, Wise was commissioned by Chamberlin, Powell and Bon, the architects of the Barbican Centre in London, to design the large-scale mural construction, known as The Alice Walls, in the stairwell to the main cinema. This work incorporates mirrors ‚Äî a feature along with glass prisms which she has used in a number of her reliefs as a way of introducing effects of light which add to the perceptual interest of the abstract. This followed several other architectural commissions, including a screen for the International Union of Architects Congress (1961), a wall screen for the Cunard liner, Queen Elizabeth II (1968), and wall reliefs for Nottingham University Hospital (1973), for the Open University (1980), and a relief panel for Unilever House in London in 1982. Later life and death Living in France for much of her later career, Wise's exhibitions in the UK became infrequent in the 1990s, although she was shown several times in Paris during this decade and, in 1995, in Chicago. In the 2000s, her work has been included in group exhibitions in the Osborne Samuel and Poussin galleries in London, at the British Art Fair, and in two exhibitions of British abstract and systems-based art at the Southampton City Art Gallery. In 2010, her work was included along with that of Victor Pasmore, Anthony Hill, John Ernest, and Mary and Kenneth Martin in Tate Britain's year-long display, Construction England. In 2012 she visited Novosbirsk in Siberia to submit her eventually unsuccessful entry in an open international competition for a memorial to the Soviet artist and designer El Lissitzky. In 2013 she visited Brazil where her work was in a S√£o Paulo exhibition of British and Brazilian constructive artists. Elements of this show were shown by the Dan Galleria gallery in the London 2013 Frieze event. Examples of her work are held in many public collections including the Tate, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the British Government Art Collection, the Arts Council and the Henry Moore Institute and in collections in the US, Finland and Hungary. Wise died in April 2020, of COVID-19 while living in the Paris care home to which she had moved following the deterioration of her health in 2018.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a Grade I listed building, and is now a redundant church in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. It was declared redundant on 1 November 2002, and was vested in the Trust on 14 September 2005. History The church was built of dressed limestone in the late 13th century, replacing a church which had stood on the site since the 12th century. The tower with its five pinnacles and the north and south aisles followed in the 14th century. Extensive rebuilding was undertaken in the 19th century. The church no longer has its pews or other fittings; the remains of medieval paintings can still be seen on the walls, including a set of 17th- century bell ringing changes painted on the north wall of the tower. The village is part of the British Army's training grounds on the Salisbury Plain. The entire civilian population was evicted in 1943 to provide an exercise area for American troops preparing for the invasion of Europe during the Second World War. After the war, villagers were not allowed to return to their homes, so the church's font was moved to Brixton Deverill, the pulpit to Winterbourne Stoke and the seating, bell and two effigies to Edington Priory. The village, which is still classed as an urban entity, remains under the control of the Ministry of Defence despite several attempts by former residents to return. Non-military access is limited to a few days a year. Unlike the rest of the parish, St Giles's church and its graveyard remained in the hands of the Diocese of Salisbury, although access to them was and is controlled by the Ministry of Defence. The civil parish of Imber was eventually incorporated into neighbouring Heytesbury, to the south, while for Church of England purposes the ecclesiastical parish of Imber was incorporated into the parish of Edington, to the north. Restoration By 2001 it had become clear, according to a Church of England press release, that St Giles's \\"was in need of extensive repairs.\\" Since it was \\"not possible for the parochial church council to accept liability for the maintenance of a building to which they only had effective access for worship once a year\\", the Edington-with-Imber PCC requested that Imber church be declared redundant, setting in train a process which ended in 2005 with the vesting of the church in the Churches Conservation Trust. In the meantime, the church tower had been struck by lightning in 2003, weakening the structure, but restoration work commenced in 2008 and the annual service resumed in September 2009 on completion of the works. After extensive restoration, a ring of six bells was installed in August 2010.

Early life and education Cutler was born on June 29, 1915, in Cleveland, Ohio, to Grace Amanda Allen and Glenn Allen Cutler. He graduated from Western Reserve University Medical School in 1941, and joined the Public Health Service in 1942.

This study not only violated the Hippocratic Oath but it echoed Nazi crimes exposed around the same time at the Nuremberg trials. In 1954, Cutler was in charge of experiments at Sing Sing prison to see if a vaccine made from the killed syphilis bacterium, would protect prisoners against infection when he later exposed them to the bacterium. Those infected were later treated with penicillin. Cutler became assistant surgeon general in 1958. In the 1960s until November 1972, Cutler was involved in the ongoing Tuskegee syphilis experiment, during which several hundred African-American men who had contracted syphilis were observed, but left untreated. In ‚ÄúThe Deadly Deception‚Äù, the 1993 Nova documentary about the Tuskegee experiments, Cutler states, ‚ÄúIt was important that they were supposedly untreated, and it would be undesirable to go ahead and use large amounts of penicillin to treat the disease, because you‚Äôd interfere with the study.‚Äù In 1967 Cutler was appointed professor of international health at the University of Pittsburgh, where he also served as chairman of the department of health administration and acting dean of the Graduate School of Public Health in 1968‚Äì1969.

He joined forced with Sun Ru thereafter against Yang, but was killed by Sun.  Background and participation in Huang Chao's rebellion  It is not known when Qin Yan was born, but it is known that he was from Xu Prefecture (ÂæêÂ∑û, in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu), where he served as a soldier, and that he was originally named Qin Li. During the Qianfu era (874-879) of Emperor Xizong, there was an occasion when he was accused of theft and imprisoned, set to be sentenced to death. One night, he dreamed of someone telling him, \\"You may follow me.\\" Once he woke up, he broke out of jail. He changed his name to Qin Yan, and he gathered a group of 100 men. With these men, he surprised and killed the magistrate of Xiapei County (‰∏ãÈÇ≥, in modern Xuzhou), seizing the supplies of the county government. He then took these men and joined the army of the agrarian rebel Huang Chao.Old Book of Tang, vol. 182. In 879, the Tang military governor (Jiedushi) of Zhenhai Circuit (ÈéÆÊµ∑, headquartered in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu), Gao Pian, sent his officers Zhang Lin () and Liang Zan () to attack Huang, and they repeatedly defeated Huang. Qin, along with several other key Huang followers, including Bi Shiduo, Li Hanzhi, and Xu Qing (), surrendered to Gao.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 253. Gao made him the prefect of He Prefecture (ÂíåÂ∑û, in modern Chaohu, Anhui).  Seizure of Xuanshe Circuit  In 882, Qin Yan had his son take several thousand soldiers to make a surprise attack on Xuanshe Circuit's capital Xuan Prefecture (). Qin's forces expelled the governor (ËßÄÂØü‰Ωø, Guanchashi) of Xuanshe, Dou Jue (), who was ill at that time, allowing Qin to take his place. The imperial government, unable to take any other action, allowed Qin to remain as governor.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 255. Dou's staff member Zhang Ji (), despising Qin, left Xuan Prefecture.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 256.  Seizure of Yang Prefecture  In summer 887, Bi Shiduo, fearing that he would be targeted for execution by L√º Yongzhi, a sorcerer that Gao Pian, who was then the military governor of Huainan Circuit, trusted and who had taken effective control of the governance of Huainan, rebelled and put Huainan's capital Yang Prefecture under siege. With L√º defending the city, however, Bi could not quickly capture the city, so he sent messengers to Qin Yan, seeking aid and offering to support Qin to be the military governor of Huainan if they were victorious. Qin Yan sent his officer Qin Chou () to aid Bi in the siege. With Gao and his nephew Gao Jie () turning against L√º inside the city, L√º abandoned it and fled, allowing Bi to seize the city and put Gao and his family under house arrest. Bi welcomed Qin to Yang Prefecture and supported him as Huainan's military governor.  Defeat and death  However, Yang Xingmi the prefect of Lu Prefecture (Âª¨Â∑û, in modern Hefei, Anhui) refused to recognize Qin. He joined forces with Sun Duan () the prefect of He Prefecture, L√º, and Bi's erstwhile ally Zhang Shenjian () (who was angry that Bi was not sharing the spoils of war with him) and put Yang Prefecture under siege. Qin sent Bi and Zheng Hanzhang () to counterattack, but Bi and Zheng were crushed by Yang Xingmi. The city fell into a deep famine, and the Xuanshe soldiers resorted to cannibalism. Nevertheless, Yang Xingmi was unable to capture the city and considered withdrawal. However, on November 18, L√º's associate Zhang Shenwei () opened the city gates and welcomed Yang Xingmi's forces in. Hearing the news, Qin and Bi consulted the Buddhist nun Wang Fengxian (), whom they believed to have prophetic abilities; Wang urged them to flee, and they did so, allowing Yang Xingmi to take over the city. Qin and Bi initially tried to flee to Dongtang (Êù±Â°ò, near Yang Prefecture), but the general Zhang Xiong, who then occupied Dongtang, refused to receive them. They considered heading south back to Xuanshe's headquarters Xuan Prefecture (). However, by that point, Qin Zongquan's army, commanded by his brother Qin Zongheng (), had arrived in the vicinity, and Qin Zongheng sent messengers to Qin Yan and Bi, inviting them to join forces against Yang Xingmi. They then joined Qin Zongheng. Soon thereafter, Qin Zongheng was assassinated by his deputy Sun Ru, who took over the army. Sun, along with Qin Yan and Bi, then attacked Gaoyou, capturing it, forcing Zhang Shenjian to flee to Yang Prefecture, where Yang Xingmi killed him. However, Sun did not trust Qin Yan and Bi, and gradually stripped them of their soldiers. Their officer Tang Hong (), believing that Sun would eventually kill them, decided to save himself by falsely accusing Qin Yan and Bi of working in concert with Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan). In early 888, Sun put Qin Yan, Bi, and Zheng to death.

It was named √òsterdalens Social-Demokrat from 1915 to 1919 and Hedmark Fylkes Arbeiderblad from 1923 to 1925. Pre-history The Labour Party for many years lacked an organ in the region √òsterdalen. The region was to a certain degree covered by Hedemarkens Amts Socialdemokrat (Solungen) from 1908, and by Demokraten from September 1909. Northern √òsterdalen was to a certain degree covered by R√∏ros newspaper Arbeidets Rett. In April 1913 the board of the party chapter in Southern √òsterdalen (a constituency for general elections) decided to start working for their own newspaper. They first tried to negotiate with Solungen, but to no avail, and Solungen also went defunct. In May 1915 the party chapter definitely decided to print their own newspaper.Solbakken, 1951: pp. 139‚Äì143 History √òsterdalens Social-Demokrat was started on 7 July 1915. The first editor was Olav S√¶ter, and \\"faktor\\" was Johs. Borchgrevink. In January 1916 Olav Vegheim was hired as manager and sub- editor. The name was changed to √òsterdalens Arbeiderblad in 1919. In 1922 S√¶ter was elected to the Parliament of Norway, and Johannes Stubberud became acting editor-in-chief. The newspaper struggled financially. In 1921 there were proposals to merge the newspaper into Demokraten. It was rejected for the time being, but a committee to work with this question was named in 1923. When it became clear that the Labour Party might be split in two, the board √òsterdalens Arbeiderblad sympathized with the communist opposition, prompting Stubberud to resign and be replaced by acting editor Evald O. Solbakken. On 10 November 1923, after the Communist Party of Norway was founded and Arbeideren (the new name of Demokraten) aligned with that, a conference was held where most people agreed that √òsterdalens Arbeiderblad should be discontinued and Arbeideren take over as organ for √òsterdalen. On 11 November the tide turned completely as the supervisory council decided that √òsterdalens Arbeiderblad should side with the Labour Party. Elverum Labour Party also decided to stay in the party instead of following the communists. Solbakken was fired, and S√¶ter returned. He remained so until 1932. Other acting editors during the newspaper's existence were Gerhard Iversen, Georg Svendsen and Johs. Borchgrevink. As the Labour Party had lost both Arbeideren of Hamar and Glomdalens Arbeiderblad of Kongsvinger, √òsterdalens Arbeiderblad became the party organ for the entire Hedmark county. It was subsequently renamed to Hedmark Fylkes Arbeiderblad in December 1923, and had local offices in Hamar and Kongsvinger. It remained under that name until July 1925, when Hamar Arbeiderblad was set up as an alternative for the Hamar district. The name was reverted. In the southern county where the Labour Party still had no newspaper, √òsterdalens Arbeiderblad published a \\"spin-off product\\" called Sol√∏r-Odal Arbeiderblad. This ended in 1926 when Kongsvinger Arbeiderblad was established, from the ashes of the now-defunct Glomdalens Arbeiderblad.Solbakken, 1951: p. 136 Several local party chapters in √òsterdalen felt it unnecessary to have three newspapers in the county. Discussions whether to have one, two or three newspapers took place over the next years. In 1932 the county convention in the Labour Party asked the local chapters in √òsterdalen what they wanted. When seven chapters signalized the wish for Hamar Arbeiderblad as their regional newspaper, Hamar Arbeiderblad set up an office in Rena. The people in Elverum Labour Party and √òsterdalens Arbeiderblad gave up. After its last issue on 2 December 1932, the newspaper was incorporated into Hamar Arbeiderblad. Hamar Arbeiderblad moved its Rena office to Elverum; the office was bombed asunder by Germany during the Norwegian Campaign.Solbakken, 1951: p. 146 References 1932 disestablishments in Norway 1915 establishments in Norway Defunct newspapers published in Norway Labour Party (Norway) newspapers Mass media in Elverum Norwegian-language newspapers Publications established in 1915 Publications disestablished in 1932 ","title":"√òsterdalens Arbeiderblad"},{"id":"29028396","text":"Karol Kuƒçera was the defending champion but did not compete that year.

Life Arranz-Bravo studied at the San Jorge Fine Arts School in Barcelona from 1959 to 1962\\\\. In 1961, he held his first individual exhibition, \\"15 paintings by Arranz\\", in the Club Universitario de Barcelona. The exhibition that brought him recognition from the Barcelona critics was that organized by the Centre de Cultura Contempor√†nia de Barcelona in 1962. Between 1968 and 1970, he was part of a group of artists consisting of Gerard Sala, Robert Llim√≥s and Rafael Lozano Bartolozzi, with whom he continued to collaborate until 1982, alternating between collective and individual exhibitions. His contact with these artists influenced his early work. Arranz-Bravo's early work was abstract and moved towards new figuration and pop art. All the artists, however, continued with their own work at the same time. He worked together with Bartolozzi on the mural at the factory Tipel in Parets del Vall√®s (1968), in a hotel establishment in Magalluf (1973), on the fa√ßade of the Barcelona International Centre of Photography (1978) and in the house of Camilo Jos√© Cela in Mallorca (1979), and also took part in the exhibitions held in the Bleu gallery in Stockholm (1971), where his Tauromaquias series was presented, \\"Sketches and marble sculptures\\", in the Gaspar gallery in Barcelona (1973, 1977 and 1979), at the Vandr√©s gallery in Madrid (1975 and 1980) and at the Tinell Exhibition Centre in Barcelona (1979): \\"Mides universals\\". They also organized events, published books, sculptures and wooden structures. In 1981 he gave his first individual exhibition. In 1982, he presented his series Abra√ßades at the Miguel Marcos gallery in Zaragoza and in 1983 he held an anthological exhibition of his work at the Gaspar Exhibition Centre in Barcelona.

From 1986 to 1988 he exhibited in several cities in Spain and abroad, such as Madrid, Amsterdam, Paris and Rio de Janeiro. In 1989 he presented an exhibition of his work of the previous three years in the Museum of Modern Art in S√£o Paulo and an anthological exhibition in the Palau Robert in Barcelona.

Its members were counts (Gaugrafen) in the Nahegau, perhaps as undercounts of the Salian dynasty. The conventional name Emichones is due to the prevailing first name \\"Emich\\". Several later families may trace their origins to the Emichones.  History  The Nahegau was next to the Wormsgau and Speyergau, a possession of the Salian dynasty. In 940 Emich, a vassal of Count Conrad der Rote, received goods from Hadamar of Fulda in the Wormsgau. This Emich is probably related to the Counts of Leiningen, although it is dubious, whether he belongs to the Emichones family because of a lack of primary source documents. Secure evidence for the Emichones appears in 961. A count and knight Emich received through sentence (law) according to Frankish law the possessions which until then had belonged to the Lords Lantbert, Megingoz and Reginzo, including Kirn and Bergen. These lords were supposedly sons of Nortbold, one of the first proprietors of a castle mentioned in 926, possibly the Schmidtburg. Counts with the name Emich are documented without interval between 960 and 1065. Even so, a precise genealogy has hitherto not been organized. The Count of Nahegau Emich IV supposedly married before 1072 Kunigunde, the sister of the Count of Trechirgau Berthold, the latter the founder of the Abbey of Ravengiersburg. The family of the Bertholds (or a branch of this family) died out with him. Emich V left around 1091 the title of Gaugraf behind and named himself Count of Flonheim in 1098 and Count of Schmidtburg in 1107, therefore ending the history of the Emichones, with the family dividing itself into the Wildgraves, Raugraves and Counts of Veldenz. A Berthold of Stromberg was apparently the brother of Emich V, a member of a collateral branch of the Emichones residing at the castle Stromburg and Vogt of Ravengiersburg.  Structure  # Counts of Veldenz # Wildgraves # Raugraves # (supposedly) Counts of Leiningen (first line Alt-Leiningen) According to various theories the Counts of Sponheim also descended from the Emichones on the male side.

If not captured and killed right away, it is said to crawl underneath the sleeping mother and kill her. Kekkai The sankai is known as a in Saitama Prefecture and Kanagawa Prefecture, and in Nagano Prefecture. Legends about its outer appearance are sparse, however it is said to look like cattle and is said to be hairy. Kekkai is also said to bury under the house to kill its mother. In Urawa, a practice existed of surrounding the bottom of a house with by≈çbu during childbirth to prevent this maneuver. It is theorized that the etymology may derive from , meaning an area restricted for religious reasons. In the Ashigara region of Kanagawa Prefecture, the sankai is said to move immediately while still bloody, the jizaikagi of an irori, or hearth. If the kekkai successfully escapes, the woman was believed to die. In order to prevent this, someone would have to guard the irori, typically equipped with a shamoji. Folklorist Iwao Hino recalls spotting a kekkai at a freak show during childhood. The show stated that it was given birth by a woman at a University hospital, however Hino later believed that it must have been a trained night monkey.

Jones is the co-founder of Notting Hill Press with author Talli Roland and author Michele Gorman. Books Her books tend to be aimed for a female audience, often falling into the women's fiction or \\"chick lit\\" categories. All of her novels feature travel as a dominant theme, often with the protagonist travelling to a new place and centring on the events that unfold there.
